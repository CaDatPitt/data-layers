PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS

Gma'nczzfz'on means the start of a profession

for these men and women.

SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY

Short discussion in the balls at dent school.

Pic on Page 111;: Perfection is a “must"
in Prosthesis lab.

THESE COMPETENT PROFESSIONALS maintained the
School of Dentistry’s prestige as one of the ﬁnest
schools of its type in the country.

From thousands of applications, come the select
class of men who are eager to pursue the profession of
dentistry. The School has always had as its objectives
the training of students in the diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention of oral diseases, disorders and deﬁciencies.
In addition, much stress is given to the student’s re-
sponsibilities to his patients, fellow dentists, and to the
members of other health services.

With a ﬁrm background in the sciences, the student
is given thorough training in the most modern tech-
niques of scientiﬁc dentistry. For the ﬁrst two years,
the dent makes his “home” in, Upper Dental School
where he studies anatomy, prosthesis, histology, and
many other related sciences. The junior and senior
year however, ﬁnds the dent in the dental inﬁrmary
applying what he has learned to actual patients.

The*School of Dentistry received quite a bit of
publicity this year for its outstanding work in Pedodon-

tics, or the special training of dental students in the
care of children.

So successful have the dents been with the children,
that rather than dreading the dentist, the children
help them by inspecting the instruments and squirting
water into their own mouths. Some children are so
relaxed that they actually fall asleep in the chair.
Another source of recognition to the dent school this
year are the experiments with ﬂuorine treatment.

As is the case in most professional schools, the
dent’s life is not an easy one. His days and nights too
are comprised of dentistry, dentistry, and then more so.
But helping make the road as easy as possible is Dean
Van Kirk. Knowing the responsibility his students
face, the Dean and his staff prepare them to practice
dentistry with due regard for its social, economic, and
ethical relationships.

Thus, although the dent works strenuously for his
four years, he can be justly assured of a bright future in
a proud profession.

heritage of sixteen countries is preserved.

SCHOOL OF
MEDICINE

Dr. W. S. McEllroy

Pic on page 1292: Test-tubes, instruments, scales-—learn-
ing by experiment—all part of the studying for these
students who some day will be leading doctors.

GROUND BREAKING CEREMONIES mark the beginning
of the School of l\Iedicine’s new medical center, the
most extensive building program in the ﬁeld of medicine
since the turn of the century.

Advanced research, improved curriculum, and added
facilities for practical application of medical training
will stem from this expansion program.

The aim of the School of Medicine is to prepare the
student for a practice of medicine proﬁtable both to
himself as a doctor and society as a whole The embryo
medic is trained in the techniques of the latest develop
ments in the ﬁeld, learning the scientiﬁc principles un-
derlying normal and abnormal functioning. He is trained

in the physics and chemistry of human life, and the
application of sound scientiﬁc methods of treatment.

The prospective practitioner is also taught the cor-
rect physician-patient relationship, his responsibility to
himself, to his patient, to his fellow practitioner. He is
made to realize his duty in the support of the highest

standards of the profession. He is trained to be com-
pletely worthy of the high esteem with which his pa-
tients and neighbors will look upon him.

In keeping with the good work of the med school,
and the new plans for'the Medical Center, many grants
such as the Mental Health Grant and the National
Cancer Institute Grant were given to the University.

Dr. William S. l\IcEllroy is the man to whom the
medics turn for advice and counsel. Dr. McEllroy’s task
is one that entails a maze of responsibility, conscien-
tiousness, and ordinary hard work.

The School of Medicine aims to improve, through
this building and expansion program, the standards of
the medical curriculum which are already sufficiently
high to warrant the school’s being universally acclaimed
as one of the nation’s best. Under the expanded curric-
ulum, there will be greater facilities for research in the
medical- sciences. The school will be able to surpass
even its present high standards of scholarship.

NURSES FIND THEIR HOME, as tlfe School of Nursing
expands its center of nursing education with the build-
ing of a new residence.

VVomen in the Nursing School gain actual experi-
ence with patients in hospitals as a part of their daily
study. This work, combined with a certain number of
hours of study, completes their nursing education.

Practical education in nursing science and nursing
education is open to the student. Following this train-
ing, nursing students may go on for degrees in special-
ized ﬁelds of nursing such as pediatrics, obstetrics, and
operating room technique.

Although one of the most recently founded of the
University schools, the School of Nursing ranks with
leading schools much older than its eleven years of
existence. Through high standards of scholarship, abil-
ity, and character, the School each year graduates
some of the nation’s ﬁnest nurses.

With the great strides of our building campaign,
the nurses will also beneﬁt by various new buildings in

which to live and study.

Dean Ruth Perkins Kuehn leads the girls in white
through their difficult course, making them as happy
and comfortable as she can. Her students never lose
contact with the actual situations for which their train-
ing will ﬁt them to handle. For example, student nurses
at l\'Iagee, Eye and Ear, and Presbyterian Hospitals
now live in l\Iagee Hall, while nurses at Children’s
and Western Psychiatric Hospitals live directly on the
premises of their respective training grounds.

When the new nurses’ home is completed, no doubt
many of the resident student nurses will be transferred
to this residence; the move, however, will have no real
effect on the actual on-call training of the student
nurses due to the convenient location of the planned
Nursing home. It will stand directly behind Falk Clinic
in the midst of what eventually will be the ﬁnest muni-
cipal medical center in the country. Until then, the
School of Nursing will continue to turn out some of the
most capable nurses in the nation.

lVIayor Lawrence and A. M. Scaife speak to Dean R. P. Kuehn,
Dean of Nursing School.

SCHOOL OF PHARMACY

THIS YEAR THE SCHOOL or PHARMACY began its long
trek from—the bluff overlooking the Monongahela to
the University campus. Although the School of Phar-
macy has been in conjunction with the University since
1896, it is only in the last two years that it has been an
actual part of the University. As a result, Pharmacy
school has begun scheduling classes in the Cathedral.

The future pharmacists are--until the building pro-
gram gets started—somewhat isolated in their red brick
Boulevard of the Allies home. Here they work, study,
and experiment through their four year course.

The pharmacy students are people being equipped
with the proper background for successful careers in
their profession. In their school, there are laboratories
for practical training and ﬁrst-hand research and a
library of about 4,000 volumes which contain instruc-
tional material of special interest to pharmacists. Here,
too, the students have an association that brings them
in contact with the problems of the pharmacist in the
outside World.

Pic. on page 130:
The present home of the School of Pharmacy.

The American Pharmaceutical Association has a
local student branch, directed entirely by students,
which sponsors seminars, speakers, and also social
affairs to relieve the burden of long hours of intensive
study and laboratory work.

Directing all this activity is a well-trained pro-
fessional staff headed by Dr. Edward C. Reif, dean of
the School of Pharmacy and a member of its faculty.

On the extra-curricular side, Pharmacy students
this year took a major step toward becoming recognized
members of the University student body when they
won representation on both Men’s Council and Student
Congress.

This was made possible by the increasing tendency
of pharmacy students to mingle with students from the
other schools in all-campus affairs in spite of the physical
separation of the present pharmacy building from the
Cathedral campus.

If this trend continues, it should take the irony out
of the old cry, “Pharmacists are Pitt students, too!”

 

In a pharmacy lab, Gaunt works, while Danti and Johnson
check procedure.

WITH BUSINESS ON THE UP-GRADE, graduates from the
Research Bureau for Retail Training can, for the ﬁrst
time since the war, deal with a normal balance of supply
and demand.

Founded in 1918, the Bureau has become widely
known throughout the country. The graduate school of

search division makes various studies at the request of
Pittsburgh stores.

The Bureau’s one—year graduate course prepares
students for responsible executive positions in buying,
advertising, fashion, and personnel. In addition to class-
room work, the students get experience doing practical
work for the downtown stores and also get paid for it.

The Director of the Research Bureau is Professor
Bishop Brown. Director Brown has been associated with
the Bureau since 1929, and has been its Director since
1936. In this capacity, he has been ahelp and inspiration
to his students who come from all parts of the country in
order to attend this unique school.

1949-50 The YearThat: . ..

Pitt took sturdy steps

toward a new half—century of progress,

from blue—printed dreams emerged concrete realities.
Pitt started

on the road to a

revived spirit in campus life:

from VA regulations evolved blue and gold dinks;
Pitt’s Golden Panthers gleamed again,

from a discouraged eleven

developed victorious All-Americans.

Pitt, in spite of

material changes, held simple intangibles constant:
the pride of new friends and the satisfaction of ‘old,
the Warmth of

a job well done

and the challenge of a job to do,

the carefree romance

of Spring on the Cathedral lawn ,

and the spiritual humility of

 Christmas in the Commons Room.

STUDENT CONGRESS

 

Fl a Diemert President
or ’

UNDER the capable leadership of the ﬁrst woman President, Flora
Diemert, the 1949-50 Student Congress made great strides in expand-
ing its activities to include every type of student attending the Uni-
versity.

Several new committees were established this past year through
the efforts of a hardworking Congress composed of six women and
eleven men. Realizing that the problems of foreign students are many
and varied, Congress set up a Foreign Student Committee late last
fall. The success of the high school day at the Ohio State game fol-
lowed by a dance at Syria Mosque led to the establishment of a per-
manent High School Relations Committee. Student-Faculty Blennds,
initiated by Phyllis Beck and her Faculty Relations Committee,
were highly successful.

The entire student body was given an opportunity to air its
views and to give constructive criticism on any phase of student life
by means of suggestion boxes placed at stratetic points in the Cathed-
ral, Ellsworth Center, Pharmacy, and Engineering Schools.

Dave Fox with the help of his Assemblies Committee contacted
speakers who were of interest to the student body. One of the inno-
vations brought about by this committee was the showing of foreign
ﬁlms and re-issues of all time favorites in Stephen Foster Memorial.

THE Social Committee, under the direction of Dave
Cleland, staged one of the most successful dances, “The
Grand Finale,” after the Penn State game. This com-
mittee also published a book of social rules to be ob-
served by organizations planning social functions.
Carrying out the wish of the previous Congress to
appoint non-Congress members to head committees
in order to give willing students an opportunity to work
for the betterment of the University, the 1949-50 Con-
gress elected Bob Peary chairman of the Pitt Chest Drive
and authorized him to investigate additional means of
fulﬁlling the fund quota. Dario Icardi was chosen to
represent the student body at the University Athletic

MEN’s Council worked during 1949-50 to set up a more effective
traditions and customs program for freshmen. Aiming to acquaint
the new students with the University, Pitt traditions, and extra-
curricular activities, Council expanded the old plan for welcoming
men.

The “dink” came back to the campus as a means of recognizing
freshmen. Orientation classes, in charge of selected upperclass-
men, met for six weeks. At the end of this time, a customs exam-
ination was given. A high score on the test together with a recom-
mendation from the counselor made the freshman eligible for a
Panther Key, which was awarded at a formal ceremony in the
Commons Room.

Cooperating with the Traditions and Customs Committees,
the Social Committee sponsored mixer dances. Early in the Fall
semester, Council invited freshmen to attend a smoker at Stephen
Foster l\Iemorial where they met representatives of campus activi-
ties.

The main objective of Men’s Council was closer unity with
all the campus organizations, with which Council cooperated
to carry out a very successful program.

Officers for the year were: president, Howard Greenberger;

vice-president, Dozia Frazier; secretary, Tom Burkhart; treasurer,
Earl Jacob. ‘

ELLSWORTH CENTER, or boy’s town, as it’s often called, is an
extension of the main campus. At ﬁrst, Ellsworth boys took
little or no part in University activities, but the organization
of a student council coordinated the interests of Center stu-
dents with those of students on campus and made Ellsworth
a real part of Pitt.

The Council has grown from a volunteer committee
organized in 1947 to a student governing body which is
rapidly gaining prominence among University organizations.
Fourteen men represent Ellsworth students both at the
center and on campus. This council considers problems at
the center and acts as a governing as well as a coordinating
body.

Although they take part in all University activities,
the boys at Ellsworth have a social program of their own.
Major social events scheduled by the appointments com-
mittee of the student council included three ballroom dances
and a picnic. A permanent social committee held three tuck
shop parties and two matinee dances.

Ellsworth boys were active in Spring Festival, freshman
orientation counseling, and the Pitt Chest drive. Exclusive
center activities were weekly movies, coed luncheons, a
discussion group, and a center glee club.

THE purpose of the Engineering and l\Iines Associ-
ation Cabinet is to create a closer fellowship
among the engineering and mines students, to
provide opportunities for contact with professional
and non-professional men, and to add to the social
life of the Schools of Engineering and Mines.

This year the E and M Association, under
the leadership of its cabinet, advanced another
step in bringing the engineers “down from the
hill.” The Association set up a display at the
freshman smoker and took an active part in
Spring Festival. ~

At State Hall, the Cabinet installed several
vending machines, and equipped the student
lounge with decks of cards, magazines and a radio.
Vending machines were also installed in Thaw
Hall and Automotive Hall near the stadium.

Highlights of a varied social calendar in-
cluded a summer picnic at North Park, a “Monte
Carlo” night smoker, and two dances. A familiar
sight at all the football games and rallies this
year was the E and IVI jalopy, purchased by the
N_ Law; Prof_ Rudoy (Adviser); J. Association and kept in running condition by

Hunt J. Ritcey; R. Jim; J. Perkins; L. members-

ENGINEERING and Mines Association revived the Out-
standing Senior Award this year. Each semester the Assoc-
iation awards a plaque to one senior in either the School
of Engineering or the School of Mines, who is chosen by his
fellow students and a faculty committee on the basis of
leadership, scholarship, activities, and personality. Nick
Laux, a former president of E and M Cabinet, received this
award at the close of the Fall semester.

To inform the students about the work of the Cabinet
the Association published a small newspaper, the Nitt
Pews containing news of Cabinet meetings and social
events.

A large measure of the success of the E and M Associ-
ation is due to the guidance of the Cabinet advisors, Pro-
fessor William Rudoy and William Saalbach.

Oﬁicers for the Fall semester were: president, I. Laux,
vice president, L. Eisenhauer; secretary, R. Cicero; treas-
urer, J. Ritcey.

Officers for the Spring semester were: president, A. J.

THE Women’s Self Government Association is the women’s
method of fostering loyalty, fellowship and activities
throughout the campus. WSGA is a well-organized demo-
cratic government, true to its name, and unique among
other similar campus organizations. It is unique in the
spirit of friendship and cooperation symbolized by WSGA’s
success in enriching the campus life of women students at
Pitt.

Commission of WSGA, composed of the elected oﬂi—
cers, chairmen of the standing committees, Senior Court,
and the representatives elected by other w0men’s organi-
zations on campus, co-ordinates women’s activities and
determines organization policy for WSGA.

Working toward many goals at one time, WSGA has
at its disposal eleven standing committees of about one
hundred women to direct specialized student activities.
The Activities Committee studies activities and attempts
to place women on committees paralleling their interests;
the Customs Committee makes freshmen feel at home
during their ﬁrst few weeks at Pitt; the High School Re-

ing the most successful tea dances at Pitt with the Goal
Post Gallop on November 4:, a Worthy successor to the
now-famous April Showers Tea Dance sponsored by the
Class the year before.

Inter—Class Sing in January was another memorable
day in the history of a hardworking class which also found
time to furnish more senior mentors than any other class
in the history of Pitt. In the Spring, the seniors continued
a tradition established in wise sophomore days, and let
their hair down at an old fashioned barn dance.

ALPHA PHI OMEGA, Pitt’s only service fraternity, has been
serving the University faithfully since it was founded in
19925. Belonging to a family of two hundred chapters,
Pitt’s Beta Chapter was the second formed in the United
States.

Since its reactivation after a quiet war-time existence,
the Beta Chapter has been taking part in more activities
than ever before. These include the conducting of all
student elections, working under the direction of the Dean
of Men in Freshman VVeek, ushering at commencemnt,
proctoring of exams, and working at the Graduate Record
Examinations.

During Spring Festival, members of Alpha Phi Omega
handled the refreshment concession to earn funds for their
social program. This program was dotted with many gala
aﬁairsz Fall hayride, the annual banquet in December, and
a Spring picnic.

ACTIVATED last year for the ﬁrst time since 1946, Druids
made rapid strides to gain the prominent position they
had held formerly on campus. The main purpose of this
honorary fraternity is to stimulate interest in campus
scholarship and activities and to foster and recognize
outstanding contributions in these ﬁelds.

Druids took an active part in Tap Day, Spring Festi-
val, and the Freshman smokers. Members served as ushers,
upper-class counselors, freshman camp counselors, and
Student Fund speakers. In addition to this, Druids ap-
pointed a committee to welcome students from other col-
leges who were visiting on campus for intercollegiate
competition.

Membership in Druids is open to sophomore and
junior men outstanding in activities. In addition to active
members, Druids tapped to honorary membership three
faculty men who “had done the most to stimulate student
participation in activities.” These men were Edwin J.
McIntosh, Lester G. Brailey, and William F. Saalbach.

Ofﬁcers for the year were: president, Harry L. Green;
vice president, Donald Ewart; Secretary-treasurer, Roy

CWENS taps to membership sophomore women who are
outstanding in scholarship and activities. From the day
that she is initiated, each girl becomes aware of the honor
that has been bestowed on her, the beautiful ritual, and
the crown and scepter pin which binds her to the other
Cwens. Alpha chapter serves the University by fostering
Pitt ideals among all sophomore women.

i This year, the Cwens had many service projects. They
were aides at University functions, Nationality Room
hostesses, ushers at chapel services, assistants to the ad-
Visors of freshmen guilds, and publishers of the Cwen
Directory, which lists the names and addresses of all the
women at Pitt. For their special project members compiled
an alumnae card ﬁle of Pitt Cwens for the national board.

During the year, the group held a tea for the national
president, a Christmas party, a picnic, joined Mortar
Board for a party, and entertained the Tech and Seton
Hill chapters.

DELTA DELTA LAMBDA, honorary business education fra-
ternity is named in honor of Dr. Daniel Lessenberry, pro-
fessor and instructor of courses in business education. Its
purpose is the recognition and encouragement of outstand-
ing scholarship in business education.

The fraternity was established in 1934 when junior
and senior students in the business education department
realized the need for an organization which would unite
them in the furtherance of ﬁne scholarship and leadership
in their ﬁeld. On March 2, 1935, Delta Delta Lambda be-
came an officially recognized fraternity at the University
of Pittsburgh.

In the past year, Delta Delta Lambda had a full and
interesting program of activities. At each monthly business
meeting an outstanding leader in business education was
introduced. During both the fall and spring semesters,
rushing parties and initiation dinner-dances provided en-
tertainment. A picnic with Kappa Phi Kappa and a fare-
well party rounded out the year’s social events,

The oﬂicers for the year were: president, Donald
Irwin; Vice president, Thoburn Dunlap; secretary, Ru-
dolph Ivancic; and treasurer, Constance Lucas.

TAU Chapter of Kappa Phi Kappa, national honorary
education fraternity for men, has been active on Pitt’s
campus since 1926. The ﬁrst chapter Alpha, was founded
in 1992 at Dartmouth College. Since then, the fraternity
has expanded until there are now ﬁfty-three chapters
throughout the country. Social activities, scholastic at-
tainment, professional ideals—are the goals toward which
Kappa Phi Kappa works.

Under the guidance of their sponsor, Mr. George W.
Hoffman, Tau Chapter has enjoyed an active year. At
the annual fall smoker, one hundred and twenty men were
feted; thirty-eight of these men were initiated in Decem-
ber, 1949, at a formal banquet held at the Penn-Shady
Hotel. For the ﬁrst time since its reactivation in 1947, the
Chapter held a spring initiation. Thirty-ﬁve members
were accepted. The year ended with the annual successful
Spring picnic at North Park.

Officers for the year were: president, Walter M. Sny-
der; vice president, Roger McGill; secretary, Francis W.

OUTSTANDING seniors from every phase of activities for
women came together in this year’s chapter of the national
honorary, Mortar Board. Bound together by a common
desire to render service, to honor learning, and to foster a
quality of leadership, the members planned their program
for the year.

In almost every instance, the serious business of the
organization was lightened by the informality and divers-
ity of the meetings. A few weeks before Christmas, old
shirts and dresses were stitched into animals for the young-
sters at Children’s Hospital. Spring brought the tradi-
tional recognition of outstanding scholarship among fresh-
man women on Scholar’s Day, and ﬁnally the tapping
and initiation of new members.

PHI ETA SIGMA, national honorary fraternity for men, was
established in 19Q3. In 1937, Dr. Vincent Lanfear, then
Dean of Men, seeing the need of fostering a high degree
of scholarship among freshmen men, organized the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh chapter. Although a rigid standard
is required of pledges, the chapter has grown to nearly one-
hundred active members.

The main activity of Phi Eta Sigma is aiding and
inspiring others in study. At registration, freshmen men
receive a small manual entitled, “How to Study,” which
serves as a useful guide throughout the college years. A
free tutoring program is offered to freshmen men the last
six weeks of each semester. During the 1948-49 semesters,
ninety per cent of those men tutored by Phi Eta Sigma
instructors received passing grades. The fraternity also
supports the memorial fund established in honor of its
founder, Thomas Arkle Clark.

Officers for the year were: president, Robert M. Crum;
vice president, Richard Volk; secretary, Walter Leskowat;
treasurer, Donald Murray; faculty advisor, E. J. McIntosh.

spread scholarship, culture, and idealism . . . always striv-
ing by all sound methods to stimulate serious thought and
true intellectual standards.”

THE year 1950 marks the thirtieth anniversary of Alpha
Zeta Omega and the twenty-ﬁrst birthday of the Pitt
chapter. Founded by pharmacy students, AZO is a phar-
maceutical fraternity for men which combines both the
professional and social aspects of fraternalism.

Alpha Zeta Omeba requires a one point ﬁve average
for membership. Every prospective member’s qualiﬁca-
tions are reviewed by Dr. Edmund C. Reif, Dean of the
School of Pharmacy and a brother AZO.

Members have an opportunity to meet and know the
rushees at a series of informal affairs. Following the pledge
period, the big social event of the year was a formal din-
ner dance and in the Fall, AZO held its annual barn dance.
Both graduate and under—graduate members, their wives,
and dates had an opportunity to renew old acquaintances
and make new ones.

Professional seminars, speeches by leaders in the prac-
tice of pharmacy and informal discussion groups were
balanced by a Varied list of social activities.

Oﬂicers for the year were: directorum, William Block-
stein; sub directorum, Bernard Danenberg; signore, Jack
Fireman; exheque, Bernard Marks; corresponding signore,
Edward Richold, bellarum, Larry Volk.

THE purpose behind the organization of Delta Sigma
Delta is to maintain the high standards of dentistry,
by inspiring in its men a spirit of real fraternal co-
operation toward scientiﬁc, ethical, and professional
progress in the ﬁeld of dentistry. Since its founding
at the University of Michigan in 1883, Delta Sigma
Delta has developed into the oldest and largest den-
tal fraternity in the world. Sigma Chapter of Pitts-
burgh was chartered in 1903.

Not all is scholastic with the Delta Sigs, however.
This year they played hosts to ﬁve other chapters
for the annual Mid—Eastern Conclave. There was a
full Fall and Spring calendar of social events— a
Christmas dance, a Valentine dance, and an annual
Spring formal.

Delta Sigma Delta has also had an active and suc-
cessful year in sports. The intramural football team
attained third place in the ﬁnals and the basketball
team made an excellent record for itself, as did the
ping pong and softball teams.

Officers for the year were: president, Joseph
Mohney; vice president, Joseph Greer; secretary,
Thomas Delahanty; treasurer, William Cogar.

active at Pitt and today it joins thirty-four collegiate
chapters in advancing professionalism and fraternalism,
making Kappa Psi one of the largest professional frater-
nities in the United States.

This past year has been a successful one for the Beta
Kappa Chapter. The Province II Convention held in
Pittsburgh in October, .1949, with its discussions and
speeches on currentitopics by Dr. E. C. Reif, Dean of the
School of Pharmacy,» and Dr. Edward P. Claus, Faculty
Advisor, will be remembered along with the Miami Foot-
ball game and the dinner which followed. Beta Chapter has

dental fraternity, has existed to afford its members
advantages, assistance, and beneﬁts both academic
and social, beyond the scope of individual attainment.
Through the efforts of its Supreme Council, thirty-
three active and numerous alumni chapters, and a
national publication, The F rater, Psi Omega exerts
its inﬂuence unceasingly toward the advancement of
the profession in new methods of teaching, practice,
and research.

Social activity for such a large group was diverse
and frequent this year with parties, dances, and pic-
nics from early fall until the Senior Formal in June.
Highlight of the sport year was the winning of the
intramural football championship of the University,
with a subsequent victory over the Tech champions.

SIGMA BETA SIGMA, whose Alpha Chapter is located at
the University of Pittsburgh, was the ﬁrst professional
engineering fraternity in the United States to have a
university aﬂiliation. It is a ﬁrst class corporation, in-
corporated ‘on May 8, 1928, under the corporation laws
of Pennsylvania.

The University chapter has approximately two
hundred and ﬁfty members, most of whom are execu-
tives or technical specialists of leading corporations.
Some are members of the Pitt engineering faculty.

Professional engineers, engineers—in-training, grad-
uate engineers and engineering undergraduates with
proper scholarship are considered for membership.

The purpose of Sigma Beta Sigma is to foster pro-
fessional engineering and all that the term implies.

Stated meetings are held on the third Friday of each
month except during July and August. At these meet-
ings outstanding engineers or specialists in related fields
give technical lectures. Engineering facility inspections
are made as conditions warrant.

During the past year members heard lectures given
by Mr. John M. Rice, a member of the State Board of

204

Professional Engineers; Mr. R. Conrad Cooper, Vice
President of the United States Steel Corporation, who
is a member; Colonel John H. Dodds, U. S. Army in
charge of ﬂood control for the Tri-State area, who is
also a member; Admiral Ben Moreell, president of the
Jones and Laughlin Steel corporation; Dr. R.A. Powell,
Associate Manager of Research, Koppers Company;
and others of similar note.

Social activities of the fraternity included corn
roasts, bowling parties, picnics and dances.

Honorary members are: R. Conrad Cooper; Dr. E.
Allen Holbrook, Dean of the School of Engineering; Col.
John H. Dodds; Robert Gorham, School of Engineering
faculty; Carroll F. Reynolds, Assistant Director, Ex-
tension Division, University of Pittsburgh.

Officers for the year were: president, Paul W.
Echard; vice president, John C. Hugo; secretary, Edgar
L. Landerman; treasurer, John A. Groll; recording sec-
retary, George Costantino. Members of the board were:
Herbert J. Smith; Ludwig Adams; J. Albert Bircher;

STUDENT FACULTY NURSING

First row: P. Titzel; M. Avery (adviser); V. Price; J. Mackie. Second row: M. Anderson; J. Hill; P. Keefe (advisor).

THROUGHOUT the past year, the Student-Faculty Nurs-
ing Association directed the activities program of the
basic professional students in the School of Nursing.

The program was planned through the joint action
of the various standing committees. Under SFNA direc-
tion, the Housing Board was active in formulating sev-
eral new policies regulating group living within the
residences. In the same way, the Traditions Committee
sponsored numerous social and professional functions.

Of these, the “holiday parties,” especially those
associated with Halloween, Christmas, and St. Patrick’s
Day were favored events.

Interspersed throughout the social program were
the time honored traditions. In January, Capping, a
particularly signiﬁcant tradition for nurses, was held
for the Class of 1952. The J unior-Senior Banquet honor-
ing the graduating seniors was held in April, and in May
Blackbanding honored the new seniors. Also during
this month the student body took part in the annual
Florence Nightingale Memorial Service held in Heinz
Chapel. Pinning, the ﬁnal traditional ceremony for the
graduating seniors, was held in June.

Aside from these traditional social events were
special affairs for SFNA members. In November, in
response to an invitation from Idaka (the pre-nursing
sorority), selected representatives of SFNA attended a
coke party given for the freshman pre-nursing students.
This meeting provided opportunity for pre-nursing
students to secure information concerning the clinical
phase of the program directly from the student nurses.
Even more important, it provided the future nurses
with an opportunity to model the School cap.

In December, student members of SFNA were
hostesses to the faculty and staff of the School of Nurs-
ing at a tea and social hour at Magee Hall. The tea
followed a regularly scheduled faculty-staff meeting to
which the student body was invited.

Cooperative planning for the Student-Faculty
Nursing Association activities program (recognized as
an integral part of the over-all program) served to
bring about mutual understanding of common prob-
lems. Officers for the year were: president, Virginia
Price; vice president, Joanne Hill; secretary-treasurer,
Pauline Titzel; faculty advisor, Mary Edna Williams.

STUDENT CHRISTIAN

The SCF Center is opened, after many hours of planning and work.

THE Student Christian Federation, an organization of
students from the religious groups at Pitt, strives to further
understanding and cooperation among the aﬁiliated Chris—
tian movement groups. Representatives to this council
come from the seven local Christian organizations—Can-
terbury Club, the Lutheran Student Association, the
Methodist Student Association, the Pitkin Club, the
Westminster Foundation, the Roger Williams Fellowship,
and the YMCA and YWCA.

The local groups tend to contribute a great deal to-
ward rounding out the college life of Pitt men and Women.
Individually, for example, the Canterbury Club includes
in its program Holy Communion and breakfast, and Sun-
day night supper meetings and discussions.

The great concern of all these groups is the University
students’ relationship with the Church. The Methodist
Student Group brings a wide variety of topics and speak-
ers to their student members. The Pitkin Club is a large
group composed of students of Presbyterian aﬁiliation who
are interested in the discussion of religious problems.

The officers Were: president, Richard Campbell;
vice-president, James Say; secretary, Patsy Moll; corre-
sponding secretary, Jean Curran; and treasurer, Mary
Jane Murdoch.

THIS year the University of Pittsburgh branch of the
Young Women’s Christian Association built a sound work-
ing program based on four separate commissions.

The first commission, Christian Faith and Heritage,
was invaluable in bringing Religion-In-Life to the student
body. Personal and Campus Affairs, the second commission,
planned Caritas, a YWCA program which introduces all
freshman Women to Heinz Memorial Chapel.

YW oﬂered its services to the Community through
its third commission, Social Responsibility. Such institu-
tions as the Juvenile Detention Home, the Children’s
Hospital and the Y-Teen groups received the aid of the
Pitt group.

Twenty-two Pitt students became seriously conscious
of the international relationships in today’s world when
YWCA’s fourth commission, World Relatedness, spon-
sored a trip to the UN.

The officers were: president, Lois Hager; Vice presi-
dent, Marion Ford; secretary, Lois Howe; treasurer, Vir-
ginia Fansler; WSGA representative, Margaret Metzel.

THE PITT YMCA is an open fellowship of men interested
in discovering, understanding, and appreciating the high-
est ideal of creative Christian living and service. It strives
to apply these ideals to life on the campus. Mr. Alfred
C. Payne stresses that the “Y’s” chief purpose is to
build Christian leaders, and that this leadership can be
gained best through actual practice.

This year’s program began with Freshman Camp at
Camp Kon-O-Kwee, a pre-school program designed to
guide ﬁrst year men into the pattern of Pitt’s academic and
extra curricular life.

The Pitt “Y” program is controlled by a Committee
of Management, composed of students, faculty, and ad-
ministration representatives. Cabinet consists of student
leaders in charge of the over all program and operates
through four general commissions: Christian Heritage,
VVorld Relatedness, Social Responsibility, and Personal
and Campus Affairs.

Q20

THE office of the 1950 OWL on the eighth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral might well be called “Memory Lane,” for this
year the theme of the OWL was “The Story of the Year.”
Renee Friedman, editor, Bob Fuhr, assistant editor, and
Bob Rossel, business manager, set out early in the summer
to incorporate in one big book all the joy, excitement,
heartbreak, and satisfaction of a year at Pitt.

Starting with the sending of a circular to every
junior and senior student, the OWL publicity campaign
got under way: While the student body was on Vacation,
the editors got together to plan for a new cover, new
photographer, new printer, new modern printing process,
and a new staff to put out the permanent record of the
year 1949-1950.

This year marked the ﬁrst time that OWL’S were
sold at registration. Publicity continued with Mr. and
Mrs. Owl at the football games and with coupons in the
Panther. With the return of the students to school,
production got underway and assignments were handed
out to new staff members. By the time of the Owl party
in the fall, all assignments were being covered.

In this year’s OWL, special attention was paid to the
undergraduate schools and the professional schools by the
inclusion of informal pictures. The informal pictures
added reality to the organization pages too. The ’5O OWL
continued its Hall of Fame awards, its IF Sweetheart
pages, and its complete coverage of IF, Panhellenic, and
Student Congress social affairs. Something new was added
with Ken Schwartz’s very clever art work and the double
index under the direction of Audrey Recht.

In the years to come, the circulation of 2200 can sit
back in their easy chairs, open a 1950 OWL, and read the
“Story of the Year.”

THE year 1949-1950 found the Panther with a new face
and several new faces in the Panther office. The former was
due to the installation of the vari-typing process used for
the ﬁrst time on the Pitt humor magazine.

As for the new faces in the Panther office with the
exception of Don Horowitz and Bob McKowen everyone
was a novice at the art of turning out the Panther. This
resulted in a freshness which showed itself in the circula-
tion records for the year ’49-’50.

By experimenting with the ﬁrst few issues, the “Gurr”
and “Cold Turkey” issues, the staffers got a pretty fair
idea of what their subscribers wanted in 3. humor magazine.
Especially clever was the “Life” issue, a take-olﬁ’ on the
national magazine of the same name. And will the Pitt
News ever forget the joke played in the April Fool issue!
Judging from the Panther’s increased circulation and the
greater amount of advertising on its pages, the Business
Staff under Ralph Douglas took advantage of the avid
interest of the student body in smashing all existing rec-
ords.

Another innovation which might have helped the
Panther to its ﬁnest year was the awarding of a gold cup
to the sorority which sold the most Panthers and the
awarding of a twenty-ﬁve dollar War bond to the individ-
ual with the greatest selling power.

If, as Editor Bob McKowen says, the purpose of the
Panther is to “give the kids what they want,” this year’s
Panther succeeded very well; for the atmosphere of the
Panther office is real college, and with background like
this, how can the Panther go wrong. ?

THE CHANCELLOR

CHANCELLOR RUFUS H. FI'rzGERALD’s one sorrow is that he has so little time to
spend with the students of the University; as busy as he is, however, he has managed
to establish a feeling of interest and awareness in the Student Body that is quite
phenomenal considering the great number of undergraduates enrolled in the Uni-
versity. This feeling of mutual admiration, perhaps comradeship, between the
Chancellor and the Student Body can probably best be attributed to the Fireside
Chats, special teas, Mentor-Counselor Dinner, football rallies, and Chancellor’s
Reception; for Wherever and whenever Chancellor Fitzgerald has an opportunity
to meet a student, the occasion is marked with friendliness, quiet charm, a warm
smile, and a ﬁrm handshake.

Although each passing year brings him a new responsibility as the leader of a
great University, this year has probably been one of the most difficult and tiring
for the Chancellor because of the building program. Actually, Dr. Fitzgerald is per-
haps the busiest and hardest working member of the campaign. He has taken trips
to other colleges and universities to compare their buildings with our plans so that
nothing may be overlooked which might beneﬁt his students.

One occasion this year shows typically Dr. F itzgerald’s tireless energy and
boundless appreciation of the Student Body. At Open House, after standing in the
Commons Room receiving line for hours, Dr. Fitzgerald took time to thank every
student aide personally before he himself took time out for dinner.

The Student Body is truly proud of its Chancellor; and it can be sure that its

pride and faith in him is returned with sincerity and graciousness.

UNDER Editor Donald “Doc” Gifﬁn, the 1949-1950
Pitt News received a thorough face-lifting. The neW
offset system was instrumental in accomplishing this
new look, for with this process came sharper, better
pictures, a new face for" the paper, and clearer banners.
The best part of this innovation was that it made it
possible for everything but the actual printing to be
done right in the Pitt News oﬁice

' This year, the Pitt News was handled by a very
competent staﬂ’ of experienced workers among whom
were Donald Gifﬁn, editor; Budd Schulberg, business
manager; Dick Kovar, managing editor; and Myron
Kopelman, sports editor. The Pitt News also continued
its cooperation with the journalism department of the

F. VVeis; C. Berney; F. Siegal.

College by printing worthwhile articles written by the
students in journalism.

One of the most exciting events of the year, per-
haps, was the last minute coverage of the Pitt West-
minster basketball game. It was the ﬁrst time that a
Thursday night story appeared in the Friday Pitt News.
Although many of the staff stayed up all night to ac-
complish this feat, they agree it was worth it for real
job experience. _

The real purpose of the Pitt News, however, is to
turn out a newspaper, and what they hope is a good
newspaper, for the University Student Body. Judging
from the noontime rush on Tuesdays and Fridays for
the stacks of Pitt News the staff has fulﬁlled their pur-
pose.

EVERY Sunday afternoon at 4:00 P.M. and VVednesday
at 1:00 P.M. the Heinz Chapel Choir dons velvet robes
of royal purple and marches down the aisle at Heinz
Chapel to the accompaniment of Fred Lotz, university
organist. The choir is composed of undergraduate
students of the University who enjoy singing sacred
music. Responsible for the choir is the amiable and able
director Dr. Theodore M. “Pop” Finney.

The choir was formed primarily to sing for services
in the Heinz Memorial Chapel, but in the eleven years
of its existence it has grown to be one of the well known
singing groups in this part of the country. Under the
direction of “Pop” Finney, who started the choir in
1938, activities have increased from singing for chapel
services to include such things as concerts at churches
throughout the year, a spring concert tour in this sec-
tion of the country, Caroling at Christmas, and singing
at Christmas, and singing at special functions held in
the Commons Room.

In addition to the regularly scheduled events
members ﬁnd time to have an annual Christmas ban-
quet, held this year at the Twentieth Century Club, a
spring picnic, and many other social events.

PITT Singers, once the smallest choral organization on
campus, has matured into a full group of ﬁfty. Directed
by Dr. Theodore“Pop” Finney, during 1949—50, Singers
had their best year to date.

The ﬁrst singing appearance in the Commons Room
for the Thanksgiving Tea was followed by an hour of
singing at Open House. Singers added much in the way
of harmony at the December Student-Faculty Blend.
December meant carols and the Singers gathered at
the organ during Christmas week to foster the holiday
spirit. Commons Room Council recognized the Singers
by holding a special Coffee and Donuts party for them.

But with all this singing, Pitt Singers still found
time for socials in the line of barn dances, picnics, and
parties. Since the group liked to sing so much, all of
the parties ended as four hour song fests. The last event
on the Singers’ schedule was the annual banquet where
keys were awarded for two years of loyal service to the
organization.

Oﬁicers were: president, Robert Ziegler; vice
president, Jack Wilson; secretary, Hope Ruma; Business
managers, John Sweeny and George Biggs.

WOMEN’S CHORAL

Third row: G. Hertz; A. Iglar; S. Levine; P. Bartirome; L. MacDonald; I. Fusco; B. Hill.

WoMEN’s CHORAL sang through another harmonious
season this year. With a somewhat smaller group
than usual, thirty members, the girls had a great
deal of enjoyment out of their music.

The ﬁrst program of the year was the annual
Beaux Arts program Where Choral helped illustrate
“Women in Art.” Following that, the girls sang for
the annual Open House. Naturally, Christmas gave
the opportunities to sing and also have fun with

most of the members gathered around the Commons.

Room organ to sing between classes.

With Christmas behind them, Choral began the
serious rehearsing for the annual Spring Concert at
Stephen Foster Memorial. Then too, the girls had an
excellent time on their annual spring trip. This is
always the high point for the year, for they hop
chartered buses, spend the weekend singing at male
colleges, and generally have the time of their lives.

The last event of the year, was the annual ban-
quet where instead of singing heartily, each girl ate
heartily and, if she had been a member for two years,
took home her gold Women’s Choral key.

Officers for this year were: president, Agnes
Iglar; vice president, Harriet Marsh; secretary,
Shirley Campbell; business manager, Dorothy
Bougher; social chairman, Shirley Levine.

TRYING to equal last year’s achievement of two con-
cert tours was the Glee Club goal this year. It did this
under the leadership of the new director, Colin C.
Sterne. The Glee Club’s ﬁrst performance was at the
Chancellor’s Reception. This was followed by perfor-
mances at Greensburg, the Twentieth Century Club,
the University Open House in the Fall, and and at a
joint affair with Pennsylvania College for Women’s
Choral.

The tours took the men to Chicago, Bowling Green,
New York, Philadelphia, Williamsport, Dubois, Al-
toona, and Ford City. The annual home concert was
held on March 31, at Carnegie Music Hall. At this
concert the Glee Club was joined by the University of
Pittsburgh concert band. On April 6, the Glee Club
joined with Women’s Choral and Pitt Singers for the
annual Choral Festival.

Officers were: president, Joseph Claar; ‘vice presi-
dent, Donald Helms; secretary, Arthur Sears. The
Board of Managers consisted of Henry George, John
Sweeney, Carl Angstrom, William Foster, Richard
Rodgers, James Chrissis, Robert Davis, and Richard
R. Campbell. Robert H. Zeigler was the accompanist.

WITH a nucleus from last year’s Pennsylvania State
champions returning, and a ﬁne turnout of first year
men, Men’s Debate again had a very successful season.

During tlie 1948-49 season the team debated before
audiences of almost twelve thousand while participating
in more than two hundred and lifty debates with ﬁfty-
two schools. This year the number of debates and audi-
ences was still higher as the team visited Cleveland for
the Western Reserve series; Philadelphia, where the
novice team debated; Bowling‘ Green; Chicago; and
Penn State. Teams also participated in all the tourna-
ments at. Pitt and in the surrounding area. Again this
year the high school debate program sponsored by the
Debate Association proved a great. success with over
two hundred and ﬁfty high school debaters taking part.

Director Fred S. Robie did an outstanding job
with all the men on the team. Ottieers were: manager,
Harry Green; assistant manager, Fred D. Purdy;
audience manager, Richard Moskowitz; publicity
manager, William F. Swanson, Jr.; treasurer, Saul
Davis; secretary, Thomas Burkhardt.

THE Women’s Speech Association offered a diverse pro-‘

gram for girls interested in debate, poetry reading, dis-
cussion, and radio.

One of the most active groups Within the organiza-
tion was the debate team which participated in con-
tests at the University of West Virginia and Bowling
Green in Ohio. In March, women debaters, in conjunc-
tion with Men’s Debate, hosted the state convention,
and later that month they attended the Pennsylvania
Debaters’ Convention. at Penn State.

During the year Women’s Speech discussion groups
were heard over WPGH. One of the most interesting
programs was a discussion of the question, “Is Christ-
mas too commercialized?”

An annual project of the Association is the Beaux
Arts Day program to which freshman girls are espe-
cially invited and through which they are introduced
to the ﬁne arts opportunities at the University.

Oﬂicers for the year were: president, Reva Parish;
Vice president, Esther Jacobson; secretary-treasurer,
Kathleen Eyerman.

ates, except freshmen Women, may join. N o dues are
required and active membership is obtained by partici-
pating in acting, business, and technical production.

Harvey J. Pope, faculty advisor to the group,
directs the plays, which are presented in the Stephen
Foster Memorial. The technical directors for this year
were Russell Stand and Robert Prenderville.

“Arsenic and Old Lace,” the lively comedy hit,
was the season’s opener for Players. This was followed
by a period piece, “Caste,” produced in the original
style of the 1870’s. A big advancement was made by
producing Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” which went
on tour and Players broke another precedent by pro-
ducing a co-ed musical, “A Connecticut Yankee,” the
ﬁrst ever to be done at Pitt.

Officers were: president, John Ingrim; vice presi-
dent, George Factor; secretary, Jennie Marshall; busi-

“CASTE,” a comedy of morals and manners of the
nineteenth century was the second offering of
Pitt Players for the 1949-1950 season. The most
popular of T. W. Robertson’s plays when ﬁrst
produced in 1867, it marked the beginning of
modern realism in the theatre. The Players kept
the settings as authentic as possible to acquaint
the student body with the Victorian period; a
painted backdrop characteristic of the late nine-
teenth century was used, and gas lighting was
symbolized.

Barbara Gluck and Lois Ostwind played the
two ballet-dancing sisters, Polly and Esther
Eccles. Jack Coppersmith played George, Esther’s
aristocratic husband, and Harry Kimball played
Sam, the cockney sweetheart of Polly. Roy Titch-
worth had the part of the sister’s father, who was
a little shiftless, a little cynical, and a lot drunk.
Frederick Hill was cast as Captain Hawtree, a
friend of George, and Rosamund Fowler played
the social-conscious Marchioness, mother of
George.

Polly (Barbara Gluck) orders Captain Hawtree (Fred Hill) into the kitchen,
while Esther, Polly’s sister (Lois Ostwind) and George (Jack Coppersmith)

IN Shakespeare’s time, it was said that the “play was the
thing;” Pitt Players’ production of “Julius Caesar” has
proved that it still is. This season, for the ﬁrst time since the
1920’s, Players presented a Shakespearean drama.

Julius Caesar was played by Jack Ingrim, president of
Pitt Players. Melvin Silver enacted the role of Cassius. Dick
Costanza played Brutus, and Jack Schano was cast as Mark
Antony. Ben Tatar was seen as Casca. The three feminine
roles were played by Diane Dimon as Calpurnia, Gloria
Brodie as Lucius, and Elaine Teiﬁeld as Portia.

After a successful run at Stephen Foster Memorial,
“Julius Caesar” went on a week’s road tour.

Cassius (Melvin Silver) offers his dagger to

killed than argue with his best friend.

PORTS
ATHLETICS
DEPARTMENT

WHEN Thomas J. Hamilton left “Captain” and the
United States Navy to become the Director of Athletics
at the University of Pittsburgh, he made some promises
that are slowly rounding into reality. He promised Pitt
students and Pitt alumni the best in athletic opponents,
and a good Pitt team to meet them. So far the ex-Navy
ofﬁcer has done just that. He has scheduled some of the
nation’s best teams for athletic competition.

Another promise the big 6-foot director made was
an expanded intramural program, adequate playing
facilities, and a ﬁeldhouse. These too are coming about,
although very slowly. The lack of suitable playing sites
for IIVI sports is Hamilton’s biggest headache at the
present. _

The new ﬁeldhouse, which would relieve congested
and cramped basketball crowds, is on its way toward
completion.

On top of all this, Hamilton has inaugurated a
new team—the wrestling team. Captain Tom still
hopes to add more sports to his athletic program in an
endeavor to “reach all of the students.”

The paint on the door of the athletic office which
says, “T. J. Hamilton, Director of Athletics,” is only
a year old, but the man inside has already made it
stick.

Captain Tom Hamilton

JUST around the corner from Captain Tom’s oﬂice, is
another door whose paint is old, but just as stickable as
Hamilton’s. It says “Frank Carver, Graduate Manager
of Athletics.”

Frank is an old timer around the athletic office,
and has had his say in Pitt sports for “more years than
I care to remember,” according to Frank himself.

Carver is also the athletic publicist, a post which
he has held for over 16 years. During a brief period
of seven months, following the resignation of Jimmy
Hegan, Carver ﬁlled in as interim director.

Walter S. Milligan

Varsity

WALTER S. (Mike) M1LLIGAN’s career as head coach
saw the caliber of Pitt football rise from its lowest
point to almost the top.

Succeeding Wes Fesler as head coach in 1947,
Milligan and the team had a dismal one win and eight
loss record. In 1948 Milligan’s Panthers won six games,
including a '7-0 upset over previously unbeaten Penn
State, knocking the Lions out of bowl contention.

A duplicate record of 6-3 was posted for 1949. After
the Panthers had beaten the supposedly invincible
Rose Bowl champs, Northwestern, Mike was named
“Coach of the Week” by the United Press.

At the season’s completion, Milligan was nominated
for the Scripps-Howard “Coach of the Year” award.
Along with his All-American guard Bernie Barkouskie,
and nationally—rated Lou Cecconi, Milligan was rec-
ognized with the nation’s best.

Evidently the University Athletic Committee did
not agree, for as plans were being made for the coming

season, Milligan was offered a one-year contract.

Milligan balked, however, feeling that the rugged
schedule for 1951 and the loss of 18 lettermen would
produce only a mediocre record. Mike asked for a
three-year term. When the University refused to leng-
then the first proposal, Milligan resigned.

The hunt was then on to ﬁnd an adequate re-
placement. After about a month of hunting, Athletic
Director Hamilton signed Leonard J. Casanova, a
T-formation coach from Santa Clara University of
California.

Cas, as he is called, brought two assistants with
him, Jack Roche and Herm Meister. Roche and Meister
will coach the backﬁeld and line respectively. Both
came from Santa Clara where they helped Casanova
win the Orange Bowl game on New Year’s day.

With the coming of these three men, an old Pitt
trademark left—the single wing. The T-formation re-
placed the power system that had once placed Pitt
among the best. What the new type of play will bring
is anybody’s guess. But those close to the Pitt football
scene claim that even with the high graduation loss
and the tough schedule, the Panthers of 1951 “will
fool a lot of people.” '

Plrr is back!

The end of the rough, rugged road that pointed in the direction
of big-time, winning football was ﬁnally reached by Pitt’s gridsters
this year.

The road back had been marked with delays, defeats, disgrace,
disgust and discouragement. It had been a period of deemphasis.

Then last year things started to change. Captain Tom Hamilton
was appointed director of athletics. Coach Mike Milligan worked
hard with his team, and a highly respectable record of six wins and
three losses was posted.

So for 1949 the experts predicted that the Pit't star of old would
shine again. Mike would welcome back a strong nucleus of his previ-
ous year’s squad. The forward wall would be formidable. The back-
ﬁeldismall, but experienced and determined.

Some prognosticators believed, however, that an even split of
the season’s games would be a good season. For once again Pitt had a
murderous schedule.

Perhaps one writer summed it up the best when he Wrote: “Not
even the widest-eyed optimists at the gray Cathedral of Learning
expect this outﬁt to suddenly turn on their titanic rivals from the
Big Ten and repay the horrid 40-point indignities recent Panther
teams have suffered. But even the longest-jawed pessimists must
admit that the big clock is ticking, the time is nearing, and that V-Day
may be any tomorrow.”

With the pre-season ratings still ringing in their ears, the nervous
Panthers won their ﬁrst home game since 1944 by defeating William
and Mary, 13-7, before 21,000 fans.

It was a veteran Pitt line that shone in the victory. The hard-
charging forwards, led by Bernie Barkouskie and Nick Bolkavac, kept
the Delta Bowl champs’ rushing to 18 yards. Jack (Flying) Cloud,
All-American fullback threat was held in check, and Lou Creekmuir,
another potential All-American, was just another Indian lineman on
the ﬁeld.

Victorious Panthers, tired but happy over Penn upset,
arrive at Penn. Station.

What happens when an irresist-
ible force meets an immovable
object.

Five good reasons why Jimmy Joe Robinson ran for a touchdown in the Miami of Ohio game-—Geremsky,

Nick DeRosa, who along with Ted Gremesky, had the task of
ﬁlling the famous shoes of Bill McPeak and Leo Skaldany, scored the
ﬁrst Panther touchdown of the season in less than two minutes of
the ﬁrst quarter when he recovered Buddy Lex’s fumble in the end
zone.

The Pitt backﬁeld, which the downtown papers had dubbed the
“pony backﬁeld” because of its size, started its way to a glorious
season. Led by the tricky running of Captain Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi,
and aided by the speed of Jimmy Joe Robinson, the Panthers were
able to rack up a total of 196 net yards rushing. Carl DePasqua, the
pint-sized but hard driving fullback, continued his ﬁne defensive
work from the previous season. The records don’t state it, but Carl’s
pass defense saved many a William and Mary pass completion.

Nick Bolkavac kicked one out of two extra points as the Panthers
started their return back with a 13-7 victory over William and Mary.

It was a good start, but naturally not good enough, according to
Mike Milligan. He had the mighty 1948 Rose Bowl champs, North-
western, to worry about, and the 11 penalties that cost Pitt 75 yards
didn’t case his worry any. “I wish we had more time to iron out a
few things,” the head coach said after the game. “We did a lot of
things wrong; our mistakes almost beat us.”

So Pitt went to Dyche Stadium, an underdog by 20 points. And
they completely outplayed, and outfought the home team, 16-7, to
the dismay of the 41,000 spectators. It was the ﬁrst meeting for the
two schools in football.

In no way was the number one upset of the young 1949 season a
ﬂuke. Pitt was in command all the way. Once again the formidable
Panther line and the defensive work of the secondary squelched any
Wildcat offensive threat until there was only one minute and ﬁve
seconds remaining in the game. Then the tired Panthers allowed Left
Halfback Johnny Miller to race over from the 11.

Again the Panther lineman played havoc on the All-American
hopeful. Art Murakowski, Northwestern linebucker, was held to a
mere 29 yards in 11 tries. In fact, the Wildcats were only able to net
66 yards in their rushing attack, while the Blue and Gold roared for
157. Pitt rolled up 12 ﬁrst downs to 8 for Northwestern.

Once again Bimbo Cecconi and Jimmy Joe Robinson led the Pitt
attack. The Obnnellsville Comet scored both Pitt touchdowns. A
13-yard pass reception from Cecconi in the ﬁrst period and a 12-yard
gallop in the ﬁnal stanza gave Robinson the day’s headlines.

As the Panthers remained unbeaten they ran their string of
victories to four straight, counting the wins over Purdue and Penn
State during the 1948 season. It also marked the ﬁrst time since the
Sutherland regime in 1938 that the Western Conference opponents
were whipped two times in a row.

The Panthers came home from Evanston, were treated to an
enthusiastic, but fairly moderate pep rally, and then started prepara-
tion for their annual foe from the mountains, West Virginia. The game
was to be played in Mountaineer Stadium, the ﬁrst time in 12 years
that a Pitt team visited the hinterlands of West Virginia.

A record crowd of 31,000 fans perspired in the 83-degree tempera-
ture, and while the spectators perspired, the .Mounties became in-
spired. Already Pitt had procured national signiﬁcance with its two
previous victories, and the West Virginians were hungry for an upset.

For the ﬁrst half it looked as if the upset dreams of West Virginia
would materialize. The Panthers were outplayed, outfought, and out-
scored. As the teams went into the dressing room at halftime, the
score stood 7-0, with West Virginia leading.

It always makes a good story when one player can give a sagging
team the lift it needs. It makes a better story when the man that does
it, is the man who is theoretically supposed to—the captain. Well, the
papers got their good story, for Captain Lou Cecconi sparked the
Pitt team to two touchdowns in the third quarter. The spark was
enough to begin a ﬂame under the famed Pitt Line. The forwards
held the Mounties suﬂiciently in check in the ﬁnal half to let the
Panthers rack up their third victory of theseason and remain in the
undefeated class.

The big Panther forward wall,‘ however; permitted the West
Virginians to gain 166 yards rushing. This was a moral victory for
Coach Dud DeGroot and his team, as the Panther line had limited
only 84 yards to both William and Mary and Northwestern.

The brilliant play of little Bimbo Cecconi in the third quarter
brought raves from all those who saw the game. Besides scoring the
two touchdowns that started his team to victory, Bimbo had a net
gain of 65 yards rushing and 34 yards passing for a total of 99 yards
for the third period alone. His TD runs were beautiful dashes of 19
and 26 yards.

Once more a bowl team got the bounce. This time it was West
Bolkavac, Radnor, Boldin, and Pl()tz_ Virginia, last year’s Sun Bowl winner.

After the rugged trip to the mountains, the Panthers returned
home with the idea of taking it easy with a “breather,” little Miami
of Ohio. But as one sportswriter put it, “Miami did the breathing,
right down the Panthers’ necks.”

It took all the Pitt team had to down Miami, 35-26. Led by their
quarterback, Mel Olix, and halfback, Johnny Pont, the Miami team
led the home team statistically in every department but the ﬁnal
.core.

Bimbo Cecconi and Jimmy Joe Robinson continuedto be the
Pitt sparkplugs as each tallied twice. One of “J. J.’s” scores was a
75-yard dash up the left side line.

Then it happened. Indiana toppled the unbeaten Panthers from
the nation’s unbeaten list with a convincing 48-14 victory. The Hoos-
iers, winless in their last 11 starts, pulled the stunning upset with ut-

most ease.

It wasn’t until after Indiana was resting comfortably with a three-
touchdown lead that the Panthers broke into the scoring column in the
second quarter. The Pitts tallied again immediately after the third-
period kickoff to bring the score within their reach, 20-13.

But then the dam broke. Indiana took over from there, and
turned the game into a rout, scoring two TDs in the third and ﬁnal
periods, to give the Panthers their Worst licking of the season.

Pitt turned the script around the next week when they went to
Franklin Field for the ﬁrst time in 17 years to meet undefeated Penn-
sylvania. Every Pitt follower and every follower of football will re-
member that game for years to come.

They will remember how the underdog Panthers jumped to a
13-point lead up to two minutes of the ﬁrst half, and then saw Penn
roar over for two touchdowns and a 14-13 lead. They will remember
how the aroused Quakers scored again in the third stanza to stretch
their lead, and then have the ﬁghting Panthers come right back with a
'7-pointer of their own. B

How can they forget how Bimbo Cecconi returned a Penn punt
back 50 yards to the 29 with minutes remaining and the Pitt team
behind 21-20. Then, those last 35 seconds, after a Pitt touchdown had
been called back by an offside penalty, after a Penn safety—or what
appeared one—-had been taken back by the oﬁcials, how can they
forget the determination, the courage of the Pitt team, as Bernie
Barkouskie broke through the line, and blocked Ray Dooney’s punt
for a safety and a 22-21 breath-taking ﬁnish.

No, not many will forget what Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
called, “the greatest exhibition of team spirit, courage, and determina-
tion, that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing.”

With this win, Pitt had deﬁnitely returned to the national lime-
light.

Even with their amazing victory, the Panthers hosted the Big
Ten’s Rose Bowl hopefuls, Ohio State, as an underdog. One of the

main reasons was the loss of halfback Jimmy Joe Robinson due to the

leg injury he received in the Penn game’ Overall View of the stadium and the 54,789 fans who

witnessed the Panther-Ohio State game.

Gasparovic looks on.

With the burden of duty now on the shoulders of Bimbo, De-
Pasqua, and an untried sophomore Armand DiFonso, the Panthers
almost pulled another storybook game before a homecoming crowd
of 54,789. Almost, but not quite.

Leading former Pitt coach Wes Fesler’s squad for over three
quarters, Pitt got a jolt from which they couldn’t recover. The score
was 10-0 for Pitt when a muffed punt and an Ohio State recovery
put the ball on the 12. And although State drove over for a touchdown
they had to work mighty hard for the 6-pointer.

Seemingly inspired by the break, Ohio State rolled to another
tally before the period ended to make the score 14-10.

Pitt made two menacing moves into State territory, but with the
smell of victory Ohio State wouldn’t budge, and the Pitts walked off
the ﬁeld with a 14-10 heartbreaking loss.

Wes Fesler, who later took his team to Pasadena as the VVestern
Conference champs and beat California in the Rose Bowl, told re-
porters that, “We’ve had some tough ball games this year, but nothing
like this; and that Bimbo Cecconi, I was on edge every time he got
his hands on the ball.”

George Toneﬂ’, the husky guard who recovered Pitt’s fumble
said, ‘Tve been hit hard and often but nothing like I was today. Most
of the teams we went up against have bigger boys but none as tough
and wiry as the Panthers.”

Perhaps Coach Mike Milligan summed it up the best when he
said, “It might have been different with Robinson playing. Cecconi
was wonderful, but couldn’t carry the burden alone. All our plays
worked well and that fumble was just one of those breaks. VVe were
ready for them and gave it all we had. We should have won but didn’t.

There was no doubt about the Minnesota game, however. The
enormous Gophers led by gigantic 6 feet 2 inch, 255-pound Leo
Nomilleni and 6 feet 3 inch, 246-pound Clayton Tonnemaker just
were too big as they submerged the ﬁghting Pitts, 24-7. The Panther
team was outweighed about 24 pounds per man by the boys_ of Bernie
Bierman.

The lone Pitt score came on a pass to Nick DeRosa which made
the score 14-7, the closest it was the entire game.

Billy Bye, at 182 pounds the little man in the backﬁeld, tallied
twice for Minnesota.

The Penn State game meant a little more to the Pitt team than
the usual rivalry between the two schools. This would be the ﬁnale for
19 members of the team. Of the 19, almost all had played together in
their four years at Pitt. These 19 had experienced the humiliating
losses of their early, victory-starved years. These 19 had started Pitt
on the road back to success, and now these 19 were playing their last
game.

All 19 didn’t get into the game, but somehow those who control
football fortunes wanted a ﬁtting ending for these boys. So the Pitt
team—and perhaps fate—scored 19 points to beat Penn State, 19-0.

It was also a ﬁtting ending for the regulars, especially for Bimbo,
Carl, and Jimmy Joe. Cecconi couldn’t have been much more brilliant
in his last stand. “The potent pint of gridiron dynamite” scored two
touchdowns, and passed for the third. He also intercepted three Lion
aerials, all at crucial moments, which put a damper on the Penn State

air attack.
Carl DePasqua, whose ﬁne defensive work usually overshadowed

his offensive work all during the season, was the leading Panther
ground gainer.

And Jimmy Joe, still hampered by the bad leg managed to break
away from the Lion secondary late in the fourth quarter to take a
pass from Bimbo for the ﬁnal tally, a play that covered 58 yards. Yes,
a ﬁtting way to score the ﬁnal TD of the ﬁnal game——a Cecconi to
Robinson pass play——one grand veteran to another.

So the 1949 season was written into the record books. There
were V-Days, more than D-Days. The clock was ticking louder and
louder, the time and Pitt football had arrived.

In recounting the details of the past season, there are many things
that must be omitted because of lack of space. Things like the de-
pendable punts of Bill Hardisty; the unspectacular, but steady line
play of Mike Boldin; Nick Bolkavac’s great play; Earl Sumpter’s
develdpment into a ﬁne offensive end, as well as his defensive capabili-
ties; the shining play of terminal Nick DeRosa; the very steady, and
almost unnoticed work of vital quarterbacks Bobby Lee and Bob
Brennen; the capable replacement for Jimmy Joe—Armand DiFonso;
Lenny Radnor, probably the lightest center in major football; and
many more.

Credit must go, of course to the ﬁne work of the coaching staff.
Headed by Mike Milligan, the remainder of his staff, Dr. Jesse
Quatse, John Chickerneo, Robert Timmons, Josh Williams, Ted
Schmitt, and Paul Sager, who drilled, worked, sweated, and scouted
for this season’s success.

For the next year, Athletic Director Hamilton has again put on
the schedule some of the best teams in the country, including, N otre
Dame, Michigan, State, Rice, Duke, and others. V

The loss of the 19 gridders due to graduation is balanced some-
what by the eligibility of some promising sophomores and transfer
students.

Already some are saying, with graduation losses, and the sched-
ule, that the 1950 Pitt team will be lucky to split even. But it seems
that we’ve heard that song before.

No,'the road back has been too hard and difficult. There will be
no slipping back down the trail. “The schedule will always be with the
best,” says Hamilton.

And so will be future Pitt teams——among the best, with V-Day,
now any day.

OF MEN

FRIENDLY, helpful, enthusiastic—all these can be
applied to Theodore VV. Biddle, Dean of Men.
Being in charge of 8,000 undergraduate men and
1303 men in the graduate schools is far from an
easy task. In fact Dean Biddle’s position has
more details than that of president, dean of fac-
ulty, and dean of men in ten small colleges.

His life is made up of appointments, meetings,
committees beginning at 8:30 in the morning and
often lasting much later than 5 o’clock. He is
chairman of so many committees that in recalling
them he has to count off on both hands. Among
these are chairman of Freshman VVeek, High
School Day, Fraternities, University Housing,
Student Organizations, Political l\Ieetings and
Speakers, Norwegian Scholarship, Publication
Board, and Chancellor’s Reception. As for organ-
izations, he is an officer in the National Associa-
tions of Deans of Men, on the Executive Com-
mittee of Eastern Association of College Deans and
Advisors of Men, and the Pittsburgh Personnel
Association. Naturally all this activity means an
average of twenty invitations of various sorts
each week, and though his busy life necessitates
refusing some of them, the Dean is still a familiar
ﬁgure at all campus events.

VVhen he isn’t attending a University function,
Dean Biddle can be found in his Oakland home,
near the Cathedral, with his wife, Ruby Anne,
daughter Susanna, and son Theodore L.

UNDER the helm of Coach Paul Sager and assistants
Jack Smodic and Tony Razzano for the ﬁrst season, the
JVs dropped their initial encounter to Memphis Naval
Air Station at the Stadium, 12-0. Travelling to Beaver
Falls, the JVs topped Geneva in their second inter-
collegiate encounter, 12-6, for their ﬁrst and only victory
of the season.

Army’s powerful junior squad rolled over the Pitt
team a week later at West Point, 29-2. Ohio State closed
the season for the J Vs by racking up a 40-0 victory.

Playing their ﬁrst inter-collegiate schedule since
1938, the Pitt frosh gained an even split of their four-
game schedule. Coached by a former Pitt star, Ted
Schmitt, the frosh had a respectable season, with many
promising boys headed for the varsity. Schmitt was
assisted by Ed Shedlosky, John Kosh, and Don Fisher.

From the looks of things it appeared as though
the frosh would go through the season undefeated. They
rolled over Washington & Jefferson, 20-0, and Ohio
University, 2'7-7. Both these games were played under
the friendly conﬁnes of the Stadium.

Powerful Army, and the West Virginia freshmen
had different ideas, however, about the Pitt team going
through the season with an unblemished record. The
Cadets racked the Panthers, 35-7, while the Mountain-
eer ﬁrst year men edged Pitt, 14-7.

SPORTING a team record of three victories and six
losses, the 1949 edition of the golf team equalled
their 1948 predecessors percentage wise with both
sporting a .333 mark. The 1948 linksmen had a
won and lost record of two and four.

Coached by Dave McCormick, the team had a
quintet of golfers who proved to be the mainstays
of the squad. They were Andy Mihocko, Irving
Simon, Bill Buress, John Mohr, and Stan Sikora.

The team reached its peak in mid—season
when they shut out St. Francis, 9-0. However, they
suffered a complete reversal of form when they
met the Cornell squad, one of the strongest in the
East, and suﬂered a 7-0 eclipse.

TENNIS

DR. DAVE O’LoUGHL1N’s tennis team rated up
among the top athletic units in the University in
1949 when they compiled an enviable eleven and
two mark.

After splitting even in their ﬁrst two encoun-
ters, beating Bethany in the opener and then
losing to Ohio State, the squad compiled a victory
skein as the season wore on of nine straight vic-
tories before dropping a decision to Penn State.
The squad wound up the season by downing
Allegheny in the ﬁnale.

John Lohstoeter, Stan Weil, and Joe Rauter-
kus were the trio of singles players who sparked
the team to.their ﬁne record. Lohstoeter dropped
only one match all year, while Weil and Rauter-
kus suffered two defeats apiece in the season’s
play. In doubles play, the Lohstoeter-Weil duo
were the outstanding performers.

TRACK AND

THE absence of a Herb Douglas or Ed Sudsina from the
Panther track scene prevented Pitt from producing a
national track star from among its ranks this season.

Yet the tracksters of Carl Olson had the spirit
and determination to win that characterizes the type of
athlete at Pitt. Hurdlers Richard Lindley and Bob
l\IcKoWen were perhaps, not the best in the East, but
they were always in the ﬁnal running in meets entered
by the Panthers.

John Patellos was foremost in the broad jump; Bob
Arthur’s shot put toss usually bettered the 43 feet mark,
and Bill Valentine and Al Yedlicka often soared over
12 feet in the pole Vault.

Cross country at Pitticontinued on the upgrade
last season as Carl Olson’s Panthers won three of four
dual meets while capturing their lone triangular contest.

“Doc” Carlson

Basketball

THE 1949-50 basketball season was one of the most
disastrous since Dr. H. C. Carlson took over the coach-
ing reins 28 years ago.

The Panthers were not expected to be overwhelm-
ing, since two of the city’s highest scorers, Dodo Can-
terna and Sammy David, were graduated, but a little
more was expected than the miserable 4-14 record
posted.

A 52-35 victory over Connecticut in the opening
game of the season gave the. Panther followers some
hope that their pessimism might be wrong. The cagers,
however, were knocked off in their next ﬁve games be-
fore they ﬁnally bowled over Grove City, 84-51, in
their highest scoring display of the season.

. A 59-57 win over Gettysburg and an upset 55-53
victory over West Virginia, in the next to the last
games of the season were the hoopsters only other wins.

Senior guard George McCrossin was the Pitt
sparkplug during the season. He came within 2 points
of establishing a new Stadium scoring record in the
Grove City game, when he plunked in 35 points. Mc-
Crossin’s season total, the team high, was 251 points
for the 18 games.

George Hromanik was second high with 129 points.

After such a dismal season, Doc Carlson’s hair did
not turn white with fear of the coming year. A ﬁne fresh-
man team coached by Bobby Artman, will be eligible
for next season. The frosh, Who compiled an impressive
9 and 3 record are big and fast. Such boys as Mickey

Ben Grady

Swimming

FOR the second successive year the Pitt swimming team
missed an unbeaten season ‘by one. Last year Penn
State handed the tankers their only loss, and this sea-
son, after defeating seven opponents, the merrnen lost to
powerful Rutgers, 40-35.

A ﬁne group of sophomores, plus strength in his
veteran swimmers, gave Coach Ben Grady a successful
season.

VVith second yearrnen Jim Zentgraf, Bob Gover,
Al Baran, Jules l\'Ielograne, and Jim Peterson to back
up the performance of veterans Dick Petro, Captain
Bill Cochran, Don VVilde, and Al Ciocca, the tankers
were able to establish themselves among the best in the
East.

Despite the ﬁne showing, the team had many ob-
stacles to overcome. Their chief difficulty was in ﬁnding
a suitable place to practice in the beginning of the year.

After the cracking up of ancient Trees Gym, the
tankers found a practice site at the Belleﬁeld YMHA.

WRESTLING

WRESTLING became another entry on the Pitt
sports scene, as Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
signed Rex Peery to coach the grapplers.

Although the 1950 season saw the pretzel-
twisters go without a victory, neither Peery nor
Hamilton were discouraged with the results. The
Panthers met some of the top teams in the country
and gained valuable experience for the next sea-
son.

Consistent winner on the winless squad was
Jim Conklin. Conklin Won every match but one.

BASEBALL

Ralph Mitterling

ANY baseball manager will tell you that the dia-
mond sport and opera do not mix. Ralph Mitter-
ling, Pitt’s baseball coach, can probably give you
the most vehement argument concerning this
situation. The “Old Sarge” was evicted from his
Stadium retreat in 1949 by the Civic Light Opera.
This meant that the baseballers had to move to
Schenely Oval for the majority of their home
games.

Mitt’s boys were still able to post an 11 and
8record, however. Behind the pitching of Deryl
Calder, Rudy Hudec, and Larry Brant, and the
hitting of Jack Smodic, the Mittmen were able to
post a favorable season record.

The 1950 squad, which is now preparing for
the coming season, will boast a veteran team.
Graduation losses were light, with some promis-
ing rookies coming up.

REGISTRAR

THIS year, the office of the Registrar has combined the
improvements made in the last few years in setting up a
modern smooth-running system for handling the Q0,000
enrollment.

Under the direction of Registrar J. G. Quick and
his assistants, l\Ir. E. A. Batchelder and Howard A.
Williams, the complicated mechanisms of registration
and gra.de reports were handled with a minimum of
confusion and a maximum of efficient preciseness.

SECRETARY

UNIVERSITY of Pittsburgh’s Secretary, Dr. John W'eber
has for years been known as one of the most inde-
fatigable workers in the school. This year is no excep-
tion, for Dr. Weber has become, if possible, even busier
in helping along one of his favorite programs, the Pitt
Building Program.

Although his duties as administrative secretary are
exacting, Dr. Weber’s strong interest in the new build-
ing plans is understandable, for he has been one of the
key men in beautifying Pitt’s Campus. His work with
the construction of the Cathedral and with Heinz
Chapel was instrumental in making Pitt the point of
interest it is.

The student body can be sure of one thing; behind
the oak door of his office, Dr. VVeber is working tirelessly
for the beneﬁt of the school.

INTRAMURAL

WHILE Athletic Director Tom Hamilton dreams of
the day when Pitt will have an expanded athletic
setup, another director~intramural director Leo
C. Bemis——is dreaming of the day when his IM pro-
gram can be run off on adequate playing areas.

During touch football season, Bemis had to take
his teams to Schenley Oval, as Trees Field became
the site for the new veteran’s hospital.

Basketball season found Bemis with only a
slight headache which disappeared~temporarily——
when ancient Trees Gym was okayed by the city
engineers. The structure had “cracked up” when
water from the hospital foundation had seeped into
its foundation.

Softball season still poses another problem for
the IM head. Spring football has taken all available
ﬁelds, and the Oval will be used by the baseball team.

Bemis, who has had three years of headaches,
is not dismayed at the prospect. He,like the remain-
der of the athletic family is awaiting that golden
day of the future when Pitt will have the area and
facilities demanded by such a large University.

Mr. Bemis points out
the program of the Week
to members of his staﬂ'.

THE Women’s Athletic Association arranged a Well
rounded program for women interested in sports.
As the only women’s athletic organization at the
University, WAA sponsored a seasonal program in-
cluding volleyball, basketball, badminton, ping
pong, archery, and softball.

Fun Frolic Nights were held this year, providing
an opportunity for more students to enjoy relaxation
through recreation. Held every third Thursday, these
nights were one of the most successful parts of the
WAA program.

Freshmen women were introduced to the organ-

THE executive body of the Panhellenic Association,
which includes in its membership every sorority woman
on campus, is Panhellenic Council. Consisting of two
representatives from each sorority, Council strives to
increase each group’s appreciation of the others and to
help sororities function as an integral part of the extra-
curricular program of the University.

During a busy year, Panhel incorporated into its
program many new ideas which had been suggested
at the Workshop last Spring. In the Fall, freshmen W0-
men were introduced to sororities as a group at an
informal reception in the Blue Tuck Shop. On Decem-
ber 8, Panhel joined with IF Council for the annual
sorority and fraternity sing.

Sorority women attended the Workshop in Jan-
uary to discuss in small groups, problems common to
all—rushing, pledging, standards, and ﬁnances. The
successful year closed with the traditional Panhellenic
Ball in April.

Officers were: president, Renee Schorin; vice presi-
dent, Miriam McCauley; secretary, Bernice Golomb;
treasurer, Janet Schorr.

The traditional Commons Room reception was replaced by a Tuck Shop
get together.

Penhel broke tradition by hiring Louis Prima for

ALPHA DELTA PI

ADPIS year began with an October bridge—bazaar,
sponsored by the alumnae and held in the Syria Mosque.
Francene of Gimbels presented a fashion show and door
prizes were awarded.

Highlight of the fall semester was the Black and
White Diamond Ball. The ball is a traditional dance for
Alpha Delta Pis and was held on December 17 at the
Highland Country Club. December also brought a
dinner given by the Mother’s Club and held at the
house. As usual, the holiday weeks ﬂew quickly and
soon the ADPis were back for the new semester.

The semester this Spring began in a ﬂurry of rush-
ing parties and fraternity tea dances. Alpha Delta Pi
really opened the semester, however with a slumber
party for the girls held at the house. A few months later
they created an early summer with a Swimming Party
at the PAA. In May the girls disentangled themselves
from social activities to plan their Founders’ Day Ban-

   

284

quet which was held in the Oliver Building on lVIay 21.

Of course the high point of the Spring semester
was Festival week, and with it came hours of work and
fun building the ﬂoat and booth. Graduation soon fol-
lowed and ADPis began saying good-bye to the twelve
seniors who left this year.

ADPis will remember this year for the many honors
their girls received. Betty Bolger, president of WSGA,
was chosen as the sweetheart of SAE; Junell Campbell
was sweetheart of Phi Kappa; and two members, Betty
Bolger and Ronnie Fowler, were tapped to Mortar
Board. The ADPis are now the proud owners of a radio-

contest.

ALUMNI

ASSOCIATION

The lines were long and continuous inside the
tent where the food was served in smor-

gasbord style.

THE GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION of the University
of Pittsburgh is the organization which represents all
alumni of the University.

It is comprised of eleven constituent associations
representing each school of the University and\ the
Alumni. The governing body is the Alumni Council.

Each person who receives a degree is automatically
considered a member and enjoys voting privileges. The
members of the association elect a total of ten members
of the Board of Trustees and the Council elects two
members to the Athletic Policy Committee.

The general purpose of the association is to repre-
sent the alumni of the University and to interpret the
University to the alumni. Activities include a Fall
Homecoming Celebration, a Children’s Christmas Party

and the Spring Homecoming and Reunion Celebration
including the World-Famous Smorgasbord. In addition,
the association publishes the Alumui News Review which
is mailed ﬁve times per year without charge to every
alumnus whose address is on ﬁle.

The association also operates an Annual Alumni
Giving Fund, the purpose of which is to promote the
progress of the University of Pittsburgh by securing
annual contributions from the University’s alumni for
the development and support of better and broader edu-
cational services for the students, alumni, and com-
munity in general The names of contributors are pub-
lished in the current issue of the Alumni News Review
by school and class and are again shown in the annual
report—The Blue Book of Pitt Alumni.

ALPHA EPSILON PHI

THE AEPHIS past year started off with a fall party at
Totem Pole Lodge in South Park. Wearing plaid shirts
and dungarees, the girls made feeble attempts at mas-
tering square dances. Mixed with a few Charlestons,
the party started the year off with a great deal of fun
and spirit.

After the ﬁrst bustle of the Tuck Shop wore off,
the AEPhis found themselves immersed in delicious
green and white punch—their special brew for the fra-
ternity tea dances they hold during each semester. After
the Penn State game they opened their doors to every-
one for a real victory celebration.

Next cue for buzzing activity came when the call
went out for Panhel Sing recruits. Although AEPhi did
not win the cup, the girls did have a lot of fun planning
for the Sing.

Rushing, luncheon dating, parties, and teas came
during the Spring semester to ﬁll an already busy and
fun packed year. Following rushing came hard work and
satisfaction as all the girls pitched in to build the ﬂoat
and booth for Spring Festival. The annual Spring formal
held at Westmorland Country Club proved a ﬁtting
climax for the year.

Of course there were the usual pinnings and en-
gagements throughout the year to keep AEPhis pop-
ping, and ﬁnally graduation came for eight members:
Rita Gould, Ilene Whiteman, Lois Skirboll, Bobbie
Feldman, Mina Serbin, Rhoda Unger, Betty Burstin,
and Renee Schorin.

BETA SIGMA OMICRON

THE activities of this year began last fall when the ac-
tive members of Beta Sigma Omicron participated in
the pledging ceremonies for the new chapters at Evans-
ville and Theil colleges. At this time the girls also wel-
comed a transfer Beta, Rosan Hahbeger, from the
VVestminster Chapter.

In October the Beta Sigs planned the ﬁrst social
event of the year. It was a “roughing-it” barn dance
held in North Park to start the year pleasantly.

Some of the Betas took off for Philadelphia to see
the Pitt-Penn game and were entertained by the mem-
bers of the University of Pennsylvania chapter of Alpha
Chi Rho Fraternity. After the cheering for football
victories died down, the girls set to work planning their
Christmas formal. It was held early in December at

the Edgewood Country Club. That same week the Betas
decorated the house for the annual F ounder’s Day Tea.

With the Spring semester came Festival week and
frantic plans for a booth. In the midst of these activities
the girls also held regular tea dances and informal par-
ties for various fraternities on campus.

Beta Sigs are proud to claim the honor of having
two of their sisters win the Nationality Rooms Com-
mittee award and travel abroad. Margie Kostelnik and
Vernie Stanislaw have both spent summers in Europe
after receiving the award.

Officers for this year were: president, Lois Tim-
mons; vice president, Claire Large; recording secretary,
Nancy Heck; corresponding secretary, Ruth Johnson;

treasurer, Catherine Clayton.

IN CH1 0 LANGUAGE “time waits for_no man” might
read “hours ﬂy for all women,” especially for the 3,120
hours of the past school year.

The girls churned into motion at the beginning of
the year with sweeping plans for scholastic and social
doings. Margie Donnellan and Margie Bell conspired
with Nancy Beard, Muriel Hutton, Pricilla Pancereve,
and Rosemary Loefﬂer and became snappy kiltie
lassies for Panhel Sing.

Before too much of the year had gone by the Chi
O’s, rounding off their scholastic undertakings, had
members of the faculty as speakers. Jeanine Spatz,
Ruth Kunst, and Shirley Eversole are still chuckling
over Doc F erguson’s talk.

Next came the Orphan’s party at Christ mas. Marty
MacMichael, Joan Ross, and Dolly Gates did a ﬁne
job of trimming the tree which stood in the living room,

 

Merry Christmas—as reﬂected at

and the truth of the matter is that the Chi O’s probably
had more fun than the kids.

After the party, the members relaxed, but the PJ
party instigators, l\Iarty Braun, Pat Clohessy, and
Shirley Davis would give no one rest. New pledges,
Liz Hampers, Mary Angelos, and Polly Dickson were
there in great form.

The Elusinian Banquet in the Spring gave June
Hubbard and Betty Lou Fennell an opportunity to
eat heartily, but Joan Martin stood by with the Alka
Seltzer. Christmas and spring Formals will be remem-
bered by Chi O’s. So will the looks on the faces of the

THE TRI DELTS ushered the 1949-50 school year in with a
successful Open House following the Penn State football
game. After the hilarity of football victories died down, the
girls kept the sing team busy practicing for Panhel Sing.
The Sing in December proved that the Tri Delts had not
practiced in vain.

Weeks before and after Christmas were ﬁlled with
parties, dances, and beneﬁts. The Alums and the Tri Psis,
the mothers’ organization, each gave a party for the chap-
ter. On December 16, the girls gathered tinsel and mistletoe
to deck the house for the annual Christmas formal. Then,
just before Christmas, the Tri Delts planned and held
their annual Christmas party for a group of orphans. With
a real Santa Claus and gifts for the kids, the party was
fun for everyone. The end of December saw the girls

Spring brought ﬂowers, warm breezes, wor_nen’s

Festival Week. Festival Week called for long, tiresome but
happy hours spent in building the ﬂoat and planning a

DELTA ZETA’s memory book is full of many wonderful
things.

Slumber parties in the newly furnished DZ room
turned into all night bull sessions as the girls talked
over summer vacations during the ﬁrst weeks of school.
In October, the annual Founder’s Day dinner at the
College Club brought together actives and alums and
after the Penn State game, Pitt and State rooters buried
the hatchet at a peace PowWow at the DZ tepee. On
December 18, DZ’s and their dates danced through
candle—lit rooms at the traditional Christmas formal.
DZ men were initiated at the Spring formal which
closed the Delta Zeta date book for the year.

These social events were only a part of DZ memo-
ries. The 1948-1949 Panhellenic Scholarship cup was

KAPPA ALPHA THETA

KAPPA ALPHA THETA, oldest Greek letter sorority, en-
joyed another year of Theta fun and fellowship. As
always, the year was ﬁlled with activities of all sorts.

Things Thetas remember especially—their own
dinners at the house on Monday nights, thus disproving
the old adage, “Too many cooks spoil the soup;”
winning the ﬁrst place cup at Panhel Sing; howing at
each other and diaper-draped dates at a hilarious
“Kiddie Party.” However, they donned formals and
made a more sophisticated impression Waltzing around
the Christmas tree at the annual Christmas formal held
at the house. Getting back to school after mid-semester
Vacation was especially exciting because Thetas had a
Spring dinner-dance to look forward to, and as usual, it
was a great success.

But all activities required work, and work they did.
Rushing, Spring Festival, Open Houses, and tea dances

meant lots of committee work. Yet somehow even the
work was fun, especially the annual project of supplying
Christmas dinner for several poor families.

While the Thetas are proud of each and every one
of their members, they feel especially proud of Flo
Diemert, ﬁrst coed president of Student Congress;
Carol Smith, president of Cwens; and Peggie Cochrane,
WSGA secretary.

Looking back it really has been a year the graduat-
ing seniors, Flora Diemert, Jeanne Fisher, Marjorie
l\Ioser, Iris Hinckly, Mary Helene l\IcNelly and Betty
McParland will never forget.

Officers for the year were: president, Jeanne Fisher;
vice president, Marjorie Moser; secretaries, Iris Hinckly
and Mary Lou Wetmore; treasurer, l\Iary Helene
McNelly.

KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA

WINDING UP a successful 1948-49 season by winning the
Panhellenic and Junior Panhellenic Sing Cups, the Kap-
pas began the new school year with enthusiasm.
President “Tu” Kampus wasted no time in getting
things 03 to a good start and all approved the program
which Lois Dunlap, social chairman, planned. A ﬂapper
dance held at the Klub Kappa initiated the social sea-
son. Besides fall open houses and fraternity tea dances,
the Kappas joined with the Sigma Alpha Epsilon for
their annual Orphan’s Christmas Party. In January,
they danced at their winter formal at the Shannopin
Country Club. The Kappas wound up a successful
social calendar with the annual Kappa-Delt Faculty
Reception and a spring formal honoring their pledges.
They were Very proud of the members who brought
honor to Kappa Kappa Gamma. Mildred Egge who

298

was tapped Junior Worthy last Spring, was Chief
Justice of Senior Court and also a member of Mortar
Board. Jane Dobrosielski was chairman of'the Customs
Committee. Barbara Messenger was tapped to Cwens.
Also bringing honor to the sorority were three fraternity
sweethearts: Claire Mayer, Phi Gamma Delta Dream
Girl; Mary Payne Furlong, Phi Delta Theta Queen; and
Pat Nelson, Delta Tau Delta sweetheart.

As the year drew to a close, Kappas said goodbye
to ten Seniors at a picnic held in their honor. Gamma
Epsilon Chapter is proud that it has achieved every
ideal dear to the hearts of Kappas everywhere.

WHEN a Phi Mu senior looks back after graduation,
what will she remember about 1949 and 1950 at Pitt?
Beta Theta and the Phi Mu sisters with whom she spent
her last college year.

Beta Theta, those two Greek letters call up these
memories: a piece of candy from the boxes passed when
Lillian Pasqual and Sarah Jean Shaw were engaged; a
glance of pride at the mantel and the District III cup
for Fraternity Education; the tea for Mrs. Norman
Dumbar, Phi Mu’s national president; Ginny Fansler’s
wide eyes when she received the scholarship bracelet;
Irene Fusco singing a solo that made the girls wonder
why they could not sing like that; talk with Mary Batz
about Europe, reconstruction, and glasses of weak red
wine; a quick reassuring glance down at the familiar
shield that means so much to Phi Mu’s every-where.

Phi Mu seniors have these memories and many

more involving responsibilities. Marion Ford and Ginny
F ansler held the positions of Vice President and Treas-
urer of the YWCA. Marion was also chairman of Pan-
hellenic Workshop and of arrangements for Religion-
in-Life Week. Joanne Charland was chairman of the
YW’s Monday Lunch. Elaine Caliquiri was Y Guild
advisor and chairman of house organizations for Re-
ligion-in-Life. Eileen Swaney and Donna Jean Henry
were guild advisors. Betty Jane Fitzsimmons was
Vice President of Commons Room Council. There were
six senior mentors among them too: Sally Clow, Vir-
ginia F ansler, B. J. Fitzsimmons, Marion Ford, Sarah
Jean Shaw, and Shirley Von Behren.

Oﬂicers for the year were: president, Lillian Pas-

PHI SIGMA SIGMA

Ir NEVER rains but it pours-—go0d things for the Phi
Sigs! During the year many of the girls took a leading
part in activities. Sandra Shine, Carol Nunes, and Pearl
Tobachnik were Senior Mentors. In WSGA, Bev
Snyder was chairman of the Social Committee; Betty
Mae Swartz was chairman of the Activities Committee;
Dolores Lux was Scholastic Honors Chairman; Geri
Taper Braunstein was Corresponding Secretary; Pearl
Tobachnik was chairman of the Housing Board; Bunny
Goslomb was Secretary of Panhellenic Council.

The first big Phi Sig event of the year came off
November 5 when the girls shared compliments with
Phi Mu on a highly successful open house after the Ohio
State game. Spirits were not low despite Pitt’s losing.

During Fall Rushing, the Phi Sigs added three ﬁne

girls to their group: Pearl Tobachnik, Sue Alman, and
Elanor Syna. In December, just before Christmas va-
cation, they forgot about tests and term papers long
enough to have a lovely Winter Dance at the house.

March, an especially busy month for them, started
with a Charity Bridge for Rheumatic Fever followed by
a spring house dance. On March 26 Phi Sigs treated
their Dads to a Father-Daughter party. However, they
did not neglect their mothers on May 7 when they held
their traditional Mother’s Day affair at the Schenley.
The Phi Sigs ended their social year with a picnic which
proved to be the best affair with the most fun.

SIGMA SIGMA SIGMA

SITTING in the living room of the Tri Sig apartment,
and watching the girls before meeting, it seems almost
impossible that those girls who worked so hard for‘
this are now graduating. Less than one year ago, Kappa
Delta Phi went national to become Sigma Sigma Sigma
Sorority, and just last summer Agnes Iglar and Marty
Lazorcak found a beautiful apartment on Fifth Ave-
nue in which the Tri Sigs could “set up housekeeping.”

Just as soon as they got the apartment in shape,
the'Tri Sigs held a big Housewarming Party after the
Ohio State game. With Christmas coming, they joined
forces with the Theta Chis for an orphan’s party.

The Tri Sigs didn’t let January’s Friday the 13th
scare them. In fact, they tempted fate by having their
winter formal that night. That winter formal was so
much fun that a date for an April dance was im-
mediately circled on their social calendar. Then of
course, Tri Sigs turned out en mass for the Senior

304

Send-off at the end of the year.

A typical apartment scene is similar to this: Regina
DiLeonardo, and Jane Barthelemy, two of the ﬁve
senior mentors, counting out the stitches as their ar-
gyle socks grow; Bev Schmidt bragging about the latest
engagement of Women’s Choral Trio; Elaine Morgan
looking resentful when Angie Spadaccia mentions prac-
tice teaching; Agnes Iglar and Doris Johnson, account-
ing geniuses, discussing the Phi Chi Theta, dinner;
Arlene Ratner, talking about her handsome date for
Saturday night. Sound like bedlam? It probably would
to a stranger, but to the Tri Sigs it means just one
thing—a dozen or more warm friendships and Sigma
Sigma Sigma.

Officers for the year Were: president, Regina Di-
Leonardo; vice president, Dorothy Ohlsson; corres-
ponding secretary, Olga Ivanowski; recording secre-
tary, Loretta Chestlo; treasurer, Doris Johnson.

TH ETA PHI ALPHA

1949-50, their twenty-seventh year on the University
of Pittsburgh campus, was a golden one for Theta Phi
Alpha. The noble traditions of the silver, gold, and blue,
begun at the University of Michigan in 1912, were car-
ried forward by Pitt TPA’s.

Things got off to a ﬁne start last semester with a
“Back to School Blues Party.” Everyone wore some-
thing blue and donated a blues record to the dwindling
supply. How puzzled the TPA’s were at Tanny F inner-
an and Mary Lee Feeney’s blue art work.

Time sped by and October 29 saw a minor Theta
Phi Alpha Convention at Franklin Field for the Penn
game. Some of the girls drove down, but Patty Devlin
and Alice Barr thought that game was worth sitting up
in a train two nights without sleep. Towards the middle
of November Jean Streigle began to wonder seriously
about chemistry, and Mary Bragg listened enraptured
to Rita Butler, Elena Bonaro and Doris Bartko discuss
the trials and tribulations of student teaching.

Nancy Christian did get her socks ﬁnished in time

for Christmas under the able supervision of Sylvia
Steinbach and Jo Maglaughlin did not seem to mind a
forfeit of ﬁve pounds of chocolates When she got her
ring in January.

Of course TPA’S remember the big things of 1949-
50 but they will remember lots of little things about the
year too . . . how often their eyes strayed during meet-
ings to the mantel and the loving cup for winning ﬁrst
prize in the Float Parade . . . Mimi McCauley’s in-
volved minutes; Peggy Ferguson springing her latest
joke on Marcy Tulusiak . . . Jeanne. Kellar rounding up
a housecleaning crew . . . Brenda McCauley asking for
party suggestions . . . Gwen Wholey plotting a terriﬁc
rushing campaign . . . and Kathleen Reardon chanting
sorority history to pledge mistress, Justine Regan.

Ofﬁcers were: president, LaVerne Wallisch; vice
president, Justine Regan; recording secretary, Miriam
McCauley; corresponding secretary, Marcelline Tulus-
iak; treasurer, Doris Bartko.

ZETA TAU ALPHA

ZETA TAU ALPHA girls are making special mental notes
for this past school year of 1949-1950 because they do
not want to forget a single thing.

They’1l remember the grand time they had at the
Founders Day Banquet, October 17, at Schenley
Hotel. It certainly was difficult eating the chicken “po-
litely’” but they managed. The Zetas had lots of fun
at their hay ride at Pine Valley—how surprised they
were when they saw the tractor “horse” and those _few
shreds of hay. Then for two weeks the girls all had colds.

The Zeta Christmas party for orphan children
was a happy and inspiring event. Winter and Spring
formals were other highlights of the year. Then there
were Monday night dances with the Theta Chis, Delts,
and SAE’s and a bridge party with the alumnae. Spring
Festival memories will live always too.

The girls will remember the Sing Team—Pat
Ayres, Thelma Evans, Dottie Kasputis, Alice Lawson,

   

Ginny Miller, Audrey Schilpp, Nancy Tear, Joanne
Weitzel and their “do, ra, me’s’”

Then too, Zetas will not forget how proud they were
of: Nancy Tear, Alice Lawson, and Betty Graham,
President, Treasurer, and Editor-Historian of the
Sophomore Class; Mortar Board members, Rosemary
Eckles and Babs Wolff, a Senior Court member also;
Senior Mentors, Jean Pinkerton and Rosemary Eckles.

Besides all these things, there are so many others
ZTA’s want to remember—the wonderful oflicers;Mary
Pat Mullvaney and her constant reminder of “standards
please”; the beautiful scholarship plaque from the
alumnae; Jerry Yonakas and her original ideas for
dances and decoration; peppy Audrey Evans; the fun
of working together and being a Zeta.

Officers for the year were: president, Rosemary
Eckles; Vice president, Jean Pinkerton; secretary, Dot
Gilmore; treasurer, Shirley Pearson.

AKA’s started the year off with a get-acquainted affair in
early November. The dance is an annual event called the
“Autumn Nocturne.” That same month they held a toy
shower for the children at the Davis Home for Colored
Children.

December found Alpha Kappa Alpha deep in busy
plans for a Christmas party and luncheon—both success-
fully brought a holiday atmosphere to the group. During
Religion-in-Life week AKA’s were fortunate to have Dr.
l\IcKinney as guest speaker of one of their meetings. After
the ﬂurry of exams and mid-term vacation, the girls came
back to plan their ﬁrst annual Scholarship Ball. They enter-
tained the children from the Davis Home at a party during
the Easter holidays.

In May, Alpha Kappa Alpha celebrated Mothers’
Day by giving a Mothers’ Tea for the sorority members
and their mothers. An affair which brought the girls together
for a good time was the Big and Little Sister Party. In June
AKA’s honored members who were graduating with a party
and ﬁnished the year off with the annual Rose Ball formal.

The officers for this year were: president, Dorise
F inney; vice president, Mary Sidberry; recording secretary,
Jean Farrish; correponding secretary, Shirley Lightfoot;
ﬁnancial secretary, Lillian Hunter; treasurer, Theresa

DELTA SIGMA THETA’s past year was ﬁlled with parties
teas, dinners, and dances that spelled a busy, but happy
1949-50.

The ﬁrst affair planned by the girls was a Mother’s
Tea during the Fall semester to acquaint the mothers
with all the sorority members, each other and sorority
activities. Amidst the traditional excitement of the
Christmas season the girls found themselves busily
engrossed in planning the annual Candlelight Soiree.

Back at school after the holidays, Delta Sigma
Thetas began planning their January Founders’ Day—
an annual service held in honor of the founders of the
sorority. In that same month the girls planned and
held a George Washington Carver Service in the Heinz
Chapel.

During the spring semester Delta Sigma Theta
sponsored two affairs to replenish the scholarship
fund. The ﬁrst was called “Jabberwock” and was put
on by the three Pittsburgh Chapters of the sorority.
Thisis a regular Spring event. Later in the semester the
girls held a card party which helped the fund as well
as their pre-exam morale.

Oﬂicers for this year were: president, Dorothy
Powell; Vice president, Mattie Robinson; recording
secretary, Dorothy Lance; ﬁnancial secretary, Geraldine
Jackson, treasurer, Janet Makel.

As THE newest national sorority on campus, Sigma
Delta Tau had a whirlwind social calendar. The
girls oﬂicially opened their new apartment and initi-
-ated social events for the year with an Open House
on October 28. On December 3, SDT’s entertained
at a “Hobo Convention.” All the gang turned out in
their fanciest blue jeans to witness the arrival of the
other “hobos.”

The SDT’s saluted 1950 with a dance at the Roose-
velt Hotel. As soon as this was over, activity turned
to preparation for the annual Fashion Show at the
William Penn Hotel on February 19. In April the
girls tried their luck at skating and even with a few
ﬂops every now and then, it was fun. The closing
event for the year was the annual two day week end
—a formal dinner dance at the Highland Country
Club, followed by an all day picnic the next day at
North Park.

Oﬂicers for the year were: president, Estelle Gar-
ﬁnkel; vice president, Marcia Sachs; recording sec-

INTER-FRATERNITY COUNCIL, the representative body
to which each fraternity sends two members, has for
many years oﬂered both social and political leadership
to the University.

C0uncil’s year began with the Inter-Fraternity
Reception for all freshmen and transfer students. It
was followed by numerous social events for prospective
fraternity men.

The Winter and Spring Inter-Fraternity Balls
highlighted the social calendar. The combined Pan-
hellenic and Fraternity Sing proved successful for the
second year.

Believing that fraternities have obligations other
than social, IF Council has attempted to develop fra-
ternity leaders through a series of Leadership Confer-
ences. To keep fraternity men informed about its
activities, Council experimented with an IF newspaper.
Another innovation this year was the fraternity tele-
phone directory.

Oﬂicers for the year were: president, Ray Maher;
vice president, Jay E. Bailey; secretary, Dick Cunning-
ham; treasurer, Marty Sheinman; ﬁfth member, Jack

DELTA SIGMA PHI

DECEMBER 10, 1949, marked the Golden Anniversary
of Delta Sigma Phi. After the founding at City College
of New York in 1899, a continuous period of expansion
followed until today the chapters of Delta Sigma Phi
number well over ﬁfty.

In 1916' Omega chapter had its beginning at Pitt.
From that time it prospered until the depression spelled
the same doom for the Delta Siga that it did to many
other college fraternities.

At Penn State in 1946, Omega chapter was reacti-
vated and returned to Pitt. Since that date, able leader-
ship and sound ﬁnancial policies have raised the chapter
to high standing among the other fraternities on campus.

The fall semester had scarcely begun before Delta
Sigs started their social functions. With Bud Trunick
as Social Chairman, parties and rushing events became
weekly affairs.

Delta Sigs were loyal supporters of the varsity

football team, cheering brother Charlie Yost, varsity
lineman, and demonstration block leader, Andy Schur-
man. Away games at l\Iorgantown and Philadelphia
found Delta Sigs well represented in the Pitt sections.

Taking an increasing roll in campus activities,
Delta Sigs are receiving recognition for their work in the
YMCA, publications, athletics, and other organiza-
tions. Ralph Thorne is business manager of Spring
Carnival. Andy Schurman will wear the Panther skin
at football games next year as Pitt’s mascot. He is also
secretary of the YMCA, a member of Druids, and a
Pitt News sports writer. Ken Schwartz is art editor of
the Owl and Howard Leckey is on the wrestling team.

ings of the IF League.

DELTA TAU DELTA

THE DELTS have always prided themselves on their
well-rounded background in all aspects of interfraternity
and campus life. Rather than stressing any one ﬁeld
they have tried to maintain a balance of interests that
would include school activities, scholarship, athletics,
and social events. Activities of the past year and the
outlook for the coming year seem to bear out the wis-
dom of this policy, for the men of Gamma Sigma chap-
ter can never be overlooked in any of these ﬁelds.

Delts are not only in the foreground in many ac-
tivities, but are providing much of the background
strength in others. Bill Swanson is vice president of
Student Congress, president of ODK, and a member of
Men’s Debate. Fred Purdy joins him in ODK and is
assistant business manager of the “Panther.” Head
cheerleader Jack Barilar is aided by Ira Houck. Bill
Brehm is on the Pitt basketball team, while a new ar-
rival in the school limelight is Paul Chess, promising
sophomore wingback in varsity football. Many more

Delts are sustaining members in these and other activ-
ities. In IF competition, teams wearing Delta Tau
Delta’s colors are always respected and feared.

The Shelter at 4712 Bayard Street is an even more
popular social center since the extensive improvements
of the past year. It is the scene of many a ﬁne time~
house dance, tea dance, faculty reception, buffet
lunch, or plain old fellowship gathering on Monday
meeting night.

The Delts branched out this year with the Winter
Formal at Churchill Valley; the Annual Christmas ser-
vice at Trinity Cathedral; and attendance at all Uni-
versity and IF social events, to say nothing of their
own famous Bowery Brawl at South Park.

Officers were: president, Ira Houck; vice president,
William Brehm; recording secretary, Grant Doering;
corresponding secretary, Bob Wolford; treasurer,

KAPPA NU

THE MEMBERS of Kappa Nu returned from the 1949
summer vacation to continue a rebuilding program.
With a tremendous rushing program and house
reinodeling running concurrently, every man did a ﬁne
job. Sam Tisherman led a dynamic rushing campaign
which ultimately brought twenty of Pitt’s freshmen
into the fraternity while Norton Berman’s hard work-
ing committee guided the remodeling of the fraternity
house at 222 North Craig Street.

Xi chapter was established at the University of
Pittsburgh in 1923. Due to the economic depression, the
fraternity was forced to relinquish its charter. In 1947,
the Kappa Nu Graduate club, which was still active,
brought Xi back to campus.

Kappa Nu has climbed rapidly since reactivation.

The chapter house, to which the fraternity moved
from the Webster Hall hotel, has been renovated with
the cooperation of actives and alums until now it is one
of the show places of the campus. It was in the house
that movies were taken of a rushing dance and televised
over WDTV, making Kappa Nu one of the ﬁrst' fra-
ternities at‘Pitt to use the latest medium of publicity.

This rapid growth did not go unnoticed nationally
either. Local delegates to the national convention in
December, returned bearing the Kappa Nu Founders’
Cup, a national award to the KN chapter which has
shown the greatest progress in the previous year.

Oﬁicers were: president, Jack Grodin; vice presi-
dent, Jerry Zoffer; secretary, Leo Moss; treasurer,
Jerome M. Potashrnan.

PHI DELTA TH ETA

PHI DELTA THETA, one of the most powerful organizations
in the Greek world, was founded in 1848 at Miami Uni-
versity, Oxford, Ohio.' The fraternity has grown until it is
found on over one hundred and ten American campuses.

Established on the basic principles of deep friendship
and mutual interest, Phi Delta Theta‘is a leader in scholar-
ship, athletics, and social activities, The men of Pennsyl-
vania Iota chapter have always lived in an atmosphere of
loyalty, unity, and fellowship, upholding the honor of
fraternity and of the University. Friendship, culture, and
sound learning are aims of Phi Delta Theta. Phi Delts
participated in athletics and were members of many
campus honoraries and organizations.

The social calendar was initiated by the l\Iiami
Triad Dance in the Fall and closed with the traditional
Phi Delt Spring formal. Tea dances, house dances, and
picnics, kept members busy throughout the year.

Ofﬁcers were: president, Jim Stopford; vice president,
Jerry Cornwell; recording secretary, Harry Ellis; corre-

PHI EPSILON PI

PHI EPSILON P1’s thirty-seventh year on the Pitt
campus, was one of the most active and successful in
the chapter’s history. This year the house at 150 North
Dithridge underwent extensive remodeling, the results
of which are a new game room and a redecorated living
room. With the kitchen functioning at all times, mem-
bers are now having their meals served at the house.
These improvements, along with a new television set,
make the Phi Ep house one of the most modern.

The social committee presented a well-rounded cal-
endar of activities. There were weekly dances and T. V.
nights at the house. The Phi Ep Valentine formal
and the semi-annual pledge affair highlighted the win-
ter months. However, the really big affair of the year
was the Phi Ep weekend held at the end of school. A
dinner dance, house party, and picnic on successive
days ended the spring term on a grand note.

Many Phi Eps are active in University organiza-
tions. ODK member, Jack Abramson is business man-

ager of Pitt players. Howard Greenberger, president of
Men’s Council, is a member of ODK, Student Congress,
and vice president of the YMCA. Lenny Briskin is
assistant manager of Players and a member of the Owl
staff, and debator Cyril Wecht also plays in the Uni-
versity orchestra.

Phi Ep, knowing the value of inter-mural activities
in creating solid fraternity spirit, has always gone all
out in support of IF activities. Debating, singing, and
athletics have been accented. This practice has resulted
in ﬁrst place trophies in every phase of IF activity.
Although the men who have worn the sixteen-pearled
pin for the past four years have had a great deal to do
with the winning of these awards, Phi Ep is looking for-
ward to even greater success in the future.

Officers for the year were: president, Howard
Greenberger; vice president, Charles Solof; recording
secretary, James Rosen; corresponding secretary, Irving
Faigen; treasurer, Morton Bassel.

PHI GAMMA D ELTA

FOR THE LAST one hundred and two years, the white
star of Phi Gamma Delta has been worn by its brothers,
known the country over as Fijis. Phi Gamma Delta
was founded in 1848 when six men joined in the com-
mon belief of the value of intimate fraternity life and
founded the fraternity’s ﬁrst chapter at what is now
Washington and Jefferson College. Today there are
seventy-nine chapters in thirty-two states and two Can-
adian provinces.

In looking back over fraternity life, brothers in
Pi Sigma will not forget some of the events that occurred
this year. They will remember the Winter Formal at
the J acktown Hotel which highlighted the social season
of house dances, picnics, hayrides and stag events.
Phi Gams will not forget the wonderful time that they,
as Well as the children, had at the annual Orphans’
Christmas party.

“When do we eat?” at IF Breakfast.

3Q6

Even with a full calendar of social events, Fijis
found enough time for study in order to defend the
ﬁrst place position in the IF scholarship race which
they WOI1 last year.

The most memorable event was the winning of the
IF All-Point Trophy. Every brother eagerly followed
the athletic schedule in order that the Phi Gams might
win this important trophy for the second consecutive
year. Phi Gamma Delta has the distinction of winning
the trophy seven out of the eleven times that it has
been awarded.

These events, as well as others will be remembered
by Pi Sigma’s Fijis long after they have left Pitt.

Oﬂicers for the year were: president, John L.
Holloway; corresponding secretary, Daniel R. Mac-
Lean; recording secretary, Philip A. Baird; treasurer,
John R. Horner.

TWENTY—SEVEN years ago a group of eighteen men
established Mu chapter of Phi Kappa fraternity on the
Pitt campus. During these years, the chapter has taken
an active and a leading part in all campus activities.
Weathering the years of the depression and war has
given the chapter a solid group of faithful alumni and
friends.

The twenty-three brothers of Phi Kappa who
spent their last year at Pitt, graduated in the blaze of
glory they deserve. They are the men who laid the
foundation for today’s strong chapter when they joined
Phi Kappa following reactivation after the war.

Tremendous progress has been made during the
past year. The completion of the remodeled playroom,

the beginning of a renovation program for the ﬁrst
ﬂoor, and a clean up campaign for the third floor dormi-
tories are improvements which will make quite a dif-
ference in 152 North Dithridge.

Mu chapter was particularly proud to celebrate the
anniversary of Housemother Mrs. Camille MacElwee,
who has greeted Phi Kap brothers for twenty-seven
years. She is the true ‘Sweetheart of Phi Kappa.”

A ﬂashback on the social calendar shows numerous
tea dances, bi-monthly house dances, Spring and Win-
ter formals, and a vigorous rushing period.

Officers for the year were : president, James Lauble;
vice president, Ted Zatkovich; secretary, John O’Don-
nell; treasurer, Gail Weisner.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

P1 KAPPA ALPHA was founded on March 1, 1868, at the
University of Virginia. Since the founding, the frater-
nity has expanded to include ninety-four chapters lo-
cated throughout the United States and Canada.
Gamma Sigma chapter at Pitt, one of the largest
fraternities on campus, recently acquired a chapter
house at 255 North Craig Street. Many improvements,
both inside and out have been made by the PiKA’s.
On November 9, 1949, Dean Biddle formally
opened the new house with the traditional ribbon-cut-
ting ceremony. This was the ﬁrst post-war oﬂicial open-
ing of a fraternity house on campus. The ceremony was
also the ﬁrst of its kind ever to be televised at Pitt.
WDTV was on hand to take movies of the event and
the following evening these appeared on the Pitt Parade.

PiKA remains high in the race for the IF All-
Point Trophy, having won in football and sing competi-
tion, and with victories in many other sports.

Men of PiKA prominent in school activities in-
clude James Morton, president of the fraternity and a
member of Men’s Council; Don Wilde, president of the
YMCA, and a member of Student Congress and Omi-
cron Delta Kappa; “Ike” Icardi, who cavorted on the
football ﬁeld as the Panther for the past three years,
and who was also a member of Men’s Council; and Bill

PI LAMBDA PHI opened its doors to a new semester in a
completely modernized, newly furnished home. Plans
have been approved for a new porch and a landscaping
job which should be under way in the near future.
When the outside is ﬁnished, the Pi Lam house will be
one of the most beautiful and up to date on campus.

The social season got off to a, fast start with Fall
rushing. At that time, the Pi Lams had several house
dances, a tea dance, and a sports stag. After a successful
rushing season, during which the fraternity pledged
over twenty, members set forth on plans for a socially
active year.

Pi Lams held their annual Open House the week
end of the Ohio State game. At the next house affair,
they joined with other fraternity members for a pro-
gressive dance. In November, the Fall formal weekend
included a party at Colonial Manor and dinner dance

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

FOUNDED at the University of Alabama in 1856, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon is the largest, as well as one of the oldest
national collegiate fraternities in the United States.
Today SAE has one hundred and nineteen chapters in
forty-six states and seventy-thousand brothers.
Pennsylvania Chi Omicron was founded at Pitt
in 1913 on the principle that an educated man with the
experience of fellowship, social endeavor, and working
with his fellow men will be a greater credit to his com-
munity and to himself. It is the belief of SAE that fra-
ternity life is conducive to the development of qualities
of honor, loyalty, and friendship, and that with the
bonds of fraternal organization, the college student
can best equip himself for life in later years. With this
in mind, Chi Omicron planned a successful and enjoy-
able program for the year.
A strong alumni group helped the chapter complete
a modernization program for the house. The brothers

House for parents in J anuray, a Christmas party, house
dances, and picnics were other SAE social events.

SAE’S were also active in campus organizations.
Don Ewart was a member of Student Congress, Men’s
Council, Druids, ODK, and IF Council. Joe Wolfe,
chief justice of upperclass court, was vice president of
Men’s Council and Dick Lindley was a member of the

THIS year, as in every year, certain Seniors become symbols of the richness of col-
lege life; but of all the honors a Senior can attain, the greatest are these . . .

For the women——SENIOR QUEEN. She embodies the qualities and achieve-
ments of every Pitt woman. Alma Mater, second in esteem only to Senior Queen,
serves as chief attendant during Coronation. Elected by their classmates for their
character, personality, academic achievements, leadership in extra-curricular activ-
ities, and service to the University. Senior Queen and Alma Mater reign for one year.

For the men—ODK SENIOR AWARDEE. He is selected by a committee of
Omicron Delta Kappa members, for his intelligent leadership, personal integrity,
and intellectual honesty. Lasting recognition of his honor is the inscription of his
name on ODK walk between Heinz Chapel and the Cathedral of Learning.

For men and women—the OWL HALL of FAME. Hall of Fame is a lasting
tribute to the fame and integrity of twenty Senior students. They are selected by a
secret committee of junior men and Women on the basis of outstanding honesty,
leadership, and work, and they are representative of every phase of campus life.

SIGMA C HI

MOMENTARILY stunned by the loss of twenty-two ac-
tive brothers through graduation, the Sigma Chis have
begun to gain momentum in the direction of their for-
mer leadership status on the Pitt campus. Many broth-
ers have earned key positions in various political organ-
izations as well as in extra-curricular activities and
sports. Practically no stone has been left unturned by
the Sigs in their eagerness to see that they do their

share to further the ideals of the University.

Sigma Chi was founded at Miami University, Ox-
ford, Ohio, in 1855. Beta Theta chapter at Pitt obtained
its charter in 1909. In ninety-four years, Sigma Chi has
grown from one chapter to over one hundred and boasts
a membership of over sixty thousand.

Many Sigs are active in campus organizations.
ODK member Nick Laux, president of Engineering and
Mines Cabinet was voted the outstanding senior in
engineering. Dick Campbell is chairman of the Ap-
pointments Committee of Student Congress and presi-

dent of the Student Christian Federation. Jack Ingrim,
president of Pitt Players, is a member of ODK and
Theatron. ‘

As in the past, Sigma Chi continued to celebrate
socially throughout the entire year. The social season
got off to a ﬂying start with the Miami Triad formal at
the Roosevelt Hotel. This affair was soon followed by a
Bowery Brawl held on Armistice Day and designed to
please those who like to let their hair down.

After the Penn State game, Pitt Sigs played host
to their brothers from State at a party in North Park.
An orphan’s Christmas party, barn dances, an alumni
smoker, and a sweetheart dance rounded out Sigma
Chi’s social year.

THETA CHI

THETA CHI fraternity was founded in 1856 at Norwich
College, Norwich, Vermont. Since then it has grown into
a national fraternity with ninety-six chapters and over
thirty thousand living members.

Here at Pitt, Theta Chi was the ﬁrst of the fra-
ternities which were inactive during the war to return
to campus. Since its reactivation, Theta Chi has been
strengthening its position on campus with a strong
alumni group and a Mothers’ Club which is steadily
growing.

During the past year, Theta Chis have refurnished
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of their house and are now beginning to
transform the cellar into a game room. A committee
has been formed to work out the serving of meals on a
fraternity basis instead of on the cooperative plan
which is now in use.

Members of Theta Chi hold prominent campus

positions. Ray Maher is president of IF Council and a
member of Student Congress Bill MacLaren, Joe
Campbell, and Hank Racicot are Druids Pitt News
reporter Bob Thomas edits the IF newspaper and Al
Gioia is copy editor of the News. Dick Hohan is on the
cross country and track teams.

Theta Chi’s rushing period was a lively one includ-
ing a ranch dance, a Monte Carlo night, and a spaghetti
dinner, all held at the fraternity house at 4720 Bayard.
On the last Saturday of rushing, an informal dance was
held at the Roosevelt Hotel.

Numerous house parties, stags, a costume ball,
dances, and other events added up to a very busy and
enjoyable social season for Theta Chi.

Oﬂicers were: president, Ray Maher; vice presi-
dent, Ross Obley; secretary, Bill Ferguson; treasurer,

“I'r’s ON THE HoUsE” was the theme of Alpha Phi
Alpha’s year. The boys were remodeling their house
from roof to basement, and improvements were in
full swing Brother Charles H. Cuthbert was the
head of this all-absorbing program.

The boys forgot about work at parties and
dances. A capacity crowd attended the Harvest
Festival at the South Park Main Lodge during the
Thanksgiving holidays. It was complete with pump-
kins, corn stalks, and ﬁrelight. A joint stag affair
with the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, a “Can-Can
Dance” to collect canned foods for needy persons,
and the annual Coronation Ball were other memor-
able dates of the school year.

Alpha Phi Alpha was founded at Cornell Uni-
versity, Ithaca, New York, in 1906. Omicron, the
Pittsburgh chapter, was established in 1913. It is the
only interracial fraternity at Pitt.

Ofﬁcers for the year: president, Robert V. Haw-
kins; vice president, Richard S. Richards; secretary,
Isaiah David; treasurer, Lynn V. Hooe.

ALPHA PHI DELTA was founded at Syracuse University in 1914 for
men of Italo-American descent.

Active in IF sports, the twenty-ﬁve members of Nu Chapter
participate in football, basketball, swimming, bowling, ping pong,
and softball. Alpha Phi Deltas were also active in publications,
honorary fraternities, and athletics.

A full social calendar included smokers, picnics, dinners, for-
mals, and parties. One of the highlights of this year was the mass
initiation of pledges from the three city chapters of the fraternity
which was held in February.

Officers were: president, William M. Cavalcante; vice presi-
dent, Anthony Latona; recording secretary, Joseph Esposito;
corresponding secretary, Pat Avolio; treasurer, Lawrence Cresce.

LAMBDA CHI ALPHA

ON THE Pitt campus since 1919, the Gamma
Epsilon chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha represents
a national fraternity which has experienced
phenomenal growth since its founding, having 137
chapters through the United States and Canada.

This year, Gamma Epsilon moved full speed
ahead with a successful social calendar set up by
chairman Don Reed. The chapter enjoyed affairs
which began with a hay ride the ﬁrst week of
school, moved through a series of house dances
and parties, several of the ever-welcome stags, and
culminated in two seasonal formals and spring
festivities.

A promising alumni organization, to which Al
Capozzi, a brother in the University Law School,
acted as liaison also gave aid and counseling.

Ofﬁcers were: Bob Rossel, president; Bill
Parﬁtt, vice—president; Tom Lukasczyk, secretary;
and Bert Nevin, treasurer.

THE return of Sigma Alpha Mu to the campus in 1946, fol-
lowing an inactive period during World War II, found
one of the University’s oldest fraternities back at Pitt.
Sigma Alpha Mu came to the local campus on December 6,
1919, ten years after the fraternity was founded at CCNY,
by eight men who banded together to form an everlasting
bond of brotherhood.

Since the lean years that followed reactivation, Psi
chapter, one of forty-eight of the fraternity, has grown in
strength and power. During this rebuilding period, the
Sammies purchased their present house, located at 917 N.
Craig Street. Eager to make their home one of the most
beautiful houses on campus, the members have worked
hard on repairs and remodeling.

Sammies are active in University organizations. Schol-
astic honors have been bestowed on many members. Burt
Grossman is a member of the school’s baseball squad and
Bob Kaufman is head manager of the basketball team.

The Founders’ Day formal was held early in the win-
ter and a Spring Formal late in May. One of the important
functions of the fraternity is the annual Chanukah party
held for children from the Jewish Home for Babies.

Oﬂicers were: president, Alvin M. Bodek; vice presi-
dent, Bob Forman; secretary, Merle Moskowitz.

343

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

THE Pitt chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon, chartered at
the Western University of Pennsylvania in 1903, dis~
banded ten years later. In 1948 four Sig Ep transfer
students met for the purpose of reactivating Gamma
Chapter. Ofﬁcial installation and presentation of the
charter took place on April 9, 1949.

Sigma Phi Epsilon has made great progress during
its ﬁrst year of reactivation at Pitt. A full scale pledge
training program has been set up, and the chapter apart-
ment at 4508 Centre Avenue is easily identiﬁed by the
huge Sig Ep heart that lights the front of the building.

Two successful “hard times” parties were held
during the fall semester and a unique “monte Carlo”
night highlighted the rushing program in October.

Ofﬁcers for the year Were: president, Robert
Peary; Vice president, Don Semans; recording secretary,
Jack Paxton; corresponding secretary, Charles Warne;
treasurer, John Adams.

SIGMA P1

SIGMA P1 fraternity was founded at Vincennes Uni-
versity, Vincennes, Indiana, on February 6, 1897. Next
to the Miami Triad, it is the oldest national fraternity
East of the Ohio River.

Chi Chapter, chartered at Pitt in 1923 was reacti-
vated in February of 1948 with an initiation ceremony
at Penn State. Since then, the members of Chi have
been attempting to return Sigma Pi to its old status as
one of the leading fraternities on campus.

From the past year’s record, there is every indica-
tion that this revival is taking place more rapidly than
the brothers ever expected. Late in the Fall, Sigma Pi
was accepted as a full ﬂedged member of IF Council.
The fraternity has participated actively in the inter-
fraternity sports and social programs.

Officers Were: president, Henry F. Frey; vice
president, William Bailey; secretary, Roy J. Nelson;
treasurer, Allan Hennel.

ONE of the newest Greek letter social fraternities to be
recognized by ‘IF Council is the Stray Greek Club.
Founded in 1947, the Stray Greeks provide fraternity
aﬂiliation for transfer members of Greek letter frater-
nities which do not have chapters at the University.

The Pitt Chapter of the Club is Alpha because it
was the ﬁrst such organization on the records of the
National Interfraternity Council.

As members of IF Council, the Stray Greeks par-
ticipate in all activities sponsored by campus fraterni-
ties. Stray Greek athletic teams are prominent in IF
athletics and the members enjoy all social functions of
IF Council.

Stray Greek social events were many and varied.
Monthly parties and dances kept members busy
throughout the year and a Spring Formal closed social
activities for 1949-50.

Officers for the year were: president, Paul Herman;
vice president, George Eddinger; secretary-treasurer,
Felton Pienner.

kJOCIAL LIFE
L
SPRING FESTIVAL WEEK

Richard Cunningham,
Chairman

SPRING FESTIVAL, this mid-century year, gave Pitt
students an excuse for childish actions. Childhood Daze,
the most successful Festival Week in Pitt history, got
off to a ﬂying start with the dismissal of classes at noon
on Monday, May 15.

Mary Had a Little Lamb, Little Boy Blue and
many other famous nursery characters wound their
way past the judges’ stand in the Mother Goose Float
Parade Monday afternoon. Eleven more ﬂoats than in
previous years joined the Float Parade which circled
around Forbes and Morewood Avenues past Ellsworth
Center.

Suspense as to the winners of sorority, fraternity,
and organization ﬂoats was just as intense, but shorter
lived than in former years when cups were awarded at
the Comix Capers Tea Dance that same afternoon.
Sororities vied for the cup given to the booth best car-
rying out the Comic Strip theme. Original cartoons by
famous artists were raﬂled off to a record crowd at
the Tea Dance.

Fraternities clashed at two thirty Monday after-
noon and again the following afternoon at the Duck
Gamble and track meet at Schenley Park.

Forty-six organizations participated in Carnival
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings on the
Cathedral grounds facing Forbes Street. Last year’s

record attendance of nine thousand was shattered. Side
shows, melodrama, and pie throwing contests all car-
ried out the Toyland Theme. An innovation in this
year’s Carnival was the awarding of a cup to the best
show.

Jack and Jill entertained at sorority and fraternity
open houses Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon. Elab-
orate house decorations drew large numbers to the
various houses.

Even Pitt Players carried out the overall Child-
hood Daze theme in their presentation of A Connecticut
Yankee which offered, in addition to its Thursday and
Saturday night performances, a matinee Friday after-
noon.

The Pitt Chest was many dollars richer as a result
of Carnival guests stufﬁng their pennies into the favor-
ite Make Believe Sweetheart’s piggy bank. Every or-
ganization on campus submitted a candidate. Three
members of the Pittsburgh Pirates Baseball team, two
society editors, and a fashion expert narrowed the se-
lection down to sixteen ﬁnalists, eight boys and eight
girls. The two entries with the greatest number of
pennies were declared sweethearts at the Make Believe
Ball Friday night. Ray Anthony and his orchestra
provided the music at West View Park Danceland for
the Main Ball, highlight and ﬁnal event of Pitt’s great-
est Spring Festival.

SOPHOMORE HOP

THE social season got off to a great start with the
“Panther Prowl’” annual Sophomore Hop, held
this year at West View Danceland. The date was
October 14:, 1949, and the motif featured the foot-
ball season, just getting under way with the Pitt-
l\Iiami game the next afternoon. Over 200 couples
danced to the music of Lee Kelton and his orches-
tra, amid pennants, footballs, and goalposts. A
Panther cub was to be given as a door prize, but
according to Don Horowitz, publicity manager,
the cub disappeared the day of the dance. Don is
still seen about the halls searching for the baby
Panther. Chairman of the dance was, Jack Shano;
publicity, Don Horowitz; business manager, John
Hogan; ticket chairman, Carol Smith; decora-
tions, Liz Murphy.

F RESHMAN

THE Crystal Ballroom of the Schenley Hotel became
Chinatown for the evening of February 24, 1950, when
the Freshman Class held its annual dance. The theme
Was carried out all the way, even in the music, for Brad
Hunt and his orchestra mixed Chinese rice wine into
their “Musical Cocktail.” Len Casanova, Pitt’s new
head coach and “newest freshman” was invited to the
dance. For intermission entertainment the Hemi-Demi
Semi Quavers were imported to Chinatown. The Qua-
vers have a reputation for their novel presentations of
barber shop harmony. Chairman of the dance was Jim
Johnson; publicity, Jack Burwinkle; business manager,
Sam Rosen; decorations, Diane DeBolt.

THE Grand Finale, the ﬁrst All-University sponsored
affair, brought the social end of the football season on
November 19, 1949, after Pitt and Penn State had
made the oﬁicial close on the gridiron in the afternoon.
Visitors from Penn State were invited to the dance at
the Schenley Hotel as well as the Pitt student body.
Both ballrooms were opened to the huge crowd of
celebrators. Brad Hunt and his orchestra furnished the
music and treated all to a “Musical Cocktail.” Chair-
man for the dance was Marie Homisak; publicity, Bill
Moltz; business manager, Earl Jacobs; tickets, Margie
Beers; decorations, Margie Bell.

Hunt put the ﬁnishing touches to the

gridiron season at the Grand Finale dance.

Advance publicity helped make the dance a success.

E AND M DANCE

THE Engineering and Mines Association turned out en
masse, without slide rules, at West View Danceland on
November 11, 1949, for their annual dance—this year
the “TV Trot.” Skip Nelson, the former Glenn Miller
singer and Benny Benack and his Collegians provided
the music for the evening and brought back the Miller
style and spirit of dance music. At the intermission
phonomimic Bobby O’Neill entertained.

The high point of the evening featured the award-
ing of a table-model television set as a door prize. Ad-
mission was free to all members of the E & M Associa-
tion, and the dance was part of an attempt of E & M
to concentrate a drive for new membership. Chairman of
the dance was, Larry Eisenhauer; publicity, James Hunt;
business manager, Andy Kocak; tickets, Richard Jim.

MILITARY discipline relaxed for an evening when
cadets and “brass” rubbed shoulders at the annual
Military Ball, March 24. West View Danceland, which
housed the affair, was transformed into a night club
with small tables and chairs surrounding the dance
ﬂoor. Soft lights and the soft music of Charlie Spivak
completed the night club scene. Intermission entertain-
ment was on the top—ﬂight level With Skip Nelson, for-
mer Glen Miller vocalist, and Buddy O’Neill, the
phonomimic, performing. Special decorations for the
military formal included the insignias of the various
armed services, and special lighting. On the practical
side were free parking and checking facilities with addi-
tional personnel to hasten the process. Dignitaries in-
vited to the affair were Governor James Duff and Mayor
David Lawrence. Committees were headed by James
Lauble, Jack Neslage, Al Bierman, Art Ragen, Leo
Kairys, and John Shollar.

The intermission entertainment attracted large crowds.

HEART HOP

PITT’s annual leap year day came this year on February
17, 1950 with the women’s classes sponsoring Heart
Hop. The theme this year was “Blossom Time,” and
the Schenley Hotel Main Ballroom was decorated with
ﬂowers and a rose arbor at the entrance. The intermis-
sion began with a rhumba contest sponsored by the
Fred Astaire dancing school. The Varsity Quartet from
Men’s Glee Club were next on the entertainment list.
And ﬁnally the main event of the intermission was the
crowning of Chuck Provan as “Blossom Time King.”

F WINTER BALL

WINTER WONDERLAND was the theme of the Inter-
Fraternity Ball on December 9, 1949. The seventeenth
ﬂoor of the William Penn Hotel provided the Wonder-
land for the fraternity men and their dates. A triple
attraction in the musical lineup included Johnny Long,
Jack Fina, and Wes Parker with their orchestras in the
three ballrooms. For favors IF Council chose gold
scatter pins and small blue and gold programs. At inter-
mission the IF Sing winners were announced, and Pi
Kappa Alpha received the ﬁrst place trophy cup. VVin-
ter wonderland Was carried out in the decorations.

Again I welcome the opportunity to congratulate the young men and women who are graduating from

the University of Pittsburgh.
You will be going on to do a job in the world or to further formal education.

This is a world in which you will hear, as you have probably already heard, much criticism of the way

3
things are, and the way they are done in this country. Our way of doing things is not perfect. But we
shall continue to improve upon it so long as we keep what is becoming rarer and rarer throughout the world-

|NDlV|DUAL FREEDOM.

You were free to go to a school of your own choice; you are free to worship God as you please; you
may freely choose between those who may represent you in Government; you are free to meet with your
friends and your neighbors and express your views; in general, you have the maximum freedom to do as

you choose so long as you do not infringe upon the rights and privileges of others,

The great accomplishments of our country have grown from and been possible only because of this

freedom of the individual.

Whenever you’ hear the critics of our "system" with their proposals for changes, listen well and think
deeply and thoroughly of where their ideas and proposals lead. Before you adopt them be sure they do
not end in the state where so many people of the world find themselves today — their freedom as individuals

gone or greatly restricted. When this has happened, there can be no real "welfare," spiritual or material.

A Better L

Built Within Your Budget

§.ﬁ In these days, when prices are rising, those re-
sponsible for procuring a distinguished—looking year-
book are facing new and difficult problems. Technical
progress, however, is keeping pace with the need, and
hundreds of colleges and schools are turning to new
methods to produce better books at a truly reasonable

cost. Editors and advisers want these facts.

85:9»

Wm. J. Keller, Inc. of Buffalo, New York, has pio-
neered in so many of these new processes that we are
being called upon by more and more of the leading
universities and private schools every year, to help
solve their publication problems on the basis of our
long experience. Our experienced representatives are
thoroughly familar with all graphic processes.

just what is "Velvat0ne” Photo-oﬁset?

§.QTwenty years ago Wm. J. Keller Inc. began experi-
menting with new developments in photo-lithography
Thanks to constant improvements in equipment, ma-
terials and methods, we have gradually developed an
amazing reﬁnement of the process which gives results
equal or superior to the best letterpress printing, at a
lower cost. Velvatone is our trade name for this revolu-
tionary process. It offers surprising versatility, as
shown by the illustrations in this yearbook. It actually
gives you a better-looking yearbook at a lower price.

Large pictures are economical. You can afford plenty

of big halftones like those shown in the 1950 OWL.

Combination plates no problem. Lettering, pen-
drawing, or other “line” work can be easily combined
with “halftones.”

Angle pictures are easy. Any number at any angle,
at no extra cost.

One of the greatest advantages of Keller Velvatone,
is that it permits your art staff to “go to town.” Car-
toons, sketches, lettering, signatures, can be included
without the usual extra charge for plates. This is the
process that gives the greatest value in results.

Letterpress or Photo-oﬁset Printing .9

§g There has been considerable rivalry between these
two processes in recent years, and the question con-
stantly arises, “Which is better for this job?” We can
answer such questions with authority and without
prejudice. We have unusually complete equipment for
both processes, and have operated letterpress and
photo-offset departments for years. We have proved
by experience with thousands of yearbook orders that,
in the majority of cases, Keller Velvatone Photo-offset

will give you more for your money, and equal or better
quality, for this type of work. Yet we are in position to
use letterpress or combine the two processes in any
special cases. This yearbook was produced in its en-
tirety by Velvatone.

We welcome your questions concerning Keller Vel-
vatone Photo-Offset. Just phone or write us to have

the experienced Keller representative in your area

call on you—when convenient.

SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
ADMINISTRATION

     

this time.

Pic. on page 42: Bus Ad students prepare to follow
their last arrow-pointing maze to registration and grad-
uation. ‘

THE SCHOOL or BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION matches the
progressive economic needs of the nation with well
trained graduates equipped to combat the changing
trends of the business world.

The School of Business Administration has con-
stantly kept its reputation of being one of the highest
rated schools of its type in the country. The school uses
the Pittsburgh district as a great laboratory in which the
students can obtain a wealth of valuable practical
knowledge. Also emphasized is the policy of close associ-
tion between the University and business in the com-
munity. The Business Administration student is not
only taught the basic curriculum, but also the problems
which business faces and the changes it undergoes.

Their course is closely prescribed during the ﬁrst
two and a half years. It is during this time that the
general background is imparted to the student. During

the latter part of the junior and senior year, the stu-
dents of “bus ad” specialize. They can choose from

many diﬁerent ﬁelds such as accounting, economics,
statistics, advertising.

As in the case of all of the University schools, the
School of Business Administration is always seeking to
better itself and make new innovations. The newest is its
course on management problems for executives. While
only a three month course, the course gained recogni-
tion all over the country. Many different industries
were represented; for instance, one man came from
banking, two from coal, one from cement, one from the
dairy industry, one from construction, one from food
products, three from glass, eight from oil, one from rub-
ber, and many others.

Heading the school is Dean Vincent Lanfear who
always has time to talk with his students and advise
them in any Way he can.

With four years of specialized training, Bus Ad
graduates are ready to ﬁnd their places in today’s bus-
iness scheme.

The Commons Room also provides a
place for studying between classes.

Dr. Ferguson, well-liked economic professor,
lectures to his class.

THE COLLEGE

THE COLLEGE BECOMES COSMOPOLITAN and recognizes
the international scope of education by raising standards
in the l\Iodern Language department and by adding to
their broad curriculum a separate department for speech.

Graduates of the College not only have acquired a
liberal knowledge of the Arts and Social and Physical
Sciences, but are also basically prepared for further
professional training.

The College is the largest of the undergraduate
schools, but as early as the time of the Pittsburgh
Academy, the school has lead the students in their study
of liberal arts and sciences. Later, the school took over
the pre-professional students, allowing them to gain
groundwork for their graduate work.

Students get their fees calculated at registra-
tion.

College students get the answers at
the registrar’s oﬂice.

45

Campus activities, fraternities, and faculty con-
ferences are all ﬁtted into the College program with the
assistance of Dean Crawford and his staff.

Dean Crawford’s job is a tremendous one. He per-
sonally sees every single student in the College during
their Junior year in order to straighten out any schedule
entanglements or confusion. However, the Dean ad-
vises College students with the point of View that young
people must be given every opportunity for working out
their own careers. The College grants two degrees, one
in liberal arts and the other in science.

On looking back to the four years a senior spends
in College, there is a realization that those four years

will help him constantly the rest of his life.

SCHOOL OF EDUCATION

THIS YEAR THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION developed in-
creased improvements in the techniques of observation
and practice teaching. In addition to this, the School of
Education proudly adds Falk School recently purchased
by the University.

Recognizing the importance of sincere and earnest
workers in the development of the character and educa-
tion of youth, the School of Education stresses scholar-
ship, capability, and personality as qualiﬁcations.

Curriculum for the education student includes two
years in the College followed by two years of specialized
courses in the School of Education. This school is one
of the most extensive in the country because of its wide
variety of teacher training, ranging from elementary
and kindergarten to vocational and nurse’s training.

The ﬁnal test for the education student is a semes-
ter of practice teaching. During this time, the student
actually teaches in his particular ﬁeld whether it be
commercial, secondary, elementary, phys-ed. He pre-

pares lessons, gives tests and actually takes an appren-
ticeship in the teaching profession. During the time of
practice teaching, the student is almost forced to give
up his University activities because of the great amount
of time practice teaching requires. However, these
student teachers do not begrudge the time or the work,
for the experience is priceless.

Keeping stride with the advances in education is
Dean Samuel P. Franklin. Dean Franklin has been a
member of the University administration since 1943 and
in addition, represents the University as a member of
the National Education Conference. He has always
helped his future teachers to the best of his ability, both
in academic work, and in placing them in promising
positions.

Today’s School of Education graduate conﬁdently
faces the renovated educational system which calls for
instruction in psychology of students, new methods, and
improved techniques of teaching.

“Fingers curved, back straight”—student teaching takes com-
mercial students to a local high school typing class.

SCHOOL OF
ENGINEERING and MINES

ENGINEERING AND MINES MEET THE CURRENT TRENDS
by constantly improving the curriculum; this has in-
creased its reputation in schools throughout the
country.

The School of Engineering and Mines is second only
to the College in enrollment. The busy E & M students
work right through the summer inorder to facilitate
the great number of students interested in this school.

The School of Engineering and Mines is not con-
ﬁned torany one type of engineering. Included in the
school are the divisions of chemical, electrical, and me-
chanical engineering, all of which were ﬁlled to a capac-
ity this year. Going along with the new growth of the
school, the Acid Open Hearth Research Association, Inc.
recently renewed their research program in the Metal-
lurgical Engineering Department with a grant of about
$20,000. This is the eighth consecutive year for this

research project at the University.

The students, while separated pretty much from
regular campus life because of classes in lower campus
and Ellsworth Center, have a great deal of fun on their
own. Through their own governing body, Engineering
and Mines Cabinet, they have many aﬂ’airs during the
year such as dances and picnics. The battered Model-T
Ford that is the E & M publicity chairman, became
familiar to every student who attended the football
games.

Heading this great school is Dean Elmer A. Hol-
brook. Together with the aid of a highly competent
staff of instructors, the Dean was able to guide his
students through a complex curriculum.

Graduates in the School of Engineering and Mines

can assume responsibilities with greater conﬁdence in
their individual ability.
