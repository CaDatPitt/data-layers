The home of the University of Pittsburgh from 1854 to I890, a complex at the corner of Ross and Diamond streets. Opposite page:
The first home of the University, a cabin at Third and Cherry, downtown.

The University of Pittsburgh. An institution of higher
education which, as the United States of America celebrates
her 200th birthday, celebrates along as an institution just
eleven years her junior, an institution founded in 1787, one
hundred and eighty-nine years old today.

The history of the institution is indeed varied and color-
ful. Growing from its infant roots as an all-male log cabin

schoolhouse in a tiny frontier town some three hundred miles
west of the nearest “civilization” located in Philadelphia, the
University of Pittsburgh is today a major metropolitan univer-
sity complex serving some 33,000 male and female students a
year. With seven schools and four regional campuses, Pitt
brings to Western Pennsylvania, the “civilization” which two
hundred years ago was available only in Philadelphia.

The morning sky was marred by black thunderheads as
the tall trees swayed in the crisp autumn wind. Farmers raced
over small plots of ground cut out of the forest, flintlocks at
their sides in the wagons. If the fierce weather didn't force
them to leave, the sudden Indian raids would. The date was
September 17, 1787.

The Scotch-Irish frontiersmen of this tiny village of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania waited for the peal of the morning
breakfast bell. Eleven years earlier they had declared in-
dependence from the tyranny of English domination. Today,
the bell would mark an independence of another sort.

Philadelphia in 1787 was a large prosperous city.
Pittsburgh was but a small trading post settlement, the last
stop for Ohio trailblazers as they moved into the Northwest
Territory. On the edge of the unknown, Pittsburgh attracted
fugitives, the rowdy and the adventuresome. The majority of
its occupants were transients.

The tiny village had only thirty-six log cabins, no
churches, one clergyman, four lawyers, and one doctor. Along
the muddy streets, ramshackle, unpainted houses stood in a
row, filled with makeshift furnishings. The majority of its
citizens were ex-Revolutionary War officers stationed here to
defend the upper Ohio Valley, plus a number of farmers and
tavern owners.

The pack horse was the principal mode of transportation
and it wasn't until 1794 that the village passed an ordinance
prohibiting townspersons from allowing their hogs to run free
in the streets.

Day by day since the first family of settlers had arrived at
Fort Pitt in 1754, the need for a school had become more
acute. Today, September I7, 1787, that need would be filled.
Today, Pittsburgh would declare independence from
Philadelphia, educationally speaking.

In 1786, a trade school was opened in Pittsburgh by a
Mrs. Pride. A “Boarding and Day School for Young Ladies” had
met in her front parlor. There, prospective homemakers learn-
ed the skills of “plain work, coloured ditto, flowering,
lace-—both bobbin and needle, fringing, tabouring, and em-
broidering.” Before a girl could enroll, she had to read English
and knit.

The male was less fortunate. Despite occasional lessons
taught by traveling schoolmasters, the young boy of
Pittsburgh found himself unable to obtain any formal educa-
tion. The nearest institutions were two hundred to three hun-
dred miles away in Carlisle or Philadelphia. The iourney would
require passage through some of the roughest territory west of
the Alleghenies, and at a time of year they were most needed
at home for planting and harvest.

Hugh Henry Brackenridge, eminent lawyer, author, and
ardent Democrat had reflected on Pittsburgh in T786, “This
town must in‘ the future be a place of great manufactures, in-
deed the greatest on the continent, perhaps in the world.”

These initial views on the city by Brackenridge brought
him to the belief that the small town needed four things
before it could fulfill its destiny. The Princeton graduate saw
the need for a newspaper, an English-speaking church, a
college, and status as a county seat.

The home of the University of Pittsburgh (known then as Western University of Pennsylvania) on
Perrysville Avenue. Pitt stayed here for eighteen years (1890-1908) before moving to Oakland.

Pitt in I789

The students attending Pitt in 1789, the year
the Constitution of the United States was sign-
ed, were the sons of farmers and fur traders
from outlaying districts. No women attended.

Tuition was£5 a year, while one could find
board for£20. The students were attentive to
classes while seated on split log benches, taking
notes with their goose quill pens. There was no
keeping up with a fast lecturer in those
days—the pens had to be dipped in homemade
ink boiled from oak and sumac bark.

Flyers describing the curriculum at the time
promised that “students are to be taught to
read English according to the most approved
method, and English grammar; writing
Arithmetic and Bookkeeping; the Latin, Greek,
and French languages; Rhetoric, and Belles let-
tres; Geography, and the most useful parts of
the Mathematics: to which will be added an in-
troduction to Natural, civil, and Ecclesiastical
History, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Logic,
Moral Philosophy, and Chronology."

The announcement also noted that “the
lower class will be taught Orthography
agreeable to the standards of first taste. A
French and Dancing Master will also attend, for
those who may wish their children instructed in
these graceful parts of a polite education.”

And instead of the Board of Trustees passing
resolutions pertaining to football tickets and tui-
tion hikes, The 1789 trustees passed a resolution
forbidding students to duel with one another or
to carry weapons into the classroom.

One of the first things that he did was to bring in John
Scull, Joseph Hall, a printing press and some type from
Philadelphia. The manpower and machinery enabled him to
start the Pittsburgh Gazette. He then used this paper as a tool
to obtain his other desires.

After the paper had earned Brackenridge a seat in the
State Assembly, he accepted responsibility for incorporating
the Presbyterian congregation in Pittsburgh in 1787 and for
creating Allegheny County in 1788, Pittsburgh being named
as the county seat.

In a Gazette column of September 2, 1786 entitled
“Observations on the Country at the Head of the Ohio River
with Digressions on Various Subiects", Brackenridge laid out
his case for education in the frontier town. “Academies are the
furnaces which melt the natural ore to real metal; the shops
where the thunderbolts of the orator are forged. The function
of the town of Pittsburgh is greatly to be chosen for a seat of
learning; the fine air, the excellent water, the plenty and
cheapness of provisions render it highly favorable."

Breckenridge also argued his case before the Penn-
sylvania legislature (which met in the State House in
Philadelphia). Pittsburgh should have a school, he told his
fellow legislators, because it was wanted by the people;
because the Pennsylvania Constitution dictated that public
schools be erected in every country; because the establishment
of a school in Pittsburgh would introduce money to Penn-
sylvania from the whole frontier country; and because the
strength and dignity of government rests on the education of
its people.

The Scotsman ran into immediate opposition from another
legislator, William Findley. Findley published an article
“Observations Upon the Address of Hugh Henry Brackenridge,
Esq. to the Inhabitants of the Western Country." In the article,
Findley argued correctly that the proposed school was illegal
since it held neither property nor endowment.

Realizing that he was temporarily outdone, Brackenridge
returned to his constituents and promised them that the deal
was not over.

Master plan: Old Engineering, Thaw, Allen, Pennsylvania, the Mineral Industries Building, and Alumni.

A new administration, different students, changing designs and cost factors contributed to the campus
we now know. It's interesting to see how it might have looked.

landscape.

Three thousand acres of land were then on sale along the
northern shore of the Allegheny River, across from the location
of the Fort. Despite his promise to his people “not to be forget-
ful of obtaining" what he could of the land, the deal fell
through for lack of funds.

Not despairing, Brackenridge quickly turned to the Penn
family and accepted as a gift for the proposed Academy, four
lots making up a square block bounded by Smithfield, Cherry,
Second and Third Streets. The acreage was known as Ewalt's
Field. (The site today is occupied by Kaufmann’s parking gar-
age, down town, and is marked by a plaque mounted on the
side of the building. All of the original structures were
destroyed by the Great Fire of 1845).

The final obstacle to be mounted before the bill could
pass the assembly was procurement of an endowment. The
clever statesman persuaded the legislature into a grant of five
thousand acres of unappropriated wilderness land in
Lawrence and Butler counties. Few realized that Brackenridge
would sell them for nineteen thousand dollars, to be used as
the endowment. The session was also busy with other
matters, including the selection of delegates to the Continen-
tal Congress, which was to debate revisions to the Articles of
Confederation, and possibly draft a new constitution for the
country. Pennsylvania governor Ben Franklin was in atten-
dance at that session.

All obiections clear, the bill quickly passed and the
legislators went on to more pressing work, the revision of the
Articles of Confederation. Their efforts were culminated the
same morning that the new school opened. On September ‘I7,
1787 the convention delegates signed the new Constitution of
the United States of America.

Six male students abandoned the excitement of the fron-
tier town to attend sessions in what has become the oldest in-
stitution of learning, excepting the University of Nashville,
west of the Appalachians. Sam Semple’s Tavern along the
Monongahela was filled with the towns leading citizens, who
had stopped to talk and pick up any mail that incoming
travelers may have brought them. (There was no postal ser-
vice then). You could make payments in “cash, country
produce, or ginseng (a type of herb)” at John Ormsby's
General Store. He carried men's and women's cotton or
worsted hose, corduroys, velvets, gloves, superfine broadcloth,
snuffboxes, and an assortment of saddle ware and bar iron.
His terms led a stranger to exclaim that Pittsburgh was
“infested by a combination of pensioned scoundrels who
made a business of cheating and overcharging strangers.”

Only history knows who those six boys were who paid
the annual tuition of $13.60 as they entered the log
schoolhouse, checking their guns at the door and pushing

knives into their boots as they took their seats on the split log
benches. The Great Fire of 1845 destroyed all records. The
term ran from the end of harvest to the beginning of planting
season. The schoolhouse was constructed of logs stuffed with
mud, the cabin having only one room with a fireplace and a
little alcove where boys could hang their guns. The school
desks were boards fastened to the wall along the windows,
boards which were dropped down at night when the
schoolroom doubled as a schoolmaster’s meeting room and as
his bedroom. The seats were backless split-log benches with
the split side up.

After classes, the new students faced a four mile trip
back across town, which meant more than an hour's hike
through some of the roughest Indian country known. They nor-
mally headed for the safety of the fort, and then down liberty
Street, a dirt road lined with small taverns and wooden hut
stores peddling blankets, match coats, hats, looking glasses,
knives, beads and bracelets of glass, all manner of rough-
hewn toys for children, guns, flints, powder and lead, and
kegs of rum used to barter with the Indians. Water Street was
filled with wagons loaded with vegetables on the way to the

morning market. John Scull was busy all over town dis-
tributing the Gazette. Within three years, a new postal system
would perform those duties, but 'til then, Scull was the
Gazette's editor, publisher, and delivery boy.

The trustee-incorporators of the new school included the
most distinguished citizens of the area. There were six
Presbyterian ministers (five of them graduates of Princeton),
four Army officers who had seen duty in the Revolutionary
War, five lawyers and two physicians. Among them were the
Reverend John McMillan, Colonel Pressley Neville, Dr.
Nathaniel Bedford, Colonel William Butler, David Bedford
(who later fled to Louisiana in 1794 for his part in the Whiskey
Rebellion), James Ross (who taught at the Academy and later
became an early U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania) and the
Reverend Joseph Smith, known as “Hell-Fire Smith”.

George Welch, the first principal, felt the students should

learn practical lessons such as Indian sign language, fencing,
fighting, and of course, English and mathematics. The
curriculum was well adapted to the area's needs. For exam-
ple, when construction was under way in the city,
mathematics advanced to straight engineering proportions.
There were no books.

By 1790, the Academy had expanded enough to warrant
larger quarters. A brick structure was constructed near the
original cabin, using interest from a $5000 direct grant from
the state legislature, as payment for the two-story building.
The cabin continued to serve as the schooImaster’s home.

In the ensueing years, two very distinguished professors
replaced Welch. They were James Mount and Robert Patter-
son. Their ioint efforts ensured the continued growth of the
young institution.

In 1805 Joseph Stockton was named principal and a
company of men petitioned the legislature for a charter, which
would give the school full university powers. It was also
specified that neither race nor creed should warrant dis-

crimination and instructors should have both the ability and a
high moral standing.

On February 19, 1819 the Academy became the Western
University of Pennsylvania. At the same time, the state
legislature granted the new University fifty acres of land in
Allegheny as an incentive to learning. This was later com-
muted to $2400 annually for five years. A new structure and
an exceptional faculty were now possible.

Dr. Bruce was named the first president and served from
1822 until I843. Reverend Herman Dyer, his successor, ex-
perienced difficulties whenever the sole University building
was destroyed in the Great Fire of I845. Struggling to keep
the University alive, a new structure was completed in I846,
only to meet the same fate in 1849.

It wasn't until 1854 that a new building was raised at
Ross and Diamond Streets, and under the leadership of Dr.
John F. Mclaren enrollment grew steadily. There were twelve
classrooms on the first and second floors, with a chapel on the
third. Settees were the only furnishings. Beginning with a

Pitt at Diamond and
Ross. . .1870

The Pitt student graduating in
1870 wouldn't recognize today's
campus or policies.

In 1870, all teaching was done
by recitations, and few, if any,
classes were taught by lecture.
Classes were held only in the
morning. Examinations were held
quarterly, with the rules requiring
that a professor not test his own
class. A professor of Greek might
be found testing chemistry
students.

The Chancellor of the Universi-
ty by authority of the Board of
Trustees had full control over
what was taught and how it was
taught. Chapel exercises were
held each Wednesday morning
and were followed by a lecture
given by a prominent citizen of
the community or an outstanding
student. Subjects always concern-
ed ideals befitting a young
American.

Co-educational activities had
not been thought of in I870. Stu-
dent activities were few. Two
literary societies, the
“Philomatheau” and the “|rving”
were popular. Whenever the
University moved to the North
Side location, a third one, the
“Franklin” was formed. A
forerunner of today's honorary
societies, students had to have
high academic standing for
membership. The student
members of these societies
published “The College Journal”,
a collection of prose and poetry.

bequest from Robert Watson, a library
collection grew. By 1870, there were
three courses open to students: the
Classical (four years); the Scientific
(three years) and Engineering (four
years).

The University faculty in 1875 in-
cluded ten members and there were no
assistants or instructors before 1881.
Many distinguished scholars came to
the new University as its first faculty.
Samuel P. Langley was Professor of
Astronomy and Director of the Obser-

 . ‘*3.

vatory. Wealthy businessmen pooled a
fund which enabled Langley to become
the first faculty member with no
teaching duties.

Using the superior instruments of the
facility, he was to devote his entire time
to astronomical research. Langley
developed a reputation as a recluse
among those who knew him but slight-
Iy. To those who knew him well, he em-
bodied all the qualities of an excellent
faculty member. He was kind, sym-
pathetic, full of interest in literature but
burdened with an intense desire for

‘results which should develop new

truths in his strenuous labors. From
Pittsburgh, Langley moved to
Washington to accept the post of Direc-
tor of the Smithsonian Institute.

John W. Langley, professor of
Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology is
responsible for introducing the first
laboratory courses at the school.
Donations from Thomas Hind and John
Harper enabled the school to purchase
the latest equipment. A gymnasium
was erected in April of 1863. In ‘I871,
William Thaw promised a million
dollars to the University if the people of
Western Pennsylvania would match. it,

which they did by I875.

One of the most valuable assets was
a collection of geological specimens
donated by Reverend Joseph Travelli.
The collection consisted of over four
thousand mineral specimens, all of
which moved to Oakland in l908.

Until the beginning of the year 1890
the Western University of Pennsylvania
consisted of the college and the
Preparatory School. Two district
faculties taught, with boys twelve or
older eligible to enroll in the Prep school
to prepare for college level courses.
Faculty meetings were held weekly.
Topics for discussion varied widely, as
they do now.

In 1872, the School of Law was
opened and has built a reputation
nationally. The dedication of the new
structure and facilities on the Oakland
campus this year should enable that
reputation to grow even greater in the
future.

Forty-four students enrolled in the
first class of the Pittsburgh College of
Pharmacy in 1878. Meeting in the
chemical lecture room of the old Univer-
sity, Dr. Henry Stevens, Dr. W.C. Reiter
and F.C. Phillips taught the first lessons.

youth of yesteryear.

Growing weary of the congested,
dirty city, the trustees were more than
anxious to sell the downtown property
to the Allegheny County Commissioners
after the county courthouse burnt to the
ground in 1882. Sold for $80,000, the
building was stripped of furnishings
and equipment, which were moved
across the river to a site on North
Avenue in Allegheny City (now
Pittsburgh's North Side). It was here
that the famous Pitt yell “Allegenee-e-
e-e” originated.

Dr. McCracken, serving as chancellor
began the move. His transfer to become
President of New York University open-
ed the door for Milton P. Goff to com-
plete construction of the Northside cam-
pus. Once completed, new and broader
ideas were adopted, with the establish-
ment of full courses in chemistry and
engineering conducted in large
laboratories. The Preparatory School
was discontinued. The sudden death of
Goff advanced Dr. William J. Holland to
the chancellorship in 1892.

This term was to mark the third
great achievement of the University.
Holland brought it to this milestone by
establishing graduate studies. The
Engineering School was enlarged to in-
clude instruction in mining and electrici-
ty. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania
Medical College was merged with the
University. The founding of the Dental
Department in 1896 found the institu-
tion with seven distinct departments.

Holland also handled a student up-
rising of major proportions. After some
vandalism during Dr. Holland's
absence, the dean suspended the entire
iunior class and the other three classes
walked out in sympathy.

l7

 

~¢Q!&“;u>M‘

The returning Dr. Holland paid the
iunior class fine and became part of the
1889 class slogan, “Holland, he pays
the freight".

After a spectacular eight year
tenure, Holland resigned in 1900 to be
replaced by Dr. John A. Brashar. Per-
sonal business interests compelled that
he also resign in 1904, despite his
valiant attempts to carry on. Dr.
Samuel Black McCormick became the
elected Chancellor.

When he was elected to office, the
University was rapidly approaching
another milestone. The student body
numbered over nine hundred; the
faculty one hundred and forty; the
alumni two thousand and five hun-
dred; endowments were approaching a
half a million dollars; and property

 

 

valued at more than one million.

On July 11, 1908 the Western
University of Pennsylvania became the
University of Pittsburgh. Three months
later, on October 2, 1908, Dr. McCor-
mick laid the cornerstone for the first
University building on the Oakland
campus, the School of Mines. The cor-
nerstone for Soldiers and Sailors Hall
was set on the same day.

Oakland was perfect as a building
point for the University; all

departments and schools could be un- .

ified. A magnificent array of Gothic
structures were designed, at an es-
timated cost of $10,000,000. McCor-
mick attempted earnestly to raise the
money, and completed the construction
of three buildings by 1911.
“Oakland” was the area of Schenley

issue reports that in 1836 James
Chadwick sold his one hundred and six-
ty nine acre farm. B.A. Fahnstock, a
physician, purchased a few plots and
named it Oakland.

As downtown expanded and
became more congested, population
shifted toward Oakland. In 1886, the
city annexed Oakland township. The
area was still largely undeveloped com-
mercially. Many estates were still in-
tact, the largest belonging to Mrs. Mary
Schenley, the great grand-daughter of
George Groghan, who had received
200,000 acres of land from the Indians
in 1749. In 1889, Mrs. Schenley
donated 300 acres to the city for the
park which bears her name. In the late
1890's, Andrew Carnegie built a
museum, library and lecture hall on the
estate. He also gave a $1 million dona-
tion to build the Carnegie Institute
nearby. Next he offered the city money
to construct and staff a technical school
east of his museum. The school opened
in 1905, and in 1912 was granted a
charter giving it authority to award ad-
vanced degrees under the name
Carnegie Institute of Technology.

Old northside neighbors, the Pirates,
came to Oakland and Forbes Field in
1909. The next decade found Oakland

Always‘a sports power, the University has fielded championship
teams since the turn of the century in more than twelve sports. On

Field, in 1919, between Pitt and Penn State. Pitt won this event by
seven points.

undergoing rapid growth as a civic
center. Soldiers and Sailors Hall, the
Syria Mosque, the Masonic Temple, and
the Bureau of Mines now had head-
quarters in Oakland.

The University was also growing. In
1911, enrollment was two thousand
three hundred. By ‘I921, it had bound-
ed to fourteen thousand. Pitt was now
home for more than half of all students
in higher education from Western Penn-
sylvania. In 1921 when John Gabbert
Bowman became chancellor, the
University was crowded into one-fourth
the space it needed for laboratories, of-
fices and classrooms. The school was
deeply in debt. The first summer
sessions had been introduced in 1912.
The first evening school, the School of
Business Administration, the School of
Education and the Extension Division
had become integral parts of the un-
iversity mission.

Expansion was needed on a larger
scale for the “Academy" had outgrown
even the fondest dreams of its creators.
Studies showed that eight or ten larger
buildings would be necessary to serve
the ever expanding needs of the school.
Estimates of the gigantic expense of
construction and maintenance of such a
building program and the difficulty of
finding a suitable site, prompted Bow-
man toward an alternate solution. The
“Acropolis” plan was scratched and
plans made to build the University up
instead of out were drawn up.

Despite constant opposition, even
from the Board of Trustees, Chancellor
Bowman held out for his dream. He
accepted a donation of a fourteen acre
tract known as “Frick Acres”. He en-
visioned a high tower which in addition
to housing classrooms and ad-
ministrative offices, would serve as a
visible symbol of an emerging
metropolitan University.

Bowman insisted that “the structure
is to be . . . forceful, unafraid, sub-
lime, with a sense of upwardness. Its
lift, buttress after buttress, rising, but
never arriving at a spire, will suggest
force enough to go still beyond . . . to
go ahead in a physical world and in a
world of spirit." Philadelphia architect
Charles Z. Klander finally produced a
three inch sketch of the Chancellor's

  

dream at a meeting which lasted until
4 A.M.

Women's groups opposed the tower
citing as arguments fears that students
would tumble from the high windows
as the structure swayed in the breeze.
Others opposed the University under-
taking such a massive project when in
such debt.

Undaunted and still committed,
Bowman raised more than nine million
in contributions for the structure. Cor-
porate contributions, then a new idea,
led the way. Ninety-seven thousand
school children made ten cent con-
tributions and received certificates.

The effort began to attract nation
wide attention, including a full-page
spread in the New York Times.

Bowman sent bulldozers to the scene for an unan-
nounced ground-breaking in early i926. A lawsuit over the
Darlington bequest caused delays and a shortening of the
structure by ten stories. Bowman had planned a 52-story
building, which was now cut to 42. To prevent further
shortening, Bowman ordered masons to begin work at the top
and proceed downwards. Federal monies enabled workers to
finish the exterior stonework by 1934.

Insisting on a pay-as-we-go method, Bowman had in-
curred no further debts. The exterior of the Cathedral defined
a gross volume of more than 9,000,000 cubic feet. It was
designed to house 91 classrooms, 67 teaching labs, 52
research labs, l3 large lecture rooms, 15 departmental offices
and 78 faculty offices. It also contained space for the faculty
club, student lounges, the University library (three floors) and
a cafeteria and a theater. The forty-second floor is the glass-
walled Babcock Room, where administrative bodies sit in
council.

Dr. Bowman had invited Pittsburgh's nationality groups
to decorate and furnish the seventeen classrooms which circle
the great Commons Room. Designed by architects abroad, the
rooms are unique. Each room captures an important period in
the history of that nation.

The first rooms were dedicated in 1938. The final one,
The Irish Room, was dedicated in 1957. Today, the African
Heritage Room is being planned alongside the Early American
Room on the third floor. When complete, twenty cultures will
be represented. The committees continue to this day to sponsor
lectures, exhibits, exchange students and scholarships for
students and faculty. They also decorate the rooms on holidays
according to Old World style.

Dedication ceremonies for the Cathedral, never officially
named, were held in June of 1937. Dr. Bowman's dream was
at hand, and his words, embedded on the Common’s Room
cornerstone, convey his feelings. “They shall find wisdom
here, and faith. In steel and stone, in character and thought,
they shall find beauty, adventure, and moments of high vic-
tory.” The 535 foot high Cathedral of Learning was on its
way. Today, the upper floors remain incomplete, and money is
still going into the structure.

Dr. Rufus Fitzgerald succeeded Bowman as Chancellor
and worked hard to bring Pitt to academic greatness. He in-
troduced Phi Beta Kappa to the campus, and established ties
with many other organizations and societies.

Pitt had attracted the majority of its students from
western Pennsylvania, many from Pittsburgh, and was dubb-
ed, because of this, the “Trolley College”. Today, over 67% of
the student body are commuters.

The efforts of Fitzgerald were continued by the successor,
Edward H. litchfield. Taking the helm in 1955, he wanted to
propel Pitt into a position of national prominence among the
great academic institutions of the world. Upgrading student
standards, seeking and winning distinguished faculty, doubl-
ing salaries and doubling the size of the faculty were means
toward the goal of greatness. Litchfield is responsible for the
large international student body which exists today. His en-
couragement of twenty years ago finds Pitt with represen-
tatives from I85 countries. (The U.N. has but 145.)

The concentrated drive toward greatness put the Univer-
sity in financial straights. In 1965, two chancellors, Stanton
Chapman Crawford and David Harold Kurtzman eased Pitt
into public ownership, going state-related.

The 15th Chancellor took over in June of 1967. Dr.
Wesley Wentz Posvar works to this day to fulfill his inaugural
pledge. “The University, because it is more stable and more in-
dependent than governments and corporations, will become
the creative eye for new society—for its communications
systems, its social patterns, and its political and economic
structure. This I submit . . . is the keynote of the next major
stage of advancement of the University of Pittsburgh.”

Posvar has retired the massive debts. He is leading the
University on to greatness. Today Pitt is a metropolitan Univer-
sity with 15 schools and ‘I0 maior centers. Boasting an inter-
national student body of over 35,000 on the Oakland and four
regional campuses, the school is the second largest employer
within the city limits; 2000 administrative personnel, 2000
full time faculty, 500 part-time faculty and 500 part-time
technical and professional support persons. The faculty
teaches more than 770,000 student credit hours each year.
Over $25 million dollars worth of research is conducted each
year, resulting in major scientific breakthroughs, including the
Salk polio vaccine in 1953, the synthesis of ACTH by Klaus
Hofmann in ‘I961 , the synthesis of insulin by P. Katsoyannis in
1964, and the gonorrhea vaccine by C. Brinton in 1976,
among tens of others.

The University also supports and staffs one of the most
advanced medical centers in the country. Magee-Women's,
Montefiore, Presbyterian-University, Childrens, Eye and Ear
and Western Psychiatric provide care for thousands.

Posvar is also responsible for a massive building proiect,
begun in the early seventies and to be completed early next
year. The 120 acre main campus is now serviced by 50
buildings. Current construction is valued at $55 million.

The log cabin college has come a long way.

Goodbye Tuck. . .

Many students coming back to Pitt this year notice a big
change—The old familiar Tuck Shop in the Cathedral of Lear-
ning basement has been transformed into a bright orange and
yellow Burger Chef. To some it was a welcomed improvement
but to many it was the end of a tradition.

For decades the Tuck Shop served generations of students
who stopped for a cup of coffee or something to eat. Fraternity
brothers made it their place to meet.

“Burger Chef”, winner of the bidding among three firms
that originally sought the contract, had a very disorganized
and slow start but seemed to pick up steam towards the mid-
dle of the year. Many students think that the new establish-

ment, with it’s bright colors, has better service, better food,
and a nicer atmosphere. Others miss their old hangout and
the wooden benches and round tables. Why the change?

last year when the Pitt Administrators watched the Tuck
Shop lose $10,000 to $20,000, the change was just a matter
of economics. Now Pitt operates the facility on a profit basis.
Pitt gets ten per cent of the gross sales, which may triple last
year's sales. The fifty students, who have replaced the former
Tuck Shop employees, have this year debated the question of
organixing their own union. The fourteen displaced workers
were placed in other university iobs.

AN EXPANDING CAMPUS . . .

The Professional Quadrangle, built
at an estimated cost of 37 million
dollars, will be opened in late winter or
early spring of 1977. The Quadrangle,
which covers 773,000 square feet, will
service the School of International
Public Affairs and the School of Educa-
tion along with seven other
departments.

The interior containing five
elevators, ten electric stairways, 2700
linear feet of movable walls and
carpeted offices and lecture halls, was
designed by four architects and one
engineer.

Constructed of concrete, brick and
limestone, the building has two gar-
ages and is connected to the litchfield
Towers patio by an overhead walkway
crossing Forbes Avenue.

The Professional Quadrangle was
built for the University by the General
Services of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

28

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

This summer the new School of Nursing building
will be opened over the parking garage facing
Lothrop Street.

The metal clad building contains two elevators,
ten electric stairways, three large lecture halls and
connects all nursing student buildings, including
the Lothrop Residence Hall.

The Department of General Services of the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania built the school at an
estimated cost of eight million.

. . . AN EVER CHANGING FACE.

The Pitt campus has been un-
der construction for well over ten
years. The massive building
program initiated by then
Chancellor Edward litchfield has
been carried on by Chancellor
Wesley Posvar, and will reach
fulfillment in September of 1977
when the Professional Quad is
completed.

A long way from the Gothic
paradise once proposed, the cam-
pus is a cluster of imposing iron
and cement structures of the
latest designs, serving more than
12,000 undergraduates. The
facilities support a total of 30,000
plus including faculty, students
and staff.

As a part of the new law School building proiect, a
pedestrian bridge over Forbes Avenue was installed for the
safety of students.

When all construction is complete, the bridge will connect
university residence halls, David Lawrence Hall, the Law
Building, the Professional Quad and Hillman library.

THE PEOPLE

33

34

The People. Pitt People. Pitt is
people. After arriving at the
Oakland campus, it soon becomes
apparent to the freshman that
Pitt had best have more to offer
than a beautiful, green retreat for
four years. Oakland is not a
beautiful, green retreat.

True, we do have the tallest
schoolhouse in the world. And we
do have a new Law School and
Chem Building. Next year,ythe
nurses will attend classes in a
new unit. Also, the Professional
Quad will soon be operational.

Yet, Pitt is not a complex of
massive structures. It is people.
Spend some time in Oakland
between terms, and you will
quickly discover that “Pitt” is not
there. It's home for the break. The
place is deathly quiet. The cars
move quietly through the streets,
no longer dodging people. Doors
fall closed as one passes through
them, no longer propped open by
the constant volley of human
hands. The classrooms of the
Cathedral are colder than usual.
Customers can park in the Quad
while banking. The air outside
the Towers is still, no longer filled
by the drone of constant chatter-
ing. “Pitt” is home for a holiday.

And so on these pages we
feature Pitt. Glances at the real
make-up of the University. The
People. Pitt People.

was an explosion. Just as the first scene
depicts the discovery of the transformation of metal by a
medieval alchemist, so did the production find itself on center
stage showing the transformation of the city of Pittsburgh.
The entire production took as much hard work, sweat of the
brow, and stupendous energy as the steel workers and city
people they represented had offered. STEEL/CITY was unusual
in that the dialogue was taken from actual historical
documents and interviews. In Act I, the settlers were shown
trying to create a civilization out of the three rivers wilderness.
After a quarter of a century, Pittsburgh was thelron City. The
act ends as Pittsburgh celebrates the U.S. Centennial. In Act II,
strikes become common and the flow of immigrants increases,
leading to the massive Homestead Strike of 1892. A fictional
dialogue between Andrew Carnegie and the philosopher
Herbert Spencer closes the act with an explaination of the
philosophy of the period between the centuries. In the final
act, local residents re-create the era at the Pensioner’s Picnic of
1975.

Steve Stills provided the entertain-
ment for the Homecoming Concert. He
played in the Syria Mosque to a sell-out
crowd on the night of the big football
game with Navy.

Stills pleased his audience by perfor-
ming a rich mixture of his golden oldies
and latest hit singles.

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

Once again, Pitt hosted the
Fifth Annual Jan Seminar for
music educators, professional
musicians, and students.

Assistant professor of music
Nathan Davis served as seminar
director. Many distinguished jazz
musicians served on the faculty,
including Jaki Byard (piano),
Kenny Burrell (guitar), Richard
Davis (bass), Louis Hayes (per-
cussion), Joe Henderson (tenor
saxophone) and Sonny Stitt (alto
and tenor saxophone).

The three day event was
capped by a jazz concert featur-
ing the faculty.

The purpose of the three day
event is to determine better
methods of teaching jazz, and to
assist high schools and colleges in
the preparation of jazz
curriculums.

The annual Halloween Costume Disco Dance was held on
Halloween Night in the Student Union Ballroom. Several student
organimtions worked together as the dance served as a kick-off

The third annual “Day in the Park”
was held September 13, a cold and

The crowd that came early heard the
National Stew and Grinderswitch per-

in vain attempts to warm themselves.
Sporadic frisbees and a lonely kite
broke through the gray sky. A solitary
girl boogied to the music-up on the Hill.

By the time the feature attraction,
the Earl Scruggs Revue arrived, half of
the fans had left, the other half had
nearly frozen.

Still the father-son team brought
Flagstaff Hill alive with their pickin’
and strummin’: Bluegrass, blues,
honky-tonk, and gospel tunes had the
crowd up, dancin’ and clappin’.

The Place. Pitt. Oakland, a mile and a half from
downtown Pittsburgh.

Certainly not one of the most beautiful campuses
you might choose to attend. Grass-covered expanses are
absent. You can't watch wildlife (except for an oc-
casional chippie). There's no fresh air in Oakland, thanx
to the Hazelwood mills and the Oakland traffic conges-
tion.

Yet Oakland does add to an education. It's an im-
portant element in the educational objectives of a major
metropolitan university.

The campus serves as a meeting place for Pitt. The
people. In Oakland, people are forced together. Interac-
tion becomes spontaneous. It becomes difficult to bump
elbows with 30,000 people a day and not be affected.

The campus also does afford the opportunity to
retreat from the crowd, quiet little coves nestled
amongst the bustle . . . a corner in the Commons,
maybe the far side of the Cathedral, or under a tree on
Flagstaff.

And so, on these pages we look at the Place. The
noise, the cement, the crowds, the cozy corners. This is
Oakland. The Place. Pitt.

Derby Day is an annual event sponsored by Sigma Chi fraternity. This
year it was held over the weekend of October 31.

Derby Day is really two days of fun for the sisters of Pitt's sororities.
Competition in such ludicrous events as three-legged races, pyramid building,
and tricycle runs provide an opportunity for merriment. The main event of the
weekend finds the sisters attempting to snatch the derby from the head of an
unsuspecting brother.

The sixth annual Black Week, sponsored by BAS, was
held during the week of November 10, 1975. The theme was
Reflections, Ubiquity, and Progressions. Two of the prominent
speakers of the week, comedian and political activist Dick
Gregory and author James Baldwin spoke on the government
of the country and its effects on the population. Mr. Gregory's
topics ranged from the world food problem, to the aristocratic
ruling of government, to the JFK assasination.

The week also attracted various performing groups. The
Howard University Choir performed with the Pitt's Gospel
Choir—Some of God's Children, David Mathee’s PRODUCTION
was a kalidescope of poetry, music, and dance featuring Car-
malinda Elmore and Kurt Herring.

The BAS theater presented “Lucifer’s Boogie” an original
play which dealt with social awareness of the modern block.
A one act play entitled “Depth of Her Star” dealt with contem-
porary youth in the South. There was an Awards/Variety
Show, recognizing achievement in talent, fashion design and
scholastic ability. The week ended with concerts by Main
Ingredient, and Grover Washington, Jr.

ENGINEERS’ WEEK

Engineers’ Week has been a tradition at Pitt since
1954. It grows out of cl practice started at the University
of Missouri in 1903.

A group of engineering students there felt like a
vacation from the drudgery of the winter term. They
claim to have received a revelation that St. Patrick was
an engineer. To celebrate the fact, classes were cancell-
ed and the students engaged in various forms of fun and
merriment. Thus a tradition was born.

Here at Pitt, the Engineering Student Cabinet spon-

sors the entertainment. Activities during the week in-
cluded a parade (complete with St. Patrick), a game
night, an alumnae dinner, the Soap Box Derby, and
Parents Night.

The highlight of the week was the Shamrock Ball
held at the Pittsburgh International Airport in the Red
Winds Room.

Additionally all departments of the School sold
coffee and donuts, with all proceeds benefiting the
School for the Blind.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

Preselected groups of sororities and frater-
nities worked long hours to get the floats
ready for the annual Chariot Race. After the
floats were iudged on theme and
appearance, the groups were paired off for
the race down Bigelow.

The skills of the Greeks produced floats
modeled after the MacDonald hamburger
and the golden arches, the Apollo moonshot,
Walt‘ Disney cartoon characters and a
Monopoly board. The unifying theme was
“American Firsts".

Another Greek Week event was Fun Nite.
Games such as a wheelbarrow race, hoop
and stick, tug-of-war, jump rope, and leap
frog headlined the evening's activities.

A variety show, Talent Nite, was held at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. Per-
formers from the groups combined talents for
more song and choreography.

Greek Week '76, March 6 through March 13, began with
Greek Sing. The theme of the evening was “A Tribute to Great
American Composers”.

The selections for the night included hits by Paul Simon,
Stephen Foster, George Gershwin, Neil Diamond and Rodgers
and Hammerstein.

Each sorority and fraternity arranged one to three songs
with their own choreography to accompany it.

The event was held in Carnegie Music Hall.

Greek Week was highlighted by its charity drive.
Organized into groups of three or four, sororities and frater-
nities worked together to raise money for charity.

The Greeks sponsored a walk-a-thon, collected door to
door, held a carnival, a bake sale, raffles, mixers and a chugg-
ing contest. Together, they donated $13,600 to the Allegheny
Valley School for Exceptional Children. Greeks also donated
893 pints of blood to the Central Blood Bank.

GREEK
FORMAL

The Greek Formal was a fitting end to
the week long events sponsored by the
sororities and fraternities.

The annual event was held in the
Ballroom of the William Penn Hotel,
Downtown. The winners of the various
competitions held throughout the week
received their trophies.

“Celebrate”, Pitt's 1975 Homecoming festivities,
featured a multitude of activities for the University communi-
ty. The schedule of events commenced with the voting for
queen from a field of ten candidates. The following day, the
Second Annual Homecoming Variety Show was held with
WTAE’s Bill Hilgrove serving as Master of Ceremonies. The
winner in the queen's voting, Rene Biggs, was announced
along with the members of her court, Peggy Rockhill and
Kimberly O'Brien.

Later in the week, the Pitt Varsity Marching Band and
the cheerleaders led a parade down Fifth Avenue, much to the
dismay of the rush hour travelers. Community and student
groups participated, including the Alumni Association, the
Allegheny County Mounted Police, Pitt sororities and frater-
nities, and many campus organitations. The floats were judg-
ed and the competition won by Kappa Alpha Theta, Delta
Sigma Chi, and Triangle for their paper-mache exhibit of the
Cathedral of Learning.

Following the parade, finals for the Keg Rolling contest
were held, with a total of fifty-two three member teams par-
ticipating. Al Luccione, the Iron City Beer representative better
known as “Mr. Pittsburgh”, moderated the event.

Enthusiasm for the football contest with the Navy was
generated by a pep rally on Bubbles Field on the eve of the
game. Pitt Head Coach Johnny Maiors spoke and introduced
the members of his gridiron squad. The cheerleaders, band,
and students chanted as University Chancellor Wesley Posvar
lit the bonfire. A fireworks display added further to the spirit
of the celebration.

Preceding the Saturday afternoon clash with Navy, the Keg
Roll finals were held, with Sigma Chi fraternity winning the con-
test. Queen Rene and her court were presented at the halftime of
the game, in which Pitt fell to the Midshipmen by a score of l7-0.

An evening concert at the Syria Mosque by Stephen Stills
provided a fitting conclusion for “Celebrate” . . . The team of Flo
and Eddie opened the performance; Stills followed soon after. He
pleased the audience of Pitt students by blending his earlier solo
masterpieces with more recent works accompanied by his band,
Crazy Horse. The evening of music terminated a week of fun and
celebration for the entire Pitt community.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH VARSITY

Under the direction of Dr. Donald E.
Hower Pitt's Marching Band struts out
onto the field. The tension and excite-
ment of athletic competition are inten-
sified by the frantic movement, dan-
cing, cheering, and music associated
with our band. For a few minutes, the
band performs for an enthusiastically
applauding crowd. Then, the show is
over and the band marches off the
field. They go into retirment until the
next game. But, there is no such thing
as retiring during band season. Band is
constant work, starting with the last
week of summer which is officially titl-
ed Band Camp. Pitt's bandsmen prac-
tice marching and playing eight hours a
day for this week. After a week, new
band members are well drilled in Pitt's
marching style, a few half-time shows
have been learned, lots of feet hurt,
and someone has been thrown in the
creek.

Then, the band migrates back to
Pittsburgh just in time for fall term and
more practice every Monday, Tuesday
and Thursday night. The band spends
Saturday mornings before a game at
the stadium, practicing.

But, there are rewards for this
diligent group effort. The band marches
in the Homecoming Parade, and plays
at pep rallies and bonfires; however,
the real reward comes in the form of
vacation. This year the band took three
trips; two were weekends in New York
for the Army and Syracuse games; and
one was five days in El Paso, Texas for
the Sun Bowl. The University of
Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band—it
takes a lot of work to be the best, but
it is a lot of fun.

Johnny Maiors couldn't wait
for it to start. Tony Dorsett
couldn't wait for it to start. Robert
Haygood? Well, he might have
been a little apprehensive
because the ‘I975 Pitt football
season was going to be either a
thing of beauty or a major calami-
ty and Haygood would play a
major part in the outcome. For
Majors this would be the third
year of a fairy tale come true at
the University of Pittsburgh. In his
first year at Pitt he had taken a I-
I0 lackluster squad and
transformed them into a winning
unit, going to the first post-season
bowl appearance for the Blue and
Gold in seventeen years with a
record of six wins, four losses, and
one tie. Year two brought another
win to the Panthers who were
snubbed by bowl officials for an
unknown reason. Now in his third
year with the smallest group of
seniors in eighteen of coaching,
Majors was indeed anxious to get
started.

For Tony Dorsett, I975 would
again mean two or more people
keying on his every move,
whether it be running the football
or just blocking for a fellow back,
he would be punished for iust
simply putting on his uniform
every Saturday. But as always,
“TD” could not be stopped as he
carried the ball 228 times during
the regular season for 1,544
yards (his third consecutive 1,000
yard plus season) for an average
of 6.8 yards per carry.

Included in this little iaunt of
close to a mile were 265 yards
against Army and 303 yards
against the Fighting Irish of Notre
Dame, which broke his own

record of most yards ever rushed
against the Irish since the Gipper
began winning way back when.
Honors again piled up for Dorsett
as he finished fourth in balloting
for the Heisman Trophy. He was
voted All-American on every
writer, coach and wire services in
the world plus he captured Sports
lllustrated’s coveted backfield-
player-of-the-week twice.
Dorsett, now facing his last
season as an amateur, can
become the first back in football
history to run for over 1,000 yards
in four consecutive seasons.

For Haygood, 1975 would be
the year to prove himself as a
quarterback. With the departure
of Billy Daniels to the coaching
ranks, Haygood, although he had
never thrown a varsity pass, was
number one going into the open-
ing game. Also because of
Haygood’s running speed and his
abundance of running backs
(Dorsett plus Elliott Walker and
Bobby Hutton) Maiors had aban-
doned the I-formation in favor of
the Veer, giving Haygood the op-
tion of handing off or keeping the
ball and running himself. The
odds definitely weren't in
Haygood’s favor.

As things turned out all three
men seemed to get their wish.
Majors got his third winning
season including a trip to and a
win in the Sun Bowl, Dorsett had
perhaps his best year and stayed
healthy for his final tilt, and
Haygood? Well, the Georgia
iunior merely picked up the most
valuable player award in the Sun
Bowl although he came in cold

after being out for four games and proved he could handle the
Main Man position. But the above three were certainly not the
only contributors the Panthers had during their 7-4 campaign.

Take a long look at the offensive line. Although smaller
than most of the defenses they played against, it was this
group that opened the holes for the Dorsetts, Walkers, and
Haygoods to run through. left with just two starters at the
beginning of the season, Maiors was indeed worried but un-
derclassmen with names like Hanhauser, Corbett,Carroll,and
Pelusi filled these vacancies with enthusiasm and just plain
guts.

The defense from the onset had but six of 11 regulars for
the coming season including two holes in the secondary and
one gaping hole where All-American Gary Burley had played
middle guard.

Transfer student James “JC” Wilson proved to be walking
gold as a defensive halfback who had come north from the
University of Tampa after they had dropped football for the
sake of austerity. Wilson played outstanding ball all season.
His best day was against the Temple Owls where he in-
tercepted two passes, recovered two fumbles and blocked a
field goal.

There were other like Junior linebacker Arnie
Weatherington, defensive captain who became one of the
steadiest performers on the Panther squad leading the team
with 134 tackles.

Al Romano had a big pair of shoes to fill. Although he was
listed as a tackle before the season he was moved to the mid-
dle guard spot to take over where Burley had been in 1974.
Although not as big as Burley, the general consensus among
Pitt coaches was he was almost as fast and did iust about the
same job which, when translated, meant excellent.

Robert Haygood picks up the first down on a keeper.

Carson Long goes for three in Three Rivers against the Penn State lions.

Then there was Tom Perko, who
made an abrupt change from defen-
sive end to right linebacker at the start
of the festivities and never missed a
beat in mastering his new job. Jeff
Delaney, although only a freshman and
a running back in high school, came in
and promptly took over the monster-
man spot, a crucial spot in the Panther’s
basic 5-2 defense.

Some observers considered Matt
Cavanaugh the second string quarter-
back, but how can that be when the
sophomore stepped in for the injured
Haygood against Syracuse and led the
Cats from that point to two victories
and two losses, with the defeats com-
ing by a total of only four points?

Gordon Jones, the man with the
hands of a basketball player and the
grace of ballet dancer Rudolph
Nureyev, was a nice surprise. One of
Maiors’ super freshmen, Jones ended
the year ranked sixth in the nation in
punt returns averaging 13.3 yards per
carry. His biggest break was the 78
yard return against the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame.

Carson Long continued the steady performance which he
initiated during his freshman year as he connected on T3 of 21
field goal attempts for a 61% average while hitting on 34 of
35 point after attempts.

The season itself was what Maiors had predicted prior to
fall practice—exciting. When the Panthers won they won big
by scores like 47-0, 55-6, 52-20, and 38-0. Then there was the
win over Notre Dame 35-20 before 56,000 fans in Pitt
Stadium.

When the Panthers lost it was a different story. The loss
to Oklahoma was a rout but closer examination shows that
the Panthers might have been overawed by the Sooner’s
name and not their play as four Pitt miscues turned into OU
scores.

The shutout suffered at the hands of the Navy
Midshipmen was a different story. Pitt was riding a four game
winning streak and were the odds on favorites to win big. But
this was the day when nothing worked. Look at the 75 yard
touchdown run by Dorsett called back due to a penalty, or the
fourth down try for a TD stopped by the fired up Middies.

Three seconds were all it took for the loss at West
Virginia as a walk-on, called by his own coach a lousy
placekicker, split the uprights with a 38-yard boot.

But the heartbreaker was a 7-6 defeat at the hands of
the Nittany Lions of Penn State. Pitt scored first on a
touchdown by Elliott Walker but the extra point attempt was
blocked, the missed point which later came back to haunt the
Cats. Although dominating the game, luck seemed to be with
the central state rivals with Long missing on three field
goal trys.

The Panthers did end the season on the up side with an
impressive 33-19 rout of the Kansas Jayhawks in the 41st Sun
Bowl. KU had ended the Oklahoma rampage earlier in the
fall, handily defeating the Sooners. Against the Panthers they
lacked overall speed and made many costly errors throughout
the contest.

In the words of Dorsett, who scampered for 142 yards for
the day, “We just executed well. When we do that there isn't
a team in the country we can't stay with."

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  

Johnny Majors

Coach Johnny Majors, coming off of his victory in
the Sun Bowl, lost little time getting started on the 1976
season.

Majors would enjoy going to the Orange Bowl next
year. The Sugar Bowl would be his second choice. He
favors New Orleans because he played there in his
college days. It would be a great trip to go back and win
as a coach.

However, John Majors quickly notes that the Bowl
game is not the most important thing on his mind right
now. He has ten games to win first.

On the 1976 squad, he sees his most important
task as developing confidence. The players have to know
they are going to win. A second responsibility will be to
develop speed, not only in the running backs, but in both
lines as well.

A formidable task will be to replace the few
graduating seniors. Majors says that “they are a small
quantity, but a large quality.”

In recapping the "I975 season, Majors sees it as one
of continued growth. When he arrived at Pitt, he in-
herited a 1-10 squad. The record has improved each
year, 6-5, 7-5, and this year 8-4. The coach says any

 

season has peaks and valleys. “The peaks were higher and the
valleys more shallow this year.” Pitt beat long time rival, Notre
Dame, and won handily against the Big 8 in the Sun Bowl.

Which one of those important wins meant more to Coach Ma-
jors, the ND victory or the Kansas rout? “A win over Notre Dame
means a lot in Pittsburgh, and is a great boost to a coaching career
for anyone.”

There has been much speculation about Tony Dorsett and the
Heisman Trophy next year. In this regard, Majors sees it as essential
that the team wins. The entire team
needs a “good season, an excellent
one.” If the team is an excellent one,
Majors feels Tony stands a good chance
of capturing the Heisman. He is “an
outstanding team member.” He also
possesses “excellent running ability.”
His pass catching abilities have im-
proved each year.

Johnny Majors adds that the fans
could help the team by being more con-
sistent; by supporting the team
whether they win or lose; by suppor-
ting them equally at both major and
minor contests. Most importantly the
fans should generate excitement in the
stands.

When he's not actively coaching or
recruiting for Pitt, Majors loves to hunt
and golf. He spends considerable time
on the lecture circuit, plugging the
cause.

He also manages to squeeze in a
game of touch football each year with
Lee Majors, star of “The Six Million
Dollar Man”. He's a “good friend, he
loves sports”. The actor took the name
Majors after his football idol, then an
All-American tailback at Tennessee.

Head Coach Johnny Majors is very
happy here in Pittsburgh. He resides in
Fox Chapel. He describes the city as an
“interesting one, a place to grow.” The
people are friendly and the ethnic
backgrounds are fascinating.

Winning football games is not
only running for touchdowns, but
keeping the opponents from do-
ing the same. This task falls to the
defensive unit, the mean-looking
crowd above. Pictured convincing
Penn State ball carrier to give up
are Cecil Johnson (60), Tom Perko
(85), Don Parrish (68), Al
Romano (91) and Randy Cotens
(84).

Field goals, points after and
punts are vital factors. A single
point can decide a game. A good
punt can put the opponents out of
scoring range. This job at Pitt is
handled by “Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid”, alias Carson
Long (5) and Larry Swider (41).

The offensive unit of the Pitt
squad was sparked admirably by
Bob Haygood for half of the
season's games. He stepped up in
the Sun Bowl to lead the team to
a smashing victory, and to cap-
ture the MVP award.

Whenever Haygood was in-
iured, Matt Cavanaugh iumped
in and won the games that count.
He proved himself an excellent
quarterback. Below he's in action
against Penn State.

99

Looking for the
Heisman?

Pitt's star running back completed a very successful
season, and is now aiming his sites on the 1976 season, his
last at Pitt.

Could this be the year that Pitt captures the Heisman
Trophy? Tony sure would be happy to win it, but Coach Majors
emphasizes the importance of concentrating on teamwork. He
feels his team must win first, they “must have an excellent
season”. If the team wins, Maiors gives Tony a good chance.
He describes him as an outstanding team member, with run-
ning abilities equaled by few in the college ranks today.

Pantherettes Growl to Wins

In her first year as head basketball coach, Pat Wallace
led her charges through a 16-8 season. Considering the
schedule and the fact that Pat didn't advance to the job until
just a few weeks before the opening game, the Pantherettes
were successful.

Wallace, a former high school basketball coach at lan-
caster Catholic High School where her teams compiled an im-
pressive 226-3'l win-loss record, coached the Pitt team to the
consolation championship of the EZIZW Regional Tournament.

All-American candidate, Debbie Jones (#44 pictured on
the opposite page) was the leading scorer for the womens
basketball squad, finishing with 334 points, a per game
average of 13.9. Strange enough, Jones also finished as the
top rebounder, again with a 334 total for a 13.9 per game
average.

Barb Welsh, a freshman starter, finished the season
strong. She pulled down second place honors with a total of
234 points (10.2 average) and 147 rebounds (6.4 average).

B-Ballers End Rough Year

Tommy Richards meets his man, while on opposite page, Larry Harris goes for a score.

Pitt basketball saw a lot of firsts this year. It was Head
Coach Tim Grgurich's first time at the helm. Moving up to
replace Buu Ridl, he inherited a team that had visited post
season tournaments two years in a row.

Had the coaching change been the only first, Pitt basket-
ball would have done fine. Other factors contributed to a 12-
15 season.

Trouble started whenever 6'7” standout Melvin Bennett,
a sophomore, announced he was iumping to pro ball with the
ABA Virginia Squires. Freshman replacements were declared
academically ineligible according to the NCAA rules com-
mittee.

Then the iniuries struck. Broken wrists. Torn ligaments.
Bouts with the flu. The team was dismembered.

Against great odds, the team continued to fight on. Se-
cond stringers jumped forward and responded to the

chaﬂenge.

Larry Harris, the slick sophomore from Lorain, Ohio, took
over the offensive duties in remarkable fashion, averaging
over 22 points per game.

He became the all-time highest scoring sophomore in
Pittsburgh history, and had a season high of 39 points in the
contest with Syracuse in the Steel Bowl, a feat which netted
him the tournament's MVP award.

Scott Nedrow came off the bench with a hot hand to
finish the season second in scoring to Harris. Bob Shrewsbury
took over for the injured Tom Richards at the point guard posi-
tion and played well. Sophomore Terry Knight matured visibly
as the season progressed. He should be excellent next year.
Freshmen Wayne Williams and Pete Strickland responded
with key baskets in crucial games. Williams hit for nineteen
against Syracuse.

One of the most exciting, most emotionally charged
games ever to be played in the city was the opening game of
the ‘I975 Steel Bowl under the big dome. Pitt faced a much
taller crosstown Duquesne team.

Despite the handicap, the Panthers put on an excellent
show, outplaying the Dukes in every aspect of the game. A
last quarter surge finally put the Dukes on top in the last
seconds of the game. Willie Kelly shot a twenty-five footer at
the buzzer, only to see it drop off the front of the rim. The ef-
fort was lost 75-74.

The Steel Bowl loss was to be the story of the season.
Operating in most games against much taller opponents, the
Panthers fought hard, often dropping contests by only a few
points.

The team almost managed the college basketball upset
of the year in their game against nationally second ranked
Marquette. Trailing by 22 points at the half, the Panthers
came within two with two minutes remaining. Again, the lack
of height proved their downfall.

The experience gained by underclassmen, the coaching
ability of Tim Grgurich, and the final four wins have most peo-
ple convinced that Pitt will be back next year.

Grapplers Hook Record Season

When the 1975-76 wrestling season opened, no one ex-
pected the young squad to compile the best team record here
at Pitt since 1963.

The Dave Adams coached team finished with a 12-4
mark. Led by junior Rande Stottlemeyer, Pitt's two time All-
American, the team had rolled up an 8-0 record when the flu
“pinned down” nine of the ten starters.

Despite the handicap, the reserves narrowly dropped a
contest to powerful Michigan. After return to the line-up, the
starters never regained their previous momentum.

Rande Stottlemyer suffered a back injury which kept him
from action for three weeks. When on the mats, Stottlemyer
was undefeated in regular season dual meets. He carried this
impressive record to the post season Eastern Wrestling League
Tourney, and captured his division title.

The EWL is the new league formed this year whenever
Pitt and Penn State dropped out of the ECAC. The infant

league is no hiding place from tough competition. Over thirty
members of the league wrestled at the National Tournament,
including five Pitt starters. The Pitt team finished third in the
league behind Penn State and Clarion.

Adams sends his men to the mats with an aggressive
spirit. He chose this motto before the season when he said,
“We've got to be a very aggressive team this year. We've got
to get after people. Wear them down and go after the falls.
Aggression will be our battle cry this year.”

With only four graduates on the team (Bob Bailey, Bill
Korth, Ray Dallatore, and Jeff Minerd), the T976 squad could
post one of the best records in Pitt wrestling history. To further
boost the team's high expectations, Coach Adams has
recruited one of the top wrestlers in the east. Heavyweight
Mark Stepanavich is coming to Pitt as a junior transfer from
the Naval Academy.

Track Finishes in Record Time

With the emphasis on relays due to
the abundance of running talent this
year, the track team completed a win-
ning season.

Dan Goodyear, a sophomore cleared
6-11% in an official iump. Sophomore
Keith Taylor performed well as an all
around iumper. Mike Matter, who last
year finished ninth in the nation in
iavelin, threw 243 feet. Eric Drescher, a
freshman, broke the school record in
shot-put.

However, the strongest area of the
Pitt squad is the run. “We attributed
this to the carry-over from cross country
where our people used it as a base to
ready themselves for the outdoor
season,” said head coach Mike
Agostinella.

The distance medley relay included
Nick Martin, an All-American cross
country runner and Mel Boyd who
finished two places from being an All-
American last year in the cross country
nationals.

The Pitt Hockey Club completed a successful sixth season
with an impressive record of 9-7-1. Coached by Len Barcalow
and Bob Montgomery, the Panthers hit the ice against teams
from New York, CMU, Cincinnati, Penn State, the Naval
Academy and Duquesne.

The club has a long history at Pitt, although it was in-
terrupted by a thirty-six year period clue to funding difficulties.

A famous game in 1939 at the Duquesne Gardens,
located at the corner of Craig and Fifth Avenues, is one of the
hockey highlights of the city. The game started at 8:15,
featuring Pitt and Duquesne fighting for the Ohio-
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Hockey League championship.

Six hours later at 1:45 A.M. after a total of 155 minutes
of actual playing time including five overtime periods, the
game was called at a 1-1 tie. It had become apparent that
serious iniury might result if play continued. Both teams were
too exhausted to go on.

The current group has been active for five years and they
still experience funding problems. The administration won't
fund them since they are not varsity, the Student Government
feels that they should go varsity.

Today they are members of WPIHA (Western Penn-
sylvania Intercollegiate Hockey Association) and have cap-
tured the Commissioner's Cup for four years.

HOCKEY!

Captain Rick Vernon led the icemen in total goals scored
with twenty-six. Curt Hetz added forty points to the Panther
offensive effort to become the team's leading point maker.
The opponents were kept to an average of seven goals per
game, thanks to the fast work of goalies Larry Newell and
Tom Hoover. Alternate captains for the season were Bob
Arturo, Jeff Saunders, and Bill Gedeon.

The team had an exciting 17 game season. During a

, three game weekend in New York, the team beat Wagoner

and Brooklyn. Iona College tied up the third game at 6-6 to
give the Panthers a 2-1 record on the road. A doubleheader at
Cincinnatti provided the Panthers with twin losses: 12-5 and
12-3. The Cincinnatti team came to Pittsburgh later in the year
to add a shut-out, 8-0. Two road games against Navy and the
Washington Chiefs added a win and a loss to the Panther
season record. In three games with Duquesne, the Pitt ice men
won two with scores of 8-0, 1 1-2. The Duquesne team came
back in the final game to beat the Panthers for the first time in
six years with a final score of 2-1. Upset at PSU by one goal,
the Panthers took the Nittany Lions for a long loss at the Civic
Arena in the final game of the season. The score was 11-2.

The Second Annual Pitt Invitational found the Panthers

hosting teams from Iona, Drexel and Brooklyn. Iona beat Pitt
4-3 in sudden death overtime, while Brooklyn put away Drex-
el 12-1. In the consolation game, the Panthers shut out Drexel
18-0. Iona was victorious over Booklyn 3-2 during sudden
death overtime to take the championship.

The team operated on a budget of approximately $18,-
000. A large part of the money come from the Allocations
Committee at Pitt, with the difference made up in ticket sales,
donations and player dues. The club members pay for their
own room and board while on the road, transportation being
provided by the club. The coaches invested both time and
money to back the team in all their ventures on the ice. Many
people contributed hard work to aid the players. Dr. Michael
Sherman acted as faculty advisor for the team. The founder of
the team six years ago, Dr. Sherman has had to semi-retire in
favor of research and commitments in the Pitt Physical Educa-
tion Department.

The team plays their games at the Civic Arena on
weekend afternoons, and hopes to get a greater amount of
public support for the upcoming year. Students will be ad-
mitted free to the '76-'77 games.

Kickers Get Booted

A difficult season for Pitt's soccer team ended with a
5-7-2 record. Offensive production was low. Wins were by
narrow margins, but so were the losses. The defensive ef-
forts of the squad were excellent in all games except the
one against Lock Haven. There the booters played in ar-
tificial turf shoes—in the mud. Traction was poor, to say the
least.

In the opening game, the Panthers surprised
themselves by holding powerful Akron to a 0-0 tie. It was
Pitt's first attempt, but Akron had enough laying time to
halve already scored 26 goals, allowing their opponents
on 4.

Y The Panthers shut out Edinboro, Indiana University of
Pennsylvania and Grove City, 2-0. Crosstown rivals
Carnegie Mellon and Point Park both fell to Pitt by scores of
3-1. Elkins battled to a 1-1 tie, while the Panthers lost to
Bucknell, West Virginia and Slippery Rock, 1-0.

Despite the losing season, four members of the
Panther soccer squad brought home honors. Frank Bucci
and Alan Jutca made the All New Jersey, Pennsylvania
and Delaware Squad. The states comprise the Division 1 of
the NCCA. There are six divisions across the country.

Frank and Alan ioined John Curley and Kim Blasko on
the West Penn team.

Under the eye of new track coach
Mike Agostinella, the Panther track and
field units had another successful year.

With the loss of Karl Farmer, a
runner of national caliber, in the foot-
ball draft to the Atlanta Falcons, the
team immediately began to blend
together, pulling strengths to cover
weaknesses.

Freshmen played an important part
in the wins this year. Standout Eric
Drescher, a freshman shot-put and dis-
cus man, ended the year with a 55 foot
toss. The effort brought him national
honors.

Cross-country star Nick Martin
moonlighted with the track squad, and
ran the mile. A natural team leader,
Martin again proved his importance to
the team effort.

Mel Boyd continued his outstanding
running, demonstrating that he can
perform well in any event from the 880

What happens to a baseball team whenever they lose the infield
players, all but one pitcher, and all but one outfielder from the 1975
squad? They compile a record of 6-10.

1976 marked the twenty-third year of coaching at Pitt for Bob
Lewis, a Pitt graduate himself and a .293 hitter back in his heyday.
Lack of experience was the problem this year for Lewis’ diamondmen.
Last year's team simply graduated.

Junior pinch hitter Kurt leitholf led the pack, finishing with a .353
average. Outfielder Mel Howard was right behind with 36 at bats and
a .333 average. Other leaders were Allen Webster (.304), Dan Skinner
(.257), Dan DeStout (.245), Mike Bianco (.244), Mike Miller (.242),
and Val Bianco (.216). Catcher Val Bianco and pitcher Don Kennedy
served as co-captains.

The Pitt Soccer Team completed the 1975-76 season with
a 5-7-2 record. At the beginning of the season, Coach Bemis
had only one question. As he put it, the team could win “if we
score goals”.

Sounds like the obvious, but Coach Leo Bemis meant that
the Pitt defense was fairly strong. He was concerned with the
offensive movement of the ball.

His concerns proved valid, as the team scored only 17

goals in the 14 games. ‘‘That’s just not enough to win soccer
games."

Despite the losing season, the team considers the year a
building one. Lots of underclassmen gained valuable playing
experience which will prove useful in the upcoming season.
Many recruits from area high schools will handle the bulk of
the forward play in 1976. Bemis sees them as having excellent
potential. The 1976 games should provide much excitement.

Breath-taking water shows are the specialty of

The team designs and performs graceful
movements planned around a central theme.
Naturally, one of this year's shows had a bicenten-
nial theme, complete with red, white and blue
costumes.

The cross country team started run-
ning right where they left off in 1975-
away with honors. Losing only one
sprinter from the 1975 undefeated
squad, the team completed another
record year. They were led by Nick Mar-

through Schenley Park.

Swimmers Splash to Record Year

Training together, the men's and women's swim teams
won together this year.

The women, coached by Kate Mathison, compiled an im-
pressive 11-0 record, finishing third in the East. Eight girls
went to the Nationals, including Jenny Brooker, Nila de Jesus,
Christy Elston, Connie Hiester, Angie Lopez, Jennifer Price,
Kathy Stetler and Jamie Conley.

Kathy Stetler was named an All-American in two events,
the 50-Fly and the 50-Freestyle, and will be going to the

as the Panthers ran away with all of the honors, defeating
their nearest rival by ‘ISO points.

Jerry DeMuro broke his own record set in last year's In-
vitational in the I650-yard swim, and captured the Tour-

A Pitt bench anxiously awaiting. Yet all over the bench
you could spot starters. Starters who hadn't dressed for a
game in weeks.

It started during the first contest, a game with the
Yugoslavian National team. All-American Keith Starr went
down and damaged the ligaments of his right knee. He was to
see but two minutes of playing time in the games to follow.

A few weeks later, experienced senior point guard Tom-
my Richards suffered a broken wrist. Play that helped lead the

Panthers to two previous post tournament bouts never return-
ed, even after the wrist healed.

With key starters sitting on the bench week after week,
inexperienced underclassmen gained valuable playing
time—-adding to their skill and confidence. Names like Terry
Knight, Bob Shrewsbury, Pete Strickland and Wayne Williams
grabbed the ball and the headlines as they improved with
each game. Winning the last four games of the season, they
left every fan with great hopes for next year.

Pitt's new head coach, Tim Grgurich started the season
with great hopes. Prior to the season he said, “Something
good has to happen to this team. They're too devoted and
they work too hard not to have it happen.”

It didn't happen. Early injuries, the loss of freshman Mel
Bennett to the pros, and old fashioned tough luck worked
against the team. They finished a disappointing I2-15.

Summing up the year, Tim Grgurich said, “We lost a lot
of tough games this year. But next year, we're the ones who

are going to be having some fun out there—this time at their
expense."

Those words capture the spirit of the new coach. He's a
fighter, a dymanic, honest, intense man raring to go. He says
of himself, “Basketball is what I'm all about—it’s what my
life is all about. Maybe as I get older my values will change
but right now my whole life revolves around these kids,
basketball and my family.”

HENRY HEADS GUEST LIST

HEN RY KISSINGER, United

States Secretary of State, unveiled his
solutions for the world's economic woes
at a major address here in Pittsburgh at
a dinner sponsored by the World Affairs
Council.

Kissinger urged the powers to seek
ioint solutions to economic problems
during economic summits. The
Secretary made it clear that economic
issues were becoming increasingly in-
volved with political matters.
“Economic issues are now a central
dimension of international politics.
New participants, practices, and
demands have given rise to disputes
over energy, food, raw materials, and
rules for the exploitation of ocean
resources.”

Continuing further, Kissinger told the
sell-out crowd that the very nature of
modern international politics ruled out
isolationism as a viable practice. The in-
terdependency of all countries rules out
success in economic recovery if nations
maintain a policy of isolation, if they
attempt independent solutions.

“Co-operation among industrial
nations is also essential if we are to
achieve greater self-sufficiency and less
vulnerability in energy, if we are to
maintain and expand the world's
markets and supplies of food, and if we
are to ensure adequate supplies and
market stability for other vital raw
materials.”

Special responsibilities fall to the
major industrial powers, for they con-
trol the largest and most dynamic
economies. Alternate sources of energy
must be developed so that the “in-
dustrial democracies can be free of the
oil producing powers."

Closing his prepared remarks, he returned to the econom-
ic summits. “The dialogue between the industrial and the
developing countries is of crucial importance to the building of
international order.” He reassured the audience that it is wise
to further entangle ourselves with foreign countries. “Today
the world needs most of all the optimism and confidence that
America has always embodied. It needs our strong faith as a
source of hope to others that the world can solve its
problems.”

MOSHE DAYAN, former Israeli Defense Minister,
spoke before an audience in Soldiers and Sailors Hall,
Oakland. “Conflict in the Middle East” was the formal title
given to the free address, but the bulk of the time was
devoted to a detailed history of the Middle East crisis, the story
of Israel's struggle for life.

Dayan was greeted by a standing ovation by a crowd of
one thousand backers, as he informed them that he supports
United States sponsored negotiations with Syria and Russia.
He does not want the US to fight for them, but made it clear
they expect help. “We expect the U.S. to help all of your
friendly nations, including Israel, to take care to defend
themselves."

The general rated as excellent chances that US'efforts at
Mid East peace would succeed. He warned, however, that the
Soviet Union must be included in any agreement that is to
bring lasting peace. “Any successful agreement must include
Syria, Egypt, the United States and the Soviet Union. The
latest interim peace agreement is no step closer to peace. We
only signed because of pressure put on us by your country."

The forty minute question and answer period following
the prepared statement allowed Dayan an opportunity to
more fully explain his country's stand. He said the Middle East
conflict is in no way a nuclear one at present, but that Israel is
ready should the Arabs introduce such warheads. He also ex-
pects U.S. withdrawal before the situation turns into another
Vietnam for us.

Al-GER Hlss, a former State Department official, spoke
to approximately 300 people at the Student Union ballroom on
October 8, 1975. Hiss, now 71, was convicted of perjury in 1950
for denying that he had passed State Department documents to
the confessed Communist courier, Whittaker Chambers, during
the famous “Pumpkin Papers” trial. The “Pumpkin Papers”—five
rolls of microfilmed documents that Chambers hid in a hollowed-
out pumpkin on his farm——had first captured public attention
during the investigation led by the then unknown Richard Nixon.
Two of the five rolls of film were introduced as trial evidence and
led eventually to Hiss’ indictment and conviction. Hiss has spent
44 months in prison and has worked assiduously ever since to
clear his name. His subject at Pitt was “The Press and the
McCarthy Era".

Concerning the press, Hiss said that a change of the
American press and the public opinion is due in part to lessons
drawn from the McCarthy era. “The whole country was carried
away by what was almost hysteria but the press generally has
different attitudes now”, he said. He attributes the change to
much more educated, objective, sophisticated, investigatory, and
independent journalists. But Hiss also added that history tends to
repeat itself and “the U.S. has had more excrecencies of this kind
than any other country. There were the Salem witch trials, the
alien and sedition laws, and the Palmer Red Raids after World
War I.’’

Talking about McCarthyism, Hiss said, ‘‘It started in 1945
with the establishment of the House Committee on UnAmerican
Activities which was really ‘unAmerican’. The committee really
put McCarthy on the rail. Actually he (McCarthy) was a Johnny-
Come-Lately and opportunist who waited for the passions of the
time and followed it.”

After his speech, Hiss answered questions from the
audience. When asked about the Yalta Conference, Hiss, who
held strategically important positions as well as consultant
lawyer for President Roosevelt, said modestly, “Yes, I was
there.” He also commented on the “Pumpkin Papers” extracted
from a pumpkin on December 2, “they're usually soft and rotten
at that time of year—TH|S one was definitely rotten.”

wlll-lAM SlMON visited Pitt for the Alex C. Walker
Memorial lecture. The U.S. Treasury Secretary delivered the ad-
dress in David Lawrence Hall before a crowd composed of faculty,
students and area businessmen.

Simon used the occasion to assure the group that the
nation's economic recovery will be a vigorous and healthy one,
although we must be constantly mindful of the problems of infla-
tion and capital formation. He asserted that “we have a Cabinet
and President that are not in a state of disarray and are
dedicated to facing these problems.”

The core of the Secretary's speech outlined economic
problems and possible solutions to each. Some of his suggestions
for the alleviation of our economic problems included elimination
of short term “political” answers for long range problems, a
dampening of inflation through government budget cutting and
enactment of tax reforms that would encourage investment and
savings.

Changing his focus somewhat, he appealed to the
businessmen to join government officials and “to go to the
American people and lay it on the line” about the need for higher
profits to strengthen the economy and eventually create new
jobs. Capital infusion must also triple to offset declining worker
productivity. Higher profits provide the viable solution as seen by
Simon.

ANGELA DAVIS visited campus as the keynote

speaker of the third annual Conference Against Racism and
Political Repression. Her message to the crowd was one of uni-
ty. “We're going to have to fight like hell to tear down the
wall of racism, if we can unite one day we will not only be
able to fight City Hall, one day we will take it over.” Davis
called racism an organized effort of government. Racism is
perpetrated for their benefit and by their efforts. Those
fighting racism become the target of police action. Cor-
porations are also racists, decisions being made by trustees
and being passed through a chain to the workers.

DICK GREGORY: comedian-activist, delivered his
message as part of the sixth annual Black Week. Gregory
appealed to the audience to abandon hatred and radically
change society. America's youth, both black and white, bear a
“fantastic burden”, one passed from the previous generation.
“Somewhere along the line, you young people are going to
have to turn this system around. The very faith and destiny of
the country depends on you. Universities should teach a little
less math and trigonometry and a little more about integrity,
honesty, and ethics.” Gregory also attacked the university ad-
ministration for admitting blacks but failing to educate them.

 

Jul-lAN BOND. U.S. Senator from Georgia, made his
annual appearance on the Pitt campus as part of the sixth an-
nual Black Week festivities.

Speaking in the packed Ballroom, Bond reminded his
audience of the struggle which is necessary to eradicate in-
justice, not only to blacks, but to women and other minorities

Candidates for city and county offices

campus and to meet with interested
students in late October.

The event was held in the Venetian

would think would attract a sizable crowd
for such an event. Few students showed.

Those who were interested enough
found that the other side of the assembly
also neglected to turn out. Only a handful
of candidates on the November slate took
time to attend. Those who did put in brief

JOSEPH BlDEN, Democratic Senator from Delaware,
spoke in Benedum Hall on November ‘I7. Sponsored by the
College Young Democrats, Biden is the youngest U.S. Senator
ever elected (at age 29). He serves on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.

The principal thrust of his fiery address was the increase
of Presidential power and the lack of powerful Congressmen
who are willing to curb it. He accused Congressmen, especial-
ly liberals, of being afraid to stand up to Presidential power.
As a result of this fear, Congress has shown no initiative in
structuring foreign policy and is unable to work as an equal
partner with the executive branch of government. “We
liberals are the ones who gave you a more powerful president,
and we are now giving you an impotent Congress.” Biden
continued, saying, “The government continues to prop up dic-
tatorships, ign_ore Africa and close its eyes to the goings-on in
India. Nothing is changing, yet we go around and beat our
breasts about how the system works. One of the myths
floating around these days in this post-Watergate era is that
the system has been vindicated and we have redressed the
imbalance that existed between the legislative and executive

today.” To correct the imbalance, Congress must assume the
initiative, ignoring fear.

MICHAEL MEEROPOL came to

campus to plead his case for the reopening
of the Rosenberg case. He is the son of the
executed atomic spies, Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg. He has been touring the coun-
try for several years attempting to clear
the name of his parents.

He maintains that the Rosenberg case
was an attempt of the U.S. government to
prove to the American people that com-
munism was a threat, and that the way to
counter the threat was with belligerancy.
“Here was proof of all the things that the
House Committee on Un-American Ac-
tivities and Joe McCarthy were
saying—here is the danger to our national
security.”

Meeropol claims that this case causes
the average American to associate dissent
with disloyalty. Since the trial, much of the
evidence used to convict the Rosenbergs
has been discredited. Meeropol hopes to
convince America of his parents’ in-
nocence and prevent further abuses.

 put in an appearance before Cl

very small crowd in David Lawrence Hall. Here to advance his
faltering campaign for the presidency, he quickly made it
known he was not running as a Democrat or as a Republican.
He was making a go for the presidency in his own right,
committed to no party platform, following only his beliefs. His
address was directed to the youth of the previous generation,
to the activists of the sixties, people who share his ideals.
As questions from the audience became more heated,
the old politician retreated from his positions, showing more
interest in discussing his dreams than his presidency.

 

ART BUCl'lWAl-D, political satirist par excellence,
graced the Pitt campus with his presense early in March.
Assuring the audience that he “can never write anything that
is crazier than what you find on the front page of the New
York Times", Buchwald proceeded with a lecture which was a
collection of the best punch lines from his columns.

He got the standing room only crowd laughing by
relating the story of his college days at the University of
Southern California. He said, ‘‘I don't want to speak here
tonight under any false pretenses. I have no use for
education.” He spent three years at USC, but was not allowed
to work toward a degree, for he never graduated from high
school. He then announced that he had recently been named
“Alumnus of the Year” at USC. “So you see, you are all
wasting your time.”

Buchwald, who thinks of himself “as the cruise director
on the Titanic" says that he's always wanted “to write a por-
nography book, but I get so excited doing the research that I
never get around to doing the book.”

The funny man turned serious as he closed his presenta-
tion by convincing the audience of his deep patriotism and
pride in the government he ridicules. “Two hundred million
people were able to change presidents overnight without one
bayonet being unsheathed. Any country that can do that can't
be all bad.”

Eh, What's for Supper?

The Food Service committee captured the honors for
“Sloppiest Event” by sponsoring the Pizza contest. Eighteen
male-female teams stuffed themselves (and one another)
with the saucy delight.

There were five parts to the event, two run with con-
testants blindfolded and two without the aid of hands. Donna
Weidner and Dennis Bubar ate 39 pieces to win the first prize
of $100. When asked to comment on his win, Buber asked,
“Eh, what's for supper?”

The $50. second prize went to Claudio Hoher and Miguel
Rivera, who managed 37 pieces and Ken Kallish and Ellen
Freed put away 35 for $25. third place.

They Danced All Nite

The Fourth Annual Pitt Dance Marathon was held for the benefit of
The March of Dimes. Beginning at midnight Friday, the marathon was
scheduled to last thirty-six grueling hours, until noon Sunday.

Few couples lasted past noon Saturday and less than five made it
through Saturday night. The event ended early Sunday morning when
the final couple turned in their shoes for a bed.

The winners received an all expense paid weekend in New York, in-
cluding theatre. Spectators contributed as they entered the ballroom door.

SPIRITS OF 76

The second annual Beer Tasting Festival,
“The Spirits of 76", packed the Student
Union Ballroom with hearty souls for an
afternoon of excessive drinking.

Six different beers were served up: Stroh’s
light and dark, Old Milwaukee, Schlitz,
Schlitz Malt, and Iron City. The idea was to
sample each variety, but most quickly found
a favorite and retired to a corner table with
some friends.

A beer tasting contest in which contestants
were required to identify three beers by taste
alone pitted city newscasters and University
administrators against one another. Bill
Hillgrove (WTAE), Greg Benedetti (KDKA),
Dave Kelly (WIIC), and Adam Lynch (WIIC)
competed with Assistant to the Chancellor Ed
Bozik and Vice Chancellor of Business and
Finance Joe Dutton. Lynch, Hillgrove, and
Bozik made it to the finals, where Adam
Lynch emerged victorious.

Music by a German band and a rock D..I.
kept the drinkers drinking until the taps ran
dry at 9 P.M., leaving little but a sticky mess
for the midnight clean-up crew.

 

 

The Great Plant Proposition was
held in September and students had
the opportunity to purchase their
choice from over 3000 tropical
plants. The lower lounge of the Stu-
dent Union was filled with yucca
trees, bromeliads, schefflera, rubber
plants and succulents, among other
rare varieties.

The Student Union Patio was the setting for
music and lunch on the lawn. Weather permitting,
various musical groups performed while students,
faculty, and staff enjoyed a brown bag. One of the
most popular attractions was the Pitt Jazz Ensemble,
shown here, led by Nathan Davis (left).

1976 turned out to be a year for
fiery, short-lived controversy. A
relatively small band of students would
erupt, provoking administrative
response, and then allow their
rebellious spirits to disappear as the
problem in question was solved by the
expanse of time.

It started whenever a Duquesne stu-
dent cross-registered and made the Pitt
Golden Girl squad. Football season
brought protests over the ticket
allocations system and the much talked
of “coupon distribution system”, with
yet another waiting line each week.
And why was the student allotment cut
anyhow?

As the faculty and administration
grappled with the question of unioniza-
tion, students worked themselves into an uproar over the ban-
ning of the movie “Deep Throat”. Resident student leaders
became enflamed whenever the pinball machines, all three of
them, were moved from the Towers lobby. Residents also got
pinched in the housing crunch, with many freshmen being
forced into Webster Hall Hotel. Each was faced with a terrible
trek in the cold weather for an early morning breakfast at the
Towers.

The Student Coalition Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH)
provided sufficient rhetorical entertainment for the weary

1976 — A Year

 

winter term students no longer amused by the now routine
fare. Almost daily the warring factions of SCATH thought of
something new and different, culminating their effort with a
jostling match with Dr. Posvar on the SU lawn.

The controversial firing of Dr. Paul Nyden from the ranks of
the sociology department continued the binge of the restless
spirits of students faced with finals.

The problems in retrospect seem trivial. The bottles at the
time were heated, emotional contests.

The Oakland campus of the University was
declared an official Bicentennial Campus in
ceremonies conducted in front of the Cathedral of
Learning.

ROTC cadets acted as an honor guard at the flag
raising exercise, and the official American Revolu-
tion Bicentennial Flag was hoisted along with the
familiar Stars and Stripes. Later, five campus
buildings were declared historical landmarks by
the City of Pittsburgh's History and Landmark's
Foundation. The five buildings designated all bear
plaques. They include Heinz Chapel, the Allegheny
Observatory, Stephen Foster Memorial, the Univer-
sity Residence, and the Cathedral of Learning. Ad-
ditionally, the Cathedral was singled out as the
last great monument to the Gothic Revival style of
architecture.

Faculty Votes No Union

Eighty-seven per cent of the eligible faculty
members turned out to cast ballots in the hotly contested
faculty unionization run-off vote.

The tabulation of the ballots of the election held
March 30-31, ‘I976 showed 662 or 60.2% of the total
ballots cast were for no union, while 438 or 39.8% were
for the Pitt Professional Union (PPU).

Previously, in early March, faculty in both the
Health Professions and the School of Law registered ma-
jority votes against unionization. Faculty in the School of
Medicine, while voting for their own faculty association,
have indicated no intention of seeking any formal collec-
tive bargaining agreement. This first election
necessitated the run-off election in the provost area, con-
sisting of seven schools, the regional campuses, and the
libraries and research centers.

The vote in the initial election showed 48.4% for no
union, 21.2% for the Pitt Professional Union, 20.2% for
the American Association of University Professors
(AAUP) and 'l0.2% for the Pennsylvania State Educa-
tion Association (PSEA).

An intensive debate among faculty and ad-
ministration members preceded the election. The con-
troversial question captured headlines for more than a
year.

‘I93

Exam-weary sleepers were awakened by
the wail of sirens and the smell of smoke as
fire broke out in the third floor suite of Amos
Hall, occupied by the sisters of Delta Phi Ep-
silon.

Firemen responded within minutes to the
8 AM blaze on Saturday, April 17. Blocking
Fifth Avenue from Bigelow, they expertly
maneuvered to insure that all occupants
were out. The fire was extinguished within
minutes.

Dense smoke hampered the sorority sisters
in their attempts to move quickly out of the
building. The Quad rapidly filled with
barefooted, nervous women clad in
nightclothes.

Within an hour, clean-up and salvage
operations were under way. Organized by
the Office of Residence Life, IFC and Pan-Hel,
over seventy-five students helped the dis-
placed victims into other quarters for the
remainder of the term.

When the tension broke, with everyone
safe, a grimy fireman approached a group of
students and said, “When we got the alarm,
they said it was an all girls’ dorm. Where
were all those guys comin’ from?” A sharpie
from the back quipped, “We always
wondered who she slept with, now we
know.”

Ironically enough, work was underway at
the time of the fire to install bridges on the
roofs of the Quad to improve fire safety.
Stairwells were also being pressurized. These
changes will be completed soon.

In the Name of the Law...

Its first home was at the corner of Ross
and Diamond Streets, Downtown, in
I843. In 1919, it moved to the tenth floor
of the Chamber of Commerce building.
The great flood of ‘I936 forced a re-
location to the Cathedral of learning. On
May 1, ‘I976 the University of Pittsburgh
School of Law found its own home. In for-
mal ceremonies that day, the new
building was dedicated. Classes had been
held there since the first day of the spring
term, January 5, 1976.

Planning of the new facility involved
many tedious hours for the administration
and for the architectural firm of
Johnstone, Newcomer 8: Valentour.
Representatives travelled around the
country to visit recently completed law
schools and to note their best features.
They held conversations with the schools’
faculty, students, administration and
maintenance personnel to learn about the
buildings. Careful scrutinization of the Pitt
operation was also initiated.

From the studies, designers developed a
list of crucial considerations. They were
aware, first of all, that students would
spend the whole of their academic day at
the school, a day which normally would
run from early morning to late evening.

They thus, designed classrooms which
in size and contour would encourage in-
teraction among students; faculty offices
which would afford privacy and proximity
to the library and yet be convenient to
students; a library which would offer in-
dividual study areas and easy access to a
large number of volumes.

A tour of the structure will show that
the dream has been realized. The largest
element of the new building is the law
library. Housed on the three upper floors,
the location provides the desired
remoteness from the main flow of student
traffic. Faculty offices ring the perimeter of
the library on floors three and five.

Equipped to house 225,000 volumes,
the library's current collection stands at
90,000 volumes. Also, provided are in-
dividual reading carrels for each student,
group study rooms, a typing room, and an
audio-visual room equipped with
microfiche readers and printers and a clos-
ed circuit television system.

Other rooms are arranged around the
main lobby entrance to allow swift dis-
charge of classes. Two classrooms have a
capacity of ‘I74 each. Two others seat 125
students in a tiered horseshoe arrange-
ment which facilities discussion. Four
seminar rooms have seating for 20 to 25
students.

All desk tops are continuous and all
floors are carpeted to enhance the
acoustics.

The outstanding feature of the building
is the Moot Courtroom, a complex used
primarily by members of the student-
operated Moot Court Board for practice in
trial advocacy and appellate argument,
but equipped to handle special sessions of
the Commonwealth and Federal
Appellate Courts. The courtroom includes
a five-seat judges’ bench, jury and press
boxes, counsellors’ tables, iudges’
chambers and iury room.

The ground floor of the building is the student center.
Located are vending areas, activity rooms, lounges and
lockers. Administrative offices are found on two, adjacent to
the faculty lounge. A fully equipped kitchen on this level can
provide for service at social functions, which may be held in
the lounges or on the large promenade deck which encircles
the east and south ends of the building on the second floor.
Entrance onto the promenade deck can only be gained from
the administrative suite, thus assuring comfort and privacy.

A dry deluge sprinkler system has been installed
throughout the building, with particular attention given the
library. The system's localized sprinklers will wet only those
areas affected by fire. With the exception of the classrooms

and exterior walls, the remainder of the building’: wall sec-
tions can be dismantled and relocated to allow flexibility in
room size and use.

Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States, Byron R. White delivered the dedication address. A per-
sonal friend of Law School Dean W. Edward Sell, White open-
ed his remarks by asking, “Why should we continue to
educate lawyers who are going to be unemployed?" He
answered his own question by asserting “The demand for the
extraordinarily good lawyer is higher than ever.” He also
referred to the growing interest of government in providing
legal services for the poor involved in criminal and civil cases.
The growing popularity of group legal services designed to
help the average wage earner, who can't
afford to hire a good lawyer is another
area of growth for the law profession.
White pointed out that many unions will
be promoting legal services as a benefit to
be included in collective bargaining during
the next few years.

The Justice also addressed the problem
of increasing numbers of qualified
students being turned down for admission
when such an enormous need exists.
Another area which needs inquiry is the
high cost of legal service; A solution may
be found in lower costs for legal educa-
tion, White suggests.

A native of Fort Collins, Colorado, White
played professional football here in
Pittsburgh in I938 with the Pirates. In
1954, Whizzer White was named to the
National Football Hall of Fame.

From January to October, 1939 White
studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. At
the outbreak of the war, he returned and
played two years with the Detroit lions
before volunteering for the armed ser-
vices. Upon his honorable discharge, he
returned to Yale Law School and earned
his LLB, magna cum laude.

Nominated by President John F.
Kennedy, he succeeded Justice Charles E.
Whittaker as an associate Justice of the
Supreme Court, on April I6, 1962.

Pitt's Guiding Light

Abovo- Dr and Mrs. Posvar wolurno parents during the annual reception along with Dr. Alfred Maya (right), Vice-Chancellor, Stu-
dent Affairs, and Student Government President Larry Platt. Below: Dr. Posvar opens the Parents’ Weekend festivities.

In 1966, nine members of the Board of Trustees and six
faculty members were assigned to a special screening com-
mittee and charged with locating a candidate to assume
responsibilities as the ﬁfteenth Chancellor of the University of
Pittsburgh.

Educational, professional, and business sources from
across the country began making recommendations. The
original list of over one hundred names had been narrowed to
ten for intensive review. Then the board received a call from
the head of the American Assembly, Dr. C. Nelson of Columbia
University. He knew of a young Air Force colonel, well-known
in government and academic circles for his contributions to the
theory and practice of administration.

Dr. Nelson recomended a distinguished-looking sandy-
haired gentleman with bushy eyebrows. His credentials were
outstanding. His name—Wesley Went: Posvar. On June 1,
1967, Wesley W. Posvar was named Chancellor of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

Since his coming to Pitt, the University has expanded
41% to 25,390 full time equivalent students on five cam-
puses, increased full-time faculty from 1,580 to 2,143, more
than doubled its budget to over $150 million, and added or
begun construction on twenty-one buildings.

Prior to his appointment at Pitt, Posvar headed the Social
Sciences Division and the Political Science Department at the
United States Air Force Academy. When appointed there as a
permanent professor in l957, he was the youngest depart-
ment chairman at any service academy. He organized and
recruited the original staff of that department. Posvar helped
found and was a national president of the International
Studies Association. He has also contributed advice and
criticism to the government regarding various aspects of
national security policy.

Born in Topeka, Kansas on September ‘I4, 1925 Dr.
Posvar received his early education in public schools in
Cleveland, Ohio. In 1946, he graduated first in the largest
class (875) in the history of the U.S. military Academy at West
Point, and achieved one of the most distinguished academic
records in the academy’s history. He was the first Air Force of-
ficer to be named a Rhodes scholar at Oxford.

Since then he has earned five academic degrees: One at
West Point in engineering, two at Oxford in philosophy,
politics and economics, and two at Harvard, the Master of
Public Administration and the Ph.D. in political science. He has
been awarded several honorary degrees.

Chancellor Posvar was a littauer Fellow in the Graduate
School of Public Administration at Harvard and a research
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Center for International Studies. He was named one of the Ten
Outstanding Young Men in the United States by the U.S.
Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1959.

Dr. Posvar’s special fields of interest have been inter-
national politics, decision-making methodology, systems
analysis, arms control and disarmament, urban planning, and
administration and management of resources for higher
education.

An important theme of his academic and governmental
activities has been an emphasis on long-range planning.

On graduation from West Point, Posvar was com-
missioned a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Force and
advanced to Colonel in "I960. He began his flying career as an
experimental project officer and test pilot in single and
multi-engine aircraft, including the earliest iets. He later flew
in the Berlin Airlift. He held a rating as Command Pilot and
was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Air Medal. He was a
member of a small long-range strategic planning staff in the
Pentagon from 1954 to 1957, where he participated in the
formulation of basic new doctrines and programs.

Posvar has many professional and civic associations.
These include serving as trustee of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, trustee of the Rand Corporation, direc-
tor of Eastern Airlines, director of the Pittsburgh Symphony
Society, and director of the Metropolitan Pittsburgh
Educational Television among others. He is a consultant for the
General Accounting office. He has served on the Program Ad-
visory Committee of the Office of Emergency Preparedness
and on the Board of Consultants of the National War College.
His clubs include Cosmos, Duquesne, Rolling Rock and the
University Club of New York City. He has visited more than
one hundred countries.

Chancellor Posvar is married to internationally famous
Metropolitan Opera star, Mildred Miller. They have three

children: Wesley William, age 25; Marina, age 21; and Lisa,
age ‘I6.

With all these activities, Dr. Posvar still finds time to run
every morning. He plays doubles tennis as often as possible.
An avid Steeler fan, Posvar also strongly supports the Pitt
teams. In his ten years as Chancellor he has only missed one
Pitt football game. By making phone calls, finishing
paperwork, and conducting meetings in his car, Posvar saves
time which he spends attending student functions such as
bonfires, the Greek Chariot Race, and the Dance Marathon.

What goals has Posvar realized since coming to Pitt? He
places particular pride in the increased recruiting of minorities
to Pitt, the retirement of the $8 million dollar debt he in-
herited, and the maintainence of dialouge with students dur-
ing a period when this was extremely difficult and unpopular.
Overall, he has attempted to “mold Pitt to the changing
society.”

Pitt's First Lady

In 1950, Dr. Posvar, then a Rhodes scholar, met a young
woman he had known slightly in high school back in Cleveland,
Ohio. She had just signed with the Stuttgart Opera. Her
name——Mildred Miller. They were married the same year.

Despite her demanding role as First Lady of our large
metropolitan university, Mrs. Posvar continues to appear in a
heavy schedule of performances each year.

Known professionally by her maiden name, Mildred Miller
is a meuosoprano with the Metropolitan Opera Association.

Discovered in Germany by the newly appointed general
manager of the Met, Rudolf Bing, her debut was delayed.

Sir Rudolf, in his book 5000 Nights at the Opera, writes of
that night. After signing Miss Miller to a contract, Bing received
an unintentionally funny letter from her new husband, Mr.
Posvar, “informing me that my Cherubino was pregnant." Bing
likes to imagine the couple arguing over who was to write the
letter breaking the news. (I'm not going to write him; you write
him!”)

Reviewers hail Miss Miller as “an appealing, charismatic in-
terpreter, who can hold the listener's attention without distrac-
ting from the essence of a song.”

From her debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Cherubino in
“The Marriage of Figaro”, to her latest roles, performances in
that house have been consistently lauded.

Miss Miller is one of the few opera soloists who also excel as
a recitalist. She performs lesser heard art selections for voice with
diverse chamber ensemble accompaniments. Plunging into the
difficult and demanding art of lieder singing, Miss Miller has
received accolades from the supreme lieder singer of all time,
Lotte Lehman.

These accomplishments for from exhaust her repetoire. As a
recording artist, Miss Miller holds the coveted “Grand Prix du
Disque” for Mahler's “Songs of a Wayfarer”. Before the
programs went off the air, she was a regular on “The Bell
Telephone Hour” and “The Voice of Firestone”. She appears in
the motion picture “The Merry Wives of Windsor”, filmed in Vien-
na.

Mrs. Posvar has not limited herself to opera performances.
She currently conducts voice classes at Pitt. In ‘I972, she es-
tablished the Mildred Miller Posvar Scholarship at Pitt for the
yearly benefit of the outstanding student in any musical dis-
cipline. .

In 1968, both Pittsburgh newspapers named her one of the
outstanding women of the year. She was the only woman cited
by both papers. Nationally, she sits on the Music Advisory Panel
for the National Council on the Arts.

Born in Cleveland, Ohio she started her career singing in
church and school choirs. After high school, she enrolled at the
Cleveland Institute of Music; from there she went to the New
England Conservatory of Music to win the Frank Huntington
Beebe Award for study abroad. While abroad, she married
Wesley Posvar.

Mrs. Posvar has appeared in every major city in 48 of the 50
United States. She frequently sings in Europe, Canada and has
toured the Far East. The White House was the location for one of
her recitals.

Her career in the opera has included all of the well known
meuo roles. Very early in her career she was known as “the little
boy of the Met” because she sang so many young boy roles; her
favorite of them all, Octavian. Lately, Miss Miller has been sing-
ing more women’: roles: Carmen, Rosina in “The Barber of
Seville”, Suzuki in “Madame Butterfly”, Lola in “Cavalleria
Rusticana”, Meg in “Falstaff” and Dorabella in “Cosi Fan Tute".

She has performed with the opera companies of Vienna,
Berlin, Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, San Francisco, Chicago,
Pasadena, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Tulsa, Cincinnati, St. Paul
and the New England Opera Theater.

Over 7000 students received degrees on Sunday, April
26 at the Civic Arena in Downtown Pittsburgh during the
annual Commencement exercises.

In his opening remarks, Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
took an informal, witty approach to the traditional
ceremonies. Dr. Posvar noted that a ‘I00-year span was
represented by the alumni in attendance from the Class of
‘I926 and by those graduates of 1976 who would return to
similar ceremonies in 2026.

Posvar offered that technological advances over the
next fifty years might make the University of 2026 un-
recognixable. “Perhaps you will even arrive here then, if
you are lucky, on a mass transit system." The Chancellor's
remark concerns Pittsburgh's long delayed rapid transit
plans, and the principal speaker, US Secretary of Transpor-
tation, William T. Coleman.

Not wishing the robed Chancellor of Pitt to out-“wit”
him, Secretary Coleman opened his address with a
humorous collection of iabs dealing with Pitt life and
Oakland. The score even, he turned more serious as he call-
ed upon the graduates to look at the nation's problems
with a “new realism”. “Too many citizens in this country
expect immediate pay-offs, and are not willing to accept
compromise, or trade-offs.”

As an example, he cited the need for compromise in
pollution control. We must arrive at an optimal emission
standard for automobiles while maintaining efficient use of
limited fuel resources.

Coleman challenged the graduates to become in-
volved in politics and to wrestle with the important
decisions facing the country. He suggested that the
graduates use their education to bring constant inquiry
about whether the processes of the past are relevant to the
problems of the present.

Ending the bicentennial address, Secretary Coleman
reminded the audience that the American Revolution must
be a continuing one, and that the country founded by the
bold, could not be upheld by the timid.

Shorill NOIIOI is pinned by Dean Enid Goldberg.

One hundred and sixty five members of the School of
Nursing received pins at the ceremonies in Soldiers and
Sailors, on Friday evening, April 23, I976.

The principal speaker, Dean Enid Goldberg, reminded the
graduating nurses of the important role that they would per-
form in the lives of hundreds. Regardless of their age or loca-
tion, regardless of the economic troubles of the world, Dean
Goldberg assured them that they had chosen a profession
which would always be in demand.

Clare Huff and Elizabeth Kaule were named “Keepers of
the light”. They share the honor of being the students in the
graduating class who have excelled in the practice of nursing.

Can't is a word that is tow to ambition;

An enemy ambush to shatter your will;

It's prey is forever a man with a mission

And bows to courage, patience and skill;

So hate it, with hatred that's deep and undying,
For once it is welcome ’twill break any man;
And whatever the goal you are seeking,

Keep trying; And answer this demon by saying

‘‘I can.”

Quoted by Myralinn Beaver, President, Clan of
Nursing, 1976, in her farewell remarks.

A look Back . . .

Graduation ceremonies of yesterday were held on the Pitt
campus. Two locations were once used, including the stadium. The
most popular spot was the lawn between the front of the Cathedral
of learning and Heinz Chapel.

But in recent years, the Civic Arena has played host to the oc-
casion. Inclement weather, increased numbers of graduates and
therefore families in attendance, the Oakland parking problem, and
the difficulties associated with the outdoor event (numbers of
folding chairs, necessary audio equipment, traffic noise, etc.) forced
the relocation to downtown.

 

ALMA MATER

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,
Child of Light and Bride of Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,
Dowered with eternal youth,
Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore,
Dear old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,
God preserve Thee evermore!

First beyond the mountaints founded,
Where the West-road opens free,
Where twin rivers forest bounded,
Merge and journey toward the sea,
In the dawning of the nation
Ere the clouds of strife had cleared,
’Rose Thy rough-hewn habitation,
By our prophet fathers reared.

Close Thy mother-love embraces
All who gather at Thy knee,
Castes and classes, creeds and races,
Mother, are as one to Thee;

Thou who unto knowledge bore us.
In the good old days long gone.
Raise Thy Gold and Blue high o'er us,

Lead and we will follow on.

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,
Child of Light and Bride of Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,
Dowered with eternal youth,
Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore,
Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,
God preserve Thee evermore.

HAIL TO PITT

Down in Smokytown, in Pennsylvania,
In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
We have a University we're all proud of,
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
She stands a mighty fortress ’neath her colors
bright,
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
When forth she goes to battle 'gainst a stub-
born foe
This song will upward go:

CHORUS:
Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! every loyal son,
Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! ’til the victory’s
won,
The Gold and Blue shall wave forever
On high, through fair and stormy weather,
We'll sing her praises far and wide
Until the end of time.

Hoop-hurray! Hoop-hurray for dear old Uni,
Give her a grand old Alleghenee-genac-genac,
We'll wave and cheer for many a year

And sing her songs out loud and clear,

For our University.

When the grand old days of football come
around,
In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
Her rooters at the field will make an awful
sound,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
Down across the field her mighty line moves on,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
They'll sweep the foe before them till the goal
is won,
Then you'll hear them shout:

(Words by George M. Kirk, Col. ’I3)
(Music by Lester M. Taylor, Eng. '12)

“Hail to Pitt"

George M. Kirk was a student in the college in I911
when he wrote “Hail to Pitt".

He soloed the introduction at a Cap and Gown spring
production in the Schenley Hotel. Cap and Gown was a stu-
dent theater company that produced and performed plays,
very similar to today's productions in Stephen Foster
Memorial.

The music for “Hail to Pitt’ was written by the late Lester
Milton Taylor, then a member of the Glee Club and secretary
of Cap and Gown. He played the piano by ear, rather than by
note.

The words and music were printed by Volkweins and
George Kirk, then a three year cheerleader, pushed the tune
as Pitt's fight song.

Kirk is fairly confident that “Hail to Pitt" was the first
college song to be broadcast on radio. KDKA used it when they
aired the first football game in 1911. It may also be the only
college song having in its chorus a college yell.

Mr. and Mrs. Kirk live in Laguna Hills, California. Mr. Kirk
is pictured at right.

‘‘The Panther" as formed by the faculty and students of the University of Pittsburgh, April 9, I920.

WHY THE “PANTHERS”?

Nearly seventy years ago, the Panther came to Pitt.
When in 1908, Pitt moved from Allegheny to the present
Schenley district, the school had no official mascot. The new
surroundings and conditions of Schenley had produced a kind
of apathy among the students. Perhaps the feelings of securi-
ty, organization, and school spirit were left at the old home on
the North Side.

Whatever the reasons for the decline in enthusiasm, a
self-appointed committee of students and alumni met on a
rainy night in the tower parlor of the Phi Zeta Phi house on
Center Avenue. They had come to discuss a way of bringing
the student body out of the spirit stupor.

George M. P. Baird headed the committee. Other
members were Jack O'Connor, Waldie Zreg, Doc Hamsey,
Harry Rizenstein, Karl Davis, Bill McCready, George Kirk, Bill
Knotts, Tim Hurst, Philip Bar, and Les Tayor. '

The meeting generated many ideas. Publicity, yells,
songs, bleacher ethics, parades, music and organizations were
discussed. It also became apparent that an official mascot was
needed. The decision to name the Panther to the position was
unanimous.

The panther had fine qualities. Noble, courageous,

strong, and intelligent, it was a formidable creature with a
fighting spirit. The coat of the animal was nearly the color of
the old gold of the school colors (old gold and blue).

The alliteration of the name, “The Pitt Panthers” was
well liked. Finally, it met the most important qualification that
the committee had established. The panther was a mascot
used by no other college or university in the area (including
WVU and Penn State) and it was a beast whose natural
habitat was in Western Pennsylvania.

The idea that the panther was chosen because of an
association with Panther Hollow and the four bronze statues
that guard the approaches to the bridge is a misconception.
The bronze beasts were not erected until three years after Pitt
became known as the Panthers. In addition, Pitt and
Carneigie Mellon University are not separated by Panther
Hollow, but by Junction Hollow.

At the time of the selection of the panther mascot in
1908, Pitt had a full slate of sports, including football, basket-
ball, track and field, baseball and tennis.

The first panther costume was made in Denver of five
Rocky Mountain panther pelts at a cost of six hundred dollars.

Pan-Hel Council is the representative body of Pitt's
sororities. Sisters of each sorority are elected to a position on
Pan-Hel, and serve for a year helping to formulate the policy
which guides the sisterhood on campus.

The organization establishes the rules which govern the
houses, set pledging policy, and program. They share a role
with IFC in the planning and implementation of Greek Week
and Parent’: Weekend.

IFC

IFC, the lnterfraternity Council, is comprised of two
representatives from each fraternity on campus. The group is
dedicated to the improvement of the Greek system on the
campus.

The organization serves as the governing body for all
member fraternities. It establishes minimum guidelines for the
individual units to follow and also co-ordinates campus-wide
fraternity projects.

Rush activities, intramural sports, the loan fund, and the
judicial board are areas of concern for IFC.

Activities planned by IFC this year included a Thanksgiv-
ing food drive, benefit of the Bayard, Bellefield and Dithridge
neighbors, and the Annual Parent's Weekend activities. They
also co-ordinated Greek Week.

“To be rather than to seem to be”, the motto of Delta Phi
Epsilon, describes the sisters attitudes pretty well. Each sister is
an individual and is recognized as such. With their combined
efforts, the sisters work well together as a group.

Delta Phi Epsilon was founded on March 17, "I917 at
New York University Law School. Eta Chapter, located here at
Pitt, was founded in the 1920's. However, it deactivated dur-
ing World War II. In 1966 it was officially rechartered.

The sorority recently initiated a “new member” system.
That is, when a girl joins the group, she may attend all
meetings and activities, just as the sisters do.

In the fall term, the Deephers welcomed a brand new
mascot to their ranks, the koala bear. The sorority’s colors are
purple and gold and their flower is the purple iris.

Delta Phi Epsilon participated in many activities this
year. Besides participating in Homecoming with Zeta Beta
Tau Fraternity and Greek Week with Alpha Delta Phi Sorority
and Delta Tau Delta Fraternity, the sisters held their annual ice
cream eating contest for charity, and “Frat-tasting Night”
where members of most fraternities on campus compete for
various awards.

To the sisters of Delta Phi Epsilon, “Sisterhood is more
than just a footprint in the sands of time,”

It's friendship

A shoulder to cry on
Someone always being there to talk to
A helping hand
A study partner
Someone to ride the bus with
It's sharing
It's caring
And, most of all,

It's fun.

KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA

The year started off with rush weekend and the party
started out in the cabins. And it really paid off—twenty new
great sisters joined us. In the fall, we had a Square Dance and
all of “the squares” turned “cool.” Every week, time was
taken off to watch Starsky and Hutch. Who would miss that?
Our formal in February was a great success, as was Senior
Night at the Hall. Kappas sent a man to the moon during
Greek Week and we sent a panther on Paul Revere’s horse to
warn our opponents at Homecoming.

Next year we'll especially miss Beauty's tears, Olskie’s
glutiels, Marcia’s touchdowns, Roses’ plants, Lynn and Helen's
comfortable room and all of our seniors.

What a great year!

As you travel through life many things change but you
will always have your ties of friendship with Theta Phi Alpha.
The many memories you collect in the years spent as a sister
will remain vivid in your heart forever.

THETA

Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. is a
public service sorority, founded in I913,
today it has chapters across the United
States and in foreign countries, in-
cluding Haiti, Liberia, and the Virgin
Islands.

The foundation of the sorority is on
scholarship and service, with a special
emphasis on womanhood. These roots
provide a vehicle for young and ex-
perienced black women to work and
grow.

Nationally, Delta is involved in
educational programs, health services
programs, and many community
programs.

The Mu Chapter of the Deltas here at
Pitt is involved with the Nova House for
Young Women, the Home for Crippled
Children, the UNICEF Foundation, and
other charity organizations.

The largest endeavor of the year for
the local group was the annual “Delta
Week" celebration. The week included
spiritual singing, carnival night, a
fashion show, sports events, singing for
Black Greeks, a scholarship award, and
a Cabaret as a finale.

The Deltas strive to promote high
ideals and compassion in all those
whom they contact.

Who is that behind those bars? Luther, that Babboon told
us there was a mixer at the zoo! Jack, J.D., ancl Murrysville
said they recognized some of the girls, but agents Rock and
Lippert said that they weren't their types. Moada, Si, and
Dinorvicx said they felt right at home. Phillips was just hangin’
around being cool when approached by a cougar. Fred
Hinklemar, Weissgriy Crackers, and Quincy went ape and
scared her off. Huck, Carnes, and the Toes were still searching
for the tap in the new home. The brothers weren't in the zoo
long (even though many feel we belong) for Panz used his
head and got us out. But what a shame, the zoo keepers
wouldn't let us take our Ray-Koon home.

The Pitt Chapter of Triangle is a fraternity of engineers
and scientists. TRIANGLE has been on the Pitt campus since
I968 and was officially recognized on April 4, I970.

TRIANGLE is a unique Greek fraternity, this is shown by
the absence of Greek letters in the name. TRIANGLE is also un-
ique because it is both a social and professional fraternity.
TRIANGLE participates in all social events, Greek and
engineering. We RALLY at least two times a week, but we still
manage to fail all of our courses. Within TRIANGLE there are a
variety of sub-organizations such as the varsity drinking team
and the Schenley High School anti-warfare battallion.

TRIANGLE . . . a fraternity of professional engineers,
professional scientists, and professional miscellaneous.

Memories of a graduating Phi Delt: April, 1976

My last year, again another great year to be a Phi Delt.
Generally a rousting good time (as usual) . . . I remember
our midterm rush, yeah that's right, the brothers rushed
people and partied instead of taking midterms, success graced
us too, taking fifteen pledges. Spaghetti dinners and beer
tasting festivals with Coors and Lowenbrau being our special
guests . . .

Greek Week was another crazy time where the mixture
of partying and work always brewed into fun. A toast to our
partners, the SDT’s, the Thetas, and the rollicking, frollicking
Delta Phis, as we enioyed the best Greek Week ever. I will
never forget the giant Big Mac, Fie on Goodness, bobbing for
pieces of grapefruit in a grain punch . . .

So here it is. I guess time to go. I feel torn, knowing that I
am leaving the greatest group of guys, but there again Phi
Delta Theta will carry on in the true spirit of brotherhood
forevermore.

Pi Lambda Phi — Climbing to the Top.

Just two short years ago, Pi Lambda Phi was definitely a
struggling fraternity with its membership hovering around
twenty. Today, with the membership nearly doubled, Pi
Lambda Phi is making its presence felt in many different ways
at Pl".

During Thanksgiving, Pi Lam won the Food Drive
Competition donating much needed food to local
organizations. At Homecoming, a first place award in the
Banner Competition highlighted the week's successful ac-
tivities. During Greek Week, first place finishes in Talent Night
and Overall Spirit brought recognition to Pi Lambda Phi.

With seventeen new brothers and continued con-
tributions to the Barleywater Sing, Freshman Fall Weekend,
Mentor Program, lnterfraternity Council and many other
organizations, Pi Lambda Phi will soon see its place in the sun.

THETA CHI

This was a strengthening year for
Theta Chi Fraternity. We accepted ten
pledges and they all completed their
pledge training to become fullfledged
brothers of Theta Chi.

Our year was highlighted by having
fabulous Friday night stereo zoo parties
and Saturday night band parties
featuring Busch on tap and tequila.

Some very important events this
year were Homecoming, Sweetheart
Ball, Parents’ Weekend, and Thursday
nights at Haddon Hall for most, and
every night at Haddon Hall for some.

The year ended by having our
vivacious little sisters prepare a Sunday
brunch during finals for the brothers.

’The competitive interests of Theta
Chi were broad and varied. They rang-
ed from an undefeated regular season
in intramural football, to winning a hot
dog eating contest, to the frog hunt in
Panther Hollow.

Most of the people at the Greek Formal in the ballroom at the William
Penn, downtown, found enjoyment in relaxing with friends after an ex-
hausting week. The dance floor was always crowded however, with each cou-
ple choosing their own beat and ignoring the onlookers.

The Pitt News. The Panthers. The Golden Panther
Prints. The University Times. The Pantherettes. The Owl.
The Owl?

Every University affiliated publication, organiza-
tion, or team performs or operates under some form of
the familiar “Pitt Panther” name. That is, everyone ex-
cept the OWL, the Pitt yearbook.

Months have been spent researching the material
printed in the opening section of this volume, the history
of the University. Source after source has been used to
cross-check dates, spelling, locations or other important
data.

But with the tremendous amount of information
covering the history of the University, in all our checking
we failed to uncover the history of the Pitt annual. Why
is it known as The OWL?

Lack of information only made us more curious. We
leafed trough through old editions of The OWL. We spoke
with former editors. We rechecked sources. And then, a
breakthrough.

A source (no, not Deep Throat) called our attention
to the poem of Edward Lear, an English nonsense poet.
The tale unfolded that the first crafty editors of The OWL
wanted to be different. Every publication and team
carried the “Panther” banner. Why not choose another?
What two animals got along better than the sweet
swinging OWL and the “cat” of Lear’s well-known
verse? The Pitt OWL thus “married” the Pitt Cat, the
Panther.

Further research shows that Lear lived from ‘I812-
l888 and that the poem was written during his last
years. So indeed, it was around 1907 when the first
volume of The OWL was published. However, the
Panther didn't enter the scene until 1908, when George
Baird and friends met up on Center Avenue (see story,
page 212). But yearbooks then were often completed
and published two years or more after their cover date.
So quite likely, the poem inspired the name.

Research also brings to light the seal of Pitt in
l907——the seal of the Western University of Penn-
sylvania. It pictured a small owl perched in an oval. An
explanation of the seal is not available.

In any case, the first volume of The OWL was dated
1907. It was dedicated to the late Honorable Thomas
Mellon, then the oldest living alumnus of Pitt. He was
the father of Andrew W. and Richard B. Mellon. James
Irwin McCormick was the first editor-in-chief and Conant
Van Blarcom was the first business manager. This, The
1976 OWL,‘ is the 71st volume.

The Pitt News is the official publication of the un-
dergraduate student body at the University. The paper has
been published on campus for more than 70 years.

Editions hit the stands three times a week during the fall
and winter terms and twice a week during other sessions.
Copies are placed at many convenient locations around cam-
pus and are free to anyone who picks them up.

Each issue carries news of the campus. The actions of Stu-
dent Government Board, the Chancellor and the Board of
Trustees, and campus wide events often manage to grab front
page headlines. Pertinent national and local news also
receives coverage.

A new feature of the paper known as the Marquee runs
once a week and lists all concerts, meetings, and special
programs giving time and location.

Sports, editorials, arts columns, book reviews, feature
stories and even want ads appear in the regular editions. The
column l.ivewire operates a write in student problem
troubleshooter. Give the reporters the problem you have with
the Pitt bureaucracy, and they go to work on a solution. The
answers are published for the benefit of all students who may
encounter the same hassles.

The production of the newspaper is strictly a student
operation. From the sale of ads to reporting and photography
to typesetting and paste-up, students are responsible for the
work. Only the actual printing is done by an outside firm.

The Pitt News holds the dubious honor of being the only
anything on campus to continue to use the old university logo
as part of their masthead.

APRIL 1976

BACKSPACE is an undergraduate organimtion
open to all creative writers on the Pitt campus.

Founded January 6,1976, BACKSPACE is an out-
growth of Ideas & Figures, the now defunct student
literary publication. BACKSPACE is controlled by a totally
new staff motivated by very new ideas.

According to the frontispiece of the initial volume,
the purpose of the magazine is to “provide an outlet for
serious writers at Pitt.” In addition, it is hoped that the
magazine “will be a means of letting writers see what
other writers are doing and will also give the members
of the University community the chance to see what we
(the editors of BACKSPACE) think is some of the best
prose and poetry being produced at Pitt”.

The first and only effort published this year shows
great promise for the future. The edition contained 27
pieces by more than a damn student authors. Con-
tributions included both poetry and prose.

WPGH

WPGH is the student radio station at Pitt,
completely operated by undergraduate
students and broadcast on the Oakland cam-
pus. Marathons and Music Specials were the
highlight of the broadcast year.

In January the “BEATLEBASH”, a fifty hour
music spectacular, netted over $1000.00 for
Children's Hospital. Contestants won entire
Beatle libraries. Guest appearnces by the likes
of Commissioner Tom Forester, I30 D.J.'s,
and our own Wesley Posvar added color to the
event.

Ken Scott's “Rock N Rap” interview show
proved such a success this year that it will be
syndicated across the state in 1976-77. He
featured such stars as Nalereth, Geoff
Muldaur, Livingston Taylor, Barefoot Jerry,
and Quicksilver Messenger Service.

64 UPDATE has become a major part of the
WPGH news. The service makes WPGH the
only station in Pittsburgh with campus
emphasis. The election coverage of the stu-
dent station rivaled that of the maior stations
with live on location reports from head-
quarters, interviews with the candidates, and
analysis.

WPGH also brought Pitt students all basket-
ball and hockey games, whether at home or
on the road. Specials like the “Coach Avez-
zano Show” or “Sports on Target” rounded
out the broadcasts.

THE
ENGINEERING
BULLETIN

The Engineering Bulletin is the official
publication of undergraduates within the School
of Engineering, regardless of department.

The editions carry news of interest to the
students, including career information, in-depth
looks at research within the department, and
job market studies.

The staff also compiles a list of pertinent
seminars and programs which could be of in-
terest to its readers.

The Student Food Service Committee is a sub-committee
of the Resident Student Association. Its members evaluate
menus, quality of food, and service. Student members visit
other colleges and universities to further evaluate our system.
They help in planning special events and this year they spon-
sored a very successful pizza-eating contest.

The maior obiective of the Food Service Committee is to
aid the managers of the food service in the collection and dis-
semination of information vital if we are to provide the
highest quality food service possible to the Pitt students and
faculty, and to promote a better understanding between the
employees and the students they serve.

Quo Vadis is an organitation of undergraduate women
who act as tour guides for the eighteen Nationality Rooms and
Heinx Chapel.

Each member completes an intensive training session
covering all aspects of the rooms before giving a tour. All
know the interesting “little” details that make the Nationality
Rooms come alive with each visit. Due to their efforts, the
ethnic spirit of the rooms remains alive in Pittsburgh today.

The group conducts tours for faculty, students, parents,
international dignitaries, and for friends of the University on a
regularly scheduled basis.

The women of Cwens assist at Freshman Orientation
functions, at Lantern Night, and during official University
functions, act as hostesses.

Qualifications for membership are a 3.2 GPA or better,
leadership qualities and an interest in chapter activities.

PITT HOSTS

“What is a Pitt Host?” Well, half of the people on this
campus have no idea of how to answer that question. But
believe it or not, there are many ways to answer it.

A Pitt Host is a studnet who volunteers one hour of
his/her time per week to give a tour for the Admissions
Department. Technically, that is what a Pitt Host does.

Most of the Pitt Hosts will tell you that alot of other things
are involved in addition to the one hour tour. Their role is a
very demanding one, for their words and actions are
sometimes the first and by far the most important and lasting
impression prospective students and their parents recieve of
the University. Many group tours are also given throughout
the year as well. Special functions held by the University use

the Pitt Hosts. International visitors to the University are es-
corted around the campus by members of the Pitt Hosts.

The rewards for being a Pitt Host are not material.
However this year, the Dean of Admissions arranged a private
party at the LeMont Restaurant to show his appreciation for
the time donated. The experience gained by each individual
through this public relations exercise is immeasureable.

Perhaps the biggest thank-you comes in September
when a freshman approaches you and thanks you for the tour,
telling you that you were one of the main reasons they chose
Pitt instead of another college, and that they are really happy
here.

MENTORS

The Mentors are a group of upperclass men and women
who facilitate and implement the Orientation Program by
functioning in the capacity of a friend, peer group counselor,
and as an information-referral person so as to provide the new
student with vital information on academic and social
programs, student organizations, and the University services
and facilities. The process of facilitating Orientation includes
such specific responsibilities as group meetings, contact with
Freshmen on a one-to-one basis, attendance at departmental
seminars, participation in various academic programs, and be-
ing available to their group of Freshmen.

The comprehensive training of the Mentors includes
Current Problems 28, a course dealing with the many aspects
of the University and its functions, four Saturday Training Labs
in which helping skills are learned and peer group counseling
is the objective. Listening, communication, and personal in-
teraction skills are emphasized for the Mentors in the Human
Relations l.ab held just prior to the June Orientation session.

The office is designed to provide the new students at the
University of Pittsburgh with an opportunity to examine
various academic programs, services, and activities at the
University.

The largest aspect of the program is the four day
Freshman Orientation Session in June each year. At this time,
the entire Freshmen class comes to the campus for testing, ad-
vising, registration, and a variety of academic, professional,
and service seminars. Each freshman spends the time learning
in a small group about the fine points of a major urban univer-
sity, namely Pitt. The time is often spent pursuing those topics
that most interest the group. The group also serves as a
“starter” for a friendship circle that will last for four years and

more. All of these activities are planned and integrated by the
trained Mentors. The group fills an important function.

In June, contact is made with the freshmen by the
Mentors. The ongoing concept of Orientation is then carried
out by the Mentors throughout the summer and into the
academic year by means of letters and personal contacts.

Programs conducted in September and Januaary are
designed specifically for students relocating from the regional
campuses or those transferring from other institutions.

The Society of Women Engineers is an active organization
on campus, whose main goal is to educate, inform, and en-
courage potential and graduate women engineers. Pitt's
chapter includes fifty participants of the 3,000 member inter-
national organization.

SWE’s accomplishments range from the fun and frolic of
participating in Homecoming 1975 and Engineer's Week to
more serious business, namely, tutoring students in math,
chemistry, and physics. The group also conducted conferences

and hosted many representatives from corporations.

Pittsburgh's oldest incline—the Monongahela—was
designed in the 1870's by a woman engineer. Overlooking the
picturesque Golden Triangle, the incline is still being used to-
day by Mount Washington residents. The Society of Women
Engineers proudly cite the Monongahela Incline as an exam-
ple of the scope of women's capabilities in a previously male-
dominated profession.

PITT Y.M.C.A.

Pitt YMCA—the solution. That's the attitude on the fifth
floor of the Student Union as the volunteers swarm out to
cover the needs of the community.

The projects of the group cover five areas of action:
Education, Mental Health, Corrections, Community, and
Health. The programs under these five areas encompass many
community groups, and include age groups from children to
adults and the aged.

Under the ABC Program, volunteers tutor neighborhood
school children in all subject areas, including Math, English,
languages, and science.

Project One-to-One allows the student to establish a very
personal relationship with a needy individual in the surroun-
ding community. This area includes those adults in need of
companionship.

Other programs include instruction in Tax Assistance,
and work with mentally retarded children and adults located
at WPIC and Marcy. Children at the School for the Blind in
Oakland find a much appreciated friend in a YMCA volunteer.

One of the most exciting and commendable programs of
the Y this year was the lndiantown Gap Project. With the
flood of refuges pouring in, volunteers were there to teach
English, arts and crafts, and to begin instruction in American
sports. The homeless were given shelter, all were assisted
with food and clothing.

The members of the YMCA worked well at the Gap, ex-
perienced one-to-one relationships with the Vietnamese peo-
ple, and brought home rich memories of their time at the Gap
while reaching out with a helping hand.

The Buffer System is a nursing singing group founded by
the School of Nursing, Class of I972. Membership is open to
any sophomore, junior, or senior nursing student with a desire
to sing and the diligence to attend weekly practice sessions.

The name, The Buffer System, was a unanimous choice
selected by the group one evening after a particularly
stimulating “Braley lecture” in pathophysiology. (Buffer
systems play a vital role in preserving homeostasis in the
human body).

Most performances of the group were at nursing func-

tions. The maior performances this year were: Big-Little Sister
Nursing Tea, Junior-Senior Nursing Banquet, the Nursing
Senior Pinning Ceremony, and the Senior Graduation
Ceremony.

The group also performed informally by Christmas carol-
ing at Children's Hospital, Eye & Ear Hospital, and
Presbyterian-University Hospital.

The group is under the direction of Rita Bolek. Lenore
Mathias serves as iunior co-ordinator and Sally Muse serves as
the librarian. Miss Mary Scarry is the advisor.

The Commuter Association is a
small band of highly dedicated
individuals who work for the Pitt
commuter.

Services early in the year in-
cluded the once famous “Com-
muter Bandit". The bandit was a
club member who ran parking
meter to parking meter (always
three ahead of Rita the maid)
plugging nickels into those that
flashed ‘Violation’. He would
then leave a note for the driver,
informing him that he owed 5c to
the CA. The bandit then dashes
on to further frustrate the now
frowning meter maids.

Other services performed by
the group included day time
programming (movies, concerts
and lectures) at the noon hour so
that commuters might indulge in
the same entertainments that
amuse the residents.

Overnight accommodations,
alleviation of the Oakland park-
ing problem, and class schedules
for the commuter were other
areas of concern for the club this
year.

The Society of Automotive
Engineers is an organization
devoted to promoting interest in
and providing technical informa-
tion for all facets of the transpor-
tation field.

This year the Pitt chapter has
been very active in career
guidance for its members. Of
special interest is the career day
program which affords each
member the opportunity to spend
a work day with a professional
engineer. This experience
provides valuable information
about a particular area of interest
to a student who feels he may be
interested in the occupation as a
lifetime career.

The Eleanor Roosevelt Club is a koffee klatch that has
made a cliche of its motto “Elegant but Crappy”.

Originally founded by T. Roosevelt (1859-1919) in 1921
while he was in a despondent mood over his continuing
death, the club was formally enioined in 1935 when the
Volstead Act was repealed.

Besides carrying on philanthropic acts, the club is
primarily a forum for discourse and abfuscation of current
topics by the four men and one plane.

Some of the topics which had recently been discussed
were: 1) The T.V.A. which promised a television and aerial in
every home; 2) the piua embargo of 1937 by Mussolini; 3)

the effects of falling stock market quotations on English
professors.

The club generally meets every Friday evening at 5 P.M.
for supper. Formal dress is never required but suits and dresses
are appreciated and denims are the norm. Mealtimes are the
times when such figures as E. St. V. Millay, A.S. MacPherson,
and F. Perkins of the Women's Auxiliary join the men. At these
meals, current topics are discussed for five minutes then pan-
demonium at the first “Faux Pax” breaks out with verbose
statements of sarcastic iabs, redundant, boring quips, and
perverse leers. The Club is now working on a New Deal from
the bottom of the deck.

COMMITTEE

The Medical Action Committee, a branch of the un-
dergraduate Student Government, is a group of students con-
cerned with health care at the University. Primarily, the com-
mittee is interested in providing the best health services for
students at the least cost. Working closely with the Student
Health Service, Student Government, and various other health
agencies, the Medical Action Committee provides the follow-
ing services each year: I) Referral Services for any problem the
student may encounter, including referral for abortions,
asthma, rape, eye care, pregnancy, epilepsy, and even contact
lense purchase. 2) Diagnostic clinics are conducted twice a

year. As shown on the facing page, tests are performed for
high blood pressure, height and weight determination, vision
testing, hearing testing, blood work, urinalysis, and sickle cell.
Results of the tests are sent to each patient.

In addition to these tests, the committee works on the
student insurance policy, conducts seminars, and provides in-
office diagnostic testing for some medical problems.

The committee is open to all students at the University,
regardless of class, major, or QPA. The only requirement for
membership is an interest in others and a desire to learn some
clinical aspects of medicine.

towards early detection of health
problems, thus greatly improving the
chances for complete recovery from a
given illness.

The University of Pittsburgh Men's Glee Club is the oldest
extracurricular organization on campus. It was founded in
1890 by twelve men known as the Mandolin and Banjo Club.

The Glee Club has performed throughout the East, New
England States, Midwest, South, and Mexico. A trip to Europe
in May was the highlight of the year with concerts in London,
Paris, Venice, Florence, Assisi, and Rome among others in such
famous halls as the Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster
Abbey, and Notre Dame Cathedral. In Rome they performed
at the Vatican in a special Papal audience.

Members of the Club sold records all year and at home
football contests to raise the necessary funds for the trip. The
record contained five traditional Pitt tunes including the

of top quality singing at the University. The group is constantly
expanding and updating their concert program, to insure wide
popular appeal.

Maintaining such a schedule consisting of selections from
all classes of music from the classical artists to the popular
folksingers of today dictates a demanding routine.

Interested students are welcomed as members and as

Omicron Delta Kappa is an honorary recognizing
leadership among junior and senior men and women at the
University of Pittsburgh. During ‘I976, the Pitt chapter proudly
celebrated its sixtieth year on the Oakland campus, being ac-

Through the years, ODK has upgraded the initiation
ceremony, making it perhaps the best on campus. On April 7,
1976 the largest group in the local chapter's history was in-
itiated. This is a sign of the growing popularity and the in-
creasing numbers of capable, interested leaders at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

Due to the responsibilities that the members have in
other organizations on campus, ODK participates in no service
activities. The group does sponsor monthly dinners where
members can meet and discuss problems and solutions that

Gamma Theta Upsilon is an international honorary
geography society. Before joining the organization, a student
must complete at least three geography courses, maintain a
3.00 or better QPA in Geography, and at least a 2.5 overall. It
is not necessary to be a geography major before one may join,
but a genuine interest is a definite requirement.

Within the organization, two levels of membership exist,
a local and international. Dues are paid to the international
organization once and this entitles the student to a lifetime
membership. The international organization sponsors annual
conventions throughout the United States and Canada,
operates a loan fund, a scholarship fund, and publishes a jour-
nal of student academic work.

The local organization at Pitt holds monthly meetings.

They conduct outdoor activities such as canoeing, backpack-
ing, and caving. The local chapter conducts service activities,
such as blood drives and Christmas toy campaign for orphans.
Other events sponsored by the group were trips to local
engineering firms and laboratories, mines, caves, steel mills,
social events such as bowling parties, iceskating parties, and
Christmas parties, and speeches by individuals from city,
county, and federal agencies.

G.T.U. gives the student members an opportunity to
meet the faculty of the Geography Department on an informal
basis to discuss ideas, problems, and projects. The students
also obtain information relating to academic work and future
employment.

Alpha Epsilon Delta, the International Premedical Honor
Society was formed by fifteen premedical students on April
28,1926 at the University of Alabama. Today, Alpha Epsilon
Delta is the world's largest body devoted to premedical educa-
tion with membership exceeding 50,000.

Membership in Alpha Epsilon Delta is an honor bestowed
upon a student by fellow students in recognition of superior
scholastic achievement. Completion of at least three terms of
premedical work with a scholastic standing of 3.0 on a 4.0
scale are the minimum requirements for active membership.
Character, general ability and personality are also carefully
considered in the selection of every member.

Alpha Epsilon Delta serves to encourage and recognize
scholastic excellence among premedical students, provides ac-

tivities for the intellectual development of individual members
and provides a program of service to the campus.

At the University of Pittsburgh, the Pennsylvania Gam-
ma chapter hold meetings of interest to premedical students
as part of its chapter activities. This year these programs in-
cluded medical films, on Emergency Health Care program, a
talk on surgical research opportunities by our Faculty Advisor,
Dr. Marshall Webster, Jr. and a program on Women in
Medicine.

Important services performed by the chapter included a
Bingo party at Children's Hospital, a question and answer ses-
sion for Junior pre-meds about medical school application
procedures and an opportunity for members to view surgery in
the domes at Presbyterian-University Hospital.

Eta Kappa Nu is the only national
electrical engineering honor society and
selects its members from the top third
of the senior class and the top fourth of
the iunior class.

The Beta Delta chapter at the
University of Pittsburgh began its ac-
tivities in the fall of ‘I975 with five ac-
tive members. The chapter holds
biweekly meetings. This year they
organited programs of tutoring ser-
vices, instructor and course evaluations
for the EE department.

The tutoring program was on a
volunteer level for the members of the
chapter. The course evaluation con-
sisted of a questionaire developed by
the members and distributed to the EE
classes. The analysis of the results
provided a good mechanism for
creating awareness within the faculty
of student needs and opinions.
Departmental policies that affect the
students are also discussed.

As a result of the fall activity, 25
new members ioined in January. An in-
itiation banquet was held at Stoffer’s
with Mr. Nellie King, colorman for the
Pittsburgh Pirates, as guest speaker.
This term the chapter continued to carry
on the activities begun in the fall, and
in addition participated in Parent's
Night.

ﬁboba ‘Phi Omega

Alpha Phi Omega is the National Service Fraternity
founded in 1925. With foundations in the principles of
leadership, friendship, and service, the Pitt chapter is deeply
involved in providing the University and the community with
manpower for worthy projects.

The group is very proud of their open-membership policy
and their no-hazing initiation ceremonies.

The major project of the group is the semi-annual Book
Exchange held at the beginning of each term in the Student
Union Venetian Room. The photos on the facing page show
well the volume of material handled by the brothers.

Other services provided by the chapter include keeping

score each week for blind bowlers, checking coats at official
University functions, escorting handicapped persons in
Oakland, helping the Boy Scouts with their annual Christmas
tree sale at the Western Pennsylvania School for the Blind,
painting at neighborhood detention homes and offering low
cost movies in Benedum Hall each term, with all proceeds go-
ing to charity.

The chapter encourages brothers to participate actively in
other campus organizations as a means of developing
leadership potential. They also welcome interested men from
the University community who share these same ideals to join
them.

 
 
 
 
 
  

The brothers of Alpha Phi Omega prepare several thousand
volumes for sale at the Book Exchange. They are assisted by the
sisters of Gamma Sigma Sigma.

Members of the University community bring books they
wish to sell to the Venetian Room, where they quote the price.

The editions are then displayed according to subiect area
and interested buyers may purchase their choice for the stated
price plus a dime service fee.

Students have found the Book Exchange price to be much
better on both the selling and purchasing side than that offered
by any neighborhood book dealer. Alpha Phi Omega donates the
service charge to charity each year.

REGIONAL
CAMPUSES

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

JOHNSTOWN

Designed to “strike a whole new balance in education”,
the campus of the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown is a
marvelous experiment. When moving to the present site in
1967 the idea came to life—the chance to build a campus on a
beautiful, wooded estate tied to a major urban university.

The 710 acres of the UPJ campus allow you to step out of
cl professionally equipped electrical engineering lab into a tree
lined study area, criss-crossed down the way by a biology

nature trail. Nestled in the woods two minutes away you can
find modern dormitories.

The four year programs offered at UPJ emphasize career
oriented education while fostering opportunities to bring a
diverse interdisciplinary background to bear on real life
situations. The primary goal is to establish connections
between what is learned and how it applies.

 

The University of Pittsburgh at Bradford (UPB) is located on
a newly developed 125-acre campus in beautiful northern Penn-
sylvania. Near New York State on north-south Route 219, UPB is
close to excellent ski slopes; the scenic beauty and recreational
facilities of Alleghany Reservoir (site of Kinzua Dam); and
Allegany State Park of New York.

UPB offers a unique learning experience by providing the
advantages of its own smaller campus with access to programs

University of Pitts

and facilities of the main campus.

Through this association, the following diverse
educational opportunities are available: four-year degree
programs in Liberal Studies or Behavioral Science; two-year
programs in Humanities, Natural Sciences and Social
Sciences; two-year Associate of Science degree in Petroleum
Engineering Technology; two-year certificate program in
Data Processing. -

burgh at Bradford

  

The Sock and Buskin Drama Club presents a major
production each term and sponsors theatre trips to New York
City. The Bradford Choral Society, sponsored by UPB, presents
two major concerts annually. Delta Chi is an active fraternity
at UPB. Other clubs are: Engineering, Radio, and Photography.

The Children's Annual Christmas Party, Parents’
Weekend, Freshman-Sophomore Football Game and Picnic,
Winter Week (highlight of the social calendar), and the In-
tramural Award Banquet have become traditional at UPB.

At UPB, under Student Government Association spon-
sorship, students participate in a variety of organizations. For
the athletic-minded, there are intramural sports, inter-
collegiate teams in golf and basketball, and Hockey, Riding,
and Bowling Clubs. Additional activities include: canoeing,
hiking, camping, hunting, fishing, and water-skiing. Students
with an interest in writing and iournalism can work with the
student newspaper, “The Liberal Review” and write for
“Frame Works”, a student literary magaxine.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT TITUSVILLE

Located on a wooded estate four blocks from center
city, The University of Pittsburgh at Titusville provides
students with a very quiet, personal atomsphere in
which to begin their higher education. Designed to assist
students in making the transition from high school to a
larger urban university, UPT offers unique programs.

Presently, 350 students attend day and evening
classes taught by "I2 full time and ‘I0 part-time faculty.
With a student-teacher ratio of 20-1, classes are small
and personalized. Students may complete two years of
work at Titusville before moving to the main campus.

The expanding UPT campus includes administrative
offices in McKinney Hall, natural science lavs in the
Bennet Davis Memorial Laboratory Building, a new
library facility, a student union and dormitory space for
250 students. Ninety-six of these students live in the
latest in residence hall design, town house style
apartments.

320

Located only 90 miles from the main
University campus, students from UPT
are bused into Oakland to attend home
football contests, concerts and
academic and cultural programs. An
active Student Government Association
plans many activities in Titusville. The
campus has its student newspaper and
a student operated Dramatics Club
program. The basketball team com-
pletes an organized schedule and in-
tramural athletics are conducted year
round. The mixed glee club presents
several concerts a year.

In addition, students may “spend a
night on the town”, partaking of
movies and productions by visiting
groups of the performing arts. The
town of 7500 is very senic and heavily
steeped in history.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT GREENSBURG

The University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg is one of the
fastest growing branch campuses of the University. Located in
the center of Westmoreland County, UPG is only 30 miles from
the Oakland campus. Regular public transportation routes
connect the two centers, making it easy for students at
Greensburg to utilize fully the resources of the large urban
campus, while protecting the personal nature ofthe academic
experience.

The most visible signs of accomplishment at the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh at Greensburg in 1975 are the building pro-
iects that have been substantially completed during the year.
In May Powers Hall, a multipurpose structure currently being
used primarily as the campus library, was dedicated. In Oc-
tober, construction began on a Student Activity Center; and
throughout the year work advanced rapidly on the Science

Building-Classroom Complex.

On January 6, 1976, students returned to find that the
Science Building-Classroom Complex was ready for use and,
for the first time in UPG’s history, the campus was centraliled
in one location. Work on the Student Activity Center was com-
pleted in February.

Also dedicated in 1975 was the Kenneth E. Bell Memorial
Nature Trail, which offers an opportunity to enjoy the 160-
acre campus’ unique natural setting.

UPG’s growth during the year was not confined to its
physical plant. Most notable was the increase in the number
of students majoring in two of the baccalaureate degree
programs that can be completed at Greensburg, Business Ad-
ministration and Administration of Justice. Courses in earth
and planetary science were also added to the curriclum.

In addition to these new programs,
an internship program was establish-
ed, in cooperation with Westmoreland
Hospital Community Mental Health
Center Consultation and Education
Department, to allow students to ob-
tain credit for practical service to
schools, day care centers, and correc-
tional and mental health facilities.

looking forward, UPG officials plan
to continue expanding the School of
General Studies programs to include,
among other, interdisciplinary offerings
and area-of-concentration programs.
They also hope to continue cooperative
efforts with Saint Vincent College,
Seton Hill College and Westmoreland
County Community College. With the
completion of the Science Building, UPG
now has the physical facilities to pre-
sent seminars, mini-courses and one-
day conferences staffed by various Pitt
professional schools as well as other
organizations.

THE CLASS

The Class of I976—a unique collection of men and
women eager to move on to stations uncertain, a group of in-
dividuals standing at the edge of the unknown.

There have been many important, exciting, and
memorable events and people in the times before ours. Con-
sider the Great Society programs. The racial unrest of the six-
ties. The Vietnam war. The World Wars. TheGreat Depression.
Henry Ford and the Model T. Charles Lindbergh crossing the
Atlantic. The moon landing. JFK. The Salk vaccine. Babe Ruth.
Korea. D. L. Lawrence. Pope John.

These were all crucial turning points or ﬁgures in “the as-
cent of man”. Without them, we would be far down the
ladder. Nonetheless, while thankful for the contributions of
the previous generation, the Class of 1976 must now shoulder
the responsibility for the continued success of mankind. The
Class of I976 has held the unique privilege of working for and
earning an education in one of the most historic times man
will ever remember. We must now use that education.

We banded together as a class four short years ago, just
as the nation was bracing itself for “four more years”. For the
first time in the history of this country, on the eve of the 200th
birthday celebration, we sat stunned as those four short years
were cut even shorter by a resignation on August 9, 1974.

Today, names like FDR, Joe Louis, Duke Ellington, and
Clark Gable no longer capture the imagination of the world.
Folk heroes have taken their place in the past. Today, the
newspapers display different names every day, and for the
first time, they include those of women.

The scope and variety of events has become immense
and continues to grow at lightning speed. Events in foreign
countries which once took months to receive coverage here,
are now the “pacemakers” of our economy and our political
system. It is no longer a question of isolation versus participa-
tion. The question now concerns the degree of participation. A
nation-state no longer has domestic affairs and foreign affairs.
Today all nations participate in international affairs.

Consider a list of headlines and newsmakers over the
past four years. As you read, iot mental notes about each.

Chiang-Kai-Shek. Pablo Picasso. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.
Dean. Mitchell. Ehrlichman. “Woodstein”. Vietnam. Attica.
The CIA. The FBI. Archie Bunker. The Plumbers. Beame and the
troubled Big Apple. Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Tapes,
Transcripts. MRV’s, MlRV’s, MARV’s, and SST’s. Skylab.
Skybus. Potholes. Loopholes. Biafra. Hurricane Agnes. Franco.
The travels of Henry. The $2 bill. Kohoutek. Gay Liberation.
Heart transplants. Northern Ireland. Charles DeGau|le. Wage
controls. Price freezes. Patty Hearst. Women at the military
academies. Boycott’s. Sexism. Racism. The Final Days. Tuition
hikes, Kickbacks. Dentente’. Beef shortages. Grade inflations.
Grain exports. Brain drains. Eagleton. Apollo-Soyuz.
Women's Lib. Steinem. Walters. Caldwell. Rhodesia. Our long
national nightmare. Ozone. A generation of peace. Hiiacks.
Kidnaps. . .

 

l%

A list could be endless. But let this one suffice to prove a
point. The scope and depth of the issues before the “average”
citizen today have become more complex. They are more
demanding. A well informed citizen must delve into politics,
the arts, economics, natural science, medicine, literature, and
religion. The age of readin’, writin’, and ’rithmetic is over.

These changes can be explained in many ways. Probably
some of the better are improved communications, improved
transportation, and widespread increased education.
Regardless of the reasons, the pressure, the demand to func-
tion efficiently and effectively or team with the losers is here.
Now, more than ever before, that demand challenges the
Class of I976.

Never before have a group of men and women been so
challenged. The Class of ‘I976 is unique. Hopefully, Pitt has
prepared us to meet the challenge.

On the following sixty pages we present nine hundred
and five members of the Class of 1976.

lntermingled with the senior portraits are line drawings
of various University landmarks. The artist is David Lowry.

These outstanding prints were made available to us by
the late Joe Colangelo, the then Director of University News
and Publications. Thanx also to Jim Hohmann, Chief Designer,
University News and Publications for his aid, time, and trust.

Added to the line drawings are photographs of the nine-
teen Nationality Classrooms which surround the Great Com-
mons Room in the Cathedral of Learning. All photographs are
by the Owl staff.

These rooms are the dream come true of Dr. John G.
Bowman, Chancellor of the University in 1926. He provided
the initial stimulus which led to the formation of Nationality
Room Committees which are active today

In the aftermath of World War I, with the nation about to
plunge into the Great Depression, these committees were
formed of proud Americans—doctors, steelworkers, lawyers,
housewives, priests, professors and students. They were both
wealthy and poor, immigrants and native Americans.

Committees were organized abroad as well, in Athens,
Kaunas, Budapest, Prague, Bucarest, London, Dublin, War-
saw, and Cracow to search for the finest architects and artists
to design and furnish the rooms.

There followed a period of intense ethnic heritage studies
with very real goals: the rendering in wood, stone, glass,
metal, fabric and painting of outstanding cultural con-
tributions of Old World civilizations.

And so today, as we celebrate our nation's 200th birth-
day, we thought it fitting to present here, with the senior por-
traits, an outstanding reminder of our rich ethnic heritages,
embodied so well in the Nationality Rooms of the Cathedral of
Learning.

The mantlepiece above the sandstone fireplace
is the dominant obiect in the Scottish Room. The
bronze statuette depicts ‘Sir William Wallace, a
famed national hero, and the oil portrait is of
Robert Burns. All the woodwork of the room is im-
ported and specially carved with detail. The frieze
circling the room is carved with the symbols of the
Scottish clans, symbolizing strong will and wit ioin-
ed for mutual betterment.

The German Classroom, inspired by the great
hall at the University of Heidelberg (the oldest
German seat of higher education) is filled with
sixteenth century German architecture and
craftsmanship. The fine walnut paneling in the
walls and ceiling contrast with the oak flooring.
Window seats, student armchairs, and the doors
are decorated with stenciled arabesques. The
stained glass windows depict the world famous
Grimm fairy tales. A large bookcase in the rear
wall contains a collection of volumes donated
to the University by the German Ministry of
Education. The Goethe inscription in the shield
above the case reads “Great mastery results
from wise restraint, and law alone points out
the way to |iberty."

“The Two Kings” by
Mikaloius Kastantas
Ciurlionis as a fresco on
the rear wall of the
Lithuanian Classroom.
The trees are Lithuanian
forests, which cover a
dark and uncertain past.
Among the branches are
stars, points of hope.
Against this uncertain
background stand two
kings. One holds
something very bright, a
jewel, which the other
guards with his sword. In
the center of the light is a
Lithuanian village-
thatched cottages, white
birches, willows—the
most precious possessions
of Lithuania.

The Greek Room, showing the simulated portico
of a Greek temple. The marble columns supporting
the frieze were quarried throughout Greece. The
cost for this project was underwritten by the Greek
government. Costa Mastora, the most experienced
stonecutter in Greece, who prepared most of the
marble for the reconstruction of the buildings on
the Acropolis, supervised the cutting, carving and
polishing of the marble for the Greek Room.

A photograph of the large Jagiellonian globe found in the Polish
Classroom. This globe is an enlarged copy of the original, on which it is said that
America first appeared as a separate continent. The original globe belongs to
the collection of astronomical instruments at the Jagiellonian Library at Cracow
and dates to 1510.

The cornerstone of the Polish Room also comes from the University of
Cracow. It was taken from the collection of fragments at the University
museum that had been preserved from the Collegium Maius, now the Jagiello-
nian Library, the oldest of the University buildings, dating to ‘I364.

The heavy carved oak door to the room was carved in Pittsburgh by a
woodcarver from Lwow. The doorknob is a bronze replica of the one on the en-
trance door of Wawel Castle, the ancient symbol of the Polish nation. At one
end of the room, a large oil painting of Copernicus, the famous Polish
astronomer, can be found. It is a copy of the original by Jan Mateiko and was
made in Cracow. Also to be found in the room is the manuscript of Jan
Paderewski’s only opera, Manru. It is on display in a special cabinet.

Polish President Edward Girek and his wife visited the room on a special
trip in 1975 to honor the University of Pittsburgh for its educational exchange
programs with Polish universities.

The Swedish Classroom was opened in June,
‘I938 to celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of
the coming of the Swedes to Pennsylvania. His Royal
Highness, Prince Bertil and one thousand Americans
of Swedish descent attended the dedication.

The rear wall, shown at the left, depicts the
Three Wiseman riding dawn to Bethlehem to see the
baby Jesus. A fourth panel contains a likeness of St.
Catherine.

The richness of the room is displayed in its many
painted decorations. Executed by the Swedish artist
Olle Nordmark, they are known as fresco secco. (Dry
fresco, earth colors mixed with lime water brushed on
plaster.) The walls are constructed of two hundred
year old bricks covered with many coats of thin white
plaster, giving them fine texture and keeping them
gleaming white.

The fireplace in the famous outdoor museum in
Stockholm, the Bollnéis Cottage in Shansen serves as a
model for the fireplace in the Swedish Room. The
firetools were hand made by Ola Nilsson, cl Swedish
blacksmith from McKees Rocks who reconstructed
them from memories of the ones in his childhood
home in Sweden.

The Penalty of Leadership

In every field of human endeavor, he that is first must perpetually live in the white light of
publicity. Whether the leadership be vested in a man or in a manufactured product, emulation
and envy are ever at work. In art, in literature, in music, in industry, the reward and the punish-
ment are always the same. The reward is widespread recognition; the punishment, fierce denial
and detraction. When a man's work becomes a standard for the whole world, it also becomes a
target for the shafts of the envious few. If his work be merely mediocre, he will be left severely
alone—if he achieve a masterpiece, it will set a million tongues wagging. Jealousy does not
protrude its forked tongue at the artist who produces a commonplace painting. Whatsoever you
write, or paint, or play, or sing, or build, no one will strive to surpass or to slander you, unless
your work be stamped with the seal of genius. l.ong, long, after a great work, or a good work
has been done, those who are disappointed or envious, continue to cry out that it can not be
done. Spiteful little voices in the domain of art were raised against our own Whistler as a
mountebank, long after the world had acclaimed him its greatest artistic genius. Multitudes
flocked to Bayreuth to worship at the musical shrine of Wagner, while the little group of those
whom he had dethroned and displaced, argued angrily that he was no musician at all. The little
world continued to protest that Fulton could never build a steamboat, while the big world flock-
ed to the river banks to see his boat steam by. The leader is assailed because he is a leader, and
the effort to equal him is merely added proof of that leadership. Failing to equal or to excel, the
follower seeks to deprecate and to destroy—but only confirms once more the superiority of that
which he strives to supplant. There is nothing new in this. It is as old as the world and as old as
the human passions—envy, fear, greed, ambition, and the desire to surpass. And it all avails
nothing. If the leader truly leads, he remains—the leader. Master-poet, master-painter, master-
workman, each in his turn is assailed, and each holds his laurels through the ages. That which is

good or great makes itself known, no matter how loud the clamor of denial. That which desires

to live—lives.

TWIXT YOU AND ME

Twixt you and me,
There's too much emotion,
That's the reason why,
There's such a commotion.

Take a lump of clay,
Wet it, pat it,
And make an image of me,
And an image of you,
Then smash them,
Crash them,
and add a little water.

Break them and remake them,
Into an image of you,
And an image of me,
Then in my clay,
There is a little of you,
And in your clay,
There is a little of me,
And nothing ever,
Shall us, sever.

Living,
We'll sleep,

Under the same quilt,
Dead,

We'll be buried together.

SPECIFICATIONS

The 1976 OWL was printed by Inter-Collegiate Press
located in Shawnee Mission, Kansas. The company was
represented in Pittsburgh by Mr. Ray Hill.

The limited press run produced ‘I600 copies of the 416
page edition. All paper in the book is 80# gloss enamel. Cap-
tions are set in 6 point solid Techno Bold, while the body copy
is I0 point Techno Bold. Headlines are set in many varieties of
print, but we made heavy use of both Techno Bold and
Geotype, an exclusive transfer type designed by Inter-
Collegiate Press.

The historical photographs in this volume are from the
Carnegie Photo Library, Oakland, Pennsylvania. Photographs
of the regional campuses were submitted by the respective
campuses. All other black and white photography contained
in the book is the work of student photographers, all members
of the OWL staff.

Color photographs are from Ektachrome slides shot by
OWL photographers. Film processing was" by Kodak at
Rockville, Maryland, while prints are Type R, processed by
Kodak in Rochester, New York.

Senior portraits were produced by Carol Studios, Inc. of
Lynbrook, New York. The company was represented in
Pittsburgh by Mr. Robert Friedman. The photographer was Mr.
Joseph Gagliano.

The line drawings contained in the senior section and on
the end sheets are by artist David Lowry.

The cover design is by the staff, in line with the theme of
the book. It is printed in natural color on litho cloth wrapped
on I60 point binders board. The entire cover is treated with
Reflecto-Tone to prevent the color from burnishing off.

All layouts are by the staff, designed especially for this
Bicentennial issue.

United States Congressman Sam Rayburn once said,
“Any iackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a good
carpenter to build one.”

So it is with anything, a college annual no exception. By
the time the first reader glances at these pages, it will be some
twenty months since work began on the I976 OWL.

A volume of this site and scope is no task for a single per-
son. I owe much to many. A dedicated staff of fellow students,
numbering well over seventy as we broke from the starting
gates, but dwindling to less than five stout souls as we cross
the finish, have endured. Without their untiring efforts—cut-
ting dates, “ruining" free weekends, cramming for exams
because of late nights at the office—the book couldn't be the
same.

Much assistance also came from persons not members of
the staff. Thanx to University Archivist Lee Jamison for her ef-

forts assisting us while researching the University history. And
to Audrey Furcron of the Carnegie Photo Library for her help,
more gratias. Mr. Bob Newcombe of the Bradford campus
provided much needed help with the Regional campus section.
To the late Joe Colangelo, then Director of University News
and Publications, and Chief Designer Jim Hohman for the use
of the Lowry prints, we are thankful.

To Mr. Bernard Koperek, Director of Development and
Alumni Affairs, and to Mr. Lester Sullivan of the same office,

we owe a dramatic increase in advertising and sales. We owe.

thanks to Rick Stouffer of the Pitt News staff, the author of the
football copy. Mr. Golden of Liberty Mens Formals, East Liber-
ty, gratefully loaned photo props. It was a welcome kindness.

Bob Friedman of Carol Studios has done everything we
asked. I shall forever remember. His service was terrific, and
entailed much more than the senior portraits. Ray Hill, my ad-
visor from Inter-Collegiate Press, has spent countless hours
commenting, criticizing, and assisting in every way.

I owe a very personal thanks to my parents. Long after
the secretary's contract had expired, they remained, typing,
proofreading, and matting. Without them, it would have been
a much longer haul to the finish.

And to many others, who made contributions just as im-
p_ortant, thanx. We hope you enjoy our efforts. We have
attempted here to preserve for all time a piece of Pitt, if you
will, a glimpse of what it was like in '76.

Widening the appeal of the book to include all classes of
the University, and not just the seniors as is tradition, and also
reaching out to the alumni, attempting to keep them informed
and aware of their Alma Mater, has been an enlightening
responsibility. The challenge of satisfying the tastes of some
123,000 possible readers and their families led us to include
the history, the indepth coverage of Pitt sports, (and for the
first time, in four color) the glance at the truly unique
Nationality Rooms, the gallery of senior portraits, and finally,
a sampling of campus life and activity. We've bound the
volume in a cover filled with the faces of Pitt, the many faces
of Pitt, the very life of the University.

And finally, as part of the theme development, we've
eliminated divider pages, instead allowing events to be
reported as they happened, one after another, with little ap-
parent order. We thought it reflected the real situtation.
Things and events at Pitt don't come in neat little packages.
Everything and one runs together. ‘

I hope you enjoy it. It's been a thrill to produce. I hope it
helps to keep your memories fresh and alive, never to fade, for
as the great Russian author Dostoevsky said “even if we are
occupied with important things, even if we attain honor or fall
into misfortune, still let us remember how good it once was
here, when we were all together, united by a good and kinc
feeling which made us better perhaps than we are.”
