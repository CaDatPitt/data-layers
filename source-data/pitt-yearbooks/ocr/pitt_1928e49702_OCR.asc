PITT PLAYERS

IN the beginning the group held a meeting. Mrs. MacQu_een brought Puppy and Pitt Players
was organized. Adhering strictly to tradition, precedent, and parliamentary form, the
band split into majority and opposition, with Don Brown singing bass. Majority called itself
Players; opposition called itself Technical Staff; so they elected a president. Y-Hut-Jim served
applesauce and cabbage salad. From the chaos came Pitt Player Policy. « joe Cameron growled,
Puppy moaned, Mrs. MacQueen left, Don Brown pulled Alex Shaw's nose: Pitt Player Policy
was deﬁnitely ﬁxed. Four weeks later, Milt Braumen hit on the happy idea that Pitt Players
be a Dramatic Organization. The magniﬁcence of the pun carried the plan even over the heads
of the Technical Staff.

In spite of Puppy and Abe Savage, Wartzel-Flaniinery, Spring, and Carina Garden; were put
on in rapid succession. Belinda also ran. T/ac Servant in t/or Home, famous Three—Week Play,
climaxed the year's program. Dame Rumor has it that Beg/ona’ the Horizon will be tacked on to
the season after the Owl has gone to press.

Audiences often attend the plays—real audiences which laugh and guffaw at each bit of
pathos, and smack their lips when the Players are so indiscreet as to kiss each other on the
stage—audiences which snicker and sneer and comment on the players, playing, lighting effects,
and scenery, just as do Vanity Fair audiences.

During intermissions Abe Laufe substitutes for Fred Ellwood on the piano,~and by the
way, Pitt Player footlights are headlights really, don't you know.

GIRLS’ GLEE CLUB

N the fall of 1922, after a lapse of several years, the Girls’ Glee Club was reorganized through

the efforts of Morter Board and under the direction of Mr. T. Earle Yearsley. The climax

of the 1922-23 season came at the concert of the combined men and women's musical clubs at
Carnegie Hall.

During 1924-25, Mrs. Charles Mayhew of the Pittsburgh Musical Institute, was elected
director, and the Girls’ Glee Club began a successful year which included a trip to Eric and a home
concert. Mrs. Mayhew again directed the club in the year 1925-26 and the club gave many
successful concerts in adjoining towns and over the radio. The year again ended with a trip,
this time an exchange concert with the Girl's Glee Club of the University of Cincinnati.

This year Mrs. James Green accepted the vacancy left when Mrs. Mayhew received an offer
from Oberlin. The personnel of the club has greatly increased and a number of interesting con-
certs have been scheduled in the towns in the vicinity. The organization is making plans for a
trip to Detroit, and for their annual home concert in Carnegie Music Hall.

The aim of the Girls’ Glee Club is to raise the standard of musical appreciation and to pro-
vide music for campus activities.

CAP AND GOWN

ONG, long ago, my little co-eds, when ﬁfty—two was just the number after ﬁfty-one, and
twenty-nine had no particular signiﬁcance; when Panther was a furry little cub, not old

or wise enough to ban open-house because of a bent cork-screw on the lawn; when May meant
Migratory; in fact, so long ago that Seniors did not consult “Who's Who” on being asked about
Gordon, Haig, Baccardi, or Bourbon; there was a Junior who admitted that he knew nothing
of the workings of a woman's mind. At the same time he harbored secretly an ardent desire
to fathom these mysteries. On his return from an evening's research on the subject, he did not
regale his fraternity brothers with glowing-hot, even white-hot accounts of his experiences.
He was so different from the general run of Dormitory Don Juans, that Minethagold, Goddess
of the Co-Ed, resolved to reward him. Accordingly, she met him one night and granted him
the customary three wishes. His first wish was that he know the truth about the workings of
the feminine mind. Minethagold frowned, then sighed, but, having made her oath, whispered
seventeen words into his ear. The Junior fell back in amazement and abject disillusionment.
Cursing mightily, he clutched the Goddess around the throat and hissed his second, his only
other wish “Give me the power that, on the most potent day of the Season of Illusionment, I
may enable men to learn the truth concerning the workings of a woman’s mind." So saying
he ﬂung her from him, and walked down the steps in horrible meditation on the seventeen words.
Through his new-found knowledge he achieved an early death, and matriculated in Heaven.

********>l<***

Now you know and I know that on nights in early May, a number of people pass along the
walk above Heinz House, and that this number is exactly divisible by two, the quotient being
the number of men students who pass along that walk. Junior, in order to wreak his vengeance
upon Co-Ed-kind, and in order to impose upon mankind the agony of disillusionment, stations
himself on the walk above Heinz House on that most potent night of the Season of Illusionment,
and changes into girls all men who pass him. They who
are thus transformed, to save themselves from the ridicule
of their fellows, mount upon a stage and cavort fever-
ishly, proclaiming that they just pretend to be girls in
order that they may produce Cap and Gown.

On the next morning, having partaken too freely of
coca-cola with aspirin, these chaps know nothing of
having been girls and think that they only impersonated
them for Drama’s sake.

But the world has an unreasonable drabness.

THE PITT BAND

HROUGH the efforts of Oliver and Dr. E. Miller, both of the class of '06, Pitt Band was

organized; and through their efforts, too, a fund of thirty-ﬁve cents per capita was created

for band uniforms. The eight original members who had between them seven instruments bor-

rowed from Becker’s music store, bought scarlet, blue tassled, felt hats with their dole.

Although a brass—buttoned, professional band was hired for the more important games, the
student band was allowed to play at some of the minor ones.

Today, the band, chosen with a view of obtaining a well balanced concert group, is con-
sidered one of the best organizations of its kind in the country. It has a personnel of sixty—four,
with budget provisions for a yearly increase of ten men. Its uniform is blue, the cape gold-
lined, the military hat blue with a stiff gold plume. The band is no longer barred from im-
portant football games, but has advanced to the dignity of concert work, in which ﬁeld it has
achieved a nation-wide reputation chieﬂy through the work of M. S. Rocerto. Each year, the
band climaxes its activities with a series of home concerts given in April. The fame of the group
has grown to such proportions that at tryouts each year there are over three hundred appli-
cants. Those who gain admittance are rewarded with a bronze key for one years service, a
silver key for two years, and a gold key for three.

This year Richard Skidmore, the student leader of the band, has written "The Fight Song,"
which was introduced during the football season. “On, Pittsburgh," 21 song written by Edward
Blistwin, manager of the Band, has been played in the past year, though the words were written
too late to be sung at any of the football games.

UNIVERSITY CHORUS

NIVERSITY Chorus was organized in February, 1927. Starting with Men's Glee Club,

Dental Chorus, Girls' Glee Club and the Cap and Gown Club as a nucleus, it is planned

to bring together in this new organization all those students who are interested in music.

Students having any vocal talent, even though they are not members of any of the above organ-

izations, have been urged to enroll. The membership list now includes about one hundred and
ﬁfty names.

The Chorus was introduced to the Campus at the Charter Day services, in February. It has
also appeared at the regular general assemblies of the University. The climax of the season
will be the presentation of several selections at the June Commencement Exercises.

In order that the members of the newly organized chorus might become better acquainted
with each other, a tea dance was held at the Heinz House. This affair was a great factor in
promoting that spirit of friendliness among members.

Dr. Wright, a graduate of the Dental School and at present an instructor there, coaches and
conducts the Chorus. Under his guidance the Chorus has made a ﬁne start . Plans for the next
season are now being perfected.

COMBINED MUSICAL CLUBS

OMBINED Musical Clubs, the Oldest non-athletic Organization on Campus, has been from

its inception a major activity. At the present time membership is competitive. Because

of this, the group has produced each year a musical organization which ranks with the finest in
the East.

The Musical Clubs make more public appearances during the year than any other school
Organization. Two trips were made this year to cities in the Tri-State district, and twenty-
three concerts were given during the season. Both local concerts and trips serve to stimulate
an active interest on the part of the members.

For the first time in its history, the Glee Club competed in the annual state-wide glee club
contest, held in Pittsburgh, February 18, 1927. Other schools which participated in this con-
test were Pennsylvania State College, Bucknell University, Juniata College, Washington and
Jefferson College, and Carnegie Institute of Technology. Pennsylvania State College, winner
of the local contest, went to New York to compete in the National Contest of College Glee Clubs

YOUNG l\/lEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION

. M. C. A. is a student organization whose purpose is to render service to the men students

of the University. The “Y" Hut serves as a social center and a meeting place on the

campus; approximately 500 men are attracted to the Hut daily. Many clubs, organizations,

and fraternities use it nightly for a meeting place. The Student Council appointed by the
president under the direct supervision of the executive secretary plans the year's program.

In the fall of 1926, over 2,000 freshman handbooks, Fray}: Biblex, were issued free to the
incoming students. A Freshman camp was held in September at Camp Kon-O-Kvvee, to intro-
duce the new men to Pitt ideals and customs, and a Church Reception Night was sponsored by
the Church Relations Committee when all the churches in the vicinity held a reception for the
students of each denomination. The Community Service Committee has been responsible for
securing Pitt men to act as Volunteer club leaders at Rankin Community House and Lawrence-
ville Y. M. C. A. The Deputation Team Committee is an important activity on the “Y" pro-
gram; the members visit the different churches and young people's societies to speak on many
subjects. The Social Committee arranged various social events, including the Freshman-
Get-Together and a Medical School Banquet.

The “Y” Hut. The “Y" program are supported by contributions secured from the stu-
dents, faculty, and friends of the University. A ﬁnancial campaign is launched each fall to
secure these funds.

During the Christmas holidays seventeen men representing Pitt were sent to the National
Student Conference at the Milwaukee, and about the same number goes each June to the summer
student conferences at Silver Bay at Lake George, N. Y. and at Eaglesmere, Penna.

YOUNG WoMEN’s CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION

HE Young Women's Christian Association during its seventeen years on the Pitt Campus

has held as its ideal the broadening of the spiritual side of the college girls life.

Mrs. L. T. Gibbs, wife of the former head of the English Department, was inﬂuential in
organizing Y. W. at Pitt in 1910. The next summerjean Donaldson was sent to the Y. W. con-
ference at Dennison University, and in the following year she was appointed Organization Chair-
man of the Association.

One day, six Y. W. members rolled up their sleeves and spent an hour in their mother's
kitchens making fudge and seafoam, which they sold in Thaw Hall. In this way enough money
was procured to send two delegates to Kansas City Student Convention. Candy Stand became
a Pitt institution.

Helen Frost Dice, now wife of the University Librarian, was president during the next two
years. She inaugurated “Dairy Lunches" which were served in 105 Thaw Hall, and which
were very popular with the men of the faculty. Under the presidency of Florence Teagarden,
now assistant professor of psychology at Pitt, Y. W. began to assume its present form: weekly
meetings were held; there were occasional socials; delegates were sent to Eaglesmere; Y members
did social service work.

In 1915, the only office that the Y. W. had was a post office box in the rest room in State
Hall; but during the next year there were a hundred members, ten girls teaching at Kingsley
Settlement House, and two Bible classes. The organization supported a teacher at Canton
Christian College.

Now the Y. W. has a comfortable oﬂice in the Heinz House where Miss Helen Battrick, the
Executive Secretary, talks over problems and plans entertainments and courses of study with the
girls.

Welcoming the freshman co-eds during the ﬁrst week of school by carefully planned noon
teas, the University branch of the Y. W. C. A. has taken one step in making the new freshmen
feel the Pitt spirit. Weekly meetings are held at the Heinz House led by prominent ministers
who discuss Bible texts. Interpretative playlets are given to celebrate Christmas and Easter.

Y. W. C. A. sponsors the Big and Little Sister movement. The committee assigns to each
freshman an older girl who introduces the newcomer to Pitt life and gives to her information
and advice.

Each Christmas dolls are dressed and distributed among the poor by the Freshman Com-
mission of Y. W. C. A.

Discussion groups, arranged to study religious problems of world interest, one “China
under World Fellowship," and another “The Establishment of Friendly Relations Between
Races" are a part of Y. W. C. A. life. Candy stands are taken care of by members of the organ-
ization in University buildings.

Y. W. has been successful in its ﬁnancial drive as well as in its membership campaign far
exceeding the expectations of most ardent workers.

YouNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN’iS
HEBREW ASSOCIATION

STUDENT members of the new Young Men and Women's Hebrew Association are organized

in a separate group from the others, conducting their own activities for Pitt students as well
as participating in general events. Student Council, elected each February by members of the
“Y," acts as the governing body. It is composed of representatives from Pitt, Carnegie Tech,
Duquesne, P. C. W., and Teachers’ Training School.

The group sponsors religious, social, intellectual, and athletic activities among the students.
During the 1926-27 season a student synagogue was presided over by a Pitt freshman, Sidney
Eiges, each Friday evening. Besides a reception and dance for incoming freshmen, the organ-
ization held a Purim dance and several smokers. Book teas are held each month. Athletic
activities included a handball tournament.

MEN'S DEBATING ASSOCIATION

EN'S Debating Association fosters forensic activities on the campus. The Association

holds a large number of intercollegiate and intermural contests on questions of current

public and university interest, and endeavors to give to as many as possible the opportunity to
speak in public.

The program this year has included graduate, freshmen, and extension debates as well as the
usual encounters with other colleges. The extension debates, usually intermural, are held before
men's clubs, church groups, and high schools.

The 1926-27 season opened with a graduate team meeting Oxford University on the subject
of Tariff or Free Trade. As the Englishmen spiced their jokes with an occasional plunge into
statistics, and the Pittsburghers pointed their hard facts with a few well-timed shafts of wit,
the encounter proved at once entertaining and instructive.

Following Oxford came the annual triangular debate with Pennsylvania State College and
Washington and Jefferson College on the subject of the Cultural and the Practical in Higher
Education, and shortly after, Emory and Henry came to Pittsburgh to exchange ideas on the
same question. The freshman team during the early weeks of the second semester engaged
Washington and Jefferson in a dual debate on the cancellation of the war debts, and shortly after
the varsity met the University of Buffalo on the same subject.

In April and May debates are scheduled with Harvard University, Boston College, and West
Virginia University, all at home. A western trip is also contemplated.

The association also has charge of oratorical activities and conducts every year a contest,
the winner of which represents the university in a national intercollegiate oratorical contest.

Membership in the association is open to all who try out for the debating team or otherwise
indicate interest in forensic activities.

During the absence of Professor Parrish on a year’s leave, coaching is under the direction of
Ross Scanlon and C. K. Thomas of the Public Speaking Department.

WOMEN'S DEBATING ASSOCIATION

LTHOUGH the Women's Debating Association was founded at the University of Pitts-
burgh in October, 1921, it was not until the following year that a deﬁnite program was
realized when Marie Messer, Theresa Kahn, and Teresina Marino reorganized the group. At
thepresent time, debating activities are under the supervision of Theresa Kahn of the English
department. The group has inaugurated a new policy of debating before high schools and
various women’s organizations. The teams met the University of Cincinnati the ﬁrst semester
in a dual debate; in the second semester, they met Juniata College, New York University, and
Swarthmore College. The organization of a freshman debating team has been an event of this
year.

ARCUS CLUB

RCUS Club was founded in the fall of 1924 by Mildred Pickrell, also a charter member of
Cwens, Nancy Jennings, and Frances Reitmeyer, whose purpose was to form an organ-
ization that would oﬁer non-fraternity girls opportunities for becoming better acquainted with
other girls, and familiar with campus activities. The membership has lately been restricted
to upper class girls of C average. Membership in Arcus does not entail forfeiture of the right
to be pledged to a Greek letter society.
The club is mainly a social organization. A number of parties and bridges are held during
the school year. At Christmas time the club donates its services in the making of stockings for
the annual Christmas party.

HE cocarde, or rosette, a symbol of the traditional red and blue of Paris and the white of

the House of Bourbon, adopted by the French people at the outbreak of the revolution

of 1789, forms the insignia of Le Cercle Francais, an organization of students interested in the

French language, customs, institutions, and their cultural development in American universities.

Members of the group speak in French at the meetings without the formality of classroom

supervision and criticism. Programs are given by members of the French faculty and university

students. Interesting discussions led by Mrs. Jeanne R. Butler, who told of her own life in

Brittany, and Miss Ethel Saniel, another member of the French faculty, who told of her travels

in Roumania, added interest to several of the meetings this year. The club's only social event
of the year was a Halloween party in Heinz House.

RESERVE OFFICERS’ TRAINING CORPS

HE Department of Military Science and Tactics is composed of a coast artillery and a medical
unit of the Reserve OHicers' Training Corps. Both units are authorized by the National
Defense Act of 1920. In maintaining the branches of the service here, the University of Pitts-
burgh takes its place with other leading educational institutions of the country in making plans
effective in time of peace, for developing trained reserve oﬂicers who can be utilized in a national
emergency. I
While the primary purpose of the R. O. T. C. is to establish corps of experienced leaders for
national defense, it also aids in developing its members physically, giving them a training which
will be invaluable in their civil pursuits.

STUDENT BRANCH
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS

H AM proud of having been a president of this organization," said Alexander Graham Bell,

who served as national president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1891.
A roster of past presidents of the Institute contains names famous throughout the whole engineer-
ing world. Professor H. E. Dyche, head of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Pitt,
is a member of the A. I. E. E. membership committee.

The local chapter, organized October 6, 1915, holds weekly meetings with student speakers,
and also gives several social affairs throughout the year. Membership is limited to juniors and
seniors studying electrical engineering.

Three national conventions are held each year. The mid-winter convention is perhaps the
most interesting for it is devoted to the presentation of technical papers, and to inspection trips
to points of engineering interest.  G. Jarrett is chairman of the student branch this year,
H. I. Metz is vice-chairman and D. P. Mitchell is secretary-treasurer.

C. N. C. W.

“ O foster higher scholarship and friendship among the negro women of the University of
Pittsburgh" was the fundamental idea in planning the organization of the Council of
Negro College Women.

The initial feature in the activities of the organization was the vocational guidance con-
ference for negro high school senior girls. Local speakers discussed the various vocations.
In 1925, after it had received recognition from the university authorities, the Council broadened
its program. A charity box and entertainment was given to the Home for Aged and Inﬁrmed
Colored Women. The W. S. G. A. Commission and the Y. W. C. A. Cabinet were the guests
of the C. N. C. W. at a Pirate Tea Party. Miss Jessie Fauset, novelist and an editor of the
Cririr, spoke on "The Fields of Education Open to Negro Women." The program for 1926
1927 was exceptionally well-planned and included several talks by prominent people on the
subject, "Negro College Women."

COLLEGE ASSOCIATION

THE desire for a greater unity of spirit and action in the College, as well as the wish to pro-
mote the social interest and general welfare of the students in the university, was respon-
sible for the formation of the College Association by a group of interested students this year.
Any student enrolled in the College or any College faculty member is eligible to membership.

Two social functions were given during the past semester; one an informal dance held in
February at the Hotel Schenley, the other a formal ball at the same place in April.

The association cabinet, the governing body, is composed of the officers of the association,

BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ASSOCIATION

THE Business Administration Association was organized during 1921-22, with the purpose of
creating a spirit of unity among the students of the School of Business Administration that
would aid the members in their college work, that would provide social interests, and that would
promote their Welfare as a body Within the University.

In 1925, an active chest fund was created by assessing each member of the association.
This fund enabled the organization to provide for entertainment and election expenses.

The year 1926-27 has been the most active in the history of the organization. During the
ﬁrst semester, the Association entertained a large group of students at an informal dance at the
Hotel Schenley. A dance and party were held during the Christmas season.

With a membership of six hundred, the Business Administration Association is one of the
largest and most active school groups on the campus.

DOWNTOWN STUDENTS’ ASSOCIATION

GROUP of students interested in the development and advancement of social interests and
the promotion of the commercial welfare of the students of the Evening School, organized
the Downtown Students’ Association in 1910.

Membership, while formerly limited to students in the School of Business Administration,
now includes those students registered in the College, Graduate School, School of Education
and School of Engineering, who are taking courses in the Downtown Division of the University.

The social program for the year includes a Christmas dance, a men's smoker, a girls’ party,
a spring banquet, and the June Prom.

WoMEN’s ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION

HE Women’s Athletic Association was founded primarily for the purpose of promoting
higher physical efficiency among the women at Pitt. By enlisting student cooperation,
fostering inter-class athletics, and presenting an ever-broadening sport program, the Women's
Athletic Association has grown from a small group of ﬁve girls to an organization which in-
cludes hundreds, and which is recognized as one of the major associations on campus.

The rapidity with which the organization has grown is indicative of its popularity. In
1919, Margaret McClenahan and Ethel James, two members of the varsity basketball team,
organized the Women’s Athletic Council which, two years later, Was reorganized on a per-
manent basis as the Women's Athletic Association. In a period of seven years, the organization
has greatly increased its membership and is steadily gaining friends among Pitt women.

From the meager athletic schedule of 1919 (varsity and freshman basketball), the Women's
Athletic Association has expanded to the extent that it now controls the following well organ-
ized schedule of sports: hockey, basketball, volley ball, swimming, golf, archery, hiking,
baseball, tennis, dancing, and life saving. An accurate point system is employed in rewarding
the successful players with association pins and insignias designating the different Pitt teams.

A social program has been developed with the other activities of the organization. The
yearly schedule includes the traditional Co-Ed Prom, the popular “Buggy Ride," “pep" rallies,
and “mixer-" dances.

In this way the association adds to the traditions of itself and the schools. In this way,
also, has the growing membership been accompanied by the fulﬁllment of all the original
hopes. The Women’s Athletic Association takes its place with the leading bodies of the
campus.

INTEPVFRATERNITY BALL

ORDES of frolicking Greeks invaded the lobby of the Schenley Hotel on the night of

January twenty-first. They stood ﬁve deep around the water~cooler; they formed long

lines at the checking room; the men struggled with obstreperous collars and ties; the girls ﬂaunted

chiffons and shawls, jeweled slippers and ﬂashing vanities. Then came a rush to the ballroom

as Ted Brownagle sounded the call to the frolic of the Greeks. Interfraternity Ball was one
frolic after another.

The members of the committee had done their best to give the party a digniﬁed atmosphere;
they had gathered classic palms around the Victor Recording Orchestra; they had decorated the
panneled walls with conventional shields bearing the letters of each of the fraternities of the
Council; they had stationed Bill Dufﬁnbaugh, elaborately tuxedoed, at the doorway. But it
was useless. The Greeks had brought with them too gay a humor to be anything but noisy,
rollicking, dancing Hellenes. Bill Duﬂinbaugh had been warned by the hopeful committee
that there would be a big crowd, but Bill hears that story so often that it no longer carries weight.
He was mildly surprised when three hundred and six couples presented the necessary credentials
for entrance to the Schenley Ballroom.

But on top of all this, Interfraternity Ball of 1927 established a precedent. It gave useful
favors for men. It is bad enough to give favors to men, but to give useful favors is monstrous
and should be looked into. This smacks of feminine machinations. In fact it seems almost
Machiavellian. But above all it is a dangerous precedent. Nevertheless, we congratulate the
committee.

Interfraternity Ball is a blessing to humanity: it is our first real excuse, to break New Year's
resolutions about not spending so much money.

The 1928’ Owl

IuN1oR PROM

N an exotic garden where wisteria and smilax trailed over balconies, where blue, then yellow,
lights tinted the soft air, we danced. For a moment the moon silvered the stately, velvet
draped windows of the grand ballroom of the William Penn; then a lavender ray slipped from the
purple darkness of the balcony and shimmered on the crystal ball that twisted until fainter
lavender, almost violet-scented, dripped down on the dancers. Again the velvet blackness,
sobbing with melody, closed in on us, dancing alone. A sax blared a scarlet note that shed
the veiled light of dawn across the dazzling chandeliers. Ruby, scarlet, red drops of light
glimmered above us as we danced, danced into orange, yellow, gold. All the gayness, the color
of Spanish shawls and golden jewelcasks glittered before us, and we were part of this glowing
color. The velvets, chiffons, georgettes, and the glowing black and white of tuxs mingled
together in lesser rainbows under the golds and greens.

At ten o'clock William McKee, chairman of the Prom committee, led Miss Mabel Bradﬁeld
through the mazes of green draped pillars to the arched doorway. In and out under the balcony,
coiling and recoiling, the trailing procession moved across the gleaming ﬂoor, to receive favors
and programs. In the buzz of the next few moments when silver lights twinkled high above
us, the men sauntered about while the ladies gathered in groups, bowing, smiling, nodding at
the slender mirrors that reﬂected massed rainbows of color.

Again dreamy melodies drifted from the swaying palms in a dim corner of the ballroom,
where Ollie Naylor and his Victor Recording Orchestra strummed banjos and whistled bits of
tunes. We forgot time, everything, as we moved in and out of soft violets and living reds.

Blinding lights ﬂashed on, and for a moment we paused as though we saw the ballroom with
its blue velvet drapes, ivory walls, and moon-ﬂooded balcony for the first time. “Extray,
extray! Prom Pom Buzzard, extray!" A dozen newsboys scrambled across the ﬂoor and shoved
the papers into our faces. The words jumbled before our eyes. We turned the page. AL
LUNG LEE screamed in bold face on the inside page. Up and down the sheet, scandal and
caustic thrusts at those who stalk across the campus or whisper over the shoulders of the near-
great, glittered before us. But again the music drifted across the room, dreamier than before:
colors moving, twisting, turning . . . . .

PITT WEEK

HE first event planned for Pitt Week is a general University Assembly in Memorial Hall on

May twelfth. This Assembly will be primarily for the purpose of rewarding those men

who have distinguished themselves at Pitt. Druids will tap freshmen and sophomores who

have shown unusual ability in activities and scholastic work during the year. O. D. K. will

tap Juniors and Seniors who have been prominent on the Campus during their years in school.
After the tapping Senior Honors will be awarded.

An interfraternity track meet in the Stadium is scheduled to follow Assembly. In the
afternoon there will be tea dances both at the Heinz House and at the Faculty Club. Varsity
Night will complete the day's program with stunts and music presented in the collegiate manner.

On the morning of the thirteenth, passersby will witness a Poverty Parade. All Pitt stud-
ents will put on disguises, various and rather terrible, to meander up and down the Drive shout-
ing joyfully. Soph-Frosh Rush follows the parade.

Pitt Week is very gallantly reviving old customs this year. Even the long-neglected push-
mobiles are now being dragged from fraternity attics, dusted oﬂ", oiled and polished to appear
once again in the Grand Sweepstakes. Old grads will weep for joy and certainly the undergrads
will give the big allegenee as the pushmobiles swing around the curve at Baird and Bigelow.

Athletic Co-eds and even those who never venture to the regions of Trees Gym will compete
in the Scooter and Roller Skating Race the same afternoon.

The last event of Pitt Week is to be the Mardi Gras in Motor Square Garden. Ross Gorman
and his Colombia Recording Orchestra have been engaged to furnish music for the carnival
dance.

JOURNEYINGS TOWARD FABLED ISLANDS THAT LIE BEYOND THE SETTING OF THE SUN

 

 

HEN sunlight swims above the bare trees, when only hardy

asters ﬂaunt themselves against autumn winds, when leaves,
crisp and brown, drift in the gutters, then I would throw myself
down on a warm meadow and watch the smoky sky. Leaves whirr
down incessantly; a brook splashes over gray rocks and slips along
the ﬁeld trailing a wisp of foam along its placid coolness; a column
of smoke rises from a low chimney. But dusk comes and I
must be wandering back towards the lamps of the village, gleam-
ing through diamond window-panes. I catch glimpses of andirons
shining in the ﬁrelight and the golden heads and round eyes of
children over bowls of bread and milk. I loiter in my garden, but
I do not dream of an hour before the fire when tea is brewing,
of a winter evening when I would curl up on the hearth to read
Montaigne while apples pop and cider bubbles, nor of strawberries
and cream on a June morning. I wonder if Sweetness and Light
can satisfy when we are cold and hungry for reality. Then I ﬁnd
that my hillside is a gaunt clump of rocks; the ﬁrelights and lamps
are the livid glare of gas jets, and my garden, a straggling alley way.

INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL

HE Interfraternity Council, composed of two representatives from each of the eighteen

leading social fraternities on the campus, maintains close relationship with the fraternities.

It also serves as a medium through which a closer relationship is formed between the fraternities»

and the University. A representative is sent to New York each year to attend the meetings of

the National Interfraternity Conference. In this way the Council is in constant touch with
problems at other large universities and with conditions existing elsewhere.

Athletics play an important role in the conference. Each year, the Council, with the co-
operation of the Athletic Association of the University, sponsors the Interfraternity Basketball
League. Track meets and other athletic events complete the competition.

Interfraternity Ball, the first formal of the college year, is one of Pitt's traditions. It is
directly under the auspices of the Council. Several interfraternity smokers are given each year
by the individual fraternities.

Semi-annually a silver loving cup, the gift of John C. Fetterman, former Dean of Men, is
awarded to the fraternity in the Council which has attained the highest scholastic average.
The rushing and pledging of men is governed solely: by the Council.

ELTA TAU DELTA was founded at Bethany
College in 1859, for purely fraternal pur-
poses. The oldest chapter which now exists is
Gamma at Washington and Jeﬁerson College.
Gamma Sigma Chapter was first established as
Iota Chapter of Delta Tau Delta in 1864, and re-
established as Eta Beta Chapter in 1878. The
chapter went out of existence when a ban was
placed on fraternities at W. U. P.
Delta Tau Delta returned to Pitt Campus through
Alpha Alpha, a local, founded in 1904, which was
granted a charter as Gamma Sigma Chapter in 1914.

IGMA KAPPA P1 was organized as a local frat-

ernity in 1916 With an active chapter of_twenty—

five members. After four years of spirited activity,

the organization was granted a charter by the

Kappa Sigma Fraternity and on October 20, 1920,
was installed as the Gamma Omega Chapter.

The growth of the chapter has not been phe-
nomenal but has come along gradually until now
it holds one of the most prominent places on the
University campus. It is backed by an alumni
association of 150 members who take a lively
interest in all of the chapter's activities.

PHI DELTA THETA

PENNSYLVANIA IOTA

 

HI DELTA THETA, one of the oldest Greek
Letter Fraternities, was founded on December

26, 1848, at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. The
fraternity has had a steady conservative growth
throughout the United States and Canada, having
96 chapters at present and a total living member-
ship of over 30,000. Phi Delta Theta with Sigma
Chi and Beta Theta Pi, each of which was founded
at Miami University, form the Miami Triad.
Pennsylvania Iota, the local chapter of Phi
Delta Theta, was formed by the absorption
in 1918 of Delta Sigma Pi, a local frater-
nity that had been founded in 1908, before
the University moved to its present campus.

HI EPSILON PI was founded November 23,
1903, at the City College of New York.
Urged on by its progressive and democratic doc-
trines its expansion was phenomenal, and in but a
brief period it was ready to take an honored
position in the fraternity world. It now has
twenty-four active chapters and eleven Alumni
chapters. Its aim is to promote a lasting comrade-
ship among the membership of the whole fra-
ternity.

Following this principle, Zeta Chapter of Phi
Epsilon Pi was installed at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh on December 26,
1913. Supporting all activities, cam-
paigns, and undertakings, Phi Epsilon
Pi devotedly takes pride in everything
that Pitt accomplishes.

U CHAPTER OF PHI KAPPA was organ-

ized January 24, 1921, by a group of Cath-

olic students as Psi Delta Chi. Two months later
the University granted recognition to the organiza-
tion and in May of the same year a home was ob-
tained in the North Highland district of the city.
In May 1922, Psi Delta Chi became the Mu
chapter of Phi Kappa. Shortly afterwards the
fraternity purchased the home it now occupies at
the corner of Bayard and Belleﬁeld Avenues. The
acquisition of a home in the very heart of the
fraternity district gave added impetus to the
activities of the chapter.

I RHO DELTA, local social fraternity, was or-
ganized June 5, 1921, with twelve members.
School was about to close for the summer months,
and these twelve students, who had been associated
in their studies and activities, decided to band to-
gether and establish a social fraternity so that they
might share in each other’s ideals and social life.
Procuring a house at 235 Darraugh St eet, the
fraternity grew rapidly and in October, 1921, the
University authorities gave oﬂicial recognition.
In January, 1924, the Inter-Fraternity Council ad-
mitted the organization into the Conference.

0 band together Jewish students of worthy
character that they might spread the doc-
trines of fraternalism, that they might themselves
be beneﬁted, and that they might bring credit and
honor to their college, Sigma Alpha Mu was or-
ganized on Thanksgiving Eve, November 26, 1909,
at the College of the City of New York.

Not until 1913 was expansion in other cities
attempted, but since then the number of chapters
has increased steadily until there are now nearly
forty groups located in prominent universities.
Fraternity co-ordination is aided by the Regional
Advisory System established in 1920.

The local chapter, Psi, was installed in
1919.

HE Fraternity of Delta Xi Omega, prior to its
founding as a fraternity, was organized on
the campus as a club. In order to give its members
the advantages of Greek letter organization, how-
ever, and also to afford them an opportunity to
more effectively help each other in the pursuit of
sound learning, participation in extra-curricular
activities, and social life, the group took the name
of Delta Xi Omega in October 1923. University
recognition was accorded them in May 1924.
In March 1927, Delta Xi Omega received its
charter as Pennsylvania Delta Chapter of Theta
Kappa Nu.

PANHELLENIC ASSOCIATION

ANHELLENIC Association, composed of two representatives from each of the seventeen
women's social fraternities, aims to foster a spirit of friendship and cooperation among these
fraternities at Pitt, to encourage chapters to take an active interest in all college activities for
the common good, and to regulate all matters of local interest to the women's fraternities on
the campus. Panhellenic has devised second semester rushing for the encouragement of scholar-
ship. The cup which is offered each year by Panhellenic for the highest scholastic rating was
last year awarded to Zeta Tau Alpha.

Freshman women were introduced to Panhellenic through an assembly which was held at
the beginning of the first semester at which time '0 (Films, a guide to fraternities, made its
initial appearance. This booklet which concerns rushing, scholastic requirements, bidding,
and expenses proved very valuable to freshmen. An open forum for discussion of questions of
particular interest to Freshmen was held immediately preceding rushing.

A series of Salamegundi Parties were held in November. Panhellenic Banquet came on
March eleventh, after the annual conference. Panhellenic Ball was held April 22 in the Schenley
ballroom, which was decorated significantly.

burgh, February 21, 1920.

Besides doing Child Welfare work, supporting
a war orphan, and keeping up with the Abigail
Davis fund, our national sorority is at present doing
its best to raise a $75,000 Endowment Fund. Each
chapter is also working hard to win the silver tea
service which is awarded to the chapter having

N November 29, 1920, twelve girls organized

as Theta Gamma Phi to promote school
spirit, social activity, scholarship. This organiza-
tion was soon received into Panhellenic. For two
years Theta Gamma Phi stood ﬁrst in scholarship.
In 1923, Violet Osborne Kearney, a national
officer of Beta Phi Alpha, visited Pitt, and the
following year, Eta Chapter of Beta Phi Alpha
was installed at the University. One of the chap-
ter traditions is Parent Night, at which the
actives entertain the parents with an original play.

HI BETA CHAPTER OF CHI OMEGA, for-

merly Alpha Gamma Omicron, local, was in-

stalled at the University of Pittsburgh by Mary G.
Love Collins on December 6, 1919.

Phi Beta is keenly interested in the National
Service Fund, the income from which is to be used
for special studies and research by experts in social
educational, civic, economic, or scientiﬁc fields.
This is the first attempt on the part of any women's
organization to establish funds for research in this
branch of study and the first time in the history of
the Greek Letter movement since the founding of
Phi Beta Kappa in 1776, that a Greek Letter society
has undertaken a national program for contribu-
tion to thought and knowledge.

N the fall of 1915 members of the national
council of Delta Zeta came to Pitt to establish
a chapter. Dean Fetterman suggested to Mrs.
Campbell the names of girls who might possibly
be interested. So it was in January, 1916, that
Omicron chapter was established at the University
without a long preliminary local history. Among
the first leaders of Delta Zeta was Helen Rush,
still on the campus as assistant to Dean Amos.
The first Girls’ Glee Club was materially aided
by Marion Clark, Dorothy Wigman, Helen Rush,
Mabel Gardiner, Mary Scanlon, Pauline Scanlon
Gardescu, most of whom were then in the music
department that has since been transferred to Tech.

I THETA NU, the first Pitt sorority, was found-

ed in 1908. For several years it existed as a

local, but in December, 1915, it was installed as
Alpha Omega chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta.

Every year the chapter gives a dinner to all
Alpha Omega alumnae in celebration of the chap-
ter’s birthday.

Each year after pledging, an alumna tells the
prospective Thetas about the early days of Pi Theta
Nu and Alpha Omega, chapter customs, and
traditions.

APPA DELTA, national social sorority, was
founded at Virginia State Normal, Farm-
ville, Va. in 1897. Kappa Tau Mu, a local es-
tablished at Pitt for petitioning Kappa Delta and
for doing social service work, became Xi Chapter
of Kappa Delta on March 13, 1920.

The national philanthropic work of Kappa
Delta helps to support the Crippled Children's
Hospital in Farmville, Va. The local chapter, Xi,
endeavors to make at least one family happy at
Christmas by the gift of a basket ﬁlled with toys
and a Christmas dinner.

Kappa Delta’s recognition pin is a small gold
dagger, which each girl receives as a gift from the
chapter on graduation.

ELTA SIGMA DELTA, the oldest national dental fraternity was founded at the Univer-
ity of Michigan in 1882, but not until February 5th, 1903, was Sigma chapter organized
at the University.

The first meeting place of the chapter was in Mendal's Hall on the North Side; then a room
was rented on Lacock Street. Some time later a house was purchased on Oakland Avenue,
which remained Sigma's home until 1921, when the chapter moved into its present house on
Darragh Street.

At the present time there are twenty-two members of the University faculty who are alumni
of Delta Sigma Delta.

WONDER if the Sphinx is never one of us, if she is always dis-

rant, forbidding, an idol before whom we crouch with swaying
censors. When snow piles ankle-deep along the Drive, when crys-
tal sycamores and maples glitter against a winter-blue sky, her
proud features are softened under the cold drifts, and we who climb
the hill forget her. Jeweled slippers patter up the steps of the
Mosque; fragile melodies wing through the halls and sway over
her, but she is stern, silent, apart. February sleet and cold March
rains slant against her bronzes, and students still hurry toward
Alumni, busy with umbrellas and lumpy brief cases. Perhaps she
shivers and dreams fitfully of slow moving caravans on endless
sands and of swaying palms that fringe blue waters where a white
tropic sun lies mirrored. Darting cabs and jangling street cars and
the never-ending bustle of students, she must hate when she longs
for the gong to prayer from some distant minaret. But April comes
and a willow waves feathery branches against the white of Thaw
Hall. We linger along the stairways and dream on the window
sills of State. And in the blue haze of a spring dusk, the Sphinx
smiles. .

XI Ps1 PHI

LPHA UPSILON CHAPTER OF XI PS1 PHI was founded four years ago, and has been
most prosperous since its birth on our campus. It has grown rapidly to a total member-
ship of sixty-seven. An Alumni association has recently been organized and is making rapid
strides in promoting the interests of the chapter. The membership consists of students who
have decided on a dental career and who believe that by organization in a strong professional
fraternity they will get a better and more substantial foundation on which to build a successful
life. Xi Psi Phi is a nationally known professional dental fraternity, whose first chapter was

founded at Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Xi Psi Phi has chapters in most of the leading Dental Colleges of the world.

PHI DELTA CH1

MU CHAPTER

HI DELTA CHI, national professional pharmaceutical and chemical fraternity, was founded
at the University of Michigan, November 2, 1883. At this time it was known as the Phi
Chi Society, but on the night of the second meeting of the organization a motion was made and
lost to change the name to Phi Delta Chi. The society was reorganized into a Greek letter
fraternity in 1887, at which time symbols, signs, ritual, and regalia were adopted. The motion
to change the name was reconsidered in March, 1909, and the name Phi Delta Chi was accepted.
Dr. H. Beal was largely instrumental in inaugurating Mu chapter, which was installed

at the University of Pittsburgh in 1907.

ALPHA KAPPA PSI
DELTA CHAPTER

LPHA KAPPA PSI, founded at New York University in the year 1904, for the purpose
of fostering scientiﬁc research in the ﬁelds of commerce, accounts, and ﬁnance, and of edu-
eating the public to appreciate higher ideals in these ﬁelds, is comprised of some forty-seven
chapters, of which Delta is the fourth oldest, having been installed at the University of
Pittsburgh in October 1912.
Rapid strides have been made in furtherance of the fraternity aim: Delta has established
a trust fund to yield perpetually an income of one hundred dollars to be awarded to the Junior
or Senior of the School of Business Administration attaining the highest scholastic average.
A pledge of one thousand and forty dollars was made to the Cathedral of Learning Fund as an
expression of loyalty to Alma Mater, and a perpetual reminder to future generations of Alpha
Kappa Psi’s active interest in this worthy project.

CHIRON

HIRON, founded in 1922, for the purpose of stimulating and fostering interest and knowl-

edge in medicine, is an organization composed of pre-medical students selected on the basis

of scholarship, character, and participation in college activities. It is the outgrowth of various

pre-medical organizations which have been in existence from time to time since college work was
made a pre-requisite for entrance into Medical School.

At present plans are being formulated for the expansion of the fraternity into a national

organization by its union with similar pre-medical organizations in other colleges and univer-

sities.

PHI BETA P1
ALPHA CHAPTER

HI BETA PI, national medical fraternity, was founded at the University of Pittsburgh Medi-

cal School on March 10, 1891. It was ﬁrst organized as an anti-fraternity society in order

to limit the inﬂuence of fraternities then existing at Pitt. At first the group called itself Pi Beta

Phi, but out of deference to the prior existing sorority of that name they changed to Phi Beta Pi.

After a while, ﬁnding that the society prospered and was inculcating the same fraternal spirit
as its rivals, it dropped its anti-fraternity character.

OMICROM DELTA KAPPA

GAMMA CHAPTER

MICRON DELTA KAPPA is an honorary activities fraternity composed Of men who have

attained prominence in scholarship, athletic, and non-athletic activities. However, the

main function of the fraternity is not only to give recognition to such men, but also to unite

them for the purpose of fostering and furthering extra-curricular activities To this end the

traditional 0. D. K. Activities Smoker is held each year. In addition, a system of interviews of

non-fraternity freshmen by members of O. D. K. has also accomplished good results by placing
men in activities.

The Fraternity was founded in 1914 Qt Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia.
Since that date seventeen additional circles have been installed, the majority of which are
located south of the Mason-Dixon Line. In more than a decided majority of colleges and uni-
versities having 0. D. K. Circles, membership in the Fraternity has been voted by the respective
student bodies to be the highest honor attainable.

At the 1927 Convention held at University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, Professor
Gustav L. Schramm was elected National Vice President of Omicron Delta Kappa.

MORTAR BOARD

HAT the outstanding women students of the University might not be slighted by the
appearance of Omicron Delta Kappa, Alpha Lambda Nu was organized in 1915. In 1923
it became Mortar Board, national honorary women’s fraternity.

To stimulate the interest of women students ‘in activities, Mortar Board publishes every
fall a recognition list of Sophomore and Junior Women. This list is based entirely on activities
and scholarship of the Freshmen and Sophomores. These women are formally presented to the
active and alumnae members of Mortar Board at a recognition party.

The Greek letters on the Mortar Board of their pin, Pi Sigma Alpha, represent the qualities
upon which membership in Mortar Board is based: personality, scholarship, activities.

CWENS
ALPHA CHAPTER

HE girl who wears the gold crown and sceptre of the Cwen has been found willing to work

quietly in the background at small and uncoveted tasks.

The active Cwens of 1927 are carrying out the idea which a group of Sophomores in 1921
conceived when they started a fraternity for women who had distinguished themselves during
their freshman year in scholarship, leadership, and participation in activities. In May, 1925,
delegates from similar honorary locals at Miami University and Missouri University met with
the Pitt representatives sent to Miami, Ohio. From this convention grew the national honorary
sophomore activities fraternity which adopted the Pitt name, and the Pitt pin, and made Pitt
Alpha chapter. The following year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted a national
charter. This year a national convention of Cwens will be held on Pitt campus.

Cwens is the goal for which freshman girls strive, and each year the retiring Cwens with
ﬁtting ceremony doff the hat to certain freshman girls. The little gray hat with its cocky red
quill is worn on all occasions where Cwens act as a group. It is also worn during the first few
weeks of school as a sign to lonely freshmen who want helpful friendliness. .

ALPHA DELTA EPSILON

LPHA Delta Epsilon, honorary military fraternity, was organized at the University in

1920, by a group of students in the coast artillery unit of the Reserve Officers Training

Corps. The purposes of the fraternity are the development of erprit dc corp: and the promotion
of social activities within the R. O. T. C.

The ﬁrst years of the fraternity’s existence were characterized by increased interest in R. O.
T. C. affairs generally, and in the practical work of summer camps at Fort Monroe, Virginia.
The inﬂuence of the fraternity was manifested, particularly, at Fort Monroe, in 1922, when the
Pitt R. O. T. C. contingent won the camp trophy for general excellence.

In 1926 Alpha Delta Epsilon departed from its policy of limiting membership to students
of the coast artillery unit and extended its numbers to include the medical unit. This change
in policy has resulted in renewed interest in the object for which the fraternity was organized
and a fuller realization of its purpose.

QUAX

UAX is an honorary fraternity for women of the University majoring in science. It was
Q founded in 1916 by seven students for the purpose of bringing together women actively
interested in the sciences. Membership is based primarily on scholarship.

Eugenics is the topic of this year's program. Discussion at the regular monthly meetings
has been led by faculty members who are prominent in this ﬁeld, and by members of the organiza-
tion. At the January meeting the Alumnae members entertained all undergraduate women
interested in science at a dinner.

Women are truly pioneers in the scientiﬁc world and it is the aim of Quax to encourage
scholarship and fellowship among them.

I TAU PHI, the local honorary scholastic fraternity, was organized at the University of
Pittsburgh in March, 1925. The idea of forming the organization which includes men and
women honor students from all the schools of the university, originated with the local chapter
of the American Association of University Professors and the Honor Graduates Association of
the University of Pittsburgh. Among this group has arisen a feeling that honor students should
have some recognition on the campus. At a dinner held two years ago the junior and senior
honor students of all the schools organized to form Pi Tau Phi. At a banquet held at the
Faculty Club in May, 1926, forty-one juniors and seniors were initiated. Campus activities as
well as scholastic rank are considered in choosing members. At present, the fraternity is work-
ing on plans for activities which will tend to foster higher scholarship in the Freshman and
Sophomore classes as well as among upper classmen.

THE business of a university is to give its
- students preparation for knowledge; not
merely training in a speciﬁc field, but a power
to co—relate many ideas, an insight into the in-
ﬂuence of things one on another. When the
university has established as its ideal that it
provide a unifying force, a power of determining
mutual dependence, it must train and help for-
ward each student toward that ideal according
to his particular talents. The training for a
profession aims to give a framework for the co-
herent structure of ideas.

PI LAMBDA THETA
DELTA CHAPTER

HE Egyptian Key of Life on a ﬂat panelled tablet bearing the Egyptian Sceptre and the
letters Pi Lambda Theta, is the mark of distinction worn by those students of the School
of Education who have been found to have the high standard of scholastic achievement and
professional promise required by Pi Lambda Theta, honorary educational fraternity for women.
Pi Lambda Theta was organized with a View to establishing in institutions similar to the
University of Pittsburgh “and in the general practice of education, a lofty code of professional
ethics, high standards of honor and professional training, and thorough scholarship"; and to
“promoting such social interests as will further those ends."

In December, 1913, Dean Will Grant Chambers planted the seeds of the organization. In
1914, these seeds sprouted in a local organization known as Kappa Pi. At about the same time
the soil at other universities was nourishing the seeds of similar organizations. The result was
a national fraternity, Pi Lambda Theta, of which Kappa Pi of the University of Pittsburgh be-
came Delta Chapter. At present there are twenty-two college chapters and seven alumna
Chapters.

The Ella Victoria Dobbs Fellowship is awarded annually to the worthiest applicant desiring
to do research work in education.

HE hills of my homeland again are singing as the streams of
winter released tumble down to the sea; and my feet bare on the
door stones are wet with the dew of the pasture where I have driven
my father’s sheep. All day, wooly masses of gray will crouch under
the green trees, cool in the distant tinkle of water. I can scarcely
hear the water; each day the sounds grow fainter, except the Voice
of my son's Wife. In a moment she will scream, “Wash the dishes,
and go ﬁnd the kids!" Always she is screaming about her kids and
her marketing until I forget — Forget — What did I try to re-
member? Yes, there were fete days and the tapping of ﬁddlers toes
on the platform, a swirl of starched petticoats, and Teresa, my
sainted bride, her hair braided under a gold and white headress, her
kerchief stilf, and her eyes round at the beauties of my small farm;
my boys growing up, playing on the kitchen stones, singing love
songs at twilight in the glen where the village maidens wander.
I forget those old songs; they grow dim like my eyes. Just let me
sit in the sunshine and think.

ATHLETIC COUNCIL

THLETIC activities have been directed by Athletic
Council since athletics first assumed importance
on the campus. Council consists of a representative of the
Chancellor, a member of the Board of Trustees, the Grad-
uate Manager of Athletics, a faculty representative from
each school, a student representative from each school, and
alumni representatives equal in number to the faculty mem-
bers. The Chairman of Council for many years has been
Dr. A. F. Judd, a member of the Dental and Pharmacy
faculties, who has guided the activities of Council wisely
and diplomatically.

The Graduate Manager of Athletics reports to Athletic
Council at its monthly meetings, When the details of ath-
letic policy are decided. Stadium Committee has cooperated with Athletic Council in conduct-
ing matter of business.

The Athletic Council makes nominations for coaches, managers and other personnel of the
athletic organization of the University to the Stadium Committee. It also arranges the various
athletic schedules, handles eligibility problems, and stimulates student and alumni interest in
athletics. Incidentally, all funds received from athletics are turned over to the Treasurer of the
University, and all checks and vouchers are made payable directly to the University.

Under the careful direction of Athletic Council, the eligibility rules of the University have
become increasingly strict. The first restriction was the One-Year Migratory Rule, which
barred from competition for one year any man who has competed on a varsity team at another
institution. Then came the One-Year Reisdence Rule which restricts all freshmen from playing,
and which allow the student three years of competition. The latest restriction, which was
put into effect last year, is the Transfer Rule, which bars from competition any student who
has ever competed on a varsity team at another institution. Pitt is one of the few eastern schools
which have imposed such a restriction on itself.

THE STADIUM COMMITTEE

HEN Chancellor John G. Bowman and the Board of
Trustees approved the erection of the Pitt Stadium,
they very wisely appointed a Stadium Committee composed
of signiﬁcant business men of Pittsburgh. Absolute con-
trol in ﬁnancing and erecting the Stadium was vested in the
Committee. Homer D. Williams, president of the Pitts-
burgh Steel Company, chairman; A. Kelly, ]r., president
of the Commonwealth Real Estate Company; A. R. Hamil-
ton, prominent coal operator; C. L. Wooldridge, general superintendent of the Carnegie Land
Company, C. W. Ridinger, president of the Iron City Electric Company; C. D. Wettach, president
of the W. W. Lawrence Company, and Dr. A. F. Judd, for many years chairman of the University
Athletic Council and a member of the Dental and Pharmacy School faculties, make up the
Committee. Williams, Kelly, Hamilton, and Ridinger, are trustees of the University. Grad-
uate Manager K. E. Davis was made Secretary.

This Committee directed the two million dollar bond sale, which was one of the most re-
markable ﬁnancial projects ever launched in the city of Pittsburgh. The bonds were sold almost
overnight; the issue was greatly oversubscribed. While the sale was going on, the Stadium
was being erected. It was completed for the opening of the 1925 season and dedicated at the
Pitt-Carnegie game.

Since that time the Stadium Committee has closely cooperated with Athletic Council. In
spite of heavy obligations to be met, the problems of direction and management have been
skillfully handled. The annual gross receipts last year amounted to about four hundred thou-
sand dollars, an increase of thirty-three and one third percent over any receipts as Forbes Field.

for specialization in particular ﬁelds, the Board arranges a
general program of schools and courses, and then provides
the physical means, intelligent Ofﬁcers, capable faculty,
and adequate equipment, for the carrying out of the pro-
gram with its various ramiﬁcations. The Board is com-
posed Of three classes of ten numbers each, elected in pro-
gression for three year terms. The Governor Of Pennsyl-

PITT SPIRIT
STADIUM BRAND

   
   
  
  
  
 
  

E never worry much whether Pitt spirit
is the thing that created Alumni Hall,
that makes State and Mellon seem intimate as we
hurry under the lamps of the Drive in the late afternoon,
that will cling, a glamorous veil, to the Cathedral so that it
will never be mud-tracked and ordinary. Somehow, we've
always been interested in a rather ordinary type of spirit—the
kind of spirit that we keep over at the stadium and, a dozen times a
season, drag out to air along with our handkerchiefs and blue and
gold crepe paper for the beneﬁt of the Post and Gazette Sport Clubs.

Someday the Cathedral will rise majestically over Oakland, but we
wonder whether it will be quite as soul-stirring as the Stadium crouching
between the hills.

A hurried climb over thousands of brown steps, then we burst into the Stadium.
Cheers and tumbling cheerleaders. The Panther grins at the crowd and plays with his
tail. Along the white lines the players move with only short lapses from action to measure
yardage or to pick up the mud-covered referee. A little fellow in white shakes his arms and
wiggles his shoulders, and then the sign boards read Play by 7 and Yards gained 6. The
six-footers down in the mud see things a little differently. They are blind to the reds and blues
that fairly scream at us, but the muttered numbers that mean nothing to us, give them swift
pictures. Then through the line, down against the earth they thump as the tackles clip
them off. Slowly things come back again—the white lines cease to dance. Up again and down
as they gain ﬁve yards, ten yards. Football must be to them an endless thudding against the
solid earth and periodic visits of the Water boy.

During the half, an old grad with a megaphone yells at us, “Where's your Pep! Get some of
that old school spirit!" He never stops to listen to Pitt Spirit rumbling back and forth through
the Stadium, re-echoing along Fifth Avenue on a drizzly November afternoon during a Tech
parade, or rising high above the crowd in Memorial Hall, higher than the Stadium, higher even
than the Cathedral.

THE 1 9 2 6 VARSITY

AM very glad to have this opportunity to express my
appreciation of the students, coaches, and fellow play-
ers for the part they played in what I believe was a success-
ful football season. In this day, no team, regardless of
caliber can “point" for each succeeding game with con-
templation of winning in terms of victories and defeats.
As I look back on the season it seems to me that it was the
development of material, the willingness and spirit of the
MCMILI-AN players, as well as the overcoming of unusual difficulties,
that made 1926 a successful season.

I want to thank the personally coaches for their untiring efforts. It has not been football
alone that this group of instructors has taught the squad. A spirit of loyalty, conﬁdence in
self, character were some of the things which “]ock" gave us. It is the qualities that football
develops in an individual which makes the game the “American man" sport it is. “Jock" and
his assistants have well prepared us for life.

Although the students were discouraged after the city championship had been lost, they
supported us when it came to the Big Three. I believe that students and team felt the real Pitt
Spirit, as it should be, first in the West Virginia game, then against W. &  and Penn State.
Iam glad that I was a member of the 1926 team. I feel that you of the team, as individuals,
ﬁghting against the greatest odds, heavy schedule, material injuries, newspaper and personal
comment, have marked yourselves as courageous and heroic ﬁgures.

Wishing you the greatest success in the 1927 season,

CAMP HAMILTON

AT the mention of Camp Hamilton to any of those who have done time there brings first a
glamourless memory of monotonous plugging, of sprains and bruises and fatigue; but then
comes the memory of the chill of the cool evenings, the dripping dampness of white tents, the
rushing murmur of Paint Creek, the discordant jangling of the first bell.

At Camp Hamilton acquaintances are formed and friendships sealed. There is an irre-
pressible spirit born of perseverance and self-sacriﬁce which draws and binds the men together.
Inconveniences are undergone willingly, injuries borne patiently, strict training rules adhered
to without protest.

Any manager, ex-manager, or assistant manager, will tell you that the contact with this
group, and the friendships and acquaintances made mean more to him than the attaining of the
managership. Any player will tell you that it is these few weeks at Camp Hamilton that incul-
cate a ﬁghting spirit into the members of the squad, which gives zest to the whole season.

In my three pilgrimages to Windber Wilderness I have never seen a more wonderful spirit
among managers, players, and coaches, than was shown last fall.

THE 1926 FOOTBALL SEASON

HE 1926 football season was a famous “comeback" season, featured by the grit and deter-,
mination for which Panther athletic teams are famous. Coach John B. (“]ock") Suther-
land having lost eight veterans from his almost invincible 1925 outﬁt, tackled one of the hardest
schedules in Pitt history with a squad of green men. The result was that he struck some snags
early in the season before the team was developed, and for a while it looked as though complete
disaster might result. After barely beating Allegheny, tying Georgetown, and losing to
Lafayette, the team found itself against Colgate. Carnegie Tech's unusually strong team won
by a two-touchdown margin, and then the Panthers started their great ﬁnish by beating West-
minster and West Virginia, tying W. 8; J. (a team which was very conﬁdent of victory), and
winning the ﬁnal game of the season from Penn State.

There have been seasons which produced more brilliant teams than that of 1926, but there
has been possibly no season in the 30 years of Panther football history where more critical
situations were faced and overcome. Captain McMillin's team entered the Colgate game with
its back against the wall. Few realized the great strength of Colgate, as shown by subsequent
events. Pitt simply had to win, and she won. Carnegie Tech with a veteran team was very
strong. Her victory over Notre Dame proved this.

THE 1927 FOOTBALL SEASON—C0mfz'7zued

The Westminster game was an inspiring one, the score being one of the largest ever rolled
up by a Panther football team. This seemed to whet the varsity's appetites for West Virginia,
and they vanquished the Mountaineers rather easily. W. 8; J., with "Andy" Kerr, fresh from
Stanford University, at the helm as head coach, and with “Bill" Amos, great fullback, was
picked by the critics as a sure winner. The Washingtonians were well satisﬁed to get a tie.
It was the old story on Thanksgiving Day with Penn State. The Lions started out strong, and
it looked as though they might give trouble, but Welch got going, and it was all off.

The bright star of the season was Captain-elect “Gibby" Welch. He was the leading
ground gainer of the country, and his brilliant runs in the Stadium gave the varsity the necessary
punch. "Tiny" Linn and “Bill" Kern were standbys in the line. Captain Blair McMillin
was a good dependable leader, who showed grit and stick-to-it-iveness in the face of early season
defeats, with attendant criticism

The Freshman team was exceptionally good, winning every game it played, and trimming
Bellefonte Academy, national prep school champions, in the game at Lock Haven. Other teams
defeated were Kiski prep, Carnegie, State, W. 8: J., and West Virginia Freshmen.

ALLEc.HENY——GEoRGETowN

PITT opened the season against Allegheny with a team that fell far short of expectations.
They were lucky to scrape through with the bare 9-7 Victory over a Weak opponent.

Allegheny showed unexpected grit in the contest. All through the game, they pushed
Sutherland's team to the limit. Coached by Mel Merritt, former assistant at Dartmouth, the
visitors offered a much more perfected attack than the Panthers. And the defense clamped
down on the Pitt backs with decisive ﬁnality.

However, Pitt staged a remarkable comeback in the second game of the season, holding
what later proved to be a great Georgetown team to a 6-6 deadlock. Over 18,000 people watched
a vastly improved Panther machine hold its own against the highly rated Georgetown eleven.
With Gibby Welch back in the line-up, fully recovered from his training-camp injuries, the
Panthers pushed down the field and Booth crashed through for a touchdown in the third quarter.

The visitors opened the scoring in the ﬁrst period, when Jerry Thompson, ﬂeet back, raced
over the goal line for a touchdown. A forty yard get—away, with Bucky O'Neil, former local
boy, carrying the ball around Pitt's right end, made the score possible. Babe Connaughton,
rated as one of the outstanding linemen of the season, played a Whale of a game against Pitt.
If it had not been for the gigantic 265 pound Georgetown guard, who killed many Pitt plays, the
Panthers might have been on the large end of the score.

LAFAYETTE—'COLGATE

N spite of the marked improvement the Pitt team showed against Georgetown, the Lafayette

Leopards, under Herb McCracken, defeated the Panthers by a score of 17-7. For three

quarters, Pitt held its own. After the Leopards had scored on a forward pass, Gibby Welch
got away for Pitt's solitary touchdown. Booth's placement tied the score 7-7.

After Pitt's touchdown, the two teams played on without scoring. Finally, in the last
quarter, Lafayette began to weave through the Pitt defense. Cothran scored a placement,
giving the visitors a slight margin. Then a fumble by Booth ended the Panther hopes. Guest
went over for the second touchdown and Cothran made the extra point.

Stung by the Lafayette defeat, the Panther eleven came back with a 19-16 triumph over
Colgate. This victory over the team that had tied Dartmouth for the 1925 intercollegiate
honors of the East was one of the outstanding upsets of the season.

A brilliant ﬁrst period assault swept the Panthers over the goal line twice, to cinch one of
the greatest Pitt conquests in recent years. Fisher, shifted at training camp from the line to
the backﬁeld, featured in the attack when he caught a pass from Welch and raced 25 yards for
the second touchdown of the quarter. Booth had crashed over the line a few minutes earlier
for the first score. Colgate rallied dangerously and scored in the last quarter, but Pitt had too
great a margin for the former joint Eastern titleholders to overcome.

LINN

CARNEGIE TECH

ULL Yoder, All-American tackle, and Daredevil Donohoe, ﬂashy back, led the team that

walloped Notre Dame, to a 14-0 victory over the bewildered Pitt outﬁt. A throng of

50,000 thrilled to see Donohoe score twice on spectacular runs. The Tartan rooters went wild
as their team regained the city championship with its third victory over Pitt in twenty years.

Soon after the game got under way, Harpster passed to Donohoe, who ran 55 yards behind
ﬁne interference for the ﬁrst score. The Tech stands rose with a roar; the Pitt backers slumped
in surprised silence. Letzelter kicked the extra point.

Carnegie's other touchdown came in the second quarter. Rooney let a lateral pass from
Welch slip out of his hands and Mefort snatched it up. He was stopped on the Pitt eighteen-
yard line. Tech tried several line plunges and a forward pass for a total of nine yards. On the
last down, Donohoe skirted left end for the ﬁnal score with one of the most brilliant scoring
plays witnessed at the stadium during the 1926 season. Letzelter again added the extra point.

In the second half, Pitt launched a desperate attack, uncorking all "Jock" Sutherland's
tricks, but the Skibo line held consistently in the pinches.

During the game, the Panthers led in ﬁrst downs, ﬁfteen to ﬁve; in ground gained, 170 yards
to 156; and in ground gained by passes, 109 yards to 65. But the Scotchmen played a faster,
more wide—awake game. When Pitt threatened, their defense became invincible. Donohoe's
ability to break way when necessary gave them the victory. Mefort deserves credit for his
lightning recovery of Rooney's fumble. Welch was the only outstanding Pitt star.

WEsTMINsTER—WEsT VIRGINIA

TILL smarting under the lacing handed them by Carnegie on the previous Saturday, the Pitt

backfield ran wild against Westminster and piled up a score that nearly equalled the highest

ever made by a Panther eleven. While Sutherland scouted Wash-Jeff in Philadelphia, “Chalky"
Williamson guided the home team through the most decisive victory of the season.

Westminster, under Coach Dike Beede, could do nothing against her heavier opponent.
Welch, Fisher, Booth, and Rooney led the attack that piled up an 88-0 score. Welch made
four touchdowns from long distances.

After Westminster came the Mountaineers. The famous West Virginia shift, begun under
“Tubby" Spears and now carried on by Ira Rodgers, proved ineffective against the Panther
machine. Sutherland's eleven duplicated last year's score over the Mountaineers, 17-7.

Before an assemblage of 40,000 people, West Virginia drove vainly against the Pitt line.
With Ed Morrison out of the lineup, the visitors had little to offer. For their ﬂashy open style
of former years, they substituted straight football in their attack. The Panthers, unequalled
in this type of play, kept the Mountaineers on the run most of the time.

Booth, Welch, and Rooney featured in the Pitt triumph. Early in the game, Booth plunged
the ball well into West Virginia territory and Welch carried it over for the first touchdown. A
little later, Welch recovered a fumble and ran 20 yards for the second score. Late in the game,
Rooney kicked a placement to complete Pitt's decisive score.

T is important that we be able to earn a living. Sometimes, if we have any doubt: about this,
an empty stomach makes it clear to us. To earn a living usually means that we have some
deﬁnite skill. If mere skill satisﬁes us, then a college education is of little use. If, however,
we desire skill plus knowledge, and character, and the ability to see our particular work in
relation to the work of others, that is another matter. A college, then, can help. The chemist,
for example, who has no knowledge of economics, of biology, and of history may have skill
enough to earn a living, but he will not have capacity for leadership nor merit professional
recognition as a chemist.

Students, faculty, all of us need to get the point of view of one another. As we succeed
in this, miracles happen: our lives are tuned to a happier rhythm; our supply of tolerance and
of kindness increases; and our compensation is no longer measured in money.

That all knowledge be organized, be uniﬁed, in the mind of the individual is, I think, a
primary mark of education. Such unity is the material of culture.

SALATA

WASH r JEFF

NDY Kerr's district champions and “Wild Bill" Amos, one of the greatest full-backs of

the 1926 season, failed to overawe the underrated Panthers, who held them to a scoreless

tie in a hard-fought contest. Amos never got started and the other President backs proved in-

effective against the Pitt line. Cleve Cook, a former local boy, was the only visitor to gain
noticeably against the home team.

Throughout the game, Pitt more than equalled what was considered one of the best Wash-
jeff combinations in recent years. Three times the Panthers threatened to score. Once early
in the game, they pushed down under the very goal posts of their opponents; but the President
line held. Twice in the later periods, Pitt threatened to score; but for the most part the two
teams see—sawed monotonously near the center of the ﬁeld. Booth’s ripping line plunges and
Rooney’s excellent kicking stood out in the Panther attack. Booth gained consistently and
reeled oﬂ" more yards than any other player of the afternoon. Rooney, the former Allegheny
High star, once more demonstrated his ability as a kicker. In the third quarter, Pitt pushed
the ball down the center of the ﬁeld to within 23 yards of the President goal. Rooney was
sent in to kick; but Welch, probably sensing an opening, tried to circle right end. He was
thrown far to the right of the ﬁeld without gain. From this position, Rooney tried an almost
impossible placement kick. The Northside lad made a wonderful try, but the ball was too far
out of angle and missed by a few inches. With his failure, Pitt lost one of the afternoon's best
opportunities to score.

WELSH

PENN STATE

OR three periods, Penn State played the Panthers to a standstill, before Gibby Welch turned
the game into a track meet and ran off a 24 to 6 victory. Welch, fully recovered from the
injuries which had handicapped him earlier in the year, rose to the greatest heights of his season
and brought out the best in “Jock” Sutherland's Panthers when he broke loose in the ﬁnal
quarter. Time and again, he swept around the State ends and down the sidelines to slip un-
touched through the bewildered secondary defense. To Jimmy Rooney also goes a good bit
of the credit for the decisive last period triumph that came only after an underrated State team
had pushed Pitt to the limit for three-fourths of the combat.

It was a battle of individuals in both halves. In the first two periods, Johnny Roepke,
triple threat man of the Lion squad, put Bezdek's combination in the front, only to see his great
work overshadowed by the miraculous performances of “Galloping Gibby." State's ﬁrst dis-
appointment came with their initial play of the afternoon. Delp took a short pass from Pincura,
pushed through a mob of Panther tacklers, and ran a spectacular 35 yards for a touchdown.
But the referee declared the ball grounded and called it back. Again the Lions came back under
Roepke and took the lead in a close contest. But before the end of the ﬁrst half, Welch got under
way; and at the end of the second period, Pitt was leading by a score of 7 to 6. However, it was
not until the ﬁnal quarter that “Gibby", galloping away with his peculiar running crouch,
yanked a crowd of 55,000 to their feet and set the stadium vibrating with cheers of victory.

FROSH FOOTBALL

HE undefeated Pitt Frosh closed a highly successful season by walloping Bellefonte Acad-

emy, national prep-school champions, 20-0. Dr. H. Clifford Carlson coached his players

through ﬁve victories, aiming always toward the ﬁnal game with the highly rated Bellefonte
eleven.

Only in the ﬁrst game, with Kiski, were the Panther cubs scored against. A late start,
with no freshman training at Camp Hamilton, handicapped Coach Carlson. He had weeded
out the team, however, and put it in smooth running order by the opening of the season. The
Frosh entered the Kiski game an unknown quantity, and came out with a 19-7 victory. Kiski’s
lone score resulted from a Pitt fumble. The Frosh kept up an effective attack led by Parkinson
and Edwards, possible stars of the future.

The following week, the Frosh won their ﬁrst home game from the Carnegie Plebes, 10-0.
The Tartan yearlings held the cubs for the ﬁrst half. But in the third quarter, a steady march
down the ﬁeld placed the ball in position for a ﬁeld goal. After a conference, Quarterback Giel
kicked a perfect ﬁeld goal for three points. In the ﬁnal period, the cubs scored again, when
Parkinson ended a steady attack by plunging over for a touchdown. Giel added the ﬁnal point
for a 10-0 victory.

The State game opened with the cub chances in doubt. But the Panther eleven soon showed
its superiority over the Lion yearlings. Pitt's two touchdowns came in the ﬁrst half. Early
in the game, Parkinson and Edwards pushed the ball down the ﬁeld for the ﬁrst score. In the
second period, Edwards threw a long pass to Donchess for the ﬁnal touchdown. Penalties in
the second half kept the cubs from increasing their 13-0 margin.

The West Virginia freshmen went down in the stadium, 13-0. Parkinson ended an early
drive down the field with a touchdown. Soon after, West Virginia uncorked the most spec-
tacular play of the game. From a fake punt formation, LaRue, speedy Snake pup, broke away
for 55 yards. Edwards brought him down on the Pitt two yard line with a brilliant tackle from
the rear. The Panther line held for downs. In the third quarter, Pitt scored its second touch-
down. Uansa went around left end and was stopped only on West Virginia's two yard line.
He plunged over for a touchdown on the following play.

Tb: I928 Owl

Carlson gave his second string men a chance in the Wash-
Jeff game at Greensburg, Armistice Day. But he was
forced to send in his ﬁrst team to stop the ﬁghting mad
President Plebes. The Panther cubs played an excellent
defensive game. Once they held their opponents on the
one yard line for downs. On the ﬁnal down of this series,
the Pitt line threw the threatening back for a yard loss.
But the Panthers, keeping their plays hidden for the ﬁnal
contest with Bellefonte, failed to show their best offensive
form. Edward's trained toe kicked for three points from
a difficult angle. The other two points came after a many-
fumbled play. Following much argument, Pitt was award-
ed a safety rather than a touchdown. Although the 5-0
score was the lowest of the season, the Panthers were
satisﬁed with their victory over a team that included
several second year freshman players.

The following week Coach Carlson devoted to perfecting a deceptive shift formation with
which to baffle Bellefonte, national prep school champs. Few dared hope for a Pitt victory
over the crack prep—school eleven, which had three undefeated seasons to its credit. Belle-
fonte's brilliant showing at Erie and its 67-7 victory over the West Virginia frosh gave the
academy all odds over the Panther cubs. In Captain Hood, they boasted a player who over-
shadows the great Bill Amos in passing ability. All the critics expected Bellefonte to break
the frosh winning streak, as it had in the two previous seasons.

The frosh opened the game at Lock Haven with a baffling attack. The shift, with Edwards
carrying the ball, swept Bellefonte back under their own goal posts. A double pass sent Charley
unmolested across the line. In the second quarter, the same play off the other side of the line
put Garbark across for Pitt's second touchdown. In the same period, Cohen knocked the ball
out of Hood's hand, recovered it, and ran half the length of the ﬁeld for the ﬁnal score.

In the second half, Captain Hood's sixty yard heaves proved ineffective. Only a few short
passes were completed. Donchess intercepted several throws to disconcert the prep eleven
further.

With the fame following the Bellefonte game, K. E. Davis received numerous requests for
post season contests. But our Athletic Council decided against them.

Parkinson, Edwards, and Giel in the backﬁeld; Donchess at end; Montgomery, Klinger,
Corson, Starbird, Griffith, Mahoney, Olson, and Shaw on the line, and numerous others of the
freshman squad will furnish excellent material for next year's varsity.

ALTHOUGH losing the tri-state conference championship to Allegheny College through
early season defeats, the 1927 basket ball team scaled the dizziest heights ever reached by
a Pitt team or by any other local team by decisive victories over Michigan University, Penn
State College, and Syracuse University. In addition to these outstanding victories, Coach
Carlson’s Panthers won the “Big Four” title, took two out of three from Carnegie and won both
contests from Wash-Jeff.

With Captain Elmer Lissfelt out of school the ﬁrst semester and Reed and Wrobleski on the
injured list, the Panthers lost four out of their first ﬁve games, the only victory, coming as a
surprise over Syracuse University in an over-time tilt. Losses to Allegheny, Carnegie and West
Virginia kept Pitt from retaining the tri-state title.

The return of Captain Lissfelt coupled with the conﬁdence obtained
through a one point victory over the Presidents at Wash-Jeff, led the Pan-
thers to victories which placed them among the leading quintets of the
country. A ten point victory over Carnegie evened the city series. A
surprise loss to Grove City College was followed the next night by a
greater surprise, the defeat of Michigan, champions of the Western Con-
ference. Led by Reed, who played the greatest game of his career, the
Pittites stopped Osterban, one of the conference leading scorers, and took
a well-deserved 35-23 victory.

After a thrilling victory over the Presidents on the stadium court, the
Panthers travelled to East Lansing, Mich., and South Bend, Ind. The
first night, they defeated Michigan State, 36-34, in a game which Spartan
officials termed "one of the greatest ever played on the Michigan State
pavillion.” The next night, however, the undefeated Notre Dame bas-
keteers continued their winning pace by a decisive victory over the Pan-
thers. It was the twenty—seventh straight win for the Irish.

Led by Captain Mike Hamas, the Penn State Lions came to the stad-
ium with the best team in Nittany’s history. With a close victory over
Princeton and a decisive victory over Duquesne University, the Lions REED

T17: 1928 Owl

were favored. The 1927 Pitt surprise team again proved its ability to
upset predictions by winning 33-27. The Panthers were the first team
in the district to defeat the Lions.

In the third game of the series Pitt defeated Carnegie Tech, 41-39, in
one of the most brilliant ﬁnishes staged on the Stadium court. Reed's
goal, with only seconds remaining till the ﬁnal pistol, decided the con-
test. The following week Doc Carlson's cagers avenged their early de-

feat to the Methodists by making another one-point decision at Meade-
ville.

The Panther cage season ended with a close game at State College,
the Lions winning 35-34 in a return contest. The loss marked the fifth
one-point game which the Panthers had played. They also won two
games by two—point margins.

Reed proved the individual star of the Panther quintet and was ranked
as the outstanding player in the tri-state district. His work against
Michigan and Penn State was regarded as the finest individual perform-
ance witnessed in this section. Although out of three contests on account

of an injured ankle, "Sykes" tied Kowallis for the highest number of
field goals.

 

WROBLESKI

Kowallis and Wrobleski also came in for a lot of praise for their
aggressive play throughout the year. The two diminutive forwards were a constant scoring
menace to opposing teams. George’s long range shots thrilled the spectators time after time,
while "Stachs" perpetual motion aroused repeated yells from the fans.

Doc Carlson developed a strong pivot man in Rihanek. Most of the time he played against
taller opponents, but Bill held his own both at the tip-off and in caging baskets. Captain
Lissfelt’s return provided both the necessary Weight and the indispensable conﬁdence for carrying
the season to a successful close.

While Lissfelt and Reed were missing from the line-up, Hoban and Fisher, football stars,
ﬁlled the vacant positions ably. Hoban's play against Syracuse caused pleasing reports from
eastern sports critics. Fisher, although still an unﬁnished basket ball performer, was a hard
guard to pass. McGill, Wunderlich, Richman and McMahon also saw
action in Blue and Gold uniforms.

Captain Lissfelt, Rihanek, Kowallis and Richman aret he only
players to graduate from the 1927 squad.

FRosH BASKETBALL

EN years ago Lou McMasters played basketball at Pitt. This year he coached the fresh-

man basketball team through the best season in the history of freshmen athletics.

The undefeated 1927 freshman basketball team, tutored by Dr. McMasters, stands out as the
best in Pitt’s history by reason of the fact that twelve victories were registered in as many con-
tests. During this spectacular season the Pitt yearlings amassed 605 points to their opponents
284, averaging over 50 points a game. At the foul line they made 75 shots in 145 tries.

The ﬁnal game of the year at State College was the only close battle given the freshmen.
Kiski, Slippery Rock, Shadyside, McKeesport, West Virginia, Penn State twice, W.-J. twice,
and Carnegie Tech three times, fell prey to the powerful onsluaght of the Panther cubs.

The outstanding events of the season were the triple win over Tech and the double beatings
handed the W.-J. and Penn State freshmen.

The playing of the whole team was exceptionally good the whole year and to praise anyone
at the expense of the rest would be unfair. Charles Hyatt led the individual scoring and feat-
ured with his miraculous shooting. His partner, Zehfuss, played consistent basketball and
displayed some of the best ﬂoor work seen here. His foul shooting was a big help to the team
in quite a few games.

Cohen ranks as a great center because of his speed, precise-shooting, and his ability to get
the tip-off on all his opponents. The guarding of David Moritz and Ashbaugh deserves special
mention, for it was a feature of every game. In addition, both men ﬁgured heavily in the scoring
in nearly every game. The substitutes were strong and could always be relied upon. Com-
pleting the squad were Arthurs, Sulzner, Mango, Regestein, Laifer, Edwards, Bishop and Snyder.

The team was managed by "Doc" Lynch and Harry Feinstein.

THE 1927 SWIMMING SEASON

HE Panther swimming team was strong during the 1927 season despite the fact that it lost

three of its four meets.

The team opened with Navy at Annapolis, the middies winning 40-22. The next meet was
with Notre Dame in the Pittsburgh Athletic Club pool, and here again the Pitt natators were
defeated. The Greenmen won 43-19. The first victory came the next week at West Point,
where the Pitt swimmers won from the Cadets, 36 to 26. The final meet, which was held the
following evening with Lafayette, found the Panther mermen on the small end of a 31 to 28 score.

At no time during the season did Coach Pat Corr have the entire team's strength in working
order. Seely, one of the best swimmers on the team, developed pneumonia before the first big
meet, and Bowen was out of the Notre Dame meet. The loss of these men in the two big
meets of the season was really responsible for the defeat of the Panther natators.

Captain Wright, R. F. Bowen, and Mango, last year Freshmen, were consistent winners for
the Pitt swim team. Wright, who is the best sprint swimmer on the team, proved also to be its
best diver. Bowen, starred in the breast stroke, Mango in the back-stroke. Bowen broke the
tank records at West Point and Lafayette in the 200-yard breast-stroke, doing the distance in
2:44 at the former, and in 2:45 at the latter. His performance at West Point was just one and
three-fifths seconds behind the intercollegiate record for the distance. Mango came through
the season with a ﬂawless record, taking first in the back-stroke in all the varsity meets.

Other members of the Pitt swimming team were Lithgow, Robb, Lovner, and London.
Lithgow performed in the 50, 100, and 440-yard free style swims. Robb and :Lovner placed in
several of the meets in the free style swims. The Pitt relay team was made up of Lithgow,
Bowen, Mango, and Wright, with London as an alternate.

The freshman team went through the season without the loss of a single meet. It won two
meets from Schenley High, two from Turtle Creek High, and one meet from Kiski, one from
Peabody, and one from Knoxville High. The most conspicuous star was Miller, a very good
breast—stroke swimmer, who should easily make the varsity next season. Lefevre and Dowden
are good free style men; Dowden also performed in the diving events. Harper was the team's
back-stroker.

Underwood and Jackson were consistent performers; each taking several places in the meets.

The frosh relay team was victor in every meet except one. The team scored 260 points
against 152 for its opponents.

Pat Corr was coach of both the varsity and freshmen teams. C. C. Guthrie was the manager
of the varsity swim team.

THE 1926 TRACK AND FIELD SEASON

EXCEPT for the victory over Carnegie Tech, 108-27, Pitt's 1926 varsity track season was un-
successful. The team lost to Navy, 96-35; to West Virginia, 79-56; and to Penn State,
99%-35V; and won from Geneva, 83-43, in an easy meet. The Pitt relay team placed third in
the Penn Relays, but four individual stars who were sent to the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Har-
vard failed to annex a point in that classic. The outstanding men on the team were Welch,
Linn, Kerr, Moore, and Schmidt. During the season. Welch scored a total of 71 points; Linn,
43; Kerr and Moore, each 33.

The season opened in the Pitt Stadium with the Geneva meet on Saturday, April 17, in-
augurating the new quarter-mile track. Fabiani won the high hurdles, with Herrington third.
Welch took ﬁrst places in the discus, javelin, and broad jump, and a third in the shot put, which
was won by Captain Tiny Linn. Kerr placed first in the mile and two mile runs; and Moore
captured the quarter mile dash. Hank Schmidt won the pole vault and was second in the halﬂ
mile run, which Lockley of Geneva won in fine style. Second places were won for Pitt by Fyock
in the low hurdles; by Long in the hundred; by James in the quarter; by Marquis in the two-mile;
by Chalfant in the javelin; and by Arens in the broad jump. Kutchka was third in the discus,
Magee third in the pole vault, Gorski third in the mile, and Norris third in the low hurdles.

The Penn Relays were held April 24 at Franklin Field, Philadelphia. Linn and Welch were
sent to compete in the special weight events of the carnival, but both failed to place. Rutter,
Wick, James, and Moore, with Fetterman as alternate, made up the mile relay team. It placed
third to Occidental College of Los Angeles and to Massachusetts Tech. Occidental won the
race in 323% minutes.

On May ﬁrst, the Panther cinderpath men met Annapolis. Herrington, Linn, and Kerr
took the only first places. Welch could not make the trip because of illness. Herrington placed
first in the high hurdles and second in the lows. Kerr won the mile in 10:02.9, and the two mile
in 4235.5. Third places were taken by James in the quarter mile, Linn in the discus, Kutchka in
the shot, Grindle in the broad jump, Magee in the pole vault, and Long in the 220. Archibald
and Linn placed second in the discus and the hammer.

Page 296 The 1928 Owl

The Schenley Park Scotchmen came to the Stadium
on Tuesday, May 11, and the Panther took them in one
gulp, 108 to 27. Gibby Welch began by breaking Jock
Sutherland’s long standing record in the discus throw,
by more than three feet. His throw placed‘ the mark
at 141 feet 8% inches. The opening event of the meet
was a thriller, Long, of Pitt and Cristoff of Carnegie,
tying for first in the hundred yard dash. First places
went to Fabiani in the high hurdles, to Kerr in the mile,
to Marquis in the two mile, to Moore in the quarter-
mile and two-twenty, to Herrington in the low hurdles,
to Schmidt in the 880, to Fyock in the high jump, to
Linn in the hammer, and to Gibby Welch in the shot
put, discus, javelin, and broad jump. Welch, almost
outscored the entire Tech team with his four ﬁrsts..
Pitt second places went to Fyock in the high hurdles,
to Gorski in the mile, to Adams in the two mile, to Linn
in the shot put, to Peters in the high jump, to Magee in
the pole vault, and to Archibald in the discus and
hammer.

On May 15, Pitt fell before the West Virginia Mountaineers, losing by a margin of 23 points.
Welch won in the shot put and discus, while Moore and Linn took the quarter and hammer,
respectively, for the only firsts that the Panthers were able to annex. Most of the Blue and
Gold tally was gained with a large number of second and third places. Second places were
registered by Kerr, Welch, Fabiani, Marquis, Talbot, Archibald, Moore, and Peters. Third
places Went to Linn, Gorski, Grindle, Crawford, Herrington, Kerr, Schmidt, Welch, Wick, and
Fyock.

The Pitt Intercollegiates, held Saturday, May 22, were won by West Virginia with 57
points; Pitt second, 32% points; Geneva third, 24 points. Gibby Welch was the star of the
Intercollegiates, placing ﬁrst in the javelin, and second in the shot and discus. Captain Linn
won a first in the hammer throw and a third in the shot put. Moore placed ﬁrst in a fast quarter
mile, while George Kerr, Pitt's best distance man, could do no better than a second in the two
mile. Bob Marquis, coming distance runner, was third to Kerr in the two mile run, and Grindle
and Talbot were third in the javelin and broad jump.

Four of Pitt's best athletes were sent to Harvard to take part in the Intercollegiates. Those
making the trip were Captain Tiny Linn, Wei ht man; Gibby Welch, weight man; George
Kerr, who ranks next to Ted Corbett as one o the best distance men Pitt has ever had; and
Jimmy Moore, colored sprinter. These men failed to place, but Welch and Linn were far from
being outclassed, and hope is held for the next time they are sent to the big show.

The Penn State meet in the Pitt Stadium on Saturday,
June 5, was a landslide that buried the Pitt team by a
lead of almost a hundred points. The Center County
lads placed in one, two, three order in the hundred, two-
twenty, quarter, 880, mile, and two mile runs. In the
seven ﬁeld events, Pitt fared much better, winning the
shot-put, javelin, discus, and pole vault, and placing in
the other three. Gibby Welch was again the star of the
team, winning ten points, to tie with Moore and
Filkins of State for high honors. Gibby won the discus
throw, was second to Captain Linn in the shot, and
ﬁnished third in the javelin and broad jump. Pitt took
all three places in the shot put, when Captain Linn
placed first, Welch second, and Archibald third. In the
javelin, Grindle was first.  B. Magee, Pitt, won the
pole vault at eleven feet.

The manager of the team was Johnny Cost, Bus. Ad.
’26. Frank Shea, who was Pitt's greatest runner and
a member of the 1920 Olympic team, was coach. At the
close of the season, Captain Howard Linn, Engineering
'27, was re-elected.

SAMUEL BLACK MCCORMICK, D. D.

Clmneeller Emeritus

THE Chancellor Emeritus holds, perhaps, the most enviable position in
the University. His chief occupation is to watch the wheels go
round—usually from Florida in the winter time, but the rest of the year
from his oﬂice in State Hall where he feels that he is again a part of the
living, throbbing, ever-expanding University and that it is his very own.

The other chief duty of the Chancellor Emeritus is to stand behind the
Chancellor and cheer him on. Better than all others, he knows the in-
cessant toil, the anxious thought, and the watchful solicitude involved
in the very office of Chancellor; and it is his particular privilege to aFford
all the encouragement and inspiration he can. For, after all, only as
Chancellor Bowman brings his noble plans into realization, does the work
of his predecessors have any permanent value. In lending a hand, there-
fore, and in seeing the University move forward, the Chancellor Emeritus
fills a satisfying and useful oﬂice.

SAMUEL BLACK LINHART, A. M., D. D.

Seeretezty of the University

THE Secretary's office is a clearing house for questions and information
pertaining to every phase of University work.

As Secretary of the Board of Trustees and its committees, Dr. Linhart
is responsible for seeing that the actions of the Board and its committees
are carried out, and must keep an accurate record of all meetings of the
Board and committees.

As Acting Treasurer of the University he is responsible for seeing that
its ﬁnancial obligations are met, and its revenues collected. He represents
the University in its relations with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
concerning the biennial state appropriation. Financial transactions, real
estate matters and legal questions make up a large part of his work.

Many activities of the Secretary’s office are concerned with the faculty
and students of the University, such as notices of appointments, the pay-
ment of tuition and questions which require reference to, or information
from, the Registrar, Deans, and other departments.

J. STEELE GOW, A. B.
Executive Secretzzry

THE chief duty of Mr. Gow, Executive Secretary of the University, is to
assist the Chancellor in the guidance of the general educational pro-
gram. His position is concerned with creating those conditions which
are most conducive to wise teaching and intelligent learning. He assists
the Chancellor in his pioneer scientiﬁc research in the field of education.
Sanely and modestly, roblems are met and programs devised for the most
efﬁcient furtherance o scientiﬁc administrative methods towards an educa-
tional ideal. Not spectacularly, and with no regard for the bugaboo of
tradition or rule-of-thumb, problems concerning the harmonious develop-
ment into one unit of all schools and all courses are investigated and the
results of these studies communicated to the various Deans in the form of
recommendations and suggestions.

THE 1926 FRosH TRACK SEASON

HE 1926 Pitt Freshman track team was one of the best in the history of the University. The

freshmen won the ﬁrst three dual meets they engaged in and looked like champions until

they met the Penn State freshmen, who defeated them by almost thirty points. The Frosh

won from Kiski, 78-48; from West Virginia, 75%-50V; and from Carnegie Tech plebes, 88-38.

The outstanding men were Pickard, polevaulter, Gwynn, weight man; Wibecan, sprinter;
Voight, hurdler; Hoffman, miler; and Cobun, half-miler.

The Blue and Gold freshmen opened the season on Saturday, May first, winning easily over
Kiski. Gwynn won the hammer throw, incidentally breaking Jock Sutherland's mark of 152
feet 7% inches, with a heave of 153 feet 6% inches. Victor Pickard, Olympic pole Vaulter,
won ﬁrsts for the Panther in the javelin and the pole vault. Wibecan won two first places for
Pitt by winning the hundred and two—twenty.

In the West Virginia meet, Don Gwynn broke his own hammer throw record of 153 feet
6% inches with a toss of 159 feet 10% inches. Pickard, Wibecan, and Voight each contributed
two first places to the cub score, while Hoffman and Williams each won a first place.

The Tech meet, on May eleventh, was a feast for the cubs just as it was for the Panther
varsity. With the aid of Pickard, Wooley, Gwynn, Voight, Hoffman, Cobun, Wibecan,
Williams, and Sherako, they took the measure of the Tech plebes. Pickard and Wibecan each
won two first places.

The freshmen met their first set-back at Penn State, May 15, where they were defeated by a
score of 80%-54%. However, they revenged the loss by taking eight first places to Penn State's
seven. A large number of second and third places won the meet for the Center County frosh.
Pickard, Wibecan, and Voight, were the high scorers, each with two firsts. Gwynn kept up
his good work by coming through with a ﬁrst in the hammer.

The Intercollegiate meet held annually by Pitt closed the freshman track season on Saturday,
May 22. Only a few events were on the freshmen-prep card, and many of the plebe cinderpath
men were unable to compete. Gwynn was among these. Pickard continued his record breaking
performances in the pole vault, going over the bar at 12 feet 8% inches. This jump broke Bill
Robusch's carnival record of 12 feet in the vault. Wibecan, who remained undefeated as did
Pickard and Gwynn, won the hundred yard dash in easy fashion.

THE 1 9 2 6 CROSS « COUNTRY
SEASON  

ITT cross-country in 1926 was one defeat after an-
other. The team lost every dual meet and placed
twelfth in the I. C. A. A. A. A. Championships, an
annual event at New York City, in which twenty-four
of the leading colleges of the East compete. In 1924,
the Pitt team won the Intercollegiates and last season
placed second. However, only two veterans of a pre-
vious season were on the 1926 team.

The harriers lost the opening meet on October 23
to Carnegie Tech by a 21-34 score. Marquis, however,
carried Pitt’s colors across‘ the line ﬁrst to capture in-
dividual honors. His time was 30 minutes, 6 seconds.
Captain Crawford of Tech was second, followed by
three more Tech men. Captain Gorski of Pitt placed sixth; Adams, eighth; Wick, ninth; and
Grossett, tenth. This was Carnegie's ﬁrst victory over Pitt in cross-country.

Penn State, 1926 I. C. A. A. A. A. Champions, came here, October 30, to win over the
Panther hill—and-dale men by an 18-37 tally. George Offenhauser of Penn State broke the
Panther course record with 28 minutes, 15 seconds. Stewart and Cox, State, were second and
third. Marquis, first of the Blue and Gold runners, ﬁnished fourth in 28 minutes, 36 seconds.
Captain Ted Gorski came seventh; Adams, eighth; Larson, ninth; and Davis, tenth. Offen-
hauser’s time broke Ted Corbett's record of 28 minutes, 18 seconds for the Panther Hollow
course.

Coach Tom Keane’s Syracuse harriers were here on November 6, winning over the Blue
and Gold by another 18-37 score. Captain Jimmy Loucks of Syracuse further lowered the
Schenley course record, running the 5% miles in 27 minutes, 48 seconds. Rupert and Proudlock,
his team-mates, were second and third. Marquis, again leading the Panther harriers, ﬁnished
fourth. Marquis cut down his own best time with a run of 28 minutes, 35 seconds. Captain
Gorski, Adams, Grossett, and Larson ﬁnished in seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth positions.
Campbell and Davis ﬁnished thirteenth and fourteenth. This meet closed the season of dual
engagements, and the Pitt runners began preparations for the annual intercollegiates.

Pitt has only one consolation for its showing at the
I. C. A. A. A. A. Championships in New York, Novem-
ber 22, and that is the fact that Carnegie Tech was also
beaten. Carnegie placed thirteenth, while Pitt placed
twelfth. Penn State was ﬁrst, scoring 65 points; Syra-
cuse scored 68 points; Yale, 95 points; Harvard, 102
points; M. I. T., 145; Pennsylvania, 150; Cornell, 184;
Maine, 184; Princeton, 215; Dartmouth, 267; Columbia,
318; Pittsburgh, 346; Carnegie Tech, 366. William Cox,
State, was ﬁrst in the big race, with Jimmy Loucks,
Syracuse, third. Pitt's men placed as follows: Mar-
quis, forty-first; Adams, ﬁfty-seventh; Gorski, seven-
tieth; Hoffman, eighty-eighth; Larson, ninetieth; Gros-
sett, one-hundredth; and Davis, one-hundredth and
third.

Seigfreid Larson, Herbert Hoffman, James Davis, and A. R. Campbell made up the Pitt team for
these meets. Wick pulled a tendon after the first meet and was unable to take part in any of the
remaining contests. Hoffman was also out after the first meet due to an infected foot, but he
returned in time to make the New York trip.

Rob Roy, a member of the 1925 varsity team, who was ineligible in the intercollegiate
races due to the University’s semester rule, represented Pitt in two A. A. U. championship races.
Roy placed twenty-third in thejunior National Championships at Fairmount Park, Philadelphia,
on Armistice Day, and was twenty-ninth in the Senior National Cross-country championships
at New York City, November 21.

The Pitt freshmen team was the best the University has had in years. The frosh won all
three dual meets, defeating the Carnegie Tech plebes, 20-35; Penn State_frosh, 27-28; and Kiski,
15-40, a perfect score. In the Intercollegiate Championships at New York, the freshmen failed
to come up to expectations, however, placing only ninth. The frosh were expected to place
among the first three. Russell Comfort was the star of the freshman team, winning every race
and placing sixth in the Seventh Annual Intercollegiate freshman run. Bill Wherry, Joe Murray,
Ben Walker, James Jerpe, James Patterson, and Stewart were the other members of the champion
freshman team.

Stanford F. Jones was manager of both cross-country teams, and William Negley acted as
assistant manager.

VARSITY TENNIS

INNING all of their thirteen matches by decisive scores, the 1926 varsity tennis team
smashed its way to the tri-state championship and to one of the leading positions in
national intercollegiate tennis circles. The first string racqueteers astounded the east by drub-
bing West Point, Rutgers, Colgate, and Syracuse on successive afternoons. Rutgers was the only
team to score a point against the Panthers.

Divvy O'Loughlin, Byron Baur, and John O'Loughlin formed the nucleus of Dr. T. W.
Stephens’ championship combination, ﬁlling in the fourth man with either Bourns or Lauler.
Stevens, Clark, and Gordon teamed up in the doubles matches. Coach Stephens alternated the
first three players as the first singles man and only used these stars in doubles competition for
practice before the eastern trip. Clyde Barton managed the team.

Besides their decisive victories in the east, the Panther court stars permitted Carnegie two
points, which Were registered in the doubles after the Pitt first-stringers had assured a victory
in the singles matches. Pitt drubbed Bucknell and Allegheny twice, Dickinson, Westminster,
West Virginia Wesleyan, Carnegie, and the Alumni once, while the second matches carded with
Tech and Westminster and the match with Penn State were called off on account of rain.

With every member of the ﬁrst four some available for two more years, Pitt’s success is
assured on the tennis courts. The 1927 junior varsity stars should again repeat their enviable
record of last year.

RIFLE TEAM

HE Varsity Riﬂers, with four of the six letter men from the preceding successful season as a
nucleus, and with three other regulars and ﬁve men of varsity ability from the freshmen

team to complete the squad, excelled in performance any previous Panther riﬂe team.
During the first semester the Blue and Gold Sharpshooters tallied twelve victories against

three defeats. Although Pitt competed against the best collegiate riﬂe teams in the east, it
totaled ﬁve hundred more points than its opponents. In the last match of the first semester
season, the Panthers tied the University record of nineteen hundred and seventeen points out of
a possible two thousand.

Owing in part to the loss of Ken Diver and Bob Atkinson, outstanding shots of the sopho-
more class, the team was less fortunate in the second semester. After two matches were lost,
one to Navy and one to C. C. N. Y., the team improved remarkably, principally through the
efforts of the coach, Paul Harter.

Prospects for next year are unusually bright; nearly every marksman developed by the
University during the past three years will be eligible for varsity competition.

T19: 1928 Owl

 

PORTS—what a misused word! It has come almost
to mean the participation of the few to the deprivation
of the many. We have emphasized our national, com-
munity, and school heroes in all lines of sport to such an
extent that we have lost sight of the true value of sports.
We admire the man who plays for the joy of playing,
who backs his team in every honest way, always dealing
fairly with his opponents, who learns to correct his faults
through his failures, who is generous, honest, true to his
highest ideals, and who plays hard until the game is over.
It is the qualities of sportsmanship rather than expertness
in some particular branch of sports that are of lasting Value.
Since the University holds as its purpose the devel-
opment of useful citizens and future leaders in this com-
munity the encouragement of sports can do much to further
this ideal. Properly directed sports have a strong in-
ﬂuence on every side of the individual's character. The
man who plays fairly most often lives more cleanly than
the man who does not obey the rules of sport. The sports-
man's view of the world is broadened; he can discover
companionship and solace in vital living things.

GIRLS’ VARSITY BASKETBALL

HE Pitt co—ed basketball team, led by Captain Ruth Stultz, played a successful season. The

Pitt lassies scored 190 points to their opponents 134, and Miss Stultz was responsible for

152 of her team's total score. The sextette traveled around the Pittsburgh district, playing

seven games during the season. In ﬁve of the games played, the Panther girls were victorious.

They won from Seton Hill, Drexel, Temple, Alumnx, and Theil. Slippery Rock defeated the
team in two engagements.

At the close of the season, the twelfth annual co—ed basketball banquet was held in the
Heinz House. Songs, cheers, and speeches by the coach and prominent members of the team
were the order of the evening. Miss Margaret McClenahan, co—ed athletic coach, awarded
Pitt blankets to Captain Ruth Stultz and Dorothy Russel for four years’ service on the varsity.
Venus Shakarian and Dorothy Koch were awarded gold
basketballs for three years’ varsity service. Letters and
sweaters were given to Sara Long, Edna Winters, Frances
Amburson, Gertrude Cromer, and Grace Austen. Numerals
were given to Grace O'Donnell, Mabel DeForest, Mary
Johnson, Elizabeth Davis, and Ruth Thompson, assistant

INTRA 'l\/IURAL SPORTS

HIS year, Pitt co-ed intramural activity attained such importance as to almost supplant

intercollegiate games. Nearly seven hundred girls took part. Seventy-six teams were

organized under the direction of Miss Margaret McClennahan to compete in hockey, volley ball,
and basket ball. W. A. A. manages intra-mural activity.

Playing some games at six o’clock in the morning, the seniors, captained by Venus Shak-
arian, won the hockey interclass championship. The juniors, with Dorothy Koch as captain,
were runner-up, followed by the sophomores and freshmen. Doris Saurman captained the sophs
and Francis Ambursen led the frosh. Miss McClennahan and Miss Sefton refereed the contests,
and Dorothy Koch took charge for W. A. A.

The sophomores won the volley ball league contest, followed by the freshmen, juniors and
seniors. Katherine Hazlett was general chairman and manager of the volley ball league, while
Lillian White, senior, Leah Bluestone, junior, Esther King, sophomore, and Anita Guiliana
managed their respective class teams. Miss Sefton
coached and referred all games.

The first year co-eds were winners in the cage league.
The juniors, sophomores, and seniors followed in order.
Margaret Lawton was general manager of the floor
league. Jeannette McClure managed the senior class
team, Edna Winters had charge of the juniors, Mable
DeForest of the sophomores and Alene Gurney of the
frosh.

For the first time, archery was placed on the co-ed
intramural cards by W. A. A. as a minor sport. Lillian
Kirsch, general manager, arranged an exhibition by
"Robin Hood” Mooney, nationally famous archer_
The enthusiasm displayed by the co-eds at this exhibit
prompted W. A. A. to include archery as a major sport
for next year.

Besides these sports, swimming, baseball, golf,
hiking and tennis events are carried on by the girls.
The swimming schedule, under the management of
Winifred McClure, terminated in an inter class
swimming meet early in the spring. Grace f
O'Donnell is in charge of baseball, Janet Mathison ;
of golf, Helen Cashdollar
of hiking, and Dorothy
Russell of tennis.

AM alone in a strange place. Each day during these seven years

I have played a part in a dream. I have come here each day to
haggle with the vendors of fruit, knowing always that it is not
really I who comes to this place of hazed sunlight and slow move-
ment. I tread insecurely, fascinated by the strangeness of the deep-
set corner. I am afraid lest they speak to me and ask me roughly
“Who are you to be here"?

I am aware of the unreality of my corner. In the early morning
when there are long shadows and clear, sharp noises, my footsteps
ring metallically on the pavement. Only a few of them are moving
about. At noon they are hurrying and gesticulating, their faces
are deeply seared with worries, these little people that I watch so
insecurely. But it is only when the sun again casts long shadows
that there is peace for them. And there is a hush and a warmth
upon them. I shall never reach out my hand to touch them, and
they will never vanish, I shall always be here alone, and the sun-
light will be warm on my face and my eyelids. But through all
this I know that it is not really I who comes to this place of hazed
sunlight and slow movement to play a part in a dream.

TUNIORS

JOHN GILBERT QUICK, B. S.
Registrar

THE University ofﬁcer who makes the first contact with the prospective
student, the one who aids the high school graduate in selecting his
course, who procures and evaluates the entrance credentials, who issues

of registration, who records and issues grades, and who prepares and
transmits to the Chancellor the ﬁnal documents of graduation is the
Registrar.

In addition to these duties, Mr.  G. Quick is constantly engaged in.

his oﬂice a real service department for students and members of the faculty.

Mr. Quick is Secretary of the American Association of Collegiate Reg-
istrars and Secretary of the Advisory Board on Student Activities. His in-
terest in the extra curricula activities of the student is shown by the fact
that he is the Treasurer of the Young Men's Christian Association and a
member of the Point Scale Committee.

J. HOWARD DICE, B. A., B. L. S.
Librarian

MR. Dice, as University Librarian, quiet and unseen, has no slight
inﬂuence on the movement of the University. With the Dean of
each school he makes up the departmental budgets: this appropriation for
history, that for economics. The budget being decided upon, his duty is
to carry out effectively, the suggestions of department heads in regard to
the purchase and circulation of reference books. Although he has no
control over the purchase of books for the graduate and professional school
libraries, he directs their personnel. He is responsible for the availability
and distribution of University Library books, and for inter-library loans.
He selects periodicals for our informative and recreational reading and a
number of non-reference books for our enjoyment. It is his duty to see
that all books and magazines are well bound and in good condition. His
position calls for scholarship and administrative skill.

JOHN WEBER, M. E.

OHN Weber, as business manager of the University is financial supervisor

of the Purchasing De artment, the University Book Store, the Printing

De artment and the Caijeteria. He is also supervisor of the Building

duties as University Supervising Engineer. He has the pleasant though
somewhat arduous task of acting as medium between the Chancellor and
J. T. Klauder Co., architects for the Cathedral of Learning. He also acts
as medium between the architects and Stone and Webster, contractors for
the Cathedral. He is the interpreter of the Chancellor’s ideas and of the
architects plans.

WILLIAM MORRELL, A. B.
Unii/er.rz'ty Editor

HE University Editor finds himself obliged to say yes or no to a multi-
tude of questions regarding University affairs. It is he who must re-
lease all information regarding this great organization, who must edit the
hundreds of bulletins, catalogues, dissertations and abstracts of disserta-
tions; who must direct the writing of any information which goes to the
newspapers of Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania, and by a judicious
handling of the advertising which the University requires, give to the gen-
eral public its ideas about Pitt.
Perhaps the most interesting part of his duties is his work with the
student editors of campus publications, which he carries on in the manner
of a big brother, acting as a medium between students and Administration.

 

WILLIAM MORRELL

CHARLES R. FOSTER, A. B.
Graduate Manager of Student Aetiuitiei

THE Advisory Board of Student Activities budgets a portion of our in-
dividual twelve—ﬁfties into rather sizable appropriations for a large
number of non-athletic activities. Mr. Foster's duty as representative of
the Advisory Board is to transmit the budget to the students and to assist
them in their adherence to the budget. Into his oﬂice flows a steady
stream of organization managers. The Debating Club, Pitt Players, Chess
Club, Pitt Week Committee, Band, Combined Musical Clubs, Pitt Weekly,
Dance and Ring Committees, Cap and Gown, S. S. G. A., W. S. G. A., and
even the Owl, send delegates to haggle with him over expenditures. He
appoints or approves ofﬁcers for all non-athletic organizations, and he
takes them over the coals when they are lax. Such a position should
either keep him very young for a long time or make him grow old in no
time at all.

 

CHARLES R. FOSTER

K. E. DAVIS, C. E.

Graduate Manager of Athletic;

MR. Davis has unusual opportunities for knowing both the under-
graduate and alumni aspects of university life. As Graduate
Manager of Athletics, he has devised a system of student managership in
which the manager is elected after three years of apprenticeship. Mr.
Davis supervises the work of all managers and apprentices, whose duties
range from serving meals at Camp Hamilton to the handling of guarantee
money for the big games. With the Student Managers he makes up each
season's athletic schedule. His policy is to remain in the background and
to allow the students to exercise their own initiative and executive ability.
He is directly responsible to the Stadium Committee, and to the Athletic
Council, of which he has been Secretary for ﬁfteen years.

As Secretary of the Alumni Association, he has charge of all Alumni
records. He edits the Alumni page in the Weekly, which 5,000 Alumni
read, and handles all Alumni funds. His more personal duty is to promote
Alumni activity. He endeavors to keep in contact with our twelve thousnnd
Alumni, who are scattered throughout the known world. Over his desk
is a framed collection of foreign stamps from the letters of those who have
strayed farthest. His office secures for the Alumni everything from
positions to theatre tickets.

The 1928 Owl

THE RADIO STUDIO

HREE years ago, Chancellor Bowman, fore-
seeing the cultural possibilities of radio
broadcasting, received favorably the suggestion of
the Westinghouse company to establish a studio of
KDKA at Pitt as a joint undertaking of the two
institutions. Early radio programs had been planned
for informative value as well as for entertainment,
but no systemetized educational program was pre-
sented by any station in the United States until the
studio in State Hall was opened.

The third anniversary of the opening of the Pitt
studio was celebrated on March 30th, 1927, with a
special program consisting of speeches by Mr. H. P.
Davis, the “Father of Radio Broadcasting”, Vice-
President of the Westinghouse Company, and Mr. A.
E. Braun, a member of the Board of Trustees of the University, and President of the Pitts-
burgh Post and Sun Publishing Company; and songs by the Pitt Four.

Mr. Davis defined the scope for broadcasting by educational institutions: "The future
development of broadcasting lies in the bettering of reception and in the widest dissemination
of cultural information and entertainment, no matter in what guise it is offered. Always the
radio program should be of a higher grade than the generally accepted average, so that it may
serve as an inspiration and education to listeners. In this future the University has a very
deﬁnite responsibility, perhaps the most important of any of the agencies that make up this
exceedingly complex institution of broadcasting."

Programs are arranged in conference with the heads of the various departments at the Uni-
versity and with guest speakers. They are interesting to men of technical professions, to the
miner, to the farmer, to the bank president, to the school boy, or the college professor. Many
letters are received, but perhaps the most gratifying response comes from the bed-fast listeners.
An extremely well—balanced program has been broadcast this year: “The Origin and Develop-
ment of Light Sources, Dynamo, and Steam Engine"; "Philosophers and Their Times"; “Ameri-
can Art"; “Mining, Metallurgy, and Oil Reﬁning"; “The Story of Our Courts"; "Poetry";
“Psychology for Parents"; "Auto Engines: Their Operation and Care"; “Spring: The Natu-
ralist Afield”; “European Sketches". Campus organizations contribute to the entertainment
of the radio audience. Broadcasting is done four nights a week. Two nights are given over to
the series lectures and on each of the other two nights, a complete discourse is given.

Copies of the programs which have been broadcast during the past three years may be found
in most of the libraries of this country; in Natal Technical College, Durban, S. Africa; in the
Soochow Technical College, Soochow, China; in the American Library in Paris; in the Tech-
nological Institute of Leningrad, Russia; and in many other libraries all over the world. A
schedule of talks is distributed at the beginning of each month to a mailing list of four thousand.

Miss Mary Frances Philput, as manager of the studio, is a member of the advisory com-
mittee which controls the studio’s activities. Other members are Deans Sieg, Bishop, Manley
and Friesell, Mr. Shockley, and Mr. Gow.

to his subjective interests.

DEAN OF MEN

HE first contact of a new student at the University is
Dean Harrison confers with
him concerning objective purposes of his university work
and advises that plan of study which he thinks best suited
During the transition period
from the close guardianship of preparatory school to the
more impersonal attitude of the University, the Dean keeps

close watch over the student's adjustment to his new en-

w. DON HARRISON vironment.

Mr. Harrirm, Dean of Men and Uni-
verrity Examiner, received the degreer
A. B and M. A. at the Univerrit] of
Iowa. He tauglzt at Iowa and the
Univerriiﬁy of Akron, and held rtaﬂ
yoritiom on Jeoeral neu/Jpaper: before
coming to Pin‘ in 1922 at an Englirb

If a student encounters diﬂiculties, Dean Harrison con-
sults with him in order to search out causes. Sometimes
a student has decided on a special course of study for which
he is unsuited. In a few minutes conversation Dean Harri-
son diagnoses his case and suggests a plan of study which
will result in a better direction of the student’s peculiar

so is restless at school.

Dean Harrison attempts to set a
Failing in this, he may suggest a

few months away from the campus to give perspective.
If the student has latent ability, but shows a propensity towards laziness, Dean Harrison
plays against his conceit in order to develop in him an energizing ambition. Sometimes the
student is unsuited for study at an urban university; he desires, perhaps, the quiet of ivy-covered

Halls, or he may want the practicalities of the technical school.

Dean Harrison helps the individual student make his adjustments to the Pitt environment,
and tries to provide for the fullest development of his ﬁner potentialities.

ASSISTANT TO DEAN OF MEN

T is the duty ofJohn R. Johnson, assistant to the Dean of
Men, to see that the individual student retains a balance
between his extra-curricular and his scholastic work. The
freshman who has unwittingly submerged himself in
activities so that he is unable to derive full beneﬁt either
from his school work or from the activities, would be
likely to waste four years in learning the cause of his in-
ability to carry on if he were not forced to limit his ven-
tures. The sophomore who worked as apprentice manager
of a sport, reporter for the Weekly, and member of two or
three committees when he was a freshman ﬁnds that his
duties have grown, that he cannot properly handle such
diverse activities and still keep up to the standard in his
school work.
John R. Johnson sees to it that in all cases there is an
equilibrium maintained.

DEAN OF WOMEN

A CREED

I believe in the young women of today;

I believe that their success should be measured in terms
of personality, sanctity of manners, and enrichment of
society through individual human excellence;

I believe that the University should provide rich oppor-
tunity for them to perfect and practice the art of living;

I believe that the interests of administrative oﬂicers,
faculty and students are mutual and inseparable, and that
as they work together, each honoring and respecting the
other, they reveal what true university fellowship may be

I believe that women students should learn the im-
portance of knowing the right people, of seeking out the
ﬁnest instructors—indeed of making every ﬁne social con-
tact possible;

I believe that every college woman should think of
herself as a prospective homemaker and know something
of the responsibility entailed and of the ideals toward
which to work;

I believe that every college woman should know the
comparative values of studies and that she should be given
individual direction in relating her studies to her chosen

I believe that student activities, wisely directed, furnish valuable mediums for the develop-
ment of all those qualities which true leaders must possess;

I believe that through the development of women student leaders the centers of inﬂuence
for the University ideal are multiplied and that this is the surest and truest type of student

Um'1/eriitj of Pittxhurgh

The 1928 Owl

THYRSA W. AMOS

FIRST ASSISTANT TO THE
DEAN OF WOMEN

HE Heinz House is the center of activities for Pitt
women, and Miss Rush is mistress of the Heinz House.
As assistant to the Dean of Women, Miss Rush is the tactful
arbiter for Pan—hellenic, Miss Rush looks over the ﬁnal
proof of Vade Mecum; Miss Rush keeps ﬁles of each girl's ac-
tivities and particular interests, Miss Rush helps many a des-
perate speech-giver to perfect a ﬁve minute talk, Miss Rush
approves chaperones for campus social functions, Miss
Rush answers every question conceivable about woInen’s
activities on the campus, and above all she maintains an
ease of manner which refuses to be rufﬂed by any situation,
no matter how complicated. And Miss Rush's day does
not end at ﬁve o’clock, for we must be calling her at her
home to settle questions about many a mountain which
has sprung suddenly from a mole-hill.

THE GRADUATE SCHOOL

UNIVERSITY can exist without a graduate school.
It is, however, difﬁcult to imagine one existing
without the possession of that attitude toward the ﬁelds of
nature and of the humanities which should characterize
an honest graduate school. After all, then, the graduate
school is merely a convenient administrative unit which
should be created only when a clear-cut view of a full re-
sponsibility for leadership in education and in scholarship
permeates a university staff.

What is this attitude, or this clear-cut view? It is a
conviction that goes a step further than those beliefs
which prevailed in the medieval universities. In those
old days the universities were entrusted with the conserva-
tion of learning—great store houses they were of the lore
of still more ancient days. A time soon came when the
passing on or doling out of this learning became also a
normal function of the university. The signiﬁcant step,
however, was the creation of learning. This came very
gradually, so gradually in fact, that it has not yet found
an abiding place throughout our host of institutions of
learning. This belief, then, in the vital need of creating

learning is the attitude of which I have written and which I have stated must come before any

graduate school can exist.

We believe here in the University of Pittsburgh that we are justified in maintaining our
graduate school. All through our various faculties are many men and women who are un-
willing to admit that our end is merely to pass along to our students what others have created.
What we may do will ever seem of small consequence when it is matched against the product
of all the great minds since the beginning; it will ever loom large to those who rightly measure

the priceless quality of creation.

THE COLLEGE

SING a rather crude ﬁgure, we may liken the College
to the cement that holds together the various stones
of a piece of masonry. These stones, representing the vari-
ous professions that keep going the round of life, lack
strength and purpose unless they are held together by a
common bond. This bond is pure clean-cut thinking about
the ultimate things of nature, of man, of abstract philos-
ophy, and of all else that helps to interpret our varied lives.
All figures, however, are faulty. They tell too much
or too little. Here this one tells too little. The College is
this bond, it is true, and it is something more. It does
unite and interpret, but, more, it provides its own goal. The mastery of a ﬁeld of thought is an
end in itself; call it a vocation or an avocation, if you will. A thorough training in English,
history, or sociology may not necessarily lead to a profession. What of it? It does provide
what is best in any professi0n—a sure knowledge. Returns in terms of money may come, but
surely these are not for a moment to be weighed against returns in satsifaction, and in the oppor-
tunity to add one's bit to the accumulation of the world's store of beauty and of truth. It is
mainly from these people trained in good colleges that we must look for advancement in every
endeavor; it is from these that we may hope to unite all with imperishable bonds.

THE SCHOOL or
BusINEss ADMINISTRATION

HE School of Business Administration is.endeavoring

to train young men and women for business life through
courses in liberal arts subjects, supplemented by courses in
those subjects relating to the organization, functions, and
relations of business. The college graduate entering busi-
ness without some special preparation suffers a severe
handicap. The person who has studied exclusively

 

LOUIS KENNETH MANLEY courses in the ﬁeld of business is scarcely less handicapped.
Dr. Manley,dmnof;12eSc1mlofBmi— The graduate of the School of Business Administration,
"NI Aﬂfmiﬂimdtiaﬂi W! ‘graduated equipped with both academic training and a knowledge
f“’’” 05” W"l‘7"” U”’”.””’J.“"’1’ "” of the fundamental principles of business, is in a position
A. B. dcgret and later rtrm/ed bu Ph. D d . . h b . Id 
Mm P,-,,_ D,_ Manley H W ,,,,,,,a,. to ten er competent service 7111 t e usiness wor . e
oftlle “om1z'mofCmmm; ofLmgutof School centers its specialization upon the fundamentals of

Ndtivm" and “Gm1Citi<mI/Ii?" business rather than upon the particular ﬁelds of business

in which adequate preparation must include experience
within an organization itself.

A probationary period in business is inevitable regard‘
less of special training; but adjustments will be hastened,
false steps will be diminished, and rewards will be less

delayed and more certain for the individual with general academic training and a sound
knowledge of the facts and principles relating to business.

The School includes the Departments of Accounting, Business Law, Commerce, Economics,
Finance, Industry, and Statistics. It conducts a Bureau of Business Research, which concerns
itself primarily with problems of interest to the Pittsburgh district. About one hundred of the
signiﬁcant business men of Pittsburgh cooperate actively with the faculty by supplementing
instruction with practical problems drawn from their experience.

THE SCHOOL or EDUCATION

HE School of Education is a professional school for
teachers, supervisors, and administrators. Just as
other professional schools on the campus are organized to
train physicians, engineers, lawyers, or other professional
workers, so the School of Education has for its purpose the
training of those who are to become teachers and experts in
supervision and administration of education.

Herbert Spencer, in his analysis of education, said that
the most valuable knowledge in the world is exact scientiﬁc
knowledge. Even in art, which might seem farthest re-
moved from science, knowledge of a scientiﬁc character is
essential. The painter must know his colors, his canvass,
and he must have a facile technique. In a like manner,
teaching, often spoken of as an art, must be based upon
scientiﬁc knowledge of the human mind and how it works,
of human experiences and their signiﬁcance, and of those
types of training and experience which the pupil must have
for his proper development. These facts are discovered by
scientiﬁc research. The School of Education is, therefore,
a research center devoted to the discovery of better ways of
educating children and adults.

 

GROVER H. ALDERMAN

Dr. Alderman, dean of the Xehaal of
Edueatian, rereived hi: A. B. frrm Iowa
State Teacher: College, and hi: M. A.
and Ph. D. from Indiana Univerrity.
He wax mperintendent of Jchaalx in
Newton, Iowa, and later, Prafeuar af
Xchaal Sapervixian at Indiana Univer-
Jit]. Dr. Alderman erntrihute: to
“fehaol Review," "Journal of Educa-
tional Rerearch" and “Elementary
School Teacher."

While research stands at the basis of good procedures in teaching as well as in other pro-
fessions, the needs of the world demand that Schools of Education shall train a large number of

teachers and administrators.

The training of the teacher has come to be recognized as a most important problem in
American education. Her training is three-fold: training in subject matter, training in human
nature, and training in method. The School of Education gives the teacher that type of strictly
professional technique which enables her to know how to use her knowledge eﬁectively.

A considerable part of the work of the School of Education consists of graduate training
for men and women who are to become the experts and leaders in their profession.

FREDERICK LENDALL BISHOP

Dr. Bithop, dean of the School of En-
gineering and Miner and Profeuor of
Phyricx, wax graduated from the Marra-
chmett: Inrtitate of Technology with a
B. 5'. degree and received hi: Ph. D.
from the Univerrity of Chicago. He ir
the editor of “Engineering Education"
and the author of Jeveral artiele: on

ENGINEERING AND MINES

HE profession of Engineering is an exacting one; he
who follows it deals with natural laws, the infraction
of which means disaster; his deductions must be based u on
premises which are inconvertable and which can lea to
but one conclusion~the truth. His moral motives must
uplift his mental habits, and in all his relations there must
be no compromise between truth and falsehood, between
good and evil. The professional standard implied by
these qualities is very high but not beyond any man who
is determined to reach it.

Professions owe their distinctive qualities to the type
of men whom they enlist and the traditions with which
they become invested. Men become technically proﬁcient
by being well trained but they exercise leadership largely
through education obtained either in school or in the active
work of life. Since the engineer is the man in contact
with other types in other ﬁelds of human activity, he should
have a broad training in the humanities. He must become
familiar with industry while a student in order that he
may thoroughly understand the application of his theoreti-
cal courses in school and their application to industry, and

become familiar with the problems of labor and the human factor in industry.

A course in these Schools, combining theory and practice, teams with opportunity. Here
one secures those fundamentals which give not only ﬁnancial success and fame, but the training
which fits one for service and for civilization.

THE SCHOOL or DENTISTRY

HERE are three dates of particular importance in the

history of the Dental School: 1896, when the school

was organized with an enrollment of one hundred students;

1912, when the School was moved from down town to the

University Campus; and 1926, when the requirements for

admission were raised to two years of academic college
work.

The School grew slowly during its ﬁrst sixteen years
in its rather cramped quarters downtown. But since its
removal to the University campus it has grown so rapidly
that it now has a larger enrollment than any other dental
school. At present the number of dental and pre-dental
students is nine hundred and twenty. However, the large
enrollment has not been allowed to interfere with the stand-
ard of work. Ninety—seven and one-half percent of the
1,418 graduates which have been examined since 1910
passed the State Boards on first trial.

Believing in the importance of a liberal foundation
for the highly specialized training necessary in dentistry,
the School has instituted the present requirement of two
years work in the College, so that now the training in
dentistry extends over a period of ﬁve years.

 

H. EDMUND FRIESELL

Dr. Frierell, dean of the School of Den-
tirtry, war graduated from Pitt with a
B. S. degree, and later took him D. D. S.
from the Penmylvania College of Den-
rim}. From Marquette Urziverrity,
Dean Frierell received the honorary de-
gree of LL. D. Dr. Frierell i: the
Profeuor of Operative Dmtixtrjl and
i: the author of numerom article: on
dental mhjeetr.

At present the School occupies three buildings and has two hundred and twenty-five operat-
ing chairs in its inﬁrmary. During the past year, more than 110,000 operations were performed.
The School also maintains forty-four extra—mural clinics in the various homes, asylums, hospitals,

health centers, and schools of the Pittsburgh District.

One hundred and two members comprise the faculty and teaching staff, several of whom
are at present engaged in dental research. Several courses in graduate instruction are being

given.

On the various inspections and classiﬁcations of dental schools, conducted by the Dental
Educational Council of America since 1918, the School has always received an “A" rating.

THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE

HE School of Medicine was begun as a stock corpora-

tion midway in the nineteenth century. In 1892 it be-
came part of the University of Pittsburgh, then Western
University of Pennsylvania. Its scope has widened stead-
ily so that now it is rated class A by the Council of
Medical Education of the American Medical Association.

The aim of the School is to give students adequate
preparation for the practice of scientiﬁc medicine: to teach
them medical ethics and history of medicine so that they
may do their full duty to the people and understand their
obligations to their fellow practitioners, to teach them

 

RALEIGH RUSSEL HUGGINS

Dr. Huggim, dam 0f the Sc/Mal of
Medicine, rercived bi: M. D. from tbe

Mim,-M,dm1C,1,,g,_ Em-,1” ,,,,_ their personal responsibility in the support of proper
ing in tin‘: executive capacity, Dr. ideals in medicine, to educate them so that they may
Huggini ii Pmfmw 0f GJ””0[0£J at intelligently evaluate the latest develo ments and utilize

Pi”, “"4 ’”‘””"””‘ " “U P’”‘”"' only those which are found to be true an sound in principle.

The method of accomplishing this aim is first to
insure in the student a general maturity of mind by two
years comprehensive study in the College. The next two
years are devoted almost entirely to theory in pathology,
anatomy, bacteriology, physiology. His last two years
of preparation are devoted to clinical instruction. In the

seventh year of his apprenticeship he must serveras an interne in an approved hospital.

At present the Medical School is afﬁliated with a number of Pittsburgh’s ﬁnest hospitals
where the School offers its clinical courses. However, since there is a need for a closer union
of hospital and school plans are being made for a Medical Center. Physically, a medical center
is a coalition of hospitals with a great University; a true medical center is also a coalition of
initiative in research and of inspiration in treatment and study of disease. The new Medical
School Will be created in the light of the highest possible ideals. Students may there study
all types of disease. Nurses will receive broader and sounder education. Specialists from all
sections will be drawn to hospitals of the group to diagnose and treat complex ailments. The
medical school faculty will serve as part of the staff of each hospital. Research men will be
given materials upon which to base quests not heretofore made.

WITH excited ﬁngers he has touched many doorways. Now
he has slipped through the rnassy door to the hush of the
great arches. Many times he has sat in the warm glow of a hearth
ﬁre, but never has he felt the chill mystery of the silent aisles. He
is alone except for a few wanderers who have traveled during many
years to reach this dwelling-place of heavenly calm. And now they
are calm. But the arches of the nave set his soul yearning and his
body reaching, and a great breath stirs in his inmost being. He
must move away to the peace of warm sunshine which falls through
the storied windows, but millions of tiny panes have twisted the
light into prisms of color so that it lies shattered like his soul
upon the marble pavement. The choir is not empty for a few little
men and women kneel praying on rosaries of winged iambics.
Above the clustered pillars an organ sings—sometimes a thundering
choral rhapsody that must make his body shout and his soul exult,
sometimes it is a thin minor melody, the strange, sad notes drifting
through the forest of archways to beat themselves out into silence
against the vaults. He must get away, for his soul is a grotesque
thing which ﬁnds no expression here.

Now he is clinging to the tallest pinnacle of the cathedral
with the blue sky all around him and the little children inﬁnitely
small below, and he sees a dog bark but he cannot hear him. He
sits there in the blue radiance carving out his gargoyle.

pay for It.

[Since the City will haoe to pay for it.]

Hamlin. Certainly. In which of my capacities? Of course, as First Lord of the Treasury, I could propose a special
Vote that would cover all expenses, if it were not that, as Leader of the Opposition, it would be my duty to resist it, tooth
and nail. Or, as Paymaster-General, I could so cook the accounts that, as Lord High Auditor, I should never discover the
fraud. But then, as Archbishop of Titipu, it would be my duty to denounce my dishonesty and give myself into my own
custody as first Commissioner of Police.

Bill D. That's extremely awkward.

THE SCHOOL or PHARMACY

THE chief business of the School of Pharmacy is to
produce graduates that are competent to engage in
the work demanded of pharmacists. Since the peculiar re-
sponsibility vested in the pharmacist in his relation to
physicians and their patients in the compounding of pre-
scriptions requires dependability of high order, the prime
consideration is that the school produce safe pharmacists.

In View of the fact that pharmacy is both a science
and an art, the school feels that, in addition, to the nec-
essity of acquainting the student with the requisite prin-
ciples upon which the science and art are based, it should
also provide actual training in the profession. For this
reason it has always required experience in a pharmacy
under the immediate supervision of a properly qualiﬁed
pharmacist as a prerequisite for graduation.

In the teaching of pharmacy and the collateral sciences
the purpose is always to indicate the dependence of the
sciences one upon the other, as well as to point out how
social and economic progress increase in direct proportion
to the realization and the action upon this fact by members
of the different professions and businesses. As pharma-

A TouR or THE CAMPUS

Dean Thyrsa W. Amos, believing, as she does, in the young woman of today, sets out on a
grand tour, to prove whether this Campus, or any Campus, so conceived or so dedicated, can long
demure. Her retinue, body-guard, slaves, and regalia bearers were made up of John R. Johnson,
Helen E. Rush, the mail boys and Mr. Samuel Altschuler.

By this time Helen Rush felt her daily urge
for a cocoa-cola, so the gay little party turned
in Ben Moses just to please her. Imagine
John _]ohnson’s perturbation at seeing Don
Brown telling Harrison where to get off.

Up the hill they skipped laughing merrily
at the birds and bees and ﬂowers; they were
happy in the thought that the May Queen
was soon to be crowned. As they peeped
around a corner of the Heinz House they saw
Bill Morrell in Paradise. The dear little
fellow was reading a paper on Life At Pitt,
to the blessed damosels.

The 1928 Owl

As they proceeded down the long stadium
steps, the attention of party started to cross
to the faculty club when their attention was
arrested by a prolonged wail from J. G. Quick.
And there running along Terrace street were
the Freshmen. The cruel ruﬂians had wrest-
ed the pushball from the meek and helpless
sophomores. They were, however, closely
pursued by Herb Dent, but due to the en-
couragements of Annemarie, the Frosh made
away with it.

 

Percy Hunt and Freckle; Gezbberr

As the hour was growing late everyone
was anxious to get through and over to Mor-

went to see the men digging up the school.
You can only imagine their pleasure to dis-
cover Mr. Stone himself, gallantly attempt-
ing a rescue of Ruth Crawford Mitchell from
Mr. Webster, who had scooped her up in an
idle steam shovel.

They stumbled up to the Faculty Club and
burst in upon Percy Hunt and Freckles Gab-
bert, swinging in the draperies. Dean Amos
was properly incensed, you may be sure.
Morrell sent quickly for a camera man.
When questioned, he divulged that he would
use the picture to illustrate the next edition
of Life at Pm. “What that publication
needs," Morrell remarked, "are some true to
life campus scenes.”

PEERGRINATIONS
OF

SHERLOCK HOLMES

"Well, we're here," deduced Sherlock Holmes, as they started down the chimney.

“What a stimulus," murmured John Watson, the imminent behaviourist. “How much
further is it?" .

“I don’t care,” ﬂung back Sherlock, whisking live coals from his ears. “Why is a mouse
when it spins?"

And they landed with a plop on the sweet hearth of Sigma Chi. A pathetic chorus arose.

“A cork in the cellar, tee—hee, tee—hee."

"Where are we?" reacted John.

But the famous detective was already in that famous hunting dog pose. He was pointing.

“Camels," he barked. “A tribute to their friends’ judgment."

Sherlock's eyes bloated and unbloated, as was their wont.

“Ah-ha-a-a—a!" he cried, bursting into raucous paroxysms of cynical laughter.

“Ah-ha-a-a—a!" cried John Watson, infamous behaviourist, clutching his throat in the best
psychological manner. But Sherlock was hot already.

“To YOUR eyes, and to the eyes of the ordinary observer, that speck of red paint on Al Lee's
nose is of no signiﬁcance; but that is Ben Moses’ BRAND. Two girls must have brought it here
because none but girls and brothers are allowed in the house."

“Al must have known those girls," said Watson sagely.

“That's entirely unnecessary. They must have been Chi O's."

"Say, what are we doing here anyway?"

“We are looking for the Pi Phi pledge. They mislaid her. The matter is of grave im-
portance."

Johnny, however, was swinging from the chandelier by his toes, having the time of his life.

“Watson," said Sherlock testily, “such childish activity hardly becomes you. A person
would almost think you were a Kappa Sig.”

“Oh, sir,” wept Johnny. “Not that! Antyhing but that!”

“Well, perha s not a Kappa Sig, but at any rate, a Lambda Chi Alpha," said the famous
detective thought ully. “Perhaps this bright looking lad can help us. Who are you, boy?"

‘Tm a Delt, sir,” he answered hopefully.

“You haven't seen the Pi Phi pledge around, have you? She wore a pink hair ribbon,"
suggested Watson.

“ I'm too young, sir," answered little Rollo.

“You use the wrong tactics, Watson." The great detective could be very severe in his
criticism. “You should have ﬁtst startled him into consciousness. We may as well keep on
walking now."

"Is that what we’re doing?"

“I beg your pardon, Watson. I realize I should have explained it to you. The unpracticed
eye might readily come to believe that we were playing chess, but if you had only taken care to
discern the absence of the chess board, you would have realized that we were walking, not
merely moving.”

“Is it true, Sherlock, that the Phi Gam A. C. is majoring in Political Science?"

“Watson, use the needle yourself. How could you have come by such a fantastic idea?"

“Shall I use the usual dope?"

“No. Leave the Theta Chi's out of this. Better use a local anaesthetic. Try that Theta
Delt over there." .

“No good. It's too fresh."

The gaunt ﬁgure of the vacant lot next to Scotland Yard cringed perceptibly. Sometimes
it seemed as if he could not go on. With a visible effort, he socked Watson on the jaw.

“You will perceive, Watson,” he twittered, “that that was not an ordinary sock. It was
a golﬁng sock, to be deﬁnitely distinguished from gonionemus by the absence of a velum and the
arrangement of the gonads."

Watson could not help but marvel at the man's eﬂiciency, which was the result of training
received with the Phi Eps during rushing season. Their methods were the most thorough that
he had ever witnessed; they overlooked nothing; and, if, like the Northwest Mounted they got
their man, it was not the child’s fault; his parents should have given him a better home training.

crystal water. You're eyes are like Katherine Cornell's.

She: I have loved Life and She has made me an anklet.

He: It is dusk. Let us imbibe strange potients and massage the face of Our Lady of In-
sensibility.

She: God, how I have loved Life.

He: Let us dance.

Prunella: I am going away tomorrow, Elias, to the city (eyes glowing), I am going to sing
before the whole world.

Elias: Prunella, I’m ashamed of you. Going to the city? And leaving me to work the farm.

Prunella: Why, Elias, it isn't my farm I'm leaving. The will gave everything to you.

Elias (coming swiftly to her, clutching her shoulders): You can't go; you must marry me.
The doctor says I have consumption.

ALICE IN
BLUNDERLAND

" UT,” said Alice to the dice, "why
do they call it Pitt?"

The dice spun around as if they had
been struck by lightning.

“Dummy," they screamed, “Pitt is
the thing that Pitt is named after."

Alice considered the matter, but in
the end she gave it up. It, however,
did not like the up. Then they came
to a seemingly endless ﬂight of stairs on
the side of a steep mountain.

“This is the way to knowledge,’
they told her.

Alice looked up aghast.

“If I climb up there every day will I
become educated?"

"Well, at least, you will become
pretty dam’ tired, and education a-
mounts to the same thing."

“But why should people get educated if they simply become weary of all things?"

“They don’t," conﬁded the dice.

"Don't what,” asked Alice.

"Who's whatting?" answered the dice nastily.

Alice thought perhaps Whatting was the name of a general in the Hundred Years war, but
she was not sure and did not like to say so. Instead she smiled sweetly at the professor and, after
pulling on a pair of chiffon stockings, crossed her legs just above the knee; whereat the professor
understood that she was a bright pupil and he gave her an A for the course.

“Well," said Alice, when she saw the A.

“What do you mean!" shouted the right die. (.rz'c.)

"She means well,” said the left die. (Mr)

(Ed. Note: We realize that singular of "dice" is "douse," but we feel obliged to humor
this fellow along. He needs humoring.)

“We must hurry," said the dice, “or we shall be late for an 8:30 class.’

“Why, you are late already. It is now 8:40." And Alice showed them her new wrist
watch on which she had already paid three installments.

“No we’re not. Classes scheduled on the half hour start at seven minutes after the half
hour."

“How silly," thought Alice. “But: anyway they are late."

“No one is ever late for an 8:30," said the dice impatiently, reading her mind. “It just
isn't being done, and don't let us tell you again. No matter what time they come, no one is"

But Alice screamed.

“Why did you interrupt us?" demanded the dice.

“You told me not to let you tell me again.”

The dice shot her three times through the heart, and Alice began to cry bitterly, as if her
heart was broken. The dice did not know how to console her, but they decided to take her on a
tour of the campus. The Y. M. C. A. gave each member of the party an alpen-stock and a rope
before they set out.

“Here is Alumni Hall," they told her.

"What kind of a hall is a lumni hall?" she queried brightly.

The dice called for a silent prayer before they entered the building. They, nevertheless,
entered.

“Oh, there is a ribbon clerk from Piccadilly Circus,” cried Alice, and cried and cried and
cried.

"He looks like he is from a circus perhaps, but he is not, so far as we know. He teaches
English, and sets down inexorable laws for the operation of the language," whispered the dice.

THE SCHOOL OF LAW

N the early years there were professorships of law in
the University, but no regularly organized law school
existed as one of its departments until 1895, under the
administration of Chancellor Holland. Hon. john D.
Shafer, the ﬁrst Dean, held office until the year 1920; and
thereafter continued as Dean Emeritus until his recent
death. Judge Shafer’s successor still occupies the office
of Dean and has been connected with the Law School in
an administrative and teaching capacity for about twenty-
ﬁve years.

This Law School was one of the pioneers in raising the
entrance requirements so as to provide for a college educa-
tion as a prerequisite to the study of law. All of its
students are now college graduates. The entrance require-
ments are only equalled by four or ﬁve other schools in the
United States. This year there are two hundred and
forty-one students studying at the Law School and it is
rather a remarkable fact that they are graduates of forty-
two different colleges. By far the largest section of the
student body now comes from the University of Pittsburgh,
although in the earlier years of the Law School, Washing-

ton and Jefferson College was first, and still has undisputed hold on second place in the enroll-
ment, with Princeton and Yale holding third and fourth places.

The Faculty is composed in part by men who give their entire time to teaching law and in
part by practicing lawyers and judges. The School aims to give a thorough groundwork for
legal education and admission to the Bar.

“Why doesn't he teach American?"
asked Alice.

“We often wish he would. It’s just
swank, that’s all. Swank. He thinks
English, particularly mid-Victorian
English, is better than American."

“Is it?"

“Of course," answered the dice peev-
ishly, "but what difference does that
make?"

In a short time they were climbing
stairs again.

‘ ‘Are we ascending to Heaven?" Alice
wanted to know.

The dice looked at her critically.

“If you looked a bit more like little
Eva, we might get away with it; but I
guess not. Let us go to the Heinz house
instead. That's just as good as Heaven.
As Wit and Humor of 1907 says, there
isn't a damned soul there. Such good

3"? wholesome girls. I’m sure you won't
like it.”

“Well," said Alice again. And this time the dice were sure that she meant well. Anyone
who goes to the Heinz house does.

“Who are these grinning gillies here? Are they dressed up for an Ibsen play?" asked Alice.

"They are sorority girls, and these are their own clothes," she was told. "They are very
clever, and charming, and active. If you don’t believe us, ask them."

“And who are those boys with the big heads and the pretty sneers?"

“They are the cream of the campus, supposedly, but really the best stuff on the campus is
only skim milk."

“But why do they all wear their coats open?"

"Most of them do it to show their fraternity pins, but some of them have to keep cool.
They think that they are hot men."

“O father, I see a gleaming light. 0 pray, what may it be?"

“That is a graduate assistant. He is a very bright boy."

“And are those wooden shacks a part of the university?"

“No," said the dice, and rolled a seven just for luck. “That first one is the Kappa Sig book
store, and the others are the stables for the dental students."

"And what is that eating place in the basement of the dental school?"

"That's a gambling joint. You take a chance on everything you pick out, and, when you
are through picking, you lose a lot of money. It is a lot of fun. Now if you are a good girl and
stop asking questions for ﬁve minutes, we will take you to see the stadium, which is a very
grand sight."

“The stadium is very concrete," said Alice. "I shall use it in an English theme.’

The dice shot her again, and this time they meant it.

The university encourages all kinds of sports. Of them all the
winter sports with their gayety and carefree comaraderi are by far
the best. Winter weather makes possible a degree of cold—blooded-
ness that is never found in football. Besides, sports have such an
inﬂuence on the English language. Consider an apt expression for
slight mental deficiency: “He don’t have all his commies, no sir."

There is one team we have forgotten to mention: The Pan-
hellenic Conference Mudslingers. These excellent marksmen have
won all their games since their inception on Campus and their score
is something horrible.

SOUR SONIA

A Jmm/aing Jerial of mrarit} life and the tmtamobile induytiy at Pitt.
“She came from poor but dixlzonext pzzrmtr, tlziy gal, but J/ac kept her virtue-

bidden. "

CHAPTER I

It must have been fate that made her step into the cafeteria on just that day. Grabbing

a tray she tripped down the aisle. And then she saw him!

She had stretched out her hand-

and into it fell a hot potato. But, ha! ha! what cared she, Sloppy Sonia was in love. It was
the man with the ladle, she had seen his picture in the Panther. He looked steadily into her
eyes, “Soup, lady?" “Yes," she trembled, "I'll have soup."

CHAPTER II

Sonia was born in Sheboygan. Her father
was born in Sheboygan. People were always
being born there. Sheboygan was like that.
At the age of two Sonia spit in her father's
eye. It was too horrid. She thought she
would scream. Two years later she matricu-
lated at Pitt and took a course in testimonial
writing for the University. Then she met
Tuffy. He ladled soup in the cafeteria. It
was too much. (Get it).

CHAPTER III

That night the Rollo boys were preparing
another putrid column for the Panther.
"Say," said Olga (a mischievous fellow),
"let's make this issue a funny one." (You
can imagine what an uproar this raised).
“Either you will or get out,” said Don,
getting up with his usual grace.
“Oh, ho!" said Grace, ‘'1 must recite~—
“My luv hath a red, red nose."
“That Burns," he queried?
“No," came back our bow—legged beauty
“But it's Browning."
(The literary merit of the above cannot be
recommended too highly).

Peergrinations of Sherlock Holmes
Continued from page 431

The celebrated two were back in the lodging's on Baker Street talking over old times.
There was a playful sneer dancing about the features of the famous detective and having a bad
time trying to hop over the nose. He was trying to forget his days spent at Pitt. The Sig
Alph’s lost a good man when Holmes decided to assume the study of crime. Who didn't?
Holmes might have been a great actor as well as a detective, or anything else that Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle Wished to make of him. Pitt can always be thankful that Holmes was not made
a Trustee.

"That moment," Holmes was saying, "That moment that I saw the mud on the cuffs of his
trousers, I knew he was an S. A. E. The rest was simple. It was only necessary to ﬁnd a four
letter word meaning maloclusion and the puzzle was solved and another of England's most
notorious criminals, a paramount menace to society, was wearing a pledge button at the Phi
Delt house."

Watson yawned, but missed.

THE DOWNTOWN DIVISION

NLY a few business courses of a practical nature were
offered by the University of Pittsburgh Evening
School at its founding in 1908. Soon, however, liberal arts
courses were added. In 1923 came a consolidation of Even-
ing School and the School of Business Administration. By
the spring of 1926 it was deemed advisable to extend the
curriculum to include an almost complete undergraduate
program.

Nearly every vocation from bank president to office
boy is represented in the student body of the Downtown
Division: physicians, lawyers, teachers, miners, bankers,
accountants, credit men, realtors, engineers. The Down-
town Division was created for young men and women, who,
because of full time employment are unable to attend day
sessions of the University. The same Educational oppor-
tunities are given to them as are given to day students.
Rules concerning standards, requirements, and credits
awarded are the same as those in force elsewhere in the
University. From 4:20 to 9:35 classes are held on the
tenth ﬂoor of the Chamber of Commerce Building, trans-
portation and business center of the city. There is an

T was a silly night. Let's not argue about that. john G. knew it, Don knew it, and the
Pitt Weekly was catching on—yes, sir, it was a silly night!

Except for the wail of a misplaced semi-colon in Hunt's office, not a sound ﬂoated across
the campus. Suddenly a warm breeze came up; it was not long before the rest of the directors
arrived. [There is hardly any doubt in the editor's mind as to the last statement. But we
must hurry on].

It was common knowledge that wise men
had met for serious business. [This seems
ludicrous now]. Dean Harrison opened the
meeting with a short, snappy, prayer,
“Either you will or get out," and put the
meeting on a more intellectual basis. With
almost no slobbering the meeting got under
way. After discussing the mortgage on

ILK alone has endured as the staple
food for mankind down through the
ages. While individual preference has ex-
isted at times for meats and vegetables or
herbs, at no one particular time has Milk
been eliminated entirely as a food in the family
diet.

Nature intended that Milk should be man’s
foremost food and placed therein all the ele-
ments necessary to build a sturdy frame and
body and to keep it strong.

Health, strength and beauty, for health builds
beauty, are yours in immeasurable quantities
when you follow the rule of drinking plenty,
at least a quart, of Milk daily.

e TheForward Look .~«——

‘; ‘j’ statement that great success in anything
G   ' requires the forward look has long been axiom-
  atic but, like many other oft repeated truths,
 ‘*4’ is accepted with indifference and too frequent-
ly is unheeded. Every University student knows this
well, particularly as it applies to preparation for a career,
and it applies with no less aptness and importance to
the acquisition of ﬁnancial knowledge and the establish-
ment of habits of economy.

  

At the COMMONWEALTH, where we serve many
thousands of people in the various stratas of prosperity,
we daily see that those who save most successfully are
the ones who have the forward look—who plan their sav-
ings efforts in advance and therefore save with a purpose.

Always this bank’s ofﬁcers are glad to co-operate with
any people who wish to make deﬁnite, workable savings
plans.

In fact the friendly counsel assured each depositor in
connection with ANY ﬁnancial matter is one of the most
important factors contributing to the value of an account
at the COMMONWEALTH.

We invite your patronage, and assure you of our in-
terested co-operation.

HAT is conﬁdence? It’s the
(TD feeling of trust and faith you
have in yourself, in others,

in the tools you work with.

Conﬁdence can be misplaced; it
often is. You may overrate your
own powers-some do. A friend
may prove false—they sometimes do.
The tools you use in your vocation
may be unﬁt to bear the stress of
hard work; may have been made to
sell, not to serve. That also occurs.

The ﬁrst two are largely under
your own control.

You can get a fair idea of your
own abilities by measuring yourself
alongside of the people you meet.
You will soon learn to recognize
those who know more than you

know, and those who can do things
you cannot do.

It’s an interesting and i1lumina—
ting study, a good habit to form.
It keeps you from becoming unduly
conceited, because you get a truer
measure of your own powers, a
better—grounded judgment of others,
and so prevents forming friendships
on too slight a foundation.

As to the tools you work with,
your conﬁdence need never be mis-
placed. Most of the dentists now
at the top are using S. S. White tools.
You can do no better now than to
accept their judgment; as you get
experience, you will know it is
sound. The House never made a
catchpenny device. Whatever it
makes is fully guaranteed.

Five years is a long time,--z'm’t it?

An experienced technician may “set up”
twenty—ﬁve thousand plates in ﬁve years.

An experienced bridge technician may
solder thirty thousand bridges in ﬁve years.

It is the skill developed by this constant repetition that makes the dental
laboratory invaluable to the busy dentist.

But manual dexterity must be supplemented by knowledge, wide experience
with different methods, and the use of scientiﬁc equipment.

The Miller Idea is to pick the best technicians that money can procure, pro"
vide them with the best equipment that money can obtain, and so to or-
ganize the laboratory that there is no waste motion, and nothing to distract
the mind of the technician from his one job of doing the best work he
knows how.

EXTRAMURAL INSTRUCTION

EXTENSION

- NIVERSITY Extension includes the extra-mural ac-
tivities of the University. It is an expression of the

belief that a university should offer educational oppor-
tunities to those who, for social or economic reasons, cannot
attend its campus classes. It is the means by which the re-
sources of the university are made available to all who can
proﬁt by a Contact with university thought. Extension
teaching, both of a formal and informal character, is gener-
ally recognized as a ﬁrmly established part of the system
of higher education of American colleges and universities.
The methods of teaching employed by the Extension
Bureau are University Lectures, and Extension Class

which the University regularly conducts in residence.
Students are limited to a maximum of forty-ﬁve under-
graduate credits or six graduate credits in extension
courses. Last year classes were conducted in forty-seven
centers in the Pittsburgh district with an enrollment of over three thousand students.

SUMMER SCHOOL

During the summer session courses are offered by the College, the School of Business Ad-
ministration, the School of Education, and the Graduate School. These courses are intended
for graduates whose major interests are teaching and administrations, for college students who
wish to make up deﬁciencies or to continue advanced study for students who are seeking ad-
mission to professional schools, and for those who desire to pursue University study, purely
for its cultural or vocational values. The regular University faculty is supplemented by ex-
change professors from other universities and by outside specialists on Education. A branch
session in college and professional courses for both undergraduates and graduates is conducted

in the Johnstown High School by twelve University instructors. F_ W. SHOCKLEY

EDITOR’s NOTE: The Owl seeks knowledge and erudition in many strange places. One day as
it was scanning the horizon it noticed that an anchorite had taken up his holy abode upon the
Concrete Mixer for the Cathedral. The staff climbed to the top and discovered Roy Hamlin, the
Sage, mortifying himself in the best monastic manner. Seeing his condition we asked him for a
dissertation. Spoke he thus:

Beds were designed for sleeping in at night. Now that it is no longer the custom to sleep
at nights their place has been largely taken by movie theaters, telephone exchanges, classrooms,
Congress, and pews. It is felt that there are many more interesting things to do at night.

Beds are made of different materials. Flower beds are not the only ones that are made of
earth—so are river beds. Boarding house beds are made of stone—hence the expression “bed-
rock.’

By the same analogy children are said to be rocked to sleep. Sometimes grown people are
rocked to sleep. Fortunately there is no shortage of rocks

Some prefer other methods of pleasing the baby at night—such as walking the ﬂoor with
her. The dance ﬂoor.

It is practically a certainty that, sometime

the friendship and confidence of a bank. Begin
now to cultivate that friendship and establish
conﬁdence. There is no better way than by
opening an account, either checking or savings,
no matter how small. An acquaintance thus
begun between bank and customer may be bene-
ﬁcial in the years to come.

EDITOR'S NOTE: We thanked the Sage Roy Hamlin and were about to climb down from the
Concrete Mixer, but he raised his holy hand piously and disserted in this manner upon a subject
which seemed mightily important to him, the Sage Roy Hamlin:

Bath tubs serve many useful purposes, not the least of which is to distinguish Saturday
from the other days of the week. They are also used for washing the dog, for sleeping in when
two company bedrooms are required, for storng, coal, and for developing a ﬁne tenor voice.
One has been used on occasion to hold champagne, but this is felt to savor of ostentation.

Bath tubs are usually located inside the house. It was really rather eccentric Who adver-
tised for a furnished room "with bath on car line." There is another incident which might
suggest a desire for a combined air and water bath, but possibly it may be otherwise explained:
a modest gentleman confessed that it humiliated him horribly to see his family washing in the
yard.

‘Realized Vision

EVERY worthwhile achievement has
been the result of Vision—the in-
telligent anticipation of future condi-
tions.

It was the Vision ofa young man which
fore—saw the extension of transportation
by a more effective means of control.
Today, the Air Brake insures safe and
eﬂicient operation of trains, street cars,
and automotive vehicles.

Progress will continue to be made in all
lines of industry as Visions are seen and
brought to realization by intelligent
training well directed.

I was walking past the Theta house the other day and on the porch I saw one of the most
active sisters. She was sitting contentedly in the sun, her large eyes blinking a little, but quite
composedly powdering per lovely nose with one hand, while the rushing list was grasped
ﬁrmly in the other free paw.

A large gray Tri Delt, seeing a Kappa walking up to Alumni Hall with a piece of cheese in
her mouth, addressed her saying:

Hello, you great big Kappa, you. Where did you get that piece of cheese?

This isn't no piece of cheese. This is a Phi Gam.

For Legg had done something that had
never been done before at Tech. He had
corralled the picture ofa transient phenom-
enon. Translated, that means he had been
able to photograph the electrical disturbance
resulting from the closing and opening of
a circuit breaker.

Legg, E. E. ’16.

From that moment the

Legg's novel experiment was accom-
plished by a form of remote control rigged
up for the college laboratory's oscillograph.
Soon the Westinghouse Company ordered
one ofhis controls. And itwas natural that
Legg should follow his device to East Pitts-
burgh the next autumn, after he graduated.
First in the Research Department, then in
the Material and Process Department, he

continued to solve os-
cillographproblems.

The oscillograph
ﬁlms the records of
electric current by
means of an appara-

modern type, for

instance, has a vi-

But before Legg began his study, the
oscillograph, itself, was a clumsy con-
trivance weighing almost halfa ton. He
proved that a compact oscillograph,
operated with an incandescent lamp, was
practicable; first, with a three-element
model (one that will record the action of
three phenomena at the same time) weigh-
ing about 135 pounds. This was in 1917.
More recently a nine-element oscillograph
weighing only too pounds has been de-
veloped. And, acme of creative genius,
Legg has just produced a baby one-ele-
ment oscillograph, called the OSlSO—
which weighs but 7% pounds! For good
measure, Legg designed a holder for load-

thing that had been fruitlessly tried foryears.

As a result of these advances, power
companies are saved enormous expense in
learning vital characteristics of their cir-
cuits—and in solving problems faced by
their plants. For instance, by devising a
way to automatically record chance dis-
turbances on power lines, Legg has made
it possible with the OSISO to start
recording a picture I/tooo of a second
after lightning causes a flash.

And so it goes at Westinghouse with
many college men—not just one or a
few——but with hundreds throughout the
organization. They do their part in ad-
vancing the electrical industry while they ply
their profession amid unlimited opportunity
for creative work.

RESEARCH BUREAU FOR
RETAIL TRAINING

HE Research Bureau for Retail Training is one of the
cooperative divisions of the University of Pittsburgh.
Originally ﬁnanced in 1918 by seven of the department
stores in Pittsburgh, in 1925 it was provided by twenty of
the Pittsburgh stores with a permanent endowment of
$600,000. .
The function of the Bureau as stated by its founders is

 

“to apply the principles of psychology, economics, educa— JAMES HENRY GREENE
tion, and sociology to the solution of problems of retail- _DV- GWW, dimfarﬂftéeR¢’f7i1Tmi{1-

Each year ﬁfteen graduate students are selected by the 5,0,, 4, P,-m;,,,,g;,

Bureau for training. They are chosen on the basis of
qualiﬁcations essential for success in the several fields of
retail personnel work; and after a program of graduate
courses and work on the research projects, which fulﬁlls
the University requirements, they are given a master’s degree. The Bureau then assists its
graduates in securing positions of a personnel nature in department stores.

The completion of a research project involves the installation and successful maintenance
of its results in one or more member stores. This necessitates visits to the stores in order to
give assistance in adapting the Bureau material to the individual personnel programs. An
Information Service provides executives and personnel workers in the member stores with data
on current personnel problems.

The Pittsburgh member stores are Boggs 8; Buhl, Frank 8; Seder, Joseph Home Company,
Jones Dry Goods Company, Kaufmann Department Stores, Inc., Lewin-Neiman Company,
Meyer Jonasson 8; Company, Paulson Brothers, and The Rosenbaum Company.

WE VIEW WITH
ALARM

The number of fraternities which consider
themselves the most prominent on the campus

The expectations of Miss Amos for the
young women of today.

The tendency among these young women
to be on the Y. W. Candy Committee.

The audacity of Margaret Moore to move
in two or three organizations pictures, thus
proving herself the most active girl on the
campus.

The fact that some of our friends have ex-
pressed a desire to use our end papers for
everything from wall-paper to evening gowns

The militaristic attitude of Miss Jessie
Campbell as portrayed in the picture of hon-
orary captains of R.O.T.C. (see the Odyssey)

The horrible misuse of the word SPORTS
(p. 303).

And the Lambda Chi Alpha's—such a wide

This change of policy, the
placing of our ﬁller, lengther,
adequater, or what have you,
at the top of our colyum, in-
stead of at the bottom, has been
aforethought. There are
those—~believe it or not, among
others and still others at Our
University, there are those, we
say,—there may be those——We
hope there are those among the
illiterati that clutter the hall-
ways of Alumni (certainly not
State or Thaw) whose minds
are malleable enough to allow
them to get pleasure from this
throwing off of the yoke of
precedent, this seeking after
variety is for these people, or
for this person, if worst comes
to worst, that we have inno-
vated.

Another reason for this re-
lease from tradition, this re-
gardless ﬂeeing from precedent,
is that we feel the need of men-
tal discipline. In the ast we
have typed at a pace fhr nine
minutes and then dropped a
perpendicular from our last
paragraph to the bottom of the
colyum. Now we shall bound
ourselves, limit ourselves, ex-
tend ourselves: at the top of
the colyum we have boldly
placed our filler; at the bottom
of the colyum will rest our last
line!

MISCELLANEOUS

To Alianora the night lay still as the typewriters in
her father's office and the stars were silent like kittens dead
after small boys’ tormenting." During all the day she had
had nothing to do but watch the robins prepare for the
coming of three little tiny birdies who would bring them
together again. They were so happy, these little feathered
folk. If only she could find happiness. But it began to
rain and the great drops were heavy and gray as old glue is
gray after it has sat Without using for a long time. And
the sensitive ﬂowers were very sad to think of what damage
it would do. The tulips bent low to the ground trying as
best they ‘could to protect their exotic red gowns. Th-e
pear—tree, who is a beautiful lady, a little taller than is
usually considered good, wept buckets, and a cooing
pigeon with mother-of-pearl wings brought her a lace
handkerchief. It was heartbreaking. The rose-bush re-
fused to be comforted and dripped maddeningly upon the
old tom-cat who was too lame to venture forth from be-
neath it and must sit under the drip While his fur got wetter

and wetter.

the average carfare in Pittsburgh was

ALLEGHENY OBSERVATORY

HE Allegheny Observatory was founded in 1859 with
comparatively meager equipment by the Allegheny
Observatory Society, and in 1867 was transferred by deed of
gift to the University of Pittsburgh, which was then the
Western University of Pennsylvania. The Observatory
was first located on the summit of Observatory Hill. It
was moved to its present beautiful site in Riverview Park
in 1905, at which time its equipment was very materially
increased through donations by citizens of Pittsburgh.

Keeler, and Brashear. Langley's work on the heat of the

moon and the infra—red heat spectrum of the sun, which
gave him universal fame, was done at the old Observatory. It was here also that he started
his pioneer experiments in aerodynamics. William Thaw furnished the money for Langley's
experiments at a time when the idea of mechanical ﬂight was generally ridiculed.

Dr. Keeler continued to “press forward the boundaries of human knowledge." He is
famous among astronomers for his proof that the rings of Saturn are composed of countless
discrete particles, little moons in effect, each of which is pursuing its independent course around
the lanet.

Efhe Frick Public Evening Service, through which ﬁve to six thousand people a year are
permitted to visit the Observatory, is a fulﬁllment of "Uncle" John Brashear's dream that the
inspiring facts of astronomy be given to the general public.

MELLON INSTITUTE

ELLON Institute of Industrial Research of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh has for its aim the creation of
new knowledge by scientiﬁc investigation, in accordance
with the Industrial Fellowship System of Dr. Robert Ken-
nedy Duncan, which is that a problem being set by the per-
son, ﬁrm, or association interested in its solution, it is as-
signed to a scientiﬁc worker, who is engaged by the Institute
and given an Industrial Fellowship for a period of one year.
Each holder of an Industrial Fellowship is given for the
time being the broadest facilities for accomplishing a
deﬁnite piece of research, and all results obtained by him
belong to the donor of the Fellowship. In order to avoid
duplication of research activities at the Institute only one
investigation is conducted on a particular subject at any
one time.

This system was introduced at the University in 1911,
and in 1913 Messrs. Andrew W. and Richard B. Mellon
established Mellon Institute, which has brought the
University international fame. The sixty Industrial Fellow-
ships now operating require the services of more than one
hundred research chemists and engineers. Many notable

investigations have been carried out by Industrial Fellowships of the Institute, and every year
a number of new commercial processes are developed and numerous discoveries are reported in

the literature of science by Fellows.

The Institute does not offer deﬁnite courses of instruction, but the nature of investigative
procedure permits broad training of young scientists in research methods and in special sub]ects
of technolo . There is also a de artment of research in Pure Chemistr which studies more

ON THE SHORES OF LAKE ERIE

LASSES in Botany and Zoology were held at the Fish Hatchery Building, along the Bay _
shore at Erie, Pennsylvania, during the summer of 1926, thus beginning what will event-
ually develop into a full-ﬂedged fresh-water biological station.

Dr. S. H. Williams, Professor of Zoology at Pitt,
acted as director and had charge of the work in Zoology,
and Dr. 0. E. Jennings, Head of the Department of
Botany, gave the courses in Botany. The peninsula of
Presque Isle, at Eric, is well known to the botanists of
the country through the survey published a few years
‘ago by Dr. Jennings. Since then the place has been fre-
quently visited by botanists and zoologists, and par-
ticularly entomologists.

Presque Isle peninsula, now a State Park of Pennsyl-
vania, is about six miles long. It is entirely composed
of sand which has been accumulated by the joint action
of wind, wave, and vegetation, and it contains beaches,
dunes, sand-plain, forest, heath, ponds, and marshes. It
has been moving eastward along the shore at the rate of
about half of a mile per century and the various plants
and plant associations are moving along at a corresponding rate in successive waves, one after
the other. Even if it were not for the interesting bluffs, elevated lake-beaches, glacial ridges,
swamps, and deep ravines of the mainland, Presque Isle itself would make the Erie region

biologically one of the most interesting places in the East.

Lectures and laboratory Work were held on
the balcony of the Fish Hatchery where there was
little disturbance from visitors who came to see the
hatchery equipment and the fine specimens of the
Various kinds of living fish in the aquaria. How-
ever, there were diversions even here. Mr. Hart-
man, the Superintendent of the Fish Hatchery,
most efficient and accommodating at all times, used,
on occasion, appropriate language which some-
times ﬁltered beyond the conﬁnes of his nearby
office. The “love bird," a kind of parrot, often
whistled during the lecture so that he had to be
escorted behind scenes; much excitement was
caused one day by the ordinarily statuesque bull-
frog's trying to jump through his glass to get at
“]immie," Dr. Williams’ pet monkey, who mean-
time emitted cries of terror.

 
 

Page 48 The 1928 Owl

The work at the Hatchery was alternated with ﬁeld-trips, either to the Peninsula or to some
place on the mainland. If no other conveyance was ready at hand the auto-truck belonging to
the Hatchery was placed at our disposal and driven by Mr. Wagner. The truck was ﬁtted up
with benches and we often rode through the city announced by pictures of ﬁsh on the body of the
truck and the inscription “If you want good ﬁshing, obey the law." Needless to say, the
people of Erie looked and learned. Usually, on such trips, Miss Hartman, a member of the
class, saw to it that there was a plentiful supply of lemonade packed in ice. On the desert
sands of Presque Isle, at lunch time on a hot day in July, no drink could have been more
refreshing.

A number of the advanced students were
pursuing special studies. Mr. Predmore
worked on water-moulds, some of which are
dangerous parasites on ﬁsh; Miss Smith studi-
ed the vegetation along the bluﬁ‘ at the Head,
near Waldmere Park; Mr. Shaner rowed out
to a recently formed island in the Western part
of the Bay and assumed, for a time, the role of
Robinson Crusoe in thoroughly exploring it
from end to end; Miss Wilson with her micro-
scope and bottles studying algae, down on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Hatchery among the ﬁsh
tanks, excited much curiosity on the part of
visitors; Mr. Witz collected and studied the
mosses of the region; the class in ﬁeld zoology,
busily engaged in mounting and classifying
insects, were the source of much outside
interest, especially when they wildly waved their insect nets in the ﬁeld. Dr. Williams was
very soon recognized as “the bug catcher" by the State Police on the Peninsula. There was
mild excitement one day when Mr. Kredel caught a very scrappy puff-adder which turned out
instead to be a water snake well known for his ﬁghting ability.

Returning, one afternoon, from a trip to the Peninsula, the gasoline launch refused to answer
her rudder, much to the perplexity of the skipper. While drifting about, some of the class
utilized the opportunity to collect some of the Water plants which at times make Misery Bay
almost impassable. Then the mystery was solved: Mrs. Jennings discovered that a part of the
raiment of one of the young ladies of the class had become wound in the rudder gearing. It had
to be cut off with knives before the boat could proceed.

A spirit of good will and earnestness prevailed throughout, from the ﬁrst day the classes
met to the end of the six-weeks session which was suitably celebrated by a watermelon picnic.

There was so much to be covered in lecture and text and so much to be seen and learned in
laboratory and ﬁeld that achievement was continuous and interest never lagged. This pioneer
class will never forget these pleasant six weeks at Erie.

lilacs scented the dooryard and the new leaves rustled, I could ﬁnd
beauty in trees against the sky. Yesterday, Alice sang in the
garden and gathered sunﬂower seeds. She whispered softly, but
the maples heard her and I heard her. "Winter is coming and soon
you'll be gone”, she said. But her song echoed and reechoed, and
the fountain splashed more gaily on the mossy stones, and the dark
rafters of the hall seemed bright and new again. Yesterday, the
maples in my dooryard were the whole of my existence. I could
defy stern law and crabbed faiths; I could forget the world of men.
But all night I have sat alone while the wind was moaning like a lost
soul in the forest, until solitary I crept from the vastness where
poplars whirl against the sky. I must ﬁnd the crowded square
where noon chimes send the doves cooing and ﬂuttering along the
cobble stones. I must dwell in the shadow of the spires.

HALL OF FAME

 

The 1928 Owl

URS has been the problem, not of expressing
Pitt in terms of solid granite or the re-
sponse of the student body at pep meetings, but
of delineating the best that our University gives
in a group of men and women. A year ago the
members of the 1927 Owl staff gathered together
and by secret ballot chose ten men and ten women
of the graduating class who possessed not only
charm of person but leadership in activities and
classwork. Thus began another Pitt tradition.
Again in secret conclave far from the shouts over
galley proof and the plack, plack of Remingtons,
We talked over the seniors; glibly we discussed
values, as we ﬂicked a cigarette ash. And this
is our decision; this is our tribute.

OU wonder why I love the green, cool glade, the babbling
brook, the budding trees, where the white—throat sings in the
Maytime: you wonder why I do not dream of bold, blue mountain
peaks, why I would live in chequered shade, and pluck the violet and
anemone, and never seek the blazing heights. Oh, you would have
me clinging while you breathed beauty into gaunt rocks and thun-
dering torrents ; you would have me drink deep of startling reds and
purples of unclouded sunsets. With me close in your arms you
would leap cataracts that toss and foam between stark cliffs.
Towering, until I could not see my beloved, cloud-ﬂecked sky, your
hills would close me in and I would stumble on burdened with little
lives. At nightfall you would hurl your axe amid the rustling
pines and build a fire against the night in those great woods where
the restless stirring of monsters, and the screech of owls creep fore-
bodingly through the blackness, and the vastness cowers the soul.
Michel, you are forever calling from your mountains and you
wonder why my voice sounds sweet and distant as from a land of
humming bees and nodding primroses. My love is of sunlit paths
and silent groves. O, cease to wonder!

HE University is a small world through
which we pass on our journeys toward cer-
tain destined goals. It is a small world in which
we become gradually acclimated to that harshly
mysterious world of which we shall always hear
whispered such diverse and awesome rumors, but
which will lie always just beyond the horizon.
For never while we are in any of the worlds of
which we commonly speak shall we really come
into this large world for which we eternally
prepare.

STUDENT COUNCIL

THE executive authority of the student body of the University is vested in Student Council
of the Student Self Government Association. The membership of the group consists of
twelve men and four women, with advisors, members ex-oﬂicio.

Council, since its inception last spring, has gradually assumed supervision of practically
all non-athletic student activities. Through the Student Relations committee of the governing
body, all student social affairs at the University are supervised. Pitt Week is also under the
direct supervision of Council, as is the vocational guidance conference and other similar student
activities. All ﬁnancial drives must be approved by the body and any new clubs organized
among undergraduates must be favored by Council before they receive University recognition.

The group is made up of juniors and seniors, elected in the spring each year by proportional
representation. The oﬂicers are elected internally immediately after the general election.

W. S. G. A.

N Lantern Night the Freshmen meet Father Pitt in solemn conclave at Memorial Hall.

The candles of their lanterns are lit by upperclassmen; then all ﬁle out over the broad

entrance to march in a long trail up the lamp-lit Drive and ﬁnally to circle back again to the

Sanctum where Alma Mater waits, where Virtus and Veritas demand high vows. This is the
formal presentation of the Freshmen to Pitt tradition.

On half a dozen afternoons a visiting celebrity or a member of our faculty gathers a circle
of interested listeners about the hearth in the Heinz House to discuss a book. Here the most
diverting of romances are affectionately dissected; plots are stripped of their characters and char-
acters are stripped from their plots. Over the teacups there is chatter about late periodicals and
later campus news. W. S. G. A. fosters intellectual development.

At the activities Pageant each girls’ organization presents a charade before the appointed
judges. Then it is that Debaters deliver silver-tongued orations, that W. A. A. shows us the
healthy American girl exuberant with sports sweaters and hockey sticks, that Pitt Players pre-
sent a dramatic moment. Here is the panorama of activities. Thus W. S. G. A. guides the
individual girl so that she may become active in the organizations which will develop her
talents and personality. ,

Senior Breakfast is W. S. G. A.’s farewell to the Seniors. Then it is that the Senior Queen
advances to her coronation under a golden canopy upheld by the pikes of her retainers. In the
ceremony of crowning, which is taken from the rituals of the old Saxon Queens, all the ideals
of W. S. G. A. are expressed and the aim “to foster a spirit of unity and loyalty to the Univer-
sity" is beautifully accomplished.

THE OWL OFFICE

IN six days God made the world and all that therein is; on the seventh day he rested. But
on the eighth, ninth, and so-on days, he prepared the world for the Owl Office. He con-
trived all manner of this’: and t/azzt'.r.' this caused Street Cars to run past our front door so that
the Owl Staff can make use of their passes; tlaat caused a particular placing of the Cab Station
to the Editor's left as she goes out; of course, it was for the more efficient functioning of the Owl
Office that the University was erected so near to it; and who can say that it is a mere coincidence
that the streets are paved to our left, back, and front? Not many of the Campus publications
have as many as ten Noiseless typewriters! Few Campus publications even have four dial
phones! Seldom is a Campus publication equipped with indirect lighting or automatic proof-
reading machines! Ah, indeed, the Owl HAS boasts.

Just a little more than a stone's throw from the center of our Office a small door opens into
the panther cupboard. We're rather fond of the panther, poor creature, but he does track up
our hall-way, and his master has such a preference for other people's cigarettes—and for other
people's matches. But we treat them both kindly (do you know, we think the panther's
master is just a little bit-—well—crazy).

We've often questioned the wisdom of Providence in placing the weekly office scarcelya
typewriter’s click from the far southwest corner of our Oﬂice, and it is deucedly hard to choose
between the P. A. A. and the Schenley for lunch. However, these minor inconveniences are
scarcely deplorable. The proximity of the weekly oﬂice gives us an almost democratic glow.
Webster Hall was rather a blow, but, on the whole, Fate has dealt fairly with us.

Do you know, we think this cathedral of learning that's being built behind us so late every
night is really going to be rather clever. As we were saying to Ruth Crawford Mitchell, and
to Mr. Stone and Mr. Webster, the Oﬂice looks so almost lonely now, and the University de-
serves something just a little better than State and Alumni and Military Department, and it was
amusing, the other day, to watch the weekly ofﬁce tumble into a hole that a stray stick of
dynamite blew.

The WEEKLY Oﬂice,
Frick Acres,

March 1, 1927
THE OWL Oﬂice,

Frick Acres.

Dear Owl:

We received your note of the twelfth inst., asking for more boiler-plate to pad out and break
the monotony of your organization section. You say you might even publish Our Own Opinion
of Ourself. We enjoy telling people about our great accomplishments in this world and our
plans for eternity.

You have asked us how we manage to get such handsome editorslfor the Weekly. You
may be right, and we wouldn’t go so far as to say you're wrong; but still, at the same time.

You have asked us how it happens that ours is the best weekly publication west of East
Lynn. Now, we wouldn't have put it just that way; but, since you're’ so sure you're right,
we'll take your word for it. Of course, The Owl will be coming out weekly from May first to
June thirtieth; but then, The Owl is usually classiﬁed as an annual. So we may say, without

fear of successful contradiction, that we each of us leads all other publications in our respective
ﬁelds.

You have also asked how we manage to assemble and maintain such an eﬂicient and in-
telligent staif. Probably, it’s because we’re all kindred spirits over here at the Weekly oﬂice.
You see, we all have brains. We like to associate with people of our own intellectual attain-
ments. We try to be democratic, of course, but still, you can't blame us for ﬁnding our greatest
enjoyment in each other's company. Come over sometime; we might do you good.

You really shouldn't ask us why we're all so popular. So few people have discovered as
yet why we have so many co-eds park their chewing gum under our desks. If it would help
any, we might hand out a questionnaire among a hundred odd co-eds. But then, some people
might think we were a bit conceited; so, you might write out the questionnaire and sign it;
then, we'll have it printed and distributed.

Again, you have asked us how we succeeded in obtaining such a magnificent and convenient
oﬂice. Don't you think you are exaggerating the facts just a triﬂe? We are proud of our ofﬁce,
to be sure; but, nevertheless, it has some few inconveniences.

Finally, you want to know how we keep our typewriters in such good condition, well
really,-say, you haven't been kidding us, have you?

Sincerely yours,

THE PITT WEEKLY.

H15 PLAYMATE, BILLY PITT

Let’s sing a name that’s known to fame, A name that meets with loud ac-claim.
With-out a spot of shame or blame, It’s Pm, Billy . Pm. [I;<gg;1;o;gx§°;;;;;«

AND it came to pass that, while Adam and Eve were baptizing the animals, one came to
them who looked neither this way nor that way. Neither could it dance a Kazatzki.
“What shall we name this strange abortion?" Eve asked, while she critically arranged a ﬁg leaf.
“He has come to us on a Tuesday; therefore, he shall be named Panther," answered Adam, with
Biblical logic. Whereupon he called up his publishers to arrange for a new edition of the book
of Genesis, to be printed on Japanese vellum with Unexpurgated under the title; but its contents
are really not more harmful than a wholesome portion of shredded wheat.

After the departure from Egypt, Panther became lonely for the boys and started to come to
Pitt. Unfortunately, it did not have enough credits in History of Religion and our hero was
denied admission. For many days and many nights, Panther wandered on the face of the earth,
picking up little tales here and there. Panther has preserved these tales from the Middle Ages,
and just loves to recount them, if you are not watching.

During the Renaissance, Panther could not decide whether to get a boy-bob or whether to
let it grow; but by the time of the Reformation it had adopted a deﬁnite policy of Lomez faire.
Panther’s childhood was precocious. At the age of thirty seven, it could say “Dada" and
“What the Hell." Panther earned its first dollar selling castile soap in an effort to win a doll
that talks and walks. By this time, its brilliant future was definitely assured.

Panther suffered chronically from colds in the head and wasideplorably phlegmatic until
the early days of 1927, when it became much worse under the inspired guidance of the only
modern parallel to Tacitus. He struck me with a blunt instrument and I remember nothing

after that. From Pant/oer Autobiography
When Pitt was nothing but a pup, Who hung his pants on Kaufmann's
And oft alluded to as “Wup," dock
