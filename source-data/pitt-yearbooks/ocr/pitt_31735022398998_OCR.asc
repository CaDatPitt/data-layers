INTERNATIONAL

All aroundrthe globe, the year
that was 1984 was marked by
death, wars and negotiations. It
was a year of fighting in Gren-
ada, in Lebanon, in South Ko-
rea, in Beirut. It was a year of
deaths, of Andropov's, of
peace-keeping Marines, of 269
people on a downed Korea-in air-
liner. It was a year of ‘‘talks,'’
with Andropov, with Castro,
with Thatcher, of Strategic

Arms Limitations. There were,-

certainly mixed feelings all
around. Who was right and who
was" wrong were mere formali-
ties —— what to do was more the
question. And just what did
they do?

Repeated bombings and brea-
kouts of fighting in Beirut test-
ed Reagan's policies on Mid-East
affairs. Indeed the bombings
were tragic, but why the Ma-
rines were there to begin with,
makes it seem all the less ex-
plainable. They were first sent
to monitor the withdrawal of the
P.L.O. Then «they were to pro-
vide stability as Syria and Israel
pulled out of territories they oc-
cupied. The lsraelies eventually
pulled out, but as the Lebanese
remained, so too did our Ma-

y rines. Questions were raised on

the U.S.'s right to exert its mili-
tary prowess around the world.
Nevertheless, over 200 Marines
are dead without any clear rea-
son and still the conflict has not
been resolved.

Soviet leader Yuri Andropov’s
death was best described in

6 lntroduction/lnternational

    
 

Newsweek: “Only in a geronto- '

cracy could it be said of a leader
of 69 that he died young. Yet
that is what befell (him). He
was, if not a man of vision, a
man of intelligence, toughness
and caution. But he had to wait
until he was 68 for the chance
to lead — and by then it was too
late. He showed signs of revital-
izing Russia by promoting a
younger group of his own fol-
lowing. Relations with the (LS.
improved somewhat.

He was tough, but he was too
late. Only his successors will
prove if his legacy will be car-
ried on." V

Of course, the downing of the
Korean Air Lines Flight 007 on
September 1 by the Soviets did
not help anyone. “The airliner’s
destruction was the nadir of An-
dropov's first year. lt showed
lack of firm command and poor

A Time to Begin

162nd Commencement Held

The University of Pittsburgh
1(>2nd Commencement Convo-
cation, delayed a week because
of Easter, took place on Sunday
April 29, 1984, at the Civic Are-
na in downtown Pittsburgh.
Graduates, wearing Pitt’s tradi-
tional blue cap and gown with
their tassel corresponding to
the school, were seated on the
main floor. Parents and friends
were seated in the stands to
watch the 1600 students gra-
duate.

Governor Dick Thornburgh
spoke on “Competence and the
New Economy”. He received an
honorary doctorate of Public
Service for speaking at com-
mencement. Governor Thorn-
burgh graduated from Pitt in
1957. The Pittsburgh Youth
Symphony provided the music
for the ceremony.

As a graduate there you were
standing with your class as it
was called out and flipping your
tassel to the left. Was it really
over? This is it, what you waited
four or more years for — gradu-
ation. All those nights studying
and worrying until grades were
posted were behind you now.
It's time to start living a normal
life. But what is a normal life?
For at least 16 years you’ve been
in school and living from test to
test. For some, that kind of life
will continue as they enter gra-
duate or medical school. But
most managed to get jobs in a
market that seemed much less
than promising. But whatever
the plans, all took on a new role
on Sunday April 29, 1984 —
alumni of the University of
Pittsburgh.

Where’s the Syllabus?

Students take classes just for the fun

When the student union re-
opened in the fall, many of the
activities that had been on hold
during construction resumed
again. One of these is the Lei-
sure Learning Program. The
classes are designed to be infor-
mative without the pressures of
everyday classes. The non-cred-
it classes are sponsored by PPC.
Though geared toward under-
graduates, they are open to the
general public for an additional
cost. The cost of the classes
ranges from $10 to $15. The
program was held in both fall
and winter terms. The fall ses-
sion ran from October 1
through November 18, 1983,
and the winter from February 6
through March 26, 1984.

The variety of classes offered
was vast enough that anyone
could find one that was of inter-
est to them. The emphasis, as in
one ballet class, was on fun and
exercise. Students were taught
basic steps and more complicat-
ed movements. Other exercise
classes included aerobics and
belly dancing. For those not in-
terested in exercising, classes
such as make-up, hair design
and overcoming test jitters were
offered for self improvement.
For anyone interested in learn-
ing a new skill or just improving
their ability in an old one, they
could choose from nanchacku,
guitar or auto mechanics.
Courses like Witchcraft, Tarot
and the Kiswahili language

of it

were offered for those prefer-
ring something different. If you
wanted to relax, there were
classes in relaxation. There
were also classes in current
events, African and American
cultures and home-buying.

Wherever their interests lie, for
those that took Leisure Learn-
ing Classes, it proved to be a
very interesting 7 weeks. They
found that learning could not
only be leisurely but also fun.
Even though these courses
didn’t have tests or required
readings, the several hours a
week were the best way yet to
“blow off’ studying without a

guilty conscience.

In the Spotlight

Plays for and by Pitt Students

Pitt’s Studio Theatre, located in
B-72 of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, is still going strong after
fourteen years. Performances
are held every two to three
weeks to give Pitt students and
the public an opportunity to see
plays written by well-known
and up-and-coming authors.
Though an undergraduate stu-
dent organization, it is open to
anyone in the Pitt community
who is interested in participat-

ing.

The performing, directing, and
all the technical aspects of the
Studio Theatre are done by Pitt
students. Some students can get
credit in their Theatre Arts
classes by being involved in this
extracurricular activity.

Donna Saul, this year’s presi-

dent of the Studio Theatre, says
that a participant can do as

100 Activities/Studio Theatre

much as he can or wants to, or
he can do as little as he likes.”
There is no specific amount of
hours needed since the program
is done on a volunteer basis.

The plays are selected by the
Studio Theatre board and the
Theatre Arts department faculty
while the directors are respon-
sible for picking the cast for
each production. Then, students
rehearse two to five weeks for
every play, depending on the di-
rector’s schedule.

Many people come to view the
performances with sixty to nine-
ty percent of the theatre’s nine-
ty-six seating capacity being
filled. There is no admission
charge for undergraduates, but
there is a one dollar fee for all
other students and a three dol-
lar fee for general admission to
see these fine shows.

Lawrence Hall with many dif-
ferent activities to get involved
in. All day there were stands set
up, each with something differ-
ent to offer. The Nursing Stu-
dent Organization held a stand
ofstring art, the Druids had but-
ton making, the Pre-Law Soci-
ety had finger painting, and
there were thirty-five other or-
ganizations sponsoring other
stands.

Throughout the day there were
stage shows for the children to

join in and enjoy. There were
Guitarists Matt and Dan Kam-
bic, Beautiful Hands which is a
group of people singing with
the use of sign language, and a
final Sing-Along. All ofthese al-
lowed the children to get in-
volved by singing along or
dancing.

All day there was the Pirate
Parrot, the Steeler’s Terrible
Towel, Pitt Panther Brian Herr,
Clown Bobby Blaze and
Gumby, to greet the children

rewarding for all
and make them laugh.

All in all the day was a success.
The smiles on all those faces
were enough to see that. The
Hand-In-Hand Festival is “A
Celebration of Life . . . A Festi-
val of_]oy.”

After five weeks of intense prac-

student production of the two
act thriller “Deathtrap.” The
play was accompanied by a ban-
quet-style dinner held on Febru-

For three dollars, Pitt students

well as sit back to an entertain-
ing evening of drama. The two

coordinated their talents well
with the student cast. David

tention with his lively portrayal

the superior efforts of the cast,
most of whom were not drama

judgment.” According to Soviet
sources, Andropov was not con-
sulted before the Soviet mili-

tary, acting on standing orders,
used force to stop a violation of
Soviet airspace. But he bore the
responsibility for the disastrous
stance the Soviets adopted
after the plane hit the sea. For

six days, the Soviets refused to -

acknowledge that they had shot
the plane down, even though
the (.l.S. had already made pub-
lic tape recordings of Soviet pi-
lots describing the kill. The S0-
viet stonewall compounded the
calamity.

raged on. Policies and decisions
were enacted and revised. Pa-

Variety of Music in Concerts

 

It was yet another example of
the familiar Pitt phrase “Where
the best meet the best” as a na-
tionally recognized group of
jazz artists gathered here in
Pittsburgh for the thirteenth an-
nual jazz Seminar Concert.
Since 1970, the University of
Pittsburgh has proudly hosted
this jazz Seminar, which in-
cludes a select group of jazz mu-
sicians, many of whom are cre-
ators of the international jazz
forum.

Former guests of the Seminar
have included such well-known
names as Dizzy Gillespie, Ron
Carter, Grover Washington }r.,
and Sonny Rollins. This year’s
participants included Komua
Amoaku on African percussion,
Kenny Barron on piano, Idris
Muhammed on percussion (he
also works with Roberta Flack
and Emerson Lake and Palm-
er), Rufus Reid on bass, Woody
Shaw on trumpet, Eric Gale on

guitar (currently with Simon
and Garfunkel), Nathan Davis
on soprano sax (formerly with
Art Blakely) and johnny Grif-
fith on tenor sax (from Paris).

Dr. Davis has been organizing
and directing the jazz Seminar
since its inception in 1970 and is
Associate Professor of Music
here at Pitt.

The four day event involved sev-
eral intimate workshops given
by each of the participating art-
ists and ended in an explosive
concert that attracted students,
faculty and the Pittsburgh com-

 

munity as well. The Pittjazz En-
semble also participated at the
concert. The concert was held
in the Carnegie Music Hall on
Saturday, November 5, 1983,
and could be described as noth-

ing less than a deeply emotional
experience for those who at-
tended.

This Rendezvous for talented
jazz musicians from across the
country has created such an im-
pact on the city of Pittsburgh as
a whole that Mayor Caliguiri
proclaimed this week in No-
vember as “Pittjazz Week in the
City of Pittsburgh.”

Great concerts for less

Pitt students had a choice - in-
stead of paying $15 to $20 to see
a concert downtown, they could
see one for free or at a reduced
cost on campus. The concerts
were sponsered by the PPC con-
cert committee.

Boystown played outside of the
William Pitt Union on Septem-
ber 50, 1983. The concert gave
students a chance to enjoy the
fading summer warmth on 21 Fri-
day afternoon. Boystown is a lo-
cal band that can be seen in
many area clubs.

Internationally known Melba
Moore performed her new as
well as her older hits on Febru-
ary 17, 1984 at Carnegie Music
Hall. Her recent hit is “Keepin’
my lover satisfied.”

Comedian Steven Wright, who.

has appeared on many talk
shows and HBO, was on campus

on March 5th. He is famous for
his “off the wall” jokes told
with a totally straight face. One
example of his work is “I came
home late last night  it was
the next night.” Wright kept the
sold out audience laughing for
several hours straight.

Greg Greenway and Livingston
Taylor appeared together on
April 3rd at the William Pitt
Union. Greg Greenway and his
band, who also appeared on the
second, performed their own
blend of folk/rock. The mixture
provided several hours of pure
entertainment. Mr. Greenway’s
excellent rapport with the audi-
ence made it easy to have fun.
Livingston Taylor has been a fa-
vorite on college campuses for
many years. His folk style songs,
many of which are original,
added to the enjoyment of the
evening.

Ballet company comes to Pitt

On Wednesday, November 30,
1984, Pitt students were visited
by The Theatre Ballet of Can-
ada, a unique dance company
that brings the art of ballet and
the entertainment of the theatre
together in one exhilarating
presentation. The Syria Mosque
hosted this Pitt Program Coun-
cil event, which was a two act
presentation consisting first ofa
coordinated display of modern
dance techniques entitled “Ex-
cersions” and a second “Moral-
ities” demonstration in which
three fables were dramatized
and incorporated into dance
movements. The show was

highlighted by its colorful cos-
tume construction and lighting
effects.

The company is under the artis-
tic direction of Lawrence Gra-
dus, a former soloist with the
American Ballet Theatre. Its
members have toured across
Canada, the United States,
Mexico and Central South
America. This ballet not only
provided students with an inex-
pensive alternative for spending
a Wednesday night, but also
gave viewers a good insight into
the amazing world that dance
provides.

Coffeehouses give students

a break from studying

An old Pitt tradition from the
sixties is still continued with the
Coffeehouses. The Pitt Pro-
gram Council sponsors the
Coffeehouses, which are a part
of the fine entertainment on
campus. A variety of performers
come to the William Pitt Union
to display their talents to many
interested students.

Marc Garvin appeared on Sep-
tember 8, 1983 with his own
brand of unique entertainment.
On October 7th, Lee Robinson
and Iska presented a musical
jazz mixture that carried the au-
dience from rhythm and blues
to jazz to improvised music. The
Resident Student Association
entertained on October 13th.
The Core brought their musical
enthusiasm to Pitt’s campus on
October 21st. One of the Stu-
dent Talent Nights was held on
November 18th when a chance
was given for any hidden talent
of Pitt’s campus to come out and

perform singing, dancing, and
other creative entertainment.
The group Sandoz appeared on
November 21st to transport mu-
sic lovers back in time to the
sounds of the late sixties and
early seventies. Local entertain-
er Gary Vincent performed his
own style of contemporary and
blue grass music on February
17, 1984. Another Student Tal-
ent Night was held on February
21st, which was followed by a
similar event, Campus Come-
dians on March 8th, which spot-
lighted Pitt’s humorous talent.
The Greg Greenway band ap-
peared on April 2nd with a solo
act and then opened the last
Coffeehouse on April 3rd for
Livingston Taylor’s renowned
music talent.

Much quality and unique talent
is offered on nights filled with

pated in the tail gate parties
and the tug-of-war held prior
to the game. On April 1,
1984, the first warm day of
Spring, the Maulers beat
Oakland, 28-14, for their sec-
ond historical win.

Tuesday April 3, 1984 Pitt
held it’s first annual Deaf
Awareness Day. Guests were
given the chance to appreci-
ate the challenge that was-
presented to some students
when they came to Pitt. The
event was co-sponsered by
Pitt’s Sign Connection and
Disabled Student Services.
Representatives from many
organizations including the
Pennsylvania Society for the
Advancement of the Deaf,
Pittsburgh Deaf Theatre and
Open Doors for the Handi-
capped explained their ser-
vices to the people who at-
tended in the William Pitt
Union. Many songs were
performed by the group
“Beautiful Hands” in sign
language, which is made up
of students. As a class project
in a sign language course
here at Pitt Karen Walkney
established the group in
1980. She is presently Miss
Deaf Pennsylvania. “Break-
through” a similar group
also performed. Several
speakers presented better
ways to communicate with
the deaf, and the importance
of educating deaf children
and their parents. A Westing-
house representative dis-
played various telecommuni-
cation systems which help
deaf people to communicate.

 

In front ofa large crowd that
surprised everyone including
Rev. jessejackson, the Demo-
cratic presidential candidate
spoke in the Assembly Room
of the William Pitt Union on
Thursday April 5, 1984. The
crowd was not only students
but also professors and staff
who were free at 11:30 a.m.
to see the presidential candi-
date._]ackson gave his views
on the cuts made by Presi-
dent Reagan, like school
lunches, using an argument
that children who do not eat
properly fall asleep in class.
He went on further to say
that these children later drop
out of school, and many
times resort to a life of crime.
He then stated that four years
at a college is less expensive
than four years in jail. The
crowd was very impressed
with this 42 year old man
from South Carolina who is
the first black man to have
made it this far in a presiden-
tial election. Though jack-
son was the only Democratic
candidate to visit the cam-
pus, Sen. Gary Hart and Wal-
ter Mondale were in Pitts-
burgh on this same day. Car-
ole King, better known for
her singing, appeared at the
William Pitt Union for Hart.
Along with singing several
songs, she campaigned for
Gary Hart, the 47 year old
Senator from Colorado. All
three candidates participat-

 

ed in a debate on live TV that
evening from the David Law-
rence Convention Center.

As if required readings that ‘

were nowhere to be found
were not enough to battle,
students living in the Oak-
land area were subjected to

Pizza Wars. Those not on the ‘
front lines didn’t understand,

they thought having a pizza
delivered was easy —- just
call the place, tell them what
you want on it and it will be
delivered. If that was all
there was to it, students
would not have to waste
studying time with all the re-
quired decisions. These usu-
ally entailed going over the
Pitt News again and again.
The process usually needed
several students. They had to
find a pizza that was edible,
but still within their budgets.
The winner was the place
that was the cheapest, gave
free Pepsi with free cups, had
at least $1-off coupons and
had free delivery.

The wave of change rolled

' _ across the United States, too.

The American people entered a
‘year of firsts, lasts and of
course, changes and revisions.

1984 brought with it a new na-
tional holiday. This year Presi-
dent Reagan officially signed
January 15 in as Martin Luther
King Day, honoring the slain
civil rights leader. Rallies on col-
lege campuses, in Washington
and across the country exempli-
fied the strong feelings Ameri-
cans had in the desire to place
King with the likes of Columbus
and Washington.

1984 also brought the gathering
together of the world's greatest
athletes for the Olympics. The
winter games, held in Sarajevo,
Yugoslavia, showed the (_l.S. at
its best with a gold medal in
Men's Figure Skating (the first
in over two decades), two golds
in Men’s Skiing (the first ever)
and a Women’s Skiing gold as
well. The site of L.A., California
brings the summer games back
to the (_l.S. Four gold medals are
expected from track superstar
Carl Lewis, who has been li-
kened to the great Jesse
Owens.

It's never easy to say good-bye
but that is what we did when ole
Ma Bell broke up into ATST
and the Bell system, giving us
seven page phone bills and
choices between MCI and
Sprint. We also said farewell to
a male-dominated world of
space with our first women as-
tronaut, Sally Ride.

The primary purpose of the Air Force
ROTC is to provide the training neces-
sary for an individual to be commis-
sioned an officer in the United States Air
Force. The Air Force ROTC program
consists of two distinct phases — the
General Military Course (GMC) for
freshmen and sophomores, and the Pro-
fessional Officer Course (POC) for ju-
niors and seniors. As members of the
GMC, cadets take a one semester hour
academic course each term and weekly
participate in a one-hour Leadership
Laboratory. POC cadets have the same
Leadership Laboratory requirements;
however, the academic course is expand-
ed to three semester hours. During the
summer prior to entering the POC, ap-
plicants must attend a Field Training en-
campment at an Air Force base.

ROTC

Army

Army ROTC is a program that provides
college-trained officers for the U.S.
Army, the Army National Guard, and the
U.S. Army Reserve. ROTC enhances a
student’s education by providing unique
leadership and management experience.
It helps develop self-discipline, physical
stamina, and poise. Students develop
qualities basic to success in any worth-
while career.

The four-year Army ROTC program is
divided into two parts: the Basic Course
and the Advanced Course. The Basic
Course covers the areas of management
principles; national defense; military his-
tory; leadership development; and mili-
tary courtesy, discipline and customs.

   1984. An election year. With three
strong candidates, the campaigning is
fierce and the results interesting. With
the first strong black candidate in the
running, whatever the outcome is,'84
will probably be looked back on as a
turning point in politics.
   Walter (Fritz) Mondale, born in Minnesota in 1928, began his career in Humphrey's Senatorial campaign in 1940.
When Humphrey left his Senate position in 1965, Mondale took his seat.
Serving 12 years in the Senate, Mondale
built a liberal reputation on issues of
school busing and education. His campaign now stresses nuclear deploy.ment, increased education spending
and affirmative action on civil rights.
   Jesse Louis Jackson's political inter-,
ests were sparked in 1959 when he was
refused access to a public library in
South Carolina. The following year, he
participated in a sit-in at the library. He
was a part of M.L.K's Southern Christian Leadership Conference until 1971.
His campaign stresses rights for the under-privileged and disadvantaged. The
college students and black Americans
are the focal point of Jackson's "Rain,bow Coalition."
   Gary (you got to have) Hart worked as
 a volunteer in J.F.K.'s presidential carn paign of 1960. Later he served as assis tant to Interior Secretary Stewart Udall.
 Twice, in'74 and'80, he was elected
 Senator from Colorado. His campaign
 stresses education.

What kind of person would volunteer
for: 15 weeks of philosophy about the
University; 7 A.M. proctoring duty for
excruciating math tests; staying up all
hours with homesick freshmen; and,
working through the entire Labor Day
Weekend. An exceptional one, for sure.
Mentors are the university’s front line
against freshmen misconceptions and
anxieties. They’re the select group of up-
perclassmen who conduct the new stu-
dents through Advising Sessions, and
Orientation, that tricky minefield called
the start of college.

Entertainment was a major
force this year, with the word
“superstar” really being put to
use. Two people in particular
come to mind with the mention
of that word. Michael Jackson
and the Cabbage Patch Kid.

Much as Pac-Man fever swept
the country last year, this cre-
ation was every child’s vision at
Christmastime. It was some-
thing not even Phil Donahue
could not ignore, as he devoted
half a show to the craze. Re-
ports of Cabbage Patch Kids be-
ing held for ransom and riots in
stores were not uncommon.
Parents told stories of.waiting in
line for hours on end only to find
the store sold out before they
even opened. And what was so
special about these dolls? Could
it be that eachcame with its
own unique adoption papers?
Or was it their cute, scrunched
up faces? Who knows. But
someone isn't wondering, all
the way to the bank. '

Michael “megabucks" Jackson
certainly cemented his place in
music history this year. His al-
bum “Thriller” sold over 27 mil-
lion copies; five singles hitting
number one and one receiving a
Grammy for Song of the Year.
The million dollar video/mini
movie to the title song was a
cinematic triumph and a des-
tined trend-setter and classic.
The “Michael Jackson look,”
the one sequined glove -and
white socks and loafers became
“the" style. And his teaming up
with fellow superstar Paul
McCartney for another chart-

topping single was not to be for-
gotten. And speaking of forget-
ting, let's not forget Mr. Jack-
son’s affair with Pepsi and
Brooke. One set his hair on fire,
the other  well. A “record"
indeed.

Michael Jackson withstanding,
1984 was the year music came
out of the slumps. Newcomers
like Duran Duran, Culture Club
and Cyndi Lauper and old
standbys such as the Rolling
Stones, Van Halen and the Pre-
tenders pulled music out of the
doldrums. The new sound as

After going through 139 pages,
you’re probably wondering who
was responsible for putting this
book together. Well, here we
are. The 1984 Panther Prints
staff. Over 35 dedicated, hard-
working, imaginative individ-
uals working together to record
the events of the year.

Production for the book is a 13
month process, beginning in
July 83 and ending in August of
84 when the final set of proofs
are returned to the publisher.

In keeping with our theme, Revi-
sions, many changes occured in
the yearbook. This year's book
has increased its dimensions to
9 x 12 and increased the num-
ber of pages to 336. We added a
new section, academics, tried a
new 4-column layout style, and
began the year with a complete-
ly new staff.

Like most revisions, this is only
the beginning. Next year’s book
will continue to change in style
and content.

well as the new look, otherwise
known as MTV, made it a year
of welcome musical revision.

in the humor department, Eddie
Murphy and Joan Rivers
reigned supreme. Eddie's break
into the big screen with both
‘.48 Hours" and “Trading
Places" as well as his HBO spe-
cial “Delirious" brought back
the kind of hard-hitting, biting
humor you’re almost,. but not
quite, afraid to laugh at. And
Joan Rivers’ “can we talk?”
sums her up for the lady who
hits everyone and everything in
her routines.

lf perchance our spare time led

‘us into the theater, we were in-

deed well-rewarded. “Staying
Alive,” “The Right Stuff",
“Footloose" and “Terms of En-
dearment” were some of the
biggest hits of the year. it seems
the big difference in the cinema
this year was the move back to
actual people rather than alien
creatures and machines.

On the smaller screen, T.V.
brought us a monumental
work. “The Day After” drama-
tized a nuclear attack in a myth-
ical American city. The fact
that prime time television made
a 2-hour movie out of this topic
emphasized the imminent nu-
clear threat felt.

The Government Relations Committee
(GRC) acts as a liaison between Pitt stu-
dents and government officials at the 10-
cal, state, and national level. They also
inform students of legislation which
could directly affect their lives as college
students.

This year GRC held their annual Voter
Registration Drive. According to Con-
nie Kreischer, committee chairperson,
the drive is one of the major functions, if
not the most important, sponsored by
GRC.

“It is really important that students vote
because that’s the only way we (stu-
dents) can influence our legislators,”
said Kreischer. “Not enough students
vote, and that’s too bad.”

According to Kreischer there is not a
very good representation of students at
the polls. The major objective of the
drive is to make students aware of the
issue at hand, or creating a better turn
out at the polls.

Government Relations Committee

The Student Relations Committee strives to
inform students about Student Government
and to encourage participation in all areas
of campus activities.

They publish the Student Organization
booklet which lists all groups recognized
by the Student Government Board. The
booklet is a useful guide to help incoming
freshmen choose which organization they
might want to join.

 

In November, they launched their second
annual charity drive for Children’s Hospi-
tal. To collect the money, they sold red and
green paper links which formed a giant
chain that hung in the admittance lobby at

Student Government Board

Allocations Committee

 

The representative body of undergrad-
uate students is the Student Government
Board (SGB). It is composed of nine
elected members, eight Board members
and a President. The elections, which
are open to all full time, non-CGS stu-
dents, were held in November. The
elected members began a one-year term
beginning in January.

Because it is elected, the Board is recog-
nized by the University Administration
and faculty as the official representative
of full-time non-CGS undergraduate
needs and ideas. Student input is vital
when administrators and faculty mem-
bers contemplate decisions affecting stu-
dents. This input is realized through the
SGB. Members serve on such advisory
bodies as Student Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee, Senate Council and University
Senate.

The Student Government Board exists to
serve the students. Each term every stu-
dent pays a Student Activities Fee. The
Board has the final word on how this
money is spent to benefit as many stu-
dents as possible.

The Allocations Committee is a vital
part of Student Government. The com-
mittee interviews groups of students
seeking to be recognized as official orga-
nizations. They make their recommen-
dations to the Board concerning the sta-
tus and privileges extended to student or-
ganizations. Members conduct an annual
review of recognized student organiza-
tions before budget interviews in the

spring.

While the renovation of Schenley Hall was
one ofthe most talked about projects during
the past school year, it was not the only
aspect of the Pitt campus that underwent a
facelift. The Pitt News also underwent recon-
struction with changes in both style and
staff.

Last December, after the appointment of
new editors, The Pitt News changed its style,
using new techniques in layout, design and
graphics. The staff was assisted by Bruce
Baumann, Marty Smith, and Jerry Byrd of
the Pittsburgh Press. Baumann was responsi~
ble for the new look ofthe Press. During this
time, the staff of writers nearly doubled.

The Lady Panthers had a very good season
compiling a total record of 16-12. Within
the Big East conference they had seven wins
and only three losses but one of those losses
came from Seton Hall in the first round of
the Big East Championships.

At home the team was close to being invin-
cible. They won all four of their conference
home games and finished with an overall
home record of 11-5. The road games were
not very kind to the Lady Pantbers as all of
their conference losses were away games
and they finished with a 4-6 away game re-

Captain Jennifer Bruce had another out-
standing year for Pitt. After being named
Big East Pre-Season Player of the Year she
went on to prove she deserved the honor.
She averaged 23.8 points a game, first in the
Big East. She also averaged 9.4 rebounds a
game and had a shooting percentage of
.515. With statistics like these it’s no won-
der that she was named All-American. With
Bruce and all of the other girls returning,
next year should be even better.

There are some things that"

comes to mind. For, example,
the fountain; what do you visu-

whatever 'memory that you

come up with! How about Mar-

ket Sqpare? Do you see hungry

Burger King take-out? ‘Jenkin's
Arcade is another example. It
never seemed to be out of your
way to casually stroll through it
while in ‘town on a shopping

taking different buses into
town. It wasn’t like a shopping

new memories to treasure!

Season of
Ups &

Downs

The 1983-84 basketball season was off to
a good start. In the pre-season Pitt lost only
one game and that was to West Virginia in
Morgantown. The Panthers won the other
eight games and the Golden Triangle Clas-
SIC.

In the Classic Pitt was paired against
Crosstown rival, the Duquesne Dukes. Pitt
defeated the Dukes and made it to the finals
where they faced Illinois State. The Pan-
thers surprised many as they downed Illi-
nois State and were crowned champions of
the tournament. Then the Big East season
began.

Once again the Panthers fought hard but
came up short more often than not. Pitt lost
their first three conference games but then
seemed to be coming alive. Once again they
downed the Dukes, the second time this sea-
son. Then Pitt beat visiting St.john’s for the
second year in a row. The team traveled to
Madison Square Garden and had their third
consecutive win crushing Seton Hall.

Syracuse broke Pitt's string of three wins
with the score of 66-65, then the mighty
Hoyas of Georgetown, the eventual NCAA
champion, came to the Field House. The
Panther’s kept the game close but the depth
of Georgetown’s bench was too much for
Pitt as they lost 63-52.

The team went on to beat Conneticut
the road and their last three Big East home
games including an exciting game against
Villanova. This was the same team that beat
them in the first round of the Big East Tour-
nament. Pitt finished with a record of 18-13.

Clyde

Clyde Vaughan — four years ago he came to
Pitt as our top recruit. Since then he has
proved that he deserved that honor, and
more. During his first two seasons as a Pan-
ther he helped carry Pitt to the champion-
ship of the Eastern Eight Tournament.
Then, prior to Vaughan’s junior year Pitt
entered the prestigious Big East Confer-
ence. A big transition needed to be made
and Clyde made it with ease. As a team,
there would be no conference champion-
ship but Clyde stepped in and promptly won
the Big East scoring title in Pitt’s first year
of competition with a total of 613 points for
an average of 21.9 per game.

This season hopes were high for the team
and Clyde Vaughan. Again Vaughan re-
sponded with outstanding games including
a 37-point performance against Boston Col-
lege. By season’s end Clyde had become
Pitt’s all-time leading scorer and the first
player in Pitt history to score over 2,000
points. Clyde’s total was 2,012. Clyde
passed Larry Harris’ old record mark in the
Big East Tournament against Villanova.

180 Men’s Basketball

Vaughan — Someone Special

Pitt lost that game but received an invitation
to the NIT. The Panthers advanced to the
quarterfinals giving the Pitt fans one last
chance to watch Vaughan at work.
Vaughan scored his 2000th career point in
this game but Pitt lost to Notre Dame
bringing Clyde Vaughan's Pitt career to an
end, but what a career it was.

When we look back on recent basketball
seasons we will remember Clyde’s fade
away jumper, we will remember him outre-
bounding an opposing player inches taller
than him, and we will remember that Clyde
always played his hardest. Vaughan only
knew how to give one thing and that was his
all — it did not matter that he had a bad
back in a 1982 game against Duquesne,
Clyde still played. And this season, even
though he had sprained his ankle earlier in
the week Vaughan had no plans of sitting
out the opening game of the Golden Trian-
gle Classic. In that game he scored 23
points. We will look back and remember,
and we’ll smile.

It’s
Tournament
Time

The Big East Championships,
held in Madison Square Gar-
den, were a big disappointment
for both Pitt teams. The Lady
Panthers lost in the opening
round to Seton Hall and the
men’s team fell to Villanova in
the first round. The men were
later asked to the National Invi-
tational Tournament and their
second season began.

The team had a poor record in

the conference but were deter-
mined to end the season on an

182 Big East/l‘i.l.T.

 

upbeat note. Their first game
matched them against LaSalle
and the Pitt team notched their
first upset with a score of 95-91.
Florida State was a formidable
second round opponent but Pitt
had already beaten this team in
the pre-season. They beat them
again, 66-63.

Having scored two upsets on the
road, the third game came to the
Field House with Pitt hosting
Notre Dame. This, too, was a
team Pitt had already beaten but
the Irish were not about to let it
happen again. The Irish defeat-
ed Pitt, 72-64. This marked the
last game for Billy Culbertson,
Clyde Vaughan, and Steve Beat-
ty. They almost ended their ca-
reers with an appearance in the
N.I.T. final, but the quarterfi-
nals weren’t a bad finish either.

Big East/N.l.T. 183

 

Every four years the best athletes in the
world gather for the Olympic games. Out of
millions of people only a few are selected to
compete in each event. This year there are
four Pitt students who may receive this hon-
or, the honor of being grouped under the
world's elite.

The one who has the best chance of winning
amedalisRogerKingdom.Whilecompeting
for the Panther track team last year he won
the 110-meter hurdles. This prompted the
U.S. track committee to place him on the
Pan-Am team. There he won the gold med-
al. This year he won the NCAA title in the
55-meter hurdles, but it is in the 100-meter
hurdles he is expected to win at Los Ange-
les. Kingdom is also training for the 1988
Olympic decathlon.

Clyde Vaughan, Pitt basketball standout,
has the opportunity to play for Great Brit-
ain. He is now an American citizen but he
has not been one long enough to qualify him
for the U.S. team.

Two swimmers have a chance to make the
team. They are Susan Hickman, a freshman
on the Pitt swim team, and Sue Heon who
took the year off to concentrate all her ef-
forts on making the team. They face some
tough competition but to have made it this
far is quite an honor.

Bizarre finishes. Those two

words describe Pitt’s 1985 foot- _

ball season. Four games were
decided late in the fourth quar-
ter. Of those four games Pitt
won one, lost two, and tied one.
It was those four games that
smeared Pitt’s record but, at
season’s end, the Panther’s were
champions in their own eyes, if
not everyone’s.

The season started quite differ-
ently than last year. They weren’t
the preseason number one team;
they were one predicted to go 4-
7. People criticized their lack of
team spirit, saying everyone
played for themselves. Having
lost thirteen starters to gradu-
ation, including quarterback
Dan Marina, the team knew
they would have to play togeth-
er to win and they did. It was
this team unity that carried
them into the Top Twenty a
post-season bowl game, and
prompted Pete Axthelm to say,
"They are one of the best teams
in the country."

The team opened at Tennessee,
a team picked by Sports Illus-
trated to be the national
champs. These expectations

quickly faded as the Panthers
won 13-5. But in the game’s last-
play, quarterback john Cum-
mings suffered a broken collar-
bone putting another obstacle
in the way for the Pitt team.

In the home opener against
Temple, Pitt put another mark
in the win column with an easy
35-0 romp of the Owls. john
Congemi stepped in for the in-
jured Cummings and proved he
was the quarterback of the fu-
ture as he passed for 171 yards.

At Maryland the following
week the bizarre finishes began.
With the clock ticking away, the
Panther’s tried desperately to
score and almost did. On the 11
yard line with 1:14 left, a pit-
chout resulted in a fumble and
the game ended in a 13-7 loss.

West Virginia the following
week proved no better. A rowdy
crowd who hadn’t seen their
team beat Pitt since 1975 made
enough noise to hinder the Pan-
ther offense. Even with this
handicap Pitt led 21-17 late in
the game. Again, a late touch-
down was scored that caused

continued

Football 187

the Panthers to lose their sec-
ond consecutive game.

At home against Florida State it
looked like another loss as the
Seminoles scored on their first
two possessions. But, behind the
support of a soldout home
crowd the team rallied to score
two touchdowns and a field
goal to win 17-16. After the
game Coach Fazio credited the
win to the crowd who gave “the
inspiration and lift” they need-
ed to win.

Game 6, Louisville provided
Pitt with a breather after three
tough games. An aggressive Pitt
defense forced four fumbles had
two interceptions, and blocked
a punt to lead the Panthers to a
55-10 win. Dwight Collins had
two receptions which tied him
withjulius Dawkins as Pitt’s all-
time reception leader.

Navy, behind the running ofthe
nation’s leading rusher, Napo-
leon McCallum, put up quite a
fight. The Panthers, deter-
mined not to lose at home,
pulled out a 21-14 win on a
game-winning 39 yard touch-
down pass from Congemi to
Wallace.

Bizarre finish number three
came against Syracuse before :1
Homecoming crowd. With a
score of 10-10 late in the 4th
quarter the Panthers were driv-
ing for a touchdown. An inter-
ception of a Congemi pass with
30 seconds remaining seemed to
spell tie, but Troy Benson saw
otherwise as he intercepted an
Orangeman pass. With seven
seconds on the clock, on walked
#2 to try the crucial field goal.
Everyone in the stands was flip-
ping through his programs
asking, "Who is he?” But as the
ball was kicked he made sure
everyone would know his name.
In his first attempt in a Panther
uniform, walk-on Pat Viancourt
scored the game-winning three
points. Minutes later the goal
post came crashing down as the
crowd celebrated what may
have been the most exciting

Homecoming game ever.

The celebrating continued the
following week against the
Fighting Irish. Joe McCall be-
came the first back to gain more
than 100 yards against Notre
Dame this year as he piled up
116 yards, and the Pitt defense
held Allen Pinkett to 82 yards
snapping his consecutive 100
yards games at five. On national
television Pitt dominated the
Irish and coasted to a 21-16 win.

Back at home against Army, the
Panthers cruised to a 38-7 win.
joe McCall ran for 246 yards
putting him in the Pitt record
book with the fifth-best single
rushing game ever. But this easy
win was marred by the injury to
Tom Flynn with the Penn State
game only seven days away.

The last game of the regular sea-
son in front of a capacity-plus
home crowd was bizarre finish
number four. The Pitt-Penn
State rivalry was further en-
hanced by Joe Paterno’s state-
ment to the press describing
Pitt's win over Notre Dame as a
fluke! The Panthers were going
to prove otherwise as they total-
ly dominated the game. (Re-
member the last game they
dominated?) The Pitt offense
gained 469 yards to Penn State’s
281. Pitt had 86 offensive plays
to Penn State’s S2, and two of
Penn State’s touchdowns came
from Pitt fumbles in the 10 yard
line. With a score a 24-21 and
no time left on the stadium
clock the celebrating began.
But the announcer came over
the P.A. system saying, “the
game is not over.” A second
look at the clock shows again
no time remaining. Penn State
kicked what appeared to be a no
time remaining field goal end-

ing the game, for a second time,
with a 24-24 tie. Later the refer-
ees said the clock continued to
run during a penalty which gave
Penn State the precious six sec-
onds to kick the field goal. This,
Joe, is a real fluke! After the
game Coach Fazio and the sen-
iors accepted a bid to play in the
Fiesta Bowl January 2. against
Ohio State. The Fiesta Bowl re-
presentative claimed he still had
the best team in the east.

At first look the season may ap-
pear to be a failure with a 8-2-1
record but looking again you
see a team of real champions.
This was a team predicted by
some to go 4-7. Erase just min-
utes off this season and you have
an undefeated team. This team
overcame all obstacles, never
quit, and stuck together to the
very end. A team described by
senior Tom Flynn as, “the best
team I ever played on.” This
was a team of true champions.
They came so close but, oh,
those bizarre finishes.

lins, but Pitt failed to convert on the two-
point play so Ohio State still had a one point
lead.

The Panthers last points came from Snuffy
Everett who, with only two minutes remain-
ing, kicked a 37-yard field goal to put Pitt
ahead for the first time in the game, 23-21.
Ohio State had other ideas though, and with
only 39 seconds left scored on a 39-yard
touchdown play. But Pitt kept on fighting
and made it to the Ohio State 24. Congemi
went out of the game injured and in came
Chrisjelic. His first pass was thrown out of
bounds and then with only seconds remain-
ing his second pass was deflected and fell
incomplete. The game ended 28-23. So
close, yet so far.

Winning Season

The Lady Panthers had an ex-
ceptional year finishing with a
7-4 record and a NCAA North-
eastern Regional runner-up ti-
tle.

The team faced a tough sched-
ule this year that included meets
at Georgia and Florida, both
ranked in the Top 10 in the na-
tion last year. Other tough
teams they faced were New
Hampshire, Penn State, and
West Virginia who were ranked

194 Sports/Women’s Gymnastics

second, third, and fourth in the
region last year.

Pitt’s biggest win this year was
their victory over Penn State,
the first time Pitt had ever beat-
en them. Senior Lisa Shirk cap-
tured the all-around title to help
lead her team to victory. Shirk
was invited to the NCAA cham-
pionship at the end of the sea-
son and was, again, named an
All-American.

UNIVERSITY
OF PITTSBURGH

LIBRARIES

CAMPUS

_ If there is one thing that could

sum up the renovations and re-
visions in the Oakland area, it is
the new William Pitt Student
Union. Officially opened Sep-
tember 8, it stands as a proud
example of the growth that the
University of Pittsburgh is un-
dergoing.

Many of the restorations in the
building were in conjunction
with the appearance of the Stu-
dent Union before. Before,
when it was the grand and luxu-
rious Schenley Hotel; a gather-
ing place for the socially elite
and the “beautiful people", like
Lillian Russell, “Diamond Jim"
Brady and President Theodore
Roosevelt. The grand ballroom
was restored to its original ele-
gance in a Louis XV design. The
parlour of Lillian Russel now
stands as it did when she re-
sided at the Schenley Hotel.
The archwork throughout the
new Student Union acts as a
symbol of the new building as
well as truly topping off the
combination of the old with the
new.

And how impressive are those
new designs. The lower level,
which was the old basement,
now houses a T.V. room in
which the Pitt Program Council
presents videos, a game room
with 13 pool tables and video
games and a cafeteria large and
spacious enough to seat 200
people.

Upstairs on the main level, one

finds the multi-purpose room .

At the beginning of the season
Coach Frank D’Amico said he
felt he had his strongest team
ever and coming off a 12-4 sea-
son that said a lot. The Panthers
didn’t let their coach down as
they improved their record to
finish at 15-3. One of those
losses came from arch rival
Penn State. Coach D’Amico
feels as soon as Pitt beats them it
will put them over the hump and
bring the team the national
prominence they deserve. The
Panthers lost to Penn State by
only 11.70 points so they are
very close to this national rec-
ognition. Senior Frank Kratz,
an All-East performer last year,
completed his career by being
invited to compete in the NCAA
championship in California.

Faces

The 1983 season was one of new
faces. Coach Leo Bemis in his
last year as head coach brought
in what he called his best re-
cruiting class ever. There were
sixteen new faces on the Pan-
ther team this year and with all
these freshmen the Panthers
still improved their record from
the previous year to finish at 9-
10-1.

The team opened against
George Mason, a national con-
tender, and continued to play
strong teams throughout the
season. The youth and inexperi-
ence may have cost the Panthers
a few games this year but next
year they should be stronger yet.
With former Panther soccer
greatjoe Luxbacher taking over
for Coach Bemis the soccer
team should continue to grow
until they win a national title.

The Year 

of the Freshmen

The Lady Panthers entered the
1983-1984 season as the reign-
ing Big East champ. The ladies
liked the feeling so much that
they will enter next season as
the champions again.

Coach David Belowich faced
the start of the 1983-84 season
without Sue Heon who took the
year off to train for the Olym-
pics. But Belowich used the Big
East championship to recruit
some new outstanding talent
such as Tracy Pfister, Stacy
Moller, jodi O’Neil, Patricia
Ney, and Susan Hickman.

The season saw the ladies com-
pile a record of 6-2. The season
was only preparation for the
Big East Championships
though, where the swimmers
jumped to an early lead over

second place Syracuse.

Susan Hickman set new meet re-
cords in the 50-yard freestyle,
200 medley, and 200 freestyle
relays. Ney was runner-up in the
1-meter diving and qualified for
the NCAA on both the 1 and 3
meter boards. Tracy Pfister set
a Big East record in the 200 I.M.
and was on the record setting
200 medley team. Pfister also
finished second in the 100 but-
terfly. At the end of the meet

Pfister was named the winner of .

the outstanding swimmer
award.

The performance ofthese fresh-
men and the return of Sue Heon
ensure a strong Pitt team for de-
fending their title next year, and
the year after, and . . .

(seating capacity — 700) which
is used for lectures, small con-
certs, dances, movies, and ban-
quets.

Perhaps, though, since it is the
official Student Union, the of-
fices on the rest of the floors are
the most welcome change.
Most all student organizations
now can be found here com-
plete with a real office in the Pitt
Student Union. The offices are
big and numerous enough so
that the University groups can
all quite adequately function
from them. The simple fact that
Pitt’s student organizations are
now altogether in the newly
opened Union is the impressive

 

work of promising changes that p

are now occuring between the
administration and the stu-
dents.

When the Schenley was sold to
Pitt in 1956 for use as a Student
Union, few dreamed that 1984
would bring its grand reopening
at the cost of 13 million dollars,
designed by the architectural
firm of Williams, Treblicock and
Whitehead. What a welcome re-
vision and addition the new Stu-
dent Union is, standing as a
symbol of Pitt's true entrance
into the 1980’s.

  One More Time —

Big East Champions Again

Entering a season as defending
champions can put much pres-
sure on a team. But Pitt used this
pressure to help lead them to a
second consecutive Big East
championship and the Eastern
Intercollegiate championship.

During the season the team lost
only one meet and won the oth-
er six. They entered the Big East
championship as the clear cut
favorite and disappointed no
one as they finished 1081/2
points ahead of Syracuse who
finished second.

The start of the meet was the
diving competition. When the
awards for the three-meter
event were given out it was a
foreshadowing of what was to
come as Pitt won four ofthe five
possible medals. The Panthers
also finished the same way in
the one-meter diving.

Ed Bahen won the gold medal in
the 50 and the 100 yard freestyle
and was also a member of the
record setting 400 and 800
freestyle relay teams. Later in
the meet Bahen finished second
in the 200 yard freestyle. But
that didn’t disappoint him be-
cause the number one finisher
was teammate Greg Murphy.
The third and fourth place fin-
ishers were also Pitt team mem-
bers. Murphy was later named
winner of the Outstanding
Swimmer award. Fred Lewis
was named coach of the year.

After winning the Big East and
Eastern Intercollegiate cham-
pionships the team seems as-
sured of a great recruiting year.
With all the talent they already
have it hardly seems fair. Then
again, all’s fair in love and war
so let Pitt’s war with the Big
East rage on.

A Good Start

The 1983 tennis season was off
to a good start for the Lady Pan-
thers. The team won its first two
matches, against Carnegie-Me1-
ion and Robert Morris, but then
inexperience took its toll. The
team consisted mainly of fresh-
men and sophomores and had
only one senior, jodi Mattioli.
Despite finishing the season
with a 4-7 record coach George

Dieffenbach was very pleased
with his squad.

The Lady Panthers finished rat-
ed ninth overall in the Big East
Championships. Rhonda Gibbs,
in her first season on the team,
advanced to the semi-final
round in the Big East singles
tournament becoming the first
Pitt woman to ever do so.

Lobbing to a .50 Seaso

The Men’s Tennis Team began
their season in early March and
looked ahead to facing some
very tough, competitive matches
since more than half of their op-
ponents were Division I
schools. The men felt that the
success of their season could be
measured by whether or not
they finished above or below
.500.

Early April brought Pitt two
home matches in one day. In the
morning the Panthers met and
defeated St. Vincent’s College.
Later, in the afternoon Pitt won
its second match of the day over
CMU. These victories brought
the season record to 7-7. Pitt
split its final two matches to fin-
ish with the 500 record and suc-
cessful season they aimed for.

In or Out,
the TrackTeams

The Men’s Track team opened
the indoor season in a meet with
Slippery Rock and Robert Mor-
ris. Pitt used this meet for timed
trials. The true test for the run-
ners came at the Big East In-
door Championships and at the
NCAA meet. At the Big East the
men came in third as Garland
Brown was named the outstand-
ing track performer at the meet.
Roger Kingdom won his sec-
ond NCAA title at the indoor
track and field meet. He was
victorious in the 55-meter hur-
dles with a time of 7.08 seconds.
Todd Colas earned All-Amer-
ica honors at this same meet by
placing sixth in the 1,000-meter
run.

When the outdoor season began
Roger Kingdom was not a
member of the Pitt team. He
chose to run independently

were Fleet of Foot

since he was training for a spot
on the Olympic team. Without
him, the track team continued
to perform and achieve as two
members qualified for the
NCAAS. Garland Brown par-
ticipated in the 800-meter run
and Darryl Shepherd competed
in the 110-meter high hurdles.

The women’s track team was
also enjoying a productive year.
Although the team is made up of
a small group they had a good
showing at the WVU Invita-
tional. The ladies won three
events — Edith Butler won the
400-meter dash, Renee Hender-
son won the 300-meter dash,
and the 1600-meter relay team
was also victorious. Renee Hen-
derson qualfified for the nation-
als in the 55-meter dash. The
team finished sixth at the indoor
Big East Championships.

CAMPUS

A walk around the Pitt campus
anddrivethroughthe’Burgh will
undoubtedly reek of changes
and revisions. Probably the big-
gestldifference seen is that of
the newly remodeled and ren-
ovated William Pitt Student
Union. What can be said about
this new “addition" to Pitt that
hasn't already been said? It is a
beautiful, much needed gather-
ing place for the Pitt student
body and the general public.
And a prime example of Pitt's
entrance into the '80's.

 

Greeks are a major part of Pitt.
Their annual Greek Week char-
ity fundraising efforts and blood
donations to the Central Blood
Bank are two of the many ac-
tivities they engage in. This
year, a new fraternity complex
underwent construction, which
will be ready to house 8 fraterni-
ties come fall. This move to the
hill will surely have an effect on
the Greek system here at Pitt.
Hopefully, the change will not
cause an Amherst College out-
come.

Other “new-ities” to Pitt were

As the 1983 Volleyball season
got under way the Lady Pan-
thers were the defending Big
East Champions. With four re-
turning starters they were look-
ing forward to repeating that
goal, and they were looking be-
yond the Big East. The women
played a tough schedule that
featured many volleyball
powerhouses including Florida
State whom the Lady Panthers
defeated in September. Then, in
the last regular season match
Pitt met Penn State for the sec-
ond time. Pitt lost this match at
University Park in four games.
The one game of the match that
they won was a marathon with
the final score being 21-19.

With the match loss the team en-
tered the Big East Champion-

220 Sports/Volleyball

ships with a record of 27-10
which was good enough for first
place in the Big East Conference
standings. But that was not
enough for the ladies. They
wanted to repeat as Big East
Champions and go on to the
NCAA Tournament and put in a
good showing there. However,
their dreams would not come
true. After four matches at the
championships Pitt had defeat-
ed Boston College, Seton Hall,
Villanova, and in the semi-fin-
als, Syracuse. This set up the fi-
nal between Providence and
Pitt. Pitt lost this match and
their title 19-17, 15-7,15—10.So
the Lady Panthers’ season came
to an end — as Big East runner-
up and with a successful record
of 31 wins and 11 losses.

Good Start,
But . . .

Coming off a winning season with ten re-
turning starters, things looked good for the
Panthers. The team started off with wins
against Youngstown State and Lehigh but
then things went sour. A tough schedule
which included matches at Penn State and
Cleveland State with Clarion at home
proved too tough for Pitt as they lost all
three. The team finished with a 5-12 record.

The season did have some bright spots
though, as jeffjelic became Pitt’s All-Time

(what exactly a “tuck shop” is,
will probably remain one of the
biggest mysteries of the world).

On through the streets of Pitts-

change in the Pittsburgh sky-

new buildings: the PPG Place,
an office and shopping com-
plex, the National Steel Build-
ing, the One Mellon Bank Cen-
ter and Oxford Center, another
combined office and shops
area. The ’Burgh could also
boast its own LISFL team, the

al cheerleading squad, the _

A city and a University on the
move. As Pitt enters into a con-
tract with ATST to make it “the

of the most advanced commu-.

during what has been called Re-

be felt everywhere. Revisions at
their best.

The University of Pittsburgh is
a city college, located in the
heart of Oakland. The students
receive a mixed atmosphere --

- , Schenley and Frick parks are

within 1 mile of the campus.
Downtown Pittsburgh, Shady-
sideshops, and Monroeville

.Malla're just a bus ride away.
, But if you jog or like to take long

walks, there are many paths.
through the countryside parks.

The buildings around campus
have been built and named to
honor many original Oak-A
landers; lf-you like a very quiet

place to study, the Frick Fine

ArtsBuilding library is an excel-
lent choice. Or, if you likevto
socialize a little bit more, Hill-
man Library is always jumping.
It is also a nice place to scope
the opposite sex. i

C * The Litchfield Towers, conve-
-niently named A, B, and C, were

built to house more of Pitt’s resi-

‘dents. They are round dormi-

tories cut into pie-shaped
pieces. The towers are co-ed by
floor and have been‘ known to
be a little wild. Many pranks are
played among the roomies —
water battles, smoke bombs,
and disappearing articles.

There are also many sites to see
in the Oakland area. Phipp’s
Conservatory is approximately
three blocks from'the dorms.
Their spring and fall flower
shows are a treat-for the whole
family. Carnegie Museum is a
loaded source of knowledge. lt

provides a break from studying
on a Saturday afternoon, when
students are admitted free.

One of the more modern build-
ings towering Pitt campus is the
Chemistry Building. Located up
behind the Syria Mosque, many
students have spent time there,
completing required experi-
ments.

they lead.

Speak Out

Fall, 1983, marked the much-awaited open-
ing of the newly renovated Student Union.
Also, all over campus new buildings were
being erected or renovated such as Mervis,
Pitt Stadium, parking lots, and the fraterni-
ty complexes. Soon before graduation sen-
iors were asked to give their thoughts on
the remodeling and on impressions of Pitt
in general. Here are some of their special
thoughts.

— I think Pitt is an excellent university. Its
big city location gives one the opportunity
to grow in independence and responsibil-
ity, while the dorms and myriad meeting-
places around campus give the chance for
long-lasting friendships and memories to
be built.

— Pitt provides students with the ability to
develop pride in their profession.

— I leave Pitt with a genuine feeling of
pride for my university. I know I made the
right decision four years ago.

—- The game’s over now. Beam me up
Scotty; there’s no intelligent life here.

—— I came here with ten grand and a sense of
humor. I’m leaving with nothing but two
pieces of paper.

—- I have gained more than an education —
I've gained an international perspective.

-— Pitt is like a toothache that I’ve had for
four years — it hurt, I got used to it and I
can’t wait to end it.

—— Reality is no longer hypothetical.

— It (the renovations) means progress to
me.

— I think it speaks very favorably of the
University of Pittsburgh — that they have
enough pride to be concerned about its ap-
pearance.

— The projects show planning and creativ-

ity.

-—- The renovations add a certain amount of
class to the campus and shows that a univer-
sity doesn’t have to be a stark environment.
I only hope that the Student Union and Mer-
vis will stay clean and unaffected by vandal-
ism in the future.

— Student Union is just great — it makes
you feel that the University officials agree
that the students deserve the very best in all
phases of education and comfort.

—- Good improvement — we now have a
taste of the past and of the future.

—— Mervis sure makes an architectural state-
ment nestled at the one end of campus sur-
rounded by Gothic structures, Neo-Classic,
and itself a mirrored jewel box reflecting
these grand dames of architecture.

— Of course I have mixed emotions about
leaving Pitt — the parties, the football
games, the final exams . . . No, one can ever
“really” leave Pitt.

STUDENTS

Wake up —— class in half an
hour!!! Roll into the shower and
hope no one steals your towel.
Throw on some sweats, “ten-
nies" and a shirt, if you can find
a clean one that is. Head on
downstairs, grab a candy bar for
breakfast and over to Langley
for that 9:30 psych class. And
of course, it’s raining and you
are once again without an um-
brella. Such is life?

Psych — well, you got yourself
here, that should be enough.
So, let’s take a snooze in the
back of the room. The professor
will never know. First, though,
how about a letter to Mom 8
Dad for some extra bucks for
um . . . books — yeah, sounds
good. Good grief, was I snor-
ing??? Oh well, 11:00 time to
eat.

Down to the good ole Towers
cafeteria —— well, ole ‘anyway.
Ah  a Towers specialty —
cheeseburgers and fries. l’ll
take two. And let's not pass up
some delicious pie. Find a seat,
hey there's a BOOTH, and blab
about last night at Peter’s and

22 Introduction/Student Life

the frat parties tonight. Sounds
great.

Check out the Pitt News and the
mail situation. None. Upstairs
then. Brush the teeth, open a
book, turn on the radio, lay
down with the book and . . . fall
asleep.

3:00. Time to run some errands.
Class — guess we missed a few.
To the Student Union, get some
change to do laundry and get
the campus bus up to Trees to
do some lifting.

Time to eat again. What delica-
cy will be served this evening?
There's always ice-cream. And
we can always look forward to
the Holiday dinners.

And so the day goes, more or
less, in the life of a Towers resi-
dent. And basically, for any resi-
dent of Holland, McCormick,
Bruce, Lothrop, Forbes, Brack-
enridge or Amos. Most spend
some time every day in at least
three places: Hillman, the caf
and the dorm room. Every now

and then, one makes a trip to

Picture

This

There are certain things in our college life
that we all look forward to — of course up
there in a class all by itself is the diploma
and the rewards that go with it. But along

the way things occur that remind us that our
ultimate goal is approaching. It seemed so
far away at freshmen orientation but as we
began registering for upper level courses
we knew the time was nearing. Then, final-
ly, it was our senior year. We began inter-

views, bought our class rings, registered for
graduation, ordered our cap and gown, and
along the way we had our senior portrait
taken.

The actual photographic session may have
taken only fifteen minutes but the prepara-
tion took much longer. Choosing the right
thing to wear was no easy task and once
there we had to make sure our hair was neat
and that our outfit had survived the snow-
storm — “I had two weeks to choose from
for an appointment, so why did I have to
choose the day it snowed?” some thought.
And when these obstacles had been hurdled
there were forms to fill out and long waits
to endure when the photographers ran be-
hind schedule. At last it came time to be

photographed. Following the photogra-
pher’s instructions we stood, then sat; we
tilted our head one way, then another; we
smiled, then did a serious pose; then we
were finished. We gathered our things and
went off to class. The person being shot by
the other photographer we will probably
never see again. In most cases the people
next to us in this book are strangers. But, we
all share one thing — we have made it; we
have earned our college degree.

For this, we salute Pitt’s Class of 1984.

STUDENTS

Everyone has time between
classes, an hour here or there.

Well, what do you do with this .

extra time? Are you one of
those people who goes to the
Student Union to play poo|‘or

socialize with your friends? Or

do yougo to try and study?

These extra hours provide time
to either prepare for your next
class, or get ahead in your last
one. if you would study during
this time, you wouldn’t have
much work to do at night. it
would give you more free time
in the evening.

In the spring time and early fall,
one can find many of Pitt's stu—
dents sitting on the Cathedral
lawn studying, or socializing.
Many of the residents like to
layout and try to catch some
rays. Some of the students sit

around and talk with their‘

friends. The nice weather per-
mits them to be outside in the
sunshine, not inside an air-con-
ditioned room. I

If you ever get tired of studying
outside, you can always take a
short nap. The nice lawns

around Pitt allow ‘people to lie,

down and sleep.

24 Introduction / Student Life

In the winter time, it isdifficult
to go outside and sleep, or
study. It is just« too cold. 80,
what do the students do during
the long winter months?

Well, some students like tolbu'n-

dle up and take long, romantic , ,

walks down the streets of Oak
land. Most of the students go
either inside the Cathedral or a

« library and talk with their

friends or study. No matter
what the weather, Pitt students
always find something to do
with their time — besides

GREEK WEEK

Greek Week is the special time
of year dedicated to the sorori-
ties and fraternities of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Greek
Week can be most accurately
described as the ultimate cele-
bration of Greeklife at Pitt.
Each year the entire Greek sys-
tem joins together in an effort to
raise funds for a worthy charity.
The 1984 Greek Week Charity
was The University Health Cen-
ter of Pittsburgh’s FAMILY
HOUSE.

Through efforts made in Greek
Week, Pitt’s fraternities and so-
rorities will play an active part
in making the University of
Pittsburgh someplace special.
Greek Week is also a celebra-
tion of fraternity and sorority
friendships with one another.
This special week is for both fun
and competition. Each year the
Greeks compete for the tro-
phies and prestige. Besides the
hard work that is put into rais-
ing funds, Greek Week provides

Ed Polovina and Cheryl L. Perpetua
Greek Week Chairmen

276 Greek Week/Introduction

Introduction

 

many other activities. Events
such as the Dance-a-thon,
Greek Sing, Talent Night,
Chariot Race, Fun and Games
Night, All Greek Mixer & The
Greek Week Formal, allow the
Greeks to interact and get to
know one another. The fraterni-
ties and sororities also lend a
hand in the community by don-
ating their blood to the Pitts-
burgh Blood Bank, their canned

GREEK WEEK

    
 

Since November of 1983 the
Family House, located in
McKee Place has been in ser-
vice. This new program has giv-
en both a low cost and comfort-
able place to stay, for family
members of a person seeking
the highly specialized treatment
available at one of the Universi-
ty Health Center hospitals.
Along with providing shelter
the house allows the families to
share their problems with oth-
ers. People coming to Pitts-
burgh from different parts of
the world have taken advantage
of this program. It has been this
charity that the Greek life at Pitt

Family H owe

has given most of its attention.

The Greek Week Charity Drive
was held February 3rd through
March 28th, 1984. The sorori-
ties and fraternities raised
$45,000.00 for the Family
House. In addition to their fi-
nancial support, four represen-
tatives from each sorority and
fraternity will be volunteering
daily at the Family House. This
is the first time a volunteer pro-
gram has been part of their

schedule of events. It is obvious ,

to all that the Greeks at Pitt care
enough to make Family House a
home!

Saturday night, March 5rd,
Pitt’s Sororities and

Soldier’s and Sailor’s

singing and dancing talent.
Greek Sing is one of the most
well attended Greek Week
activities, and this year was no

   
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  

exception. Participation on the
part of the Interfraternal and
Panhellenic groups for Greek
Sing ’84 was the greatest ever.

Solder’s and Sailor’s Memorial
Hall was also the site of the
Dance-a-Thon. Anxious Greeks
and their partners started danc-
ing March 9th at 6:00 P.M. and
kept going till 6:00 P.M. March
10th. This 24 hour dance raised
$17,545 for the Family House.

The Greek Week Mixer this
year was scheduled to be held
on Wednesday, March 21st, at
the Syria Mosque. instead, the
mixers were held in several dif-
ferent houses. This was the
only event during Greek Week
in which competition was not a
major concern.

On March 24th, all Greeks gath-
ered in the Grand Ballroom of
the Hilton Hotel to present the
winners of each event with tro-
phies. The band “French" kept
the music going all evening.
There was plenty of dancing,
drinking, and fun.

Besides creating an original
house picture, PiKA has used
their combined skills to make a
true impact on the University as
well as the local community.
The brothers of Pi Kappa Al-
pha participated in the WQED
and WTAE phone-a-thon, and
their charity is the Big Brothers
of America. With 17 winter
term pledges, PiKA pulled
ahead to have the largest pledge
class out of all greeks. Athleti-
cally, the brothers of this frater-
nity have proved themselves by
winning the runner-up to the
All Sports Award. PiKA’s
brotherhood boasts the most
varsity athletes on campus, as
well as a member on SGB, this
shows their involvement at Pitt.
However, these guys do know
how to have fun, when they are
not out fund raising or partici-
pating in community affairs.
Who could forget their famous
PiKA Purple Passion Punch
Party!

The Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity
was founded nationally March
1st, 1868 and here on campus
March 3rd, 1934. Their colors
are Garnet and Gold, and some
well known Alumni include
Coach Foge Fazio and Terrence
Milani.

This year the Pi Kappa Alpha’s
house has not been sold, but
they will be moving to the new
Fraternity complex. Keep an
eye on this special group of
guys, we are sure that they will
be doing a load of spectacular
things in the future.

AB 11 Alpha Epsilon Phi

“From a humble beginning of
seven women at Barnard Col-
lege in 1909, Alpha Epsilon Phi
sorority has grown, and a
dream has been realized by
women with a spirit of friend-
ship. Our fundamental aim is to
foster loyal and devoted friend-
ships among women and in this
spirit Nu Chapter was founded
on May 12, 1920. We have trav-
eled a long road at Pitt since
1920. Today, we are still striv-
ing to fully achieve our lofty
aims, of friendship, sisterhood,
and university prominence.

 

The 1983-84 school year was an
exciting one for us at Nu Chap-
ter. At our National Convention
last summer we received an
award for chapter achievement
and excellence. The sisters of
Nu Chapter are actively in-
volved in many campus organi-
zations. This year we had mem-
bers received into Rho Lambda,
elected to sit on the judicial
boards of the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation, and member of the Stu-
dent Government Board. We
also have sisters on the execu-
tive boards of SHAB and PPC.
The sisters of Nu Chapter are a
very diverse, dynamic group of
women who represent a vital
force at the University of Pitts-
burgh and who will continue to
exert this force for many years
to come. As our motto states,
Nu Chapter of Alpha Epsilon
Phi Sorority is composed of
many hearts striving to achieve
our one purpose.” -— Traci

seminars geared toward self-en-
hancement. The average QPA
of the present chapter members
on campus is 3.0 and the mini-
mum overall QPA to become a
sister is 2.5. AKA sisters favor-

Founded 1867, at Asbury Uni-

the first Greek letter fraternity
for women. Continuing an orga-

and high ideals, the Alpha Ome-

Theta was established at Pitt in
1915. Presently, we are one of
the two sororities at Pitt that
own a house. We have sisters in-
volved in a variety of activities
including the Pitt band, Student
government, and on the Pitt
News. During Greek Week, we
took awards in the Chariot
Race, Banner competition, and
the blood drive. Kappa Alpha
Theta's national philanthropy is
Logopedies, for which our
chapter sponsored a balloon
sale, raffle, and a make-up dem-

STUDENT

Ah, the life of a commuter, one
we all envy, right?? Probably
not. Because of Pitt’s general lo-
cation, many of its students live
at home and commute each day
to the campus. It is a choice
wrought with both good and
bad sides.

Probably the most’ aggravating
part of a commuter’s life is the
actual travelling. Many people
use the bus and, to say the
least, the PAT Bus System is

not the best, or most reliable, 7

especially during those lovely
winter storms. And for those
who drive their owncars, rush
hour, traffic is not the easiest to
deal with. Since Pitt is located
in a city, finding somewhere to
park is also a huge problem.

The commuter also has to carry
all his books that he will have to
use that day. This could prove
to be a very heavy task.

Once the initial hassle of getting

to campus is over, a commut-
er‘s day is, more or less, like

26 Introduction/Student Life

    

everyone else’s. Go to a class
here, blow off one there, grab a
39-cent hamburger or two (or
three or four) at McDonald’s,
hang out at the Student Union,
do some studying at Hillman
(very little) and call it a day.

Then it is back home. Wait for
the bus with 900 other people
and hope you can find a seat.
Get your transfer and wait again
for your stop.

A commuter is also faced with
another important problem.
What if there's a party, and it,
oh, it ends at 3:00 a.m.? There
aren’t many buses running at

times they will have to make
sacrifices and leave early.

Commuters also have trouble
being involved and informed of
some of the activities on cam-
pus. If there is some activity on
a night when you can’t get back
to campus, you have to miss it,
whereas a resident can just
walk to the activity. Commut-
ers don’t get to party and stay
out as late at night ‘because
they have to go home to. their
parents. ‘

Living at home does have its ad-
vantages though. No need to
worry about laundry. And home
cooking sure beats cafeteria
food. And all those little conve-
niences like enough closet
space, no_line for the shower,
and peace and quiet when it’s a
normal sleeping hour.

Well, the commuter has his
problems but they’re as much a
part of Pitt as those who live on
campus. 7

Phi Delta Theta. We were
founded in 1848, and Pitt’s
chapter was established in 1918,.
A.L.S. Foundation (Lou Geh-

One of the things that makes
Phi Delta Theta special is the
fact that we are small enough so
that everyone has a Chance to
participate in events, yet we are
large enough to compete with
the bigger fraternities. Our size
also helps to form a more solid
brotherhood. Phi Delta Theta is
a fraternity not just four years,
but for a lifetime. —— George P.

Many people brand Greek-let-
ter organizations with being eli-
tist, discriminatory, having
"bought friends”, and most of
all “hearty partiers” or “party
animals”. To help outside ob-
servers, mainly the university
administration, local authori-
ties, and surrounding communi-
ty break their stereotypes, the
Interfraternity Council has en-
forced new rulings on parties
and Rush. Now parties must be
invitation only, with no open
ads of alcohol and a 1:()0 a.m.
curfew. Rush went dry this year
and will stay that way. All of the
Greek community at Pitt is

 

working together to enforce
these new policies, and to prove
Greek life is a healthy mixture
of socializing and classes.

Importance is placed on leader-
ship, education, friendship, in-
volvement in other areas of the
university, and just plain old
fun. This can be seen by the
comments of many members of
the Greek community, on the
next few pages. The many pic-
tures also help sum up the unity
and great times Pitt’s 1983-1984
Greeks shared.

The ex eriences will onl
)’

get better, and the memo-

ries will last 4 lzfe time.

Take ct look . . .

316 Greek/Greek Life

As a junior going through
rush, I had some idea of
what sororities were all
about; social outlets, if noth-
ing else. However, never
would I have believed that
anywhere could be more of a
“home away from home”,
than Chi Omega. The girls
here are anything but typi-
cal stereotype of a sorority
girl. Here in Chi Omega, we
strive for unity, lasting
friendships, and “scholar-
ship before social type obli-
gations”. This is really what
Greek life is all about.”

Sue Sturdevant, Chi Omega

‘‘I joined a sorority because I
lived off campus and I start-
ed to feel very detached
from campus activities. So-
rority life has helped me
meet new people and make
lasting friendships.”

Lisa Mastrangelo, Alpha Delta Pi

Greek/Greek Life 317

 

GREEK LIFE

  

“l have learned far more
than any textbook could
ever offer me. Responsibil-
ity, dignity, scholarship,
friendship, and love have all
come to me here at the uni-
versity, most especially
through Chi Omega.

Cathy Ripepi, Chi Omega

‘‘If I had to make the deci-
sion of joining a sorority or
not joining one all over
again, I would make the
same decision. I joined the
group where I felt most com-
fortable and felt I could
make long-lasting friends.
Most involvement with the
sorority doesn’t have to end
with graduation, and for me,
it won’t.”

Ellen L. Csikai, Theta Phi Alpha

318 Greek/Greek Life

“Delta Delta Delta has been
a rewarding experience for
me. She has given me per-
sonal growth, treasured
memories, and several cher-
ished friendships. I am
grateful that I seized the op-
portunity to share the spe-
cial unity that a sorority can
offer.”

Cheryl Perpetua, Delta Delta Delta

“Chi Omega has helped me
mature through leadership
positions and friendships in
a large group. The activities
in the sorority, both social
and community oriented
have given me memories
that will make my college
years at Pitt more than just
long nights spent with text-
books. I know I have greatly
contributed to the campus
as well as the Pittsburgh
community, and this has
made me feel good about
myself.”

Wendi \Y/estcott, Chi Omega

“Being a fraternity member
has a lot to offer, ties and
bonds that last forever. It's
really hard to believe until
you become a member of a
fraternity. I came to Pitt not
knowing anybody. This of-
fered me a sense of security
and belonging, which you
need in such a big university
as this. Greek life prepares
you for being a human being
in a functional society be-
cause a fraternity itself is a
small society and you have
to interact with the people
there, people with different
temperaments and talents
and convictions.”

Rick Pollock, Sigma Chi (president of
the I.F.C.)

granting the fraternity exclusive

Another renovation is an at-
tempt to unite the Greeks to
form a solid Greek system. The
I.F.C. formed the Fraternity
Unification Committee to avoid
a similar happening to that of
Amherst College. The whole
Greek system was abolished at
Amherst for reasons which are
still unclear. This committee,
lead by Tony DeFiore, feels that
the bickering among individ-
ual fraternities must come to an
end, especially with the new
Greek complex.

came the focal point of numer-
ous debates when its clean, Dr.
Donald Leon, asked assistant
dean for academic affairs Dr.

ment constitution. The func-
tions of thejudicial board will be
to monitor student government
as a whole, to select the chair-
man and members of the Elec-
tions Committee and to “stand
by if something goes wrong in
the elections process.”

April 3:

In an effort to bring the hearing
and deaf communities closer to-
gether, Pitt's Sign Connection,
Deaf Awareness Club and Dis-
abled Student Services co-spon-
sored Pitt’s first annual Deaf
Awareness Day. Deaf Aware-
ness Day was a way of asking
for support and understanding
toward the deaf community.

336 The End

$$@ﬂ9R®Y8@

We have come a long way since that early fall meeting where,
when discussing a theme for our book, Joyce came up with “Revi-
sions". All around us revisions were occuring — campus build-
ings, academic programs, and even the yearbook. Now, 336 pages
later it is time to bring “Revisions” to a close. But, revisions never
really close, or end. lt is like the domino effect, or rabbits multiply-
ing. Success breeds success so when revisions are successful, and
they usually are, it is only natural for more to occur. So, we
envision many more in the future and we look ahead to them, but,
we also look back.

When we began this book we never imagined what lay ahead of us.
So much work is put into the production of it. Much of the time is
just preparatory work — scheduling, organizing, planning, resche-
duling, reorganizing, replanning, and revising. And once produc-
tion is in full swing the hours get even longer. It is not always easy
to plan time well. We found that we needed at least twice the time
we thought we would to do the little things, the finishing touches.
This year was definitely tiring, but also rewarding.

The day of a deadline was always hectic and the tension mounted.
We may not have taken the time to say thank you to the people
who made our job easier. And there were many. Thank you must
go to our advisors: Larry Lunsford, Terry Milani, and Wilfred
Tremblay; George Stewart, C.T. Miller, and Chuck Reed; Ed Le-
tour, Len Gendry, Ray Christina, the Sports Information Office,
UPI, The Pitt News, lvan Santa-Cruz, John Tymitz, Gerry Abbot,
Elkie Secher, Cathy Rice, and everyone at the Student Activities

Office. And last, but in no way least, to our staff — without you

there would be no revisions.

The

Honors
Center

The services provided by the
University Honors Program are
threefold, according to Assis-
tant Director Barry Applbaum.
The first is offering courses in a
variety of disciplines to “able
and motivated students."

There are about 600 students
enrolled in the program, which
requires a student to have a
3.25 quality point average or
special permission from the in-
structor. Every semester thirty
to forty Honors courses are of-
fered which range from basic
courses to upper level courses
in a variety of disciplines that
are not offered in regular cur-
riculums. For example, the pro-
gram offered a course about
Central American Revolutions
during the winter 1984 term
that did not have a non-honors
equivalent.

The second function of the pro-
gram is special advising to com-

32 Academics/Honors Center

pliment Honors students’ regu-
lar advising. “Our idea is par-
ticularly able students have
more options available to them
than do the regular students in
terms of curriculum, career
choices, graduate and upper-
level training and merit-based
scholarships and fellowships,"
Applbaum said.

The 35th floor of the Cathedral
of Learning was recently con-
verted into the Honors Center,
where students can come to
read periodicals, study, type or
socialize. This satisfies the pro-
gram's third function: to pro-
vide a means of interaction
among Honors students. “The
idea is to get students to get to-
gether and discuss issues of
common concern," said Appl-
baum. The Honors Program is
also actively involved in the re-
cruiting process of students at
high schools.

Academics/Honors Center

This is a very exciting period of change for
the university because of the new frontiers
of research we are entering into, according
to Chancellor Wesley Posvar. “We have un-
dertaken a variety of programs and partner-
ships to accelerate the application of re-
search for public use."

New frontiers has certainly been the theme
of the 80’s for Pitt, which is drawing interna-
tional acclaim for partnerships and pro-
jects, programs and plans. One such en-
deavor is the Campus of the Future, which
Posvar dubs, “The leading innovation in the
whole country for universities.”

The Campus of the Future — which will
soon be part of the present — is the wiring
of the campus, as well as the regional cam-
puses, with fiberoptics for the transmission
of voice, video and data. The project has
already led to agreements between Pitt and
AT 8 T, Digital Equipment Company
(DEC), and Xerox.

Some recently-formed partnerships Posvar
cited Pitt's involvement in are the Founda-
tion for Applied Sciences and Technology
(FAST) and the Ben Franklin partnership,
in which the state helps finance new busin-
esses with high technology to create jobs.
“We have formed the University Trust,
which is a private, non-profit holding com-
pany which will contain a lot of these new
activities that are developed,” the Chancel-
lor said. “There might even be corporations
that come out of this.”

lmportant Pitt projects include the Pitts-
burgh Cancer Institute, which will conduct
research and clinical care. The university is
now the leader in human organ transplants
and set a first earlier this year by perform-
ing a double organ (heart and liver) trans-
plant.

Posvar has spent 17 years at Pitt, and he
said the most important development in his
career has been the progress made from
Affirmative Action. “Twenty years ago,
there were hardly any minority students
here,” he said. “How we have a substantial
amount of minority students and faculty."

At 58, Posvar is approachingthe age of
mandatory retirement for Pitt administra-
tors, 65. Although he’ll step down from his
position as chancellor, he plans to remain
an active member of the faculty. “I don’t
intend to ever retire,” he said.

Entering New Frontiers

 

The Pitt Philosophy Department, which has
been evaluated as one of the three leading
such departments in the country, is making
curricular reforms this year.

For example, it is planning to introduce a
new course in computer logic in the winter
of 1985. Another new class to be added will
be a lower-level course on political philos-
ophy, which will be an introduction to the
major political and historical figures and
their central problems.

Another sign of the restructuring of the cur-
riculum is the elimination of the philosophy
course offered exclusively to engineers.
“(We want) to enable (engineers) to mix
with a diverse group of students to broaden
their scope of philosophy," said Philosophy
Department Chairman David Gauthier.
“We’d like to see the engineers be made
aware of a broader range of perspectives
and give them an opportunity to select
from a wide range of courses than if they
had just one philosophy course to take.”

One philosophy course is now mandatory
for graduation, and Gauthier is looking for-
ward to the increased role Philosophy will
have in the new College of Arts and Sci-
ences curriculum. “We think that an impor-
tant part of a general university education
is spending some time reflecting, the way
philosophers do," he said.

“Students come to the university with less
knowledge of philosophy than any other
subject," said Gauthier. “With rare excep-
tions, they haven’t had any of it in high
school. Perhaps there's always a puzzle-
ment among those who are ignorant of the
subject.”

He said philosophy is more abstract than
other subjects and requires people to think
about matters that tend to be taken for
granted. “in every day life, we go around
making various moral judgments. The phi-
losopher asks, ‘What is the basis of our
judgment? How do we decide if these judg-
ments are correct or incorrect?”

Forever
Improving 8
Revising

This year's class of incoming freshmen will
face a substantially greater and more spe-
cific set of requirements than their junior
and senior counterparts have to meet.
These curricular reforms are the product of
several years of planning and became effec-
tive in the fall of 1983.

“Its a much more structured system now,”
according to Dean lrwin Schulman of the
College of Arts and Sciences.

The previous requirements for graduation
consisted of nine classes: three in the social
sciences, three in the natural sciences and
three in the humanities. The new require-
ments consist of twelve courses: one in lit-
erature; one in music or fine arts; and one in
music, fine arts, literature or creative ex-
pression; one course in philosophy; one in
the social sciences; and one in history; and
three courses in the natural sciences, two
of which must be in sequence.

One difference between the new require-
ments and the old system of distribution of
studies is that math and computer science
are now excluded from the list of natural
science courses, so students will inevitably
take courses in the physical or biological
sciences.

“We’ve had to develop a whole system of
approving courses to meet these new re-
quirements,” Schulman said. “Not any
course can be taken for these. That's been
the main initiative for this past year —- to
work out this system that is being imple-
mented.”

The new requirements also include two for-
eign culture classes and new skill require-
ments in writing and math. In addition to

36 Academics/CAS

basic writing, students must now take a
composition course and two “W” courses,
which become increasingly more ad-
vanced. “The renewed emphasis on writing
is probably the most important thing we‘re
doing," said Schulman. Also mandatory
are one course in algebra and a second in
quantitiative math or reasoning.

The next step in the curricular reforms is
increasing the foreign language require-
ment from two to three years, which can be
taken in high school or college.

Other important events of this year, accord-
ing to Schulman, include approval of the
new film studies major and extension of the
withdrawal period from six to nine weeks.
“But we made it harder for (students) to
(withdraw) after nine weeks,” he said. He
said only about 50 to 100 students per term
have genuinely extentuating circum-
stances to legitimize a late withdrawal. “We
don’t let them withdraw because they’re
not doing well.”

In today’s automated world, the ever-popu-
lar study of computer science remains
strong. “People are still majoring in com-
puter science," said Dr. Orrin Taulbee,
chairman of the Computer Science Depart-
ment.

Some of the classes are so popular, in fact,
that students are known to “camp out” in
front of the Registrar’s office the night be-
fore registration begins so they’re assured a
place in a computer science class. Taulbee
calls this a “non-problem," claiming there
is no shortage of class space and blaming it
on "the system". A new method of han-
dling Add/Drop, he said, should be the solu-
tion to the “non-problem”.

Because it takes four of five days to record
a student's dropping a class, classes may

38 Academics/Computer Science

Great Demand, Small Faculty

appear closed out but actually have the
available spaces of the students who
dropped the course. In the fall of 1983,
there were 950 spaces for the popular 100-
level computer science courses, but “At
the end of the Add/Drop period, the num-
ber of students actually in these courses
was 634,” Taulbee said. “The system is not
geared to handle a quick turn around.”

A new process that began this fall should
help sort out the confusion. Students are
limited to three 100-level courses at regis-
tration, and the Undergraduate Programs
Office “keeps a very close eye on what
they take," said Taulbee. If a student wants
to drop a course, he must do it through that
office.

Taulbee said the Add/Drop situation must

be straightened out before the department
thinks about adding more sections of 100-
level courses. “We need to solve some oth-
er problems before we talk about adding
more," he said.

One of his personal goals is to change the
general undergraduate requirement of any
five 100-level courses to specific classes at
that level. The department would have to
offer several sections of each of those
courses, but it now doesn't have enough
faculty to teach them. ‘‘If we were to put in
requirements for 100-level courses, there's
no way we could handle it,” he said.

With only about 20 percent of the 260
graduating PhDs in computer science going
into academics each year, “that leaves a
tremendous scramble to get faculty," Taul-
bee said, “but that will turn around one of
these days."

He wants to add graduate and undergrad-
uate classes in networking, distributive pro-
cessing and the graphics areas. “Those are
three big areas where new courses should
be added, he said. “We have some now, but
certainly not enough."

The Finer Things in Life

Located in the cultural capital of the city,
Pitt offers students three majors in which
they can enjoy the arts. The Fine Arts and
Studio Arts Department and the Architec-
tural Studies Program expose undergrad-
uates to the “finer things in life”.

The Studio and Fine Arts share the Frick
Fine Arts Building, and according to De-
partment Chairman Ed Powell, there are
about 45 students majoring in Studio Arts.
This major offers visual art courses on
drawing, painting, print-making, design,
sculpture and color. “We’re the practicing
arts segment of the university,” Powell
said.

He describes the Studio Arts as “alive and
well." Its major projects this year include
the on-going exhibits the department spon-
sors at the UP Gallery, including the annual
student exhibit. There are also six “out-
standing” practicing artists teaching in the
department this year, including nationally
known film animator Paul Glabicki.

The Fine Arts Department had Edward Fry
on its faculty this year, a Visiting Mellon
Professor who taught courses about con-
temporary art. “We will look at the history
of the arts in relation to culture and society,
society," said Kathryn Lyndoff, chairman

of the department. A new course added this

fall was Fine Arts ll, which examines non-
western art and the artistic interaction be-
tween the East and West in more modern
times.

Also bringing contemporary art to Pitt is
the Architectural Studies Program, which
sponsored a symposium on Pittsburgh’s
new skyscrapers this year. The architects
of the downtown buildings were present at
the symposium to discuss their work.

The program — not a department — has
been in existence for six years, and in the
past three years, since Professor “Fil”
Hearn has been director, the number of stu-
dents majoring in Architectural Studies has
risen from 16 to 50.

According to Hearn, the program takes an
active interest in their students. “We cer-
tainly emphasize internships and help (stu-
dents) clarify their professional goals much
more than they had ever done before,” he
said.

Hearn said a vast majority of these students
don't even go into architecture. So, why
would students major in Architectural
Studies — or Studio or Fine Arts?

“They just love it,” Hearn said.

Many Interests? Become a Dual Major

Less than four years in exis-
tence, the undergraduate busi-
ness program has become so
popular that only about 60 per-
cent of the students who apply
actually get in. “When you have
such demand for the program,
there's obviously student inter-
est," said Undergraduate Busi-
ness Programs Director Ed Pa-
lascak. About 240 students are
accepted into the program each
year, Palascak said.

The major is actually a dual ma-
jor, which can be matched with
any undergraduate major in the
College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS). It includes 31 required
credits, nine credits of dual ma-
jor electives and 13 credits in
specific prerequisites in lower-
level courses.

Palascak said students com-
bine business with 70 percent of
the CAS majors, the most popu~
lar of which are economics,
computer science, psychology
and speech. Students also
come, however, with back-
grounds in languages, black
studies and music. “Different
kinds of students are attracted
to the major,” he said.

Business and business/ac-
counting are also offered in the
College of General Studies
(CGS). Forty to 45 percent of
the students taking an under-
graduate business major are
women, Palascak said, and they
usually enter with at least a 3.0
average.

One change Palascak would
like to make in the program is
adding business electives
which can be taken through
CGS but not do not count to-
ward the major. “Students
would benefit from a little more
specialization than is offered (in
CAS). But it's difficult to fit ev-

42 Academics/Business

&;

erything into 120 credits," he
said.

An internship course was added
to the program about two years
ago, and the number of avail-
able internships is increasing.

The placement success rate, he
said, is not as encouraging. “I
think the economy and the re-
duction of the number of com-
panies doing recruiting on cam-
pus has hurt our placement,"
Palascak said. “Its a difficult
job market.”

Old 8 New Friends Reunited

A reunion occured last summer
between some old friends who
had been separated for half a
decade. The various parts of
the Mathematics/Statistics de-
partment had been spread
among Forbes Quad, the Wil-
liam Pitt Union and the Mineral
Industrial Building for the past
five years; now they are togeth-
er again in Thackeray Hall.

At about the same time as the
move, a Statistical Computing
Laboratory was also estab-
lished in Thackeray Hall at a
cost of $300,000.

“They’re interested in trying dif-
ferent distributions and seeing
what sort of results you get
from this interpretation of data

using computer classifica-
tions,” Mathematics/Statistics
Chairman “Gene” Deskins said
of the new lab.

An additional $300,000 in
grants from the Air Force and
National Science Foundation
has allowed the department to
expand its math computing lab-
oratory.

“About half the (44-member)
faculty in our department is do-
ing research supported by some
branch of the government,”
Deskins said.

One of Deskins‘ personal goals
for the department is to estab-
lish a tutoring program using
personal computers. “We'd like

to set up essentially a math lab-
oratory where students could
go for help on a computer,” he
said. “It has been done and sev-
eral schools are trying to do
this. It's been very successful in
helping students with problems
in language. We would like to
try something like this in math-
ematics.

“Funding is a real problem,” he
said. “It would be nice to have
enough people to provide this
sort of tutoring, but a good com-
puter can do this more efficient-
ly and much cheaper. One old
basic problem is, we really don‘t
have enough people in the de-
partment to provide the assis-
tance to students that we would
like to provide.”

Looking into
the Mind

Very few undergraduates pass through the
portals of Pitt without entering the portals
of the mind as well. Eighty-five to ninety-
five percent of Pitt students take Psycholo-
gy 10 (Introduction to Psychology) as either
a fulfillment of a requirement or a stepping
stone to a further study of psychology.

Four sections of the class are offered in the
fall and three in the winter terms, with 300
to 400 students in each section. It used to
be offered in many sections of 40 or 50 and
was primarily taught by graduate students.

In 1961, Dr. Merle Moskowitz, now Associ-
ate Chairman of the Department and who,
at the time taught the class, joined a col-
league and planned a psychology course to
be taught on a larger scale.

Why do so many students take Psychology
10?

“I think a lot of students take it out of inter-
est,” Moskowitz said. “Unlike chemistry
and physics, there are very few good
courses in psychology in high school. Stu-
dents want to have an understanding of
what psychology is about. Some of them
come in thinking it’s all psychoanalysis.
Some think it's all brain control."

The purpose of the course, he said, is to
give students an introduction to all areas of
psychology. lt cover everything from the
study of the brain and its relation to behav-
ior to the way people interact with each
other to the treatment of psychological

44 Academics/Psychology

problems to the ways in which children de-
velop and learn.

Moskowitz has seen the angle of the class
change since it began 23 years ago. At that
time, the emphasis was strongly behavior-
al, but now there is increasing emphasis on
cognitive processes. “People have always
been curious how the mind works, even
though the behavioralists would rather
study how the body works," he said.

Moskowitz said he thinks there will be, in
the future, increasing emphasis on physio-
logical and chemical factors in the class. He

said there is already in psychology a strong
movement on the study of drugs and their
effect on human behavior, and there is also
an increasing study of chemical factors in
general and their effect on conditions such
as depression, schizophrenia and learning.

He also sees an increasing interest in the
whole process of child development and
how the training of children can be im-
proved. There's a lot of work going on now
with computers working with children who
have difficulty learning, and he said Psy-
chology 10 will change to accommodate
these changes and trends.

xchanging ideas between the Americas

 

They exchange with 21 countries and pro-
vide tuition fellowships for graduate and
undergraduate students. The most signifi-
cant of the program's undergraduate activi-
ties, Adelson said, is the competition for 15
fellowships to do an independent research
project in Latin America with a Pitt profes-
sor. The students receive the equivalent of
$10,000. Last spring, for example, students
paid only $375 each for 71/2 weeks in Mexi-
co. in addition, they each received six cred-
its for the independent research and 3 cred-
its for a winter preparatory course. “This is
really the most unique part of our pro-
gram," Adelson said.

They also conduct a national competition
for five foreign language and area studies
fellowships, which provide tuition and an
allowance for graduate students who spe-
cialize in Latin American Studies.

The Latin American Studies Program sup-
ports faculty who are working on individual
projects by helping them solicit funds. The
program is funded half by the university
and half by outside sources, like the An-
drew Mellon Foundation, the Rockefellers
and the Kelloggs.

Since there is no degree offered at Pitt in
Latin American Studies, the Latin Ameri-
can Studies Program does its part to bring
about exchanges of people and ideas be-
tween the Americas.

The purpose of the program, which is in its
15th year, is “to facilitate the orientation of
the diverse research to the faculty among
Latin American themes,” said Alan Adel-
son, associate director of the program. “We
provide funding for new courses related to
Latin America, for faculty research in the
countries. We have fellowships for Latin
American students who come here and en-
rich the (Pitt) students in the classroom,
and (we) provide opportunities for our stu-
dents and faculty to go to these countries."

One particular means of bringing Latin
American professors to Pitt is through the
Mellon Visiting Professorships, two of

Automating
the Libraries

In a few years, you'll be able to find out if
the library has the book you need in a mat-
ter of minutes — without even leaving your
dormitory! This will be part of a three-phase
program to automate the University Li-
brary System, which will take three to five
years to install.

The program calls for the automation of the
card catalogue, the system by which books
are ordered and the circulation system.

“(Students) would have access to the li-
brary from any university terminal,” ac-
cording to Assistant Director for Adminis-
trative Services Pamela Vance. “You could
dial in from any microcomputer to see if a
book was here."

Although the program was planned pre-
viously, it will become integrated with the
Campus of the Future project, which al-
lows for the transmission of voice, video,
and data by the use of fiber-optics.

A separate but similar program also to be-
gin at the libraries is Computer Literature
Searching, in which students can search for
information about a specific subject. “You
could sit down at a terminal and put in the
subject that you’re looking for and get a
print-out of the material that’s available,"
Vance said. “You have to limit it in some

- ;m;awmmw-w««m«m«»«m.wmm«m«ma»»umr»mwm¢ i.,w»x«»mmmu-s.mu.m»w»m«»m=m«m

way, though. You could put in a (general)
subject like education and destroy a com-
puter system.”

The University Library System includes 15
of the campus’ 20 libraries, some of which
are with the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, the Darlington Memo-
rial Library, which is in the Cathedral of
Learning and contains volumes about early
American history, and the Chemistry, Eco-
nomics, Math, Computer Science and Mu-
sic Departments. The libraries have a com-
bined total of 3.7 million volumes, including
microtexts. The largest library is Hillman.

One problem the Hillman Library has been
continually faced with is that of students
leaving the remains of their meals in the
study carrells. Vance said Hillman has a
guard to enforce the “No food and bever-
ages” rule, and the situation is improving a
little.

Vance also said that, despite pressure from
some students, “there are no immediate
plans" to extend Hillman Library hours
past 1 a.m. during final exam period. That’s
what the library did a decade ago, with little
success.

“There were not many students in the li-
brary, and most of them were asleep," she
said. “I don’t think the library has many
students in it after midnight.”

lmproving
Study
Skills

One common problem students coming
from high school —~ even “A” students —
encounter in college is having to adjust
study practices to handle twice their former
work load in half the time.

To address this problem, plus those exper-
ienced by upperclassmen, graduate stu-
dents and, often, faculty, the Learning
Skills Center was established as a “free sup-
port service for all students in the universi-
ty,” according to Coordinator Georgine Ma-
terniak.

A decade in existence, the Learning Skills
Center serves about 2,000 students a year,
about 40 percent of which are freshmen. It
provides assistance in the way of Reading,
Math and Study Skills. Workshops at the
Center are two hours a week for six weeks,
the most popular of which is speedreading.
“The workshops really help that adjust-
ment (from high school to college),” Mater-
niak said.

The aim of the speedreading workshop, she
said, is to increase, even double, speed,
while maintaining and possibly improving
comprehension. For a focus on comprehen-
sion and vocabulary-building, the Center of-
fers an effective reading workshop. This is
also available to students on an individual
basis.

“This program is really looking at taking
any learner where they’re at, no matter how
good they are, and help them become bet-
ter," Materniak said. “A lot of students who
are doing well, but might have to sacrifice a
lot to do that, may come to us to improve in
efficiency. We really designed the program
to meet the diverse needs of a university
population.“

48 Academics/Learning Skills Center

Sixty trained undergraduate students and
five full-time professionals comprise the
staff of the Learning Skills center, and
some of these students also do personal
math tutoring.

Another popular workshop the Center of-
fers is study skills, which covers textbook
reading, lecture note-taking, time manage-
ment, memory improvement and preparing
for and taking essay exams and objective
and computational tests.

“We introduce students to memory the-
ory,” said Materniak. “We believe that
whether you listen to a lecture or you're
reading a textbook, you're taking in infor-
mation. Hopefully, you’ll develop skills to
take it in effectively and store it so you can
get it back out again so it can be applied
appropriately.”

Bon Voyage!

Despite a grounded ship last
year and a recent controversy
over a stop in South Africa, it
looks like smooth sailing for the
Semester at Sea program this
fall.

The S.S. Universe hit trouble
when it sailed into a sandbar in
Egypt in the spring of 1983.
“There was extensive damage
to the ship and it had to be re-
paired,” said Max Brandt, direc-
tor of field programs for the Se-
mester at Sea.

It was more stormy waters
when the ship was denied en-
trance to Mozambiuque during
last winter's voyage. ‘‘It’s a
Communist country, and
they’re having a pretty tough
time economically," Brandt
said. "They just don’t have the
up-to-date facilities to accomo-
date the ship.” Instead, they
made a stop in South Africa to
refuel. “Of course, there’s a lot
of sentiment here at the Univer-
sity and in Pittsburgh about any
dealings with South Africa be-
cause of its apartheid policies,”
Brandt said.

He said the students aboard
generally viewed the exper-

ience as an educational one.

50 Academics/Semester At Sea

“Many students said it was per-
haps the most educational ex-
perience of any of the ports be-
cause few of them had really
ever thought of the problems of
apartheid,” he said. “They had
heard all about it, but (now)
they were really there to get a
look at the social problems."

Brandt said there will be no
more stops in Brazil, because
taking that route forces the ship
to sail around South Africa.
Now the ship will go first
through the Mediterranean Sea
and straight to Spain and will
then proceed around the world.

The winter voyage, which left
from Florida in January and ar-
rived in San Franciso in April,
made stops in between in Brazil,
Capetown, Kenya, Sri Lanka, ln-
dia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Ja-
pan. lt received special atten-
tion because of the presence of
Barry Paris, staff writer for the
Pittsburgh Post Gazette, who
sent descriptive columns back
to Pittsburgh about the ship’s
journey.

The ship makes the voyage
twice a year, with about 500
students from colleges all over
the country. Students are cho-

   
  
 
   
  
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
 
   
 
  
   
  
 
  
  
  
   
 
 
 
  
   

  

sen for the program on the basis
of their academic standing,
Brandt said, with 2.5 being the
minimum quality point average
for students considering the
trip. During the voyage, stu-
dents must take at least 12
credits of “standard liberal arts
curriculum", which includes,
for example, English, Business
and Anthropology classes.
Classes are 70 minutes long and
are held every other day when
the ship is not in port.

The cost of the trip is $8000 ——
$9000 and there are a few schol-
arships available to alleviate
that cost. The most popular
such scholarship at Pitt is the
Augmentation Grant, in which
students can go on the Semes-
ter at Sea for the same price it
would cost to attend Pitt for one
semester. Because only two or
three of these scholarships are
offered each year, “the compe-
tition is pretty stiff for these
grants," Brandt said. There are
also about 20 work/study posi-
tions open each voyage, in
which the student pays for half
the regular price but is required
to perform certain duties, like
working in the ship library.

As the years go by, you may find a new
type of nurse emerging from school. She’ll
probably still be dressed in white and know
how to give a shot, but she may also be
proficient in the use of computers and word
processors.

This new technology is being emphasized
“where we didn't think computers would be
before," according to Enid Goldberg, dean
of Pitt’s School of Nursing.

“If you read the papers today, you'll find
that we no longer have a shortage of nurses
in Southwestern Pennsylvania,” she said,
“but that doesn't mean that all the nursing
positions in the country are filled. lt’s new
knowledge and new technology that comes
out of the health field which creates new
jobs in the health care industry.”

New Technology Hits

Nursing

Another trend in nursing education is that
more people are getting their doctorate.
“There‘s more and more demand for stu-
dents with a doctorate degree,” Goldberg
said. Pitt is one of 26 nursing schools in the
nation to offer a doctorate degree.

There are about 1,000 students enrolled in
the undergraduate, masters and doctorate
nursing programs combined at Pitt. A ma-
jor curricular reform two years ago reduced
the number of required credits for the un-
dergraduate degree from 10 to eight terms
to be taken in four years.

“Our house is in order,” Goldberg said.
“Our biggest thrust in the future has to be

in the_area of research.”

Research projects being conducted in the

 
  

school include comparing body-related con-
cerns of children with cancer to those of
children without cancer; and whether one is
right — or left —- handed and its relation-
ship to breast cancer. Research is also be-
ing conducted to determine the impact of
various factors on the well-being of working
women as compared to housewives.

Goldberg’s plans for the future for the
school include programs in child psychiat-
ric nursing and gerontological nursing.
These courses are not offered at this time
and would have to be developed, possibly
combined with some aspect of primary
care on the masters level.

“It's something that we’re going to think
about and might potentially write for some
funds,“ Goldberg said.

Toward a Career

The School of Health Related
Professions prepares students
for a career in a variety of
health fields including medical
technology, physical therapy,
health records administration,
and occupational therapy.
Medical technologists often
work in clinical laboratories.
They do testing to analyze
blood fluids and to identify or-
ganisms causing diseases.
Medical technologists use their
knowledge and skill to develop
new equipment and techniques.
The duty of a physical therapist
is to work with the handicapped
or injured so that they may op-
erate to their fullest capacity.

A student majoring in health re-
cords administration at Pitt is
given a background in business

in Health

by taking courses in systems
analysis, management, and le-
gal issues. This prepares them
for a department head position
where they develop patient in-
formation systems.

Pitt's occupational therapy ma-
jors are preparing for a career of
service to people unable to
cope with normal everyday ac-
tivities due to such things as de-
velopmental deficits, aging,
poverty, or psychological dis-
ability. Pitt’s program looks for
students with a good feel for hu-
man nature and a high amount
of patience. The emphasis at
Pitt is on the psychological as-
pects of disabled people and
their attempts to function in the
world.

the Welfare of Others

Social work is a profession con-
cerned with the impact of social
policy on human welfare. Here
at Pitt, the program aims to pre-
pare students to practice social
work. The program meets the
standards outlined by the Coun-
cil on Social Work Education
and teaches its majors skills in
social policy analysis, tech-
niques appropriate for interven-
tion, and the philosophical val-
ues which underlie social work.

Another goal of the program is
for students to acquire an un-
derstanding of the importance
of race, ethnicity, and genders
as major factors affecting social
work practice.

Students meeting the require-
ments of the school are ad-
mitted for their junior and sen-
ior years and begin their intense
study of social work.

Plans for the Future

Recently reaccredited with a “glowing re-
port" and a high rate on the reaccreditation
review, the Pitt Pharmacy School is flying
high with plans for the future.

These plans are enhanced by the renova-
tion of Salk Hall, including Pharmacy teach-
ing labs, classrooms, research labs and of-
fices. The state has appropriated $18 mil-
lion for the renovation, which will also
include the Dental Clinic.

Adding to the optimism is the presence of
visiting Professor Dr. Max Perutz, the first
Pitt faculty member ever to receive a Nobel
Prize. Perutz will be working with the Drug
Design and Development Program, which
was established in July 1983.

The program “will encompass schools
from around the campus to look at drugs

58 Academics/ Pharmacy

related to various diseases," said Dr. H. Da-
vid Bergman, assistant dean of the Pharma-
cy School. Some of the diseases currently
focused on are Sickle Cell Anemia and Altz-
heimer’s Disease.

Another of the school’s research projects is
cyclosporine, a drug which is used in trans-
plant patients. Some doctors believe one
reason many patients reject an organ is be-
cause the amount of that drug in the body is
not sufficient to take care of immunity re-
sponse the body has toward the new organ.

The School of Pharmacy is also involved
with research of a new gas sterilizer com-
pound. “It's the kind of thing one might use
to sterilize all types of instruments used in
hospitals and operating rooms," Bergman
said.

Researching
Energy and
Transition

The Pitt School of Engineering is currently
involved in a variety of research projects,
ranging from coal cleaning to slag disposal
to project management, within the various
disciplines.

“Each department has its own projects,”
according to Mr. Michael Zabetakis, acting
associate dean of the school. “The types of
work they do are quite varied."

One noteworthy project the school is par-
ticipating in is the formation of the BCR
National Laboratory (BCRNL), a coales-
cence between Pitt and Bituminous Coal
Research, Inc. (BCR). It was established to
provide an energy-related research facility,
located in Monroeville, for use by private
industry, government and universities.

“were tying to work together to develop a
program that will be of interest to most of
the university as well as the BCRNL," Zabe-
takis said. The cooperation will continue for
five years “on basically a trial basis, at
which time the entire assets of BCR will be
turned over to BCRNL.”

The facilities are for the use of Pitt as well

60 Academics/ Engineering

as BCR employees, and there are several
proposals in now for research on combus-
tion and certain aspects of mining.

On the curricular side, Zabetakis said the
school is considering reforms for the ap-
proximate 400 entry-level freshmen who
enter engineering each term. There are uni-
form classes for all freshmen, but some stu-
dents are repeating what they learned in
high school in these classes. For example,
since many students already had basic
computing courses, Zabetakis wants to be
able to offer advanced computer courses to
freshmen.

“We're beginning to find the same thing in
the areas of mathematics and science," he
said. “We're taking a very close look at the
backgrounds of students and see if we can
have a better transition for them.”

He said they are also investigating engineer-
ing needs for the future and which subjects
to emphasize. “What should we be doing
about robotics, about computer engineer-
ing? By the year 2000, well be in step with
what the requirements are."

Academics/Engineering 61

Chemical Careers

The Chemistry major at Pitt
provides students good prep-
arationfor a career in medicine,
dentistry, forensic chemistry,
as well as many other fields.
The emphasis of the major is on
fundamentals and voluntary
participation in the undergrad-
uate research program is sug-
gested.

Combining chemistry with an-
other discipline can lead to
many satisfying careers. For ex-
ample, combining chemistry
and computer science can lead
to a career in chemical informa-

62 Academics/Chemistry

tion and data-systems work,
chemistry and business can re-
sult in market research, and
chemistry and journalism can
lead to a career of science writ-

ing.

The undergraduate chemistry
program is fully accredited na-
tionally and meets all of the sci-
ence requirements for admis-
sion to any one of the graduate
health professions, for admis-
sion to graduate school in
chemistry, and for a career at
the BS. level in chemistry and
many related fields.

The
ampus

of the
Future

As computer technology con-
tinues to sweep the nation, Pitt
has entered into an agreement
with AT8T Information Sys-
tems to create the “Campus of
the Future". The communica-
tion system will make use offi-
beroptics described by the Wall
Street Journal as “lightwave
technology (that) allows voice,
data, and video to be carried as
pulses of laser lights over thin
glass fibers." Fiberoptics carry
more information at a smaller
cost than wire cables and will be
installed underground.

Installation began this summer
and will continue for three
years. As a result students and
faculty will be able to communi-
cate between the buildings of
Pitt’s Oakland campus and the
branch campuses simply by
logging on to a computer termi-
nal.

Changes will also occur in and
around the classrooms. The
University’s libraries will be-
come automated allowing a stu-
dent to locate and read a text
from a computer terminal. A
hard copy could be printed
from a microcomputer in a
dorm room. Televised lectures
will be used, and, imagine hav-
ing an assignment due at Alum-

64 Academics/Campus of the Future

ni Hall or Pennsylvania Hall and
not having to walk that long
way. lnstead, just send the
homework to your professor's
computer. The advancements
seem almost endless.

The system at Pitt is similar to
the information network AT8T
installed at Walt Disney World’s
EPCOT Center. However, this is
the first such network designed
for a university. ATST chose
Pitt due to its size, the amount

of research done here, and its
location —— in one of the top
business centers of the nation.
In addition to the network,
ATST will co-sponsor with Pitt
research on information man-
agement techniques. Many oth-
er research programs will also
expand including the ones in
the library and information sci-
ence department and the com-
puter science department.

Because the network can work

.
E
E;

openly with many kinds of com-
puters, agreements with the
Digital Equipment Corporation
and Xerox have also been en-
tered into. The Campus of the
Future will generate increases
in productivity, cost reduc-
tions, and more academic op-
portunities. Thus, the value of
this project to the University of
Pittsburgh has been estimated
at $20 million.

Standing Room Only

In its 14th season at Pitt, the
Presidential Rhetoric class,
taught by Professor Ted Windt,
has become almost an institu-
tion in itself. This standing-
room-only class is part of the
Speech and Communications
department and attracts over
500 students each term.

The purpose of the class, Windt
said, “is to understand the role
that rhetoric plays in the presi-
dent's exercise of power, in
gaining power or loss of power.
It is, in essence, a study of the
public presidency.

“Also, (the purpose) is to have
students become more in-
formed and critical participants
in presidential politics and in po-
litical life," Windt explained.

He continually expands the test
material “to stay contempo-
rary" and uses mostly a collec-
tion of presidential speeches.
This is the first undergraduate
course on the presidents or
presidential rhetoric to be of-
fered, and since its establish-
ment in 1970, other universities
have followed suit.

In 1979, the class was one of the
recipients of the National En-
dowment for the Humanities for
the class’ expansion into two
parts. As the class previously
covered Kennedy and Johnson
in the first part, it now includes
part of the Nixon Administra-

tion so the second part can go '

to the present administration.

Part of the reason for this ex-
pansion is that more class time
must now be devoted to provid-
1'19 background material. ‘‘In
1970, if I mentioned the Kenne-
Cl)’ Administration, the students
remembered, even if they were
children at the time,” Windt

lwindt.

said. “Now many of my stu-
dents were born after Kennedy
was president."

As the course has changed its
content over the year, Windt
has seen a new type of student
evolve as well. “I think you’ll
see a different kind of student
emerge now than from the late
60’s or early 70's," he said.

“Students are now less active in
radical causes," according to
“The Vietnam War is
over. We went through what
Time magazine called ‘the Me
Generation’ of the 70's. Now
what you’re getting are stu-

dents who are concerned with
their professional careers.”

He said that despite their lack of
activism, students are no more
apathetic than the rest of soci-
ety. “Politics is not usually a
major issue that most people
are interested in. Politics be-
come important when they im-
pinge on you,” he said.

“What you’re getting now is
really a student who recognized
that (his) professional career
may be deeply influenced by
political decisions, and he
wants to understand what's go-
ing on."

Pitt — What A Feeling!

Upperclassmen and the 1987 Bicentennial Freshman
class start a new year

Orientation is only the begin-
ning, but most Pitt freshmen as
well as upperclassmen can tell
you what an exciting and event-
ful start to the fall term it truly
is. From August twenty-seventh
to the thirtieth, new freshmen
were given the opportunity to
familiarize themselves with life
at Pitt and adjust to the rigorous
schedule of full-fledged stu-
dents. Mentors, student advi-
sors, and faculty combined their
time and talents to offer the
3000 freshmen of the 1987 Bi-
centennial Class endless oppor-
tunities to get acquainted with
each other, the campus, and to
ask any questions about Pitt life.

The Activities Fair was held at

68 Orientation

Forbes Quad on Monday, Au-
gust twenty-ninth. Through the
crowded maze, students could
locate information booths re-
presenting nearly all of Pitt’s
campus organizations and sign
up for those that interested
them. There were also clowns,
magicians, artists and free re-
freshments for everyone. Later
that night Pittsburgh’s own
Houserockers attracted a rowdy
group of students to the Quad
for an evening of rock-n-roll.
Pitt Greeks welcomed the fresh-
men with a watermelon picnic
on the Cathedral lawn on the
thirtieth, distributing Rush
cards and offering advice to po-
tential brothers and sisters of
the Greek family. The mentors

sponsored their own variety of
athletic competitions for inter-
ested students. For those from
out of state who had never been
to a Pirate game, the freshmen
class was treated to one on a
rainy afternoon in Three Rivers
Stadium.

The annual Lantern Night, held
on Tuesday evening, gave fe-
male upperclassmen the oppor-
tunity to pass the light of wis-
dom on to the awaiting women
of the freshmen class. Pitt’s
nursing students were also rec-
ognized during the much antici-
pated Black Banding ceremo-
nies.

Orientation is not restricted to

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

freshmen, however. Returning
upperclassmen who are already
familiar with the anxiety and
confusion of a new term, knew
where to find the fun and took
advantage of these few days of
activities.

The massive inﬂux of students
accompanied by the many ac-
tivities is comparable to an
enormous family reunion, annu-
ally uniting Pitt’s family of stu-
dents. The inevitable start of
classes on the thirty-first
brought out the books and offi-
cially began the 1985 fall term
— a big step in the lives of many
Pitt freshmen. Hopefully a step
that was filled with many re-
warding experiences.

Orientation 69

What does a street in New York
City have to do with the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh? Broadway is
renowned for its famous plays,
breathtaking musicals and
sparkling lights, and holds the
tradition of good times “out on
the town.” This is precisely
what is entailed during Home-
coming at Pitt: a week of events
to get you out of your room,
away from studying, so you can
have fun “out on the town.”

The tradition of Homecoming
began in 1923, but the activities
and even the purpose have
changed. Homecoming was ori-
ginally for alumni of Pitt, who
returned to visit friends and
spend an exciting day at their
alma mater. However, through
the years it has become an activ-
ity more for the students,
though many alumni return for
the game.

An event that once lasted only a
weekend included a parade, a

Homecoming ’83 is On Broadway

bon fire — pep rally on Friday
night, and a dance held in the
Commons Room of the Cathe-
dral of Learning on Saturday
night following the afternoon
game. Homecoming has since
expanded to include a beef
roast, Bar night, a carnival, keg
roll and a concert instead of a
dance.

One tradition that has lasted is
that of having a Homecoming
Queen. Beginning in 1977 stu-
dents could vote for a king as
well as a queen. There were
posters and painted sheets in the
Tower's Lobby and hanging
from dorm windows trying to
influence voters on Tuesday,
October 25th. Some even wore
t-shirts endorsing their candi-
date, while all voters received a
painter's hat with “Pitt is it” im-
printed on the top.

Rena Chiaverina and Bill Beach
were voted the 1983 Homecom-
ing King and Queen. Rena, a

junior, represented Engineer-
ing. Bill is a senior Econ-Busi-
ness major, who was nominated
to represent the Track team
without his knowledge. They
staged an effective campaign
which included a sheet Stating
“Support your local Beach —
vote Bill Homecoming King.”

Originally held on Friday the
day before the game, the Home-
coming parade is now held on
Thursday evening. It included
ﬂoats, bands and drum corps

from area high schools. Student
organizations and dorms such
as Hand-in-Hand and Tower B
made banners. Floats, made
mostly by fraternities and so-
rorities were built according to
certain standards, and judged
on presentation, construction,
theme, originality, design and
color coordination. Themes of
floats varied from Broadway
musicals to New York itself.

Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

A never ending stream of activities fill Homecoming

week

With the amount of activities
available during Homecoming
week, it was hard to choose
where to go and what to do.
Traditional activities along
with new ones were held. Some
cost money, some were free,
while one even saved money.
For the first time, on Tuesday
October 25th a Beef-it-Up was
held under a tent on the Cathe-
dral lawn. Students could get a
roast beef sandwich, potato
chips, pretzels, fruit and a can of
pop for $3.50. A souvenir cup
with the schedule of events for

 

Homecoming was also includ-

ed.

David Brenner, well known for
his stand-up comedy, and for
hosting the Tonight Show, ap-
peared on Friday, October 28th
at Carnegie Music Hall. For the
student price of $5.00, the audi-
ence was treated to an enjoyable
evening of Mr. Brenner’s jokes
and stories. His stories ranged
from visits to his brother’s
house, to almost being arrested
for jaywalking in Los Angeles.
One story about sharks took al-
most thirty minutes to tell, be-
cause he kept stopping to tell
other stories. One group in the
balcony, eager to hear the end,
kept yelling to Mr. Brenner to
finish his shark story.

Billy Price and the Keystone
Rhythm Band, Pittsburgh Mu-
sic Magazine’s artist of the year,
held a free concert at the carni-
val on Thursday October 27th.
Some chose to stand back and
listen to the rhythm and blues
sound of Billy Price, while oth-
ers decided that dancing was
the best was to enjoy their even-

mg.

Wednesday evening, October
26th was Pitt Night in Oakland.
Commonly known as Bar night,
anyone wearing a Pitt t-shirt
could buy drinks at happy-hour
prices at a number of Oakland
bars. Participating bars includ-
ed Zelda’s Greenhouse, Thirs-
ty’s, Danny’s and many more (of
course an_ID was required.)

Homecoming 73

Students from various organiza-
tions, dorms, fraternities, so-
rorities along with friends com-
peted in the Almost Anything
Goes Contest and the Carnival.
They had booths at the carnival,
which was held Thursday under
the tent on the Cathedral lawn
following the pep rally. These
booths were judged on creativ-
ity, originality, and crowd
pleasing ability; most of them
were based on Broadway musi-
cals. Some of the booths sold
food while others entertained
the crowd with games such as
the one by the Nursing Student
Organization. Based on the cur-
rent Broadway musical Cats, the
object ofthis game was to throw
a mouse into a cardboard cat’s
mouth. Profits from this booth
as well as most, benefited the
organization. 1st place winner
was The Society of Women En-
gineers, who had a food booth,
and second place was the Nurs-
ing Student Organization.

On Friday afternoon October

 

74 Homecoming

Let The Memories Begin

Students participated in activities for fun and profit

28th, teams of four students
gathered on the Cathedral lawn
for the annual Almost Anything
Goes competition. Beginning as
merely a keg roll (with Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar being a
champion keg roller), it now
consists of an obstacle course,
which included the keg roll, eat-
ing a banana, holding a balloon
between your legs and other hi-
larious tasks. The winning team
consisted of members of Lamb-

da Chi Alpha.

The week ended with a victory
over Syracuse in the football
game. Though not winning by
much (13-10), it served as a
place for the memories to begin.
Students walked away from the
game on Saturday October 29
with not only a victory but also
many memories from the past
week. The King and Queen had
been announced during half-
time, along with winners from
other events. They may have
been winners or losers, perhaps

ran a booth at the Carnival or
maybe planned the keg roll.
They could have even built a
float, or just enjoyed David
Brenner. But whoever they
were, it was hard not to be in-
volved in Homecoming. There
was so much planning, partici-
pating and enjoying that one
could do. Whatever your choice
was, you’ll always remember
the week Pitt became Broad-

way.

Homecoming 75

REVISIONS

Revisions. The word conjures
up images of updating the old,
scratching out the incorrect,
tearing down the useless and
the promise of worthy change.
Revision and change. Two
words destined to be said in the
same breath. For it is a state-
ment of equality and a causal
effect, one without the other
will never make the declaration
true.

 

The year 1984 had its destiny
determined long before it ar-
rived, thanks to a man by the
name of George Orwell. it was
to be a time of “Big Brother
watching” and floundering
originality. But, fortunately, it
was a changeable destiny. And,
it did change. Revise.

“Re-" prefix meaning again. Ev-
erything we do, we can “re"-do
it. Reacquire, reappear, rear-
range, retype, reerect, reexper-
ience, reset, rejuvenate. The op-
tion is alway there. By way of a
mere two letters, we can gain a
second chance to better our
first round attempts. it is a com-
modity we take too lightly, but
one which would be sorely
missed if the privilege of its
use was taken away. Neverthe-
less, it is usually for the better.
It changes. Revisions.

More than years in the past, the
words change and revision are
prevalent. A quick glance
around proves that. Budget
cuts, increased environmental
preservation, a Presidential
race with a strong black candi-
date, women’s rights, the com-
ing of the computer age. And
closer to home, the new Stu-
dent Union, frats on the hill,
Mervis Hall, the Oxford Center
downtown, reconstruction of
parkways, ‘dry rush‘, and the
pizza wars.

And so we can reach the conclu-

sion that the seeds of the re
have been planted in the year.

4 Introduction/Revisions

Weekends

Weekends were made for . . .

 

Variety of on and off campus activities give students a
break from studying

Fraternity parties are a college
tradition. When one thinks of
college weekends, fraternity
parties are often the first thing
to enter the mind. Pitt is no ex-
ception in keeping up this “tra-
dition.” Fraternity parties are a
free (or very inexpensive) way
to drink, dance, meet people
and just have a good time.
Greeks and independents are
welcome at most parties. Dur-
ing fall rush (once dry rush is
over) Pitt’s fraternities pull out
all the stops and create large
parties that sometimes have a
theme. This year we had Purple
Passion Punch, Toga, Beach,
Hotel, and Hawaiian parties to
spice up our weekends.

Students can also have great
times at Oakland’s bars. Zel-
da’s, Peter’s Pub, the Sanctuary,
and the Keg are the closest to
the Pitt campus. All feature hap-
py hours and special nights —
like beer for a quarter and tacos
at Zelda’s. The Sanctuary is ex-
cellent for dancing and features
live music. The Keg is smaller
and perhaps a little more civil-
ized. For people who don’t get
“carded”, the bar scene is a lit-
tle more expensive than a frater-
nity, but it’s just as fun.

Saturday afternoons are often
for shopping or sightseeing in
the Pittsburgh area. Downtown,
Pitt students have visited the
new PPG Place, the new Ox-
ford Centre, Kaufmann’s, and
other large, expensive stores.
Station Square, the Gateway
Clipper, the inclines, Fort Pitt,
the Golden Triangle, and the
museums are other choice
sights to visit in the area. Shady-
side is a smaller area of Pitts-
burgh, but closer to campus
with its own interesting aspects.
Beautiful homes and unique
shops line the streets of Shady-
side for a nice change from
Oakland. There are many dif-
ferent stores and points of inter-
est for Pitt students to explore
away from campus.

For low cost entertainment Pitt
students can see recent and
older movies right on campus.
On weekends, movies are usual-
ly shown in the David Lawrence
Auditorium for only one dollar
with a Pitt ID. This is an alter-

Pittsburgh is also a haven for
the concert goer. This past year
has included such concerts as
Duran Duran, Loverboy, Billy
Idol, Adam Ant, Billyjoel, Gen-
esis, Van Halen, Moody Blues,
Culture Club, and Ozzy Os-
borne.‘ Local bands are also
popular at places like Heaven
where Pitt students saw such
bands as the Romantics, the
Houserockers, and The B.E.
Taylor Group. Pittsburgh offers
a wide variety of music for every
listening pleasure.

The Pitt campus has its own fa-
cilities that are open on week-
ends for students. The Student
Union features ping-pong and
pool tables. Trees Hall offers a
variety of activities for those in-
terested in physical fitness and
sports. Also Schenley Park has
many outdoors seasonal activi-
ties. Pitt is a campus with a wide
range of interesting areas that
are just waiting to be explored
by Pitt students on the week-
ends.

Noise!
Pitt fans help

Panthers with wins

The Pitt football and basketball
teams had a major advantage
over their opponents this sea-
son: the support of the Pitt stu-
dents.

The students always came
equipped to cheer at every
game, whether that meant
bringing buttons with Pitt logos
on them, noisemakers, or just
their loud voices. Through the
hot sun of late summer and the
cold wind of winter during foot-
ball games, to the enclosed
overcrowded Fitzgerald Field-
house for the basketball games,
the students were always behind
the two teams; they never gave
up on them.

In the football game against
Syracuse, Pitt was losing with
30 seconds left in the game, with
Syracuse in control of the ball.
The Pitt students were instru-
mental in the Panther’s come-

back to win the game by staying
and cheering the team on while
most other fans had left.

The basketball team also knows
the magic and the noise the stu-
dents can create. In their over-
time win against St. ]ohn’s, an
old archrival, the students’ en-
thusiasm throughout the game
put faith in the minds of the
players. The players knew they
could play their best in overtime
and come out on top. The stu-
dents were ecstatic when Pitt
upset St. _]ohn’s in the Big East
win.

With this type of support how
could the football and basket-
ball teams go wrong? The stu-
dents supported the football
team to the Fiesta Bowl against
Ohio State and supported the
basketball team to the NIT

tournament.

   
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  

The football season, as usual,
ended with a game against that
old archrival Penn State. The
game brought with it a sense of
unity among all the Pitt stu-
dents. They all wanted one
thing —- to beat Penn State
which would prove to Joe Pa-
terno that Pitt’s win over Notre
Dame was no fluke.

Some students showed their

Where’s the Fluke?

The students carried their en-
thusiasm into Pitt Stadium on
Saturday, November 19, 1983.
Once inside and with the game
underway, the student section
was on fire. Everyone cheered
as loud as they possibly could,
as they tried to get the Pitt play-
ers psyched enough to move the
football down the field. They
succeeded. Pitt was winning
with one minute to go in the

 
 
 
 
 
 
  

to a pep rally on the Friday be-
fore the game. Led on by the Pitt
cheerleaders, the Pitt Band and
the Golden Girls, the students
got together to show the foot-
ball players how much they
were behind them. Many others
enjoyed a car parked on the Ca-
thedral of Learning Lawn. This
was not an ordinary car, it was
painted with many phrases and
choice words for the Penn State
players and fans, and served as a
symbol that Pitt wanted to de-
stroy Penn State. Students took
hold of “sledgehammers” and
smashed the car to pieces.

game with Penn State in control
of the football. The students in
anticipation of a win, gathered
onto the football field sidelines.
As the clock ticked down to
zero, everyone poured onto the
field as they thought the game
was over and that Pitt came out
on top, but the referees disa-
greed. Six seconds were put
back on the game clock, just
enough time for Penn State to
score and tie the game at 24
points each. The students and
Pitt players walked away from
the field in disappointment and
disbelief; only one thing was on
their minds: Was this game a

80 Activities/Engineers’ Week

A week — 7 days lasting from
Sunday through Saturday. For
engineering students this means
5 days of classes till 4 pm, labs at
8 am and weekends that aren’t
even worth mentioning. But one
particular week in March is
slightly different. This week in-
volves a giant Monopoly game,
a soap box derby and cars made
from Coke Cans. With a bit of
the Irish luck it will be enough
to forget about computer pro-
grams and lab reports.

The 30th Engineer’s Week be-
gan on Sunday March 11 with
an Engineering Open House in
Benedum Hall and Auditorium.
The central theme is always St.
Patrick’s Day because it falls on
that week each year. Each year
there is another theme in which
the floats, and game night
booths are based on; this year it
was Cartoons. The Open House
began at 3 pm and provided an
opportunity for parents and oth-
er people to see exactly what

various departments do within
the Engineering School. A pre-
sentation in the auditorium was
followed by demonstrations
throughout the building by the
departments. A blood drive was
held on Monday and Tuesday
March 12 and 13 from 10 am to
4 pm in the Canteen on the first
floor of Benedum Hall.

On Tuesday evening students
their cars powered by a Coke
can. This event called Enginuity
began at 7 pm in Benedum
Auditorium and is the event in
which students could show off
their talents at making some-
thing out of nothing. Those who
wished to participate were to
make a car, the only require-
ment was that it was powered by
a Coke can. Electrical Engi-
neer’s came in first with their
theme of Flintstones, Miners
(Hagar the Horrible) and
Chemicals (Peanuts) were sec-
ond and third.

Game night consisted of various
casino booths that followed the
cartoon chosen by the depart-
ment that ran it. It was held on
Tuesday night from 6 to 10 pm
on the 4-7th floors of Benedum
Hall. Tickets were used instead
of money to play the games.
Each department was given so
many tickets at the beginning of
the evening, then at the end of
the night all the tickets each
booth received were collected.
These were weighed and the
largest amount Won. Industrials
whose theme was Mickey
Mouse won first place. Second
place went to Miners and Elec-
trical third. Also at game night
a large Monopoly game filling
an entire room was set up. In-
stead of Boardwalk and Park
Place, the places were Pitt
buildings like the Chem Build-
ing and the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. Benedum, of.course, was
the highest priced property.

Thursday’s Events

For every event that takes place,
there is much planning and
work to be done. For Engineer-
ing Week it’s the Engineering
Student Cabinet and all those
who helped on some level.
Some of the most important
work was done by those who
designed and built ﬂoats, cre-
ated the skits that went along
with the ﬂoats, and set up the
events for Gimmick. The 1984
parade, which ran throughout
the streets of Oakland, began at
10 a.m. on March 15, 1984. En-
gineering students worked for
weeks creating and building the
floats. Ideas for the ﬂoats were
pattered after the cartoon cho-
sen by the department and were
built on ﬂatbeds out of wood,

wire, crepe paper, and anything
else that would make that ﬂoat
complete. Accompanying each

ﬂoat was a skit performed by
members of the department.
The skits were short and were
done in front of the judges
standjudged on ﬂoat, costumes
and skit enthusiasm, Mickey
Mouse by Industrial Engineers
came in first place. Second and
third places went to Electricals
and Chemicals.

Arriving during the parade, St.
Patrick and St. Patricia rode in
a fire truck. The way they arrive
is different each year and is kept
a secret until the parade. john
Hutchinson, a Chemical Engi-
neer, and Janice Welker, a
Freshman, were voted by class-
mates to be St. Patrick and St.
Patricia.

After watching the parade in
the morning, students proceed-

ed to the Cathedral lawn for the
Gimmick. Gimmick is a type of
Almost Anything Goes which
includes an obstacle course,
sack race, egg toss and a tug-of-
war. Covering most of the Ca-
thedral’s lower lawn, the Gim-
mick was just as fun to watch as
it was to participate. For those
who participated it wasn’t as
easy as it looked. Many got tan-
gled up crawling under the
ropes, and found the hard way
to go down the slide on the hill.
The main event was the tug-of-
war. The overall winner of
Gimmick was Metallurgical En-
gineering whose character was
Scooby Doo, with Civils (Pac-
man) second and Miners third.

84 Activities/Engineers’ Week

Friday March 16, 1984 started
early with the soap box derby
and ended late at the Shamrock
Ball. The Annual Soap Box
Derby, held on Lytton Street,
began at 8 a.m. Each depart-
ment built their own car, which
was steered by someone in that
department. Two of the branch
campuses also participated. Ti~
tusville brought two cars and
Greensburg had one car. All
cars were powered by gravity.
judging of the cars was in four
areas. First cars were run
straight down the course on Lyt-
ton Street. Then they were driv-
en through a serpentine to mea-
sure steering. Stability was test-
ed by going over a small ramp.
By stopping on a particular
spot, the breaks were tested.
Metal1urgical’s car was able to

perform the best in all four
areas and won first place. Sec-
ond place was won by Electrical
and third by Mechanicals (Bugs
Bunny).

The Engineering Formal, com-
monly called the Shamrock Ball
was held at St. Nick’s Cathedral
until 1 a.m. for $20 a couple.
After dinner, winners ofthe var-
ious events were announced. In-
cluding those already men-
tioned two awards that covered
the entire week were an-
nounced. The first counted at-
tendance at all the events, not
just those with Competitions.
Chemicals were first, Indus-
trials second and Electricals
third. The last award given out
was the Shamrock Award. This
award for overall performance

was won by Electricals. Second
and third went to Industrials
and Chemicals.

Following the awards ceremony
the band "French Kiss” pro-
vided music for dancing.

Though this week was a bit dif-
ferent, it entailed more prepara-
tion than any other week. It is
one that will be remembered
long after the day to day rou-
tines of the other weeks each
term are forgotten. Even the stu-
dents who didn’t play an active
role in the planning or prepara-
tion but preferred to watch the
soap box derby or play games at
Games Night will always re-
member the week without
classes.

Introduction/Revisions 5

Black Week presented for students

It was a week crammed with
lectures, bazaars, debates, and
concerts as the Black Action So-
ciety presented its 14th Annual
Black Week, which ran from
November 6th to the 12th. This
year’s theme was “Unity is the
basis from which all efforts
transcend,” and a movement to-
ward more harmony among
Pitt’s individual black organiza-
tions was stressed. Black Week
was also a celebration of sorts
— it gave students a chance to
honor black people and recog-
nize their contributions to the
community.

From a program committee
consisting of approximately six-
ty members, and directed by
President Daryl Davis, the BAS
planned an exciting schedule of
events which gained national at-
tention as well as generating in-
terest from Pitt students. The
week was highlighted by
speeches from Angela Davis,
Stokely Carmichael (Kwame
Ture), Dr. Benjamin Hooks,
Dick Gregory, and Gil Scott-
Heron. Speaking openly on
controversial issues such as hu-
man rights and black political
affiliations, these lectures came
from unique and diverse back-
grounds. Angela Davis is a well
known activist, professor and
the 1984 vice-presidential can-
didate for the Central Commit-
tee of the U.S. Communist Par-
ty. She spoke against anti-com-

propaganda and
discussed her views on the po-

litical situation in Grenada.

munist

Kwane Ture, also a civil and hu-
man rights activist, is the cur-
rent leader of the All African
People’s Revolutionary Party
and originator of the popular
phrase “Black Power”. He
called on all blacks to unite and
form organizations as a means
of combatting oppression.

The present executive director
of the NAACP, Dr. Benjamin
Hooks also spoke to a large
crowd in the Student Union
Ballroom. He is a former crimi-
nal judge and Baptist minister
from Memphis, Tennessee.

Both Dick Gregory and Gil
Scott-Heron emphasized the
importance of the black vote
and urged students to register to
vote. Mr. Gregory’s abilities in-
clude comedian, human rights
activist, social satirist, philos-
opher and recording artist. Gil
Scott-Heron is a man who ex-
presses his political views
through his music and prefers to
be called a “bluesologist.” He
returned to Pitt after a positive
response from a lecture last
year. Adding more musical vari-
ety to the week’s activities was
Noel Pointer, who gave an im-
pressive concert in David Law-
rence Auditorium on Novem-
ber 11, 1983. Mr. Pointer is a

nationally known concert vio-
linist.

On November 9th, the BAS
held a bazaar and art show with
a variety of displays and hand-
crafted items for sale in the
Forbes Quad Galleria. The
whole week ended in a lively so-
cial on November 12, 1983 in
the Galleria, celebrating a new
sense of unity.

Organization plans activities for members

The Black Action Society of the
University of Pittsburgh is
aimed at promoting the inter-
ests of black students on campus
and in the community. Besides
their annual Black Week, BAS
also sponsors several other
worthwhile events.

One crowd pleaser held on De-
cember Znd was the Fashion/
Talent Show, one of several
events during Ebony Extrava-
ganza Weekend. A Greek Step
Competition held in Benedum
Hall on December 3rd raised
money for the African Heritage
Classroom building fund. Pro-
ceeds are to be used for con-
struction of a new Nationality
Room.

 

In conjunction with Martin Lu-
ther King,_]r. Day, BAS invited
civil rights leader Yolanda
King to speak on january 12th
in Heinz Chapel. February
proved to be a busy month, as it
was Black History Month. BAS
adopted the theme “Black Con-
sciousness: New fuel for an old
fire” and sponsored several ex-
hibits which included blacks in
creative arts, black Professional
Women, Blacks in Politics,
Medicine, Engineering, Educa-
tion, plus many more categor-
ies. All of these exhibits were
displayed in the Towers Lobby
during the week of February 15
and were put together with the
help of fraternities and sorori-
ties.

On February 15, a march and
rally emanated from the Cathe-
dral Lawn and city. On the 17th,
Pitt was honored to co-host the
famous Melba Moore in con-
cert. Singing her hits “Keeping
My Lover Satisfied” and “The
Other Side of the Rainbow”,
Moore thrilled a large audience
with her performance in the
Carnegie Music Hall.

A Mr. and Mrs. BAS pageant
held on March 24th produced
winners Sharon Woodward and
Walter Capps, and on April
28th a Senior Recognition Din-
ner sponsored by BAS was held
in the Student Union.

You Gotta
Have Heart

Nursing Students show they care

Nursing week was not only for
Pitt’s approximately 600 nurs-
ing students but many events
were also for other Pitt students
and professional nurses. Nurs-
ing week is for gaining and giv-
ing knowledge and for having
fun with fellow students. This
year’s theme, “You Gotta Have
Heart,” brought the otherwise
isolated nursing students a little
closer with the main campus to
show off their knowledge and
help a little at the same time.

Nursing Week began with Pri-
mary Prevention Day in the
Towers’ Lobby on Monday
March 5, 1984. The purpose of
this day was to make students
aware of how to prevent many
common illnesses. Sophomore
nursing students were in the
Towers’ Lobby from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m. taking blood pressures
and passing out information.
Students wore their full uni-
form, while they passed out in-
formation on a variety of sub-
jects, ranging from high blood
pressure to weight loss. They
also answered many questions
in a multitude of areas. Nursing
students who didn’t participate

in Primary Prevention Day,
wore their favorite nursing
sweater or sweatshirt to kick off
the first day of nursing week.
Students were also on hand on
Thursday at the Information
Booth in Victoria Hall.

On Tuesday and Wednesday,
students were also in the giving
spirit. This time it was blood for
the annual blood drive. This
drive is known as one of the
largest on campus.

The lectures were presented for
free to anyone interested. All
lectures were presented in
Room 125, where almost all
nursing classes are held. Attor-
ney Daniel Kennedy spoke on
Tuesday March 6. He discussed
"Malpractice and How to
Avoid it.” Now that nurses are
also being sued, his lecture was

important to all students. “Sur- .

viving Breast Cancer” was dis-
cussed by jane Kart R.N. Ms.
Kart provided information that
was helpful in dealing with pa-
tients and family members with
breast cancer. In Vitro Fertil-

ization has brought new hope
for parents who were previously

, unable to conceive. It has also

brought up many moral and
ethical concerns. Dr. Paul Zar-
utskie, who has brought this
new technique to Magee Wom-
en’s Hospital, discussed it on
Thursday.

The last two events were just for
the fun and enjoyment of the stu-
dents. Friday afternoon the Al-
most Anything Goes was held in
Victoria Lobby. The event con-
sisted of an obstacle course.

One had to get in and out of
scrub suits, carry a bedpan
blindfolded and race wheel-
chairs while keeping a cap on.
First place winner was judith
Harvilla a junior, Tom Skelly
and Lisa Puntureri, both sopho-
mores, came in second and
third.

The Semi-Formal was held on
Saturday at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel in Downtown Pittsburgh.
Following dinner, Mr. G., a
hypnotist worked his “magic”
on those in attendance. Once

the guests had their fill of em-
barrasing moments, they were
free to dance to the music pro-
vided by a DJ. or go next door
to a bar mitzvah for champagne.

8 Months Already?

83-84. Year ends

The year that while going
through it we thought would
never end, did. Shouldn’t we be
moving in instead of moving
out? Things that we feel like we
just unpacked are being packed
again. We were standing in line
outside Holland Hall selling
back our books that seemed like
we only bought last week. For
those returning in the fall, the
end of the winter term meant
registering again. Registering
at Pitt always entails endless
running between advisors and
professors and standing in lines
hoping the classes aren’t can-

celled. April always means end-.

less forms to fill out for graduat-
ing seniors. The Class of ’84 had
forms for caps and gowns, com-
mencement and of course those
all important applications for
jobs.

April also means the Spring
Fling. Unfortunately the weath-
er wasn’t too springy. But even
though it was rainy and cold,
everyone was ready for warm
weather and sunny days. Spring
Fling started out with the final
special dinner of the year in the
cafeteria on Thursday March
29, 1984. The Pudding Wres-
tling, which was to be\held in

the Quad on Thursday, was res-
cheduled for Tuesday, April 3.
Both male and female students
wrestled in this variation of the
more popular mud wrestling.
Though they came out covered
with pudding all participants
had a lot of fun doing something
their mothers’ told them not to
do — playing in their food. The
usual softball, volleyball and
street hockey tournaments were
held on various fields around
campus. New for this year was
an Art Show of student talent in
the William Pitt Union Art Gal-
lery. On Friday March 29 a
dance was held in the Assembly

Room of the WPU. Roller
skates were available on Satur-
day evening in the Quad for stu-
dents to rent. Music was pro-
vided for the skaters by WPGH,
which will be going to FM in
the fall and becoming WPTS.
The Almost Anything Goes was
on Sunday April 1, 1984 in the
Quad. Events included an egg
toss, water balloon toss, water-
melon eating contest, spoon on
a string contest, M&M on a
spoon race, egg between the
knees race, and a Where’s the
Beef contest.

Many of the separate schools
and organizations held their
own ceremonies to honor their
graduating seniors. The Black
Action Society had its Annual
Senior Recognition Dinner on
April 20, 1984.

All Engineering seniors who
graduated in December or
would graduate in April or dur-
ing the summer were honored at
the Engineering Senior Recog-
nition Night on Saturday April
28 at Soldiers and Sailors Me-
morial Hall. Each department’s
outstanding senior was honored
and that senior announced each
of the seniors in their depart-
ment along with that student’s
activities, honors and awards.
The outstanding senior had the

option of giving out surprise
awards. Following the ceremo-
ny, a reception was held up-
stairs. Seniors were given the
chance to reminisce with
friends, parents, professors and
alumni on the night before
graduation.

For Nursing students in the
class of 1984, April 19 will al-
ways he remembered as the start
of their nursing careers. The
Pinning Ceremony began with a
candlelight procession led by
underclassmen in the tradition-
al blue and white uniforms into
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall’s auditorium. After the
seniors and families were wel-
comed by Acting Dean Jane E.
Knox, they were congratulated

by Nathan}. Stark, Senior Vice
Chancellor of the Health Sci-
ences. Then Roberta Ann De-
ter, the 1983 Keeper of the
Light, passed the light on to Pa-
tricia Rumancik, the 1984
Keeper. The Keeper of the
Light is the graduating senior
who has attained the highest
grade in the class for bedside
nursing as indicated by the re-
cord of nursing» practice. The
Passing of the Light has been a
tradition at Pinning since 1943.

Following the Passing of the
Light, Miss Ellen E. Chaffee ad-
dressed the class. Miss Chaffee
is nationally known for her
book Basic Anatomy. At Pitt,
Miss Chaffee has been known
and loved as an instructor at the

School of Nursing for over 30
years and will retire this year.
Her address followed the four
years of a Pitt nursing student.
As was her style in Anatomy and
Physiology, she told many jokes
and funny stories. She also
thanked the graduates for intro-
ducing her to a stripper on
their last day of class.

After the address, graduates
were pinned by ~'Acting Dean
Knox and Assistant Dean Pa-
mela Hepple. A reception was
held in the Commons Room of
the Cathedral of Learning im-
mediately following the cere-
mony for the approximately 160
nurses and their families.
