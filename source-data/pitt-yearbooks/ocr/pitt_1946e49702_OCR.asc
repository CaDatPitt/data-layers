FOREWORD

In the pages which follow we have attempted to preserve in
picture and in print something of Pitt as we have known her this
first post-war year. The war was over. V—E and V-1 Day were
fast becoming memories. We were entering a new era. This era,
this first post—war year at Pitt was her chance to make her "back-
to-normal" advances. Gone was the black paint that had dark-
ened the Oakland view from the cathedral windows; the air raid
drills with the buckets of sand and their "in case of air raid"
signs; the air corps and the AST's and finally Co. C at Christmas;
gone too were the days when the Tuck Shop looked as though
this was the University of Pittsburgh for women. Returned now
were hundreds of veterans; big time politics, a vets review that
gave promise of cap and gown shows to come; formals with
favors; crowded Tuck Shops; again a ratio of five men to one
Woman; spring festival with its pre—war elaborateness; classes
on the second and third floors; the marching band at football
games; inactive fraternities and organizations; stag lines at the
"Get Acquainted" dances. Pitt was on the road "back—to-normal,"
and with this theme in mind the staff set out to keep alive the
memory of Pitt's first "back-to—normal" year. And so, if in future
years a word herein suggests a happy memory or a face recalls
a friend; if a scene revives old surroundings or a snapshot brings
back a vivid incident of these student days; then this book shall
have accomplished its purpose.

PRESIDENT BOWMAN

A MESSAGE FROM OUR PRESIDENT

To The Owl, l946

You ask for a Greeting. In answer, at first it seemed that Hello,
if said just right, would be Greeting enough. Any more might
spoil it. And now, after thinking for a while, Hello still seems
enough. But because I must write the word rather than say it a
bit of explanation may be needed. My Hello means that I like you
and am dead-pleased if you like me. lt means all hail goodwill
and kindness to you. lt means that you and l are trying to keep
all the nobility in us up on top and it means that we are glad in
such a way of doing.

Hello——and as we say to one another Hello. I hope that at no
place on earth can there be more meaning packed into a word.

Iohn G. Bowman
President of the University

The Norwegian Room, newest of Pitt's famed
Nationality Rooms was finished in the fall
of 1945. Showing the work of seven years, the
room represents the Norwegian Eighteenth
Century. Built entirely of wood with the ex-
ception oi the fireplace which is made of Kleber
stone, the room is typically Norwegian with a
color scheme of blue and orange floral design.

The paneling was all hand painted.

THE STAFF

CHANCELLOR FITZGERALD

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CHANCELLOR

To the Students:

You who are graduating have seen many changes at the University since
you came as freshmen. Five years ago the University was operating on a
peacetime program. After that it was called upon to meet a war emergency.
This it did with its program of "Training to Win". Ten thousand young men
and women were trained to be physically, mentally, and spiritually fit for
the responsibilities which they would meet in war. You recall soldier students
of Air Crew, Area and Language studies, Personnel Psychology, Civil Affairs
Training, Engineering, Medicine, and Dentistry. They marched and sang
and went on to their grim tasks. Then, the surrender of japan brought veterans
to the campus in large numbers. As this is being written early in the second
semester approximately four thousand veterans are here. They are older,

more serious, more determined.

As you have progressed toward your goal you have adjusted yourselves
to all these changes in a remarkable way. Our country now needs you with
your youth, vigor, and ability to adjust. it needs your laughter, optimism,
and strength. You will go forth in a world which has been brought together
overnight by war, transportation and communication. Barriers have been
erased. You must think in terms of a world in which boundaries between
oceans, continents, islands, nations, and states are broken down. Understand-

ing and good will and tolerance must replace ignorance and hate and prejudice.

We are proud to have had a share in your development.
R. H. Fitzgerald

ADMINIS

THE REGISTRAR

Post—War days have meant busier days to Dr. 1.
Gilbert Quick, University registrar. With thousands of
vets returning to school, Pitt's enrollment is larger today
that it has ever been, and Dr. Quick arose to meet this

emergency in his usual efficient manner.

First appointed assistant registrar, Dr. Quick be-
came registrar in 1916, Since then Dr. Quick has had
definite objectives for his work. To improve the quality
of the students and to maintain high school relations,
he himself conducts the interviews for honor scholar-
ships. Under his guidance the mechanics of enrollment
have been simplified. Pitt was the first school to adopt
In addition to his
duties as registrar, Dr. Quick is also a member of the

blueprint transcription of grades.

American Association of Collegiate Registrars. In l945
he was granted the honorary degree of Doctor of
Pedagogy from Westminster College.

THE SECRETARY

Peacetime to Dr. Iohn Weber, Secretary of the Uni-
versity, means "keeping Pitt abreast of the times." A
Pitt graduate, Mr. Weber was made an instructor in
mechanical engineering in l9lO,- later, after taking time
out to serve as a captain in World War l, he became
head of the department, As supervising engineer of
the University, he helped in the building of the Ca-
thedral.

In recognition of his executive ability, Mr. Weber
was made Secretary of the University in 1936. His
administrative duties, however, have not caused him
to neglect details of construction. Mr. Weber is looking
ahead to the time when the Cathedral, as the center of
University life, will be used for liberal arts alone, scien-
tific courses being removed to_ new buildings.

THE GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

The graduation of a Pitt students marks a transition
from the undergraduate world to the greater world of the
alumnus. The graduate will always have a memory of,
and an interest in the University of which he was once a
part. Made up of ten constituent alumni groups, the Gen-
eral Alumni Association was formed to keep this interest
ever alive and growing. Last year its activities included
a dinner-bridge, the yearly Christmas party for the children

Ruth Lee Dierker, Treasurer

of the faculty and alumni, and the traditional sponsorship
of Charter Day. To keep those far away aware of alumni
and of University activities, the Alumni Review is publish-
ed four times each year. In recent years the war curtailed
some of the association's activities, but with over one
thousand of its members returning from overseas, the
Association believes that "Back—to—Normal" means a larger
and more active membership.

DEPARTMENT HEADS

To the department heads falls the responsibility of seeing
that the spirit of Pitt is fostered within the students. Because of
the close scholastic association, they are keenly aware of the
attitudes and hopes of the student body as a whole
and represent these attitudes and hopes to the University ad-
ministrative body. In that sense they are the liason between
student and university with a responsibility to both. They must
fairly represent the ideals of the University and the wishes of
the student. They must seek at all times to wisely administer
the duties of their position. They must temper the emergencies
of the present with the hopes for the future. They must plan for
the future as well as act for the present well being of the student
and the University. Their job is large, the demands great but
their capabilities are more than sufficient. These are our de-
partment heads: Whitford H. Shelton, languages...Elmer D.

Robert L. Arthur George W. Hoffman

"It looks like old times," remarked a former University
student recently during a Visit to the Dean of Men's office.
Like many others Who have returned to their studies from
all corners of the world, this veteran saw the Dean and his
assistants again supervising the many activities that were so
much a part of his University life before he went to war.
This year many of the organizations that were forced to go
inactive during the War have come back to Pitt. These num-
erous student activities and the problems of more than 4,000
veterans have made the Dean's office the largest that it
has ever been. A typical hour in 80 may find a veteran hav-
ing an admission interview, a fraternity president checking
the list of rushees, a dance chairman arranging a ticket sales,
a reporter from one of the publications getting facts for a
story, a graduate relating his service experiences to his
friend, Dean Biddle, and a Student Congress committee dis-
cussing plans for a rally. With the return of "old times" this
past year, the Dean of Men's office found new opportunities
and interests in its relations with the student body.

HELEN POOL RUSH

DEAN OF WOMEN

Now that the war is over, and men have re—
turned to the campus in large numbers, the
women are once again in the minority. This
calls for adjustments on the part of the women.
Classrooms, corridors, and Tuck Shops are so
crowded that space is at a premium. The women
will have to yield some places of leadership.
But the gains are far greater than the losses.
The advantages of coeducation are theirs again
—a chance to work and play with the men,
a chance to think together on common problems.
This is the essence of student life in the Uni-
Versity.

Pitt women, entering the post—war period
with plans and dreams of further building
of both school and social life, look to the
Office of the Dean of Women for the "re-
turn to normal."

Miss Helen Pool Rush, Dean of Women,
has noted the trend back to the schools

‘ as wartime employment standards are
replaced by higher qualifications. In ob-
serving the changes the new peace is
bringing, Dean Rush viewed the return to
normal not as a retracing of the pattern of
the pre—war days, but as a return to the
conditions which promote progress.

An increased social program was plan-
ned by Miss Harriet Glasser, who advised
the girls about outside activities. Nation-
ality Room hostesses are being trained by
Miss Mary T. Walton. Miss Elizabeth Teal
is handling the employment and housing
difficulties that arise during the change to
normal conditions.

Mrs. Iohn Ross is at the desk in the
information room; and Miss Ruth Becker
and Mrs. Lucy Millard, secretaries, are
keeping the correspondence in order. The
Office of the Dean of Women is Well
equipped to meet the new demands placed Mrs. Millard and Miss Becker
upon it by this back to normal atmosphere. Miss Robinson, Miss Walton and Mrs. Ross

FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY
OF WOMEN AT PITT

We the students of the University have heard Stein Sisters,
Twelfth Floor and Piftieth Anniversary many times this year, for
this year is the Fiftieth Anniversary of Women at Pitt. For during
the fifty years since Stella and Margaret Stein entered Pitt, women
have been given equal education in all fields, opportunity to
prove their ability and the right to stand side by side with men
in the University. Now there are women in every course offered
by the University and they have made a place for themselves in
University life. In activities or studies, they are always eager to
do their share of the work. This year Pitt women had as their goal
the finishing of the Twelfth Floor. The twelfth floor is where Pitt
women may go to read and relax, study and plan for teas and
parties. Miss Helen Poole Rush, our Dean of Women is ever
present to see the girls retain the high standards that are identified
in Pitt women. Chancellor Fitzgerald wishes the women at Pitt
to succeed. He supported and attended the Nixon Benefit. Our

girls study, work, and laugh together. A part of Pitt, our WOMEN.

PITT COEDS 1896-1946

"We celebrate the past, and we look forward
to the future," said Chancellor Holland at the cele-
bration of the 110th anniversary of the University in
1897. Two years before he spoke, and fifty years ago
in the fall of 1895, two young women had stepped
aboard a streetcar. They were Stella and Margaret
Stein on their way to attend classes at the Western
University of Pennsylvania, then located on Perrys-
ville Avenue in Allegheny City. Their presence
so surprised the new students that the 1895 forerun-
ner of the 1945 wolf call was long coming, but when
it did come, the Stein sisters were fondly referred to as
"specimens." They had caught the school unpre-
pared and Chancellor Holland was forced to give
them his rooms in which to spend their free hours
and to follow the studies of the Latin-Scientific Course.
Their activities consisted of Membership in the Phi-
loniathiau Literary Society and attendance at musical
concerts and rival games between W and I and
WUP, Margaret and Stella graduated in the class
of '98, and walked away with the honors open to
them~Stella as Valedictorian and Margaret as Class
Prophet. They were pioneers in co—education and the
women at Pitt today are grateful to them.

Coeds have seen three Wars take students from
the classroom, and have watched them return. ln
1908 they saw the Western. University of Pennsylvan-
ia become the University of Pittsburgh. From 1908
to 1921 they watched the building of State, Thaw, and

Alumni Halls, and labored up the Hill to classes.
In 1926 they saw ground broken for the Cathedral
of Learning and later for Heinz Chapel and Stephen
Foster Memorial. Coeds have gone to Pitt under
the Chancellors Holland, McCormick, Bowman and
Fitzgerald. They have grown up with Pitt.

One thing only has not changed since that fall
morning in 1895. Today approximately 1300 young
women step aboard street cars to attend classes at
the University of Pittsburgh. Their presence is no
longer a curiosity, and a wolf call is frequently heard.
They aren't "specimens" any more, but a part of
the University. Women at Pitt have their own gov-
ernment, their own Dean, their own meeting places,
and promise of more. They put on glamour to
attend dances, shed it to yell a "big Alleghenee" at
football games. They can become teachers, doctors,
engineers, or follow any course the school offers.
They can become members of the orchestra, the
choir, honorary and social fraternities. They can
be class and organization officers. They can be
editors and staff members of campus publications.
They can be Senior Queen and Alma Mater. Coeds
are scholars and dreamers and pioneers. The school
and the world are theirs to conquer and to better.
So, on the 50th Anniversary of Vlomen at Pitt, we
the school year of 1945-46, coeds repeat Chancellor
Holland's words——"We celbrate the past, and We
look forward to the future."

CLASSES

We come to the University eagerly every tall. The boys go
to camp and the girls get green armbands and both learn the

traditions and customs of the University. We are the Freshmen.

We come to the University every fall for the first time as upper-
classmen. We are ready to go into activities now and really take

our place in University life. We are the Sophomores.

We come to the University every fall to do our part so that We
may be able to call ourselves seniors. We start on our advanced
courses and learn the things necessary to takeover the helm

when the seniors leave. We are the luniors.

We come to the University every fall realizing that this is our
last year at Pitt. lt is an exciting but sad thought. We finish our
majors and leave our positions to the next class. We are the

Seniors.

Freshmen, Sophomores, Iuniors, and Seniors, we all cherish

the Fireside Chats where we can discuss our problems with our

Chancellor, Dr. Fitzgerald. A part of PITT, our CLASSES.

THE SENIOR CLASS

We are the class of l946—this is our class, this
has been our year. We, as a class, have traveled
along the same college road for four years now.
Some of us have gathered many honors along the
way, others only a few. We've worked on dance
committees, war bond committees, class committees;
we've sung in the choir together; we've had luncheon
dates together; we've pledged fraternity together;
we've gone to a hundred and one dinners together;
we've ushered together at Chancellor's Receptions,
Pan Hel Receptions; we've gone to dances together;
We've watched the transition in one another from
the time we were part of a mentor group or upperclass
counselor group until the time When we were mentors
and upperclass counselors. Now we were the Seniors.
This was a little difficult to realize at first for we felt
no older and not very much wiser, but now we
Were the Senior leaders and three classes were look-
ing to us to follow. So we wore high heels to practice
teach and a coat and tie to a Fireside Chat with the

Chancellor. Again this Senior idea "hit" us, for we
were doing so many things for the "last" time: our
last class; our last pep rally, our last chapel, our
last lnterclass Sing; our last football game; our
last Senior Court meeting; our last rushing season;
our last Student Congress meeting; our last frat
meeting. Then the last minute rush of writing final
papers and finishing off incompletes followed by
Senior vacation and the bliss of no exam week.
After this came the pride in being a part of Corona-
tion; a last dozen dinners to attend; fitting of gown
and mortar boards; the worry of "please don't let
it rain" for graduation. Then we were together as
a class for the last time as we marched proudly up
the ramp to where Chancellor Fitzgerald handed
us our diplomas with congratulations. We walked
down the ramp and as we sat down our eyes looked
up and up and up to the top of the cathedral built
so it could ever grow. We smiled a wistful but
happy smile. We were the Senior class of 1946

Dean Vincent W. Lanfear

Rated among the top schools of business administra-
tion in the country, enrollment of veterans here for bus-
iness courses at Pitt has been especially heavy this
year. It is to friendly Dean Vincent Lanfear that these
men come for advice. One of Dean Lanfear's peacetime
plans is now being realized in the form of an expanded
transportation program offered to men and Women
studying business administration. With the other Uni-
versity schools, the School of Business Administration
is holding many evening classes to meet the large reg-
istration demands.

COLLEGE

 

Dean Stanton C. Crawford

Back to normal does not mean back to pre—war
standards to Stanton Crawford, Dean of the College,
for the college courses are constantly changing. As
he remarked, "We're doing nothing the way We did
it before." For the immediate future Dean Crawford BiO1OgYLGb_.77thGt 1S__
promises a branching out of the aviation courses and
a developing of communications program. The Col-
lege's aim, "to prepare the student for a life that is
satisfying to himself and useful to society," is stronger
now than ever before.

 

FIRST ROW’: Dr. Oliver, Dr. Shelton, Dr. Elmer, Dr. Gray, Dr. Silverman, Dr. Finney, Dean Crawford
SECOND ROW: Dr. Graper, Dr. Nystrom, Dr. Taylor, Dr. Balwin, Mr. Mayer, Dr. Bishop, Dr. Dennis

Although the organization of Dental School Inter-
Fraternity Council may seem complicated to some,
its functions and policies are clear—cut and demo-
cratic in every respect. Dental IF Council is made
up of three dental fraternities, Psi Omega, Delta Sig-
ma Delta and Alpha Omega, each having two rep-
resentatives and their faculty advisor on the Council.
The governing offices of the council are rotated be-
tween the different fraternities.

Among its other duties and functions, the council
governs rushing rules and programs, sets up IF
sports programs, and works in conjunction with
faculty representatives. Also, in time of peace, the
council works together on occasional interfraternity
social afairs, and, to some degree, is instrumental in
the organization of Dental School social affairs.

This year is a post—war year. Dental IF has striven
to uphold pre-war standards and plan for bacl<—to-
normal activity.

Alpha Omega has been established on Pitt's
campus for twenty-six years and during that time
it has overcome many hardships. The recent emer-
gency period was handled by the brothers who serv-
ed their country in and out of uniform. It was not
so long ago that undergraduates and alumni opened
the fraternity house for normal operation.

With the discharge of Service men, these new
civilians have undertaken a vigorous program to
reestablish the fun, activities, and learning of the
good old days.

The fraternities National Rehabilitation Fund
has taken away much of the worry of the brothers
who were in the service, by helping them to begin
anew with this assistance. Formal dinner—dances
are now being planned in order to make the en-
tire reconversion of the members completely back
to normal.

The members of the Delta Sigma Delta, national
dental fraternity, are pledged "to keep high standards
of dentistry by inculcating in the minds of dental
students and practitioners a spirit of fraternal co-
operation toward scientific, ethical, and professional
progress." The fraternity's professional and social
functicns are designed to further the high standards
maintained through its 64 years of activity.

The Delta Sigma Delta alumni, whose interests
during the war period were focused on military
demands, are now returning to active participation
in fraternity affairs. Their knowledge and skill is
a source of information which ably supplements the
work of the dental undergraduate and proves an
invaluable aid to the man entering professional prac-
tice.

Peace—time has again made it possible for the
fraternity house to be refurnished and decorated and
make it the center of the fraternity's campus.

Psi Omega, national dental fraternity, exerts its
influence for the advancement of the dental pro-
fession in methods of teaching, practice, and juris-
prudence. While actually a professional fraternity,
Psi Omega has its social side, as evidenced by fre-
quent house parties, formal and informal dances,
and summer picnics.

The local chapter house at 230 North Bellefield
Avenue serves as the meeting place of active chapter
members and alumni. At present there are sixty-
three active members and twenty—three of the brothers
live in the house, which was recently redecorated to
welcome back the veterans.

The dissolution of the ASTP and Navy V—l2 dental
programs has returned the boys to their normal civil-
ian status, and the shadow of the past emergency era
has almost disappeared into a bacl<—to—normal light.

Under Dean S. P. Franklin, the School of Education
is planning an expanded program for both undergradu—
ates and graduate students. The new education work-
shops on the floor of the Cathedral are proving their
Value in providing realistic training for students interest-
ed in the teaching field; plans are being made to en-
large and improve these Workshops. As a member of
the National Education Board, Dean Franklin proves
himself to be an inestimatable help to Pitt students who

C'HANCELLOR’S
RECEPTION

November thirtieth meant different things
to different people. To building and grounds
it was a successful job of making the Com-
mons Room even more beautiful. To the
Men's Glee Club it was a chance to sing
after three years of inactivity. To upper-
classmen it meant nothing but perhaps and
unwanted climb into formals to usher. To
the faculty it was a "headaching" deadline
for figuring out grades for freshmen they
had seen only twenty-four times. To the
beginning Freshman it was a hated date
when his parents would find out how poor
his grades really were. His only solace was
that they might not then at the end expect
too much. To his parents though, it was an
opportunity to meet the leaders of their sons
or daughters higher education; to find out
there is friendliness behind the cold, grey
walls of the Cathedral; to meet the Chan-
cellor himself, so revered by their offsprings.
Conclusion by all; the Chancellor was a
good host.

SCHOOL OF
ENGINEERING AND MINES

 

Dean Elmer A. Holbrook

With the faculty back to its former size, the Freshman
and Sophomore classes larger than in the past, the
Schools of Engineering and Mines are adjusting to a
student body that exceeds pre—War classes. Dean of
the school, Elmer A. Holbrook, plans to enlarge the fac-
ulty and has replaced the accelerated program with a
three semester year required of all Engineering and
Mines students. He hopes when the present Freshmen
and Sophomores are Iuniors and Seniors that life in the
Engineering Mines School will be back to normal.

For Phi Delta Epsilon, Medical School Fraternity,
the past year has been one of great activity. Now
that peace has returned they have increased all
fraternity activities to fulfill their desires to return to
normal. The former practice of holding monthly
dinner meetings with guest speakers has been re
established and a series of monthly round table
discussions of medical problems was inaugurated.
In line with their plans to return to normal their an-
nual dinner dance was held for the first time since
the beginning of the War. At this dance the outgoing
seniors are awarded keys and the newly elected
officers are installed. De-spite all these activities
scholarship was not neglected as Phi Delta Epsilon
was awarded the Medical School lntertraternity
Council Scholarship Plaque. The "reconversion
spirit" has indeed taken over in Nu Chapter of Phi
Delta Epsilon.

Nursing Council, governing body of the Faculty-
Student Nursing Association, is composed of three
members of the faculty and six representatives from the
student group. The purpose of this organization is "to
bring about profitable associations and interesting
student enterprises conducive to a well-balanced and
happy life; to uphold the high ideals and standards of
the Nursing profession; to promote the well being of the
School and create cooperation among its members."
The Council appoints all standing and special commit-
tees and their chairmen to take care of all the affairs of
the school. These committees handle traditions, hous-
ing, educational problems and publicity. With this dem-
ocratic governing body to lead them the girls of the
School of Nursing face the post-war world with confi-
dence in their school of the future.

Alpha Tau Delta, national social nurses’ fraternity,
is a new organization at the University of Pittsburgh.
Organized in April of 1945, Mu Chapter, with the
help of its faculty advisors, Emily Holmquist, Eleanor
Williams, and Martha Zavonza, has progressed far
in its first active year. This year the social events
included pledge parties, theater parties, and picnics
in the fall. Highlight of the social calendar was
the spring formal held in honor of Alpha Tau Delta's
Chapter at Duquesne University's School of Nursing.
Business meetings this year were a serious thing as
the girls planned for Alpha Tau Delta's future at
Pitt and strove to set a precedent for future years.
Although this is primarily a social fraternity, nursing
is not forgotten. For these girls are always striving
to benefit their profession, and nursing in a post-war
world is an outstanding topic among the Alpha Tau
Deltas.

Beta Kappa chapter of Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical
Fraternity is an active organization in the University
of Pittsburgh's College of Pharmacy. Founded at the
Medical College of Virginia in 1897, it has been active
at the University of Pittsburgh since l9l3. With the
return of active members from the service, and the
pledging of other veteran pharmacy students, Kappa
Psi's chapter personnel is well on the Way back
to normal. This year the fraternity social events in-
cluded parties, dances, weiner roasts, and hay rides.
Besides these events the calendar included the an-
nual initiation dinner smokers where pharmacy in
the post—war world was discussed. As fraternity
members, these students strive to increase their
pharmaceutical knowledge and perhaps benefit their
profession. They are always on the alert to find
new means for broadening their scope of knowledge.

Lambda Kappa Sigma, national honorary society
for girls in pharmacy, has suffered with an increase
of men pharmacy students this year, CE decrease in
the enrollment of girls, and so, a decrease in their
membership. Nevertheless they have kept up their
social program with their annual banquet for alumni
in December and their formal candlelight initiation
for new members in February. Hayrides, weiner
roasts, and parties were frequent on the social calen-
dar tco. Lambda Kappa Sigma does not neglect their
profession either. Once a week they sponsor a pro-
gram with a guest speaker who discusses subjects
pertaining to pharmacy, medicine, and new drugs.
Lambda Kappa Sigma's plans for the back—to—normal
world are centered around an increased interest in
the new discoveries in the field of pharmacy.

BUREAU OF
RETAIL TRAINING

Bishop Brown, Director

The Bureau of Retail Training, which was one of
the Schools that has felt the effects of the war constantly,
was also one of the first schools to start the return to
normal. The end of the accelerated program in Sep-
tember, 1944, was the first move toward pre-war con-
ditions. Retailing suffered during the war more than
most industries, so, the students lacked actual experi-
ence with normal conditions. Looking ahead to post-
war days, the school saw that in its classroom studies
were those of normal situations so the R. T. graduate
could be prepared for a normal retailing world.

BUREAU OF RETAIL TRAINING

The Bureau of Retail Training is composed of
full and part—time students who desire to learn the art
of retailing. Full time students enter the bureau in
their senior year—part—time students are sent from
the different department stores for special courses.
But Whether full or part—time, retail students are given
both practical and theoretical experience in retail.
Students study current advertisements, charts, ad-

vertising graphs and trends in today's market. They
visit fashion departments of downtowns stores for
the latest ideas in displays and merchandising and
learn the techniques of interviewing and selling.
All this is because the Bureau realizes the need for
special training for young people who wish to
have careers in retailing, and aims to give profession-
al training to them.

Wilbur I Newstetter, Dean of the School of Applied

body as qualified field instructors become available.
Enrollment will correspond, however, with clinical ac-
commodations which are limited by the present
number of field instructors teaching. Normal con-
ditions will permit progressive movements in the
specialized fields of Inter—qroup Work, and Social Re-

THE JUNIOR CLASS

The Iunior class’ theme song for the past three
years, sung to the tune of "Yankee Doodle Dandy"
has been:

"We're the class of '47
The class that's going to be the best."
and through our participation in class and school
activities, we have tried to live up to the significance
of those words.

Through the efforts of our Class Cabinet and the
personal interest of each member of the class, we
have become more than a group of students who will
happen to graduate in the same year. We have
become an important unit, pulling together and
having fun doing so.

Our officers have been busy planning activities
so that we can all come together often, discuss class
problems, and make plans for an active future. And
so, almost every month for the past school year,
our class has gathered together for fun, to exchange
ideas that could help all of us, and to become better
acquainted with one another.

ln October, we had our colossal State Fair in
the Red Tuck Shop, with all the trimmin's: firemen,
barkers, pink lemonade, and hot dogs. ln November,
we had our Play Day, when we all got together,
played the games we had forgotten long ago and
sang in jumbled harmony. For the lnterclass Sing
in December, the Iuniors donned white robes and
haloes and we sang our hearts out for that "l2th
floor heaven." Came Christmas, and you found the
Iuniors leading the carol singing in the Commons
Room. In Februry, we stuffed ourselves at the class
dinner. March brought picnic time and we marched
to Schenley Park for our usual picnic fare: hot dogs,
skits, and laughs. April found us prepared with an
April Fool Folly program and our class came forth
with the talent we knew we had all along.

It's been a busy year and one which we of the
Iunior class will always remember as being so
closely linked with our happiness as students at Pitt.

THE SOPHOMORE CLASS

Under the leadership of competant and energetic
officers the Sophomore Class has worked together
and enjoyed its many activities this year. The Cat
Chat was the first of the year's events. Surrounded
by cornstalks, pmpkins, fortune tellers, and goblins
the Sophomores held their business meeting followed
by a variety of songs and games. Plans were made
for the Inner Class Sing at the QT Coke Hour. Cheers
and songs stirred up an appetite for the cokes and
pretzels served in the Red Tuck Shop. The Sopho-
more Banquet was held to start off the New Year

right. Miss Rush and Mrs. Nicely, Sophomore Class

sponsor, were the guest speakers, with Dolores
Stumpff as mistress of ceremonies. February brought
a Solomon Grundy party with the Sophs excelling
at the different games. We saw all the hidden talent
at the Sophomore lamboree. At a tea in the Com-
mons Room the Sophomores serenaded the Seniors
While giving them roses and bid their Sister Class
farewell. The year's activities closed with a picnic at
Schenley Park. The Sophomore Class has reached
the half—way mark in its college career and was now
looking forward to the last half of their college year

at a back—tc>normal Pitt.

The Sophomore Reconversion Romp was
a dance of which co-chairmen Helen Reis and
Zelma Schmidt could Well be proud. On Novem-
ber 9, posters decorated the mirrored panels of
Schenley Ballroom and planes hung from the
ceiling in keeping with the reconversion theme.
Clyde Knight and his orchestra supplied the
music and the dance reached its climax when
dozens of balloons, some containing lucky num-
bers, were let down from the ceiling and the
scramble for prizes began. The unique decor-
ations were the work of Marian Barkum. Bus-
iness Manager, Bernard Puet, and his publicity
assistants, Glenn Stuart and Mary Carolyn
Daum, helped to make this a successful dance
which fitted well into the new reconversion
atmosphere at Pitt.

FRESHMAN CAMP

"From Camp to Campus" meant something this year that it has not
meant since the normal days of pre-war Pitt. YMCA Freshman Camp,
pitched at Kon-O—Kwee near Zelienople the Friday before the classes
began, chased inherent freshmen fear of upperclassmen and changed
it into friendship, The amateurish athletics between the college, en-
gineers, pre—meds, and bus ads stopped long enough for the "stars" to
eat scrumptuous meals and try to sleep. The only interruption of the
football, mushball, swimming, rifle tiring, basketball, horseshoes, and
throwing buckets of water on sleeping Victims was a Sunday morning
rain. And, as the oriented treshies started back to campus, they thanked
the Y for introducing them so Well. Freshman Camp made freshmen
feel like seniors.

Following the precedent set at Freshman Camp,
Tom Harrington, Freshman Club advisor, and "Pep"
Mallinger, president of Freshman Club, made Fresh-
man Club almost an extension school of the Kon—O-
Kwee week—end. In the weekly meetings of the
club, outstanding faculty members and students
spoke to the freshies on such Vital things as school
politics, the fatigue curve, "dating technique" by three
lovely coeds, India and Football. Freshman Club,
sponsored by Young Men's Christian Association,
has always been the main entrance to bigger and
better Y activities and 1946 accentuated the trend
back to that norm. A special appeal to come out

and join the Y and the Freshman Club was made
to freshmen veterans, and it was gratifying to note
that their response Was great in not only joining
but in their active participation to make Freshman
Club a live and vital crganization. Working together
with their officers and their committee chairmen
such as Social Chairman, Glenn Monn, Publicity
Chairman, Bill Swanson, Athletic Chairman, Richard
Gelm made Freshman Club an enjoyable experience
during their first year at Pitt. In reality, though,
Freshman Club seeks no normal, pre-war or war-
time, but in post-war Pitt it will go beyond Mr. Miller's
hopeful prediction.

FRESHMAN COUNCIL

Chairman . . . . . . . . . .Mary Iane Medley

Freshman Council, composed of representatives
from the Freshman class, guild advisors and chair-
maned by the vice—president of Women's Self Gov-
ernment Association, was organized to give Fresh-
men women experience in governing. For Fresh-
men, Council is the only government available to
their class and is used as a self—governing unit in
its first year.

Delegates to Council are chosen from each orienta-
tion class, aiming to have the best possible repre-
sentation. The group does not elect officers. Their
chairman, the vice—president of WSGA was Mary
lane Medley. The secretaryship was passed from
girl to girl so that each would have the chance to
serve.

Freshman Council is a means for Freshman to ac-
complish, first, the experience of governing and
second, to inform freshmen of the part they are to
play in University activities. Their main purpose
is to serve the Freshman class. They unify Freshman
spirit into a workable whole and give training of
class organization in handling Freshman affairs.

This year Freshman Council held monthly din-
ner meetings where they were taught and practice
fundamental rules of governing. The girls planned
and successfully carried out their part in the Inter-
class Sing by taking first place; and they sponsored
a tea in the Commons Room at Christmas time.
Freshman Council had accomplished their purpose
in this first post—war year.

SENIOR MENTORS

 

A Mentor meets with her Freshman

The word "mentor" comes from the Greek proper
name of the teacher of Ulysses’ son. Today at Pitt
it means guide. Thus a group of senior women is
chosen to guide the Freshman in her first weeks at Pitt.
Then senior mentor program does not by any means
begin with Freshman week. About two weeks before
the semester begins, this group of seniors meets with
Miss Rush for a period of five days during which
time the mentors learn their work thoroughly. The
mentor program, consisting of nine meetings, is de-
signed to acquaint the Freshman with the type of
University she's attending, the customs in practice
here, the organizations for extra-curricular activities,
and the organized opportunities for a freshman in
these organizations. All this material, thoroughly
learned, makes these mentors better prepared to guide
Freshman women.

UPPERCLASS COUNSELORS

Early in his stay at Pitt, the incoming freshman is
introduced to an appointed group of Iunior and
Senior men to whom he can turn for advice. It is
their duty to the freshman to see that he is orientated
to the customs and traditions of the University. Not
in a stilted manner but informally do the Councellors
guide the freshman. In any way that they, as upper-
class men, can make the stay of the freshman more
enjoyable or valuable they make the effort to do
just that. Sometimes it is not unusual to find a wide
discrepancy in the ages of advisor and advisee but
the guidance is so informal and so man to man that
these differences are not noticed. The job is done
and done to the mutual advantage of advisor, fresh-
man and the University.

WINTER
WONDERWHIRL

People said this—-—l heard them, "The best publi-
cized event between spring festivals . . ." "The best
decorated dance." You would never know that
Steve Wolfson and Helen Rose Poole were in their
first semester the way they handled the prepara-
tions for the Winter Wonder Whirl. Remember those
pictures of Co—Chairman Uncle Sam Poole in the "I
want you" pose, and all the wee people running
around with three W's before we knew what it was
all about, and (we think it was posed) the members
of the committee gliding down an eighty degree
hill in a pre—war aluminum sled. Lee Castle's music
was heard in a winter atmosphere with snow-covered
trees, icicles, snowmen, everything but overcoats
for the dancers. Back to normal was spelled WWW.

Let it snow, let it snow—

Lee Castle plays and Pitt dances.

FRATERNITIES

Fraternities are formed here at Pitt on mutual likes, friendships
and proficiencies. Honorary, professional and social fraternities
are different, but formed with the same basic idea. The members
of the fraternities are individuals who want to share their ideas,

dreams and plans for the future with each other.

The Honorary fraternities desire scholarship, leadership,
character and service and keep these virtues always high here at
Pitt. They keep them before them here on the campus but they

also keep them so they never forget them.

The Social fraternities have mutual likes and friendship as
their goal. They too stress scholarship and leadership in their
group. Students belong to their certain group because they like
to Work and play together. If the day is bright and sunny or if
they hit a dark cloud, they are glad they belong to that Greek

society.

All the fraternities on our campus stress efficiency, coopera-
tion and friendliness. They receive the admiration of Chancellor

Fitzgerald who carries out this policy in University affairs. A part

of Pitt, our FRATERNITIES.

Panhellenic Association functions through a coun-
cil of fraternity representatives, and guides all worn-
en's fraternities on the Pitt campus. lts aim is to re-
establish co—operation and unity among women
students. In the late fall Panhel began its post—War
entertaining with the Panhellenic Reception for Fresh-
men women. Next came the Panhel Sing, with the
Tri Delts placing first, Kappas second, and the Phi
Mus third. Other events were the tea for transfer
students, the bridge given with Mortar Board for
the benefit of the Twelfth Floor Fund, and awarding
the scholarship to the Delta Zetas for having the
highest average.

Panhellenic Ball was the Association's crowning
achievement during the first post-war year, for it was
their first formal dance at Pitt since before the war.

With the revival of old customs and the bringing
in of new ones, Panhelenic looks forward to a back-
to-normal Pitt.

Coming back to normal, for Alpha Delta Pi,
meant returning to the Pitt campus. On November
13th, the Tuck Shop was buzzing with the news that
Alpha Delta Pi was back on campus with thirteen
new pledges and one active to guide them.

The first thing the Alpha Delts did to announce
their return was to participate in the Panhel Sing. The
second thing was to find a house and this was
accomplished by buying the Tri Delt house at 4206
Bigelow Boulevard. But entertainment had to be post-
poned until they could get their house painted and
polished. Then they tell us to be prepared for lots of
parties and tea-dances. Yes, the Alpha Delta Pi's are
back on the Pitt campus to stay!

This year the theme of Alpha Epsilon Phi has
changed from "Pitt at War" to "Pitt at Peace". A busy
year both socially and scholastically was planned.
Scholastically, they placed second in the scholarship
cup award. Socially, they put big social events back
on the calendar that included a Thanksgiving Dance,
a Spring Formal and an open house for Pitt students
at their Bellefield apartment. Several joint meetings
were held with their Tech chapter where the girls
made plans for their first post—war convention. Month-
ly dinner meetings for the girls were also begun.
The speakers at these meetings helped the girls see
their duties in the post—War world and guided them on
their way back to normal.

The Beta Sigs were part of the women at Pitt who even
though the war was over, sold and bought war bonds and
waited impatiently for nylon stockings. They felt the
impact of returning veterans in the critical housing short-
age as they searched for a new apartment, but they wel-
comed them back and looked forward to a full year of
social activities.

With no more gasoline rationing Beta Sigma Omicron
held a dinner party at the Balconades, a Christmas formal
at the Nixon Cafe, and the annual spring formal at the
Vogue Terrace. Some of their other social activities in-
cluded roller-skating, swimming, bowling, and slumber
parties.

But along with all these activities Beta Sigs studied,
hoped, and planned for better living in their return to a
back-to—normal world.

"Chi Omega, you're the one for me — - -"; and each
of the 38 girls singing mean every word of this song.

Chi Omega's standards are high. The girls of this
fraternity try to uphold these standards both socially
and scholastically. Each year Chi Omega gives an
award to a senior girl. who is outstanding in the
social sciences.

Chi Omega takes a genuine interest in the school's
activities. The girls are working for their own fra-
ternity's interest, and for the student body at Pitt.

But school activities are not the only interests of
Chi Omega. Dances, teas, picnics, and banquets
rate high with the girls. The highlight of the year is
the dance held on the last day of school—the Dawn
Dance. "The gang" is wide awake and ready to end
the year on a high note.

Delta Delta Delta has joined in Pitt's return to nor-
mal. Picnics at South Park with unrationed gas, and
weekends at cabins were just the beginning. Plans
were made for a big spring dance with formals, tuxes,
favors, and everything.

For the annual Christmas party, the Tri Delts
entertained orphans from the Ward Home for Child-
ren. With new lights for the tree and Mr. Santa Claus
the party was definitely post—war.

Two of the biggest thrills of the year was winning
the first post-war women's trophy at the Panhellenic
sing and when the fraternity gave scholarships to two
girls on campus because their choice of careers
would aid in reconstructing the post-war world.

The girls wearing the stars and crescent are doing
their part on the road back to normal.

The Delta Zetas, though busy making plans for
a year of activities, didn't let down on the job as they
completed their U. S. O. scrapbooks.

The D. Z.'s then busied themselves with paint
brushes and "House Beautiful" ideas and remodeled
the game room at their new home, 158 Bellefield.

Again this year they enjoyed Christmas vacation
with its traditional weekend party when the pledges
served the sisters breakfast in bed. After the slumber
party, fun was doubled by the formal dance the fol-
lowing evening. Tea dances were plentiful with a
spring formal climaxing a successful social year.

But besides this social life the Delta Zetas still
found time for scholarship as they studied and plan-
ned for careers in a post—War world.

The Thetas began their first post—war year with
an open—house on October 27th after the Temple
game. The house at 200 North Bellefield took on the
true Halloween spirit, complete with pumpkins and
corn stalks.

During the year the Thetas were busy attending
parties and o~pen—houses given by other Fraternities,
participating in the Panhellenic Sing, and greeting
new girls at the Reception. There were dances for
men's fraternities after meetings on Monday nights.

The night of December 15, the Thetas had their
first formal dance of the year and later in the Spring
their annual formal was held for the first time since
'41. It is easy to see that the Thetas are back to nor-
Neme Lamh mal, and looking ahead to an active year on campus.

Kappa Kappa Gamma gave the arrival of peace
a big welcome. One thing that came back was
"Those with whom we'd like best to sit in the Tuck
Shop." But there were other things that kept right on
going: tea dances, bridges, the Kappa-Delt faculty
reception, the monthly pledge-active "Information
Pleases," the determination to make college more
complete, The KKG's didn't forget that a War's end
does not mean the return of normal in Europe, so
they adopted a French family to help through the
famine. Nor did they forget that a war's end does
mean an opportunity to do some of the things put off
for so long, like pledge dances and the Four—Fratern—
ity Ball. It has been a good year and the Kappas are
looking forward to next year with few fears of the
future.

For the Phi Mus, getting back to normal meant
more good times with swimming parties, hayrides,
dessert dances, and a Christmas formal. But it meant
more work and interest in new activities too. These
girls are looking forward to getting back to the twelfth
floor and did their part toward. helping to raise money
for the fund.

Phi Mus didn't forget studies in the midst of all this
new activity and they maintained their high scholas-
ic standard. All the Phi Mus have said, "We're glad
to see the vets returning and to see life here at Pitt
swinging back to normal!"

With the post—War season well on its way, Phi
Sigma Sigma took time from textbooks to participate
in campus affairs. Open house was a frequent
event on their social calendar, starting with the open
house held after the Penn State game for the Beta
Sigs and their brothers the Phi Sigma Delts from State
College. The Phi Sigs opened their house next, one
Friday, to the Veterans. Their pledges, not to be out-
done by their sisters, held open house for the pledges
of all women's fraternities on campus.

A bridge Was held with proceeds going to the
Twelfth Floor Fund. Then during the last war loan
drive the Phi Sigs received a blue and gold pennant
from the University for buying the greatest number
of bonds. Phi Sigma Sigma is on the road bacl<-to-
normal.

Theta Phi Alpha began this first peacetime year

.at Pitt with an open house in honor of all Pitt vet—

erans. More open houses followed plus dances and

other social affairs, all of which helped the returning
Veterans at Pitt to feel at home.

The T P A's continued to buy and sell war bonds,
holding a raffle with a Victory Bond as first prize.
Along with studying and their social life, the girls
are raising money to help make the women's floor
at Pitt a reality.

As a part of getting bacl<—to—normal and looking into
the future the T P A's have established a fund to
furnish an apartment that will be a future women's
dormitory on campus. The Theta Phi Alpha's have
not been idle in their plans for a post-war World.

In the house halfway up the block at 147 N. Dith-
ridge St. there were many events during the initial
days of the reconversion period. Late October was
the cause of the pumpkin faced windows and Hallo-
ween parties. With tea dances, came visits from
Ohio State sisters for the traditional Mammy Break-
fasts. Slumber parties were held in late November
and the winter season was climaxed by the Winter
Formal at the University Club. The event proved
so successful a repeat performance came in May,
The Spring Formal. Summer introduced picnics at the
Zeta house.

In school activities, the Zetas had this year as
one of their biggest enterprises — helping raise
funds for the 12th floor.

With this program of studies, activities, and social
life the Zetas are realizing a pre-war fraternity life.

With the end of the war, sisters of the Alpha
Kappa Alpha Fraternity were able to continue the
work of the Mississippi Health Project that began
in l936. Their social calendar opened wi'h the
Autumn Nocturne at which time they welcomed
veterans and newcomers to Pitt and then entertained
the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity in celebration of the
end of the football season. Later in the fall the audi-
torium of May—Sterns in East Liberty was the scene
of the Benefit Bridge Luncheon. The proceeds from
this loridge were turned over to the Twelfth Floor
fund. The spring formal, the Ivy Ball, held at the
Aragon was the most talked of affair of the year. So
combining studies with activities the AKA's made
their bid for a back-to-normal fraternity world.

Delta Sigma Theta is working to get that old
feeling of back-to—normal. During the war they acted
as U. S. O. hostesses, gave blood to the Red Cross,
and wrote to the boys. Now they are ready to settle
down to the happy days of peace at Pitt.

This year the Delta Sigs had many famous people
here to talk to them and to the students of the Uni-
versity. The girls sponsored a Chapel service in mem-
ory of Dr. George Washington Carver this year in our
Chapel. The fraternity was invited to become a mem-
ber of Pitt's Panhellenic Association.

The girls have enjoyed this year an.d are looking
forward to many more of them. They had parties
and dances, studied hard, and went out for activities
in a big way. The Delta Sigs are glad to see that
Pitt is once again back to pre—war standards.

This year with an increase in fraternity member-
ship, Interfraternity Council faced its busiest year.
Serving in an advisory capacity, council offers help
on problems common to all fraternities.

The competitive sports program which was cur-
tailed during the war has been expanded to its pre-
war size. This year the sports included football,
basketball, bowling, swimming, ping pong, softball,
and track. The council once again awarded trophies
for these events. The all-point trophy is awarded to
the leader in all sports for the year, and this year
scholarship was considered as part cf the trophy.

The outstanding social events of the year spon‘
sored by IF were the Interfraternity Ball in December
and Fraternity open house in the spring.

IF Council is working hard this year to put fratern-
ities at Pitt on a peacetime basis, and has given the
student body a glimpse of what a back-to—norrnal
IF schedule will be.

Delta Tau Delta headed beyond its pre—war level
at Pitt. Of course it had things like tea dances, picnics,
Bowery Brawls, returning veterans with bigger and
better ideas, presidents of campus organizations,
a candlelight Christmas and an orchid—faVored spring
formal, the sixth straight year of placing in the IF
Sing, a church service with the Carnegie Tech and
Washington—Ieiterson chapters held by Delt Dean
Moor. But there were always these things. The above
and beyond part could be indicated by the remodel-
ing of the Shelter and the elimination of hazed hell
week, or a spring pledge class the actives defied
anyone to excel. It was best, seen in the intangible
spirit that went out of its way to pass previous
heights.

with a vigorous pace. They are working hard for a
better social, scholastic, and activities record in the
years to come. Every Phi Delt is doing his part to

Phi Delta Theta had a full-time social schedule
for the past year. They had the "Hard Times Dances",
tea dances, and buffet dinners to entertain their
dates and women's fraternities on campus. The cli-
max of the social season were the two big dances of
the year, the Miami Triad and the spring formal.

In scholarship and activities the Phi's were in
there working hard and doing their part for the
University. With this attitude in mind the Phi Delts
will have their fraternity back—to—normal in a very
short time.

Phi Epsilon Pi is making great strides towards a
back—to—norrnal fraternity. Contrast the Phi Ep picture
in the 1944 Owl with this year's picture. They have
also done well in bringing their social affairs back-
to—normal. They added new life to the usual run of
house dances, when they came up with numerous
skating parties, swimming parties, and barn dances.
Some of the bigger high—lights of the year were the
annual Founder's Day dance on Thanksgiving week-
end, at which the Phi Eps played host to their brothers
from Penn State. The New Year's dance and the
Alumni dinner—dance at the last national Conclave
were also big events of the year. It is sure that when
normal is finally reached, Phi Epsilon Pi will not be
so far from the top in the final standing.

With the end of the war, Phi Gamma Delta began
its work to bring conditions back to normal. An ex-
ceptionally fine rush-week closed with twenty-three
new men wearing the White star. Then, too, the Fiiis
took a strong policy in regard to social events. This
year, for the first time since 1940, they enjoyed their
traditional Pig-Dinner. House parties and tea dances
proved numerous, and the spring formal at the Al-
corna Country Club rounded out their eventful calen-
dar, This year the Phi Garns are also quite proud of
their first place IF sing, bowling, sweepstakes, and
track teams. Now, with more and more brothers re-
turning from service, Phi Gamma Delta is looking
forward to an even bigger and brighter year.

Phi Kappa has rounded out its second year of ac-
tivity since its return to the Pitt campus in the autumn
of 1944. The enthusiastic rushing of last fall and
this spring, the large pledge groups, the full schedule
of social and athletic events are convincing indica-
tions of the prominent role this fraternity is once again
playing in inter-fraternity affairs and in general
University activities.

Social life at the Phi Kappa house reached a new
high this year with a series of well—planned dances,
picnics, and open-house parties.

In interfraternity athletic contests, Phi Kappa's
football team, distinguished itself and maintained
close running with rival sport groups.

The "back to normal" theme finds a rejuvenated
Phi Kappa fraternity in the Pitt scene rising to new
heights of popularity and greater participation in
campus acivities.

The post—war period promises great advancement
for Pi Kappa Alpha. Last fall the PiKA's pledged 18
men and in spring rushing netted an additional 23,
most of whom are veterans. These men coupled with
others returning from the service have added great
strength to the Pitt chapter.

In interfraternity sports the PiKA's again led in
the competition. They were first in Football, Basket-
ball, and Swimming, and placed second in Bowling,
Track, Sweepstakes, and Ping Pong.

The social life of the PiKA'S has also found new
life since the war. Tea dances, house parties, and
their annual spring formal provided the year's en-
tertainment.

Looking toward the future, Pi Kappa Alpha stands
on the threshhold of even greater achievement than

The Pi Lams, reinforced by members back from
the service began the year by redecorating their
house. Once a week the Pi Lam labor battalion gath-
ered in overalls and sweaters with buckets and paint
brushes in hand, and repairs ranging from plumbing
to roofing, papering to painting soon had the house
in the best of condition. "Pi Lam Hall" was then ready
for the many dances both informal and formal the
boys planned. On New Year's Eve, Pitt Pi Lams, to-
gether with the Alumni Association, sponsored a for-
mal ball at the William Penn Hotel. Pi Lams from all
over the east gathered and it marked the first conven-
tion of this sort in four years.

Although fraternal spirit never left the Pi Lams
throughout the war, it has become a much more pow-
samuel Fmber erful force in the back-to—normal times.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has been part of
Pitt campus fraternity life for more than thirty years,
has experienced a rejuvenation with the end of the
war. SAE has resumed a more complete schedule
of activities and again has taken its place in interfra-
ternity affairs. Repercussions of the peacetime come-
back have been evidenced in the return of many
of its lZ5 brothers from the service and the abolition
of hell week.

During the past year a round of the time-honored
social events have been held, including the annual
hard times party, the Christmas formal dance, pic-
nics, hay rides, and a series of tea and dessert
dances given for the sororities.

The leonine emblem of this fraternity, signifying
strength and leadership, has been justified especially
well this year by its members in their aim of a back-
to—normal life at Pitt.

Sigma Chi, with an increase in membership, is
making big plans for the future that include many
pre—war social events. This year a sweetheart of
Sigma Chi will be chosen for the first time since the
war. New additions to this year's calendar will be
monthly dances given for other men's and women's
fraternities.

Individual committees that were discontinued
during the war have been reorganized and are plan-
ning for an enlarged Sigma Chi. They plan to
forward the fraternity socially, scholastically, and
along athletic interests. Their first project is their
search and acquisition of a new home. Once this
goal is reached, the Sigma Chis will have stepped
closer to their former place on Pitt campus.

With such an energetic approach to the problems
of the fraternity the brothers hope soon to relax in
the post—war campus world.

Alpha Phi Alpha is now back on the University
of Pittsburgh campus after a two year period of in-
activity. Although they have been active only a
short time, they have almost reached a pre—war status.
In the year that they have been active, their rnember—
ship has increased from seven to twenty—three. The
local chapter has actively participated in both local
and national fraternity life. From a local viewpoint
they have been admitted to the interfraternity council
and have taken part in its social and athletic affairs.
Alpha Phi Alpha has also enjoyed social events
sponsored by both the actives and the pledge group.
The local chapter, Omicron, for the first time in five
years was able to send delegates to their national
convention in Chicago. All in all, it can be said that
A Phi A is back to normal.

Cwens, the sophomore honorary fraternity for
women, has carried on its program of service to the
University unfailingly through the war, continues its
peacetime work guided as always by the high ideal
of unselfishness. The turmoil of reconversion has
not disrupted such activities as maintaining the Cwen
message box, the publication of the student directory,
and their duties as aides at various University
functions.

However, there are many little items in the
Cwen program this year that point unmistakably to
the return to normal, Those hot dogs sold by hustling
Cwens after pep rallies and football games—it
couldn't have been done last year. And now that gas
is plentiful once more, Cwens add spice and Variety
to their meetings by piling into the old jalopy and get-
ting together at the homes of different members. One
final item shows that peace is surely here—all Cwen
dinners no longer consist of chicken. The Cwens
Betsy Brian, are on a back to normal schedule.

Delta Delta Lambda, honorary commercial edu-
cation fraternity, got back into the swing of things this
post-War year by installing fourteen new initiates at
a banquet held at Schenley Hotel. Miss Noyes, teach-
er of Office Machines, spoke on "Office Practices of
the Future." This was just one of the many education—
al talks that followed during the year benefitting the
members in their future careers.

This year the D. D. Ls. have a new faculty ad-
visor, Mr. H. H. Greene, Professor of Shorthand of
the University. Mr. Greene is replacing Dr. Lessen-
berry who is in England on a leave of absence.

Since victory the DDL alumni group has reorgan-
ized and includes many Veterans as new members.

fraternity, is once again coming into the limelight
on the Pitt campus. With an increase in membership
since the end of the war, the boys are once again
ushering at school affairs, handling the war bond
booth, and are on general call for duty.

The annual tall smoker for Freshman men, discon-
tinued before the war, was held this year in true
pre—War fashion. The Druids are now in a state of
dilemma trying to decide whether to purchase the
traditional Druid sweaters or to hold one of those
old fashioned banquets. Either would be a step
back to normal in which the Druids are well on their
way.

Service, scholarship and leadership are the ob-
jects ot Mortar Board, national honorary society for
senior Women. With this theme in mind Mortar
Board began the year by holding a chapel service
and tea with the Cwens. Members and parents of
Pitt and Tech chapters and Hood and Tassel at
P.C.W. were invited, and the individual's place in
the society in which he lives was discussed. Besides
its annual Christmas party where gifts were brought
for refugees, Mortar Board sponsored a Charm school
to help improve the personality and appearance of
Pitt women. This spring Mortar Board and Pan—hellen-
ic jointly held a benefit bridge for the twelfth floor
fund. With a year as full as this it's easily seen Mortar
Board is on the road back to normal.

Nu Sigma Sigma, honorary natural science fra-

years on Pitt's campus it has followed an active
program including meetings twice a month, movies,
or speakers which help the members keep up with
the new developments in science, and field trips
during the spring months to supplement the year's
programs. Since Nu Sigma Sigma has progressed so
in these past three difficult years, it looks forward
in the post-war years to an even more active society.

Phi Eta Sigma, national honorary fraternity for
freshman boys, was organized four years before the
War to stimulate men to scholarship, activity, and
cooperation. Now with an increase in membership
since the end of the war, Phi Eta Sigma has spent a
busy year in University activities. The "scholarship"
boys sponsored speakers for monthly assemblies and
once again their usher ribbons were seen at school
affairs including Tap Day, Scholar's Day and Fresh-
man Night. Two initiation banquets were held, and
the old and new members discussed "Dynamic
Citizenship" and the part it will play in the post—war
world. This year, as in the past years, Phi Eta Sigma
tapped freshman men to membership who showed
scholarship and leadership ability. These men who
will be future leaders of the University helped Phi
Eta Sigma maintain its pre-war standard.

Pitt's Gamma Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa,
national leadership and activities society for Iunior
and Senior men, is swinging back to normal again
after four wartime years. Though numbers and mem-
bership were necessarily curtailed during the war,
ODK did not compromise with standards, and thus
was successful in keeping the ODK tradition and
prestige up at its usual par. On December 10, the
first peace—tirne Founder's Day Banquet since l940
Was held in the University Club and fall under-
graduate and honorary tappees were formally in-
itiated. As one of its major post—war projects, ODK
has set out to enroll graduating seniors at the end of
each semester in the Alumni Association. Other
worthwhile projects are currently in the process of
planning and initiation.

Phi Chi Theta, national professional fraternity for

"Promotion of high ideals for business women." Pro-
fessional activities include a series of forum dinners to
which distinguished persons from the field of business
are invited. Other professional activities range from
the cooperation of the National Personnel Committee,
to individual placement in local industry.

Of primary interest, also, is scholarship. The Phi
Chi Theta key is awarded annually at Scholar's Day
to "the outstanding woman in business administra-
tion" on the basis of "Scholarship, Character, and
Activities." The second important activity has been
the raising of money for a business administration
scholarship to be awarded to a lunior or Senior
Woman with "high scholastic standing and an active
interest in campus activities." Besides this the fratern-
ity holds picnics, parties, bridges, teas and dances.

Sigma Kappa Phi, national honorary foreign lan-

then its history at Pitt has been marked by such an-
nual events as an open house, the giving of keys on
Tap Day to outstanding foreign language students,
the tapping of members on Scholar's Day. Besides
these, the fraternity has sponsored public language
programs and parties planned according to the cus-
toms of other countries. At their monthly business
meetings Sigma Kappa Phi often have programs to
acquaint them with foreign countries and their lan-
guages. During the War much of this was discon-
tinued, but with the end of the war came a heighten-
ed interest in other countries. This year Sigma Kappa
Phi celebrated their twenty—fifth year on campus,
and at a banquet held at Webster Hall plans for the
future were made.

Sigma Tau, national honorary engineering tra-

remaining Sigma Tau men on campus under the
leadership of Pat Shannon. The theme of the chap-
ter's business was the initiation of new men and the
reorganization of Sigma Tau's scholastic and social
activities. Eleven men were initiated during the fall
semester and accepted at a banquet held at the
Royal York.

Plans for accommodating returned veterans at
Pitt and the engineer's place in the post—war world
were the points stressed by Dean Hollbrook, guest
speaker at this banquet. A bowling party was later
held, and plans were made for a reunion banquet
between the active chapter at Pitt and the alumni ct
Sigma Tau employed in the Pittsburgh district.

Sigma Tau, with its increase in membership, is
working hard on the back to normal trend.

Quax, honorary science society for women, this
year followed a program which helped them better
understand science in the post—war world. Their mem-
bers, chosen from women with science interests and a
high scholastic rating in their fields, are tapped once
a year. The outstanding social event of the year was
the annual tea at Stephen Foster Memorial, where
old and new Quax members and their friends got to«

adjustment in CI changing world, Quax has recogniz-
ed the growing importance of psychology. It now in-
cludes psychology majors in its organization. Quax
is on its Way back to normal.

During the last three years Theatron has func-
tioned under difficulties due to the curtailment of
dramatic activities. However, during this period,
those concerned with the importance of its position
have laid the foundation for its continued advance-
ment which must come as activities in the fields of
drama increase.

ln the fall, a new constitution was unanimously
adopted by the members and is now in effect. Its
purpose is for the stabilization of the existing laws
and requirements for active membership.

With this foundation established, Theatron takes
its place as a valued member of the honorary fra-
ternities of the University of Pittsburgh.

Xylon is an honorary fraternity for women in
journalism. It recognizes and taps to membership
those women who have done outstanding work on
student publications for at least two semesters. Reg-
ular dinner meetings are held and there new trends
in journalism are discussed. At many of these meet-
ings prominent people in the literary field were guest
speakers. Among its activities this year, Xylon
participated in "Hello Week" by bringing Iohn E.
lones, staff writer for the Post-Gazette, to an assembly
in Stephen Foster Memorial. Mr. lones, who was a
foreign correspondent in the Pacific during World
War II, told of his experiences and impressions,
while there. With the War years behind them, Xylon
members are planning for an even more active part
in Pitt's back to normal movement.

Idaka, pre—nursing fraternity, taking its name
from the Indian meaning "to serve," established
itself on Pitt's campus in 1942. The Club first
organized for the purpose of acquainting stud-
ents with the various divisions and branches
cf the school of nursing and promoting social
activity and good fellowship among students
who are interested in nursing. Keeping this
purpose in mind they plan and carry out their
activities for the year. These include Visits to
the hospitals in the Medical Center and other
organizations in the community contributing to
health education, and the tapping to member-
ship of all eligible sophomore girls. Looking to
the future these girls plan to better themselves
through Idaka.

Almost a quarter century ago, the Lutheran
students at Pitt founded an organization that
permitted them to get together, and to know
each other. The Lutheran Student's Association
was formed and affiliated with the Lutheran
Student's Association of America.

Throughout the war years, LSA continued
to be a popular organization, and now with
post—war days here, Lutheran students see the
possibilities of an even better organization.
Pitt's group sent representatives to national
conferences, and the LSAA regional conference
of Ianuary 20 was held in Pittsburgh.

LSA meets the first Tuesday of every month
for dinner and discussion; goes "all out" once
a semester and has a big party.

ORGANIZATIONS

Organizations here on our campus Work together to see that
the things we know and love about Pitt are preserved. We spend
endless hours of planning University events so they will meet
and go beyond the requirements of past years. Some of us
govern and keep University customs on a democratic basis.
Others sing, make speeches, put on plays and publish events of
Pitt. Organizations show the real Pitt to the students and the out-
side world. Organization members, along with faculty advisors,
have and will continue to do this to the best of their ability. Here
in organizations we find the leaders of the University. We strive
for the finer things in life here at Pitt so that We may seek and
recognize them when we leave here to take our place in the world.
We make and have leaders and respect them. Our respect goes

to our chief executive Chancellor Fitzgerald. A part of Pitt,

our ORGANIZATIONS.

The Engineering and Mines Cabinet represents
the Engineering body as a whole and strives to make
it an integral part of the University. Engineering and
Mines Cabinet is to the School of Engineering what
Student Congress is to the University, their purpose
being to unite the group of Engineers and govern
them.

This year E and M held their traditional Engineer's
Dance, a skirt and sweater affair with the students
dancing to the music of Clyde Knight at the Schenley.

E and M has a large enrollment this year. The
lounge and smokers are here again. They are try-
ing to bring back pre—war days by sponsoring inter-
department sports. The engineers are on their way
back to normal.

The E. S. A. is composed of an executive board
of seven evening students, to govern the large group
that meets at the University for night school. This
organization is a democratic, social, and progressive
group. E.S.A. secures its officers by election. But these
evening students not only are democratically minded,
but they are a social crowd. Every fall, they plan a
Pitt Open House with a dance and a tour of the
nationality rooms. They sponsor roller skating parties,
swimming parties, and activity dinners in honor of
the past officers and executive committee. E.S.A. is
progressing with post—war plans for its next banquet.
Members plan to award keys to the worthy members
of E.S.A. It is the whole of E.S.A. who are cooperating
to push E.S.A. to its goal and keep it there.

Heinz Chapel Choir, musical and social group,
have sung every Heinz Chapel service since the
Choir's founding in l938. Led by Theodore M. Finney,
the students have done their part Well in maintaining
the dignity and beauty of the Chapel services. In
addition to this, the Choir sings at special school at-
fairs, veteran's hospitals, and make tours and person-
al appearances all over the state. Members of the
Choir have fun, too. Their program this year included
a dinner—dance, a mid-semester trip to the Summit
Hotel, and a picnic at D. I.'s cabin. The Choir has
become a widely known organization and maintain-
ing this prestige requires hard work at rehearsals four
afternoons a week. With Sunday services, Friday
student chapel services, and all the rest of the activi-
ties on the program, the Choir keeps busy, but they
love it.

The Pitt News told us the "Pitt Band Marches
Again", but at first we couldn't get excited about it.
Then we saw and heard. For the first time since l943,
a blue and gold uniform represented Pitt on a foot-
ball field. Perhaps it wasn't as big as the pre-war
editions, perhaps the musicians were a little inexperi-
enced; but we knew that the day was coming soon
that "normal" would not be enough to satisfy the
goals of Pitt's band. The band did hold concerts and
made a tour though, that not only gave the members
a chance to apply their long hours of practice but also
gave us and the Tri—state district a chance to appre-
ciate good music. The Pitt Band is back on campus
and on its way to surpass an impressive pre—war
record.

MEN'S COUNCIL

Nineteen forty—five and six, the first year after the
war, was an active year for Men's Council. The

Council settled down again to pre-war routine. No
more replacements and reelections to fill off-to-War
vacancies, for now more men were coming to school
than leaving school. _

Because of the returning servicemen, the most
important function of the council was the student
loan fund. This fund gave financial aid to veterans
until they received their government allowance.

This year also marked the launching of a new
policy for the council. Each member elected to the
council was thereafter to hold office for his remain-
ing years in undergraduate school. They were to
work with the Council in ccordinating men's activi-
ties on campus, and in promoting the general wel-
fare of Pitt men. "This," said Arnold Steinrnan, presi-
dent, "is what we worked for."

More and more in a world going back to normal,
Pitt is recognizing the need for confident, experienced
Women speakers. Women's Speech Association is
filling this need. In forums and at round table dis-
cussions, they talk of women's role in a World of
peace. intelligently they discuss political, economic,
and social aspects of present day problems. They
sponsor poetry and choral readings, they encourage
debates, they even plan to award keys to outstanding
members of their group.

But WSA has fun, too. The girls had a big banquet
in December and attended a public speaking confer-
ence at Penn State. Because the members of the
Women's Speech Association love to speak, they are
going to entertain local women's clubs in their hope-
ful future that will make up their back to normal
schedule.

We, the Owl staff, present to you of the University of Pitts-
burgh the first post-war Owl. VVe hope that it lives up to your
expectations. A great deal of work and planning has gone into
this Owl to bring it back, inch by inch, to its pre—war standards.
To do this, cooperation was needed from every staff member
from the editor to the typist. All work was done in a scheme.
The Editorial Staff saw that the stories were written, pictures
taken and identified, prints sent to the engraver, copy checked,
and the final plans made with the printer. The Business Staff
balanced the books, solicited students for sales and pictures,
and contacted advertisers for ads. The staffs began work in
early October and their work was not finished until the Owl
came out. Unison was the keynote, and because of this unison,
your Owl is here.

Tending to avoid the sensational in the better interests
of the University and of the students, this year's Pitt News
was the force that gave unity to University life. The News
was the Voice of the students and in a sense the spirit of
University life. Taking the News and the work that goes
into each issue for granted is an easy thing to do.

There were beats to cover, stories to write, layout to
make, copy to proof and a hundred and one other little
details that go into putting out a newspaper. But the Edi-
torial staff was a competent one and so the Editor's policies
were carried out.

The Editorial Staff made up only one half of the unity
that was found in the News this year. The other half was
the Business staff; for it was the Business Manager and
his staff who supplied the money to make it possible for
the Editor to carry out her policies. Through the constant
effort of this staff, Pittsburgh was scoured for ads, finances
were kept straight and circulation of the paper to students,
subscribers and advertisers was accomplished. This was
the 1946 Pitt News working with unity as their keynote.
It was the beginning of a back—to-normal News on the Pitt
campus.

Thirty-one years ago, students of Pitt and Tech
met at the Shadyside Presbyterian Church and
formed the Pitkin Club for the purpose of discussing
religion and problems of the day. Other customs
have changed at the University, but after these 31
years, Wednesday night is still Pitkin Night, a date
to look forward to each week. One thing that has
made Pitkin a favorite with Pitt students is the de-
licious dinner that is served at each meeting by the
women of the church. With a combination of lively
discussions, debates, and good food, Pitkin has sur-
vived through two periods of war and has emerged
stronger than before. Because of its great increase
in numbers during the past year, the members of
Pitkin Club feel that the year was one of the most
successful.

Pitt Players Was formed to create an interest in
drarnatics and to give students an opportunity to
act in and produce plays. The teamwork of the three
sections of the Player's organization, business, tech-
nical and acting, has resulted in a successful year.

Until February, Pitt Players and reconversion and
improvement plans Were delayed by the lack of a
suitable workshop. This handicap was overcome
when they were given a room on the eighth ﬂoor
Where they could rehearse, paint scenery or check
ticket sales of a present production.

Reconversion and return to normal at Pitt were
realized to CI greater extent by the Player's first
production of Saroyan's "Iim Dandy" in March.
The Players had seen the beginning of a bacl<-to-
normal schedule.

Student Congress has tried to meet and success-
fully overcome the problems that beset any organi-
zation in this its first year on campus. Since Septem-
ber of 1945 we have tried to better student activities
now campus, bring back ones that were inactive dur-
ing the war and instigate new activities for the stu-
dent's welfare. It's been a busy year and a full one.
We've met and discussed plans for dances, mass
assemblies, pep rallies, Spring Festival and tried to
start Hello Week on its way to becoming a Pitt tra-
dition. We've tried to bring out the Pitt spirit and
make it click. It's been work but it's been working with
Pitt students and for Pitt and so we've been more
than repayed for our efforts. It's been working for our
school as your governing body and we hope we
have lived up to your expectations.

STUDENT CONGRESS COMMITTEES

"Of the students, by the students, and for the
students," describes Student Congress, governing
body for all organizations on campus. It is the voice
of the university students, expressing not only ma-
jority rule but also minority representation.

Besides keeping the wheels of the regular Pitt
activities in smooth working condition, Student Con-
gress sponsors big University dances, Scholar's Day,
the War Fund Drive, Bond Sales, and in general ad-
vises all functions that affect the student body.

The students thank their Congress for the revival
of several traditional pre-war activities. What a thrill
it is to attend the University tea dances in spacious
dance halls with good orchestras! Remember the
Howdy Hop at the Masonic Temple and the Turkey
Trot at the Schneley Hotel? Once more a regular
activities hour is provided on Thursdays fourth hour

with good speakers, pep meetings, and student as-
semblies. We were impressed with Bishop Pardue,
T. Z. Koo, and the inspirational Christmas meeting.
In the way of old student-faculty associations, the
Oak Table plan has faculty and students eating
lunch together and getting acquainted.

And something new has been added! The Con-
gress sponsored a drive to clean up the ground floor.
An outstanding ticket booth for all groups to use is
only one evidence of this drive.

The fourteen members of Student Congress are
also kept busy every Thursday afternoon, for they
have the responsibility of choosing reliable com-
mittees for University affairs, and hearing all pe-
titions and problems facing student groups. Student
Congress is responsible for bringing pre—war days
back to campus life with the by words, "cooperation
and coordination."

Since 1920 each Woman in the University has had
a voice in the administration of her own affairs
through the Women's Self Government Association.
Aimed at encouraging loyalty to the University and
its traditions and at creating a spirit of friendship
among the faculty, the administration, and the wom-
en students, WSGA is the force that controls and
unifies all women's activities on campus. Patterned
after our national government, this organization con-
sists of three branches; executive, judicial and legisla-
tive. The executive includes the four officers, the chief
justice of the Senior Court and six others. Senior Court

COMMISSION

The Men's Glee Club, grandfather of all non-
athletic organizations at Pitt, is now in its fifty-
fourth year. Drawing from the group of veterans,
the Glee Club found many promising vocalists and,
under the directorship of Dr. T. M. Finney, prepared
to defend its pre-war reputation. The group had an
enviable activities list for the year: singing at the
Chancellor's Reception, and taking a spring tour.
The Glee Club is also branching out and singing with
choral groups from neighboring schools. This spring,
Glee Club members and a singing group from Penn-
sylvania College for Women presented a concert.
The social climax of the year was their banquet where
keys were presented to worthy members of the Glee
Club. With this pre-war activities schedule, the Glee
Club boys are on their road back to normal.

Women's Choral was organized to foster an ap-
preciation of good music among women of the Uni-
versity and to provide an opportunity for girls who
have interest and ability in choral singing for those
who have had little or no time for training. Eighth
period Monday and Wednesday is practice time. The
girls take an elevator to the tWenty—third floor and
meet with their director, Theodore M. Finney (Pop),
for an hour of choral singing.

Besides singing at numerous Pitt functions such
as the Chancellor's Reception, the girls had a fine
social program planned this year. They started off
with an open house this fall followed by a gay
Christmas party. The girls closed their first post—war
year with the traditional spring concert and a ban-
quet where the loyal members were presented keys.

work. This year the girls started out with their Indian
"Cookout" for Physical Education transfers at Panther
Hollow. October 17 they held a big Gypsy Festival
for freshmen women at Bubbles Field where the
freshman girls gathered around a bonfire to sing
and act out skits representing CJYDSY life. Then during
the weekend of December 1, the transfer students at
the University were invited on a Sentimental Iourney
to Holiday Lodge. W.A.A. also sponsored inter—class
sports including basketball, bowling, indoor swim-
ming, and badminton. lt was a full schedule and a
back-to-normal one for Women's Athletic Association.

Up on the eighth floor, room 809, of the
Cathedral are located the offices of the Pitt
YMCA. Here undergraduate men take advan-
tage of the facilities of a group anxious to see
that studious activities are sufficiently light-
ened by proper recreation.

Supervising these activities is a Committee
of management, comprised of both faculty and
student members. Completely student in its
membership is the Cabinet which places itself
closer to the operation of these activities.

I like the other one best!

Your guess is as good as mine

Every possible interest is reached through
the Y. Available to all denominations are such
diversified activities as Freshman Camp, Forum,
and Freshman Club. Speakers of note are
brought to Pitt, local, regional and national
conferences are attended. Programs in coopera-
tion with the YWCA highlight the social agenda.
In every way possible does the Y contribute
to the enjoyment and well being of the student at
Pitt.

For thirty five years, the Y has been one of
the most active organizations in the University.
YWCA appeals to all interest groups, doing
committee work on programs, worship, person-
nel, publicity, social, and recreational lines. Y
members work hard to carry on their varied
activities and due to an ever widening mem-
bership, they plan for bigger, more extensive
programs in the future. Beginning this year;

Hello — YWCA office

great number of students who wished to attend.
This year's speakers at Monday Luncheon
have been a source of inspiration for many of
us. But every so often, the hard working Y girls
take a week-end off, roll up their blue jeans, and
dash away for Camp Carondowanna. There
they have discussions, and conference groups.
And at night, they gather around a campfire
and sing the well known Y songs. They come
home filled with ambition and new ideas to
make their organization bigger and better.

Service with a smile.

MILITARY

We come to school three days a Week, tailored in blue and
gold, and on the way we maybe passed several officers whom We
had to salute. We didn't mind the curious looks of the pedestrians
downtown, nor too much the razzing we took about the gold stripe
or an occasional chevron. We decried our "monkey suits" and
the "walks in the park" to cadence, but secretly we were a little
proud of those combination West Point and regular army uni-
forms sporting our Alma Mater's colors. We spent the year
learning how to command, or, more essentially, how to take
those commands close—mouthed. We learned how to read other
than auto maps, and how to field strip the M-l. We heard how the
manager of our rifle team had been recommended for the Legion
of Merit and had received special citation for saving the army
$500,000. We said goodbye and good luck to our commanding
officer, Major Mervin Wills, who served as Professor of Military
Science and Tactics ior four years. We got behind our school
and our leader Chancellor Fitzgerald. A part of Pitt, our MILI-
TARY department.

PERSONNEL

The staff of the Military Department under-
went changes as great as those in student per-
sonnel. New faces appeared and many familiar
figures left the staff to become civilians.

Head of the Military Department is Major
Merlin V. Wills, C. A. C., who took command at
Pitt in I944. A graduate of Pitt and a member
of the Y.M.C.A. committee of management,
Major Wills takes an active part in Pitt life, help-
ing for instance to reinstates the traditional
Freshman Camp in I945.

One of the familiar men at Pitt who has left
the University for civilian life is Major William
R. Havlak. Major Havlak, also a graduate of the
University, supervised the A.S.T. medical stud-
ents until Christmas, when he received his dis-
charge after five years at Pitt.

A man new on the staff, but not new at Pitt,
is first Lieutenant Iames D. Hunter. Lt. Hunter
graduated from Pitt in I942, before entering the
Air Corps and serving in the North African,
Sicialian and Italian campaigns.

A few days after Lt. Hunter arrived, another
shift took place in the department. M/ Sgt. Iohn
Flynn, who had served at the University since
1943, left for Philadelphia and civilian status. He
was replaced by M/Sgt. Samuel S. Simon.

Early in 1946, the staff was enlarged by the
arrival of M/ Sgt. john Hudak. Sgt. Hudak came
to Pitt to take the place of M/Sgt. l. M. Block.

Another staff member is M/ Sgt. Iames T.
Doherty. Sgt. Doherty has seen overseas serv-
ice and was a member of the U. S. Military
Mission in Russia and Iran, besides seeing serv-
ice in Africa, Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Iran,
India, and Burma. With all this experience, he
still likes the Army.

A member of the military department who
saw considerable service overseas is Sgt. Watts
I. Shablowski. He served for 18 months with
the famous "Fighting First Infantry" in North
Africa and Sicily, Wounded in Sicily, Sgt.
Shablowski was returned to the U. S. to teach
military science at Pitt.

Soon after the advanced training program was re-
instated, the A.S.T.P. program at the University disap-
peared. At midyear only Company C, the medical boys,
remained at the Cathedral living on the third and
fourth floor of the Cathedral. In March, however, the
War Department discontinued this A.S.T.P. training pro-
gram. The seniors were commissioned. The juniors,
sophomores and freshmen were discharged if their
scholastic records were satisfactory. When these boys
left, there went with them our last reminder of the earlier
war year when the Air Corps and the A.S.T.'s occupied
a great part of our life as they made the Cathedral
really throb.

R. O. T. C.

l946 saw the long missing advanced R.O.T.C. pro-
gram return to Pitt. The war had eliminated the ad-
vanced course from the University; but, in 1945, the
War Department authorized the renewal of the upper-
class Coast Artillery program. The terms of the author-
ization limited the new course to veterans. The pro-
gram calls for two years advanced training prefaced by
two years basic and climaxed by appointment as sec-
ond Lieutenant in the Army Reserve. To make allow-
ance for vets, the program allows the substitution of
one year cf active military service for the basic course.

Although the ever present draft law kept the R.O.T.C.
personnel changing rapidly, the basic course did re-
convert with respect to the pre-war practice of appointing
cadet officers. Harry Lentchner became battalion
major; William Raines, Martin Gluck, captains; lieu-
tenants Were Tom Leiper, Bernard Labuskes, Louis
Baraff and William Babyak.

RIFLE TEAM

With practically no holdovers from last years Nation-
al Champion Rifle Team, M/Sgt. Iim Doherty built up
the 1946 Rifle squad from freshmen, including a number
of Veterans. These boys, coached by Sgt. Watts Sha-
blowski, practiced until Christmas at dry firing in the
Cathedral. Early in Ianuary they began live fire shoot-
ing up in the Pitt Stadium range. Scores were compared
and the best man selected for the R.O.T.C. and Varsity
teams.

The Rifle team fired in the National and 3rd Service
matches and succeeded in winning the Hearst
Championship. In addition to this the team fired against
64 college R.O.T.C. chapters, and won sixty of these
matches. Out of the fifteen man team, six of the mem-
bers were veterans.

Major Merlin V. Wills is in charge of the team, Sgt.
Watts I. Shablowski is the coach and M/Sgt, Iames
Doherty is their manager. The team plans to reestablish
the Pitt Rifles, an honorary military fraternity, which was
discontinued because of the war.

FOREWORD

When the war drums first began to beat, back in 1940, the
University's graduates were called into the service as fast as
they received their diplomas. And so it went throughout 1941,
'42, '43, and '44. Each of these years the OWL chose, as in the
pre—war years, a Hall of Fame. 1t consisted of those men who
had been conspicuously active at Pitt and had contributed their
time and talent toward a better school life at Pitt. The Hall of

Fame was our tribute to them.

Many of those elected to the hall entered the armed forces and
served their country as they had served their school. Now that
peace has been won and these men are returning, we of the
1946 OWL think it only fitting that our yearbook contain some
sort of tribute to these men.

With this in mind, we present a Military Hall of Fame, com-

posed of those former leaders at the University.

To choose such a group was difficult. Many records were
examined. Many were incomplete. A standard scale of re-
quirements was drawn up and adhered to. It included attend-
ance at Pitt during the war years and service overseas in a thea-

ter of war.

It is unfortunate that all the men and women on Pitt's service
flag could not be included in this Hall of Fame. But since this
would be physically impossible, we have have chosen a few of
the leaders and hope that we may in some measure honor the
rest by dedicating the 1946 Military Hall of Fame to all who

have served our country and our University.

 

ROBERT C. ADAMS

Bob Adams was best known on Pitt's Campus for his Work on
the PITT NEWS. He joined the staff in his freshman year, was
appointed campus editor as a junior, and became editor of the

Alpha, and Scabbard and Blade. He was elected Iunior Worthy
in 1939 and was subsequently tapped to Omicron Delta Kappa.

CORTLAND BACALL

One of the wide-eyed freshies who listened to Pitt's Dean
of Men explain extra—curricular activities back in 1937 was
Cortland Bacall. That he took the Dean's advice to heart was
soon evidenced by Cort's election to Druids the following year.
Phi Eta Sigma, Pitt Rifles, Order of the Artus, and Scabbard (S
Blade also admitted him to membership. He sang in the Glee
Club and became manager of that organization in his junior
year. He also sang in the Heinz Chapel Choir and played in
Pitt's band. Cort's business abilities resulted in appointment

HOWARD I. SCOTT

On March 5, 1943, when Howard l. Scott was placed on
active duty in the United States Army, Pitt lost one of its most
outstanding athletes. Going overseas with the lO3rd Infantry
Division, Scotty first distinguished himself near Celeste, France
when he swam a river, under heavy enemy fire, to repair vital
communications lines. For this, he was awarded the Bronze
Star. His brave action in later combat brought him another
Bronze Star, a Silver Star, and a field commission as a Second
lieutenant. After V—E Day he established military governments
in four German towns, then again proved his athletic ability
playing with outstanding teams in Europe. This success sent
him to the University of Biarritz, France where he continued his
collegiate work. He was placed on an inactive status as a
Captain in the United States Army Reserve on April 13, 1946.

While at Pitt Scotty was active in Phi Gamma Delta Fratern-

ity and played freshman and sophomore football and freshman
baseball.

 

ROBERT M. SHAW

Robert M. Shaw's extracurricular interests at the University
began in his freshman year when he entered Pitt Rifles, Men's
Debating Association and was pledged to Delta Tau Delta.
Bob's sophomore year brought recognition in Druids. His in-
terest in social activities, which began when he worked on the
Freshman Dance, continued. He helped plan three Spring Fes-
tivals and the Iunior Prom. Bob took part in YMCA work, man-
aging Freshman Camp and became president of the Y in '41.
Work on four Military Ball committees, membership in Scabbard
6: Blade, and service as an upperclass counselor round out the

ROBERT SULLIVAN

In February of 1946, Pitt welcomed back Robert Sullivane
"home" after three years of service in the United States Army.
Freshly discarded were the silver bars of his lieutenancy in the
Tank Corps. As eventful and distinguished as his career at
Pitt was his tour of duty in the Service. Bob participated in
the French campaign and later in the German action. The tra-
dition of a job well done was kept alive by another Pitt man-—
a man who contributed so well to that tradition while an under-
graduate of the University. During his four years at Pitt, Bob
participated in many activities. He was tapped to Druids, Kappa
Phi Kappa, Delta Sigma Rho, Delta Delta Lambda, Omicron
Delta Kappa, and was vice—president of ODK and president of
DDl during his senior year. Besides these honoraries, Bob was
active in Men's Debate, Co-manager his senior year, Pitt Rifles
and YMCA. His training and participation in activities here
at Pitt gave well the indication that Robert Sullivan would
maintain Pitt standards and ideals.

RICHARD R. WEISS

When Richard Weiss took over the editorship of the OWL
in his senior year, it was the climax of three years of hard work.
During his undergraduate years, Dick also worked on the PITT
NEWS, joined Cap <3: Gown, and pledged to Pi Lambda Phi.

SPORTS

We trudged up the hill to the stadium eight times this year in
hopes that our first post—war team, although far from "normal,"
would turn in Panther-like fashion upon some of its favored
rivals. We were disappointed more often than not, though, but
these hopes continued and found their reward in the 7-0 upset
over Penn State closing the season. Then during the cold winter
evenings, we went to the stadium pavilion to be warmed by the
fiery spirit of "Doc" Carlson and his "court jesters". Once we
saw them beat the tireless Towering Titans of Westminster and
we knew we had a powerful team. But then came the dawning
of real hopes. We saw our baseball team finish with a better
season than seven classes before us, and we knew that
championships were on their way back. Most of us, though,
didn't jam the stadium to see the track meets which were held
during the spring. But how we wished we had, when we read
day after day that Pitt had won another meet. No one could
say, "what's wrong with your track team?" anyway, for we
claimed two national championships. But all through the thick
that became thinner as time went by, we cheered and hoped, and
the best fan always was Chancellor Fitzgerald, our real cheer-

leader. A part of Pitt, our SPORTS.

FOOTBALL

Pitt opened the 1945 season at Champaign against a pow-
erful Illinois eleven. Unlike previous seasons, this opener was
not a warm up game. Illinois sported a veteran aggregation
that defeated Pitt 23 to 6. lnexperience had lead the Panthers
to costly mistakes which ultimately cost them the game.

Not even the cold spraying drizzle prevented the 10,000
pro-Pitt fans from enjoying the West Virginia game. Our "cous-
ins" from the hills came through in usual style as they took it
on the chin 20 to 0. The score did not fully tell the story for the
Panthers outrushed West Virginia 426 yards to 172, accumulat-
ing l8 first downs to the Mountaineers’ 4.

"Why don't we do this more often" should have been the
Panther slogan following the Bucknell game. Sporting a power-
ful running attack, which reminded Pitt fans of years back a
young Panther eleven swamped Bucknell 38 to 0.

It might have been a perfect football game had not the Pan-
thers become too overconfident against Michigan State, for the
Panthers were caught napping. The game ended with Michigan
State desperately fighting off the Panthers, but the score was
still 7 to 12.

Still feeling the sting from the Michigan State upset, the
Panthers played host to Notre Dame. For awhile in the second
quarter it seemed as if a Notre Dame setup might be trans-
formed into an upset. However, in the third quarter the Irish
started to overrun a tired, underclassed Pitt team. Herb Dough-
las's touchdown romp in the final minutes of play typified the
spirit of the entire Pitt team~"neVer say die." The score: 9 to 39.

Many fans believed that an upset was in the offing when
an unbeaten Temple eleven played the Panthers. But the
Panthers seemed to lack a scoring punch for although they
pushed Temple up and down the field continually they could-
n't seem to score. The game ended disappointingly with the
Panthers beaten by an inferior aggregation——6 to 0.

Playing their best defensive game of the season the Pitt
Panthers went down to a 28 to 0 defeat by Purdue and actually
looked good in doing it. Except for the spasmodic break
throughs in the Panther line, the Purdue backs were held in
check for the entire game.

The Pitt—Ohio State game would have been an amazing para-
graph for Pitt's memoirs had the game ended in a tie, for the
Ohioans gained 359 yards to Pitt's 91 and accumulated l6 first
downs to Pitt's 5. This vastly superior Ohio State team were
not to be denied and late in the fourth quarter they scored twice
to win the game 14 to 0.

Again rain, mud and another Big Ten football team. The
19 to 0 score does not really tell the story for the chilling rain
held the Hoosiers in check all afternoon. Pitt tried hard but
was completely outclassed by the powerful, well—manned
Indiana eleven.

Held scoreless for four straight games by lines which grossly
outweighed them, the Panthers sprang to life against an evenly
matched Lion eleven. The Panthers led by limmy Ioe Robin-
son were determined to win, and they did, 7 to 0. Pitt needed
this game to give the boys the satisfaction of knowing that they
can do well when they are up against evenly matched oppo-
sition.

BASKETBALL

It was a great beginning but oh what an end-
ing, that about sums up this year's Pitt basket-
ball season, short, but not too sweet.

With the services of co-captains Nate Apple
and Hank Zeller back from the previous year,
Dr. Carlson had the nucleus for this year's
squad. Other Carryovers from the previous year
were two experienced reserves Ed Maruzewski,
a rugged guard, and Sam Cosentino, a chunky
forward.

By the time the campaign opened the doctor
had three freshmen ready to do varsity duty,
Sammy David, a six foot lad with good basket-
ball sense and an accurate eye; Pat Malarkey,
a rangy guard; and Alex Medich, a stalwart
guard. With this combine of players, Dr. Carl-
son tackled Ohio State in the opener at Colum-
bus.

The Pitt men put up a terrific battle, only to
lose out in the closing minutes by a ten point
margin. But in the next six games the Panthers
weren't to be stopped, they came from behind
in five of the next half of dozen encounters to
win. Bethany fell after the Panthers began
clicking on all five, took Geneva after a hard
struggle, Carnegie Tech supplied little oppa
sition, sent Penn State back home after a torrid
fourth quarter, set down Westminster by nine
points, and eked out another win over Geneva
with seconds remaining.

The second half schedule was a sad one.
Ohio State again set us back, as did Penn State.
We took another one from Tech, but West Vir-
ginia beat us twice and Army and Westminster
added two more red marks.

The result a .500 season for Dr. Carlson in
his 24th year as coach.

Cleated shoes and the sound of running feet on the
Cinders are back again. Coach Carl Olson had a right to
feel proud of his first track team since before the War, for
the University's cinder men competed in seven meets,
winning three and placing second in a triangular meet
with Penn State and Maryland. Six individual reasons
for being proud of his team were due to lack Henderson
and Bill Curtis in the two mile, Ed Sudzina in the mile,
Clarence Doak in the 440, and Herb Douglas and Tommy
Carr in the dash. Douglas also broke the previous broad
jump record of 24' l" by his 24'47/8" jump at the IC4A
championship meet. Coach Olson had produced a track
team that he and Pitt were proud of in this first bacl<—to-
normal track season at the University.

BASEBALL

Old Iupiter Pluvius took advantage of this year's Pitt
nine and reduced its 13 game schedule to eight contests.
Of these, the Mitterling men won four and lost four.

Starring in this year's infield was Art Barnes who not
only covered short stop and second base, but hit the ball
at .400 clip. Teaming up with Barnes at the plate was
right fielder lack Smodic, who also hit .400.

The team's record doesn't speak for itself. The pitching
was good but the fielding was very loose; especially with
men on the base paths. Sammy David and Tex Richards
led the mound corps in wins. Supporting them was Buck
Iohnson, a star tackle on the gridiron and Iirn Kline.

One thing can be said of this season/Pitt won more
games this year than they did in the past four and next
year looks like an even more promising season if old
lup leaves us alone.

ACTIVITIES

Here at Pitt our activities are what bring fun and happiness in-
to our college life. We have our Tuck Shops Where we can gather
and "gab" about the big dance that is coming up or the one that
was so super on Friday night. A familiar sight in the Tuck Shop
too is Chancellor Fitzgerald who comes down to have a cup
of coffee and is eagerly welcomed by the students. We attend
l-lello Week, Spring Festival and all the other affairs in full force,
and can depend on seeing the Chancellor joining in the fun
if only for a few moments. ln Activities we get many wonderful
memories to carry with us through our life. Most of these mem-
ories will be happy ones, and some might bring a chuckle in the
years to come because we were so "crushed" when the night
of the big bonfire it rained and had to be called off. We study at

school, but we have our fun. A part of Pitt, our ACTIVITIES.

HELLO

One of those songs goes, "What a Dif-
ference a Day Makes." But here at Pitt,
one of those comments could be, "What a
Difference an '0' Makes." Showing a
striking resemblance, yet a deep—rooted
antithesis, toward traditional fraternity
Hell Weeks, Student Congress-sponsored
Hello Week begain its life. It is one of
those things that we cannot hail as a
"Back-to-Normal" omen, for Hello Week
was unknown at pre-war "Normal" Pitt.
However, it promises to become as much
a fixture (and probably more welcome
one) as its twin without the  As in

In some ways, though, it could be con-
fused with the fraternity escapade. They
both last the same length of time, usually
four days; they both always present some-
thing to do at all times; they both are
chiefly concerned with those neophytes
who are newly acquired as either regis-
trants or pledges; they both are timed so

may not know enough to feel them re-
dundant; they both cling to the same
fundamental purpose—that is to provide
a setting where intimacy is fostered and
personality exposed.

But there are differences—big differ-
ences. lnstead of toothpick-chopsticked
meals from under the table, there were
lots drawn to see who would get to eat
with Betty or Lois or that cute Freshman;
instead of firing a filthy furnace, there
was a bonfire cheering session with wel-
come refreshments after the Michigan
State game; instead of desperately pol-
ishing an unpolishable frat house for a
dance "in their honor" but with specifica-
tions to suit others, there was a dance re-
quiring nothing for enjoyment but two
bits and a yen for fun; instead of pledge
entertainment as corny as it was com-
pulsory, there was Milt with his own Gold-
en Banter in the Tuck Shop. "What a

Somewhere someone said something once
about the "happy accident of alliteration." But
for the Howdy Hop, even the alliteration wasn't
an accident. Presented as one of the features
of "Hello Week", the Howdy Hop made it possible
to dance with that person or those persons you
had finally had an excuse to meet. But there was
ample proof at the Howdy Hop, that those Student
Congress members sympathized with the students
in their endless task of "getting to know" their new
schoolmates. October twelfth was a date they, like
Mr. Moody, could say "Howdy, bub," to Pitt, to
upperclassmen and to each other.

In spite of the fact that the Delts
had more men "gracing the place"
than any other frat and took a
place in the Sing for the sixth
straight year, and in spite of PiKA's
placing third in the Sing and one
of their brothers being chairman of
the Ball, and in spite of the fact
that the Pi Lam banner was hung
the highest, one could have thought
from the representative pictures
above that this was a Phi Gain
formal. For the Fijis, two things
stood out. First was their Sing
Team, champion for the first post-
war year at Pitt, and the second
was their striking purple and winning phi Gam Sing

as soon as one could see in the
door. But after all, it was an Inter-
fraternity Ball, and frat men got
together happily forgetting the poli-
tics and the athletic rivalry that
marked the preceding year. Bob
Chester's orchestra and "favorite"
dates made most everyone agree
that it was an evening well spent.

BUNNY HOP

With egg—dyed rabbits plastered on bulletin
boards and hung from the ground floor ceiling,
the Engineering and Mines Association an-
nounced its Easter dance, the Bunny Hop. With-
out looking tco closely at the posters though, it
wasn't too evident what rabbits, pink yellow and
blue rabbits, yet, had to do with engineering
or mining. But Saturday night, April thirteenth
we found that something, perhaps rabbits or per-
haps engineers made us forget the heat and the
one square foot each couple seemed to have to
dance in, and made us remember only the
smooth rhythm of Andy Shirley's orchestra and
the soft atmosphere of the beautifully decorated
Urban Room.

This traditional spring dance held by Engin-
eering and Mines Cabinet was up to its pre—war
par. Its Easter theme that had started with rab-
bits in the Cathedral was carried out at the
dance with the Urban Room sprouting bunny
silhouettes, tulips, and balloons in spring colors.
Topping off this were crepe paper streamers
of yellow, lilac, pink, white and pale green.
Silver band bracelets with a bunny stamped on
them were given to the girls as favors. E & M
was on its way back-to-normal with a "better
than ever" Engineer sponsored dance in this
first post-war year at Pitt.

With the end of the war the fraternity women
at Pitt have returned to a formal ball which
ends their social season. The William Penn
Ballroom—the music of Brad Hunt and his
orchestra—the swish of evening gowns and the
shine of tux and tails made Panhellenic Ball
one of the brightest of this year's social affairs.
The surprise of the evening was the return of
favors. Fraternity women gave their dates Pan-
Hellenic keys inscribed with "Pan—Hellenic
Ball, 1946". Pan—Hellenic Council will always
remember this successful dance as a milestone
in the return to normal at Pitt.

Pitt's Mardi Gras opened May 8, with a colorful
procession from the French Room to Heinz Chapel
with a costumed student representing each campus
organization. This was followed by a Mardi Gras
banquet in the mess hall and later in the evening the
whole campus turned out at Shadyside Ballfield for
a carnival that had everything from side shows to
dance halls to offer the crowd.

Thursday, the second day of the festival, opened
with a luncheon at Lilly Court which featured a men's
fraternities review of the latest in women's hats. Later
in the afternoon couples crowded the Syria Mosque
for a tea dance, and in the evening there were more
laughs for the crowds at the Vets Review in Stephen
Foster Memorial. This Vet's Review, which was
sponsored by the Veteran's Association, produced a
show that reminded the campus of the pre—war
traditional Cap and Gown show. Due to a capable
staff the Vets managed to put together a show manned
by amateurs in a month's time that would have been
a credit to a professional group.

Friday was Tap Day with its air of excitement and
expectation. Students were tapped to honoraries, Hall
of Fame and Senior Queen, Alma Mater and ODK
Awardee were announced. In the stadium that after-
noon there were float parades and other women's
and men's events.

Pitt's l946 Spring Festival was climaxed by the
grand Mardi Gras Ball Saturday night featuring the
tick tock rhythm of Gray Gordon. Spring Festival
Mardi Gras was over, but the progress toward Back-
to-Normal Spring Festivals will be remembered.

A FORTUNE

has been spent
for their health

and comfort

No, this Dad and Mother aren't millionaires.
But no millionaires could do more for their
children's health and comfort. Because these far-
sighted parents are planning their new home the
American-Standard way—with heating equip-
ment and plumbing ﬁxtures that merit the mark
of American-Standard.

This mark of merit guides them to much more
than heating and plumbing. It assures their
family the results of many millions of dollars
spent in research, a fortune spent in developing
better materials, better methods of production,
better products at the lowest possible prices.

It stands for the skill of experienced engineers
and the talents of master designers working to-
gether to promote greater health and comfort for
the nations’ homes.

By selecting American-Standard, they are buy-
ing for their children all the beneﬁts that the
biggest name in the heating and plumbing busi-
ness provides—health, comfort, a better stand-
ard of living.

It's one of the most important decisions they
may ever have to make. So they are buying the
finest—bur it costs them no more

Your Estate-

wlzy will it be SEPARATELY handled?

 

I ET us say that you have practically decided to name

us as executor and trustee of your estate.

You know how well we have weathered depressions, past
and present. You are sure your family's interests would be

understandingly handled.

Just one question may remain in your mind: “VVill the
investments you make for my trust be mingled with those
of other estates and trusts?”

Emphatically NO, we answer. Not only would that be
contrary to long-established practice in handling trusts, but
it would be illegal. Such investments must not be mingled
with each other.

Be assured your estate will be handled by us separately, as
a unit. Furthermore, the investments of your trusts will
not, in any sense, be a part of the assets of our institution.

Now, with this point settled, why not come in and arrange
for the safe settlement of your affairs.

APPRECIATION

The 1946 Owl is completed. Final pictures, final layout, final
copy, final proof pasting, final proofing—all is ﬁnished. To ade-
quately acknowledge my appreciation to the people who have
helped make this possible is not easy, so I will simply say "thank
you": to Mac for making a 1946 Owl financially possible; to
Moe for always being there when I needed you, for being my
left hand through the year; to Lee for all the pictures that never
would have been taken if you hadn't "come through", for your
help on all parts of the book; to Franklin for the many Write—ups
that were written in my "favorite style", for your "put them on
straight" ideas; to Mr. Wise for helping solve many engraving
problems; to Mr. Sullivan for your sincere interest in the OWL, for
showing us how to work the efficient way; to Mrs. Starrett for the
answers to many editorial questions; to Mr. Gullion for helping
produce a book; to Dean Biddle and Dr. Isaacs for helpful sug-
gestions for the OWL; to Dr. Fitzgerald and the Publications Board
for helping solve OWL difficulties; to the faculty and administra-
tion for your cooperation; to Photo-Reflex Studio for many fine
pictures; to Mr. Iarret for that special photography; to Gray
Printing Co. for their cooperation; to my staff for all the work
that goes into publishing a yearbook; to Mrs. Moss for your
belief there would be a 1946 OWL; to Arline for introducing me to
the OWL. Thank you all for making a 1946 OWL a reality.
