The Office the
Registrar

95

96

The office of the registrar is the most student
service oriented office on the Pitt campus. The
OWL talked with registrar Richard V. Alls-
house about some of the services and changes
in regis tration.

Dr. Allshouse comes from a family where Pitt
has been a tradicion. He received his BS.,
M. Ed., and Ph.lQ. from Pitt. His experience in
education is vast; he has taught high school,
served as school principal, chief school admin-
istrator, and school board director. Here at
Pitt Dr. Allshouse has served as the Assistant
Dean of General Studies, and the Assistant
Registrar before becoming Registrar in 1967.

Dr. Allshouse has received many awards and
honors including the Delta Sigma Pi man of
the year award in 1971, the Pitt Band award,
and he is a member of Phi Delta Kappa an
educational honorary.

OWL: Any student who has gone to
Pitt during the past four years has
seen many changes in the registrar's
office — could you comment on these
changes?

ALLSI-IOUSE: Before I talk about
change I want to say we are student
service oriented. That is why we are
here — to serve the students. Most of
the major changes have been made
during my five years as registrar. Hir-
ing students and student government
leaders has been one avenue of
change. Every week I asked these stu-
dents to report to me on their observa-
tions and make recommendations for
improvement. It was these students’
recommendations that have brought
about the majority of the changes we
have made. You may recall the long
waiting line in the halls.

OWL: Yes, they were bad.

ALLSHOUSE: Well, we have tried to
cut the waiting time down but still
there is a wait, so we have made the
wait more pleasant with piped in mu-
sic and a large air conditioned waiting
area so students can see the entire
operation, not just lockers in a hall-
way. My staff and I had to sacrifice
our office area to do this, but we try to
make things pleasant for the students.
In fact where else would the registrar
have such a small unprivate office?

We have put all of our personnel on a
four day week. They work longer days
but have longer weekends. This has
proved highly successful for the per-
sonnel as well as our office, and also
the students. My people claim they
have happier marriages due to the

,|'9kﬂw~waﬂe»=«44t>«~V%x1~r6m-cu-.>w

four day week. Also we have had a
considerable drop in absenteeism and
less personal fatigue. The four day
week puts more trained people on the
counters for longer periods of time
which provides greater efficiency for
our office and the students. Our office
now has many more degree people
than before, and since they have been
students they understand the prob-
lems and hassles that students have.
This again benefits the students.

OWL: The mechanics of registration
are often confusing. What advances
have you made in this area?

ALLSHOUSE: We have made time
schedules available to the advisor and
the student sooner, so that they can
plan their schedule prior to the open-
ing day of registration. Also we have
made the "classes closed" list avail-

2.,

   
 

   

able more quickly so the advisors can
now have a daily or bi-daily accurate
list of closed sections rather than the
usually inaccurate weekly list. In co-
operation with the advisors and de-
partments of The College we now
permit students to drop closed sec-
tions and make course substitutions
without getting the advisor’s signa-
ture each time. This has considerably
accelerated the registration procedure
and cut down on student and staff
frustration, and paper work.

OWL: Outside of Registration what
services does your office offer?

ALLSHOUSE: Before answering that
let me say that my office has a greater
contact and interface with students
then any other department. We have
over 1/4 million contacts with the
students each year. I have trained my

97

staff to help students, not tell them
off or give them the run—around. This
policy has paid off because a few
years ago when registrars offices
across the nation were the target for
bombing and sit ins, we had no prob-
lems at all. In fact, our ground floor
location would have made it easy for
attack — there simply was none.

Now, back to the services. We have
established temporary passes and ID’s
for those students who have not re-
ceived invoices or have unpaid in-
voices. These passes permit students
to attend games and other University
functions they could attend otherwise
not due to the red tape. Our office
provides transcripts, grade reports,
and diplomas. The distribution time
for these has been greatly decreased
because of the new machines. For
example, within 24 hours a transcript

98

can be mailed — it used to take up to 2
weeks. The price of transcripts has
been reduced considerably, and we
provide the postage. Other services
include certification, selective service
certification, and Photo ID Cards —
As well as cheaper transcripts and
greatly improved communication
between advisors and our office. An-
other important service I should men-
tion is the notary public, which is free
to students who need these services
for university matters.

OWL: Your office relies heavily on
the Data Center here at Pitt — could
you comment on your relationship
with them?

ALLSHOUSE: We have to rely on
them. We have no control over them.
Sometimes they are not aware of the

human element and they pretend it
isn’t there. I have in my desk several
letters from students who have had
such problems with red tape and run
around answers that they have with-
drawn from the University and have
transferred to smaller schools with
less red tape and less problems. This
is sick. After all, the University is here
for the student, in fact we need stu-
dents to exist.

OWL: What improvements or
changes are needed for the future?

ALLSHOUSE: The present structure
of the University places the registrar
under the Vice Chancellor of Opera—
tions. We are classified with building
& grounds, maintenance, and physical
plant. This makes it rather difficult
for us to change. In fact the registrar's

position at Pitt does not have the abil-
ity to invoke Change. Change is need-
ed if we want to continue to serve the
students and faculty. We feel diplo-
mas and certification should be avail-
able soon after graduation — this is
possible if we can get co—operation
from all areas of the University. Late
fees and transcript charges, under cer-
tain circumstances, should be
dropped. Better printers would pro-
vide clearer transcripts and give Pitt
happier alumni and probably more
alumni funds. After all, who wants to
give to a university that caught you in
red tape after graduation?

I would finally like to say again we are
not (or should not be) running a busi-
ness, but a University, and the main
concern and purpose of our office is
student service.

CAMPUS POLICE

jg.’

100

One of the most vital services to the Universi-
ty is the Campus Police Force. The ()WL
talked with the superintendant of the force,
Joseph Gill, about some important aspects of
campus security.

OWL: What differentiates a campus
policeman from a city policeman?

GILL: Very little. The campus police-
man is a commissioned officer just
like a Pittsburgh policeman. He is not
a security guard. He receives the same
law enforcement training as a state
policeman.

OWL: What service does the Campus
police force provide?

GILL: The force is part of the Physical
Plant Department and provides pro-
tective service to the university ”fami—
ly" - students, faculty, and staff, and
university property. In addition, the
force provides ambulance service and
medical needs. The jurisdiction of the
campus police includes the property
of the university and its adjoining
areas. This develops into a unique sit-
uation in that there are overlapping
areas of jurisdiction with the city po-
lice in the urban area.

OWL: What changes has the force
undergone in the last few years?

GILL: There have been a number of
changes. The force has grown from 2.2
to 125 people over the last five years,
with the addition of more Black offi-
cers and women joining the depart-
ment. An investigative department
has been added. And the force was
unionized about 2 1/2 years ago. But
over the last year there has been a
minimum of change to allow stability.
The department now is actually a
model for other schools. A number of
universities located in large urban
areas have come to Pitt to study our
system. However, the force will con-
tinue to strive for better training for
all of its officers.

OWL: Is there good rapport between
the students and the police?

GILL: The attitude of the police to-
ward the students ranges from dislike
to approval. However, in general, the
police have a high regard for the stu-
dents, and the students respect the

 

police, the integration of officers has
helped, and a number of the officers
take courses at the university as part-
time students. Also the average age of
the police officers is very close to that
of the students, and this helps to
bring the students and police closer
together.

101

Yet all experience is an arch where
thro’ gleams that untrav elled world
whose margin fades for ever and for
ever when I move.

Central Printing is one of the unsung secices
0/ the University. The services of Central
Printing are diverse and unique. The are used
in some form by the entire University. The
()WL toured the central printing facilities in
the Cathedral basement and talk with Mr.
C.B. Beers, the plant manager.

OWL: What are some of the services
offered by Central Printing?

BEERS: We print all internal Univer-
sity publications. These include de-
partment publications, examinations,
information sheets, etc. Central Print-
ing also prints a great deal of the Uni-
versity forms, such as transcript
forms, grade reports, and invariable
other department and administrative
forms.

OWL: Your department also handles
University and U.S. mail, right?

BEERS: Yes, we have two divisions,
U.S. and University Mail. We have
several substations through out the
University to deliver mail and provide
duplication service. We are proud of
Campus Mail service. It is as fast as
possible and the mistakes are very
few. All out going US. mail goes
through our postage. We, of course,
bill the sender for the mailing. Central
printing also handles all "mail out:" —

103

like letters to students, parents and
alumni as well as invoices and grade
reports.

OWL: Have there been any major
changes in your plant in the past few
years?

BEERS: I think the biggest one oc-
curred two years ago when we moved
from Henry Street to the Cathedral
basement. This move gave us more
room and a much needed central loca-
tion. Our present plant has the most
up-to-date facilities and best technical
knowledge available.

OWL: Is your plant always running at
full capacity?

104

BEERS: On the average, yes. Prior to
the opening of school and towards the
end of terms we experience our busi-
est seasons. In fact it is at this time
that we are really understaffed. We
usually can give good service al-
though, in printing, everything was
needed yesterday I

OWL: Do you anticipate any major
changes in the future?

BEERS: I really am not a crystal ball
gazer so it is hard to say. We are not
planning any major changes. We hope
to continue to provide a good and
adequate service to the University and
its students.

SYSTEMS

ADMINISTRATIVE

In the past few years the computer is becom-
ing more and more involved with all phases of
the University. The OWL talk with Mr. Neale
Grunstra, Director 0fAdministrative Systems
about some of the changes and services in his
department.

Mr. Grunstra received his B.S. degree from
Fairlieghly—I)ickens0n University and his MS.
degree from Duquesne. Prior to coming to the
University, Mr. Grunstra has worked with
several data processing firms, including
Honeywell and Jerrold Electronics. Mr. Grun-
stra is a member of the honorary Omicron Del-
ta Epsilon.

OWL: I would think that computers
would be a fast changing field. Have
you made many changes in the past
year?

GRUNSTRA: Yes, we have made
several. A big change is in our hard-
ware. We have a new IBM 360 model
50 computer with very adequate stor-
age and telecommunications facilities.
This new ability has enabled us to
place at the complaint center a termin-
al which is on line to the student file,
so that if there is a problem with reg-
istration or invoicing the terminal can
display in about 5 seconds the record
of the student for the past 5 terms. At
the present time grades do not appear
on the record. An other innovation for
us is the use of optically scanned
grade sheets. Now, an instructor no
longer has to sign a card for each stu-
dent. The instructor places the grade
for all students on a single sheet
which is signed and sent to us. The
advantages are many, the instructor
can not easily withhold a student's
grade and the grades are thus reported
and posted quicker. Also, the need to
punch and sort grade cards is elimi-
nated. Finally, we have 14 new pro-
gram systems which are providing
more efficient and better service to all
areas of the University.

OWL: What do you anticipate for the
future in Administrative Systems and
its service to the University and ulti-
mately the students?

CRUNSTRA: We hope to continue to
provide a good efficient service to all
our users. We have attempted to do
this in the past and will continue to
improve this service. I think the big-
gest changes for the near future will
be in the handling of registrations,
grades and invoices.

OWL: Could you discuss some of the
services both for students and the
University that Administrative Sys-
tems provides.

GRUNSTRA: First of all, we are a
division of the Vice Chancellor of
Operations office, so our primary
service is in that area. The specific
services include:

Registration and Invoicing processing
— 30,000 per term,

Grade Reports — 30,000 per term
Enrollment data and statistics

Mailing lists for all divisions of the
University

Financial reporting —— both income

and expenditures

Payroll — 10,000 per month

State loan applications

Admission records

95,000 Alumni records

Physical Plant processing of invoices,
labor costs, and expenses

OWL: You said before that you are a
division of Operations, are your serv-
ices restricted to this area?

GRUNSTRA: Primarily yes. We do
provide service to related areas,
though, such as admissions.

OWL: What are some of the problems
that Administrative systems faces; are
they student oriented or University
oriented?

CRUNSTRA: Actually, they are nei-
ther. The biggest problem that we face
is the vastly different forms of data or
input that we receive from our differ-
ent users, and in the processing serv-
ices that they require. I would like to
add here that the students have been
very cooperative with us. They give
us few problems.

The OWL talks with Mr. John Vrana, Director
of Housing, about some important aspects and
changes in housing.

OWL: What are some of the changes
you have seen in housing during the
past few years?

VRANA: The biggest change has
occurred within the past three years.
The living pattern of students has
completely changed. For example; we
have 24 hour visitation, elimination of
curfews, and co-ed housing.

OWL: Have you seen much social
change?

VRANA: Yes, in the areas indicated

previously.

OWL: Housing is obviously your big-
gest service, what other services are
offered?

VRANA: We offer many sub—serv—
ices: maid service, maintenance serv-
ice, and off—campus housing services
for both placement and grievance
processing.

’ OWL: What are the present capacities

for housing?

VRANA: We can house 3500 stu-
dents, about 1900 women and 1600
men. Sororities are included in that
figure.

OWL: What are some of the problems
your office has that students are not
aware of?

VRANA: The biggest problem is fi-
nance. We are not subsidized by the
University. We are an auxiliary of the
University. Our cost, therefore, must
be met by our income. There are two
ways to meet the growing costs. One,
pass it on to the students, and two,
cut services. This past year we did not
raise housing rates (the first time in 4
years) but we did have to alter a few
services, ie linen exchange.

Another problem is the increasing
demand for housing. This has caused
us to impose rigid deadlines for appli-
cation which students should meet. I
often did not meet deadlines, there-
fore, I sympathize with the students,
but never the less, we need the
deadlines.

Finally there are universal problems
which are common to all campus
housing. You have to live with them.

OWL: You have been at the Universi-
ty for the past 7 years, what changes
have you seen in students attitudes?

VRANA: Students today are more
concerned not only about the Univer-
sity but about the entire world around
them. They are ready to speak up and
voice their opinions and concerns.
They have established a greater inter-
face with the University; I think this
is good. Certainly, today's students
are active, not passive.

OWL: In order to serve students well,
physical changes in housing facilities
must be made. What changes has your
office made in the past year or so?

VRANA: We have had, thanks to
Vice Chancellor Dutton, $100,000 to

do major renovations in the Towers.
These renovations include:

1) New lounge furniture for both
house and lobby lounges.

2) We have enclosed the house
lounges with glass doors, so no longer
is it a large empty elevator lobby but a
place to study and meet with friends.
3) Conference rooms have been estab-
lished so student organizations can
hold meetings, in fact, faculty can
conduct classes in them.

4) Working with M.D.C., the Litch-
field T.V. Lounge in Tower A lobby
was established for the students.

5) General maintenance has also been
done. We have repainted 70% of the
rooms, 80% of the halls and refloored
20% of the Towers. ‘

6) In short, we have tried to make the
housing less sterile — I think the stu-
dents will be pleasantly surprised.

continued on next page

119

OWL: Do you think students will
respect the changes and take care of
the new facilities?

VRANA: I hope so. I think they will. I
am positive they will.

OWL: Although off-campus housing
is not directly part of University
housing, it does house a great percen-
tage of the students. What is that per-
centage and what are your general
comments on off campus housing?

VRANA: It continues to be high in
price and low in quality. it is just a law
of economics; the demand for housing
is greater than the supply and the stu-
dents suffer. Almost 2/3 of the stu-
dents live off campus and the supply
of good housing is critical. Students
today are at last forming unions and
organizing to work for uniform
standards, rent, and living conditions.
Medieval university students had to
do the very same thing to improve
their housing conditions.

OWL: What are some of the reasons
for students wanting off campus
housing?

VRANA: We, of course, cannot house
every student, so non-University
housing is a must. An other reason is
that many students want to do their
own cooking, and our facilities cannot
permit this. Also, students living in
University housing must agree to buy
a meal ticket. Many students think
rent is cheaper off campus —— It simply
is not. Rent here is $70 a month and it
is close to campus. However, money
can be saved by off campus cooking
rather than having the University
food service. In apartments, students
can live alone or select their room-
mates; this is not always possible
here. If we could offer apartments
with cooking facilities, we would, lit-
erally have to have a lottery, because
the demand would be so great.

OWL: Margret Mead once said, "Uni-
versities should wash their hands of
dormitories.” How do you feel about
this?

VRANA: I agree with Dr. Mead. The
University could develop its plant for
better use in the future — after all, the
University's business is academic not

120

housing. Until the market can supply
good housing and meet the demands
we must provide some housing. I
might add here that many on campus
and off campus living patterns are
very much the same.

OWL: This past year the Resident
Assistant became a division of Stu-
dent Affairs rather than a division of
housing. What brought about these
changes?

VRANA: It is a dean of students
thing. The R.A.'s role is not only to
provide leadership, but also to partic-
ipate in a leadership program where
the RA. gives a lot but gains much
more. Being under student affairs, we
feel the communication lines between
R.A.’s, students, and the University
can be improved to provide the stu-
dent with better service. After all, my
job as director is to see that the plant
is operational. This is a full time job,
and so is heading the RA. program.
Now that the R.A.’s are under the
Dean of Students, I have more time to
do my job, and the student can
benefit.

OWL: What are some of the projects
you can see and recommend for the
future?

VRANA: In the type of facilities; ad-
ditional apartment housing with ca-
pacities for 400-600 students would
help a great deal. Students lead a very
active life and they need recreation
facilities to unwind and relax. If we
could provide these in close proximity
to the housing areas I think it would
be a great improvement, and there
would be waiting lines and lists to
use these recreational facilities.

OWL: Can you comment on future
policies and problems?

VRANA: The University is finally
stabilizing its growth and now we can
start to utilize our space and facilities
to best advantage. It is difficult to
predict problems because if you can
predict them then you may be able to
solve them and you simply can never
predict what all your problems may
be.

With September comes a new academic year and a new extra-curricular cycle. There are a myriad of academic ill-
nesses but these can be forgotten in the social whirl. Here too, however, there are important worries. Two major
problems plague Pitt programming; first, the scope of the programs, and second, the publicity of the events.

The first concert of the term was afﬂicted with the changing sickness. The Blood, Sweat, and Tears Concert be-
came a movable feast as first one night and then another was announced as the long-awaited day. Later, in Octo-
ber,ticket sellers crossed the name off the ticket as the triple bill for Homecoming became a double shot when
Buddy Miles cancelled. And everyone remembers the sell—out Isaac Hayes Concert that never came off.

This chameleon-like atmosphere surrounding events adds to the uncertainty and lack of real knowledge or publici-
ty. Most students are unaware of what is happening, and because of the perpetual instability of events, when they
do hear something they don’t believe it.

The problem of planning and publicizing university activities raises a number of questions. If one agency planned
and controlled programming, would news be surer and would there be a wider diversity of types of entertainment?
Or does programming by many factions ensure that the greatest number of people are satisfied even though it
means repetition of some styles and neglect of other ideas? What ever the answer, one must be found.

The varied and untypical programs produced by factions, and the entertaining and informative events planned by

the university all serve the community and especially the individual. This personal development is important be-
cause not all learning is confined to a classroom.

134

“There is no organization on campus which works to fill out the programming, no one who can take an overview, no one

saying what is being missed. What is needed is a co—ordinated effort to fulfill the total needs of the Pitt student so that
there is neither overlapping nor neglection occurring.”

Affirmative Action is an important part of the University’s hiring policy on faculty and staff additions. Qualitative
positions, however, and not just quantitative posts are important to the overall position of women in the Universi-
ty community. For hiring practices is only one side reﬂecting the ambiguity of women at Pitt.

Aside from faculty and staff, an important segment of women at Pitt are students. Their quandry was highlighted
by October’s Homecoming festivities and the selection of the Pitt Woman. This was the 1971 solution to the prob-
lem of Homecoming Queen. It has often been voiced that queen competitions are an exploitation of a woman’s
physical attributes. The Pitt Woman, however, was designed to judge contestants on their contributions to the
University. Whether the new idea succeeded or not is debatable. In a subsequent issue of the “Pitt News,” three
different opinions were expounded. One article said that the Pitt Woman was a good idea, one said that judging on
physical attributes had not been banished, and one said that nothing was wrong with a traditional beauty queen.
All this merely goes to show that no one really understands the role of a woman. Is she to be considered on a pedes-
tal, as a progressive force, or as one of the boys? Or is her role none of these?

Women as faculty, staff, and students have many ways to choose. But the most important change can not be forced
by policy-making agencies. It is a change of opinion; women must understand themselves, and the university-
community must accept this self—knowledge.

144

“If even one area of the University is not in compliance with affirmative action regulations, so far as the Department of

Health, Education, and Welfare is concerned, the entire University is out of compliance and federal funds could be cut
of .”

Jan Feagans, Associate Director
of the AffirmatiueActi0n Office, quoted
in “University Times, ”June I, 1972

“DEAR PARENTS . . .

On behalf of the Parents Weekend Com-
mittee I am proud to welcome you to Par-
ents Weekend, 1971. We have planned for
you activities both enjoyable and enlighten-
ing which will give you a chance to share in
some of the campus events with your son or
daughter, and observe the way of life of the
University.

Through our group discussions we hope to
present to you an idea of some of the every-
day problems confronting students. Also
this is an opportunity to communicate ideas
and feelings between us.

Presenting an accurate picture of the di-
versity of campus life in a few days is a huge
undertaking but we hope this weekend will
make you more aware of the things we expe-
rience every day.

Black. To make black paint, all the colors of the spectrum must be mixed together. But to make a Black Week,
what events must be mixed? And to make a black spirit, what people must be included? The black student at Pitt
is many strains.

On Pitt’s campus, there is the black activist who is concerned with issues, there is the frat-cat who sits in the Stu-
dent Union, there is the apathetic black who acts much like his white counterpart, and there is the black student
who diligently goes to classes. These types are identical to the classifications given to the general university body
except for one word — black. For whatever his traits, a black man realizes his distinguishing trait and glories in it.
This is why there is a Black Week.

To fulfill the needs of the multi—faceted black student population, a varied program was designed. Speakers, per-
formances, and concerts -all showed today’s black. Besides showing black culture, however, Black Week also
showed the integration of Black into American culture with the spectacular turn out for the Ike and Tina Turner
Concert. Perhaps a wide publication of events would have drawn many peoples to the informative and interesting
events planned for this only major November program.

Whatever Black Week’s good-points or short—coming, it did underline one very imporant aspect of black Pitt. It
showed that the black at Pitt is the best black, with a mixture of the spectrum of human interests.

164

“Every black person is subject to pressures that are unendurable — pressures to stay in, pressures to
stay out. There is the constant kind of feeling that he doesn’t have the right to enjoy things that are
denied to the vast majority of his people. No white person experiences that in so forceful way - it’s
impossible for white faculty and students to understand black feelings.”

Dr. I)‘ L. Ammermcm,
from the Florida State UrLiL‘er.s'ity Yearbook, 1971

On a campus Where movies can draw capacity crowds every Weekend, where does live theater fit? The Studio Thea-
tre is one of the groups which brings the special personal entertainment of the stage on campus. This year’s produc-
tions proved that live theater should have a greater portion of student interest.

The Studio Theatre offers to this campus something no other entertainment can offer — participation. By its con-
stitution, it is open to the Whole university. Writing, graphics, acting, and directing are talents which are devel-
oped through active involvement. But its appeal goes beyond this; the Studio Theatre reaches out to anyone.

The student stage offers for a minimal price the excitement of live action. There is the pressure of not being able to
appeal a false movement, a wrong word, or an inaccurate expression. The limitations of the live theater become
boundless in the theater in the round like this year’s “Don’t Forget the Dodo.” There is the informative inventive-
ness of “Thoreau” which is the original production combining past with present. With “An Evening of Dance”
came a variety which is not available anywhere else but at a university.

The stage has much to offer the participants and the audience. And it is important for every individual to under-
stand that What you choose to attend is only part of the decision. Important to the total experience of life and the
search for happiness is what you choose not to see. The college years are often the last chance to experiment with a
wide range of activities. With the breadth of subject and style offered by live stage, attending the Studio Theatre is
a choice worth making. -

With 1972 came the Public Interest Research Group or PIRG. It was an organized Nader-like inquiry into government
and industry. Multi-leveled in approach, it involved faculty with students, older proffessionals with young Volunteers,
and change with solidified systems.

PIRG became a campus event because of a much discussed problem in funding. A petition where students agreed to con-
tribute $2.00 per term through the academic invoice system was signed by 9,000 students in February. This and an alter-
native system of voluntary fees on the invoice were both vetoed by the University for a number of reasons.

The ultimate outcome is still in question as seniors leave for the real world. Most would agree especially after this closer

look that public interest inquiry could serve a definite purpose in our culture..But even a degree does not give the insight
of how to solve this problem that could help those remaining at the University.

For 1972 graduates, this year’s student government was the third system which they had endured during their ten-
ure at Pitt. As freshmen they saw the old student government president and senate, status-conscious, apathetic,
and ineffectual. In 1971 the commissioner system became the ideal, but isolation, rumor, and again ineffectiveness
were the fact. The dawn of the new constitution in the fall term heralded a cohesive governing body designed to leg-
islate for all students. Whether this is truely possible on a campus as heterogeneous as Pitt is debatable.

The new constitution has succeeded, never the less, in that representatives were elected who were easily accessible
to communication and ideas and who were widely diversified including a woman and a black. “The Pitt News” also
made a commitment so that student government debates and decisions were disseminated via the magic of the

press.

There has been an effort to control the allocations committee, to bring student voices to university committees,
and to represent the student on university-wide issues. PIRG, faculty tenure, community relations, and legal and
medical advising have all been openly considered as they pertain to every student.

So there has been a progression in systems. Rather than just another in—group of 1970, or the special interest fac-
tions of 1971, the 1972 student government went beyond interest groups and programming and jumped into the
realm of real issues. They have tried to tackle the problems of co—ordinatirig but not controlling diversity and work-
ing on not talking about student concerns.

In the context of the general welfare of a community, would the first inventor of the wheel have performed a service
to his community if he refused to tell anybody? Following the same reasoning, when the student is paying an activ-
ities fee for programs, he ought to be well informed. Special programs at Pitt are designed for the whole University
community. Topics like witchcraft, Jesus, abortion, .and prison reform have a wide appeal; they are central issues
in major books, on TV shows, of Broadway productions, and in congressional houses. However, programs like the
Witchcraft Symposium, the Jesus Festival, the A B C’s of Abortion, and the Prison Reform Program all failed to
draw Pitt audiences. That these interesting and timely planned affairs did not reach the majority of the university
community was largely because of a lack of publicity.

A good title may garner initial interest, but if no one knows the details the program is doomed. A specific like the
credentials of the speakers is important on Pitt’s campus where only big names usually draw. Time is important in
programing on a commuter campus. Publicity on the location is essential because there is no one lecture hall on
campus. All are important considerations when programing is undertaken for the university community.

Perhaps the final judgment on programing can not give points for good ideas or good intentions. When spending
university money every effort must be made to reach the whole community, giving individuals the choice of not
attending or attending. A

Many stock comments are made throughout the year about engineers and Greeks; engineers wear white socks and
carry slide rules, while Greeks have continual beer blasts and never go to classes. Somewhere in these epithets is a
spark of truth, buried deep by the exaggeration; somewhere in these comments there is also a spark of jealousy,
hidden by a blaise attitude. For here are two groups who stand apart through choice, and these are the groups

which program weeks especially named for them.

There are many reasons why Greek Week and Engineers Week both are successes. And the fact that they are
unique and rewarding experiences cannot be denied. Today, when most events are designed to spotlight one aspect
of university life, entertainment, issues, or knowledge, these groups produce the exact opposite. Rather than the
particular, the engineers and Greeks program multi-events. The Engineers Week included a play, a games day, a
parade, an engineering display, and a concert. The Greeks participated in a charity drive, a talent show, a quiz con-
test, a charity dinner, and a group sing. The closing note for these various events in both cases was a fun-filled

formal.

Formall? They supposedly went out with spike heels and slick backs. Instead, this year’s only two formals showed
more than just tradition. They showed the freedom to dress as you want as guys refused to shell out for tuxes.
Along with the 18 year old vote, many clamored for the 18 year old LCB, as drinks ﬂowed. And of course the music
was today. The formals displayed all that was a Pitt student today: independent, mature, and alive.

Greek Week and Engineers Week, with multi—events and formals, seemed to involve more people into a spirit of
awareness than any other program throughout the year, whether it lasted an hour or a week. These are the only two
events which brought traditions back on campus. Involvement was so great and interest ran so high with the
groups, that even bystanders felt the need for these traditional events. These were the moments when everyone
wished they were an engineer or a Greek.

“Within the George Hubbard Clapp Gates in the Cathedral’s Commons Room, couples at the Christmas Ball dance to
the music of Ray Eberle’s orchestra. The pastel shaded gowns, the bright tree decorations, and the dreamy music all
blended together to make it ‘the perfect night’ .”

“It is true we make no ‘Vows.’ But is a ‘vow’ neces-

matters of sufficient importance and difficulty to

What is the University‘?

15

APRIL 1972

. and after the ceremony which started the graduates on the sea of life, what happened‘? These seas seemed very
rough this year as the ship of state’s economic rudder caused great waves. But these waves weren’t bringing many
jobs to shore.

The standard question this year was, “Got a job or are you going back to grad school?” These seemed the alterna-
tives. Many who were lucky knew what they were going to do, and stepped ri ;ht into the establishment with pay-
checks and charge cards. For many though, it was a temporary return becau: a it was back to grad school and secu-
rity in the fall.

A return bout with professors and books promised many things to many people. Sometimes a professional school
beckoned with the promise of a dreamed-of goal; sometimes any department called with the preparation for a
hoped—for job.

But somewhere between college life and grad school or jobs, many ideals and dreams hit hard rocks. Gone was the
time and energy once applied to causes. Environment, women’s rights, and even politics became something else to
talk about, like the weather. Activism became confined to actively looking for money to buy that new car or to pay
more tuition.

Perhaps the hardest lesson a graduate had to learn was using his knowledge and maturity, won through four years
of experience. This knowledge and experience was, of course, necessary on thenjob or in the classroom. But this was
only a small part of what the undergrad had learned. Working with people for shared goals became limited to work
that had to be done. Adrift from the college atmosphere begging participation, too many graduates’ fell into the rut
of going to work or class and coming home. The thrust to get out and to act atrophied.

Perhaps graduates should have learned that the choice between grad school and jobs was not their last choice. The
ultimate goal was whether the graduate could make his ideals and knowledge part his society. This is where you
sink or swim in the sea of life.

The Good, The Original, and The New

Pitt programming is a ball of string, overlapping, seemingly endless, and pieced together. Tradi-
tions like Homecoming and Latem Night, events like Blood, Sweat, and Tears and Ralph Na-
der, and non-events like studying in the library and going to the Tuck Shop all knotted students

together for a while only to have them break immediately into the mass of tangled university
life.

Only one “event” seemed to tie in each student sooner or later. It had everything a student could
want: low cost, close proximity, student patronage, startling variety, and a cast of thousands. It
was, of course, a weekend at the movies.

Cota, UCIS, Franklin Pangborn, and‘ the Social Sub—committee unraveled a steady supply of
everything from a Garbo festival to a Japanese spectacular to “Love story”. Film proved itself to
this campus to be the true contemporary art form. It, at once, interested and catered to the
mass audience, and at the same time, it involved and intrigued the individual. This year proved
that celluloid can bind this campus better than any other program.

“Student Publications provide a unique service to the campus. They have the dual role of being informational and enter-
taining. They reach more students than any other group of activities. Unfortunately, current staff shortages have made
it difficult for the publications to fulfill this role. Only if the staffs are built back to their full size will the campus get the

full benefit of having an independent student press.”

The Pitt Capsule is the student publication of the School
of Pharmacy. The themes of drug abuse and of national
health care problems occupy prime space in the maga-

include the development of a social conscience. The Pitt
Capsule offers the opportunity to become aware of and
involved in health care, education, and problems.

The Undergraduate Academic Review serves as a source of
information on courses and instructors and is a means for
the student to evaluate their instructors and classes and
serves as a medium of discussion on current academic is-
sues. The present Undergraduate Academic Review first
appeared in the fall of 1970 having been previously pro-
duced by a committee of Student Government. From its
initial attempts, the U.A.R. has developed a fully compu-
terized evaluation and worked with the CAS Center for the
Improvement of Teaching to design a more sophisticated
questionnaire. The UAR intends to devote greater atten-
tion to questions facing the academic community.

“If you look for radical changes in the service organizations, you’ll find them right beside the tradi-
tional ideas. There is a drug counseling center, but there are still tours of the Cathedral given by
Quo Vadis. There is a legal awareness Committee in Student Government, but the Homecoming
Committee is still there and stronger than ‘ever. Service organizations are nothing new, but many of

the services are.”

William J. Lenaghen,
Assistant Director of Student Activities

Student Government Board

The Student Government of the University of Pittsburgh
is composed of a seven member Board elected at large by
the undergraduate student body. Its primary function is
the governance of all recognized student social, academic,
and service activities on campus.

This years’ Student Government, under the astute leader-
ship of its president, Thomas Bailey, was very active on
the students’ behalf. Policies and ideas which have taken
shape and gained substance within the past year are as fol-

lows; the initiation of extensive remodeling in the towers
dorms, the formulation of a task force for a new student
union, pressure exerted on administration for student in-
put on faculty tenure decisions, tighter financial controls
on student monies, and the appointment of students to
function senatorial on committees. Plans for the future
include ligitimizing the activities fee through referendum
in the Winter term of 1973 and more public relations to
students from Student Government on all activities.

The General Studies Board is the governing and represent-
ative organ for the students of the school of General Stud-
ies. It has been very active this past year providing many
social and informative programs. These have included
numerous coffee houses, discusion sessions as well as sev-
eral concerts.

The board has also tried to make the general campus
aware of the general studies student and the School of
General Studies.

please seepage 556.

Engineering Student Cabinet

The Engineering Student Cabinet of 1972 was one which
will not be soon forgotten by the administration, faculty,
and the students of the School of Engineering.

Prior to this past year, the ESC had long been recognized
as an effective envoy of the engineering students, not only
in the engineering school, but in University activities as
well. But 1972 brought a profound depth and weath of ex-
perience to ESC which greatly enhanced the ability of the
Cabinet to succeed.

Under the highly capable and innovative inﬂuence of Pres.
Dennis P. Yeskey, together with V.P. Ronald Gronsky,
Treas. Joseph Bryan Sec. Leon DePalma. Physical Plant
Director Charles Bowers, and Central Planning Chairman
Andy Cornelius, Cabinet became more than simply the of-
ficial ambassador for the engineering students; it became
an instrument of unparalled efficiency in acting on behalf
of all engineering students, both in and out of the engineer-
ing school. Among the most productive projects of the
Cabinet: A special course evaluation specifically suited for
engineering courses, a freshman recruiting program
plus a special tour day for all admittees to the school,
and support and participation in the career seminars pro-
gram. On the lighter side was, of course, the towering suc-
cess of Engineer’s Week, capped by the Shamrock Ball and
the concert by the Fifth Dimension.

The official student organization for the undergraduate
student body is the Nursing Student Organization of the
University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing. It is composed
of all the undergraduate students of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Nursing, with representatives from
each class composing the Council, the governing body of
the organization. Its purpose is to provide channels for
communication between administration, students, and
faculty; to coordinate activities involving more than one
class; and to introduce to the members the existence of the
professional and pre—professional nursing organizations.

The Women’s Housing Board, one of the more established
campus organizations, represents the woman resident as
an individual. Through communication with the Adminis-
tration and Student Government, the board develops ﬂex-
ible codes of residence hall living.

Men’s Dorm Council

The Men’s Dormitory Council is the governing body for all Ken Krenicliy, President
male residents at the University’s dormitories. Rules to Ma” H“’W‘tZ’T“’aS“’e’

. A d S l ,S
govern all resident students are formulated by the M.D.C. n y 0 Oman ecretary

in cooperation with the Women’s Housing Board and the
Resident Assistants. In addition, the Men’s Dorm Council
serves as the liaison between the male students and the
Housing Office. Complaints and demands are heard by the
Housing Office via the M.D.C.

The main contribution of the Men’s Dorm Council in the
past year was the construction of a student lounge in the
Tower A lobby. The installation of pinball machines in the
main Towers’ lobby also proved to be a worthwhile invest-
ment. Other functions of the M.D.C. include cafeteria
dances and concerts. The Men’s Dormitory Council, there-
fore plays a dual role in providing entertainment and rule
making.

Gamma Sigma Sigma, the National Service Sorority at
the University of Pittsburgh, has been active in both Uni-
versity and public affairs. Some of their activities this past
year included organizing parties for patients at Forbes
Pavilion, collecting toys and clothing for the Indians, serv-

ing as foster parents to a child in South America, Christ- _

mas Caroling at Kane Hospital, organizing a hike to collect
funds for the March of Dimes, and collecting glass for
recycling.

On campus, the Sisters of Gamma Sigma Sigma provide
services such as selling candy at the Friday and Saturday
night movies along with helping Alpha Phi Omega with
their annual Book Exchange.

The purpose of ALPHA PHI OMEGA is to assemble col-
lege men in a NATIONAL SERVICEVFRATERNITY; to
develop LEADERSHIP, to promote FRIENDSHIP, and to
provide SERVICE to humanity; and further the freedom
that is our national, educational, and intellectual heritage.
Chapters of ALPHA PHI OMEGA are on more campuses

ﬁhan anypther fraternity because it is an inclusive, not an

exclusive organization.

At PITT, BETA CHAPTER’S biggest service to the cam-
pus is the USED BOOK EXCHANGE that is operated at
the beginning of each term. Here students have the oppor-
tunity to sell their used text books, and also buy books
that they’ll need for their own classes.

” hen service to either the CAMPUS, the COMMUNITY
' the NATION is needed, ALPHA PHI OMEGA is ready
.d willing to lend a helping hand.

Cwens

272

Cwens is a sophomore women’s national honorary society
that selects new members at the end of the freshman year
on the basis of scholarship, leadership, fellowship, and
service. i

The organization was founded here at Pitt in 1922 by Thry-
sa Amos. It now extends across most of the country and
has 26 active chapters.

Here at Pitt, as with all chapters, the organization is both
an academic honorary society and a service organization.
This past year, the sophomore Cwens have been active as
volunteers at the school for blind children, ﬂame bearers
for the traditional latern night services, and also sold sta-
tionery to name just a few of its deverse activities.

The members of Cwens are active people who enjoy work-
ing as individuals and as a group. They were selected be-
cause of their ability not only to maintain fine scholastic
standing, but also because of their interest and participa-
tion in important activities both on and off the Pitt

campus.

Commuter Association

During the 1972 school year the Commuter Association
experienced many new activities and changes. Social
events included dances, coffee houses and picnics in
Schenley Park. These provided a chance for commuters to
get to meet one another. The C.A. work with fellow com-
muters at C.M.U. to provide many commuters with rides.
After much pressure from the C.A., the Trees Hall parking
lot was opened to provide parking to commuters at reason-
able student rates. (Above picture was taken at the Trees
Hall lot.) C.A. pressure also caused the erection of bus
shelters on Forbes and Fifth avenues. These shelters were
warmly welcomed by the commuters during the past
winter.

The Commuter Association sponsored a P.A.T. (Port Au-
thority Transit) Day which proved to be quite a success as
the commuters listened to many speakers on subjects as
Skybus, pollution control of buses, and proposed new shel-
ters. The day concluded with discussions on new systems
of transportation as well as other commuter problems.

of social equality. Believing also that the traditional edu-
cational methods do not adequately meet the needs of our
urban communities.

A new organization at the University of Pittsburgh is Del-
ta Chapter of Collegiate Rainbow. It was organized to
make it possible for members of Rainbow Girls to continue
their Rainbow activities at college. This first year on cam-
pus Delta Chapter has provided a way of building friend-
ships by means of its meetings and also a way of giving
service to the college community. Places such as Child-
ren’s Hospital, Kane Hospital and Marion Manor received
hours of volunteer service from Collegiate Rainbow girls.
Delta Chapter did its part of fight starvation in the world
by supporting a world mission project with cancelled pos-
tage stamps. Just like many other campus organizations
Delta Chapter is concerned with the environment and this
year collected and delivered glass for recycling. Delta
Chapter is proud to be recognized at the University of
Pittsburgh and will continue to share with it the Rainbow
teachings of love and service.

Working to provide Pitt students with a meaningful voice
in the Democratic Party, the College Young Democrats
aim at increasing the political interests of many a young
voter. In order to accomplish this, the CYD has sponsored
workshops and has presented political speakers on the lo-
cal, state, and national levels.

Serving as a more or less campus campaign headquarters,
the Pitt CYD offers its members the oppurtunity to volun-
teer their services and Work for endorsed party candidates.
The organization has also been active in working with city
and county officials in helping students register to vote.

Yavneh, Religious Students Association, is an organiza-
tion which provides the ways and means for Orthodox Jew-
ish students to practice their religion and still function as
members of the total university community. Working out
of the B’nai B’rith Hillel Foundation office, Yavneh spon-
sors educational, cultural, and social programs and our
main event each year is our annual Shabbaton, held during
the Winter Trimester. The theme of this year’s shabbaton
was “Tzedeck, Tzedeck, Tirdof.”

Yavneh conducts two weekly classes throughout the year.
In connection with the Talmudical Institute of Pittsburgh,
we sponsor a “gem0ra shiur” which is led by Rabbi Leon
Guttman. We also conduct a class for girls in Jewish Laws
and Ethics, and it led by Rabbi Boris A. Rackovsky, the
Hillel Director. Our faculty advisor is Dr. Henry
Hausdorff.

Although Yavneh has been on campus only a few years, we
have increased our membership from a mere handful to
almost fifty today.

Arnold Air Society is a national honorary service organiza-
tion affilited with the Air Force and the Air Force ROTC.
Due to its honorary nature, the Society is very restrictive
in choosing its members from the University community.
All members in the Society have met high entrance re-
quirements that were established by the active members of
the organization. During the 1971-72 school year Arnold
Air Society has brought credit to the University, by spon-
soring and participation in many community projects, in-
cluding a UNICEF drive, parties at Childrerfs Hospital,
and a work party for the School for the Blind.

Angel Flight

Angel Flight is a national service organization which is
sponsored by the Arnold Air Society, an Air Force honor-
ary. Our goals are to serve the United States Air Force, the

The Scabbard & Blade Society is a national honorary or-
ganization for Air Force & Army ROTC cadets. Members
must maintain a 3.0 average in military studies and show
outstanding leadership qualities and officer potential. The
cadets serve as military honor guards at various ROTC
functions such as the military ball, through out the term.

The Army ROTC program is open to full or part-time un-
dergraduate or graduate students. The program is de-
signed to develop leadership and management qualities
required in both civilian and military life as well as to pre-
pare students to become officers in the Army or in the
United States Army Reserve. The program is offered via
two curricula, the two-year or four-year program with stu-
dents completing either curriculum being commissioned
as lieutenants in the Army Reserve. The four—year program
consists of eight terms divided into the Basic and the Ad-
vanced Course with no obligation incurred during the Bas-
ic Course. The two-year program is equivalent to the Ad-
vanced Course and has been developed for the students
transferring to the University who have had no previous
ROTC courses. A six—week basic summer camp provides
the equivalent of the Basic Course of the four-year pro-
gram. Army ROTC offers various scholarships to qualified
students along with a monthly allowance of $100 monthly
10 months a year for all advanced cadets and basic cadets
who hold ROTC scholarships. Qualified Army ROTC stu-
dents can obtain a private pilots license at no cost through
the program. Any student enrolled in Army ROTC can be
granted a draft deferment.

Recognized as the concert choir of the University, is com-
prised of students from all of Pitt’s undergraduate schools.
Besides appearing regularly at the Heinz Memorial Chap-
el, the Choir also provides concerts for University events,
and sponsors good-will concert tours to many schools,
churches, and communities.

This past year the Choir performed nine concerts on a tour
through the states of Ohio and New York, and also per-
formed in churches in Canada. A Christmas television
appearance was one of the group’s highlights.

Founded in 1928, Woman’s Choral has grown from a group
of girls who sang together only for their enjoyment, to a
group which now performs in concert with choral groups of
other schools and with the Men’s Glee Club. Performing at
various University functions occupies much of the group’s
schedule.

Highlighted this past year by an appearance on television,
Woman’s Choral also made concert tours to Drexel and
Capitol Universities.

The Franklin Pangborn Film Club is Pitt’s only outlet for
serious cinema buffs. In addition to programming under-
ground, foreign and “pop” film series, the club also offers
accredited courses in film making and the contemporary
cinema. During the year the club’s controvercial president
and founder, Pat O’Brien, became embroiled in several
fiery incidents with Student Government and university
administration over such items as admission prices, pro-
gramming, allowing non—students to films and club’s
finances.

Not unlike many campuses around the country, Greeks at
Pitt have had their difficulties. The Greek must contend
with the “rah—rah” stereotype, outdated rules and rituals,
and inter—Greek rivalry. Perhaps some fraternities and
sororities still resemble the Bobbie Brooks—and beer Greek
of yesteryear. But there are more that see this image giving
way to a new type of Greek: the individual who can’t iden-
tify with the original concepts behind the establishment of
fraternities, one who cares little for symbols, colors, and
ceremonies, one who simply enjoys the people he is living
with. Far more find value in that experience than in all the
pride and tradition contained in a particular set of ancient

letters.

The Greek system of today cannot be described as “dying
out.” What is dying is the old Greek system and its atti-
tudes. What lives is its modern derivation. The framework
is gradually being reconstructed to fit today — not 1930.
The dissension within the Greek system is beneficial. It
need not be justified, for it will impel the necessary
changes that must be made within the framework of the
system, thus serving to strengthen the foundation of the

system itself.

The changing philosophies of the system and the individu-
al Greek are evident. Pledge programs, once havens for
those who enjoy line-up inquisitions, paddling, and physi-
cal hazings, have been altered, often drastically. Hazing,
although still existing in a few houses, is now a rarety rath-
er than being commonplace. The whole program has been
altered. In most houses, this period is no longer called
“Pledge Training” but “Pledge Education.” The differ-
ence is very evident: New members are no longer trained
like animals to behave a certain way, but are educated in
the background of the group and are asked to act according

to the way they see the group should function.

One of the biggest changes that has occurred is in rush,
especially on the part of the fraternities. Most restrictions
are now taken away: rush is 365 days a year and pledging
can occur at any time. Selectivety is at a new peak. No
longer are members looking to see if the Rushee’s father or
mother was a Greek and at his outward appear-
ance. Instead, the Rushee is being examined to see what

kind of person he really is. This delving into the person

himself has changed the whole appearance of the groups,
especially in sororities: No longer are sorority girls dressing
alike immaculately, but are seen like everyone else — bag-

gy shirts and blue—jean—bells.

In order to increase membership, the IFC brought Opera-
tion Greek, a national clinic on rushing, onto campus in
February. The main point brought out by the program is
that no longer are these groups thriving on the point that
“We do everything together or we don’t do it.” Instead,
everyone has a role in the organization, whether he is work-

er or whether he just supports the group financially.

Perhaps one of the biggest changes that has occured in the
past few years is in the role of the national organization. In
the past, Greeks have been hampered by the stigma of
strong nationals which controlled virtually every aspect of
the organizations existence. These nationals have, howev-
er, seen the need for change. Whereas, in the past they ex-
isted as supervisory bodies, they are now advisory bodies
which exist to provide services which are impossible to

obtain on the local level. They seem to be placing the pow-

er of self—government'*  that chapter,-

into the hands of the

Tradition, however, ;
ful traditional event aek Week. In
some instances this ‘ the changing
Greek. Most people 0 tivities of the
bobby—socked, beer- _‘ Ereeks. They
don’t look behind this and see how Greek Week has
evolved into a Service Event. Each year, during Greek
Week, money is raised for several charities through fund-
raising events. In addition these fundraising projects
break up the rivalry between the groups and every one has

a good time as one massive body — The Greeks.

The times and the people of the era denote exactly what
the Greek system will become. It is up to the individual to
decide whether the Greek system will become a whipping-
boy for the independent or a source of personal fulfillment
for the Greek. It is not a question of being social leaders or
social loads; rather, it is a question of whether you appre-

ciate sharing the college experiences of others. 327

For the past six years, Mrs. Marcia
Haley has been the Advisor to the
Sororities at Pitt. This fall she will re-
sign from this post to spend more
time with her family. The following is
an excerpt from an interview conduct-
ed with Mrs. Haley on her experiences
over the past years at Pitt.

OWL: What changes have you seen in
the mechanics of the sororities and the
attitudes of these young women?

HALEY: Probably the biggest change
I have seen in Sororities is in the inter-
est and the direction of the groups.
They have become much more service
oriented. There appears to be much
more interest in doing a service project
because the group wants to do it, not
because their nationals tell them to do
it. I consider this a change in this
whole generation — they're much
more voluntary service oriented. The
groups have developed along these
lines, because if people as individuals
change and their interests are chang-
ing, the groups must change too.

A superficial change, which is proba-
bly the most glaring, is the whole
mode of dress. Sorority girls were
always immaculate and perfectly at-
tired; now they look like everybody
else — tee shirts and jeans. To me this
indicates that there is probably more
depth in the selectivity. They are
looking beyond the surface to who
people really are. I think there is a
change too in some of the types of ac-
tivities in which the groups become
involved. They are still social and I’ve
never thought that there is any reason
at all to apologize for being social. I
think people are social animals and
they need a social outlet. Sororities
went through a stage, especially about
3 years ago with the campus revolt,
when they were apologetic for being
social. Now they have come to realize
that this is a meaningful purpose.

OWL: With women's Liberation
Movements so strong, how does this
affect Sororities?

HALEY: Some members of the Wom-
en's Liberation Movement have ster-
eotyped sororities — you dress this
way and act this way. It's not that
way at all. On the contrary, sororities
are one of the few groups that provide
an outlet for women to respect and
relate to each other as individuals.
Most groups have rhen in them and
men take the leadership roles. Here a
woman has a chance to lead a group.
That's why I cringe a little when they
talk about merging fraternities and
sororities. I think that fraternities and
sororities are different, and I'm glad
that they are. I feel that each group
has something to offer an individual
and if the group were coed, the whole
relationship among the members
would change.

OWL: What do you forsee in the fu-
ture for the Greeks?

I-IALEY: I don’t forsee death of the
Greek system. If sororities didn't
change, they could die, but fortunate-
ly they are adapting. Basically a group
has to be what its membership is and
usually when the interests of the
members change direction — the
group changes. I firmly believe that
the groups are basically a friendship
core, and there is always a need for
friendship, especially in a large uni-
versity like this one. These groups are
merely a facilitator of friendship —
they help you make friends and be-
come closer to people.

Mr. Louis McLinden has been Fra-
ternity Advisor at Pitt for the past 5
years. He will resign this fall to take
another job with the University. The
following is an excerpt of an interview

with Mr. McLinden concerning Fra— —

ternities on Pitt’s campus.

 

OWL: Do you think there has been
any change in fraternities in your past
five years here?

McLinden: Yes, Many liberal atti-
tudes have been taken across the
United States, it's not only been hap-
pening here. It’s been a wide based
movement giving the students more
control over their affairs. This I feel
has been good in most instances.

OWL: Do you feel that fraternities are
dying?

McLinden: They won't die. If they do
die, it will be the membership that

. kills them — when there is no longer a

need for fraternity. I don't think we
will ever reach that time when there is
no longer a need for a social, growing,
maturity group from adolescence to
adulthood. This is what I feel a fra-
ternity is somewhat about —— that last
step into adulthood.

OWL: What do you think has been a
problem with the fraternity system at
Pitt?

McLinden: One of the things we do
need on this campus is adequate and
more safe housing for fraternities.
This is one of the sad parts we were
not able to accomplish in my last five
years. I think the Chancellor recogniz-
es the need to identify with a unit —
and this is what a fraternity is. He
sees on this campus that they do pro-
vide this identity. I think its just a
matter of the times why we didn't get
housing. I think housing will remain
an issue until we can get better and
more adequate housing. There are
many stumbling blocks with an urban
university in a residential area with
zoning and tax laws. The fraternity
system on this campus were the first
and only ones to give housing at this
University in the early teens. Dormi-

 

tories did not come into existence un-
til 1948. Up to this time, fraternities
were the only available housing on
campus.

OWL: Fraternities are supposedly
unifying bodies of brotherhood, but
why do so many Juniors and Seniors
go inactive?

McLinden: Fraternities have served
their purpose for that individual and
he no longer sees the fraternity as
being any use to him. This sometimes
goes with maturity. I think this can be
helped with some better programming
to keep the interest of that Junior or
Senior. The fraternities should not
remain a Freshman/Sophomore enti-
ty, but should try to enlarge its scope
even into the graduate student area. It
is a social animal. At the age of 17, 18,
or 19 there is a need for many stu-
dents to identify with a group and the
fraternity should be able to satisfy
that need.

OWL: What do you think is the future
of fraternity?

McLinden: It's what the fraternities
want to make of it. There is no one
more powerful than student groups.
Colleges were founded by student
groups banning together and hiring a
professor. Still the student groups are
most powerful. The colleges cannot
exist without students.

OWL: Please comment on your past 5
years experiences.

McLinden: This has been the most
enjoyable 5 years of my life span so
far — working with the young men of
these fraternities. They have been a
great influence on me, even changing
my thoughts. I have become more lib-
eral by working with them.

The Panhellenic Council is composed of Presidents and
one elected member from each sorority. The members of
Panhel coordinate rules and party schedules for rush so
that it may be beneficial to both the rushees and sorori-
ties. These activities include Panhellenic Paraphenlia and
Preview as an introduction for the propective rushee to
sorority life. In addition, Panhel sponsors activities such
as volleyball and basketball to promote sororal spirit.

The Panhellenic Council strives to achieve a good relation-
ship between the university and the Greek system. Its
purpose is to foster an atmosphere which involves scholar-
ship, culture, and friendship for the Greeks here at Pitt.

  

330

Pitt’s fraternities are represented nationally by the Na-
tional Interfraternity Council (NIC). This organization
directs Greek activities throughout the United States and
Canada. Pitt’s IFC is the central governing force for cam-
pus fraternities. Acting as a coordinating body, the IFC is
composed of the Presidents and Vice Presidents of each
fraternal organization in the Greek system. In addition,
the IFC sponsors a full school year of interfraternity ath-
letic events to provide competition among the fraternities
and to promote fraternity spirit in the individual group.

WORLD OF DISNEY

GREEK WEEK
1972

The Greek System at Pitt is composed of many indi-
vidual groups. Greek Week is an effort to bring each
of these groups into one large melting pot. In short,
getting together. Through the “Wonderful World of
Disney,” we were able to relive fond memories of our
past. It is through these memories that the Greeks
have traditionally set aside a week to express
themselves.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

Greek Week is a week of fun, rowdiness, hard work,
charity, and jubilation. Beginning with Chariot
Races at noon on Bigelow Boulevard, the spirit of
unity and fun reign throughout the week. But the
Greeks do not neglect the less fortunate. This year
Greek Week was a time to raise money for children
who have never had a chance to live a normal,
healthy life. Through donations to Children’s Hospi-
tal, Muscular Dystrophy, and the American Cancer
Society, Pitt Greeks hope to share their zeal and ex-
citement for life with those who are less fortunate.

mixer for almost 2,000 people
and 2. Where was there a
place where beer could be
served with the permission of
the owner? THE SOLU-
TION: The basement of Syr-
ia Mosque.

So in rolled keg after keg of
beer, followed by yard after
yard of crepe paper, followed
by loud music and a whole
myriad of Greeks represent-
ing fraternities and sorori-
ties of Pitt’s campus. The
reason: to get together and
have fun as one unified
group: THE GREEKS. The
mixer proved to be a huge
success, which for the first
time gave an opportunity for
all Greeks to meet in a free,
open space in a feeling of uni-
ty and friendship.

What does a blood drive, a dinner, and a tal-
ent contest have in common? Usually, not
too much, but during Greek Week, they seem
very similar — They are all ways of working
and having fun together.

This year, the blood drive was extended to
two days to collect blood for the distribution
to various area hospitals. The Greeks have
built up a bank of blood which will insure a
supply of blood in case of need by anyone at
the University.

The Thursday night dinner was a way of rais-
ing money for one of the Greek Week chari-
ties, Children’s Hospital. This years’ Greek
Spaghetti Dinner was donated by Szabo
Foods, and raised much needed funds for the
hospital.

Talent Night is time of competition when
each fraternity-sorority team puts up an en-
tertaining act into competition. This year’s
contest was more interesting with members
of both sexes competing in everything from
song and dance to comedy. The judges chose
Mark Sigmund and Norma Vitar, the FIJI-
Alpha Delta Pi Representatives as the
winner.

The variety of activities presented during
this years Greek Week made us think the
theme of “The Wonderful World of Fantasy
should have been, “The Wonderful World of
Greeks!”

Alpha Delta Pi

White and

Blue and
Friendship true.

What is Alpha Delta Pi? It is friendship, companionship
and activity. It is a group effort while still being an indi-
vidual experience. This past year the sisters
of .-\AH have demonstrated all this by participating in
many activities. The sisters showed their friendship and a
willingness to help others by working with underprivileged
children . . . and having as its annual service project, work-
ing with kids at Juvenile Court.

During Greek Week, the “ .r\All Bunny” hopped around
the campus collecting for Childrens Hospital.

The sisters also believe in having fun. In December, a for—
mal dinner dance was held at the Holiday House and the
sisters and their dates were entertained by The Letter-
men. Less formal formal was the Halloween Party and the
50’s party held in the suite at Amos Hall. The sisters also
had a fun time on their hayride, singing and laughing
around the campfire.

Alpha Delta Pi’s individuality was also demonstrated. A D
Pi’s hold offices in Panhel, are active in AWS, Rush Coun-
selor Program and Heinz Chapel Choir, just to name a few.

Because “We Live For Each Other”, the sisters of Alpha
Delta Pi believe in getting involved

. Alpha Epsilon Phi

Because people working

FOR other people is

What friendship and sis-
terhood . . . andlife israll
about.

 

Alpha Epsilon Phi, founded at Barnard College, October
24, 1909, was the first Greek—letter sorority for Jewish
women in this country. The local group was installed as
Nu chapter of Alpha Epsilon Phi at the University on May
5, 1920.

The present day chapter, while living in an enjoyable life-
style of fun and sisterhood, sees the needs in the Universi-
ty and surrounding neighborhood and tries to remedy the
situation by activities such as Community Service
Projects which help others and provide an outlet of enjoy-
able work for the sisters.

The 1971-72 school year saw our fraternity active in a
number of areas. With less than thirty brothers, we were
able to field teams in several intramural sports and were
well represented at all Greek Week activities. We placed
second in the “Games People Play” competition.

In addition, we had many enjoyable social affairs including
bowling, a Las Vegas Casino party, mixers, ice skating,
and a hayride.

We have continued to make improvements in our house
such as new carpeting and penelling. In April, we held our

annual Senior-Awards banquet at the Holiday House.

The future seems bright for our house as We have united
brotherhood and a core of energetic, hard—working men.

Chi Omega

A symphony of high
purpose and helpfulness

in which there is no dis-
cordant note.

 

In a year when the country is aroused with political fer-
vour, Chi Omega capitalizes on this spirit is reﬂecting the
American heritage.

When this country was young, its growth depended on
community action, neighbor helping neighbor. Carrying
this ideal into the impersonal times of today’s world. Chi
Omega went to the Maclntyre Home to give a Halloween
party for the children there. Complete with spice cookies
and Jack O’Lanterns, games were played and costumes
made. Providing a Thanksgiving basket for a needy family
and money for clothing for a young parolee were some of
our other social-civic projects. Caroling through the halls
of Forbes Nursing Home was a fun way of bringing joy to
someone alone . . .

As diverse as the American “Melting Pot,” so is Chi Ome-
ga in its composition as well as its activities. The individu-
ality of each sister is expressed by the varied campus or-
ganizations in which she is involved: some writing, some
governing, some counseling, and others exhibiting their
athletic prowess. As a whole, the sorority supported Par-
ent’s Weekend and Homecoming in an effort to foster bet-
ter Greek relations, Chi Omega invited each fraternity and
sorority to the suite for an after meeting get together.

Cloholding this country’s vigor for healthy competition,
Omega has been active in every women’s intramural
‘luring Greek Week the sisters spent many an after-

"ting for charity which netted them the 1st char-

Why. They worked diligently with Delta Sigma

‘oward the successful end of 2nd place in

‘hieving the first place trophy for overall

eek Week.

...v of the endeavors of Chi Omega. There
are many worth noting, but these are only fully understood
by those who work so hard and are so loyal to the ideals
which make Chi Omega meaningfully to them. One may
attempt to describe these feelings toward Chi Omega as
being analygous to that certain something which makes
each citizen proud to be part of the American heritage!

Delta Phi Epsilon — a sorority composed of many unique
ideas and goals, yet with one common goal — working to-
gether for the benefit of the whole. In attempting to fullfill
the needs and wants of the sisters, D Phi E becomes in-
volved — working, giving, sharing — through activities in
and out of school. Remember the first place chariot for
Greek Week‘? the Dinner—Dance to honor the new sisters?
our UNICEF Drive and how about selling cookies for Cys-
tic Fibrosis in the freezing rain?! And along with the Work,
there’s the fun — the crazy stunts that only happen here.
A conglomeration of experiences, some good some bad, but
all priceless.

Delta Zeta

  

Delta Zeta —

We’re on a

  
 
 

Carousel

  

I meet you in the Union

or in the library

or perhaps the Towers Lobby
and I like the way you laugh
or think or dream,

and maybe sometimes

you will hear,

or I will tell you,

that I am a Delta Zeta.

And its’ possible that you

may ask me what we do

so I will talk about girls who

write articles for the Pitt News,

tutor for the Y,

those who are Mentors

and those who are Panhellenic executives.

And I recall the excitement of rush —
meeting under “The Clock”,

smiling at a ruch skit,

anxiously greeting new sisters.

And I speak of searching out a dress
or a date

for our Christmas Dance

or Spring Formal.

And there’s the fervor of Greek Week
frantically stuffing last minute

tissue paper into a chicken—wire chariot,
restless stomachs before releasing

that first note in Greek Sing,

cheering at the announcement of

a Delta Zeta victory

and feeling proud.

I tell you about marothon pinochole
tournaments in the suite,

and fiery discussions on

politics

movies

wallpaper colors for the living room.

Or quiet moments alone.

And then perhaps
After a while

you will ask me,
“What is Delta Zeta?”

Delta Sigma Chi

Delta is ready when you
are.

 

As the only local fraternity at Pitt, Delta Sigma Chi
proved to be the fastest growing fraternity on campus, dur-
ing the past school year. The 48 active brothers reﬂect a
wide diversification of ideas, backgrounds, and attitudes.

Athletically, DSC participated fully in fraternity intra-
mural sports, taking fourth place overall out of seventeen
fraternities.

The highlight of our year was working with the Sisters of ' " "M-or
Chi Omega for Greek Week. Through determination and

hard work both groups took first place in overall competi-

tion. Our most satisfying accomplishment during Greek

Week was an all-out effort by the brothers, collecting *
$3,000.00 for charity; the largest amount ever collected by

a Pitt Fraternity.

As a social fraternity we presented a diversified social cal-
endar throughout the year. Winter term was highlighted
by our Sweetheart Ball and Friday afternoon “Goodtime
Hours” with the Fiji’s and Sigma Chi’s.

The underlying key to our success this year has been our
continual strive to create a feeling of true brotherhood

within our fraternity.

Throughout the year DSC has worked to maintain respect
and a good rapport with fellow Greeks at Pitt.

Next year the Delta Sigma Chi’s anticipate continued
growth and success.

Delta Tau Delta

It’s a nice place to live

but Iwouldn’t want to

visit here.

The basic idea of our Fraternity is to furnish wholesome companionship for con-
genial men of serious purpose under conditions which will further best the objec-
tives of the college; and, therefore, to create in our house an atmosphere of intel-
lectual alertness and of moral healthfulness which will promote in our members
a Virile character and more consistent development than they would be likely to
obtain singly, without the stimulating support and motivation of the group.

Delta Tau Delta has been a pioneer among fraternities in demanding from its
members adequate scholastic performance. We believe that the first obligation
of a college student is to his institution and to the job he has undertaken by
coming to college. The obligation he owes to his family and to his own
self-respect.

It has been said that real education consists of the impact of youthful mind
upon youthful mind. No matter how thorough the training furnished by the col-
lege, real mastery of an idea comes only with the free exchange and discussion
with congenial associates held together by imtimate bonds, spurred on by com-
mon purpose. And this comes much more easily in a good fraternity group than
in the casual contacts of campus or dormitory life.

Moreover, the real objective of a college education is preparation for a signifi-
cant role among our fellow men. The work of a college is restricted largely to
mental training; making the student—social minded is left to other agencies. In
this task no other educational agency has rivaled in effectiveness the college fra-
ternity, emphasizing, as it does, the central thought that no personal achieve-
ment has permanent merit which does not at the same time benefit the group as
a whole.

As a young member of Delta Tau Delta you will receive the help and encourage-
ment of the older members in the chapter. In the latter years at college you will
in turn share in the guidance of the underclassmen, and there develop a sense of
responsibility for his fellows. And after you leave college you will find over 62,000
members scattered over the world, carrying on the spirit of fraternal fellowship
which was fostered during the undergraduate days.

“One man is

“Phi Delta Theta"
"What’s That?”

Being relatively unknown on campus at the
beginning of this year, the Phi Delts had no
where to go but up. This past September saw
the reinstallation of this large national fra-
ternity on Pitt’s campus. Phi Delta Theta
has a long tradition at Pitt (from 1918 to
1962) and many alumni and university offi-
cials were glad to see us back and living once
more.

Many things had changed, though. There are
few people around who remember what Phi
Delta Theta was. It was the job of the new
active chapter to become known. This they
did very well. First there was initiation and
installation ceremonies in mid—September
which attracted many spectators. Next a
large pledge class for two consecutive terms
increased the popularity of the group. Partic-
ipation in sports was the hardest — losing
miserably in most of the early sport events
but them coming back later in the year to
place fourth in IFC Wrestling. In addition,
many Phi Delts held important positions in
campus activities: Paul Salva, Editor of the
1972 OWL; Scott Spadafore, MDC Presi-
dent; Chuck Steeber, IFC Treasurer; plus
many more who served on committees and
activities. In Greek Week competition the
Phi Delts along with TPA placed first in Col-
lege Bowl. This all helped to make the past
school year truly the “Year of the PHI.”

Pi Lam started the year with a successful Rush which
brought the Chapter an extremely diversified and active
pledge class. The Pi Lam softball team paved the way
towards a successful term by reaching the championship
playoff. With a start like this Pi Lam couldn’t help but fin-
ish strong! An indescribable Winter Weekend highlighted
an exciting social calendar. This year Pi Lam made a
strong bid for first place in Greek Week, riding on the crest
of their highly acclaimed Greek sing performance. When
the Softball Team won the Spring League Championship,
it topped off a rewarding year.

Pi Lam’s membership roster includes the President of In-
ter Fraternity Council, the Chief Justice of Inter Fraterni-
ty Council, several Inter Fraternity Council committee
chairmen and members of Druids and OAK representing
our university, Pi Lam includes active members of the
Pitt Golf Team, Pitt Cheerleaders, and the William Pitt
Debate Union. A proud heritage, a bright future and the

The lions roared on:

Building another year of
brotherhood and beer.

 

The 1971-72 school year proved to be a satisfying experi-
ence for the brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Through
r-ush twenty new members were added to the rolls bringing
the membership to over fifty. Of these fifty members near-
ly everyone was involved in some sort of extra curricular
activity. The varsity football, track and riﬂe teams, stu-
dent government, mentors, IFC Judicial, Allocations
Committee, Pitt Men’s Glee Club were some of the organi-
zations to receive the diversity which SAE cultivates.

In_ keeping with a tradition of service the SAE’s were also
involved in a number of worthwhile projects. Some of these
wer‘e;,working as volunteers in Children’s Hospital, col-
lecting for UNICEF with the sisters of Delta Phi Epsilon
Sorority, aiding WQED in conducting a telephone survey
and during Greek Week, in conjunction with Alpha Epsi-
lon Phi sorority, rafﬂing a trip to Disneyworld, Florida
with proceeds going to Children’s Hospital.

With a greater emphasis put on athletics the SAE’s came
up with winning records in several IFC intramural sports.

On the social side, there were sorority and open mixers,
bowling, ice skating, theme parties as well as the standard
Saturday night beer and band affairs.

Academically our scholastic average was well above the
campus all meri’s average and two of our brothers were
tapped to Phi Beta Kappa.

Most importantly, however, this year new friendships were
made and old ones grew stronger at Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

An inexperienced defensive back-
field, a relatively young team, a
tough schedule and an overanxious
coaching staff spelled misfortune to
the tune of a 3-8 record for the 1971
edition of the Pitt Panther football
team.

After an impressive opening victory
over the UCIA Bruins, the Panthers
seemed to be roaring, indeed. Unfor-
tunately, as time was to prove, the
victorious 29-25 score over the Bruins
only served to raise false hopes in the
hungry Pitt fan. As Oklahoma was to
prove two weeks later, the Panthers
were on the threshold of a very trying

406

season. Offensively, the Panthers
were a reasonably able team. They
scored an average of 25 points a game

‘and controlled the ball well enough

for a successful defense to insure vic-
tory. But, the defense was a very
loose and a very young squad, unable
to cope with the powerhouses that
graced the schedule.

Reggie Frye, who won a job as a wal-

kon a year earlier was now a defen-_,

sive mainstay, in the rather pourous
backfield. Joe Hendron, DayeiAd-
ams, Lou Cecconi Jr., and,D'an Rullo
were the main arteries, of that young
backfield, which caused the Pitt fans
hearts beat a little faster everytime
the football was put in the air by the
opposition.

Not only were the defensive backs
young, but the Pitt squad as a whole
was young. There were over 30 grid-
ders that were either sophomores or
juniors. And, most of the youngsters
were on the defensive unit, which
makes the 35 points a game they al-
lowed a little easier to understand.

The schedule served as no soluce for
these already trying circumstances.
Along with UCLA, Oklahoma, Notre
Dame, Penn State, and Florida State
all ranked in the top twenty football
teams in the country some time dur-
ing the season.

After the Oklahoma game, the coach-
ing staff made a mild tactical error in
evaluating the Pitt situation. Being
bombed by Oklahoma 55-29, the
coaches made changes in the defen-
sive alignment. They first changed to
a 5-2-4 defense as well as changing
the offensive formation. The players,
shaken by their performance against
the Sooners, found it hard to accept
the changes and never did fully ad-
just. Time proved that Oklahoma
was to beat everybody they played by
astronomical scores.

If nothing else, the young players
salvaged game experience by the
otherwise disasterous year. And, the
old slogan — Wait Til Next Year —
is applicable here.

Even though the Pitt Soccer team
seems to get the shaft from the
NCAA tournament selection com-
mittee on a yearly basis, the 1971-72
season saw the booters come close
again to going to the prestigeous
tournament. So close they came in
fact, that they were not out of the
running until the final game.

Beating Bucknell, and West Chester,
two Eastern powerhouses, Leo Be-
mis’ team was one of the best squads
ever to put on Pitt soccer uniforms.
With the likes of Gus Theofolis, John
White, and Joe Luxbacker the boot-
ers finally hoped to end the NCAA
jinx.

After tieing Akron, the Soccermen
were still hoping that the tourney
was in their grasp. Finally, whether
the team made it to the tournament
or not came down to the final two
games on the schedule, West Virgin-
ia and Penn State.

West Virginia had gone out of their

way to insure a spot on the NCAA
list by recruiting six soccer stars
from a very powerful jr. college pow-
erhouse. The result was an extremely
stingy Mountaneer defense, which
proved to be very stingy against Pitt.
The Mounties defeated the Pitts by a
meager 1-0 score.

In the Penn State game, Bemis’
troops jumped out to a 1-0 first peri-
od score. Near the end of the second
period, with the score tied 1-1, the
turning point of the game went
against Pitt. The Penn Staters
scored a questionable goal to forge
ahead as the period ended.

The Pitt Booters were never able to
recover. Pressing to tie the score, Pitt
fought against a suddenly defensive
minded squad.

They gambled and they lost. Penn
State took advantage of the pressing
situation, forced in three more goals
and demoralized Bemis’ team.

“We didn’t have any great stars, . . . when We put it
all together we did have a pretty solid team effort.”

If there is such a thing as an unap-
pealing sport, Cross Country would
have to be the one.

Jim Banner, who is the Track and
Cross Country coach, has the du-
bious honor of tutoring a sport even
the participants don’t like.

“You have to be missing some of your
marbles to be in this sport,” a Thin-
clad once said, on the way to another
six-mile run.

Why, then, does an athlete, who runs
in a sport where the fan has to run
along to catch any action, who runs
in a sport best viewed from a helicop-
ter do it‘? For the conditioning.

Fast runners have less of a chance
winning a Cross Country race. The

athlete who has the highest degree of
desire to get in shape has the best
chance. Ironic then is the fact that,
Pitt, a school not known for its win-
ning teams in the last decade, has a
very good Cross Country program —
in a sport that has the following of a
skunk at a picnic area.

Cross Country requires a large area
for the competititon to occur. Beau-
tiful Schenley Park offers that, but
leaves the spectator on the other side
of the woods. A fan sees only two
minutes of a race — one at the start
and one at the finish.

Athletes who care about large crowds
don’t go for Cross Country. In that
phenonemena lies the value of the
sport.

“Good season, a Very
young team; toward
the end of the season
We were hit with alot
of injuries and illness.
But I was Very pleased.”

Coach Jim Banner

Of the twelve Pitt Varsity athletic
teams, none copped any kind of
league championship or division ti-
tle. In fact, the only title a Pitt team
was credited for winning was due to
the Pitt Hockey Club.

The club, which made an unsuccess-
ful attempt to attain varsity status,
emerged as champion of the newly
formed Western Pennsylvania Inter-
collegiate Club Hockey Association.
The Pitt Icers dominated play in ev-
ery catagory, in that division, on the
way to its 9-0-1 record.

Coached by Phil Gefsky and being
forced to play in obscurity, the ska-
ters led the seven team WPICHA
league in goals (81), assists (81),
points (162), and, in the undesirable

department, penalty minutes (225).

In the league leaders department,
the Pitt skaters were also well repre-
sented. Frank Williams was the
fourth high goal scorer in the league
with 12 goals. Joe Testa (2nd), Frank
Williams (5th), and Denny Browne
(5th place tie) were all included in
the top five assist leaders.

Frank Williams (3rd) with 21 points,
Denny Brown (5th) with 19 points,
Bill Glanville (6th) with 17 points
were all found in the top twelve
league scoring leaders.

For a team that is struggling for sur-
vival in a non—hockey school, the
championship and the league play
was gratifying, to say the least.

The usually relaxed head coach of
the Pitt Basketball Team, Buzz Ridl,
made a very exciting prediction at
the outset of the 1970-71 basketball
year. Ridl shed what was called his
‘catious cloak’ and predicted that the
hoopsters would be headed to a tour-
nament (NCAA or NIT) at season’s
end.

With Kent Scott, the team’s leading
scorer, Cleveland Edwards, a classy
guard, Mike Paul, a consistent ball
handler and scorer, and Mickey Mare
tin, a freshman hotshot, all return-
ing, the hungry Panther basketball
fans had hopes of a very appetizing
campaign.

And when you also considered the
addition of Bill Knight, an honorable
mention All—American selection by
Striet and Smith’s Magazine, Ridl’s

Frank Webster, Head Coach Charles ‘Buzz’ Ridl, Bill Sulkowski, Chris
Jones, Jim Bolla and Manager Newell Embley.

prediction seemed more logical than
brash.

Two things happened, however, that
Ridl and the fans did not foresee.
First off, Scott didn’t get untracked
and didn’t regain his old form until
about halfway into the season. Then,
the big man (6-10 and above), some-
thing that Ridl didn’t have, came
back to bury all tourney hopes.

In at least four games (North Caroli-
na, South Carolina, North Carolina
State, and West Virginia) the lack of
a Pitt giant resulted in defeat. A win
in those four games, which were all
decided late in the game, would have
given the Panthers a 16-8 mark. Con-
sidering the explosive schedule, the
selection committees would have
been hard pressed not to invite Pitt.

Wrestling coach Dave Adams proba-
bly hopes the word injury had never
been defined. Injuries played as
much a role in the 1971 wrestling sea-
son as did the toughest Pitt oppo-
nent. As Adams put it, “we’ve had
enough injuries this year to last us
the next ten years.”

After opening the season on a sour
note against a tough Michigan wres-
tling squad, the Panthers looked as
though they were going to be Vere
respectable, losing to the Wolverines
by only six points, 23-17. After losing
to another powerhouse, Maryland,
20-16, the grapplers seemed headed
for a fair season and a good tourna-
ment team. Then the injuries took
over. With key men hurt, the Panth-

Row; Coach Adams, Wally Morrell, John Buzzatto, Rick Neal, Craig
Tritch, Karl Roba, Lamar Hudson, George Calcagnini, Willie Saloky,

ers suffered their most embarressing
defeat of the year, at the hands of the
Naval Academy. Navy swarmed
Adams’ crew by a lopsided 33-5
score.

The schedule, of course, for the open-
ing three meets was extremely tough.
Just to have three teams of that cali-
ber on the card is saying something,
but to have them in a row at the be-
ginning of the season is saying some-
thing else. After Navy, the going got
a little bit easier. And while no Pitt
men placed in the NCAA finals, Pitt
finished fifth in the Easterns with 59
points.Kevin Love copped the 150
title and John Chatman was second
at 158.

As always seems to be the case for
Pitt Track, the 1971-72 squad came
very close to being the best team in
the East and had a small collection
of Track superstars. This year, again,
was no exception.

In the big meet, the IC4A’s, the
Tracksters scored 25 points (same as
last year) and finished third best in
the East. The pointage is deceiving
in that the Bannermen could have
done better and possibly won the
meet. Because some points failed to
materialize, however, third place was
the best performance ever in the out-
door season.

Individually, the Panthers had their
share of stars. Bill Rea, who eventu-
ally missed going to the Olympics by

a mere two inches, highlighted the
Track season at his coach’s own crea-
tion, the Pitt Invitational. Rea
leaped an astronomical 26’71/2” in
the long jump, which not only quali-
fied him for the Trials, but was also
the best long jump in Pitt History as
well as the best jump in the country
at that time. Even though it was dis-
sapointing to Rea not to make the
Olympic team, the fact that a Pitt
sophomore came that close to going
to Munich was in itself gratifying.

Three other great individual stars on
the team were Dorel Watley, Mike
Schurko, and Rick Carosielli. Scurko
was an astute performer in the stee-
plechase, Watley specialized in the
mile relay and Carosielli in the 120
yard high hurdles.

The Pitt Panther baseball team
opened up the season as it they were
going to breeze through their sched-
ule with the greatest of ease. The
Panthers won their first six games
and seemed headed for an NCAA
tournament, which had eluded them
in past years.

But, typical inclement weather and a
a mild batting slump put an end to
those hopes. Though the mitters
were scheduled to play 26 games, the
erratic spring weather cancelled ten
of them.

With Mike Niccols and the Fedoris
brothers returning on the pitching
staff, and with Ken Macha and Guy
Capparelli back to swing the big

bats, the diomendmen’s bid seemed
to be legitamate.

The demise of the team began
against archrival and enemy West
Virginia. The mountaineerrs took
advantage of Pitt’s lack of clutch hit-
ting and gave the Panthers the first
loss of their season, 4-1. In the second
game of that doubleheader, the
Mounties really put the damper on
Bobby Lewis’ squad by handing
them a 3-1 loss.

From then on, the mitters never
seemed to really recover. Their rec-
ord from then on was a listless 3-5,
which gave them a 9-7 season mark,
dissappointing to say the least.

See page 602 for complete statistics.

have given us a real

Every coach of an athletic team
dreams of the type of year the Pitt
Tennis team had last year, coach
Fran Webster readily admits. Webs-
ter contends that if any observer
would have asked him who was going
to win in the middle of all his team’s
winning matches he would have been
at a loss of words to supply an an-
swer. Yet, his team won all 11 of
those matches to provide the team
with the best record of its existance.

The two matches the team lost were
easy to take as they were shutout 9-0
in both. But those 11 victories found
the team pulling it out in either the
last game, set or match. Webster
made a good recruiting effort the year

before and it paid off. Torn Currant,
George Diffenbauch and Joe Kantor,
all freshmen, teamed up with veteran
Gary Schwartz to pull of the
miracles.

The most dramatic of the wins came
in the match against Carnegie Mel-
lon University. Kantor and Currant
teamed up in the last doubles match
to defeat the Kahn brothers, who had

only lost three matches in their ca-<

reer at CMU. Of course the raque-
teers needed a victory in that doubles
match to rescue them from defeat,
and they got it. Basically, the same
script was repeated in the rest of the
matches.

“The strangest thing

about our season was that We
were a young team and Won
many of our matches under
pressure. With three freshmen
and two sophomores we Won all

  
   

our close matches. If youwould
  have asked me midway in some
of our matches who was going
to Win, I couldn’t have told you.
,» But, we won them all. We could

9 have easily been 7-6 instead of
11-2.”

Coach Fran Webster

“With four state champs
on the team, it was
ridiculous that the Athletic
Department wouldn’t
allow us to go to the

Eastern Championship.”

The only thing men’s and women’s
gymnastics have in common is the
name. As women’s coach Gail DiCico
says, “women have less physical
strength than men”, so it only fol-
lows that the feline event is different
than that of the male.

In women’s gymnastics, there are
only four events: 1) uneven parallel
bars. 2) balance beam 3) vaulting 4)
floor exercise. In the women’s event,
a more balletish atmosphere is trans-
mitted. The girls can be more theatr-
ical by twisitng themselves around
and about the unever bars. The bal-
ance beam, which the girls do every-
thing but stand on their heads on,

doesn’t exist in the men’s depart-
ment. In the vaulting, the men vault
the length of the obstacle, while the
women jump sideways. The only dif-
ference in the floor exercise is that
the girls are more musically
acclimated.

These things considered, if an ala
Margo Fontaine effect is desired,
women’s gymnastics is the providor.
If a muscle display is the need, the
men are the suppliers.

At Pitt, these differences have exist-
ed for five years and DiCicco sees no
end to an improving women’s gym-
nastics team.

Offering only an opportunity to im-
prove tennis play, and a couple of
trips to its players, the Women’s
Tennis team made four important
changes before its 1972 season.

The team, under the well guided
leadership of Dr. Goldie Edwards,
changed its season from fall to a
spring schedule, because of incle-
ment fall weather, got enough money
in the budget to but enough balls and
got needed inside court time, added a

few more trips for the players, and,
most important, scheduled better
competition.

The women followed a successful ’71
season with a losing ’72 campaign.
They won only one of their matches
—— against Chatam College. Dr.
Edwards wasn’t upset by her team’s
performance, because she thinks the
team will benefit by playing against
better competition, in the long run.

“Last year We had a winning season

6-0 , but we had no competition. In the
fall we changed to a tougher schedule for
tougher competition. We obviously

found it because we got beaten.”
Coach Goldie Edwards

This new freedom is presenting new challenges to all students . . .

With the encouraging words of Mari-
na Whitman, a Pitt economics pro-
fessor and appointee to President
Nixon’s Economic Council, ringing in
their ears the Class of 1972 left the
Civic arena ready to embark on what
commencement speakers have tradi-
tionally termed “the sea of life.” But
many discovered a rocky road in-
stead of a tranquil sea, for the class
of ’72 had the misfortune of graduat-
ing during a time of economic as well
as international and domestic crises.

The summer of ’72 found many stu-
dent idealists who had opposed the
war, racial and sexist descrimina—
tion, and tradition bargaining with
the devil in hopes of landing jobs
with corporations such as U. S. Steel,
J & L, Du Pont, and Mellon Bank,
But such jobs were few and far be-
tween. The University’s Employ-
ment office reported one of the worst
recruiting seasons in many years; as
hordes of frustrated graduates pa-
tiently waited in line for the few
available job interviews.

Many English majors found them-
selves working as secretaries, sociolo-
gy students as nurses’ aids and or-
derlies, biology majors as lab techni-
cians, engineering students as con-
struction workers, history majors as
bus drivers, and economics students
as bank tellers. Others could find no
work at all or were “over qualified.”
Many chose to continue their educa-
tion in graduate and professional
schools, delaying the time of their
personal employment crises. Many
women liberationists found marriage
a reasonable and satisfactory solu-
tion to their problems. Suddenly the
idealistic pursuit of a liberal educa-
tion, replete with credit/no entry op-
tions and self—designed majors, did
not seem to be such a good idea after
all.

Many of Pitt’s 1972 graduates were
already familiar with the problems of
the employment scene. Most of them
came from middle class backgrounds
and had been forced to work their
way through college with summer
and part time jobs. Despite charges
by conservatives that college stu-
dents were living in a sterile and

500

idealistic world, the majority of Pitt
students were faced with the harsh
realities of every day life.

A great majority of the 1972 class
commuted from home during their
college career so they were often
dominated by their parents and fam-
ilies, despite attempts to break the
umbilicus. In many cases the politi-
cal and moral attitudes of the ’72
graduates were influenced more by
their home environments than by
their experiences at the University.

So if the Class of 1972 was a little less
idealistic than some of their peers at
other colleges and universities, who
can blame them? While students at
other colleges protested the Viet
Nam War, the draft, ROTC on cam-
pus, the trail of Angela Davis, the
treatment of prisoners at Attica, and
the persecution of Soviet Jewry, the

majority of Pitt students were con-
cerned about getting decent grades

and making enough money to meet 7

the ever rising cost of tuition.

This is not to say that there was no
student activism on campus. During
the four year stay of the 1972 class,

both the Students for a Democratic -

Society and the Young Americans for
Freedom retained small but active
chapters on campus, which stub-
bornly tried to cajole the more apa-
thetic students to seek action on
important social issues. The ’72
graduates saw the Black Action So-
ciety and the Associated Women
Students become major political and
social forces on campus.

The class of ’72 saw several forms of
student government come and go
during their four year stay at Pitt.
They witnessed several mediocare

sport seasons, the astro-turfing of
the stadium, and the 1971 World se-
ries Victory for the Pirates. They
played an active role in the Universi-
ty’s battle with the residents’ of Oak-
land over the expansion of Pitt.

Speakers such as Ralph Nader, Betty
Friedan, Robin Morgan, George
McGovern, Walter Hickel, Dick Gre-
gory, Shirly Chisholm, and William
Kunstler spoke and inspired the
class of ’72. Also, they saw a Pitt
coed named Miss Pennsylvania and
HAIR and SUPERSTAR make their
Pittsburgh debuts. The graduates
“grooved” to the music of the Car-
penters, the Fifth Dimension, Blood
Sweat and Tears, Don McClean,
Chicago, Three Dog Night.

They watched in horror as four stu-
dents (one girl from Pittsburgh) were

shot at a war protest at Kent State
University. But, they were even more
horrified by the attitudes and sedi-
ments of their government, neigh-
bors, and even their parents toward
the death of these students. Early in
their college career, the graduates
witnessed the assasination of Robert
Kennedy and Martin Luther King,
Jr. and of course the election of Rich-
ard Nixon. They rejoiced when the 18
year old vote was signed in to law,
but the majority were already legal
voters.

The time from the diploma in ’68 to
the bachelors in ’72 were time of
change. Long hair became the norm.
Bell bottoms were once daring fash-
ion; bell bottoms now became the
ONLY dress. Period dress, the ﬂap-
per of the twenties, the vamp of the
forties, and the classic look of the
sixties weren’t halloween by 1972 but

trends in fashion. Men changed from
button down to the long pointed col-
lar. Coeds saw scooter skirts and hot
pants replace bermudas. Midis came
and came and so did long dresses,
while the mini stayed on. Yes, the
class of ’72 saw fashion change and
they changed with it. Morals too
were changing and the progressive
students changed with them. But
they ask, has the world changed or
have we just grown up? Maybe it is a
new freedom not yet recognized or
controlled.

The University offered them in four
years a chance to grow up, to mature,
to meet and interact with stimulat-
ing individuals, good and bad admin-
istrators and instructor, worthwhile
and meaningless courses, but most of
all a chance to learn how to cope with
modern problems and to become a
unique person — an individual.

The College Of Arts And Sciences

The College of Arts and Sciences offers B.A. and B.S.
degrees in the Humanities, the Social Sciences, and
the Natural Sciences. After four terms of a wide
range of subjects, the CAS student declares a major.
The next four terms are spent almost exclusively in
the selected specialized area. A student may design a
major provided his self major will involve work from
two or more departments, is planned around a coher-
ent theme, and is sponsored by a faculty member. All
courses offered by the College enable the student to
develop skill and knowledge in his chosen field of
study.

School of Education

The School of Education prepares
students for teaching, educational
administration, and other special-
ized fields of work in primary, sec-
ondary and special education. As a
member of the American Association
of Colleges for Teachers Education,
the School of Education is accredited
by the National Council for Accredi-
tation of Teacher Education with the
doctor’s degree as the highest ap-
proved degree.

In the beginning of the student’s ju-
nior year, informal contacts with
actual teaching are provided. The
following year student teaching is
practiced. Pittsburgh and Suburban
school districts participate in this
useful and necessary educational
experience.

In order to introduce teachers to the
highly diverse type of education be-
coming popular, the Falk Laboratory
School is utilized. Over the years Dr.
Jonas Salk and Dr. Benjamin Spock
have conducted experiments and
conferences in the school, which have
added to the improved methods of
teaching. Using this and other facili-
ties have allowed the School of Edu-
cation to exert a great influence in
the improvement of education.

For Pitt engineers, a 1971-72 was the
year that a vision of the University’s
Trustees, an abundance of award-
winning architects’ drawings and
tons of concrete and steel and labora-
tory and classroom equipment finally
were brought together to form a
completely functional center of for-
mal and informal learning. As early
as 1965, a new engineering facility
occupied an important place in the
Trustees’ development plans for the
University. In 1967, construction of
the Michael L. Benedum Hall of En-
gineering was begun, and a Pitts-
burgh achitectural firm received an
honor award from the Pennsylvania
Society of Architects of the American
Institute of Architecture for its de-
sign of the new engineering complex.
By the fall of 1968, Benedum Hall
was to have been where this year’s
seniors, as freshmen, learned, con-
gregated, rapped and momentarily
failed as they adjusted to the new
folk—ways of college life. A succession
of engineering and labor problems,
however, delayed completion of Be-
nedum Hall until early 1971. A new
academic year had begun before all of
the laboratory and other equipment
could be transferred from Engineer-
ing Hall to Benedum Hall and made
Operational.

Today the Trustee’s vision is a reali-
ty that houses all Pitt engineering
students and dominates the northern

g half of the campus, symbolizing to

some engineerings’ paramount role in
society. At the same time, Benedum
Hall’s magnificent windows, a domi-
nant feature of the architecture, mir-
ror glimpses of the Oakland com-
munity and the rest of the campus,
reminding engineering students that
engineers cannot solve society’ prob-
lems alone and that they do have a
responsibility to the society so radi-
cally affected by their innovations.

Inside Benedum Hall Pitt engineer-
ing students demonstrated increas-
ing seriousness about their profes-
sion’s role in society. For them, 1971-
72 was not only the year for the new
building, but more importantly, the
year of growing social awareness.

In the popular view, engineers gener-
ally are regarded as serious, socially
dull people. In fact, engineering’s

527

46

own apocrapha has it that at an engi-
neer’s bachelor party, attended only
by his engineering friends, a bikini-
clad damsel failed to pop out of a
cake at the proper moment because
she had been lulled to sleep by the
boring conversation. Whether engi-
neers actually generate more ennui
at parties than their counterparts in
the humanities and social sciences
remains open to speculation.

Growing social awareness on the part
of Pitt engineering students was evi-
denced in many ways during the past
academic year. In nearly all courses,
no matter how ethereal the subject
matter, discussion eventually turned
to more earthy matters like pollution
and the human effects on innovation.
More courses dealing with the envi-
ronment were available than ever
before. In the freshman design
course, students devised a river
transportation system that, at least
in theory, would unclog Pittsburgh’s
congested highway network without
affecting river ecology. In senior de-
sign courses, increasing numbers of
projects dealt with “now,” real—world
problems. And in Chemical Engi-
neering, a group of students request-
ed a course on the citing of nuclear
power plants. The department chair-
man volunteered to teach the course
himself.

In the Skyscraper Engineer, editor
Dick Beswick criticized some of
Pittsburgh’s corporate and govern-
ment leaders for their alleged failure
to deal effectively with pollution,
transportation and other problems.
Not all engineers — in fact, probably
not even a majority — agreed with
Beswick’s positions. But his biting
comments had a gadﬂy effect, stir-
ring students and faculty alike from
their lethargy.

Perhaps the most visible signs of so-
cial awareness were in Engineers’
Week, a traditional March observ-
ance of Pitt engineers sponsored by
Engineering Student Cabinet. In the
past, Engineers’ Week was highly
competitive. Departments competed
for the Shamrock Award in a long list
of competitive events.

In September, Engineering Student
Cabinet conducted Evaluation Meet-

528

ings to determine what changes, if
any, should be made in Engineer’s
Week. Open to all engineering stu-
dents and faculty, these meetings
produced a decsion to subdue the
competitive nature of Engineer’s
Week. The rational for the change
was that the Service Project, the Ar-
rival and the Shamrock Ball seemed
inappropriate objects of competition.
These events, the rationale contin-
ued, should draw support on the ba-
sis of their merit alone. A desire also
was expressed to accommodate those
persons who are not especially
competitive. 

The meetings also resulted in a deci-
sion to eleminate the St. Patricia
contest because of the belief that it
promoted an undesirable, “sexist”
image of engineers and engineering
students. ESC leaders, expressing a
desire to recruit more woman engi-
neering students, felt that the con-
test would hinder recruiting efforts.

In an effort to remove the widely held
belief that engineers are academic
hermits, unable to function normally
without a slide rule in one hand and a
book replete with mathematical for-
mulas in the other, ESC added a play
to the Engineers’ Week activities.
Engineering students provided al-
most the entire cast and support for
four performances of the Agatha
Christie drama “The Mousetrap.”
Engineers’ Week also was highlight-
ed by a concert at Syria Mosque by
the 5th Dimension and by the Sham-
rock Ball at Churchill Valley Country
Club.

At a dinner preceding the Ball, out-
standing senior awards were present-
ed to Pat Parks, Chemical Engineer-
ing; Joseph Colella, Civil Engineer-
ing; James Kiesel, Electrical Engi-
neering; Dennis Ganster, Industrial
Engineering; John Elder, Mechanical
Engineering; Scott Hartmann,
Aerospace Engineering, and Ronald
Gronsky, Metallurgical and Materi-
als Engineering.

Thomas Honeychek was presented
the Engineering Student Cabinet
International Travel and Training
(ESCITT) Award of $500 to pay for
the cost of travel to an overseas
summer work assignment.

529

ESC provided an opportunity for
engineering students to get to know
one another by holding a beer blast
after the Arrival of St. Patrick. The
patron saint of Ireland and engineers,
apparently not fully recovered from
his tricycle accident a year ago, ar-
rived by ambulance.

Three competitive events remained
after the changes were introduced by
ESC — the Gimmick, Game Night
and the Soap Box Derby. The Gim-
mick consisted of cigar smoking,
greased pole climbing and egg tossing
contests. When the points were add-
ed up at the end of the contests, the
Chemical Engineering Department
had won the Shamrock Award.

The Service Project brought in ap-
proximately $1,500, which was do-
nated to the Western Pennsylvania‘
School for Blind Children and the

Lower Oakland Senior Citizens
Fund.

“ Student leaders for 1971-72 included
Dennis Yeskey, ESC president; Ron
Gronsky, Vice president; Leon De-
Palma, recording secretary; Joseph
Bryan, treasurer; Charles Bowers,

,plant director, and Andy Cornelius,
Central Planning Committee chair-
man. Associate Professor William
Conturo continued as advisor to En-
gineering Student Cabinet.

, Ken Dears kept engineering students

J informed of ESC activities and up-
coming events as editor of The Engi-
neering Bulletin. Dears’ efforts were
augmented by Dave Nichols, assist-
ant editor; Dave Morgan, Terry
Reinhart and Sue Suchr, writers;
Tim Huwe and Chuck P. Blumen—

7schein, production editors, and John
Cujas, sports editor.

School of Dental Medicine

The School of Dental Medicine is an
integral part of the schools of health
professions at the University. The
underclassmen have clinical experi-
ences throughout the hospitals in the
University Medical Center. Through
these exposures to other health
fields, the dentist can gain apprecia-
tion of his role in the health team.

Salk Hall provides the students with
305 dental operatories and various
facilities for research. As clinical
experience the dentistry students
work with the auxiliary personnel to
provide complete dental health care.

Unique to the University is the four-
year curriculum leading to the
D.M.D. degree, plus a seven year
combined Liberal Arts-Dentistry
program leading to the BS degree
which is given after completing three
years of liberal arts and one year of
Dentistry and the D.M.D. which is
given at the completion of the sev-
enth year.

Dental Assistants
and Oral Hygienists

The demand for dental auxiliary personnel has increased
rapidly in recent years. The University has established a
three term program to meet the demand for dental assist-
ants. Those select students spend many hours working in
the clinics at Salk Hall and attending many hours of class-
es. Their professional role includes chairside assisting and
routing lab work as well as office procedures.

The Oral Hygiene program at the School of Dental Medi-
cine graduates students who have completed the certified
dental assistant program plus completed three additional
terms of the Hygienist program. The Oral Hygienist as-
sists in the Dental Clinic and is involved in public dental
health care and education.

School of Nursing

The educational programs of the
School of Nursing are directed to-
ward the preparation of professional
nurses, who in collaborations with
other in health professions, are able
to plan for and deliver comprehen-
sive and high level nursing care to
the sick. Presbyterian University
Hospital, Magee—Women’s Hospital,
West Penn and Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic are utilized by
these students for clinical
experiences.

This years’ graduating class is the
first to complete the new four year
program that began in the Fall Term
of 1968. The new course of study re-
quires one year of liberal arts and
three years of nursing courses. Upon
graduation, the students receive
their BSN and are qualified to take
the State Board’s licesing exam, and
practice their professions.

School of the Health Related Professions

The School of Health Related Profes-
sions, located in the newly renovated
Pennsylvania Hall, was established
at the University in January, 1969. It
was then, and is now comprised of
the Department of Child Care and
Development, Medical Technology,
and Physical Therapy. A new depart-
ment is being established in the field
of Medical Records.

Students of Medical Technology
spend time in the classroom and the
laboratory studying such fields as
Microbiology, Hemotology, Urinalys-
is and other areas of the profession.
The clinical areas utilized by the
Med Techs include all the hospitals
within the University’s Health
Center.

The Physical Therapy students are
also scattered throughout the Uni-
versity Hospital Complex. They now
have access to a fully equipped anat-
omy lab and learning research center
in Pennsylvania Hall. The School
and its faculty are involved in na-
tional seminars, research, and conti-
nuing education programs pertinent
to the field of physical therapy.

Children’s residential treatment cen-
ters and Child Care Development
centers of the city of Pittsburgh are
used by students of the Child Care
and Development curriculum. These
students study the growth and devel-
opmental processes of children and
are prepared to work in many areas of
child care.

School of Pharmacy

554

Students striving for a career in
Pharmacy spend one year in CAS
and then apply for admission to the
School of Pharmacy. Upon accept-
ance the student prepares for four
years of intensive study in his chosen
field. Classes include Chemistry,
Economics, Pharmaceutics and Mi-
crobiology just to name a few. Many
labs are utilized to prepare the stu-
dent for total understanding of com?
position and effects of certain drugs.

A “mock pharmacy” allows students
to experience pharmacy procedures
used in hospitals and public
pharmacies.

This past year the School of Pharma-
cy invited many alumni and new
students to an Open House at Salk
Hall to meet faculty members and
see just how much the school has
expanded and grown in the past few
years.

The Graduate School of 

Library and Informational Science

564

The Graduate School of Library and
Information Sciences (GSLIS) offers
an integrated program of studies to
students, preparing them for a broad
range of professional positions in the
library, communication, and infor-
mation science fields. The program
in library and information science at
the University of Pittsburgh recog-
nizes the need for librarians and in-
formation specialists to develop ca-
pacities and skills to meet the
requirements of rapidly changing
environments, cleintele, and
technologies.

Specificially, it is the goal of GSLIS
to prepare individuals who are able
to identify needs, set goals, analyze
problems, and formulate original and
creative solutions, and to participate

in planning, organizing, communi-
cating, and administering successful
programs of service to users of librar-

ies or specialized information centers
of all kinds.

To prepare librarians for these res-
ponsibilities, GSLIS offers programs
of graduate study leading to the
Master of Library Science degree,
an Advanced Certficate in Library
and Information Sciences, and the
Doctor of Philosophy degree. It has
over 400 students currently enrolled
in the three programs. The School is
housed in the L.I.S. building near the
Cathedral of Learning where there
are school and faculty offices, class-
rooms, and the School’s library, and
Information Science Laboratory,
Media Communications Laboratory,

and Technical Services Laboratory.
The International Library Informa-
tion Center of GSLIS collects prima-
ry source material for comparative
studies in librarianship on the inter-
national level, and supplements the
school’s library holdings on interna-
tional aspects of librarianship.

The Bureau of Urban Library Re-
search is a research unit of the School
created in 1967 primarily as an out-
growth of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s strong involvement in study-
ing the problems of urban develop-
ment and contributing to the plan-
ning, programming, organizing, and
administering of urban programs,
services, and facilities such as
libraries.

Students attending the University of Pittsburgh regional
campuses have, educationally speaking, the best of two
possible worlds. In efforts to meet the growing demands of
higher education as well as provide the student with the
best possible education, the University has established
the regional campus system.

Students participating in the system have the advantage
of gaining two totally different types of college experience
in their undergraduate years. The first two years are per-
haps the most important from the students’ View point.
During this time they develop a foundation on which they
can build and specialize in their later years. The Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh regional campus system offers students
individual attention in a small college atmosphere in the
first two years of their college career; and a large urban
university experience in the final years of their undergrad-

uate work.

Regional Campuses

During the 1971-72 school year the regional campuses have
seen many new improvements and additions to their pre-
sent facilities. These include, to mention a few, new dor-
matories, enlarged computer science hardware and ex-
panded lab and recreational facilities. The regional cam-
puses are, in a sense becoming more and more independent
of the Oakland campus. The University of Pittsburgh at
Johnston now offers a four year program which leads to a
bachelor degree in science and art. The first graduating
class of that program graduated in April 1972.

In the future years as the demand for higher education in-
creases and as Oakland becomes more and more crowded
the regional campuses seem to provide the best and most
economical answer to higher education.

.

The Bradford campus of the University of Pittsburgh has
excellent teaching facilities. Forty five percent of the teach-
ing faculty now hold Ph D degrees with many other faculty
members very near to completing that degree. The Bradford
campus boasts a student faculty ratio of twelve to one, which
is reflective of the utmost in an individualized learning
experience.

Groundbreaking was held this past winter at Bradford for a
new specially designed dormitory with 76-2 bedroom units.
The dormitory is pictured above.

University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg

The students at the University of Pittsburgh at Greens-
burg had several things to be excited about this year. Their
basketball squad, the Pitt Greensburg Panthers, won the
championship game of the University Regional Campuses
Basketball Tournament by defeating Johnstown 93-87.
This was quite a victory for Greensburg in that Johnstown
has had the title for the past two years. Last year, Greens-
burg suffered a heartbreaking 69-67 loss in the champion-
ship game.

The Greensburg campus tries to make its courses some-
what unique, and this year the students enjoyed a Renais-
sance banquet. The students and the faculty at Pitt
Greensburg recreated the age of Erasmus, Luther, Shake-
speare, and Spencer. The banquet concluded the term
studies of the Renaissance era. Another event the students
enjoyed this fall was presented by the Greensburg Campus

Cast rehearses proposal scene from
Oscar Wild’s “The Importance of Being
Ernest”.

Theater Workshop. Their presentation of Oscar Wilde’s
“The Importance of Being Earnest” was considered a huge
success.

In an attempt to provide the best educational opportuni-
ties for the students, the Computer Science Department
at Pitt Greensburg has installed many new computer facil-
ities. Thomas E. Wolfe, chairman of the division of Mathe-
matics, Engineering, and Computer Science at Greens-
burg, has said that these facilities may soon equal those of
the Oakland Campus. Although Greensburg may not have
as many keypunches, sorters, teletypes, and computer
equipment as the main campus does, Mr. Wolfe did point
out though, that the same jobs that are handled now by
the computer, center in Oakland will soon by handled by
the Greensburg Computer Center.

University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown

The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown is continuing
to grow. The school now enrolls 1500 full-time and over 550
part-time students, from all sections of Pennsylvania and
other neighboring states. Freshmen entering the Johns-
town campus enroll in either the College of Arts and Sci-
ences, The School of Engineering or the School of Nursing.
The recently established four—year programs in the fields
of elementary and secondary education has been very suc-
cessful. Additional four-year programs in several areas
within the Humanities have been approved. The new $1.8
million library is now in operation and construction of a
new Engineering—Science building will soon begin.

The faculty now numbers over 85 and represents a good
cross—section holding advanced degrees from a varied
group of institutions of higher education.

Students at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown are
offered a wide variety of activities during the academic
year. These include Freshmen Orientation, The Presi-
:lent’s Reception, Honors Convocation, Tap Day, Greek
Week, and Festival of Candles. Other organizations in-
:lude Student Government, Associated Women Students,

the Interfraternity and Intersorority Councils, numerous
honorary societies, the student newspaper —— “The Pan-
ather”, religious and other groups, such as the Debating
Union, Glee Club, and Dramatics Club. Athletic activities
include varsity basketball, baseball, soccer, tennis, and
golf teams, together with a full program of intramural
sports. These activities give the student a chance to par-
ticipate outside the classroom. In addition, on campus
numerous events including art exhibits, plays, concert
groups, speakers, and dances are scheduled throughout
the year.

The academic-dormitory complex is located on a rise over-
looking a 455 acre tract of picturesque Western Pennsyl-
vania woodland. Although a suburban campus, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh at Johnstown is just minutes away
from downtown Johnstown, an industrial hub of almost 60,
000 people, and only 70 miles east of metropolitan Pitts-
burgh itself. The Johnstown campus offers personalized
quality education of a small college along with the advan-
tage of being an integral part of a large metropolitan
university.

University of Pittsburgh at Titusville

The Titusville Campus is continuing to expand with the
beginning of the foundation work for the new library just
east of McKinney Hall. The library will have a capacity of
45,000 books and other facilities such as a theater-
auditorium.

The theater group produced three plays the past season
culminating with “The Fantastics”. The theater arts un-
der the direction of Mr. Ted Burtt, is planning an expan~
sion to four productions next year.

Mr. Burtt, one of several new full-time faculty members,
previously was playwright in residence at Fredonia State,
New York, and resident director of the Dunkirk—Fredonia
theater.

The expansion of the full—time faculty has allowed for an
increased variety of courses, such as theater arts, black
studies, organic chemistry and others.

A student life committee, comprised of students, faculty
and administration members, is functioning to establish
rules and procedures for the campus.

Titusville hosted the annual summer meeting of the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees. The board meets at a different
campus once each year. The meeting allowed Titusville
faculty, students and trustees to participate in board
discussions.

No one ever reads the forward of a
book. That is why this book’s forward
became a backward. This backward
has assumed all the rights and priv-
ledges of the forward, but not its
space.

Every forward has three major func-
tions, to give a reason for the book, to
explain any biases, and to thank
those who deserve thanks. This back-
ward will rise to the occasion and
meet the criteria.

First, the purpose of the yearbook is
by definition to record a year. Even
this heavy doorstop could never get
365 days into 600 + pages. That is
why much of the book is in pictures
and quotes. These are the instanta-
neous reactions of the eye and ear
when you were there (and helping
you if you missed something). But
like any true sense reaction they have
no significance unless your mind and
memories interact with them. This
yearbook then, is to revitalize your
memories now and many nows from
now.

Secondly, to explain biases is of
course hard if they are your biases.
But the OWL staff on a whole tried
not to take a major stand on the is-
sues at hand. We have tried to keep
editorials, which means editors on
soap boxes, to a minimum. There are
two reasons no one person could ever
hope to give a truely representative
view of the feelings of the Pitt stu-
dent and especially the class of 1972.
Diversity is the problem. Who could
at once give thorough editorial cover-
age to sports, blacks, the Unicycle
club, the administration, ect.? Nor
did we feel that every fault of life
should be emphasized. Some of the
bad feeling should be left to the haz-
ing of memories, for there are so
many good points to emphasize in
our memories of Pitt. So editorials
here tried to give rounded informa-
tion to help and aid your memories.

Third, finally and with out a doubt,
the most important reason for the
backward is to give thanks to those
who so rightfully deserve it. Despite
what many persons believe, one man
is no man as far as Yearbook editors
go. It is impossible for a single person
to produce a book of this size. The

small but dedicated staff of the OWL
deserves the credit and the thanks
for their efforts and work to produce
this book.

Sharon Kovacs Drake did an out-
standing job in the events section. At
times she put me to shame because
of the work that she did for one sec-
tion. But Sharon’s efforts were not
confined to the events section. She
willingly helped with all sections and
her opinions and suggestions proved
to be extremely valuable. Sharon was
always ready to analyze and better
her section and other sections even if
it meant more, much more work . . .
thank you, Sharon.

At times I wouldn’t see Mike Smith
for weeks and maybe months but
some how the Greek section was done
and done well. Mike and I had many
heated discussions over parts of the
Greek section and he managed to win
them and to win the Greeks to the

1972 OWL. This year’s Greek section
is one of the most inclusive and larg-
est of any college yearbook
thanks to Mike.

Another rarely seen face was that of
Bob (Bobbo) McLuckie. There was a
time when I felt for sure Bob had left
town but his section too managed to
be completed. His typing and writing
ability greatly improved by end of
the summer. The Organization sec-
tion of the 1972 OWL is the largest in
Pitt history and Bob worked hard for
that rather dry section  thank
you, Bob.

The second thing most people look at
in a yearbook is the sports section.
(Their picture is the first). Mark
Matis did a very fine job of co—ordi-
nating and photographing the sec-
tion. Again, the athletics section is
the largest in Pitt’s history but one
can not measure it by size alone.
Mark insisted on including ALL

607

54

sports and not just football and bas-
ketball. Mark’s quote idea proved to
be very effective. Mark deserves
more thanks than I can give here . . .
simply thank you, Mark.

Although Mark master-minded the
sports section, Vince DiNardo did all
the writing. Vince accepted a very
large task and he completed it well. I
thank him for walking up the hill in
the middle of hot July to get a quote
or scores. But it didn’t end there, in
the evenings (which were hot too) he
wrote and wrote and wrote.

If you ever wondered who typed the
indexes it was Paula Shurna. Paula
worked full time this summer and
typed full time for the OWL. How
she did it I don’t know but she did
and with out any mistakes. Also,
Paula helped complete the sports
section.

Another typist who typed most of the
copy and id’s for the book was Linda

608

Gall. Linda’s capacity for typing was
fantastic no matter how much there
was she managed to get it done. Lin-
da, thank you.

The latest addition to the OWL staff
and life saver was Jim Mapes. Jim
drew most of the layouts for this
book. While we all could work quick-
ly with our minds and pens Jim had
the very time consuming job of draw-
ing into reality our ideas. I think if
you look at the book his work speaks
for itself . . . simply thank you, Jim.

A book this size would not be possi-
ble without the good planning and
work that the business staff provid-
ed. Cindy Currens served as business
manager in the fall and provided the
basic foundation and planning of the
business staff as well as the budget.
Thank you Cindy. Alan Segal and his
associates, Bob Berger and Lisa Kro-
nenfeld, and the entire business
staff, picked up where Cindy fin-
ished. They made this book become a

reality . . . thank you all.

Others on the production staff which
deserve a note of thanks are Fred
McLuckie for doing a great job draw-
ing the greek ID outlines as well as
writing copy and lending a very need-
ed hand, Chuck Steeber whose work
is questionable but moral support
and sounding board ability unques-
tionable, Eileen Lisick for writing the
copy for the schools in the graduate
section, Bob Gedikoh for writing the
introduction to the class of 1972,
David Sporsic for coordination of the
dental pictures, Dennis Yeskey for
help with the engineering honori-
aries’ copy and id’s as well as John
Burke and Judy McLaughlin for de-
signing the spread on Pitt Engineer-
ing with Dennis. Gary Spicuzza for
group pictures, Janis La Salle for her
secretarial help in the fall, the broth-
ers of Phi Delta Theta, not so much
for their help but moral support, and
of course The Pitt News and Mike
Miller for their quotes and pictures.

Sylvan Pinto, the American Repre— i

sentative, proved to be Very able and
provided valuable assistance when
necessary. Thank you Sylvan for

being understanding in those long .

delays and unusually wild and wish-
ful dreams of this staff. A job well
done to Sylvan and the entire Ameri-
can team.

Root Studios of Chicago and espe-
cially their Representative Scott
Nozawa deserve thanks for a fine job
on the over 1500 graduate pictures
and for providing the staff with other
things besides 1500 glossies. To you
too, a job well done.

Our publications advisors, Eleanor
Walsh and R. David Tive deserve a
note of thanks. They provided advice
and help when it was most needed.
They were always there and able to
solve the problem or at least suggest
practical solutions. Also, thanks to
their secretary, Vee Vee, for her help
and understanding.

Others on the student affairs staff
deserve thanks but mainly Bill Mar-
kus and Lou McLinden. Both of
them offered suggestions and help
which was extremely valuable.

L. D. Savauge, Office Delaney, Cus-

todians Paul, Harry, and Bill (May) I
thank for their kindness and help
beyond the call of duty. The Univer-
sity should have more people like
them. I thank Dick Bowker in pur-
chasing for managing to get odd
things for us Monday mornings and
Friday afternoons with out a single
complaint.

Drs. Burkhardt, Gray, Sargent, and
Ralph thank you for your under-
standing and patients with a senior
editor.

Special thanks to Dr. Winnie Dick-
enson for her constant interest, help,
and encouragement with any prob-
lem no matter how small. Her advice
and help benefitted not only the book
but has been invaluable to me.
Thank you.

I wish to thank all of our photogra-
phers for a great job and for putting
up with a demanding editor. Mark
Lieberman deserves a special thanks
for his tolerance to me and his Will-
ingness to provide darkrooms to us,
not for a day but for weeks. Thanks
to a past photo editor (1967) Tom
Streever for his pictures of the re-
gional campus as well as many of the
photos in the Opening section.

My family deserves a note of thanks
for their constant understanding,
encouragement, tolerance, and late
meals.

I could make this list longer and
longer but the end must come so to
those not specifically thanked I
thank you for your help, efforts and
time.

To all of you I thank for creating an
outstanding yearbook, one Pitt and
its students can be proud of, and for
making this past year a very special
one to me, one which will not soon be
forgotten.

And finally. If one picture or line of
copy sparks a memory for you and
involves you, then the purpose of this
book has been fulfilled and you have
given me and my staff great gratifi-
cation for this is not just a memory
book of the past year but a chapter in

yourlife . . .

Alfred L. Moyé, Ph.D.
DeanS

tudem,‘ Affairs

74

When one thinks of student services, The Of-
fice of Student Affairs usually does not come
to mind, however, service is their main role on
the Pitt campus.‘ The OWL talked with Dean
Alfred L. Moyé about some of the services of-
fered by and the changes made in The Student
Affairs Office.

' Dr. Moyé was appointed to Dean of Student

Affairs in January 1972. He is an Assistant
Professor of Chemistry at Pitt where he earned
his Ph.D. in 1968. Prior to coming to Pitt, Dr.
Moyé was an instructor at West Virginia Wes-
leyan College where he received his BS. degree
in 1960.

‘ Dr. Moye"s many honors include the Distin-

guished Teaching Award in 1970, membership
in The American Chemical Society, The Socie-
ty of Sigma Xi, The American Association for
the Advancement of Science, Phi Lambda
Upsilon, The American Association of Higher
Education, and The National Association of
Student Personal Administrator. Dr. Moyé,
also, attended the First National Congress of
Black Professionals in Higher Education.

Dr. Moyé has published numerous articles in
the Journal of Chemical Education and Exper-
iments in Organic Chemistry published for
University ofPitts burgh Students.

OWL: How do you view your role as
Dean of Student Affairs?

MOYIS: The concept of Student Af-
fairs has changed significantly in the
past decade. No longer is it strictly
involved in extra-curricular activities
and non-academic services. Today's
students are interested in more serious
pursuits such as top—level administra-
tive policy decision—making, curricu-

lum changes, legal matters, etc. Con-
sequently the student affairs officer’s
role takes on new significance. He
must be able to assist students in ef-
fecting the structural changes in the
University and substantive changes in
the curriculum. He is responsible for
improving the climate and the quality
of campus life. To this end, the Dean
of Student Affairs at the University of
Pittsburgh reports directly to the
Chancellor and as a member of his
staff, has the opportunity to intro-
duce matters which concern students
at the highest decision-making level in
the University. Here, at the core of the
University, he is able to help develop
the concept of the student being at the
heart of the University. Traditionally
there has been a gap between the
academicians and the spokesmen for
students — i.e., the ‘chief student af-
fairs officer — on many campuses.
Coming from the academic ranks, I
hope I can impose an academic com-
ponent on the Office of Student Af-
fairs and serve as a pipeline from the
students to all levels of administration
such as that students will learn the
most effective way to articulate their
needs directly to deans, directors, and
department heads. The I-Iazen report
of The Student in Higher Education
states clearly that ”it is no longer pos-
sible to take a narrow view of intelli-
gence as ‘academic knowledge,’ isolat-
ing cognitive growth from moral
growth and the general maturation of
the person." This view appears un-
tenable not so much for reasons of
philosophy, but rather because our
knowledge of the nature of the human
personality forces us to conclude that
cognitive growth which is separated
from the development of other aspects
of the human personality is illusory of
distorted.”

In addition, we feel that we must
make it immiently clear to all that the
University of Pittsburgh exists as
much for the student as for the facul-
ty and administration. In no way does
this tend to understate the need for
academic excellence and research ef-
forts but the idea that the University
exists to help students come to fuller
understanding of themselves and life
is different from operating a research
organization. We applaud the involve-
ment of students in promotion and
tenure discussions to assure that inef-
fective teachers are not rewarded and

that effectiveness of teaching is
raised. As a member of the Provost's
Committee on Undergraduate Teach-
ing, I assisted in preparing a docu-
ment which addresses itself to the is-
sue. I am pleased to know that it has
been approved by the Deans and is
currently being used to evaluate facul-
ty members.

OWL: What other changes have you
made to further student involvement?

MOYI-Z’: In cooperation with the Grad-
uate Council we have attempted to
organize graduate students into an
association which will represent their
interests and to be an avenue by
which their problems can be articulat-
ed. To support the efforts of graduate
students we have appointed Mr. Mc-
Linden to work with the new organi-
zation and with the General Studies
Student Cabinet which previously
received little, if any, support from
the Office of Student Affairs.

OWL: What Changes have you made
in the Freshman Orientation
Program?

75

MOYE’: Under the leadership of Mr.
Thomas Tackage, Ms. Jackie Mullins,
Miss Terri Amelio and Mr. David
Wahl we experienced one of the best
orientation sessions this year and in-
tend to continue working through the
academic calendar to make sure that it
is even better next year. In conjunc-
tion with orientation, we expanded
our Mentor Program. We have estab-
lished a Mentor Center staffed by
trained students who desire to friends,
advisers, helpers, counselors and
ombudsmen to fellow students. To

76

better train and recruit Mentors, there
will be a credit course offered in the
Winter term which will focus on the
educational mission of the University
and acquaint students with the opera-
tions of the University.

Orientation was held in late June with
all students invited to attend at one
time. The program was well received
by the College, the Schools of Nursing
and Engineering and more important-
ly, by the incoming Freshmen.

OWL: What other issues has your of-*

fice been involved in that has brought
about some type of change?

MOYE‘: Our campus judicial system
became effective January 1, 1972 and
has proven to be an extremely impor-
tant and useful tool in insuring all
students due process. It has been so
well received nationally that Mr. Al-
den Bowen is frequently called upon
to discuss it and send copies to var-
ious campuses.

Since January, there has been several
hassles over the use of student activi-
ty fee monies. Weihave now codified
the expenditures of these monies and
before any student group is permitted
to spend money from an activities fee
account, the financial officer and
president will be forced to participate
in a training seminar sponsored by the
Budget Office.

The salary issue has been settled also.
By the recommendations of a task
force which I appointed, requests
from a student group for salary pay-
ments to student leaders will be re-
ferred to and acted upon by a Remu-
nerations Board. The group will be
required to state why payment should
be made and the Board will establish
the amount of payment.

Although I was only peripherally in-

volved in the establishment of the
new health insurance, I am happy to
see that it will be in effect in Septem-
ber and that improved health services
should be available at an extremely
modest rate.

Other changes within the Student
Affairs area is the inclusion of an Of-
fice of Residence Life which is respon-

' sible for the student personnel staff in

housing. The philosophy of the office
is based on two assumptions: (1) the
student's residence hall living is an
important part of his total university
education; (2) the residence hall staff

‘with a defined educational mission

can greatly enhance the opportunities
for students to profit from their resi-
dence hall experience; therefore, it is
the purpose of the department of resi-
dence life to facilitate the personal and
academic growth of residents by striv-
ing to make the whole of residence life
an educational experience. To this
end, the professional and resident as-
sistant staff will provide the essential
wherewithal to facilitate such
development.

We are presently negotiating with the
administration to establish a Veteran
Affairs Office to focus University at-
tention on the problems of the
Veteran.

The Special Programs Office devised
and sponsored many creative educa-
tional programs during the past year.
For 1972-73, the office has been
merged with the Office of Student
Activities; however, the concept of
innovative, educational programming
will be retained.

A major innovation in the Counseling
Center will be the establishment of a
Learning Skills Center which we hope
will be in operation no later than Sep-
tember, 1973. The Counseling Center
will also participate in staffing the
newly formed ”Drop-In Center" in
the Towers. In the Office of Student
Affairs, we operate on the principle
that we exist to serve students, to fa-
cilitate the students problems solving
within the bureaucratic process of the
University and to establish a healthy
environment in which personal
growth and development are achieved
with a minimum number of obstacles.
We do not have all the answers but we
will always try to direct students to
the proper source. When a student
comes to one of our offices, we will do
all we can to solve a problem or make
sure that only one more stop is neces-
sary before a solution is available.

During the 1972-73 school year, we
will put as much pressure as possible
on the administration and Board of

Trustees to make construction of a
new Student Union one of the Univer-
sity's highest priorities. We know that
a union would improve the life—style
of this campus drastically and offer a
dimension which is presently missing
from this institution.

OWL: Is all of this change necessary?
MOYE’: The University and Church

are two institutions which have a tre-
mendous effect on the attitudes of
American Citizens. They are or should
be change agents. They must always
protect themselves from outside pres-
sure and permit the kind of open dia-
logue which leads to change. As acad-
emicians, we must maintain the desire
to have a system which is felxible so
that it can respond to people's needs
as these needs change and develop. If
an educational institution is to be suc-
cessful, it must create for and within
students an atmosphere of continuous
learning, a sensitivity to new ideas
and new products, and an awareness
of injustice, inequity and of the need
to change.

We must develop thinking individuals
who can be the instrument of con-
structive change — people who have
the background to appreciate what
has gone on before and the where-
withall to interpret the future.

79

The office and staff of Student Activities pro-
vides many important and valuable services to
the students and the University. The Owl
talked with Associate Dean ofStudent Affairs;
Director of Student Activities, William H.
Markus about the services and philosophies of
his department.

Mr. Markus received his BA. Degree from
Baldwin—Wallace College and his M.S. degree
in Higher Education from Indiana University.
Presently he is enrolled in an educational
Ph.D. Program here at Pitt. As an undergrad-
uate, Mr. Markus played varsity football, was
a member of Omicron Delta Kappa, and was
listed in “Whos Who In American Colleges
and Universities.”

OWL: Student service is the primary
concern for the student affairs area.
Could you outline some of the serv-
ices and functions of the student ac-
tivities staff?

MARKUS: Most of our services I
think are pretty obvious, however, I
would like to discuss them in two
areas: student organizations and gen-
eral campus. We provide student or-
ganizations with three main services.
First our staff is trained to give advi-
sorship to the organizations. Second,
we provide budgetary help to all stu-
dent groups and finally the student
union provides these groups with of-
fices and meeting facilities. We pro-
vide the student group with about 40
rent free offices. This is really un-
heard of on most college campuses.

Before going on to our general serv-
ices, I would like to make a few points
about extracurricular activities and
student organizations‘. These activi-
ties are a very necessary and impor-
tant part of the learning and growing
process. We in student affairs like to
feel we are the custodians of that pro-
cess. That is, to facilitate and maxi-
mize the opportunities for learning
outside the classroom. There simply is
no time-place relationship to learning.
Besides the classroom, learning & stu-
dent growth does occur in the Student
Union, the tuck shop, laying out a
student publication or deciding the
budget considerations for Black Week.
We try to facilitate student objectives
as much as possible with out hamper-

ing their spontaniety or freedoms. I
think when administrators take this
kind of attitude every one benefits.

Now, back to our other services. As I
said before, we do provide meeting
rooms to any student organization or
any student related group. The ticket
office in the union is maintained by
the student activities people. Our
many informational services include
the information desks in the union
lobby and the cathedral. Also, we pro-
vide a poster mailing service for the
campus. We will post posters and oth-
er information at strategic bulletin
boards. The student calendar distrib-
uted at the beginning of the fall and
winter terms as well as the ”Nutshell"
magazine are services of this office.

OWL: Student affairs and student ac-
tivities are certainly an area of change.
Could you discuss some of the
changes that have been made in the
past year or two?

MARKUS: Your right, this past year
has been one of great change. We have
established a new position on the stu-
dent activities staff. This is to provide
advisorship to graduate and general
studies students. We have tried to
make greater efforts to work with the
graduate and general studies students.

The orientation program is another
area of change. This year we have
much more faculty involvement with
the program than in past years, this
has given more emphasis to academ-
ics. The Mentor Center is being initi-
ated this year to provide students
with peer to peer help and advice.
Undergraduates will be trained to give
this service. Also, we would like to
start a student hotline as part of our
student services.

OWL: Have you seen many changes
in student attitudes in the past few
years?

MARKUS: Lets start by looking at
the attitudes and trends say, five

years ago. Then there was a big press
for change which brought about the
student activist which in turn became
the campus leader. These leaders only
represented few students and mainly
their own interest. Now the trend is

for students to be more serious mind-

ed. They want to learn, they have es-
tablished objectives, they are indus-
trious. There seems to be more a spirit
of cooperation among the faculty,
University and the students. Students

now are much more open and more

responsible. They are getting changes
because although they have learned
that in a large University, red tape is
necessary. They have developed the
sophistication to deal effectively with
the bureacracy.

OWL: What changes or new programs
does student activities have or would
like to see in the future?

MARKUS: We would like to establish
an even broader involvement with
extra—curricular activities. We would
like our involvement to extend to the
commuter, after all, they are an im-
portant part of this University. More
service oriented programs are in store
for the future. We would like to have

more student helping student pro——

grams and more community oriented
programs, this is essential for an ur-
ban University like Pitt.

We are trying to start a travel club
which would sponsor tours and study
abroad. In fact we have 3 tours al-
ready in the planning for the coming
schoolyear.

OWL: Are there any other areas or
thoughts you would like to discuss?

MARKUS: I think we have covered
the Student Activities area fairly well,
I would like to again say that extra-
curricular activities will never die —
they are a major component of the col-
legiate way - not in the traditional
sense but they do fulfill a realistic
educational objective of the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh.

Early in the summer of 1970 the Uni-
versity Senate passed a resolution
recommending the creation of a Uni-
versity Citizenship Information Cen-
ter. The resolution was a direct result
of the incidents at Kent State and
Jackson State. Student demonstra-
tions not only were proving to be
frustrating but dangerous to the
demonstrators. There was a growing
concern among students that the po-
litical process was not working. Stu-
dents on many campuses decided
that the most rational way to change
politics was to become directly in-
volved in political campaigns. It was
in this context that Pitt, along with
other schools, passed resolutions in-
stituting political information
centers.

On October 12, 1970, the Citizenship
Information Center at the University
of Pittsburgh opened with Jane
Thompson as the director. In an in-
terview thisiiyear with the Owl, Miss
Thompson answered questions and
made comments about C.I.C.

OWL: In one sentence, how would
you define the University Citizenship
Information Center?

THOMPSON: I would have to say
that, as the name implies, it is an in-
formation center of a strict political
nature, operating primarily for the
undergraduate students at Pitt.

OWL: What are the main purposes of
the C.I.C.?

THOMPSON: The most important
purpose of the center is to facilitate
the political education of the students
so they will participate effectively as
citizens in electoral politics. We also
collect and collate data of the electoral
process of all three levels of govern-
ment. In addition, the Center is very
active in facilitating academic research
in the electoral processes. Finally, the
C.I.C. functions as a clearing house
for information on electoral processes.

OWL: Have the students shown much
interest in the new information
center?

THOMPSON: Yes, we have had quite
a number of students inquire as to
how they can become active in a polit-
ical manner. Some students prefer to
become involved in the campaigns of
political figures. While others are in-
terested only in the changing of laws,
such as those involving drugs or abor-
tion, for instance. The Center, has on
record over 100 different political or-
ganizations any one of which may in-
terest a particular student.

OWL: In what sort of activities does
the C.I.C. involve itself?

THOMPSON: Well, one of the first
things we did was in November, 1970,
when the CIC sponsored a "Post-
Mortem" Election Analysis following
the general election. Since then, the

C.I.C. co—sponsored a conference on
Allegheny County Government in
January, 1971, with the Americans for
Democratic Action, and the City
Council, League of Women Voters. A
63-page report, ”County Conference"
a report on Allegheny County Gov-
ernment Services, was printed as a
result of the conference. We also co-
sponsored a campus political fair,
"Politics '71" with the College Young
Democrats, Revolutionary Socialist
Union, Young Americans for Freedom
and the Young Republicans. In 1972.
with the help of six other local groups
we held a conference on home rule en-
titled: ”Local Government Change:
Do We Need It?” In addition we
helped set up field registrations at Pitt
where around 3,000 students have
registered to vote.

OWL: Do you anticipate any changes
in the near future for CIC?

THOMPSON: No, I don't think there
will be many changes. Of course there
are more and more students using the
Center each year and naturally we
would like to expand a little and add
to our staff. We are always looking for
new activities and better methods so
that we might be even more useful to
the student body. But there will be no
drastic changes from this year to the
next as far as the C.I.C. is concerned.
The only things likely to change that
fast are the politicians and their
issues.

The University Counseling Center is a very
vital and valuable service not only to the stu-
dents but the entire University. The OWL
spoke with Dr. Penny Crary about several as-
pects of the Counseling Center. Dr. Crary re-
ceived her Bachelars degree from Fairleigh
Dickenson University, Masters from the Uni-
versity of Maryland and her PhD in higher
education from Pitt. Dr. Crary has taught high
school both in the states and in Ecuador. Also,
she has counseled at the University of
Maryland.

OWL: The Counseling Center is a
student affairs division — can any one
use the center?

CRARY: Yes, the center is open, free
of charge to all students, faculty and
staff.

OWL: Could you outline some of the
services offered by the center?

CRARY: We offer individual counsel-
ing for students needing some help
with personal, vocational and academ-
ic problems. (I would like to point out
that we keep no records at the Center
and that we will not release any infor-
mation unless the student gives us
permission to do so.)

The Center also provides group coun-
seling and encounter groups for facul-
ty, graduate students and undergrad-
uates. The purpose of these groups is
to help the members develop and en-
hance their personal and social rela-
tionships. At the present time we are
running a few groups for couples who
are concerned with improving their
relationships.

The Counseling Center also offers a
variety of options in the career plan-
ning area. In addition to individual
counseling we sponsor a series of ca-
reer seminars which enable students
to talk with professionals in various
fields about their careers and oppor-
tunities in different fields. The Center

UNIVERSITY
COUNSELING
CENTER

also has an extensive career library
which can provide students with ca-
reer data not available elsewhere in the
university.

Students planning to attend graduate
school can obtain information about
national and international fellowships
and scholarships at the Center. We
also have a letter of recommendation
service here. Students considering
graduate study can register with us
and have their letters of recommenda-
tion filed here at any time during their
undergraduate career. These letters
will be photocopies and mailed to the
graduate schools chosen by the
student.

OWL: What are some of the changes
you have seen in student attitudes
during the past few years?

CRARY: I find that many students no
longer come to college to learn a par-
ticular skill. They are more concerned
with a broad education which will
enable them to integrate their career
with their chosen life style. Students
today seem less willing to compromise
their values in order to obtain a job.
They want to be able to express them-
selves in a particular career. I have
seen some students turn down attrac-
tive offers with companies that insist
their employees conform to certain
dress and personal appearance stand-
ards. Students today want to establish
their own identities. They feel alienat-
ed from society and are seeking out
their own groups as a means of find-
ing a community within our society. I
find students of the 70’s much more
flexible in every way than students of
the 50's for example.

OWL: Have there been any changes in
the types of counseling you have done
in the past few years?

CRARY: Individual counseling still
comprises most of our time but there
has been an increase in the number of
groups we've been running at the
Center. We are also seeing more facul-
ty and staff members than in previous
years.

OWL: What percentage of students
do you see and what are some of the
problems.

CRARY: It's difficult to talk about
exact percentages according to types
of problems because rarely_ do we
counsel a student whose problem is so
easily put into one category. Yearly
though we see about 10% of the stu-
dent body. Approximately 50% of that
group comes for personal counseling
involving such problems as relation-
ships with parents, spouses, girl or
boyfriends. The range of problems is
so diversified that it's difficult to list
them all.

OWL: What kind of staff does the
Center have?

CRARY: All of our counselors hold
doctorates in counseling, psychology
and related fields. Only these counse-
lors do individual personal counsel-
ing. We also have a graduate fellow-
ship advisor, an occupational special-
ist and a counselor-librarian. These
staff members all have a master’s
degree.

OWL: Can you give us an idea of
what the Center would like to do in
the future?

CRARY: There seems to be an in-
creased demand for group counseling
and encounter groups. We certainly
hope to continue to meet that demand.
We would also like to start a reading
and study skills center at Pitt.

We have already initiated an alumni
career advising program. Our hope is
that students with particular voca-
tional interests can spend time with
alumni who are already engaged in
those vocations. The response from
alumni to this program has been very
encouraging.

Finally, we would like to start a type
of peer counseling service to function
as an auxiliary to the services we pres-
ently offer.

For Graduates this past year, the University
Placement office was with out a doubt the
most sought after student service on campus.
The OWL talks with the Placement Service
directer, Mr. Ernest Holmoch about the serv-
ices and problems ofhis office.

OWL: What is University Placement?

HOLMOCK: Here at the University
Placement Center, our biggest concern
is finding career opportunities for
graduating seniors. We also try to
help students find part-time and
summer employment. Our service is
free and open to all University stu-
\ dents, faculty, staff and alumni.

OWL: You say the center is open to
alumni?

HOLMOCK: Yes, and quite a few
take advantage of this service. We
place a number of alumni each year.
As long as you are a student or a grad-
uate of Pitt, the Placement Center is
open to you, and we will help you as
much as possible.

.OWL: How about a comment on this
year's employment situation?

HOLMOCK: BAD, really bad. I/ve

never felt worse for a class of seniors.

OWL: What do you mean?

HOLMOCK: This years seniors
didn't have much of a chance. There
weren't many jobs to be had. Many of

the corporations and companies cut
way down on the number of recruiters
they sent, and some did not send any
at all. Some companies like General
Motors or Xerox, who would normally
send five representatives and want to
interview at least 200 seniors, only
sent one recruiter, and he would only
interview the first fifteen people he
met. As a result, many, many seniors
did not get interviews, and more did
not get the ones they wanted, even
after waiting in line to sign up at 4 or
5 o'clock on Monday mornings.

OWL: Yes. I heard about the Monday
morning lines at the Placement
Center.

HOLMOCK: Well, it was the only fair
way to handle the situation. We had
so many seniors and so few interviews
available that "first come, first serve"
was the only reasonable solution that
was fair to all.

OWL: Was this situation restricted to
Pitt?
HOLMOCK: No. This was common

at colleges and universities all across
the nation. Some places had it worse
than Pitt. I believe it was Michigan
State who reported that people were
sleeping overnight in line so that they
might have a Chance to sign up for
interviews. It isn't that Pitt has fallen
into disfavor with companies, corpo-
rations and other employers.

OWL: Well, then, what is the
problem?

HOLMOCK: The problem is simply
one of economic decline. For the past
three years the market has declined
successively. I think we have finally
hit the bottom and the economic pic-
ture will rise. In fact, I believe it has
started to do so already. Most of the
engineers from this year have been
placed.

OWL: Then, there is no solution to
the problem except to wait?

HOLMOCK: That's right. Thekecono-
my has to rise. This next year, 1973
should be much better for seniors.

OWL: Finally, have there been any
changes in the Center recently and do
you plan any for the future?

HOLMOCK: The Placement Center
has undergone some changes as far as
size is concerned. We have increased
our professional staff to allow for
more personal contact, which, in turn,
will increase the services which we
render. Our changes in procedure
which took place over the last few
years were only temporary, and I ex-
pect that we will return to normal very
soon. As for change in the future, I
can foresee none. I think things will
be much the same this fall.
