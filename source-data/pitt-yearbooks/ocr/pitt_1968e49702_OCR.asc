volved in a number of studies; for example, there are
student committees studying the future student union
facilities, new residence halls, curriculum and social
regulations. I want to ﬁnd new ways for collaboration
with students.

OWL: This year we have seen a conflict of political in-
terests among the state legislators which resulted in
ﬁnancial difﬁculties for Pitt and other state-related in-
stitutions. Will this situation be a recurring one and
what will be the consequences?

POSVAR: The state relationship has produced certain
instabilities in the last two years. We saw this in the
budget problem of this past year—an impass between
the legislators and the Governor that resulted in delays
of appropriations for the University. I think we can ex-
pect more of the same until Pennsylvania ﬁnds a means
to provide a broader base of revenue for all public edu-
cation. But I also believe that within a year or two, the
state will pass into a new period of ﬁscal responsibility
and better long-range ﬁnancial planning. When this
happens, we will have more clear—cut criteria for pre-
paring our budgets. Having said this, I would like to
stress the great advantages of the state-related status of
the University. I think it gives us the best of both
worlds—support from both the private and the public
sectors. I think our mixed support will become a model
for universities around the United States. In our case,
one of the major portions of our budget—ranging from
one fourth to one third-comes from the state in the
form of tuition subsidies for Pennsylvania students and
for basic educational facilities. Another fourth to a
third comes from the Federal Government. Another
major portion comes from the students in the form of
fees. And we get a very large share of our budget from
private sources—both foundations and individuals.
This mixed support is comparable to the kind you ﬁnd
at Harvard, a “private” school, and Michigan and Cal-
ifornia which are “public” schools. Our situation boils
down to this: we get a secure ﬁnancial base from the
state and our private support gives us the quality incre-
ment—the essential extra amount we need to support
superior programs and special professorships and
facilities.

OWL: There has been much discussion concerning the
cosmopolitan atmosphere at Pitt. Years ago it was
known as a “streetcar university”. Now that the out-of-

state ratio has been decreased there are fears that Pitt
will return to being a commuter college. Are we re-
gressing and will Pitt retain its cosmopolitan atmo-
sphere in ‘the future?

POSVAR: We are progressing, not regressing. The
drop last year in the out—of—state ratio does concern us,
and I’ll get to that in a moment. But more signiﬁcant is
the continual rise in the caliber of the admitted stu-
dents during the past ﬁve years. Along with this, their

diversity has increased tremendously: we have a much
higher percentage of students who are children of blue
collar workers and children of people who did not go
to college themselves; in these respects we now have a
more heterogeneous student body than before. The re-
duction of the out—of—state ratio we hope to correct as
much as we can. The drop last year was due partly to a
dormitory shortage. But as important as the out—of-
state ratio is the out—of—city ratio. The ratio of Pitts-
burgh students will begin to decline as we gain more
facilities. I say percentages will decline; absolute num-
bers of Pittsburghers will increase somewhat. VVhere

There was no getting away from
it. College basketball in the

60’s has practically gone Mad-
ison Avenue. High—pressure re-
cruiting, slick selling. For

Bob Timmons, a coach from the
old school, it was too much.
And so, one day last February,
Timmons announced his resign-
ation. To most people it was

a shock. Many had been cal-
ling for Timmons’ dismissal,

but nobody really expected it.
But then, in the midst of Pitt
basketball’s fourth straight
winter of disaster, Timmons
dropped the bombshell. “You
get discouraged when you don’t
win,” said Timmons. “You put
pressure on yourself, you coach
harder, you like to win because
you have pride in your coaching
ability, but then you feel that
maybe you’re not doing the job.
Maybe you’re not getting across
to the players.” Maybe so, but
the main reason for Timmons
leaving is the recruiting po-
int. Maybe not in so many words,
but it’s in-between the lines.
“Coaching was getting to be no
fun anymore,” he said. And,
“recruiting is something that’s
become a big part of college
basketball.” Put the two to-
gether and it’s obvious. The
strain of recruiting was too
much for the 55-year old, 15-
year coaching veteran. The re-
cruiting belongs to the young-
sters, the Dave Harts, the Dave
Adamses and the ]im Banners.

WEIR’/l@lNJ§

“The fun sorta goes out of it
when you get older I guess,”
Timmons remarked. “Get a lit-
tle older, you lose the enthu-
siasm and you don’t have the
patience.” But to the fan,
Timmons had amazing patience.
He rarely stirred on the bench
during the progress of a game,
despite sitting through four
straight years of winning less
than 10 games. He was unmoved
by the taunts of the crowd-
that is, those few fans who
showed up. And he was unruf—
ﬂed when a spectator threw

a dead ﬁsh on the court last
season to comment on the coach
and the team. He had proved

in the past that he could coa-
ch. Three times his teams went
to the NCAA basketball tourna-
ment, and once to the NIT. “I
guess my best group was the Hen-
non group that went to the NCAA
playoffs two years in a row-
1956—57 and 1957-58,” said Tim-
mons, “but the 1963 and ’64
team that went to the NCAA and
NIT was a good one, too.” Tim-
mons might have added that in
1963 the team had only one sen-
ior, and that coaching took

them as far as they got. For

all his high points, though,

Timmons still lists an overall
record of 174-189 for his 15
years. Actually, Timmons never
even played basketball in col-
lege. While at Pitt he was an
end on the football team. Up
until 1961 he shared his bas-
ketball coaching chores with

a job as an end coach for John
Michelosen. Since retiring as
basketball coach, Timmons did
assume responsibilities as the
tight end coach for Dave Hart.

Timmons is nearly the last in
the list of Pitt’s old—line

coaches to go. Only Leo Bemis
and Warren Neiger remain. Rex
Peery started the trend when

he quit as head wrestling co-
ach. Then ]ohnny Mike was ﬁ-
red. Carl Ress and Ben Grady
left. And so on. The new breed
has a different style and may
well be effective. But some-
thing else has been lost to
coaching when these men leave.
And each coaching change brings
a change in the Fitzgerald Fie-
ld House scenery. But has the
scenery really changed this
time? Hired to replace Timmons

was Charles “Buzz” Ridl from

Westminster. In many respects
Ridl is like Timmons. Physi-
cally, he is Very similar. He
will easily remind the fans of
Timmons. It wasn’t the change

97

the fans were looking for, and
it wasn’t consistant with the
other coaching changes which
brought in younger men; but
Ridl could be the man to pick
up the program where it was
left in the early 60’s. At

any rate, Timmons has retired.
Many fans heaved a sigh of re-
lief, but Timmons was one of
the ﬁne men in the game, and
he will be missed.

98

The brightest spot on the athletic
horizon last year was wrestling.
Long a major power, the Panthers
had been Eastern doormats the past
few seasons. But, new coach Dave
Adams guided the grapplers to a
5-6 season and a ﬁfth place in

the Easterns. For his eﬁ°orts, he

was named “Rookie Wrestling Coach
of the Year” by Amateur Wrestling
News. Bruce Unangst was the next
big story in Pitt wrestling. He

had an undefeated dual meet season
and ﬁnished second in the Easterns.
Terry Hoover and Ron Schuchert
ﬁnished third and fourth respec-
tively in the Easterns. The team
pulleda major upset during the
season by downing Lehigh 19-13.

In one of the best matches of the
season, Paul Allen defeated Lehigh’s
Ron Ries, 8-5, and clinched the
meet. Other sports may be stag-
nated in their losing ways, but
wrestling is on its way to the top.

99

Dave Shidemantle saved gymnastics
from a disastrous season by win-
ning the Long Horse championship
in the Easterns. It was his sec-

ond individual title, as he also

won it two years ago as a sopho-
more. The team was not as proﬁ-
cient, compiling an unenviable,
even by Pitt standards, 1-10

record.

 

New swimming coach Bill Grant
found the water rather cold in
his ﬁrst year. The swimmers
posted a 3—9 record, despite the
fact that they broke a swarm of
Pitt records. The losing season
could best be attributed to a
lack of depth, a common disease
at Pitt. However, Grant has one
of the world’s ﬁnest pools as a
selling point, and should soon
ﬁeld a respectable team if he
can recruit.

The track team was a year away
from being a winner last year,
because its best performers

were only freshmen. The team
ﬁnished with a 2-4 record, but
captain Roger Holly had some
personal glory with a ﬁfth

place ﬁnish in the 888 yard

run at the IC4A’s after running
his best time ever.

After the ﬁrst winning season

in ten years, last year, the
netters returned to normalcy,
and lost. The top three men
again had winning years, but a
considerable lack of depth
caused a number of defeats in
the lower brackets. Captain

Bob Salembier was named MVP.

the out—of—state student come from also is important.
Not much is added to the cosmopolitan ﬂavor by get—
ting students from easter Ohio or southern New York.
We stand to gain a great deal more by bringing stu-
dents from Texas, California and foreign countries,
and, even more important, black students from ghetto
neighborhoods. Now I think we tend to overlook one
vital element in the cosmopolitan character of the Uni-
versity, and that is faculty. If the faculty comes from a
variety of institutions—as ours does-—then the learning
experience will be much more cosmopolitan. We have
a very low percentage of Pittsburgh Ph.D’s on our fac-
ulty; our “inbreeding ratio” is very low. So, I would say
that in balance, among major American universities
we are comparatively heterogeneous and are getting
more so. Last summer, we had a faculty turnover of
only eight or nine percent which is one of the lowest-
perhaps the lowest—of any large university in the Uni-
ted States. That is a very optimistic indicator. In gener-
al, let me stress that this university is now on a thres-
hold of a decade of vigorous growth.

OWL: How do you View the role of the regional
campuses?

POSVAR: To be justiﬁed, our regional campuses must

be an integral part of the University. They are going
to be brought up to the full academic standards of the
main campus and they will serve as geographically dis-
persed locations for different kinds of programs.
OWL: There has been some talk that the campuses
will be used as undergraduate schools and that the
Oakland campus will become a graduate school.
POSVAR: You mean exclusively, no. They will remain
undergraduate schools. They will permit us to expand
our graduate programs in Oakland, but we expect that
the numerical majority of students on the Oakland
campus will always be undergraduates.

OWL: The Chancellor of a University has many di-
verse roles. How do you view your relationship with
the undergraduates? What is your role?

POSVAR: I have a number of what you might call con-
stituencies. A position like this is more similar to an
office in government than it is to an office in a business
corporation. Our publics include, of course, the com-
munity, the state legislators, the Governor and the
trustees—the ﬁnal authority in the University. But the
faculty also is a public: they are the essential means to
the accomplishment of all of our missions. Above all,
the students are a public. They are the reason for the

Compared to the other sports, baseball had a good season. But
compared to past baseball teams, this year was disappointing. Only
by winning their last seven games did the mitters manage a
seemingly successful 16-9 record. After impressive Victories in
March over Kansas and UCLA in the Riverside (Calif.)
Invitational Baseball Tournament, the squad returned home to lose
to Grove City and Kent State. There were several bright spots
though: double-header wins over Syracuse and Penn State, and the
pitching of sophomore George Madich when he wasn’t practicing
football.

Jerry Richey, Ralph Cindrich, Mark Payne, Lloyd
Weston are all freshmen. But all are as well known as
the varsities, if not better known, to the Pitt fan.
There were numerous others, too, Bryant Salter,
Mike Caldwell, J. D. Lewis. The freshman athletes
were all the fans had last year. They were the hope
for the future. In most cases, the frosh didn’t let any-
body down. Even when the freshman football team-
heralded as the best group to ever enter the Univer-
sity—only completed a 1-3 season, the recruits were
still hailed as the saviours for Pitt football. On paper,
they were and are. Spring football practice was dom-
inated by the freshmen.

In the winter, the accomplishments of the frosh were
obscured by the announcement by Bob Timmons of
his retirement. But had the performances of the
freshman gymnasts been allowed, as they are
elsewhere in the country, the gymnastics season
would have been turned around. The freshmen
wrestlers made quite a name for themselves. Mark
Payne, Bob Kuhn, and Ralph Cindrich combined for
a 39-1 match record. But, the freshmen who created
the biggest stir of all were the track recruits,
especially distance runner Jerry Richey and jumper,

Bryant Salter. Richey, particularly, seemed to
draw fan attention. Over 1000 turned out to
see the ﬁrst home indoor track meet. Richey
and Salter hold better than a half-dozen
school records now. In May, Jerry broke the
four-minute mile—the ﬁrst Pitt runner ever to
do so. Salter became the ﬁrst track man ever
to win three events in the annual Quadrangu-
lar Meet. Richey also became a serious contend-
er for a place on the Olympic track squad.
Although the odds were against him, he
entered the 1500 meters and qualiﬁed for the
Olympic Trials. But, Richey only stands as a
symbol of the type of freshman athlete that
enrolled at Pitt last year. There are potential
All-Americans and there are potential NCAA
champions. All that’s left is to realize that
potential.

The University police are familiar
to students who have stayed in the
Student Union after hours or who
have parked illegally in the quad.
In the past year the force has been
increased by over twenty-ﬁve per-
cent. Their main responsibilities
are the security of University prop-
erty, parking regulations and the
ambulance service. Unlike many
college police forces, Pitt’s police
are not “rent-a-cops.” All of them
have had previous training and ex-
perience, usually

While on their beats, the University
police periodically report in to their
“base” located in Varsity Hall.
Each man on a beat carries a radio
receiver with him.

University police are responsible
for the regulation of parking on
University property. The ten dollar
fee for the return of cars towed
from the quad or Student Union

drive—way, pays for the rent of the
tow trucks.

with the Pittsburgh or Pennsylvania
State Police forces.

The University Police have a two-
fold job: to protect Oakland from
the students and the students from
Oakland. In the past year, the latter
has far outweighed the former.
Vandalism in the Student Union
and the Towers increased. Theft be-
came all too common. All of the
problems are not caused by the kids
in Oakland. It was most probably a
student who considered the Uni-
versity Police truck “community
property” and used it to drive from
the lower campus to Engineering
Hill.

existence of this place. I want my relationship with the
students to be a close as possible. My attention neces-
sarily is divided by all of these responsibilities but I
can’t begin to do my job adequately unless I have a
close sense of student attitudes, aspirations and needs.
OWL: The records of Pitt’s athletic teams has been
weak and unimpressive in the past few years. Do you
see any changes in the athletic program or do you have
any plans for resolving these problems?

POSVAR: Yes, I do. The major intercollegiate teams of
the University are in a phase of building, and building
in a healthy way, I think. We are developing a concept
here of good athletics with good academic abilities.
There are some athletes who can’t get admitted to Pitt.
If they did come here, they would not be able to pass
the program and that wouldn’t be fair to them. But we
are building our athletic teams and we do intend to
compete favorably on the national scene. I think you
will see a marked improvement in our football perfor-
mance next year. We also have improved hopes for
wrestling, swimming and basketball. One of the
brightest prospects is track. I would like to lay special
stress upon the role of student support in successful
athletic programs. A student who does not attend the
game has no right to criticize the performance of the
team. Student support shouldn’t wane when the team
is losing. During the past football season, our team was
badly defeated by certain great football powers, but I
didn’t see the players quit except at moments in one
or two of our worst games. I have never been associat-
ed with a school—even a school with winning records-
in which I have seen a team with greater persistence
and spirit than our young football team showed this
past year. They deserve all the support the students
can give them.

OWL: Many of the coaches put much of the blame on
the trimester system and shortness of time for a student
to be here. Therefore, they feel students do not want
to go out for sports. The coaches can’t get good
teams as a result. They also place the blame on the
high academic standards. They are trying to get them
lowered ofﬁcially or unoﬂicially through the admis-
sions oﬂice.

POSVAR: This is not what the coaches or the Director
of Athletics have told me. They are free to come here
at any time to express their points of view. I have heard

unqualiﬁed support for our academic standards from
our coaching staff and the coaches have told me they
want the standards to remain. I make this point em-
phatically. Lowering academic standards does not pro-
duce better athletic teams in football or in any sport.
We are talking about a few players a year who can’t
be admitted. It is possible to ﬁnd equally good players
who are good students; our coaches are doing this.
OWL: Why is the alumni endowment so small?
POSVAR: Let me correct a matter of terminology
here. No distinction has been made between the en-
dowment made by alumni and that made by other pri-
vate sources. The endowment of this University is ap-
proaching 90 million dollars. A major portion has been
contributed by Pittsburgh citizens who have had some
direct or indirect connection with the University.
However, it is generally recognized that the alumni
spirit and support have not been good. One of the vari-
ety of reasons for this is the rapid change that has taken
place in the University in the past two decades. We in-
tend to work hard to develop stronger alumni spirit.
The place to begin is with our future alumni, our
students.

OWL: The recent changes in the selective service sys-
tem will have a great impact on education. Does Pitt
plan to take a stand on the issue?

During the night, one
oﬁicer is stationed in the
Security Oﬁice to handle
incoming and outgoing

messages. From eight
o’clock in the morning
until late afternoon, one
of the two oﬂlce secre-
taries takes care of these
calls which come from the
radio truck or the men on
their beats.

The attitude of the Campus Police to-
ward the students differs greatly with
that of the City Police. The Charges of
police brutality after the “riot” in March
were a result of rash action on the part
of City Police which the Campus Police
protested as well as the students. The
Campus Police realize that students
form a community apart from the city
—one which must be handled with pa-
tience and discipline rather than dogs
and sticks.

Parking in the Student
Union driveway without a
permit or for more than
ﬁfteen minutes is not per-
mitted. If a truck is avail-
able, the car is towed, 
not, the lucky driver re-
ceives a warning.

Captain Ray heads the Cam-
pus Police force. He is a
quiet, eﬁﬁcient man who sees
the University and its stu-
dents as a unique community
requiring special approaches
in disciplinary police action.

In the past year, the Uni-
versity Police force has
increased by over twenty-
ﬁve percent to handle the
greater number of inci-
dents occurring on and
around campus.

KING

Martin Luther King,
Jr. was a Vulnerable
man. Several times
during his leadership
of the civil rights
movement, his life
had been threatened,
but on April 4, 1968
there was no warning,
just death. Those who
understood King
best, mourned and
marched peacefully
in his memory. Those
who understood his
message least, looted
and burned. The
shock which the
nation felt at his
death was mixed with
fear for both the
present and the
future.

The violent days that
followed King’s death
were ones during
which widespread
deﬁance of the law
was condoned to pre-
vent as much blood-
shed as possible.

It was not that the
riots were vicious.
They were more like
sprees. On the Hill
arsonists and looters
were tolerated by the
National Guard
troops which camved
in Pitt Stadium. A

7 P.M. curfew was
clamped on the city,
and each morning at
5 A.M. the tanks
rolled down Fifth
Avenue returning
from or going to their
stations. After a few
days, the physical
crisis was over and
the intellectual crisis
was just beginning to
unfold. The whole
community began to
realize how much
they depended on a
moderate like King
to keep the ﬁres

from their doorsteps.
While his inﬂuence
over the militant
blacks had been scant,
he left a position too
large for any other
moderate to ﬁll
adequately. The law
too was at stake. Were
store owners to pay
for the results allowed
by a restrained police
force, were arsonists
who burned city blocks
to be given immunity.
The whole foundation
of order and reason
which sustain a
community seemed to
be in the balance.

Before his death,
King had planned the
Poor People’s March
on Washington to
bring the realities

of poverty in America
before the unseeing
eyes of Congress.
King’s aides took over
the plans for the mas-
sive march. Caravans
were formed to trans-
port the marchers to
Washington. The
Mid-West Caravan
passed through Pitts-
burgh and was housed
in Pitt’s dormitories.
Most of the marchers
were young. There
were some militants
and many families.
They stayed at Pitt
several days and then
continued their march.
In Washington, the
Poor encountered
many problems. The
rain which fell for
almost a month created
a muddy and disease-
ridden Resurrection
City. Governing the
mass of marchers

was extremely diffi-
cult. As faras moving
Congress to action on
their behalf, the timing
of the Poor was off.
The Legislators were
wrestling with the
problem of cutting six
billion dollars from
the budget and they
were not in the position
at that time to grant
massive allocations

to the Poor.

POSVAR: By September, unforeseen circumstances
may alter the draft situation. We can speak only in
generalities now. There is an impasse between the
Congress and the White House over random selection
versus selection on the basis of age beginning with the
higher age groups. The latter would put the load on
graduate students and people with baccalaureate de-
grees. The military itself has said it would prefer a ran-
dom selection by year groups. If the White House sees
ﬁt to install this procedure, the blow to graduate pro-
grams would be alleviated considerably. If it doesn’t,
the blow would be heavy indeed. We have been told
that there is virtually no chance that the White House
will alter its policy of draﬁng the oldest ﬁrst. I feel that
this situation is bad for everyone. It is bad for the
armed forces; the draftees are older than they want.
It is bad for the public because the system is inequita-
ble. It is bad for higher education because it could
stunt graduate enrollment. I therefore hope it will be
bad politically for those who are to blame.

OWL: With all the occurrences at Columbia and Ber-
keley, do you think this massive student protest could
take place here? What would your stance be?
POSVAR: Let me answer this in general terms because
the character of student activism is rapidly changing.
First, Ibelieve that the phenomenon of large—scale stu-
dent interest in public affairs—the students’ desire to
inﬂuence policies that affect their lives as students and
citizens—is a healthy and encouraging contemporary
development. The present generation of students will
have to face awesome responsibilities when it assumes
command of society, and I have growing conﬁdence in
its ability to meet those responsibilities with honesty
and courage. Turning to the particular question of stu-
dent campus protests, I feel these protests have taken
such a variety of forms that it is difficult to make
sweeping conclusions. I can say this much: various
forms of public expression, protest, debate, demonstra-
tion and peaceful picketing are a normal part of the
scene in a free and open University. At the same time,
we must realize that physical obstruction of university
activities or interference with the right of others to
meet with persons of their choice or to study is not con-
sistent with the political values of western society. To
many, the “rule of law” may sound like a trite phrase,
but it happens to be the cornerstone of all the civil lib-

erties, minority rights, and democatic institutions that
have been carefully nurtured and developed through
3,000 years of human progress. The man who places his
own beliefs above the rule of law may or maynot be
right in his own moral sense, but he clears the way for
the advent of totalitarians who make precisely the
same argument as he does to justify their actions;
“What I do is right because it is what I believe.”
OWL: Is our involvement in the Civil Rights move-
ment as shown by our housing of the Poor Peoples
March indicative of a new turn in Pitt’s role in this na-
tional question?

POSVAR: Yes, but only as one simple illustration of
our concern with the needs of future society. Housing
the poor crusaders was a sincere gesture of good will
on our part. But it was only that—a gesture not an
answer. We are entering into a period of racial and
social disturbance in which the University, as an Amer-
ican institution, must play a leading and creative role
in seeking permanent solutions. The outcome is by no
means clear, but this nation has an opportunity during
the coming generation to be the ﬁrst in human history
to eliminate racial discord at its social, political, and
economic roots.

OWL: With a relatively low number of Negroes en-
rolled at Pitt, are you planning to try to increase this
ratio and what procedure will you use?

POSVAR: The contribution of the University must be
a two levels. One is a program, on which we are now
embarking, to correct the gross imbalance in enroll-
ment and employment of persons from racial minori-
ties. On the other level we must serve society at large
by attacking these problems at the frontiers of research
in the social sciences, the health professions, technolo-
gy, educational methodology, and economic and polit-
ical innovation.

The role for which the Chancellor is preparing the
University is an aggressive one. In the next ten to
twenty years, Pitt will, with good planning, be ex-
tremely involved in the social and intellectual prob-
lems of the society which surrounds it. Yet, circum-
stances will show how adept the Chancellor is at
directing a University which demands his talents not
only in long range planning, but also in the handling
of tomorrow and the next day.

administration, the President’s decision was a
boon. The McCarthy campaign gained greater
impetus, and the style and excitement of another
Kennedy campaign began to dominate the politi-
cal scene. The campaign was steeped in youth.
Politics was once again a respectable game. There
was confrontation with the issues and with the
people. Nixon’s character change hardly mat-

tered next to McCarthy’s candor and Kennedy’s
charisma. There was suddenly some hope for a
nation desperately seeking a leader. Then Ken-
nedy was dead. The Democratic delegates were
neatly pulled into the Humphrey camp by the
party organization. Both the Democratic and
Republican organizations appeared to be totally
removed from what the people obviously wanted.

The campaign had been taken to the people and
now it was being taken away from them. It is
difficult, in this year of political surprises, to state
in June what the national conventions will do
in August. However, it seems as if the choice
in November will be Nixon or Humphrey. Rocke-
feller’s late entry into the Republican race severely
damaged his chances for the nomination. The

polls in June indicate that he could beat Hum-
phrey. However, 1968 would not be the ﬁrst
time that the Republican Party has thrown away
an election because of their choice of a candi-
date, and the worse Nixon does in the polls,
the closer he seems to be to the nomination.
Once again, the political professionals choose.

 

In June, 1968, the prospects for the rest of the year
were less than bright. As students who became political-
ly aware under the administration of John Kennedy, we
expected reason, restraint and intelligence in govern-
ment. In the years after his death, we found what
seemed to be the opposite. This year we have worked
for Kennedy and McCarthy, candidates who epito-
mized what we believed. We have lost Kennedy and
have watched professional politicians take the conven-
tion delegates from McCarthy’s hands. Those of us who
care, have become disgusted. Our emotion is more
intense, our awareness more acute than the generations
immediately before ours. Our failing, perhaps, is our
vision of ourselves. If it holds up under the burden of
experience, of disappointment and disillusionment about
the possibility of change, we may succeed, we may
accomplish something. We now enter this period of
dealing with realities, not just ideals and generaliza-
tions, and we enter it mourning our dead heroes.

There are over 7000 faces at Pitt which belong to the
undergraduate students. There are many others
which belong to the administration and faculty. Some
of the faces are hated or scorned or admired or ig-
nored. Some should have pens which write under illu-
sions of grandeur, others are concerned with more
than their own importance. However, self-interest is
the key motivator of all thefaces. This self-interest is
usually generalized to include the interests of the or-
ganization to which the face belongs. The groups
tend to sterotype one another because forming imag-
es is easier than seeing realities. Thus, the path of
least consideration is taken. When the faces inter-
mingle, there is seldom any trust. The wise attempt
to understand their friends in the context of their
friends’ interest ultimately determines where the friend
stands be he a student or faculty member or adminis-
trator.

The Pitt Student comes in many forms. He
may appear in anything from a dirty, faded
army surplus jacket to a neatly pressed Brooks
Brothers suit. His outside appearance is often
deceptive, which is distrubing for those who
think in stereotypes. The beat, who sees
himself as a crusader of sorts, may actually be
among the most apathetic of students. The
supposedly “straight” individual may, in turn,
be the most involved. Usually the Pitt Student
falls between extremes. He is essentially
small group oriented. As a result the student
body is fragmented into organizations which

for Air Force service on land or in the air. Se-
niors may receive ﬂight training while other
cadets visit operational Air Force bases. The

R.O.T.C.

The two year Army Reserve Oﬂicer Training
Corps course is designed to give men practical
training in military science as well as an alter-
native to the one year physical ﬁtness require-
ment. After his second year, a cadet may elect
to continue in the advanced R.O.T.C. courses
for the remainder of his college career. Admis-
sion is highly competitive, based on physical
examinations and past performance in the
military ﬁeld. Upon completion of this four
year course a cadet is commissioned a second
lieutenant. In the weekly R.O.T.C. classes, the
cadets learn the basics of military theory and
its code of conduct. The military year is cli-
maxed by the annual awards ceremony and
the Military Ball, the only university-wide for-
mal event which is held at the Pittsburgh
Hilton.

Associated Women Students

At the first AWS spring workshop, students
planned programs for 1967-68. During the year,
AWS co-sponsored the Activities Fair, initiated
freshman women at Lantern ‘Night, and spon-
sored a lecture by a noted gynecologist. The elec-
tion procedures and the AWS Constitution and
By-laws were revised. A booklet was designed for
the woman student desiring to live off-campus.
The Scholastic Interests Committee co—ordinated
a tour guide service for the Hillman Library. The
Transfer Committee and Freshman Council were
also very active. Housing Board instituted more
liberal policies for dormitory residents. Judicial
Board reviewed student infractions of housing
rules and other related problems. AWS has been
a very effective organization.

All students in the School of Nursing are eligible for mem-
bership in the Basic Student Nurses’ Association. Its members
are also members of the National Student Nurses Association.
Monthly meetings are held with guest speakers in attendance.
Discussions concerning nursing specialities and current trends
in the profession take place at these meetings. BSNA is the
nursing school’s governing body and is the liaison between stu-
dents and faculty. It sponsors social functions, traditional cere-
monies and joins in the activities on campus. BSNA is re-
sponsible for Junior Black Banding and Senior Pinning in the
spring. It is the professional organization that prepares its
members for a vital role in the community.

Hillel

The B’nai B’rith Hillel Founda-
tion of the University of Pitts-
burgh sponsored a series of
discussions this year. Dr. Alan
Pollack, Dr. Myron Taube and
Glenn Miller were among the
featured speakers. Some of
the topics discussed were the
role of the Jew in Russia, civil
rights and the drug problem.
In addition to their discussions,
Hillel continued its popular
brunch program and the week-
ly Talmud and Torah lessons.
As in the past, Hillel provided
the opportunity for students
to worship together as well as
discuss relevant current issues.

 

Cheerleaders

An addition to the Cheerleaders’ squad which brought a
bit of interest to this year’s games was the baby panther.
The University’s aggressive new mascot was christened
Baghera. Coach Hart and the football team made ap-
pearances at pep rallies and the squad lead the cheers for
Pitt basketball games to boost spirit and attendance.
Cheerleaders are selected by a panel of judges from the
athletic department, faculty and squad captains on the
basis of ability, appearance and poise.

Engineering Cabinet

The Engineering Student Cabinet is the governing body
of all undergraduate engineering students in the Uni-
versity. Members are elected to the cabinet from each
class of the eight engineering departments. The cabinet’s
annual functions include Engineer’s Week, the Escitt
Scholarship Award, honoring the “Outstanding Senior”
in each department, and a bi-monthly publication. This
year the cabinet instituted a test-ﬁle system. The orga-
nization also continued a successful intramural athletic
program. The cabinet holds open meetings weekly. The
Dean of the School of Engineering holds regular meet-
ings with cabinet members. Faculty-student discussions
within departments are being planned. The Cabinet has
gained respect and an open ear from the faculty and
administration.

General alumni

The Alumni Association is the graduate’s
continuing link with his Ahna Mater. Be-
cause of the Association’s belief that ed-
ucation does not end with a degree, the
Alumni staﬂ‘ arranges for speakers at
meetings of the more than twenty Pitt
Clubs throughout the country. Continu-
ing Education Seminars on current topics
are held on campus twice each year.
Norman Saunders is Director of these
Alumni activities. Under the auspices of
the Alumni Schools Program, Alumni
throughout the country meet prospective
freshmen from their communities and
acquaint them with Pitt. Through the
Annual Giving Fund, graduates help fu-
ture generations of Pitt students by
ﬁnancing aid to the University. Harvy J.

can rarely cooperate with one another
successfully. On issues concerning national
and even student politics there is rarely a
direct confrontation of the dissident groups.
The Pitt Student usually comes from a middle
class family be it upper or lower. He is
confident in himself and his ideas whether
they are half-baked or not. He deals in
generalties without ampliﬁcation. In many
ways he is very much the product of modern
education. His attitude toward school is not
that of a loyal son to Alma Mater. He realizes
that his education is a means to what he

0
believes will be a successful end. He does not
identify with a class because he has none until
graduation day. He is on his own at Pitt, which
in many ways, is the redeeming fact about the

school. Whether he makes it or not is
practically his own doing. Despite the
fragmentation, and the isolation of groups,
there are many things that Pitt Students hold
in common: the images, the hangouts, the
tension. These things stem from the bond
that unites the student body—the fact that
they are all enrolled at Pitt.

The Pharmacy Interfraternity Council is the co-ordinat-
ing body of the ﬁve pharmaceutical societies in the
School of Pharmacy. These include three fraternities,
Kappa Psi, Phi Delta Chi and Alpha Beta Omega; one
sorority, Lamda Sigma; one honorary, Rho Chi. The IFC
correlates the activities of the various groups. The Coun-
cil consists of one delegate from each of the ﬁve orga-

nizations. In November, the IFC sponsors an open house
at the School of Pharmacy. Here, the pre-pharmacy stu-
dents are greeted by thefaculty and students and are ac-
quainted with the school. Over ﬁfty per—cent of the stu-
dents in the School are members of at least one of these
societies which foster professional attitudes and skills.

Liberal Arts Cabinet

The Liberal Arts Cabinet is the pri-
mary student organization concerned
with academic affairs in the college of
Arts and Sciences. Last year, its ﬁrst
active year the Cabinet was instru-
mental in obtaining a limited pass-fail
option for courses other than those in
a student’s major, minor and distribu-
tion requirements. The Cabinet’s sec-
ond year was even more productive.
The course evaluation was continued
and expanded to cover most distribu-
tion courses. Copies of the course
evaluation will soon be available on
reserve in the Hillman Library. The
Cabinet is also preparing a Course
Syllabus and test ﬁle for distribution
courses. This too will be placed in the
Library. The aim of these projects is
to make course selection easier and
more fruitful for the student. Further,
along these lines, the Cabinet, work-
ing with Student Government, was
able to convince the administration to
drop the $15 change of course fee. The
Cabinet is currently stud ing a pro-
gram to add to the ﬂexibilit and con-
tent of the undergraduate iberal arts
education. An inter—de artmental
studies program is rapid y nearing
completion and the language require-
ment, reviewed.

Men’s Council

“Innovation and restructure” describe
the activities of Men’s Council this past
year. Believing that the group must be
truly representative of all men if it is to
be effective, the Council has adopted a
completely new constitution. Under its
new organization, MC is composed of
delegates from the Men’s Dorm Council,
Commuter Association and Interfraterni-
ty Council. Further, the group has two
divisions. The Men’s Advisory Board is
responsible for programing beneﬁcial to
the male student body. The traditional
functions such as hosting Freshman or-
ientation, conducting Freshman Camp,
co-ordinating the activities fair and guid-
ing transfer students will be continued.
In addition, several new projects have
been devised: an upperclass advisor sys-
tem for Freshman males, a draft sym-
posium, and career conferences for Ju-
niors and Seniors. The second division of
MC is the Judicial Review Board that
reccommends action on misconduct
cases.

Men’s Dorm Council

Men’s Dorm Council is a representative
group of male dormitory residents who
debate and vote on all legislation per-
taining to the Towers’ residents. It adds
to the comfort and cultural life of the
University. MDC sponsors intramural
sports competition among the men in the
various houses and also sponsors TGIF
dances. This year, MDC again held
MDC weekend. The theme, “Soul”, was
reﬂected in the concert, dance and spe-
cial dinner. MDC continued to operate
the Towers’ laundry and dry-cleaning
service. It also gave interested students
the opportunity to attend seminars with
the University chaplains and debates
with Student Government candidates.

Heinz Chapel Choir

Heinz Chapel is one of the most beautiful sites on the
University’s campus. Twenty-nine years ago, when the
Chapel was built, the choir was to be the official singing
group for all services held there. The functions and activ-
ities of the Heinz Chapel Choir since that time have
widened signiﬁcantly. In the past, the Choir has sung at
Convocations and the. Chancellor’s Christmas Party in
addition to other University events. At one time, the
Choir sang at all Sunday morning services held in the
Chapel. Members also aid the Dean of Women’s Ofﬁce
with the Lantern Night ceremony each fall. The tours to
other campus usually are the most exciting part of the
year.

Men’s Glee Club

Men’s Glee Club, the oldest extracurricular organization at
the University, enjoyed a successful year under the direction
of Philip Cavanaugh, Glee Club camp was co—ed this year as
Women’s Choral joined the men for afternoon rehearsals.
The Glee Club’s tours began with concerts at Skidmore Col-
lege and Mercyhurst. Glee Club and Women’s Choral, ac-
companied by the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony, drew a
thousand people to their annual Winter Concert. The high-
light of the entire year was the annual invitational banquet
and concert. Skidmore College Chorus attended this year.
In March, the Glee Club performed at Pitt Preview, held its
annual election and awards dinner and traveled to Thiel
College for another concert with the Pittsburgh Youth
Symphony.

Student Government

Student Government was different this year. Its an-
nual responsibilities like Homecoming and Parent’s
Weekend, were run well. However, for the first time,
Student Government really went beyond these activi-
ties and concerned itself with the roblems that ad-
versely aﬂected the student body. T e controversy sur-
rounding the Book Center was acted upon ﬁrst. SG’s
concern led to a 10% discount on hard—cover text-
books, starting in the winter term. Difﬁculties in the
administration of the Student Union were also exam-
ined. The primary problem, still unsolved, was the
lack of sufficient otﬁce space for student organizations
and the arbitrary assignment of it without consulting
the organization involved. The Executive of SG acted
when informed that the change-of-course fee was to
be increased and assessed earlier than before. This ac-
tion led to it being pushed back in both terms to a later
date. SG’s oﬂ°-campus Housing Committee and
Freshmen Orientation Re—evaluation Committee
were innovated and did outstanding, diligent work.
The Executive of SG implemented a new Constitu-
tion. After years of reaction and talk, it was, at last, a
year of action.

Student Union Board

SUB functioned within the framework of a remod-
eled Union. Many board activities were inﬂuenced
byJthe atmosphere of innovation. Early in the year
S B sponsored a concert with Nipsey Russell and
the Rooftop Singers. Twice the Hunt Room was con-
verted into The Pit, a coﬂ”ee house opened for the
enjoyment of students. Grant Robbin and Gamble
Rogers were guest entertainers. The Public Affairs
series attracted speakers from a variety of ﬁelds
ranging from foreign policy to current trends in the
arts. Lecturers included Senator Hugh Scott and au-
thors Felix Greene and Art Buchwald. Andy
Warhol presented an excerpt from his day—long ﬁlm,
“Starts”. Additional speakers were attorney Melvin
Belli and J. Kenneth Galbraith. SUB presented a
series of Soviet Seminars featurin ﬁlms and lectur-
er Zbigniew Brzezinski. COTA ﬁ ms included such
movies as “The Red Balloon”, “Sundays and Cybel—
le” and “Seance on a Wet Afternoon”. Among
weekend ﬂicks were “Cat Bal1ou”, “The Pawn’Brok-
er”, “The L-shaped Room” and “Ship of Fools”.
Other endeavors of SUB included Ski Day, preced-
ed by a ski-wear fashion show and the Ping-Pong
tournament.

Pitt Ski Club

“Wait for the sn0w——then we’re ready to go” is a familiar
quote from any Pitt Ski Club member. One of the fastest
growing organizations on campus, it doubled its mem-
bership this year and received its first allocation from the
University. With the ski conditions being good this winter,
the club made numerous ski trips. Taking advantage of the
extra week of vacation at Christmas, 14 members enjoyed a
week of excellent skiing at Killington, Vt. During the winter
trimester, the club sponsored several Saturday trips to the
local areas and co—sponsored the Pitt Ski Day at Laurel
Mountain. For their annual week-end trip, club members
enjoyed two days of skiing at Holiday Valley in New York
early in March. Guest speakers and ski movies at the regu-
lar meetings through the school year, provide the members
with an entertaining and educational means of increasing
their knowledge of this very popular winter sport.

Quo Vadis

The members of Quo Vadis are
the student hostesses of the 18
Nationality Rooms and the Heinz
Chapel. When conducting tours
through the rooms, the irls pre-
sent a brief cultural an histori-
cal sketch of the room and the
country it represents. Members
of Quo Vadis are also called upon
to be hostesses at many Univer-
sity events. Each December,
members assist the Nationality
Room Committees in decorating
the rooms for the holidays ac-
cording to the particular folk
‘customs of the country.

William Pitt
Debate Union

The William Pitt Debate Union
participates in approximately
thirty-ﬁve debate tournaments at
schools such as Harvard and Van-
derbilt. In addition, the Debate
Union hosts visiting colleges and
high schools for three tourna-
ments on the Pitt Campus. Last
year, WPDU placed third in the
nation at the National Debate
Tournament. Pitt has qualiﬁed for
the nationals in ﬁve of the last ten
years. The group also holds ap-
proximately 40 assemblies for lo-
cal high school audiences,joining
this year with King’s College, Col-
orado and Michigan State to
bring outstanding debates to local
students. Pitt teams debated this
year in both Canada and the West
Indies and hosted, for the elev-
enth year, two debaters from
Jamaica. The Union also holds
parliamentary debates during the
year

Beta chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, national service fraternity, en-  01116 a
joyed another successful year. The brothers of APO adhered to  g

high principles of leadership, friendship and service in all their
activities. During the fall, their time and energy was spent pre-
paring a ﬂoat for the Homecoming Queen and her court. They
also sponsored a “Sink the Middies” weekend featuring a dance
and concert by Woody Herman. In the winter, the fraternity
sponsored the annual Ugly Man on Campus contest which pro-
vides funds for several worthwhile charities.

To most students, the OWL is simply a catalogue of
faces, their own and their friends: It contains pictures
of Homecoming and Greek Week and all the other
special events of the year. To the staﬂ" which gives up
its weekends and nights to produce the book, it is
more than a place to ﬁnd a picture. Rather, it is a test
of how to differentiate one year at Pitt from the others,
of how to delve deeper than the veneer of football
games and pep rallies to discover what made 1968
unique at Pitt. Learning the skills necessary to put the
book together takes time, patience and imagination. In
the end, the staff hopes that the limb they went out on
was a strong one.

The Pitt News

Throughout the year, the Pitt News has provided cover-
age for campus events. However, this was also a year of
transition to the journalistic use of the ballot box and the
newspaper supplement. In December, after many ar-
duous months of ﬁnancial insecurity, the Pitt News de-
cided to print a front page editorial stressing the need for
students to protest to the Governor about the state’s
ﬁnancial insecurity and this institution’s subsequent ﬁscal
plight. Front page ballots were made available to stu-
dents and after one day approximately 200 ballots were
counted and forwarded to the Governor. But this was
also the year of the supplement. The Pitt News published
two impressive supplements that made the national wire
services and received much acclaim. The supplement con-
cerning campus morality was widely publicized. The Ne-
gro supplement had great relevance in the confusion of
today’s society. In short, this was a year of great progress
for the Pitt News—a year that laid the basic foundation
for the future of the newspaper.

Ideas and Figures

164

In 1959, Ideas and Figures, the literary magazine at the
University of Pittsburgh, began its search for student
creativity. In its efforts to establish itself, the magazine
has become the vehicle by which the students may have
their artistic ideas published. Every issue contains an as-
sortment of the short stories, poetry, essays, photography,
and artwork of the student literati on campus. Although
the creativity is not as spontaneous as once hoped for,
Ideas and Figures continues in its quest for the recogni-
tion of hidden talent at the University.

The Skyscraper Engineer is the olﬁcial publication of the
School of Engineering. It has a base of ﬁfty four pages an
issue with a circulation of a thousand and a readership
drawn from the entire University community. Various
changes were made in the magazine this year. The staff
did not adhere strictly to its ﬁfty four page base. Color
was used both on outside and inner portions of the publi-
cation. The coverage of the magazine was greatly in-
creased to include articles such as: research at Pitt, con-
struction in and around Pittsburgh, alumni events, com-
ics, and a technicutie chosen from among Pitt’s coeds.

These innovations have been well received by Skyscraper
readers. Students are beginning to realize that the maga-
zine contains information of interest to those outside as
well as in the Engineering Community. The results of
these changes were evidenced by an increase in the circu-
lation and greater student interest in the publication.
Next year even more innovations are being planned. The
staff wants to make better use of color and new methods
of design. Better coverage of professional engineering
news and wider campus circulation are the goals of the
1968-69 Skyscraper Engineer staff.

The Pitt capsule

The Pitt Capsule, the oﬁicial magazine of the
School of Pharmacy, is published three times
each year. As a professional journal it supple-
ments the in-class training of pharmacy stu-
dents by presenting a wide variety of articles
concerning research and development in drugs
as well as reports from pharmaceutical con-
ventions. The magazine also offers national
drug companies the opportunity to advertise
their products and employment opportunities.
In addition, The Pitt Capsule devotes special
attention to the developments being made
here at Pitt and to the news, class activities
and the special programs that are offered
within our excellent School of Pharmacy.

Polaris

The Polaris is perhaps the most
scrutinized publication at the Uni-
versity during the ﬁrst few weeks of
classes. In addition to bearing the
pictures of incoming freshmen, the
Polaris contains thousands of facts
concerning the campus organiza-
tions and activities. A daily cal-
endar section is included. The staff
spends long summer hours orga-
nizing the elements of the hand-
book into a valuable research tool
for those who may be new to the
University community.

WPGH

This year, WPGH, the student-operated
radio station of the University continued
to be the ﬁrst one on the scene where the
action was. They very adeptly kept the
students aware of what was happening
during the second annual spring riot.
The station also sent out questionnaires
to the student body asking which pro-
grams they liked best and listened to the
most. Free pens were given to all inter-
ested students who returned the ques-
tionnaires. WPGH continued its 24 hours
a day, seven days a week service. They
also reported national and international
news through the UPI wire service.

Oﬂice of
Student Publications

The fourth ﬂoor of Schenley Hall is
the focal point of student publications
at the University of Pittsburgh. It
houses publications with a wide spec—
trum of professional and social inter-
ests who share the common problems
of deadlines and high school clinics.
The atmosphere is alive with discus-
sions ranging from politics to the lat-
est Techni—cutie. Late at night, be-
tween classes or well in to the week-
end, staffs are found typing copy,
checking proofs and proofreading.
The Director of Student Publications
is responsible for guiding these publi-
cations toward honest and responsible
journalism and helping with problems
as they arise. The Office of Student
Publications is also the coordinator of
the various clinics throughout the
year.

Delta Tau Delta

The year l967~68 marked another year of
progress for Delta Tau Delta. Numbering
over 90 members, the fraternity partici-
pated in various activities and organizations
this year. The brothers spent most of the
summer improving the physical appearance
of their house. A tutoring service was su -
ported by the alumni to aid brothers see -
mg academic help. During the fall and win-
ter term, the chapter listened to several
speakers from academic, civic and milita
circles. Delta Tau Delta won the Spirit
Award Trophy this year. Brothers were ac-
tive in the lanning of Greek Week and
Freshman amp. Members served as
oﬂicers in the Young Republicans and IFC.
Many were active in intramural s orts. So-
cially the Delts functions range from a
Bowery Brawl to Winter Weekend. The
brothers of Delta Tau Delta are looking
forward to another successful year.

Delta Sigs had a year of growth and development which saw the
initiation of two good pledge classes and the redecoration of the
fraternity house both inside and out. In the fall, all the brothers
and pledges got together to paint the outside of the house. The ex-
perience proved to be fun as well as constructive and everyone
enjoyed himself as the Delta Sigs rediscovered that working to-
gether provides the basis for the brotherhood upon which frater-
nities are built. Redecoration on the inside of the house included
the acquisition of new carpeting and furniture for the ﬁrst ﬂoor,
Well-rounded gentlemen of high moral character capable of scho-
lastic excellence and social success, participation in University
and community affairs, and leadership on campus are traditional
aims of the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. In accordance with these
aims, the Delta Sigs made ﬁne showings at Homecoming, Greek
Week and intramurals. There is a Delta Sig on practically every
varsity athletic team, several belong to honorary fraternities, and
several served in positions of leadership at Greek Week and
Homecoming. An annual party for blind children and a dinner
introducing Chancellor Posvar to the Greek system were sponsored
by the Delta Sigs last year.

190

This past year was the first full year that Kappa Sigma has been afﬁliated with a
national organization. Before last year, the chapter was the local Delta Iota Delta.
As such, 1967-68 was an extremely busy year for the chapter. This year, the
brothers moved into a new house on Neville Avenue which was the ﬁfth house on
fraternity row. Brothers again participated actively in the IFC intramural sports
program and many other campus activities. The enthusiasm of the brothers to-
ward their fraternity has given the chapter a ﬁrm basis upon which to build.

As their picture illustrates, 1968 proved to bring “achievement” and
merriment to Phi Epsilon Pi. Starting with fall rush and terminating
with their winter weekend, the past school year brought many mem-
ories upon which they can look back fondly. The All-Sports Tro-
phy, symbolic of athletic supremacy among all fraternities was
awarded to Phi Ep this year. Their “Bowery Affair” (with the authen-
tic hobo) made the brotherhood feel right at home.

192

The year 1967-68 was a period of growth for Phi Gamma Delta
at Pitt, Pi Sigma was the recipient of the Omicron Graduation
Cup for the best chapter in its national section; and the
Condon Cup, signifying its position as the most improved chap-
ter in Phi Gamma Delta. Extensive remodeling and moderni-
zation have made their house the finest on campus. Topping
off a successful, competitive rush, Fiji embarked on a year of
marked gains. Community service was increased featuring the
“Fiji-Rally” to raise money for the Western Pennsylvania
School for the Blind, as well as co—sponsoring a party for un-
derprivileged children. Increased emphasis was placed on in-
tramural sports, attested to by the number of trophies awarded
the chapter. Campus activity was highlighted with Fijis en-
joying responsibilities in everything from Homecoming to
Greek Week. With an increased growth in their membership,
with a renewed dedication to their goals, next year, as this
year, will be a success.

year. Brothers participated in the IFC
intramural sports program and won
ﬁrst place in bowling and a second
place in billiards. During Greek Week,
Phi Kaps donated more funds to the
Children’s Hospital charity drive than
any other fraternity. Brothers also
contributed blood to the Central
Blood Bank during Greek Week. An
unusual project this year, was the pi-
nochle championship sponsored by the
American Playing Cards Company.
Phi Kaps now hold the championship
as brothers played pinochle for 48
hours and 5 minutes. The money was
donated to Children’s Hospital. The
fraternity is looking forward to anoth-

as one of the oustanding groups on the campus. They
were represented in almost every area of University activ-
ities such as, the Pill News, the Polaris, Druids, ODK, the
Order of Omega and Student Government. One brother
was elected President of the Interfraternity Council.
Scholarship was also very important and the Pi Lams
were second among all fraternity men with high overall
averages. A wide variety of social events kept their spirits
high during the year. Pi Lam won ﬁrst place in the intra-
mural softball competition. For the second year in a row
the fraternity won ﬁrst place in Greek Sing, and second

place in the overall Greek Week competition. As this,

year ends, the brothers of Pi Lambda Phi are looking for-
ward to even more successful achievements next year.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Sigma Alpha Epsilon has always encouraged its members
to participate in extracurricular and academic activities.
Brothers have been active in organizations ranging from
the William Pitt Debate Union to Student Government.
Omicron Delta Kappa, Druids and Sigma Tau are a few of
the honoraries to which brothers belong. This year, two
brothers were tapped to Phi Beta Kappa. A well planned so-
cial calendar provides a necessary balance between work
and relaxation for a very successful chapter. The members
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon are looking forward to a contin-
uation of the ﬁne reputation they have built on Pitt’s
campus.

Sigma Alpha Mu

The brothers of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity
carried out many varied programs this year.
They participated in the ALSAC Drive and
the “Bounce for Beats” project. In the latter,
brothers bounced green basketballs for 27 con-
secutive hours to raise funds for the Pittsburgh
Heart Association. In addition to their philan-
thropic projects, Sammy’s placed second in
Homecoming and third in Greek Sing. Broth-
ers also had the highest scholastic average of
all fraternities on campus. Sammy’s were very
active as individuals on campus. Brothers held
chairmanships in Greek Week and were mem-
bers of Student Government, Liberal Arts
Cabinet, various publications and ODK.

This past year was one ﬁlled
with many diverse activities
for the brothers of Theta Chi.
In intramural sports, Theta
Chi won ﬁrsts in swimming
and wrestling and a third in
basketball. Theta Chi also won
the poster competition for
Greek Week. Last year, broth-
ers held a Stanton C. Craw-
ford Memorial Dinner to
honor a person who had dis-
tinguished himself in his ser-
vice to the University. Gwilym
A. Price was honored in 1967.
This year, at the second annual
dinner, David Kurtzman was
the recipient of the award.
Theta Chi is the only under-
graduate organization to spon-
sor such a project.

Beta Phi chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity is one of the
most active groups on campus. Its members have distin-
guished themselves in many campus organizations.
Zeeb’s are Editor of the Pitt News and President of Stu-

dent Government. A Zeeb was also named Mr. Pitt. A
well-rounded program of social. athletic and scholastic
activity form the basis of an excellent chapter.

Panhellenic

Panhellenic Council is the coordinating and gov-
erning body for fraternity women at Pitt. The Council
strives to maintain a high caliber of sorority life, to
promote successful inter-fraternity relationships, to
further sound scholarship and to cooperate with the
University administration and other organizations in
matters related to sorority activities. Mutual ideas and
problems are discussed in the meetings with the hope
that new insight will bring new ideas. This fall,
Panhellenic co-sponsored a dinner with Inter-Frater-
nity Council which brought collegiates, alumnae and
members of the University administration together to
welcome the new Chancellor. During the winter term,
the social calendar was highlighted by a theater
party honoring pledges and by Greek Week which
is co-sponsored with the Inter—Fraternity Council.
Panhel offers a basis for a uniﬁed Greek System.

The sisters of Alpha Delta Pi were again very much a part of campus life
this year. Participation began with Homecoming in the fall term followed
by our hay ride. Our ﬁnal social event of the term was a festive Christmas
Party. A formal dinner dance at Le Mont was our way of ushering in the
New Year. Highlights of the winter term were our ﬁrst place Student
Government Spirit Award and second place honors in Greek Week. We
concluded the year in April with our annual Founders’ Day luncheon at
StouIfer’s.

Chi Omega

The year 1967-68 was a fun-ﬁlled and ac-
tive one for Chi Omega. The fall term be-
gan with a sorority over—night which helped
to set the high spirits that lasted throughout
the year. The excitement mounted with sev-
en new pledges, and a Homecoming Queen
ﬁnalist. A hayride at South Park also added
to the fun. The winter term was highlighted
by Ski Weekend held at Laurel Mountain.
At Greek Week, Chi Omega won the Char-
ity Trophy. In activities around campus,
Chi O’s were very active. One sister was
elected President of Omicron Sigma Rho,
the Panhellenic honora , and another was
President of Holland all. Chi Omega’s
special service project for the year was the
adoption of a child throu h Children Inc.
The child is a resident of ppalachia.

Delta Delta Delta

The sisters of Delta Delta Delta complement
each other with a variety of talents and inter-
ests—touring in Mexico, preparing for a
dental career, conducting seminars for selected
freshmen, singing with Heinz Chapel Choir,
painting with a master’s touch, or just making
others happy. Third in scholastic standing, Tri
Deltas realize that education is all encompass-
ing. Therefore, one can ﬁnd a member of Tri
Delta in every phase of campus activity as
well as honorary societies. Almost half of the
sisters were given recognition for leadership,
scholarship and service, and within the past
two years, six sisters were named to the Owl
Hall of Fame. Tri Deltas also take their place
in the Greek World with members serving as
President of Panhellenic and co-chairman of
Greek Sing. On the social scene, a sister was
Sweetheart of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, while six
sisters were Little Sisters of Minerva. Enthusi-
asm is widespread. It is hoped that the spirit
and athletic ability exhibited during the Fun
Night activities will continue. Then, there is

‘pumpkin caroling, overnites, the Christmas Par-

ty, Winter Formal and the Tri Delta Man of
the Year. The joys of sisterhood come alive in
Delta Delta Delta.

The sisters of Alpha Epsilon Phi have channelled the widest
variety of talents and interests into a dynamic force which
has been felt in every part of the University and in the Pitts-
burgh community. In school activities, one of the sisters was
Homecoming Queen Chairman and another was Greek
Week Publicity Chairman. Academically, sisters have been
members of the Thyrsa Amos Society and Cwens. Serving
and performing, A E Phi’s are part of Orchesis, Quo Vadis
and the girls’ gymnastic team. Within the group, they have
strengthened ties with their parents by sharing a weekend
with them at school and forming a parents’ club. Their
unique banners and second place Homecoming trophy are
external displays of the spirit the sisters feel within for A E
Phi.

The sisters of Delta Phi Epsilon returned to school in
September ﬁlled with high expectations for their sec-
ond year on campus and their first year in the new
suite. Socially, culturally, and intellectually the sisters
sought to develop a better understanding of the Uni-
versity and Pittsburgh commuonities. Highlighting
the social calendar was the dinner dance at the Park
Schenley. Delta Phi Epsilon sponsored lectures and

discussion with professors and initiated a scholarship
award program among the girls. Community service
was not neglected as they went “trick or treating” for
UNICEF and made toys for Children’s Hospital. Sis-
ters were very active in many campus organizations.
Through these and other activities, the sisters have
matured individually and as a group.

Delta Zeta spirit is multiplied by each of its
members. During the past year, our time has
been divided by activities, good times, and friend-
ships. "It was evident DZ represented itself
throughout the University—winning the Home-
coming Trophy began a year of successes.The
sorority, however, extended its outside interests
as well. Our philanthropy program included col-
lecting toys and preparing visual aids for the
Pittsburgh Hearing and Speech Society. Mem-
bership does not begin with initiation; it is a dis-
tinction which is earned. The valuable experi-
ences of sorority association are those which aid
a young woman to grow, which broaden her
scope. Only by being an individual can she be
proud to consider herself a Delta Zeta. Smiles
plus laughter plus sharing equal the happiness
that comes so naturally in DZ. There are no
subtractions.

Kappa Alpha Theta

The sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta have
had an active and exciting year. Begin-
ning with a successful Fall Rush, the ﬁrst
term was highlighted by our Homecoming
Queen ﬁnalist and our annual theatre
party and supper. As the year progressed
and we were joined by another wonderful
pledge class, our schedule was a busy one
including a party for the School for the
Blind, Founders Day and the Panhellenic
Ball. The winter term ended happily with
a successful Greek Sing, a Theta Greek
Week Queen and our annual dinner—dance
in honor of our graduating seniors.

Individuality and chapter unity are the keys to Kappa
Kappa Gamma. These attributes seem quite opposite,
and yet, when held in a proper balance, they provide
strength, spirit and friendship. Each Kappa gives of her-
self, not as a loss to a stereotyped image, but as a deﬁnite
gain to a sharing whole. This individual giving to the love-
liness that is Kappa has led to personal, campus and
community suocesses. Homecoming was a very special
highlight of the year as a Kappa was named Home-
coming Queen. Activities throughout the year ranged
from “adopting” a poor family during Christmas to the
Annual Spring Kappa—Delt Reception for faculty and ad-
ministrators. The Kappas were especially proud that their
sisters were the Chairmen of Parents Weekend and
Greek Week, as well as the Captain of the cheerleaders.
Certainly the beauty and strength behind Kappa’s indi-
viduality and unity shines like the Kappa key each sister
wears.

It was a busy and fun-ﬁlled year for the sisters of Phi
Sigma Sigma. Though group activities such as, infor-
mal Sunday morning brunches in the suite, a philan-
thropy project at the School for the Blind and a semi-
formal aﬂair at the LeMont were a large part of Phi
Sig, many functions were co-sponsored with other
groups on campus. These included a fall picnic, an
annual Scholarship Dessert and several programs with

faculty speakers. In order to extend the scope of sis-
terhood, Phi Sig welcomed the parents and families
of sisters and pledges as guests at their annual dinner-
dance and brunch during Parents Weekend. Being
active in campus groups such as, Student Govern-
ment, Housing Board and various honoraries did not
prevent the sisters of Phi Sig from attaining the sec-
ond place scholarship rating among sororities.

Sigma Delta Tau

220

The sisters of Sigma Delta Tau have learned the true mean-
ing of sorority through the many activities held throughout
the year. Many sisters hold positions of leadership in
Cwens, dorm council and AWS. Sorority life gave the girls
the opportunity to strengthen the bonds of friendship,
whether building a ﬂoat for the Homecoming celebration or
collecting money for UNICEF. Social activities included a
theater party at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, a semi-formal
dinner dance at the Edge and several fraternity mixers.

The Regional Campus

In 1962, the University decided that part of its in-
herent responsibility as an academic institution was
to extend its educational leadership into natural re-
gions neighboring the central campus. The necessity
of offering the ﬁrst two years of higher education to
an expanded student population was obvious and
the most effective means to meet this need was the
regional campus. In recent years, the scope of inter-
est and inﬂuence of the University has gone far be-
yond the Cathedral of Learning to include uni-
versities in Asia, Africa and South America; thus, it
was only natural the boundaries of the University
should also encompass neighboring communities in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania itself.

It was felt that the ideal setting for the two year in-
stitution was in the relaxed atmosphere of a small
urban community surrounded by suﬂicient land on
to which the campuses could expand. Yet, while the
campuses are geographically separated, from Oak-
land, they are still an integral part of the academic
community of the University. The President of the
Regional Campus is responsible to the Provost for
maintenance of student calibre equal to that which
is maintained at Oakland. The campuses at Brad-
ford, Greensburg, Johnstown and Titusville offer
the ﬁrst two years of undergraduate education in
the departments of the College of Arts and Sciences
and the School of Engineering. Beside the full-time
students enrolled, part—time students take courses
through the School of General Studies. Graduate
programs in Library Science and Education are also
offered at the campuses.

Compared to the eighteen decades of history of the
Oakland Campus, the regional campuses are indeed
infant institutions. But with a will to grown and un-
paralleled community support, each year the re-
gional campuses have expanded the role they play
in the larger University community.

Bradford

The Bradford campus offers local and
out—of—state students the pleasant atmo-
sphere of a small college before they are
assimilated into the urban Oakland cam-
pus. The Bradford branch, just six years
old, is working to become an integral
part of the community by offering
evening and part—time courses in degree
and non—degree programs to Bradford
residents. In addition, the campus is
undergoing a program aimed at rapid
expansion of its physical plan.

J ohnstown

When the campus of the University of Pitts-
burgh at Johnstown was established in 1927, the
enrollment was one hundred and ﬁfty. Today,
that enrollment has increased to over one thou-
sand students from Pennsylvania and sur-
rounding states. Johnstown’s new eight million
dollar campus has added a new dimension to the
educational system there. The expansion ro-
gram began in 1965, under the direction 0 Dr.
Theodore W. Biddle. The new buildings are the
ultimate in advanced design and excellence. The
new campus was dedicated this year by General
Eisenhower. The campus has numerous social
and extracurricular activities including sorori-
ties and fraternities. Most student activities are
centered in the Student Union and the physical
education building. After four to six trimesters, a
student can transfer to the Oakland campus or
another school.

229

The Greensburg Campus of the University was
established to provide a basic two year under-
graduate program to students of Fayette,
Westmoreland and surrounding counties. Lo-
cated thirty miles from the main campus in Oak-
land, thevregional campus has the small school
atmosphere which many students prefer. After
four terms at Greensburg, students can transfer
to the College of Liberal Arts or School of Engi-
neering on the Oakland campus or any other
four-year campus. The campus has many extra-
curricular and social activities such as debate,
intramurals, athletics, concerts and lectures. The
new campus was in partial use in 1967. Although
the two campuses are two and one-half miles
apart, about one third of the classes are held in
Lynch Hall in the new campus. Plans for future
expansion include new dorms.

Playing touch football on the
Cathedral lawn, sitting alone on a
park bench, or taking a long
aimless walk are means to relax, to
stray from puzzling questions

or courses. To some students
relaxation comes, paradoxically,
in being constantly involved in
something, be it politics,
publications, or dorm hallway
debates. To others, relaxation is
escaping into a magazine or a
vigorous workout in the gym.
Each student ﬁnds his own way
to relax and steals the time to do
it.

As Dean of Men, Mr. Herbert McGibbeny looked at the University with
a dilferent point of View than he did as a teacher here. His office worked
in coordination with the men’s organizations and advised a number of
other activities, such as WPGH, Circle K, and Phi Eta Sigma. Also un-
der the Dean’s direction were the Studies—Activities Program and Emer-
gency Loan Fund. Students consider him an able administrator as well as
a source of ideas and personal guidance.

Miss Sauina Skewis, the
Dean of Women has a strong
belief in student responsi-
bility. She has worked close-
ly with the women students
in liberalizing hours and
housing restrictions. The
Mentor and Senior Assis-
tant Programs are directed
by her ofﬁce, as well as Pan-
Hellenic Activities. The host-
essing organization for Heinz
Chapel and the Nationality
Rooms is another of the
groups for which she is re-
sponsible. Students consider
Miss Skewis a friend and
advisor as well as a dynamic
person.

Dr. Jack Critchﬁeld as Dean of Students
was busy coordinating the intricate aspects
of student life. It was a challenging posi-
tion during the early years of state-related-
ness. Although his basic objective remained
providing a student affairs program in the
best interest of the students, his increased
communication with various student groups
brought an awareness of student diversity
to the Administration.

Dguntnsn

In the course of his college career at Pitt,
a student may receive instruction from as
many as thirty-ﬁve diﬂerent members of the
faculty. Some of these professors will not

be remarkable. Memory of them and their
courses will slip into oblivion. Others will
always be remembered, for they are able to
provide the type of academic stimulation
today’s students are insisting upon. Their
interest and concern for students is not

limited to the classroom. Their professional

and teaching capabilities are outstanding.

They are the Great Professors.

With the growing concern for quality education
on the part of students, parents and educators,
many debates have arisen concerning the axiom
“publish or perish.” Following are the thoughts
of this year’s Great Professors concerning the
axiom and the manner in which it aﬂects their
teaching and professional responsibilities.

“ ‘Publish or perish’ is
actually a false issue, or

at best, a misleading slogan.
I believe that there is a
correlation between teaching
and research. Any university
must seek to promote both.
Original research can and
should constantly stimulate
more creative teaching.
Although one does not auto-
matically follow the other,

it is a logical corollary.
Eﬂective and productive
research projects can only
enhance the potential
teaching ability of the
faculty. The ideal university
should allow the faculty to
concentrate in those areas
where they can perform most
eﬂectively. The real dan-
ger comes only when an over-
simpliﬁed approach is taken
toward evaluating eﬂective-
ness as productivity.”

“Although some professors and most administrators maintain that the
publish or perish rule is no longer an issue, I feel it remains a
dominant feature of academic life at Pitt. To my knowledge, rep-
utation as an outstanding teacher has never caused a scientist

to be sought and hired by a major college or university. No matter
what academicians say, most still follow the practice of recognition
on the basis of publications. It is most discouraging that such
recognition is a quantitative rather than a qualitative matter.”

“The policy ‘publish or perish’ leads to avoidance of teaching in

order to devote more time to research, selection of research projects

which lend themselves to a rapid publication rate, and a ‘publication
explosion.’ Most of us have been guilty of publishing before we really’

have anything deﬁnitive to say. The life science literature could

be cut in half all papers with the word ‘preliminary’ in the title

were eliminated. It is no accident that many ‘well known’ biologists

conduct experiments on an organism with a generation time of 20 minutes.”

Kenneth W. Cummins
Associate Professor
Biology

“The slogan ‘publish or perish’ has come to
stand for much that is competitive and stifling
about the modern university; it is attacked by
students, teachers and administrators of
creative mind, as well as by incompetents who
fear the competition. It is usually cited

in the context of the plaint that ‘teaching is
losing out.’ Like all slogans this one, too,
distorts the issue. The university teacher

must guide his students to membership in the
community of intellectuals. He must live in
this community, participate in the work of
scholarship, humbly subject himself to its
harsh standards  he is to be a useful guide.
To ‘perish’ in this community means to lose the

239

vital commitment to the values of intellectual
li e. It is as possible to ‘publish and perish’
in this sense, as it is possible to ‘teach and
perish.’ Thus, the issue is not ‘publishing
versus teaching,’ as it often is made out to
be. The goal of the university is to realize
the values of the academic lif , to create

a community of the mind between students,
teachers and scholars of the world. The
enemies are incompetence and localism, mech-
anistic bureaucracy, narrowness and special
interest factionalism. Scholars, students

and faculty alike, must ﬁght these dragons
wherever they raise their heads, in the
‘system’ or within oneself. ”

Burkart Holzner
Professor, Sociology

“My duties at Pitt have consisted
primarily of teaching and advis-
ing. Several years ago, I did

not envision myself doing either
of these things, but I have
found that I enjoy both positions
immensely. Teaching enables me
to utilize and convey knowledge
in the ﬁeld of academic psy-
chology. In my role as an
advisor to psychology majors

I attempt to use my back-
ground so that the welfare of
the individual student may be in-
creased. A major goal is to ﬁt

a program to the student’s needs
and abilities so that he will
attain a well-rounded education
as well as a speciﬁc degree.

The advisor is often the only
real contact a student can have at
a school of this size. In these
times of extreme pressure, a
strong system of advisement is
crucial.”

Anthony L. Tilmans
Assistant Professor, Engineering

“In order for a university
to be strong internally, it
is essential that the
faculty be involved with
students in activities and

needs outside the classroom.

This involvement may per-
tain to such activities as
student government, social
organizations, publications,
honoraries and traditioal
student campus events.
Faculty support may range
from organization advisors
to judges for a single
campus event. Regardless
of the capacity, the faculty
member sets examples of
good professional conduct
and guidance. Involvement
with students requires much
time and eﬂort, but the
rewards to the university
community are great.”

“In general, the axiom ‘publish or perish’ need not be ap-
plied to the professors themselves, but instead, to the
department, school, and eventually to the entire Univer-

sity as it is these that suﬂer for the lack of publications.
Research, with its ensuing publications, is one of the
methods by which fame and recognition are brought about and
without which, we go into obscurity. As for teaching the
basic fundamentals to the undergraduates, research or
publications may not change any of these concepts but will
keep us aware of advancements as well as enable us to give
some insight into the subject material. These new ideas can
be put to use in graduate teaching and may also give a new
outlook on personal research being conducted as well as cre-
ating new projects. Publishing should not be undertaken
for the sole purpose of publishing, but should be of a

nature to be beneﬁcial to both teaching and professional
responsibilities. ”

Arts and Sciences

This year the School of Liberal Arts changed its
name to the College of Arts and Sciences. The new
epithet is a symbol of the innovation and reorgani-
zation processes started by Chancellor Posvar in an
attempt to update this division of the University.
The curriculum, with its three major categories of
study; natural sciences, social sciences and humani-
ties, affects the greatest number of undergraduate
students. In an eﬂbrt to expand and improve the
College, Dean Kehl and his associates are studying
various ways of eliminating confusion and in-
creasing efficiency in areas such as the Advising
Center and the Oﬂice of the Registrar. In addition,
the Liberal Arts Cabinet is trying to help frustrated
students choose suitable distribution of studies
courses by publishing course evaluations of the bas-
ic 80’s and l80’s courses available.

243
244
Dentistry

In the modern dental clinic, which was opened for use
this fall, third and fourth year dental students learn
the intricacies of their chosen profession. After two
years of pre-clinical instruction, they begin actual pa-
tient work. Upon completion of four years they are
awarded the Doctor of Dental Medicine degree. As the
name of the degree indicates, dentists are no longer
limited to ﬁlling and pulling teeth, but they are more
on par with medical doctors. They too can specialize.
This can be seen in the large numbers of students who
plan to continue their training and become orthodon-
tists and oral surgeons.

245

246

Education

The School of Education is divided into separate areas of study:
Elementary, Secondary, Business and Physical Education. Ed-
ucation majors enter the School as juniors after two years of a
regular liberal arts program. After placing emphasis on courses
in his ﬁeld, the student begins student teaching. In one term of
the senior year, the students enter the classroom and tranform
theory into practice. Through a concentrated education pro-
gram, the student is adequately able to prepare for a teaching
career. Upon graduation he or she is recommended for certi-
ﬁcation. For the past three years the School of Education has
enabled holders of a Liberal Arts Bachelor Degree to obtain a
Masters Degree in Education through the M.A.T. program. A
participant in the program retains the ﬂexibility of a liberal
arts program while student teaching and obtaining education
credits during the three terms of the Masters Program.

247

The life of the engineering student centers around the
hill. Here he may specialize in one of eight technical
ﬁelds of study: civil, electrical, chemical, mechanical, in-
dustrial, metallurgical, mining, or petroleum engineering.
His program of study has been expanded to more thor-
oughly prepare him for a career upon graduation. Late in
the autumn of 1968, the Michael L. Benedum Hall of En-
gineering is expected to open. This facility will provide
an inspiring atmosphere in which the future engineer
may attend seminars and laboratory sessions and learn
theories and formulas. The building will feature a mod-
ern engineering library, seminar rooms and an audito-
rium which will be made available to professional engi-
neering groups. The University has sought to rid itself of
technical decadence. The academic orientation of the en-
gineer has been reaffirmed. In the new surroundings of
Benedum Hall it is certain that men and women can
ready themselves for roles of leadership in the ﬁeld of en-
gineering in their communities.

Nursing
Proud Pitt nursing students boast that the bac-
calaureate program of the School of Nursing
is one of the top ten in -the country. While the
School of Nursing has its own very qualiﬁed
instructors, it shares part of the teaching staff
of the University’s Medical School. Gradu-
ating seniors who have completed the three
year program have gone through a grueling
nine terms of education. They have ﬁnished
three terms of Liberal Arts requirements,
which served to round out their education,
and six more rigorous terms of genuine nurse’s
training. The students have worked with affili-
ated hospitals such as, Magee, Children’s and
Veteran’s Administration. They have complet-
ed courses in the Fundamentals of Nursing,
Medical Surgery Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pub-
lic Health Nursing Psychiatric Nursing, and
Pediatrics at some of the best hospitals in the
area. The University’s nursing students would
probably agree that the strenuous three years
of training have given them a justifiable con-
ﬁdence in their ability to be leaders in their
honored profession.

251

 

Pharmacy

The Pharmacy program at Pitt is ﬁve years
long. The ﬁrst four terms are spent acquiring a
liberal arts education. The last six terms are
intense studies of the profession of pharma-
chology. The pharmacy student learns not
only skills essential to the practice of pharma~
cy, preparation of drugs and medicines, but
also gains an understanding of the principles
involved so that he can provide pharmaceuti-
cal services to the community and interpret
new data. The goal of the School of Pharmacy
is to aid the student in developing his partic-
ular interest—administration, research, actual
practice or teaching. In this way the student is
better prepared to make a selection upon
graduation. Extracurricular activities are tied
in with the profession, through the pharmacy
fraternities, honorary, Pitt Capsule and the
Pharmacy Cabinet.

ODK
Man of the Year

The highest leadership honor attainable
by a senior man is that of Omicron Delta
Kappa Man of the Year. The awardee
for 1968 was Michael Bryson. Mr. Bry-
son was a mathematics major and was
second in scholastic standing in his class.
He served on the Student Government
Allocations Committee and was director
of publicity for that organization. He ed-
ited the Student Directory in 1966. In
1967 he was named Junior Worthy and
received the M.M. Culver Award for
outstanding achievement in mathema-
tics. Mr. Bryson was a member of ODK
and, during his junior year, was tapped
to Phi Beta Kappa. He was also Presi-
dent of Sigma Chi. His name will be in-
scribed on the Senior Walk leading from
the Cathedral to Heinz Chapel. On the
walk are these words: “On this walk
ODK honors those persons who through
intelligent leadership, personal integrity
and intellectual honesty have served
their University well.”

256

Randi Hurwitz and Jay Rosenstein were named the
most outstanding members of the senior class this year
by a committee of junior men and women. Miss Hur-
witz was President of Mortar Board, Secretary of the
William Pitt Debate Union and Vice-president of
Panhellenic. She was a Senior Representative of AWS
and editor of the 1968 AWS Handbook. She was a Se-
nior Assistant and Mentor and a member of Delta Zeta
Sorority. Mr. Rosenstein was a member of ODK and
Zeta Beta Tau. He was the Pi Delta Epsilon Represen-
tative to the Student Publications Board and Sports
Editor of the Pitt News. He was also a member of the
University Review Board.

Owl
Hall of
Fame

Education at Pitt is not limited to the classroom. It is also the participa-
tion in a University communit which is as diverse as the peo le who
compose it. Each year the OW HALL OF FAME recognizes t ose se-

nior men and women who have made the greatest contribution to this’

community. Students are chosen from every area of campus activity,
from publications to athletics. Selection is made by a committee of ju-
nior class leaders who themselves represent the broadest areas of stu-
dent life. While scholarship is a factor, it is not emphasized. The impor-
tant criteria is not how many organizations the senior has been a mem-
ber of, but how worthwhile his contributions have been.

Junior Worthies

Each year, fourteen junior men and
women are named Junior Wor-
thies. These students are out-
standing members of their class and
have demonstrated their leadership
abilities in many organizations on
campus. The selection of Junior
Worthies is done by a committee of
senior men and women who have
themselves received the honor.

Graduation is a time of mixed feelings. There is a cer-
tain smugness associated with the successful completion
of a college education. At the same time, there is a
subtle anxiety about the future. The cliches of the
administration in conferring the degrees, set the ceremony
apart from the reality of the past 21/2 to 4 years. For the
first and last time, the graduates are gathered together
as one body. Many students do not attend their gradua-
tion ceremony. They are working or too far away to
come or too busy to attend a ceremony so long after
the fact.

Every Editor would like to put the book together
himself. Even if you begin working with the prem-
ise that the entire stall should learn from the expe-
rience, you end by hoarding as much work for your-
self as possible. When you are forced, because of
time to share the work, you become irritable and
impatient. It is to the staﬂ members who put up
with your impatience and idiosyncrasies throughout
the year, who were enthusiastic about the new con-
cepts, who went out on the limb with you, that the
greatest credit goes. And so it is with me. The peo-
ple who took chances, who brought new concepts,
who worked long hours to make this book a reality
are the ones to whom I owe special thanks: Bruce,
for his frankness and support, neither of which faul-
tered during the year; Earl, who, having gone
through the editor syndrome himself, offered me
good advice——for his patience when he realized it
was falling on very stubborn, sometimes deaf ears;
Tom, Bob, Ross, Martin, Bob and the rest of the
photography staff who were always willing to take
last minute assignments and whose sense of humor
made them a great group to work with; Carole,
Nancy, Sue and Becky who took care of the many
details and arrangements which came up
throughout the year; Mary, for her work with the
literary staﬂ“; Jane, who did double duty, working
on both the Business and Editorial staffs; Roy and
Mike for the fine sports copy; Ivan, John and Ar-
mand for their contributions; George for his timely
art work; and David for managing a successful busi-
ness staﬁ.

To Larry Pirnie, I owe a very special thanks. His
encouragement and help in giving the book more
substance and dimension were greatly appreciated.
I would also like to thank Mr. Bud Harris for help-
ing us with the sorority and fraternity shots, and
Mrs. Esther Kitzes for being there to help when
problems arose.

I hope that Bruce and the 1969 stall will ﬁnd their
year with the OWL to be as exciting and fulﬁlling
as I found mine to be. Good luck. Thank you all
again.

March is really the culmination
of a year at Pitt. The volumes
of papers assigned during the
year are due then. The petty
frustrations of dreary winter
days and equally dreary pro-
fessors have mounted. Everyone,
in short, is ready for a free-
for-all which has been dubbed
“riot” by the Pittsburgh Po-
lice. After March, ﬁnals quick-
ly pass, and the students depart.

Who did kill Student Government?
And How? And why?

Was it the Administration

whose misunderstanding and
disinterest created barriers

to eﬂ”ective communication?

Was it their paternalism which
emasculated Student Government?
Was it the Student Government
itself which was so involved

in the back-stabbing of petty

THE—

politics, that it ﬁnally and
inevitably stabbed its own
back? Was it the student body,
so concerned with their indi-
vidual interests, so easily
satisﬁed with mediocrity,

that rather than attempt to
realize their power, stood

back and watched it dissolve?
Was it all of us who were
responsible for having a sham
rather than a senate? Did

we allow a few to make our
decisions without giving them
a substantial indication of
what direction we wanted them
to take? Did our criticism

and condemnation of their
actions destroy all hope of

a positive basis for student
power in Student Government?
If the answer to any of these
questions is “yes,” then we
must ask, who were the victims.
In the past three years, the
Administration has spent most
of its energies dealing with

the ﬁnancial crisis and
maintaining the internal sta-
bility of the University. The
Administration was aware of
the necessity.of change and

of planning with the student
in mind. Yet, student demands

'32

V , V! ,, '*
V‘ ;';*~:3_.,.»..~,~«a ,5;-_- «,, k W.-5.4 ’ ’_ - 7,

  autumn-rm gnu I-‘:4--V} 3

34
for change, because they were
unplanned and unsupported,
were not heard. Thus, the
Administrati0ns’s ability to
effectively assess student
demands in their planning was
inhibited.

Certainly, the Administration
was not the only victim. The
knife that killed Student
Government wounded the entire
study body. Students who

once hoped that “this year
would be different” could not
awaken that hope in themselves
this year. Students who once
looked to SG for uniﬁed action
on their behalf and with their
cooperation turned away this
year. SG has survived in

name only, escaping abolition
by a slight margin.

The inability of any SG in the
past two years to express and
promote student interests and
coordinate student activities
has effectively deprived the
student body of its right to a
strong centralized voice. And
this year, for the ﬁrst time
since Eric Stern’s dramatic
resignation from ofﬁce, the
student body was forced into
the realization that it had

no powerful spokesman, that SG
is impotent and that student
power at Pitt is only an empty
phrase.

In the great web of mediocrity
and misunderstanding at Pitt,
Student Government has been the
victim as surely as it has been

the villain. The Administration
vacillates between excessive

35

~ 
N
paternalism and obvious ignor-
ance of student affairs and
concerns, making SG’s task

of expressing and working to
realize student desires an
almost insurmountable one.
The Book Center discount issue
was a glaring example of this.
A committee of administrators
and students thoroughly inves-
tigated the feasibility of
instituting an across-the-

board discount for students.
They submitted their report
and recommendation that the
discount be instituted in
September, 1967. The response

of the Administration was that

it was impossible to begin the
discount in September because
the ﬁscal year had already
begun. Certainly the admin-
istrative ﬁnancial advisors

who sat on the committee
were aware of this. Why
weren’t the students told?
Instead of being able to in-
vestigate the problem and make
an effective recommendation
acceptable to students and
administrators, the students
who worked on the committee
were patronized and frustrated.
In addition to such difficulties

36

with the Administration, the
study body, on the whole,

has been quicker to criticize
than to cooperate with SG.
Thus, many executive and senate
hopes and programs have gone
without result.

The effect of the attitudes of
the Administration and the
student body have been slight
when compared to the damage
SG has done to itself.

When SG fell apart in the fall
of 1965, a group of individuals
sprang up who thought that
government could only be ef-
fective if it was carefully

controlled. Progress and leg-
islation were subordinated to
clique-like cohesion. The

result was mediocrity. The
group quickly grew in power,
the machine was set in motion
and mediocrity was perpetuated.
Candidates were brought into
line or dropped. Individuals
were thwarted in their attempts
to ﬁght the machine. The

senate soon became a sham with
only a few frustrated and

angry faces in its midst. SG

did this to itself. Having

chosen mediocrity, it lessened

«m «u 3-(«uncut

‘''k‘‘'''«‘'‘VS‘'''!

"‘

its chances for effectiveness

and alienated itself from the
student body. This alienation
was painfully evident when
one-half of the students who
voted on the referendum issue
concerning SG’s afﬁliation

with the National Students’
Association indicated that

they “did not have sulﬁcient
knowledge to judge” whether or
not Pitt should join. SG was

no longer student government
rather, it was small group
dynamics where individuals were

manipulated and ideas controlled.

38

What has been the result of
this type of government? An
appeased Administration, an
unaware and powerless student
body and a non-student, non-
government. With this long
tradition of ineffectiveness,
petty power politics, and
acceptance of mediocrity, what
will be the role of SG in the
future? The new executive and
senate must choose to continue
in the direction of previous
administrations or to move
toward the student body, to-
ward its needs and desires.

39

SG must choose whether or not
to represent the student body
adequately. While it is up to
SG to take the ﬁrst step, it

is no longer suﬂicient for

the rest of us to sit back and
watch what happens. The re-
sponsibility for an effective
student government belongs to
the student body and the Admin-
istration as well as to the
executive and senate. It is
essential that a concerted

effort be made by a responsible
press, Administration and
student body if student govern-
ment at Pitt is ever to be
brought back to life.

In January of 1968, after a year’s delay, Hill-
man Library ﬁnally opened. For students
and faculty accustomed to the dust, dirt and
noise of the Cathedral Library, it was almost
impossible to believe. Whereas the books in
the Cathedral were hidden in the dingy
closed stacks of the fourth ﬂoor and the dun-
geon-like open stacks of the ground ﬂoor, all
the books and periodicals are openly avail-
able in the Hillman library. There are new ta-
bles and chairs, study and graduate carrols
and faculty studies. The new gold carpeting
not only buﬂ"ers the noise, but also provides a
comfortable place to study for those who
ﬁnd the tables and carrols too crowded.
Many couples discovered that it was a con-
venient alternative to the sofas and chairs of

44

the Student Union lounge. The startling
white of Hillman contrasts sharply with the
bleak stone walls of the Cathedral and for
once one did not have to bring a ﬂashlight to
avoid eye strain while reading. There is a
place for everything in the Hillman—a micro-
ﬁlm room, typing rooms and seminar rooms.
It is a simple one-step procedure now to get
a periodical as they are all on the shelves.
And it is clean and warm in the Hillman. No
dust, no dirt, no drafts as there were in the
Cathedral. There is quiet, the wind does not
screech around the corners, heels do not
click against a stone ﬂoor and people have
begun to whisper as if they are actually in
a library.

Student activism on campus has been a reality since
the fall of 1964. The war in Viet Nam was as disgust-
ing a situation during the presidential campaign of
1964 as it is now in 1968. Pitt Students for Johnson-
Humphrey was a response to Goldwater’s challenge
from the right. Three hundred students canvassed
for the “peace ticket” of 1964. Their support for the
ticket ceased within the next year with Johnson’s es-
calation of the war. Activism also manifested itself
in campus affairs. In the winter of 1965, Student
Government was challenged by a coalition of stu-
dents who called themselves the Pitt Progressive Par-
ty (PPP). Their platform demanded student control

48

          

    
 

Wsbnnal‘ lg"? ‘'95!’ ,
‘%’o‘*'”'°""  

6:‘:  ;

over student interests. Eric Stern, the PPP presiden-
tial candidate, was elected and soon confronted the
administration over the issue of the allocation of the
ﬁve dollar student activities fee. Realizing that he
did not have adequate support in the senate for his
stand, Stern resigned. The PPP remained active in
student politics for the next three years, and many
of its members participated in the protest move-
ments. A week after the events in Selma, Alabama
in the spring of 1965, 125 students traveled to
Montgomery to demonstrate their support of SNCC
and SCLC voting rights projects.

On the long ride south, the students had little idea
that their peaceful demonstration the next day
would be ruthlessly attacked by a posse swinging
clubs. The Hearld Tribune, when reporting the situa-
tion, stated that “the Alabama posse has again
shown us better than any words why there is such a
need for the passage of the Voters’ rights bill NOW.”
During the next three years, Students for Peace
(SFP) grew steadily in activity as the war was con-
tinually escalated. The purpose of the movement
was to express collective disgust over the effect of
the war on American society and foreign policy. In

  

1966 and 1967 there were two large teach-ins, each
attended by over 1,000 students. SFP conducted for-
ums on the war and foreign policy, sessions on the
draft and worked with other city peace groups in or-
ganizing “Speak Out Against the War” in the fall of
1966 and the “Angry Arts VS the War” in the spring
of 1967. SFP also supported the massive demonstra-
tions in Washington in 1967 and New York in 1966.
During these years, there were many other programs
established. The Hill Education project linked
hundreds of Pitt students with grade and high school
students in the Hill.

This tutoring program has often brought frustration
and despair to the tutee and tutor. However, the tu-
tee’s contact with a college student who taught him
that his math or French mattered has an impact
which is difficult to immediately access. In 1968,
there have been several demonstrations. One was
against the presence of Dow Chemical on campus,
with counter pickets marching also. There was great
concern about Pitt’s secret research for the military
and how the University is to maintain its own integ-
rity. Students formed Pitt Students for McCarthy
and Kennedy in the spring of 1968. The aim of the
students was to bring the war into the political are-
na. Underneath the label of “protesters,” the
hundreds who actively demonstrated against the

war, reﬂected the disgust of vast numbers of stu-
dents; the hundreds who tutored in HEP reﬂected
the concern of most students who watched our coun-
try approach civil war in its cities; those who partici-
pated in student politics reﬂected the concern of
many as to the manner in which the University was
responding to and meeting its obligations in this pe-
riod of social crisis. Maybe all of this did not matter,
and yet, negotiations are taking place in Paris;
Lindsey’s and Kennedy’s and Gardner’s are trying
to cajole white America into meeting its obligations
and pay its reparations for a genocide equal to
none. Most important, many felt that it simply had
to be done, that we, as students, had to stand clear
and loudly say “No” to a barbaric war, “No” to our
governments lopsided priorities, “No” to the grow-
ing white racism and “No” to our University’s type
of involvement. It was for these purposes that we
marched, that we traveled, that we contested elec-
tions for Student Government and national govern-
ment, that we devoted our energies and resources.

 

 

 

By this time it’s become an open secret that there
are drugs on this campus. However, amid the ru-
mors of LSD. STP. speed. Grass. and assorted other
goodies, the whole issue has become clouded. Given
the present Federal laws providing strict penalities
for the use of almost all of the known hallucinogens
(the so—called psychedelic drugs). most people are na-
turally reluctant to discuss the matter. assuming that
anyone with the gall to ask is either extremely stupid
or a Federal agent. Perhaps the most important fact
is that drugs are not confined to just one type of stu-
dent. Most adults commonly believe that only the
long haired. unkempt student is involved with drugs:
they would be surprised to ﬁnd that some drugs.
particularly marijuana. are more common among
the “straighter“ circles than anywhere else. While
marijuana is the most common, other drugs are also
found in these supposed “straight“ circles. Amphe-
tamines. used as diet pills and as stimulants. produce

 

  

 

 

 

a euphoric feeling when taken in slightly greater
quantities than is recommended. Given the fact that
A. as amphetamines are called. is a prescription
drug. it a pears with some regularity. Other drugs,
particular y LSD and STP. the true psychedelics, are
available but expensive. Most usage is, like the
smoking of pot, merely a substitute for other forms
of stimulation or excitement. The feeling marijauna
produces is one of calm and drowsiness; one does
not feel sociopathic or suicidal as some public ser-
vants would have us believe. As to the actual experi-
ence of smoking, grass burns hot and tastes bad.

The University of Pittsburgh of the Commonwealth
System of Higher Education is composed of approxi-
mately 7000 undergraduate students, fourteen aca-
demic and professional schools, four regional cam-
puses and an undisclosed number of computers. Cur-
rently the University is embarking on a period of ex-
pansion not only of its physical facilities, but also its
participation in ﬁnding solutions to today’s social

roblems. The ﬁrst impression of Pitt a student forms
is from the brochures and catalogues he receives be-
fore he enters. The expanse of lawn seems endless.
When he arrives, he ﬁnd that the endless expanse is
actually one patch of grass photographed from several
angles. This IS the ﬁrst time that the student realizes
what he is told Pitt is and what he sees it as being are
two diﬂerent things.

Soul was the beat

Speakers
and
Enter-
tainment

 
 
 

74

When one thinks of the Speakers and
Entertainers who came to Pitt this past
year, two startling facts are quite appar-
ent. First, one has only to list some of
the speakers and it seems like a listing
from Who’s Who. The year began with
General Hershey clarifying the then new
developments in the draft. Later came
noted columnist and Washington critic
Art Buchwald, popart advocate Andy
Warhol, The New York Times’ Harrison
Salisbury, and others. Highlighting the
Winter Term was the Pitt Union’s Soviet
Foreign Policy Seminar, which featured
Zbigniew Brzezinski of the Institute on
Communist Affairs at Columbia
University.

75

Wesley W. Posvar, Rhodes Scholar and
former Chairman of the Social

Sciences Division of the Air Force Academy,
was named Chancellor

of the University of Pittsburgh June 1, 1967,

He was interviewed by the
OWL March 15, 1968. His opinions and
views concerning the University are as follows.

Secondly, as ﬁrst rate as the
speakers were, as second rate was
the professional entertainment. In
this area, the Union’s ﬁrst attempt
included an excellent performance
by Nipsy Russell and a less than
mediocre one by the Roof Top
Singers. Throughout the year Var-
ious things added to the lack of
good entertainment here. Some of
the top names in the performing
ﬁeld cancelled out on Pitt. Then
again when someone was booked,
poor acoustics and faculty micro-
scopes always seemed to plague
the shows. The few bright spots
that occurred happened in The
Pit, the Union Coffeehouse where
professional and amateur folk sin-
gers entertained the students, and
in the University Theatre, where
the Pitt Players produced some of
the ﬁnest full length and one act
plays seen anywhere in Pittsburgh.

Oakland caters to transients. The apart-

streets are for students who pass through

in four years. The concert halls, museum
and private clubs attract people who are

in Oakland for the evening. The bars and
restaurants are numerous and their prices
fluctuate in accordance with home or away
Pirates and Steelers games. Cars and buses
ﬁll the streets during rush hours. The
crowds which seeth through Oakland heading
for Pitt Stadium or Forbes Field park their
cars in the front and back yards of Oakland
for the price of one dollar.

The boys who sell newspapers
and shine shoes and beg dimes
from passers—by abound in Oak-
land. After school, they form
clusters on the sidewalks.
Usually, a ﬁst—ﬁght develops.

At night, they drag their pa-
pers through the Towers wearing
grimy faces and torn clothes.

Students form a large part of 0akland’s population. They rarely ven-
ture further than Forbes and Fifth Avenues or their apartments or fra-
ternity houses. To them, Oakland is Pitt. They seldom recognize the
fact that Oakland is also old men who spend long days peering into
shop windows.

ONE LOSS AFTER ANOTHE

Losin has become the way of life in Pitt
athletics. The fan brave enough to climb
Cardiac Hill, be it under the warm sun of
a September football afternoon or in the
sleeting rain of a March basketball evening,
soon becomes conditioned to the losing
phenomenon. All sports seem to be caught
in the downward whirlpool, and most are
having a tough time escaping it. The
losing atmosphere hinders recruiting, an
essential part of a successful program,

thus creating almost cyclical stagnation.

     

If most of those in the Field House seem,
if not content with losing, at least able

to compromise to it, there are a few new
faces who are successfully ﬁghting the
trend. Dave Hart has football at east

partially on the road back while wrestling
coach Dave Adams and track mentor Jim
Banner are making signiﬁcant progress.
However, even their eﬂ°orts are impeded by
outdated athletic policies.

The student body, displeased by the losing
phenomenon, seemingly had no way to express

its frustration. Then a means through which
they could reveal that frustration appeared.
With the backing of an overwhelming majority
of the student leaders on campus, a petition
on athletics was presented to the Chancellor.
It called for a rational program whereby
athletics standards could be improved with-
out any imposition on academic quality. Now
under study, the petition offers some hope
for the future. Presently, the key word is

still “losing.” Ty ical of the current state

of athletics was ootball.

OWL: During the ten years Edward Litchﬁeld was
Chancellor of the University, he had a plan of what he
wanted it to become. Do you have a plan and, if so,
what is it?

POSVAR: We have been working on a master plan for
the entire University. I think it will be the first com-
prehensive plan involving large scale participation
that has developed in the history of the University. Dr.
Litchﬁeld’s goals were very commendable; now, we
must embark on a similar period of growth. However,
we are currently in a period of more competitive re-
sources. Because of this, we must make our plans in
greater detail and must have more widespread faculty
support. Since the quality of our faculty is more out-
standing today than it has ever been, its support and in-
volvement will be stronger and more valuable than be-
fore. This faculty is capable of bringing the institution
to greatness. The master plan will be based, first, upon
discussions of the style, goals and character of the Uni-
versity. We have asked the faculties of the schools to
consider what the nature of each discipline or ﬁeld
should be in the next twenty years and how we can an-
ticipate these developments at Pitt. We shall stress
quality. We do not plan to add a number of new pro-
grams or schools because we already have an adequate
range of academic activities. Rather, we plan to con-
solidate our superior programs and strengthen our
weaker ones. Quantitatively, our growth will respond
to the needs of Pennsylvania and our society. Numeri-
cally, I’d say this will be approximately ﬁfty percent in
the next dozen years. At another level, we have
worked with architects to develop a master physical
plan for the campus which will set forth our environ-
mental needs for the next ten to twenty years. At yet
another level, we have taken up a study of resource
management. We intend to set up a long range plan-
ning and programming—budgeting system comparable
to those adopted by federal government agencies dur-
ing the past ten years. We also want to develop a com-
plete management information system that will store
data, help to schedule classes and instructors, record
registration payments and so on. We hope that these
systems will enable us to provide more efficient and
economical service to everyone. Of paramount impor-
tance in our planning is student affairs. We want to
avoid what might be called the “Berkeley syndrome”

3%

—the sense of frustration and loss of identity which
occurs in a bee—hive social environment. We want to
establish learning—teaching—living units. These sub-
divisions of the undergraduate programs will provide a
more healthy environment for learning and will give
the students a tighter sense of belonging and loyalty.
Fraternities achieve something of the same purpose
now. Dr. Critchﬁeld’s staff is already at work; some-
time within the coming months, the results of these
studies will emerge and will be incorporated into the
master plan.

OWL: Will students be involved in this planning in the
coming months?

POSVAR: Yes. We particularly need student ideas
and counsel in the areas that most affect them: student
life and curriculum. Some students already are in-

The season opened on
a warm, sunshine-
ﬁlled afternoon, but
the glow didn’t last
long for Panther
fans. An awesome
UCLA team ran over
the gridders en-

route to a 40-8 vic-
tory. The long Pitt
TD drive was engi-
neered by sophomore
Frankie Gustine.

The ﬁrst road game
was a disastrous one.
After missing some
golden scoring op-
portunities in the
ﬁrst half the
gridders were routed
by the Illini in

the second, 35-6.

Anemic was the only
word for the Pitt
oﬂense against West
Virginia. They re-
peatedlﬁ surrendered
l

the ba deep in

their own territory.
Although a determined
defense kept WVU
from crossing the

goal line, ﬁve ﬁeld
goals added up to

a 15-0 defeat.

The Panthers came out
on top in the battle

of the winless, as
senior QB Bob Bazylak
came o the bench

to lea a second

half rally. His pre-
cision passes to Bob
Longo and Joe McCain
set up both TD’s.

The Badgers threatened
late in the game, but
the Panthers won, 13-9.

Coming oﬂ of their
ﬁrst win, Pitt play-

ed its worst game as
Miami trounced the
gridders 58-0. It

was a game that made
Dave Hart wonder 
there was any hope

left.

Hart got his answer
against the Middies.
Tailback Gary Cramer
led the Panthers to

a I4--0 lead but

Navy fought back and
won 22-21 on a ﬁeld
goal with three min-
utes left. A stand-

ing ovation from the
student section was
the Panthers only
tangible reward.

One heartbreak fol-
lowed another for the
gridders, as they

0st to Syracuse on

a fourth quarter punt
return. Before that
run, the Panthers
seemed on their way
to victory as they
completely stymied the
Orange attack.

There was no heart-
break against the
Irish. Notre Dame
poured it on and the
Panthers were never
in the game. The
ﬁnal score of 38-0
told the whole story.

87

The third close de-
feat handed the Pan-
thers came in the
same manner as the
first two—in the
four quarter—as
Army scored twice to
gain a 21-12 victory
and send 20,000 fans
home muttering about
the ways of Lady
Luck.

3&5»

In many ways, the
last game resembled
the season opener.

A Gator Bowl bound
Penn State team had
little trouble in
swarming all over
the Panthers.

For the seniors on
the squad, it meant
ending their careers
with 5 wins and 25
losses.

88
On a sweltering afternoon in
early August, coach Dave Hart
assembled his young, green
squad for pre-season workouts
at lush, green Allegheny College.
After two weeks of two-a-day
drills, Hart was bubbling with
the optimism that accompanies
all fall camps. But, each time
Hart became too enthusiastic,

he remembered the schedule and
the optimism quickly tempered.
“We’ll be 100% improved,” Hart
announced. “Of course, that may
mean we’ll only lose 20-0 and
not 40-0.” Then camp broke,
and Hart and his 59 man squad
left the quiet tranquility that
was Meadville for that awesome
schedule. The season soon over-
took Hart’s early optimism with
the stark reality of defeats,
making his early statement seem
prophetic. The Panthers were
improved on the ﬁeld, but not
in the win column.

90
Football started the losing
cycle in athletics, but it

was not the only rider. A
phantom offensive attack was
the primary reason for the
booter’s 2-7-2 mark. They
scored only eight goals in
eleven games. “You can’t
win if you don’t put the ball
in the net,” said coach Leo
Bemis, “and we didn’t put
the ball in the net.” The
lack of scoring took much
of the lustre away from a
ﬁne defense. However, the
phantom attack was not the
only problem faced by the
booters. Once again they
sulfered from the faction-
alism and petty disputes
that have characterized

Pitt soccer under Bemis.

In every dark cloud, they say, there is a
silver lining. The cross-country team
provided the one bright spot last fall

by registering a winning season. But,
almost ﬁttingly, considering the mode of
Pitt athletics in general, the runners

92

operated out in the distant hills, far

removed from the campus, and unburdened by
either spectators or publicity. With a ﬁne
freshman team coming up, coach Jim Banner
should be putting together more winners

from among his lonely long-distance runners.

93

The Panthers suffered through
their fourth consecutive losing
basketball season in relative
anonimity, before the sparse
crowds that have become a Pitt
tradition. The hearlded sopho-
mores who were supposed to make
the team a winner failed to do

so, just as the heralded sophs

of the year before had failed.
The one highlight of the season
came early, when the cagers
stunned highly-rated Temple,
81-63, but the team could never
again match that performance.
The cagers had many weak points
but the most signiﬁcant was a
lack of rebounding. Pitt cen-

ters were invisible men anywhere
around the boards. It was not

94

uncommon for the opposition
to get ﬁve shots on one play,
although, against the Panthers’
defense, they rarely needed
more than one. The cagers’
collapsing zone succeeded only
in part—it collapsed, but

it didn’t zone.

At one point, the team played
so badly that bored fans

proceeded to set a new Field
House record by peppering the
ﬂoor with two dead eels.

That broke the old record of

one ﬂounder that was set

last year. Even dead, some
fans argued that the eels
displayed more life than the
Panthers, who ﬁnally ﬁnished
up 7-15.
