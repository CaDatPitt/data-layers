                   Allegheny, Pa.
    "Lofty and sour to those that lov'd him not;
    But to those that sought him, sweet as summer."
    "Tom," the first of the Trinity, is one of those
rare individuals, for whom admiration grows with acquaintanceship. A student in the true sense of the
word, with some crazy notions which he forces no one
to accept. A man who thinks for himself. He does
what he thinks is "the thing" to do, yea, verily, coolly
addresseth a girl.

             EDWIN ROBERT WIESE,
                   Allegheny, Pa.
    "My heart is turned to stone; and while'tis mine,
    It shall be stony."
    In spite of great promise given in his freshman
and sophomore years, "Bob" has become the class recluse, appearing only periodically to speechify in chapel,
tinkle at a glee-club concert, or embarrass a literary
society debate by introducing logic (see Prof. Scribner) into the exercises. Our subject has his permanent headquarters in the biological lab., whence will
issue shortly his latest treatise entitled "Frogs, and
How to Feel Them."      Prof. Berger prophesies for
Wiese a future of wedded bliss and we concur in believing that "Bob" and the "Fraulein" will bear watching.

"I am not in the roll of common men." (I am a Miller.)
    The third and popular one of the Trinity is the
wisest of them all-or thinks he is, which is sufficient
for him. There is no subject under heaven or upon
the earth or under the earth of which this lad can not
discourse.  An authority on Chemistry, Psychology,

                  DAVID ALTER,
                    Pittsburg, Pa.
    Uncle David is living testimony to the fact that
you cannot always tell a German by his name nor
a man by his mustache. His original middle name,
Fassleerender, was lost some time since, in the swim.
David can look forty times wiser to the square inch of
"physog" than the next best in the class, and is fast
learning to make his English intelligible.
              THOMAS MUNN BOLE,
                    Bellevue, Pa.
    "Tommy the Silent" will be the greatest advertisement of evolution by education, graduated with the
class of'07. From a mysterious and receding character
of whispers and embarrassment, he has developed into a
fairly intermittent conversationalist, with a smile of
heroic proportions and an instinctive leaning toward a
derby hat, that may in time develop into an ambition.
Tommy's thesis work has been the preparation of designs for a patent adjustable surveyor's platform, to be
sold with transit outfits for the accommodation of the
dwarfs of the profession.

           THOMAS CHASE CARHART,
                  Wilkinsburg, Pa.
     The son of the author of a text book on Civil Engineering, how could he help being a genius. Is distinguished by an agreeableness past understanding and
a convulsive, spasmodic laugh. Last year had a violent attack of infatuation but seems to have recovered.
The medium between the Dean and the class, who
would readily do a good turn for any one.
         LEONIDAS JAMES CREELMAN,
                  Wilkinsburg, Pa.
     In addition to his qualifications for inheriting the
magistracy of Wilkinsburg, L. James has a set of fine,
strong teeth and a bass voice that would cause a bumble
bee to blush. Creelman is understood to be contemplating a visit to the Philippine Islands with a view to
investigating conditions there. Inasmuch as Taft is
busy at present with his bee-hunting, "Shorty" will
have to devise a variation of the hydraulic press to hold
down the lid after he gets busy with those sassy brunettes.
          LAYARD EMERSON DINGER,
                  New Mayville, Pa.
    Lo, the poor Indian! "Squaw Ding-Ding" is one
of the rough house artists. He is ready to start a general survival of the fittest at any time. Uses the weed
in any form you can spare. He is getting to be a real
decent chap since "Youngie" left for parts unknown.
There is a rumor that "Squaw" really has a lady friend.
(Yet) He is still wild, reckless and uncurbed.

            THOMAS LOUIS DOUGLAS,
                  New Brighton, Pa.
    "A man who would make so vile a pun would not
               scruple to pick a pocket."
     With the neck and shoulders of a prize fighter
 but the disposition of a kitten "Tom" has directed his
 energies to basketball and sanitary engineering. The
 Missionary's nightmare. The "kidder" of 1907.
           WILLIAM CLIFFORD FISHER,
                    Swissvale, Pa.
     "Venus," with a shape like a branch of the old
 apple tree, is weighed down with the presidency of the
 Class of 190o7 in perpetuo and it is just killing the pool
 conscientious lad trying to devise a way to clear the
 debt from the class. A friend of everyone, not only in
 sunshine, but also in sorrow.
            JOSEPH SIOUSSA LAMBIE,
                   Allegheny, Pa.
     Fawn-like eyes, milky teeth and raven locks with
a natural marcelle tendency are among the most notable of Joe's outword attractions. As leading lady in
class theatricals he is only approached by "Squaw"
Dinger and Hartman. The three have been styled the
"Three Graces." In spite of a long wind, the result of
four years of daily scaling ()Observatory Hill, Lamlbie
is less of a talker than a basketball player. Loose
jointed and in deadly earnest.

                  JACOB LICHT,
                    Pittsburg, Pa.
     "Jap," so called not because he is one of our far
 eastern neighbors, but because of his inherent talent of
 bluff, should have been a funeral director as he fears
 not to undertake anything from correcting the chairman
 of the "Literary Society" to macadamizing a road. An
 authority on Parliamentary law who has an inexhaust ible fund of jokes (?), who laughs like a hyena, grins
 like a cat, but never weeps. He knows his rights (and
 then some) and he shows them to you.
           WILLIAM MOWRY MURRAY,
                   De Haven, Pa.
     "What better friend hath man than the pipe?"
     "Red" or "Murphy" loves everyone and hates no
one. He never harmed anyone, but he thinks that he
plays rough basketball. "Red" has an abundance of
rusty freckles and pink hair. He wears glasses, for he
strained his eyes looking for a hair (lye and freckle
lotion. Don't worry about it, "MAurphy." It is no disgrace to have those blemishes, but it is very unhandy.
            THEODORE JOHN PIPER,
                   Pittsburg, Pa.
    Theodore, be silent a moment and watch some
other fool. Thereby you may grow wise or at least
learn to conceal thy foolishness. He is a nice and accommodating fellow, but his surprised look becomes
monotonous. He is good at cross-examination, being
so sure to guess the wrong thing and provoke explanation. He is a member of the Glee Club and is most
constantly and unintentionally the plague of Berger's
choir. And then he imagines himself a ladies' man!
97
         CLIFFORD EVELAND TERBUSH,
                   Allegheny, Pa.
    "Evelyn," our class missionary, has qjuite a record,
stole chalk, passed an examination, sassed a professor
and once (but only once) got to recitation on time. A
poor child, with a perpetual grin, who has been spoiled by the home authorities. A great basketball player
and a friend of the ladies, little ones preferred.

         WILLIAM MARSHALL COOPER,
                    Bellevue, Pa.
               "Blessed are the meek."
     "Bill" is perfectly harmnless, but in his inquisitiveness is liable to be severe on laboratory equipment.
"Bill" is the possessor of a sickly smile smeared on an
expressionless face. He is the assistant of John Schreiber, engineer. "Bill" had a girl out to a debate once.
He is guaranteed not to bite, scratch or ruin the furniture.
           WELDAY SCOTT ELLIOTT,
                   Allegheny, Pa.
 "Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge."
    "Muck," our mechanical genius, whose propensity
for a good time and 20 minutes of "survival of the fittest," is well known, has lately developed the bad habit
of resigning and deserting the teachings of P. E. B.
Has been led astray and shows signs of retrogression,
which ought to be laid at the door of his agnostical
friend, according to the "Sky Pilot."

JOHN WILLIAM SCHREIBER,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                 What expressive brown eyes! What pretty rosy
             cheeks! What a beautiful voice! Tut, tut; these are
             nothing. This child is a Senior Mechanical Engineer!
             Alas for John! No more worlds to conquer! The one
             example of a massive mind in a massive body. He has
             subdued and conquered Cooper, the meek and lowly. A
             brilliant hot air vender with Beau de Rochos II as his
             guiding light. Much interested in seamless tubes.
             CONANT VAN BLARCOM,
                   Pittsburg, Pa.
                "What's in a name?"
     Six feet two of natural born engineer, and it came
from Milwaukee. Kind reader, he does not need to
wear sabots to proclaim his pedigree. He has divers
tastes in girls but in his desire to find something to
match his own height, and in order to look presentable
on the street, he sought favor in the eyes of an ex-Governor's daughter. Hartman is his handmaid. Van is
an authority on fashions and etiquette.
        CHARLES McFARREN HARTMAN,
                   Pittsburg, Pa.
    He has never encountered his affinity but just the
same he is searching diligently. At last he met the
new Senior Co-ed. Do not think for a moment that
his affection is all for girls. Base lie! He is a bosom
friend of Beau de Rochos II. of W. U. P. He once
held down a city job with a bunch of other honest politicians. A shark at basketball and hockey.

       "Reden ist Silber, Schweigen ist Gold."
    A Dutch-Irish-American Grand Opera singer, and
he hails from Butler street. He acquired those massive muscles in a foundry, but that auburn sunsetpeace! be still. A companion of "Wetz's", for which
he should be given due credit. Beware, he gets angry
and is then worse than a bull in a china shop. He is
the best of good fellows and bubbles over with college
spirit. Hie believes in Socialism and Spiritualism.

                    Ligonier, Pa.
    "Father" is not a natural albino but his hair assumed its present shade lduring an intense psychic
storm when le was asked to hurry. Prominent in
class meetings, he is, however, even more harmless
than he looks. A   rather concentrated corporosity,
mildly innocent and somewhat troubled eyes, a smile
like a summer sunset and brains, are among his pronminent assets. A willing hand to serve, his attitude is
usually one of mild protest rather than a forceful assertion.
            ROBERT JACOB GLUECK,
                   Homestead, Pa.
    "Where ignorance is bliss,'tis folly to be wise."
    How does he pronounce it? Glick, Gleck, Gluck,
Glook, are some of the many interpretations. Glueck
moves in the best society in Homestead. He is a great
entertainer and somewhat of a ladies' man-with a soft
pedal on the somewhat. As an orator and athlete he
has few inferiors. Hie has several envious admirers
of his mental abilities.
102
            GEORGE HENRY HORNE,
                    Pittsburg, Pa.
    Hornie is one of those welcome personalities who
can never quite forget to smile.  Big of frame and
massive of check capacity, he gives excellent promise
of sonme day becoming a man. Alighty alike both in
class-room and overalls, George is said to ascribe his
prowess to the little old reliable sack of brown sawdust which ever graces his right hip.
         LINDSAY LA CLARE MITCHELL,
                    Pittsburg, Pa.
   "Then he will talk-good gods-how he will talk."
     "Elsie," a tin-horn sport, is noted for his love for
the Hebrew element of the class. Has lost, so report
has it, as high as 14 cents during noon hour with the
tools of the Devil and is ready at any time to give lessons in dancing. Has little chance of graduating with
any engineering class as he neither chews or smokes.
             CHESTER FRASER ROSE,
                     Baden, Pa.
     A story-teller by nature, a condition-lifter by acquisition and during the track season a leader of the
simple life by necessity. A good square fellow, an extensive traveler (he comes daily from Baden) and a
fine orator. One of the "Acridium americanum" who
should have been a mechanical to be in his element.
103
                     ROBERT WALLACE THOMPSON,
                                Allegheny, Pa.
                  "Why should the heart of mortal be proud?"
                  "Wally" abhors girls but never said so. He never
             swears out loud but-. He is very skillful in his secret
             indulgence in the West Virginia narcotic.  A good
             friend and a steady reliable fellow. The only noisy
             thing about this quiet fellow is that bass (or base, as
             you please) voice which he airs in the chapel hymns.
                       WALTER CHARLES WETZEL,
                               Sharpsburg, Pa.
                "He was meek and mild and a man of few words."
                " Wetz" is a friend of "Red Schweppe," for which
             we are at a loss to say what we think. He used to live in
             Freeport, but to get nearer "Red" and civilization in
             general, he pitched his tent toward Sharpsburg. Many
             great and ingenious ideas lie latent under that black
             shock of hair. His characteristics can be summed up
             in a few words: Come what will, you will find me
             ready.
       RAYMOND CHESTER STACKHOUSE,
                    Bellevue, Pa.
    From our old reliable rough and ready bouncer
with a weather eye ever ready for trouble, Stackie has
by the able assistance of our beloved librarian been developed into a veritable lamb whose one baa is "thesis."
Carries his head well forward, burglar style, but his
last theft occurred when he stole a march on Katherine.

            LOUIS KOSSUTH ACKER,
                   Allegheny, Pa.
     Righteous indignation is Luke's long suite, and
outraged innocence his especial forte. Crazy as he is
over Prof. George and the Cobalt Region, he is a man
of wide interests and good judgment. His latest experiment consisted in assaying a specimen of gold from
F..'- prominent flasher. The report indicated a non-paying ore. Energetic, far-sighted, with a slight tendency
for knocking here and there, Acker surely has a
bright future ahead as a prospector.
        WILLIAM FREDERICK FISCHER,
                    Pittsburg, Pa.
                    "Talk is cheap."
     "William Fat" (W. F.) has grown so large in the
last year that he now turns sidewise to get through
doors. "Fat" is the class free side show. He looks
like a Berger that was pulled too soon. The victim
under consideration is the larger half of the Mining
Engineering section of the Senior class. Words,
words and more words flow incessantlv from his jolly
countenance.

    James Gilmore Oliver, within the short time spent among
us, has left a memory that will last and a record that will
endure. He was a member of the Electrical Sectio) of the
Class of 190T. His death, whicb occurred ot April 3, 1907,
came at the end of a long illness. The funeral services, as
simple as impressive, were conducted by Rev. Stevensor, who
was assisted by Chancellor McCormick. The esteer) in which
Mr. Oliver was held might have been judged by tbe nurrber
of members of the faculty, students and alumni wbo were
present.
    A deep sense of irreparable loss is felt by those to whom
Mr. Oliver was more than a mere acquaintance. His was,
truly, a character that fostered intimacy. I0 the deep waters
of his nature one, by seeking, found always qualities as pleasing and beautiful as unexpected and rare. He was absolutely
democratic in every respect. Kindness and thoughtfulness were
the predominant traits of this mar), whoet, the writer is coovinced, few had the privilege of understanding, but whose
consideration and tenderness many will ofter) recall.

               ALVIN CURTIS AMOS,
                    Pittsburg, Pa.
     Joined us again this year, having taken his Freshman year here, then going to Indianapolis for the Junior year. Although he is reported to be the proprietor
of a -lourishing practice in Hazelwood, he was never
known to have that essential to student life commonly
known as "makins." ()wing to the scarcity of his visits to school, we have been unable to become thoroughly acquainted with him, but to judge from his cheery
"good morning," his heart nmust be in the right place.
            AARON REIMER BAXTER,
                   Tarentum, Pa.
     The greatest dignitary of our class. Long, lank,
and lean, with weak eyes, about eleven inches of neck,
and a correspondingly long tongue. He is already a
dentist in his own estimation, and has opened an office
in the hustling burg of Tarentum. He expects to confine his practice strictly to the fair sex, among whom
his charms have already wrought havoc.

        CARL WILLIAM BLUMENSCHEIN,
                   Brushton, Pa.
    He says he is German, but just look at that name',
And he always deals at Arnfeld's. I wonder why?
Has given us several demonstrations of speedy workmanship, having been known to insert an amalgam filling in the short space of three hours. In stature he
resembles a pigmy, in his own mind a giant. His
Herculean brow is adorned by a beautiful mop of
purple-red hirsute appendage of which he is mndily
proud.
        ADOLPH ABRAM BLUMENTHAL,
                   Pittsburg, Pa.
    Late of Jerusalem. Lightning operator and expert on extracting. We could not get along without
him in the infirmary, for who would then care for "His
chosen people?" Has a breath like a man, but a voice
like a nut. He needs a megaphone.

                 "Wait a minute."
    Great bodies move slowly. "Hank" is large. A
man of few words and fewer actions, as he has demonstrated on the gridiron. His strong game is catching
punts (?). Although "Hank" has never visited the
Catskills, he has been known to perform a feat surpassing that of the keg bearer in the myth of Rip Van
Winkle. And through the blackness of Pittsburg's
night, too. He has made his mark in the Dental Department, and that from garret to cellar. Five and
costs. (Koch and Friesell, justices.)

      A millionaire-for a minute. Put didn't he go

 rumored that he once had his trousers pressed, but do
 you believe in signs? Once succeeded in bluffing the

           CHARLES VOYLE BUTLER,
                    Pittsburg, Pa.
     Expects to locate on Wylie avenue and continue
the good work started by Booker T. Washington. A
convenient man to have hanging around the infirmary.
A side-wheeler caused by rubbering at the moon over
his left shoulder. Will persist in brushing his patients
off with a whisk broom.
         CLYDE SPARKS CAMPBELL,
                  Connellsville, Pa.
    One of the most important personalities of our
class. (Especially in his own imagination.) Averse
to use of soap and water. Generally designated by the
pseudonym of "Two Humps."      Finds his heaven of
delight in capacity of "agitator," especially when substantiated by a generous supply of friends. Won a
wife by means of his salubricilious lips.

            WILLARD C. CRAIGHEAD,
                   Allegheny, Pa.
         "Change your name, go on be game."
    He was "Little Jack Horner" to us last year, but
what changes hath time wrought. For a detailed description of this subject, we refer you to the girls of the
Arcade, or fair patronesses of the South Side rink.
One of the fourth triumvirate who's highest ambition

         WILBUR EDWIN DUVALL,
                   Mackinaw, Ill.
    "Duvy" sometimes claims his home as Peoria, Ill.,
but we know that he at one time herded the pigs around
the Mlackinaw river bottoms. For the benefit of those
who don't know where Mackinaw is, it is the place
they dump the garbage from Peoria. "Duvy" attended a college of pharmacy in Chicago and graduated in
Indiana, so by the time he got to us the hay seeds and
corn silks were pretty well shaken off. He was the
official doorkeeper in his Freshman year and handled
the job very satisfactorily.
         WILLIAM ADOLPH HOLSTEIN,
                   Deucher, Ohio.
    Direct from Germany. Spent his first two years
at Cincinnati, but saw the evil of his way and changed
to Wup. Judging from the looks of his grade card
he has been a "student." No particular specialty but
will loll on his patients.

           DAVID POMERENE HUSLER,
                   Finleyville, Pa.
     This man surely derived his name from contrast to
 his disposition. We do not know how he spent his
 first two years of college work, but-well it is no won der that he takes a couple years' vacation now and then.
 If we can just hold him together for a few  more
 months, the Faculty may be coaxed into giving him a
 degree, so he may go back to sleep and not be disturlb ed again by these college fevers.
     DEWITT PRITCHARD HUTCHINSON,
                  McKeesport, Pa.
    Oh, you image of a baby elephant. Hutch took a
bath this spring and caused an awful flood in Pittsburg
owing to the rise of water. He has the physique of a
man, the complexion of a blonde alnd the voice of an
old woman who needs a full upper denture. He has
been known to be at lecture on time--but when?
        ALBERT FREDERICK LEONHARD,
                   Pittsburg, Pa.
             "The pigmy of the class."
    A   quiet, herbiverous  grasshoppericus biped.
Keeps the infirmary crowded with fair damsels awaiting his leisure. A mere child, with a man's thoughts.

            WILLIAM E. LEWIS,
                   Scranton, Pa.
    A concentrated mixture of profanity, vanity, egotism and pessimism. His name is not found on the recording angel's books. Received his early merchantile
education at Kaufmann's. Fond of an argument, and
when once he has formed an opinion all the powers of
Hades could not change him.
     ALEXANDER NEWTON LURTING,
                     Mars, Pa.
    Although "Eck" hails from   Mars, he needs no
stars to guide him as he carries his headlight with
him and his perpetual smile keeps it very much in evidence. "Eck" is a pretty, rosy cheeked boy and is not
a dead one with the ladies. From some of his stunts
in school we have no fear of his ability to take care of
himself and to get the money.
          ANDREW MONJAN MARTIN,
                     Armenia.
    "Who'll walk down with me can have a beer."
We don't blame him for changing, or rather building
onto, his name. Can ask more questions than the quiz
master himself and if he doesn't know theory it isn't
his fault. "Andie" has a smile for everybody, and is
waiting patiently for graduaton so he can hie himself
away from smoky Pittsburg.

         HARRY BROWNE MILLER,
                 Wellsburg, W. Va.
        Vice president'04-'05. Treasurer'o6-'o7.
     The embodiment of Moor's young God. (Yes?)
     Do we need to add that he is engaged? No, just
watch him, and listen to some of his ravings. Has he
a temper? Oh, no. He has a large assortment. If
you want to be shown one, call him "Scarbar." Very
proud of his German ancestry. A lightning change
artist in the matter of toilet.
          RICHARD JAMES MARONEY,
                   McDonald, Pa.
     His name and place of residence speaks for his
nationality. He attempted to turn green into black
last year during the minstrel season, with results that
grieve us to relate. Has revised Nature's process by
having the sixth-year-molar erupt at the age of two
years. See him in quiz and one would think him deaf
and dumb, but wait until he gets down to the smoking room. Destined to become a captain of finance, I
guess not.
             CLYDE HAMLIN NEILL,
     Glee Club'o4-'o5,'o5-'o6,'o6-'o7. Vice presi     dent'o5-'o6. Associate editor Owl'o5-'o6.
     Chief Rooter'o6-'o7. "Artie" hails from Fair     mont, W. Va.
     One of the ragtime millionaires, a breaker of
hearts and a destroyer of homes. True to seven. Appears in the Glee Club picture. Is a workman of some
note and very constant in his lectures, but will persist
in demonstrating to the Demonstrators. Can make
and break more promises than Kyle, and that's going
some.

            CHARLES ADAM REITH,
                    New York.
    "This young (?) man has missed his calling. He
should now occupy one of the exalted chairs in our
faculty instead of simply filling the menial position of
a student. His famous saying, "Doctor, did I understand you to say,-ctc.," has become the by-word of
our class. One of the shining stars along the line of
Prosthesis, and fellow councillor of our beloved patron.
Dr. McCurdy.
            ALVIN DE WITT RHODES,
                  McKeesport, Pa.
    Called "Dusty" by some, "After Death" by others.
From appearances one would think he was of a ferocious nature, but it is just a display of his odontological appendages. Has a hirsute adornment which
would cause the ancient Allen to turn green with envy.
          WALTER RITCHIE,
                   Bellflower, Ill.
    President'o4-5. Sergeant-at-arms'05-07. Football squad'o04-5,'o5-6,'o6-7. You may call him
"Budd," Rabbit or whatever you like, just so you don't
call him before noon. A man given to much roving
and rambling. Claims to have been one of the greatest broncho busters, coyote killers, and all-around bad
men of the West. Has demonstrated his powers of
concentration, not only in school but among the fair
sex as well. Although we grieve to see him leave us,
Dame Rumor has it that Walter will soon pass from
among our happy midst into that dim future, where a
foolish man struggles to demonstrate that one meal
ticket is large enough for two.

    Another student in the Dental Department. Austere and dignified. Soldier in fact as well as of fortune. Helps the W. U. T. Co. out in emergencies, and
grabs honors at the same time. Robby's white hair is
very noticeable, especially when his slumbers are disturbed or when a gentle zephyr passes over his brow.
         STANLEY SNYDER SCHLAG,
                  Hazelwood, Pa.
    A married man with a family, yet a boy. "Roll

          EDGAR WILLIAM SMILEY,
                  Karns City, Pa.
 Otherwise known as "Irve" hails from Karns City, Pa.
    The original Karns City scamp and no mistake.
If you don't believe it, just ask the girls. Always
bounteously supplied with chewing gum and Pollocks." Spent his summer vacation breaking vicious
bronchos in the wild and woolly west. From his ability
at the sign language, one might be led to think that he
hails from the "Sunny Spur," but his language strongly contradicts this supposition.

 President'o6-'o7. Football squad'04-'05,'o5-'o6,'o6-'o7,
                   Windsor, Mo.
     Commonly known as "Waddie" or "Satan." We
much prefer the latter owing to the fact that some of
his schemes could be suggested by none other than his
Satanic Maj.esty. For a physical likeness of this specimen, just throw a couple hundred assorted bones together, smear on a few handfuls of flesh and top the
mass with about eight inches of perpetual grin. But
what wonders that grin does work among the fair ones!
One of the principals in reform system of spelling. He
seems to possess some strange physical power, for one
minute he is a real live man; one or two passes, and
lo, he is but a "microscopical organism, a mere fly
speck on Washington's monument."
                      WINFRED FOSTER BANBURY,

             Kansas cyclone-and is still blowing. Foot-ball squad
'05-6 and'o6-7. Sergeant-at-arms'05-6.   Never
             known to lose his temper but once--that was (luring
             the mix-up with State. His morning constitutional

            belongs to Kelley. In love-with Kelley, but has a per            fect right to be, for he is a handsome brunette. Quite
            an assistant to his classmates in exams (?). Twelve

    "Blear" is certainly a freak of nature, a wonder

one hour and never sleep; talks, or does anything
during lectures. He is a very nice fellow just the
same.
           ALBERT LEONARD BERG,

          Extracts from Minutes of the Board of Trustees
                    on the Death of William Thaw.
           R. THAW     was richly endowed with varied and remarkable gifts.
             He possessed unusual powers of discernment, sound judgment and
             rare executive ability, which enabled him to prosecute with phe             nomenal success the various enterprises in which he engaged, and
won for him ample means, as well as a high and honorable position in the business community. He was by nature generous: and this inherent disposition, sanctioned by Divine Grace, made him keenly alive to the appeals of the suffering
and the unfortunate. In his daily experience he found it more blessed to give
than to receive. Realizing that wealth wap a trust committed to him by his Creator, his life was characterized by the most liberal and wide-spread philanthropy.
Every enterprise calculated to advance the interests of religion, to elevate and
purify human society, to widen and improve the sphere,of human knowledge,
to relieve the unfortunate, or to mitigate suffering, found in him an energetic
and munificent benefactor.
    From the time he became a trustee of the University, more than twenty-eight
years ago, until the day of his death, he was constantly active and liberal in promoting its welfare. Amid his many cares and anxieties, and the ceaseless demands upon his time and attention, he was seldom absent from our meetings.
To the University he gave freely of his time, of his thought, and of his means;
and it is only just to say, that but for his earnest efforts, his wise counsel, his
unfailing liberality, it would not have attained its present prosperity, or have
the bright prospects of future usefulness now opening hopefully before it.
    In the death of William Thaw our country has lost an honorable and patriotic citizen; our community an honorable, enterprising and useful member;
our religious and charitable institutions an interested, unfailing and generous
friend; the University a wise counselor and liberal supporter; and the cause
of science one of its most zealous and unselfish benefactors.

         LUTHER BRUBAKER COLLINS,

    Now, my dear Mr. Dusenberry, you must brace

you will be the admiration of all your acquaintances.

                              Swissvale, Pa.
    "Jake" is a guy who knows it all, or in other words, he has the most enlarged
nut in the class. He will grow out of it though, since he is quite young and yet
seems to have appropriated a large stock of knowledge. Keep a-going, Jake,
you'll be a wonder yet.

                     BARNEY NEWTON DE FRANCE,
                              Grove City, Pa.
    Barney has no nickname, so we will call him "Thunder," for he is the loudest
iellow you ever saw; indeed, he seldom utters an unnecessary word. His character is as beautiful as the music he makes in the Mandolin Club.
                     CHARLES DANIEL DILLINGER,
                               Johnstown, Pa.
    You have all probably heard so much and so often of that very wonderful

           T is the happy experience of most American colleges to have, at
             some time in their history, some man who nurtures and loves
             them with such devotion as to make his memory beautiful for
             all time. In the history of Western University of Pennsylvania,
Wiliain  Thaw was one of these men. In 1864 he was one of,the largest contributors to the $20,000 endowment of the chair of Natural Sciences, but for
years previously he and Josiah King had provided the annual salary. In 1875
he gave to permanent endowment $Ioo,ooo. To the Observatory he gave $30,000.
In his will he bequeathed to the University another $ioo,ooo. He contributed
other sums from time to time. The writer has not at hand the data which show
the exact aggregate, but it is doubtless as much as $400,000. The money, large
as i't was-in that day vastly larger than the same sum would be today-was
not, as the record shows, the largest of his gifts; for his anxious thought, his
tender solicitude and devotion, his loyal and unwavering affection, were worth
even more than the money. As the University enters upon a new period in its
history, we ardently hope and confidently expect that both love and gifts will be
lavished upon it without stint, in emulation of the worthy example set by this
man, to whose memory this volume is dedicated.
                                         CHANCELLOR S. B. McCORMICK.
    "My compensation comes to me in the having done somewhat of that which
a man with my means ought to do for his kind, with the exceptional satisfaction of having the privilege of giving to the race, so far as mere material means
can do it, the labors and results which might otherwise have been delayed or
defeated."

    A great man, not only as a philanthropist in the largest sense.of that word,
but one whose whole life was characterized by that love of truth, which prompted him to noble deeds in behalf of advanced scientific research, and in developing a knowledge of the good and beautiful in nature. lie shall always live in
our memory. The monuments he has left behind him have been hewn from the
quarries of solid truths-truths that shall live when monuments of granite have
crumbled into dust; aye, until the stars themselves have faded, and the new
dawn has been ushered in.

                                Cresson, Pa.
     Fitz has all the fellows skinned, and he's walking away with Miss H--,
 and the boys are standing around with their mouths open trying to catch up,
 Lucky Jamie.
                        FRANK F. FLECKENSTEIN,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
     "Fleck" is a man who believes in being and state of being. Hurrah for Fleck.
                            OLIVER FLESHER,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
     There is nothing wrong with "Flesh" if he does have dog hair and a face
like a cellar door. He has a regular Yankee taste for pie and will make quite a
success in the intervals between filling prescriptions by tending, yes, tending to the
soda water fountain.
                         ALFRED JOHN FROST,
                               Mt. Oliver, Pa.
    This kid tries to pass himself as a man, but while he is one in quality, his
head hasn't reached the age to suit the size.
                            JOSEPH M. GEIER,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Joe is the original Mr. Skidoo of the 23 variety, and a nice fellow.
                         LOUIS EDWARD GIBBS,
                              Mt. Pleasant, Pa.
    Lou is a very good fellow who always has his tie on straight and it is rumored
that he does not always tie it himself.
                         JOHN DAVID GRIFFITH,
                                Donora, Pa.
    John is all right, but quiet. He wears curly hair and sideburns if you see
hinm when he's wanted.

                           LOUIS ROSS HAGUE,
                               Charleroi, Pa.
    "Candy" is naturally the sweetest little thing you ever saw. He has pretty
red cheeks with dimples, a postage stamp and a pipe. He is an exceptionally
nmodel boy.
                       HERMAN CLARK HOLLAND,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Dutch" was born in Nova Scotia in seventeen-two (a hard knock for N. S.)
and since then has been enjoying life in Pennsylvania (he is no disgrace to
Pennsylvania).
                           LEO J. JENDRZESKI,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Lee" lives on Pins Street, but the name does not suit him.
                          JOHN EMIL KETTER,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Ket" is a fellow with untold (also unknown) abilities. lie is a dog fancier,
hcrse racer, sharp shooter and a brick walker, especially the last (has no carfare).
A good scout.
                      ANDREW FREDERICK LANG,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Andy is a great lover of excitement; why, he even said "boo!" out loud the
other day. IHe did so.
                           JAY GEORGE LINN,
                                Bellevue, Pa.
    A jay from Bellevue and a typical sport (in Bellevue) who goes to all the
different dances. Consequently he is a ladies' man (in Bellevue and elsewhere).
                           HERMAN LIPPMAN,
                               Allegheny, Pa.
    One of those dubs who fills prescriptions for clothes lines, etc. A descendant
of Augustus Caesar, and an honor to his ancestor.
                     JOHN STANISLAUS MICHALSKI,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    John would be a great drawing card for any drug store soda water fountain.

                        RAYMOND PAUL MOYER,
                              Pittsburg, Pa.
     -Moyer is one of the best men in the class, and we must not forget to add
 that he has curly hair.
                      ALBERT ANTHONY MUNSCH,
                               Carnegie, Pa.
    This is one of Henry Guth's pupils. No doubt he will be taken care of.
                       FRANCIS XAVIER MUNSCH,
                               Crafton, Pa.
    Francis had a wonderful reputation as a bowler, till he finally met Vetter.
                      JOHN DONOVAN McCARTHY,
    He was named after the Hon. John D. Rockefeller, and if he uses plenty
of hair oil, will some day have as much cleared space on the top of his head
as his namesake.
                           JAMES McCLAREN,
                              Allegheny, Pa.
    A very good kid who has not enough expansive power in his brains to enlarge his head unnaturally.
                        HUGH LEON McGOWAN,
                              Allegheny, Pa.
    H4i-'s so Irish, that he has remained green in spite of two years at the Pharmacy and will probably live to a green old age.
                       ROBERT GEORGE McKEE,
                              Pittsburg, Pa.
    Bob, the poor soul, hes a woife an' tin kids to look afther, and faith, it kapes

                      JAMES CLELAND McNULTY,
                             Washington, Pa.
    Though his head be set up high, his feelings are not. He can do his work
in a store with high shelves and narrow aisles. It would be hard for most people
to look down on him.
132
                    THOMAS JOHNSON McWILLIAMS,
                               Braddock, Pa.
    "Mac" is Irish, my frinds. And shure whin his poor goat died lasht wake,
he didn't know how he wud liv.
                        HENRY WM. REINWALD,
    When "Rind" gets to working in a drug store, he will make a great success
as the man to serve soda water. Any young ladies passing and catching sight of
his face will stop in for an ice cream soda.
                       WILLIAM FRANCES RIGGS,
                               Braddock, Pa.
    Riggs is the candy. He has every girl in the vicinity guessing.
                       DAVID WARREN ROUSCH,
                              Allegheny, Pa.
    "Dave" is a fine fellow. He is so public-spirited, that he is endeavoring
to train his classmates not to scare at the sight of valuables. So he appears with
a mouth full of gold and a fist full of fake diamonds.
                       JAMES ALBERT SARGENT,
                              Emsworth, Pa.
    Sargent is almost a model of good nature, but still he does not like other fellows to go out with his girls, though he admires their taste and appreciates tfie
compliment when the fellows imitate him.
                           JACOB SMOLOWITZ,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Now, sir, young sir, you are going out into the cold, cold world to work for
yoursclf. Some people will like you and some won't-same as now.
                        OSCAR HENRY SOLODAR,
    "Sol" likes red-haird girls. He can surely find plenty. But if he is satisfied,
we are, too.
                         PHILLIP JACOB STOLZ,
                               Allegheny, Pa.
    "When you see an advertisement for a very handsome man with a head like
the lphilosopher, Socrates, to fill a high position in a pharmacy, just give the tip to
Stolz. He will give satisfaction.
133
                       MILTON LEON TIFFANY,
                              Meadville, Pa.
    "Tiff" only has one lung and never uses it. Question? HIow does he live?
Answer. He lives on breakfast food.
                      HAYDEN DORSEY WILCOX,
                               Salem, W. Va.
    "Hay" is the boy with the golden eye-brows and extensive feet. But the fellows love him just the same.

                   CLARENCE SAMUEL ALLISON,
                                Ambridge, Pa.
                             "I am yet learning."
     Allison is a stockily built young man who is not so bright that he shines,
neither is he dull, but jogs along at a good enough pace to get him through. There
is one disadvantage he has, that is his name appears at the head of the quiz list,
which means that Allison is called almost every day, no matter where the Professor stopped the day before.
                       JAMES METHENY BARR,
                                Valencia, Pa.
                       "A little nonsense now and then
                       Is relished by the best of men."
     "Jim" is one of the jolly men of the class. WVe certainly do miss him if he is
absent for a day. His winning smile and salute make you feel good for the balance of the day. Things (lid not look bright for Jim last year for he was a mighty
sick man, but we are glad to say he is again with us and will be there good and
strong at the finish, for he has the goods.
                        FRANKLIN EMERY BEERS,
                                Orbisonia, Pa.
                      "Oh, what may man within him hide,
                      Though angel on the outward side."
     Beers has a good name, (especially on a hot summer day), and is a good fellow. He was up against it during the first two years but things are coming better
now and you can look for him to make a good finish. You can always tell Beers
by his cowboy whoop, which certainly is an earsplitter.
137
                           BENJAMIN BERGER,
                              McKeesport, Pa.
                    "0, what may man within him hide,
                    Though, angel on the outward side."
    Bennie is a giant weighing about ninety or a hundred pounds with about three
hundred pounds of devilment in him. When you get ahead of him let the class
know about it and we will take off our hats to you. Ben does not lead the class,
but is a hard plugger and will land on the right side when the time comes.
                    FRANCIS CHARLES BOUCEK,
                               Allegheny, Pa.
                 "I have an exposition of sleep come upon me."
    Boucek sits first in the amphitheatre; not because he is the brightest man in
the class, but there is such a nice soft wall to lean against, making quite a cozy little corner into which he withdraws himself when he wants to take a nap. If you
wish to get in this seat you must first have it out with Boucek.
                     CHARLES LEON BOWMAN,
                              McKeesport, Pa.
                  "But, for my own part, it was Greek to me."
     "Charlie" is a quiet fellow, (at times), who always has a fear that he is not
going to get through. When the time comes, however, he is generally found on
the right side of the fence and still has a few stored away in that tank of his.
Charlie will make good or we miss our guess.
                   WILLIAM SCHULER BROADHURST,
                                Oil City, Pa.
                "Better one bride in hand than ten in the wood."
    "Bill" is a well developed young man whose delight is wrestling among the
benches in the amphitheatre. If you do not know the reason just ask Bill where
he was the morning a certain party saw him on the bridge at Oil City about 1:30
A. M. Bill also has a stand in with a certain young lady at school; for further
information see any member of the Junior class.
                         FRANCIS M. CALDWELL,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
 "Young men may think old men are fools but old men know young men are fools."
    Frank has quite a reputation in the class. He is another one of our 12opound giants, but O, my, the voice. His little Dutch song, "Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, du
weist nicht wie gut ich dir bin," is well known throughout the school. He came
near being quiz-master one (lay, and there is no doubt but what he could fill the
position satisfactorily, for his head contains some well developed gray matter.
138
                     WILL JAMES CAVANAGH,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                "Now, by two headed Janus,
                Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time."
    Will has a nice crop of curly, red hair and it shows up so prominently in the
class that the boys all call him Red. Can you blame them? But Will does not
like the pseudonym and often gets angry. When riled his face becomes as red as
his hair, but never has it been so red as when he had a little go with Abe Sher in
the Freshman year. It was a treat.
                   JAMES WOOLSLAYER CLARK,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                     "I never dare to be as funny as I can."
    "Jim" does not have much to say and does not rank with the fun-makers of
the class, but he has many, many friends among the boys. It is a treat to hear his
quiet, droll voice in recitation.
                         THOMAS LYNCH COLL,
                              Connellsville, Pa.
                   "I am Sir Oracle,
                   And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark!"
    "Tom" is a happy-go-lucky fellow, very seldom gets excited but when he
breaks out he can be heard for miles around. Everybody around school has heard
his "Alleghenee Genac, Genac." It is rumored that Tom called on a certain young
lady one evening, and when he got back to his boarding house found he was locked
out. He got in all right by climbing over the porch. The boys say, that since
then Tom has become an expert climber.
                      JOHN MOORE CONWAY,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                      "So sweet the blush of bashfulness,
                      Even pity scarce can wish it less."
    John is a quiet young man; has a "How do you do" for every one, and never
seems to bother a soul, but plugs along at a fairly good pace. He has been located
at the Municipal Hospital for some time, where he is getting some good experience.
                     RALPH EMMERSON CUMMINGS,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
              "So we'll go no more a roving so late into the night."
    Cummings has at last become a regular student. During the first two years
he was only an occasional visitor. He is capable of doing good work if he gets
down to business, and should get through all right.

                  "A very gentle beast, and of good conscience."
     This is our friend I'lowhandle. He is a litle fellow but his heart is in the
right place. An easier-going and more pleasant young man you will hardly find
anywhere. He has the respect of every member of the class. He is Historian of
the class.
                       JOSEPH CALVIN EDGAR,
                               Coulterville, Ill.
                 "I am never merry except I hear sweet music."
     "Joe" is one of our big men with nice curly locks, good nattm ed, and musical.
He is a member of the class quartet, having the first tenor part. Excepting the
last year Joe has been a member of the football team since it became so famous
in the fall of 1904. Ile also plays on the basketball team. Class secretary.
                    DANIEL MATTHEWS EVANS,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                 "He that hath a beard is more than a youth."
     Evans is one of our sages but still one of the boys. He is a handsome looking
man with his little red VanDyke to which fact a certain young lady will certify.
Ile always has a kindly smile and a "How are you" for everyone.
                       JOHN WILLIAM FARQUHAR,
                            Monongahela City, Pa.
                  "Bashfulness is an ornament to youth."
     John is a rather nervous young chap, bow-legged, and likes to chew "Five
Brothers." The fellows say he shines among the ladies on the hill. Now, John,
you know that will not (do for a medical student.
                       JOHN EDWARD FERRINGER,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                            "'Aye, sir, a mystery."
     "Baldy" (does not have much to say to anyone and it is a hard matter to explain why except that it may be because he likes to be a follower of Frost. It has
been asked many times why "Baldy" takes so much interest in the newspapers at
the Surgical Clinics. Perhaps he will give an answer.
                       HARRISON HORTON FISHER,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                           "Better late than never."
    "Napoleon," commonly called "'Nap," makes an excellent target for paper
wads and other things, and the boys have target practice every day. He is greatly
missed when he is absent. It was rumored one (lay that "Nap" got his hair cut,
but you could hardly notice it at all.

                           N. ARTHUR FISCHER,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                       "Reputation, reputation, reputation!
                       Oh! I have lost my reputation."
    Arthur is quite an industrious young man but talks a good deal. He was
supposed to have had a reputation as an obstetrician once upon a time, it being rumored last year that he was to be made resident physician at the Maternity Hospital. This must have fallen through. How about it, Fish?
                         WILLIAM COLVIN FROST,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                    "Therefore my,age is as a lusty winter,
                    Frosty, but kindly."
     "Jack" Frost tries hard to live up to his name for he is, to a certain extent, a
cold proposition to the class Perhaps it is partly the other fellow's fault also, for
Jack makes them hump some to keep up with him. However, he has one serious
fault, namely: he thinks the class is composed of one man and he is the man.
                             LEO C. GOLDMAN,
                               New York, N. Y.
                       "And I oft have heard defended,                       Little said is soonest mended."
    Goldman is the hot air distributor of the class. He knows the marks of each
individual, also each Professor's business, (private and commercial); at least he
tells you so. He delights in telling you how often he goes to New York, also to
loaf around the office.
                         RALPH DANA GOODWIN,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                 "They are only truly great who are truly good."
    It is hard to write much more about our friend Goodwin than to say he is A
quiet, easy-going, studious and polite young man, who, about twice a year, raises
a new crop of hair on his upper lip. He is one of our brightest students.
                             JACOB A. GREKIN,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                 "Too early seen unknown, and known too late."
    Some men talk much but know little; others talk little but know much. "Jake"
belong to the latter class, for you seldom hear him spouting off much about what
he knows, but when examination time comes around, he emerges from the battle
with flying colors. He is also well read on subjects not pertaining to medicine.

                    CLARENCE ALEXANDER HAMILL,

                "That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
                If with his tongue he cannot win a woman."
    Clarence is one of our sorrel tops with a sweet captivating voice. He is
charged with capturing several of the belles of the hill with those sheep eyes and
the smile that won't come off. A fair student.
                    PERCY KAUFMAN HELLER,
                               Rochester, Pa.
                      "He hath a daily beauty in his life."
    "Perce" is a fine looking chap and hails from a fine little town down the pike.
IHe is one of our authorities on the shows in town and can be seen any afternoon,
when we have no school, aiming for a down-town beanery prior to going to the
theatre.
                            JAMES HODGKISS,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
               "What's in a name? That which we call a rose,
                 By any other name would smell as sweet."
    "Jim" gets all kinds of names from the Professors. Among the most conmmon ones is Hotkiss; not a bad sounding name but Jim does not like it, he being a
very bashful young man. He is a fair student with a poetic look and Mark Twain
hair, except that it is black, and he seems to take pride in it. However, he is not
much of a poet but is a good hustler. Business manager of the "Owl."
                            WILLIAM JOHNS,
                              Wilkinsburg, Pa.
         "'Tis my vocation;'tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation."
    A somewhat nervous young man who seems to have his troubles in quiz.
He knows it all right, but cannot find the proper word to express his answer.
When it comes to writing, however, he can spiel them off, and that is what counts.
                       CHESTER BEMIS JOHNSON,
                               New Salem, Pa.
            "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
    Johnson can be summed up in the following few words: Mild, modest, meek,
wise, but not in his own conceit; strong, but not physically; an out-and-out man;
as a student he has outgrown the name. He is highly esteemed by his class associates. Member of the class quartet, and class treasurer.

                    CHARLES BARTON KEEBLER,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                 "Because he speaketh not, need a man be dumb?"
     "Keeb" will never be the cause of anyone becoming deaf from hearing him
shout. When speaking as loud as he can it is not much above a whisper. Nevertheless his whispers are generally correct. A good fellow. He may be wearing
a wig some of these days.
                     DAVID DICKEY KENNEDY,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
               "And though mine arm should conquer twenty worlds,
               There's a lean fellow beats all conquerors."
    "Judge" is one of our tall and narrows. It is said he had a chin once upon a
time, but he must have lost it before he came to school. He is rather short of hair
on his top knot. A jolly fellow and a good student.
                        RICHARD ANDREW KING,
                                Millvale, Pa.
                 "Zounds, man! remember thy swashing blow."
    Richard is a meek-looking lamb but with a fiery temper. If you want to get
a crack at him you must not let him see you for he will get back good and strong.
There is some steam behind that trusty right of his, and he gives it exercise during
the summer months pitching for some of the well known teams around town.
                        CLARENCE EUGENE KING,
                              Brickchurch, Pa.
         "For my voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing anthems."
    "Gene" is our "Cow Boy Pete"; he is also called Wild King. He is never
satisfied unless he is pulling someone's ear or hair or jabbing you in the ribs. He
is a good fellow, though, and his sincere "Put'er there, old scout," makes you feel
as welcome as the flowers in AMay. A member of the class quartet.
                            HENRY KLINZING,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                   "i'I will speak in a monstrous little voice."
    "Klin" is one of the South Side Phagocytes, who has a habit of talking but
saying nothing. Harry seems to feel very much the loss of his friend Fruter, who
went to Philadelphia to finish his course. He is associate editor of the "Owl,"
and is continually asking the fellows to "fire stuff" into the editor.
143
                        MARTIN EDWARD KOHN,
                              McKeesport, Pa.
              "Even the smallest worms turn, being trodden. on."
    Martin is quite a character in school, and it is hard to say what we would do
without him. When we cannot find anyone else to blame for some act it is put on
Martin. However, if he must take, he also believes in giving, and gets back at
the fellows sometimes. He is one of our bright students.
                      SYLVESTER JACOB LACKEY,
                                Chicora, Pa.
                    "I dare do all that may become a man."
    When "Lack" does a thing he does it right. He is an inveterate smoker, not
of the ten-for-five-cent class of cigarettes: 0, no! far be it from thee, but he sports
a package of Old Virginia cheroots every day. I guess that's going some. A
good fellow and one of our benedicts.
                           NAN MAY LATIMER,
                               Tarentum, Pa.
                 "Seldom heard; her voice was so low and sweet."
    Mliss Latimer in class but "Nan" among the boys, has been with us since
we entered school, and bids fair to remain until we graduate, for I think she enjoys the company of one or two of our young men. Don't keep us in suspense so
long, Nan, tell us who he is.
                      FRANCIS VICTOR LAURENT,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
                  "Well said; that was laid on with a trowel."
    The "Star" has received his name for the reason of his having become such
an adept at throwing bouquets at himself. He has taken upon himself the important role of affirming the Professors' remarks by a nod of his head, and in quiz the
difficult feat of talking with his hands. He is, like our late friend Ruslander, a
hard thinker.
                           J. HACKETT LYNCH,
                             Cresson Springs, Pa.
                         "As merry as the day is long."
     "Jolly" Lynch joined our ranks in the Sophomore year and we are glad he
did. At first he was a little inclined to be rowdy, but this year he is a different
man. Has a jovial disposition, and was never known to frown. A member of
the class quartet.
144
                         FRANKE EARLE MAGEE,
                               Sandy Lake, Pa.
                "Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
                Since I first called my brother's father dad."
     Magee is a lanky individual who hails from out around the corn and wheat
 fields. As a rule he is is very quiet but at times he is as bad as the rest and helps
 to pass'em back in the amphitheatre. A good fellow and fair student.
                     THOMAS HENRY MANLEY, JR.,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                    "Hath any man seen him at the barbers."
     Tim is a close friend of Rossiter and any time during school hours you can
 see them together. He is a good-natured young man who some of these dlays will
 make a dignified looking M\f.D., wearing a nice, full, red beard, for he has the goods
 (for the beard).
                           ORRIE LESTER MARKS,
                                 Beaver, Pa.
            "Mend your speech a little, lest it may mar your fortunes."
     Until recently'\larks seemed very much reserved and did not mingle much
with the boys, but lately he has awakened and is making up for lost time. We
would like to ask a favor of Marks, i.e., when he gets up to make a speech, to say
something and say it so we can hear it. He is the side partner of Percy.
                    CALVIN CLIFFORD MARSHALL,
                               Glouster, Mass.
                         "The strength of twenty men."
    "Captain," "Cal," "Lizz," "Chesty," and a half dozen other synonyms, is a
robust chap of football fame, whom we would not do without under any consideration. Although Cal. is a big, brawny fellow with a rough outward appearance,
inwardly he is a gentleman, and will make a greater success in nmedicine than he is
making in football. Filled vacancy left by Miller, captain of this year's team, and
is captain-elect of next year's team.
                            OMAR HUGO MEHL,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                "He has found out what Nature intended him for,
                Has stuck to it and is succeeding."
    "Fanny" is another one of our worthy brothers of gridiron fame, and on his
work in that department we do not think it necessary to dwell. As a student he
ranks among the top notchers, and does not seem to exert himself at that. A good
fellow and well liked by the boys.
145
                    VINCENT JOHN MULVEHILL,
                              Braddock, Pa.
    "Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me and be silent that you may hear."
    "Mulve" is another one of our six-footers and is president of the class. If
you want to make a study in art from life just look at Mul when he is reciting
in class. He rivets his stare to a certain spot on the floor, curls his lower lip up
to his nose, then rattles away at a two-minute flat clip. A good fellow and a
fair student.
                      ARTHUR CLIFTON McKINLEY,
                                 Corsica, Pa.
                   "His gold hair time hath to silver turned."
    "Mac" is a light-haire.d chap, who reminds you more of a preacher than of a
medical student, but there is no doubt he can make good at either. He is a quiet
fellow and is beginning to get fat on Pittsburg smoke. A hard plugger.
                 THOMAS LEITH McMCULLOUGH,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                  "But mice and rats, and such small (dear),
                  Have been Tom's food for four long years."
    "Toni" joined our class in the Sophomore year, and we are mighty glad he
did, for he is all right. He is quite a hummer with the ladies and it is said that he
took a trip to Ireland once on account of some fair damsel, but we do not know
how much truth there is in the statement. However, Tom does not say much
about it.
                     MALCOLM HAY PHILLIPS,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                 "I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban."
    "Mal" is a small fellow with a big voice. He is a constant user of the weed
and hardly waits until class is over to light a cigar (3 for 5). He likes to make
the Professor show him when there is anything he is not clear on and keeps propounding questions until he is convinced.
                        WUNIBALD JOHN PROBST,
                               Hartford, Wis.
                   "The lion is not so fierce as they paint him."
    Probst is a big, raw-boned, easy-going chap who came to us from out West.
Your first impression of him would probably be that he is lazy, but that is just his
appearance. He gets around pretty lively and has worked up quite a large obstetrical practice. If you do not believe it, ask him.
I46
                       DONALD JOHN RAFFERTY,
                                 Pittsburg, Pa.
               "Man is one world and hath another to attend him."
     If you will look at the Junior class picture and pick out the fellow whose photo
 is taken in profile, that fellow is Raff. Ile is a tall, broad-shouldered young man
 with a wide, sloping forehead. You know the saying about the sloping forehead;
 but that does not hold good in Raff's case. His usual cry is "Le'me that paper, I
 got a friend I want to hit."
                           BYAN LOWE RAMSEY,
                                Evans City, Pa.
              "Two hundred pounds and possibilities are good gifts."
     "Baby Ram" has been in the best of health ever since he got that prescription
 that was written on the board one day. He weighs about 2oo lbs. and is gaining
 fast, due, as he says, to laughing so much at the jokers (?) in the class. His
 laugh so much resembles the neigh of a horse that he has received the name, Buck.
                        FRANK SAYLOR ROSSITER,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                      "Young in limbs, in judgment old."
     Saylor is one of our dwarfs, but only in stature, as he has an excellent card to
show for the development of his gray matter. It seems to have been a joke, however, for the class to elect him marshal. Imagine him trying to keep Marshall,
Edgar, Rafferty, etc., etc., from leaving or entering the room.
                      ALBERT THEODORE SCHMIDT,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                           "Give him a wide berth."
     "Al," "Judd," or "Dutch," whichever you choose, is a stockily-built young
man with whom you are more or less familiar on account of his achievements on
the gridiron. There is nothing wonderful about Judd as a student, but he gets
there just the same, and, barring accidents, he will be hanging out a shingle in
about a year and a half.
                       MILTON SYLVESTER SELL,
                               Leechburg, Pa.
            "'He hath a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much."
    Sell is a young man, once seen never to be forgotten; he is such a handsome
looker (?). He has anyone in school beaten for talking, with the exception, perhaps, of Marick, of the Senior class. He is continually asking what kind of notes
you are taking and if you are getting anything out of the lectures. A hard plugger and a good student.
147
                        EBERT TAYLOR SIMPSON,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
"He had a head to contrive, a tongue to persuade and a hand to execute any mischief."
     "Siim" is a big bunch of good nature, with a lot of sandy hair on top and containing a fair share of knowledge. He is always up to some kind of a trick and
his greatest delight is found in picking off stiff hats with a hard rolled newspaper.
You can always bank on it that whatever he throws is traveling at some speed,
and not a slow one.
                         AUGUSTUS IRA SLAGLE,
                                Kittanning, Pa.
                    "He was a man of unbounded stomach."
    This is our "Gus," alwavs on tinme unless his absence is due to sickness. You
can pick him out of the class if you come in the lecture room and see a young maln
leaning over a note book, which is resting on the back of the seat in front of him,
and writing like time. liHe is a hard plugger and a fair student.
                            LA MONIER SMITH,
                               McKeesport, Pa.
                      "Willing to be classed as a student."
    "Lainm" in some respects may be likened unto his namesake, namely, his meekness, his constant desire to be lounging around, and the fact that he munst have a
shepherd (Stewart) to take care of him, while in other respects he differs considerable inasmuch as he is tall and lanky, always chewing tobacco, swears a little, and
occasionally speaks a few words of English.
                          WILLIAM JOHN STEWART,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                     "Here's a modest little boy,
                     His mamma's pride, his papa's joy."
    Stewart is always seen leading Smith around except when he leaves the lecture room before the hour is up, which invariably takes place two or three times
every (lay. He has attracted considerable attention lately by asking so many questions, each preceded by a high pitched "say, Doctor?" He may be a good help
to his mother when he grows up.
                       JOHN MURDOCH STEWART,
                                 Rossiter, Pa.
                     "Hang sorrow! care will kill a cat,
                     And therefore let's be merry."
    "Red" joined us in the Sophomore year, and the class would be better if we
had more like him. He is a moderately quiet chap, good natured, with a neversay-die spirit. A jolly good fellow and fair student, and is a member of our class
of benedicts.
148
                       KARL JOHANN SWENSON,
                                Salina, Kan.
               "They that govern the most make the least noise."
    This is the man of whom you probably read in the daily papers last fall, and
referred to as the "Little Swede." The feats he performed about that time on the
gridiron are nothing to those daily feats of his in the class room. A good student
and a fine fellow. Let me give you a word of warning: Be careful of Swens'
trusty left.
                        BYRON PORTER WALKER,
                             West Monterey, Pa.
                         "The mirror of all courtesy."
     "Soap" is a gentleman. every inch of his six feet. Of course he may not
always be a gentleman, for in about a year and a half he will be a doctor. Soap
formerly attended Allegheny College, and must still have a warm spot for the old
place, for as sure as the mail comes, so sure is he to get their weekly paper, "The
Campus." That's the right spirit, Soap, and we admire you forit.
                       LEWIS ALFRED WHITAKER.
                               Dravosburg, Pa.
                 "Every man has his fault, and honesty is his."
    "Hopeful" was always one of our quiet fellows who would not think of saying
a word in the lecture room, but something seems to have caused a change for it is
hard to keep him quiet now. By all laws of nature Whit should be fat, for he is
always smiling, but on the contrary he belongs to the tall and narrows.
                        WILLIAM THOMAS WOOD,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
                  "Come not within the measure of my wrath."
    \Vood may be a chip off the old block, but that does not necessarily signify
that he was intended to be the class "cut-up." He is as meek as a lamb, except
when he gets excited, then he just boils over and shrieks at the top of his voice.
He may be seen always following that wart on his nose.

                "Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time."
    "Fellows-". Here is a Christian, gentleman, and scholar. (In the order
named.)   He tries to make the boys Y. M. C. A. members and does not slight the
girls. One of the few genuinely busy men in school. Specialist in taking down
the professors-et al. He is a great optimist.
                         FITZHUGH LEE BROWN,

                    Cheer up, honey-You'll get there yet."
    Brown is one of the quiet ones, but not for lack of an opinion. He is a good
scholar in spite of difficulties. When you want a gentleman, see him. When the
dear fellow sees the joke he will always laugh, not yet, but soon.

                 "She was a queen of nature's noble crowning,
                 A smile of hers was like an act of grace."

                     "I'll speak in a monstrous little voice."
    Strenuously busy at all times, but always ready to speak to you. If you want
a long and enthusiastic lecture, mention debate, bugology or Hackett. Most unconscionable flatterer, but a true friend just the same. If you wish to know where
the girls are, follow his gaze. He is your typical college man, except for his extra
brains.
                       ALBERT ADOLPH MULHEIM,
                            West Bridgewater, Pa.
             "Is full of change, change, change-nothing but change!"
    Jolly fellow, always ready to turn around and say, "What?" He is somewhat of a swell dresser in spite of that sleepy look in both his eyes. Maybe the
two things are not opposed to each other, for the boy was trained in Beaver College. Naturally he shies at the sight of a girl! Always seems to be just leaving
the building.

                      "Her sunny smile drives care away."
                      HOWARD ALEXANDER KOCH,

                     "A proper man's picture. But alas-."
     Solomon in all his glory never wore shoes like these. Honestly, now, have
you ever seen him without his hands-in his pockets, his hat-on his head, or his
pipe-in his mouth, outside of some classes? Then hold up both hands and sweat
twice. But he is wonderfully improved in the last three years, and there is one
thing that he never lacked-he is pleasant. Mighty glad to see somebody improving at W. U. P.

                    Football'05, Class Basketball'o5,'o6,'07.
                    "Don't never prophesy unless you know."
    Somewhat more changeable than the Medes and Persians, but "Heine" is
there all right and can make you laugh whether you will or no. And he is
another who looks like a gentleman in spite of it all. He, with Koch, constitutes
a chemical section beside which all others pale. They say that they hold a private
prayermeeting during chapel time, but there is nothing but the circumstantial evidence of their absence to prove this, and some do not trust the evidence.

                                Class President.
                  "More years have made me love thee more."
    In him the Buckeye state has kept up its record for providing great presidents.
"Hughie" owns the class and the class is proud to own him. He likes the girl (and
girls) and the girls (and girl) like (!!!) him. Always has a cold in spite of his
warm smile. Gave the number of his shoes as a 34. Slight mistake, for his heart Is
not in his shoes. Indeed it is not his heart that he carries. Specialty--eating
fudge. Name of maker suppressed.
                            JOHN LEO DESCH,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                   "See what a grace was seated on his brow."
     "Handsome Dan" seems great only in recitation, but if you put him at something else, he dazzles the beholder. There are more than the professors who think
him all right. You may think him a good friend but he can beat that. He appears too quiet for a ladies' man, but'tis said he has had no less than thirty affairs resulting finally in a happy engagement, and we have proud anticipations.
                        WILLIAM CLANEY EDGAR,
                                Allegheny, Pa.
             "Cheerfulness is an offshoot of goodness and of wisdom."
    Tired, tired, tired!! Smiles so slowly, talks so slowly, walks so slowly! Always happy and undisturbed. Has not been angry for years, but he could be. No
wasteful expenditure of nerve force. Reminds one of a summer holiday. There
seems to be nothing bad about him, and so we leave him standing with his feet
wide apart and him smilin', smilin'.

                "Mad wag! who pardoned none nor spared the best,
                And turned some very serious things to jest."
     Is a gentleman and a ladies' man the same thing? Not always, but in the pres ent case. If it's just the same to you a smiling blonde is preferred, but meanwhile
 anything will do. Can not keep still when there is an audience for his wit. Yet
 for all his fun some girl will take him seriously some time. And, seriously, now,
 he knows his lessons.
                       RICHARD HARVEY JAMISON,

      Varsity Track Team'o5,'o6.
                  "If I chance to talk a little while, forgive me."
     The jester and rhymster of the class, "Harv' has a new slang expression anti
 new story for every hour in the day, more if you care to listen. From whence his
 supply comes is not known, but from various intuitions it is generally understood
 that much of it sounds like Gayety trash. (How do you know that?) Jamison is
 quite a hustler when it comes to getting around the track in a hurry.
                      WALTER GEORGE KANHOFER,

                            "I profess not talking."
     But a few other things are more in his line. Basketball, for one instance. He
comes from the same town as Judge Buffington Kissinger and you could not expect
two fellows from the same town to have the same characteristics when one of them
has them in such abundant quantity. So George Kanhofer perforce keeps quiet.
lie has a rep for knowing what lie is about and they do say that a young man (?)
in -     - is a friend (!) of his, only that and nothing more.
                     ALBERT WERNERBURG KEENAN,
                                Pittsburg, Pa.
                   "One may smile and smile and be a villain."
    Yes, he smiles and smiles-and he may be anything. "The good die young,"
but "Boss" Keenan, like the great Webster (in one thing at least), may say, "I yet
live." Indeed, he is very lively. An operation will be necessary to get the twinkle
out of his eye, and another one to get the fun out of his brain, for "Al" has brains.
Yes, sir; he thinks he knows things-and he is right. Yet he never seems to be
hunting work, no, not work, yet something. Hie looks at ease everywhere, even
when he is reciting a thing he knows he does not know, just as easy and somewhat funnier.

                    GEORGE BUFFINGTON KISSINGER,

                     "At whose sight, like the sun,
                     All others with diminished luster shone."
    Ladies' uan i! Sporty dresser, always has white (?) silk (?) handkerchief in
his breast pocket. Wears boots worn Iby George Washington (see class picture).
Sober (?) and industrious (?). Always tired. Prominent in Y. M. C. A. Good
natured (he says). Artistic photography a specialty; pretty young ladies excepted.
Warm vocabulary, caused, he says, by indignation. Capacity at noon hour-two
$.15 lunches. A sage of great renown, for without Judge Buffington's golden
suggestions in class, the profs. would often teach us many things that are not.
Supplies glee in the (;lee Club-and elsewhere. His heart is in Montana.
                        ROY CHALMERS SALKELD,

                     "He is well paid that is well satisfied."
     Said to be so fond of argument that he will not even eat anything that agrees
with him. The sounds he makes in chapel are intermittent, but fair to middling
while they last. He1 is more than likely fond of the feminine, having so little
friendship for the masculine line-up.
                       GEORGE EDWARD SHERBON,

                             "How he does talk."
    And run. Having George for his front name you would naturally expect
something from him--as you would from anybody else. Mlillvale is the only spot
o- this large earth, according to George. A great athlete, if you don't mind the
roughness. The "l,ig Dutchman" or "ilillvale," is generally considered to be
improving and has a year yet in our worshipful company. Seemns to care whether
he has his lessons. Good humor may become chronic with him some time and we
wouldn't call any doctor.
                          KARL HENRY SHRIVER,
                               Beaver Falls, Pa.
                    "Whence is thy learning? Hath thy toil
                    O'er books consumed the midnight oil?"
    He is more earnest than others, an(d then some. He means to know-sooner
or later. Shriver is noted for the questions he asks the professors and also for
some of the information he gives them on request--and otherwise. Holds the
record on the long distance kick with a brick-loaded lunch-box. From a distance
you would take himn for a gentleman, and you would be proud of your good judgment on closer acquaintance.

    "Sammyn" is a perfect lady and a fit model for the class to follow. He has
never smoked, chewed, or looked on the wine when it was red. On one and only
one occasion was Sam ever heard to swear. This was made note of and carefully
preserved in the class annals. Sammy is true blue, look at his eyes. And he is
another who does not disgrace the class in recitation.

                  "Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear."
    Large in mind, body and soul. An admirable story teller, and if he keeps at
it Mlark Twain had better look to his laurels. "Hello," says he when you meet
him, and goes on. Just as soon as he gets started he turns around and says, "Say,"
etc. Gives you an idea that he knows something, and rumor confirms the guess.

                         "Talkers are no good doers."
     If silence is golden, John D. will have to be satisfied with silver or mend his
ways. He has an inventive mind and will some day surprise the world with a
new system of levers and fulcrums. If you don't rub him the wrong way he is as
nice as the rest of the bunch, but he has a keen realization of his own rights, all
privileges reserved.

                     "What think you, sirs, of killing time?"
     The physical devwelopment of some children outstrips the mental growth and
 leaves the subject miiintallv deranged. Somehow this floated into my mind in
 connection with Alagaw. No one has a greater appreciation for a joke than has

                     "A solemn sacrifice nerformed in state."
     A quiet and altogether good fellow, although a Sabbath school superintend ent. A shark in electrical lab and a wonder at electrical connections and short
 circuits, though he is prettx rapid on the long circuit of the cinder path.

                 "He capers, he dances, he has the eyes of youth."
     Our ladies' man and a very good boy, strange concomitants as these may
 seem. A shiner in physical lab and an artist in the work of the hour beginning
 at 12:15.
                          EDWIN BAXTER McKEE,

                              "Heard if not seen."
     "Jumnbo" is best kno\1wn as the private coach of "'Bill" McCandless. He has
made a big man of his pupil, but has meanwhile neglected himself. While few in
inches he is long on deviltry of a pleasant type. Great fellow for sport but will
not participate in any, probably for fear that McQandless will miss him. As Dr.
VWebster said in his lecture, the little birds are the bravest. McKee is a bird and
his nerve is inversely proportional to his size.

                       "This would make mercy swear."
    It is a sin to come to school on time when you can sleep a few minutes longer.
Thus sayeth our subject, "Pete," and he verily abideth by the same. He is seldom
seen with his mouth open and accordingly we know little about his heart-if he
has one. But from the crowd he is in he might well say, "There has been so much
said so badly, that I will add nothing."

                        "I am trying to corner brains."
     Clarence is given mostly to all work and no play. Dull boy (?). He even
works in chapel. Yet at periods far separated Alexander will conime forth with a
little rough house, and once in a while, a long while, will hand out a story. There
is a legend that he once visited the Gayety. He is chief skeptic in the Ethics class,
but time may work a few miracles with even so self-possessed a youth as Boddie.

                    A liberal nature and a niggard doom.
     Our bloomin' business manager. A thin, dark beauty. Always telling us we
will have to get something done, which we never fail to fail to do. "Ink" is a
great man in spite of his one bum joke. He has a number of free hand drawings
to his credit around through our ugly shack. Let us quote the touching extemporr
sentiment of the bunch who lunch in Taylor's room. "First in war, first in peace,
and never in the hands of the Pittsburg police." Oh, he stands high in all the people's hearts, co-eds not exceted if they know a good thing when they see it. Get
"Ink" and Eshelman together and watch the electrical display.

                "Laugh not too much; the witty man laughs least."
    Yes, Knott always quits in the middle of a laugh to tell a better story. He is
always looking for something funny and he never looks long in vain. He must
look in the looking-glass in the morning, for he always looks slightly trigged up.
His looks are deceptive-he looks dark. Most of the words descriptive of Knott
seem to be forms of look.

                      "I am lost midst so much learning."
    We all hope that Price will soon find himself so that he can become acquainted
with that nice youth. We have all found him- a real nice boy, equations and all.
lie is one of the fellows who are reported as having Ioo percent. when the rest of
the class got a re-exam. Price always has time for one thing-a joke, even that
bum one of Inglefield. But he works problems while he eats.

                             "What's in a name?"
    Yes, Smith is one of the noisiest fellows on the outside of the globe; not the
noisiest, but one of them. But he makes a noise like a stump. It has been said
that a man of few words is a deep thinker. This may be true. Koskiusko appreciates the joke and is likely to take his turn if there ever is such a thing in that
electrical crowd, for six men may get started and discouraged before one has finished his remarks.

    His method is to meet the world with a smile, and it works like a charm.
Turner has never found a difficulty which a smile could not overcome. He has
been seen, but not heard, to speak in the electrical lunching party under cover of
six strong young men telling three lies at once to the editor of the "Owl."

                       "Shut up in measureless content."
    Somehow you would never know he was there, but there he is and tending
strictly to business, his own business. The man actually does not have time to
listen to "Fat" Fisher's kidding stunts, which are the richest kind of humor. But
if he does not make a reputation for us in Mining Engneering work, nobody will.
I say this absolutely without fear of contradiction.

                                Pittsburg, Pa.
     Robert is very hard to classify, but on account of his good marks is classified
as a boy. The protector of Sturgeon, the admiration of the girls and the envy of
the boys. Handicapped in his social development by living in Pittsburg.
                      JOHN QUINCY BANBURY,
                                Pratt, Kansas.
    The Kansas whirlwind. Plays end for XV. U. P. and runs the hundred in ten
seconds. Brother of Big Ban, and is following in his footsteps. Inclined to be
quiet; never known to associate with the gentler sex, but is generally supposed
to be a man with a past.
                      DAVIS RICHARD BIDDLE,
                              McKeesport, Pa.
    One of those good-hearted country boys with a smile for everyone. Has the
ability to look on the bright side of life from one leg. Considered a bookworm by
some a good student by all. Spends many idle minutes consulting and giving advice to our lady students.
                    WALTER FURMAN CANNON,
     Big Gun would have been a better fellow if he had not hailed from Greene
county. Called "Snaker" by some, other names by advertisers. Walter is our
business representative on the "Owl." Beats the ivories a little and some card
player. Is married, so no doubt he gets his'n.

    "Carp" weighs 350 in his nightey, and is a bunch of concentrated smiles, which
is queer, considering that he is married. Demonstrated to a Senior that he could
play pool if necessary. We have great hopes for "Carp" after he has served his
time, but do not think he will get any credit for good behavior.

plays his part. An original wit and often in trouble. Member of the A. A. B.

    Another member of W. U. P.'s football squad. Played most of the games onl
the side lines, therefore his criticisms were valued. Varsity's star baseball catcher

time at W. U. P. in the pill rolling department. "Heck" is always ready for an
argument and a more enthusiastic advocate of football than the athletic board.

                                 Jeannette, Pa.
    "Huffy" is considered a good authority on dogs but as a quarter-back we are
forced to say he is a failure. Sings well but whistles better. Dabbles some in
love, has long hair and the artistic temperament of a poet.

    "Kingsley" came to us somewhat handicapped by having an A.B. from Geneva
College. Having lived outside of Pittsburg he has never had his ideas of good

    Clara came to us from behind her father's clothing counter, so of course she
knows men. Burns incense at the shrine of Rudolph. Somewhat of a nuisance,

                                Avalon, Pa.
    Sam glories in the fact that he was the best kicker on the squad. Occasionally
he sings bass, usually terrible. One of W. U. P.'s baseball performers and is considered a good one. "Burl" comes from a family of dentists and as he is making
great efforts we have hopes.

         THE OLD ALLEGHENY OBSERVATORY
         FROM ADDRESS OF JOHN ALFRED BRASHEAR, Sc.D., LL.D.
                 AT THE LAYING OF THE CORNERSTONE OF
                 THE NEW OBSERVATORY, OCTOBER 20, 1906
           HE story of the old Allegheny observatory is replete with interest
             not only to the astronomer, but to the good people of Pittsburgh
             and Allegheny. For are we not proud of its history, proud of its
             achievement in the domain of science, proud of the men who have
(lone so much to advance our knowledge of the beautiful science of astronomy?
For discoveries of momentous interest in solar, stellar and planetary physics
have been made within the walls of the (lear old1 building on Observatory Hill,
and to-day the discoveries made there give us a standing in the scientific world
second to none.
    Have we not also a pardonable pride in that noble corps of men who a little
more than forty years since planned and builded the old observatory? Builded
better than they knew, for forty years ago little was known of the new astronomy
in the field in which so much has been sown and reaped at the old institution.
    On the evening of February 15, 1859, three citizens of this city and Pittsburgh
met at the office of Professor Bradley to consider the purchase of a telescope, "the

                                Coalvalley, Pa.
     "Mlatt" is such a dressy boy, and a winner with the ladies. Likes to be made
 much of and frets unless he is greeted with marked attention. Has a fondness for
 dissection, and can and will fight. Has a peculiar attractiveness which commands
 attention.
                     ARTHUR GARFIELD RINARD,
                               Breezewood, Pa.
                         He Haw, his name is Maude.
     He Haw, his name is Mlauide. Long, lean and lanky. A seeker after infor mation and has ideas on every subject. Inclined to be grouchy, but it may be due
 to stomach disorders. A. G. is a good student and taken at his worst is a man.
                       WILLIAM ROBERT ROBISON,
                                Beallsville, Pa.
                    Roby is our globe trotter and metal man.

 tales he has to tell. Polite to the extreme; has a wonderful retentive power, conse quently he retains what he learns.
                         JOHN JOSEPH SEVERIN,
                               Carrolltown, Pa.
     A typical sky-pilot. Has the meek, injured air of a missionary and a voice
like a lost child. J. J. has a villainous way of making each girl think that she is
the one for him.
                      JOHN ANTHONY STERN,
                              Allison Park, Pa.
    Great things have happened in this world. John may be a dentist. Stern but
not cold. Has gray hairs, caused by early piety and sitting in damp churches.
Not so bad, just a little naughty at times. Has a mean way of deceiving the ladies,
but some sweet girl will capture him when his college days are over.
                        JAMES GLENN STURGEON,
                                Oakdale, Pa.
    Here is truly a monstrous subject, 8 feet 42 inches with his boots on. Has
a laugh as tender and appealing as an old horse. His chief difficulty is getting in
and out of the lecture rooms. Has a way of looking worried, but don't believe it,
he has sore feet. Without Big Fish our ranks would be sadly shortened.

                       JOHN CUMMING SULLIVAN,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Sully," like other noted men bearing the name of Sullivan, is here for the
finish, and we think he will get his. Through the efforts of Dr. Ashbrook, John
discovered that he was a herbivorous biped, only he does not swallow the cud.
                       CHARLES ERNEST TAYLOR,
                               Franklin, Pa.
    Spent his "Fresh" year at Cincinnati, but saw the error of his way and
changed. Rummy is a winner with the ladies, and has a private telephone line to
Franklin. tMember of the A. A. B. and a good, consistent one.
                         JOHN OSCAR THOMAS,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Antiquated and somewhat mummified but still in the ring. Playmate of McClelland and a pillar in the Y. M. C. A. A better executive than Roosevelt; talks
more and says less than a Freshman.
                      FRANK WILLIAM WALDRON,
                                Butler, Pa.
    "Pat's" confidence in his own ability to joke makes it mighty disagreeable for
those around him. Has a fondness for separating Freshmen from their change.
Has the ability to look not guilty when accused.

                              New Castle, Pa.
    "Ben" was educated in New Castle-which shows what kind of institutions
they have there. He says that he also attended a Sunday School in that place,
hut we see more reason to doubt it than to believe it. However, he's not so bad.
                        ELVERN THOMAS ALLEN,
                                 Corry, Pa.
    A specialist in the Yankee trick of answering question with question, but
tries to introduce variety by making the question silly, and is naturally successful.
Truly, he has wonderful qualities.
                            JOHN LEE ALLEN,
                               Allegheny, Pa.

                               Alliance, Ohio.
    Bandy is short, fat and lazy, with a voice valuable for an auto tooter. He
will persist in letting the hair grow on his face.

    "Pap" set up business in this world sometime back in the'6o's, and yet he is
one of the boys. Ambitious, honest, agreeable, good-looking and well liked, and
what more would you expect.
                    HOWARD SYLVESTER BOSSART,
                              Allegheny, Pa.
    "Boss" is a pretty boy who has a rosined voice, likes paper down his neck,
pencil marks on his collar and chewing gum in his hair. Now some people get
what they like.
                     ALFRED WILLIAM BRITTON,
                              Meadville, Pa.
    Britton has an advantage in having a natural curl in his hair. He has a habit
of wiping his feet on other people's clothes, but he is young yet and a few years'
experience will cure him. Does Blumenschein like him?
                        FRANIK PATCH CARTER,
                              Pittsburg, Pa.
    There may be a great deal of learning in "Bugs," but it has never come out.

                       CARLTON FRANCIS CASE,
                              Hartstown, Pa.
    "Daddy's" name is certainly appropriate, for he is a case. He will make a
large noise when it is not necessary, but when it is required he makes no more
noise than a mouse. A very nice man.
                         JOHN FRANCIS CLARY,
                               Carnegie, Pa.

the boys.
                        AUSTIN EARL DOUGLAS,
                              Newcastle, Pa.
    "Dougie" is the brave boy of the class. This is one of his stunts: The cat
was sleeping in the street and a large team was approaching. "Dougie" picks
up a rock, twirls it at the sleeping feline, kills the cat and so saves it from a cruel
death under the horses' hoofs. He was rewarded with a severe tongue lashing by
the old maid, who owned the rock.
                   HARRY OLIVER NEWTON EVANS,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    IIe is a man with inlaid ability, laid in well. His head has altogether too
great capacity for what he has to put in it. He discovered that one-half of 3,000
is 6,ooo. Class photographer and a good fellow.

                              Gallipolis, Ohio.

                               Carrick, Pa.
    "Flini" can hardly wait until he gets through in order that he may go down
on Diamond Street and get a license. We don't know his girl, but to hear him
talk, she must be angelic. He's rather exceptional himself.
                       HARRY AMBRUSE FOWLER,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.

                               Allegheny, Pa.
     Frank is long, lean and lanky, but very easily hit. In class he will go into
 convulsions over the faintest glimmer of an infinitesimal joke.

     "Gad" is a greaser as you would expect from that town. He was born in
Alaska and has gold fever. You can tell his birthplace by the temperature of his
disposition.

                               Homestead, Pa.
     Garber is a Republican who named himself after Grover, the great Democrat. He can tell the date, place, result and humber of killed and wounded officers
and men in any battle in or out of history. And yet he is not a bad fellow.

                               Allegheny, Pa.
    Another small one who becomes prominent by foolishness, his favorite diversion being to roll around on the floor of the smoking room.
                         ISADORE GORENSTEIN,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Age 20, on April 15, 1907. Date of birth, April 15, 1887, at Shepatowka, Russia. Served apprenticeship and practiced in Shepatowka for number of two years.
Feb. Io, 19o4, immigrated to this country, U. S. A., and since here served my apprenticeship in the city of Pittsburg, Pa., for number of three years. Yours,
Isadore Gorenstein.
    Isadore is the only man privileged to write his own tale. One thing more
might be mentioned. His head has a magnetic power, a power of attracting all
loose paper wads, rubber bands, pencils, etc., in the classroom.
                        GEORGE WILLIAM GRIER,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    George is a very nice boy-with a heavy accent on the nice. He never has
dislocation of the necktie. Moreover, he has been known to escort a young lady.
Why, this remarkable pharmacist tipped his hat to a lady whom he bumped into
and upset in the street. Now that's a fine fellow.

                        JAMES EDWARD GROSS,
                              McKeesport, Pa.
    "Jim" is a terrible enemy of work. It is plain that he is German, for some of
his blunders can be explained in no other way. His hobby is sleeping.
                       LAWRENCE A. HAECKLER,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Heck" is a good one. He aspires to oratory and may get there, for his voice
is husky from eating corn.
                      JOHN BURNETT HAMILTON,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Hle is a very studious lad. Yes? Surely going to win in whatever he tackles
(not excluding poker). Some day he may be president, but he may be hung too
soon and prevent that.
                          JOSEPH E. HAMMEN,
                             H.arrisonburg, Va.
    "Ham" is a $4 man with a $40 motion. We may say, without telling even
the whole truth, that he has the largest head in the class. It takes an 8/4 hat to fit
it, and then he has to have his hair cut twice a week.
                            MARK C. HANN,
                            West Middlesex, Pa.
    Hann is a fellow who never sleeps-except in the class room. He is also
a geographer of fame, for he can tell every river or creek in Africa. It is rumored
that he fought in the Boer War (that was what prolonged it) and hopes to be a
second Oom Paul.
                       WILLIAM WEBB HAYFORD,
                              Newcastle, Pa.
    "Hays" is a man with a tin ear and wooden head, which will turn to charcoal soon if he doesn't dye his hair. A follower of the socialists, but still able to
be social.
                        WALTER CLARK HELM,
                              Coraopolis, Pa.
    The one man in the class who is a regular attendant on class, has not missed
one hour since the beginning. Distinguished looking and a ladies' man, hence he
keeps (maybe because he keeps) a silk handkerchief on exhibition in his breast
pocket.

                    JAMES HARRISON HENDERSON,
                              Kittanning, Pa.
    "IHendy" is a fellow who never opens his mouth, hasn't sense enough to know
you must butt in to get a word in. If he was cut out for a human being, there was
a mistake made, as everyone who knows him realizes, for he should not te a dumb
animal. A good fellow.
                       ROY EVANS HENDERSON,
                               Avalon, Pa.
    A kid with a pretty face, but nothing more. But he is young. All he thinks
of is playing. But he is young. Nice boy. But he is young.
                         MAX HOECHSTETTER,
                              Braddock, Pa.
    Germany grows the thistle, and England grows the rose; Ireland grows the
shamrock, but Hoechstetter grows-well, he grows. He is the most important
personage in the class. He calls meeting without any little formalities like consulting the president or anyone else. We all have our faults and don't need to borrow. Hock is the dark horse of the next national presidential campaign. He will
remain the dark one.
                   PAUL EDWARD CHARLES HOMAN,
                              Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Home" is a very good scout and is without doubt largely made of sauerkraut and so Dutch that he can not speak German. Das iss der Schnitzelburg.
                        FRANK ELTEN HULME,
                              Newcastle, Pa.
    His only fault is that he knows more than others. He should be traveling
with Robinson Crusoe-or some other poet.
                       ROY HERBERT HUTZLER,
                                Butler, Pa.
    Fresh from the farm and likes the city very well. Although he is not wild
he is sometimes drawn away to the Duquesne Garden and other places. Rather
nice fellow.
                      THOMAS FRANCIS JACKSON,
                                  Mars, Pa.
    "Tom" takes the basket ball team to his home planet and there fills them
up to the neck with-you know. Then he has his team put the bug on them,
fills them up again and sends them home. Tom likes it.

                     PHILLIP SHERIDAN KEFOVER,
                              Uniontown, Pa.
     "Keef" knows every waitress in town. He is very well posted-on matinee
 dates, ball games, etc. His ambition is on a level with that of a mosquito. He
 would make a second "weary wiggles," but his parents won't let him run out of
 money.
                      BENJAMIN FRANKLIN KELLY,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
     "Ben" is one of the wee with a voice like a bird, so charming that it draws
 to him all loose buns, bricks, boxes, tin cans or anything else in the vicinity
 which may be moved in his direction. Otherwise Kelly is a very good youngster.
                         LOUIS EDWARD KERN,
                              Johnstown, Pa.
     Kern was at one time a noted gymnast, but now uses his skill in rolling
pills. Something makes him a very pleasant fellow.
                       RALPH COPPAGE KNISELY,
                           New Philadelphia, Ohio.
    Knisely is the moke who, when the girls look cross-eyed at him, gets red in
the face (i. e., he blushes) and makes himself scarce. He is one of "the bunch."
                       CHARLES BURNETT KREY,
                               Allegheny, Pa.
    Krey is a good fellow, but his neighbors generally take in their clothes lines
when he is in a bad humor, which is characteristic of his famous birthplace.
                    THOMAS CHRISTOPHER KURTZ,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Kurtz is a trained bouncer. Ile was one from the first day of his life, for
then he was pronounced a bouncing boy. He is a second Bill Nye.
                           WILLIAM LATON,
                              Wilkinsburg, Pa.
    He is a man who always looks things up, a regular grind, but not so bad for
all that. A man's a man for a' -that.
                       GEORGE HENRY LIEBERT,
                              Philadelphia, Pa.
    "Rags" is one of these characters who never say, "Come and have one," buT
on the other hand he never refuses such an invitation. It certainly is a treat to see
him and Miller walk down street arm in arm. Liebert is a good soul anyway.
'79
magnifying power of which would bring the heavenly bodies near enough to be
viewed with greater interest and satisfaction."  These three citizens were Professor Lewis Bradley, Josiah King and Harvey Childs. After some conversation
upon the subject it was decided to request other gentlemen to meet with them.
The next meeting was held on the evening of Washington's birthday, February
22, 1859. At this meeting, "after further conversation, it was proposed to place
the telescope upon a housetop in the central part of Allegheny."
    The committee on site had some negotiations with the city with reference to a
location on Seminary Hill, a lease of which was offered to the association for an
annual rental of sixty dollars per year, but about this time Mr. Ferguson and Mr.
McClintock offered free of cost a large part of the plot of ground on which the
observatory now stands, and an additional piece was purchased from Mr. Ashworth, making in all a tract of over ten acres, on what was then perhaps as fine a
location for an observatory as could be found near the city, as the prevailing winds
carried the smoke away from it, thus insuring good observations in its earlier
history.
     So successful was the association in raising funds for the proposed observatory that it was decided to purchase a 13-inch telescope instead of an 8-inch, as
originally proposed, and on motion of Mr. William Thaw it was decided to instruct
a committee to make arrangements for the purchase of an instrument from Mr.
Fitz, of New York, who had only a short time before completed a similar instrument for the Dudley observatory at Albany, New York.
     The complete organization of the association did not take place until May 15,
i86o, when the constitution and by-laws were reported and adopted and a board
of directors elected. The members constituting the board were: Hon. Thomas
M. Howe, Dr. C. C. Hussey, Mr. William Thaw, Mr. Josiah King and Mr. John
H. Shoenberger.
    Dr. C. G. Hussey was elected president of the board and Mr. James Park, Jr.,
secretary.
     The act of incorporation by the legislature of Pennsylvania was approved by
Gov. Packer, on the 22d day of March, 186o.
    The observatory was completed and the telescope erected between the first of
November, i86o, and the end of January, I86I.
     On Tuesday evening, November 17, 1863, Prof. Philotus Dean was elected director of the observatory for one year. The records do not show any important
observations or discoveries made up to this time, indeed it is presumed that the
telescope was used almost entirely for observations of the moon and planets by the
members of the association.
     The first director of the observatory served without any salary, save that he
was furnished with a dwelling house free of rent.
     On the ioth of May, 1867, a meeting was held of the stockholders of the Allegheny Astronomical Association, as it is now called, to consider its transfer to the

                           HARRY DOP LUCAS,
                              Greensburg, Pa.
    Lucas is the pool shark of the class, i. e., he plays a great deal-when he can
get someone easy to play with. He will forego a matinee to play a few games!!
However, he is a pretty fair proposition.
                       ROY FRANCIS MARTHENS,
                              Homestead, Pa.
    He would be considered an enemy of work, if they met often enough to get
the slightest acquaintance. His highest ambition is to be a policeman-mounted,
and then if he couldn't be arrested, he could make an arrest which would insure
some variety in life.
                      CLEMENT JOSEPH MEADOWS,
                           Berkley Springs, W. Va.
    Here is a case where the fine goods have come in a small package. Although
C. J. is a great cut-up outside, he becomes a tongueless man inside the class room.
Really, he is the right kind.
                        EARL HOMER MECKLEM,
                               Rochester, Pa.
    "Meck" is reported to have been educated in Beaver county, but it is known
that they have far better institutions than that in the above mentioned place. But
while we object to slandering that school, we like him as a fellow.
                        ISADORE MENDELSOHN,
                                 Roumania.
    Gentlemen, this is a very fine imported article. But his pride in his high
Latin average causes us to remember that Latin comes easy to a Roumanian.
                       FRANK HERBERT MILLER,
                             Beaver Falls, Pa.
    Here is a case of quality in quantity-in quantities. HIe is a ladies' man. All
the girls in the Mercy Hospital wait at the windows to see him go past; indeed,
all the girls do, from the Union Depot to the college. He has a patent pending
for a wheelless bicycle. He has our best wishes in all these matters.
                       RINARD THOMAS MOFFITT,
                               Duquesne, Pa.
    Not because his hair is curly, nor because his eyes half close; not because
he's by and burly, never sure just what he knows; no, we can't assign particular
reasons why we love him so. His features change twice a week, and it is a good
thing. Moffit always has his hammer knocking.

                       DANIEL OSBURNE MORGAN,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Morgan is a sample sized fellow. He is a ladies' man and knows more girls
than any other fellow in the class. It has been reported that he goes to church
with Mrs. D-. Good luck, Dan.
                        CHARLES RUTH MURRAY,
                              Washington, Pa.
    "Chuck" is so religious (most pious in the class) that he won't loaf with the
boys, for they swear too much. Such scruples are not popular, but they are creditable.
                         BERNARD MacDONALD,
                               Boston, Mass.
    " McSweeney" says he is not Irish, but we give him the benefit of any doubt.
lHe was brought up by a Dutchman. Mac is a dog fancier, has the best bulldog
in the county (if you are willing to take his word for it). Ile is very much in
love with the vegetarian diet of ham and baked beans, and has also been known
to walk away with thirty dozen eggs at one time.
                      LEONARD SHRYOCK McCUNE,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Miss McCune" is the best looking man in the class and, oh, deah! but he
is dainty! He wears the dyed-in-the-wool smile and has a good word for everyone. So he is well liked in spite of his looks.
                        THOMAS LEO McKEOWN,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Red" is the main gazaboo of the class, but he doesn't altogether run it,
though he did try it. "Red" likes to appear nice in the eyes of the ladies. He
wears his hair like Prof. Saalbach. Really a nice fellow and good president.
                            WILLrAM McVAY,
                               Bellaire, Ohio.
    "Bill" came from the place of good air, although it is known to be the dirtiest
place on the globe. Bill brought a large amount of the good air, brought it up
a few degrees C, and has been giving it out freely.
                    RICHARD COULTER OSTERWISE,
                              Greensburg, Pa.
    "Oss" is the religious crank of the class. He would rather argue religious
questions than eat, drink or be merry. It is not certain what religion he follows,
but it is one of three Mormon, Feet-washers or Fire-worshippers. He does
have good qualities.
181
                              A. V. OWEN,
                              Pomeroy, Ohio.
    The man with the large name, who says that when he wants anything, he
knows where to get it. He suggests the restaurant as a place for something to
eat, the saloon for drink, the bank (or home) for money and we suppose that if
he wants work, he will hunt the workhouse.
                          HOMER JOHN PARR,
                               Crafton, Pa.
    Parr is a long, lean, lanky youth, who is sadly in need of sense. It is rumored that he is married, and one might believe it of him.
                      CHARLES EGBERT PAISLEY,
                              Newcastle, Pa.
    In one respect man is the nearest thing to thee. We don't understand why
natuie does such poor work, but as we have to be satisfied, we have turned to
and liked Paisley. Why not?
                        JOHN BRATTON PARKS,
                              Leechburg, Pa.
    "Doc" is the man with sideburns which he is wearing because of a dare (from
fear of trouble with his prospective). He is well liked by the fellows, though
considered handsome by the laundry girls. Our vice president.
                      WLADYSLAV PIETKIEWICZ,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Some call it a man, others can't call it, the rest just laugh. His name you
can see and so guess his looks. "Piet" is an artist. An agreeable sort of being.
                        CHARLES EDWIN PRICE,
                               Braddock, Pa.
    Mr. Price isn't in it with a mosquito for sense, but as a tenor vocalist he rivals
Chauncey Olcott or Andrew Mack. A good fellow, though he is from Braddock.
                       CHESTER MERLE RAISLEY,
                             Beaver Falls, Pa.
    Manager and captain of football team and also on basket ball team. "Raise"
went to a Youngstown squire, asked to be hung and was hooked. Raisley really
is not married, but his wife is, though, if she knew him as well as she should, she
would never have done it. He is a good fellow and will sometime be lively after
while; he was just married on Feb. 12.
182
                          RAYMOND RALSTON,
                              Rochester, Pa.
    Ralston is a regular attendant and a ladies' man. Notice, he's both of those
things all at once. You would guess where he came from, if you should ever
see his movements.
                       FRED KIMBLE REICHARD,
                              Allegheny, Pa.
    Reichard is a peculiar duck; he can sleep, snore, talk and at the same time
take notes on the lecture (nobody ever saw the notes). He even keeps quiet during Saalbach's quizzes. How strange! Yes, but he is pretty nice.
                               FRED REIF,
                               Allegheny, Pa.
    Reif is the man who put the chewing gum in Goldstien's hair. He is so
cross-eyed, that the tears run down the back of his neck. Sometime he may get
older and do several more desirable things.
                         WAYNE ELI ROBERTS,
                               Bellevue, Pa.
    Thinks that he with his meerschaum is setting the town on fire. He will
doubtless awaken some (lay and discover himself asleep.
                         FRANK DELROY ROOT,
                           Cambridge Springs, Pa.
    Root wears corduroy pants and blue shirts and eats five-cent pies. When
deprived of his blue shirt and his shoes, he has been known to run after the pie
wagon without fighting for them. So he puts pie ahead of all other things.
                           GEORGE W. RUHE,
                             Beaver Falls, Pa.
    Ruhe smiles-he cannot see himself. He may study hard, but it hasn't
caused him to waste away at all; so, though he may -. The class chose him
as their representative wit. He certainly is quite representative, but as to the
wit-well, if you have plenty of time at your disposal, get a lunch and wait, for
he came from the hustling metropolis of Beaver Falls. Ruhe-to use his own
favorite expression-is a good scout.
                      HOMER RAMSEY RUMBAUGH,
                             Mt. Pleasant, Pa.
    Homer is a very good boy, and he would look more at home as a minister.
His mother says she is proud of him.
183
                    ELMER ELLSWORTH SANDBACH,
                                Butler, Pa.
    Basketball manager. He is a good fellow, though his feet are not mates. He
would make a better cigar maker than pill roller. Fresh from his father's farm
and advance agent for his friend on returns.
                      WALTER FREEMAN SCHEIBLER,
                              Uniontown, Pa.
    Scheibler is a good fellow and will be a very promising young man when
he has added a few more years to his string. He is very typical of his racethe Dutch.
                       WILLIAM FRANK SCHOLZ,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Scholz is a man with untold qualities, a great student-of human nature,
especially the feminine division. He is not married, but he is ready for the sacrifice. We wish him success.
                       WILLIAM JOHN SCHRECK,
                              Allegheny, Pa.
    A crazy sort of being. With a book in his hand he acted as drum-major
for a crowd of lunatics going down Fifth Avenue. Every time he opened the
book the bunch tipped their hats. It was about 5:45 P. M., and the department
stores were just closing. So "Bugs" opened the book about forty times a minute.
Now, what do you think about his head?
                            SAUL SEEGMAN,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Saul means all right, but somehow nobody takes the same meaning out of
his actions.
                     WILBERT TURNER SHAEFFER,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Shafe" is an Irish bloke, so very Irish that if you look at him too long, your
eyes turn to the color of the Emerald Isle. He is a spectacle of inhuman nature.
                       JAMES CLOTHIER SIMS,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Sims was born some time back. There have been regrets,ever since, and not
without reason. He will certainly go to Heaven when he dies, but he will have
a longer journey thither the longer he lives. A nice fellow, too.

                      IRWIN SYLVESTER SMITH,
                              Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Babe" is our infant and he is ambitious to be a prodigy. His seat, No. 23,
distinguishes him.
                       JOHN SYLVESTER SPAN,
                             Homestead, Pa.
    John S. is a youth who knows it all, even though he is from Homestead.
His head is remarkable.
                      PAUL THOMAS SQUITIERI,
                              Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Squit" is the name he answers to, but "Squint" would do better, for he
is always half asleep. He is a very good scholar-in his own mind, and that is
better than nobody. He never molests anyone-to their face.
                      CLARENCE ALFRED STITT,
                              Munhall, Pa.
    Stitt is a man without anything to show his nationality. Some describe him
as Dutch, some class him with the wearers of the green. We don't pay any attention to what he says.
                     JOHN FRANKLIN TANNEHILL,
                              Allegheny, Pa.
    "Tan" is a man, i. e., you would suppose that when looking at him, but when
hearing him you think he must be six or maybe six and a half years old. He
expects to be a man some time.
                         MISS GRACE TRUBY.
    They don't make better coeds than Miss Truby, if we are any judges. Everybody likes her and would do more if they thought it any use. She is our treasurer.
                          ROBERT A. TUGGEY,
                            Trout River, N. J.
    "Tugs" is a man with marvelous skill in juggling. There are other things
about him, but surely this is enough for anyone. He is a nice fellow.
                     JOHN BAYHAM VALENTINE,
                             Washington, Pa.
    John's name is very appropriate on account of his looks corresponding with
the comic variety of those works of art. A mighty nice boy.
185
                   WILLIAM BERNARD VOLLBRECHT,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Bill" is the pretty boy with the fire plug countenance. He says water is a
very good thing-for a chaser. IIe is an imported article from Germany, and
has been a disgrace to the U. S. ever since he came. Bill is an exceptionally good
classsmate.
                         WILLIAM M. WALTHER,
                               Meadville, Pa.
    "Walt" has more knowledge of bowling than anyone else in -the class. He
can tell you when and where any team in the state is going to bowl. He is interested in it, because of the resemblance between a bowling ball and his head.
                         JOSEPH WAUGH WARD,
                                Bellevue, Pa.
    This boy has done a few stunts at W. &amp; J., but even after mingling with
them he seems-to prefer the good old Gold and Blue. He never refuses to give
anyone a chew-which certainly is not W. &amp; J. spirit.
                           HARRY WENTLEY,
                               Allegheny, Pa.
    It's only that name Wentley that keeps him going. But he should not be
blamed for anything considering his home town. Yet he is a fairly good fellow.
                        CHARLES HESS WERNER,
                                 Hays, Pa.
    "Eggy" either has brain fever or something else, or he may not have any
brains or--. Well, it is a puzzle. The only solution offered is to call him
nutty. One thing we are sure of-he is nice.
                          HARRY LEE WHITE,
                               Claysville, Pa.
    Here, sir, is a fine hot-air heater. He can also throw bird seed as far as anyone else in the class. The mocking bird can't whistle at all, compared with him.
He expects to star in an opera troupe some time.
                             FLOYD B. WICK,
                             West Sunbury, Pa.
    "Wickie" eats Mother's Bread and Pittsburg soot. Sometimes we wonder
why some fellows are here and then we wonder what they would do there. However, he is a fairly good fellow.
186
                         PURNIE JAMES WIGTON,
                                 Butler, Pa.
     "Wigs" is a peculiar youth. But he changes slightly for the better. HIe also
has his merits.
                            JOHN EARL WIRT,
                               Meadville, Pa.
    This man wears celluloid collars and stove(d) hats. He tried once to raise
a little garden on his upper lip, but the soil was too poor. Ile is a fellow of good
standing.
                          DAVID BOYER YOUNG,
                               Kittanning, Pa.
    Young is a prohibitionist in theory, but he never practices it by voting the
ticket. He is very studious and a likely fellow.
                        PETER JAMES ZAREMBA,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    "Pete" is one of the S. S. boys, who says he can lick any kitten on earth.
No doubt he can, though he may be kiddin'. He might be worse.
                        WILLIAM JOHN ZEIHER,
                               Pittsburg, Pa.
    Here is a worshiper of the professors, trembles when Saalbach opens his
(Saalbach's) mouth. Well, he will, no doubt, some day, get more spunk and
make faces at the professor-at his back. Aside from this unusual characteristic,
he is a good fellow, considering the crowd he is in.

trustees of the Western University of Pennsylvania. The association had incurred
an indebtedness of about $12,ooo and they recognized that to carry it on in the
interests of education and the advancement of science a fund must be raised to pay
the debt, and also raise a fund to endow a chair of astronomy in the university.
It was therefore proposed to raise the sum of $30,ooo, by which this desirable end
should be attained. The future usefulness of the observatory seemed to be fully
recognized by the board at that time, as the minutes of this (late are filled with
expressions of hope and prophecy regarding both the university and the observatory.
     A large majority of stockholders and contributors voted to convey their inter ests in the Observatory to the University, with the proviso that they were to be
 credited with the amount they had subscribed, and provided further that they
 should have the privileges formerly accorded them of making occasional use of the
 instruments, and provided still further that an endowment fund be raised and the
 property forever be held for observatory purposes. The Astronomical Association
 through its officers conveyed the observatory to the Western University on the
 first day of July, 1867. The records of this transfer cover many pages of the
 minute books of the Western University, and bear testimony to the care with which
 the transfer was made.
     On the 8th of August, 1867, Professor S. P. Langley was unanimously elected
to the chair of Astrononly and Physics.
     At this meeting it was resolved to equip the observatory with a transit instrument, chronograph, clocks, etc. The duties of the Professor of Astronomy were
also decided upon, in which it was to teach the classes in astronomy and physics
in the university, duties from which he was afterwards entirely released.
     At a meeting held June 8, 1869, it was decided to change the name of the Allegheny Observatory to "The Observatory of the Western University of Pennsylvania," but at the meeting of the board on the 4th of October of the same year the
motion to change the name was rescinded, and the old name retained.
     Subscriptions to the endowment fund and paying off the debt amounted at
this period to the sum of $i5,ooo, subscribed by Dr. Hussey, Hon. Thomas M.
Howe, Mr. William lhaw, Thomas A. Clark, Thomas Fawcett, Christopher Zug,
Chas. Knapp, James B. Lyon, Mr. Hostetter, Mr. Smith and General Cass. This
fund covered the indebtedness of the Astronomical Association, leaving a balance
of $3,000 toward the endowment fund, thus requiring $17,000 to complete the endowment of $20,000. This amount, so far as I have been able to find out, was
contributed by Mr. Thaw, who a few years afterwards also contributed $io0,ooo
to the University Fund.
     It was stipulated by Mr. Thaw that the director of the observatory should be
free from teaching in the university, except to deliver lectures at his convenience
and thus be free to carry on original research.
     From this time onward the institution took its place among the working observatories of the world. It would be impossible within the limits of this paper
to tell you more than a moiety of the splendid observations and discoveries made
by Professor Langley and his able assistants. The long series of solar observations, for which this region is so well suited, gave to the world new views of the
sun and its surroundings; and the series of magnificent drawings of sun spots
made by Professors Langley, Frost, Keeler and Mr. Very are now considered
classic and invaluable in our studies of solar phenomena.

                 Director of the Allegheny Observatory, 1867-1887.
                         By Joii~N ALFRED BRASHEAR.
         "The ilan of grand ipzulses sheds a lustre on all around him.''
            GREAT man has gone to his rest. A life filled with the highest aspi            rations has closed and we are left to mourn the loss of one whose
            place will be difficult to fill. The writer was associated with Pro            fessor Langley for more than thirty years, and in all those years he
            has only pleasant recollections of his personality and his magnificent
            intellect--on  never satisfied with a half-proven hypothesis, but alwavs reaching out for final proof before he announced any of his great discoveries.
     Not every man who came in contact with Professor Langley knew him as the
writer knew him. 1Many times he has walked for miles with him. During the
walk nothing wouild escape his mouth but monosyllables. Was he cold, indifferent, callous to the questioner? Far from it. Some difficult, perhaps intricate
problem in solar physics or other correlated study had taken possession of his mind
to the exclusion of all else, and I have often thought that his "yes" or "no" to my
questions were almhnost of an automatic character.
     But how different at other times, during our walks from the old observatory
to the nearest woods, where now is erected the new Astronomical Observatory.
Charming was his conversation from the beginning to the end of our stroll. When
in this mood no man could be more entertaining and instructive than Professor

         Her favorite author is Euclid,
         For novels she cares not a fig;
         She prefers "analytics" to dancing,
         And would go without dinner for "trig:"
         She loves to dilate on the unmarried state,
         The blessings of spinsterhood teaching,
         But her present deportment would lead us to think
         That her practise comes wide of her preaching.
                        MARION LINDSAY.
She sees the purple polkadots, and lines of red and blue
Upon a fungus that to us seems of a saffron hue.
As pioneer botanical, she easily leads the way,
Her finds computed averaging some twenty-five per day.
In euchre, bridge, and cribbage she'd give Hoyle new points on play,
She's a sharper, so she tells us, in the poker player's arts,
But we surmise, her interest in these pastimes really centers
In diversions such as "holding hands," or better, holding hearts.

     He feels called upon at seasons to explain things to the "coach,"

They're securely tied together by the strongest kind of tether,
And you'll never see the one without the other.

Langley-indeed, some of the most delightful remembrances of my long association with him come to me as I recall these delightful walks and talks.
     When he was writing his New Astronomy, he would invite me to come to the
 observatory in the evening and read to me a chapter of that splendid book. I call
 to mind the closing paragraphs of two that impressed me greatly, as he read them,
 and for fear that I may not quote verbatim I refer to his chapter on the Moon
 where, in closing his charming description of its scenery, he says, "Let us leave
 here the desolation about us, happy that we can come back at will to that world,
 our own familiar dwelling, where the meadows are still green and the birds still
 sing, and where, better yet, still dwells our own kind-surely the world of all we
 have found in our wanderings, which we would have chosen to be our home."
     Let me also quote the closing paragraph of his chapter on the Stars, which I
heard him read "in the long ago", a beautiful illustration of the life history of man
as compared to that of the Stars:
     "I have read somewhere a story about a race of ephemeral insects who live
about an hour. To those who are born in the early morning the sunrise is the time
of youth. They die of old age while his beams are yet gathering force, and only
their descendants live on to midday; while it is another race which sees the sun
decline, from that which saw him rise.  Imagine the sun about to set, and the
whole nation of mites gathered under the shadow of some mushroom (to them,
ancient as the sun itself) to hear what their wisest philosopher has to say of the
gloomy prospect. If I remember aright, he first told them that, incredible as it
might seem, there was not only a time in the world's youth when the mushroom
itself was young, but that the sun in those early ages was in the eastern, not in the
western sky. Since then, he explained, the eyes of scientific ephemera had followed it, and established by induction from vast experience the great'Law of Nature',
that it moved only westward; and he showed that since it was now nearing the
western horizon, science itself pointed to the conclusion that it was about to disappear forever, together with the great race of ephemera for whom it was created.
V.hat his hearers thought of this discourse I do not remember, but I have heard
that the sun rose again the next morning."
     Professor Langley was a lover of children. I have heard it from many
friends whose homes he visited, how he would gather the little ones around him
and tell them fairy stories, many of which he would improvise with wonderful tact
to please the children. A Washington lady had made several attempts to converse
with Professor Langley-at receptions-upon his scientific investigations but, failing to get the response desired, in her despair she asked him one evening what he
did like to talk about. He quickly replied, "Children and fairy stories."
    "The writer of this brief sketch of Professor Langley's life feels totally inadequate to the task, but deems it a great pleasure to place on record some of the lovely traits of character on the side of "the humanities," separate and distinct from his
scientific work--for with all that apparent "calmest coldness" there was something

  In a Perrysville car, if it e'er be your fate,
  To meet of a morning John Weber-you're late.
  His faith in the early bird story's infirm,
  And anyhow what use has he for a worm?
  In class he stands high, but finds leasure to shine,
  In gym work and track for old nineteen and nine.
             ROY LEECH WILLOCK.
O'er the class he presides, and what ever betides,
He keeps old'o9 in the van;
He is always at work, he don't know how to shirk,
On the Courant, he's a chief business man.
For the hurdles and track he possesses a knack,
And also a pride justifiable;
He's a foe to all fakes, and the statements he makes
Will be found to be always reliable.

     Ile's possessed of a serious, sober mentality;
     His basketball skill he delighteth to show,
     But he steps on himself when attempting to throw.
                   FREDERIC JACOB WALLACE.
 Have you heard of Frederic Wallace,
 He the wonderful, sweet singer,
 Who adorneth with his presence
 All the concerts of the Glee Club, all the meetings of the choir?
 Who delighteth not in raiment of the coarser common nature,
 But doth sport his rich tuxedo, matter not what the occasion,
 He it is who gives new courage to the squeaky coed choir,
 And with patience tries to follow the wild chords of Big Chief Berger.
 Quiet, studious, friendly, loyal,
.Is this gallant singer, Wallace.

    The Class of T19I Meds will go down in history as being the first to encounter the wave of reform, which is pervading all America, and has also entered our portals. Scarcely had the class been organized and down to work,
ere we hear rumors bearing the startling intelligence of anti-ponying. Some
were wont to discredit it, others through fear awaited patiently for the culmination of events, which proved to us that the rumors were true, alas! Had we
met our waterloo? Decidedly no. We proved that in spite of the reform, we
were still able to come out and say, "We have met the enemy and they are ours."
Eut the greater reward came when some of the professors handed out the gratifying words that in point of intelligence the Freshman Class of 1907 ranks higher than many in recent years.
    Athletically the Meds of 1910 have maintained a high standard. The class
has furnished men for the football, basketball and hockey teams, and they
carl,ed their right to permanent places in the teams: and we also have men who
ace capable of twirling the ball or swinging the big stick.
    The class also scores a point on its cosmopolitan showing, being able to
furnish Swedes, Hleines, HIunkies, Dagos, Switzers, Swein Kopfs, Reporters and
one man from Steubenville, but it is not his fault that he is here; his father is
a graduate of an Ohio'varsity, but the son comes to W. U. P. because "pop"
vows it is the best medical college between the Missouri and the Blue Ridge.
That's going some, but then the spirit of the times teaches speed, and the Freshmen NMeds have some to give away. Just ask our friend Snapper Johnston and
you will get a convincing reply.
     One deplorable feature of the first year class, and one we feel sharply, and
all deeply regret, is the number of our class who fell victims to disease. Sev215
eral were compelled to drop out for this session. Fever clutched over half a
dozen. Every fever case that develops is only another bell ringing out its warning, and brings back the words of our professor in hygiene most forcibly, when
he warned us not to drink any water out of the spigots in the college. Incident-lly an upper classman has been looking up an alleged law requiring colleges to
furnish'filtered water for their students. He is still searching, and the boys are
still drinking (water out of the spigots).
     Now the social standing of the Freshman Meds. How could our prospects
be other than the best in the college when we have six young ladies in our class
whom the god of beauty has so lavishly blessed, as to cause the beauti seexers of the upper classes to loiter around our doors, and ever and anon walk up
the hill, wrapped in sweet communion, or, if perchance it is icy, lending a willing arm to avoid accidents? But, however this may be, we will forgive them, for
even the Profs are not averse to bestowing a smile or two to enlighten their
paths. Just the same they belong to the Freshman Class, and we exercise no
liberties when we call them "Our Girls."
     But now we must not forget to say a word in behalf of our worthy officers.
 First our President,- Mr. A. R. Cratty, a man of intrinsic value, a man who is
 thoroughly posted on all points, capable of meeting all obstacles and overcoming
 them, a man who can make a speech that would still the flowery tongue of a
 Demosthenes or a Cicero, and whose judicial ability would have startled Black stone.
     Our Vice-President, Mr. Hayden, a man with an iron will, which renders
him capable of controlling the class even better than our friend Dr. Dickey, and
that perpetual smile and ever-ready humor puts one in mind of Mark Twain.
     Now as for our Secretary, Miss Dranga, who has so carefully guarded the
class interests and burned midnight oil writing up details of meetings. Truly,
President Roosevelt could be proud to have such an one for Secretary of his
Cabinet. For me to mention any.more of her glowing acquirements is useless,
for she needs no eulogy; she speaks for herself.
    Last but not least our Treasurer, Dr. Paul Livingston. I need only mention his name, his ability as an extemporaneous speaker has won for him a fame
as lasting as.the hills. His ability also in matters of pecuniary moment could not
be excelled, his methods even surpassing those of J. P. Morgan.

Freshman Class, Collegiate and Engineering
reaching almost to the transcendental in his inner life which my long acquaintance
and association brought to light. I have given but a few instances of these pleasant reminiscences, instances which could be multiplied many times.
    Professor Langley came by invitation to the Allegheny Observatory in 1867.
Two years afterwards, in 1869, he introduced standard time distribution to the
cities and railroads. Professor Langley made good use of the income derived
from the time service, for the commencement of that long series of solar researches
which have added so much to our knowledge of the sun. He was an exquisite
draughtsman, as can be testified by the hundreds of beautiful drawings of solar
phenomena made by him. Every student of astronomy has seen reproductions of
his charming drawing of the great sun-spot of December, 1873, which has indeed
become classic as a "typical" sun-spot.
     Fortunately for Professor Langley's great work of the future, William Thaw,
the staunch friend of the observatory and one of the pioneers in its construction
and equipment, became deeply interested in the director's solar work, and aided
him in many ways. The income of the observatory was so limited that little could
be done in experimental research until William Thaw with a most liberal hand and
heart provided the means for carrying on this great work, and you will find at the
close of almost every monograph written by Professor Langley, "This research
was made possible through the liberality of a citizen of Pittsburgh."  By Mr.
Thaw's request his name was never mentioned.
     In his studies in the domain of solar physics, Professor L.angley was early
impressed with the idea that much of the radiant energy from the sun was not recognized by the instruments then in use, anc&amp;after a long series of experiments, discovered and developed that marvelously delicate instrument, the bolometer. With
the bolometer a series of investigations were commenced upon the sun, moon and
stars, which were continued for many years, bringing to light some of the most
important facts in the whole realm of astronomical physics.
     Professor Langley, with his assistants, Professor Keeler, Professor Very, and
Mr. Page, continued the study of the hitherto unknown region of solar radiation
until the bolographic chart, reaching far down into the spectrum, and showing
almost innumerable curves of selective absorption, was given to the world as a
most valuable contribution to our knowledge of radiant energy.
    After years of study at Allegheny upon the problem of selective absorption of
the earth's atmosphere at the lower levels, Professor Langley desired to make a
similar investigation at a very high altitude. The top of Mt. Whitney in southern
California was selected, as well as a station about two miles below the peak. William Thaw provided most of the means for the now famous expedition, our own
government also sharing in the expenses of the research. Professor Keeler and
Dr. William Day assisted Professor Langley in the work of this expedition, the
results of which have now become classic; indeed, have to a large degree settled the
problem of the selective absorption of the earth's atmosphere in its relation to the

sun's radiant energy, and the intimately correlated problem of life upon our globe.
Professor Langley found time to study many minor though important questions
bearing upon radiant energy, not alone from the sun but from other sources. His
studies of the moon's temperature added immensely to our knowledge of the "lesser
light that rules the night."  With the spectrobolometer, the highest temperature of
the moon was found to be about zero centigrade, and the lowest temperature not
far from the temperature of space.
     Professor Langley's work in mapping the invisible spectrum was a herculean
 task. Aided by Professors Keeler, Very and Page, thousands of measurements
 were made with the spectrobolometer and read visually before the photographic
 method was devised and developed so beautifully by Professor Langley and his co workers at the Smithsonian Institute.
     Professor Langley received many honors during his life time. To be called
as the successor of Professor Baird as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was
the highest gift in a scientific sense that could be conferred upon him by his country. Oxford conferred upon him the degree of D. C. L.; Cambridge, the degree
of D. Sc.; Harvard, Princeton, University of Michigan and the University of
Wisconsin conferred upon him the degree of LL.D. He was a correspondent of the
French Academy, a Foreign Member of the Royal Society, a Fellow of the Royal
Astronomical Society and other scientific associations. IHe received the Henry
Draper, Count Rumford, Janssen and other medals for his splendid discoveries.
    Professor Langley was born in Roxbury, Mass., August 22, 1834. On the
twenty-second of November, 1905, he suffered a slight stroke of paralysis but recovered sufficiently to be taken to Aiken, South Carolina. Great hopes were entertained that his recovery was only a matter of time, but it was not so to be. He
passed away to the "Summer Land of Song" on the 27th day of February, I9o6.
His body was brought to Washington and the funeral services held in All Souls
Church. The venerable Edward Everett Hale, an old time friend of Professor
Langley, spoke most fitting and kindly words at the brief services. The regents of
the Smithsonian Institution acted as honorary pall-bearers, and the members of the
Smithsonian staff as active pall-bearers. The remains were taken to Boston in a
private car, and were laid away in Forest Hills Cemetery by the side of his mother.
A short address was delivered at the cemetery by his friend, Alexander Grahan!
Bell, in which he gave a brief resumi of Professor Langley's life work.
    When Napoleon stood at the edge of a great battlefield where a great victory
had been won by his soldiers, his ears were (leaf to the cries of the wounded and
dying; he heard them not, but said to his generals, in the ecstacy of victory:
                             "C'est magnifique".
    When our own Langley stood on the summit of the old Allegheny hills where
so much of his life work had been done, and watched the sun setting in all his
glory, we heard him exclaim, "It is magnificent". Now that he is gone, and we

    Charles H. Robinson, the janitor of the Collegiate and Engineering Departiments, passed from this life on Tuesday, March 8, 1907.
    A short time before his death the students sent him something to remember
them by till he should return to his place. When he received the gift ie expressed hearty appreciation, then told of his work for the University and the stu--
dents, showing aspirations and Christian ideals worthy of a man of far greater
opportunities.
    "I have faithfully in all my twenty-five years of service tried to be ready and
willing, gentlemen, to do what I could for every student. Ithink I state the truth,
gentlemen, when I say that I was always as ready to do a favor for one student
as for another. I sought earnestly to be as much help as possible and never a
hindrance."
    While he (lid have a love for fine words, he had far more a love for that which
is beyond words. His heart was loyal in the service he gave us and our hearts
will ever hold him in loving remembrance.

look over the fields of science where he has won his grand but bloodless victories,
we can but add our final tribute by repeating the words,
                              "It is magnificent".
                    PROFESSOR LANGLEY'S FLYING MACHINE.
     (Professor Langley began his work on flying-machines while director of the
Allegheny Observatory. There are said to be some remains of his machinery in
the cellar of the old building. So we claim some of the honor of the final results
and feel an interest in them. His honor is ours.-Editor.)
       (From the American Magazine, April, 1907-Herbert N. Casson.)
     Then came a great American who lifted the whole matter (of flying) to a
higher level-S. P. Langley. Langley stood at the head of the Smithsonian Institution. He was officially and by merit one of the most eminent scientists of the
world. He was spangled with medals and honors. Yet he staked all his prestige
on the chance of succeeding where Maxim and Ader had failed.
    The master passion of Langley's life was to fly. While playing in a meadow
near Boston one day, he saw high overhead a soaring hawk, hovering and gliding
in smooth circles through the upper air. The boy Langley was fascinated. How
glorious, he thought, to be a bird! And forty years later the scientist Langley was
still under the spell of that feathered wizard of the sky.
     lie began the most thorough and scientific study of birds that had ever been
undertaken. It had been stated by Sir Isaac Newton, and generally believed, that
a large bird required relatively more energy than a small one. Langley found that
this was absurdly untrue. A condor, for instance, has only one-fourth as much
wing per pound as a little screech-owl. A flamingo has one-third as much as a
raven. The two extremes of the bird world, in fact, are the big, lazy albatross,
who soars easily on 3,000 mile journeys, and the tiny humming-bird, whose small
body is a throbbing dynamo of energy. The one is all sail like a four-masted
schooner; the other is all engine, like a gasoline launch.
    Then L.angley went to the museums and studied the pterodactyl-the greatest
of all flying machines. As a flying-machine, this gigantic bat, with its twenty-foot
wings, was Nature's masterpiece. At the pterodactyl Nature stopped and man
must begin. Yet this air-king, so Langley found, had only one-twentieth of a
horsepower to drive his thirty pound body against the wind.
    With these facts to encourage him, Langley proceeded to make an artificial
pterodactyl. And so it came to pass, several months later, that a gray-haired
scientist stood on the banks of the Potomac and saw his steel-and-canvas bird
rise high in the air and fly for a mile with as much ease as though it were a living
creature. The machine was one-fourth the linear dimension of the larger machine afterwards built and was driven by a one-and-a-half horsepower engine.
This flight was the first ever made by a real flying-machine and it proved that human flight is possible.

     Then the U. S. War Department accepted Langley's invitation, and came into
the flying business. At a cost of $50,ooo, a large machine was built on the same
lines as the small one, and Langley believed that the dream of his boyhood was
about to come true. But in some way the big machine was not launched properly.
It never had a chance to fly. Down it went into the waters of the Potomac. The
Aerodrome was not demolished but is practically in complete condition for flight,
except in the lack of suitable supporting surfaces. Charles M. Manly, who was
Professor Langley's chief assistant, is expecting very soon to find the time to provide the machine with such surfaces and give it a fair trial, when he believes it
will prove successful and crown Mr. Langley's work with the success which it so
richly deserves. A laugh went around the world at "Langley's Folly," and not
long afterward the great pathfinder died of a broken heart.
     The ridicule had no effect upon his beliefs. He knew that others would complete what he and Maxim and Ader had begun. His last word, written just before his death, was a prophecy of success. "The great universal highway overhead," he said, "is now soon to be opened."
                PROF. JAMES EDWARD KEELER
                            DIRECTOR (89gI-I898)
                     From address by Dr. John A. Brashear
           N MAY, 189g, Prof. Keeler was unanimously elected to the director             ship of the Allegheny Observatory, a position he at once accepted.
             When Prof. Keeler came to Allegheny he found the observatory
             poorly equipped for the line of investigation he desired to pursue as
a continuation,of his work at Lick Observatory, but friends of the institution and
Prof. Keeler soon furnished the means. Mrs. William Thaw contributed the
money to construct a spectroscope of the highest type, which was designed by
Pro. Keeler. Mr. Williain Thaw, Jr., supplied the means for a new driving clock
and the remounting of the 13-inch equatorial, while the Junta Club of Pittsburgh
generously donated a sum sufficient to place a modern shutter on the dome.
Thus equipped, Prof. Keeler commenced a seris of researches by which, in the
years he was with us, some of the most brilliant discoveries ever made in astronomical science were added to those he had already given to the world.
    Of the 62 papers he contributed to various scientific journals dluring his directorate perhaps the most important ones are those which we have numbered 120 and
121 in the transactions of the observatory. No. 12o refers to his spectroscopic
studv of the constitution of Saturn's rings; No. 12[ a paper on a spectroscopic
proof of the meteoric constitution of Saturn's rings. Had he made no other discovery than this solution of the character of Saturn's rings, his name would forever be remembered in the annals of scientific discovery, for the mathematicians,

physicists and astronomers of centuries had labored in vain to solve the problem,
which, with his keen intellect, his methods of precision, his marvelous ability to
make his instrumental equipment do his bidding enabled him to solve the mystery
and establish the theory of Doppler on a still more secure foundation.
     It would be imnpossible, in the limits of this paper, to tell you of the splendid
achievements iln the domain of astro-physics of our departed friend, for since this
new temple of the skies began to rise from its foundation his spirit has taken its
flight to dwell among the stars he loved so fondly. Socially, Mr. Keeler was a
most charming man, and as a scientific investigator he was of the highest type, ever
ready, ever willing to help the earnest student over the rough ways that here and
there lay before him. Thousands of our people have enjoyed his Thursday night
receptions at the observatory, and he was one of the first to suggest that if we
should have a new observatory, one department should be erected that should be
forever free to the people, so that they, too, might enjoy the beauties of the skies.
     Professor Keeler was elected director of the Lick Observatory in the spring
of 1898. He did,not wish to leave us; social and scientific associations, ties of
friendship bound him to us closely and had we succeeded in raising a fund large
enough to build a new observatory on this beautiful spot, which had been secured
long before he left us, I do not think that even the great attractions of that ideal
observatory on the summit of Mount Hamilton would have been sufficient to take
him from us; but the breaking out of the Spanish-American war and the excitement associated with it prevented for the time being the successful issue of the
important enterprise. Notwithstanding all this, Professor Keeler hesitated as long
as he could, with courtesy to the Lick trustees, and only accepted the position when
the time limit was reached. The two years since his acceptance of the directorate
of the great mountain observatory were replete with success, and we lovingly
place under this cornerstone a record of the last and one of the most important discoveries he had yet made; indeed in a recent letter to me he modestly mentioned it
as the greatest discovery of his life, namely, that the normal condition of the greater
number of nebulae are spirals.,
     But he has gone from among us leaving a loving companion and two bright
children to honor his memory.
                "Death makes no conquest of the conqueror
                For now he lives in fame though not in life."

                 THE NEW OBSERVATORY
       From Address by Dr. Holland at the Laying of the Cornerstone
                 of the New Observatory, October 20, 1900
    Today we mark a new era in the history of the observatory. We lay to-day
the cornerstone of an institution that will wrest from the blue skies knowledge for
all. The new observatory will be as far above the old one as the twentieth century
will be ahead of the nineteenth in science and invention.
    When I came to Pittsburgh it was but a small place. It was very thrifty and
decidedly religious. It was a manufacturing center, and although there were
many who had taste and education for the higher arts, the city in general had no
use for it. But I have seen the change. Pittsburgh is rapidly becoming a center
of art, of music and of science, and it is becoming known all over the world. It
was known before for its industries, now as an educated city, and in a few years it
will be ranked among the educated cities of the world.
    A few weeks ago I was in Malta and met there a British officer. I told him I
came from Allegheny. He thought for a moment, scratched his head and said,
"Oh, yes; I know Allegheny; it has a fine observatory-and, by the way, isn't there
a town called Pittsburgh near it?" So, you see, the fame of the Allegheny Observatory has spread, and, now that we are to have a finer and better one, the world
will be brought closer in contact with the little city of Allegheny.
                 THE NEW ALLEGHENY OBSERVATORY
          By DR. FRANK SCHLESINGER, B. S., A. AI., PH.D., DIRECTOR.
     No other country is so well supplied with telescopes as our own. Not only
do the largest refracting telescopes look out upon the heavens from American observatories, but the largest reflectors as well have found homes among us. Of
moderate sized instruments we have nearly as many as all the countries of Europe
combined.'M any of these smaller instruments are to be found on the college or
university campus and are used largely for the purpose of instruction by astrono20

imers whose chief concern is education. Thus there are not more than six or seven
of our observatories in which our knowledge of matters astronomical is being advanced to any considerable degree. Our own observatory in Riverview i'ark will
be completely equipped in a year or so at the most. If by that time means are
forthcoming, as we have every reason to hope, for adequate maintenance, our observatory will be entitled to rank with the best in this country and abroad.
    Thel principal instrument at present in actual use at the new observatory is the
Keeler telescope, erected as a memorial to our late director by his many friends in
Pittsburgh and Allegheny. Both its optical and mechanical parts were made by
the Brashear Company. It is a reflecting telescope; i. e., the light from the heavenly body we are examining does not pass directly through a lens as in the refracting telescope, but is reflected from a silver film deposited on appropriately shaped
surfaces of glass discs. The Keeler telescope can be used in several forms. Last
year it was employed in the so called Newtonian form, the principal advantage of
which is in photographing faint surfaces. One of the pieces of work on which the
director is engaged is the measurement and discussion, with Mr. Baker's assistance,
of photographic plates for the purpose of determining the suitability of this form

    The Courant is the monthly publication of the University students, the only
means of union between the departments. Editors elected by the students have
kept the paper going for eighteen years and those elected this year are conducting it through the nineteenth in a way creditable to them. If the paper continues
to improve and grow in the next two years as it has this year, it will be fine
enough for any University when it becomes of age.

of telescope for the exact determination of positions. Another form in which this
telescope can be used is known as the Cassegrainian, which is particularly adapted
to spectroscopic purposes. A fine spectrograph, the gift of Mr. Andrew Mellon,
has lately been made by the Brashear Colnpany after designs made by the director
and Dr. Curtiss, to be used in connection with the Keeler telescope. The spectrograph enables us to analyze the light of the stars; to say what they are composed
of and what their physical condition is; and particularly, to determine whether they
are moving toward or from us and at what speed. The principal work with this
spectrograph consists in observing variable stars; that is, those that are fainter at
some times than at others, those which alternately approach and recede from us.
Many photographs have already been secured and are now being measured. They
can hardly fail to yield results of interest and importance.
     A large solar sceptroscope, also to be used with thze Keeler telescope, was presented to the observatory by the Honorable H. K. Porter. This is not quite complete but it is expected that it will be in operation by July next. The work planned
for this instrument includes a determination of the rotation of the sun and a study
of sun-spot phenomena. The latter is a field in w-hich much has been sowni and
but little reaped. In spite of three centuries of investigation we know little of the

 As its name implies, the purpose of the Club is political, although, of course, it
 is not actuated by any partisan purposes. Questions of economic, political and so ciological importance are discussed at the meetings and great interest is manifested
 in vital questions of the day.
     The Political Club is considering seriously the plan of entering the great Fed eration of Political Clubs, which embraces all the larger universities and colleges
 in the United States.

          THE GLEE, BANJO AND MANDOLIN CLUBS OF Igo6-07.
    Never before in the history of the Western University of Pennsylvania has
there been such a successful aggregation of musicians representing the higher
arts of their alma mater. From the first rehearsal on, there has been displayed
the highest interest and spirit, on the part of the boys, to make another grand
success, as was the club of 1905-O6. Director Sulzner has selected the best music to be had, that full of snap and college spirit and having a harmonious air,
which is taken care of by the host of good voices and well-handled instruments.
There has not beeni a concert held around Greater Pittsburg by any college clubs
that could take a stand with the W. U. P1. concert held at Carnegie Hall this
year. This shows that these clubs well deserve the praise of the University and
alumni, for they hold up the school's reputation for being an institution full of
talent, as well as skill. The day is near at hand when every good undertaking
madle under the Old Gold and Blue shall be crowned with success. It is readily
seen that the outside world is beginning to believe the same, for every place the
Club goes, it is welcomed with crowded houses, and houses full of spirit and
goo,d feeling.
    So far this year the club has given entertainments at New Castle, Sharon,
Carnegie THall, Pittsburg, Leechburg, Vandergrift, Allegheny, Pennsylvania College for Women, Castle Shannon and Wilkinsburg.

true character or cause of sun-spots. This problem seems to transcend the powers
of a single observatory, but it is well worth the concerted attack of many workers.
    At the west end of the observatory is a fine transit house, the funds for which
are donated by the Misses Smith. In it is mounted the transit instrument that
stood in the old observatory;, and our two clocks, used in connection with this instrumnent, are finely mounted in the main building. These instruments are still
doing the work they began nearly forty years ago-providing time to the Pennsylvania railroad, to the two cities and to other subscribers. The observations for
this purpose are now made by Mr. Baker.
The 4-inch Transit Instrument
    The 13-inch telescope that was so long the principal instrument in the old
observatory and with which Langley and Keeler wrought so well, is now under the
southeast dome. It is used at present for the entertainment of visitors. An attachment is'being made by which the sun's surface may be regularly photographed.
    Under the large dome at the west end of the observatory will be placed our
principal instrument, a refracting telescope of thirty inches aperture, and forty-five
feet long. TIis telescope is being made for us at the Brashear shops and will

probably be completed in the fall of i9o8. With so large a telescope many lines
of work are possible, but there is one kind for which it will be unsurpassed-the
determination of the distances of the stars. This is a problem which demands
solution more pressingly than any other in sidereal astronomy. While at the
Yerkes Observatory the writer was fortunate in being able to employ a method for
this purpose that seems to be more accurate than those formerly in use. This work
will be taken up with the new telescope as soon as it is put into commission.
     I cannot conclude this brief and inadequate account of our observatory with out a word of gratitude to the many friends who have come forward to make it
 what is it; and particularly to Dr. Brashear, to whose devotion to astronomical
 science this new observatory is in a sense a monument. This, feeling of gratitude
 and the examples furnished in abundance in the history of the observatory cannot
 fail to be powerful incentives to the present staff of the observatory for the best
 work that in them lies.

    Recollections of the Old Observatory
                        BY DR. ALi,wRT ELLIs FROST.
           ULY 6th, 1872, was a very hot day. In the hottest part of it I caught
             a first glimpse of the dome of the Alleghen )Observatory from the
             Pittsburgh end of the Sixth street bridge.   The distance looked
             wearisome to a tired traveler from the East, but the course up Fed             eral street and so on and out was plain enough. Equally plain was
the method of getting there-walking.
     I arrived at length to see this-a dometl center throwing out a wing east and
west and an excavation for the first addition, completed before winter. It was a
modest plant, indeed, but already marketing its product, supplying correct time to
cities and railroads on a more extensive scale than anywhere else in the country.
     There was a serious interruption of somne months to observation with the equatorial, then one of the great telescopes of the country. The object glass was stolen
in the night, early in July, but fortunately was recovered in fair shape.  After
necessary repairs it was again put in place and work on the sun was resumed,
drawing spots and making a beginning of the investigations on solar radiation, with
the thermopile. The day of the bolometer, the photograph and the great spectroscope had not arrived; but the best that could be (lone anywhere was being tlone
here. Witness, for example, Professor Langley's now classical drawing of a typical sun-spot, a composite of sketches and drawings made by him with the eye at the
telescone. This is in brief the record for the three years to Sept., 1875, when my
personal relation to the work closed.
     But reminiscence is requested rather than history. On the first occasion of
meeting the best individual friend the University has ever had, during the first
summer, a remark of his was a play upon names, "Strange to have on the same
tlay, and in August, a Thaw and a Frost so near together."
     I first met that good friend of the University, and of everybody, Dr. Brashear,
looking up, if memory serves me rightly, Rutherford's papers on silver-glass specula. I do not recall the "muddy boots" or "red bandana" of his own story of a
visit, probably another occasion.
     The district round about was sparsely settled, country, in fact. Migratory and
predatory cows made rather easy entrance to the acres of pasturage about and belonging to the observatory reserves, often at an unreliable gate about where the
stone steps at the foot of the path to the university now are. This was an abomination to the director, Dr. Langley; and the present campus was at an early day
307
dedicated to the chase and the race, by the activities of the writer, in connection
with the aforesaid cattle, in promoting their vacation of the premises. It was afterwards recorded that the bolometer could easily and accurately indicate the radiations from the body of a cow at a considerable distance. If the experiment was
ever actually tried, the distance must have been great or the test made by another
than the director.
     "The urban owner of a cow coveted our domain for a pasture, and for hire.
In the absence of the director, he first consulted with the assistant, stating his
wishes. He, lacking original authority, suggested writing to the absent director.
Several weeks later the correspondence is shown to the assistant. His self-esteem,
the very natural feeling of an A. B. of but a few weeks' standing, is violently assailedl-the seeker after pasture privileges refers jauntily to him as "the boy." The
shock almost killed-i"Mother."
     A book of quips and jibes may perhaps find place for things like this without
disturbing the general plan. We meet for the serious consideration of affairs as a
rule, but the motley may be donned on occasion, and occasionally. The bird of
wisdom with solemn open eves needs but the partial dropping of one lid to change
portentous gravity to a sign of recognition of the lighter side of things.

    A   Flying    Trip Through the Medical Department
    The Guide meets the party at 28th and Liberty just as they are alighting
from the Express. The Guide, of course, takes charge immediately, and they
start up the hill.
    This is about the manner in which things were explained.
    "Now, ladies and gentlemen, after we plow through the smoke and dirt on
this bridge we will have only about a mile to go to reach the scho'ol. Of course.
the Railways Company would have cars running up to school for the use of the
ten thousand students, but the faculty thinks the walk will do the boys a heap
of gool.
    "What did you say? Oh, no! that is not the school, that is the West Penn
Hospital; these buildings were too small for the school, so we had to find other
quarters.
    "Do not get excited, madam, it is not going to rain. This is sunshine
weather up here. What you have taken for rain clouds is simply clean simoke
frorm the mills and the thousand locomotives over the hill.
    "Now if you will kindly get into this boat. the captain will land us safely
on the other side of this mud puddle.
    "Ladies and gentlemen, you are now before the famous Medical Department of the Western University of Pennsylvania.
    "What's that? I should say it is not a jail, that stone wall is intended to
keep the stiffs from getting away, for they get strong sometimes; as for the
students, it is hard to chase them home in the evening after school hours, especially after listening to one of Dr. Ingram's three-hour lectures.
    "The buildings you hear across the street and a little way up the avenue
are Fraternity Houses, and contain consignments of Bedlam's excess.
    "Now if you will kindly follow me, we will pass through this magnificent
docrway to the inside of the building. No, madam, there is no slmoke house
connected with the college, that odor is due to creosote, used in the Pathological
Laboratory which you will notice just to the right. In this room the boys spend
hours looking through microscopes, but never see anything.
     "To the left you will find the nearest thing to a smoke house connected
with the school. This room is intended for the students, in which to while away
their many leisure hours, smoking, chewing, eating or playing gamnes. You will
notice the fine outlay of furniture in this room.
309
     "Passing up this short flight of stairs you will notice the boiler house and
cold storage plant. The storage plant is at the rear of this room and in it, each
occupying a separate berth, are our silent friends. The balance of the room is
used as a boiler house. This, of course, is a sham, for there is plenty of hot air
ger,erated throughout the building.
     "We will now pass up this flight of stairs, and just before you is our magnificent postoffice (daily circulation, io,ooo letters). Around this corner to thleft is another Pathological Laboratory. In this room the Freshmen show Dr.
Ingrami how to mount specimens.
     "Across the way is the Chemical Laboratory, the bee-hive of the College.
In here the boys remove their coats, roll up their sleeves and get down to work,
making nice colored mixtures and lots of suffocating fumes. The gentleman you
see in the midst of that crowd of young men, explaining some intricate problem, is Prof. Koch. This is the third time he has explained the problem and is
williing to repeat his explanation, if they (do not understand it.
    "The gentleman with the stern look and wearing glasses, whom you will
notice at this end of the room, is Prof. Judd. No, he is not angry, that is just
his natural expression.
    "Around this corner is the Chemical Hall, in which are given lectures in
Chemistry and other studies. You may think that black-board is a large one,
but it is often too small for some of Prof. Koch's outlines.
    "We will now continue up to the second floor and here you will notice thMehl, McCullough &amp; Laurent book stores. In buying books here be careful of
these sharks. Here you will also notice the bulletin board. It is possible the notices pinned to the board were straight and neat once upon a time, but they are
now so many years old and the boys so often take exception to the neatness of
the board that they have taken all shapes and colors.
    "Next we come to the Big Room. You will notice the boys have on their
overcoats and collars turned up. This is the ice box of the school. It is always
ten degrees below Zero in here. The chairs in this room are of the latest collapsable style (at least one a day collapses). These chairs are of good quality,
at least they ought to be; the students of each class for the last five years have
paid a dollar or two apiece for them.
     "We now come to the Office and, ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce
'Snapper' Johnston, Superintendent, Ways and Means Department, for the running of school, also Miss Cahill, our stenographer. Although many of the students are at odds with'Snapper,' he, nevertheless, is a fine old gentleman, and he
must be strict at times, so as to keep the building on its foundation.
    "Passing out this way we come to the notorious Amphitheatre. The continued droll sound you hear is Dr. Ingram delivering a lecture to the Junior
class. Allow me to introduce Dr. Ingram, the guiding star of every Fresh310
1man class. You will notice the seats in this room are of the finest upholstered
variety and are very comfortable. Each seat, also, has an arm rest, on which
to lay your note book when taking notes.
    "lPassing through this room and around this hall-way we come to the Phar--
maceutical Laboratory where, every Thursday morning, the Freshmen give a concert under the leadership of Dr. Wesley.
    "Passing up these stairs we come to the Dissecting Room. Walk right in,
no one will say anything, they are all dead ones in here. You will notice the
pleasant odor in this room, also take especial notice of the fine sanitary equipment.
     "We now come to the attic, and in this room, the Pathological Laboratory.
Dr. Rhodes teaches the Sophs and Freshies how to stimulate the periphery. In
the other part of the attic is the Bacteriological Laboratory, where the Sophs
learn how to cook. Their bill of fare ranges from bouillon to baked Bacillus
Typhosus. That little machine over there is the Autoclav. It was originally
brought up here for the reason that when it blows up it will not have to travel
so far to reach the roof.
     "Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have completed our tour through the Medi cal Department, and I hope you have enjoyed it. In the near future we hope
 to be settled in our new quarters in the heart of the City, and we would be glad
 to have you come to see us. 0, don't mention it. Glad to have been of ser vice. Good-bye."
                     TO THE BOY DENTIST
             The great Boy Dentist he's always called,
               And he this names deserves,
             For he is busy up at school
               His work--he teeth preserves.
             He goes to the Pittsburg Dental School,
               Is a studious little lad;
             He knows his books from front to back
                So well-well, we all feel sad.
             Mere Physiology seems his cinch,
               And Anatomy the same.
             He says Materia Medica
                To him is really tame.
311
Of Chemistry-we need hardly state,
   He knows that through and through,
 And Modern Science he knows all about,
   Organic and In-ditto, too.
 Hle has Infirmary work, I've heard,
   That is mnighty hard to beat;
 He does the work both well and fast
   And, best of all, it is always neat.
 He manufactures bridges and crowns
   And can make the finest plate;
 He fills your teeth with gold and cement,
   And does it while you wait.
 He fills your teeth both front and back,
   Chock-a block and full.
 Then taking his profession's way,
   Your leg he'll always pull.
 When he makes a plate it is always good,
   This, of course, we must admit;
 And guarantees your money back,
   If the plate happens not to fit.
He pulls out teeth-it's funny, too,
   Why he always likes it so.
But many think it is not the deed,
   But that he likes the-Dough.
I will tell you a secret about this boy  He's the prize man of our class;
And this is the means of his being such  He cares nought (alas!) for a lass.
                       Moral.
If you wish to make a success of life
  And would conquer this world with all its strife,
IIeed not the winning ways of girls,
  But keep your head from harmful whirls.
If you take this advice you will always be
  A model of simplicity;
Your mind will be as bright as a star,
  You will never fear "Old Billy Carr."
And this, you know, is all we want
  To pass "Old Billy" our daily haunt.

                EXPERIMENT No. 1001
     (Written especially for the benefit of K. M. Smith, the only married man in
the class.)
     Object.-To find the efficiency of a washing machine.
     leeierences.-K. M. Smith, vol. 3, page 96o; J. E. Knott, page 300, par. 23;
C. A. Boddie's Handbook of Domestic Science, part I, pages I8-25; Shriver's
Household Economy, par. 82.
    Apparatus.-Washing machine, Io pairs greasy overalls, 3 blankets, 4 pairs
pajamas, 6 bright red undershirts, Allegheny River water, a good strong arm or
perpetual motion machine.
     Theory.-The efficiency of any machine is equal to the power output - the
power input. The input is measured by the soreness of the operator's arm, the
output by the number of whole pieces left.
     If x=no. of overalls,
       y=no. of pairs of pajamas,
       z=no. of undershirts,
then (x + Y + z)K,= efficiency, where K,=friction co-efficient depending on make
         S (arm)
of machine and S (arm)=soreness of arm (measured in ergs).
     Instructions:-Get up at 5:30 A. M. Thaw out the pipes and draw Allegheny River water. Examine carefully all parts of the machine and oil all bearings (to avoid overheating). Place all the clothes lying around in the machine,
and after making sure that all connections are connected, turn the crank with a
right-handed screw motion (or in counter clockwise direction). Care must be
taken not to stop the machine during the operation. If the machine shows a tendencv to slow down, reverse direction of driving maintaining a constant torque
an'l the machine will run normal. Should the load prove excessive, stop the machine immediately by some means and call your wife. Take readings every fifteen seconds (observing color of water, stiffness in arm, etc.) and record. Plot
the curve of efficiencies for all loads and at all speeds, using ordinates for loads
and abscissas for speed. Plot another curve using for ordinates the washing
mnachine and for abscissas an Irish washwoman. If the efficiency falls below 75',
the machine must be discarded.
     (Note.) In all experiments of this kind, the stray power loss due to fric tion, windage, cussing and general profanity must be taken into account.

    Discussions.-K. M. Smith, page 83, par. 24, asserts that his wife claim.;
"that the machine is most efficient when carrying a considerable overload and
driven at high speed," a statement which he himself denies.
    On the other hand, Boddie's Handbook shows a mathematical demonstration
of the efficiency. The work done in any instant is equal to X cos Ods, where X
is constant force impressed oil crank, 0 is angle through which the crank has
turned, and ds=distance moved in the infinitesimal instant of time.
                      ds2 = V dx2 -dy"
                  Hence work done =ffx cos 1P V dx2   dy
                  Then W=   0 fS    x cos 0 V dx+ x2da
                                                     a   x2
     Integrating and substituting
     W--2 nr x, for each revolution or (2 nr) (xn) where n=no. of revolutions
per hour.
     Boddie further states that the machine is more efficient when driven by a
wife, as indicated by speed readings taken by himself at intervals of 15 minutes
(his wife maintaining a constant speed on the crank).
     We rather question this last statement, because it would lead to a differential
of opinion between him and his wife; the second or third differential of opinion
would lead to dispute, and hence, as the destruction of the machine would probably be the direct result, this case could hardly be a fair normal test.
     Shriver maintains that water is not the only liquid which has cleansing properties, and he further asserts that any liquid with a specific gravity of 1.2 or less
will accomplish the same results. He suggests that the machine be driven by an
electric motor, or that the operator be speeded by the use of Pittsburg Brewing
Company's Special.
                           ENGINEERING NEWS.
     The much renowned Harley balance will be on exhibition at the Smith Cabinet every afternoon from five until six o'clock.
     It is rumored that the new University is to be equipped with the Curry Direct-Current Transformers. They are to be installed by the mechanical engineering section of the Junior class.
     Lessons in theoretical and practical wood chopping are given each day in
the mechanical laboratory. The principal object of the course is to teach the students to spend twice as much time telling about it as they do in preparing the
fuel.

                                 LOCATION.
     The metropolis is the honme-sweet-home of a university. Only in such an
.environment is it possible to learn the use of the pedal extremities and enlarge
the cranial capacity, to develop from a callow Freshman into a sophisticated Senior.
Pittsburgia is an ideal location. The city is one vast laboratory, where everybody works but the paternal antecedent; the university is a fine miniature imitation, where everybody learns but the faculty. The student lives in an atmosphere which teaches that life comes hard and life is earnest, and he'd better wash
his face. The Western University is thus advantageously situated on the upper
crust of this mundane oblate spheroid.
     The observant student, as he wends his up-hill way to the scene of this
home of the Graces, beholds on every hand the opportunities of culture which,
taken at full price, will emaciate his purse. Behind plate glass shine the glories
of Occidental civilization; the wail of the nickelodeon is heard in the streets, the
peanut bags' minute forms catch the eye from the Italian's stand, Rosenbaun,
millinery tosses in the breeze, and the gasoline auto and the one-cent cigar waste
their sweetness on the smoky air: culchah, culchah, culchah! culchah evewywheh!
     In this connection we would be unpardonably remiss if we should fail to
mention with glowing adjectives and nouns, both common and proper, the noise
indescribable to be heard at the Zoo at Highland Park. Here is foregathered
the 6lite of the animal kingdom, from the subtle serpent to the king of beasts;
and many a rara avis adds its song at the call of the roaring chief rooter. Yea,
more, the Zoo always has a big feline for you.
    So rich is the Pittsburg Exposition in materials of a character to make the
mouth water and in the practical application of the various branches of amuse321
ments, that colleges many miles distant miss their students, who come hither for
a visit. It means much to the student to pursue his collegiate course in the midst
of the activities of the Pittsburg Baseball Club.
    The Duquesne Gardens, the roller-skating rink, the opportunities for photos
at a dozen for ten cents, painless extraction free, and credit good at Pickering's:
too much emphasis and money cannot be placed upon this culture by the college
students. It adds greatly to the price of traveling around the college curricula
that the student is pursued by his studies in an atmosphere which combines culchah
and smoke as does Pittsburg, where one learns to do, and sees what has been
(lone, and the stars shine through the smoke.
                         THE STUDENT MUSEUM.
    Among many other valuable exhibits are the following:
    Two bottles of College Spirit(s) bottled in bond.
    One boot of the late George Kissinger.
    One lovely.coed pompadour.
    Hypothetical question by Clarence Boddie, asked of Dr. Alex. Hunter.
    Lunch box containing brick, kicked 500 ft. by Shriver, breaking world's record and. patent leather shoe.
    Running shoe with scorched sole, belonging to Chester Rose.

                               I. Co-education.
    i. Philandering.--Mechanics of Materials. Professor Hartman, Ph.D.
    The principal subjects treated are the resistance and elasticity of materials.
The action of hearts under various conditions is carefully studied and the stu
dent is encouraged to supplement the lectures and text-book by practical work.
The value of different kinds of candy, size of box and price are considered. Ice
cream and soda water are briefly touched upon.
    Text, Van Blarcom's Ioo Tests of the Female Heart.
    2. Surveying.-Short Course. Professor Bates, M.'Arts.
    The student is taught to know a good thing on first sight. The work includes a study of library methods.
    Text, Kissinger's Hand Book of Library Observations.
    3. Amatory Language and Literature.-Professor Bates, M.'Arts.
    The student is trained in conversation and introduced to reading of Amatory Literature immediately. The locals of the exchanges, especially the Geneva
Cabinet, and such selections from the Courant as are of interest are used as
primers.
    Advanced Texts, Lessing's Beatricia von der Henne Haus, and Goethe's
Waldemar und Liliana.
    4. Interviewing.-Prof. Hartman and Student-Assistant Shawv.
    In this course one hour of recitation is required and two hours of library
work. The text-book of the professor in charge is used-Waiting on the Stairs,
with reference to Willock's Shy Remarks.
    5. Eyeing and Ogling.-Professor Mitchell, G.G.Is.
    The formulas for differentiation of winks and glances are deduced both
by the method of rates and that of limits. Applications are made to the valuation
of indeterminate expressions and the shining of the eyes, the determination of unseeing tangent glances and the composition of dreamy looks. Students become
more interested and get a better grasp of the subject by the introduction of visitors.
    Text, Chase Carhart's Optical Calculus.
    (A part of the library will be fitted up with sofas and curtains, and students
will be given the opportunity to speak to a girl without having a dozen more
around.)

     8. Rhetoric and Composition.-Professors Wiese and Willson, T.D.B.
     A careful study is made of the elements of depreciation, of the acid qualities of style, and of the four forms of mockery-direct insult, cynical unbelief,
prophecy of failure and rejoicing at downfall.
    9. Knocking.-Professors Wiese and Willson, T.D.B.
    Text-books, Wiese's Theoretical and Practical Jabs, Jolts and Cracks, or,
Gone to the Dogs and Terbush's Love-Taps.
                          III. Acquisitive Engineering.
     (This course gives a student ability to take care of No. I. The graduate of
this course is a thorough man of the world. The foundation laid is broad.)
     io. Thermo-pneumatics.--Professor Arthur, A.I.R.
     Practical conversation is required and the student soon learns to use the
warmed aerations in a natural manner. The elements of hot air are explained and
their production and mixture taught by experiment. Training in writing advertisements, mining stock a specialty, is given when desired. Description of
athletics is the main exercise. The class learns how to tell vividly and lengthily
wihat isn't as what is, yet without saying that what isn't is what it is or is what
it isn't.

    17. Jocularity.-4Professor Kissinger, I.O.O.F.
    The elementary work in this course consists in gaining control of the physiognomy, and dislocation of the necktie. Each student must provide himself with
a large glass stick pin, tousled hair and abnormal pedal equipment. The care
of the stomach is discussed. Visits are made to Aspinwall to get some of that
funny air. An amateur Glee Club is organized, and each man is trained as endman. The work of the term is closed with the cultivation of a droll expression
and forlorn attitude, and practice in entertaining an appreciative auburn-haired
girl.

extracted a ten-cent lunch lemo-orange from under a suffering Freshman's
thumb-nail.) A remarkable method of taking in knowledge with the food is
carefully shown. (The food is subjected to polarized light reflected from a history book and then- rapidly eaten.) The more wonderful discovery of a relief

                             THE GYMNASIUM.
    There is a Gymnasium. It is fitted with a gallery, a basket-ball and a
trained instructor. Grounds for the exhibition of gym suits and muscles are
provided upon the campus with ball field, tennis courts and ash track, well ventilated and refrigerated by a wind attachment.  Many bystanders and onlookers are kept always ready to join heartily in the jeering.
    Recognizing that no one system is perfect and each has its faults, the instructor uses no system at all. It is hoped that some Delsarte movements wilt 5e
cmbodied in the class exercises, but so far the Awkward movements have prevailed. The classes on the horizontal bar, parallel bars, side and long horse and
flying rings are taking a great interest in basket-ball. A contest is held each
year in February, to see which class looks funniest. In April, the annual horror
in the gymnasium causes a crush of Juliets in the gallery. In the spring, the
students get spring fever.

"THE OWL ALMANAC
  Most Valuable and Interesting Almanac Published
                Read Wrathfully by Millions
                INSTRUCTIONS AND CONTENTS
    The following Calendar, we wish to state once and for all, is a strictly
true record of bona fide events; but, as words are often inadequate, especially
for description of mental and spiritual things (of which this book is full), we
suggest to all critics, higher and lower, that things may not seem what they be.
.But all due and possible care has been taken, for the proof was sent down and
very generously read three times by the Father of Lies. He finally reported it
perfectly satisfactory and beyond improvement, as judged by his standards. (He
has purchased several copies in anticipation of some Wup guests.) You may depend upon this calendar's sublime veracity.
     Our Jokes were all tried in an electric furnace and some are there yet.
The rest were taken out, the points knocked off and all shafts carefully winged.
     Large Margins have been left for the entering of all deaths and weddings
resulting from any news items, advertisements, or witticisms herein contained.

     Dr. Snively, who has been termed "K. I. Bill," is
one of our oldest Professors. His clinics in the K. C.
are noted, and he gives us many practical points in diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Dr. Snively, you

taking a crack now and then at pathology.

      Professor of Diseases of the Eye and Ear.
      Treasurer Board of Trustees.  Graduated
      Jefferson Medical College.
      Dr. Heckelman is a well built man with a com manding appearance and a nice white beard, which the
 boys say resembles the Bundle of His. He is also
 somewhat of a fighter, and seems to have missed his
 calling. He should have been a regimncotal in the Ger man army.
 THOMAS McKEAN THOMPSON McKENNAN, M.D.,
      Professor of Nervous and Mental Diseases.
      Board of Trustees. Graduated University of
      Pennsylvania 1882.
    Dr. MIcKennan has quite a knack of recognizing
a crazy man when he sees one. That is the reason he
comes up the hill once a week to see the senior class.
   WILLIAM THOMPSON ENGLISH, A.M., M.D.,
     Professor of Physical Diagnosis. Graduated
     Jefferson Medical College 1871.
     Dr. English nearly always has a large number of
rare cases for his clinics which makes them very interesting. He makes a fine personal appearance and is
one of the most popular professors in school.

        THOMAS L. HAZZARD, B.S., M.D.,
     Professor of Diseases of the Rectum. Gradu     ated University of Pennsylvania.
     Dr. Hazzard is very ethical and often in his clinics
he stands off from the patient, looks down and is
heard to exclaim, "Ah soul."
           XAVIER O. WERDER, M.D.,
      Professor of Didactic and Clinical Gynecol      ogy. Graduated University of City of New
      York 1879. Board of Trustees.
      Dr. Werder's childlike simplicity and gentle voice
has made quite an impression on the minds of our
seniors.
         ELMER BROWN BORLAND, M.D.,
      Professor of Hygiene and Dietetics. Gradu      ated West Penn Medical College 1887.
    Dr. Borland not only resembles one of our martyred presidents in appearance, but also in his gentle
manner. He begins all his lectures with the introductory, "Gentlewomen and gentlemen," then goes on to
explain a complete sanitary system such as we have
i,ot at school.

          THEODORE J. ELTERICH, M.D.,
      Professor of Diseases of Children. Graduated
      West Penn Medical College 1889.
      This is our friend Dr. Elterich, with the very
pretty pompadour. He is always looking for cranial
tabes. Has a gentle way of examining babies, but of
course, that is his business.
        JAMES WITHERSPOON, A.M., M.D.,
      Professor of Descriptive Anatomy. Gradu      ated West Penn Medical College 1895.
    Dr. Witherspoon could join the six-footers' club,
and would hold a position near the front of their ranks.
His classes are all conducted very quietly, due, no
doubt, to the fact that they are always quizzes. About
once a year he says a few words not relating to the
subject of anatomy.
        WILLIAM H. INGRAM, M.D., M.S.,
      Professor of Histology, Pathology and Bac      teriology. Secretary of the Faculty, Medical
      Department. Graduated West Penn Medical
      College 1894.
    You would probably infer from     Dr. Ingram's
photo that he is a very stern man, but he is not; you
dhould see him smile. We challenge any one to produce a man who can talk as much and say as little as
Dr. Ingram. However, he is an interesting speaker,
and if you get a chance get him to tell you of some of
his experiences. Let us warn you, thotugh, do not get
him started on pathology.

ROBERT WRAY STEWART, M.D., M.R., C.S.,
     Professor of Principles of Surgery and Clini     cal Surgery.  Graduated Jefferson Medical
     College 1885.
     Dr. Stewart has gone on a trip to Europe, and will
not lecture to us again this term. He had a way of
introducing little anecdotes in his lectures which greatly lightened the students' work and which will always be remembered as bright spots in our college life.
His absence is deeply felt by all the students.
     JOHN JENKINS BUCHANAN, M.D., Ph.D.,
     Professor of Principles of Surgery and Clini     cal Surgery. Graduated University of Penn     sylvania 1881.
     Dr. Buchanan lectures to us twice a week and each
time he is through we know we have been going some.
It would be quite an advantage to be able to write
shorthand and in this way get a breathing spell now
and then. We take this opportunity to thank Dr. Buchanan for the pictures he displays at each lecture.
They certainly are a great factor in impressing a subj'ct on the minds of the students.
       GEORGE NUGENT MONRO, Jr., A.M.,
       Professor of Medical Jurisprudence. Gradu       ated Harvard Law School I899.
    Professor Monro is noted for bringing before the
class some of the most intricate questions and to which
we hope we will never have to give answers in court.
33
       THOMAS LAWRENCE DISQUE, M.D.,
       Professor of Genito-Urinary Diseases. Gradu       ated West Penn Medical College 1893.
     We think it unnecessary to say much about Dr.
Disque, for you have probably heard about him from
other sources. He has become famous for his "Seven
Glass'rTest."
          FREDERICK A. RHODES, M.D.,
      Professor of Physiology and Applied Physi      ology.  Vice-President Medical  Faculty.
      Graduated West Penn Medical College igoo.
    Last year Dr. Rhodes thought the Juniors hadn't
enough work to keep them busy, so he introduced the
3tudy called Applied Physiology, which contains some
practical points. At first he had the students take
notes from his lectures, but this year he has undertaken to furnish the notes at the small sum of $1.50
from each student for about 70 pages. We are afraid
he will come out short, but he isn't worrying.
          WILLIAM JOHN LANGE, M.D.,
     Professor of Practical Anatomy. Graduated
     West Penn Medical College g9oo.
     Dr. Lange is a chip off the old block, and promises to follow in his father's footsteps, which is saying
a good deal.   However, he will have to eat a few
loaves of bread and take a few lessons in speech making before he catches up.

            JOHN EDWIN RIGG, M.D.,
      Professor of Obstetrics. President of Medical
      Faculty. Graduated College of Physicians
      and Surgeons 1879.
    Dr. Rigg is a little old fashioned but he is an outand-out gentleman. He teaches us by telling some of
his own experiences, but if he ever loses that index finger on his right hand, which is constantly shaking to
impress facts, we think he will not be able to teach any
more.
        EDWARD B. HECKEL, A.M., M.D.,
     Associate in Diseases of Eye and Ear. Gradu     ated New York University.
     Besides being able to teach diseases of the Eye and
Ear, Dr. Heckel is capable of delivering a very nice
speech, as was evidenced at the College opening services, Oct. 3, 19o6. He is also well up on Medical Ethics.
          EDWARD M. ILAND, B.S., M.D.,
     Associate in Materia Medica and Therapeu     tics. Graduated West Penn Medical College
     1896.
     Dr. Iland is filling Dr. Dunn's chair since the latter has not been teaching, and to say that he goes some
is putting it mildly. He has the Edison phonograph
beaten forty ways. However, he has a lot of ground
to cover and no doubt he knows best how to cover it.

             IRWIN J. MOYER, M.D.,

where the students get many good points from him.
       CHARLES ORVIS GOULDING, M.D.,
     Associate in Clinical Medicine. Graduated
     Bellevue Medical College, New York City,
     1887.
     Dr. Goulding conducts his clinics in a quiet manier at the Mercy Hospital, and they are instructive.
         JAMES IRWIN JOHNSTON, M.D.,
     Associate in Clinical Medicine. Graduated
     University of Pennsylvania 1893.
     Dr. Johnston holds bedside clinics at Mercy Hospital, which are well attended by the boys. He is a
great admirer of the Case method of diagnosis and follows it closely. He is a pleasant talker.

     Dr. Mayer visits us just occasionally, but is surc
to show up to give the examination.
       WILLIAM H. WESLEY, M.D., Ph.G.,
             Demonstrator of Pharmacy.
    Dr. Wesley is the Freshies' delight. He has them
recite jaw-breaking Latin names of drugs and their
botanical names. You should see Dr. Wesley leading
the Freshies upstairs to the laboratory. It reminds
you of a shepherd and his flock.

      Associate in Diseases of Nose and Throat.
      Graduated West Penn Medical College 18g9.
      Dr. Sterrett is admired by the boys for his knowl edge of his subject and for his quick operations.
          JOHN C. HIERHOLZER, M.D.,
      Associate in Diseases of Nose and Throat.
      Graduated Jefferson Medical College 1888.
      Dr. Hierholzer is noted among the students for his
systematic lectures and his manner of making things
clear.
    JOHN DeVINNE SINGLEY, A.B., A.M., M.D.,
      Associate Professor Chair of Principles of
      Surgery and Clinical Surgery.  Graduated
      University of Pennsylvania 1895.
    Dr. Singley is one of that class of men, the
oftener seen the better liked. In the Sophomore year
we sort of got tired of continually hearing about tumors, but in our Junior year we enjoy his quizzes;
and no doubt in our Senior year we will be looking forward to our meetings with him. His clinics at the
Pittsburg Hospital are very practical and beneficial.

           C. S. APGAR, A.B., A.M., M.D.,
     Assistant to Chair of Obstetrics. Graduated
     University of Pennsylvania 1897.
     In Dr. Apgar we have a quiz-master who seems
to be from Missouri. He makes you show him. He
ias a peculiar way of asking questions sometimes, e. g.,
"I am thinking of a point which nobody has mentioned.
What is it?" Of course, if you study from any other
book than William's you will be unable to answer.
              J. J. SCHILL, B.S., M.D.,
      Assistant to Chair of Materia Medica and
      Therapeutics. Graduated West Penn Medical
      College 1904.
      The boys at first put Dr. Schill down on their
record as a sober, tight-mouthed, and tight-minded
man from whom they would not derive much benefit.
"They have since changed completely around and he has
become quite a favorite. The boys like his quizzes
and try to give him the best answers they can.
             PAUL EATON, A.M., M.D.,
      Assistant Demonstrator of Surgery Upon the
      Cadaver.  Graduated West Penn Medical
      College 1903.
      Dr. Eaton is assistant to Dr. Stuart, and in many
 respects resembles the latter, one of which is his knack
 of telling stories. He is well liked by the students.

        Assistant to Chair of Clinical Medicine.
     Dr. Glynn, alias "Willie", is undoubtedly the mas ter of the Junior class. He is one of the professors
 who can hold their attention. His particular work con sists of instilling into the minds of the boys the science,
 art and practice of medicine as not taught by "K. I.
 Bill". His common expression is, "That's right, Doc tor, the whole thing in a nutshell".
           ATCHESON STEWART, M.D.,
      Assistant to Chair of Principles of Surgery
      and Clinical Surgery.
      Dr. Stewart is a chip off the uncle and a favorite
with the boys. He is now filling Dr. R. W. Stewart's
place admirably.
            RICHARD J. BEHEN, M.D.,
      Assistant to Chairs of Physical Diagnosis and
      Applied Physiology.
    Dr. Behen is a popular quiz-master, for the reason
that he answers his own questions before the student
has a chance to begin. He has a characteristic way of
asking questions backward.

      Professor of Principles of Surgery. Grad      ate University of Pennsylvania 1894.
    Dr. Gaub began this year to lecture on Principles
of Surgery and is making good. He leads us into the
microscopical appearance of inflammation and makes
us see stars, but brings us back to earth finally with a
pretty good idea of the subject. He gets so interested
in the lecture that he does not hear the bell at the end
of the hour.
            EMMERT C. STUART, M.D.,
      Demonstrator of Operative Surgery Upon
      the Cadaver.
    Dr. Stuart is quite a favorite with the students.
He is always dressed up to the height of fashion, and
with his few golden locks and "go-tee" makes a neat
appearance in the pit. He is noted for his inexhaustible supply of stories.
             GEORGE L. HAYS, M.D.,
     Assistant to Chair of Principles of Surgery
     and Clinical Surgery.

rowdy Sophs and Freshies in the Physiological Lab.
He is well liked by all the students.
          ARTHUR P. SCHAEFER, M.D.,
      Assistant to Chair of Diseases of Children.
    Dr. Schaefer got very excited one day after finding a case of cranial tabes. He was so elated over the
fact that he cried out to the students in a dramatic
voice, "Feel it, you may never feel it again."
43
            JOHN A. HAWKINS, M.D.,
      Associate Professor of Diseases of Rectum.

             LOUIS F. ANKRIM, M.D.,
          Assistant to Chair of Dermatology.

classes: (I) Those cured with mercury, (2) Those
cured with sulphur, (3) Those that not even the devil
can cure.
                E. A. WEISS, M.D.,

well liked by the boys.
           CHARLES B. McABOY, M.D.,
           Assistant to Chair of Physiology.
    Dr. McAboy and the students did not hit it very
well at first, but we now realize that it was our fault,
not his, and he has the respect of the class. We are
-ylad to see him come to quiz.
        HENRY PAUL KOHBERGER, M.D.,
     Director of Clinical Laboratory and Assistant
     to Chair of Principles of Medicine.
     Have you ever noticed how Dr. Kohberger emphasizes facts by making marks on the blackboard? Incidentally he erases a line or two also. He is very
much averse to the students asking questions during
the class hour.

eST   FRANCIS CLIFFORD PHILLIPS, A.M., Ph.D.,
      University of Pennsylvania, 1878. Professor
      of Chemistry and Mineralogy.
      Dr. Phillips is our first professor in length of ser vice. What he does not know of chemistry has never
 been discovered, but what you do not know usually is.
 "Gentlemen!--" He is careful (!!) about explosives.
 therefore has invented a face-protector, a large glass
 funnel wide enough to cover the face, stuck on with
 four pieces of court-plaster. Once, while preparing an
 explosive hair invigorator the shank of his protector
 upset the mixture and dislodged the funnel, an explo sion followed and the liquid covered his face and neck.
 So "Woolly" wears a proof of his chemical genius.
 While expert in many lines, his specialty is natural gas
 (of all kinds).
        ALBERT ELLIS FROST, A.M., Sc.D.,
        Dartmouth, 1872. Professor of Physics.
     We really have always had great men. This one
has been here a long time. Has a terrible subject but
explains it well. Practiced by explaining the advantages of the University so that he knows how to bring
out a small point. Five minutes' talk with his smile
makes father think the boy will be in gentle hands. He
is, till-. Always says the story didn't refer to any one.
If you know anything, he will discover it, "rear the
tender thought, and teach the young   idea how    to
shoot." Specialist in clear thinking and exact expression. Mighty in apology, too mighty, some say; and
he speaks with no direct assertions unqualified. Wait
till he writes that new physics book!
      REID THOMAS STEWART, Ph.M., C.E.,
      Western University of Pennsylvania, 1884.
      Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
    Author of a much renowned treatise on "Hot Air
Tubes," written expressly for the amusement of the
writer and the amazement of others. Prof. Stewart is
the surprise and terror of Senior engineering students
during the first few weeks of each fall term. However, they soon learn to know him as an interesting
man, and prefer having him rather than themselves do
the talking and questioning. He is liable to "jump on
vou with both feet," so be interested but keep in the
dark.

         HENRY SAYRE SCRIBNER, A.M.,
      Princeton, i881. Professor of Greek Lan      guage and Literature.
      He knows any amount of stuff but you wouldn't
know he knew it. Noted for realistic rendition of dramatic paragraphs, comedy a specialty. Has keen appreciation of a joke unless it could be interpreted as
derogatory to the glory of Hellas. Relentless in length
of recitation and unmerciful to the shirk, girls (!!!)
not excepted. Enthusiastic, for longer lessons and
abundant reference reading. Supporter of reformed
(?) Republican politics and denouncer of Matthew
Stanley Quay and Philip of Macedon. Have a private
free-for-all talk with him and become acquainted.
COLBERT MOUSSEAU DES ISLETS, A.M., Ph.D.,
      Princeton, 1869. Professor of Latin and
      French.
      "Let us enjoy ourselves together," is his idea.
The subject may be dry but he enlivens it, for he is a
man of ideas and many stories. When he lavs down
the book and takes off those eye glasses and holds them
out a bit toward y ou, then you expect, "When I was in
Canada last suummer," or, "Out in Iowa." Ile wants
his students to be broad thinkers, above all things
thinkers. The most pleasant man to meet in the whole
school. He does not stand on his dignity. He does
not need to, being six feet tall without inner soles.
Somehow "Pop" Des Islets is universally liked, even
if he does not believe in lovely dress, for he wears a
lovely smile.
  ALEXANDER STUART HUNTER, Ph.D., LL.D.,
     Washington and Jefferson, 188o. Professor
     of English Literature and Ethics.
     "Uncle Alick," Ph.D., LL.D., and do not forget it.
Nice man, for often there is a smile behind that upturned mustache (which, by the way, is his and therefore at his disposal and not yours). Looks like the
Kaiser when he is fixed up and like Mark Twain when
he's mussed (fixed down). If you can give "that calf
illustration of mine. It's a good one," or an exact
luotation from the book, he is delighted. His Ph.D.
was gotten on his "knowledge of the American boy,"
and that LL.D. was given for laying down this law to
the young ladies, genus-American, species-W. U. P..
"The young ladies must cease their conversation."
Makes the eagle scream on all possible occasions. At
ease on state occasions-and all others.

       JOHN COLVIN FETTERMANN, Ph.M.,
       Western University of Pennsylvania, i896.
       Professor of Biology.
     "Fett" is a good scout and liked by most students.
 If all the faculty should take as much interest in the
 students and their interests as he does, we would be
 killed by the shock, but as it is the spirit departs slow ly. He is a loyal NWN. U. P. man; chief beggar for
 1905, but back to the bugs in 19o6. A great milk in spector for the Trust. His best method is to get a good
 spy glass, climb the tallest tree in the farming district,
 make notes of all pumps in the surrounding country
 and take daily observations from this view-point at
 milking time. An authority on how to keep frogs.
          JOHN HAMMOND SMITH, E.E.,
      Western University of Pennsylvania, i898.
      Assisting Professor of Mathematics and
      Drawing.
      They give Smith a better and then better job. He
may be dean yet, if he keeps on smiling. Some of the
boys think Smith makes them work. All which proves
that he is a good professor for most of them need
driving.
           FERDINAND BERGER, A.M.,
     Professor of German Language and Literature.
     Herr Berger, der Deutscher with the hugh frame,
wonderful lung capacity, a scented breath, and a white
vest. Smokes behind the building in summer, but now
uses his lunch hours training the concert grand choir.
Sometimes we can hear the choir when the soft pedal
is on and the forced draft is out of order. Has the
reputation of breaking up two pianos in the same number of years. Companies are now presenting instruments for strength tests. Berger was not in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, but he has been ever since,
and has won it 917,473 times. But he is in America
by preference, because-he likes the girls.

       EDMUND BURKE HUEY, A.B., Ph.D.,
       Lafayette, 1895. Professor of Psychology and
       Education.
     Huey has a tenor voice, a woolly horse, a head full
of bumps which he developed while starring at end for
Lafavette-or in some other way, and re-e-emarkable
methods. His brains are also worthy of special mention. Says his horse is erratic (this shows what environnient will do, Professor), but is improving under
scientific treatment. Poor beast, it is taking a course
in education. lie claims it is an Indian pony but it
looks like a Shetland. Dr. Huey is very particular. It
is reported that he drinks tea and keeps a parrot; others claim him to be capable of higher things.                      I'. A,-'

     Hle's a jolly good fellow, which nobody will deny.
When he became a professor he did not cease to be a
man, young, too. He helps make Wup famous by performing with the Glee Club. As a result of his courting experiences he will doubtless be a better tennis referee than ever. Fine mineralogist. Some remarks of
his suggest (!!!) that he was up in the "Cobalt region" last summer.

     Mr. Richardson came to this University last fall
 and since then has gained the favor of all who have
 come in contact wth him. You will think he is a cinch
 until you have to spend more time re-writing a paper
 which he has corrected than you did preparing the
 original. His hobby is the Curtis steam turbine.
      ALEXANDER SILVERMAN, Ph.B., A.B.,
      Western University of Pennsylvania, 19o2.
      Instructor in Analytical Chemistry.
      Although bodily present at W. U. P., he seems to
have his mind (he very decidedly has one) at Cornell.
The chemical students are constantly being reminded
of the methods used at the University in Ithaca. When
"Aleck" heads the Faculty, the smoking of ten cent
cigars (under the hood) will be a requisite for the
Chemical Department. Pretty good scout, for he is
another of the really loyal alumni and professors who
care. His chief drinks are pasteurized milk and Apollonaris water.
ALEXANDER WELLINGTON CRAWFORD, A.M.,
                      Ph.D.,
      University of Toronto, i895. Instructor in
      English.
    William Shakespeare Crawford came to this great
institution last fall, and the term opened with a great
increase of students in the collegiate department. Dr.
Crawford has made a great increase in the number of
English courses open to the unlearned and has started
a movement for the eradication of nasal tones in the
Sophomore and Freshman classes. Neither his mistakes nor those of anybody else worry him. It may
be that teaching philosophy produces that smooth voice
and unruffled manner. See what learning can do!
And there is a smile, brightness pressed down and running over.

his inferiors with that proper self-respecting kindliness which exalts both
him that gives and him that takes, so
twice exalted. Yes it is. This is the
Secretary of the University, and when
the University becomes Greater, the
secretary will yet be great enough. He
who hath missed seeing the Dr. enter

-not a sarcastic man either-generally. He likes everybody-started a mutual admiration society as soon
as he came-membership involuntary. Beware of him,
he may get you interested in one of your studies. And
the man is actually willing to take up American history! We have waked up, and do you know, we like
it!

     A teacher is a teacher. Prof. Slifer is a teacher,
therefore he is a teacher. If any of you can find any
flaw in the argument, do it. And he is an extra nice
man. He makes a special effort to be a nice man and
a student may well go to him in a pinch, football men
especially. Visits the sick and doesn't blow any whistle
when he goes. But students are queer things.

     Mr. Hackett was one of the best college instructors we have ever had or
heard of. His coming was very quiet. Indeed the first news students had of
him was the enthusiastic report of some one who had talked with the new man.
He was always ready to talk to anyone and each time he made an admiring friend.
He made explicit plans for a greater University and began immediately to carry
them out. His knowledge and ability astonished those who met him, as his kindness delighted them. And now he is gone, but his spirit remains; for some are
working now with an ideal before them, and he made the ideal.

    Lab. Pittsburg College of Phar    macy, 1884.
  Dr. Koch was born in kremen, G('rmany, but was educated in lPittsburg.
In 1896 he returned to his native land
and attended the University of Munich,
and in 1897 the University of Heidelberg, devoting most of his time to special and research work in Inorganic
Chemistry. "O(ld Koch," as the boys
call him, has everybody bluffed; says
that if there is any trouble he will be
on deck with both feet. Doubtless you
think you can fool the old man, but he
generally keeps his peepers peeled, an(d
he says that if he catches anyone shooting rubber bands at him, he will send
him (or her) away from the joint to
stay. Dr. Koch is liked in general by
the boys (and girls).

    Dr. Beal is a good scout, the girls just thought he
was the candy professor. The question is asked, "Do
you miss him?"   Humph! whoever asked it was a
dumb-head, or didn't know him. Why, if Dr. Beal
doesn't come back next term, the boys claim they will
go crazy. James H. was the best man there to give
you a calling; he could go about cool as an ice man
and at the same time cut clear in to the bone. Wewell, we deserved it sometimes. Every one had a
soft spot for him.

    Dr. Aschman is the man with the whiskers and
the voice from way down the well. Spiels out the inorganic dope to those poor, wretched, unfortunate
dubs, who sit there and take it down without any
knowledge of what they are doing. Oh, well, he
doesn't mean it that way, but you know how it goes.
You never hear a word against Dr. Aschman, even
though he does come from Beaver county (!!!).

      Emeritus Professor of Materia Medica and
      Botany, and Professor of Physiology. Belle      vue Hospital Medical College, 1879.
    We thought he had departed, but he came back
with a lot of new (lope, which was more complicated
than any before. Of course, everybody knows him,
he has been here since the war broke out and hasn't
changed a bit. Gets the glad hand from everybody.

"Dr. Mac" gets a good word from everybody.

knows who makes the noise during lectures, also who
asks the class to cut and do, etc. Yes, and has the
class bluffed all right, for when he passes some of
the fellows, they shiver for fear he will say something
to them. He is very good to the boys, never too busy
to explain, and so he is well liked. Prof. Saalbach is
a member of the board of directors and treasurer of

                "Old Koss" is the man with the curls. With his
            book he will pour out the knowledge by the bucket            ful; and it is thought by the students that if he does
            not stop, they will be so crammed with it that they
            will soon bust (burst, A la Webster). A man with
            good qualities and well liked.
            FREDERICK JOHN BLUMENSCHEIN, Pharm. D.,
                    Assistant Professor of Materia Medica.
              "Blumey," as the boys call him, is a little duck            ducklet, who is very wise-owl, knows his business to
            perfection-shark, but cannot keep the boys in order            lark. Said to possess the common characteristics of
            his race-the sauerkraut tribe. A very good man.

                     head.' "
    Thornberrv and Toots used always to be at 7's
and 6's. At least they pretended to be.

                  "We now prescribe like doctors in despair."
                Aren't you ashanmed of yourself for prescribing
            for those unsuspecting freshmen. It is true you look
            like a doctor.

"Fortune has rarely condescended to be the companion
                     of genius."
    Yet sometimes. This man is always busy in some
great work. He has held all the big jobs except president of the United States. And that would be a comnetlown for the student representative on the Athletic
Committee. The chancellor and--well, maybe notcall him "W\ill." You should see him come into class
late (always) and politely sit down near the door-and
the girls (always) and smile at us all. He is one of
those fellows who are always at school but seldom in
sight, gives you the impression that he has some things
to do. One of the hottest things he ever did was
"roasting" men in last year's "Owl." When he leaves,
the Collegiate Department will be "busted" and then
where will you get your great men?

                   Allegheny, Pa.
       "Night after night
       He sat and bleared his eyes with study."
    This, the second of the Trinity, is like No. one, a
grind, but also gets there. "Alick," at the beginning
of his University career, was simple cnough to demand
his recitation when the professor happened to excuse
the class without hearing the recitation. Time, however, the great mender of all things, has worked wonders with the lad until he isn't a half bad sort of a fellow when you get to know him. But, "What does
'Alick' want with a Kent's Handbook?"   Ile's frank,
even if he doesn't like you, and if he does, he's imore.
