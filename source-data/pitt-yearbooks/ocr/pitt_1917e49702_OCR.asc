  boosts everybody. Could have graduated with the
  class of 1916 but was willing to sacrifice that honor in
  order that the greater honor, that of being a 1917-ite,
  might be conferred upon him. George is a good
  mixer with the girls, but is handicapped in not being

       player, a true gentleman and an assured success after
       he leaves the enfolding arms of Alma Mater.

  Sewickley, Pa.
  Scwickley I igh School
  Hi-Kockey Club
    The lad with the tallest stature and the reddest hair
  in the class. Red will never be forgotten for his many
  encounters with the diligent sophomores, in which he
  always came out victorious for us. Takes great delight
  beating Peck at billiards, pool and bowling, at all
  three of which he is an expert. Has never yet been
  caught visiting a girl, but often talks about going out
  among'em."
EDWARD WILLIAM SCHIETINGER
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
  Fifth Avenue High School
  Controller Pitt Weekly
    "Schietinger did it." Edward Schietinger, C.P.A.,
  head of the largest accounting company in the world.
  If ability means everything and fate does not intervene
  we might look for just such an announcement. As
  an example of what Americans can attain along the
  lines of efficiency, Eddie is the original example.
  While he was comptroller of the Weekly our expense
  accounts certainly felt the ax more than once. We
  have a lurking suspicion that Ed. carries a heart as
  big as a house or he would not have made it possible
  for us to pass accounting.
LOYD CLARENCE SMITI
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
  East Liberty Academy
  Cap and Gown Club (1)
  Hi-Kockey Club
  Junior Prom Committee
    Attends school as long as Atlantic City is snowed
    under and the ball parks are closed. Loyd is one of
  the keenest little dancers that ever glided over a
  waxed floor. Loyd can boast of the fact that he
  never cut a class in Economic Resources last year.
  There must have been some sort of an attraction.
  We juniors wonder what it is.

     The President of the best class that Pitt ever turned
   out. Jack arrived at Pitt with Graham and Statler,
   but there seems to be no bad effect from the contact.
   Jack is well deserved of the high office accorded him,
   for he has done much in school activities.

GEORGE \VALTER WEST
  McKeesport, Pa.
  McKeesport High School
  Student Band
    West claims that McKeesport is the logical place
  for the Federal Reserve Bank of the fourth district,
  and not Cleveland. For corroboration he and Billy
  Fichtner say that Flocken has the C. P. A. statistics
  proving this to be true. Given a sheet of foolscap,
  West can prove by means of advanced accounting
  anything asked. Proving that two is equal to one
  and that one is equal to nothing is George's favorite
  diversion, besides preparing him for the C. P. A.
  exams.

    Sometimes called Azzie, though generally known as
  Cracker, due to his proclivities in that line at the
  Mohican Market. Is a distinguished member of the

  agrees with the Chancellor and Dean Holdsworth that
  Memorial Hall was created for the people, by the peo  ple, of the people and not for students of the Uni  versity of Pittsburgh.

C. M. GETTMAN 1AE
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
    Gettman must be a pretty good scout for we never
  hear him boasting about it. He's present at classes
  once in a while, but why we can't say. It is under  stood that Gett is about to open up a bank, and is
  already canvassing among the bankrupt juniors to put
  their funds into his business after they have become
  multi-millionaires as prophesied by Dr. J. T. Holds  worth upon our entrance into 107 the first assembly

    Hamilton is a new face around the campus. He

  He chose our Alma Mater to that of Old Nassau and
  Old Eli.

    Yes, he hails from W. and J. That would be al  most enough to queer him. But during Bill's short
  stay with us we have found him to be one good scout
  whose company is admired. Bill is a good mixer and
  knows how to get around. One of the good looking
  fellows-always standing strong with the women.

    A man that is friendly must show himself
  friendly.
  A hungry fox went out one night
  But found on the way home there was no
        light,
  And he had many miles to "trot " that night
        Before he'd reach his "den."
  Then a friend who chanced to hear of his
        plight
  Said, I know a friend who can fix things
        right,
  Then he asked Deane Hayes to turn on
        some light,
        And "fox'" got home again.

    "A moral, sensible and well-bred man.'
  -Cowper.
    Its easy enough to be happy

JOHN WATT
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
    From Sophomore to Senior in one year,
  well, we guess that's not bad, eh?
             "Watts" his name
               Well we guess

SAMUEL O()OD 13BRRY
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
    Sam's size resembles somewhat the proportions of
  the Railway magnate in the newspaper cartoons. In
  view of the steep grade on Darragh St., we fail to
  understand how he manages to hold his front. That
  middle name must have been a mistake, because there
  is no "woodl'' in him. He gets every word in all lec  tures, turns in good papers, and stands high in his
  classes.
J. L. BINGHAM
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
    Bingham is not related to Sullivan tho' his fore  lock is J. L. The big J. L. (lid not have a more deadly
  punch than Bingham, for he can tell a good yarn of
  how he knocked over the Hottentots in the Philip  pines. Tho' a veteran of many battles, J. L..'s one
  weakness is a Tuesday evening Cotillion Club, which
  by-the-way he attends most religiously, much to the
  consternation of L.aw III. He says it's nice to be
  married but "Oh for a few glides xwith an angel."
IRA WILLIAM BOYLE
  XWilkinsburg, Pa.
    When Ira decided to attend night school, we under  stand that a large number of the fair sex presented a
  petition to the Dean to give him back to them for he
  is "all for the ladies."
    llowever, he has reached his Junior year safe and
  single and will probably finish the course, as he has
  taken up bowling to take his mind off "lt hem happy
  days."
  "I am a man, nolhing that is human do I think unbecoming in me. "-Terrence.

PEARSON B. BROWN
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
  Evening School Editor 1917 OWL
    What a difference a few years make. Brownie
  came to us a young, unsophisticated, unobstreperous
  lad and now behold a man, firm and decisive. In his
  adolescent appearance he never seemed to have a
  care or worry; but he soon found a cause to make his
  demeanor to be more of a man's size. He is now
  wearing glasses, but his attempt at a mustache was
  a failure. Brownie is even contemplating to forsake
  his bachelorhood and become a benedict. "Bene,
  bene, beni, vidi, vici" quoth, Pearson B. B.
J. GLENN CASSELL
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
    One of the rarest gifts ever given to man is the one
  of good nature. Cassell is blessed with this gift and
  his frank, good-natured smile has won for him a host
  of friends. "It is better to be born with a smile on
  your face than a silver spoon in your mouth." Keep
  smiling J. Glenn, if you don't get your reward on
  earth you will some where else.
CHARLES M. ERWIN
  Coraopolis, Pa.
    The only thing light about him is his hair. You
  will find him well versed in topics of the day, which is
  rather surprising, considering that he comes from
  Coraopolis.
FREDINAND C. FEIN
  Mt. Oliver, Pa.
    "Sugar and Spice and all that's nice" is Fein. Is
  a man of few words, and what he lacks in stature he
  makes up in brains. Never hasty but always gets in
  on time. A strong supporter of the E. S. A., and
  champion "Strong" Stogy Smoker in school.
  "I dare do all that may become a man."-Mac Beth.

   "These flowers are like the pleasures of the world."
EDWARD SEITZ                         -Cymbeline.
  Trafford, Pa.
    From the City of Trafford hails an industrious man
  Who works for our Uni as hard as he can;
  He never shirks duties or fears the exams,
  For bringing flowers to Profs is part of his plans.
CHARLES A. FISCHER
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
    Ladies and Gentlemen, this is our Blackstone.
  This gentleman can quote the law from Africa to
  Zelienople. He is ever an assistant to his instructors
  for if they are not sure of a point in law, FIischer can
  always be depended upon to set them right. After
  our old friend Cyrus Kane departed from our midst,
  Fischer was pre-eminently the brightest of our class.
  In the future we can be assured that the legal profes  sion will quote Fischer, for he is sure to supersede
  Blackstone as an authority.
  " When I was green in judgment." -Antony and
  Cleopatra.
KENNETHI (CASSAVAY
  Edgewood Park, Pa.
    What's in a name? Our old friend Gassaway does
  not always gas-away and he is not connected to any
  air-driven motor. Notwithstanding his surname, Ithe
  is just as cute as his first handle. They say he was
  never allowed out at night before he came to Pitt,
  and he surcly has made up for a few pent-up years.
  His chance for being President may be only worth a
  quarter, but he won't dispose of it for the Oliver
  Building. Kenneth says it's paying large dividends,
  too.
  "A bevy of fair women."- Milton.
EMIL KRISS GEYSER
    We all know Emil Iby his friendly manner, always
  ready for fun and business. He sells breakfast foods,
  but we doubt very much if he gets up in time to eat
  them.
    His late rising does not interfere with his being on
  the job where business is concerned, as he does not
  hesitate to sacrifice a meal for a chance to make a
  dollar. We all wish lots of good luck for Emil.
           "Alone, alone, alone,
              Alone on a wide, wide sea,
            And not another girl in the room
              To come and sit beside me."

ELVIRA HAMSTREN
    The only fair Co-ed in E. S. A., 1917. "But what
  of quantity," quotes Brownie, "it is quality that
  counts." Yea verily, thou hast spoken truly. Our
  Miss Hamstren is one girl in a hundred (fellows).
  Her presence always shed a light of cheer and refine  mnent in our class work. She set many of our hearts
  aflame but our aforesaid sage was the drawing card.
  We never could ascertain how Volz enjoyed that W.
  &amp; J. game, but Brownie says "fine, but I prefer
  skating."
  " Gratitude is Expensive." Gibbon.
FRED E. HARLEN
    Fred's original name was Frederick, but since he
  has been studying accounting, at which he is a shark,
  especially costs, he wishes to be known as Fred. He
  came to us from one of the large corporations, and we
  believe he is big enough to measure up to the work
  he gets. Good morals, good habits, and white all the
  way through even to his hair.
    We understand he likes the ladies. Girls, here isa
  chance for you. Get busy.
  " Comb down his hair; look, look! It stands upright."
-Henry VI.
FRANK A. HEGNER
  Sewickley, Pa.
    Frank's idea of "harmony" is fine both as to ap  pearance and habits. A fine fellow from a fine sub  urb. Big man, big ideas and an enormous ambition.
  It will not be long until he will outgrow his little
  town, then you can expect to hear something from
  this big bunch of energy. It is rumored that he has
  invented a new kind of hair oil for some of his
  friends. "Charity begins at home."
  " The lofty oak from a small acorn grown. "-Duncomb.
W. G. HUNT
    Here we have ambition in its original form. We
  hear that he is chucked so full of it that his employer
  is compelled to send him home, sometimes he gets
  away from work early enough to get to class just
  under the bell. Although he is in the oven business
  he does not warm up very quickly, but big ovens hold
  the heat, and we believe this principle holds good in
  his case.

    "Here" reverberating through the dusky shades of
  Thaw Hall proclaiming in a deep resounding voice to
  the whole Evening School that E. Leggette is answering
  to the roll. lie answers only for himself, but it is
  a positive bet that his big brother is at his side.
  Never, oh never, will they be parted, except when
  R. A. goes to see E.'s girl.

                                     -Longfellow.
ILEGGETTE, R. A. (Present)
     Clear from the hills overlooking Allegheny comes
  this answer to the rolls. The cruel storms and winds
  of winter coursing up the Ohio valley, nor the excru  ciating heat of summer can deter the two Leggettes
  from their determined effort in search of knowledge.
  Only one thing has ever prevented the Siamese twins
  from answering roll, and that is when Ashby surprised
  the class with an examination. The L.eggettes have
  an unwritten law, and that is that R. A. always pays
  the car fare.
DAVID MARTIN LENCIIER
   Pittsburgh, Pa.
     An inspiration for the American youth. A plugger
   but still finds time to linger by the wayside to help his
   fellow student. Davie early realized the necessity
   of an education. Too busy during the day, he has
   steadily progressed at evening schools until now he
   bids fair to reach his ultimate ambition.
 RonT. J. McLEAN
   Pittsburgh, Pa.
     Mac is a good chap, full of fun and work, in fact he
   loves work (?). For a couple of years he carried the
   responsibilities of the University-to where no one
   seems to know, at least they cannot be found. He is
   a shark at accounting and the reason he doesn't take
   the C. P. A. degree is because it is not on the same
   level with his ambition. The man who figured.07
   profit on a suit of clothes has nothing on him.
   "The more we study, the more we discover. "-Shelley.

WILLIAM A. MUNSON AK'F
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
  Evening School Manager 1917 Owl
  When you meet him anywhere,
  He regards you with an air
  Of a busy man of business, don't you know,
  Pulls receipt book in a wink
  And before you've time to think
  Has you're money for an "Owl"-nothing slow.
  So keep out of his way,
  Or you'll find out some day
  That he's always bound to get you in the end.
    But if it had not been for he,
    This book could never be
  For the publisher must have his dividend.
           "Knowledge is power."-Bacon.
VICTOR TnoMAS REED AKIY
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
    A large man with a big heart, a hard worker, sober,
  ambitious, systematic in his habits, and always right
  to the point. At Law he is a corker, and Mr. Ashby
  seems to take delight in making Vic. a target for all
  questions which the class cannot answer. In Ac  counting he is there with the "dope," coming out on
  top in every problem he tackles.
"I do but sing because I mnust and pipe but as the linnets
  sing."- Tennyson.
IRA M. SHOUP
  McKeesport, Pa.
    Shoup comes all the way from McKeesport to get
  his education at Pitt. Of course everybody respects
  a self-made man.
WALTER BOLTZ SIMPSON
  Wilkinsburg, Pa.
    Walter is a graduate from the "Holy City" high
  school and while he does not have much to say, he is
  hard to beat for good marks.
     It is said that Simpson likes the ladies quite a little
  but being rather shy on the subject, does not give
  himself away.
    Simpson intends to take the C. P. A. examinations
  and if he cannot pass them, the rest of us may as
  well quit trying.

LLEVI JOHN SMIITH
  New Kensington, Pa.
    " Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith."
  Like our friend of old, he possesses the gift of song,
  hut he is also working his way to fame through the
  avenues of Law and Accounting.
  "Etverything comes if a man will only wait."-Disraeli.
\WtLIAM CLEMENT TOL,;Ri
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
        As it's given us to perceive
        We must certainly believe
        Willie's helping "John D." through
        In making millions        Now don't you?
        He is always up on Quizzes
        Cause he's in the oily I)bsiness.
ALBERT W. VOLZ
  Carrick, Pa.
    There's a handsome young man from Carrick,
    Who is a wizard at Economics,
    At Accounting and Law, everyone knows,
    He can go like a motor of two twenty volz;
    With the ladies as well, he is on the alert,
    For this is part of our Albert's work.
    Every day as the clock strikes twelve,
    His hooks and papers are placed on a shelf,
    Then straight to I)imling's, withoutt a stop,
    lie goes for a sumpttuous meal, and Lemon Pop.
    His stomach appeased, he darts out of sight,
    Right back to his desk at the IDuquesne L.ight.
SAMUEL NVEINTHAL
  Pittsburgh, Pa.
    Sam is some shark at law and other things, mostly
  other things. As a sage he has Solomon handicapped,
  and if he lives long enough he will have many more
  wives. If you need any pointers as to how to get them
  stand some Wednesday evening at Fifth Avenue and
  Clyde Street. He gets them two at a dip; that is going
  somne for a small man, hbut Sam says it is not the size
  that counts so) Ilmuch as lhe quality of the goods you
  handle.

. NORMAN VWILsON AKT
   Pittsburgh, Pa.
     While his name is the same as a very famous brand,
   and his hair about the same shade, we do not think
   that this has any connection, for he is really a very
   nice boy, quite popular with the other sex. He pos   sesses a sunny disposition and always has a pleasant
   word for everybody.
WALTER PHELPS YOST
   Pittsburgh, Pa.
     Yost was born in the National Capital City, but
  after having lived for eleven years in the Metropolis
  of East Pittsburgh, he is now inspired with the idea
  that George Westinghouse was first President.
     He is secretary of a large and prosperous Sunday
  School and believes in an elaborate accounting sys  tem in every Sunday School.
     Mr. Yost intends to graduate next year, but we
  really believe he will be married by that time. If so,
  " Good-Bye Diploma. "
JAMES H. YOU NG, JR.
  Edgewood Park, Pa.
    "Youngie" hails from Edgewood and is one of the
  Evening School's shining lights, social and otherwise.
  Has a strong leaning toward Accounting and prob  ably will be heard from later on in that field.
GEORG;E L. ARNOLD
  Sharpsburg, Pa.
    At Law he's good, at Accounting better, but at
  Politics a failure. After serving several terms as
  Town Auditor, he was defeated at the election last
  November. He contends that a good professional
  man is a poor Politician, and thinks the U. of P.
  should open a Course in Politics, so that he can mas  ter the art of getting votes scientifically. Since
  George has such high political aspirations, we suggest
  that he enroll in the Public Speaking Class.
  " A man of courage is also full of faith. "--Cicero.
THOMAS P. BUTLER
  Edgewood Park, Pa.
    After having mastered the elements of accounting,
  Tom has decided to thoroughly systematize every
  business in the United States.
    He has undertaken a big job for a little fellow, but
  Napoleon was a little fellow and he didn't have But  ler's knowledge of Accounting; so our best wishes are
  with you, Tonm.

    Chess always looks worried. We wonder if it is the
  care of Crete that brings this expression. If nature
  had made their voices more alike they could take
  turns going to Sociology. If Chess would be so over  joyed at the pecuniary remuneration from a little
  substituting what will it be like when she becomes a
  "Regular Teacher!"

CRETE OLNA POWERS (Pete)
  New Kensington, Pa.
  Slippery Rock Normal
  Women's Activities Association
     If you mention it at all Crete would rather you
  would call it auburn. She never squanders much
  of her time on actual contact with text books when
  there is anything else to be done, but generally comes
  out on top even if her theory is "Let the world slide. "

       Our Sari is so good ever,
       Of men is she scary never.
       That's the reason why
       You never need try
       To tempt her from Christian Endeavor.
HELEN M. REICH
  Carrick, Pa.
  South Side High School
  Women's Activities Association
    Here is a quiet, somewhat pensive maid whose chief
  occupation is being serious. Up to date we are not
  sure that she knows why she came to college for she
  displays a sedate seriousness in regard to Domestic
  Science which forbodes a future application of the
  art. A little bird once told me there was a hope
  chest in the attic of Reich's home.

    It is almost as hard to write something about Jessie
  Jane as it is to write something about the person
  with no individuality, the trouble being Jess has so
  much individuality it is hard to select something.
  We only give you a few hints and let you make the
  formula. Good looks, good disposition, always talk  ing, sometimes sensible things, lots of "pep," good
  student and good teacher, popular, etc. What more
  could you ask?

  Classical Club
  Class Vice-President (3)
     Marie's youthful training was for the child to be
  seen and not heard-what a hindrance for a woman
  not to be able to fully exercise her vocal cords!
  However, she should get along well with the supervis  ors who advocate the "silent onlooker" quality in a
  teacher.
SARAH EDNA SHAFFER(Sal)
  Greensburg, Pa.
  Greensburg High School
  Woman's Activities Association
  Class Secretary and Tresurer (3)
    It is quite evident that Sarah prefers teaching in
  the School of Childhood more than "applied Domes  tic Science, " for we are told she was proposed to in the
  Gym last year, and turned it down. Or perhaps she
  thought it wiser to wait until Leap Year and choose
  for herself.

          Winifrid Silsbee, so they say,
          Came to us from far away.
          S. 0. C. is as dear to her heart
          As when from it she had to depart
HILDA EMMALINE SMITH
  Munhall, Pa.
  Munhall High School
  Women's Activities Association
    Hilda is delicate in stature, avoirdupois and con  versation. A firm believer in the theory of a still
  tongue making a wise head. She prefers her books,
  the fireside company, "et cetera," less interesting, to
  society.

     How Goldie loves her teachers! She thinks men
   are purely ornamental and does not care much for
   public speaking or frogs. The bright spot in her
   Junior year was when she gained permission to prac   tice teach at home. We don't want to discourage
   her, but the "Wise Old Owl" is already coining sym   pathy speeches for the " Beaveritelettes."
 ETHEL STEPHENS
   Pittsburgh, Pa.
   Central High School
   Dilworth Hall
   Women's Activities Association
     Ethel has a premium on two things-singing and
   fainting. Just which of these gives more credit to the
   University we have not decided-the taxi cab driving
   away from the School of Ed. gives a wonderful im   pression to the world at large. Ethel defies the Uni   versity, collectively and individually, due possibly to
   her avoirdupois, or her independent turn of mind.
ANNA CECILIA SWANSON (Ann)
  Munhall, Pa.
  Munhall High School
  Women's Activities Association
    Her most habitual practice is wielding that majestic
  wand that does not spoil the child. She is an en  thusiastic non-man advocate. Her other habits are
  good also. One can't always tell her thoughts from
  her conversation, but see how she responds if you ask,
  "What have you been doing this week?"

             Clean middies all in a row.
SADIE BLACK
  Pittsburgh, Pa.

    This individual breaks every law of respectful eti  quette, for she insists upon referring to her professors
  as "that'It' that sits at the desk." We wonder if
  her pupils return the compliment.

   A boy, as yet, is little Roth,
       If he had wings, he'd be a moth;
     In age he isn't quite the same,
       But as a girl, he'd be a dame.
     Yet what's the diff, I'd like to know
       It's just the girls that make him so.
    They chased the life plumlu out of him
       Yes, that's what makes him small and thin.

      We think his name Nwas made to fit,
         At least the Prosper part of it.
      \\it Ith rounded nose and curley hair,
         The likes of him are few and rare.
       lie's been with us so short a time,
         It's hard to write him up in rhyime;
      A man of brains, he mixes well,
        We wish him luck-what more, do tell.

      lie's rather short but quite sedate,
'Bout five foot five from foot to pate;
      He likes to tamiper with his love,
        His love is not his turtle dove.
      About this love I must explain,
        Because you sure would think in vain.
      You know this stuff called'lectric art?
        It's just this line that's won his heart.

        mlembership) in the Association is of three classes-Regular, Associate and
   I lonorary. Dues of Regular and Associate members are $2.00 annually, which
   includes subscriptions to the " Pitt Weekly."  There are over 5,000 living alumni
   of the University, the oldest being two members of the class of 1849-A. W. Pent   land and Rev. Joseph Horner.
        The Alumni Council is the executive body of the Association and has general
   supervision and control of the affairs of that body. It consists of 50 alumni, one   half of this number being elected alternate years, 32 being members at large and
   two being graduates, respectively, of each of the nine schools having alumni.
   Officers are ex-officio members of the council. Regular meetings are held quar   terly, on the third Monday of March, May, October and December.
        A special effort has been made of late years to get the alumni closer to their
   Alma Mater, and during the collegiate year 1915-1916 this work was pursued
   with renewed vigor, about 500 being added to the paid membership and the total
   number of members being increased to about 800. In order to provide a perma   nent organization for the outgoing Senior classes, a system of Life Secretaries was
   inaugurated, such officers being chosen for each school.
        l)uring 1915 Commencement week there were numerous class reunions, din   ners, banquets, etc., which brought the "grads" back to the campus. The
   official headquarters were in a tent on the lower campus, between State and Thaw
   Hall. Here the alumni registered, free lemonade was served, guides were fur   nished those who wished to visit the buildings, etc. A representative of the
   Alumni office was in charge, and several hundred "grads" took advantage of the
   service.
        Among the alumni activities of the year were annual meetings of the Jef   ferson, Westmoreland and Beaver county clubs, and the forming of new clubs in
   the Shenango and Monongahela valleys at Charleroi and New Castle, respec   tively. The usual Charter Day banquet was dispensed with owing to numerous
   other social functions for which the support of alumni was desired.
       The alumni section of the "Pitt Weeklv" was developed, a full page being
   devoted to graduate activities, edited by the General Secretary.
        An innovation was introduced with the regular meetings of Alumni Council,
   they being held at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, luncheon being served,
   followed by the business session. The attendance was thus improved and
   enthusiasm in alumni work greatly enhanced.
        The'Varsity Letter Club, with membership restricted to graduates or under   graduates who have won the varsity athletic insignia, held several enthusiastic
   gatherings with large attendance.
        On June 26, 1915, J. T. Lutton,'45, who up to that time was the oldest
   living alumnus of the UIniversity, was called by death. Mr. Lutton had attended
   the Charter Day banquet February 25, 1915, at the Hotel Schenley, then at the
   age of 85.

    To make the University, with all the scientific resources which it commands,
of direct and immediate aid to the industries in solving the many manufacturing
problems confronting it, is the object of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research.
     In pursuance of this object the Mellon Institute offers to industrialists the
privilege of founding researches or fellowships, as they are called, for the working
out of definite manufacturing problems.
    Since the establishment of the first fellowship, in March, 1911, to March,
1916, forty-seven distinct industrial concerns have endowed some one hundred
and five fellowships in the Institute.
    That the Mellon Institute has achieved the object for which it was founded
is shown by the fact that during the first four years March, 1911, to March, 1915
--seven out of each ten problems assigned to the Institute for study were solved to
the satisfaction of the donors. A large percentage of the fellowships were renewed,
showing the confidence which industrialists have in the Institute. Twenty-five
patents were granted to the holders of fellowships and there are now as many more
pending. Some twenty processes developed in the Institute are at present being
operated on commercial scales.
    At the close of the first five years of the Industrial Fellowship System at the
Mellon Institute, it can be said that the plan of co-operation between science and
industry which it represents has demonstrated its value to American industry.

        Big things have been accomplished in university athletics during the past
    twelve-month. The year has been one of real progress and accomplishment,
    and this department of Pitt's activities has never been in a more flourishing con    dition. Varsity teams have been supported in eight branches of sport football,
    baseball, basketball, track, wrestling, swimming, tennis and hockey. Expert
    coaching and able management have made the most of the high-class material
    available for the various teams, and the result has been a remarkable record in
    competition with the leading colleges and universities of the country.
        Adoption of the one year residence rule, to go into effect next fall, has added
    to Pitt's high reputation. This is the final step in placing our athletics on equal
    footing with the largest institutions of East and West. No further evidence is
    needed of the sincerity of the University's desire to maintain the cleanest type
    of athletics.
        With "Pop" Warner in his first year at the helm, the Panthers were con    sistently triumphant on the gridiron, winning their way to the top of the heap in
    American football. Only Cornell won the right to dispute Pitt's right to this
    Championship. W. &amp; J., State and Pennsylvania were among those who acknowl    edged Pittsburgh's supremacy. Individual recognition was won by several
    wearers of the Blue and Gold, notably by " Bob " Peck and " Pat " Herron, who
    were chosen by Walter Camp on his first and second All-American teams.
        Similar rank was won by Pitt's basketball team, which went through a hard
    season with only two defeats against sixteen victories. Defeats administered to
    such opponents as Yale, Colgate, Lehigh, Lafayette, Rutgers, Penn State, W. &amp; J.
    and the Army, provided ample justification for a claim to the championship, not
    only of Pennsylvania-an honor won last year but of all the Eastern inter    collegiate world.
        The 1915 track season was quite successful in spite of the disappointment
    caused by the cancellation of the Intercollegiate meet, due to miserable weather
    conditions. The usual meets were held with Penn State, W. &amp; J., and Carnegie
    Tech, and for the first time with Syracuse. Several new University records were
    made, and the showing was in general most satisfactory.
        Handicapped by bad weather, which was responsible for the curtailment of
    the schedule, the record of the baseball team was somewhat erratic. The most
    pleasing feature of the season was the winning of the series with Penn State.
    Prospects for 1916 are very encouraging.
        In swimming the Blue and Gold accomplished good results. Pitted against
    the best intercollegiate talent, Pitt made a strong showing in every meet. Con    siderable interest was aroused in wrestling, and the grapplers made a record
    which, in view of all the circumstances, was altogether creditable. Wet weather
    proved the worst enemy of the tennis squad, though six matches were pulled off
    according to schedule.
      Freshman athletics have reached a high point of excellence during the past
    year, the yearlings maintaining a good record in football, baseball and basketball.
    Good material has been developed in all these departments for future use by the
    Varsity. With the institution of the one-year rule freshman teams will of course
    become even stronger and more representative.
        Equality of the sexes is practiced in athletics as in every other part of the
    University, and the co-eds have shown appreciation of their opportunity by,
    putting forth a championship sextet. Victories were won over Wilson, P. C. W.,
    Geneva, Beaver, and the College Club, until that time undefeated for seven years.
    Every member of this star aggregation will be available for two more years, so
    the floor championship in feminine circles seems reasonably certain of retention
    at Pitt.

COACH WARNER, CAPTAIN WILLIAMSON, MANAGER COLLINGWOOD
     From the first to last, from the time Collingwood and his assistants left Pittsburgh, late in August, to get Camp Hamilton in shape to receive visitors, to that
last day in November when the Blue and Gold athletes followed "Chalky" off
the gridiron, the 1915 season was a thing of beauty and a joy forever. "A season
without regrets," Warner called it; and he ought to know.
     Pitted against the strongest sort of opposition, the Panthers went through
the year undefeated, so that none but Cornell could claim equality with Our Own.
Playing a game remarkable alike for its simplicity and its effectiveness, Pitt gave
its rivals few opportunities-and short-lived opportunities, too---for rejoicing.
Victories over Old Penn, Navy, W. &amp; J., Penn State and the rest made the autumn
the happiest the oldest inhabitants can remember.
    Although team work was the determining factor in Pittsburgh success, there
was an abundance of individual stars, men who stood out above their antagonists
on other teams. For the first time on record, Pitt had a man on Camp's AllAmerican team, this honor being earned by "Bob" Peck, the Blue and Gold
center. "Pat" Herron landed a red ribbon with his selection as end on Camp's
second eleven. Other players, such as Hastings, Williamson and Soppitt, won
frequent mention by their choice on all-star teams.
     Bringing his brilliant gridiron career to a fitting close, "Chalky" Williamson
is succeeded in the captaincy by Peck, who inherits almost intact his predecessor's
great team. Of the letter men of 1915, Williamson, Hockensmith, Shapira and
Beattie will not return next fall. Their places will be hard to fill, but Coach
Warner will have on hand plenty of reserve material from which another strong
machine may be developed.
     No review of Pitt football would be complete without a tribute, however
small, to the work accomplished by Glenn S. Warner in his first year at the head
of football in the University. "Pop" rose to every emergency and fulfilled every
expectation. Gifted as a trainer and instructor of athletics, almost without equal
as a gridiron tactician, he was first of all a clean sportsman. His team not only
won games; it won the respect of every opponent. For what he has done in
bringing football to this high level, Warner deserves the gratitude of every Pitt
man.

        Fresh from training camp at Windber, the Warnerized machine started in
    with an easily won victory over Westminster   The United Presbyterians did
    their best, but that was not good enough. Williamson featured offensively, with
    two 50-yard runs. Students had their first look at the wealth of new material,
    and went home satisfied with it.
                        PITT 47; U. S. NAVAl. ACADEMY 12.
        Pitt's running attack was at its best against the Middies, and a field day for
    the Panthers was the result. The first touchdown came following the fifth play
    of the game, giving fair warning of what was to be the worst defeat ever suffered
    by the Sailors. An intercepted pass and -a recovered fumble gave the navy its
    only scores. "Jimmy" DeHart contributed the longest run of the intercol    legiate season when he caught a kick-off back of his own goal and ran 105 yards
    for a touchdown.
                        PITT 45; CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL 0.
        Glenn Warner's new pupils showed their superiority over the old in a game
    which, though one sided, was hard fought and interesting. Swinging interfer    ence was too much for the aborigines, who were unequal to the task of stopping
    Hastings, Fry, McLaren and the rest. The first score came with Williamson's
    40-yard return of a punt, and from then on it was largely a procession.
                       PITT 14; UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA 7.
        Minus the characteristic Pitt pep, and conceding all the breaks to the opposi    tion, the Panthers yet defeated Penn on Franklin Field before a crowd of twenty
    thousand who came to see the already famous invaders from the West. Loose
    handling of the ball lost the Blue and Gold several golden opportunities for a
    score, and it was a fumble which permitted Penn's score in the final minute of play.
    Herron and DeHart featured the afternoon with their work.
                          PITT 42; ALLEGHENY COLLEGE 7.
        Allegheny's spectacular aerial attack caused Pitt all sorts of trouble, and
    gave fans something to worry about before the Wash-Jeff game. The Metho    dists scored a touchdown early in the session, and bothered the University de    fense on other occasions. Panther power and punch proved a fine counter    irritant, however, and Allegheny was soon snowed under.
                     PITT 19; WASHIN(GTON &amp; JEFFERSON COLLEGE 0.
        This was the happiest day of a year overflowing with joy. The largest crowd
    in the history of the city saw Pitt administer a decisive beating to the Red and
    Black cohorts, balancing disappointments of three years past. Half one ended in
    a scoreless tie; but the break came early in the third quarter. Before Wash-Jeff
    could organize a counter attack, Hastings, Herron and Fry had burst through the
    W. &amp; J. defense for touchdowns, and the score was 19 to 0. The Folwell system
    of offense, designed to outzeppelin Zeppelin, came to earth with a dull thud, only
    7 out of 28 forward passes being carried through to a finish. Only once did
    W. &amp; J. have a chance for a score, and then their backers' hopes were dashed by
    Herron's recovery of a fumble and his long sprint for a score.

    With Hastings as the chief scoring unit, Pitt had an easy tine of it with the
sons of Carnegie. Buoyed up by a clean record of victories, the Plaid rooters
were expectant of a better showing by their favorites; but they were doomed to
disappointment. George McLaren shone brilliantly as a line-plunger.
                  PIT'r 20; P1NXSYLVANIA STAiTE COLLGE(; 0.
    For the third year in succession Pitt showed itself master over State in what
was without question the finest engagement of the whole year. A fumble on the
opening kick-off gave State the ball on the Blue and Gold's 7-yard line. Indomitable spirit and fight enabled Pitt to withstand the enemy's assaults. Anticipating everything in the way of a novel attack, State was surprised at Pitt's continuance of the simple formations which had won earlier games. Two goals from
field and two touchdowns accounted for the 20 points, the second touchdown
coming as the result of three consecutive runs by I)eHart, Williamson and Hastings, which advanced the ball 80 vards. Hastings was the individual star, grabbing 17 points as his share of the total.

    Leadership in a second branch of sport came Pitt's way this year, with a
record in basketball of 16 victories and 2 defeats. Defeats handed to such
doughty opponents as Yale, Colgate, Lafayette, Lehigh, Rutgers, Penn State and
the Army furnished plenty of backing for the University's claim of a place in the
sun. Allegheny and Lehigh, jinxes of old, were the only stumbling blocks in the
triumphal march of Flint's pets. Revenge was secured for the South Bethlehem
beating. The 1917 quintet must get back at the Meadville crowd for that 30-29
disappointment.
    Probably no one achievement of the season quite equalled the victory over
Penn State on the Blue and White's own floor, a feat which had never before been
accomplished by a Pitt delegation. This made the second successive season in
which the Panthers had shown their superiority in the floor pastime, and the
second major sport of the year to come Pittward.
    After that blow at Lehigh in the first game of the Eastern trip, everything
went merrily on the excursion toward the Orient. The big event of the journey
was the thumping handed to West Point, the first game lost by the Cadets on the
home floor for several seasons. Victories over Colgate and Yale were probably
the most pleasing features of the home season.
    Captain Lubic proved himself a remarkable leader, showing the way to his
team-mates on both offense and defense. All the regulars-Matson, McNulty,
McMasters and Hastings performed splendidly, as did the other members of the
Varsity squad-Carlson, Nicolas, Easterday and Monk. Lubic established what
is believed to be a record in intercollegiate circles, with a foul shooting average of
.723 for the season. With McMaster, the only member of the team to graduate,
prospects for 1917 are of the brightest sort.

                             palerbal 1915
     Pitt's 1915 baseball season was full of ups and downs, with a slight margin
in favor of the upward movement. At times playing unbeatable ball, performing in world's champion style, the following game would see an entire reversal
of form, with every man in the line up at his worst. Unspeakable weather, which
resulted in a considerable curtailment of the schedule, and interfered greatly with
practice, was a serious handicap.
    The real bright spot of the season was the winning of the series with State by
virtue of two shut-outs, both played at State College-this after the Nittany nine
had taken the first contest at Forbes Field. After Wash-Jeff had unexpectedly
landed a 1-0 victory over the Blue and Gold, the University retorted with a 6-2
win at Washington.
     In a season where clever pitching was the rule, Pitt defeats came usually
because of a paucity of basehits. Langdon and Hart, who (lid practically all the
twirling, were quite effective. The best effort of the year in this respect came
with the second Allegheny game, in which " Eddie " shut out the Methodists by a
10-0 count, striking out seventeen.
    S. B. Wilson,'14, former outfielder and captain of Pitt's diamond forces,
went through his first season as coach, and was re-engaged for 1916. Healy, last
year's leader, joined professional company at the close of the season. His successor in the captaincy is Purcell Beattie, for two years iegular catcher on the Varsitv. J. Steele Gow is the manager for this season. Newcomers to Pitts field
include Syracuse, Buffalo and Lafayette, while the Eastern trip covers two contests with the Navy and one with the Army.

     In no department of athletics has development been more steadily and more
consistent than in track. Sufficient evidence of Pitt's progress in this sport is
found in the fact that of fifteen University records in the various events, only
one the mark for the 100-yard dash  antedates 1908, the year when building
was begun upon the present campus. The record in the century, too, has been
tied Ly two men in recent years, and seems due for an early fall.
     The 1915 track season was not spectacularly successful; but the work showed
great improvement over any previous season, and gave prospect of even better
performance in future. This was the second year under the coaching of Professor
Kerr, whose efforts have resulted in an increase in track activity and achievement.
     Dual meets were held with Penn State, Syracuse, W. &amp; J., and Carnegie
Tech. The meet with Syracuse, the first athletic tilt between Pitt and the New
Yorkers, promises to become an annual event, supplementing clashes in football
and baseball. The only indoor meet, with Westinghouse Club, resulted in an
easy victory for the Blue and Gold, the Heeren trophy coming to the University
as a result.
    At the Penn relay games in Philadelphia on April 23 "Lou" McMaster
brought distinction upon himself and upon Pitt by winning third place in the
great pentathlon, competing against a large field. On the following day, the
Panther relay team, composed of Burwell, Cook, Mays and Grumbling, ran third
in their event.
    On May 1 Pitt visited Syracuse, coming home on the small end of an 83-43
score. Up against one of the best teams in the East, the Varsity's showing was
all that could be expected. Burwell, with victories in the two sprints, and
Sutherland, with a record-breaking disc throw, were the individual heroes of
the day.
    The next week Wash-Jeff fell victims to Pitt's prowess, a meet on the Schenlev oval resulting in a 95-31 victory. Two new records were hung up on this day,
in spite of the untoward weather conditions. Livermore, in his first year of competition, lowered the two-mile mark to 10 minutes 6 1-5 seconds, and Burwell
chalking up his third blue ribbon for the day, reduced the time for the quarter
to 50 3-5 seconds.
    Forbes Field was the scene of the Panthers' romp with Carnegie Tech, in
which the Plaid got 42 1-3 points out of a possible 126. Sheehan, Sutherland
and McMaster each contributed ten points, McMaster wrecking his own pole
vault record with a spring of 11 feet 8% inches. The afternoon was marned by
an accident to Burwell which kept the colored speeder out for the balance of the
season.
    Rain for four consecutive days submerged the Oval and prevented the Tenth
Annual Intercollegiate and Interscholastic Meet for the Western Pennsylvania
championships, and Pitt's season closed on June 7, at State College, when State
defeated the Varsity 82 to 44 points. "Johnny" Sheehan boosted his broad
jump record by more than a foot, skipping 23 feet 52 inches, and Grumbling cut
the half-mile mark to two minutes flat.
    One factor which materially reduced Pitt's total of points during the year
was the absence of Captain Scott, who in the preceding season had captured
records for both the low and high hurdles. Louis McMaster,'16, was elected
captain for the coming spring, giving the all-round star an honor which he well
deserved.

    Scarcity of material was the one drawback to the best season the Blue and
Gold swimming squad has yet had. Four men carried almost the entire burden
of competition with teams which stand in the very front rank, and maintained
this competition in such a way as to make every meet and every event a close one.
    The first engagement of the winter was at Annapolis, where Pitt met Navy
for the third time in as many years. As on other occasions, Pitt lost the contest;
but never before had the Middies' margin been so narrow. Remarkable swimming won the relay for the Panthers, and two other firsts came Pittward. The
final count was 36 to 24, with Navy ahead. Swope's work featured, from a Pitt
standpoint.
    Harry Taylor was the big star for Pittsburgh in the struggle with Penn at
Philadelphia two nights later, the Freshman natator landing two first places.
This meet was not so close as that with the Navy, but close finishes were the rule.
Lehmann, of Penn, broke the intercollegiate record in the plunge for distance.
    Returning to Pittsburgh, the swimmers faced their hardest test in a meet
with Chicago, the first athletic event ever carded between Pitt and the Midway
institution. The Westerners presented a remarkably strong team, which had
credit for a decisive victory over the Navy. Pitt held the lead during a large
part of the evening, and it took the last event to decide the winner, Chicago
landing ahead. Several new records were made, both for the University and for
the district. Kenneth Lovejoy led the Varsity in scoring, while Earle got three
firsts for Chicago.
    In addition to these meets, Pitt won two open meets held at the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association, involving the local championship. Sweet is the only letter
man lost by graduation this year, and everything looks rosy for better things
in 1917.

    Wrestling, which received its start at the University only three years ago,
is now firmly established. Pitt interest in the mat sport is shown by the large
squad of candidates which reported early in the year and worked throughout the
season under the direction of Coach Reinecke.
    Four matches were scheduled in collegiate company, with additional competition in open meets. Penn State was encountered twice, at home and abroad,
Navy at Annapolis, and Lehigh at Trees Gymnasium.
    The best showing of the year was made against the best opponent. The
Middies, who stood at the very top in wrestling this year, losing not a single
match, defeated Pitt only 20 to 13, winning four bouts to three for the Varsity.
    Penn State proved the real jinx, taking both matches by a good margin, and
Lehigh also got a big majority of the points. Most of the bouts were lost on decisions, however, indicating lack of experience on the part of the Pitt grapplers,
with promise of much stronger competition in another season.

     Jupiter Pluvius, that same old divinity who did so much to discourage
baseball and track enthusiasts, did his best to wipe out the 1915 tennis schedule.
Of the ten matches arranged, four were cancelled because of wet courts. The
remaining six matches, however, were productive of some genuinely good tennis,
Pitt contesting with some of the leading aggregations of the intercollegiate
world.
    Through the courtesy of Mr. E. D. Seitz, the Trafford City courts were secured
for the elimination tournament, which resulted in the selection of the Varsity
quartet. McEllroy and Gaut were the hold-overs from the preceding year, Ebe
and Haines filling out the lineup.
     Interest in the court game boomed with the formation of the University
Tennis Association, with Walter G. Flood,'16, as president. This organization
has as its platform the establishment of permanent courts on the campus, a move
which should result in great good in the development of Varsity material.

    In the track house hangs a collection of photographs of individuals and
teams who have done most to bring athletic reputation and honor to the University. The Hall of Fame, established in the fall of 1913, is designated to perpetuate the memories of the men who, on gridiron, diamond, track, or elsewhere,
have carried the Blue and Gold banner into high places. Championship teams,
three-letter athletes, record-breaking track men, coaches, managers, and others
who have rendered distinguished service in athletics-these compose the list of
eligibles to the Hall. Following are those who have already won a place:
                     Football teams of 1913, 1914, 1915.
                     Basketball teams of 1915, 1916.
                     Baseball teams of 1914, 1915.

    "She guards more confidences than any

    The Pitt Socialist Club was organized in November, 1914. It is a chapter
of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, a national organization which has more
than seventy chapters among the largest colleges of the country. The aim of
the organization is to promote an intelligent interest in socialism among college
men and women.
    Some of the well known men who have been connected with the work of the
national society are Jack London, Upton Sinclair, Morris Hilquet, John Spargo,
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, J. G. Phelps Stokes, Clarence Darrow and William
English Walling.

    The local chapter does not concern itself solely with socialism, but investigates current problems of social and economic interest, and its membership includes all those interested in such subjects. Weekly meetings are held, addresses
by prominent speakers alternating with a study class. Spargo and Arner's
"Elements of Socialism" is the text used by the study class.

     The year 1915-1916 will in the future annals of the University mark the
 virtual beginning of the expansion of the religious activity of the institution. In
 October, the first all-time, paid general secretary the Young Men's Christian
 Association has had, George Morrill Kirk, Col. Asso..'12, arrived in Pittsburgh.
 Under his leadership the work of the Association has been more thoroughly organ ized and executed than was ever possible under student leadership solely, and the
 basis has been quietly, but none the less surely laid for a complete and far reach ing religious movement within the next few years.
     Although hampered by lack of facilities and equipment, the Association has
during the past year accomplished some notable achievements. All committees
and departments have shown an increase in interest and scope of work done.
Social service has been extended to all the city settlements, with a large number
of men engaged, particularly at the Sarah Heinz House and the Soho Settlement.
I)eputation and team work to churches and Y. M. C. A.'s of the Pittsburgh district has received a great impetus, and many men have taken voluntary part in
this work. A portion of the annual salary of W. Russell Augur, a physics teacher
in the Canton Christian College, China, has been raised by the missionary department. "The Prodigals," a sturdy Bible class and social group for boys away
from home, has prospered under the leadership of James C. Mace. Eriendly
relations have been established -with the different foreign students of the University,
by a series of delightful dinners. Other active branches of the work have been
the visitation, temperance, vocational, social and publicity. Two series of meetings have been held during the spring semester, one of formal addresses by prominent speakers, the other of open discussion under student leadership. Delegates have been sent to several conferences and a large number are expected to
go to the Eaglesmere summer conference.

    The Pitkin Club is primarily a mission group, under the auspices of the
Young Women's and Young Men's Christian Associations, which meets every
Wednesday noon in the chapel of the Shadyside Presbyterian church for luncheon
and discussion. The club, which is now in the third year of its existence, having
been organized in the winter of 1914, has a membership of about forty young
men and women, and has been a potent influence in the religious life of the University, under the leadership of Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr. The course of the
study during the present year has included Robert EI. Speer's "South American
Problems."

     Before taking upon ourselves the honor of giving public notice to the accomplishments of the class of nineteen seventeen, we thought it fitting to give the
members of the faculty an opportunity to express their opinions. We therefore
interviewed some of them and asked their judgment as to whether any of our
future greatness was visible when we first entered this University near two score
months ago. The majority of those who replied stated that this splendid class
in its freshman year largely resembled the classes that had preceded it. Some
of the more astute instructors, however, claim that traces of our future prowess
were discernible from the beginning and that they realized from their first contact with us, what heights we were bound to attain. But this point of resemblance to other classes is of negligible importance, for even those who felt that we
were to accomplish great things now admit that we have surpassed their fondest
" We had a ripping time when we broke up the Soph dance."
expectations. Some of their tributes are as follows: "We have never seen such
a class before." "You should all graduate in three years; in fact we wish you
would."   "We can never forget you."  "You have surely done wonders to Pitt."
"You have been with us three years and we are satisfied."
     But lest these well meant tributes affect our modesty and we begin to exaggerate, let us look for a moment at ourselves as we appeared three years ago.
Incredible as it may seem this Junior Class was once composed of freshmen possessed of the freshie concomitants- bashfulness, verdure, ignorance, and a notion
that one comes to college to study. Three short years have wrought marvelous
changes. The confidence of accomplishment has superseded our youthful humility,
ignorance and the taint of green have been obliterated; and the oblivion into
which mere students are consigned has kept us from the dangers of overstudy.

      We began our career as freshmen by defeating the sophomores in the class
 rush; not officially, to be sure, for the points were on the side of the sophs, but we
 really deserved to win and would have done so had we but won a few more events.
 Socially, however, we were quite a success in our first year, as any of the present
 seniors who attended the dance which they attempted to hold in their sophomore
 year, can well testify. Do you remember how we heartlessly separated those poor
 men from their frauleins and took them, the men, to the Jungles of Panther
 Hollow? We are not so eager as to inquire as to your memory of the baldheaded
 freshies who roamed the campus for several months thereafter, but their scalps
 were not taken without a struggle, and many a senior of today can tell of the
 fierceness of those combats.
     Several months before the date set for the cap
 night we had already discarded our freshie hats, but
 just to be sociable we went up to the stadium on the
 slushy Cap Night in February and consumed the pret zels and cider furnished in honor of our emancipation.
 After that there wasn't much excitement in our first
 year, and soon June arrived and we went home and got
 a job, or continued to loaf until we came back in Sep tember.
     For the first few months of the 1914 school year
 we did our duty to the new crop of freshies and started
 them as best we could on the paths of righteousness
 and sobriety. They were a very uncultivated group
 but rather tame and plastic on the whole, and after we
 had taken a few of the latent Samsons to tonsorial
 palaces, and removed from others the violent and dis tasteful socks that they tended to wear, they began to
 recognize the superior knowledge and power of the
 1917 sophs and to act accordingly. Deprived from
 any further amusement from that source, we looked
 around and began to fill up the niches that looked
 worth while. Then, with a few banquets we closed
 the accounts of the year and returned as Juniors.
     It is not necessary to do more than hastily review
the events of this year in which the Juniors have participated. The best Owl ever compiled has just been
published; our basketball team has completed one ofits most successful seasons; and last Thanksgiving day
the greatest football team that ever wore the Gold and
Blue downed Penn State in the final game of a schedule that included Navy, Allegheny, Carlisle, W. and
J., and Penn.
     But we are forgetting ourselves in pride of our
University. We have delayed long enough; we must
introduce our notables to you. Permit us to present as a member of the class of 1917, Robert Durham
Peck, the only man in the history of Pitt ever chosen   "Socially, we had
on the All-American football team; and as fellow        no peers."
members of the champion college team of 1915, "Ted" Fry, "Dutch" Hockensmith, "Joe" Matson, Thornhill, Soppitt, Morrow, McQuiston, and the others
of 1917 who helped to make the success of the eleven who receive the major part
of the glory.
    If we turn to track activities, who has not heard of our Black Diamond
Express, "Jim" Burwell? And "Stan" Scott, "Lew" McMasters, "Johnny"

   Sheehan, Grumbling and Livermore? In the water, Ludwig and Swope have
   ably represented us. On the diamond "Eddie" Landgon has twirled in many,
   a victory. " Ben " Lubic started his career with us and Matson joined him a year
   later on the basketball floor, so that'17 would be fittingly accounted for. "Jimmy"''
   Jones and Ian Forbes on the wrestling team, and "Charlie" Gaut and Wallace
   Ebe, of tennis fame, claim allegiance to 1917.
        It can be seen that we have given our full share of men to athletics but
   at the same time we have not neglected other activities. As Reader of the
   Musical Clubs, President of the Class, and other positions of equal importance,
''Jack'' Thompson is one of'17's best known constituents.''Bill" Canan, Leader
   of the Musical Clubs, Weekly Staff, Owl Controller, Track Team, etc., has also
   attained prominence. And b)efore we forget and get in very much wrong, we
;  must notice Manager " Bill" Arther and Editor " Eddie " George, perpetrators
   of this publication; the list of their other crimes may be found elsewhere.  (We
   must give them a boost to get this by.) For three years Alvin Johnston has
   given us his life-like impersonations in the Cap and Gown show; "Scotty"
   Forbes has wandered among the different organizations bringing fame to each
   in turn; "Butch " Ochsenhirt, of yodeling fame, is numbered among 1917; " Jake"
   Kwallwasser, our master of the piano, is known to all; and no list of noted Juniors
   would be complete to an Economic student without the name of that fountain
   of knowledge and genial questioner, "''Cash-book"'' Schietinger.
                            "Masters of all we surveyed."
       Perhaps we may seem impolite, but we have really been thinking about the
   girls all the time; last is the best, and we saved the best place for them. Miss
   Irene Garrison needs no introduction to those who have heard her sing at assem   bly; Myra McBride busies herself with Executive Committee jobs, and sings for
   us sometimes, too; Alica Musser is the W. A. A. chieftainess; " Lou " Moye, aside
   from being on the Owl staff, manages the girls' basketball team; Alpha Burkhart
   took time off from her duties long enough to help write the girls' May-Day
   Festival; and Helen Hunt, in her untiring hunt for something new, created Chit   Chat in the Weekly for the satiation of the impoverished horde seeking news.
       If we have grown too zealous in praise of our class, consider the occasion and
   accept our apology; if we have slighted the merits of 1917, credit it to our mod   esty. But remember, whatever else you forget that there will never be another
   class like that of 1917. When we pass from the portals of Pitt one year from now,
   the University will undergo an irreparable change for better or worse, we believe
   for the worse. But the class of 1917 is not conceited; we have simply proven our
   worth--we're there, that's all. We don't claim it, we admit it.

 "Mourning tle Zash- eff (oat"
'Twas clear and balmy weather.
   For the sun had risen high,
The clouds they knew not whither
  They were going by and by.
We people rose that morning,
  There was something in the air.
You could tell by our adorning
  That'twas something very rare.
We had waited years upon it,
  And at last we had our chance.
We jumped it like a cricket;
  You may bet we made them dance.
The crowd surged'round the ball field
  With their colors to the breeze;
Their numbers made our minds yield
  And our hot blood in us freeze.
Before the gates had opened,
  Yea, their mouths to swallow up,
The seats had all been taken
  Like the sweet wine in a cup.
The bleachers all were sold out
  Fven down to standing room
They were herded'round the race route
  With the coppers as their groom.
To the left of the gridiron
  Stood the bulwark of our tribe.
All the students, wild and woolly,
  Yes,'tis awful to describe.
In suspenders were they waiting
  For the crucial time to come;
Indeed were almost hating
  Every man from Washington.

Just now Iefore the rooters,
   Band music rent the air;
 I'Twas but our bunch of tooters,
 And with music they were there.
 W\ash-Jeff band was put to shame,
   Yea, we (lid it up all brown.
We tooted more before that game
  Than ever before in town.
"Butch" hopped upon his platform
  Just as nimble as a flea.
Led out with his well known form
  That grand old Al-le-ge-nee.
)ur vells rolled out long and loud,
  The alumni answered back:
Hurled into that Wash-Jeff crowd
  That, "Why dontchu-(lontChu quack."
An answer could then be heard,
  Whenever we quieted down.
'Twas the breeze from Jea-Jea-Jea,
  Just a cry from Wash-Jeff town.
Running, came our sturdy bunch
  Of warriors, so strong and hold,
Just like young lions out for lunch
  In perhaps a shepherd's fold.
Folwell brought his lambkins out;
  He did not know their danger
Till his sheep were put to rout,
  And fleeing to their manger.
The whole darned crowd went wild with zeal;
  The teams lined up for battle.
You can't imagine how you feel
  Amid the din and rattle.

Scampered up and down the field;
   We charged their line and booted;
 Tried our line, it would not yield;
   It stood as if'twere rooted.
 Played as if at hide and seek,
   \We watched them verv closely.
 We jotted down the places weak,
   Observed their passes mostly.
 Hastings tried at several goals
   To loosen up his foot some.
 Knew to whom the blacon rolls,
   From whence it ought to come from.
'Fre one half the game had passed;
   Our Chalky had their number.
Gave his signals clear and fast;
   He did not make a blunder.
At last the whistle sounded loud;
  The teams went off the fie d then.
From the bleachers came our crowd
  Just like so many children.
We snake-danced over all that field,
  The " Fresh " and upper classmen.
Before us,. a coffin scaled,
  Wash-Jeff was made to bow then.
Made that mighty P of yore
  And wept our neighbors' downfall.
Yelled again, then yelled some more,
  And broke on Butch's high ball.
Wash-Jeff came out first this time,
  Soon after came our fellows;
Again their frames our boys climb
  Amid the shouts and bellows.

Hastings hit their left end hard,
   He scampered for a touchdown;
 No \Wash-Jeff man could him retard,
   He ran just like a greyhound.
So on the battle waxes hot,
  The rooters vell themselves hoarse,
  Pat Herron then a fumble got,
  He ran like on a race course.
Two touchdowns then were not enough,
  Our boys were out for glory;
Their wavs then were kind a rough,
  Such can't lie told in story.
Ted took that ball, punched the line;
  He threw them helter skelter.
The way he did it sure was fine,
  Wash-Jeff just had to falter.
Three touchdowns against'er now;
  We kicked the ball from danger.
Wash-Jeff was whipped then anyhow,
  Whv hurt ourselves for pleasure?
Hail Pop Warner as the man,
  Who taught Wash-Jeff her lesson;
Hail the pupils of his clan,
  XWho kept them all a guessin'.
'Fore that sun had gone to rest,
  Our crowd went on a rampage;
WVe beat our foe at her best,
  They think it yet an outrage.
We gloried in that victory,
  We cut ourselves asunder.
The greatest day in history,
  Dates round that date, by thunder.

ELECTRIC SERVICE
   I Almost every large manufacturing plant, office build   ing and department store in Pittsburgh is now purchasing
   electric service from us in place of maintaining separate
   electric power plants. There are many reasons for this,
   but the controlling factors are greater economy, higher
   efficiency, greater elasticity, absolute freedom from smoke
   and elimination of the many annoyances incident to
   individual plant operation.
   41 If you have any power problem which is giving you
   vexation, call Grant 4300, Contract Department, and let
   one of our power engineers help you solve it. Our aim
   is to give perfect electric service.

    Here we have the pride of the University and the
  joy of existence. At last the eighth marvel of the
  world has been disclosed. Here is a man who thinks
  that he knows that he thinks, and thinks that he
  knows the processes by which he thinks. We think
  not.

    If heart were brains, Tuck woulcl be an All-Amer  ican chemist. As it is, we would rather ask him for a
  beaker than for a structural formula, although he is
  equally willing to give you either. He has a very
  genteel look from behind, and the fact that he ex  hibits his singing talent elsewhere than in the labor  atory shows uncommonly good sense for an upper

    Earle has to stoop to fill a burette. He has a cata  lytic grin that will accelerate any reaction. He still
  retains the good looks and bashfulness that should be  long to a college man, but another year with us will
  set him right. Is also a model home entertainer and
  one night stand minstrel. Too     busy collecting
  money to do any work in Gas Analysis, however.

    The College sustained some heavy losses when the
  School of Chemistry was founded, but this is the one
  most appreciated by us. Her smile is chemical re  sistive and remains untarnished in the most acid
  atmosphere. But if a fellow upsets an analysis or
  breaks a $5 flask, Miss Buchanan is sure to be in the
  room to prevent him from saying what he thinks.

    On one of those rare occasions on which he visited
  Pitt, he was heard to ask the professor for a solid
  tube. And still he wonders why the hair contains
  calcium phosphate. Claims to work twenty-three
  hours a day, but we have our doubts. But he's there
  in a pinch, and that is a good deal.

    When the nuts begin to fall the squirrels begin to
  bark. The ancient Greek philosopher spoke these
  truthful words. "There is a time for work and a
  time for play." But to " Rosy "'' goes the honor of the

  With many a smoke thrown in throughout the dreary
        day."
