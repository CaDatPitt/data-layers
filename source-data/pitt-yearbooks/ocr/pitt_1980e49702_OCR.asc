            To have a successful athletic program, you have to have quality athletes. To get those quality
     athletes you need good support behind your program. And that great backing is exactly what the Pitt
 Golden Panthers give to the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Program. The Golden Panthers are made up
     of faculty, students, alumni, and friends that donate anywhere from $35 to $1,000 and more. For their
 donations priviledges such as parking at home games, ticket discounts, and receiving the Golden Panther
 Prints are had. The Golden Panthers are sponsors of the Hungry Panther Brunches before home football
games, the Bar B-Q to introduce the public to Panther football players, the annual Spring Game, and many
other activities for its members to participate in. The Golden Panthers offer trips at discount rates to their
      members. Because of this many follow our teams on the road and cheer them on to victory. For this
                         support the athletes, coaches, and fans alike benefit from Pitt Panther Sports.

  The 1979 football team played to
an 11-1 record and finished the
season ranked sixth and seventh in
the wire service polls.
  Overall balance helped Pitt
establish itself as the best team in
the East. One of the most highly
publicized players to come to Pitt in
years, quarterback Dan Marino was
called to the front in the Navy game
when Rick Trocano went down with
a hamstring injury. The freshman
from Central Catholic High
impressed the crowd by completing
22 of 30 passes for 227 yards, and
Pitt avenged its 1978 loss to the
Midshipmen. Junior College
transfer fullback Randy McMillan
rushed for 141 yards in Pitt's
season opening 24-0 whitewash of
the Kansas Jayhawks at Pitt
Stadium. A strong, bullish runner,
McMillan also dazzled the
Washington Huskies in a 26-14
victory, which silenced the critics
who said Head Coach Jackie
Sherrill and his squad couldn't beat
top flight competition.
  Senior split end Ralph Still and
tight end Benjy Pryor came into
their own as receivers for Trocano
and Marino: each caught over 40
passes, and turned what had been
a pre-season question mark
into a post-season exclamation
point. For the first time in several
years, Pitt had good speedy
tailbacks in Rooster Jones, Fred
Jacobs, and Artrell Hawkins.
  Much of Pitt's highly acclaimed
dominating defense was produced
by Hugh Green, a three-time AllAmerican, and his partner at
defensive end, Ricky Jackson.
Tackles Greg Meisner and Bill Neill
gained confidence and skill as
juniors, and middle guard Jerry
Boyarsky was an immovable object
for opposing centers.
  Free safety JoJo Heath was the
veteran among Pitt's defensive
secondary, which was also a
pleasant surprise. Strong safety
Carlton Williamson was an able
replacement for Jeff Delaney, and
Terry White and Lynn Thomas, by
season's end, were as good a pair
of junior cornerbacks as any in the
country.

player title as the Panthers beat
Arizona by the score of 16-10 in the
Fiesta Bowl played on Christmas
Day.
  With the bulk of the squad
returning for 1980, Pitt looks
capable of duplicating its 1976 12-0
national championship season.
Next year's seniors will be the first
recruiting class brought in by
Sherill, and like his predecessor,
Johnny Majors, Sherrill should have
an equally fun time in his fourth
year at Pitt.

  17TH IN NATION
        The Pitt Cheerleaders
    finished 17th in this year's
        National Cheerleading
    Competition. A tape of the
        squad's activities was
submitted for the competition,
  and was graded by directors
            of various college
         cheerleading camps.
         Pyramids and dancing
routines were emphasized this
      year during football and
   basketball games. Lifts and
 gymnastic stunts also played
              important roles.
  According to captain Penny
       Campbell, the crowd at
  football games is better now
    than in past years. This is
mostly due to the introduction
   of simple cheers, which the
   fans can easily follow along
 and join in. More response is
 expected next season, as the
   entire university cheers the
       Panthers on to another
       championship season.

BETTER LUCK NEXT SEASON
  A funny thing happened to the
Pitt soccer team on its way through
the 1979-80 season - it forgot how
to score goals. This in itself isn't
funny, particularly if it obtains a
team a 4-9-2 record, but Pitt lost so
many 1-0 matches, it became almost routine.
  The Panthers managed just 12
goals through 15 games, a situation
stemming from the team's lack of
success in incorporating the play of
each line. Pitt had lost seven players to graduation, plus Johnny
O'Hara and Karl Nigh, who left to
play professional soccer.
  One of the high points of the
season, however, was a 2-0 win
over Davis and Elkins, perenially a
strong soccer school. Four Panthers were given honorable mention in the Western Pennsylvania
Interscholastic Soccer Conference
(WPISC) all-star ratings: Danny
Jamm, midfielder; Jeff Tissue, wing;
Tom Leibenguth, fullback; and Tom
Trempus, midfielder.
  Next season, Pitt will shift its
scheduling emphasis to WPISC
schools. In the past, the boosters
have faced a number of teams outside their conference, such as
Penn State and Temple, but will not
try to mostly play just those schools
within the WPISC.

LEAGUE
WINNERS
  In only its second year of existence,
the volleyball Panthers surprised many
teams in the East by winning its division
of the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League (ECVL) and placing third in the
league championships.
  Pitt was 8-0 against division
opponents Penn, George Mason, New
Jersey Institute of Technology and
Princeton, thus earning an automatic bid
to the ECVL tournament.
  In this tournament, the Panthers
dropped an opening-round match to
George'Mason, but came back with wins
over Princeton and Army to finish third
overall. Freshman middle blocker Don
Hardin was a first-team ECVL
tournament selection, while setter Dave
Baird was named to the second team.
  Head coach Ray Reilley and assistant
coach Mike Hebert awarded the team
MVP award to outside hitter Jeff Beavers
for the second year in a row.
students at Pitt celebrated their hertiage with
the Tenth Annual Black Week. While a group
of select Pitt Students fought over a Student
Activities Fee increase, the registration for
winter term was upon all of us. Advisors
worked overtime (sometime) to get all Pitt
students into the courses of their choice or
not. The SGB elections were held and to no
ones surprise, William Abraham was elected
President by a landslide margin. The campus
Police were called in to investigate several
bomb threats made on the Russian Room at
the Cathedral of Learning. And last but not
the least, the American Hostage situation in
Iran broke out. There were many short fuses
with Iranian students on campus. The month
ended with 26 days of captivity for the
Hostages in the U.S. Embassey.
DECEMBER 1979 - The month was short as
the Fall Term 80 came to a halt. Pitt finally
beat Penn State in Beaver Stadium. Final
score Pitt 29 - PSU 14. The Panthers
prepared for a bowl trip to Arizona and the
Pitt Band was told they couldn't go because
of cost, the Student Activities Fee increase
was okayed, Americans were still hostages
in Iran, finals came, then Merry Christmas -
Happy New Year.
JANUARY 1980 - Students returned after an
extra week of vacation. The Panthers had
been successful in the Fiesta Bowl as were
the Pittsburgh Steelers awaiting their Fourth
Super Bowl appearance. As classes began
Pitt Students were treated to letting their
fingers doing the dailing on long distance
calls free on the Towers Lobby phones. The
Super Steelers did it once again and so did
most Pitt Students. We were in the streets
celebrating as the Campus &amp; City Police
overlooked it all. Tim Grugrich had the
Panthers win basketball, Ma Bell was tracing
culprits of the free long distance calls. Dave

                           EASTERN CHAMPIONS
     After a first-place finish in the
 East in 1978, the 1979 Pantherette
 volleyball team was faced with the
 difficult task of defending its status
 as the team to beat. Improvement
 on the part of several other Eastern
 powers made the season a time of
     experimentation and, at times,
     frustration. But in the end, the
     spikers proved themselves the
     class of the East once again as
  they won the Eastern Association
     of Intercollegiate Athletics for
 Women (EAIAW) Championship to
qualify for nationals. And with many
   underclass players on the team,
      Pitt will not soon be ready to
            relinquish its Eastern
                  championship.

  The Pantherette field hocky team
is one of the newer Pitt squads,
and in its fourth year is still in the
process of establishing itself. The
stickwomen compiled a 3-8 record
under coach Audrey Davis and sent
several Pantherettes to all-star
games.
  According to Davis, the highlight
of the season was a first-ever win
over Slippery Rock State College
during the Rockets' invitational
tournament. Sophomore Dee Dee
Kanter was a member of the
Mideast III all-star team which
played in the national tournament
in Edison, New Jersey over the
Thanksgiving holidays.
  "We should have everyone back
next year," said Davis. "We'll be
working out with weights during the
off season in preparation."

                                 SIRIANO COMPETES
                IN NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS
          In a year which saw the
    elimination of the Pitt women's
 cross-country team due to budget
    cuts, the Panther harriers were
    careful in choosing their meets.
    The season started out with two
tough races, run back-to-back. The
       Panthers placed sixth in the
 Eastern Eight championships, held
late in September, then participated
        the next day in the City of
Pittsburgh's Great Race, along with
        over 10,000 other runners.
    Road races became popular in
1979. Pitt later ran in the Pittsburgh
  Magazine Marathon five-mile race
  and in the Miller Lite Classic. From
  a collegiate standpoint, however,
  the season was highlighted by the
  qualification of MVP Gary Siriano
       for the NCAA cross-country
    championships, held at Lehigh
    University in November. Siriano
       placed 63rd out of over 250
   competitors, missing all-America
        status by only nine places.
   Individually, Siriano placed 11th
      in the Great Race, 2nd in the
Pittsburgh Magazine run, first in the
     Lite Classic, 6th in the Eastern
 Eight individual standings and 11th
    at the NCAA Eastern Qualifying
      meet. Pitt's Randy Bailey was
      consistently the number two
   runner, placing 28th in the Great!
   Race and also competing in the
   NCAA Eastern Qualifying meet.
120
121
        RELAY IN
NCAA MEET
         The Panther track team's indoor
         season ended with the two-mile
         relay's participation in the NCAA
         championships. The relay of Joel
         Albers, Terry Gallagher, Darren
       Geary and Greg Conover made the
         trip to Detroit for the mid-March
           championship meet. They had
       broken the Pitt indoor track record
       with a 7:29.4 clocking at the East
           Tennessee Invitational in early
      January, and also won the mile and
        two-mile relays in the first annual
                  Coaches' Conference
          championship (hosted by Pitt).
        Distance runner Gary Siriano was
             the team's most consistent
             individual during the indoor
             season. Competing against
         national-calibre runners all year,
         the senior's best effort was in the
             Princeton Relays, where he
        finished third in the 3000 meters.
122
MORE WINS
  Pitt opened its outdoor track
season by sending two relay teams
plus distance runner Gary Siriano to
Gainesville, Florida for the annual
Florida Relays. The Panthers came
back five days later with suntans and
a second-place finish for Siriano in
the 5000 meters, plus a fourth-place
showing by the two-mile relay of Joel
Albers, Terry Gallagher, Greg Conover
and Darren Geary.
  Two weeks later, the same nine
Panthers competed in the University
of Tennessee's Dogwood Relays,
where Siriano placed sixth. After
competing in the Penn Relays in late
April, Pitt had a few weeks away from
meets in order to prepare for its own
annual outdoor invitational.
  Late-season meets scheduled were
the Coaches' Conference
championships hosted by Rutgers,
the Penn State Invitational and the
Central Collegiate championships at
Bowling Green.
                             123
TWO HARD
     SEASONS
        The decade started with a long
          cold winter and a short, bitter
            indoor track season for the
       Pantherettes. Pitt only had three
    regularly-scheduled meets in which
    to qualify its athletes for the indoor
       Eastern championships, and fell
                      miserably short.
        The same budget cut which left
      the team without a cross-country
          season didn't allow for much
     indoor competition and as a result,
       only four individuals and a relay
     team qualified for the EAIAW meet
     in Boston. Nonetheless, shot putter
       Peri Jude Padicio placed sixth in
       her event at Boston, while Margie
       Lee set a new team record in the
                        two-mile run.
      The entire team competed in the
             Ohio State Lady Buckeye
        Invitational, the Michigan State
        Invitational, and of course, Pitt's
        own indoor invitational meet. A
      total of 24 teams took part in the
      Pitt meet, which was won by the
    University of Maryland for the third
                        straight year.
       Compared to the indoor season,
    the outdoor portion of the 1979-80
        year was worse; Pitt lost its top
        runner (Gwen Murray), Thrower
        (Peri Jude Radecic), and jumper
          (Cissy Wilborn) for the entire
                     outdoor season.
        Pitt competed in its own relays
        meet, the Virginia and Maryland
    Invitationals, plus the Penn Relays.
    The Pantherettes were host to the
    fifth annual Eastern Association of
    Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
      (EAIAW) championships in early
    May. Freshman Kathy Dvorsak was
       the only Pitt woman to meet the
     toughened EAIAW standards and
     placed an admirable ninth in only
     her fourth-ever pentathelon. For
       this achievement, Dvorsak was
    awarded the team's MVP award by
                coach Alfreeda Goff.
      With all but two seniors (Brenda
      Chorpenning and Maria Sciullo)
      returning next season, plus the
   addition of several key athletes who
   missed the season due to injuries,
               1981 should be better.

410~1 JA ROUGH
SEASON
  First-year head coach Randy
Stottlemyer said he felt Pitt's 3-13-1
wrestling season is the result of
much change in a very short time.
When former coach Dave Adams
left Pitt to take the athletic
director's job at San Jose State,
Stottlemyer (25 years old) became
one of the country's youngest head
coaches at a Division I school.
  "The team was used to
somebody for a long time and had
become accustomed to a certain
personality and philosophy," said
Stottlemyer. "It was tough
adjusting."
  The Panthers were troubled by
injuries as well as the loss of
several wrestlers who quit the team
early in the year. These two factors,
plus one of the toughest schedules
Pitt has ever faced, accounted for
the rough year. Stottlemyer and
assistant coach Chuck Coryea said
they were "disappointed, but not
discouraged" and picked the
Panthers' 23-17 win over Syracuse
as the highpoint of the season.
  Pitt was also not without an
NCAA qualifier. Mike Bond (150
Ibs.) made it to the NCAA
championships in Oregon, but
unfortunately separated his
shoulder in the first round.
  Only three wrestlers were lost to
graduation: Ed Bredniak, Wayne
Lawrence, and Steve Smocharski.
While recruiting for these weights
will be emphasized, it will be quite a
chore to find someone to fill the
very large shoes of 400-pound
heavyweight Smocharski.

A POPULAR
         SPORT
              Gymnastics coach Frank
         D'Amico said he was extremely
           pleased with his team's 1980
      season and the Panthers' stastics
      back him up. Pitt finished with a 6-2
      record, which included wins over
          Temple and William and Mary.
          "The level of gymnastics at Pitt
      has increased tremendously in the
        last few years," added D'Amico.
        And so has the sport's popularity.
      Two thousand spectators attended
      the men's and women's dual-meet
         against Penn State in January.
           D'Amico said that the team's
        goals for next season include "a
          shot at the nationals for a few
                         individuals."
128
SEASON OF
   INJURIES
   The Pantherette gymnasts'
 greatest foe during the 1979-80
 season was not Penn State or West
 Virginia, but injuries. Not once
 throughout the year did coach
 Donna Sanft's team take to the
 floor without at least one or two
 regulars confined to the sidelines
 with injuries.
 "It was a very frustrating
 season," said Sanft. "Our girls
 knew they were a much better team
 than they were able to show on the
 floor."
 The team still managed a winning
 record, finishing 7-4 in dual meets
 and first in their own Pitt
 Invitational. Pitt was also seventh at
 the Windy City Invitational and sixth
 in the Eastern regionals.

FIRST LOSING SEASON IN YEARS
      Many teams would consider 7-9-2
    at least a fair record but for the first
        time in recent years, the Pitt ice
          hockey club suffered a losing
       season. Coached by Greg Stein,
     the Panthers were a club made up
             of many first-year college
                        competitors.
      "We also had four games against
      Kent State," pointed out Panther
          Curt Hetz, "and KSU is really
        tough, a little above our class."
           Veteran center Hetz led the
       Icemen offensively with 82 shots
       and 21 goals, while Cliff Ziegler
          was top assist player with 22.
     Goalie Larry Newell owned an 82%
     save average, allowing 76 goals out
     of 423 shots against. Both Hetz and
     Newell had been invited to try out
     for the 1980 United States Olympic
           team the previous summer.
           Team members said they felt
     Pitt's 4-3 win over Duquesne at the
     Civic Arena was the high point of
       the year, although the Panthers
       later bowed to the Dukes in the
       finals of the annual Candlelight
                       Tournament.

COACH RESIGNS
AT SEASON END
134
  The resignation of head
basketball coach Tim Grgurich was
a surprising end to the 1979-80
campaign. The Panthers had
finished 16-10 in regular season
play, but a loss in the Eastern Eight
semi-finals to eventual champion
Villanova had seemed to be the
end. But the National Invitation
Tournament (NIT) extended a bid to
Pitt which matched up the Panthers
and Duquesne in the first round at
the Civic Arena.
  Pitt and Duquesne had split their
Eastern Eight meetings, with the
Panthers coming from behind in
the final two minutes to win 55-53,
and the Dukes winning a 67-66
contest less than one month later.
  The NIT game was typically PittDuquesne: sloppy, reckless, and of
course down-to-the-wire. Duquesne
again prevailed on its home court,
winning 65-63.
  The next day, Grgurich quietly
announced his resignation,
explaining that he wanted more
time with his family and that he felt
he had done all he ever could for
the Pitt basketball program. Pitt's
record of 17-12 brought Grgurich's
lifetime coaching record to 69-70.
He had been head coach at Pitt for
five years, and had spent 10 as a
Panther player and assistant coach.
  Pitt ran up a 9-2 record shortly
after the New Year. Perhaps most
impressive of its wins during the
season were homecourt victories
over lona, Villanova, and George
Washington. The Panthers then
faced GW in the opening round of
the Eastern Eight and came away
with yet another win over the
Colonials.
  Junior Sam Clancy moved into
first place on the Pitt all-time
rebounding lists, while attaining
second place in the scoring
category. Senior Sammie Ellis also
made his way onto the all-time
scoring list, despite having played
at Pitt for just two seasons.
  Roy Chipman, former head coach
at Lafayette, will take over at Pitt
next season, it was announced on
March 28, 1980.

BEST SEASON EVER
     With the help of two outstanding
           freshmen, the Pantherette
         basketball team had its most
         impressive season ever and
         finished with a 21-11 record.
       Rookies Pam Miklasevich and
   Penny Welsh helped Pitt overcome
     the loss to injury of regular Carol
     Dugan and promising freshman
   Lynn Love, by scoring 18 and 14.5
        points per fame, respectively.
      After losing the season opener,
      the Pantherettes won their next
      eight games, including their own
   Pitt Invitational. By New Year's, the
   team was ranked in the college top
     twenty. This kind of record made
         Pitt a sure participant at the
         Eastern AIAW tournament.
      Although the Pantherettes had
    defeated Penn State earlier in the
         season, the Lady Lions had
       soundly beaten Pitt by twenty
  points two months later. The teams'
    third matchup was in the opening
      round of the tournament; again
      PSU prevailed, this time 89-61.

         PLACE
    FINISHERS
    The Panther swim team repeated
    "its 23rd-place team showing at the
    NCAA championships, held at
    Harvard in March.
      Leading the way for Pitt was 200    meter backstroke specialist Stu
    Swanson, who achieved all    America status with a 12th-place
    NCAA finish. Also competing for
    the Panthers at Harvard were Rick
    Carter (50-and 100-meter freestyle),
    Sandy Pigeon (200-meter
    breaststroke), Scott Winkler (three    meter diving), and the 400-meter
    freestyle relay of Carter, Jerry
    Zaleski, Tom McGinley and Scott
    Shearer.
      Pitt owned the nation's longest
    dual-meet win streak at 28 before
    losing 60-53 to West Virginia in
    Morgantown. The Panthers later
    returned to WVU to avenge that
    loss, and blew past the host
    Mountaineers by 43 points at the
    Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming
    and Diving Championships.
      Coach Fred Lewis' team
    completed the season with an 8-1
    record which included wins over
    solid teams such as Ohio State,
    North Carolina and Cincinnati.

ac
cted General Manager of WPGH, Pittsburgh Council voted YES on
cable TV, the draft registration controversy stirred sentiments, and
Americans were held hostage in Iran days 58-88.
FEBRUARY 1980 - As most were settling in for the winter days,
studying, and mid-term exams, many items were still unsettled. The
draft, both military and dormitory, had Pitt Students all upset. The new
visitation policy met with stern opposition from the students. Many
claimed the policies unfair and RSA hired a lawyer to defend the
students. Results a lesser policy will be tried this fall - winter 198081. The new Wendy's - Baskin Robbins opened for our food
consumption, Night Times closed down, budgets through SGB
allocations began, and Americans were held hostage in Iran days 89118.
MARCH 1980 - The month was host to two major celebrations on
campus. The Greeks held their week on March 14-22. The Engineers,
saluting Pittsburgh's Industry, held their annual madness on March 2429. The same issues were still floating around campus. There was
more talk on the draft, housing on campus, tuition hikes, registration
for Fall 1981, Student Medias were fired up over a new constitution,
politicians were campaigning for the U.S. Presidency, and Americans
were held hostage in Iran days 121-149.
APRIL 1980 - As the term and year for most was coming to an end,
those wonderful final examinations were once again here. For some
undergraduates, this was it. Graduation 1980 sent its largest
Engineering class ever along with many other well educated, jobseeking individuals out into the world to seek their fortunes &amp; dreams.
At this time we wish we could say that all those issues facing us have
been resolved..........................................................

     ANOTHER
           GOOD
           YEAR
       Led by sophomore Amy Jackson,
     the Pantherette swimmers placed
     24th out of 78 teams at the AIAW
     championships in Las Vegas.
     Although Pitt's record was 6-4,
     the Pantherettes suffered close
     losses to Penn State and Michigan.
     The swimmers then placed fourth
     at their own Pitt Invitational and
     were runners-up to Princeton at the
     Eastern championships.
       Lack of depth really kept the
     Pantherettes from successfully
     defending their EAIAW crown. Said
     assistant coach Kate Mathison:
     "We had a shot at first place and
     went after it as best we could, but
     just didn't have enough."
7     At nationals, Jackson earned all    America status by finishing in the
    top 15 in the 50-, 100-, and 200    meter butterfly, the 100-and 200    meter freestyle; Pitt's 400-freestyle
    relay of Jackson, Nancy Henry,
    Julie Terrell and Suzanne Pulley
    was 15th.

UP'N DOWN
           SEASON
         Lousy weather was the Panther
       baseball team's greatest foe in the
       spring of 1980. Fifteen games were
         rained out, causing what coach
       Bobby Lewis described as "an up
                    and down season."
        "Baseball is one sport where the
      more you play, the more consistent
          your execution becomes," said
          Lewis. "With all the rainouts, we
          could never even have a regular
                     pitching rotation."
           As of early May, the Panthers
       had compiled a 12-11 record. This
         record, however, was not a true
         indication of the team's success.
         The Panthers travelled to Florida
         for a season-opening tournament
         and returned with a 1-6 record.
         Against Eastern teams, however,
      Pitt then picked up 11 wins and five
                               losses.
               Lewis cited the Panthers'
         pitching and defense as strong         points, although Pitt had trouble
              generating offense. "Alan
        Lachowicz and Donnie Koller are
        tough athletes, and Mike Luciow
          was a pleasant surprise," said
                  Lewis of his pitchers.
                Pitt loses five seniors to
              graduation: Koller, second
        baseman Duane Sachianich, first
            baseman Charles Messiano,
          centerfielder Mark Stevens and
     pitcher Mark Biano. "I think we'll be
         all right next year and we'll also
         hope for some better weather,"
                           said Lewis.

      Women's collegiate tennis is
   divided into two seasons: one in
   the fall and another in the spring.
   The Pantherettes finished the first
            half with a 3-7 record.
    Pitt's wins were against Indiana.....
University of Pennsylvania, Slippery
Rock State College, and Morehead  c      \
    State, while losses included the
    Penn State, Maryland, and West                         i'
               Virginia matches.
     Under first-year coach Louise
     Rick, the Pantherettes' greatest ....
 achievement during the fall season               "YN
 was probably the fine doubles play 
        of junior Randi Belkin and
     freshman Kathy Jacobs. Pitt's  "N' N
     number one-and two-ranked           4,
   players, respectively, Belkin and
Jacobs placed third in the Salisbury,
               State Invitational.
       During the winter, the team
       practiced at the Monroeville
         Racquet Club. Individual
     participation in college tennis
     tournaments took place in the
                        spring.

but they haven't. We can not say all graduates are employed, that
inflation is coming down, the recession is over, the President has
been elected, the Student Medias differences with the Media Board
Constitution have been resolved, WPGH goes FM, the draft
registration isn't needed, tuition won't go up, the Pirates, Steelers,
and Panthers are champions again, and the hostages in Iran have
been safely returned. Who knows... maybe the 1981 edition of the
OWL can say... these things are reality... maybe we are just
reading into our CRYSTAL BALL!

"Oh, Cindy! It's my first mixer and I'm kinda scared
but excited. I don't know what to expect. You've
heard all those rumors about fraternity guys and I
know you've seen Animal House", said Ann.
Cindy replied, "Really Ann, don't be silly, mixers
aren't anything like Animal House and frat. guys are
really nice. I should know since I'm dating one."
Around 9:45 PM, Cindy and Ann step onto the porch
of the  _   house. Ann looks pale and tense but
as the door opens and she's greeted by Steve, a guy
in her English Lit. class, she starts to relax. This
place is wall to wall people and the windows vibrate
with the sounds of rock n' roll, disco, and new wave.
Several people are punking off to the right and a cold
glass of Stroh's is thrust into her hand. As she takes
in the things around her, she realizes how silly she
was to be nervous when everyone is laughing and
having such a great time. Her confidence restores,
she wanders into the room on the right where she's
lost in the world of dancing, music, and happy
people.

Greek Sing
  Long, hard practices, professional songs, elegant costumes, and
enthusiastic Greeks created a night of enjoyment and excitement.
Although all of the fraternities and sororities didn't have their talents
represented in Greek sing, those that did performed both gracefully
and energetically. The songs that echoed off the walls of Carnegie
Music Hall on the evening of March 8, 1980, included You've Gotta
Have Heart, Piano Man, I Want a Girl, My Favorite Things, One Voice,
Picasso's Last Words, Heart of my Heart, Will I Ever Tell You, Don't
Rain On My Parade, as well as many, many more. Placing third for
their performances were Delta Delta Delta sorority singing I Want To
be Happy, The Boyfriend, and Hey There Good Times, and Delta
Sigma Chi fraternity singing ChickenNecks. Some memorable songs
sung by the second place finishers were Chattanooga Choo-Choo,
Cheek to Cheek, and Fascinating Rhythms performed by Delta Zeta
sorority and The Lees of Old Virginia done by Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity. Dynamic performances were given by all. The winners,
especially those placing first, were Chi Omega sorority singing Blind
Date, By the Beautiful Sea, and Happy Endings and the two fraternities that tied were Phi Gamma Delta performing Baby Face, and I
love My Baby - My Baby Loves Me and Delta Phi singing Standing
on the Corner and On the Sunny Side of the Street.

              FORMAL
  Weeks of canning at street corners
and intersections in the cold and rain to
collect for the Western Pennsylvania
Heart Association, Inc. had ended. Now
the time for celebration had arrived and
the Greeks took dates to the FORMAL. It
was a great time for all, but it was also a
night for all of the hard work to be
rewarded. Trophies were presented to
the winners. To all those healthy eaters
who survived Klondike eating contest
were given trophies. The winning sororities were Sigma Sigma Sigma in first
place and Alpha Delta Pi, Theta Pi Alpha, and Chi Omega in a three way
second place tie. For the fraternities,
Delta Sigma Phi took first place while
Kappa Sigma and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
tied for second. Other trophies that were
awarded were for Charity and the first
place winners were Alpha Delta Pi sorority who collected $3000 and Delta Sigma
Chi fraternity who raised $12,000. Philip
Marcischak who raised $1000 was
presented the Heart Trophy for collecting the most money. Finally, seven
groups were presented with a trophy for
Outstanding Participation. The groups
that received 40 points or more during
Greek Week were Alpha Delta Pi, Chi
Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Sigma
Chi Delta Zeta, Phi Gamma Delta &amp; Zeta
Beta Tau.

          Dance Marathon
As you entered the Student Union Ballroom
on the week end of March 15th and scanned
the room, you viewed dancers, dancers
everywhere. The occasion was the annual
Greek Week Dance Marathon which showed
that Greeks do more than party on week
ends. Twenty-seven couples donated their
time to dance and raise money for the Western Pennsylvania Heart Association, Inc, of
the twenty-seven entered, only three dropped
out before the grueling 24 hours had ended.
From those that finished Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity was victorious raising $1700. Second place went to Alpha Delta Pi and third
place was awarded to Delta Zeta. These
healthy, dedicated dancers weathered blisters, thirst, and overall exhaustion in order to
make their mark in the battle against heart
disease. Congratulations to these brave
people on their success and we'll be looking
for an even greater showing next year!
Thanks should also go to KDKA and 96KX for
their coverage of the marathon and to all
those who in anyway gave their support.
During the dance marathon, there was also
the banner contest. Contents of the banners
included Stroh's, the sponsor of Greek Week,
Western Pennsylvania Heart Association, Inc.
and the names of the fraternities and sororities that worked on that specific banner. The
group that created the most original banner
was to be awarded a trophy signifying them
victory. Winning was Chi Omega, Phi Gamma
Delta, and Triangle and in second place was
Delta Zeta, Delta Sigma Chi, and Zeta Beta
Tau.

                                           The Day for Games
                                         On March 19, the Greeks came
                                       out to play their favorite games.
                                       Actually the games may not be the
                                       Greek favorites, but what can you
                                       do in the Student Union Rec.
                                       Room? It was the annual Games
                                       People Play competition. Some of
                                       the games included were Chinese
                                       checkers, Simon, computer foot                                       ball, pinochle, backgammon and
                                       ping pong. Each fraternity or soror                                       ity provided the people to compete,
                                       hoping to win awards in the games
                                       areas. The competitors held their
                                       concentration to their respective
                                       games despite the surrounding
                                       noise. In the end, some felt the
                                       thrill of victory, and others, the
                                       agony of defeat.

"How did they talk me into this??????"
And now I BIND you Man and Delta Zeta...
  Later the same day was Fun and Games. Each matched
group competed against the clock to overcome the obstacles
of the planned course. The obstacles included: 1) the
construction of a semi-stable ten person pyramid able to
withstand its own weight; 2) successful basketball bouncing
by two people stacked; 3) Greeks experimenting with exotic
banana eating; 4) childhood tricycle riding; 5) "accurate"
egg tossing; 6) the three legged race; and 7) the whipped
cream, nose to dime push. The wacky athletes capturing first
place were Chi Omega, Phi Gamma Delta, and the Triangles.
Sliding into second place was Kappa Delta, Pi Lambda Phi,
Phi Kappa Theta, and Alpha Epsilon Phi. Pulling out a third
place title was Sigma Chi, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Delta Phi.

  IRON CITY HOUSEROCKERS
  A sell out crowd packed into the Student
  Union Ballroom on the night of March 19,
  1980. Why? The attraction was the Iron
  City Houserrockers, presenting a concert
  exhilating fans with a variety of special
effects and great blues-based rock n' roll.
The band started as Brick Alley early in
1977. Changing their name to the Iron City
Houserockers in October of the same year,
they let everyone know they were from
Pittsburgh and their music is definitely a
credit to our city. Pittsburgh had steel, Iron
City Beer, the Steelers, and the Pirates.
Well, now a new name can be added to the
city's list of fame. It's the Iron City Houserockers!
         Fraternity Tasting
Delta Phi Epsilon was the sponsor of the
second annual Fraternity Tasting which
was to raise money for Greek Week.
Fraternities met in the Venetian Room to
sell their kisses for one dime. The kisses
were rated 5 for excellent, 4 for very good,
3 for average, 2 for fair, 1 for poor, and 0
for worthless. Winning the position as the
most KISSable fraternity for the second
year in a row was Phi Kappa Theta. Delta
Sigma Phi's incredible kisses won them a
second place trophy and Kappa Sigma
won third place but their KISSES still rank
among the BEST! Refreshments were provided in between kisses to keep the lips
moist and music played to provide the kissing mood.

Personality Reigns
Each fraternity and sorority had their own way of raising
money for the Greek Week charity. Fund raisers varied
from bake sales to walkathons to charity mixers. One of
the more entertaining of these events was the Mr.
Fraternity Contest sponsored by Theta Phi Alpha
Sorority. Each candidate was judged in three major
areas that included; cut-offs or shorts exhibition, three
piece suit formal show, and the question/answer
portion. Contestants ranged from the typical muscle
men to those men who were all personality. Character
was shown in many ways during the question/answer
section. When asked what he would invent, one
contestant replied, "A room for kinky sex." Another
contestant, when asked who he would like to be, replied
that he would like to be a meteorologist like Pat
Shingleton. One contestant was heard to say that he
preferred to win with his personality instead of muscles.
Surprise! Mr. Fraternity wasn't just for muscle-builders
because Philip Marcischak, sponsored by Delta Sigma
Chi, took a first place with his comedy act. Mitch Haber,
sponsored by Kappa Kappa Gamma received second
place, and Greg Davis of Sigma Chi stole third. The
winners were chosen by a distinguished panel of judges
that included Carol Hall from WTAE-TV, Gary Grant,
editor of Portfolio Magazine, Pat Shingleton of WIIC-TV,
and Patti Adair, overall co-chairman of Greek Week.
Heading up the program was Trish Beatty of KDKA
radio.
The audience, Pat Shingleton arrows in hand, cheered
wildly for Mr. Fraternity 1980. Who will win next year?

  We would like to extend our appreciation to
those who make Greek Week a huge success this
year. Thanks to the Greeks, Stroh's and their

  The activities of Homecoming 1979 accentuated
the theme, "here's to Pitt... I Love You Pittsburgh." Kicking off the week was the traditional
Leadership Dinner which notes outstanding community and university members. Among those recognized were Pitt organizational presidents, Bill
Hillgrove - WTAE Sportscaster and "Voice of the
Panthers", and Savina S. Skewis, the notable former Dean of Women and Consultant to the Secretary of the University.
  On Monday, all students were encouraged to
come out and place their ballots for the King and
Queen of their choice. To entice voters, Stroh's
and the Homecoming committee created the incredible "Horrible Hankie" which was to lead Pitt
to its many victories.
  Among Homecoming events, Tuesday previewed
the showing of "Leave it to Jane." That same day
some students raised the spirits for Homecoming
by drinking some of the "SPIRITS" offered to all
Panthers wearing their Pitt T-shirts as they enjoyed
OAKLAND NIGHT AT THE BARS. For those unfortunates who were "underage", Wednesday night
was for them as they enjoyed the 1st Annual
CARNIVAL in the QUAD, which was to rid them of
their mid-week doldrum by getting them out of
their rooms for some games, music, and just out19

HAND
... The Hand-in-Hand Festival is in its
second year at Pitt, and is one of the
few of its kind in Western Pennsylvania. This festival provides a day of
recreation and enjoyment for emotionally, physically and mentally handicapped children. About 400 children
came to the event from the area's
institutions, The Home for Crippled
Children, Easter Seals and individual
children brought by their parents.
  March 29, 1980 may have been a
gray, rainy day outside but in Forbes
Quadrangle, it was hard to tell. Children's laughter echoed through the
halls as they tried the various booths
which were run by student groups,
fraternities and sororities. Groups involved included Lambda Sigma, the
schools of Pharmacy and Physical
Therapy and even a large commuter
group. Some games included rolling
ping-pong balls over glasses filled
with water and a gold fish, the Pitt
Campus Police set up a firing range
complete with guns - water pistols
aimed at putting a candle out. Entertainment came from magicians, the
Women's Choral Ensemble and the
Pitt Band.

... Much work, preparation and co-operation was required
to make the Festival the success it was. This was an effort
of 800 Pitt student volunteers. Half of these volunteers
Worked "one-on-one" with the exceptional child. Their
responsibility was to remain with the child for the day.
These students had to attend orientation sessions to familiarize themselves with this type of child. The Chairperson
for the Volunteers was Mary Beth Deering, the Coordinator
was Harry Kuhn. Both praised the cooperation they received from RSA and local businesses as well as those on
the Hand-In-Hand Council. All in all, it was a fine day and it
was hard to tell who had the most fun, the students or the
children.

Student Union and the Towers and the
Quad. At the end of this year WPGH
became, through approval by the
FCC,an FM station. This will allow WPGH
to go community-oriented because now
WPGH will reach throughout the area of
Allegheny County.
  This year WPGH held a "Celebrate
Nothing Day", setting up their radio in
the lower lounge of the Student Union
and broadcasting. They gave out many
prizes given by the local Oakland merchants. Also through advertising, the
station tried to draw the Student's attention to them. Also this year, WPGH
broadcasted some of the sold out Pitt
Basketball games.

You want to put basketball into what pages???
... The Yearbook Staff decided to let Pitt know that a year
book does indeed exist. During the Homecoming Carnival, the
staff set up a booth and had "Shoot Your Own." Then came
senior pictures and a Christmas mail out letter. In January, the
staff and photographers got busy working on the'80 book -..  *
actually much occurs during the second term Greek Week,
Engineer's Week, Hand-in-Hand, Graduation and much more.
We decided to get into the act. Armed with our slogan "End
your year with a Bang!!" we launched the First Yearbook Week
which was April 7 to 11. Complete with T-shirts for the staff and
selling booths in the Student Union, Cathedral of Learning and
the Towers, we really pushed these 1980 yearbooks.

right fun. One of the festivities of the carnival anticipated by all those present was
the announcement of the 1979 Homecoming King and Queen and their court.
The King and Queen were Bruce Gebhardt and Penny Campbell and their court
included Thomas Kunkel, Sandy Moran, Larry Newell, Michael Nuzzo, Suzanne
Pulley, Jim Scalon, and Mary Alyce Solomon, and Ellen Weist.
  I LOVE A PARADE! Floats, bands, Greeks, and the WFFM Bird - was this the
Rose Bowl Parade? NO! It was the 1979 Pitt Homecoming Parade, and it was
unlike any other in the past. Enthusiastic fans came out to view inventive
costumes, floats plus the dazzling brass sounds led by our own Pitt Band, which
led to the world of cheers, merriment, and fireworks of the Bonfire and Pep Rally.
Anyone who was there couldn't help but feel the excitement that vibrated
throughout the crowd as everyone got psyched for Pitt's confrontation with
Cincinnati.
  Now we come to the climax of a wekk of fun and expectation as the long
awaited crowning of the King and Queen takes place. Fulfilled are the dreams of
those who put their time and energy into producing a successful Homecoming,
that provided pleasure for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as those
alumni who returned for the game. The gaiety came to a close for those of us
                                            who had just come to watch but
                                            we all took memories with us and
                                            the hope that next year's Home                                            coming week would offer many
                                            more memories.
                                            I was really excited. I thought I
                                            was going to faint. Penny Camp                                            bell, QUEEN
                                            It was something to do just for
                                            the fun of it. Bruce Gebhardt,
                                            KING
                                                     by
                                            Chris Fedenko &amp; Sharon Schiffer

            Dear Friends,
              Howdy buddies. Hope this letter finds you in good health and good spirits. Well,
            can you believe it? Yes, after 10 months of working, Rita and her staff have
            completed the 1980 Edition of the long-running best seller, the OWL... what
            else?! Believe me there were days when I thought these ends would be impos            sible. Many days I recall those little scenes in the offices when I was sure
            someone other than myself was going to fly. But I guess sometimes miracles do
            happen.... make a believer of me...
              I guess Rita should be thankful she had some wonderful people that helped
            make that book a reality. Thanks to George Stewart and C.T. Miller, the Herff            Jones Representatives that were able to get deadlines pushed back. And honest            ly, where would Rita have been if Abe Orlick, Lois, Russ, etc. at Davor Photo Inc.
            didn't intervene sometimes. Hey these folks did some great photography work on
            the Seniors and through the book in general. Then it is no secret that this book
            wouldn't have gotten off the ground had it not been for Larry Lunsford, the
            OWL's advisor. He was behind the scenes all the way nagging and suggesting
            things to the staff to help them along their way.
              Now I ask you, what would Rita have done without that wounderful staff?
            What's a yearbook without pictures? And how else to get pictures taken than by
            photographers? I guess Sandy, Bonita, Ken, Anthony, Lois, and especially GOR            DON deserve more than a round of applause. No one could have done more than
            Carla, Anne Marie, Jean, Sharon, Diane P., Lori, Michelle, Diane S., Amy. Debbie,
            Chris, and Helenae did. In my personal opinion Rita would have been a dead
            BIRD had it not been for Melinda, Rhona, and Bill. I mean words just can't
            express the gratitude that Rita must feel having these wonderful people working
            for her. And how about those individuals such as Sam, Maria, Joyce Aschenbren            ner, Vince Dinardo, and Penny without whose contributions certain special
            features would not have been possible.
              Golly gee Rita was a pretty lucky chick to have had so many wonderful people
            associated with the 1980 OWL. But she had one other thing going for her!!!
            Where else in the world could you find a better bunch of clowns to work with
            than the students at Pitt? They deserve the largest thanks because without them
.. there is no yearbook...
            Well, I guess it is good to finally have the book finished! It took everyone a lot
            of time but I think you'll agree it was worth it. I know I enjoyed working with the
    S       staff of 1980. I am sure if Rita were here she'd want to say CONGRATULATIONS
           to those Seniors, like herself, that finally graduated. And to all you undergrads...
           best wishes and study hard! I am really sure if she could, Rita would wish the
           1981 OWL staff only the best. And may their trials and tribulations be few and
           small!!! If Rita was here she'd also want to thank all of you that purchased a 1980
 *         OWL. May you get many hours of pleasure from your yearbook. And since Rita is
           the pen behind my voice, she says all these things from her heart!!!!!
 *         I better be flying!! Take care and be good!
                   Love ya all,
                     the OWL

... Inside a Dolls House... What
  comes to mind when you think of
  dorm life: Slumber parties, water
  battles, communal all-nighters, a
  night on the floor of a friends room
  down the hall because your room  mates boyfriend flew in from Austin
  Univ. for the weekend, gaining 10
  lbs. a year on cafeteria food? As a
  resident of the University of Pitts  burgh dormitories for the past 4
  years I feel qualified to say it entails
  all of the above and much more.
  Picture this: Dawn. The sun rises
  above the smog and skyline of
  Oakland as the day of our typical
  dormie is about to begin. At 8:30
  the alarm rings, she rises and
  heads for the shower. Too late, 6 or
  7 early risers had the same idea.
  Clutching their buckets   full of
  shampoos, conditioners, person  alized soap etc, they stand patiently
  in an ordered line, a perfect ex  ample of well-behaved young adul  thood in America. By 9 she hits the
  shower, giving up a last flickering
  hope of hitting the cafeteria for
  breakfast before her 10:00 o'clock
class. 10 minutes later, she returns
to her cubicle all pink and squeeky
clean, the picture of health. Ah,
youth! By this time her roommate is
up, and they partake in early morning banter consisting of snatches
of stories about events of the previous evening. Their vocabulary
manages to make even the most
dismal of stories exciting. I think its
called exaggeration.
... It's 9:30  and  curlers are flying,
liquid make-up is flowing, blow
dryers are humming as our co-eds
prepare for their busy day. Our dormie is by now dressed and lights a
cigarette  filling the room   with
smoke it's a habit she picked up
from her roommate while they were
cramming for mid-terms. The
smoke settles in front of the Hang
in there Baby! poster above the
  Continued on pg. 40
39
stereo, tuned into 97FM. Linda
Rondstadt is wailing as our dormie
picks up her books and heads for
the door, checking to make sure
her ID keys are in her purse. 15
minutes later, she settles in L9
Clapp for another thrilling hour of
Developmental psyche. The professor rambles on about Piaget's theory but our dormie is thinking about
cute Rick, the Pika she promised to
meet at the Keg that night at 11:00.
Rick often made Psyche bearable.
From L9 she heads to David Lawrence 121 for Prof. Melia's Rhetoric
in a Free Society. There, she sits
with a group of friends, trading
quips under the pretense of taking
notes. She doesn't let the lecture
divert her train of thought, and for
the next hour lets creativity run
rampant in her spiral Univ. of Pgh
notebook. At finals time she will
wonder why she never got much
from her notes.
... 12:00  o'clock...  lunchtime!
She gleefully skips to the Towers
checking her mail and meeting the
GANG for lunch. They discuss the
possibilities of much debauchery
and beer drinking on Monte Carlo
night during the forth coming
weekend. Our dormie sat with a
Mona Lisa smile on her face, her
roommate was flying to Austin for
the weekend and Rick had promised to come over.
... Goodness its one o'clock! Remains of grilled cheese sandwiches, bowls of Chili, salads potato chips, brownies etc. are deposited and students scurry like
ants in all directions to classes. Our
dormie arrives breathlessly at the
Cathedral, charging the steps two
at a time until she makes the second floor. In room 213, she settles
down for an hour of Romance
class, nibbles her pen, and wonders whether or not Heathcliff resembles Rick. They are discussing
Wuthering Heights.
... At two she walks back to the
dorm, done for the day. She sits on
her bed and settles down for an
afternoon of watching the soaps. At
3 she is joined by her roommate,
and a few girls straddle in from
down the hall. A conversation soon
follows and the girls give their opinions on the relevant topic of which
fraternity offers the best parties.
Our dormie is biased, she prefers
Pika.
... At 5:00 they head en masse to
the cafeteria for dinner, picking up
some stragglers on the way, and
charge their table. Two hours later,
as they linger over coffee and complain about the amount of work
they had to do, the spell of the
cafeteria wears off and they head
back to the dorms.
... DUSK has settled, and the
lights of the dorms and Forbes Avenue combine to enhance the excitement of the forthcoming evening and night life Oakland promises. The co-eds agree that Peter's,
the Keg, and Zelda's provide the
most fun. If you care to take a walk,
the Luna and Mitchells are a must
for die-hard Greeks.
... Once in their rooms, the stereo's blast as at least 10 stereos
play 97 FM in unison. Our dormie
tugs halfheartedly at her psych
book, then smiles. Above the music, as if on cue, someone shouts
the battle cry of the dormies: "Lets
get ROWDIE!"

A NIGHT FOR MOM
This had to be one of the best
Engineers Weeks ever, Junior MME
Clay Beringer. This year everyone
really put forth to make the celebration a success..........................
  What a large success the week
was. Besides the annual events of
Parade, Formal and Soap Box Derby, the Engineers added a new
event called Enginuity. But as every
year, each Engineer enjoyed the
week socializing, clowning, and
having fun.
  "Engineers Week is okay. It
could be better if they'd give us
more time off from class," offered
one freshman Pitt Engineer. Even
though less time is given off from
classes, most Engineers found time
'S
&amp; POP'S
to participate or watch some of the
week's events. Monday March 24th
kicked off the week with a Blood
Drive held during the day in Benedum Hall. That same evening the
Engineer's parents got their turn to
see what their son or daughter gets
for that tuition. At "Parents' Night"
the "KIDS" showed off their special
departments. They deomonstrated
the machines and so forth that
each engineer speciality utilizes.
  Tuesday saw Benedum Hall
being used once again for blood
donations. That evening the new
kid on the block was introduced. All
Engineers were treated to ENGINUITY. In this event the "students" got a chance to use all that
KNOWLEDGE learned in classes.
The Engineers turned designers,
builders, and operators as the participants tried to get their craft to
fly. Not only did all have fun but
they saw all that time in solid mechanics, physics, calculus pay off.
  Wednesday had the 5th &amp; 6th
floors of Benedum Hall transposed
from rooms for intensive learning
and research into gambling halls.
The Engineers held their annual
Games Night. Each Engineer
group set-up booths with different
games to participate in. The Industrial Engineers had their booth setup for Billiards. Dressed in their
PPG caps and carrying paint cans,
the IE's treated students a cheap
game. The Civil Engineers dawning
their "Bridge" Tee-shirts and
Isaly's hats, had their booth made
into a poker table. Not only could
you play to win but plenty of hot
dogs and beverages were available
for consumption.
  Thursday was one of the highlights of the weeks events. The engineers went On Parade. Each
group designed and built floats to
the theme "PITTSBURGH and ITS
INDUSTRY." The Industrial Engineers dawned their peacock feathers and paint caps to advertise for
the firm of Pittsburgh Plate and
Glass better known as PPG. The
Chemical Engineers decided to hit
home with a lot of college students.
The Chem E's placed themselves
inside cans, made a bar, and had a
brew on

tap on the float. What brew? No
less than Pittsburgh's best, Iron
City. The Chem E's had tee-shirts
claiming them all as beer experts
as they begged their spectators to
PUMP AN IRON!!! The Civil Engineers made all the hot on viewers
mouths water. The CE's made their
salute to the Isaly Corporation of
Pittsburgh. Dressed as Klondike
Bars, the Civils paraded in front of
their float, the largest ice cream
cone. They were accompanied by
the Isaly Polar Bear. The Electrical
Engineers dealt with their favorite
subject... no less than electricity.
The EE's placed themselves inside
C3PO costumes and paid tribute to
the Westinghouse Corporation. The
Mechanical-Aerospace  Engineers
combined forces to justly honor
one of Pittsburgh's largest industries. Me-Aes placed hard hats
on their heads and goggles on their
eyes as molten steel poured from
the vat on their float. The industry
honored? None other than United
States Steel, or U.S. Steel. The
Freshman Engineers got in on the
act. Their float had a large receiver
and a dial on it as the freshman
crop honored Ma Bell or the Bell
Telephone of Pennsylvania. Last
but not least the Metallurgical and
Materials Engineers put the mustard on the parade. Make believing
they were pickles, mustard and
ketchup bottles, the

MME's gave tribute to the Heinz
Corporation, another Pittsburgh
firm. The Civil Engineers took 1st
place for their Klondikes, the Industrial Engineers placed 2nd with
PPG and the Chemical Engineers
placed 3rd with Iron City Beer.
  Moving on to Friday saw the annual Soap Box Derby run. This year
the cars were better than ever and
WOMEN even broke into the driving
ranks. But the winner was nothing
new. Again the University of Pittsburgh at Tuitsville entry placed first
when all the racing was done. Making a good showing and placing
2nd was the Electrical Engineers
from the Oakland Campus.
  Saturday concluded the week's
events. This was a special night for
350 couples as the Syria Mosque
became the ballroom for the night.
The couples enjoyed the others
company and danced to the beats
of Nightstream at the Shamrock
Ball. This concluded the special
week set aside for Engineer enjoyment.

   Engineers Week is a time to give
   a break to those individuals from
   the books, labs, calculators, and
computers. The events are such to
   allow each separate engineering
      branch to brag about his/her
special field. The overall winners of
Engineers Week were first place to
  the Chemical Engineers, Second
  place to the Industrial Engineers,
     and coming in Third were the
        Metallurgical and Materials
    Engineers. As the week closed
    most engineers returned to the
      books with dreams of 1981's
              ENGINEER'S WEEK!

The School of Engineering
   The University of Pittsburgh
 School of Engineering was founded
 in the tradition established by
 Judge Hugh Henry Brackenridge
 and other founders of the Univer sity. The School of Engineering his torically responds to the needs of
 the community, state, and nation.
 Lemuel Stephens joined the faculty
 as the first engineering professor,
 and in 1846 the first degrees of
 "Engineer" were awarded. The
 Board of Trustees charted an indi vidual "School of Engineering" for
 Pitt in 1856. With a strong teaching
 - and research-oriented faculty,
 Pitt's School of Engineering contin ues to expand and improve.
   The objectives of the School of
 Engineering at the University of
 Pittsburgh are to educate young
 men and women for the profes sional practice of engineering, to
 cultivate the capacity for creative
 and dynamic thinking, and to fos ter a desire to contribute to the
 culture and society in which they
 Parent watches student demonstrate
 computers
live. The curricula are designed to
develop competence in engineering, engineering technology, engineering science, and physical sciences. The engineering student is
provided an opportunity to develop
an appreciation of the economic,
humanistic,.and social elements of
our culture, an understanding of
basic engineering research methodologies, and a realization of the
importance of formal graduate
study or informal continuing education.
  Students enrolled in Pitt's School
of Engineering become quite familiar with Michael L. Benedum Hall of
Engineering. This is one of the
country's most modern and best
equipped engineering buildings.
The building is named in honor of
Michael L. Benedum, a pioneer in
the oil industry. Benedum Hall contains among other things, its own
library, 528 seat auditorium, classrooms, offices, student &amp; Faculty
lounges, and subbasement laboratories. The 12 story structure
houses all departments of the
School of Engineering.
  The University of Pittsburgh's
School of Engineering strives to
prepare its young men and women
to take their places in careers demanding fundamental engineering
and thorough understanding of the
broader aspects of society. The
curricula is such to allow engineering graduates to secure jobs in industry, government, health care,
and education.
  The undergraduate engineer can
specialize in one of seven fields.
They are Chemical, Civil, Electrical,
Industrial, Mechanical, Metallurgical and Materials, and Mining
Engineering. Graduate degrees are
offered in all fields plus in Petroleum Engineering. Students may
also pursue a degree in one of the
Interdisciplinary Engineering Programs. Here degrees are offered in
Environmental Systems, Biomedical, Nuclear, and Public Works Engineering. All the programs at Pitt are
accredited by the Engineering
Council for Professional Development (ECPD), the national body
for all engineering schools.

  The future is like a corridor into which we
can see only by the light coming from
behind Edward J. Wagner.............................
  On graduation day in 1976-1979, rather
you thought about it or not, you made a
decision about your future. In a way you
read your Crystal Ball. Your decision to
further your education was determined in
part by the past and the future. Everything
you do here at Pitt is determined in this
same way. In this edition of the OWL we will
examine those events from the year past at
Pitt that will alter your Crystal Ball reading of
the future. SEPTEMBER 1979 - saw us
returning or beginning at Pitt. Either with
suitcase and boxes in hands or a new UPass, we came for our education. Other than
our arrival at Pitt, things struck us. Dormitory
students in the Towers faced new security
along with new cafeteria entrances and a
new laundry room. While the lines grew for
add/drop, the police nabbed the man
responsible for the murder of Renee Jones.
The football team opened their season
winning, and we all waited for the Fam-i-lee
to finally sweep the National League East
Pennant. As the month came to a close,
most courses gave the first tests (after the
add/drop period had ended), the Bucs took
the East, the cafeteria food was under
investigation, the Panthers were 1-1, and the
Steelers had started their charge for their 4th
Super Bowl crown.
OCTOBER 1979 - came in with the city of
Pittsburgh cheering the Fam-i-lee to a victory
over the Cincinnati Reds to take the National
League Championship. The Pirates geared
up for a World Series appearance against
Baltimore, Pitt students also geared up for
the arrival of Homecoming 1979. This years
celebration saw a new event, the Carnival,
turn the Quad into a fairground. The QUEEN,
Penny Campbell, and KING, Bruce Gebhardt,
regined over the Homecoming game, Pitt
over Cincinnati that was changed to 10 am
as not to conflict with the World Series. Then
on Wednesday October 17, 1979, as with 3
Super Bowls before the Pitt Students took to
the streets to celebrate. With the tune We
Are Family blaring from all areas, the Pirates
had come from behind to take the Series
and we had an excuse to party and be crazy
... as if we need one??? The Pope toured
the United States and residents were falling
out the windows in Lothrop Hall. The race
for the Presidency of SGB began with
scandal in the Jeff "Transcripts" Miller vs
Kim "the Information" Watterson, as the
Steelers and Panthers continued their
winning football ways.
NOVEMBER 1979 - With the World Series
over, Pitt Students settled down and
prepared for mid-term evaluations. Again the
major hot spot, hang-out was Hillman
Library, as scholars burned that midnight oil
+ some to prepare for those ever loved
examinations. As most students were
worrying about their grades, seems others
were interested also. The controversy of Jeff
Miller's transcripts making him not eligible to
run for Student Government President
continued. We ended up with two
candidates, Kim Watterson and William
Abraham. As the candidates for SGB carried
on their campaigns, the Afro-American

             Fear &amp; Loathing on the Commuter
             Trail... Richard Hamilton-Negley
             III, Peabody High Class of'79,
             stepped off the bus on 5th Ave. to
             begin his second week of classes
             at the Univ. of Pgh. Richard, whose
             friends called him Rich, had found
          the first week of classes unsettling.
             Being an undecided major, his
             class schedule reflected  his
             doubts: Calc 22, General Writ, Jazz,
             Psych 80, Geology 80. During
             Freshman Orientation the classes
             had sounded exciting. He hadn't
             however, reckoned on being a

slave to a bus schedule, or the
lonely hour and half between
classes. In high school free time
was designated as study hall, lunch
was eaten in the cafeteria, and you
knew everyone. He sighed as he
walked toward lower campus starting another day of experiencing the
lonliness that comes with freedom.
CL 324 Psych 80 his schedule said.
Translated that means Cathedral
room 324, He slung his back pack
to one side and walked 3 flights of
steps, reaching the 3rd floor with
little difficulty, and sat down in the
designated room, thankful that for
an hour he belonged to a group.
Around him, groups of people
talked about their weekend carowsing among derelicts in the bars or
Fraternity's of Oakland. One girls
ran in breathless, gasping

to her friends, "oh wow, I woke up
at 10 of 9 and I barely had time to
brush my teeth and run over from
the Towers." Rich smiled, he woke
up at 7:30, in order to make it on
time, and his weekend consisted of
mowing the lawn for his father, carting his sister and friends to a matinee, and watching The Love Boat.
... After class, he walked among
the shuffles of the emptying classroom, savoring the last moments of
feeling he belonged, before being
consumed by the lonliness he experienced between classes. Last
week he explored the designated
commuter-hangouts: Burger Chef,
and the Commons Room in the
Cathedral, Uncle Charlie's and the
rec-room in the Student Union, Hillman Library... by the end of the
week he had prowled Forbes Ave.
and its endless stream of fast food
restaurants. Each place was the
same, nameless faces, huge
crowds, and the feeling that because he was alone, he stuck out.
Agitated he thought, why hadn't he
gone away to college, like most of
his friends. No, he had to be sensible, responsible, and a mature
about it, commuting made it a lot
easier on his parents already
strained income. "You should be
glad you're getting an education,"
his mother had said when he told
her of his misgivings about school.
... His next class was at 1, it was
now 10:15 what should he do? He
had

to make a decision now, or stand in
the Cathedral lobby forever. It was
a tantalizing thought, but not a
practical one. However, he opted
for Burger Chef, picking up a Pitt
News on the way. Five minutes later, he sat down in one of the orange booths, enhanced with all the
thrills and ecstacy a 250 Bev-omatic coffee will allow. He scanned
the Pitt news, and then read the
geology he should have read over
the weekend - a suburban home
doesn't provide much peace or
solitude for the dedicated student.
He smiled at his own thoughts, living at home and going to school,
he didn't feel much like a student.
He was somewhere in between - a
missing link!
... By about 12:30, his thoughts
began to wander and he watched
the passing parade of students
walking in and out of the CHEF.
Bored, he drummed on the table
and prayed for a diversion.
... At quarter of one he packed his
back pack and headed towards DL
121. On the way, he fell in step with
a short girl struggling with a stack
of books bigger than she was. She
looked at him with a bespectacled
face and asked "Do you have any
idea where DL 121 is? I missed the
first week of classes because I just
got back from vacationing with my
parents and I'm lost." "Sure", he
answered, "I'm headed there now,
I'll walk you here. let me help you
with those books." As they headed
towards the building he asked
"Say, do you like jazz?"
