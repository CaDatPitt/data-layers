  Homecoming 1981 began on October 20 and ran through the 25th
with a crazy theme "Pitt: A Rainbow Connection." Through the week,
many exciting and various events were held. The Pittsburgh Program
Council's (PPC) cost for Homecoming 1981 was $33,000 and well accomplished after 7 1/2 months work from thirty people and chairperson
Susan Dillingham.
  Friday, the most popular event, Keg Roll/Almost Anything Goes
Competition was held on the Cathedral Lawn. Thirty-two four persons
teams competed. The Homecoming Float was held later that night with
participation from sororities, fraternities, three dorms, bands and the
fire department. Ending the long but fun-filled day was a street dance,
and a pep rally held near the student union. Cheerleaders, the band,
football players, fans and Bill Hillgrove stuck out the cold and cheered
the team on for a victory against Syracuse. Following the pep rally was a
dazzling display of fireworks to end the long day...

                             UNIV. OF PITTSBURGH YEARBOOK
To the students of the University of Pittsburgh,
This letterhead may or may not be familiar to all of you yet, but as different aspects of the University of Pittsburgh undergo
renovations and changes, we, at the PANTHER PRINTS, hope to expand right along with them. After being located in a
one room "cell" in the dungeon of the Student Union, we can go no where but up!
We would like to take this small space out of our yearbook to thank our truly dedicated staff. A staff that put up with a
tough transition, marathon meetings, and long office hours. Mary, Nancy, Larry, and Debbie, thanks for being terrific
section editors, - Pam, Ricky, Carol, Kathy, Tracy, Philip, Kathy, and Jackie - thanks for being a staff who contributed
beyond normal expectations... Our photographers, Sean, Lisa, Cliff, Peter, Doug, and Kevin, thanks for creative input by
shooting pictures of whatever, whenever, we wanted it! Val, thanks for being available all year - but especially during senior sittings week! And a special thank you to John A. who stuck beside us at all hours of the day-and night - (even when
Shawn dropped the pizza on the floor!)
Another thank you from both of us to two men who hopefully are proud of this 1982 edition, our advisor Larry Lunsord,
and our publishers representative George Stewart. The work and hours you put in were never overlooked and always
appreciated.
And finally, a particular thank you to you, our readers and supporters - for you this book was prepared with love and dedication..
                                                          Thank you all,
                                                                        Shawn Vance

DEDICATED STAFF MEMBERS
It is not Stephen Foster. It
is more his slave
with his big white smile and
his banjo on his knee.
It is knowing the tulips will
waver in the wind
and people will still come with
balloons and babies

The GEOGRAPHY CLUB is comprised of anyone in the University community interested in the wide and varied
fields of geography. As students, they try to illuminate the dark ignorance associated with geography. To reach
this end, the Club invites a variety of speakers to come into the meetings. Such speakers included this year, the
ship librarian of Semestor at Sea, a Rep. of the state Environmental Agency, a Rep. of the Pen-Ch-Wes
Castographic company, and many many more. The Geography Club tries to offer something for everyone.
Meetings are held twice monthly, with speakers at most of these. These Speakers would be of interest to very many
people in the college community. The Club also hopes to sponsor field trips.

MEN'S SWIMMING (continued)
T he Pitt Men's Swimming and
      diving team had only one-half
      the usual number of meets for
the 1981-82 season, but their five
meets pitted the Panthers against
some of the best, in Northeastern
United States. It became especially
tough in January, when after only one
seasonal meet in November, Pitt's
1981 Eastern Diving Champion,
Mike Minik, was forced to quit due to
academic problems. Diving coach Julian Krug had already lost shawn
McLane, a sure bet to give Minik
competition at Easterns, due to a knee
injury. First year diver, Rex Nordheimer became Pitt's lone diver, and
the swim team under head coach Fred
Lewis, was facing more pressure than

,r.
they have for years, as Pitt diving had
been a dominant Eastern power since
Lewis began as swim coach. This added pressure had underclassman Panthers turning in times that shocked
the East. By the time Easterns concluded, Pitt had qualified 8 swimmers
in 9 of Nationals 16 swimming
events, 6 of which were underclassmen. Pitt's two seniors, nationalist
Rick Carter and Sandy Pidgeon, finished standout careers at Pitt. Carter
was entered in five events and Pidgeon in three. No Panther gained AllAmerican status, but it was a fast National field with the fastest qualifying
times the NCAA Division I had ever
seen. It was Carter's fourth trip to
nationals and Pidgeon's third. The
loss of these two seniors and senior
butterflier and individual medley
swimmer Greg Pelton, will be big and
will give Lewis holes to be filled. Fortunately, Pitt's returning six nationalists are young and versatile. Junior
Jerry Zaleski, Pitt's powerful 200
yard and sprint freestyler, will come
back, to captain the 1982-83 squad.
Zaleski qualified in two national
events in 1982. Sophomore teammates Geoff Emore, a butterflier, and
J. D. McCrillis a sprint freestyler are
also among Pitt's largest squad of returning Eastern Nationalists. Coach
Lewis was fortunate to have three
freshmen make National qualifications... Ed Bergan, Ed LaNoue, and
Greg Murphy all qualified in more
than one event. Bergan, in just one
year had destroyed every backstroke
record Pitt ever had, as he was awarded the 1982 Eastern's Most Outstanding  Swimmer     Award. Stu
Swanson, Pitt    backstroker  who
graduated in 1981, had all his records
beaten, but not his All-American status, as Bergan developed stomach
problems in Milwalkee, at Nationals.
LaNoue was a needed addition as
Carter graduates and LaNoue is now
~f~tZ

right there to fill his spot. LaNoue is
the fastest freshman freestyler the
East saw this year. Teammate Greg
Murphy is tremendous at long distances, finishing second at Easterns in
the 20 lap event. Murphy swam in
Pitt National 800 yard freestyle relay. With good recruiting in both
swimming and diving, both Pitt
coaches look forward to another year
of dominating the East...!

The Road to
New Orleans
I LLINOIS September 5, 1981
      - In its earliest debut in recent
    history, Pitt made it eight wins
in a row, since their setback to Florida
State a year ago, and 16 straight wins
at Pitt Stadium by defeating the
Pighting illini 26-6.
  Dan Marino finished the afternoon
with 14 completions in 33 attempts
for 204 yards and two touchdowns as
he moved into third place on Pitt's
All-Time passing list and fifth place
on Pitt's All-Time offensive list. Tailback Joe McCall rambled for 71
yards on 14 carries. The Pitt defense
was led by senior linebacker Sal Sunseri with 16 tackles. The defense held
Illinois to a mere 48 yards on 33 rushing attempts.
  WEST VIRGINIA       As quarterback Dan Marino anxiously watched
from the sidelines with a sprained
shoulder, fullback Wayne DiBartola
and tailback Bryan Thomas had the
best games of their careers, to lead
the Panthers to a 17-0 victory over the
Mountaineers.
  DiBartola and Thomas ran for 103
and 99 yards respectively and the
number one-ranked Panther defense,
led by Dave Puzzuoli's eight tackles,
held West Virginia to 46 yards on the
ground and a measly 92 yards
through the air to record their first
shutout of the year. It was the first
time since 1976 that the Mountaineers failed to score.
  FLORIDA STATE Oct. 17, 1981
- On a beautiful football afternoon,
with temperatures in the high 50's,
the Panthers avenged their 1980 loss
to Florida State by extending the winning streak, the longest in the nation,
to 12, 42-14.
  Pitt rolled up 503 yards in total offense with a balanced attack, thanks
to 251 yards passing by Dan Marino,
who became Pitt's all-time leading
passer, and 252 yards rushing. Brian
Thomas chalked up 217 yards on the
ground to become the first Pitt back
since Tony Dorsett (in the 1977 Sugar Bowl) to gain over 200 yards in
one game.
  The Panther defense, for the fifth
straight time, sparkled, holding the
Seminole rushing attack to 76 yards
and intercepting quarterback Rick
Stockstill three times - one for a

A Record Year: The 1981 season has seen the
Pitt record book changed no less than 14 times,
with quarterback Dan Marino being the cause
of those changes nine times. Marino had a banner year finishing fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting. Marino set a new school record for
passing yards in a season (2,615), career attempts, completions in a season as well as in a
career, touchdown passes in a game, touchdown passes in a season, and touchdown passes
in a career... Julius Dawkins set two Pitt records of his own. Dawkins, with four touchdown receptions against Cincinnati and Army,
set the record for TD grabs in a game breaking
Ralph Still's record of three in 1979. His four
TDs tied the record for touchdowns in a game.
The junior split-end from Monessen also set a
record for touchdown receptions in a season
with 15. The Panther defense got in the record
book by holding South Carolina to - 52 yards
rushing - a new mark for lowest rushing by an
opponent. "B.T." Bryan Thomas ran for 1,003
yards on the year to make him the third back to
gain over 1,000 yards in a season. He joins the
elite company of Tony Dorsett and Elliott
Walker. In doing so, Thomas moved to 6th
place on Pitt's top single season rushing performance list.

He was, by nearly all standards, the perfect choice. He was a
man whose time had come. He for the job, and the job for him.
Thus it was that the selection of Serafino "Foge" Fazio as Pitt's
29th head football coach this past January met with the thundering approval of Pitt players, alumni, students and fans alike.
He was, to coin a phrase, the "popular choice" -- and for all the
right reasons. He had intefrity. And, he was a Pitt man through
and through.
Fazio brings to his nes position a strong Pittsburgh area and
University of Pittsburgh background. A native of Coraoplis,
PA, he was an ALL-WPIAL center and linebacker for Coraopolis High School and played both linebacker and center at Pitt
from 1957-1960. As a starting center his senior year he was
named team MVP, ALL-EAST, and honorable ALL-AMERICA and played in the North-South All-Star game and the AllAmerica Bowl. He was a fifth-round draft choice of the Boston
Patriots and played linebacker there for one year.

  A Natural High
for the Panther
1 909, George M. P. Baird made
      a suggestion that the Panter be
      adopted as the mascot of the
University of Pittsburgh. This suggestion was made on the grounds that
the Panter was the most formidable
creature once native in the Pittsburgh
region and quite a noble character in
ancient history. Probably the last
thing Baird had pictured in his mind
was John Haines.
  With blonde hair, sprarkling blue
eyes, and a smile that could warm the
coldest of hearts, John Haines is anything but formidable. This, however,
is not how he is known by the Pitt
fans.
  Sporting a furry suit of gold and
climbing three chairs high, only to
come crashing to the ground, is a
much more recognizable trait of
Haines, better known as the Pitt Panther.
  "Few people know that I'm the
Panter,: smiled Haines. It's a real surprise to them when they find out. I
like it better that way though. It's
more exciting giving people a shock."
  As a freshman at Pitt, Haines was
interested in becoming the Panter
mascot. He inquired and found out
that he'd have to try out for cheerleading first. So that spring, he went
to tryouts and won a spot on the Pitt
cheerleading squad. The following
year, he tried out for the Panther and
got the job. This is currently his second year as the mascot.
  "Cheerleading gave me the gymnastics ability I need for being the
Panther," said Haines. "It's important that you know how to flip and fall
properly. If not, you can really injure
yourself."
  Over the years, the Panther has become famous for his crazy antics.
Wrestling with the mini-tramp and
chasing his tail have become traditions. One tradition that has been
eliminated is what Haines calls "running into the goalpost."
  "It used to be real big," Haines recalls. "The students would cheer
when I ran straight at the goalpost,
banged into it and fell over. It seems
the goalpost was hetting bent and the
cost of reparing it was high. I still get
requests for it, but it's out of my
hands."
  This year Haines has brought to
the games what he hopes will be a new
tradition at Pitt. The new addition is a
blue bicycle with gold and blue circular spoked wheels.
  "I bought it this summer at a flea
market for ten dollars," he smiles. "It
needed fixing up, so I painted it and
brought it here. I hope it stays around
for awhile."
  Some of the more intrepid adventures Haines has taken on include
running in the Great Race with his
Panther suit on (he finished in 55
minutes and one second), or sliding
down the goalpost into a puddle of
muddy water. One of the biggest reactions he received was when he
jumped off the 10 meter board at a
swim meet, suit and all. He has to be
helped out of the pool because the wet
suit weighed him down.
  All this zaniness takes physical
conditioning and time. Haines practices three times a week for two hours
a day with the cheerleaders. On his
own, he practices another three to
four hours for his opening act. This is
in addition to attending classes.
Haines is a mechanical engineering
student who will graduate in April He
feels being the mascot has helped him
in preparing for the future.
  "Being the Panther has helped me
to deal with people much better," said
Haines. "You really come to understand and appreciate different personalities."
  Besides entertaining at football
games, Haines attents many other
sporting events. He can be seen at the
basketball games and is present at the
big games for all of the sports at Pitt.
  "Alot of the athletes thank me for
coming," said Haines. "So many of
the people in non-revenue sports put
out time, energy, and talent. I enjoy
being there to support them."
  Getting "up" for games is something that Haines finds easy to do.
Putting on the Panther suit is like putting on a different personality for
him.
  "I could be feeling down, but the
second I put that suit on, I get    ral high."
