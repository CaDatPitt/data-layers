We, herewith,
present an Owl
that has caused
much work, some
thought, and a
great deal of
worry.

 

COLLEGE

MILDRED ALTENBURGER, “Midge"

Pittsburgh, Pa.

South High School

If Midge lived 'mid the heathen where ladies sell
their hair for gold pieces, she would soon be living in
luxury and still have sufﬁcient to which to pin her
hat. A feminine Samson.

ARTHUR LEMON ARNOLD, “Lemon"

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Peabody High School

Pitt Panther (I) (Z); T. N. T. Club; Hi-Kockey

'Nother 0’ those boys that left school a young
thing and came back a full grown ossifier in the
army of the United States of America.

CLIFFORD E. BARBOUR, “Cliﬁ" A T A O A K

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Peabody High School

Y. M. C. A. Student Secretary (2); President (3);
General Secretary (3); Student Senate (3); Advis-
ory Board (3); Musical Clubs (1) (2); Swimming
Team (I) (2); Editor-in—chief University Hand-
bgok; President Pitkin Club (2); Vice-President

)

Cliff refuses to have his picture in the book this
time. Whether this is mere modesty or whether he
holds something against this year’s juniors, we have
not decided. As far as we are concerned, the more
the merrier, so long as they are Cliff's pictures.

JENNIE O. Coox

Pittsburgh. Pa.

Peabody High School

Pittsburgh Training School

What's in a name? And yet, true to it, she should
be a much sought after lady, independent and frank.
However. reliable and trustworthy when better
known.

HELEN COUFFER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Sewickley High School

“Women must have their rights. Too long, suffer-
ing sisters, have we allowed ourselves to be trampled
upon, etc." We can imagine we hear Helen's cam~
paign speeches, hot and heavy, and woe be unto
the man who dares to run against her. She has our
vote right away!

HELEN A. EILER K K I‘

Meadville, Pa.

Meadville High School

Helen divides her aﬂections between us and Mead-
ville. She spent at least three weeks with us at
various times this year. However, duty calls her
now and we're hoping to see her back next year.

FLORENCE ELLIOTT

Crafton, Pa.

Saltsburg High School

California State Normal
You might not know her quite so well,
But take the word of those who tell
How pleasant she makes friendship seem,
And how they hold her in esteem.

FLORENCE FASSBURG

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

We have dim memories of Florence's gigantic
struggles with the horse and parallel bars up on the
hill. Gym was the bane of her Freshman and Sopho-
more life. They say it is Jack now.

CLARENCE PIETENPOL

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Quiet and digniﬁed as well becomes an assistant
instructor. We have an idea there is a lot beneath
that calm exterior if we could only fathom it out.

EDNA SCI-{AEFER
Edgewood, Pa.
Edgewood High School
Not much to say,
Not so well known.
Have a way
That's all my own.

CHARLES WOODRUFF SCOVEL. _]R.

Pittsburgh. Pa.

Peabody High School

President Freshman Class (I); Assistant Cheer

Leader (3)

Charles Woodruﬁ. _]r., alias Chuck, alias Charlie,
made his debut in Pitt life as head foreman of the
Fresh. Robert Louis Stevenson has nothing on
Chuck's thrilling tale, "Kidnapped." or "How a
Soph Finished Dancing Out My Program at the
Fresh Dance."

N i;zet_v—six

COLLEGE

HARRY BIRD SELL

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School

Leave it to Harry Bird to chirp up, no matter
what question is put to him. Has a store—room of
knowledge unusually large and well ﬁlled.

RosETTA SNYDER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

That one so small should have a will so big! Ro-
setta is just the kind that can get what she wants
when she wants it. According to her reports, she

must want numerous A's.

SARA YOUNG, "Peg" H B <l>
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School
Ohio Wesleyan University
The gay life was too alluring for Sara. For two

years she trod the "straight and narrow" of Ohio

Wesleyan, then, flying came to us for refuge.

MEDICAL FRESHMEN

WILLIAM JACOB STuTz, "MoI'ﬁe"

New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School

University of Pittsburgh

School of Pharmacy

His nickname gives his nationality. "Moiﬁe"
can ask more questions than all the rest of the class
and one more of his good points besides liking
quizzes to ﬁnd out what he don't know is that he
has "taken most of the fellows over" in the game of
criss-cross, giving them odds of from three to one
up to twenty to one.

SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS

A. V. MCCRACKEN, "Drew"

Sewickley, Pa.

Here's a chief P. 0. who can make an “A" in
Sociology and blush besides.

EVENING SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS

ELLIS HUNT

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Dignity personiﬁed. Such wonderful poise.
If you have never had a class with Hunt do not
permit him to graduate from the school until
you have the beneﬁts of his being a class member
with you. Simultaneously it is advised that the
course in Psychology be taken at the same time and
you wyll ﬁnd that Hunt is the embodiment of all
that wonderful course will teach you.

E. F. LE0
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Long in Stature, Short in Name,
We hope he lives 'till he reaches fame.
lf he works as hard as he'd have us believe,
There's nothing on earth he won't achieve.
Leo is the boy who after nerve-racking sessions
in Cost Accounting could be seen plodding his
weary way back to his oﬂice for a midnight session
at the books. How do you get that way Leo?

EDUCATION

HENRIETTA WILSON AURTHUR

Bellevue, Pa.

Allegheny High School

Henrietta plays so naturally with the children that
she must feel perfectly at home among them.

RosE BROWN H B 11>

Swissvale, Pa.

Some people attend classes in the evenings and on
Saturdays, others attend dances and matinees. Rose
attends both without a loss to either.

JANE CURRY BRYCE
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Margaret Morrison School
She has a way of her own with the children and

is liked by all.

E. CHESTER CARTER

Northside, Pittsburgh

Carnegie Tech.

We haven’t seen much of Chester, but we have it
from a reliable source that he is an A-I instructor
in machine shop work.

DELLA ZoA COPP

Granville, Ohio.

Nichols Academy

A very interesting lady to talk to and withal
studious and faithful in the attendance of classes.

MARTHA DAVIDSON

Carrick, Pa.

Clarion State Normal School

Red hair and action go together. This maxim has
not failed in Martha's case, for we hear that she is
very fond of basketball.

EMILY ScoTT EvANs
akmont, Pa.

Central High School

lt is the rocket that stays not long, which attracts
us by its brightness. So it is with Emily, who ap-
pears but little on the campus, but is one of our
brightest.

ALMA GII.LEsI>IE

Meadville. Pa.

Pennsylvania College for Music

A shy and quiet little miss from the music depart-
ment. In spite of the dignity she assumes as beﬁt-
ting a Junior, it is not unusual for someone to ask,
"Are you a Freshman?"

RUTH GRossMAN

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Carnegie Tech.

Another one of our colleagues who has migrated
from over the way. She has taken up her abode in
the music department, but hopes to ﬁnish soon in
in order to ﬁll a teacher's position.

EMMA JANE HERRIOT

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Nice-looking, well poised, and business like. She
is an ardent advocate of woman suffrage, and with
her determination and persuasive ways has won
many supporters to the cause.

ALMA JAIvIIEsoN

Northside, Pittsburgh

Margaret Morrison School

Alma is very pleasant, but quiet and reserved. It
is nothing unusual to see Alma scanning the page of
her book absorbing all the contents, for the following
day's work.

Jot-IN KU'rscHER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Chillicothe High School

Bowling Green Business University

John possesses a great store of good. common
sense and business ability. He is especially skilled
in shorthand and other commercial subjects.

MARIE MCCAHILL

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Teachers’ Training School

Marie is a maiden most aloof. We learn, however,
that she is very intellectual and very interesting
when you know her.

HELEN MIELCKE

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Teachers’ Training School

Helen is full of wit and fun, and ‘so makes a jolly
good companion.

MARY P1ERsoL

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Oberlin College

Mary's sweet girlish manner has made her very
popular. We don't know what she will do when
she becomes a senior, for she has already pursued
all the deep courses in the catalogue.

NED RANKIN

Orbisonia, Huntingdon County

Juniata College

What can we say about you, Ned? We find our-
selves puzzled. Ned appears so seldom on the cam-
pus. and he is so busy when he does appear, that
we have had no chance to get acquainted with him.

lVIARY E. RoAcH

Pittsburgh, Pa.

We have yet to meet a sweeter and more attract-
ive person than Mary.

(MRs.) ESTHER R0313

Pittsburgh, Pa.

If we were to tell all the nice things we know
about Mrs. Robb, it would fill a page of the Owl.
As we are only allowed a limited space, unfortunately
we cannot list them here.

CAROLINE WELCH K K P

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Salido High School

Light hair, blue eyes, and a most delightful
companion.

HAzEL WELKER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

South High School

Hazel is a very industrious and conscientious
worker. The results of her earnestness come to
light in the class room, when she pours forth her
excellent ideas.

-A. _ i. ‘ _ 7

GAYNELL WRIGHT

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Peabody High School

One would never think to look at this quiet little
Miss that she is one of our brightest, but while others
are talking, she is thinking. She is a student of
whom Pitt can justly be proud.

MINES

LEON J. SCHWARTZMAN, “Swarlzie"

Nashville, Tenn.

Hume Fogg High School

For a man who has been out of school for a couple
of years, "Swartzie" certainly has come back with
a punch. His one fault is that he knows too much
for the rest of us. He must have liked the army for
he still blurts out a “YO" at roll call. A great
admirer of Mr. Bernoulli.

CHEMISTRY

BERTHA V. CoLDs'rE1N

Hartford, Conn.

Bertha has that way about her, so that even Dr.
Jenks gives in to her at times.

CHARLES _]. STILLEY

Option, Pa.

McKeesport High School

Charlie is a bear with the ladies. Altho among
those not present at the last Chem. Hop, Dr. Sil-
verman is counting on making our next one a success.

MEDICINE

EDMUND CLYDE BOOTS, Honorary B.S., “CIit"
McKeesport, Pa.
lVIcKeesport High School
Faculty-Student Council
here was a young fellow named Clyde,
Who fell down a deep well and died,
His fraternity brother, Sis, fell down another
And now they're interred side by side.
Now it seems Boot's nickname is "Clit,"
And that as a name seems to ﬁt
Tho it seems rather small for a fellow so tall
Who at hot air can sure do his bit.
Oh medicine, what crimes are committed in thy
name!

CHARLES DAvIsoN, B.S.

Toledo, Ohio.

Pittsburgh Central High School

Medical Missionary Society

Behold, the Bolshevist, who takes special delight
as reporter for Hays and Swartz. Hey, Charlie,
do you remember the day the papers blew away
and your hands froze up? Such language!

PAUL FREDERICK ECKSTEIN, B.S., “Eck" CD BII
Pittsburgh. Pa.
Peabody High School
Talk about aneurism's wearing thru bone!

"Ecky" has worn out the curbstone in front of St.
Margaret’s waiting for something to turn up~
on time.

BOYD M. LAWTHER, B.S., "Pete" 11> P 2

Vandergrift, Pa.

Grove City College

For small details Haines says Pete can't be
beaten. Pete is also one of "The Big Four" at the
between-class meetings. It'll be tough weather

when Pete's three teeth refuse to meet.

VOIGT MOONEY

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School

Last fall he thot he was big chief at the Mercy
Surgical Dispensary—as custodian of the Scissors.
Now he seems to have received his early training
at the Children's Hospital. Better stay there,
Mooney.

HOWARD SYDNEY REITER, B.S. (I) A E

McKeesport, Pa.

McKeesport High School

Reiter nearly wears himself out at Mercy Surgical
dispensary and needs a Big Ben to get him to classes
on time the next day.

JAMES EDWIN RUSH, “Sweitze" N 2 N R. O. T. N.

Pittsburgh and Boston

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, B.S. '12

New York University, C.P.H. '|4

This bird and Osler coached Dr. Libby on his
recent work of fiction. As a bacteriologist, Rush
would make a good plumber. The whole class
wishes "Sweitz" would talk louder when reciting on
Libby's 5th lecture or on "Scorbutis."

_]AcoB I. SPECTER, B.S., "Speck"

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

As a pediatrician, "Speck" advocates change of
scenery for three week's old kids. The mother
should be on the lookout for warm weather. How
about a set of picture post cards for the kid and a
periscope for the mother?

JOHN OLEN Wooos, B.S., "Slicky" A T Q N Z N

Waynesburg, Ohio.

Minerva High School

Mt. Union College

Medical Missionary Society, President

Class Vice President (2)

Behold, here is H. Slicky Woods who would like
to be first if he could, and beat Wheeler so that
Lichty would know Mt. Onion still puts forth the
goods. Now Ollie is an A. T. 0. How it helps him
we really don't know, for tho E. Dextrose Poole has
just left the school, old Kennywood Hays still holds
the show.

PHARMACY

ANTHONY C. AQUARA, "Tony"
Braddock, Pa.
Braddock High School
"Tony" belonged to one-nine~one-nine,
And then he had a hunch,
To wait for nine-teen~twenty,

And join a better bunch.

LIONEL DEV. BITTNER, "Specks"
ittsburgh. Pa.
South High School
South Hills High School
It has been customary, when a person couldn't
see,
That they invest in glasses to aid that faculty;
But Specks did suffer in another way, and so he
took a chance.
And shell-rimmed goggles he secured, his beauty
to enhance.

JOHN HENRY DAVIS, "Pap” KT‘

Wheeling, W. Va.
Point Pleasant High School

We all need an incentive, as we go through life,
So I took unto me a doctor for a wife.

She had an inspiration, and this was her will
That I be a pharmacist, and her prescriptions ﬁll.

WILLIAM FREDERICK HEIDENREICI-I, _IR., "Heidee"
Crafton, Pa.
Allegheny High School
Heidee's left our midst, you see,
Before a chance we had
To learn if his write up should be
A good one, or a bad.

ARTHUR DANIEL HOFFMAN
McKeesport, Pa.

The girls’ skirts are getting longer;
The men shorten their coats by degrees;

But Arthur got it all mixed up
And lengthened his to his knees.

CHARLES ALEXANDER KRAMER,
Lock No. 4, Pa.
Charleroi High School
Chuck says that he lives in a lock,
And much experience with locks has he;
For a girl in ——-.3-— has locked his heart,
And thrown away the key.

“Chuck" KT’

MORRIS LITMAN
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Morris had never a word to say,
He was so Very quiet;

But some one called him "cellulose"
And then he started a riot.

WALTER E. MEANS, “Shorty" (D A X
McKeesport, Pa.
McKeesport High School

Shorty is noted for his smile,
( A smile of co-ed fame;)

No difference how the studies pile,
His smile is just the same.

N im>ty—m'ne

K11’

Scorr PAISLEY, J R.
New Castle, Pa.
New Castle High School

The women looked in sympathy, and solemnly wiped
their eyes,

And breathed a prayer of thankfulness, that the
nation would soon be dry;

The men, though, took another view, and knowingly
shook their heads.

A131 ssid much better it would be, if only he were

ea .

But there in the crowd our hero stood, and silently
cursed his fate,

For in his hand he held aloft, an expectorating plate.

DAVID RASNICK, "Razz"
Pittsburgh, Pa.

A sailor suit, meant war to face,
Upon Razz found a resting place;
And instead of roaming o'er the sea,
ls safe in the College of Pharmacy

MILES FRANCIS RUPERT, "Wieners"
McKeesport, Pa.
McKeesport High School
Reporter for Pitt Weekly
Another one of our fair boys,
But I'm very sorry to say,
He knows that he’s good-looking,
And that takes the charm away.

MITCHELL SUCI-IY, “Mike"
Butler, Pa.
Butler High School
We thought we had Mike's number,
But that was our mistake;
We thought he was a quiet lad,
But "at shimmying," he's great.

Louis WEINER, "Lew"
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy
Member of the Dance Committee
Pardon, Meester President, what is that you say?
For all those invitations, am I obliged to pay?
They cost two dollars and a half, and I don't think
it's fair,
But give me two and forty—nine, and l will call
it square.

DENTISTRY

HENRY SLOAN

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

Menorah Society

A tall individual, who struts around with an
unknowing look on his face, as though he were lost.
He is merely looking for suggestions about his work.
and is a quiet observer. He works equally as hard
with his mouth as he does with his hands, and a
close observation of him in action is amusing, to
say the least.

 

WILLIAM F. SwANsoN, "Bill" A T A ‘F Q

Brookston, Pa.

Penn State College

Track Manager l9l9

Bill comes to us from Penn State, after having
taken a pre—med. course up there. He is acting in
the capacity of bothtstudent and scrub prof., doing
a little of each. A mighty ﬁne fellow, who gets
along well with everyone and is very much interested
in all activities, especially Track, of which he is
our Managergthis year.

Ross B. WITHROW, “Beans" A Z A

Irwin, Pa.

Irwin High School

East Liberty Academy

Speaking of people who never worry about any-
thing, here's a typical example. Beans believes in
working, but not to the extent that will impair his
health. His two great diversions are women and
dancing.

ABRAM HYTOWITZ, “Hyde" (11 E11

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

New Mexico Military School

As a demonstrator, we think that “Hyde" would
be a huge success, because he can always tell you
just how to do your work. Regardless of this he is
well liked by his classmates, and is always in a
humor.

NORMAN KRESGE

South Bethlehem, Pa.

South Bethlehem Central High School

University of Pennsylvania

Sort of quiet chap, especially in school, but we
are told that he is quite fond of the ladies at that.
He does not mingle enough with the crowd to get well
acquainted, but what we do know of him is very
favorable.

TRACY LowE A 2 A

Zanesville, Ohio.

Zanesville High School

Ohio State University

Tracey joined the Benedicts last summer, but
you would never suspect it. because he is the same
diligent worker that he used to be. A care-free soul
seemingly without any worries, and always ready to
lend a hand.

SAMUEL LEONARD OSTROSKY

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

"Stros" can tell you all the dope on sports.
especially basketball; being an athlete himself,
(partly Mexican). He is also a social lion, and is
a strong worker in the Y. H. M. A.

The Industrial Fellowship System, formulated by the late Dr. Robert
Kennedy Duncan in I906, and primarily placed in experimental operation at the
University of Kansas in January, 1907, was inaugurated at the University of
Pittsburgh in September, I91]. In March, |9l3, Messrs. Andrew William
Mellon and Richard Beatty Mellon, bankers of Pittsburgh, established it on a
permanent basis at that institution. Thus while the Mellon Institute of Indus-
trial Research, the home of this successful system of practical co-operation be-
tween science and industry, is an integral part of the University of Pittsburgh
and operates in close sympathetic accord with it, it possesses an endowment of
its own and in under its own management.

According to this system of research, an industrialist, a company or an
association of manufacturers having a problem or group of problems requiring
investigation, may become the donor of an Industrial Fellowship by contributing
to the Mellon Institute a definite amount of money, for a period of not less than
one year. This foundation sum must be adequate for the purchase of all neces-
sary special apparatus or other equipment as well as to furnish the annual sti-
pend of the research man or men selected to work on the particular problem, the
solution of which is of interest to the donor. The Institute houses the investi-
gatory work, furnishes it with the use of its permanent equipment, affords library
and consultative facilities, gives careful direction to the progress of the research,
and provides an atmosphere which is conducive to productive inquiry. All
results obtained during the course of the Industrial Fellowship belong exclusively
to the donor. The main object of the Institute is to supply for competent inves-
tigators every incentive and the most favorable opportunities for fruitful re-
search in the physical sciences and technology, and to make science subserve the

practical needs of industry.

MELLON INSTITUTE

The following table presents the number of Industrial Fellowships which
have been founded in the Institute from March to March of each year, 1911 to
1919; the number of Industrial Fellows (research chemists and engineers) who
have been employed thereon; and the total amounts of money contributed for
their maintenance by the Industrial Fellowship donors (industrialists and asso-
ciations of manufacturers):

Number of Number of Amounts
March to March Fellowships Fellows Contributed

1911—1912 11 24 $39,700
191241913 16 30 54,300
1913—1914 21 37 78.400
1914—1915 21 32 61,200
1915-1916 36 63 126,800
1916-1917 42 65 149,100
1917—1918 42 64 172,005
191B——1919 47 76 236,145

The total amount of money contributed by industrial ﬁrms to the Institute
for the eight years ending March 1, 1919, was $917,645. During the eight years,
the Institute itself expended over $330,000 in taking care of overhead expenses—
salaries of members of permanent staff and office force, maintenance of building,
apparatus, etc.——in connection with the operation of the Industrial Fellowships.
Besides this amount, the building and permanent equipment of the Institute,
which make it the most complete and modern experiment station in the country,
represent an investment of about $350,000.

wartime Alumni Aﬁinitirz

= — A._ NIVERSITY of Pittsburgh alumni‘ surely "did their bit" in the great
war, records showing that a total of 1608 from the graduate ranks
offered their services to the Government in the emergency and that
of this number 40 paid the supreme sacrifice. The majority of these
alumni, being trained along lines readily adaptable to specific duties
in the service, were commissioned direct from civilian life, or were sent to Ofﬁcers'
Training Camps and commissioned there. The Government authorities recog-
nized that the average college man made a good oHicer,—one who knew how to
handle men and hold their respect—and it was remarkable how they rose to the
occasion and displayed qualities of leadership, especially the younger graduates.

 

The Pitt alumni were located in all the ﬁghting centers "Over There" and
took part in many of the big drives which finally spelled defeat for the Hun.
Many distinguished themselves for bravery under fire and were awarded the
Distinguished War Cross, Croix de Guerre, and similar emblems by the Allied
governments. Graduates of the professional schools—especially medical, dental
and engineering——-were always in demand and almost all of those who enlisted
became oﬂicers.

One hundred t/117rt_y—t'wr}

 

With so many members from the graduate body in the service, the detail
work in the alumni office increased. Careful record was kept of the addresses of
the men, hundreds of personal letters were written, and a special effort was made
to get the “Pitt Weekly” to all of them, so they could be kept informed of what
was happening at the University. That the alumni appreciated this is indicated
by the many grateful letters received.

Due to the war conditions and the fact that so many of the younger alumni
were in the service, no special effort was made to add members to the Association
lists, although to date an increase of several hundred is shown over the I918
ﬁgure. The total membership is now about 2,800. The “Pitt Weekly" goes reg-
ularly to all of these and is a very important medium of publicity. The “Weekly”
surely made good during the war period and played an important part in keep-
ing up the morale of the men in the service. They all looked on the paper as "a
letter from home."

The I918 Commencement was a memorable one in many ways, with the
national crisis emphasized in all the functions. Commencement exercises in
Soldiers’ Memorial Hall were especially impressive. The annual alumni banquet
was held at the Hotel Schenley, Friday, May 31st, and was attended by the usual
enthusiastic gathering. Dr. Walther Riddle, '92, was the toastmaster and the
speakers were the Rev. Dr. Hugh Thomson Kerr, Major George C. Johnston, '96,
President William H. Crawford, and Chancellor Samuel Black McCormick.
Major Johnston, who specialized in X—Ray work with the medical department of
the army, was awarded the honorary degree of Sc.D. at the Commencement
exercises.

With many of the undergraduate leaders in the service, it was incumbent on
the alumni to work harder than ever to keep the student activities going. Much
aid and advice was given in supervising these activities. Alfred Reed Hamilton,
'94, continued as the alumni representative on the Board of Trustees, and alumni
representative on the Students’ Activities Board, Athletic Council, and the
Students’ Publication Board rendered valuable assistance. K

The Alumni headquarters are at 503-505 Commonwealth Building. They
include a suite of six rooms where the alumni and athletic affairs are handled.
These offices are looked on as the gathering place of Pitt men. Complete records
of the alumni and all Pitt activities are kept there and are at the disposal of any
one connected with the University. As the years go by, those records will prove
even more valuable.

Several of the oldest graduates of the University died during the past year,
two of them being the Rev. Dr. John R. Wightman, of the class of 1865, and
Rev. S. C. George, of the class of I858, the latter being the “oldest grad" at the
time of his death. Rev. Wightman was first secretary of the University Alumni
Association and in the alumni offices are minutes of the first meeting of that
organization, held June 27, I866. The "oldest grad" is now Rev. Dr.  H.
McCandless, ’64, who resides at Smethport, Pa. Two members of the class of
I865 are living Rev. Dr. John Gordon of Rensselaerville, N. Y., and R. Her-
berton Negley, of Pittsburgh.

During the days of the Student Army Training Corps, the hut was erected
on Thackeray Street by the Y. M. C. A. for the use of the soldiers in the Uni-
versity. This was not completed until after the student army had disbanded,
but through arrangement with the Y. M. C. A., this hut was opened on February
26th for the students of the University.

This building has already become a center for student activities; classes,
clubs, committees and various student organizations hold meetings here. Maga-
zines, games and athletic supplies are available for the men. A moving picture
machine has been installed. Social and religious meetings are arranged for and
it is the purpose of the Christian Association to help in‘ the development of Pitt
spirit and to emphasize the principles of Christianity in its service.

Herbert M. Moore, who has been engaged in student work in Ithaca, N. Y.,
and who spent the last year in France with the American Expeditionary Forces,
has become Executive Secretary of the Christian Association and took up his
work in February. The Y. M. C. A. at the University is now a branch of the

We always have the feeling that we don't know
any too much but wish we knew a lot more, when
we are in the presence of this student. If he were
only a little freer in imparting all that knowledge he
has stored up, we poor unfortunates might hope to
derive some benefit.

ATHLETICS

mar anh Athlrtira

LTHOUGH I918 was a war year,5and many problems threatened from
’ » ~ time to time to put an end to college athletics, Pitt stuck manfully to
the ship and “Kept the Home Fires Burning." With the ex-
ception of baseball, which was abolished due to lack of interest,
hardly directly chargeable to war conditions, the other major
sports—football, basketball and track—were kept going.

  

The football season of I918 was an unusual and very erratic one in many
respects, and the showing of Captain George McLaren’s varsity was all the more
praiseworthy on this account. The University was under military discipline, with
the S. A. T. C. authorities in charge, and on many occasions it looked as though
the sport could not possibly survive. Thanks to the fine co-operative spirit shown
by Major Savage and other officers connected with the S. A. T. C., who were ardent
supporters of the game and believed in it as a means of physical development, all
the obstacles were overcome, and the usual Pitt record was made. The "flu”
quarantine also proved a serious barrier and prevented the playing of several
games. It was not lifted until noon of the day W. &  was played.

All games were won, with the exception of the post season encounter with the
Cleveland Naval Reserve eleven at Cleveland. This was lost by one point, due
to failure to kick goal from touchdown. It was a most unsatisfactory game
in many ways and marred Pitt’s record of straight victories started in l9l5.

The one year residence rule was abolished for the duration of the S. A. T. C.,
and this gave material from the Freshman class that would otherwise not have
been available. The Georgia “Tech" game, played for the benefit of the War
Charities, was really the feature of the season, and Pitt not only won by a big
score, but was able to swell the funds to the extent of $25,000.

The l9l8 track team had the best season in Pitt history and competed for
the first time in the National Intercollegiate meet in Philadelphia, where a phe-
nomenal showing was made. All the big eastern schools, with the exception of
Cornell, were outdistanced, and Frank Shea capped the climax when he ran the
quarter mile in 47 3-5 seconds——within I-5 second of the intercollegiate record
held by “Ted" Meredith. In the University of Pennsylvania Relay Games,
three ﬁrst places were captured, one being the one mile college relay champion-
ship of America. The “Class A” relay was won by Pitt for the third successive
time, and first place was also secured in the mile medley relay.

The I919 basketball team had a satisfactory season, and won half its games.
The material was new and the schedule especially hard. A Freshmen team was
not maintained.

Minor sports, such as tennis, swimming and wrestling, were at a standstill,
although the swimmers competed in some local amateur‘ meets. The girls’
basketball team continued its good record.

Eh» 1913 Eleven

,  _ ' OOTBALL had a hard row to hoe in l9l8, and with war conditions
ill ,  and the "ﬂu" epidemic to contend with, five games only were
,,   played, one of them a post-season affair. ‘The usualtraining trip
   to “Camp Hamilton," Windber, Pa., was dispensed with. The on-
\,L":'jié ginal schedule called for games with Carlisle Indians, West Virginia
University, Syracuse University, University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh University,
W. 6: _I., Carnegie Tech, and Penn State. Only three of these were played and
numerous shifts had to be made in the schedule, due to the quarantine. W. & _].,
Penn, and State were defeated in their annual games, also Georgia “Tech," an
added attraction. The Southerners were a widely press—agented team, as a result
of their past brilliant record, and the agitation in l9] 7 for a game between them
and Pitt. They gave Captain McLaren's men a hard ﬁght—much harder than
the score indicates—but were forced to taste a 32-0 defeat.

  

Pitt lost the ﬁnal game to the Cleveland Naval Reserve team l0-9, it being
played at Cleveland. Poor work on the part of the officials, the failure of the Pitt
team to show true form, and the admittedly strong opposition on the part of the
Cleveland outﬁt, caused this defeat—the First for the Panthers since the W. 8: 
game of I914.

Pitt started the season minus such stars as “_]ock" Sutherland, Dale Sies.
“Cliff" Carlson, Leonard Hilty, “Foxy_" Miller, “Bill" McClelland, "Pud" Seidel,
and Fred Henry, although Hilty was unexpectedly sent back to the S. A. T. C,
from the Navy and ﬁlled in well at a tackle.

The one year residence rule was called off by all the big schools, and this
provided some ﬁne material, among them Tom Davies, the sensational halfback
from Kiski, Stein, a center from the same school, and Harman, from Peabody
High. Lou Mervis, of the l9l9 Freshman team, was available for a tackle and
played a brilliant game all year.

With McCarter and Harrington for ends, Stahl and Vance Allshouse for
guards, Hilty and Mervis for tackles, and Captain McLaren, Gougler, Easterday
and Davies in the backfield, Coach "Pop" Warner had his usual strong team.
The substitute material was also classy.

"Katy" Easterday had a wonderful year at half and closed his career in a
blaze of glory. George McLaren was a consistent ground gainer, as usual—the
same old George. Tom Davies’ work was the talk of the town, and good old
"Skip" Cougler played a brainy game at quarter. ln fact, the whole team played
like a Warner coached team should—which is all you would want to say in boost-
ingany aggregation. Walter Camp honored Davies and Hilty with positions on
his first All-American team, and Stahl and Captain McLaren on the second team.

Of the I9 men who won their varsity letter, the following are available for
l9l9: Stein, Mervis, Davies, Horner, McCracken and Harman.

Frank E. Finley, 'l9, proved an efficient manager. A captain will not be
elected until next fall.

PITT 34—W. &  0
(November 9)

For the fourth year in succession, the Panthers trimmed their old rivals
from "Little" Washington. It was the first game of the season and a big crowd
was out, including many khaki clad boys. W. &  was game, but outclassed.
The first half ended with the score 27-0, Warner’s regulars being used. In the
second half many “subs” were rushed in and only one more touchdown was tallied.
Horner started at quarterback and did well. Easterday, Cougler, Davies and
Mcl_.aren were prominent as usual in carrying the ball. The line held like a stone

wall. Aiken showed up well at end for W. & 

PITT 37—PE.NN 0
(November 16)

University of Pennsylvania was a cinch for the Panthers and made only one
first down while the Pitt boys scored at will. The first half, with the regulars in,
ended 23-0. The substitutes played well in the second half, too, and tallied twice.
Davies’ work was wonderful in the ﬁrst half. On numerous occasions the little
Freshman dodged through the entire Penn team for long runs. The crowd was
small and Penn put up a very weak resistance. Pitt tallied five touchdowns and
got one goal from ﬁeld, which Davies kicked. It was Pitt’s fourth straight vici-
tory over Penn.

PITT 32—GEORClA “TECH" 0
(November 23)

The Georgia "Tech" game was one of the most sensational ever fought on a
Pittsburgh gridiron, and was witnessed by an enormous crowd. Football experts
were present from all over the United States and the complete rout of the Heis-
man machine was the talk of the entire football world. Pitt scored five touch-
downs, three of them on forward passes, and two on sensational runs by Tom
Davies. Easterday was on the receiving end of two of the passes. Davies
grabbed the other one. The much-talked-of "Heisman shift," which had played
havoc with all rivals the “Georgia Crackers" faced, failed against Warner's well
coached team and little ground was gained with it. The Southerners were a good
team, however, and Pitt had to fight all the way to win. Davies’ open field run-
ning and Easterday's taking of forward passes were the outstanding features.

PITT 28—PENN STATE 6
(November 28)

Penn State started off with a rush in the annual Thanksgiving day game,
and threatened to make trouble for the Panthers. A poor kick, which sent the
ball out of bounds near the State goal line, gave the Mt. Nittany men a chance
to score, and they plunged through for a touchdown. From that time on, it was all
Pitt, and four touchdowns were scored by Warner’s men. Tom Davies made two
of them on long runs, and “Herb" McCracken and George McLaren were good for
the other two on line plunges. Pitt entered the game with several substitutes,
the reliable "Katy" Easterday being out on account of injuries. The field was
very muddy. State played a defensive game entirely and punted time and again
on the first down.

PITT 9——CLE\/ELAND NAVAL RESERVES V 10
(November 30)

The Panthers tasted defeat for the first time in four years in the final game
played with the Cleveland Naval Reserves at Cleveland, the Saturday after
Thanksgiving. It was a hard luck game to lose, and the outcome was far from
satisfactory to the University rooters. Coach Warner's men undoubtedly en-
tered the game in poor condition and suffering from overconfidence, the officials
were hardly of the class necessary for such an important game, and the Naval
Reserve team, which was a picked aggregation of college stars, were primed to
beat Pitt. Failure to kick a ‘goal after touchdown was scored lost the game.
The first half ended 9-3 in favor of Pitt, Gougler kicking a field goal and McLaren
going over for a touchdown. The Navy men scored a touchdown very late in
the game and kicked goal, giving them the point needed. They also scored a ﬁeld
goal in the first half.

Eaakethall, 1919

v HILE only half of the games resulted in victories, the I919 basketball
season was voted a successful one. Considering all the circum-
stances, the Panthers did remarkably well. When the season
started, only two men reported from the |9|8 varsity, they being
Penman and Levine, forwards. Penman was elected captain and
after playing two games was compelled to quit on account of physical defects.
Robinson, center of the I918 team, returned from the Navy late in the season,
but did not get much opportunity to play.

 

The team defeated Allegheny for the second time in history, broke even
with W. & _]., West Virginia and Ceneva—the last named the winner of the
Western Pennsylvania l9|8 title—ancl won two games from Carnegie “Tech.”
Two games were lost to State College, as they had an exceptional team. West
Virginia won the opening game at Pittsburgh but the Panthers came back and
trounced them on their own floor late in the season, which was a rude shock to
the Mountaineers. The other victory-was over Grove City. Of the seven games
lost, three were by a two point margin.

Coach George M. Flint had to depend entirely on first year men and ma-
terial from the l9l8 Freshman team. He did not have any tall fellows and this
was a special handicap at center. Laughran played a fine game there but hadn’t
the height to secure the ball often on the tip-off. Many of the opposing teams—
notably Penn State, W. &  and West Virginia—had big rangy centers and they
usually started all plays. ‘

A. Bremen and Levine were good forwards, Bremen tossing fouls in fine
shape. Laughran at center led the team in scoring field goals. B. Bremen and
Mervis were clever guards. The "subs" were Kelley, McCracken, McCrory,
Masley, Robinson and Daniels.

After Penman was compelled to give up the game, no captain was chosen.
Harry Levine, '20, is the I919 captain and R. K. McCurdy, ’20, the manager.
Donald W. MacFadden, ’Z0, was the I919 manager, and an exceptionally good
one. No Freshman team was maintained, but with the resumption of the one
year residence rule in the fall of I919, the Panther Yearlings will again take the
ﬂcior. dHoward R. I-laines, '20, is the Freshman Manager. A coach is yet to be

Elrark, 1913

HE I918 track season was the most notable in the history of that
‘ branch of athletics at the University and Pitt won nation—wide
recognition as a result of its showing in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet
at Philadelphia. It was the first year that an opportunity was
. - afforded to compete in this big college meet and second place was
won. Only six men composed the Pitt team and they scored 30 points, Cornell
leading with 47. All the large eastern colleges had teams entered. The men on
the Pitt team were Shea, Sutherland, Easterday, Addleman, Hugus:and Albright.
Shea outdid himself when he ran the 440 in the phenomenal time of 47 3-5
seconds, within l—5 second of the intercollegiate record held by “Ted” Meredith.

Unusual honors were also won in the University of Pennsylvania's annual
relay games at Philadelphia, and the Panthers were first in three races, one of

them the mile college championship of the United States. The University’s
twelfth annual intercollegiate and interscholastic meet was held May 18th, and
Pitt won in overwhelming style over Carnegie Tech. On May I lth, a dual meet
was won from the U. S. Naval Academy team at Annapolis, Md., by the score of
69%’ to 46% ; the Penn State relay team was defeated in the Meadowbrook Club
games March 9th, and the Allegheny Mountain Division A. A. U. indoor cham-
pionships were won March 23rd, Westinghouse Club being the nearest competi-
tor.

F.  Shea, '20, is captain of the l9l9-20 team and is a worthy leader. His
sensational quarter mile record in the lntercollegiates made him a national
athletic ﬁgure. Eastern track critics who saw this performance claimed that
had he been pressed he would have lowered Meredith's record, without a doubt.

ATHLETICS

(§irl2s’ Iﬁaakvthall, 1919

HE Girls’ basketball team has been keeping up its great record and
it is one that compares with that of a Glenn Warner coached foot-
ball team. For four years the girls have had a team and during
that time they have lost but a single game, that coming last year
,, , when they were defeated by a single point by the Pittsburgh Training
Teachers’ team. The season of I919 was gone through without a setback, nine
games in all being won. This notwithstanding the fact that three stars were lost

from l9|8——Crace Vohr, Sara Bonnet and Brenda Wright.

The forwards were Minnie Wehmeier, Mary Stokes, Sara Coldfeder and
Eleanor Parker; centers, Lula Witherow and Marie Luckenbacher; side center,
Anna Klingensmith; guards, Margaret McClenahan, Dorothy Steele, Eleanor
Steele and Laura Schafer. Laura Schafer was manager and H. H. Provin again
acted as coach.

'-“$5 URING 1914 a “Hall of Fame" was inaugurated in the Track House,

‘ 5 for the proper preservation of athletic tradition and celebration of
victory. It consists of pictures of teams and individuals who have
brought honor to the University by notable achievement in all
lines of sport, they being hung on the walls of the building. Major
sport and tennis teams which win their games, series or meets with W. &  and
Penn State, exceptional minor sport teams, athletes who win their letters in
three or more branches of athletics, track record holders, coaches, directors of
athletics, graduate managers of athletics, athletic council chairmen, and such
other individuals as have signally advanced the athletic reputation of the‘ Uni-
Eersity all find a place here. The following pictures are now hung in the Hall of

ame:

  

Football teams ofI913,1914, 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918
Basketball teams of I915, 1916 and 1917

They tell us this deep-thinking maid scores heavily
in such weighty discussions as "Do I or don’t I pos-
sess a soul?" We wonder if her soaring thoughts are
affected at all by her intense interest in f'lying—
particularly of the Canadian type?

Demure, sweet face, dimple 'n' everything! You'd

it is said she can write out checks in her sleep and
never have them come back N. S. F. at all.

Come, brothers, sing the old song again,
Our paean to Alma Mater,
We who have followed her beacon light
And marched ’neath her banner fair,
Sing of her fame in the days gone by
And the glory the years have brought Her;
Her colors we wear, Her honors we share,
Then sing till the winds reply:

Here’s to the University,
Here’s to the Cold and Blue,

Here's to Alumni and Faculty,
Here's to Her Students true,

Here’s to Her fame in years to come,
Bright shall Her laurels be,

Here's to Old Pittsburgh the glorious,
Here’s to the U. of P.

Our Old Pittsburgh, dear Old Pittsburgh
With love that never tires
Thy loyal sons in homage stand
About Thine altar ﬁres;
Though in the strife of after—life
Far from Thy shrine we be.
Our loyal hearts will ever burn
With love, dear Pitt, for Thee,
Our loyal hearts will ever burn

With love, dear Pitt, for Thee.

On the ﬁeld they go,
To face the foe,

With a spirit strong and mighty;
When the whistle blows,

They are on their toes,

To defeat their prey by ﬁghting;
While high o'er the throng,
We'll play and sing this song,
To the boys who fought to win;
Then we'll give our yell,

Over hill and dell,

You’ll hear our echoes ring,

O’er smoky Pittsburgh,

O’er the country wide, ‘

Far spread the stories of our dear old Uni’s pride;

Far spread the stories of our dear old Uni’s pride;

O'er the hills and dells, the crashing echoes answering call,
Pittsburgh victorious, the champions of all.

When the battle's won,

And the clay is done,

And they're talked of o'er the nation;
When they've beaten all,
Whether large or small,

And they fear no combination;
When they fight with might,
For old Pittsburgh’s right,
Their old Uni's love and pride,
Then we’ll let them hear

Our old Uni's cheer

We’ll shout with all our might

“Evangeline" advises us to inscribe her as a "nut
going nuttier." We don't like to disagree with any-
body. of course, on general principles. That man-
nish stride and basketball swing does not put Van
one degree in the shade of the "clinging vine" type
when it comes to popularity.

We hear James W. is out for weights this year.
We believe, as far as that goes, he ought to be
pretty good. We can vouch for his ability on the
gridiron and on the second floor of State, where his
rosy countenance beams continually upon the fair

Madeleine has had aspirations to become famous
as an orator and a writer, although you would never
guess it from her subdued manner. We imagine she
is hiding a lot of pep and life behind that masque of
retirement.

iﬁail In iﬁitt

Down in Smokytown, in Pennsylvania,
In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

We have a University we're proud of,
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

She stands a mighty fortress ’neath her colors bright,
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

When forth she goes to battle ’gainst a stubborn foe
This song will upward go:

When the grand old days of football come around,
In Pittsburgh, in Pittsburgh,

Her rooters at the field will make an awful sound,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh.

Down across the ﬁeld her mighty line moves on,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

They’ll sweep the foe before them till the goal is won
Then you'll hear them shout:

Chorus

Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! every loyal son,
Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! 'till the victory's won,
The Cold and Blue shall wave forever
On high, through fair and stormy weather,
We'll sing her praises far and wide
Until the end of time.

Hoop-hurray! Hoop Hurray for dear old Uni,

Give her a grand old Alleghenee—genac—genac,
We'll wave and cheer for many a year

And sing her songs out loud and clear,
F or our University.

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,

Child of Light and Bride of Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,

Dowered with eternal youth,

Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore,

Dear old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

Cod preserve Thee evermore!

First beyond the mountains founded,
Where the West-road opens free,
Where twin rivers forest bounded,
Merge and journey toward the sea,
In the dawning of the nation

Ere the clouds of strife had cleared,
'Rose Thy rough-hewn habitation,
By our prophet fathers reared.

Close Thy mother-love embraces

All who gather at Thy knee,

Caste and classes, creeds and races,
Mother, are as one to Thee;

Thou who unto knowledge bore us

In the good old days long gone,

Raise Thy Cold and Blue high o'er us

Lead and we will follow on.

We never were much at descriptions of beauty—
we always get the wrong verb at the right place.
We quote Shakespeare Act 4, line 39, for a vivid
portrayal of her likeness.

friends—she has them by the score.

“Hi,Herbie!" greets you across the campus and

That black eye that marred her beauty a while back

A poet would probably begin by saying that she
has a smile as sweet as the dewdrop and a blush that
comes and goes like the perfume of a sweetly scented
ﬂower upon the balmy breeze. We wouldn't dare to
go at it like that. Suﬂicient for us to say she's a
mighty sweet little girl.

Are you looking for something original? Just ask
Marjorie. She can think up anything from how you
can present a drama with extemporaneous scenery
to how you can serve tea and make people think it
is something new. She also is quite a reader and
dramatist we hear. Watch for the announcement
of the presentation of the next play she and her
“Happy" co-author have compiled. '

You can tell she's capable by the way she walks.
You can see she's friendly by her pleasant smile.
You know by the look in her eye, she has a will of
her own. You’re sure she's independent by the tilt
of her chin. Otherwise, you might not know much
about her for she doesn't rush much in getting ac-
quainted with you.

FOREST 1. BLANCHARD

Pittsburgh, Pa.

We thought that we had some very pro-
digious students in the Evening School, but
those we had in mind fade into insigniﬁcance
when this gentleman appears. There is hardly
a course in the entire curriculum that he is not
carrying, and for fear he is missing something
he has Mrs. Blanchard taking the courses he
has not time to take himself.

MARTHA ALICE BROWN

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Neither Martha nor Alice but "Martha
Alice." Prominent as a singer and distin-
guished as the first woman to become a mem-
ber of the Executive Committee of the Even-
ing School Association.

THOMAS E. HARVEY A K ‘I’

Pittsburgh, Pa.

This is a class of distinction, that is, every
member has a distinction all his own. Now
our friend Harvey has the distinction of being
the only member of the class who has a mus-
tache. That is if you can call it that. At any
rate he calls it a mustache and he is the only
one who is pleased with it.

FRANK A. HEGNER A K ‘F

"When I said l would die a bachelor, I did
not think I would live till I were married."
He comes to class once a week. studies a bit,
eats now and then, perhaps works a bit and
devotes the rest of his time to the E. S. A.
Everybody knows him and to know him is to
like him.

GEORGE A. HOLSTROM

He comes, he's seen, then what? We don't
know, do you? He takes what he is given. He
never did anything to me. We never heard
of him doing anything to you, so he must be
a pretty nice fellow. Those who know him
know he is, those who don't are unfortunate.

ISAAC KERNER

He originally intended to be a great uplifter,
took sociology and was getting the reform

hope the world will never realize its loss.

H. EARL MEEsE

"A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and one of

"Bill" has one distinction—that is—attend-

He asserts that he kept attending the classes
waiting for a class to graduate to which he
could add dignity and honor by his being a
member.

RUSSELL F. SULLIVAN A KW‘

Pittsburgh, Pa.

"Russ" is very small in stature, but in sta-
ture only. As a student he is an intellectual
giant. We wish for Harvey's sake that Sully
were as big physically, for Harvey's continual
question is, "Have you seen Sullivan?" We
hardly ever know when Sully has on a new
suit but we can always tell how long it has
been since he shaved-last.

FRED J. ROHRMAN

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Rohrman has been dividing his time the
last few winters between the Evening School

WALTER L. SEBRXNG A P <1)

"Sir" Walter "Raleigh" Sebring, gallant

never having known our "Sir Walter." He

He has the air, the personality, and with it
all, he is a very business like—unassuming true
blue sort of a good fellow.

month, 792 miles and each year, 7,l28 miles.
To cover his entire course he travelled 28,512
miles or one eighth more than the circumfer-

from Beaver Falls.

M. ROLAND ALDERMAN, “BaI7e"

Pittsburgh, Pa.

East Liberty Academy

University of Pittsburgh, Engr.

"Babe" is one of those happy—go-lucky
scouts whose only worry is that there is no
ice skating in the summer. A good mixer
who gets along with everyone.

GROEGE W. ALLISON ‘P’ Q
Pittsburgh. Pa.
Iron City College

George was not built for speed, but he gets
there just the same. Always ready for some
fun and a joke or two. We predict a successful
future for him.

CHARLES V. ALLsI-IoUsE, A.B. Druids
Versailles, Pa. (1) KW G) N E
Allegheny College
Football (2) (3)

Vance has been as successful in school as
on the football field, so we are not worrying
about his future. A father to "Red," and a
brother to the rest of us.

GEORGE RAY ALLSHOUSE, "Red" Druids
Versailles, Pa. ‘P’ Q
Tarentum High School
Football (I) (2) (3)

"Red" claims relationship to Vance. Where
there’s one, there's both. A good fellow
despite his red hair, and as hard a worker in
school as on the football ﬁeld.

JESSE A. ALTER, "Jess" A Z A ‘I>K‘F'
Bellevue, Pa.
Slippery Rock Normal
Washington and Jefferson

“_Iess" came to us from W. & Ml. We have
overlooked this because he is a good fellow.
His only fault is a weakness for women, but
we lay some of the blame for this on one

“Pi Miller.”

BEN AMDURSKY. "Jeﬂ" (I) I4] H
Pittsburgh. Pa.
Fifth Avenue High School
University of Pittsburgh, Coll.

"Jeff's" ability as an orator gained for him
the position of Senior Historian. Besides
having a smooth tongue, he swings a nasty
ankle at dancing, and is a social butterfly in
general. In spite of these faults he is a good
scout and is well liked by all.

_]osEPH E. BALDRIDGE, ‘‘Joe'' A E A

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Latrobe High School 4

Washington and Jefferson

Vice President Senior Class

Dentistry Business Manager l9l9 Owl

One of our Benedicts, who, though of a
serious nature, is conspicuous by his level-
headedness and good judgment. He is a dili-
gent workman in school and will surely suc-
ceed in practice.

LESLIE CLYDE BALDWIN, "Baldy" A Z} A

McDonald, Pa.

Clarion State Normal

Grove City College

“Baldy" is one of those fellows who does not
say a great deal, yet generally means what
he does say. A hard worker and good student,
but also a ﬁrm believer in enjoying life.

HERMAN H. BAUMAN, “jack Pickford"
Cleveland, Ohio
Who said that the Dental School wasn't

represented in the movies? He got the name ‘

somehow, but as yet we haven't quite figured
it out.

RICHARD L. BLACK, "Dick" ‘I’ Q

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Slippery Rock Normal

“ ick" does not impress you as a disturber
of the peace, but he sure can hold his own

A good student and steady worker, and one
who is bound to make good.

_]oI-IN O. BOYLE. "Buddy" ‘P’ Q.

Creensburg, Pa.

They say that this fellow intended to be

those fellows that you cannot help liking,
and is certainly a credit to the class.

“Cy" is sure some dancer and don’t care who

The man from the ﬁghting Medical Corps.

That doesn't hurt him any, though, because
he is one of the jolliest fellows in school, and
is a regular gloom chaser. In fact the only
serious thing that we can see in him is his
attention to a certain individual of the other
sex.

CLAIR M. BUNTING, "Bun!"
Bairdstown, Ohio
North Baltimore High School

Clair is the curly—haired blond from Bairds—
town. A good-natured, easy—going fellow,
who has made many friends by his conge—
niality and willingness to help others.
DONALD S. CARNAHAN, "Carney" ‘P' Q

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Sandy Lake High School

“Carney" is said to be one of the sharks of
Kenney’s. It is also rumored that his even-
ings are not always spent in studying. Because
of his ability to keep secrets, we cannot prove
him guilty, so we'll have to pass him up.
HUGH A. COCHRAN ‘I" Q

Tarentum, Pa.

Tarentum High School

This fellow missed out last year, whether
through negligence or shyness, we don't know
which. He needs watching anyhow, because
he is fond of playing little tricks, and is al-
ways up to some mischief.

GEORGE VINCENT CARTER A 2‘ A

Mahanoy City, Pa.

Mahanoy City High School

"Nick" is a name wished on him for some
unknown reason. He is not so hard as the
name sounds, in fact, quite different, being
of a gentle disposition and good scout in
general.

EARL B. CONWAY, "Connie"

Martins Ferry, Ohio.

Martins Ferry High School

Earl cannot stop working, it seems. In
fact, we think he takes life too seriously, being
very solemn. He is a good student though.
so after all, he is not so bad.
JAMES ALLEN DEWEESE, "Pinky" ‘P’ Q

Irwin, Pa.

Irwin High School

"Red" the original "Auburn Kid" doesn't
make much noise, but Oh! how the women
fall for that smile and the way he parts his
hair. Let him alone, don't muss him.

JOHN A. DALEY, "Pete"
Johnstown, Pa.
Johnstown High School
“Pete" is an all around, good—natured fellow,

" aty" is not only an all around athlete,
but holds his own in school too. Sort of
modest, but of a disposition that wins many
friends, and will no doubt be an asset in the
future. One of the Dents who helped put
Pitt on the map.

CHARLES RAY ELLIOTT, "Tough" A Z A

Evans City, Pa.

Evans City High School

Western Reserve

This fellow has a line that would make old
Mark Antony look sick, and hide his face in
shame. If success depended upon oratorical
ability, his future is made. Charley is there
in school, too, so in combining these qualities,
Eve think he has a bright outlook for the

uture.

R. J. ENGLEKA A Z A

Connellsville, Pa.

Connellsville High School

"Engle" has all kinds of nick names wished
on him, even during his senior year. A good
chap, but don’t kid him, because he don't
like it. His only fault is his acquaintance
with Chauncey.

JOHN H. EuwER ‘I’ Q (I) K 2

Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Wilkinsburg High School

Penn State

This is another fellow who took unto him-
self a wife, and as a result of this, has become
very digniﬁed, a rather unusual attitude for
a married man to assume.

“Cass" is the fellow who always has an
engagement on Wednesday nights, but we
hear that Cassie has become a ﬁrm believer

A. H. FETTERMAN

A steady, diligent fellow who never has
much to say. This is due to the fact that he

DAVID B. PITLER (I) E H

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Fifth Avenue High School

Varsity football (2) (3)

Davie has shown the same "pep" in
scholastics as on the gridiron, so we surely

expect big things of him when he steps out
in the Dental World.

LEONARD N. RAY ‘F Q

Altoona, Pa.

Altoona High School

It is still a mystery why Ray and Basil,
dressed in natty uniforms, were standing
guard at Jenkins Arcade on the eve of the
signing of the armistice.

LouIs E. ROBBINS (I) E H
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Fifth Avenue High School
He received his practise for malleting three

B's, by playing the drums so well. Always

busy, both in school, and out of school. He's

full of "pep," and is quite a hit with the
women.

HARVEY D. ROBERTS A E A
Erie, Pa.
Erie'High School
Harvey belongs to that class who believe

that books are not merely a resting place for

dust. He always wants to know the why and
wherefore of everything.

MORRIS RUBIN *1) A H

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Fifth Avenue High School

His extraordinary good qualities and
accomplishments are so numerous, that it
would be the height of folly to enumerate
them.

BENJAMEN SHECTER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Fifth Avenue High School

A most serious minded individual and a
staunch supporter of aesthetic Dentistry.
lVlAURICE SHERMER O A N

Farrell, Pa.

Farrell High School

Cap and Gown

No one can withstand the alluring and
enticing notes from his violin, and he just
ﬁddles his way into the charms of the fair
ones. Shermer claims that he shall employ
this accomplishment where sedatives are
indicated.

HowARD M. SCHWARTZ

Pittsburgh. Pa.

Fifth Avenue High School

Schwartz claims a wide knowledge of the
intracies of athletics. He is frequently seen
in the laboratory expounding his theories to
one of our clever Varsity men.

HAROLD C. SEAMON A 2 A

Bellevue, Pa.

Bellevue High School

Although not enjoying the best of health.
Harold has shown us that he is no quitter,
but has some of the real stuff.

MARTIN O. SIEMON ‘I’ Q

Latrobe, Pa.

Indiana Normal

"Siemon's one ambition is to be as good as
Dr. Ohl. We admire his ambition, but do
not think that his expectations will be realiz-
ed. A diligent worker, who likes to show us
just how things ought to be done.

WILLIAM H. SII.vIs

New Bethlehem, Pa.

New Bethlehem High School

"Bill" is one of our fellows who says very
little, in fact you would hardly know he was
around. “Get away from me you rufhans."
He is a fiend for work and never lets the dust
gather on his books.

EDWARD R. SKINNER, “0tis" A 2 A
Fairmont, W. Va.
Fairmont Normal School
"Otis” is one of our much married men.

A more or less sedate individual, but yet

quite likeable, possessing a pleasing personal-

ity.

Cap and Gown (2); Dental Owl Editor
I9I9; Senior Dental President
Behold our class President! Charles is so
ambitious that he was chosen to lead the
destinies of the I919 class. He is some ath-
lete, too, having won his letter in Track.

LYMAN W. Spencer, “C/ripmonk"

Carbondale, Pa.

Carbondale High Schools - '

University of Pennsylvania

To look at him you would wonder how he
does it, but this fellow knows more girls than
any two fellows in the class. A ﬁend for
dancing, in fact, said to be the originator of
the Spencerian Walk, one of McDougall's
new steps. "Ask Mac, he knows."

ED A. STAHL, " Jake" ‘I’ Q

Scranton. Pa.

Scranton High School

Bellefonte Academy

Football (I) (2) (3) (4); Wrestling Team

“_]ake" comes from the hard coal regions,
so is naturally a hard guy. In spite of this
he gets along well, in fact, is said to be a

shining light among the women. His ath-
letic ability we are sure of.
LELAND STANFORD, “Tip” Druids ‘P’ Q

Shefﬁeld, Pa.

Bellefonte Academy

Bordentown Military Institute

Football (2) (3); Wrestling Team

"Tip" spends most of his evenings in his
room—there's a reason. A versatile athlete
who helped "Pop" Warner a whole lot, and
who, we think, will make good in his pro-
fession.

_IoE W. STRANGER. "Joe" A E A
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School
"Joe" has a habit of coming to school just

in time to miss the roll call, but this never

worries him any. His best friend is his
tobacco pouch. Never bothers the girls, so
incidentally, makes good in his studies.

W. NORMAN STEIN, "Doug. Fairbanks"
Sharpsburg, Pa. A X A
Sharpsburg High School
East Liberty Academy
Here's the chief gloom-chaser of the class.

The sunbeam smile of “Doug’s" cherub face,

knocks the women cold, especially

(censored). His winning personality will be

one of his main assets in life.

BRADEN H. SWANEY, “Buck" A E A
Uniontown, Pa.
Uniontown High School
West Virginia University
Football (3); Senate l9|9
“Buck" is a big man in every sense of the

word. A stellar performer in baseball and

football. His only bad habit is getting tired
during lecture hours and putting his feet on
those in front of him.

MAURICE A. TAYLOR, “Dummy" A Z A
Linesville, Pa.

Linesville High School

Maurice is a man of no mean ability, for he
is not only a dentist, but also an accomplished
barber. It is rumored that his office will have
two chairs—a dental chair and a barber's
chair.

GODFREY TERRY, "Battling" A CD A
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

Not as hard as his nickname implies, but
strong on the ﬁnish. A quiet and eﬂicient
worker, and possessing a sense of humor that
often gets a good laugh.

PLENY G. TOOTHMAN, "Snake" A E A
Fairview, W. Va.

Fairview High School

This snake hunter certainly has the name
for the profession. He is a lad who has lately
joined the Benedicts, and will make one
grand husband.

JOSEPH A. TUCKER, "Tuckel"

Pittsburgh, Pa.

California Normal School

Menorah Society

Joe may not always pronounce his words
just right, but he generally thinks in a straight
line. He is reported to have measured a
patient for a suit while waiting for a demon-
strator. He denies all relationship to “Old
Dan" and “Little Tommy."

LAWRENCE E. VANKIRK, A.B., “Van” ‘F9
Pittsburgh, Pa. (I) A (3
Allegheny High School
Washington & Jefferson College
"Van" is certainly some student and bids

fair to make a name for himself. What he

doesn’t know about Dentistry isn't worth
knowing. The only thing that he has had
trouble with so far, is growing that fuzz on his

upper lip.

DONALD C. WALKER, “_]ohnny" ‘P’ Q

West Monterey, Pa.

Clarion Normal School

Here is one of the jolliest fellows of the
class. A ﬁne workman and a shark at theory.
However, he ﬁnds time for devotion to the
female sex.

ALLEN D. WEINSWEIG, “Doc"

East Liverpool, 0.

East Liverpool High School

Ohio State University

No, don't get thirsty when you hear his
name, for he is a rather dry young man of
great energy. He spent his first year at Ohio

State, repented, and was baptized in Pitts-

burgh. He is always in a hurry.

ROBERT L. WELLER A E A
Wilkinsburg, Pa.
Wilkinsburg High School
Weller has shown us by his scholastic stand-

ing that he frequently burns the midnight oil.

Aside from this, he has his mind centered in

one direction——Society. It can't be helped

that he comes from Wilkinsburg.

VANE C. WELLS. "Marty"
McMechan, W. Va.
McMechan High School
Union High School
One of our "Southern Gentlemen" from

West Virginia. An ardent advocate of the

policy, "Enjoy Life While You’re Healthy."

One of our best little workers in school, his

one fault being a weakness for the women.

RICHARD T. Wrcxs, "Dick" ‘I’ Q

Ebensburg, Pa.

South Fork High School

Johnstown High School

Another married man of our class who is
making good. “Ask Max, he knows." One
of those broad-minded, serious fellows who
thinks right, and acts accordingly. An excel-
lent student and fellow class-mate.

M. E. WILKES, "Mike"

Wanamie, Pa.

Wanarnie High School

Mike certainly does like the odor of Ken-
ny's place. He handles a wicked stick in
pool. which comes second nature to him, and
which, beside entertaining the ladies, is his
chief pastime.

GORDON M. WILLIAMS

Coalport, Pa.

Utahville High School

“Well, how are you this morning, Gordon."
So says Fiﬁ, his right hand man and legal
advisor. This handsome lady-killer is a per-
fect model for Styleplus clothes. and will
make his home town proud of him.
B. ALVIN WRIGHT, “Spoofer" A 2? A

Latrobe, Pa.

Latrobe High School

Glee Club (I) (2); Cap & Gown (2)

Speaking of social aspirations, you can
stop right here. This fellow carries a roster
of social activities that is as heavy as his
school work. One of our hardest workers in
school, who, when once he starts, can hardly
be stopped. He is quite a ladies’ man and
swings a nasty ankle on hard wood floors.
GEORGE E. WRIGHT A Z A

Greensburg, Pa.

Greensburg High School

This chap spends his spare time reading
the medical dictionary. His one ambition
seems to be to absorb all the knowledge he
can on the subject of Dentistry, and tell us
about it. His attraction to the fair sex is
very strong in one direction.

JOHN G. YODER ‘P’ Q

New Kensington, Pa.

New Kensington High School

Besides having a hotel named after him,
"Hotel Yoder," this modest unassuming lad
comes from New Kensington. "Camels" are
his specialty between patients. He possesses
a good nature and smooth tongue, two pre-
requisites for success in this profession, so his
chances look fairly good. ‘
