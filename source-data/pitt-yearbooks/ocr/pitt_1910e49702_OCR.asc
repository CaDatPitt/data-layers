one exception (the University of Nash-
ville), in the United States. west of the
Appalachian mountain ranges.

The early pioneers who crossed the
Alleghenies, and settled at the forks of
the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers.
brought with them the same ideals which were ﬁxed in the
minds of the Plymouth settlers. As soon as homes were

 

built, they turned their thoughts toward the welfare of their
children. Believing “that the education of youth ought to be
a primary object with every government," a school was started
as early as 1770, which was to be known a few years later. as
the Pittsburgh Academy. An act of legislature. incorporating
the school. was passed in 1787.

The incorporators were men of affairs and prominence at
that time. and their activity in founding the school was just
one of the many examples of their public spirit——especiall_v

United States Congressman, and Minister to Denmark: Hon.
Daniel Agnew, ‘25. Chief Justice of Pennsylvania -Supreme
Court.

Twice between 1843 and 1849 the University sustained the
complete loss of its buildings, and as a result, the regular work
was discontinued till 1855.

In 1854, a new building was erected at the corner of Ross
and Diamond streets. and instruction was resumed in the fol-
lowing year. The University prospered during the following

. three years, especially with regard to the student body.

The coming of. Dr. George Woods in 1858 as Principal.
marked the beginning of a time of material expansion. In
the same year a valuable collection of geological specimens
was bequeathed to the University, and money was secured to
furnish a Chemical l.ahorato1‘y.

Later. endowments for a Chair of Natural Sciences and
a Chair of Astroph_\"sics were given by a number of l"’ittsl)urg-
crs, many of whom were alumni.

for a new charter. This time, its curriculum was to be
enlarged, and the name changed to “The VVestern Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania.” The men who petitioned and
to whom the charter was granted were those whose
names are still familiar to us today. Almost all of them
were identiﬁed in city or national affairs. Wen who
later became jurists, Congressmen, Cabinet Members, or
Foreign Ministers, were numbered among them.

The ﬁrst faculty was very catholic in regard to its
members—~Romanist, Presbyterian, Reformed, and As-
sociate Presbyterian worked together at a time when de-
nominational rivalry was so keen. That these men were
well chosen and were qualiﬁed to give instruction in the

the character of the graduates of the ﬁrst few years: Rev.
Dr. Thomas C. Guthrie, ’23, of the United Presbyterian
Church; Hon. W. W. Irwin, ’24, Mayor of Pittsburgh.

The first permanent endowment of the l'ni\'ersit_\' amount—
ing to $100,000 came from \\"illiam Thaw in I871, the people
of l’ittsl)urg'h contriliuting a like sum.

During the next year the l4egislatu1‘e enlarged the powers
of the Uiiiversity. The mayors of Pittsliurgli and .\lleg'l1en_\‘
became ex—0fﬁcio members of the board. and the presiding
officer was changred from Principal to Chancellor.

The right to take and administer property was now
enj0_\'ed l)_\' the L'niVe1‘sit_\'.

A preparatory department was formed in 1860 and Con-
tinued till 1889. when it became a separate institution.
Instruction in militar_\' tactics was carried on for a time under
the direction of Major F. C. Chalfant.

Eminent men, such as Rohrhacher in German: Langley
and Phillips in Chemistr_\' 1 Jillson in Iliology and Goff in Math-
ematics, became members of the Facnlt_v. Each year added
something in the way of frrowth. until in the spring‘ of I880

In 1882. the Llniversity
buildings were sold to Alleglieiiy
County for use as a Court llouse

edifice. and the work of the Uni-

became a member of the Faculty. He broadened the mathe-
matical course a11d reorganized and greatly enlarged the
courses in engineering.

Chancellor Milton ll. Goﬁ? succeeded Dr. .\[acCracken in
I884. Three events specially marked this administration:
First. new buildings were erected on ()bservatory Hill. Sec-
ond. a 11ew and advanced curriculum \vas adopted. Third.
the apparently irreparable loss by death of \\'illiam Thaw.
August 17th. 1889. To him. perhaps more than any other
individual. the lfniversity owes its present prosperity and
standing. At the death of Chancellor Goff. Rev. \\'m. J.
Holland. l).D.. was elected as his successor.

Up until this time. while provision was made in the char-
ter for full Lvniversity work. and while it was called a L'niver—
sity. it continued to be a College only. Under the direction
and wise guidance of Chancellor Holland the expansion into a
University in fact rapidly took place.

Departments in Electricity and .\lining were added to the
lingineering School. and courses in graduate study in various
branches were laid out. Large additions were made to the
instrumental equipment of the various laboratories of the
institution.

In 1392 the \Vestern Pennsylvania Medical College \vas
amalgamated with the L'niversity as its .\'Iedical Department.
Tn 1895. a Department of Legal Instruction was added. and the
l’ittsburg'h College of Pharmacy was united with the University-

ln 1896 the Department of Dentistry was established.
Now with seven departments. the L'niversity l)ecame in fact.

During Dr. Hollands administration. prosperity attended
the L'niversity. Various gifts in money. apparatus. and speci~
mens were received. Scholarships amounting‘ to $31000 were
given, and within the next two years funds were secured to
establish a Department of Vining‘ l7.ngineering' and to rebuild
the Allegheny Observatory. Two buildings were given to
the .\ledical Department: one for use as a .\laternity Hospital:
the other for clinical purposes.

On May 26th, 1904. the present incu1n-
bent, Rev. Samuel Black McCormick, D.D.,
LL.D., then President of Coe College, Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, was elected Chancellor. His
constructive ability soon showed itself.

Early in the year 1908, the University
secured a new location in the very center of
Greater Pittsburgh. The tract is forty-three
acres in extent and forms a part of what is
becoming the educational and institutional
center of the community. For the ﬁrst time
in one hundred and twenty years of the Uni-
versity's history, it has ground upon which to
erect buildings as they are needed.

During the summer 1908, the name of
the University was changed from the Western
University of Pennsylvania to the University
of Pittsburgh, thus identifying it more partic-
ularly with the city.

The new Mining building is practically
completed, and the new Engineering building

love for and interest in the L'niversity. especially in its (')‘.’)ser\'-

While his pressing private business did not permit him to

most valuable service and maintained unimpaired the high effi-

buildings will be ready for occupancy for the fall term begin-
ning Septcmber, 1909. The other departments will now be
brought together as soon as money can be procured for the
purpose.

The l;'niversity of l’ittsburgh stands today upon an
enduring foundation. Its faculty in all departments number
about one hundred and ﬁfty. Its students are over thirteen
hundred. Its alumni about twenty-ﬁve hundred, of whom two
thousand are living. Its endowment is nearly one-half mil-
lion. and its total property including endowment is over one
million.

Vigorously wields his muck-rake, the while, giving ex-
pression to his pent-up feelings in impressive bunches of
impassioned oratory. He is the best of friends, the fair-
est of enemies, and a man Pitt is and will be proud of.

Here is “Curly”——but that’s not all. He sometimes
writes poetry (at the same time apologizing), is fond of
the drama, (melo—) music (ragtime), and to say nothing
of the girls. A football player, but not quite an “all-ameri—
can.

WILLIAMS

THOMAS EARL WILLIAMS, Kittanning, Penn.
Kittanning Academy, ’06.

“Cap” or “Mugs” Williams from Kittanning (whatever
that is), scientist at large. In Biology, he discovered an
Echinorhynchus gigas in the nephridium of a Macrobdel1a-
valdiviana, and in chemistry, his forte, he is about to per-
fect a condensation process for obtaining allyl alcohol from
hot air. But alas these noble professions are soon to lose
this great man, as he intends to abandon them to become
manager of “jingling Johnston.”

Penn.
(Civil). Kentucky Military Institute. Class Football,
1, 2. Class Baseball, 1, 2. Class Basket—ball, 1, 2, 3.

Continued sittings at the Gayety and other institutions
of fine art have turned our friend into a real comedian
this year. His wise and witty sayings have got the pr0f’s
“goats.” Chief object in life. outside of getting his studies,
is jollying his side~partner “Dick.”

North Side.
(Civil). Allegheny High School, ’06. ’Varsity Track,
1, 2. Assistant Business Mmxager Cournnt, 3. Class Treas-
urer, 3.

A lad who is big in every sense of the word and just
as good as he’s big. Never seems to forget anything, and
yet has forgotten more than the average student ever
thinks of thinking of. He has been seen with some women

folks lately—but beware, John.

CRUM DAVIS

FRANK MURRAY CRUM, Bridgeville, Penn.

(Civil).
Pittsburgh Academy, ’04.
Y. M. C. A., 3.

Crum doesn’t take the daily trip between Bridgeville
and the Smoky City for nothing. Usually goes home at
night with his satchel full of books and his head full of
knowledge. A real student who believes in cutting out
all “horse play.” Can be depended on to make good.

CARL EUGENE DAVIS, ‘P24’, Pittsburgh, Penn.

(Civil). Blairsville High School, ’02. Class President, 2.
Athletic Editor, “Courant,” 1, 2, 3. Press Representative.
Athletic Association, 1, 2, 3. Member Student Board, 3.
Athletic Editor, “OVVL.”

If Carl or “Ink-pot” had been writing at the rate of a
dollar :1 word, he could by this time have built us :1 third
building (even if it did cost a “quarter”). Believes in
helping the “nexvsies” along, and is a fancier of feminine
beauty. A fellow who can stick to his motto, “Do it now."

DYGERT

EGAN

WARREN BENSON DYGERT, Jr., AK: Bellvue, Penn.

(Civil).

Bound Brook High School, ’06.
Rutgers College.

Glee and Mandolin Clubs, 3.
Owl Art Board.

Dygert is an exceptionally good fellow, who got his
early engineering education under Eddie Bowser at Rut-
gers. Considering the most honorable Mr. Bowser and
the Calculus he injects into his Mechanics, we can hardly
blame the boy for cutting away from the New Jersey
school.

FRANCIS DESALES EGAN, AA-: McKeesport, Penn.

(Electrical).
Grove City College.

Egan came to us this year not thoroughly grounded
in the basic principles of an engineering course; viz.: Five
Brothers. He is so quiet and polite that the Classicals
would claim him, but no, a more strenuous existence for
him. Distinguished for never having “cut up” in physics
and for attending the Junior Prom.

FERREE FRAZIER

EUGENE CLARE FERREE, AA» Coraopolis, Penn.

(Electrical).
Coraopolis High School, ’06.

Ferree is rapidly getting over his bashfulness a11d even
cuts up sometimes. A quiet lad who looks after his ow11
affairs and usually does about the right thing. Public
speaking is the only thing so far that has proved too
much for him.

ALBERT SMITH FRAZIER, Pittsburgh, Penn.

(Civil).
Allegheny High School, ’05.
Class Teams, 1, 2, 3.

“Al," the man with the athletic temperament, adopted
early in his career the motto, ‘‘Don’t let studies interfere
with your regular college course.” However, there is some
class to him, and system in his methods for he always
takes “place” in the race at exam. time. Never identiﬁed
with the “also-rans.”

HAROLD APPO HAYNES, Washington, D. C.

(Electrical).
\Nashington (D. C.) High School.
Class Baseball, 2. W

A good—dispositioned little fellow who is well liked
by everyone. Sports a smile that never wears off. VVishes
to announce to the world that he is not responsible for
the name that he is afﬂicted with, having had it given to
him before he Could object.

CHARLES WESLEY KINCAID, AA-2 Pittsburgh, Penn.
(Civil). Pittsburgh High School. Class Basket-hall, 3.
Class Secretary, 2, 3.

“Boncs," with the swan—like movements; seven feet
tall and still growing. Bright, although inclined to take
things easy at times. Never troubles trouble and his life
is as tranquil as a brook. Never known to fall in love,
get drunk, or use “cuss” words.

The boy with the many titles and deserving of them
all. “Fresh” is a good scout who burns up the cinder
track when he starts on a mile. Success hasn’t turned his
head and he’s the same little rough-houser he was when
we knew him as “Fresh.”

WILLIAM EMSLIE MILLAR, Bellevue, Penn.

(Civil).
Allegheny High School.

Millar decided to get down to business after his Fresh-
man year and stands in well with the profs. now. Has
not developed the blufﬁng ability. however, and it’s easy
to tell when he doesn’t know what he is talking about.
Evidently has the girls on the brain as he has developed

ALLEN ROBERT TAYLOR, Brookland, D. C.

A nice young fellow from the District of Columbia.
No one ever heard of Brookland being on the map, but that’s
where he says he grew up. A plugger who has the habit
of digging everything out for himself. First flunk came
in Physical lab. and was served out a la Mason. It was
a surprise~but there were others.

VOELKER

ALOYS VOELKER, B.S., Pittsburgh, Penn., North Side.

The greatest and most active member of the “shark"

Math. as well as Richards likes to eat. The harder they
come, the better he likes them. Modest as a kitten and
lets other people blow his horn. There’s no alloy about
Voelker even if his name does imply it.

ARTHUR VINCENT WYNNE, AA, Glenwillard, Penn.

Considered an expert auto—wrecker. Joe says he will

that are secreted in his face.

MARGARET MARKLE MATLOCK BRINTON, New Castle,

CONNELLY

HARRY SMITH CONNELLY, A33, Pittsburgh, Penn.

If “Rough House Con” ever turned his attentions to
house breaking, his specialty would be restaurants. \\'itl1
an appetite something wonderful, he has been heard to
remark that he would rather “blow in” his loose nickels
at a dairy lunch than give them to a doctor.

CHARLES AVERY DRYDEN. ‘mv Carrick, Penn.
Pittsburgh High School. '99.
Cap and Gown Club. 1.
“Dry” is a pretty good boy even if he does spend a
dreary existence in Carrickl Let us hope for his sake that
he will some day move down from behind the sun to a
livelier district.

FORDYCE GOEDELL HUSTON

JAMES ALFRED FORDYCE, ‘1’9» Graysville, Penn.
University of Virginia.

The man of many hats, a parson in appearance and
is known as the “school pap.” Jim is a good fellow and
studious, and we hope he will neyer be A. J. enough to
experiment with "ﬁve dice.”

OSCAR HENRY GOEDELL, ‘l’9» Pittsburgh, Penn.
Mereersburgli Academy, ’03.
Cap and Gown Club, 1.

The “human parasite." This young man is also an
“accumulator” of all the necessary adjuncts to a well
equipped dental office. Auto know when to jump by this
time, if only his board bill.

CLYDE RAMSEY HUSTON, Bolivar, Penn.
Indiana State Normal, ’06.

He will no doubt create quite a sensation when he
tacks out his shingle in Bolivar. Is somewhat of a “rube,”
talks just a little too much to Miss , during lectures,
but with all these little reﬂections, he stands well up in
his class.

HARRY RAY BALSINGER, iii Balsinger, Penn.

“Cold water” is the name applied to Harry; and he
has always contended that clear cold water is the proper
thing. Right. old boy. it is (on the side). He would be a
ladies‘ man but it costs too much.

I02

HARRY LEE BRINEY, Pittsburgh, Penn.
Pittsburgh High School, ’06.
Cap and Gown Club, 1.

This young man will be a great help to brother Ross
some day no doubt. At least indications at present point
in that direction. Always use the long “i" in addressing
him.

ROSS WEIR BRINEY, Pittsburgh, Penn.
Pittsburgh High School, ’06.
Cap and Gown Club, 1.

He wishes it generally known that the “i” in his name
be given the long sound, which gives him a somewhat
salty name. No doubt he loves the ocean breezes and
wears a summer hat in the good old summer time.

RAY BERNARD BUTLER, 4'9» Pittsburgh, Penn.
Pittsburgh High School, ’07. Class Football, 1.
Gown Club, 1. Junior Prom. Committee, 3.

He might be termed the “late” Mr. Butler, yet he is
quite a live one. Also a‘pugilist (he thinks), but wears no
medals so far as we can see. Yet no doubt he is a bright
“Ray” in the house of Butler.

Cap and

HERMAN LEONARD EBER, Pittsburgh, Penn.
Pittsburgh Academy.

Herman is very prepossessing (P) and has a lovely
crop of cherry tinted hair which adds greatly to his ap-
pearance. He is a hard worker and the position he holds
in the class is the proof.

SAMUEL DWIGHT EMERICK, 334: Butler, Penn.

“Heiny” hails from the wild and woolly “state of But-
ler,” where a choice production of good whole-souled Ger-
man manhood comes from, of which he is an example.
Some are built on a larger scale.

PAUL BENJAMIN ERNST, Pittsburgh, Penn.

Pittsburgh Academy, ’0S.
Cap and Gown Club, 1.
Mandolin Club, 2.

He is the possessor of some ﬁne “opticional" instru-
ments. The boys who like him most address him by the

endearing name of “Fat Head.” But with all that, he has
musical ability and adds much to the Glee Club.

THOMAS VINCENT FLEMING, Germantown, Penn.

This gentleman was at one time a well-known base-
ball player. Very partial to the Teutonic people, so much
so that he acknowledges Germantown as his home. Always
demands a german-silver spoon to eat his soup with and
dearly loves the fragrant limburger.

WILLIAM ROSS HAGUE, Swissvale, Penn.
Swissvale High School, ’06.
Class Treasurer, 1.

He would take good care of our ﬁnances now (if
we had any). We notice that Willie is always anxious
to catch a certain train each evening and we often wonder,
“could such be the case that a fair one met him on his
return home?”

REUBEN BROWN HOOVER, Dayton, 0.

“Rube” hails from the land of Soldier's Homes and
Cash Registers. His specialties are travel, cologne, and
“cofﬁn—nails.” He squanders a bunch of his lunch money
on the latter article and is older than he looks.

FELIX JOSEPH MCPARLAND, ‘P9: Pittsburgh, Penn.

Known as “Little Packey,” hits the pipe very often
but not to his discredit. VVe do not mean by this that
he is a plumber, no, he has no inclination to lead us to

The believe that he is learning the trade of millionaire.

BENJAMIN SAPPER, Pittsburgh, Penn.

“For he had a Roman nose,
And his cheek was like a rose
In the snow.”
These few beautiful lines were so ﬁtting when applied
to Benny that we could not resist the temptation to quote
them.

THEODORE STRAUB, ‘W: Stoyestown, Penn.

This large bundle of good nature is known as “Beany”
and is the direct descendant of that race of people who
exist mainly upon that appetizing and wholesome fruit
known as “sauerkraut.” He is also our class president and
a good one.

HARRY MARCUS SCHWARTZ, Pittsburgh, Penn.
Pittsburgh Academy, ’07.

No doubt his initials also stand for “holy Moses.” He
always chews his own tobacco (sometimes) and always
chews it with his own face, the one that actually grew
on him. It’s our gain and his loss.

FRANK FREDRICK WAELDE, ‘P9: Meadville, Penn.
Cap and Gown Club, 1.

Has a lovely complexion, all his own, which broke
many a heart in Meadeville. Is a good fellow, almost
studious, and is always very prompt in attending lectures
(sometimes) and may be a good dentist some day.

CHARLES HENRY WINE.
“OWL” Board.

HARRY TROTTER WORKMAN, Pittsburgh, Penn.
Susquehanna, ’03.

Is quite a “workman” when at his favorite occupa-
tion of accumulating dental instruments, and we feel safe
in saying, without fear of contradiction, that his stock
already would make some of the smaller wholesale houses
in the state take to the tall timbers. (\Vhat will the
harvest be?)

PITTSBURGH IN ATHLETICS

HAT a very small percentage of the thousands for victory on many a hard fought ﬁeld. VVorking under the

 

partment of college athletics realize, is what a
far reaching effect such events have in shaping
the destinies of the educational institutions
represented and in gaining them the close sym-
pathy of the public, that important factor for
A college of today without athletics soon feels
the lack of this co—operative spirit and as a result, practically
all of the large institutions of learning feature athletics in all
branches.

How did the people in the times of our forefathers size
up the college man? As a dried up and thoroughly detestable
old fossil whose associations with books and the deep myster-
ies of science had turned him into a being totally unable to
understand the true meaning of life.

What is the feeling today? The college man is looked up
to by the right thinking class of people as a healthy, lively,
fun loving and yet reliable inhabitant of this great globe of
ours—in fact, a man who knows what real life is and the joys
which are incident to it. Go back to the very origin in search-
ing for the cause of this remarkable change and you will dis-
cover the little seed “Athletics,” which from a little acorn has
developed into a mighty oak.

Fortunately, a number of years ago and more especially
since the advent of our present Chancellor, Dr. McCormick,
the true value of athletics for the upbuilding of the University
was recognized and as a result the Blue and Gold has stood

their success.

I22

TheL of spectators who witness the annual battles on severest handicaps which could be imagined, our athletes have
33’ gridiron, diamond, track or 111 any other de- always made a very creditable showing in everything they

undertook to do and although defeat has come at times and
discouraging conditions have arisen on all sides, those who
were at the helm kept manfully at their task.

In football, instead of being able to go from the class
room to a handy gym, don the ﬁghting togs and be on the
playing field within a half hour, many of the players were
compelled to undergo the greatest inconvenience at all times
in order to attend the daily practices. The early work-outs
were taken on the Hill Department ﬁeld adjoining the training
house where the facilities were very poor, indeed. Later, the
scene of action was transferred to Exposition Park where
improved, yet far from ideal. advantages for practice were
offered.

In track athletics it was even worse. The only available
place for practice was on the Hill Department track and
although those interested set to work with a will and did their
best to put the place in shape. the facilities could hardly have
been termed even third class. Students of the Medical, Dental,
Pharmacy and Law Departments who desired to try for the
team were especially handicapped although a number of them
came out and did good work in the season's events.

VVith the advent of the new University and the prospects
of having a splendid athletic ﬁeld with proper gymnasium
facilities, our standing in the athletic world should soon be
among the leaders. Here's hoping that the day is not many
years hence.

ATHLETIC

HE history of athletics in the University previous
to 1897 is associated more with individuals
than with the University, for up to that time,
the success or failure of the various teams de-
pended entirely upon the individual interest of

the athletes rather than from any Faculty or Alumni aid.

The result of this was that the development of a team
depended upon a few students who gave their time and money
to the form of athletics they loved. Such conditions meant
teams of variable strength from year to year, as there was no
system of coaching which developed the raw material properly.
This was, of course, not the status of all branches of sport, for
baseball ﬂourished at the University a generation ago and the
VV. U. I’. baseball team of 1888 to 1894 was widely known and
very successful. A little thing like using a semi-professional
pitcher or catcher, who was not a student, was, however,
sometimes indulged in, if necessity required it, as the Collegi-
ate standards of those days did not frown upon such a proce-
dure.

The interest in track and ﬁeld athletics was paramount
at this period and a live Western Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Athletic Association and a State Intercollegiate Association, of
which the Western University of Pennsylvania—the only west-
ern member——belonged, as also the bitter rivalry between two
local athletic clubs, now unfortunately extinct, served to keep
up the students’ interest in the track and ﬁeld. This branch
of sport for years enjoyed the services of a professional trainer
who brought the University athletics of that time to a high
point of excellence.

HISTORY

VVhile football was played, it was only through the
medium of the many Eastern college athletes playing locally
on the club football teams that our teams learned the real
game. '

These various movements inspired solely by student en—
thusiasm without any help from Faculty or Alumni, culminated
in the “Golden Age” of our athletics from 1892-1894, when
we were pre-eminent in all branches of sport. Then the
inevitable happened. Many of the athletes graduated. others
left the University and from 1895-1897, University athletics
were hardly of a high school standard. except for a Merlical
School baseball team. The necessity for supervision and
advice from Faculty and Alumni was realized at that time.
and Chancellor Holland organized the ﬁrst Advisory Board of
Athletics, compose(l of James E. McKirdy. Harry S. Calvert,
John B. Scott, Walther Riddle, Edward E. Mayer and Clifford
B. Connelly.

This Board tried to create order out of chaos, securing
Hoskins of State and the next year, Trenchard of Princeton,
as coach. and also tried to organize the students. but ﬁnally
succumbed to an enormous accumulation of old debts of for—
mer student bodies.

Affairs jogged along for a couple of years more until
1904, when a few enthusiastic Alumni laid plans for a good
football coach, a training table and a sufﬁcient number of con-
testants. Their plans bore fruit and the progressive betterment
in athletics of the last few years, and the present efficient plan
is the direct result of this effort of theirs.

TH E ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION

HE management of the athletic affairs of the
University is in the hands of a General Athletic
Committee and an Executive Committee, action
by these committees being subject to the approval
of the Board of Trustees of the University.

The General Athletic Committee consists of
the Chancellor (ex—ofﬁcio), a member of the

Board of Trustees, a Faculty representative from
each department. ﬁve Alumni representatives
elected by the Alumni Athletic Association (constituting the

Eligibility Committee), the Physical Director, one student
from each department elected by the student body of that

department (constituting the Student Committee), and the

captains of the various athletic teams as ex-ofﬁcio members
during their playing season.

The Executive Committee consists of the Chancellor, the
Treasurer of the General Athletic Committee, and three other
members——a faculty member, an alumni member and a student
member—~all three being elected annually by the General Ath-
letic Committee.

 

There is also an Alumni Athletic Association, consisting
of nine representatives in addition to a President, Vice Presi-
dent, Secretary and Treasurer. Of the nine representatives,
three are elected for periods of one, two and three years
respectively. This Association acts in an advisory capacity.

All business in connection with University athletics, such
as keeping the accounts, arranging of schedules, etc., is in
direct charge of a Graduate Manager, who is elected by the
General Athletic Committee. He has the power of appointing
stu(lent managers for the various teams as deemed advisable,
subject to the approval of the Student Committee. Professor
Alexander Silverman of the Department of Chemistry, Colle-
giate and Engineering Department, has held the position of
Graduate Manager most efﬁciently for the past two years.

The ﬁnancial support of the students consists of the pur-
chase of an athletic book, which admits the holder to all
athletic contests played by University teams.
these books is ﬁve dollars.

HE FOOTBALL season of 1908 was peculiar
in many respects, and while it can hardly be
said to have been a successful one for our
gridiron team, there were some very satis—
factory features connected with it which are
liable to be overlooked on account of the re-
verses experienced in the last two games.

VVitl1 “Jain” Moorhead and “Kacie"
Swenson in charge of the coaching and “Little” Banbury as
captain, the prospects for turning out a championship team
seemed brighter than at any time since 1904. Plenty of good
material appeared to be in sight for the various positions, with
no lack of good substitutes. Of the 1907 squad, thirteen men
reported, including Captain Banbury, Campbell. Mackrell and

Chatham, backs; Turner, center; Elliott, Sl1l111‘3.11 and Steven-

son, guards; Richards and Van Doren, tackles; Roe and Gold-

smith, ends; and De Lozier, quarterback. Among the new
men who early showed that they were of ’Varsit_v calibre were

Barrett and Budd, quarterbacks; Bailey, Sayre and Yielding,

linemen; Ent, Rosser and Quailey, backs, and ‘‘jack'' and

“Don” Lindsay, ends.

The regular practice season opened September 8th on the

University ﬁeld, Northside, the training quarters being in the

old Observatory building. which had
been ﬁxed up for that purpose the
previous year. A few days before the
opening game, practices were held on

the regular playing ﬁeld at Exposition
Park.

The season open.ed with three
minor games, Mount Union, Bethany
and Marietta Colleges being met
October 3rd, Ioth and I 7th in the order
named. These three games ‘brought
out some rather ragged work on the
part of the ’Varsity an(l indicated that
while the defense was well developed
owing to the number of veterans in
the line, the offense was not what it
should be and would require the care-
ful attention of the coaches.

The opening game of the.season
with MOUNT UNION COLLEGE
resulted in an easy victory for the
’Varsity. The score was 26 to 4,

l\lO11nt Union tallying its points on a
placement goal by O'Brien. Captain
Banbury, Mackrell and Rosser were
used in the backﬁeld in this game but
with the exception of the ﬁrst named, the
combination did not prove a satisfactory
one. Numerous substitutions were made
in order to try out the new material and
considering the fact that the weather was
more suited for baseball than such a
strenuous game as football, the showing
was not at all discouraging.

BETHANY COLLEGE also proved
an easy proposition on the Saturday fol-
lowing the Mount Union game and gave
the coaches a chance to try out practically
every candidate on the squad. A total
of 25 men were used in the two short
halves, all four candidates for the pivotal
position getting a chance to show their
ability at handling the team. One of
the brilliant features of this game was
a 90-yard run by Roe, he securing the
ball on the kick-off on the 20-yard line
and running the remaining 90 yards for a touchdown.

VARIETTA COLLEGE. the next opponent. put up a
bitter ﬁght. and the ragged work of the ’Varsity and disastrous
fumbles at critical stages almost enabled the Ohioans to keep
the game down to no score. The only touchdown was scored
by Campbell in the middle of the ﬁrst half and although the
ball was worked down to within striking distance of the goal

misplay usually cropped out to prevent another score. A.

safety in the second half made the ﬁnal score 7 to O. The
score of the 1907 game with Marietta was 6 to 0 in our favor.

128

\Vith the IRUCKNELL game but a week off. the coaches
set to work in earnest to get the ’Varsity in shape with the
result that the Lewistown aggregation was decisively defeated.
The ﬁnal score was 22 to 0, Bucknell failing to make one ﬁrst
down during the entire game. Owing to an injury to “]ack"
Turner, “Butcli” Sayre was sent in against his old tcam-
mates and played a very creditable game. “Tex" Richards.
who had been used at tackle in the ﬁrst three games and who
subbed for Captain Marshall in the 1907 squad, was shifted
to fullback and the change made a wonderful improvement in
the offense. His all-around work was the bright feature of
the game, a sensational 1o5—yard run from the kick-off in
the second half contributed by him, by far eclipsing any play
of the year at Exposition Park. The entire team showed a
marked improvement in form, “Fritz" Earrett doing nicely at
quarterback an(l the line proving to be a veritable stone wall.
The work of Van Doren and Elliott was especially praise-
worthy and they were in every play.

Only one touchdowniwas negotiated in ‘the ﬁrst half,
Richards carrying the ball over the line after it was rushed
down from the 45-yard line by Rosser, Lindsay and Banbury.

 

A FUMBLE—MARIETTA GAME

The second half proved more proﬁtable for the ’Varsity,
the second touchdown of the game coming shortly after the
kick—off. A 4o-yard run by Banbur_v, a forward pass from
Banbury to Roe and a short buck by Ent carried the ball over.
“Little Ban” secured the third touchdown on a 35-yard run
after two successfully executed onside kicks and big “Tex"
Richards’ Io5—yard run was responsible for the other one.

The ST. LOUIS UNIVERSITY team, a supposedly
invincible collection of stars, which had been defeating all the
best VVestern teams, was met October 31 at St. Louis and with
the ’Varsity in the height of form, a 13 to o scalp was brought
home from the Mound City. In this contest, the ’Varsity
gave a great exhibition of how the open game should be
played and although up against heavier opponents, the result
was never i11 doubt. The team left Pittsburg Thursday night
and landed in St. Louis Friday morning, having the entire
day to rest up for the game. A big crowd turned out to
witness the struggle, owing to it being the ﬁrst Eastern
attraction of the year.

Early in the game, honors were about even, St. Louis

ﬁeld to penetrate with
good results and our de-
fense succeeding in hold-
ing their weighty line
plungers even. Finally
Richards was given the
ball on St. Louis U's
43-yard line and went
through a big hole at
right tackle for a touch-
down. The half ended
with the score 6 to 0.
Two more points were
added to the score
shortly after the start of
the second half owing to
a poor pass by the St.
Louis center resulting
in a safety and the sec-
ond touchdown of the
game was then recorded
on an accurately ex-
ecuted forward pass
from Barrett to Roe, on
which the latter rail 64
yards. St. Louis news-
paper writers termed the
play “the fastest and
cleanest of its kind ever
sprung in St. Louis.”
VVith these sensational features interspersed in the game,
it was one of the most interesting of the year, the ﬁghting
spirit and dogged endurance displayed by the ’Varsity ﬁnally
landing them victorious. The best of treatment was received
from the St. Louis University management as well as from

the game owing to injuries although their
places were well taken care of by Quailey,
Campbell and Yielding.

The ﬁrst touchdown came like a ﬂash,
Hittner of Tech. being downed on the 10 yard
line after fumbling the kick-off. Their at-
tempt to punt out of danger resulted in a
fluke and it was our ball on Techs 25-yard
line. Quailey and Richards carried it from
this point over the line. “Tex" being credited
with the tally. On the next kick-off. Roe ran

and after the ﬁrst few minutes

of how large the score would
be. Captain Banbury and

Ioo yards for a touchdown but the officials, in

error, called him back to the Tech. 35-yard
line, claiming that he had stepped out of bounds at this point.
An injury to Quailey at this stage of the game caused a shift
in the backﬁeld, Campbell going to fullback and Richards to
left-half. Shortly after this change, Richards got away for a
35-yard run for a touchdown. The same player added another
tally before the half ended, running 32 yards on a delayed

pass. The half ended with the score 16 to 0. Tech. played
better football in the second half and but one more touchdown
was scored, Richards and Campbell battering the line for it.

VVEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY, a team that has
always proved a “Tartar" for the Blue and Gold, lived up to
its reputation the following Saturday. lovember 7, and
although defeated II to 0. put up one of the stiffest ﬁghts of
the year. Credited with a 0-6 game with old Penn and a I2-O
game with Marietta college, the team that held the ‘Varsity
down to 7-0. the Mountaineers came to Pittsburgh fully con-
ﬁdent of victory and for a while it looked as though their pre-
dictions would come true. To make matters worse, Captain
Banbury was unable to get in the game, Ent. Richards and
Campbell being in the backﬁeld.

The ﬁrst touchdown came easily and resulted from a
fumble l)y Young, West Virginia's right halfback. On the
first line up after the kick—off with the ball on their 17-yard
line. the ever alert “Jack" Lindsay grabbed the ball when
!Young allowed it to slip from his grasp and crawled over
the line for a touchdown. VVhile this was the only score of
the half. the ’Varsity clearly outplayed their opponents and
should have had at least one more touchdown. Statistics
show that they gained 159 yards against 51 for \Vest Virginia.

In the second half, although a touchdown was scored, it
must be admitted that things looked “blue” for a while and

that West Virginia had the best of the argument. Just at
the time when the visitors were tearing our defense into
shreds and a score seemed imminent, Pearcy, their quarter-
back was accommodating enough to toss a forward pass right
into the waiting hands of Homer Roe an(l the fleet little end
ran 103 yards for a touchdown. The work of “Dick” Nebin—
ger, the West Virginia left halfback, was one of the bright
features of this game, he being the Mountaineers chief
ground gainer. Governor—elect Glasscock of \Vest
Virginia, an alumnus of VVest Virginia Universitv.

hibition of the year and had the performance been duplicated
in the other big games, “Pop" V\’arner’s men would have been
the only ones to vanquish them. The first half saw the two
teams battling up and down the ﬁeld, neither being able to
gain any appreciable advantage. On one occasion, “Jack”
Lindsay captured a forward pass and covered 65 yards be-
fore being brought down by “Pete” Houser, the Tndian full-
back, while Carlisle failed several times at tries for ﬁeld goals.

The Redmen scored their only touchdown of the game
early in the second half, a recovered onside kick giving them
the ball on our 18-yard line from which point it was carried
over. The same kind of a play almost enabled the ‘Varsity to
tie the score later in the half and but for an erroneous decision
by Referee \Vbitin0', defeat might have been averted. The
chance came when Ent recovered Barrett's onside kick on the

proved the hero of this game, his three

the ﬁnal score 12 to 6. The game was a

cal stages handed the game to them,
poor judgment being shown in handling
punts and the ever alert State ends, Fuhs

recovering the ball on almost every mis-

well executed forward passes gave us the

ﬁnally carried it over after a number of
tries. The touchdown took some of the
sting away from the defeat and the re-
markable stand which the ’Varsity made at

ﬁcial statistics of the game show that we
gained a total of 19 yards against 144 for
State. Our linemen gave a wonderful ex-

on one occasion holding State safe

our one yard line. It was a pity, in-
deed, that fumbling, the great defect
which was so prominent all season,
spoiled the effect of all this great
work. The playing of Van Doren and
Elliott was brilliant, they being op-
posed to Smith and Cyphers, States
best linemen, and having considerably
the better of the argument. Budd
showed up well at quarterback when

THE FIRST INJURY

By capturing the game, State ob-
tained possession of the Spalding cup for
the first year, this trophy being offered
in connection with the animal State-Pitt
football games, under the following con-
ditions: The winner of the Thanksgiv-
ing Day game to have possession of it
each year, and at the end of ﬁve years,
the team having won the majority of the
games to gain permanent possession; in
case of tie games the team having won
the previous year to retain it for another
season and if the teams are tied in the
number of games won, at the end of ﬁve
years, it is to be competed for until the
tie is broken.

 

‘34

On Thanksgiving night, after the
State game, it was announced by the
Athletic Committee that a post-season
game had been arranged with \V. & J.
for December 5th, a week from the
following Saturday. Athletic rela-
tions had been broken off with that
institution the preceding Fall owing
to a dispute in regard to the one year
rule but on request of \V. & J. for a
game and their promise to abide by
the rules, without question. arrange-

ments were completed
for it. The entire
squad was sent into
the country for several days preceding the
game in an effort to get them in shape for
the struggle, but of no avail. Almost every
member of the team appeared to have devel-
oped an attack of staleness and with W. & J.
playing with a dash and display of spirit the
equal of which has never been seen in Pitts-
burg, the ’Varsity was easy prey for them.
The ﬁnal score was 14 to 0 and there is no
denying the fact that Captain Branbury's
men did not have a ghost of a chance to win
at any time. W. &  was simply unstopable
and although eight of their points were due to
ﬁeld goals by Duffey, their backs had little
trouble getting through our hitherto invinci-
ble defense for big gains. Statistics show that
they gained 230 to our 89 yards, which state-
ment speaks for itself. The kicking of
Duffey, of W. & J., was one of the bright
features of the game and this had perhaps

TURNER

more than anything else to do with
landing the Red and Black victor-
ious.

Fumbling started the trouble
in the ﬁrst half, Barrett and Rich-
ards letting one of Duffey's spirals
get away from them after the ﬁrst
few scrimmages and the ball was
never out of our territory during
the rest of the half. Finally VV. &
J. worked it down to within a few
yards of the line and Marshall
was shoved over. The half ended
with the score 6 to O.

The second half was a repeti-
tion of the ﬁrst, Duffey's two ﬁeld
goals adding eight additional
points.

Thus the season ended with
two disastrous defeats——truly a
gloomy outcome of what had prom-
ised to be the most successful foot-
ball season in our history. Where
the trouble was it is impossible to tell. although it can be
safely said that the team was capable of much better work
than that displayed in several of the important games——
especially those with State and W. & J.

ROE

When talking about the last two defeats, it might be well
to go over the season as a whole, and consider some of the
factors which entered into its failures and successes. In the
ﬁrst place, the team was especially unfortunate in having some
of its best men injured in practice and minor games which
prevented them from displaying true form in the more im-
portant struggles. Big “Doc” Van Doren was the ﬁrst man
to join the hospital list although his injury did not handicap

‘35

the team so much at the time. He was able to resume his old
place at tackle in the Bucknell game and played sensational
football during the rest of the season. Center “Jack” Turner
was one of the most unfortunate players on the squad. A
twisted ankle received in practice kept him out of the Buck-
nell game and the injury handicapped him all year. In the
Indian game he was compelled to give way to Yielding early
in the ﬁrst half and although he played in the State and W. & J.
games, he was unable to show his old—time speed. Captain
Banbury and Richards were the other cripples of the team, the
little leader suffering all season from a badly torn tendon in
his leg. Richards was hurt in the Indian game just at the
time when he was playing the most sensational football of the
year and his end running and terriﬁc line bucking were setting
Pittsburgh talking. He was of little use in the State and
VV. & J. games on this account and was compelled to leave both
of them.

The injury to Turner necessitated the development of a
new man for the center position and “Slim” Yielding proved
a splendid substitute. He played his ﬁrst game against St.
Louis and more than held his own. Sayre held down the
position against Bucknell and also showed that he could be
depended on there.

At the guards, “Jack” Shuman and “Bunny" Elliott were
always dependable and both men put up the best football of
their careers. The same can be said of Van Doren at left
tackle. The other tackle was ﬁlled alternately by Bailey and
Campbell after the shifting of Richards to the backﬁeld and
both these men showed class. The ends were well looked
after by Roe and Lindsay, both men being fast and aggressive
and good at handling onside kicks and forward passes. Bar-
rett showed up splendidly at quarterback until Thanksgiving
when a case of “staleness” seemed to demoralize his play.
The little fellow tried his hardest but seemed to be entirely
“off color” in the State and W. & J. games. Budd, who re-

The

OWL

lieved him in both these contests showed that he will be a
strong contender for the place this Fall.

The team’s offense, it must be admitted, never reached a
high grade of efﬁciency. Whether this was due to the coach-
ing or to lack of concentrated effort on the part of the men

new men in their positions in almost every game. Richards’
injury also weakened the team in the kicking department as
he was averaging 50 yards at the time he was hurt.

At the close of the season, Homer C. Roe, left end, was
unanimously elected captain of the 1909 eleven. He is a

TRACK AND FIELD REVIEW

ON SIDERING all the difﬁculties which were
encountered and the early closing of several
departments of the University, causing the loss
of a number of sure point winners, a very
creditable showing was made by the Track
Team durng the season of 1908. “Quince"
Banbury was the leader and he set a splendid
example for his teammates by winning practi-
cally everything he went after. “Fresh" Knotts who was a
reliable man in the distances, was elected Captain of the 1909
team after the dual meet with State College and should prove
one of the best track leaders the Blue and Gold has ever had.

The team was notably strong in the weight events, taking
about everything in sight in the dual meet witl1 Tech.‘, the In--
tercollegiate meet in Pittsburg and landing two ﬁrsts a11d a
second. third and fourth in the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
meet held at Harrisburg, Decoration Day. It was the proﬁ-
ciency of Zieg and Van Doren, especially, in these compctitions,
which helped the team out of several tight places.

In the hurdles, half mile, quarter mile and high jump
there was lack of material an(l this weakness overbalanced the
advantage gained by the weight men's efforts. “Artie” Solter.
the football end, who was touted as a wonder on the track, and
who was depended on for the quarter an(l hurdles, only took
part in one meet (that with Tech.) in addition to the Phila—
delphia relays, an(l was then not in condition to do himself
justice. The closing of the Medical School term then lost him
to the team and his absence was greatly felt in the meets which
followed, especially the Pittsburgh Intercollegiate.

The ﬁrst event of the year was the fourteenth annual
relay games at Philadelphia under the auspices of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. A team composed of Captain Ban-
bury, Brown, Jamison and Solter was sent to compete for
honors and succeeded in landing a good second to Carnegie
Tech., W. & I. being easily outdistanced and coming in third.

 

139

The exceptionally fast time of three minutes and thirty~seven
seconds for the distance was made by the winning team.
Manager Zieg also competed in the hammer event against
some of the best collegiate weight men in the country, being
beaten out of fourth place by only a foot. His best throw was
138 feet.

The relay races had
preceded the formal
opening of the track
season, the initial event
being an inter—class
meet at the Collegiate
and Engineering Depart-
ment. The original
schedule called for an
Inter-Department meet
at this time but owing
to examinations in the
other Departments, this
was abandoned. Al-
though the University
track where the meet
was held was in rather
poor shape, very good
time was made and the
events were, as a rule,
close and exciting. The
Juniors won the meet
with 36 points, 18 of
which were landed by
“Waldy” Zieg alone.
The Sophomores came
second with 30 points,
the Freshmen third with
22 and the Seniors

fourth with eight, a number of the athletes of the latter class
being unable to compete.

The ﬁrst outside competition was held the following Sat-
urday, May I6th, it being a dual meet with the Carnegie
Technical Schools. The ﬁght for ﬁrst honors was nip and
tuck all the way and when the ﬁnal event was decided the
score stood 59 to 58 in our favor—a single points margin.
Captain “Quince”‘Banbury was the individual star of this meet
and it was his nervy work in the last event——the broad jump—
which turned the tide of battle. The score up to that time was
a tie, 54 to 54, and the winning of ﬁrst place by him gave the
University the extra ﬁve points. Grifﬁth, of Tech., with a
jump of 20 feet even, had the best of the event until Banbury’s
last trial when by a splendid effort he jumped 20 feet 3 inches
and won ﬁrst place. In addition to taking this honor in the
broad jump, Banbury captured ﬁrst in the Ioo—yard and 220-
yard dashes and a third in the 220 hurdles—his efforts result-
ing in 16 points in all. Zieg and Van Doren were supreme in
the weight events, Zieg getting two ﬁrsts and a second and
Van Doren one ﬁrst and two seconds. Tech. did not get a
single point in any of the three weight events.

In the hurdles and distances, the opposing team scored
strong, Dowling getting ﬁrst in both hurdles, Bates winning
ﬁrst in the mile and half mile and Ross taking the quarter.
Griffith also won the high jump and Shoop the pole vault
although our men captured second and third in these events.
One of the best events of the meet was the mile run, Knotts
being beaten out by but a few inches by Bates. “Fresh” was
a little late in starting his sprint or would have landed the
place, as he ﬁnished strong.

The annual Intercollegiate and Interscholastic meet held
under the auspices of the University was the next event of the
season and was a great success. A total of four colleges and
eleven schools were represented. Carnegie Technical Schools
won the collegiate honors, scoring 82 points, the University

I 40

team being second with 61% points. East Liverpool High
School captured ﬁrst in the interscholastic events, scoring 59
points against 44 for Indiana Normal, the closest competitor.
Pennsylvania State College was expected to participate in the
meet, having sent in a large list of entries, but at the very last
minute a telegram was received from “Pop” Golden stating
that the State Faculty
would not sanction the
trip. This robbed the
meet of one of its best
features although the
battle between Pitts-
burgh and Tech. was
lively enough to suit the
most exacting. Captain
Banbury was not in the
best of shape for this
meet and was beaten out
of ﬁrst place in the 220-
yard dash although he
captured ﬁrst in his old
stand-by, the hundred,
by a very close margin.
Tech., as usual, was
strong in the hurdles,
high jump, pole vault
and distances and scored

two points making it practically impossible for our lads to
win under the circumstances. Knotts had the satisfaction of
beating out his old rival, Bates, in the mile run although
Wylie, of Tech., won the two mile from him by a hair.
Zieg and Van Doren again proved strong in the weight events,

the former establishing a new record for the hammer with a
throw of 140.2 feet. Van Doren also set a new record for the
shot put, getting 39 feet 5 inches.

In the Interscholastic events, East Liverpool High School
presented some strong men in Garner, Thompson and Foutts,
this trio capturing a total of 35 points. Foutts did sensational
work in the mile run, outdistancing all his opponents with a
record of 4:48——over four seconds better than the time made
in the Intercollegiate mile event. Indiana Normal gave the
Ohio school—boys a hard ﬁght for ﬁrst place but was beaten by

While it was impossible to send the entire team to the

honors with 52% points, Lafayette coming second with 35
and our lads third with 18. State annexed fourth with 16%
points and W. &  eighth, with but two. The meet was a Very
successful one in every way and will be an annual affair.

The closing event of the season was a dual meet with
Pennsylvania State at State College. Owing to all depart-
ments of the University being closed at this time, only a small
squad took the trip. State won easily by the score of 80 to
43. It is regretted that an earlier date could not have been
arranged for this dual with State as the showing made did
not represent the strength of the squad intact.

BASEBALL REVIEW

HILE the baseball team's record is not especi-
ally attractive in point of games won, the nine
was a pretty well balanced one, and with
proper coaching and practice would have been
almost unbeatable. Furthermore, the ﬁgures
show that no less than ﬁve games were lost
by a margin of one run, four of these defeats
coming on the Eastern trip.

 

Thounhurst proved a steady man in the box and did prac-
tically all the twirling, Brooks, \Veger and Solter helping him
out in several games. \Vhen Captain “Doc” Ralston was
compelled to leave the team after the close of the Dental De-
partment, “Thouny” was elected Captain and will serve in that
capacity during the season of 1909.

The hitting of the entire team was fairly good at all
times although, owing to lack of practice, the ﬁelding was a
little “off color" in several of the important games. In the
series with Carnegie Tech. for the city championship. the
Plaids were defeated two out of three games.

The season opened with three practice games with O. 8; P.
League teams, New Castle and Akron. The former team was
defeated 6 to I with Solter in the box but Akron was too
strong and won two games by big margins. The team then
continued its trip through Ohio, \Vooster, Kenyon and Mount
Union being played. \\'ooster won its game by the score of
7 to 4 although Kenyon and Mount Union were defeated by
scores of 6 to 2 and 4 to 2 respectively.

The team then returned to Pittsburgh and lined up against
the invincible Pittsburgh College team at Exposition Park,
April 28th. Ray Miller, who later was a member of the
McKeesport O. & P. League team and a very effective twirler.

was in the box for the College, but had plenty of trouble land-
ing the game. Captain Ralston’s men started off like winners
and had the score 3 to 0 in the third inning, but the College
came back strong and after tieing the score in the ﬁfth, added
one more in the sixth. Both teams scored one in the eighth
and two in the ninth, the ‘Varsity almost winning out in the last
round. The ﬁnal score was 7 to 6.

The ﬁrst game of the series with Carnegie Tech. proved
somewhat of a farce and was won by the ’Varsity. 16 to 3.
Tech. played a good game until the sixth inning when their
twirlers went to pieces completely. The slaughter came in the
eighth inning when twelve runs were scored. Eighteen bases
on balls by the Tech. twirlers tells the tale. Farmer led in the

twirled for the ’Varsity and held Tech. safe at all stages.

The team then travelled to Morgantown where it was
scheduled to play the fast West Virginia University nine, April
30th and May 1st. The game on the ﬁrst date was postponed
on account of rain and two were played the following day.
Both resulted in easy victories for the Mountaineers, the ’Var-

the score being 5 to I in seven innings.

Owing to examinations, the team was inactive until June
6th when the second game was played with Carnegie Tech.
Once more was the ’Varsity victorious over Carnegie’s

proteges although the game was considerably closer than antic-
ipated. Poor ﬁelding gave Tech. a lead of two runs in the
fourth inning but Captain Thounhurst and his men got their
hats working and pounded out four runs and the game in the
next round. The score was 8 to 6. The ﬁelding of Dave
Johns and of McKinley and Slocum of Tech., also the batting;
of VVeger, Mackrell and Llewellyn were the features.

After an easy practice game with a picked Alumni team
which was won by the ’Varsity 23 to 2, the boys started on an
Eastern trip which terminated with the Commencement Day
game with Pennsylvania State. Although all ﬁve of the games
played were lost, the scores were all close and with any kind
of luck an even break would have resulted. The scores of
the games are as follows: Lehigh—6—2; Gettysburg, 4-3;
Carlisle Indians—4—3; Bucknell—4-3; Penn State—I-o. In
the State game, the ’Varsity played its best ball of the season,
“Pop" Colden’s men only winning out in the ninth inning on
an error. Thounhurst twirled in an effective manner and held
the hard hitting State nine down to seven scattered hits. State
had expected an easy victory in this game and the small score
was naturally a great surprise. “Paddy” Lynch, their best
twirler, was in the box and held our lads to four hits, in addi-
tion to fanning ten men.

The closing game of the season was played with Carnegie
Tech. June 16 and resulted in the Skibos lone victory. The
’Varsity presented a patched—up team owing to the inability
of Llewellyn to be at the initial sack and some ragged work
handed the game away. The score was 6 to 2.

HOCKEY REVIEW

r' . HOUGH the University was represented by a ﬁrst-
class hockey seven, the schedule consisted of but
four games, none of the neighboring schools, with
_ _ , the exception of Carnegie Tech. being represented
in this branch of athletics. Of these four games, the record
shows two defeats, one victory and one tie.

    

With the exception of Center Boyle, who was a product
of the Law Department, the ’Varsity seven was recruited from
the ranks of the Collegiate and Engineering Department.
Thounhurst (Med. ’o9) looked after point in the Yale game.

The team did not enjoy the advantages of a coach at any
time and considering this, did remarkably well. Reed was a
steady man at the net and is given credit with being one of
the best men at this position in collegiate ranks, Boyle at
center, Bien at rover and McDaniels at left wing were the
best men on offense, while “Bill” Mueller shown on defensive
work. Captain Roberts made a good aggressive leader and
was in the game every minute.

The opening game was with Carnegie Tech. and the
University team sprung a surprise by holding their opponents
to a tie, I-I. Tech. was reputed to have an invincible team
on the ice and the fact that they did not have a Walkaway
caused some consternation in their ranks. Neither side was
able to score in the ﬁrst half. Early in the second half, Tech.

155

took the lead when Bright took the puck up the ice unassisted
and shot one past Goalkeeper Reed. Boyle then tallied shortly
afterwards for the University.

Yale was played during the holiday vacation at Duquesne
Garden and Captain Roberts’ men were defeated, 4 to 2.

The Easterners managed to penetrate our defense owing
to superior team work although until the latter part of the
second half they were unable to secure any advantage. The
ﬁrst half ended with the score I to o in favor of Yale, Heron
scoring early in the period. McDaniels evened up the score
at the start of the second half but Martin and Fells scored in
rapid succession. Boyle scored our last goal, taking the puck
the entire length of the rink.

The University of Pennsylvania’s heavy team including
“Bill” Hollenbach, of football fame, was outspeeded and out-
played in the next game, which resulted 2 to 0 in favor of the
’Varsity. Griffith looked after goal in this contest and did well.
Boyle and Bien shot the goals, one being scored in each half.

The ﬁnal game was then played with Carnegie Tech. and
went to that team by the score of 2 to 1. Alan Bright was the
star for Tech. and his individual efforts had more than any-
thing else to do with landing his side ahead. Boyle and Bien
did the best work for the ’Varsity, the latter being credited
with the lone goal scored.

BASKET-BALL REVIEW

HE University, for the ﬁrst time in a number
J of years, was not represented by a basket—ball
team, the Athletic Committee refusing to sanction
one owing to lack of ﬁnances. Every member
of the splendid 1907 team was back in school
and with several star men in the Freshman class.
the ﬁve would probably have been the best that
ever represented the Blue and Gold. lt was on
this account that the decision of the Athletic
Committee met with much disapproval 011 the part of the stu-
dent body.

A series of inter—class games were arranged in the Col-
legiate and Engineering Department during the latter part of

 

January which proved very interesting. The Seniors dupli-
cated their feat of the 1907 season by winning the Depart-
mental championship. Their record totals three victories and
no defeats, the Juniors falling before them 24 to 13, the
Sophomores 27 to 23 and the Freshmen 47 to 18. The Sopho-
mores were the nearest contenders for first honors and gave
the Seniors a hard battle when they met. The defeat at the
hands of the Seniors was the Sophomores only set—back, they
downing the Freshmen 31 to 21 and the Juniors 34 to 18.
The Juniors and Freshmen with two defeats each to their
credit were to play off the tie for last place, but the Freshmen
forfeited, giving the Juniors third place.

Do You Know

why some Profs are profs and not dry goods clerks? No? V\’el1 get the next number and we’ll tell you.

“The Game Gets You,”

a new serial starting in our next issue. A number of articles aimed at our iniquitous system of holdup, practiced
every day within paper—wa(l distance of “Mother,” maternal and protecting; showing how the lambs march up to
be sheared, how excessively high rates on necessities of school life dissect the weekly allowance, leaving the
residence an object for microscopic examination.

Further, if the tax could be lifted, how one could again catch the delicate aroma of a Pall Mall, rather
than hear the hoarse call for “makins”—as now. '

“Alcoholism.”

The results of experiments tried on a large number of our subscribers (who needed neither persuasion or coer-
cion), are here told in attractive language. “Sparkling,” one critic writes. “Not a ‘dry’ spot in the book,"
another writes.

“Woman's Invasion.”

An article of great importance, dealing with the coming of the co—eds, and the resulting catalytic inﬂuence, chem-
ically speaking. In a rare style, and convincing manner, the writer tells how collars are now worn instead of
soft shirts, how books of etiquette are bought, marked, and perused at spare times, how the co—eds are monopo-

‘ lized and lionized by the student body in general.

Many amusing features are mentioned, as, the detection in the basement of a number of Sophomores
grouped about an upperclassman putting to him questions regarding good form, the ethics of paying her carfare,
etc.

How Thrift Makes $1.00 Grow

By One Who Knows

HE magazine “Success,” and numerous articles therein

by various Captains of Industry—to say nothing of
the speeches which these Eminent Succeeders deliver from
time to time to bodies of undergraduates on the subject “How
to Succeed" (the answer always being “Do as I do”)—this
magazine, those articles and speeches, we say, are no longer
necessary to the students of the University of Pittsburgh.
VVe refer the inquiring young student to a little treatise by
those Most Eminent, Gentlemanly, Pleasing, Successful and
“Business Shark" Professors. Beck and Conrad. It is con-
crete. The magazine articles and the addresses of the emi-
nent succeeders are abstract. The young man who wants
to succeed should read carefully the following. which is the
full revelation: '

F irst, _vou buy something for $100,000.00 and pay $1.00
down.

Then you make an increase from $300,000.00 to $15,-
ooo.ooo.0o in the capital stock.

Then you pay a (lividend of ﬁfty per cent.—in stock,
not cash. You pay it in stock, rather than in cash, for the
reason that cash is rigidly excluded from the deal as long
as you are managing it. The cash only begins to make
its appearance along with the other fellow.

231

About this time (owing to roseate newspaper reports.
which you of course cannot help) along the other fellow
comes. You sell him what you have at a great sacriﬁce—
say $8,301,496.38 CASH.

He takes it and examines it, and ﬁnds what he has.
Rather than make lemonade out of it. he decides that it
is too good to keep to himself. He will let somebody in
on it. He proceeds to organize a Syndicate to divide the
Good Thing up with, and stipulates that owing to the ex-
treme value of the Thing. it will not do to make the initial
or preliminary stock less than say $60.000.000.00, of which
one—half shall be stock and the other bonds. He agrees to
let his associates take the good thing. with one—half of the
stock, while he keeps the remaining half of the stock and
takes the bonds.

They then book some valuable orders, take in some
Eminent Succeeder. declare a dividend, and list the stock
and bonds on the New York Stock Exchange. All is now
practically complete, and we have a half-dozen new Captains
of Industry ready to buy a Diamond—Studded Air—Ship, a
Gold-Plated Automobile, order an Ancestral Tree and a Coat-
Of-Arms. and apply for an audience with the broker for
“Who’s Who in America" the next morning,

HOOK

Who’s Who—

With a Few Reasons

The Man With The Raven Locks

H me! Ah me. Why couldn’t it have been Abra~
ham Lincoln or George Washington Willock.
In spite of this handicap in name, Roy Leech has been
branded and saddled with Courant, Owl, Presidential and
Chairmanic crosses innumerable. His face is as lined as the
great emancipator’s, and his mien is almost as sober as that
of the father of his country. And his hair—-Oh! those jet
black tresses—is longer than that of either.
And just think, that if that Owl had been paid for,
some of the money might l1ave been circulated to a tonsorial
establishment.

*9‘

James Garfield Decker

A product of Uncle Sam’s Navy, passed around the
world innumerable times, then bought a meerschaum pipe at
Trieste, Hungary, and came to \\’. U. P.

Decker is a serious looking individual with a serious
purpose, but he has never divulged that purpose.

When not in class or fraternity house, can always be
found in the gym or on the track. Takes to the pole vault
quite naturally after his varied experience in “shoving-off”
at cutter drill and spearing walrus in Arctic seas.

232

William Josiah McCandless

The fellows call him “Bill.” Entered the University
possessed of the determination to rise——not necessarily early
you know, but to rise at any cost. He therefore set about
to do what he could, and behold the result; a basket-ball and
track man, chief rooter of the school an( “very close” to
the chancellor. And all this without being bor11 in a log
cabin, engaging in youthful railsplitting, or burning midnight
oil. But if that determination could have only been, to rise
early instead of “at any cost.”

1.1-;

Thomas Edwin Renton. Jr.

The catalogue gives seventeen years as the minimum
age for entrance, but there is just a faint suspicion that
Thomas Edwin broke the rule when he appeared in 1905
with a pair of newly creased long trousers, a winning smile,
and a rare quality of quietness.

“Tommy” still has the smile and the quietness, but those
creased trousers have long been discarded for many others
of equal creasiness. Also he has aged during these four
years and his ideas have changed, for ’tis said that his
interest in trousers has waned and millinery and housekeep-
ing now hold sway.

Nevertheless, Tommy still smiles, and keeps quiet, and
still wears creased trousers.

‘:5

Jerome Alexander Quay Boland

Boland, a product of Morganza, but not an inmate,
started wrong by preparing at W. & J. Academy, but had
the good sense to come to old W. U. P. for the ﬁnishing
touches.

Carried J‘. A. Q. around for three years, but the burden
became so irksome that he’s dropped the Q. in his Senior
year.

A most agreeable entertainer, an acknowledged author-
ity on the burlesque and the drama, and an astronomer of
repute.

Lawrence Westcott Roessing

Entered W. U. P. somewhere in the last century, and
after many years of wandering, has decided to graduate.
Roessing prides himself on his morals and has never been
known to go astray, so we are proud of him accordingly.
Larry is no ladies’ man, but once a girl loved him and then
moved away. He also stayed up all night once—Jbut only
to see the sunrise, fellows, only to see the sunrise.

Outside of those few accidents, Roessing is a good
fellow, and has highly developed the faculty of getting
through without much work.

233

George Malcolm Shaw

The only chemical to graudate in 1909 is the rarest
element of the Senior class. Not that he does not attend
classes—dilute the thought—but his Senior life seems to be
bounded by the classic walls of Science Hall, so we see him
seldom. Then, George is serious. Every day may mean
something new about Babbit metal; water may boil with
more bubbles than yesterday, or the fumes may even go up
the hood. Who knows?

Not George Malcolm, but he’ll be there to take notes
if it does happen. Who then can condemn the word “rare"
when applied to Freshman and Sophomore years that were
intimately associated with the “gym,” a Junior year that
united readily with the ladies; in combination with a Senior
year of “grim.”

The Hall of Fame

(I. C. W. Kincaid 1910, was once small enough to wear
short trousers.

(IL Reed Morrison Lewis remembers the time when he could
only say “goo.”

(ll, Catherine Elston, our accommodating librarian, once
invited a student out to meet her cousin. He went once.

(I. It is said by the friends of Carl Davis that he is very
fond of “blonde” chips.

THE HOOK

A MAGAZINE OF COMMENT

Published spasmodically at Pittsburgh, which is in Allegheny
County, Pennsylvania.

T is scarcely to be expected that a journal of comment
“ such as “The Hook” could long stand before the public
as a mirror of true thought, and as a great light dispelling the
darkness of superstitious reverence for dignity and intellectual
position which do not exist, without bringing down upon
that journal the enmity and opposition of multitudes. No
one ever loves an editor. The only friend we have is the
awﬁss cat, and she remains faithful simply as an act of good
policy. If it were not that she was, l)y a well aimed bottle.
empty, of course, recently widowed and left the mother of
four children, dependent upon us for sustentation and a
sheltering soap box, she, too, would pull stakes and betake
herself into the crule \vorld outside.

Though deeply touched by the fervent felieitations of
our many readers. we will continue to conscientiouslv put
forth “The Hook,” saying in the simplicity of our soul, just
what the spirit moves us to say. Still, if we would ask one
thing, it would be. that, no matter to what state of mind you
may be reduced through the perusal of these pages, you will.
in the language of our contemporary of “The \Vyoming
\Vhoop,” refrain from shooting at the editor unless you
mean it.

234

A SUGGESTION

Recognizing the advantages to be gained through the
introduction of an attractive form of service. and to the end
that the attendance upon religious exercises may be mate-
rially improved, The Hook would suggest the adoption of
the following ritual and order of service.

*5‘

THE. RITUAL

The Choosing of the One.

The College of the Elect shall in solemn Conclave as-
sembled, the Mother Superior presiding, choose One of their
number, ace high, to be the Minister of the Day, the Priest
of the Temple, pro tem.

The Processional.

At the time appointed, Frater Ferdinando shall intonate
with all sole1nnity,Maestoso sostenuto, a Tedium, at the first
notes of which our Holy Mother Superior shall proceed with
measured tread and slow, to the Chapel of Our Dreams.
Following shall come the Elect, in the order of their seniority,
Frater Francisco Phillipi, Frater Reidus Stewarto, and the
others in proper sequence.

Entering through the Great Portal, they shall, preceded
by two novices, chosen for personal pulchritude from among
the other novices, bearing aloft symbolic transparencies, move

235

in stately order down the central aisle, to group themselves
about the altar.

To the same motif. the classes shall, in order, marshalled :IhoeOK
by their respective ofﬁeial heads, move serenely to their desig-
nated positions, and at a signal, be seated.

RESPONSlVE READING.
The Minister and the People.

Minister——And in the beginning were the heaven and the
earth made.

Congregation——Verily, from this time forth it was said,
There is no Evolution.

Minister—And_ it seemed not good that Man should play
his hand alone.

Congregation—So, in those days, it came to pass that the
Co—ed was made to dwell upon the face of the earth,
and the earth smiled, and said, Yea, she is passing fair,
me for her.

The
HOOK

Minister——And Man called her names, saying, she shall be
called Woman, for she was taken out of Man.

Congregation——And from that time forth, she has proceeded
to take it out of Man.

Minister—Oh come let us sing and be exceeding glad; the
voice of the turtle is hard in the lab and the frogs
clap their hands.

Congregation—But the people lifted up their voices and
cried, Deliver us from the wrath of Mason, the Physicite,
and from Fetterman the Buggite, and lead us out of the
land of Analytics, and out of the land of the Philistines.

Minist'er—Be of good cheer, ye shall not all ﬂunk.

Congregation——Man is born to ﬂunk as the sparks ﬂy up-
ward.

Minister—How doth the Soph sit solitary, that was full of
joy! how is he cast dow11 that was as a right bower
among the picture cards.

Congregation——He weepeth sore in the night, his tears are
upon his cheeks; among all the maidens there is none
to comfort him.

Minister—What troubleth thee now, knowest thou not that
the way of a fool is right in his own eyes?

Congregation—For what shall it proﬁt a man if he pass all
else, and ﬂunk in Physical Lab.

Minister——One generation passeth away, and another genera-
tion cometh, but that ﬂunk endureth forever.

Congregation-—All things are full of labor, and behold all
is vanity and vexation of spirit.

236

Minister—Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein.

Congregation—But let us eat, drink and be merry. And
who can eat, or who else can hasten thereunto, more
than I?

Minister—To everything there is a season, and a time to
every purpose under the heaven.

Congregation—Yea, a time to embrace, and a time to re-
frain from embracing, but who is that time?

Minister~—There be three things which are too wonderful
for me, yea four which I know not: theiway of an
eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock;
the way of a ship in the winds of the sea; and the way
of a man with a maid.

Congregation—In his Fresh year it is like a green herb
which groweth up, as a succulent tomato vine, in his
Soph year it ﬂourisheth and groweth up; in his last
year, it is cut off and withereth.

Minister——The thought of foolishness is sin.

Congregation—Oh Mother, Dear Jerusalem ! we have sinned
against the Faculty, and in thy sight. From the wrath
to come, good Lord, deliver us.

Minister—Turn, turn, why will ye overdraw thy cuts.

Congregation—And he said, the college men have credits
enow and to spare. I will arise and goto Mother and
say, “As an engineer have I sinned against the Faculty,
and in thy sight, make me as one of thy college stu-
dents.” And he arose, and went to Mother. And she
saw him coming afar off, and ran to meet him and fell
on his neck, and he succumbed.

Minister——-I said in my wrath, all men were flunkers.

Congregation—How long, Oh dear, sweet, loving Faculty,
shall ye judge unjustly? How long shall thy hand be
raised against us? Selah.

Minister——The wrath of the Elect is spent. They shall
cause the sun of favor to shine upon you, and give you

peace. No good thing shall they let escape. Blessed

be those that do not get in wrong.

Congregation—Oh sing unto the Faculty a new song, for
they have done a marvelous thing. Make a joyful noise
unto the same, make a loud noise, for they have made
a noise, a new noise, a noise like the noise of the Grade
of A. Amen.

Book Reviews

“From a Tie to the Poet Laureate.”
By George Ma/za/fey Patterson. Baird.

This is what the author says of his own work.

“The most extraordinary book of the century. Nay, I
will take that back. ‘Ever.’ Hundreds of contemporary
writers, some of them passing fair (in my estimation) have
prepared slipshod, hastily written works, more or less vague.
incorrect, incoherent. and untrustworthy.

Here for the ﬁrst titre the reader will get a deﬁnite,
concise. and all embracing series of chapters upon the rise of
a small, but ambitious lad.”

“Janitors I Have Known.”
By Kafriiia.

Prompted by tender feelings and warmth of heart for
a greatly misunderstood and downtrodden people, this book
is now presented to the public. “Colored” at times, by in-
roads on the imagination and stock of adjectives of the writer.
this work is recommended to those whose emotions have
become oxidized, and to all who desire to become acquainted
with the life and habits of a race which is seldom observed
about the habitation of mankind.
