Dr. Alfred Leon Moye came to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh as an Assistant Professor
in Chemistry in 1968. He served in this capacity
until he became an Associate Professor of
Chemistry in 1971. He worked in Pitt’s Chem-
istry Department until 1972 when he shifted
to Schenley Hall and the University’s admini-
strative end. He was appointed Dean of Student
Affairs by Chancellor Posvar in January, 1972
and became Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs
in 1973 when the University revamped the
Student Affairs sector of University operations.
With the members of his staff (pictured above),
Dr. Moye feels responsible for improving the
climate and quality of campus life.

As Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, Dr.
Moye reports directly to the Chancellor and as
a member of his staff has the opportunity to
introduce matters which concern students at the
highest decision—making level.

Some of the offices responsible to Dr. Moye
are: Student Activities, Office of Residence
Life, Student Health Services, Campus
Judicial, New Student Programs, Off-Campus

.Housing, Office of Veterans»Affairs, University
Counseling Service, University Placement
Service, and the Office of International Student
Services. '

ln October of this year, Dr. Moye will take
a leave—of-absence, move to Washington, D.C.
and assume the position of Deputy Com-
missioner of the Bureau of Higher and Con-
tinuing Education in the Office of Education.
This is a newly formed bureau and an appointed
position under Cabinet Secretary Joseph
Califano’s Health, Education and Welfare
Department.

The OWL hopes Dr. Moye enjoys his new
responsibilities and employment in the nation’s
capital.

Dr. William Markus will be acting Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs in Dr. Moye’s
absence and will now be responsible for many
of the day to day decisions that affect a stu-
dent’s non—academic life.

Pitt Claims Number One Ranking After Defeat Of Army
   It was a beautiful day. The sky was
bright, and the air was warm. It was
Homecoming and the Panthers made it
a happy one by bombing Army, 37-7.
   However the biggest and best news
of the day came over the public
address system. "Final score: Purdue
16, Michigan 14."
  With that announcement Pitt
Stadium shook like it never shook
before. The fans went crazy, the
players went wild and everyone began
chanting, "We're number one."
  Another reason to cheer came when
Matt Cavanaugh entered the game.
However, many of the cheers had to
have been for Tom Yewcic, the little
known quarterback who saved the
season for the Panthers.
  Dorsett had another fine day gaining
212-yards in 33 carries. This gave him
two more records-his third 1500-yard
season and the all-purpose rushing
crown.
  Little known running back, Thom
Sindewald gained 64-yards on 10
carries.
  Highly touted Army quarterback,
Leamon Hall, had a tough day as he
threw several interceptions.
  Pitt jumped off to a 20-0 lead before
Army got on track and added 17
more points after Army scored its
first and only touchdown.
  The Panthers gained much more
than a victory, they gained a shot at
the National Championship and the
rest is history.
Matt prepares to execute the option.
From Top To Bottom: Homecoming Queen Natalie
Davis adds a touch of beauty to the Homecoming
festivities. Coach Majors and Matt Cavanaugh lead
the team onto the field. Tony Dorsett gets a brief
rest as the defense does their thing. Jim Corbett
grabs one of his 33 season catches. John Majors

Panthers Down Mountaineers on iRegional,T;V.

Playing Pitt is one of the most ex-
citing things West Virginia fans have
.to look forward to each Fall.

Expectations for a fine season melted
as the Mountaineers fell to Penn State
3.3-0. -
‘However, upsetting Pitt would more
than make up for West Virginia’s
dismal season.

The fireworks began even before
the game as Tony Dorsett taunted
the Mountaineers after the television
introductions. West Virginia would not
forget this incident.

Pitt was guilty of five turnovers, but -
West Virginia was guilty of not
capitalizing on the Panther miscues.

On its second series, Pitt march-ed
68-yards for a score. Dorsett went the
final 17-yards and Carson Long’s extra
point made him the all-time NCAA I
scoring leader. '

The game ended as it had begun—
with fireworks. Late in the game
Dorsett received his last of several
cheap shots. He came up swinging and
was ejected from the game, but not
before a major battle.

The Panthers won the game, 24-16,
but the fight was declared a draw.

Willard F. “Bud” Heaps came to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh on January 3 of this
year replacing’ Dan Meloro (and Nancy Evans
in the interim) as Director of Student
Activities.

Prior to his arrival, Bud was Director of the
College Union and Student Activities at the
State University of New York—Oswego. In
this capacity he was responsible for the opera-
tion, program and personnel of the college
union; providing outdoor programming and
scheduling; advising the student government;
directing a summer activities program; pre-
paring the departmental budget; serving as an
ex-officio head of the college alcoholic beverage
committee; and interpreting policies and regula-
tions as they concern all aspects of student
activities.

In short, Bud was Director of Student
Activities at S.U.N.Y.—Oswego.

As one of six line officers reporting to the
Vice-Chancellor of Student Activities, the
Director of Student Activities is responsible
for the planning and implementation of social,
cultural, educational and recreational pro-
grams and the administration of University
policy governing such events.

The Director supervises eight professional
staff members, and a large number of secre-
tarial, clerical and part—time student workers
who staff such diverse functions as the manage-
ment of the Student Union; coordination of the
extra-curricular program; advisorship of three
major student governments and over 100 stu-
dent organizations; the custodianship of the
Student Activities fees; and the coordination
of Greek Letter Societies.

Bud brings a number of years of experience
to Pitt and the OWL wishes him the best of
luck in his new position as Director of Stu-
dent Activities.

Pete Strickland tries to pass around a Duquesne defender.

Again it is Harris shooting against the Dukes. Ed Schueurmann had a fine season as Pitt's Freshman center.

 

The basketball team provided Panther fans with a few chances
to cheer this season, but not much else.

In fact, not much cheer at all was connected with Pitt Basket-
ball in the abnormally cold winter that started with some pre-
season optimism by Coach Tim Grgurich and came to a merciful
close with the team’s 21st loss.

Both team and coach were young. Only one senior was on the
squad, and he wasn’t high on the list of reserves. Three freshmen—
Sonny Lewis, Ed Scheuermann and Mike Rice——started more than
occasionally. There was no clear-cut leader on the squad, and at
times it showed.

The Coach, in his second year at the top after succeeding Buzz
Ridl, also was young. A Pitt point-guard in the ’60’s, Tim
Grgurich was enthusiastic almost to a fault.

In the absence of winning, the team did a great deal of learn-
ing. The freshmen assumed roles usually left to upperclassmen.
The older Panthers realized shortcomings and frustration, but had
gratifying moments.

Larry Harris had reason to expect more from the 1976-1977
season than any other Panther, and his statistics were more than
respectable. But while scoring 22.9 points per game, Harris
dodged pressures that adversely affected his performance. An early
season injury, suffered in a dunk attempt, cost him some
teeth (later repaired) and some confidence (repaired even
later). He spent much of the season attempting to fill the
on-court leader role thrust upon him by others.

But Harris used his fantastic talent to keep. Pitt close
and his last-second corner jump shot beat nationally ranked
Cincinnati at the Field House.

When properly motivated, Harris was capable of con-
trolling a game. A 6-6 shooter with agility, Harris could
leave Pitt as the school’s top all-time scorer.

citement and hope during many close

The schedule was tough—Maryland,

Syracuse, Notre Dame, Rutgers, and
West Virginia stood out. The combina-
tion of an experienced opponent, and
an unfriendly arena, a difficult-to-
learn defensive scheme and a

lack of experience often
worked against the Panthers
with devastating effect. /
Little of Pitt’s misfortune
was self-induced, however.

Harris, Lewis, Rice, Scheuer-

mann and Scott Nedrow were

major problems to Grgurich,

who had an inexperienced

Grgurich took much of the
season’s blame and deposited
it on his own shoulders; much
more than belonged there. But
a look to the future should be
sufficient stimulant, especially
for a young coach with a
young team and staff.

  Office of Residence Life
  The number one mission of the University's
Office of Residence Life (ORL) is to facilitate
the development of an enriching and full living
experience for its 3556 resident students. Living in a University Residence Hall is a unique
community experience providing more than
just room and board. The Residence Halls serve
as a living/learning community, integrating
the classroom learning, and personal development of each resident student.
  Helping promote these living/learning experiences, the Office of Residence Life has developed the Alternative Lifestyle Program
which combines different living arrangements,
academic involvement, and units with special
characteristics. An emphasis is placed on providing students a lifestyle commensurate with
their desires, interest, and self-responsibility.
  With a competent staff of 76 Resident Assistants and four Area Coordinators, residents
are encouraged to take an active role in the
development of their own living/learning
community.
  The University Residence Halls, provide
many alternatives in room accommodations in
order to fit the individual desires and needs
of the resident students. There are eight
residence halls, six of which are coed. The
Residence Hall complex is divided into three
main areas: The Litchfield Towers, The Schenley Quadrangle, and the Lothrop Street
Residence.
  The Director of the office of Residence Life
is Fred Fonseca.
 

The Pantherette Basketball team
proved to be one of the most success-
ful in the team’s history.

A 19-8 record and a trip to Eastern
Regionals highlighted the 1976-77
season.

It was not, however, a season without
problems and controversy. Shortly
after the team returned from Re-
gionals, Head Coach Pat Wallace
learned that she had been relieved
of her duties as coach by Women’s
Athletic Director, Sandy Bullman. It
marked the second time in as many
years that the women’s head basket-
ball coach was fired. Jean Condo was
fired before the 1975-76 season began ~
and Wallace took over at that time.

Wallace’s only comment alluded to
the fact that her team was much more
successful than the men’s team, yet
their coach remained.

Despite the problems, the Panther-
ettes managed to overcome the ad-
versity that plagued them all season.

Freshman Wanda Randolph from
Yonkers, New York, and Sophomore
Barb Welsh from McKees Rocks were
the biggest contributors to the Panther-
ette success.

Randolph lead all scorers with an
average 21.1 points per game. In
addition, she was the leading Panther-
ette rebounder with 15.5 rebounds per
game.

She also achieved notoriety with a
free throw percentage of .844—the
highest in the East.

In addition, Kathy Paczkowski,
Diane Zaken, Kim Raymond, MiMi
Senkowski and Kit Loeffler helped
Pitt to average 77-points per game,
and to acheive its most successful
season in history.

Running every match on unfamiliar
courses, the Men’s Cross—Country
team hussled to win two of its four
duel meets.

Nort McDonald and Terry Wile
both had fine season’s, but this
year Mel Boyd grabbed all the head-
lines as he ran quietly over, around,
under and through most of his
opponents.

For such a fine season Mel was
awarded by being able to partici-
pate at the NCAA finals in Texas.

In addition to Pitt’s two dual meet
victories, the Panthers finished second
in the California State Invitational and
seventh in the Central Collegiate Con-
ference Meet.

Next year should be even better as
the Panthers will run all seven of
their meets at home in Schenley Park.

Cross-Country was another sport
new to the women’s athletic program.
Under the tutoring of Head Coach
Alfreeda Goff, the Pantherettes ran to
a successful season.

During the season that included four
invitationals and a dual meet with
Slippery Rock, two Pantherettes stood
out as outstanding performers.

Becky Falck, a freshman from North
Hills and Brenda Chorpenning from
Wheeling, West Virginia (also a
freshman) were the top scorers for
the Pantherettes. Both women quali-
fied to compete in the Eastern
Championships at Albany, New York,
and both did exceptionally well.
Falck finished ninth and Chorpenning
placed 37th.

With the whole squad returning,
next year’s team expects to im-
prove on this year’s duel and invi-
tational records.

This is often the sight a runner sees as she sets out on the long run.

A .500 record for a season is not
too impressive. However, when one
considers that it was the team’s ini-
tial year of competition without any
scholarship players, one is likely to
be impressed.

Such was the situation with Jan
McDowell’s Field Hockey team of this
year.

The team compiled a record of 4-4
which included defeats of several
established teams.

Ten girls played well enough to win
letters, even though only six of them
had previous field hockey experience.

Leo Bemis’ Pitt Soccer team suf—_

fered_ from a scoring drought this
season.

The Panthers managed to score
but 10 goals in 13 games as they
plummeted to a 4-7-2 record.

Ironically, Pitt scored no goals in
its best game of the season. Bemis’
Booters tied NCAA division #1
pick, Penn State, 0-0. Bemis called
it the high point of the season.

Needless to say, Pitt’s defense was
outstanding throughout the season,
four of the Panthers seven losses were
by two goals or less.

Like many other teams in Pitt’s-

athletic program, the Soccer team is
a young team with many freshmen.

Although the Panthers will be
slightly hampered next year with the
phasing out of the junior varsity
program, the team participated in
its first indoor season.

The Booters participated in seven
tournaments and won the Grove City
Tournament. In that tournament,
the Panthers defeated two teams
that had beaten them during the
regular season.

For this year’s Pantherette Volley-
ball team, the cofnbiifationiwas perfect
—a wealth of raw, young talent and
two of the most talented and success-
ful coaches in the area to cultivate
that talent.

This combination became a winning
one for Pitt in 1976.

Mike Herbert and Rich Schall both
fine players as well as coaches com-
bined to lead the Pantherettes to a
record of 23-3 against superior power
volleyball competition.

The team was anchored by MVP
Cindy Chambers. Her strong hitting
and stingy blocking made her a team
leader offensively and defensively.

Freshmen setters Mary Savage and
Mary Lou Susang were outstanding
in initiating the offense.

Another Freshman standout was
Andi Pletz. Pletz, from Stow, Ohio
was also a fine offensive and de-
fensive player.

The biggest surprise of the year
was Senior Kathy Hudgens. She had
seen little action in her first two years,
but this year she played so well that
she was named team captain.

Hebert also credited Pat Mont-
gomery, Diane Zaken, Sue Hershel-
man, and Cindy Frye as being integral
components to the Pantherettes success
that netted them a fourth place finish
in Eastern Regionals.

However, the Panthers bounced back to
win the Cornell Invitational which in-
cluded a 32-10 thrashing of LaSalle. In
addition, Pitt captured the Bucknell
Tournament by defeating Fordham, Cornell,
Syracuse and Bucknell.

Leading scorer, Luis Toro and the team’s
goalie and only senior, Walter Young led
the Panthers to victories over Army, Yale,
Brown and Bucknell to win the Eastern
Championships.

Although Pitt did fare well at Nationals,
the young Panthers including Mike Mere,

hope to take another shot at the national
title next season.

Georgia Peanut

On November 2, 1976, James Earl Carter, Jr., a Georgia
peanut farmer, was elected the 39th President of the United

After a number of early primary wins, Ronald Reagan tuned up
his campaign and raced Ford down the stretch. The GOP nom-
ination became a tossup. So a couple of days before the GOP
Convention in Kansas City, Ronald Reagan gambled and chose
a Vice President to round out his ticket, Pennsylvania’s liberal

Senator Richard Schweiker. The stalemate was broken and Ford

won the Republican nomination by 60 delegates.

Ford chose Iowa’s Robert Dole after failing to convince
Reagan to round out the ticket and in his Republican Acceptance
Speech (being fully aware of Jimmy Carter’s lead in the opinion
polls) challenged Carter to a series of Presidential Debates, an
unpresidented move by an incumbant President.

The Economy, candidate characters, foreign policy, and the
desirability for change became the basic issues. But the situation
was ideally suited for Jimmy Carter, a Washington unknown
with little political experience (one term as Georgia Governor).

In the end, Gerald Ford was credited with restoring public
trust and conﬁdence to the White House, while Carter’s lack-'
luster campaign was credited with dissipating one of the largest
leads ever held by a Presidential Candidate.

Jimmy Carter just responded, “The only reason it was so close
was that the candidate wasn’t good enough as a campaigner. But
he'll make up for that as President.”

On January 20, 1977 Jimmy Carter, a Georgia peanut farmer
became the 39th President of the United States of America.

Jimmy Carter appears to be watching the election returns.

Success on the ice was somewhat
overshadowed by revolts, and sus-
pensions of players as well as lack
of funding for this year’s Hockey
Club.

Coach Len Barcalow’s Icers skated
to a 12-5-l record which boosted Pitt’s
four-year record to 59-17-5, one of the
most successful in the school.

However, the problems began after
the second game of the season
when captain Rich Vernon and
Scott Kimmick were suspended for
insubordination.

Although Vernon and Kimmick,
who combined for 71 points last year,’
were gone, the Panthers managed to
keep winning with a new attitude
toward the game.

Pitt captured its own invitational
with a goal by Tom Sherwin at
18:39 of the third period to defeat
Ohio University 3-2 in the finals.

Other impressive wins during
the season came as Pitt defeated
Duquesne 10-], Navy 9-3, and
Gannon 10-6.

The Panthers ended the season by
splitting a weekend series with Ohio
University, winning the first game
8-2 then losing 6-1.

In addition to losing Vernon and
Kimmick for next season, Pitt will
lose defenseman Bob Arturo to
graduation as well as Bud Connelly
and Don Deltondo who quit last
season and will not be returning.

But don’t count on the Pitt Hockey
Club for a losing season. Coach Len
Barcalow has etched a winning at-
titude into the minds of his players
whose talent does the rest.

A young, talented team, plus a very
successful season, adds up to a promis-
ing future for the Pantherette
Gymnastic team.

Despite an unimpressive record of
4-3, Coach Donna DeMarino noted
that two of the losses came to the
number one and number three teams
in the East.

“We performed much better,” she
said, “against the tough competition.”
Included in the list of impressive
accomplishments was a first place
finish at the Pennsylvania State
Championship, as well as scoring a
team record of 132.1 points against
Lock Haven.

The only Pantherette senior, Diane
Baumgartner, won the Panther Award
as the top woman scholar-athlete at
Pitt.

Regina Carson, a freshman from
Belle Vernon, was named MVP for
her outstanding performance through-
out the season. Carson placed first in
the all-around at the State Champion-
ship meet and ninth in vaulting at
Regionals.

Alison Hoburg, also a freshman
from Hampton High School, placed
second in the all-around competi-
tion at the State meet, 12th on the
unevens at Regionals and was an
all-around qualifier for the USGF
Regional Championships.

It was an unusual year, to say the
least, for the Panther gymnastic
squad.

Playing an abbreviated schedule with
a new head coach failed to uhnerve the
squad as they achieved a winning
record.

Senior Rob Pasterick was one of the
leading performers for a squad that
defeated Navy and Slippery Rock.

The Panthers only two losses of the
season came at the hands of
Temple and Penn State, two Eastern
Powerhouses.

This year’s team was basically a
young one, but it was also one with a
great deal of talent and potential.

The relative success of this year’s
squad should be heightened next year
with so many fine young gymnasts
returning.

Facing some of the stiffest compe-
tition in the East, the Panther
Tankers proved to be equal to the
challenge.

Not only did they compile a rec-
ord of 7-2, but they also managed
a first place finish at Eastern
Regionals.

Jerry DeMuro, Tom Dowd, and
diver Tom Fatyol achieved the
status of All-American at Eastern
Regionals.

However, John Schepner and
diver Dave Reeder also had out-
standing seasons.

But for Coach Bradshaw’s tank-

ers, this season was a team effort.

Despite heartbreakingly close
losses to Ohio State and Maryland,
the Panthers rebounded to over-
whelm West Virginia, Cleveland
State and Youngstown State.

Other outstanding accomplish-
ments included Mark Schuman’s
record shattering performance in
the 100-yard butterfly.

It was a super season for the
swimmers and one to cherish.

This year’s Pantherette Swim
team was young, talented and
full of potential.

Head Coach Kate Mathison
deftly guided her swimmers to a
record of 5-1, and she did so with
an extremely powerful team.

However, when one mentions the
womcn’s swm team, one inevit-
ably thinks of Kathy Stetler.
Stetler’s long list of accomplish-
ments, which includes a birth at
the 1976 Olympic Trials, is long
and impressive. Once again, she
achieved the status of All—American.

The humble Stetler is quick to
point out the accomplishments of
her teammates.

Jennifer Price, Nila DeJesus,
Sue Guyer, Diane Kluglein, Jamie
Conley, Debbie Schloder and Sandy
Moran also had outstanding seasons
including qualifying for Nationals.

Nagging injuries turned into one
big headache for Pitt Wrestling Coach
Dave Adams and his Grapplers.

After winning its first five matches
and achieving ranking of 18th Na-
tionally, the Panthers lost 6 of
their next 7 matches primarily due
to injuries.

The injuries gave eight freshmen the
opportunity to gain valuable experi-
ence for the future.

In fact, only one wrestler will be
leaving and every letter winner will
be returning.

Seniors Rande Stottlemyer, Bill
Bailey, Mark Stepanovich and‘ Skip
Bolin were the leading Panther
Grapplers.

Stottlemyer who missed most of
last season because of an injury was
EWL Champ at 139 pounds, in
1975-76 and was red shirted for one
season.

Bailey was EWL Runner-up at
190 pounds and defending champion
from the 1975-76 season.

Stepanovich was the EWL Champ
as a heavyweight and Bolin was EWL
Champ at 167 pounds. He was un-
defeated in the EWL Tournament.

Coach Adams hopes that these
wrestlers will serve as the nucleus
for his young team that includes
several fine recruits.

Barring any injuries, Pitt’s Mat-
men can expect a very successful
season next year.

Tragedy struck the Pitt Campus on Thurs_day,
January 20. 1977 with an explosion in Langley Hall,
The explosion knocked apart lecture hall 221 and sent
the dividing wall into adjacent lecture hall 223. The
ceiling immediately collapsed. Fortunately no class
was in session in 221 , but an Animal Psychology lecture
was taking place in 223.

An eyewitness in room 223 recalled the events clearly.
“I heard a rumbling noise behind me and turned to see
the walls coming down. Students fled in all directions.
It was horrible!”

Between 150-160 students were present in the specific
area ofthe explosion. Most made it out unscathed, but
49 were injured, and two died, Carleen Curry—a Project
Right—Start secretary, and Patricia Hostetler, a student
from Donegal, Pa.

No fire accompanied the blast, but rescue crews and
twelve fire companies were at the scene soon after the
12:40 PM explosion. Heavy cranes, power saws, and
acetylene torches had to be used to remove the few
trapped victims from the ruins. Nine of the firemen
were treated at area hospitals as a result of methane
and nitrobenzene gas inhalation.

Throughout the day, hundreds of Pitt, students and
Oakland residents responded to the request for blood
by nearby blood banks. There was such a surplus of
volunteers that many had to be bused downtown because
of congestion at Oakland facilities.

Clergymen of all denominations offered services for
the dead and injured throughout the Pittsburgh area
and a special Memorial Service was held Monday,
January 24, 1977 in Heinz Chapel for Carleen Curry
and Patricia Hostetler.

Though the cause of the blast has yet to be deter-
mined, the theory of gas has come to be the most ac-
cepted reason for the explosion.

The Pitt Golf Team didn’t make
much noise this season.

The team played several matches in
the Fall and the remainder in the
Spring.

Unlike some of Pitt’s other var-
sity teams, the Golfers had no All-
Americans and no tournament vic-
tories. In fact, Coach Steve Petro’s
team had no scholarship players and
they failed to win a match.

Team Captain and last year’s Most
Valuable Player Bill Burkardt missed
most of the Spring season with viral
ulcers.

Without an experienced leader, the
pressure fell on the shoulders of two
Freshmen—Jim McGrath and Alan
English.

Both players handled the circum-
stances quite well. McGrath finished
as Pitt’s medalist on three ocassions.

In addition, Devin McCarthy, and
Bob Mauro had fine seasons.

Despite the Panthers’ dismal season
and the fact that they do not recruit,
Pitt’s future in golf is not as cloudy
as one might think. The younger
players are gaining vital experience
and thus the team is building for the
future.

Despite a 6-6 season record, George
Dieffenbach’s Netters captured the
prestigious Saranac Cup Invitational
on February 26 to make their season.

In addition the Panthers toured the
South in late March on a five-day trip,
but failed to register a win.

However this trip gave Pitt an edge
in its first several matches as the
Panthers defeated four straight
opponents including Akron and Slip-
pery Rock who had beaten Pitt last
year.

The Panthers were up one day and
down the next in mid season and
wound up losing their final two
matches. Pitt was thumped by Cin-
cinnati 9-0 and Washington and Lee
University 8-1.

One of the brightest spots of this
year’s team was Freshman Tom
Leibenguth. Leibenguth battled with
Senior Mike Habbel for the number
one spot on the team. Habbel’s twin
brother, Harry also had a fine season.

In addition to Leibenguth, Coach
Dieffenbach will welcome Sophomore
Tom Gault, Freshman John Ginty,
and Kevin Quay back for another
season. Each of these players show
great promise for the future.

The Panthers play a brief Fall
schedule as a warm—up for an ex-
tended Spring schedule.

Next year’s Netter squad is ex-
pected to be one of the finest in
Pitt’s history.

Sophomore sensation, Maria Paris,
compiled a record of 9-2 in singles
competition and was undefeated in
Saranac Cup play as she led the
Pantherette Netters to a winning
season.

Paris combined with this season’s
MVP, Janet DeCostro, to go unde-
feated in doubles competition. In
addition, DeCostro was 10-1 in singles
competition.

Although the Pantherettes managed
only a 6-5 record during the season,
the team placed sixth in the Eastern
field of 43 teams. Paris finished
seventh in the East while DeCostro
placed 20.

Coach Nancy Gordon notes that
four of the Pantherettes five losses
came at the hands of top-notch
competition.

The Pantherettes can also take
consolation in the fact that most of
this year’s team will be returning
next year.

Mel Boyd and Dan Goodyear ran
and jumped themselves as well as the
Panther track team to fame this
season.

Boyd qualified for the NCAA meet
in the 5000 meter run while Goodyear
qualified in the high jump. Goodyear
reached an incredible height of
7' 1”.

Coach Mike Agostinella’s Harriers
ran to a 4-1 record during the indoor
and outdoor seasons. The four wins
included wins over Slippery Rock and
Cornell, two Eastern track powers.

Seniors Dan Shirley, Terry ‘Wile
and Willie Walker provided team
leadership both on the track and on
the field. Each of the three were
integral components to Pitt‘s success-
ful season according to Agostinella.

Pitt participated in a number of in-
vitationals during the season including
a 7th place finish at the Slst
Annual Central Collegiate Conference
Championships.

After a fine season, Agostinella
is looking forward to 1978.

her performance this season.

Shaw, a sprinter—jumper with the
Pantherettes, did so well that she
was named MVP for the season.

Juniors Marie Ribik and Karen
Krichko also had impressive seasons.
Ribik twice qualified for the AIAW

WPCH Radio is a student run
organization designed to provide
students interested in broadcasting
with an opportunity to gain experi-
ence through participation. We
broadcast into the dormitories to
provide resident students with
special student-oriented information
and entertainment. We also provide
an outlet for students who do this
for fun. The number of active
members in WPGH for the past
year was about 50. WPCH provides
campus news and sports coverage
which students can not find any-
where else.

"71 Years Of Collegiate Journalism”

The Pitt News is a student operation pub-
lished three times a week during the Fall and
Winter terms, twice a week during the Spring
term, and once a week during the Summer
months.

Each issue carries campus, local, and national
news, in addition to features, book and movie
reviews, editorials, sports, want ads, personal
ads (remember Brad and Leslie), and the ever
popular “Fuzzy Weeks” comic strip.

Regular issues to look forward to are: the
Orientation Issue, April Fools Issue and the
Bayard Street Fraternity Issues.

While the actual printing is done by an
outside firm, the Pitt News production is
strictly student oriented. From the sale of
ads to reporting, photography to typesetting,
and right down to the paste-up, students are
responsible for the work.

Backspace is a student run literary magazine which
publishes poetry, prose, and non-fiction written at the
University of Pittsburgh. The purpose of the organization
is to provide a place for Pitt writers to publish their work
and to give the University and community a chance to
examine and enjoy its writers’ accomplishments. The circu-
lation of the magazine is 2,000 copies per year. The office
is located in Room 405 Schenley Hall. Founded, January 6,
1976, it is an out growth of the now defunct Ideas & Figures
publication.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT BOARD

]anuary—December 1976

Consisting of six elected, full-time undergraduates and a voting President, this year’s SGB had a dif-
ficult year from the outset. At first Joe Gronski was elected President by 32 votes until voting machine
irregularities were seen. It seemed two voting machines in the Student Union Art Gallery had slips
of paper covering presidential candidate Barry Weisband’s name. Weisband contested to the Elec-
tions Committee and won the appeal of a second SGB Presidential Election. Gronski appealed this
decision to the Student Government Judicial Board who upheld the decision of the Elections Com-
mittee. Weisband went on to defeat Gronski by 96 of the 1,840 total votes cast. Two days after in-
augurated Sue Turner resigned for “personal family reasons” resulting in a Board vacancy. Applica-
tions were made to the new SGB and they selected Gary Tweed to fill this vacancy. These troubles
were just the beginning: Allocations problems turned into Programming problems, which turned into
tuition hike problems, which turned into a mid-November protest by 150 members of the Black
Action Society in the Student Government Office——SGB members and . Student Affairs personnel were
“detained” for three-heated hours.

A year of controversy to say the least.

Allocations Committee

The Allocations Committee is an important
Student Government Board committee in that it
allocates for Student Government Board approval our
$298,000 in student activity fees. While organizational
costs continue to climb, ’the Allocations Committee
“enjoys” the unpleasant assignment of trimming all
organizational costs to adhere to the $298,000 limit. A
difficult task to say the least.

“The Student Union Board (S.U.B.) is an administratively sponsored and
funded organization that is responsible for programming major and minor
events of an educational, cultural, and social nature for the University com-
munity. It represents the University’s commitment of providing informal
educational experiences outside of the classroom; experiences that enrich,
entertain, and educate." _

The Board is divided into three working committees, Public Affairs,
Social, and the Arts. The Public Affairs Committee is responsible for
bringing speakers, workshops, forums, and symposia to the campus. All
planned events seek to emphasize the educational and informative
component of the extra-curricular programing effort. The Social Committee
seeks to plan events that are more recreational and entertaining in nature.
Participatory events are the backbone of this committee, with additional
programs designed to utilize the students’ leisure time on campus. The
Committee on the Arts seeks to strengthen the “Arts” by providing
impetus for new and varied art forms on our University campus.

Getting people involved is what we are all about. We do this
by providing entertainment, listening to, getting things done
for, and protecting the interests of Pitt dormitory dwellers.
Who are we? Why, the Resident Student Organization, of

the Administration of the School. It also establishes lines of
communication within the School itself, as well as the entire
University community. An annual project of NSO is the
sponsorship of a career seminar with representatives
gathered from universities and hospitals throughout the
country. Social events, such as a banquet given by the ]unior

‘ization on the University of Pittsburgh Campus. Since its

The Pitt Glee Club is the oldest non—athletic student organ~

inception in 1890, the Pitt Glee Club has been involved in
performing the finest music available for tenor and bass
voices.

The Club rehearses four hours per week to prepare their
varied repertoire for several home concerts and three annual
tours. The hard work of preparation and the satisfaction of
fine performances combine to create a close fraternalism among
the members.

Touring has been an integral part of the Glee Club since the
early part of the 20th century. Through this touring, the Glee
Club’s reputation of musical excellence has been spread
throughout the Eastern and Southern United States, Southern
California, Mexico, and Western Europe. These opportunities
to represent Pitt outside the University community has instilled
a deep sense of pride for the Alma Mater in over 1,000 alumni.

During May of 1976, the club toured England, France, and
Italy. Highlighting concerts included performances in Stratford-
on-Avon, Canterbury Cathedral, the High Mass in Notre Dame
de Paris, St. Mark’s Cathedral, St. Peter's Basilica, and Gaeta,
the home port of the United States Navy’s Sixth Fleet.

The 1976-1977 school year performances included: Parents’
Weekend, Lantern Night, the Governor’s Concert Season in
Harrisburg, Wilson College—Chambersburg, Pa., Beaver
College——Cheltenham, Pa., Mozart’s Requiem in the fall, the
Cadet Chapel, United States Military Academy—West Point,
Ladycliff College—Highland Falls, N.Y.

The Glee Club’s repertoire appeals to all!

Lambda Sigma was created when the Civil Rights
Act and Title IX forced the organization Cwens to go
co-ed. Cwens had been a sophomore women’s honor
society, but Lambda Sigma is open to male sophomores,
too.

Lambda Sigma’s (Greek for “leadership and scholar-
ship") purpose is the same as Cwens’, that is, to serve
a variety of needs of the University of Pittsburgh and
the community. Members work on charitable projects
such as the Halloween party for the Children’s
Hospital and help at University functions as freshmen
orientation.

Members are selected on the basis of leadership,
grade point average, ability, interest in Lambda
Sigma, and extra-curricular activities. Lambda Sigma,
in turn provides training for leadership and the chance
to serve the University. It is through this service
that Lambda Sigma will seek to become an active
and worthwhile successor to Cwens as a part of the
University of Pittsburgh, where Cwens itself was
started.

of leadership in interfraternity activities, to
encourage them to continue along this line, and
to inspire others to strive for similar conspicuous
attainment; To bring together outstanding frater-
nity men to create an organization which will
help to mold the sentiment of the institution
on questions of local and intercollegiate fraternity
affairs; To bring together members of the faculty,

Night, co-sponsors at the Book Exchange, par-
ticipation in charity walk-a-thons, and arrang-
ing parties for children at schools for the blind
and deaf.

“Unity in Service” is our motto, and we work
together to satisfy the needs of members, fellow
students, and the community.

Alpha Phi Omega is the National Service Fraternity founded in
1925. Beta Chapter, founded at Pitt in 1927, recently celebrated
its fiftieth anniversary. With foundations in the principles of
leadership, friendship, and service, the Pitt Chapter is deeply
involved in providing the University and community with man-
power for worthy projects.

The major project of the group is the semi-annual Book Ex-
change held at the beginning of each term in the Student Union
Venetian Room. Members of the University community bring
books they wish to sell and quote a price. The editions are then
displayed according to subject and interested buyers may purchase
books of their choice for the stated price, plus a one dime service
fee (which is donated to charity).

Other servcies provided by the chapter include: keeping score
each week for blind bowlers, checking coats at official University
functions, distributing a student desk blotter, answering WQED
telephones at pledge periods, and raising money for Autistic
Children.

The Chapter encourages brothers to participate actively in
other campus organizations as a means of developing leadership
potential. We welcome interested people who share our ideals to
]O1n.

292 / Service

Students have found Book Exchange prices to be much better than those offered by neighboring book dealers. Books are displayed by subject.

Jaonoz §'*X=‘

This Senior Section of the 1977 OWL has enabled us to observe some of the Class of 1977 while taking a brief stroll
through the Pitt Campus. Many of these students, as these structures, we might never have noticed. Many of these stu-
dents, as these structures, we might not have known the names of. Many of these students we might never see again, but
as we leave we now have the opportunity to match THAT face with THAT name, just as we can match THAT building
with THAT name. ’ —

Most of us graduates will return, and when we do we won’t see many of these faces, but we will see these structures.
Hopefully these structures will bring back memories of 1976-1977: Pitt Stadium——the National Collegiate Football
Championship, Hillman Library—the night before that Chemistry exam, and the Chemistry Building where we failed
that Chemistry exam.

For some, Pitt might have been easy; for others, difficult. For some Pitt provided the basis for future schooling; for
others, the termination of schooling altogether. It was all worth it. It was an investment. Pitt helped form the foundation
for tomorrow. The rest depends on us. At Pitt each of us earned a degree and more importantly an education. It is now up
to us to do something “with all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities pertaining there to. ” Good luck!

Commencement
       April 24, 1977
  It was a cool, rainy Sunday afternoon when some
6,300 degrees were confered in Pittsburgh's Civic
Arena. Three speakers addressed those assembled on
the topic of energy: Paul Y. Hammond, of Pitt's
School of Engineering; William E. Wallace, Pitt's
Distinguished Service Professor of Chemistry; and
William A. Morrill, a chief cog in President Carter's
national energy program and senior member of
James Schlesinger's White House energy and policy
planning staff.
  Dr. Morrill stressed, "by developing renewable
and essentially inexhaustible resources of energy and
through conservation, the keystone of this energy
program, we can maintain a healthy economy, protect the environment, and conserve petroleum, by
making use of abundant fuels, as coal"
  Such goals are achievable if "th entire socie~y
joins around the goals and adheres to them." "After
all our survival is at stake!"

Lantern Night

Lantern Night is a ceremony where the student women of‘

the University of Pittsburgh welcome the freshmen women to
Pitt. Lantern Night is a 55 year old tradition, and may be
the oldest annual tradition on campus.

This year the Panhellenic Association sponsored the
ceremony, which in the past had been arranged by the Pitt
Women Alumnae.

The lanterns used in the ceremony are reproductions of
those used for studying by the first Pitt students.

In the first part of the ceremony, the lanterns, which
represent inspiration from the alumnae, are given to the
freshmen women. Upperclass women symbolically share their
hope for the future by lighting the lanterns during the latter
part.

Lantern Night is just one of the many ceremonies used to
welcome freshmen women to the University.

 

Various participants await the commencement of Lantern Night.

Wes and Mildred Posvar welcomed freshmen parents.

Parents Weekend

Parents Weekend is an annual event at the University of
Pittsburgh. Sponsored by the Interfraternity Council and
the Panhellenic Association, this Weekend is organized to
better acquaint freshmen parents to the various academic
and social aspects of the University.

At Friday’s Chancellor’s Reception, parents were able to
meet Chancellor Posvar, various administrators, and faculty
members. Entertainment was provided by the Glee Club and
Pitt Greeks. Many parents then toured the Nationality
Rooms with members of Quo Vadis.

Saturday morning was “Open House” for all Schools in
the University, after which a Hungry Panther Brunch was
served. Pitt beat the University of Miami Hurricanes in
football, 36-19, and a post-game “Ragtime Entertainment"
wrapped up the Weekend.

SGB Meeting

Campus police broke up a demonstration in the Student
Government Office of some 150 members of the Black
Action Society and a few members of the Collective for an
Alternative Education (CAE) on the night of Wednesday,
November 17, 1976.

Toting placards and yelling protest chants BAS and CAE
members crambed into 305 Schenley Hall where they waited
to present the Board a series of wide-ranging demands.
After Student Government Board President Barry Weisband
suggested the proposals be placed on the agenda under new
business, BAS members became adament and demanded the
Board listen to a lengthy series of demands. As the pro-
testors chanted and stuck their placards on the walls,
BAS Co-Chairman Doug Guy read a list of 10 grievances
and BAS demands covering the areas of: South Africa,
Campus Police, the Dorms, the Community, Admissions
Imbalance, on-campus Black Functions, Remunerations,
Black Studies, Student Government, and Tuition Hikes.
The protesters then detained the Board, other students, and
a handful of administrators for some two-plus hours.

The protest prompted Dr. Moye, Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs to say, “The demands were far beyond the
capabilities of SGB to deal with and you must ask the question
of what is really bothering these young people.”

SGB President Barry Weisband listened as the demands were read,

PAUL NYDEN:

He took the money and ran.

Former assistant sociology professor Paul Nyden and
the University wrote the last chapter of their 18-month
tenure confrontation on August 30, 1977. On this date,
Nyden and the University agreed to an out-of-court
financial settlement of $50,000.

Thus ended the court battles, the protests before the
Board of Trustees, the taking over of the Chancellor’s
office, the “principle,” et al.

Nyden’s fight with the University began in March
1976 when the Sociology Department recommended his
contract not be renewed. Nyden took his appeal for a
contract renewal through University channels, to the
students, who formed the Committee to Defend Paul
Nyden (and YusefAli), and concluded with a review from
a University Senate Council panel.

This final panel found a procedural flaw in Paul Nyden’s
tenure review and recommended another three—year
appointment. As Chancellor Posvar promised, he followed
the panel’s recommendation, but offered a 15-month
appointment. *

However, Nyden’s acceptance letter listed such a large
amount of objections and protests. University lawyers
concluded that ‘Nyden’s acceptance letter did not con-
stitute a legal acceptance of the offer.

Nyden filed suit in federal court over this most recent
contract’s non-renewal. Soon after this action, Nyden and
the University abandoned their “principles" and agreed
to an out-of—court settlement.

Remember Paul Nyden: He took the money and ran.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT
JOHNSTOWN

The 1976-1977 year at the University of Pittsburgh at Johns-
town was a unique experience for the students in this woodland
wonderland. The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown has
recognized that students have special needs in academics, special
campus events, athletics and numerous diverse individual interests.
UPJ tries to provide the variety of special services that students
have expressed an interest in.

7 But, the year was an exciting one with UP] and their students
making some impressive advancements. The Programming Board
was its usual outstanding self. UPJ students were fortunate to
have some big name concerts: Hall and Oates, The Atlantic
Rhythm Section, and Charlie Daniels come to visit our mountain
top campus, Other important speakers and films were available
to our normally active student body.

How could the students ever forget the great year in athletics
the campus Mountain Cats had. The rapidly growing athletic
program on campus has produced some great teams. An unbeaten
Women’s Basketball Team, a Championship Men’s Basketball
Team and a Cross Country team which could run almost anyone
under.

The social lifejust never seems to be lacking. The close knit student body always finds some time in their busy schedule for fun, rest, and relaxation.

The University of Pittsbursgh at Titusville, located at the
former McKinney Estate, is an atmosphere of personalized
instruction in a wooded, residential setting. McKinney Hall
houses classrooms, administrative offices and the campus book-

ties for both biology and chemistry.

A student center offers a homey atmosphere for television
and record playing. There is also a snack bar, pool and tennis
tables.

Outside of the campus, students may enjoy the recreational
and entertainment advantages of the surrounding community
such as four parks, two golf courses, ski slopes, a hunting
and fishing preserve and lakes for boating and swimming. There
is also a wide range of urban cultural pursuits sponsored by the
Titusville Council of Arts, such as film, drama and dance.

This kind of small college familiarity and personalized en-
vironment blends well with the larger university aspects of
Pitt’s Titusville campus.

The University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg is one of the

about 30 miles from the Oakland campus. Regular public
transportation routes connect the two centers, making it
easy for students at Greensburg to utilize fully the re-
sources of the large urban campus, while protecting the
personal nature of the academic experience.

May 17, 1977 marked a significant day in the History of
UPG. On this date the Science Building, a $2,542,399.00
structure built by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under
the supervision of the Department of General Studies, was
dedicated. Completion of this building and the new Student
Activity Center have enabled the Greensburg Campus to
consolidate all its activities on the 160-acre Mount Pleasant
Road Campus.

University of Pittsburgh
Yearbook

This year marks the 190th anniversary of
the University of Pittsburgh. On February
28, 1787, two months after Pennsylvania
ratified the United States Constitution, the
Pittsburgh Academy was chartered and housed
in a small log cabin (pictured above) at Third
and Cherry Streets, in present downtown
Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Academy gained
the distinction of being the first school of
higher learning west of the Alleghenies
offering the “Learned Languages, English,
and Mathematics.”

Thirty-two years later on February 18,
1819 the Pittsburgh Academy moved, re-
ceived a new charter, and became the Western
University of Pennsylvania. Robert Bruce be-
came the first principal (a title later changed
to chancellor in 1872). The Pittsburgh Fire of
1845 leveled this one building, Third and
Cherry Street campus, so the University
planted new roots on Duquesne Way, also
downtown. After this location burned in
1849, the campus was moved to Diamond and
Ross Streets and later to North Avenue on
Pittsburgh’s North Side.

Under Chancellor Samuel McCormick the
University found its present home in Oakland
where the cornerstone for the first University
building, The School of Mines, was laid on
October 2, 1908 (the same day the corner-
stone was laid in the Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial). Earlier that same year on July
11, the name of this institution had been
changed to its current title, the University
of Pittsburgh.

On September 27, 1926 ground was broken
for this the tallest school building in the world ‘
and the dream of Chancellor John Bowmanw
the 42 story Cathedral of Learning.

The Oakland Campus today is comprised of
50 buildings situated on 125—acres of land.

Pitt has come a long way since its 1787 log
cabin origin.

Pitt Wrecks Tech, 42-14

If the Panthers were to prove that
last week’s game was no fluke, Pitt
had to beat Georgia Tech: and defeat
them they did.

Pitt overwhelmed the Ramblin’
Wreck, 42-14 in Atlanta.

Despite running up an early 14-0
lead, Georgia Tech refused to quit
as they quickly tied the score at
fourteen.

Larry Swider kept Tech out of scor-
ing range with booming punts of
60- and 77-yards.

Meanwhile the Panther offense got
on track despite the unfortunate loss of
quarterback Bobby Haygood. Haygood
was injured with torn ligaments in his
left knee which would put him out of
action for the season.

Matt Cavanaugh hit on two scoring
passes—a 51 yarder to Gordon Jones
and a 6 yarder to Jones again after
Leroy Felder intercepted a pass at the
Tech 18-yardline.

The Panthers scored early in the
second half as Cavanaugh sprinted
four yards after Randy Holloway re-
covered a ball tipped by Felder.

_ Pitt went on to win the game handily,
but more importantly two questions

were answered—Matt Cavanaugh
could lead the Panthers to Victory and Taylor (29), Majors, & Jones (24) had ﬁne nights, but torn knee ligaments
Pitt was no ﬂuke sidelined Haygood for the year.

As the University of Pittsburgh celebrated
its 190th anniversary on February 18th of this
year, Wesley Wentz Posvar marked his 10th
year as Chancellor of the University, June
1, 1977.

Pitt was just becoming state-related back
then so tuition for Pennsylvania residents fell
from $1,400 to $450 per year. However
1976-1977’s tuition has since climbed to $1,266
per year. Pitt’s enrollment has doubled since
1967 to 19,425 undergraduates during
1976-1977 and the expenditures budget has
expanded to about $179,800,000——now
making the University the largest employer in
the City of Pittsburgh.

Since Dr. Posvar’s arrival, Pitt has added
new research centers in the areas of Ethnic
Heritage, International Studies, Arms Control,
International Securities, and Urban Research,
in addition to the School of Health Related
Professions. The Department of Life Sciences
was also founded with the consolidation of the
Biology, Biochemistry, Biophysics and Micro-
biology Departments. New departments as
black studies, environmental engineering, his-
tory and philosophy of science, crystallography,
medical technology and health records admini-
stration have also occurred under the auspices
of Dr. Posvar.

Such changes at Pitt verify Dr. Posvar’s
own summation—“We’ve been through growth
and rapid change through financial stringency
and austerity.”

Pitt shall continue to grow and thrive as
Wesley and Mildred Posvar (shown above)
enter their second decade as Pitt’s first
couple.
