HISTORY OF THE PHARMACY SCHOOL

 

IN THE LABORATORY

HE School of Pharmacy (The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy) was founded

by a group of professionally minded pharmacists in 1878. Its founding
anticipated college pre-requisite for licensure to function as a pharmacist by
almost an entire generation. In 1896 during the chancellorship of the late Dr.
William I. Holland, the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy became through affilia-
tion the School of Pharmacy of the Western University of Pennsylvania, and in
1908, of the University of Pittsburgh. In 1908 the Scio College of Pharmacy
merged with the School. From an abridged and intensive two year course
(Graduate in Pharmacy) requirements were consistently increased until in 1930
a standard four year course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in

Pharmacy was adopted.

96 Classes were meager. In the tragic
years from 1855 to 1864 there were
only three graduates from WUP.

 

DEAN’S MESSAGE

C. LEONARD O'CONNELL
Dean of the School of Pharmacy

C. Leonard O'Connell was born in Pittsburgh,
attended city grammar and high schools, and
was graduated from the University of Pittsburgh.
He was awarded his Ph.G. degree in 1912, his
AB. in 1916, and his Phar.D. in 1929. Dr.
O'Connell has been a member of the School of
Pharmacy Staff since 1922, when he was
appointed as an instructor. Four years later he ’
was given a professorship and in 1932 was made
Dean of the School. In the same year he was
awarded an honorary Ph.M. degree by the
Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science.

Dr. O'Connell is affiliated with various pro-
fessional organizations. He is a past_president
and past executive committee member of the
Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Association. Many
articles written by him have appeared in various
professional and trade magazines, and he is a
constant contributor to such journals. He col-
lects data from which he forms scholastic
philosophies—a hobby which indicates the
temperament of Dean O'Connell.

DEAN C. LEONARD O’CONNELL

THE period of formal training ends for most of you at graduation. I hope that
you have caught the notion that education from a point of view is an inner
striving toward something that is forever beyond our best efforts. Such an idea
may serve as a real stimulus as you voyage onward through the years. To give
the best you have to every task that comes your way will lead you inevitably
toward a certain happiness. After all, real joy in life comes through serving
others. My wish for you is a long and useful career rich in opportunities for

service to your fellows.
C. Leonard O'Connell

HISTORY OF THE EVENING DIVISION

IN a small, dingy Fulton Building office, a
handful of men listened intently to a tall,
young instructor, Joseph A. Beck, engage in a
rapid-ﬁre discussion of profound economic
theories. Sometimes he paused to invite com-
ments which not infrequently were generously,
intelligently contributed. They were all business
men ranging between the late thirties and middle
life, who were vigorously seeking a knowledge
of what was going on about them. It was the
panic year of 1907, a year when, even as now.
the subject of economics was of extraordinary
interest. Perhaps that very fact had a significant
inﬂuence upon what followed, for thus was born
the Evening School, formerly the Downtown
Division and now known as the Evening Division
of the University of Pittsburgh.

Mr. Beck, fresh from the Wharton School of i

Finance and eager to expound his newly
acquired theories, had prevailed upon the late
E. B. McCormick, then Chancellor, to permit
him to experiment with a new educational
scheme which he had observed in successful
operation in the East—that of holding classes at
night for the benefit of those employed during
the day. With considerable doubt and question,
the Chancellor consented, but only under the
strict condition that the experiment, to continue,
must be self-sustaining. Mr. Beck's success ex-
ceeded even his fondest hopes for less than two
years later, in 1909, the Evening School of
Economics, Accounts, and Finance was officially
organized and, under pressure of continually
increasing registration, larger quarters were
obtained. Little did Mr. Beck dream that in the
next quarter-century, not only would his experi-
ment have proved to be enormously successful,
but that both faculty and student body would
have increased two hundred fold.

By no means was Mr. Beck alone responsible
for the rapid growth of the School. None other
than that present-day eminent accountant,
Frank Wilbur Main, was inextricably involved
in its progress. It was he who taught the first
accounting class west of the Allegheny Moun-
tains. For the most part Mr. Main taught a sub-

ject about which little or nothing had been
written, yet the present significance of the
department he founded is conclusive evidence
that he provided a splendid foundation upon
which his predecessors such as Dr. A. X. Ashby,
pioneer in ﬁnance, could, and did, build.

Exceedingly inﬂuential in shaping the destiny
of the Division has been Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,
Director from 1926 to 1933. Immediately upon
his appointment, he started the task of extending
the curriculum to include complete courses in
five schools of the University: The College, The
Schools of Business Administration, Education,
Engineering and Mines, and the Graduate
School so as to meet the ever changing needs in
the lives of those for whom the Downtown Divi-
sion was established. He did so with such finesse
and grace that it was hardly discernible. After
having served as Director of the Downtown
Division for a period of seven years, his ac-
complishments, as an organizer, were recog-
nized by the Administration when he was called
to the equally important task of filling the office
of Dean of Men. He was succeeded by Professor
I. Lloyd Mahony, the present Director, whose
tremendous energy and capabilities have been
greatly instrumental in the rapid growth of the
Evening Division to its present enrollment of
about 3100 students, directed by approximately
125 faculty members.

THE DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE

I . LLOYD MAHONY

Director of the Evening Division

I . Lloyd Mahony was a small town boy. Born
in Fostoria, Ohio, he was graduated from the
School of Commerce of the New York Univer-
sity in June, 1923. In the fall he taught mathe-
matics in Fostoria High School, and in February
he returned to New York as Research Fellow at
the Guaranty Trust Company. The next year Mr.
Mahony came to Pitt as an instructor in Finance.
In 1934 after nine years of teaching he was made
Director of the Downtown Division, now known
as the Evening Session.

His students invariably like Mr. Mahony.
Pleasant and friendly, he talks with his students
in their own language. No one is ill at ease in
‘ his office. The director has a hobby seldom
I. LLOYD MAHONY . encountered in men of his profession in that he
sings well. For three years he studied voice with
Ierome Hayes in New York, and his pride in his
rich baritone voice is justifiable, as those who
have heard him will testify. In his professional
work he specializes in the field of finance.

INE years ago a young bank clerk registered in the Evening

School for a course in Real Estate Law. His job at the bank
had something to do with mortgages, and he wanted to know more
about them. The next fall he came back and took a course in Ac-
counting because he found that his work carried him into that
ﬁeld, too. Then he began to take courses in English, Psychology,
Mathematics, and Philosophy. Although originally he had had
no intention of working toward a degree, after he had accumu-
lated thirty or forty credits, he decided to keep at it until that goal
had been reached. In lune, he is being graduated from the School
of Business Administration.

The story of this young man's education is typical of the experi-
ence of most evening students. The desire to satisfy some vocational
interest brings them to their first evening class. Then they try other
courses. Encouraged and fascinated, they seek more knowledge.
The dream of a University degree seizes them and at length the last
required credit is taken and the Evening Session proudly acclaims
another who has earned every one of his one hundred twenty
credits “by night."

I rejoice with all of our graduates who are achieving the goal
set for themselves and wish them success in their every undertaking.
I hope that the sacrifices which have been a part of the price they
have paid will return a hundred fold in the rewards of this world
and in joy of living. They have many friends among the students
and faculty of the Evening School who will cheer their every step
forward, and who themselves will take new courage in their

accomplishments.
I. Lloyd Mahony

DEDICATION

AND YE SHALL REAP THE BENEFIT THEREOF.

OO often those who clear the path for progress are

not here to enjoy that to which they have given

life, and those who beneﬁt have not their strife to

look back upon. It is because we realize this that
we dedicate the 1937 Owl to the courageous and visionary
founders of the University and to those countless, who, for
the past one hundred and ﬁfty years, have contributed to
the development and welfare of the University.

The spirit of the founders that took root in the single
log cabin of 1787 is still with us. It has grown tflirough the
years, and today it ﬁnds new expression in th'e_:-4 Cathedral
of Learning, an enduring symbol of the coura'ge.and spirit
and of the endless groping upward that have béeh so much
a part of Pittsburgh. No community can give to its people a
full life without a complete cultural development. The
greatest achievement comes only when, through systematic
effort, we keep before us the best that is in our minds and
hearts.

This orderly enlightenment—the way to a more com-
plete life—has been the function of the University. Pitt's
prime service is to its community. Pitt's campus is Western
Pennsylvania. We are eternally grateful to those who saw
the need and strove in its fulﬁllment. They have sown, and
we have reaped.

The Evening Students’ Association is a concomitant of the growth of the Evening
School from a few classes in accounting and finance to the present Evening Session of
the University of Pittsburgh. As the Downtown Division of the University expanded its
curricula until in 1926 it became a university at night. A need was felt for an organiza-
tion to provide a varied social program for the general student body. The Downtown
Students’ Association was formed, a constitution written, and a program of social activi-
ties promoted. A _

The Evening Students’ Association is the successor to the Downtown Students’
Association. It is an organization which consists of the entire student body of the Eve-
ning School, because every student upon registration in the Evening Session auto-
matically becomes a member. The E.S.A., managed by student officers, provides a varied
program of social and educational activities and promotes the students’ welfare.

A handbook for students was published by the Evening Students’ Association. At
the beginning of the first semester, a reception known as “Open House Week" was
held. A “Harvest Festival" was held in November, and a week of carol singing and
dancing enlivened the last week of school before the Christmas recess. Four swimming
parties have been held to date, and two more are scheduled; a bridge party was held in
March and a spring dance in April; the annual dinner and dance was held on May 8 at
the Hotel Schenley. The Association has presented Cy Hungerford in an illustrated
lecture, and hopes to present Phillip Murray, assistant to John L. Lewis of the Committee
for Industrial Organization.

EVENING SESSION NEWS

The origin of the Pitt Evening Session News dates back to September, 1927, when the
publication first appeared under the name of the “Pitt Rivets." It was at that time in the
form of a ﬁfteen page magazine, which was issued once each month and sold to the
members of the student body at ten cents a copy. David L. Mitchell was the first editor.
Two years later, in 1929, the magazine adopted the name of the “Pitt Downtowner" and
continued in this form until 1931 when, due to ﬁnancial difficulties, it appeared as a four
page paper. - —

The publication underwent one further change when in 1936 the entire Evening
Division was moved out to the Cathedral of Learning. Its name was changed to the
present form, “The Evening Session News," and it is now appearing approximately once
a month on the back page of one of the issues of the “Pitt News," the day student news-
paper.

“The Evening Session News" aims to furnish the evening students with accurate,
up-to-date information about the various happenings of interest, especially concerning
extra-curricular activities as conducted by the Evening Students’ Association and the
several clubs, sororities and fraternities; to promote a closer feeling of friendship among
the evening students, and to provide an opportunity for those who wish to write to ex-
press themselves.

Requirements for membership on the staff of “The Evening Session News" include
the carrying of ten credits of University work and an active interest in Evening School
activities combined with some ability and willingness to express that interest in writing

ALPHA KAPPA PSI

Alpha Kappa Psi, the first professional fraternity in commerce was organized in the
evening school at New _York University on October 5, 1904. From an original group of
ten men the fraternity has expanded both numerically and geographically until now,
after thirty-three years, there are forty-eight active collegiate chapters and twelve alumni
chapters scattered throughout the United States and Canada. The national membership
is at present well over ten thousand members.

Delta, the local chapter, is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary this year, a charter
having been granted on October 29, 1912 to six charter members at the University of
Pittsburgh.

The objects of the fraternity are: to further the individual welfare of its members;
to foster scientific research in the fields of commerce, accounts, and finance; to educate
the public to appreciate and demand higher ideals therein, and to promote and advance,
in institutions of collegiate rank, courses leading to degrees in Business Administration.

Members are selected from men in both day and evening divisions of the School of
Business Administration who have scholastic ability and potentiality for future success.

Since it is essentially professional in purpose emphasis is placed on the professional
program, for that is the common bond of interest. Series of discussion groups on business
subjects led by prominent individuals, with occasional motion picture illustrations or
trips through some of the city's large industrial plants, provide the professional activity.
A separate calendar of social events is maintained to promote fellowship and it includes
dances, bridge parties, Sunday hikes, movie parties, and bowling parties.

DELTA MU DELTA

Delta Mu Delta, organized in Pittsburgh in 1921, is a national honorary society in
commerce with ‘a membership restricted to" students of high scholastic attainment. The
society was organized ‘at New York Universityhin 1913 by the faculty members of the
School of Commerce of that University. Admission is based solely on scholarship and
character, and the society ﬁlls, in the ﬁeld of commercial education, the place held by
Phi Beta Kappa in classical education.

There are approximately one hundred ﬁfty members, fourteen of whom are active
this year. From time to time the initiation committee invites outstanding students in the
School of Business Administration to membership. A gold key is presented to each mem-
ber at the time of his initiation.

Since the fraternity is an honor group, no specified program is held except at times
of selection and initiation of members. Therefore, its activities are limited to meetings
held on call of the president, and to an annual dinner at which students, who have
qualified with a 2.0 average or above, are taken into the society.

It was Bmshear who raised the 111
funds for the construction of the
present Allegheny Observatory.

EVENING DIVISION GLEE CLUB

In any large group there are always some who are interested in choral singing.
Such was the situation in the Downtown Division in 1935. Through the assistance of Mr.
I. Lloyd Mahony, the Evening Session Glee Club was able to acquire the services of Mr.
Fred W. Lotz, well known Pittsburgh musician, as director of the Club.

The plans for the organization were announced and were met with enthusiasm.
Rehearsal dates were set, officers were elected and the new organization settled down
to prepare the music for their first public appearance at the Christmas Party.

The success of this debut drew new members to the organization and work was
started after the first semester on new music for the annual Dinner and Dance at the
Schenley Hotel. This last appearance ended a most successful first year.

The Club again led the Carol singing at the Christmas Party and appeared at the
annual Dinner and Dance. In addition to these two appearances, the Club presented a
choral recital in the Cathedral Lounge under the auspices of the Music-Fine Arts Depart
ment of the Pitt Women's Club.

Membership is limited to students regularly enrolled in the Evening Session.

In 1865' Chairs of Chemistry and 112
Mineralogy, Engineering, and As-
trophysics were established.

KEDEMS

Kedems was founded on May 7, 1924 by Elizabeth Borland, Dorothy Dixon, Elizabeth
King, Rebecca Sullivan, Mildred Shogren, and Kathryn Stoerkel. The name Kedems was
derived by taking an initial from each charter member's name. The organization was
founded for the purpose of furthering higher ideals among University women students
and to interest them in scholarship, the arts, and social activities. Those invited to become
members must carry a minimum of eight credits.

Since the beginning of the school year Kedems has had at least one social function
each month in addition to the regular monthly meeting. Included in the social program
have been a Mother-Daughter Tea in the Evening Session Lounge, a weekend retreat at
the Girl Scouts Cabin at South Park, a Roller Skating Party, a Chop Suey Pledge Lunch-
eon, and a Scholarship Benefit Bridge Party. These were followed by a Scavenger Hunt,
Spring Dance, Election, and Founders’ Day Banquet.

The Kedems scholarship fund originated in 1931 and an unspecified amount is
awarded annually to a member who excels scholastically and in extra-curricular activi-
ties.

By a legislative act of 1872, the
113 powers of the U-ntverstty were

PHI CHI THET A

Phi Chi Theta, international commerce fraternity for women, was founded on lune 16,
1924 when Phi Theta Kappa and Phi Kappa Epsilon, two competing business fraternities,
united to prevent further rivalry. The national founders of Phi Chi Theta were Mary
Stoddard and Nina Miller of Columbia University, Anna Hall of Denver University, Edna
Blake of New York University, Alice Wyman of Northwestern University and Nell Mc-
Kenry of the University of Pittsburgh.

The fraternity was organized in order to promote the cause of higher business edu-
cation and training for all women, to foster high‘ ideals for women in business careers,
and to encourage fraternity and cooperation among women preparing for such careers.

During the school year, the fraternity invites students in Business Administration
courses to membership. A key is awarded annually to the woman in the School of Busi-
ness Administration who, in the judgment of the fraternity, excels in scholarship and extra
curricular activities.

Two of the Pittsburgh Alumnae members have been elected officers of the national
organization this biennial. Nellie I. lones guides the destinies of Phi Chi Theta as Grand
President, while Iona K. Morgenstern holds the office of Grand Secretary-Treasurer.
Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, Dean of the School of Business Administration, was inducted as
an honorary member in November, 1936, at the College Club.

PHI DELTA GAMMA

On November 8, 1935 a group of girls met in Dean Mahony’s office to discuss the
possibilities of organizing a fraternity for graduate women in the University of Pittsburgh.
It was through the efforts of Katherine Koch, a national founder, and Dean I. L. Mahony,
Director of the Evening Division, that this meeting resulted in the formation of a club
known as Delta Omicron. The girls were enthusiastic and at a banquet held February
22, 1936, their efforts resulted in the installation of Delta Omicron as the Kappa Chapter
of Phi Delta Gamma at the University of Pittsburgh.

Phi Delta Gamma, national fraternity for graduate women, is open to women of all
professional interests who are studying in graduate or advanced professional schools.
The purposes of Phi Delta Gamma are to promote the highest professional ideals among
women of the graduate schools and to advance the social welfare and activities of women
in graduate schools.

A tea, given each Fall for all graduate women of the University, was held on October
31, 1936 at the Heinz House. This was followed by a bridge party held at the Lounge in
November, while the National Founders’ Day Dinner was celebrated December 11, 1936
at the Ruskin Apartments. Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter spoke at the chapter's Founders’ Day
during the installation of new members in the banquet room of the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association. Professional or business meetings are held on the second Monday of each
month from September to June.

T HAS been the traditional endeavor of the Owl to

record the separate activities of the year and to fuse

them into an entity; to recapture and crystallize the

diffused spirit of the University as it exhibits itself in
the varied phases of University life; and to add, perhaps,
a touch of lustre to events which too soon become but
recollections. To these aims the 1937 Owl adds another:
to commemorate the one hundred and ﬁftieth anniversary
of the founding of the University by a connotative, appre-
ciative treatment of its record. There is no necessity here
for an exhaustive or detailed history; others have accom-
plished that. The editors hope to present a general
delineation of—and thus to kindle an interest in—the
glorious past of the University.

 

Dr. Henry Mitchell McO'racken
succeeded Dr. Woods as chancellor.
The new head took office in 1880.

PHI THET A PHI

Phi Theta Phi, founded in 1925, is a local women's fraternity. The charter members
who laid the foundation for its successful development up to the present day, were
Elizabeth Daﬂinger, Catherine Frey George, Alma A. Jordan, Margaret Jane Smith,
Virginia Brinkman Steen and Mary Ellen Wright. The fraternity’s activities are primarily
social with the purpose of fostering friendship among women students ofthe Evening
Division. Initiation is by invitation only and the honor is one widely sought by students
who tread the campus by night.

An annual award of $25 is made to the fraternity member who, in carrying six hours
of work, achieves the highest average. A contribution is also made each year for some
social service work determined upon by the members of the fraternity. Year by year the
membership of the fraternity increased gradually until there are, at present, forty-two
active members of Phi Theta Phi. One of the traditions of the fraternity is a Founders’
Day Banquet held about the middle of April each year. Mrs. George W. Duffus has been
serving as advisor of Phi Theta Phi assisted by Mrs. Marion K. McKay who was selected
as patroness of the fraternity.

PITT WOMEN'S CLUB

At a meeting held in the Heinz House on January 19, 1924, under the guidance of
Dean Amos, a group of enthusiastic women organized the Pitt Business Women's Club.

In February, 1931, the name of the organization was changed to the Pitt Women's
Club because the membership had grown to include students in education, college, and
graduate courses, as well as the usual business courses, by virtue of the fact that these
courses had been added to the night school curriculum after the club was organized.

Late in 1933 tour departments were formed, namely, Literature-Drama, Music-Fine
Arts, Current Topics, and'Cultural Hobbies. Each department has sponsored programs of
interest to the whole club. " _ .

For the past year the club has operated-a sandwich service in the Cathedral for the
convenience of night students and for the benefit of its scholarship fund. Scholarships
of $25 each for outstanding scholarship and participation in extra-curricular activities
were awarded to the following members: Josephine Tronsberg, Virginia Means, Kathleen
Hester, and Ruth Thomas.

The club conducted a planned social program, including a welcome tea each sem-
ester for new students, luncheons, bridge parties, an annual dinner, and picnic. Depart-
mental activities included musical programs, book reviews, and travel talks.

AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF BANKING

At the beginning of the present century, a number of bank clerks throughout the
United States, realizing their shortcomings and the advantage of further education in their
chosen line, organized what has become nationally known as the American Institute of
Banking.

The Pittsburgh Chapter was organized on May 14, 1901, with eighty—one charter
members. In the history of the Pittsburgh Chapter appear many names prominent in
banking circles, the first president being the late David Crawford Wills, who afterward
became Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Conducting its own
classes in various buildings in downtown Pittsburgh, the Chapter was finally affiliated
with the University of Pittsburgh in 1914. Using University instructors in addition to the
bank officer instructors, classes were conducted by the Downtown Division in the Cham-
ber of Commerce Building, until the Spring of 1936 when all classes were moved to the
Cathedral of Learning.

At the time of affiliation with the University, two courses: Money and Banking and
Commercial Law, were the requisites for the Standard Certificate of Graduation. Today,
eight courses must be completed before the Standard Certificate is received. Six other
courses and Public Speaking are now included in the curriculum, making a total of
fifteen courses in all. V

Up to the present date the local chapter has 381 graduates. This year out of a mem-
bership of 1343 there are 385 students enrolled and a registration by classes of 505 stu-
dents. The National organization is composed of 234 chapters throughout the United
States with a total membership of 54,844. The national class enrollment for this year is
33,261, thus making the American Institute of Banking the largest group for adult educa-
tion in the world. '

Membership is limited to those employed in financial institutions and investment
houses. Besides the school work mentioned, there are many social activities carried on
by the Chapter, and a Forum Group, consisting of bank officers, Chapter graduates, and
senior bank clerks holds six dinner meetings annually during the winter months.

SIGMA BETA SIGMA

Sigma Beta Sigma, professional fraternity of engineering students, was founded in
1926 with eight charter members. At the first meeting, A. L. Baum was elected president
and a constitution was drafted which was approved by the University authorities. Year
after year, with the encouragement and support of the faculty, the fraternity has pro-
gressed until it now numbers forty-six members and plans are being laid for expansion
into other schools.

The fraternity was founded to foster a spirit of friendship and good-will among the
members of the student body in the engineering division. Sigma Beta Sigma has en-
deavored to encourage proficiency in all branches of engineering through discussion of
such problems as may be brought to the attention of the members. It has become a
tangible connecting link between the faculty and the students of the Engineering School.

Sigma Beta Sigma sponsors activities in both professional and social fields. The
outstanding current activities are the fall and spring banquets at which the initiations
take place. Frequent smokers, at which the members chat and become better acquainted
with each other, have become the most popular events on the social calendar. The social
events are augmented by business meetings which are held monthly throughout the
school year.

THE R. O. T. C. CORPS

ORGANIZATIONS

The Thespian Corps Present Julius Caesar—1807

:l I HE FIRST ACTIVITY in the history of the University was the Thespian
Corps. Founded by Henry Marie Brackenridge, William Wilkins, Morgan
Neville, George Wallace, and Thomas Butler in 1807 when Pitt was the Pitts-
burgh Academy, The Thespians entertained not only themselves, but also the
entire city of one hundred and thirty families. The repertoire was confined to
Shakespeare. Years later, in 1820, obstreperous Thespians took to producing
the comedies of the day. This was too much for the indoctrinated villagers, and
the district newspapers hurtled a mortal barrage about the heads of the players
for this degeneracy. Thus sank to an ignoble death the first activity. But the
extra-curricular verve would not lay buried. In 1822 the Tighleman Literary
Society was founded by a group of law school students aided and abetted by
the beloved Judge William Tighleman of the faculty. This Society ﬂourished
until 1845, when the fire of that year destroyed all of its tiles as well as those ot
the University.

From the Thespians Corps and the Tighleman Society sprang the host of
activities that are now the very mainspring of campus life. There developed
through the years the Pitt News, the campus newspaper; the Pitt Panther, the
school's humorous publication; and the Owl, the recorder of the years. For
others whose interests lay not in journalistic ﬁelds, there is a legion of specialized
activities. For the linguist there are the French, Italian, and German Clubs.
For the vocalist there are the Glee Club and Cap and Gown; for those whose
voices are willing but not rhapsodic there is the Debating Club. The Quill Club
beckons to writers, and the John Marshall Club, to prospective lawyers. Catholic
students have founded the Newman Club. The Thespians, from their place on
high, can look with filial pride at their oﬁspring, the Pitt Players. There are
many other organizations. Self-governing associations, in which elected under-
graduates cooperate with the faculty in regulating campus activities, give the
politically minded student opportunity to put theory into practice. Social tra-
ternities and sororitie, with a common capacity for creating abiding friend-
ships, are numerous. Students who have distinguished themselves in particular
fields are rewarded by installation in appropriate honorary organizations. There
is life at Pitt, outside the classroom.

DEAN OF WOMEN

N 1787 when the University of Pittsburgh was getting its
first charter, women of the western world were writing

a charter of their “inalienable, natural, and sacred"

rights to educational, political, and social equality with men.
They were beginning to get a new attitude toward them-
selves, and their place in society. They were becoming
restive under patronizing declarations such as Rousseau's
“women exist to please us, to be useful to us, to console us,
to render our lives easy and agreeable." Their answer now
was that woman is no longer to be classed with slaves; that
she is born tree and is man's equal in all the rights of human
beings, and citizens; and that citizens are eligible for all
public places, dignities, and employments according to
their capacities; that marriage is not bondage for women,
but a social contract between man and woman to be
terminated by either party to it, and that all property should
be held in common for the benefit of the children. Pro-
claiming and publishing such beliefs brought constant
ridicule, ostracism, imprisonment, and even death to
women. _.

In 1937 it is almost impossible to believe that the freedom
women enjoy today has been bought at such a price, so
naturally, for instance, do women at the University fit into
its educational and social program. But in the world at

’ large much yet remains to be achieved. Women—and

Eillions git men——do not get poiselsis ill the rights of humgn
. eings. he woman's c arter e t at “justice cannot e
DEAN _iTHYRSA W. AMOS divided. It is for humanity entire—for that humanity which
is a living unity, beneath all its apparent sexual duality, its
seeming variety of races, and diversity of fast-fleeting
individuals." Today, as a part of the celebration of the
Sesqui-Centennial oi the University of Pittsburgh, let us as
women rejoice in the freedom we have attained and
dedicate ourselves anew to the cause of justice for all
humanity.

In 2087, when the University of Pittsburgh celebrates its
tercentenary, may it be said that the women of our loved
University did much to bring to men and women alike
greater social, educational, political, and economic equality.
Today justice is still divided. May it then be indeed a more
living unity, equal and exact.

Thyrsa W. Amos

DEAN OF MEN

OU seniors of 1937 are fortunate to

be graduated in Pitt's Sesqui-Cen-
tennial year, for you will be reminded in
many ways of the vision and courage
that it took to make Pitt and this com-
munity what they are today. You will
certainly feel a challenge not only to
carry on the ﬁne heritage that has been
left to you, but to contribute your best to
the future you will pass on to successive
generations of students.

As gentlemen and Pitt men you will be
expected to assume real responsibilities
in your professional and community life.
We hope and believe that Pitt has
helped you to meet these responsibilities
with the same self-confidence, becoming
modesty, and tolerance as did those in
the past who have contributed to. her
greatness and whose memory we are
proud to honor and celebrate on our
150th birthday. Our best wishes and
continued interest go with you as you
leave the campus to assume duties of
wider responsibility.

STUDENT- FACULTY

A general campus referendum approving the
adoption of the newly formed by-laws to supplant
the previous Student Council organization led,
in the Spring of 1934, to the founding of the Stu-
dent-Faculty Association. The Association was
soon divided into two groups. The governing
body of S.F.A. is composed of forty members,
thirty students and ten faculty members, and is
known as the University Assembly. The central-
izing force in the government of the Association

is the Executive Committee and consists of the _

Chancellor, the Deans of Men and Women, and
six students elected by the Assembly.

The Association is composed of all students
registered in the College, the Schools of Business
Administration, Dentistry, Education, Engineer-
ing and Mines, and their respective faculty mem-
bers. Ably expressed in the by-laws is the pur-
pose of the Association: “To provide additional
ways by which faculty and students may work
together on common problems and through these
joint activities enrich further the collective life
as well as the life of the individual at the Uni-
versity."

Coeds were assured a voice in the determina-
tion of the policy of the Association when they
were alloted ten seats in the Assembly and two
places on the Executive Committee to prevent

under-representation of women. The Assembly
is charged with the enforcement of rules and
regulations governing undergraduate social af-
fairs, the admission of new organizations, and
the regulation of existing organizations and of
general campus activities.

Probably the outstanding accomplishment of
the Assembly this year has been the very suc-
cessful inauguration of a student cheering sec-
tion under the guidance of Mr. T. W. Biddle and
Chairman Lou Bearer. A special block of 800
student rooters, supplied with blue and gold
reversible jackets and colored cards, provided
stunts and yells and color combinations which
demonstrated the Pitt spirit to the football world.

Something new in the way of projects were
the S.F.A. sponsored Concert Hours and Book
Chats which, under Chairman Bill Stark's di-
rection, in their first program before the stu-
dent body, presented the famed Cardwell Sing-
ers.

S.F.A. has also sponsored numerous Student
Assemblies of which the Notre Dame Pep As-
sembly, addressed by Dr. Iohn Bain Sutherland,
received the most enthusiastic support from the
student body.

Plans for the organization of Men's Council
originated in the Student-Faculty Association in
the spring of 1936. A sub-committee under the
chairmanship of James Nicholas drew up a con-
stitution for the council, the purpose of which
was “the administration of all activities strictly
pertaining to men students of the University of
Pittsburgh, excepting those activities under the
jurisdiction of the Advisory Board on Student
Activities."

Membership in the council includes repre-
sentatives from all the undergraduate schools of
the University. There is one representative for
each 200 men students enrolled in each school.
Schools entitled to only one representative elect
a senior; if two representatives are permitted the
second is a junior; three representatives include
a sophomore. Nominations are by petitions.
Charter members were elected at the general
campus election, April 28, 1936.

S.F.A. suggested a number of possible proj-
ects for the council but the duties were largely
undefined. It remained for the council itself to
investigate the needs of men on the campus and
to determine its possibilities for service. A com-
mittee on policy and study took up these ques-
tions. A number of projects have been organized
and operated this year while others will be ready

128

MEN‘S COUNCIL

to function in the fall. Men's customs were ad-
ministered by the council this year. Customs
examinations were given first-year men and
Panther pins awarded to those passing the tests.
Later the Customs Committee held an assembly
in Memorial Hall, which was in the nature of a
court hearing. Men campus leaders sat in judi-
cial robes at the bench and passed judgment on
the members of the freshman class. Awards were
made to men showing superior scholarship, par-
ticipation in activities, and ﬁne personal quali-
ties.

Men's Council organized this year the first
program to aid men transfer students in making
adjustments to University life. At a transfer
smoker the new students met administrative
officers and campus leaders. Opportunities in
activities were explained to the transfers and
they were given a chance to indicate their
special interests. This information enabled the
Council to help the transfers establish them-
selves on the campus.

Organization of a student loan fund for all
University men has been one of the main accom-
plishments of Men's Council. Adequate machin-
ery for the operation of a fund has been set up
ahd loans will be made starting in the fall of
1937.

Aside from work on these permanent projects,
the Council has aided in other campus activities.
It advertised the intramural sports program
and encouraged participation for letter awards.
Council participated in handling the Rose Bowl
Victory Celebration, and finally it planned com-
mencement customs for senior men.

Evaluation of the progress of such an organ-
ization as Men's Council requires several years.
The experience of this charter council should
enable the succeeding ones to progress rapidly
toward the establishment of a program to enrich
the experience of men students.

In 1889 W.U.P. suffered a sad loss.
William T. Thaw, one of the Uni-
'uerst’ty’s staunchest and most lib-
eral devotees, died in that year.

WOMEN'S SELF GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION

- From Lantern Night to Coronation, from green armbands to merit panthers, from
mixer dances to Scholars’ Day teas—all are within the scope of W.S.G.A. Some one
thousand women at Pitt are a part of the Women's Self Government Association, which
coordinates all organized activities for women and fosters a spirit of loyalty to the Uni-
versity. A quarter of a century ago the Women's Activities Association was formed and
in 1920 this association merged with W.S.G.A., which it had sponsored.

In October of each year, freshman women are welcomed by the association in the
oldest of the traditional events for women~Lantern Night. This fall Ruth Shapiro as
Father Pitt greeted white-clad freshmen and their senior mentors on Thaw Hall lawn;
upperclass women lighted the Chinese lanterns of the freshmen with their ﬂaming torches;
and the procession wound round University Drive to Heinz House. With the campus a
blaze of light and each face burning with the ambition reflecting this precious light,
Alma Mater, Lois Follansbee, instructed the freshmen where to find knowledge and
wisdom; both of which symbolize the thought, feeling, and desire for the spiritual light
that the University offers.

Hazing freshman women at the University today is as old-fashioned as bustles and
hoop skirts for the customs committee is in charge of the orientation of the newcomers.
Instead of making the freshman woman feel foolish and unwanted, she has become a
privileged person on campus and is respected by upperclass women. Customs planned
a brunch and a series of freshman mixer dances. Paul Jones’ and Virginia Reels were
almost as popular as the latest dance steps at the mixer affairs. At the conclusion of six
weeks, silver panthers were awarded to worthy freshman women at the merit panther
assembly. The freshman units ranging from publications to sports, and the freshman
council are under the guidance of W.S.G.A.

In addition to orientating the freshman, the association sponsors a housing board to
aid out-of-town students, a student loan to proffer help to undergraduates who are in
financial need, and a Scholars’ Day Tea for the purpose of offering congratulations to
tappees of scholastic honoraries.

Approximately two hundred activity leaders conferred at Leaders’ Institute, which
was chairmanned by Betty Wainwright. How to preside at a meeting, how to take minutes,
and how to balance a budget were a few of the major questions discussed at the Institute.

Women's Day tags attached to the lapels of new spring coats, helped in the com-
memoration of women's entrance into the University. Then during Spring Festival Week,
the identities of Senior Queen and Alma Mater were disclosed. Several weeks later the
queen was crowned in a ceremony patterned after the ancient English coronation rites.
And so Coronation is the final ceremony participated in by senior women before gradua-
tion. W.S.G.A. is the first to welcome freshman women and introduce them to University
life and the last organization to bid senior women farewell at Coronation.

COLLEGE ASSOCIATION

College Association has a reputation for staging the lowest-priced campus dances
with novel ticket selling features that usually draw the campus dancers. Directed by
genial Dr. Omar C. Held, Personnel Assistant to the Dean of the College, the College As-
sociation Cabinet is virtually a social group that meets several times during the month to
attend to the business at hand. The Cabinet members are kept busy peddling one dollar
per couple dance tickets to two Association dances each semester, the proceeds from
which are used to bolster a loan fund that operates to grant short-time loans to needy
students.

At the regular spring elections officers for the following year are elected to a
Cabinet composed of approximately twenty students in the College with each class given
equal representation. It has been the custom for the Association to sponsor an assembly
and present a prominent speaker to the students of the College. In the past year, for the
first time, all University students were invited to attend the assembly. “Curly" Stebbins,
crooning football star and hero of the Ohio State game, made his first campus appearance
at the assembly and was an instant “hit". Advance press notices lauded Stebbins, who
previously had been offered a contract with Ben Bernie's Orchestra, and packed the
College students into Memorial Hall. A trombone quartet set the audience's feet tapping
to the strains of “Sweet Sue" and other popular melodies.

In the fall the Kick-off Informal, first dance of the year, starred an all-College As-
sociation Coed eleven as the main attraction. Rose Nugent, fullback of the coed eleven,
was to kick a football from the stage of the Grotto ballroom into the arms of one of the
waiting males, but instead CA prexy Bud Beachler did the honors. Fraternity men
mobbed the ball, but a non-frater proudly carried off the pigskin. With the advent of
Thanksgiving, CA cabineteers sponsored a formal at the same North Side dance ﬂoor.
Herky, the Turkey, was to be the feature of the evening as a door prize. Meanwhile the
Meds did away with Herky and merely returned Herky's feathers and guillotined head
in time for the drawing. Brain trusters of the cabinet attempting to devise sales ideas
for the third dance held at the Hotel Schenley, finally agreed upon the selection of a
Campus Beauty Queen to put over the dance. lean Lawson, popular president of Pan-

hellenic Council and a senior in the College, who incidentally was off skating on the
fatal night, was selected queen of the dance. Then, the Southern Spring Informal, ﬁnal
dance project of the Cabinet featured a stag line and a swing band as a ﬁtting climax E
the CA dance season. And so CA tickets sellers take a rest for the summer and plan new
sales speeches for the fall proms.

131 Although their location was disad-
vantageous for many students, the
new buildings had their good points.

 

For the first time the chemistry and
engineering departments were pro-
vided with adequate laboratories.

YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN
ASSOCIATION

Indian summer, the Hearth Ceremony, Carissima, and the kindling of the ﬂame of
friendship in the Heinz House fireplace recall the traditional welcome of the Y.W.C.A.
members to freshman women. Patterned after the ancient Roman ceremony, the kind-
ling of the tires is significant of the new friendships and acquaintances offered to incoming
University women. A feast of fruits and sweet meats was later served by Y.W.C.A.
cabinet members, who were gowned in togas.

Symbolic of the Y.W.C.A. is,.the blue triangle which represents fellowship, friend-
ship, good times and a melting pot of thoughts, opinions and new ideas. Many diversified
activities are integrated into the whole of Y.W.C.A. Foremost of these were the religious
programs of the year including religious assemblies, worship services, and a freshman
religious assembly led by Dr. Buttrick. The theme for the tall retreat was the subject,
“Find Out What to Think" which was led by Dr. Hornell Hart. Then Association Night
meetings were held monthly in the “Y" club rooms and Heinz House with Negro spirituals,
square dancing, and song fests as features.

Members of the Social Service Club of the Y.W.C.A., who are enrolled in sociology
courses at the University, have led groups in Pittsburgh settlement houses and made
trips into city localities and Western Pennsylvania communities, which have created
deeper understanding of social" relationships. Inquiry Forums on the pressing social
issues of the‘ day were held at noon on Mondays in a classroom in Alumni Hall. Judge
Ralph Smith, Phillips Murray, Chairman of the Steel Workers’ Organizing Committee of
the C.I.O., and Hubert Herring, an authority on international relations were among the
outstanding speakers of the forums.

Student industrial cooperative programs with industrial girls and students of
Pittsburgh colleges, institutes; and conferences on international understanding were
conducted by Y.W.C.A. clubs. For the purpose of interesting seniors in the community
organization of our city, world peace projects have been included in these studies.

Alumni Hall's candy and milk stand is under the supervision of Y.W.C.A. members,
who manage the quick lunches for hungry students. Anything from potato chips to
chicken salad sandwiches is on the menu offered by the Y.W.C.A. stand.

Throughout the years, the Association has cooperated with other student groups
for the best interest of the women on campus, helping to promote Women's Day, Leader's
Institute, and other projects, campus wide in nature. From 1917 to 1936 the Association
has been advised by six secretaries, with Miss Helen Battrick, present secretary, occupy-
ing the Y.W.C.A. desk at Heinz House. The association, which is governed by a cabinet
of undergraduates and an advisory board of interested faculty members and friends,
has proved a unifying force on the University campus during its lifetime of twenty-six

 

years.

YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN
ASSOCIATION

The history of a men's religious organization at the University follows the pattern
of similar activities in other American universities. A century or more of intermittent
efforts to establish fellowship of students resulted finally in a permanent affiliation with
the Young Men's Christian Association which was expanding rapidly about the latter
part of the nineteenth century. The Young Men's Christian Association was founded by
Sir George Williams of London in 1844, and the movement soon spread over the whole
world. Ten years later, in I854, the first college Y.M.C.A. was established at the
University of Virginia. The movement grew rapidly in the universities and colleges, and
by 1877 so many college Associations had been established that a separate Student
Department was organized.

No official records are available to indicate the exact date when the men's religious
organization at the University of Pittsburgh first called itself a Young Men's Christian
Association. We do know that in 1909 a full-time executive secretary was employed for
the Association, and that date is marked as the time of its officially recognized relationship
with the general movement. Since 1909 six secretaries have served the Association.
The first secretary was George M. Kirk, who wrote “Hail to Pitt", now personnel director
of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. He was succeeded by Dr. lohn Moore, now president
of Lake Forest College. Then followed Mr. Straney, Mr. Van Tine and Mr. Don Shumaker
in turn. Mr. W. W. Mendenhall has been secretary since 1930.

In all these years the name of Dr. S. B. Linhart has been practically synonymous with
that of the Association. Dr. Linhart was active in the Young Men's Christian Association
for over fifty years and was instrumental in founding the Association at the University.
Except for the first year, 1909-1910, Dr. Linhart was chairman of the Committee of Manage-
ment twenty-seven consecutive years, until his death December 11, 1936.

In recent years the Association has grown tremendously and in many ways asserts
great influence on the campus. The activities are organized around the Association's
units (clubs) each of which carries on a many—sided program of religious, social and
other activities designed to promote personal growth of students. In addition to these
groups, many campus-wide events render a service to a surprisingly large number of
men on the campus. Some of the outstanding events provided by the Association include
Religious Convocations, Inter-collegiate Conferences, Institute of Public Affairs, Inquiry,
and a variety of social and recreational services.

Freshman Camp, held at Kon-o-Kwee the first week-end of the Fall school term, is
undoubtedly the most popular of the Y.M.C.A. campus activities. This year's camp, led
by Louis Bearer, was the most successful of all and has more than adequately fulfilled
its purpose of acquainting the freshmen with the faculty members, upper class student
leaders, and each other. The World Student Christian Conference held at the mountain
paradise—Eagles Mere—where the University of Pittsburgh last year had the distinction
of sending the second largest number of delegates, was the highlight of the year's
social and religious activities.

WOMEN'S ATHLETIC , ASSOCIATION

Pep, vim, and vigor plus vitamins A, B, and C makethese W.A.A. girls what you
strive to be——all-American or rather all Pitt stars in hockey, track, swimming, and tennis.
When the Girls’ Varsity Basketball team was organized in 1917, few thought women's
athletics at the University would make such strides during its first two decades. Impelled
by the slogan “help the girls beat Penn" many contributions rolled in and made it
possible for the varsity team to go East in 1923 and play the University of Pennsylvania,
Swarthmore, and Bryn Mawr. The women, encouraged by a team which won practically
all of their games in six years, formed the Women's Athletic Council, rechristened
Women's Activities Association, and today known as the Women's Athletic Association.
Originally, the purpose of the association was, “To foster clean sportsmanship and to
promote and further higher physical efficiency among women of the University of
Pittsburgh."

Today, W.A.A. has a complete program, beginning with the traditional Coed Prom
and ending with a steak fry at which the new officers are installed. Upperclass women
dressed in their brother's or dad's best Sunday suit escorted the freshmen women to the
University Club. With Bill LeRoy's Orchestra supplying the music, the Coed Promenaders
exchanged dances and staged a gold and blue garden hat contest. Week-ends at Camp
Kon-O-Kwee, roller skating parties at the Lexington rink, and F rick Park outings crowded
the year's activity schedule. Tiny cabaret tables and European folk dances are reminis-
cent of the annual W.A.A. Cabaret at Heinz House. Then for the Water Carnival held
in conjunction with the city and Tech, P.C.W., and Duquesne representatives, lighting
and costuming effects were comparable with those of Hollywood productions. A student
written script was used by the Water Carnival Committee. Play-days for high school
students were also sponsored by the association at Trees Gym.

W.A.A. has broadened its social program so that by now it includes recreational
sports; such as riding, ping-pong, and badminton; a Coed Prom, an annual cabaret
supper, tea dances, intramural, and inter-collegiate playdays, occasional week-end

camping trips, an intramural banquet, and a senior farewell. In this way W.A.A. serves
to supplement the physical education department in obtaining the interest and partici-
pation of hundreds of Pitt girls in sports. A varsity team . . . strange attempts at athletic
councils . . . vain efforts to establish a gym below the “Alps" . . . recreational sports

. . new physical tests . . . social functions . . . play days . . . until to-day we have

Dr. William Jacob Holland became

134 the new chancellor. It was his aim
to unite all the departments of the
University in‘ location.

BRIDGE CLUB

London Bridges may be falling down, but the Bridge Club at the University of
Pittsburgh is being built up. The youngest club at the University was organized in 1935
by the youngest certified Culbertson teacher in this country at that time.

Through the initiative of Leonard Seder, a senior in the School of Business Admin-
istration, the meetings were held in the old faculty club rooms in the Hotel Schenley,
under the sponsorship of Dr. James S. Taylor, mathematics professor, Dr. Iules Labarthe
of the Mellon Institute of Technology, and Dr. A. L. Robinson, professor of Chemistry.
Three tables of bridge, rather twelve members in all, started the club. As the membership
increased to twenty-six the next year, arrangements were made to use the Schenley
Bridge Club at the Hotel Schenley. Then the club decided to seek recognition from the
Student Faculty Association and within a few weeks became a recognized University
activity. V

Students and faculty members alike are learning how to avoid trumping their
partner's ace when their minds are not fully occupied with the hand to be played. Now
the Pitt Bridge Club has become popular as a means of relaxation and forming social
contacts among its members. Across the bridge table, both men and women concentrate
on the game and forget about that chem paper that is due the next day or that mid-
semester exam coming up the following week. Approximately ﬁfty members are now
included on the list of bridge enthusiasts.

Leonard Seder has been the presiding officer throughout the organizing years of
the club. The purposes of the club are threefold: to improve the bridge playing of the
students at the University, to provide an opportunity for closer relationship between
students and faculty, to make the student body bridge conscious and attempt to bring
Contract Bridge into the College curriculum. The club feels it has fulﬁlled its purposes.

Outstanding activities of the club for the past three years have been periodic
duplicate matches with a faculty team headed by Dr. Labarthe. Though only one victory
V was recorded in the three years of competition, the student team at times showed a certain
~llMlFI"Mf"'." amount of promise. Weekly duplicate bridge tournaments are held for the members.
any 9 In these tournaments, six matches were played with the faculty, with the members
 winning two and losing four. Perhaps the best student team in the Pittsburgh district
was that of Seder and Frank Hockensmith, a graduate of '36; with both men playing
highly commendable games. At the World Bridge Olympic Tournament this year, the
Bridge Club hopes to be represented by a faculty team that will carry off a couple of
the prizes.

Dr. Holland sought also to add new
departments. He began a. program 135
of expansion that continued long

after he left oﬁice.

 

THE PITTSBURGH ACADEMY~l787

l HE YEAR 1937 is a landmark in the history
of the University of Pittsburgh from whence
we can look back upon 150 years of progress.
The history of the University epitomizes the his-
tory of education in Pittsburgh, Idealism, tem-
pered with a growing realization of the need for
education in this thriving frontier town, motiva-
ted the founding ot the University. In that day
there were 150 families in Pittsburgh.

The year was 1787, and Hugh Henry Bracken-
ridge, Representative in the General Assembly
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, petitioned
the Legislature for a charter for the establish-
ment of the Pittsburgh Academy. On February
28, the charter was granted. A three room log
cabin was built near the fort at the Point, and
George Welch, who had advertised in the
“Pittsburgh Gazette" that he was an instructor
in “learned languages, English, and mathe-
matiks," was made principal. A half dozen buck-
skin clad students enrolled. They aimed to re-
ceive an education in “useful arts, science, and
literature." The usual classical subjects were
taught—elocution, literature, mathematics,
French, astronomy and the rudiments of chem-
istry.

By 1790 enrollment had increased enough to
warrant the construction of a new brick building
near the log cabin, which then served as a pro-
fessor's home. As the Academy progressed, the
faculty, the equipment, and the scope of instruc-
tion grew. Joseph Stockton, who served as the
last principal of the Academy from 1810 to 1819,
wrote two widely used textbooks during his
tenure: “The Western Calculator" and “The
Western Spelling Book." These were the most
modern textbooks in use beyond the Alleghenies.

1O

 

ONE HUNDRED , FlFTY YEARS. . . .

The townspeople were always looking up-
ward. A new charter, secured in 1819, reorgan-
ized the Academy, and the school was known
now as WUP—the Western University of Penn-
sylvania. The Rev. Dr. Robert Bruce was the new
principal, and during his long term, which
lasted until 1842, great_ advances were made.
A new building was erected; engineering
courses were offered, and a Law School began
to function. By 1845 WUP was acknowledged
as one of the best schools west of the Alleghenies.

The bright outlook soon dimmed. Twice with-
in four years the University with all its equip-
ment was burned. The great fire of 1845 swept
the city, completely demolishing the University.
Soon a new building was erected on Duquesne
Way. And in 1849 a second great ﬁre raged
through the downtown section, again razing the
University. The discouraged trustees shook their
heads at their misfortune and rented a building
where classes were held until 1854. In that year
the wandering students moved to a new school-
house at Ross and Diamond Streets, with John
F. McLaren as Principal. WUP again began to
grow. The day of industrialism was beaming
bright in Pittsburgh, and men of knowledge were
needed.

Progress, however, soon received another
jolt. The Civil War burst upon the nation, and
in those tragic years WUP was virtually without
students.

In 1858 Donati's Comet had flashed across
the sky, and a wave of interest followed. Lectures
on astronomy were given, and an Allegheny
Telescope Society was launched. Members sub-
scribed for the purchase of a small telescope,
and a rare thing happened. The fund was over-

W.U.P. lost another famous ﬁgure
in 1890. Samuel P. Langley resigned
his professorship to head the Smith-
sonian Institute.

 

WOMEN'S DEBATING

Contrary to the opinon of several million men that women merely gossip, Women's
Debating Association members prove that they have something to say and say it in an
interesting as well as entertaining fashion. With twenty active members who know when,
where, and how to talk, the Women's Debating Association schedules debates before
parent-teacher groups, church organizations, and various women's clubs. Organized
in 1922, the Association is noted not only for its campus and intercollegiate speaking,
but also for its extension debating. Four intercollegiate debates which took place on the
campus this year were sponsored with teams from Bates College, Lewiston Maine,
George Washington University, Penn State College, and Bucknell University. Extended
trips to Dennison College, Marietta College, University of Illinois, and Ohio Wesleyan
University widened the scope of the debaters, who made fine acquaintances with their
opponents. In the spring, the women's team, together with the Men's Debating Team,
were joint hosts at the Intercollegiate Debate and Speech Conference to which seventeen
colleges sent representatives. But these active young women have other interests
beside debates; among these are panel discussions, one of which was presented at
P.C.W. and another at the University's Parent-Teachers Association. Publications are
also a part of their program. Foremost of these efforts are the pamphlets, “Helpful Hints
to Heads" and “Pitt Pointers on Parliamentary Procedures," which were given to various
women's organizations. The general aim of the Women's Debating Association, is to
produce speakers of poise and ability, and to stimulate debate upon subjects of public
interest. An upper class squad composed of from 20 to 30 members present the debates.
Tryouts for this squad are held at the beginning of the year. Monthly supper meetings
for business sessions and social get togethers round out the women's debating activities.
As an advisory group to the freshman Public Speaking Unit, W.D.A. sponsored several
meetings to aid the frosh in gaining debating experience. Under the supervision of Miss
Theresa Kahn, faculty advisor and women's debating coach, the Women's Debating
Association has made great strides in the field of collegiate debating and a promising
future is foreseen by the group.

In 1892 an old ambition of the Uni-
versity was achieved. Previously an
attempt to fomtd a Medical School
had failed in 1880.

 

MEN'S DEBATING

No campus activity of our University better exemplifies the march of progress,
“from log cabin to Cathedral of Learning," than men's debating. For over a hundred
years that time-honored guild of loquacious assenters and dissenters tread a rocky path
being unable to establish a stable organization on campus restricted by inadequate
ﬁnancial appropriations.

The earliest organization of Pitt spell—binders ventured forth under the title “The
Tighleman Literary Society of the Pittsburgh Academy." That was in 1787. No great
advancement was made for 137 years, unless a Debater’s Union affiliated with the
Y.M.C.A. in 1908, be hailed as the beginning of the debater's Rennaisance!

But in 1924 the great awakening took place under the capable direction of Dr.
William M. Parrish. The schedule was enlarged to include some 70 or 80 debates before
attentive audiences in clubs, high school assemblies, Chambers of Commerce, and other
distinguished groups. Holding as its objective, a desire to give students instruction and
practice in public speaking and audiences an opportunity to hear an intelligent dis-
cussion of public questions, the association has progressed notably in recent years.
Tours have taken our debaters into every state in the Union and abroad into Canada and
Cuba. " ,

In an effort to stimulate interest in_debating among the high schools, Director
Charles W. Lomas and Manager Edward Springer arranged an extensive program to be
given before secondary schools. Taking as their subject the national high school
question, “Resolved that all electric utilities should be governmentally owned and
operated,” Pitt debaters and teams from Western Reserve presented discussions before
various high school assemblies in the Pittsburgh and Cleveland districts. It is estimated
some 3500 students heard the University teamsecomposed of Bill Stark and Robert
McKee in Cleveland and Bernard McKenna and Edward Springer in Pittsburgh-
defend or attack this vital issue.

The men debaters opened the forensic season at the annual Westminster Tourna-
ment, where a team consisting of Arthur Kelley, Stanley Rogaliner, John Fritzmeier,
William Stark, and Robert McKee debated the national intercollegiate question, “Re-
solved that Congress shall be empowered to regulate maximum hours and minimum
wages for industry.” Also on the schedule for the year were verbal contests with Purdue,
Marquette, Bucknell, and Williamette University of Oregon. The most outstanding event
of recent activity was the radio debate with the University of Washington presented
over the NBC network in a coast-to-coast hook-up. William Stark and Robert McKee
represented the University. Another important feature on the schedule took a delegation
of six to Rock Hill, South Carolina, to compete with debaters from more than a score of
colleges and universities east of the Mississippi in the “Grand Eastern Tournament"
on April 8 to 10. The last event of the year was the formal banquet at which the awards
for outstanding achievement were made.

OIL AND GAS ASSOCIATION

The Oil and Gas Association, like similar societies for other departments of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines, was organized in 1928. The primary purpose in
organizing the association was to enable the regular scheduling of one hour each week
at which all members of the department could meet to hear talks by men actively engaged
in the oil and gas industry.

Numerous oil and gas companies maintain central offices in or near Pittsburgh,
and with them the Oil and Gas Department of the University maintains a close contact.
the departmental society enables the students to meet and to hear talks by the leading
men of these companies and by leaders in industry in general. Inasmuch as all classes
of the department attend these weekly meetings, a closer relationship is also established
between the students themselves. This has come to be one of the major objectives of the
association. Such contact is particularly advantageous to the freshmen and sophomores
in that it enables them to gain an early orientation in the profession, and to arrive at an
early decision concerning their own qualiﬁcations for an interest in oil and gas work.
The members of the society elect their own officers to conduct their meetings and assist
in the selection and introduction of the speakers. A part of the hour is usually given to
social or other business of interest to the group as a whole.

When established, the society plan was unique to the School of Engineering and
Mines at the University of Pittsburgh. Although these schools have a distinct advantage
over similar schools of other Universities, in that the University of Pittsburgh is located in
a highly industrialized community, the plan has, after careful study, been adopted by
several other institutions. The Engineering Council for Professional Development,
which in 1936 made an intensive study of the comparative qualifications of all eastern
schools for the training of engineers, definitely approved and recommended the society
plan of the University of Pittsburgh.

Activities of the organization do not stop when school is over, since the Oil and Gas
Association has a definite social calendar. Each semester has a smoker and dance.
Longue Vue Country Club was the site of the '36 semester dance, then the scene changed
to Churchill Valley Country Club for the second dance on March nineteenth. At the
first smoker, which is for the primary purpose of orienting the lower classmen, President
Steele gave each freshman an upper-classmate to act as his brother and advisor. This is
an entirely new policy for the association and has met with marked success.

It is felt by all concerned that the organization is rendering a distinct and proﬁtable
service to all oil and gas engineers.

The University took over in 1892

the Western Pennsylvania Medical 138
College, which became the Medical

School of W.U.P.

Chairmanned by William Ryan, this year's Senior Announcements Committee made
an innovation in the senior announcements. For the first time since the announcements
were introduced in 1930, they will take the form of invitations, instead of the old and
staid formal announcement. The theme of the University's growth from a log cabin to
the Cathedral is portrayed on the blue and gold leather covers. The invitations are
prefaced with the calendar of the senior events and the names of the Commencement
Day speakers. Included in the content of this invitational booklet are the names of the
1100 students who will graduate. These announcements serve as active reminders
of the growth of the University's first graduating class of three to the largest graduating
class in the history of the University.

Further expansion followed. In 1895

139 the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy
became the Pharmacy School of
W.U.P. '

SPRING FESTIVAL WEEK

Spring——a young man's fancy usually turns
to love, but this spring the fancies of Pitt men
and women turned to Festival Week. And their
fancies ran riot with a carnival, a “Circus
Swing" tea dance, tap day, ﬂoat parade, and a
sweepstakes. Under the co-chairmanship of
Kathryn Hardy and Louis Bearer, elaborate
plans for three full days of Spring Festival ac-
tivities were formulated.

On Wednesday afternoon, April 28, tea
dancers from near and far gathered at Webster
Hall to execute the newest of new dance steps
and incidentally to initiate the first event of that
carefree week. After dinner and a change of
clothes, the students crowded into Carnegie
Music Hall for the annual Home Concert of the
University Band under the direction of Mr. Lee
M. Lockhart. Hundreds of students whistled the
refrains of military marches played by the band
and sang a patriotic “Hail to Pitt" on the way
home.

Bright and early the next morning students
viewed the three-reel movie of University life.
From 10:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. darkness envel-
oped the Carnegie Lecture hall theater and
afforded an opportunity for a bit of holding
hands. Then Spring Festival goers climbed the
hill to the Stadium forlseveral hours of outdoor
sports. Athletic exhibitions including races, rol-
ler skating contests, and tumbling performances
furnished excitement for the spectators. Car-
nival Night on Foster Court, between the Cathe-
dral and Foster Memorial, was the next attraction.
Colorful lights illuminated the carnival booths of
the twenty booths sponsored by campus organi-
zations. Wheels of chance, bingo games, and
refreshments were featured at several of the
booths of the publications, debating, and dra-
matic groups. A varsity show was held in con-

M,

junction with the carnival and amateurs per-
formed before the encouraging audience. Pre-
views of Cap and Gown skits were well received.
Dancing under the stars to the music of some of
the better known orchestras took place on the
patio.

Classes were dismissed early Friday morning
so as not to interfere with the scheduled events,
especially the Tap Day Assembly. Bill Stark,
chairman of the Assembly, suavely directed the
program during which leading activities or-
ganizations tapped new members. The Senior
Queen of the class of 1937 was brought forward
and acclaimed by the group. Another of the
senior women, Alma Mater, shared the honors
with the Queen. For the men, announcement of
the recipient of the Senior Award was awaited
anxiously. At the conclusion of the program, the
students dissembled and later took their places
along the line of the women's float parade.
Expectantly they awaited the floats as R.O.T.C.
men and the University band marched down
Bayard Street preceding the gayly decorated
trucks. Then the trucks laden with fraternity
women dressed as characters of the comic strips
slowly rolled down the avenue. Lil Abner, Tillie
the Toiler, Maggie and Iiggs, and other figures
of the comic pages nodded at the throngs. Fra-
ternity men had their inning with an exciting
sweepstakes of push-mobiles. Each fraternity
vied for honors and the men rounded the cor-
ners in lightning fashion eager to reach the
ﬁnish line.

At ten o'clock, Friday evening, in the Hotel
Schenley lobby, Spring Festival dancers again
exchanged greetings. Two by two, the guests
entered the ballroom where Chairman Bob
Churchill staged a most successful informal
swing session which closed the Spring Festival
Week of 1937.

Pitt Riﬂes, honorary military fraternity and drill unit, has been in existence on
campus as an organized group since 1932. In May of that year, members of a “model
drill platoon" petitioned the Military Department of the University for recognition as a
group under the supervision of the department. Work as a drill group under the name
Pitt Riﬂes was begun in September under the direction of William Havlak, captain, and
First Lieutenant D. C. Tredennick, assistant professor of military science and tactics.
As stated in the constitution, adopted in November, 1932, the purpose of Pitt Riﬂes is to
“promote efficiency in close order drill by affording opportunity to receive additional
instru’ction and practice and to promote fellowship among men interested in R.O.T.C.
work.” For the first semester of 1932-33, Pitt Riﬂes numbered only 27 members, and only
18 candidates tried out, of whom eight were later pledged. First special work done by
Riﬂes was ushering at the Chancellor's Reception in November, 1932. In lanuary, 1933,
members decided not to apply to Student Council for official recognition; and at the
same time mentioned the difficulty in securing candidates to try out for membership in
the organization. During the first full year of work, Pitt Riﬂes held two smokers in addition
to presenting their first silent drill at the R.O.T.C. regimental inspection in May. Under
the leadership of George Roll and George Strong, captains in 1933-34 and 1934-35,
Pitt Riﬂes continued their special drill work and expanded their social program to include
one dance each year. In 1935-36, with Alex Leggin as captain, Pitt Riﬂes brought their
membership up to 75 without lowering requirements. Again the Pitt Riﬂes silent drill
featured the R.O.T.C. regimental inspection. At the end of his last year as faculty advisor
of Pitt Riﬂes, Captain Tredennick was presented with a gift following the review and
initiation of new members.

Starting the 1936-37 year auspiciously, Pitt Rifles found a record turnout of 125
candidates for membership at the beginning of the first semester. Drill for candidates
and actives were directed by Alex Leggin and Captain K. P. Flagg, new faculty advisor,
until December 11, 1936, when lack Withum, newly-appointed captain for the year,
took charge. Other ofﬁcers appointed were Al Kairys, first lieutenant; Elmer Puchta, sec-
ond lieutenant; William Kunkel, right guide and historian; George Mantzoros, left guide
and pledge captain; George Knox, pledge sergeant; Don Sipe, pledge corporal; and
Edwin Ellis, first sergeant. Ushering at special events included service at the College
Association Assembly, the Chancellor's Reception, the Scholar's Day Assembly, and
Spring Festival Week. Highlight of the social calendar was the annual formal dance, held
at the Twentieth Century Club on December 11, with Bob Duncan's orchestra. At the
dance, announcement of Irene Maroney as first co-ed captain established a new prece-
dent for Pitt Riﬂes. A smoker for candidates and a spring picnic were also planned.
From the long list of candidates who reported in September, 41 were initiated as new
members on February 26. Practice on special drills for the May regimental review were
started the following week.

1895 was a momentous gem‘ for the
men of W.U.P. D1‘. White, presi-
dent of the Board of Trustees, had
promised a message of great impor-
tcmce.

THE 1937 OWL

 

INCE this year's Owl has as one of its main purposes a depiction of the past of the

University, it is fitting that mention should here be made of the history of the Owl
itself. The first Owl was published in 1907. The Editor was James Irvin McCormick, son
of Chancellor Samuel Black McCormick, and the Business-Manager was Conant Van
Blarcom who was also Superintendent of the school shops. They launched the publica-
tion with the words; “. . . We expect no eulogy . . . we beg no sympathy." That their
idea had merit is no longer doubted for the journal has had a continuous record since
that date. Two years later George M. P. Baird, the author of the words to the Alma
Mater, edited the book.

The early Owls, which resembled literary journals rather than school annuals, sold
for two dollars and were the size of school primers. The growth of the University and
economic changes generally are reﬂected in the size and contents of the Owl of each
year through the first three decades of its existence. Year by year the book grew in
volume and in artistic value. The 1919 and 1920 editions, dedicated to the men who had
entered the service of the anny, were severely simple. With the return of normal condi-
ditions the book, too, changed its aspect and appeared for the first time bound in an
imitation leather cover. In a later edition colored division-pages made an initial appear-
ance, and annually the artwork and photography became more and more professional.
In 1928 the record-breaking 476 page Owl introduced the now traditional Hall of Fame.

This 1937 Owl seeks to pay tribute to the glorious past of the University by com-
memorating the 150th Anniversary of the founding. Editor Stanley D. Rogaliner sought
to maintain the continuity of theme by the page decorations, depicting changes in the
life of the University, each of which is accompanied by a concise statement concerning
some event in the history of the school. In conformity with its central theme the Owl not
only reviews the activities of the current year but traces the origins and histories of all
of the prominent groups on the campus. None of the traditional features are excluded——
the innovations are simply included as additions to make this a more complete record.
The Owl appears, therefore, in a larger form than in recent years but an attempt has been
made to simplify the style and to replace the stiff formality of former publications by the
use of more personalized write-ups and more informal photographs wherever possible.
Every effort has been exerted to make this 1937 Owl a more readable and more enjoyable
publication than any of its predecessors.

subscribed! A large telescope, second only to
the one at Harvard, was purchased, and in 1865
the Allegheny Observatory was given to the Uni-
versity by a group of citizens headed by William
Thaw. Samuel Pierpont Langley, the first to con-
struct an airplane that flew, was made Director.
His co-worker, Iohn A. Brashear, raised suf-
ficient funds for the present building.

After the War the University maintained a
steady growth. Under Chancellors George
Woods and Henry M. MacCracken—from 1859
to l884—enrollment doubled. A School of
Chemistry and a College of Engineering were
formed. Larger quarterswere needed.

“Old Allegheny" became the new home of

the University. There, on Perrysville Avenue, '

WUP ﬂourished as never before. Schools of
Medicine, Law, and Dentistry were incorporated;
a School of Pharmacy became affiliated with the
University, and a legislative act established the
School of Engineering and Mines. WUP was
preparing for its halcyon days.

An unexpected innovation came with the com-
mencement of 1895, held in a downtown theatre.
Advised by Dr. Iohn Crocker White, President
of the Board of Trustees, that an important an-
nouncement would be forthcoming at the close
of the exercises, the audience had prepared it-
self for momentous news. They were surprised,
but not disappointed. Two young ladies had
applied for admission to WUP, and were ac-
cepted!

Under the chancellorships of Dr. William
Iacob Holland and Dr. Iohn A. Brashear develop-
ment continued. The necessity for expansion
again arose and in 1908 the University was
moved back across the river to Oakland and the
institution became the University of Pittsburgh.

Dr. Samuel Black McCormick was Chancellor
then. The ‘School of Business Administration,
the Graduate School, a teacher's training school,
and a School of Industrial Chemistry which later
became the Mellon Institute for Industrial Re-
search, were founded. In the decade following
the World War, enrollment at the University
was tripled.

Iohn G. Bowman became Chancellor of the
University which, like a lad in his teens, was

ll THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH—1937

out-growing everything. In 1921, when he as-
sumed office, the University was crowded into

one-fourth the space it needed for classrooms, .

laboratories, and offices. The need for new
buildings was greater than it had ever been.
Eight or ten new buildings were essential if the
University was to be adequately housed. The
Chancellor conceived a new idea—one building
tall and beautiful, and complete within itself-
The Cathedral of Learning. Ground was broken
in 1926, and today the Cathedral is in use. The
day when all the greatness of the building will
be utilized is not far off. On the same campus is
the Heinz Chapel, dedicated to the spiritual as-
pirations of all Pitt students. Adjoining is the
Stephen Foster Memorial, wherein are housed
the original manuscripts of the great Pittsburgh

" composer, and nearby is the new Mellon Institute

of Industrial Research.

Pitt has grown with the community it serves.
In 150 years both have become great. The ideals
out of which sprang the log cabin of 1787 gave
foundation to the Cathedral of Learning. The
log cabin served the Pittsburgh of its day, and
the subsequent growth of the city has been ac-
companied always by a corresponding growth
of the University. The 150 years which we com-
memmorate are years of progress, of growth, of
service, and of enlightenment.

“THE PITT PANTHER

 

IRENE M. MATVEAK JOHN L. GLASSER

IT is difficult to be seriousabout something which is itself never that way, but even a
humorous publication has a history and this must be set down in as serious a fashion
as the material available permits. In 1914 nineactive campus leaders conceived the idea
of a humorous publication, and the result was the Pitt Panther. Sid Hoehl and A. B.
Divvens, Editor and Business Manager, tried to carry out the purpose (as the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette commented) “to dispel the gloom of the students of the University." Miss
Beryl Pape carried on the editorial duties when most of the men went into training camps.
During her reign, the magazine ran afoul of the censors, who suspended publication the
next year. None of these early editions have been preserved.

Members of ODK, Honorary Activities Fraternity, took a hand in the situation and
set up the journal of which the present magazine is a direct descendant. In the early
numbers, poetry was the dominant means of expression, and the theme of “love" was the
subject of most of the poems. Cartoons had a kindergarten appeal and were without the
artistic touch. The 1923 editor, C. V. Starrett, dressed up the book considerably and made
it easier to read.

At about this time, the students went in for satire, and short stories. An “original
short story" was published in 1925 and labelled as such. A “Movie Number" had auto-
graphed photos of stars of the day.

By 1929, the editors were publishing a well-illustrated book of sixty-four pages.
The humor was sophisticated and risque jokes were passing out with the Flapper Age.
The price was twenty-five cents.

Came the depression and the price was reduced to ten cents, with an accompanying
reduction in the number of pages. At the present time, the price is the same, the average
number of pages is 30, the circulation is about two thousand an issue, and the incumbent
editor is Miss Irene Matveak, Ed.’37.

The magazine at the present time puts emphasis on satire and cartoons. The issues
this year have been varied in their content, including an Alumni number, a l50-Year-
Anniversary issue, a very clever Santa Claus issue (gifts of chewing gum, candy, cigar-
ette and pencil attached to the cover) and others equally as appealing. A special Cap
and Gown issue, including the scores of the hit songs from the production “Trailer Ho!"
was sold at the theatre as a souvenir program. The thirty-five staff members estimate
they spend about four weeks time a month preparing each issue. Contributions are
welcome from any student of the University.

 

Was it the news of a handsome be-

1 quest to W.U.P..P No; two young
ladies had applied, and were admit-
ted, to the University.

THE PITT NEWS

EDWIN H. BEACHLER

DAVID RACUSIN

he history of the “Pitt News," much like every other newspaper, is rich and full

in its ever shifting, changing interests. “The News" has timed the pulse of the

students, noted their reactions to the faculty, to the University, and to the many things
which the University represents.

Today, the student newspaper at this University has gone a long way from that day
in 1875 when a few pages bearing “The College Journal" ﬂagheads were pulled from
the ﬂatbed press of the print shop. Campus literary clubs edited that pioneering news-
paper in the early days, contributing bits of news, essays, poetry, and scraps of student
opinion. For seven years the publication progressed slowly, and then in 1882 the sheet
was enlarged and renamed the “Pennsylvanian Western." In 1888, a third change saw
the ﬂaghead of the student publication changed to the “University Courant." It was
still, however, a hybrid literary, newsless publication until Frank C. Stewart, '12, stepped
into the editorship on the new Oakland campus in 1910 and brought out the “Pitt
Weekly."

“The Weekly" was just about half the size of the present publication, but it was the
first attempt to make it a real newspaper. It progressed slowly until 1932 when a curly-
headed freshman, Ellis H. Tumpson, enrolled in the University, and that fall the “Pitt
Weekly" became the “Pitt News," a bi—weekly publication. When Tumpson stepped into
the business managership in his junior year, “The News” was made a tri—weekly, and
the groundwork for the establishment of a daily was laid.

Under the present editor Edwin Beachler, the “News" is striving to print real news,
guided by the dictates of good journalism, and the wishes of its readers. It is significant
to note that on Friday morning, December 4, the “Pitt News” really carried a “scoop"——
the cut of the Pitt varsity and the story that the Panthers had received the Rose Bowl
invitationébefore it appeared in the city newspapers.

The aim of the members of the present staff is to increase the scope of the paper and
to that end they have, during the current year, introduced new columns and features.
Among the most popular were “He Talks to Himself" by Milton Lehman, lr.; “Sound and
Fury" by James Donoghue; “Etcetera" by William Murray, and the curiosity—provoking
“Cherchez La Femme."

In 1897 (1 Mining Department was
added to the enlarged School of 148
Engineering. Two years later this
school was to become world famous.

With the coming of the new cen-
tury the energizing sentiment on
the W.U.P. campus was the neces-
sity of a larger school.

PITT PLAYERS

 

Back in the days when the men in the University were forming an Inter-collegiate
Prohibition Association, in 1916 to be exact, Pitt Players appeared on the University of
Pittsburgh campus. Whether the liquor problem was more important to the boys in
those days or whether the dyed-in-the-wool drama enthusiasts were few and far between
is a question. It is a fact, though, that the Players group did nothing remarkable until
1920, when they were reorganized. One-act plays were the rule until Mrs. McQueen
and Mr. Whited took charge. In 1924 they introduced the system whereby three or four
major plays are produced each year. This system has been in effect since, although
numerous one-act plays are often produced in addition to the major plays.

Mrs. McQueen gave up her director's duties in 1927, and Mr. Amundsen, who was
the director of Cap and Gown throughout most of the third decade of the century, was
made responsible for future productions. Tragedy, in the form of Mr. Amundsen's death,
led to the installation of Miss lane Ellen Ball, '27, as director the following year. The
group began making rapid strides forward and soon produced its first Shakespearean
drama. This was “A Midsummer Night's Dream," Pitt Players’ first and only attempt of
the Bard-of-Avon. The 1930-1931 year marked the arrival on campus of the present
director Professor Carl B. Cass. Heralded as one of the most capable directors in the
field, his seven years of production at the University have helped to place Pitt Players
on par with the ranking Little Theatre Groups of the City. Perhaps his most notable
production was the early nineteenth century comedy “F ashion," which rated a drama
page streamer headline in one of the metropolitan newspapers. The audience joined
in on the fun in that eighteenth century farce, songs were sung between acts, and all in
all, it was the merriest madcap performance ever produced at the University.

There have been many other productions in University drama history worthy of
note. “The Cradle Song" produced by Miss Ball in 1928 had one of its earliest trials in
the University theatre and created quite a stir in Pittsburgh dramatic circles. In 1929
the Players followed this with the world premier of “Black Flamingo" which later went
on to much success in amateur as well as professional circles.

Not only performers are served by this organization, for it offers students practical
experience in all forms of dramatic production and management. The wide field of play
production requires the cooperation of the entire unit and necessitates dividing the
group into three separate staffs: acting, business, and technical. Each division maintains
its own particular tryout requirements and student officers, a system which is of con
siderable aid in insuring more efficient operation.

Members of all staffs are united in the social group of the Players which sponsors
a dinner after each production, various general meetings, and a spring banquet at
which time officers are elected for the following year. Participation in a play or in the
business or technical activities connected with a production are the only requirements
for active membership in the social organization. Theta Alpha Phi, honorary dramatic
fraternity, taps into membership certain individuals in recognition of outstanding work
for the Pitt Players.

This year the organization under the direction of Mr. Cass and his assistant Mr.
Charles W. Foreman presented four plays reviewed separately in the following pages.

Murder and mystery made “Cock Robin," the season's initial offering of the Pitt
Players, popular and thrilling. The play, written by Elmer Rice and Philip Barry, was
staged at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, October 21

and 22, 1936.

Richard Lane and Hancock Robinson are both suitors for the hand of Carlotta, town
belle. When Robinson is killed during the performance of the “play within a play,”
suspicion immediately falls on Lane. Investigation and ”photographic eye" Maria Scott,
prove that each of eight members of the company had a motive for committing the murder.
The killer is not divulged until the last moment; the important clue is a pair of white
gloves, which ﬁnally lead to the disclosure that George McAuliffe, the stage director, for
whom no motive could be found, had borne a long-standing grudge against Hancock
Robinson.

Sharing honors with the ﬁne performances of Joseph Letteriello and Helen Akerman
were the technical staff's skillful and very effective lighting arrangements. Careful cast
selection and good interpretation of character made this a most auspicious beginning for
the Players.

Clever dialogue and subtle humor made St. John Ervine’s “The First Mrs. Fraser” a
dramatic success. This drawing-room drama about a husband who wanted the mature
judgment of his ﬁrst wife and the youth of his second was presented by the Players at
the Frick Training School Auditorium, Monday and Tuesday, November 23 and 24.

Janet, the ﬁrst Mrs. Fraser, is torn between a sense of loyalty and responsibility to
her selﬁsh husband and children and the heart-warming devotion of Philip Logan. Her
husband, after an unsuccessful second marriage to a woman ﬁfteen years his junior,
tries to resume his place in the home without reparation for the humility and pain he has
caused Ianet, his ﬁrst wife. He ﬁnds, however, he must win her love and trust all over
again.

Shirley Rugh and Michael Kozey turned in two of the best performances of the col-
legiate dramatic season. Mastering the sophistication needed for their difficult roles,
they drew praise from all critics.

“A Square Peg," a Lewis Beach drama, marked the debut of Charles Foreman,
Graduate Assistant to Mr. Cass and former undergraduate Players’ star, as a full-ﬂedged
director. Classed as a domestic tragedy, the play involves the members of the Huckins
family who are disintegrated and ruined by a domineering mother and a snooping,
sniveling aunt.

Misunderstood by his entire family, the father is driven to suicide. Daughter
Mildred's elopement and son Eugene’s departure leave Mrs. Huckins still blind to the
havoc she has caused.

A difficult play for a college group to stage, the cast handled the delicate theme
sensibly and well. Studied performances were given by Helen Akerman, Betty Knop,
and Charles Blaker. _

The play was enthusiastically received by the student audiences who crowded the
Frick Training School Auditorium on Wednesday and Thursday, February 24 and 25.

Soon the drive, headed by the stu-
dents, alumni, administration, and
outstanding Pittsburghers, gained 156
such momentum that only the reali-
zation of a new school could halt it.

The Pitt Players closed their season with the presentation of “Good-Bye Agai_i_1_,”
the Scott-Haight play which was acclaimed by critics and ran for two years on Broadway.
They presented the fast-moving, hilarious farce at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings, March 23 and 24. Mr. Cass in this, his third production of the
year, used a cast that was, for the most part, new to the local audience.

The plot concerns the misadventures of Kenneth Bixby, an author, who meets an
old sweetheart, Julie, in Cleveland where he is lecturing. He no longer cares for her,
his main interest now being his common-law wife and secretary, Ann, who combats and
triumphs over the amorous Julie, although Bixby does not refrain from paying some
regard to his former sweetheart. The complications which then developed afforded
many laughs. V

Andrew Cancelliere's.and lone Williams’ performances were noteworthy. The cast
also included Johnny Woodside, eight-year-old Falk Elementary School pupil. Critchtield
and Riley likewise gave able characterizations.

“Trailer Ho!" the 1937 production is a far departure from “In Wup1and," with which
Cap and Gown began its rather auspicious career 29 years ago. It was back in 1908
that Dr. John S. Ashbrook, '11, began to recognize a need among the student body for a
“Varsity" show. In that year he organized the Cap and Gown Club, whose annual
productions have’ since become Pitt tradition.

Although the original effort was rather humble, and played only one afternoon per-
formance, it nevertheless ﬁrmly planted the seed of Cap and Gown spirit. Between 1908
and 1912 the productions were “one night stands," but many men now prominent first
gave their services in those years’ and their interest in Cap and Gown has been con-
stantly maintained. It is interesting to note that the 1910 production, “Here and There,"
gave to Pitt the now nationally famous college _song, “Hail to Pitt." In 1912 G. Norman
Reis, '16, and Gus A. Schnabel, '15, began to collaborate on Cap and Gown shows, and
for several years Mr. Reis turned out the books and lyrics, while Mr. Schnabel was writ-
ing the musical scores.

In 1910 the club made a trip to Zelienople, Pa., but it was somewhat later that Cap
and Gown began to enjoy increasing recognition. As a result, another performance was
added each year, until in 1916 “Suite 16" was presented at the Schenley Theatre on three
successive evenings and one afternoon, and the club visited Altoona, Beaver Falls,
Duquesne, and Tarentum. Cap and Gown productions in 1920 and 1921 featured Regis
Toomey, '21, now famous as a motion picture star. “Done and Undone," the 1921 show,
also had as one of its principals Harvey Harmon, '21, now head football coach at the
University of Pennsylvania. That same year the club ventured a trip to Tarentum for two
performances and to Greensburg for one. These trips were so successful that a large
profit was realized, most of which was set aside in the interest of the University, and the
remainder was given to the Alumni Hall Building Fund.

The late Walter B. Edmundson made his introductory bow to Cap and Gown in 1923
and until 1929 he directed the shows and was undoubtedly responsible for the tremen-
dous improvement in production standards which was evidenced during that time.
The year 1923 is also important because of the undertaking of a full week of performances
in a Pittsburgh theatre.

By 1929 the annual productions had attained such importance that the old set-up
of the graduate club was no longer adequate. It was obvious that a complete re-organiza-
tion was necessary. Therefore, application was made to the Governor of Pennsylvania for
a corporate charter. Since that time the incorporated Cap and Gown Club of the Uni-
versity has been in full charge of the annual productions. Dr. John S. Ashbrook, founder _
of Cap and Gown, was elected as the first president of the new body, and upon his re- Eve" at tn?-9 ea”?! fiat? the
tirement two years later was made honorary life president of the club. %'f:ga1';‘;';'g?';;:d];'7‘:é"‘;f)‘:f.b{'l';;

Twenty-five years of growth were celebrated in 1932 with “Silver Domino," by Mr. bat,-Mg teams.

Reis and Louis M. Fushan, '23. Music was written by Mr. Schnabel, Dr. Benjamin Levant,
'19, and Iohn St. Peter, '31.

“All to the Point," 1933 production, is important for two reasons: First, its locale was
Pittsburgh in 1787, the year of the founding of the University, and second Gene Kelly,
'33, present director of Cap and Gown, appeared in it.

The Cap and Gown shows have always used original books, lyrics, and music,
contributed by students of the University or by alumni members of the club. The busi-
ness and dramatic departments of the productions are under the direct supervision of
the graduate club. It is estimated that Cap and Gown has played before 310,000 people
in its 29 years of existence.

This year Cap and Gown has again gone beyond Pittsburgh to serve Western
Pennsylvania. Beside a full week's engagement at the Nixon Theatre, the itinerary in-
cluded performances at Syria Temple, in Bradford, Pa., and in Erie, Pa.

MEN'S GT. 4. +. CLUB

The Glee Club, now in its forty-seventh year and distinguished as being “the oldest
non-athletic organization on the campus," has had a colorful existence. When organized
in 1890, by Iohn L. High, it was part of the combined music clubs. The individual music
clubs were not strong enough to present concerts separately, so the banjo, mandolin,
and glee clubs banded together for mutual beneﬁt. Apparently even this did not satisfy
the patrons because in addition the clubs brought to their concerts outstanding persons
of musical talent from outside the University. Dr. McCormick, the then Chancellor, was
very much opposed to such a policy and was, therefore, most unsympathetic toward the
organization. In defense, Mr. High, the director, issued a statement to the effect that the
Glee Club should always represent the best in musical entertainment, even to the extent
of being forced to bring in “ringers" to support the collegians, and that “the University
might well be proud of the day when it could boast of an all student club."

The day of which Mr. High spoke has long since arrived. Years have passed and
today the thought of a mandolin or banjo club is something unique and novel; but today
the University is proud of its well-balanced Glee Club of sixty voices——a self-sufficient
all student organization. The last step of uniﬁcation in the club's progress was taken
in 1927 when the Musical Club and the Dental Chorus were merged under the direction
of Dr. Walter H. Wright. Dr. Wright's capable direction can be regarded as being
responsible for bringing the club to its position of esteem. Mr. Theodore M. Finney is
now completing his first year at the University as Head of the Musical Appreciation
Department and Director of the Glee Club. His splendid work is recognizable and a
large measure of credit is certainly due him for the excellent programs the club has
presented, especially during its Spring season. The featured trip this year was the eastern
tour; concerts were given at the Philadelphia Academy of Music and at the Chalfant-
Haddon Hotel in Atlantic City. In addition to the popular Home Concert at Carnegie
Music Hall, the Club has been giving concerts throughout the Western Pennsylvania
area and has appeared frequently at University functions. The group closed the season
this year with an appearance as guest artists at the Pennsylvania College for Women's
Home Concert held in the chapel of the school.

Another well-known feature of the Glee Club is its fine quartet. Many demands
for the appearance of this small group—from Father and Son Dinners to School Assembly
programs——bespeak the excellent entertainment it provides and a wide appreciation of
its musical accomplishments and ability.

It would seem that the Glee Club is a training ground for Cap and Gown stars.
Included with those names of men who earned activity-points for service with the Glee
Club are Leo Cafferty, Bill Kunkle, Gene Burkhart, and John Werry, all of whom have
used the star's dressing room at the Nixon Theatre. The Glee Club has developed into
an organization which is acclaimed by critics and which brings great commendation to
the University from which its members spring.

In 1908 Allegheny was merged with

162 Pittsburgh. With the amalgamation
came the announcement of a change
in the University.

WOM N'S CHORAL

You have to put your do re mi's where they belong in any kind of scale to stand a
chance of even getting to‘ the first rehearsal of Women's Choral. Originally, the mem-
bers of the School of Education formed a Women's Glee Club to offer an outlet for the
musical talents of women on campus. But that was ever and ever so many years ago—
to be exact, twenty-one years ago. Today, any woman, whether she is in bizad, the
college, or engineering school may join the choral organization.

On Monday afternoons, if you are on the eleventh ﬂoor of the Cathedral you may
hear the folksongs, lullabyes, ballads, and hymnals of the group. For two hours, the
girls sing the songs they enjoy and Mrs. Robert D. Ayars directs the sopranos, contraltos,
and altos.

Composed of approximately fifty members from the sophomore, junior, and senior ,
classes; the choral is known for its harmony and achievements in the musical ﬁeld. l
Many campus groups as well as off-campus clubs and churches have been entertained ‘
by these future Lily Pons. Numerous University programs have been set off by the soft 
voices of the choralers. To banquets, luncheons, and meetings, these women have A
brought their songs to lighten the cares of their listeners.

Frequently, they have social gatherings and dinners of their own, making the
organization not only an efficient working unit, but a social one as well. Each year,
Women's Choral presents an annual home concert at Carnegie Music Hall which cli-
maxes the year's activities. The most recent of these concerts was in the form of a ballet
with the tale of the Sleeping Beauty as the theme. Puss-in-Boots in all his splendor and
the fair princess were the central figures in the ballet. The women's physical education ,
department worked in cooperation with the Choral and trained the dancers for the .f
ballet sequences. Colorful costumes and fine settings perfected the Women's Choral 3
presentation of Tchaikowski's Sleeping Beauty. Deviating from last year's principle of
presenting a ballet, the group will offer selections from various operas for this spring’s
annual home concert. These operatic selections will be something different from the 
traditional home concert of the Choral unit. At the conclusion of the year Women's 1
Choral keys are awarded to all women who have been members of the organization for

three years. Honorary keys and farewells round out the Women's Choral activities of
1936-37.

The change in name from W.U.P. 163
to the University of Pittsburgh was
formally declared.

 

 

The goal was reached on September
10, 1909, when the new University
moved to its present site and classes
were held for the first time in Thaw
Hall.

UNIVERSITY BAND

 

“The announcement of Chancellor McCormick in Chapel last Wednesday, that a
student band was being organized, was received by all departments with great en-
thusiasm. Interest, that has been smoldering among the students ever since the begin-
ning of the 1910 football season, has burst into ﬂame and we are to have a student band
at last. Donald C. Kirk, '13, through hard work has organized the band, which now con-
sists of 22 men. However, money is still needed for the heavier instruments. The Athletic
Committee will contribute half if the students will give the other half; so you see fellows,
it's up to us." So reads a “Pitt Weekly" of October 1911. The band made its first appear-
ance at the Pitt-Ohio Northern gridiron feud in uniforms which consisted of scarlet felt
hats with blue tassels. Their instruments were borrowed from Becher’s Music Store.
Such was the inception of what is now an indispensible feature of student life at Pitt.

It was destined to pass through three distinct stages before it could be lauded by
New York newspapers, in 1936, as the best band to march in the city for years. First,
there came to the University in 1917 Professor M. S. Rocereto to assume the duties of
director. During the war the band was discontinued, but re-organized immediately after-
ward. Outfitted with blue overcoats and then in blue and gold capes the band continued
its march down through the years gaining for itself new laurels each year. The final
change came in 1931 when the band was incorporated into the R.O.T.C. to improve its
faulty marching and general inaptitude. The musicians soon attracted wide attention by
their excellence in spelling out words by marching maneuvers. ‘Captain D. C. Treden-
nick deserves a large share of the credit for the improvement. In 1935 Lee M. Lockhart
succeeded the aging and kindly Professor Rocereto. Captain Tredennick's transfer
brought Captain K. P. Flagg to add glory to the 120 piece marching band by giving them
many new and intricate formations to amaze football crowds. After a fanfare by twelve
trumpeters the drum major brings his baton down smartly, and in an instant the ﬁeld is
ﬁlled with marching musicians who go through their formations. The band appeared at
Ohio State and F ordham this year as well as in our own capacity-filled stadium.

The band is a popular addition to any assembly and a radio-network feature. Con-
certs are given for numerous purpose throughout Western Pennsylvania as well as the
Annual Home Concert in Carnegie Music Hall. The organization is indeed a credit to the
University it represents.

UNIVERSITY one +'STRA

 

Founded in 1927 under Professor M. S. Rocereto in response to the demand for an
organization which could be called upon for various occasions, the University Symphony
Orchestra has contributed most generously of its services for the past ten years.

This year, the orchestra with its accomplished musicians has given musical support
to all Pitt Players’ productions. It has been called the “Chancellor's Orchestra" because
it presents an entertaining concert at the Chancellor's Reception for Freshman parents
at the beginning of the school year and also plays at the Chancellor's Reception for the
parents of the graduating Seniors at the close of the school year.

The Orchestra played over the CBS network for the program of the American Col-
lege Publicity Association during American Education Week and over the NBC network
during the Alumni Sesqui-Centennial Banquet, on February 25, 1937.

As a touring orchestra, it presented its music at local high schools including East
Pittsburgh, Evans City, Zelienople, Turtle Creek, and Carrick. Too much can not be
said about the spirit shown by the soloists, trios, quartettes, and chamber groups of the
Orchestra who demonstrated their versatility at the ODK banquet, and at the upperclass
Mothers’ Tea.

At the Annual Home Concert a well-balanced program of fine musical selections
was presented. With a farewell dance and dinner, the members gather for the adjourn-
ment ot a worthwhile musical and social activity which is tending, year by year, to be-
come a major activity at Pitt. As it grows, the University Symphony Orchestra succeeds
in bringing together accomplished musicians and stimulating a ﬁner appreciation of
instrumental music in the student body.

While naming the new University,

166 the board of directors named also a
new chalncelloreswmuel B. McCor-
mick. -

MORTAR BOARD

A black cap, a golden tassel, and a ﬂowing gown is the reﬂection in the mirror of
the Mortar Boarders. Symbolizing the seniority of its members, Mortar Board is the
national senior women's activities fraternity. During Commencement Week in the year
1916, Alpha Lambda Nu, a local women's activities fraternity was founded by a number
of seniors and juniors. In 1923 Alpha Lambda Nu became the University of Pittsburgh's
chapter of Mortar Board. The purpose of this organization is to advance spirit among the
seniors, to promote college loyalty, to recognize and encourage leadership, to honor fine
college women, and to set a definite scholarship standard which must be met by candi-
dates for membership. Not only do members of Mortar Board exemplify these character-
istics, but they render service to the University.

This yea.r’s chapter of Mortar Board began its season of service when the members
ushered at Commencement and aided at the Chancellor's Reception for the parent's of
seniors. The members also served as Senior Mentors to freshmen during the first eight
weeks of the first semester. At the Chancellor's Reception for the parents of freshmen,
members of Mortar Board were honorary aides. During the Community Fund Drive,
they acted as solicitors of student pledges. How to get a job and how to lose a job during
an interview was a feature of the Vocational Clinic for women at which these senior
women entertained the undergraduates with several skits presenting the various angles
of securing a position. On Scholar's Day Mortar Board acted as aides at the Congratu-
lations Hour Tea and guided visitors through the Cathedral during the Annual Alumni
Home-Coming celebration. Alums had a bird's eye view of the city and marveled at the
luxurious new libraries.

Then, too, Pittsburgh's chapter of Mortar Board honor senior women of high aca-
demic standing at a scholastic dinner. Graduation collars which will brighten the cap
and gown robes of senior women at the Commencement exercises were made by Mortar

 

Boarders.
Rummaging in attics, cupboards, and cellars, wearers of the Mortar Board, gathered

enough rummage for a most successful sale. The usual round of monthly meetings was
broken by a meeting at Phyllis Tabor's home. At these meetings the members, who are
representatives of all the leading campus activities for women, discuss campus problems.
At one meeting Miss Ellen W. Fernon, Swarthmore '31, who is Section director of Mortar
Board spoke of her experiences at other Mortar Board chapters. Previous to the meeting,
Miss Fernon had lunch with the faculty advisers, and then held a series of appointments
with the executive committee. In accord with its ideals, Mortar Board does not aim to
be as active as other organizations; rather it acts as an integrating force for women's

activities.

While the whole country was reap-
ing the pleasures of post war prof-
its, the University was weighed
down with a tremendous debt and
an urgent need for more space.

OMICRON DELTA KAPPA

When a prominent Senior with his coat open displays conspicuously a familiar
gold key he is almost certain to be recognized as a member of Omicron Delta Kappa,
men's national honorary activities fraternity. Founded in 1914 at Washington and Lee
University to recognize men who have attained a high standard of efficiency in collegiate
activities and to inspire others to strive for conspicuous attainments along similar lines,
the O.D.K. idea spread like wildfire until chapters were located in forty different
American colleges and universities. Gamma circle of Omicron Delta Kappa was estab-
lished in 1916 at the University of Pittsburgh to bring together members of the faculty
and outstanding men of the student body on a basis of mutual interest and understanding.

Starting at the end of the first period on Thursday morning, November 24, fourteen
names were posted every half hour on Omicron Delta Kappa’s key on Activities Walk
between State and Thaw Halls. In honor of the occasion, tappees and members of the
O.D.K. circle wore blue Carnations and pledge bars. Initiation of the tappees took place
at the annual Founders’ Day Banquet, December 7, at the Hotel Schenley. Dr. Robert
C. Clothier, President of Rutgers University and former Dean of Men at Pitt, addressed
the fraternity.

This year O.D.K. continued to hold a place of eminence on the campus. The
smoothness with which the University functions were run this year can be attributed, in
a large measure, to O.D.K..brothers who served as aides. Their dignity and experience
in supervising the general spring elections have been recognized and appreciated both
by the faculty and the student body. Omicron Delta Kappa also supervises and sponsors
the selection of the Senior Award although the actual selection is made by representatives
oflthe Dean of Men's office and the faculty. Business luncheon meetings are held twice
a month.

The highlight of the season's activities was the national convention held at the
Biltmore Hotel, Atlanta, Georgia, attended by C. Stanton Belfour, Albert Barr, David
Racusin, Edwin Beachler, Harry Robinson and John Glasser of the University's Gamma
Circle. Mr. Belfour acted as Chairman of the Nominations Committee and Mr. Barr
served on the Credentials Committee at the convention. All the delegates reported that
the reputation borne by “southem hospitality" is justified.

Omicron Delta Kappa ended the year's activities with an initiation banquet held
at the College Club in May. Those men tapped on Spring Festival Tap Day were inducted
into the organization with the formal ritual which preceded the dinner.

CWENS

In Anglo-Saxon times, throughout the courts of England, ladies were called Cwens.
With the passing of centuries, the terms have changed, though the meaning has not,
and now in modern times, on the campus of the University, Cwens are called ladies.
These ladies, recognized by their colors, silver and garnet; and by their symbols, the
crown and sceptor, are sophomore women. They are tapped to the honorary society
of Cwens because of their lovely manners, their spirit of cooperation, their promise of
leadership, and their records of scholarship. It is the purpose of Cwens to promote
these same qualities among the women of the freshman class, and to be, in every way,
ladies of service. In keeping with this spirit of service, during the year 1936-37, twenty-
seven Cwens acted as aides at numerous University functions. At the High Tea for
freshman women in September, Cwens donned summer formals to help greet the new
women and their senior mentors. While the parents of freshman men and women received
their off-spring's grades, Cwens played the role of hostess offering ice cream and
pastries to sooth the anxious parents. One of the highlights of the year was the national
convention held at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, which was attended by Dorothy
Dering, president of this year's chapter, Mary Jane Beachler, president of the chapter
of 1935-36, and Thyrsa Agness Amos, Cwen '35-'36. At the convention a new con-
stitution and ritual were set up, and a reorganization of the national organization was
brought about during the business sessions. And once again, the wearers of the crown
and sceptor published their annual directory with the name, address, phone number,
school and year of each woman on campus. Good salesmanship plus a lot of hard work
sold 400 of the red bound booklets for these active Cwens. Santa Claus visited the girls
and their Christmas party was most successful. “Trains, bells, and whistles" were
gratefully received by the sophomores. In February a get aCWENted party was held for
incoming freshmen and the month before the Druids and Cwens collaborated on a tea
dance at the Rainbow Room of Webster Hall. Still later in the year, the Carnegie Tech
sister chapter, invaded the campus to attend King Arthur's Round Table. On Activities
Tap Day, worthy freshman women receive red carnations fastened to a necklace of
silver and garnet. Then Cwens bid farewell to their active membership, by initiating
tappees at a banquet of the crown and sceptor.

 

In 1921, in the very midst of this
crisis, Dr. John G. Bowman, became
chancellor of the School that was
outgrowirig itself.

DRUIDS

Although the name dates back two thousand years to a European religious cult, the
Druids we know today is of comparatively recent origin. ‘In 1907 a group of prominent
sophomores at Pennsylvania State College decided to form an honorary fraternity, member-
ship in which was to be conferred upon those freshmen who had distinguished themselves
by service to their school during their first year on a campus.

Delta Chapter at the University was chartered in 1920 and is the second oldest
chapter in the organization. The group quickly assumed a role of importance on the
campus.

In 1930 the national convention, with six other chapters in attendance, was held on
the Pitt Campus. Membership rosters in the past have carried many outstanding names,
among them the names of such athletic luminaries as Joe Donchess, Charley Hyatt, and
Alec Fox.

Druid activities are of a varied nature. This year the Druids opened their season
with the smoker for incoming freshmen, which has come to be an annual event awaited
with much eagerness. Dr. “Iock" Sutherland, himself a Druid, delighted the new men
who gathered in the Logan Armory with several football yarns, as only he can tell them.
Dr. Cliff Carlson and several campus activity leaders—Ed Beachler, News Editor, Stan
Rogaliner, Owl Editor, and Arthur Kelley, President of Pitt Players,—also addressed the
assembled guests. Four men were tapped at the smoker: Francis Durkin, Ray Light,
lames Markezin, and Richard Rhoda.

Several tea dances were sponsored by the wearers of the skull and cross bones,
(the Druid emblem) and it was at one of these affairs that Dr. John Geise and Mr. Robert
Graham were tapped as honorary members.

President Len Levison and Sid Tumpson, Conclave Chairman, formulated the plans
for the national convention of Druids held on the campus late in the Spring. The primary
purpose for the venture was to instill new life into the dormant national organization.
All the active chapters were represented and effort is being exerted by them to reestab-
lish those which have lapsed into inactivity. Other aims of the conclave were to redraft
the constitution, to elect new national officers and to provide the national organization
with a permanent secretary. ,

The growing importance of extra-curricular activities as a vital part of a well-rounded
education places a new value on Druids, because it is the organization which spurs
freshmen to enter activities early in order to fulfill the requirements for admission.

 

With the coming of the new ad-

171 ministration -new blood was pumped
into the hardening veins of an old
school.

 

Debts were cleared and in a very
short time proposals for new build-
ings were called for by Dr. Bow-
mom.

   

UNDERGRADUATE CAP AND GOWN CLUB

Wig waving and the strains of Alma Mater had ceased. The asbestos curtain slid
silently into place as the noisy crowd keeping time with the orchestra pushed its way
toward the exits of the Nixon Theater. Another Cap and Gown success was history. To
prevent the complete loss of interest until a month before the next show, a small number
of outstanding performers organized the Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club in 1927.
Members of this club have been vitally interested in improving the show for the student
body. For that purpose men were tapped to membership who were recognized as out-
standing in the production of the show. Until this year to be eligible for tapping, a record
of two years service in the cast or chorus or three years on the production staff was
necessary. Another activity of the club is to act in an advisory capacity during the
active production of the show. There is something about a Cap and Gown show that
gives spirit and enthusiasm backstage as connoted by the old cry, “Reform, Reform,,we'll
reform the world." That is what the Undergraduate Club endeavors to capture and
nurture.

This past year the group broke away from tradition when men who had only one
year's experience in a Cap and Gown production were tapped to membership. Another
innovation was made by the Undergraduate Club under the direction of President Ben
Baskin. Rumors spread that the club was going to give a dance, not a common ordinary
run-of-the-mine affair, but a costume dance, something new for this generation of stu-
dents. The list of names as committee members included those of quite a few of the
school's most fair and energetic ticket salesladies. From these goodwill agents students
purchased ducats for the dance which was held at the Pittsburgh Country Club, October
thirtieth, with a new dance band sensation, Charles Pallos, occupying the band stand.

An initiation banquet for those men tapped at the dance was held at the Cathedral
Mansions on December tenth. Movies of last year's show featured the program. Later
in the year Bill Kunkel made arrangements for a little tea dancing at Webster Hall and
the usual crowd of tea dancers were in attendance. With attainment, personality, and
loyalty as membership qualiﬁcations, President Baskin announced the Cap and Gown
Club recruits in an impressive Tap Day ceremony during Spring Festival Week.

JOHN MARSHALL CLUB

Lawyers, those garrulous guardians of our personal and civil rights, deem it nec-
essary to begin one's training when ambition is strong and fresh. As a result, pre-legal
students on the University of Pittsburgh campus, organized John Marshall Club in 1921.
Those early aspirants to the heights attained by the immortal Chief Justice John Marshall,
proposed as their purpose and ideal, “to promote closer union between pre-legal
students and to broaden the outlook which these students may have, by presenting before
them men worthy of acclaim in their respective callings."

Early in the club's history, therefore, at their regular noon luncheons, prominent
legal ﬁgures including Judge Gustav L. Schramm, together with progressive business
men, gave the members an insight into the profession of law and strove to create closer
social relations between student and lawyer. These customs and ideals have remained
steadfastly unchanged in the present club. The organization has grown to 30 active
members in the sixteen years since its inception. _ .

This year's activities began auspiciously on October 28, with a student reception
chairmanned by Stanley D. Rogaliner. All students interested in Law were invited to
the affair which was held in the new home of the Law School on the fourteenth floor of
the Cathedral. Sixteen students were tapped to membership and were later entertained
at an Initiation Banquet held at the College Club on January 8, 1937. This latter affair
featured an address by Judge Elder W. Marshall of the Court of Common Pleas of
Allegheny County, whose subject was “The New Year in the Courts." On another
cszfcfzlasion, Sheriff Frank I. Gollmar spoke to the group on “The Functions of a Sheriff's

ce."

The club has made a determined effort to contact other schools, seeking other pre-
legal groups in the hope of nationalization for John Marshall. Members are recruited
from all political science and economics classes. Applicants must have forty-ﬁve credits
and a quality point average of 1.6 to be eligible for membership.

Those tapped at the last Scholar's Day Tapping include: Charles Allen, Leonard
Berkowitz, John Cochrane, Dominic Cupelli, John Fullerton, Esther Goldhaber, Marshall
Greco, Sidney Herskowitz, Ruth Hilsenrath, Harold Hoffman, Paul Kromer, Melvin
Levine, James Marquis, Harry Miller, Herbert Parnes, Herbert Rackoff, William
Schmalzried, Brooks Sipes, Bree Smith, Nicholas Spanos, John Spina, Edward Springer,
Jeannette Swartz, Walter Toerge, and Samuel Werlinich.

SCABBARD AND BLADE

Since sabers first ﬂashed into the traditional military arch through which marched
27 advance corps men to form the charter membership of D Company, 7th Regiment, of
Scabbard and Blade eight years have passed. The men so honored were all members
of Alpha Delta Epsilon, a military fraternity, started ten years before by a group of cadet
officers in the Coast Artillery unit at Pitt. To develop the esprit de corps within the
corps, to further the aims of the National Defense Act, and to promote social activities
among its members was the threefold purpose of A.D.E. This organization brought about
an increased interest in military affairs at the University and is credited as being respon-
sible for Pitt's winning the cup for general excellence in 1922, 1926, and 1927 at Fort
Monroe during summer camp. The arrival of Major L. P. Horsfall for duty at the Uni-
versity put renewed vigor and life into the military department. He suggested the colorful
and popular Military Ball, reorganized the inactive A.D.E., and made members of the
Medical Corps eligible for tapping into the fraternity which had Herbert Hoover,
General John I. Pershing, and Major General Leonard Wood as honorary members.

In 1929 when D. Company, 7th Regiment was chartered at Pitt, it endeavored not
only to bring into being a closer organization and relationship among the various military
departments scattered through our American universities and colleges as set forth in
its constitution, but also to weld its own department into a closer unit. It strives to develop
in its members the qualities of efficient officers and to prepare them to give military
information in their communities. Only outstanding men in the advance corps are
tapped to membership. Fall tapping follows a banquet, winter tapping occurs at the
annual winter dance, and spring tapping is at the annual University Tap Day during
Spring Festival Week.

Regardless of when men are tapped, none escape the rigorous “hell week" that
is climaxed by a night in South Park where strange things happen. Aspiring Juniors
this year were introduced to their activities at a smoker in Trees Gym prior to the winter
tapping at the formal dance at the Pines. Alex Leggin and Howard Auld journeyed as
delegates to the convention at North Carolina University during the ﬁrst semester

this year.

qonfronted with this challenging

174 situation, Dr. Bowman envisaged a
skyscraper university, a growth up-
ward instead of outward.

DELTA SIGMA RHO

The academic world has long prided itself on having discovered a fundamental
distinction between man and beast. The‘ human race, it is said, possesses a singular and
somewhat abused attribute, commonly referred to as the “gift of gab." In an effort to
develop this distinguishing characteristic, Delta Sigma Rho was established “to encourage
sincere public speaking."

Professors Eugene E. McDermott of the University of Minnesota, and Henry E.
Gordon of the University of Iowa are the gentlemen to whom credit is due for the founding
of this Honorary Forensic Society. It was in an exchange of letters, in 1904, that each, un-
known to the other, proposed the formation of such an intercollegiate organization.
Delegates from seven universities met at the Victoria Hotel, in Chicago, on Friday, April
13, 1906. Carefully prepared rules of procedure and organization were adopted. These
men, possessed of the highest of ideals, wished not merely to found a professional society,
but an honor group to be controlled largely by the alumni and the faculty sponsors in
arts colleges of standard grade. Membership was only to be extended to those who had
actively participated in some intercollegiate forensic contest, thereby eliminating so
called “honorary” members.

By 1911 fifteen chapters were enrolled and sent representatives to the meeting held
at Northwestern University. It was decided at this session, to publish an official magazine,
“The Gavel," which has since appeared quarterly and is sent free to all members.

A chapter was founded at the University of Pittsburgh in 1920. Dr. Parrish and Mr.
Murphy, who proved guiding lights to better speech on our campus, were recently
honored by Delta Sigma Rho. They were presented with gavels as those members of the
Alumni most deserving of honor in the furtherance of speech perfection.

The Pitt Chapter has actively participated in the national conventions which are
held every three years. St. Louis played host to the most recent assembly, at which Miss
Theresa Kahn, Women's Debating Coach, acted as Pitt's representative. Matters con-
cerning the financial status of the organization and recent trends in debating were dis-
cussed. Miss Kahn was honored by election to a Vice-Presidency on the Executive Board.

A number of Intercollegiate Debates were sponsored by the Pitt Chapter in 1934-35.
Under the guidance of the National Group, two regional debates have been held on the
Pitt Campus in recent years. Last Scholars’ Day marked the tapping of Miss Ieannette
Swartz, Mr. Robert McKee, Mr. Ben Siegel, and Mr. William Stark.

Dr. Bowman, with his characteris- 175
tic determination, began efforts to
transform his dream into a reality.

SIGMA GAMMA EPSILON

 

Sigma Gamma Epsilon believes that students of the sciences of geology, mining,
metallurgy, ceramics, and petroleum engineering should be associated together for the
better accomplishment of the aims that are common to these kindred sciences. From
the Alpha Chapter, 1915, at the University of Kansas grew a strong national fraternity
of thirty chapters scattered throughout the United States and Canada at schools having
major courses in ceramics and petroleum engineering. A society that endeavors to
strive for such commendable objects as Sigma Gamma Epsilon does is certain to be
held in high esteem by all. The fraternity intends to further the social, as well as the
scholastic and scientiﬁc advancement of its members. Extension of the relations of
friendship and assistance between the universities and scientiﬁc schools with recognized
standings in the United States and Canada are also stressed as objectives to be attained.
On such a firm foundation was the upbuilding of a national college society made possible
in the kindred sciences that Sigma Gamma Epsilon embraces. Four times each year
thirty letters arrive at Columbia, Missouri, addressed to Professor W. A. Tarr who is the
Grand Editor of the fraternity's magazine, the “Compass."

The University of Pittsburgh is the home of the Beta Chapter. Dean Miller of the
School of Engineering in 1921 interested a group of students in the idea of a fraternity
similar to the one at the University of Kansas. Their application for a charter was honored
and so the second link in the chain of brotherhood was forged. Although classed as an
honorary fraternity, Beta as well as the_ma]'ority of chapters, favor the classification of
being professional in nature as well ‘as in scope, although the constitution states clearly
the high scholarship requirements necessary for admission to membership. The fact
that Sigma Gamma Epsilon is the only society in geology, mining, metallurgy, ceramics,
and petroleum engineering to recognize outstanding men in these departments makes
membership highly desirable. On the second Tuesday in each school month the members
of Sigma Gamma Epsilon gather to hear eminent speakers in engineering and geology
from all parts of the country talk about the problems of the “mineral industries." In the
spring when a young man's thoughts become slightly confused with thoughts other than
rock formations, mining production problems, or well drilling, Sigma Gamma Epsilon
steps quickly into the breach and holds a dance in an attempt to solve the problem. A
deﬁnite sign of the increasing importance of Sigma Gamma Epsilon is found at mineral
industries’ conventions where the Sigma Gamma Epsilon key is worn by an increasing
number of prominent convention figures.

SIGMA TAU

February 22 is a day of double rejoicing for every engineer! Not only does it
commemorate the birth of our first President, but it heralds the inception of Sigma Tau,
thirty-three years young this Spring. It was just four years past the turn of the century,
that an adventurous group of Nebraska students ignited the ﬂame that was to carry the
name of Sigma Tau blazing across the country.

Establishing as their objectives, recognition of scholarship, promotion of an organi-
zation for advancement of the engineering school, and good fellowship among their
members, these modern pioneers laid the groundwork for the great national honorary
fraternity which now embraces 22 chapters. Nationwide solidarity is strengthened by
the quarterly publication “Pyramid" inaugurated in 1914 at the National Conclave.

But enough of national history, when the University Psi Chapter presents such a
progressive, vibrant picture of engineering life at Pitt. Established but six short years
ago, it has bounded forward not only as a leader in its own sphere, but as an influential
campus organization. It sired the Engineering Cabinet, composed of the six departments
in the School of Engineering for the purpose of presenting a united front in University
activities. Friendships, school spirit and professional pride have been fostered under
the maternal guidance of Sigma Tau. Distinguished graduate engineers have been
elected to honorary membership to acquaint them with the ideals and activities of Sigma
Tau and to further engineering education through their interested cooperation. The
yearly activities are as varied as they are interesting. Each semester a pre-initiation
smoker is held to acquaint the lower classmen with the purposes of the fraternity, and to
afford the exacting members an opportunity to scrutinize the prospective pledges. No
limitation is placed on the number of members at Pitt, and this year's enrollment included
55 active participants.

After tapping, the pledges present an entertainment program at a meeting preceding
the banquet which celebrates the formal initiation ceremony. The annual dance is held
in Heinz House on Saint Patrick's Day, a ﬁtting day for all engineers to honor their patron
saint.

Last November President lohn Albright was rewarded with a trip to Stillwater,
Oklahoma, to attend the National Conclave; and this year Sigma Tau presented Louis
E. Reilly and John A. Beager with awards for superior scholarship attainment during
their freshman year. The Psi Chapter plans a monument to be raised when campus
building plans are settled, but the past accomplishments are a living memorial and
tribute to the ideals of the fraternity.

BETA GAMMA SIGMA

The national organization of Beta Gamma Sigma was founded on the eighteenth
day of May, 1907, by A. L. Somers, a student at the University of Wisconsin. When a
petition was ﬁled with the Commerce faculty of Wisconsin, Professors Burchell, Gilman
and Scott, the faculty authorized the formation of an honor society, known as Beta Gamma
Sigma, which name was taken directly from the first letters of each of the three professors.
To quote the national constitution, the purpose of Beta Gamma Sigma “shall be to
encourage and reward scholarship . . . to promote the advancement of education in
the science of business, to foster principles of honesty and integrity in business practice.
. . . " In thirty years of organization, Beta Gamma Sigma has grown until at the present
day there are 42 chapters in the schools of Business Administration of the leading
Universities throughout the country. In 1933, Gamma Epsilon Pi, a national honorary
women's Commerce Society was consolidated with Beta Gamma Sigma and the national
Constitution of Beta Gamma Sigma was amended to include women among its member-
ship as well as men. Active membership in each local chapter of Beta Gamma Sigma
is restricted to the upper two percent of the Junior class registration and to the upper ten
percent of the Senior class registration of each school which maintains a chapter. The
national organization publishes the “Beta Gamma Sigma Exchange.”

The Beta chapter of Pennsylvania was installed at the University of Pittsburgh on
May 3, 1920. In the last five years the local chapter has been officered by its faculty
members. This plan is in pursuance of a request by the national organization in order
to provide for a continuity of policy. The only exception is the office of Vice President
to which an undergraduate is annually elected. The initiation ceremony includes a
banquet followed by addresses by the new initiates. The local chapter sponsors the
Freshman Scholarship Award given to the Freshman ranking highest in the School of
Business Administration. The award was given last year to Charles R. Lynch.

PI TAU PHI

Pi Tau Phi, College scholastic honorary, was organized in 1925 as an all-University
organization. It continued in that capacity for several years, tapping eligible students
at each Scholar's Day assembly.

In 1932 Pi Tau Phi became exclusively a College honorary, because the other
University schools had already established their own scholastic organizations.

The membership policy of the fraternity is highly restrictive. To be eligible, the
student must have at least a 2.2 average. Character and participation in student activities
are also considered when the fraternity taps new members.

In addition to the recognition of academic achievement, Pi Tau Phi sponsors a
stimulating series of monthly meetings. At these gatherings, prominent scholars in
various ﬁelds of knowledge speak, giving the members a broader viewpoint.

This year at the Scholar's Day assembly, the following students were tapped into
membership: Margaret E. Alston, Morton D. Bluestone, John D. Cochran, Marion S.
Dithridge, Conrad A. Etzel, Israel Glick, Morris A. Goldstein, David M. Ienkins, Ir.,
Sixt F. Kapff, Sidney S. Kaufman, Kenneth Kneebone, Aloysius A. Kuenzig, Joseph F.
McCloskey, Robert K. Moorhead, Karl W. Punzak, Herbert Rackoff, Margaret D.
Robertson, Ruth E. Rosenthal, Betty Seibert, Irwin A. Solow, Susan Soyak.

Nearby the Cathedral is the Heinz
Memorial Chapel, erected by the
Heinz family, patterned after the
celebrated Sainte Chapelle of Paris.

 

CHI RHO NU

Medicine is a profession involving great responsibility, and only through intense
interest in his work will the young medical student be able to assume the coveted title
of “M.D." To sustain the first enthusiasm and interest of the pre-med and to acquaint
him with the size of his responsibility were the aims of numerous small groups prior to
1922. For in 1923 was chartered the Chiron Club which had for its purpose the idea
of welding the various small groups into a unified organization that could render a more
useful service. In 1930 another change occurred when the name Ch Rho Nu was adopted
and the group was recognized as an honorary fraternity by the University. Throughout
fifteen years of organization the fraternity has endeavored to perpetuate an interest in
the medical profession.

Working under the leadership of Spence Liddell the fraternity has been engaged
in various activities. On campus, weekly luncheon meetings have presented the members
opportunities to hear distinguished speakers review extensively the various ﬁelds of
medicine. Prominent physicians and professors have lectured at their meetings. Tours
through Mayview and to clinics at the West Penn and Mercy Hospitals were high spots
on the calendar and heavily attended.

All the pre-meds feel that it is a distinct honor to be tapped to Chi Rho Nu. Freshmen
leave the annual smoker inspired and determined to attain the necessary two point
average for here they learn that the Chi Rho Nu purpose is, “to foster friendship among
pre-medical students, to further the general welfare of the members and to stimulate an
active interest in the medical profession.” The twenty-six new members who were tapped
at the Annual Scholar's Day Assembly were honored at an initiation banquet at Webster
Hall this year. This year Chi Rho Nu members exerted great effort in order that their
Spring dance would be as successful as those held in previous years. Chi Rho Nu is
continually seeking to increase the satisfaction and high esteem with which the fraternity
is regarded.

KAPPA PHI KAPPA

Kappa Phi Kappa fraternity is professional as well as honorary in scope—~professional
because it invites to membership only men interested in education, and honorary because
it chooses its members from among persons whose scholastic averages are high. Tau
chapter of the national honorary was established at the University in May, 1926. It has
the names of 18 undergraduates and six faculty members inscribed upon its charter.
Tau chapter has been outstanding for its marked accomplishments in developing and
promoting interest in professional education among the men students in the School of
Education at our university. Since its founding in 1922 the national organization has
grown to include 42 active chapters at prominent universities and colleges throughout
the nation.

At Pitt the chapter has a planned and rounded program of activities. It holds regular
monthly meetings for the purpose of promoting educational interest, better fellowship.
social and civic leadership. A smoker is held each semester so that the actives may have
an opportunity for observing the underclassmen away from the schoolroom atmosphere,
At the first smoker George Wheeler, an active, told about his experiences in Berlin as a
member of the United States Olympic Gym team. Frank Adams, president, was a dele-
gate in November to the General Assembly of the fraternity at the Hotel Tutwieler in
Birmingham, Alabama.

Education students await eagerly the annual day of recognition, Scholars’ Day,
when Kappa Phi Kappa taps to membership men it deems worthy. Dinner meetings in
March and April bring prominent men in secondary education to speak before the
organization. The curtain falls on the year's activities when the annual spring dance in
May is over, and the new officers have been ceremoniously inducted. The retiring
members feel that Kappa Phi Kappa has definitely contributed to the University and to
education in general.

SIGMA KAPPA PHI
    Not content in merely providing us with Rose Bowl opponents, the State of Washington has given the cultural world a great national fraternity, Sigma Kappa Phi. For it was
at Washington State College in 1919, that a far-sighted group of foreign language students
crystalized a desire for mutual cooperation and merited recognition in the form of a
national fraternity.
    Hardly a year had rolled by, when, in the Fall of 1920, our own Beta Chapter was
organized. Rapidly rising to a place of singular importance in fraternity affairs, national
affiliation in June, 1921, was a mere formality. The constitutional objectives, which have
proved such an inspirational and cohesive force in Sigma Kappa Phi, include: the
promotion of a high standard of scholarship among students in the Department of Foreign
Languages and the creation of a spirit of unity and cooperation among students pursuing
such courses.
    The words select and active typify Sigma Kappa Phi. Monthly dinner meetings in
the Y.M.C.A. Club rooms are distinguished by the reading of papers and discussions,
and climaxed by tasty meals prepared by the girl members.
    Scholastic requirements for membership are exceedingly high, both in the language
major itself, and in all subjects in general. Only forty undergraduates or graduates are
included each year, of whom not more than twenty percent may be faculty members.
    Scholar's Tap Day held annually every year, marks the introduction of new pledges,
and the awarding of medals to the four Senior students having the highest average in
the respective languages.
    The year's activities was featured this year as in the past by an open house carnival
held in the Heinz House. All students in the foreign language department meet and
present a varied program of entertainment including songs, readings, and appropriate
plays.
    Those selected at Scholar's Day include: Betty Atwater, Juanita Carpenter, Loraine
Clatty, Mildred Corbin, Helen Couchenour, Anna Mae Dambroski, Mary Adele Ehrenfield, Florence Ehrler, Hazel Ehrler, Sister Fleckenstein, Maurice Friedlander, Dorothy
Greene, Germaine J. Guenin, Tillie Horowitz, Elsie Jacob, Noah Jacobs, Dorothy Kerr,
Dolly Kiedasch, Paul Kromer, Ray Maize, William Panetta, Marian Price, Ruth Raup,

                                                      scope, maintaining now Johnstown

                            Who are they? Members of Quax, of course, honorary science fraternity for women.
                            With the end of the Great War, women felt it necessary to know more about science and
                            to increase the number of women in its various fields. Scientific interest was spread by
                            the women who organized Quax in 1919 to create and maintain that same interest among
                            science majors toward further research. Through a survey made in 1935 it was found
                            that the inspiration received in 1918-19 from Dr. L. E. Griffin's weekly Biology Seminar
                            by the founders, continues to be fulfilled.
                                Quax, as an honorary, holds a unique place among the campus activity groups
                           since its purpose is not only to recognize girls for their outstanding ability, but, also to
                           foster this ability and help them find a niche in their chosen fields. In 1935, members
                           of Quax found their aim for that year could be put to an excellent use, if they could gather
                           together facts, which would definitely state the way to "win a place in the sun of oppor                           tunity for social service." This was accomplished in "Quax Query," a book presenting
                           the requirements in many different fields of science for obtaining and holding a place
                           in that sun.
                                Through a recent survey of the Alumnae it was found that ten per cent have earned
                            either M.A. or M.S. degrees and five percent have the degrees of M.D.
                                This year's group has made numerous trips to points of scientific interest. Peering
                            at the stars through the telescope at Allegheny Observatory, visiting remote corridors
                            at the Carnegie Museum, and scientific testing in University laboratories has been the
                            general program. On Scholars Day, Helen Bondra, F. Elizabeth Bower, Jane Denny,
                            Marian Dithridge, Verna Douglas, Elizabeth Fisher, Zelda Gutmacher, Lois Joyce, Erma
                            Kovalik, Clara Marshall, Jane Millward, Electra Panagotacos, Virginia Ramsey, and
                            Mary Theiss, were tapped to Quax. These fourteen tappees were pledged and initiated
                            into the science honorary to pursue their interests in the field of their first choice.
                      When the W.U.P. was formally
                      dedicated in 1822, its faculty num                      bered five professors. The U. of P.

                         of Learning were opened for use.
                                                    KAPPA ALPHA PHI
                        Kappa Alpha Phi was founded at Georgetown University's Foreign Service School
                    in 1920. The purposes of this professional commerce fraternity have been to perpetuate
                    an association among students primarily interested in some phase of commerce and to
                    maintain for the benefit of such students a closer relationship that will better fit them for
                    their chosen vocation. Gamma chapter of Kappa Alpha Phi was installed on the campus
                    in 1924, evolving from a group of men who called themselves the Tunists. A high
                    scholastic standard has been maintained by this group for over thirteen years. During
                    the past semester this fraternity ranked second scholastically among all fraternities in
                    the University. The activities of Kappa Alpha Phi are not confined to scholarship alone.
                    Social functions play an important part in the group activities and a gala formal held in
                    the latter part of May concludes the year's events.. Athletically, the fraternity ranks high
                    in intramural sports.' The fraternity's extra-curricular program includes a series of
                    forums at which persons connected with the civic life of Pittsburgh are the guest speakers.

         DELTA DELTA LAMBDA
     On November 27, 1934, junior and senior students in the commercial department
were petitioned for their opinions on organizing a commercial education fraternity.
Over 40 students expressed a desire to have such an organization on the campus and
pledged their support in the undertaking. The group decided that the fraternity would
take for its name the Greek letters Delta Delta Lambda, the initials of its friend and
teacher, D. D. Lessenberry, faculty adviser of the group. The purposes of the group were
set forth and a constitution drawn up. On March 2, 1935, the University of Pittsburgh
officially recognized Delta Delta Lambda. From this date the fraternity has gone ahead
rapidly, and now is one of the most active honoraries on campus.
    The first affair of this school year was an initiation banquet held at Webster Hall
in November. At this affair Dean Charles S. Tippetts, Dean Charles E. Prall, and Mr.
Lessenberry spoke briefly. In April Delta Delta Lambda held its second social function
of the year. This was an initiation ceremony and supper-dance at the William Penn
Hotel. The activities of this honorary are not confined to social affairs, as business
meetings are held twice a month.
    Those members recently initiated include: Blodwen Angus, Martin Cynkar, Elvina
K. Helbling, Dorothy Loose, Bernice Thoma, Ruth A. Yingling, Mary A. Ehrenfeld,
Margaret Kranack, Helen Kulik, Joseph H. Morrow, Michael Radvansky, Idella Rome,

    The first permanent organization for creative literary writing made its appearance
on the University of Pittsburgh campus in 1921, when a chapter of Quill Club, national
honorary literary fraternity, was established. This group of lovers of the best in literature
was aided by the noted author John Frederick.
    Holding tenaciously to their fundamental principle of cultivating good writing among
their members, writing endowed with sincerity, feeling, and sound artistic criticism,
Quill Club managed to edit its first publication in 1928 under the title "Steps." It was
sponsored by Haegl Rune of the American College Quill Club in collaboration with the
Department of English. Honaca Delaney was editor of the two issues in 1928, with annual
issues following in 1929, 1930, and 1931.
    After a lapse of a year and a half, the literary magazine reappeared on the campus
under the present title, "Journeyman." Again sponsored by Quill Club with Don Early
as president, a magazine broader in scope made its appearance that year. Contributions
were accepted from all students, not necessarily members of Quill. Under Maxine
Hirsch in 1934 and George McGiffin in 1936 the club grew in size from 25 to 40 members.
By that time the Journeyman was being favorably accepted by both students and faculty
and was adopted by the University as the official literary magazine.
    This year Bruno Pozzi assumed leadership as president of the more versatile Quill
Club, which while no longer a member of the national organization, is nevertheless, a
club of increasing importance. Kenneth Houp succeeded Mr. Pozzi as president, in
January, in time to issue the annual call for manuscripts. The scope of the new edition
of the Journeyman was broadened to include creative sketches, criticisms, discussions
of current problems, and book reviews. The form of the book was revised into a smaller
size modeled after regular commercial publications. Tapping requirements include the
submission of a manuscript for the magazine, which, if accepted by the members, merits
initiation into the Club.
    Meetings are held every two weeks in 1309 Cathedral where class papers and theses
written for the Club itself are read and discussed. An annual banquet is held in June
to round out the year's activities.
    Those tapped at the last Scholar's Day tapping were: Bernice Goldman, Alice
Benovitz, Mildred Akselrad, Dorothy M. Davis, Estelle Kovacs, Marion Conn, Leah
Hankin, Gertrude Lieblich, Mary L. Nicholson, Rosalie Brennan, Mary Roche, John
Finnan, Ray Maize, J. Ford Roche, Stephen Poch, James Scheifer, Charles Conner,
Michael McHale, Ernest Holmok, Arthur Aynon, S. Merriman Klein, Walter Beecher,
J. Harold Gettys.
The general library is on the fourth,  186
fifth, and sixth floors of the Cathedral of Learning.

     It is hard to imagine a national honorary with 320 active members but that is the
 proud claim of Beta Chapter of Phi Alpha Theta at our University. It further augments its
 roll by electing to membership National Members; these are historians of national or in ternational renown.
     Phi Alpha Theta, National Honorary History Fraternity, was founded March 14, 1921,
 by Dr. N. Andrew N. Cleven at the University of Arkansas with the worthy purpose of
 rewarding meritorious achievement in the field of history and of stimulating an interest
 in historical information. There are seventeen chapters scattered throughout the United
 States.
     Beta Chapter at the University was founded on the first anniversary of the society
 by the original organizer, Dr. Cleven. The Phi Alpha Theta Chapter at Pitt has the dis tinction of being the largest and most active in the fraternity. Beta's service to the field
 of history goes far beyond her monthly meetings and is not limited in service to the Uni versity alone. Her members, for the most part, are History Department alumni who con tinue their associations with the chapter and activities in the field of history. Many are
 teachers in the high schools in communities in or near the Pittsburgh district. Participa tion, also, in the celebration of events of historical importance is an integral part of the
 program.
     The annual celebration of the founding of the fraternity is an event of significant
 importance. It is at this time the society invites prominent historians to address its mem bers and to accept honorary membership.
     As the University celebrates its 150th anniversary, Beta of Phi Alpha Theta celebrates
 its 15th birthday. Although the chapter is only one-tenth as old as the school, it plays a
 major role in modern University life. In its quest for knowledge, sponsorship of fellow ship, and preservation of scholastic ideals, Beta Chapter of Phi Alpha Theta keeps alive
 the greatest benefits of collegiate days.
                                                           The library space on the fourth

     At the outbreak of the World War, women declared their rights by organizing their
 first honorary fraternity at the University. In 1914, Dr. Will Grant Chambers, then Dean
 of the School of Education, aided fourteen enthusiastic young women in establishing
 Kappa Pi, a local professional fraternity. A few years later, Kappa Pi became Delta
 chapter, a charter member of the national education fraternity, Pi Lambda Theta. In
 May of last year, a large delegation from Delta chapter drove up to Penn State College
 to the home of Dr. and Mrs. Chambers to assist in the installation of Alpha Pi, most
 recently organized chapter of Pi Lambda Theta.
     Approximately one hundred teachers throughout the Pittsburgh district and nearby
communities are members of Pi Lambda Theta and sixty of these actively participate
in the social and cultural events of the honorary. Membership in the fraternity is based
upon scholarship and character, and is open only to those students and graduates who
have finished or are completing their practice teaching.
     During the summer, a tea for women in the School of Education was given to acquaint
the undergraduates with members of Pi Lambda Theta. In the fall, a regional meeting
was held at the Schenley Hotel and teachers from near and far gathered for the conclave.
Luncheon at the College Club and a trip through the Cathedral was a part of the program
planned for the out-of-town delegates. Modernistic, urban and rural, and industrial
paintings were viewed at the International Art Exhibit. At the Founders Day banquet,
Assistant Commissioner of Education and Pi Lambda Theta national president, Bess
Goodykoontz, who was formerly a member of the University faculty, was the honored
speaker. A round of business meetings and panel discussions completed the divisional
conference.
     Continuing its get-acquainted policy, Pi Lambda Theta sponsored a dinner for junior
women in the School of Education. Seventy-five young women looking forward to the
teaching profession attended the dinner at which Dr. Camilla Anderson, prominent
psychiatrist, spoke. From the gold Cathedrals mounted on the blue place cards to the
xylophone solo of one of the members, the get-acquainted dinner was unique.
     "Understanding Other Women's Problems" was the subject for a panel discussion
during which a doctor, a mother, a nurse at the Children's Hospital, and promotional
director at a downtown department store discussed their vocational problems. Another
topic for an entertaining panel discussion on the "Professional Attitudes for Women"
was presented.
    The aim of the fraternity has been to maintain high standards of training in the
teaching profession and to promote a spirit of fellowship among the women of that profession. On Scholar's Day the following tappees were announced: Mary C. Fallon, Lois
Follansbee, Alice Johnston, Dorothy F. Langguth, Gwendolyn H. Marshfield, June R.
Phipps, and Thelma I. Waddle.

                        PANHEURT.EI.NIC COUNCIL
                Friendly rivals are these members of Panhellenic Council, representative upper           classmen from every women's fraternity on campus. How to rush, when to rush, whom
           to rush-Panhel decides the answers to those questions. And as they say it shall be done,
           so is it done. Over a period of twenty-nine years, since the first women's fraternity was
           established on the campus, fraternalism has grown until today the women's groups hold
           the same distinction as men's fraternities.
               Traditionally Panhel members, dressed in formal attire, greeted the frosh at a recep           tion in their honor. Soft candlelight, fragrant flowers, and an open hearth set the scene
           for the newcomers, who met Jean Lawson, Panhel prexy; Marion Messer, social chairman;
           Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women; Miss Helen P. Rush and Miss Frances McLaughlin,
           assistant deans of women, in the receiving line. Rushing in mid-November gave the
           future pledglings something to talk about during the next few months. Corsages, friendly
           smiles, and tea parties featured Panhel's fall rush calendar.
               Along about December, vocal chords were being exercised by the sorors contending
           for the gold loving cup in the interfraternity sing. A swing orchestra, hill-billys, Holly           wood skits, and kindergartens added to the competition, but Zeta Tau Alpha rode the
           crest of the wave and added another cup to their overburdened mantlepiece. A Yuletide
           celebration at the Tri-Delt house provided gifts for the Council members with a grab-bag
           and all the trimmings. On Scholar's Day, Elizabeth Reiger and Rita Roegge who had a
           2.5 scholastic average for four years were recipients of the Panhel award of silver plaques
           inscribed with the girls' names. Since women's fraternities at the University have a
           system of deferred rushing, the spring rushing season of three days is a round of break           fasts, formal banquets, minstrel shows, nite-clubs and what not. Smartly dressed rushees
           make their first appearance at the campus fraternity houses during the women's rush
           season.
               With spring and the usual April showers, fraternity women began to cast about in
           their minds for a "really smooth" escort for the annual Panhel Ball at the Urban Room
           of the William Penn Hotel. Marion Messer, chairman of the Ball, led the grand march
           with her escort and the others fell in step to the usual Hail to Pitt chorus. Last year the
           Spring Festival float parade sponsored by the Council, had as its theme the nursery
           rhymes of childhood days. Mary, Mary Quite Contrary, Jack Horner, and Old King
           Cole sat astride the borrowed trucks as the sorors vied for the trophy. Up Bayard and
           down Bigelow Boulevard rolled the line of trucks bearing their entries in the float parade,
           pausing before the judges' stand, and disbanding at the Cathedral entrance. From float
           parades to banquets turn the fraternity women to close the year's activities. With soft
           fraternity songs, mixed chatter of pledges and sorors, and the pastel gowns of the guests

                               At Wesleyan Female College, first woman's college in the world, Alpha Delta Pi
                          was founded in 1851 as the Adelphean Society. Many of the traditions and much of the
                          ritual of Alpha Delta Pi are the same today as in 1851. The pledge itself has come down
                          almost unchanged for 83 years. And, today, as in 1851, no girl may be taken into the
                          sorority save "such as may commend themselves for their intellectual and moral worth,
                          dignity of character and propriety of deportment."

     BETA PHI ALPHA
                               As the first national fraternity to be organized on the Pacific slope, Beta Phi Alpha
                           was founded at the University of California in 1909. The official publication is the
                           Aldebaran, together with a directory and song book as supplementary publications.
                           Represented by colors of green and gold, the Beta Phi Alpha flower is the yellow tea
                           rose. Philanthropic work was started under the name of the Mary Gordon Holway

                                         BETA SIGMA OMICRON
                                  At the seventeenth biennial convention of Beta Sigma Omicron in Kansas City in
                              1925, it was decided that the fraternity limit future expansion to Class A colleges and
                              universities. This decision proved a wise one as the fraternity has grown steadily, having
                              installed twenty-six chapters between 1926 and 1934. The quarterly magazine is The
                              Urn to which each initiate becomes a life subscriber by means of a contribution to an
                              endowment fund.

     Chi Omega was organized at the University of Arkansas in 1895 and in appreciation
of that fact, in 1930 Chi Omega gave to that University an open air theatre, known as
the Chi Omega Greek Theater. With cardinal and straw as its colors and the white
carnation for its flower, Chi Omega publishes the Eleusis, quarterly. In 1930 Chi
Omega sponsored the national achievement award, a gold medal to be presented to an
American woman of notable accomplishments.

           PHI MU
                                 Phi Mu was an outgrowth of a local society called the Philomathean, which was
                            organized at Wesleyan College, Macon, Georgia, in 1852. Fifty-nine active chapters
                            are included on the membership roster and there are alumnae associations in thirty-four
                            cities. A loving cup is awarded annually to the chapter rating highest in scholarship.
                            The flower is the enchantress carnation.

                              fraternity has been a social-philanthropic organization with a Phi Sigma Sigma wing
                              erected at Camp Rainbow, at Croton-on-Hudson, for under-nourished children. King

                              two representatives who answer roll call at the monthly council meetings. Mr. Robert
                              R. Corley, Assistant to the Dean of Men, has not only acted as adviser to the Council this
                              year, but has been a rejuvenating spirit as well.
                                  Social activities of I-F receive the most publicity around the campus. The social
                              program was an ambitious but also a successful one. The Yuletide Festival Committee
                              succeeded in securing the Schenley ballroom for the scene of the gala dance and Bill
                              LeRoy's excellent orchestra supplied the music. One of the chief attractions was the
                              Interfraternity Sing held in conjunction with the dance. The Delts had a large pill to
                              swallow on a dry throat this year when the Pi K.A.'s won the Sing and also the privilege
                              of the winner of singing on the radio broadcast during the dance. Another major social
                              event on the I-F Calendar was the Interfraternity Ball. The whole campus was speechless
                              when Chairman Ben Baskin mentioned casually, in one breath, too, the William Penn
                              Ball Rooms and Glen Gray and his Casa Loma Orchestra playing from ten to two. All
                              of the tickets for this affair were sold out long before the date for the dance-April 9                              and the dance met the approval of all who managed to get there.
                                  The Kapp Sig's really showed the rest of the fraternities how it should and could be
                              done when it came to passing the pigskin over the goal for six points, or arching a basket                              ball through the air for goals, in the I-F sponsored tourneys. They seemed, too, to have a
                              peculiar knack of batting a volley ball over the net and were long winded enough to
                              win the Panther Run. Over at the S.A.M. house they cultivate the art of ball rolling to
                              win bowling cups. The Phi Delts pulled a surprise to claim the indoor track cup for their
                              mantle. I-F Council is trying its utmost to inaugurate as a permanent policy a well                              rounded program of interfraternity sports events which will attract as many members as
                              possible for active participation.
                                  A different, not so well known or appreciated, list of projects in which I-F Council
                              is vitally interested, includes the following: an active association, the Alumni Faculty
                              Advisory Association which was formed to develop better understanding and closer
                              contacts between the alumni, faculty, and the fraternities; the new project of a system of
                              resident advisers for the fraternities. The University gives free tuition for graduate study
                              to resident advisers living in the houses in exchange for the work they do in guiding and
                              directing the activities of their respective fraternities. The chapter does its part by fur                              nishing room and board. Another innovation to be regarded as something of a triumph
                              is the new election idea. This plan promises to eliminate the bickering and discord that
                              has so disrupted the Council in the past. Five senior council members and two members
                              of the Dean of Men's office meet and select the officers of the new Council.
                                  In recognition of the fact that I-F Council demands the maintenance of a certain
                              scholastic average it awards an annual scholarship plaque. Realizing what conditions
                              would be if unrestricted rushing prevailed, through the efforts of the Council, the fra                              ternities have pledged themselves to a moderate sensible game of "crown the freshman"
                              in which all houses will have fair and equal opportunities. The creation of rules for
                              intra-fraternity social activities and conduct and an attempt to shoulder responsibility
                              for the execution of these rules, round out the series of tasks that Interfraternity Council
                              handles so well.

                Delta Tau Delta, which now has 74 chapters, was founded at Bethany College,
           West Virginia, in 1859. In 1914, Alpha Alpha, a local Pitt fraternity was incorporated
           as the Gamma Sigma chapter under the purple, white and gold Delt colors. Publications
           of the fraternity include The Rainbow published nationally, and The Panther Delt local
           publication. The objective of Delta Tau Delta is to educate, contributing to the young
           men within her sphere of influence a moral, spiritual, and social development com           mensurate with the intellectual training supplied by the colleges and universities.

                                  KAPPA SIGMA
                 From the first chapter which was established at the University of Virginia in 1869,
             Kappa Sigma, traditionally founded in 1400 at the University of Bologna, has flourished
             and prospered until it now includes 108 chapters scattered from coast to coast. In 1920,
             Sigma Kappa Pi, a local group, adopted the scarlet, green and white colors to become
             the Gamma Omega chapter. The Caducceus, national publication, and The Kappa
             Sigma Journal local paper, continually emphasize the fraternity's aim "to foster and
             maintain a spirit of fraternalism among the members and to encourage scholarship and
             a participation in extra-curricular activities."

                    LAMBDA CHI ALPHA
         The Gamma Epsilon chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha was chartered at Pitt in 1919.
     Eighty-six chapters have sprung up as the result of the initial founding at Boston Uni     versity in 1909. The fraternity strives to stimulate the development of character by en     couraging unselfishness and loyalty among its members. Its colors are purple, green,
     and gold. The Cross and Crescent and The Smokestack of Gamma Epsilon national
     and local publications respectively, enliven interest in the latest fraternity news and activi     ties.

                  Sixty-nine years after the founding of Phi Delta Theta at the University of Miami,
              Ohio, the local fraternity Sigma Pi became the Pennsylvania Iota chapter in 1917. The
              Scrollof Phi Delta Theta is awaited with eagerness at each of the 106 chapters proudly
              exhibiting the azure and argent colors. Phi Delta Theta emphasizes the importance of
              developing a high moral character and strives to encourage excellence in scholarship.

                   The first of the present 18 chapters of Pi Lambda Phi was founded at Yale University
               in 1895. In 1914, Gamma Sigma, a local campus fraternity, became the Gamma Sigma
               Chapter of Pi Lambda Phi. The fraternity aims to eliminate sectarianism and prejudice
               and to promote friendship and scholarship in college life. The fraternity's colors are
               purple and gold. At various events during the school year the chapter publishes its
               local paper, The Gamma Sigma while the national publication, The Frater, is issued
               quarterly.

THE FIRST w. U. P. COMMENCEMENT—1823

1 HE first commencement of the Western University of Pennsylvania was
held in 1823. Three students were awarded degrees by Dr. Bruce, the
Principal; and "each of the graduates—-Thomas Cathcart Guthrie, Samuel Fer-
guson Smith, and Alexander Logan—became a preacher. W.U.P. had a faculty
of five then, and it was the most natural thing in the world for students to become
clerics, for every member of the faculty was a preacher. The University was
comprised of two departments, the Preparatory, for the beginners, and the Col-
legiate, tor the more advanced. Once a student mastered the classics, he pro-
gressed from the Preparatory to the Collegiate Department where he studied
composition, declamation, algebra, history, navigation, chemistry, and natural
history. The committee appointed by the Board of Trustees announced that the
curriculum would ”. . . blend the solid with the ornamental; the useful with
the elevated." The progression from class to class was irregular, students
advancing as quickly as their abilities permitted. The lone requirement was
that each student attend the last two years of the Collegiate Department.
Today the University of Pittsburgh is truly a university, a‘ fusion of depart-
ments that gives to the community annually a thousand men and women ready
to ﬁll useful places in the pattern of things. From the two departments of the
original W.U.P., the University has grown to an institution consisting of seven-
teen divisions. By day the University functions through the College, "the Schools
of Engineering and Mines, of Education, Business Administration, Medicine,
Law, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and the Graduate School. For those unable to attend
school by day, there is an Evening School. The inﬂuence of the University has
been widened more than ever by means of the Extension Division and the Sum-
mer Session. lohnstown and Erie Centers are maintained. An outpost has been
established in China. The faculty has grown from a group of five divines to a
body of over 900 teachers, with a student registration in the neighborhood of
11,000. Pitt has grown more than in size alone. Pitt is a great University, not
solely because it is a large one, but because it serves its community well.

                                                                 The wooden ceiling and wooden

                      SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON
              Desiring to promote closer college friendships, a group of Alabama students banded
          together to found the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity in 1856. The success of this group
          led to the establishment of 110 more chapters with the local Chi Omicron, casting aside
          its independence in 1913 to become the Pennsylvania Chi Omicron chapter of Sigma
          Alpha Epsilon. The fraternity's colors are royal purple and old gold. News of all the
          various chapters is embodied in the contents of The Recordof Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the
          national publication.

                              The aim of Sigma Alpha Mu, founded at the College of the City of New York, is to
                         form a close social and fraternal union of Jewish students of the various colleges and pro                         fessional schools in America; to foster and maintain among its sons a spirit of fraternity,
                         a spirit of mutual aid and support; to instill and maintain in the hearts of its sons love for
                         and loyalty to Alma Mater. Psi chapter was formed at Pitt in 1919, ten years after the
                         founding of the national fraternity. The local publishes The Psi-Ren and also receives the
                         national publication The Octagonian. There are 37 chapters sporting purple and white

                Sigma Chi was founded at Miami University in 1855 with the expressed purpose of
            promoting a spirit of friendship and encouraging justice and scholarship. The local
            Beta Theta chapter, recognized as the oldest fraternity of continued existence on the
            University campus, evolved from the independent Delta Chi in 1909. The Magazine
            of Sigma Chi carries fraternity news of interest to all the 98 chapters flying the blue and
            gold colors while the local chapter publishes its own sheet known as The Cathedral
            Cauldron.

          THETA CHI
                                Theta Chi originated on the campus of Norwich University on April 10, 1856. Theta
                           Chi now includes on its roster 50 chapters throughout the United States. In addition to
                           the national publication, The Rattle of Theta Chi, the local chapter publishes its own
                           magazine, The Alphabet. The merging of Sigma Epsilon in 1919 and Theta Delta Psi in
                           1934, resulted in the formation of Alpha Beta chapter of Theta Chi. The fraternity has
                           for its colors military red and white. The purpose of Theta Chi is to create a tradition of
                           good scholarship, to develop the moral, social, and cultural life of its members, and to
                           cooperate with other fraternities in promoting the stability and general welfare of the
                           American college fraternity system.

The "University Nine" Defeats the "Eckfords"-1869
                                    ASEBALL was the first game of consequence played at the University. The
                                         earliest recorded game was played in 1869, when the "University Nine"
                                         defeated the Eckfords of East Liberty in a close game. The score was 21-20
                                    and the game lasted only five innings. From their scores these first games give
                                    evidence of either amazing batting skill or woeful pitching. The "University
                                    Nine" was undefeated until 1870, when they lost by a score of 21-15 to a high
                                    school team in a seven inning game. Several years later came the beginning of
                                    intramural sports. The Sophomores defeated the Juniors by a ninth inning rally
                                    16-14. The vengeful Juniors, with more enthusiasm than wisdom, challenged the
                                    Seniors. The outcome was depressing to the Juniors, who lost, 39-24. It took the
                                    Seniors only 7 innings to amass their 39 runs-an average of over 5 runs per
                                    inningl From this time until 1900 baseball was played intermittently at the
                                    University. Schedules were irregular, but games were played with most of the
                                    nearby college teams. Until 1924 University nines met with fair success.
                                    Interest, however, waned due to the lack of a proper ballfield, the strictness of
                                    eligibility rules, and the irregularity of the schedules. Football beginning in
                                    1890, held the stage from that time on.
                                       The athletic scene today at Pitt is widely different. Varsity and intramural
                                    sports are maintained throughout the year. The Pitt Panther has become known
                                    throughout the country for his prowess. Year after year, under Dr. Sutherland,
                                    Pitt football teams rank with the best in the country. Pitt basketball teams led by
                                    Coach "Doc" Carlson, have turned in one successful season after another.
                                    Lately the Pitt track team, once almost utterly lacking student interest, has
                                    become a breeding place for champions, National and Olympic. The swimming
                                    team can always be depended upon to register a successful season. Other
                                    sports, of more recent inception, promise bright results. Boxing, wrestling,
                                    tennis, golf and rifle shooting are now well established and successful. Hockey
                                    has made a start at the University this year. Pitt men are well proud of Pitt teams.

  Each department of the University has its own
particular group of faculty members. Blended
together, this hetergeneous group is the University staff. The faculty setup of the Department
of Athletics is an integral part of the University
staff. Corresponding to the position of Dean is
the Director of Athletics. His assistant is titled
the Graduate Manager of Athletics. Members of
the faculty are the various athletic coaches.
  There are times when the professorial policy
conflicts with the administrational way of doing
things. Such was the occurrence this year in
Pitt's athletic department. W. Don Harrison as
Director of Athletics found his policies irreconcilable with those of Dr. John B. Sutherland,
varsity football coach. In deference to the
nation's foremost gridiron mentor, Harrison
submitted his resignation to the Athletic Council
and it became effective at the completion of this
school year.
  One of the major aims of a University is to
develop its students into effective citizens and
members of the professional community. When
these students are sought by that community,
the University is given a strong approval.
This year Carnegie Tech selected alumnus
William Kern to be its football coach. Kern had
been Dr. Sutherland's chief assistant for the past
few years and when he went to Tech he asked
alumnus Dr. Edward Baker, the Pitt backfield
coach, to be his first assistant. Kern and Baker
left the Pitt coaching staff at the end of this football year. Kern further augmented his staff with
the addition of Pitt alumni Edward Skladany,
All American end, and Frank Kutz.
  To fill his depleted staff of aides, Dr. Sutherland announced his appointments when spring
football practice began in the beginning of
April. Alec Fox, captain of the Pitt team of'27,
was added as line coach. Fox had been assisting
Harvey Harmon, another Pitt alumnus, in a
similar capacity at the University of Pennsylvania. Edward Schultz, who had coached the
Pitt ends while he was in law school in'32,'33,
and'34 and who was the winner of the George
Wharton Pepper award for exceptional scholarship, returned to alma mater again as end coach.
Harold "Josh" Williams, a brilliant Pitt halfback
in 1930, became backfield coach. He had been
coaching at Beaver High School before accepting the new position. Charles Bowser, backfield
coach, was promoted to the place of Sutherland's
head assistant.

BASKETBALL CONFERENCE TROPHY

PITT
- - 21
  Thursday evening, December 3, the Varsity Letter Club
held its annual banquet for the Pitt football squad. Just as
the adjournment of the dinner was being considered, an
Associated Press wire arrived. W. Don Harrison, Director of
Athletics, read the message. The University of Washington,
West Coast Champion, had selected the University of
Pittsburgh, Champiqn of the East, to be its opponent in the
Tournament of Roses gridiron classic to be held on January
1, 1937.
  Thus, for the first time in the history of the Rose Bowl
game, an eastern team had received four invitations to this
post season contest. Training was resumed immediately
and preparations began for the invasion of Pasadena. Two
weeks later, on Wednesday, December 16, as the Christmas
recess began, thirty-four players, three coaches, student
managers, and twenty-two alumni and friends, left Pennsylvania Station on a special train, consisting of four pullmans,
two baggage cars, club and observation cars.
  With stops at Chicago, Kansas City, and Albuquerque,
the entourage headed for San Bernardino, California,
where training quarters were established. Reports that have
returned from California indicate that all who met the
members of the team were impressed by their earnestness,
their appearance, and their behavior.
  The Pitt team that entered the huge, saucered Rose Bowl
on New Year's Day was a Pitt team that knew that it had to
win, knew that it wanted to win, and knew that it was going
to win. Three previous defeats in this competition were
given an added sting when Pacific Coast sports commentators became unanimous in their derision of the
selection of the Panthers.
  87,136 spectators, absolute capacity and the largest
crowd ever to see a Rose Bowl game, were in the stands on
that sunfull afternoon that was New Year's Day in Pasadena.
Out of the locker room into this arena came thirty-four
University of Pittsburgh students, filled with the fierce
determination of youth. Three weeks of concentration on

        one desire, victory in the Rose Bowl, had built up a strong
        will to win. It reached its emotional heights in that Pasadena
        locker room. Dr. Sutherland couldn't give a pre-game talk.
        He was choked. He nodded to his assistant to say some        thing. Virile Bill Kern floodgated a tear. The Pitt team ran
        onto the field.
          They didn't stop that running all day. Bobby LaRue ran
        26 yards through right tackle and Marshall Goldberg ran
        19 yards around left end as the Panthers ran 56 yards up the
        field. Frank Patrick's plunging from the one foot line gave
        Pitt six points in the first quarter. Sophomore end Bill
        Daddio kicked the extra point.
          In the second quarter Washington's offensive became
        more effective. Two advances went as deep into the Panther
        end of the field as the 37 and 19 yard lines. They went no
        further. Bobby LaRue, completing three years of regular
        play with his best game, almost broke into touchdown land
        when he ran 44 yards to the Washington 30 yard line in the
        third period. From here Frank Patrick bowled over six
        more points. On five consecutive plays through the middle
        of the line, Frank powered his way to the final stripe.
        Daddio again converted.
          With a flurry of forward passes, Haines tossed the Huskies
        as far as the Pitt 29 yard mark in the final quarter. Daddio
        decided that that was far enough for any Husky to go and
        he stabbed one of Haines' laterals and raced seventy-one
        yards for the third touchdown. He made his total scoring
        of the day nine points by kicking the third extra point.
          For the remainder of the game Pitt kept pushing the ball
        towards the Washington goal line. On occasion the
        Panthers reached the one and five yard lines. The game
        ended. Score, Pitt 21, Washington 0.
          Everyone who saw that game agreed that the Panther
        team that played in the Rose Bowl was the season's finest
        piece of gridiron mechanism. It was mechanism with a
        heart.

                          Pitt football is usually characterized by the word power. This term is con                       notative of an exact, vigorous, unspectacular type of gridiron play. From this
                       preciseness come touchdowns. With a team schooled rigidly in fundamentals,
                       Pitt has been called a power outfit because it produced victory with a simple
                       offense that depended upon a straight, line-buck, off-tackle strategy. Two years
                       ago a slight variation was evident. Dr. Sutherland's "Highland Fling" was a
                       colorful offensive diagram that opened up the Pitt play. This year the Pitt team
                       turned on more power during the season than the Duquesne Light Company
                       shut off during the St. Patrick's Day flood. And it was power of the dashing,
                       scintillating, wide-open variety. The same thoroughness in rudimentary matters
                       was present, but it was given a smack of the spectacular by the brilliance of a
                       stable of great running backs. Marshall Goldberg, Johnny Wood, and Harold
                       Stebbins headlined the season with fast, skillful scoring jaunts as they gave
                       added meaning to "Pitt power."
                                 SEPTEMBER 26, 1936-PITT 53, OHIO WESLEYAN 0
                          Indications of things to come predominated the touchdown account that the
                      Panthers debited in their first game of the season played at the Stadium. Ohio
                      Wesleyan couldn't dyke the Pitt scoring stream. Sophomore Goldberg, in his
                      first varsity game, carried the ball up the field in an uninterrupted march for
                      the first touchdown. He scored on an off-tackle slice from the three yard line.
                      Still in the first quarter, Goldberg went through another tackle hole, this time
                      doing a bit of Astaire stepping up the field for 76 yards and the second score.
                          Goldberg's classmate, Harold Stebbins of Williamsport, took up the banner
                      of the class of'39 by duplicating his classmate's scoring antics. Stebbins scored
                      at the end of a continuous 46-yard march and then did a solo up the field for
                      another six-pointer after running 43 yards. Johnny Wood wiggled down the
                      field in a most elusive manner for 53 yards and another touchdown. Then he
                      grabbed a 30-yard pass from Troglione to equal the point-making of his under                      classmen. LaRue, Patrick, and Malarkey each contributed to the huge Panther
                      total after overpowering drives.

OCTOBER 3, 1936-PITT 34, WEST VIRGINIA 0
   The Mountaineers came to the Stadium to play Pitt for the
twenty-ninth time. The sun was still shining in full October
glare, but the Panthers must have thought it was November. At
least they were in mid-season form as they walloped West
Virginia. Senior Leo Malarkey, with a name just made for puns,
certainly did not make the Mountaineers laugh. After the boys
from down in them thar' hills had left the Panthers scoreless in
the first quarter, Malarkey helped himself to three touchdowns
in the next two periods. One was the result of a spectatorraising 80-yard run.
   LaRue forwarded to Fabian Hoffman for 10 yards, Hoffman
ran 25 more, and the Panthers had another score. Tony Matisi,
tackle, grabbing a ball out of the air after Pitt's Henry Adams
stabbed for it, raced his bulky figure 37 yards for the other pointmaker. Patrick and Daddio did the extra point kicking, each
making two.
       OCTOBER 10, 1936-PITT 6, OHIO STATE 0
    Since spring practice, the preceding April, Pitt knew that
its first and, perhaps biggest, objective was the defeat of Ohio
State. This game was the season's first great natural. Ohio State
was reckoned to be the nation's best, even before the playing
season got under way. And when, in its first game, the Buckeyes
overwhelmed N.Y.U., 66-0, the odds against Pitt went up as fast
as the stock market went down in'29.
    Ohio State's horse-shoe stadium was 71,714 spectators strong
on the Saturday of the game in Columbus. Resorting to its
dependable, old-fashioned style of play because of a wet field,
Pitt smashed down the famed "razzle-dazzle" Buckeye offense
and gained consistently itself. It couldn't score however. Then,
as the stop-watch began to reach its last 60 mark, Pitt found itself
with the ball on the Ohio 34-yard line. Sophomore Stebbins
took the ball from center on a play called by Sophomore quarterback Chickerneo, who obliterated the opposing end. With this
bit of eliminating, and equally good blocking by the rest of the
team, Stebbins scampered for the winning touchdown.
    Statistics showed a definite Pitt superiority. Without even
using a forward or lateral pass, Pitt had 11 first downs to Ohio's
5, rolled up 251 yards by rushing to Ohio's 77, and permitted
the Buckeyes to enter Pitt territory only once.
            OCTOBER 17-PITT 0, DUQUESNE 7
    Built up to such a keen mental peak so early in the season
was psychologically unhealthy for the Panthers. The following
Saturday Duquesne came into the Stadium with no greater
esire than to beat Pitt. They did it. George Matsik, a substitute
hlfback, wangled out into the open and ran 73 yards for the
touchdown.
    Misplays were devastating to the Panther recovery attempt.
A fumble on the three yard line ruined Pitt's choicest scoring
possibility. An intercepted pass erased all ther good of a 75-yard
s;eeady drive. Unable to do anything on the slippery field, an
apathetic Panther fell before an aroused Duke. First downs,
nevertheless, were 11-3 in favor of the Panthers.
                                                                 229

                         Nothing is as stimulating to a fighting team as unexpected
                      defeat, nothing as strong as a desire for vindication. Nothing
                      could stop the Panthers on this clear Autumn afternoon. Not
                      even a good Notre Dame team. With the season's biggest

                      the field, sidestepped, took advantage of quickly formed inter                      ference, and completed one of the season's best runs for the
                      final touchdown.
                         Statistics were just as smothering. 14 first downs for the

                      the ferociousness of a Panther at his snarlingest.

                     For the second successive year in their Polo Grounds battle, the
                     Panther-Ram game ended without a score. Pitt came within
                     4 yards of the scoring proximity only to be repulsed by a fighting

NOV. 7, 1936-PITT 34, PENN STATE 7
   Pitt football teams reach their playing
apex in November. Since Dr. Sutherland
began to coach at Pitt, they have not been
beaten during this month. At the Stadium
on this Saturday that old November adage
became reinforced. Before a homecoming
crowd of 20,000, Pitt circuited its power on
all volts.
   Goldberg passed 25 yards to Stebbins
for touchdown number one in the first
quarter. Patrick completed an 80-yard
drive with a touchdown in the second
quarter. State's score came in the same
period on the age old "sleeper" pass,
Wear to Harrison. In the final period Pitt
ran wild. Stebbins plunged over from the
three-yard line, Johnny Wood did his weekly
piece of open field running, and Johnny Urban
followed him up with a similar feat of 52 yards.
NOVEMBER 14, 1936-PITT 19, NEBRASKA 6
  Going up to Lincoln for the yearly meeting
with the Cornhuskers, Pitt realized that it would
have one of its most difficult encounters when it
bumped into the Big Six champions. It was a
fine team that Pitt played this Saturday, but Pitt
was finer. After Francis and Cardwell collaborated for a touchdown, the Panthers were behind.
Just as the half was about to end, in fact there
were 30 seconds left, Greene passed to Urban
for 30 yards, and then went over the center to
even the score.
  Passes by Urban gave Pitt a scoring opportunity in the third quarter. Urban made it good
on an offtackle slice from the seven-yard line.
An overnight fullback conversion, Greene
bucked over his second touchdown to finish the
scoring.

  In bitter winter weather, Pitt stung a cold
defeat on Carnegie Tech in their twenty-third
meeting. Bill Daddio's toe was not numbed by
the cold. He kicked a field goal from the 25mark in the opening period and then proceeded
to make four conversions go true. In the second
period Goldberg raced 42 yards, for a score.
Greene ran 53 yards before being tackled and
Bobby LaRue followed up with a score from the
3-yard line on an off tackle slant. Matelan, Skibo
halfback rounded end for 19 yards and a Tartan
score.
  A passing duo of Matelan to Kellar accounted
for another Tech score in the opening of the
second half. On the next kickoff, LaRue took
the ball, met Goldberg coming up from the other
side of the field, gave him the ball, and Biggie
sprinted up the sidelines for 83 yards and a
score.

   Even though the win and loss facts do not
represent the apex of achievement, the accomplishments of Pitt's basketball Panthers during the
season 1936-37 were among the most satisfying
in University athletic history. Pitt, with a
season's record of 14 victories and 7 defeats,
attained the highest recognition in the two
branches of its competition, the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball Conference title and the
City of Pittsburgh championship. The first success accounted for Pitt's fourth triumph in the
E.I.B.C. in the five years of Conference existence. The city crown became Pitt's for the first
time since the three local schools got together in
round robin play.
  But, running through this season of victory
and defeat, were intangible factors that regimented this year's Pitt basketball team into the
pigeon hole of greatness. There was predominant in the play of this team, which technically
was hardly above the mediocre, elements that
could do nothing but make the season a success.
They were present consistently, and were never
lacking when really needed. On these occasions, when the outcome of the contest was
important, the magnificence of spirit, the sheer,
sweet courage, and the will to win of Pitt's
basketball Panthers burned so brightly that they
couldn't be beaten.
  Competition was begun late in December with
a Pullman trip to the Midwest. In Chicago, the
Panthers inaugurated the season against Northwestern. The Wildcats, materially aided by more
experience and their home court, gave Pitt its
soundest trouncing, 37-28. Still in the Windy
City, the Panthers went over to DePaul the
following evening and were beaten in an extra
period affair, 41-37. Monday, December 14, Pitt
traveled to Indianapolis from Chicago and succeeded in gaining the season's first triumph,
32-21, over Butler, a perennial opponent.
   Then the Pitt basketball kite started sailing
high. It all began to whirl when the Panthers
came home and began to play their basketball
on the Stadium court. First they pacified Wisconsin, 41-30, and then, in their first Conference
game they knocked over an able Temple outfit,
32-28, in a closely scored game, but one in
which Pitt maintained an even and substantial
lead throughout the play.
  The first interruption in this home stand came
when Pitt crossed the street car tracks to even
out an old score with its scholastic neighbors on
the other end of Panther Hollow. Carnegie Tech
deprived Pitt of the Conference title for the first
time the preceding year, and with this revenge
motive uppermost, the Panthers outscored the
Tartans, 30-26, to win their second Conference
game.
  That great Pitt spirit soared to its highest keel
in the following game at the Stadium. Notre
Dame came to Pittsburgh with a record that
showed four straight wins, with two All American players in the starting line-up, and with a
team that was reckoned to be well on its way
toward the national championship. During the
232
first half the boys from Notre Dame lived up to
all the nice things that had been said about them.
They started out by piling up an enormous lead
over Dr. Carlson's boys, once it was 14-4, and
when the half ended the scoreboard read 23 for
Notre Dame and 14 for Pitt. But, the Panthers
weren't through.. They came back in the second
half with a surge of spirit that completely played
the great Notre Dame team off its basketball feet.
Led by Jumpin' Joe Garcia, whose play was
hotter than the Spanish Revolution, and who
individually accounted for 14 points, Pitt hooped
its way into the lead and the game ended in a
Panther triumph, 34-31.
  After this lengthy stay at home, Carlson's
cagers again hit the Pullman trail. Against the
Navy, the Pitt floormen floated over their sixth
victory wave, 35-28, and continued on to
Washington. In the Capital City, the Blue and
Gold basketeers' winning ways went beserk
when Georgetown gave out Pitt's first league
setback.
  While most students were cramming for first
semester finals, Dr. Carlson's cage pupils had
to pass one more basketball test before the first
term ended. That they did with high marks by
completely outclassing Penn State, 36-28, in a
Stadium contest.
  The season's soundest adage was given additional substantiation, when in between semesters, Pitt proved that to them, "there's no place
like home," and they smothered West Virginia,
44-36. Westminster came to the Stadium next
and found that this was more than true, losing a
well played game, 32-29.
  Ballyhooed as the game of games, the annual
Pitt-Duquesne Stadium get-together was more
than that. It came out of the story books. The
Pitt determination to win and the fighting Pitt
DR. H. CLIFFORD CARLSON
      Varsity Coach
spirit reached its top. Hopelessly outscored at
the end of the first half, 15-30, the swashbuckling
Panthers came into the second period imbued
with the drive of a team that is riding along with
the confidence of victory within its grasp. Swishing through points with incredible accuracy,
Pitt tied the score 44-44 when the regulation
time was completed. In the extra 5 minutes, Pitt
was losing 49-50 with 15 seconds to go and
Duquesne had the ball. Joe Garcia stabbed for
it, secured it in Duquesne territory, took two
steps and two dribbles, and with his last measure
of energy, let it fly high for the basket. It dropped
on the bank board and swished through the net.
Score, Pitt 51, Duquesne 50.
  Clinching the city championship, Pitt dropped
Carnegie Tech in the next game, 43-37. Then,
came the natural let-down from a strenuous list
of games. Going into the Pullmans again, Pitt
went to South Bend, was beaten by Notre Dame,
27-18, came back to Pittsburgh, was beaten by
Duquesne, 30-31, went to Philadelphia, and was
defeated by the Owls, 34-45. Returning to Pittsburgh, the Carlsonmen found themselves more
comfortable at home and trounced Georgetown,
39-22, reviving title hopes. A trip to Penn State
proved the Panthers were still stale and the
Lions triumphed, 24-21. When Temple lost to
West Virginia, the Pitt title hopes became a
reality again. Down to Morgantown went Carlson and his crew and in one of their best floor
exhibitions of the year, subdued the Mountaineers, 48-42, to tie Temple for the Conference
lead. A play-off in Philadelphia was necessitated, and proving that they were the team that
could win "when they wanted to win" because
they had the season's finest fighting heart, Pitt
rolled past Temple, 35-29, to finish the season
cum laude.

  Since his arrival, five years ago, at the
University, Coach Carl Olson has quickened the
track pulse of the campus with his contagious
enthusiasm for his particular sport and as a
result, the caliber of Pitt track accomplishments
have had an accompanying upward trend. A
definite stamp of approval should be placed on
the dual record of this year's Panther cross
country squad. It was a good year. Any season
that shows five victories and two defeats in a
sport as uncertain as cross country is good in
any coach's book of memoirs.
  More significant in the retrospection of the
Panther hill and dale year than the figures in the
record books is the personnel of the Pitt team.
There were four stars who bulwarked the
Panthers to this creditable showing. These four
                      finished up among the
                      leaders in every meet to
                      insure the Panthers an
                      impressive score. These
                      four, seniors Harold
                      Tost, Alex Leggin,
                      George Cook, and jun                      ior Albert Zamborski,
                      are the finest tribute to
                      1937 Pitt track and field.
                      Previous to their entry
                      into Pitt, not one of them
                      had done any real com                      petitive running what                      soever, let alone the

consistent scoring this year, they are now
ranked among the district's best long distance
runners.
   First meet of the year was at Bethany College,
 West Virginia. In this meet Pitt scored a shutout
 victory, winning 15-40. Finishing in first place
 were Cook, Leggin, and Zamborski, with hands
 locked in a triple tie. Second meet was at the
 home course, the Schenley Park valleys and
 hills, against Wayne University of Detroit.
 Wayne was beaten in the same manner, with
 the redoubtable trio of Zamborski, Leggin, and
 Cook holding hands in their first place finish.
 Michigan State came next Saturday with an
 unblemished record and the national cham pionship underneath their running shoes. They
 left with the same. Beating Pitt, 19-36, they
 went on later in the season to capture their third
 straight national championship in the IC4A meet
 at New York. Kenneth Waite, who later won the
 national individual title was first in the time of
 23 minutes, 26 seconds.
 In the meet against Carnegie Tech three
 weeks later, Harold Tost beat that mark by a
 couple of husky strides. He nego tiated the four and a half mile course
 in a time of 21 minutes, 23 seconds,
 the best time made over the difficult
 Schenley Park course during the year.
 Tech was beaten, 18-37, in this meet.
 In between the Tech and Michigan
 State contests, the Panthers motored
out to Indianapolis to trounce Butler,
25-30.

   Highlight of the dual season was the Penn State meet. Pitt
hadn't beaten State in 21 years of interschool cross country
competition. State had only lost one meet in three years. This
year Pitt came through with a 25-30 victory. Harold Tost finished second behind Olexy, State's great runner, and Cook,
Zamborski, Leggin, and Johnny Woodruff ended up among the
first ten to accourt for that triumph.
   An "off" day in New York resulted in a ninth place for the
Panthers in the IC4A meet at Van Cortlandt Park. The season
was ended at Annapolis where the service team wiggled in
ahead of Pitt over the Navy course, 26-29. In addition to the four
stalwarts who were so prominent in the records, there are a few
more names that may be added to the cross country roster of
1936. Johnny Woodruff and Frank Bonarotti were always way
up there when the points were tabulated. They were the stars
of last year's undefeated freshman team. Bob Follette, Ray
Nordstrom, and Jim Follette were the other letter winners.
   When the wintery chill made Schenley Park a rather uncomfortable place to prance around in only jersey and shorts, Olson
led his trackmen up on the hill behind the Stadium to the Indoor
Track House. On this banked, cinder track the team practiced
through late November until early April. Entered in the Millrose
Games, the New York Athletic Club games and the Central
Intercollegiate Conference Championships, Pitt's best showing
was made by Johnny Woodruff. The big sophomore, in his first
year of varsity competition, won the half mile in the N.Y.A.C.
and C.I.C. games. A wooden track hindered him in the Millrose
600.
  Only dual meet of the season was held at the
Yost Field House, Ann Arbor, against the Big
Ten champions, Michigan. All around strength
was Michigan's winning factor. Woodruff won
two first places, in the half mile and in the 440yard dash in which he set a new Field House
record.
  Four varsity and three freshmen records were
established in the annual Indoor Championships
at the Pitt Track House. Ken Ryden's time of 6.5
seconds for the 50-yard high hurdles, Johnny
Woodruff's 2.00.3 minutes for the 880, and Pete
Bennett's jump of 6 feet, 2 inches set new varsity
marks. John Bazyk's heave of 50 feet, 8 inches  three firs
bettered the old shot put mark while Clarence  George

    With almost the same team, and almost the same schedule,
 the 1937 edition of Coach Pat Corr's swimming team finished
 the season with almost the same record as they had done the
 year before. Five victories and three defeats were the results
 of the team's efforts. Slippery Rock, Temple, Penn State,
 Delaware, and Ohio Wesleyan fell before the swimming
 Panthers. But Army, Western Reserve, and Franklin and Mar shall were too strong.
    Red McQuillan, captain of the team, ended the season in a
blaze of glory by rewinning his diving championship, and leading his cohorts into third place in the team championship at the
Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming Association meet at Lancaster.
Another stalwart performer, Walt Nowatny, took first place in
the 100 yard free style. Tom Locke was barely nosed out in the
200 and 440 yard races. He rarely lost a point in these races
all season.
    Chief weakness of this year's team lay in the fact that,
although they had plenty of ability to capture firsts, few points
could be garnered from the second and third places. This was
probably due to the weakness inherited from the year before,
the squad being too small. Bill Brown, Tom Anderson and Bernie
Lelake, Jimmy Lavine, Al Brown, Art Stiranka, Bill Keck, and
Bill Richmond were also steady performers in solo and relay
events.
   Besides their regular schedule, the freshman team often
entertained during the intermissions of the varsity contests. Hym
and Milt Lederstein and Al Beacon not only offered a relay team
that cut eight seconds off the time made by the varsity in the
same race, but also provided a bit of warbling. Bill Dill was
really the answer to a coach's prayer as Pat Corr has been
looking for a freshman diver for a long time. With these men
coming up, the Panthers should have the full squad next year
that they need.

    VARSITY BOXING
    Hitting a high point after the Bucknell events, the Pitt boxing
team under the guidance of Coach Jack Shricker, had only a
short-lived boon period, because in the very next fight the
University of West Virginia mittmen defeated the Panther men
for the conference championship. Defeating Bucknell, Washingtion and Jefferson, and Temple put the ringmen into a first place
tie with the Mountaineers. But, in what has become a seasonal
event, the Morgantowners knocked the Panther pugs out of
the championship.
   Extra-conference bouts were not so fortunate for the Panthers.
Schricker's men lost their first two ring series to Catholic U. and
to Penn State. But both of these teams were filled with experienced men and ranked among the country's best.
   Newest light on the Pitt ring horizon was sophomore Ralph
Caruso. He was outstanding all year, and it was news when Caruso failed to come through. Captain Cleon Linderman, in his last
season, exhibited his usual steady fighting. He was the experienced backbone of the team. Ray Bombe and Homer Livingston
were the regular point garnerers in the 115 and 125 pound class.
Livingston has the best record of any 150 pounder in the University's history. Bombe knocked the conference champion in
the West Virginia fight. Both were seniors. Mike lanuzzi and
Herb Cummings handled the 145 lb. division competently. Emil
Halley did the "heavy" fighting. Lack of experience was
his only drawback.
   Ralph Dorand, in the 115 lb. class out punched the University's only championship in the Eastern Intercollegiate Boxing
Championships. Caruso and George Lupinacci, in the heavyweight division, garnered the only other Pitt points when they
lasted till the semi-finals. The combined points however, allowed
them to tie their arch-rivals the Mountaineers, for third place in
team points.

       RIFLE TEAM
  With the finest team in the University's
history, the rifle team definitely established itself
among the top-notch outfits of the country. A
record that includes a tie with Carnegie Tech
and Cornell for first place in the Allegheny
Intercollegiate League, a second place in the
national rifle tournament conducted by a newspaper chain, and a tie with the University of California for fourth place in the shoulder-toshoulder matches run off at Annapolis definitely
places the riflemen in the upper brackets.
  University records as well as national ones
were broken by the team. Outstanding was
Captain Poellot, who shooting in his last season,
led the team to its high place in the Intercollegiate standings, and established an individual University record. Other outstanding
men on Captain Mitchell's team were Diefendorf,
Hoffman, Sage, and Mantozoros.

Pitt Panther has nothing to show for his wrestling
efforts but mat burns and the satisfaction that
comes from trying. In other words Coach Edward
Mazeski and his troupe of matmen ran out their
'35-'36 string of matches without a victory. The
grapplers lost dual meets to Franklin and
Marshal 35-0, West Virginia 21-13, Penn State
34-0, Temple 28-6, and Waynesburg 21-9.
  Penn State's whitewash isn't as snowy white
as it's painted. The Panthers gave the State
boys all they wanted and more. Rudy Tomarelli
and Captain Neible succumbed in bitter overtime
bouts and other matches were lost in close
battles.
  The Inter-State Wrestling Tournament held in
Waynesburg provided background for the
Panther's biggest moments on the mats last
season. Roofner and Kosinski, a late comer on
the squad, fought their way into the finals in the
145 and 155 pound class respectively. Both lost
however to a pair of Case grunt and groaners.
Russ Bedillion got as far as the semi-finals but
forfeited.

WOMEN'S ATHLETICS
AUDREY GRAHAM
  Coeds at the University are offered the opportunity to engage in practically every type of
sport from hockey to ping-pong. Freshmen women are required to take a course in Physical Education through which they learn to play the
various sports. The athletic activities of the
upperclassmen are sponsored by the Women's
Athletic Association, an organization which is
open to every woman and which allows her to
take part in all tournaments and games.
  Among the less strenuous sports, archery
holds top place in the coeds' favor, since the
steady hand and good bearing necessary to hit
the "bulls eye" are also helpful in acquiring
poise. During warm weather, the whiz and thud
of arrows can be heard as these modern Robin
Hoods practice on the green lawn across from
the Tree's Gymnasium. Audrey Graham who is
president of W.A.A. is quite skilled in this sport,
and is one of archery's most loyal followers.
  Badminton, one of the more recent sports, also
has its fans. Tennis devotees find this sport an
excellent substitute for keeping in trim during
the winter months. It is played in much the same
way as tennis except that a feathered object,
called a "bird" is used instead of a ball. Particularly adept at this game are Virginia Boyd,
vice-president of W.A.A. and Mary Lou Dowling.
  For the more athletically inclined girl, hockey
and basketball are the ideal sports. Special
play-days are held at the different colleges in
Pittsburgh and nearby towns at which girls who
wish to take part in intramural tournaments may
play these games. Betty Cox, chairman of sports
for the year, has charge of these tournaments for
which a regular program is made up at the beginning of each year. A series of play days were
held in the fall with hockey as one of the principle games.
  Recreational sports such as ping-pong and
dancing are a boon to those girls who are interested in taking some part in athletic activities,
but whose health does not permit the more energetic ones. Special classes in aesthetic and
tap dancing are given under the direction of
Miss Elizabeth Rearick, assistant professor of
Physical Education.
  Every girl should be able to swim by the time
she graduates from the University. The swimming pool is open at special times to W.A.A.
members, and a swimming club, the Pitt Fins,
was organized this year under the direction of
Eleanor Fedigan.
  Golfing and horse back riding claim their
enthusiasts too, and although the University does
not own a riding stable, one has been contacted
to which classes go at certain times each week.
Instruction in different golf strokes is given in
the gym, and one may try his skill in the cellar
of the Oil and Gas Building where there is the
necessary equipment.
  One of the most important of the conventions
held this year was the Athletic Conclave at
Slippery Rock. It was attended by the Athletic
Federation of College Women of the Western
Pennsylvania District. Marion Lee Patterson,
Secretary of W.A.A. and Miss Boyd represented
the students of the University.

INTRAMURAL ATHLETICS
   Intramural athletics, under the guidance of
Martin J. Feely completed its fourth year as a
recognized, organized program of the University. Still more or less in its infancy, the Intramural structure commands the participation of
approximately 1500 students. The primary purpose of any Intramural program is to provide
athletic competition for all students. With this
goal in view, Feely, has contrived an itinerary
that embraces every branch of the University
and affords an opportunity for fraternity as well
as independent students to take part.
  Fraternity competition has become stronger
and keener than ever before and has needed no
additional stimulus. Because of this, more attention was given this year to groups such as the
Medical School, the Dental School, the Engineering school, and other organized Independents.
Leagues were drawn up for these groups in touch
football, basketball, volleyball, tennis, bowling,
table tennis, track, wrestling, and mushball.
  Impetus was given to the program at the beginning of the year when the Athletic Council
approved Martin Feely's idea of rewarding Intramural accomplishment. Devising a point
system whereby competition, and victory became the basis, an Intramural sports letter was
awarded at the end of this year. This letter,
comparable to the Varsity P, proved a popular
move.
  Autumn interest was maintained by a fast
moving touch football circuit. All in all, twentythree teams were entered in the four leagues:
the Interfraternity, Independent, Medical, and
Dental leagues. Games were started early in
October but bad weather prolonged the schedule and the final game was held up until early
December. Kappa Sigma, featuring the brilliant
play of Charley Groat, won its second successive
championship in this play by trouncing Phi
Gamma Delta in the deciding contest.
A W.U.P. BASEBALL TEAM OF THE 1890's
  Volleyball followed touch football on the list
of activities and it was a strictly fraternity affair.
Not having to contend with the weather, the
Greeks ran the tournament off in a little under
two weeks. Kappa Sigma won its second trophy
of the year by defeating Sigma Alpha Mu, in the
final game.
  One of the most popular sports in the Interfraternity set-up is bowling. The Center-Neville
Alleys were crowded with fraternity men for
four weeks while the various chapters vied for
the bowling trophy. Divided into two leagues,
the competition was very even and closely contested. Lambda Chi won the title in League A
with a margin of about three games. It was even
closer in League B with Sigma Alpha Mu rolling
out ahead of Pi Lambda Phi in the last match to
win. In the finals, for the fraternity crown,
Lambda Chi Alpha rolled out too many strikes
for the Sammies and won the championship after
being runner-up in the preceding year.
  Basketball proved to be the most populated
game. Two fraternity leagues, a Medical league,
a Dental league, an Independent league, and an
Engineering league rounded out a strenuous
program. Close to 260 performed for the 26
teams entered. Becoming the outstanding fraternity athletic team of the year, Kappa Sigma,
League A champions, defeated Theta Chi,
victors in League B, to acquire the Greek floor
crown for the third straight year. In playing for
the general Intramural title, the Kappa Sigs lost
their first game in competition, when they were
beaten by the Chemical Engineers.
  Champion Irv Solow successfully defended his
University table tennis championship for the
third year. Mushball leagues and a tennis tournament in the spring completed the Intramural
activity.

The First Class Dance-The Junior. Prom of 1901
                                   THE first class dance in the history of the University was the Junior Prom of
                                         1901, held on W.U.P.'s campus in Old Allegheny. A young chemistry
                                    student named Alex Silverman, Class of 1902-now Head of the Chemistry
                                    Department-led the Grand March with Miss Blanche May. There were only
                                    six girls in the Junior Class then, and most of the men were unable to dance,
                                    yet the Prom was an outstanding success. The leading caterer of the city,
                                    George P. Luther, was engaged, and the room was made bright by a system of
                                    arc lights arranged by the engineering students who drew the power, since there
                                    was no general electric-lighting in those days, from street lines. No swain
                                    thought of inviting his lady without sending a bouquet of roses. Fashion like                                    wise was not ignored: the women showed an unaccountable bias for decollette
                                    gowns with leg o'mutton sleeves, and the men came dressed in the finest rented
                                    swallow-tails. Couples were whisked to and from the dance in carriages hired
                                    from local livery stables.
                                       The Junior Prom of 1901 was the forerunner of the extensive program of
                                    social activity at Pitt today. Each class now holds an elaborate annual dance
                                    at which the nation's finest dance orchestras play. Every year the combined
                                    fraternities hold an Interfraternity Ball and an Interfraternity Sing, and annually
                                    the combined sororities hold a Panhellenic Ball. The Military Department pre                                    sents the Military Ball and the women of the University fittingly celebrate
                                    Valentine's Day with a Heart Hop. Occasionally throughout the year campus
                                    organizations hold dances. The onset of Spring brings the gayest days of all                                    the Spring Festival Week, a week of jovial campus activity in which a float
                                    parade and a "sweepstakes" are traditional features. The week is fittingly
                                    climaxed by the Spring Festival Dance.
                                       Each year honors are presented to outstanding students. The aspiration of
                                    every Pitt woman is to be selected as Senior Queen. This honor is bestowed
                                    annually upon the Senior woman who best epitomizes, in,the eyes of ber class                                    mates, the idealism, the solidarity of character, the academic and extra-cur                                    ricular attainment, and the beauty that all Pitt women come to cherish. An award
                                    also is given yearly to the Senior man rating highest on the basis of scholarship,
                                    activities, leadership, personality, and service to the University. Both recipients,
                                    together with other Seniors who have contributed greatly to University life, take
                                    their places in the Hall of Fame. Features such as are enjoyed today enrich
                                    campus life; they add zest and sparkle and diversity; and, above all, they serve
                                    to keep the pursuit of knowledge a lively pursuit, and not a hum-drum dog trot.

ON with the dance! Let joy be unconfined;
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure Meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.

                THE YEAR
  The 1936-37 school year has been an important year for Pitt. The first crisp days of fall,
always so beautiful on the campus, saw an
increase Iby six and one-half per cent of the
enrollment over that of the preceding year. In
the Johnstown and Erie divisions registration had
increased eight per cent. The Graduate, Evening, and Saturday Schools had a three per cent
increase. Enrollment in undergraduate schools
went up four per cent. Faces were brighter and.
the gloom of recent years was disappearing.
Altogether, the first autumn days promised a
good year.
  Work had begun on the great Commons Room
of the Cathedral. Two mills had been working
throughout the year, preparing 4,500 tons of
Indiana limestone for the room. Sixty laborers
and twenty stone setters began the work of
setting the limestone.
  Meanwhile, after a flurry of preliminary
skirmishes, the football team gave 80,000 fans
in Columbus, Ohio, a real thrill as Ohio State
went nobly down, 6 to 0. The largest group of
   1936- 1937
fans ever to follow the Panthers, traveled to
Columbus to witness their victory. Campus interest soared to a new high. A cheering section
of eight hundred rehearsed students was organized by S.F.A., with Louis Bearer as the guiding
light. But in the first day of operation the section
had little cause to cheer, for Duquesne came
down from the hill and trounced an impotent
Panther team, 7 to 0.
  Members of the University faculty took prominent parts in the joint meetings of the Pennsylvania State Education Association and the
Western Pennsylvania Education Conference
held on October 16. Dr. Chester A. Buckner,
Professor of Professional Education at the University, was made Permanent Chairman of the
Western Pennsylvania Education Conference.
  Several days later Dr. Walter A. Lunden,
Assistant Professor of Sociology, published his
book, "Juvenile Delinquency." This was the
first of several important books written by
members of the Faculty. In March, Dr. Samuel
H. Williams, Professor of Zoology and Associate

Director of the University Lake Laboratory,
published a 704 page text, "The Living World."
His book is the first comprehensive work in its
field, encompassing the entire subject of nature
study.
  The School of Minbs received an increase in
its endowment fund in October. George M.
Bevier, class of 1913 and internationally known
oil geologist, of Houston, Texas, added $15,000
to the fund, which had previously amounted to
$10,000, and will be increased until it reaches
$100,000.
  Early in November Walter Hampden gave
selections from Hamlet at a general student
assembly in Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall.
The veteran Shakespearean actor was well
received, and his renditions of the soliloquy and
the closet scene were especially well done. One
week later the Annual Community Fund drive
began on the campus. By the twenty-third of
November the goal, $11,000, was achieved. As
has been the custom in recent years, the fund
combined all the organizations which, during the
year, receive contributions from Pitt, the proceeds then being divided among the constituent
charities. On the twentieth of the month Chancellor Bowman held his Annual Reception for
the parents of freshman students. Here, with the
issuance of the six week's grades, parents
received the first indication of the scholastic
status of their children. Parents met with their
sons' and daughters' instructors, talked with
them, and established a more complete understanding of the University.
  On December third the University of Washington invited Pitt to play in the Rose Bowl. The
wrath of the nation's sports writers poured down
on the heads of the Washington authorities who
gave the bid to Pitt in what was considered by
the critics as the "bonehead bid." In less than a
month the sports writers were throwing bouquets
by the columnful at the Panthers. The Pitt avalanche rolled over the Washington Huskies 21
to 0. This unexpected result (unexpected on the
part of the Alumni Association of the University
of Washington) necessitated the paying off of an
unusual wager on the outcome of the game. The
Washington Alumni had wagered a 50 pound
king salmon, in edible condition, against 500
Pittsburgh stogies; so on January 28, a magnificent salmon arrived at the City-County Airport.
In a gesture of appreciation for the good sportsmanship displayed by the Washingtonians, the
General Alumni Association of Pitt sent them
500 stogies specially packed in a wooden replica
of the Cathedral of Learning. The publicity
attendant upon these "pay-offs" was only a
rumble compared with the demonstrations and
ovations which greeted the members of the
victorious team on their return to Pittsburgh.
They arrived January seventh at the Union
Station and were met by 10,000 overjoyed students and fans. The Rose Bowl trophy took its
place next to the Lambert trophy, symbolic of the
mythical Eastern Football Championship, which
had been awarded to the team at a special
student assembly. Chancellor Bowman, Mayor
Cornelius D. Scully, and Henry A. and Vincent
L. Lambert, donors of the trophy, were the
speakers.
  The University and Pittsburgh suffered a great
loss on December the eleventh. On that day Dr.
Samuel Black Linhart, Secretary of the University for thirty years, died after a short siege
of pneumonia. At the time of his death he was
Secretary Emeritus of the University. Born in
Irwin, Pennsylvania, Dr. Linhart was ordained
to the Presbyterian Ministry in 1894.

   International recognition in a sports event
came to Pitt during the year. John Woodruff,
sophomore runner, was named to the All
American track team for the 800 meters. Last
August Woodruff, an unknown, gangling, negro
boy, dashed away to the 800 meter Olympic
championship at the Olympic games held in
Germany. Running in a flashing, unorthodox
style, Woodruff spurted from behind, after being
twice "pocketed," to finish ahead of Europe's
greatest runners.
  Several changes in administration occurred
during the year. Robert C. Corley replaced N.
Robert Seidle as Assistant Dean of Men in
November. Mr. Seidle was appointed head of
the Placement Bureau. The football coaching
staff was riddled by losses when Bill Kern and
Eddie Baker, line coach and backfield coach
respectively, were appointed to the Tech staff,
Kern as head coach, Baker as his assistant. In
January Dr. Brynjolf Jakob Hovde, Associate
Professor of History, was appointed Director of
Pittsburgh's Department of Public Welfare. Adverse comment came from several quarters at
Dr. Hovde's appointment, principally because he
was one of the sponsors of a Spanish assembly
in the city. A thorough liberal, Dr. Hovde explained that in the interests of free speech he
would have been a sponsor of a Spanish rebel
assembly. His offer to withdraw was declined,
for public sentiment veered in his favor. Lee M.
Lockhart, Director of instrumental activities since
1935, left the University to become education
advisor at the Witmark Music Publishing Company of New York.
  The basketball team  brought two more
trophies to the trophy room. The team won the
City Basketball Championship, an honor denied
it for several years. On March 22 the cagers
defeated Temple in a play off game to win the
Eastern Intercollegiate Conference Championship for the fourth time.

will be conspicuously placed on regular windows, its size and coloring will be such that it will not

  February twenty-fifth marked the 150th anniversary of the founding of the University. On
that day 1500 alumni held a banquet in celebration at Hotel Schenley. Harry W. Colmery,
National Commander of the American Legion
and a Pitt Alumnus, delivered the main address.
Mayor Scully, Chancellor Bowman, "Jock"
Sutherland, David Lawrence, Mrs. Agnes Starrett, and Dr. P. V. McParland spoke. Part of the
program was broadcast to the nation over a
coast to coast hookup. In the morning Dr. Duncan Spaeth, President of the University of
Kansas City, spoke at the Scholar's Day Assembly held in Memorial Hall.
  On February twenty-third the State granted
the University an appropriation of $1,300,000.
With the appropriation came the culmination of                          4
a two year altercation between Governor
George H. Earle and Chancellor John G. Bowman, a controversy that had concerned itself
with the number of trustees to be elected by the
                                                              DR. JOHN B. SUTHERLAND
                                                   Alumni. An agreement was effected whereby
                                                   the alumni would elect one-half of the Trustees,
                                                   amounting to fifteen in number. In addition,
                                                   Governor Earle, Mayor Scully, and Chancellor
                                                   Bowman will be ex-officio members of the
                                                   Board. This year's compromise added thirteen
                                                   members elected by the alumni to the two
                                                   members elected to the Board last year.
                                                     Another feud was settled this year. The ex                                                   tended rift between Dr. John Sutherland, Head
                                                   Football Coach, and W. Don Harrison, Director
                                                   of Athletics, flared into the open in March, when
                                                   Dr. Sutherland proposed to resign in order to
                                                   relieve internal dissenison. But student and
                                                   alumni sentiment were strong in the Doctor's
                                                   favor, and as a result, Mr. Harrison resigned on
                                                   the twentieth. Dr. Sutherland assumed the duties
                                                   both of Head Coach and Director of Football.
                                                     The year of 1937 has been a year of continued
                                                   progress at Pitt. It has been the 150th year of
                                                   growth. The Cathedral, towering into the Pitts                                                   burgh sky, is closer to completion, and each step
                                                   toward finality brings Pittsburgh closer to the
                                                   attainment of ideals that have been cherished for
                                                   150 years.

  Back again to the William Penn... this time
to watch the freshmen strut... December the
fourth... everything going as per schedule
... except the snow... and Brotzman says that
went some place else... at last on the 17th...
freshmen looking for the landmark... Daufenbach... discovered guarding the portals of the
Ballroom.
  Inside... Tom Gentry and his Ambassadors
... of sunny South fame... sho' enuf... from
the Blackstone Hotel via the World's Fair...
via the Claridge Hotel... to us... rhythmic
melody and melodic rhythm... Lawlor pacing
the balcony... counting heads... lots of empty ones tonite... but they all count... below
... lovely red-haired Patricia Norman... stopping the dance... with a perfectly executed
swaying rendition of a Swing song... a
bounteous wave of applause... and more of
the same throughout the evening.
  Nobody dressed alike... not even the men
... pretty Jane Huff, student nurse, on Chairman Mackey's arm.. Daddy, I think I'm sick
... the "Swanee Swingers" put the swing on
the "Organ Grinder's Swing"... and does the
crowd love it... midnight... did you hear
... up the balcony, down the balcony...
another voice in the air... plenty of ex-freshmen showing the freshmen strutters how to strut.
  The sax moans... the trumpet wails... and
dies.. the dance is over... all that a dance
should be... stampede for the elevators...
the same stomach sensations as in the Cathedral
.. main lobby... and Grant Street.. out
into the night... baked ham sandwich and a
cup of black coffee... save the tip for carfare
... good-night Mary... see you under the
clock after the second hour... so this is what
Pittsburgh looks like before it wakes up... do
not disturb.

  Express to the 17th... Daufenbach and his

frown...beside him, another new stooge...
inside...Red Nichols and his Seventeen Pennies... broadcasting the WCAE. way to you
from us... the first event which formally opens
the University's Sesqui-Centennial celebration

THE
CHANCELLOB’S )
MESSAGE

CHANCELLOR JOHN G. BOWMAN

THE OWL is a record. It is a record of moving forward to
significant life. Just what this means we must each answer
for ourselves. Let me suggest, however, that it means these"
things: that you are able to control your temper; that you find
joy in common things and see beauty in grass and trees and
creeks and hills; that you see beauty also in the character of
those about you—their integrity, their persistence, their faith;
that by sheer habit you play fair, and that you believe in good-
ness. To this let me add, too, that the moving forward is a gain
in ability to think. We all have some of this ability, although not
much of it may be needed in order to earn a living. If, however,
you are one who struggles to catch a rainbow, if you expect to
be a doctor or a lawyer or a business man or an artist, and if in
your vocation you expect to count as one who is significant, then
you will need real capacity for thought—thought that can deal
with material things and with the non-material.

The Owl, then, is a record of growing, or moving toward an
ideal of life which we each see for ourselves. It ought to be
noble; it ought to be kind; it ought to be full of wisdom.

Iohn G. Bowman

starched tux shirts... glittering feminine "dodads" flashing bewildering messages to puzzled
masculine eyes... while uniformed "smoothies" caused palpitations of more than one
feminine heart... a little bit of an all right,

elite in all their glory... very swanky and
exclusive... waiting lists T H A T long...

in the shimmering, tremulous, lustrous light
... master pianist Eddie Duchin at the keyboard... he of the sparkling teeth and flowing mane... syncopated rhythm by the boys
.. strains of smooth, pulsating melody a la
Charley Pallos... rising local maestro swinging it in the Urban room.
  Confusion in the lobby between the Cardinal

SPRING EVENTS -1936
272
F   AME is ever swift in passing. From time
Limmemorial, men and women have honored
each other by words of tribute or symbols of
achievement. Wreaths of olive leaves encircled
the heads of Greek victors; rich jewels ornamented the crowns and sceptors of European
rulers; golden trophies and titles have been
awarded to champions of nations. Just as the
green leaves wither, the brilliance of the jewels
dims, the gold loses its lustre, and the titles become empty, so does fame depart. But the re -
corded word lives to be read and reread.
Through the years the words inscribed on the
pages of this 1937 Owl Hall of Fame will laud
the record of service rendered the University
by these twenty men and women.
SENIOR QUEEN
BARBARA F. THOMAS
   TO be selected as Senior
Queen by the women of the graduating class is the greatest honor
which can be bestowed upon a
University woman. Alma Mater is
chosen simultaneously with the
Senior Queen for her leadership,
character, scholarship, and service. In a ceremony patterned
after the ancient English coronation both women were honored by
the Ladies of the Court.

f Interest
to a Man Worth $5,000 a Year
IF, in your own mind, you are not worth $5000 a year,
   do not read further. We want to talk about a profession. It has been called the best paid hard work-and
the poorest paid easy work in the world. This profession
is life underwriting.
  It is a career which is never monotonous, for it deals
with human nature and all its absorbing problems. A
career which will stimulate in the right man his business
ability, his analytical sense, his talent for salesmanship.
Special training and intelligent supervision will assure
early success for the man selected.
  It is an especially fine opportunity for the alert college
graduate of a few years ago who is not fully satisfied with
the future in his present field. For the man who knows
he could do a better job if his personality were given more
expression. If you are interested in a profession which is
not easy, but in which the rewards are in direct proportion
to the effort put forth if you are interested in a career
which guarantees a better than average livelihood with
retirement assured-write Mr. Wm. J. Cummins or telephone ATlantic 2800 for an appointment. A confidential
interview will be arranged.

half of it: that this living trust will
continue as long as she lives, and
that her father has given her the
right, in the trust agreement, to
dispose of the principal in her

  All this time - and in years to

  The Russian Room, the furniture and decorations for which were planned by Dr. Andrey
Avinoff, Director of the Carnegie Museum, is
well on the way to'completion. Most of the
characteristically carved furniture is finished
and has been in use for several years. Every
detail of the Chinese Room, with its colorful
ceiling copied from an old palace hall in
Peiping, its teakwood floor, its dark stained
vermillion wood furniture and its paintings and
carvings will display the traditional art of the
Orient. An authentic French design for the
French Seminar will provide an ideal setting for
undergraduate and graduate classes in French.
The Czechoslovak Room will have a beamed
ceiling and wide-planked oak flooring, such as
is seen in peasant's homes; the portraits of six
outstanding people in Czech and Slovak history
will be inlaid in the ceiling; the walls will be of
white plaster decorated with gaily colored
designs; and the motto of the Republic against a
red Moravian frieze is to be above the black                                               SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON-THE SPIRIT OF YOUTH

EORGE WELCH, first Principal of the Pitts-
burgh Academy, introduced, in the year of

1789, a curriculum which included the regular
classical subjects—elocution, literature, mathe-
matics and natural science. For over a century
these courses were the basis of higher education,
although the first principal's successors, during
the early years of the Academy, did somewhat
enlarge this curriculum. The Reverend Mr.

' Arthur became the second Principal of the Acad-

emy in 1795. He was succeeded in 1796 by the
Reverend Robert Andrews who served as the
school's head until 1800. .The next head of the
school was the Reverend Robert Steele who
served for just one term. The Reverend John
Taylor, Principal from 1801 to 1807 introduced a
course in Astronomy. From 1807 to 1810, Rev-
erend Robert Patterson, scholar and poet, guided
the destinies of the Academy and he was fol-
lowed by Reverend Joseph Stockton, who headed
the Academy from 1810 until 1822, when it be-
came a university. Reverend Stockton, a lover
of the classics, was the author of the first school-
books used west of the Alleghenies: “Western
Calculator,” and the “Western Speller."

In 1822, the Western University of Pennsyl-
vania was formally created and Robert Bruce,
D.D., became its first Principal. He tried to per-
petuate the classical tradition of his Alma Mater,
the University of Edinburg, in the new Univer-
sity and he established a very solid and compre-
hensive curriculum in which both classical

Pittsburgh, with its 130 families,
was a thriving little frontier town
at the close of the Revolution.

    YOUNG MEN
    ABOUT TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS
                      *   You will find in your business world many opportunities
                      to make new friends. You will meet a great many people,
                      some of whom can be helpful in solving the problems that
                      arise daily in the conduct of business. Some, you will discover,
                      have a wealth of useful information that they are glad to share
                      with you. Cultivate such friendships, for they can help you
                      develop your career.
                          Make friends with Westinghouse-with its products and
                      its people. Get to know Westinghouse representatives, for
                      they can contribute ideas and suggestions that will help solve
                      your business problems, and thus help you help yourself. Get
                      to know the deep-rooted QUALITY of Westinghouse products
                      -what it means-how it is achieved-and how jealously this
                      quality is guarded as each new product is added to the West                      inghouse line.

board. In the Hungarian classroom, students
will find themselves seated in chairs of royal
blue leather with tablet arms inscribed with
Magyar motifs. The walls are to be covered
with finely-grained white oak veneer, and will
contrast effectively with the color of the furnishjngs and the gayety of the ceiling, which is to
contain a series of asbestos squares painted with
brilliantly colored ornamentations. Contrasting
with the characteristic peasant art of several of
the other rooms is the design for the Greek
Seminar. Exact proportions, symmetry of arrangement, and columns suggest a classical
Greek temple. With its Ionic columns and
marble floor, the Greek Room will be reminiscent
of the rooms in which Plato and Socrates taught.
Mr. Frank A. Linder, a graduate of the Berlin
Gewerbe Academie, is the architect for the
German Room, the largest of the Nationality
Rooms. It will be equipped with every type of
modern classroom equipment. The interior of                 THE HUNGARIAN R
the Monastery at Horoz, known as "the place of  Vivid gayety in -painted ceiling squares contrasts
the owls" is the basis for the design of the               walls in the Hungarian
Roumanian Room. A stone doorway, a stone
fireplace, carvings on the chimney moulding,
and dark oak paneling on the side walls, will be
the distinctive details of the room.

The design and arrangement of this room was suggested by the Byzantine carvings of a
                   Seventeenth century monastery.
  The English Room will be either the WrenQueen Anne type or a room of the Tudor type.
The weaving craft of the Lithuanian women will
be represented in the hand-woven wall covering
in the Lithuanian room, ingeniously mounted so
that it can be taken down and washed. Murals
are to be painted on either side of the blackboard. The furniture in the Polish Room is
similar to that used in Wawel Castle in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. An exact repANCHOR SANITARY

the latter century will symbolize the Polish
contributions to science and higher learning.
The design for the Italian Room is in the spirit
of the Renaissance. Supplementary seats will
line a platform along three sides of the room
giving it the appearance of a fifteenth century
choir stall, and the blackboard is to be concealed behind carved walnut-paneling which
will look like a vestment closet. Several paintings will add color to the room.

  The atmosphere of the whole Scottish Room
will date back to the seventeenth century. The
rich lore of Scotland will be adapted to decorations for the room by the committee of which
Dr. John Bain Sutherland is chairman. As in the
most outstanding buildings of Yugoslavia, the
Yugoslav Room will contain beautifully carved
wooden chairs and a wooden ceiling and wainscoating of Slavonian oak carved with geometric
figures and the old Slavonic heart motif. The
wooden ceiling and wall panels of the Swedish
Room are based on the interior of a Swedish
house of the eighteenth century, which is still
standing, and which is said to be the purest
example of Swedish architectural design in
existence. Also unmistakably Swedish are the
hooded chimney of the fireplace, the open
hearth, and the bench which will run entirely
around the room.
  Through the years, the committees of the
fifteen nationality rooms have worked unceasingly and their plans are about to be realized.
Statesmen, architects, and painters of renown
have endeavored to contribute in some degree
to the perfection of these rooms. Not only will
the students of the University enjoy the beauty
of the Nationality Rooms, but all of Western
Pennsylvania will be given the opportunity to
admire the richness of these rooms.

subjects and courses in contemporary ﬁelds of
knowledge were included. The Reverend Gil-
bert Morgan, Principal in 1835-1836, made an
attempt in his short reign to set up a teacher's
college. Public schools had been introduced in J = V _ -
1834 and this wise Head of the University saw a DAVID H. RIDDLE
growing need for teachers. His plans did not
materialize at the time but the idea did not die.
Reverend Robert Bruce again, became Principal
and continued his former policy during the years
1836 to 1843. Herman Dyer, D.D., Principal of
the University during the hectic years from 1843 ‘
to 1849, when the University's progress was
harrassed by fires, introduced the first law and
engineering courses. During the period from
1849 to 1855, D. H. Riddle, D.D., was Head of the
University. Attempts to hold classes in spite of
the fact that there was no permanent location for
the school failed. From 1855 to 1858, John F.
McLaren, D.D., was Principal.

In the latter year, George Woods, LL.D., as-
sumed the responsibilities of guiding the school
and became the first to carry the title of Chancel-
lot of the Western University of Pennsylvania.
His accomplishments include the strengthening
of both the general cultural and the scientific
courses. It was during his term that the Alle-
gheny Observatory was added to the University.
Henry M. MacCracken, D.D., later President of
New York University, was Chancellor from 1881
to 1884. Milton B. Goff, LL.D., who next as-
sumed leadership of the growing school, was the

                                       IN THE JULY, 1902, issue of THE ENGRAVER AND ELEC                                          TROTYPER a two-page article announced the formation of a
                                          new organization. The message began with the statement, "The
                                       Photo-engraving firm of great promise is that of the Jahn and Ollier
                                       Engraving Co."
                                       This prophecy was a truism, borne out with the passing of the years,
                                       each one of which recorded an orderly and steady growth. More
                                       skilled men were developed within the organization, newer machines
                                       and cameras replaced equipment as fast as they became obsolete, and

                                       Parallel with this unceasing expansion there came an ever-widening
                                       clientele, whose increasing patronage eventually placed the Jahn &amp;
                                       Ollier Engraving Co. in the position of unquestioned leadership.
                                       For many years we have been the largest School Annual engravers in
                                       America; and in the commercial field we serve a distinguished group
                                       of the most progressive national advertisers.
                                       To us, this measure of success calls for no laurel wreath. Rather, we
                                       accept it as a solemn responsibility, realizing fully that the pacemaker
                                       not only sets the standards of quality and service for the industry, but
                                       must sustain them by his accomplishments.
                                       Ours is a simple formula: Ambition, honesty and integrity, constant
                                       hard work, keeping abreast of improvements, building a loyal capable
                                       organization, and treating our customers as fairly as we expect them
                                       to treat us.
                                       All these factors have become welded into a fixed policy, and it will
                                       remain constant-unalterable-as the years continue their phantom
                                       march.

first faculty member to become Head of the Uni-
versity. During his term he made many friends
for the University and helped to extend the aca-
demic structure of the University. Pittsburgh was
meanwhile rapidly becoming the industrial cen-
ter of the country and engineers were in de-
mand. With this growing need in mind, the
next two Chancellors, William Jacob Holland,’
Ph.D., D.D., (1891-1901), and John Alfred Bra-
shear, Sc.D., LL.D., (Acting Chancellor), placed
special emphasis on the scientific and engineer-
ing courses. Dr. Holland established a School of
Engineering and affiliated the Medical, Dental,
Pharmacy, and Law Schools with the University.

Samuel Black McCormick, D.D., LL.D., Chan-
cellor from 1904 to 1920, presided over the Uni-
versity during its next period of expansion. It
was during his term of office that the Graduate

Schools, the Extension Division, and the Evening
School were added to the University. The West-
ern University of Pennsylvania moved from Al-
legheny to Oakland and became the University
of Pittsburgh during his regime, too, and Mellon
Institute, the School of Education, the School of
Economics (after 1923 the School of Business
Administration), and the professional schools
were no longer merely affiliated groups but in-
tegral parts of the University. In 1920, John
Gabbert Bowman, LL.D., became Chancellor of
the University. He supplied the inspiration for
the great expansion program of the past fifteen
years. His idea, now a concrete development,
supplied the University with much needed space
in a beautiful form and what is, perhaps, more
important, he emphasized the need for good
teaching.

The next step was to educate the
: young. On Feb. 28, 1787, the Gen-
~ eral Assembly of Pennsylvania
‘ granted a charter for a Pittsburgh
  Academy.

1 IKE most able faculties, Pitt's faculty is sel-
dom in the public gaze. This reticence is
more the result of an instinctive distaste for
external show than from a lack of achievement.
These unassuming men who take such spirited
interest in the students they teach are many of
them universally celebrated in their particular
fields. During the course of the past year Pitt
faculty members wrote 27 books and contributed
284 articles to advanced magazines. Each de-
partment of every school of the University has
members who have distinguished themselves in
their fields.

Perhaps the accolade of fame has come most
often to the Chemistry Department. Here Charles
Glenn King first isolated and identified Vitamin
C. In addition he has had 54 research papers
published. Dr. Alexander Silverman, Head of
the Department, is an international authority on
glass. He has been United States representative
to world glass conferences the past five years.
Professor Alexander Lowy, author of the widely
used “An Introduction to Organic Chemistry,"
has served often as an industrial consultant.

Further up the hill, in Alumni Hall, many
figures tread from class to class who, too, have
given exceptional service. Professor Ben Wil-
liams of the Political Science Department has
given his subject its most widely used text:

THE FACULTY--1937

“The Economic Foreign Policy of the United

‘_ States." He has just finished a new book,
“American Diplomacy Policy," used by his

International Relations class. Dr. William T.
Root, the jovial Dean of the Graduate School, is
the author of the “Handbook of American Prisons
and Reformatories.” Dr. Root, who is probably
Pitt's busiest man, also heads the Psychology
Department, in which Dr. Florence M. Tea-
garden and Dr. Giovanni Giarlini, psychiatric
head of Western Penitentiary, are well known
for their research papers in this field. Several
faculty members in Alumni Hall aid in city and
state government, among them being Dr.
Brynjolf Iakob Hovde of the History Department
who ‘is Pittsburgh's Welfare Director, and Dr.
Elmer Graper, Head of the Department of
Political Science, who is the chief advisor to the
present city administration. Dr. Marion T.
McKay, of the Economics Department is also
active in civic life, and has been retained on
state and federal advisory taxation committees,
a subject on which he is Pennsylvania's leading
authority. At present he is financial advisor to
the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruc-
tion. From the same department other men are
notable. Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty, a research
worker, is a national labor authority. His new
book “Labor Problems in Industry” is used in

many of the leading universities. Dr. lohn M.
Ferguson aided Farrar & Rinehart, publishers,

in editing Spahr’s “Principles of Economics,” a I

widely used textbook. .

In the History Department several men have
distinguished themselves: Dr. John W. Oliver
and Dr. Alfred P. James in the ﬁeld of American
history, and Dr. N. Andrew N. Cleven whose
specialty is Hispanic—American history. Dr.
Whitford H. Shelton, Head of the Language
Department, is author of several elementary and
advanced French textbooks in wide present use.
One of the most popular high school Spanish
texts has been written by Dr. Michael Angelo
De Vitis. Two members of the Philosophy De-
partment are well known in their field, these
being Dr. Mont R. Gabbert, Department Head,
and Dr. 0. L. Reiser. Both have written research
papers of note.

Several books fresh from the press have been
written by Pitt teachers. Dr. Samuel Williams,
of the Biology Department, has recently pub-
lished “The Living World,” the first compre-
hensive text on Nature Study. The book contains
some three hundred illustrations many of which
were taken on Dr. Williams’ four expeditions
into the Green Hell of British Guiana, the largest
and least explored jungle in the world. “The

The purpose of the academy, as
stated in the charter, was to educate
the youth of Pittsburgh in “useful
arts, sciences, and hterature.”

Across the walk from State Hall is the School
of Engineering and Mines, where Elmer Allen
Holbrook, mining authority and one time coal
advisor to the N.R.A., is Dean. Teaching there,
are William R. Ludewig, the master mechanic
of the district, who helped Samuel Langley build

,_the.first aeroplane and acted as chief mechanic

for John Brashear, renowned lens maker; H. E.
Dyche, head of the Electrical Engineering De-
partment and “Al" Williams, aviator and col-
umnist.

The most familiar figure of all the faculty, of
course, is ruddy “Bill” Daufenbach, assistant to
the Dean of Men, bearer of good and bad tidings.

Scattered throughout the more than 900
members of the University faculty are many
whose service is great, yet without formal
recognition. To these men fame does not come.
They have given, nevertheless, incalculable
service to their students and to their community.
They form the most important part of Pitt's
faculty. They are the ones who offer inspiration
to the students. Through these men students
formulate aims, ideals. The fame of these teach-
ers is a quiet fame of a duty done, unobtrusively,
and well.

The charter provided also for a.
Board of Trustees, to consist of
22 members, through which of-
ficial business was to be transacted.

DR. P. V. MCPARLAND
President

IN A‘ little black notebook hidden away in the
ﬁles of the General Alumni Association's
13th floor Cathedral of Learning office, the first
yellowing page is dated 1866. There, written
laboriously in long-hand, is the first recorded

account of a meeting of alumni in the history of _

the University of Pittsburgh.

Convening in the room of President Woods,
in the old W.U.P. building at the corner of Ross
and Diamond Streets, eight alumni of the Uni-
versity gathered in “the annual meeting of the
Western University Alumni Association." As
first President of the organization they elected
George I. Whitney of the class of '64. Other
officers named were William J. Sawyer, '65, and
John Gordon, '66, Vice-Presidents; John R.
Wightman, '65, Corresponding Secretary; and
John H. McCandlep, Secretary-Treasurer. The
only other business, accomplished was a pro-
vision for a constitutional committee, but, never-
theless, the groundwork had been laid for the
present Alumni Association.

The next year, Judge Thomas Mellon, father
of Andrew W. Mellon, was elected President.
But in succeeding years, the organization was
almost dormant. For the first few years its only
activity was a yearly business meeting. In 1871,
the policy of two yearly meetings began and
continued through most of the Association's
early history. About the only things accom-
plished in those early meetings were the annual
nominations for “an orator and poet," for the
next year's anniversary, and provision for the
beginning of a “catalogue of alumni." Attend-
ance averaged about 10 a meeting.

From 1880-1883 the organization was prac-

' tically inoperative. In 1883 a meeting was held

at which was to be discussed the proposition of
either “forming a new alumni association or
infusing life into the old one.” The members
decided to continue within the framework of the
old association. The same year provision was
made that all alumni of W.U.P. should auto-
matically become members of the Association.

In 1884, Dr. John M. Duff was elected Presi-
dent, and the group began to operate socially,
planning a banquet and a picnic. Up to that time
meetings had been held in various places,
among them the old Monongahela House, the
downtown Y.M.C.A., the Pittsburgh Common
Council Chambers, and the old University
building.

First Vice President

Again there was a lapse in activity from 1888
until 1892 when another special meeting,
attended by a record number of 69, revived the
organization and named as its leader the Hon.
James H. Reed. At this time, membership was
restricted to graduates who had degrees of A.B.
or Ph.D., the only academy degrees then con-

«-ferred. The status of the “non-academic"
degrees (M.D., C.E., M.E., and E.E.) were left
uncertain, but holders of them were later
admitted to membership.

During the next decade the group made an
effort to further the growth and efficiency of the
Collegiate Department, which was rapidly being
overshadowed by other newer University de-
partments. The group also began work on an
endowment to be secured by an alumni sub-
scription for an “Alumni Chair of Greek
Language and Literature," and published the
first Alumni Year Book.

In this period, new University schools estab-
lished alumni associations of their own. The
Medical School alumni organized in 1886, the
Pharmacy School 10 years later, and the School
of Dentistry in 1897.

Women first played a part in alumni affairs in
1898, when the “Collegiate Alumnae Associa-
tion,” later known as the University Alumnae
Association, was formed by five women gradu-
ates who elected Miss Stella Stein, President.

In February, 1897, the General Alumni
Association, comprising all University depart-
ments, was formed with delegates elected by
each department. First officers of the Associa-
tion were C. W. Scovel, '83, President; Dr. C.
H. Hitzrot, '89, Vice-President, and Dr. S. H.
McKibleen, '90, Secretary-Treasurer. Three
more men held the office of president until 1907,
when George S. Guthrie, then Mayor of Pitts-
burgh, was elected.

Also in 1907, Dr. Alexander Silverman, now
Head of the Department of Chemistry at the
University, became Secretary of the Association.
During his term of office, from 1907 until 1913,
alumni activities took on increased vigor. A
constitution was adopted, providing for direct
membership of graduates of all schools as well
as making possible closer contact with members.
In 1908 an executive committee of three was
established; two years later the present Alumni

ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

 

ROBERT R. GAW

Treasurer

IOHN W. HALLOCK
Secretary

Council of 50 members was organized with a
new constitution and new by-laws. Dr. Walther
Riddle, '92, became first chairman.

The first direct representative on the Uni- _

versity Board of Trustees to benamed by the
alumni was elected in 1913. He was A. R.
Hamilton of the class of '94. In 1916 the Asso-
ciation, with a membership of about 900, had
two officesAone downtown in the Park Building,
and the other at the University. “Pitt Clubs"
had already been organized in various outlying
communities by this time. Members of the or-
ganization were taking a more active interest in
undergraduate affairs and University welfare as
evidenced by the establishment of a Student
Employment Bureau and the plans for an en-
dowment fund to be set aside exclusively for
permanent endowment and buildings.

Under the leadership of Secretary Karl E.
Davis, who was in office from 1915-1928, and
headed by 13 presidents in as many years, the
organization made continual, though slow,
progress. When the present Secretary, Dr. Iohn
W. Hallock, came into office in August, 1933,
succeeding George I. Carson, depression con-
ditions had brought progress almost to a stand-
still. But under the guidance of the hard-work-
ing, capable Dr. Hallock, membership has been
increased to 2,500, out of a total constituency of
25,000, a figure that may seem small, but is
large when compared with statistics of other
years.

Present officers of the Association are: Presi-
dent, Dr. P. V. McParland; First Vice-President,
Norman MacLeod; Second Vice-President, Earl
Crawford; Treasurer, Robert R. Gaw; and
Secretary, Dr. Hallock.

Ten constituent groups, holding regular busi-
ness and social meetings throughout the year,
make up the organization. These groups include
the College, the schools of Medicine, Pharmacy,
Dentistry, Engineering and Mines, Education,
Business Administration, and the Evening, Law,
and Graduate Schools. In addition there are a
dozen Pitt Clubs situated in localities from
New York City to Southern California. The
Association publishes “Alumni Review," edited
by Don Saunders, nine times a year.

The Association last year supervised an elec-

tion in which two alumni were named to the
Board of Trustees. This year, as a result of the
University's agreement with Governor George
H. Earle, members of the Alumni group will
nominate 13 more members to the Board.

One of the Association's main functions is the

"sponsoring of two large alumni gatherings

yearly, the Fall Homecoming Celebration and
the February Charter Day Banquet. This winter
the Alumni paid their respects to the University
on its 150th anniversary with a campus-wide
celebration. A student convocation was held in
Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Hall on the
morning of February 25, with Dr. I. Duncan
Spaeth, President of the University of Kansas
City, as speaker. Later, groups of alumni and
guests were conducted by student guides on
tours of inspection of the Cathedral of Learning,
the Heinz Chapel, the Stephen Foster Memorial,
and other University buildings. In the evening
a Sesquicentennial Banquet was held in the
Hotel Schenley. A three-reel talking picture
depicting the history of the University was
shown at the affair.

Harry W. Colmery, National Commander of
the American Legion and an alumnus of the
University (Law '16), was the principal speaker
at the banquet. Other speakers were Dr. Iohn
G. Bowman, Chancellor of the University;
Cornelius D. Scully (Law '04), Mayor of the City
of Pittsburgh; David Lawrence, Secretary of the
Commonwealth and representative of Gov.
George H. Earle; George H. Clapp (College
'77), President of the Board of Trustees of the
University; and Dr. P. V. McParland (Dental '04),
President of the General Alumni Association.
From 8:30 to 9 o'clock the program was broad-
cast over a coast-to-coast N.B.C. hookup. Pitt's
25,000 alumni, scattered throughout the coun-
try, were greeted by Dr. P. V. McParland; Mrs.
C. V. (Agnes Lynch) Starrett (College '20),
author of the history of the University, “Through
One Hundred Fifty Years”; Dr. John Bain
Sutherland, Head Football Coach; and Chan-
cellor Iohn G. Bowman.

With more than 70 years of history behind it,
the General Alumni Association is now in the
midst of its greatest period of development, with
high hopes of greater things in the future.

ITHIN 150 years our University has grown from a rude

log cabin to the most modern of skyscrapers. Pictured on

-the map is the first school house of the Pittsburgh Academy,

the two-roomed log cabin erected in 1787 in the shadow of

the Block House at Third, Smithﬁeld, and Cherry Streets. Three years
later, on the same site, the cabin was replaced by a neat brick building
which served until 1830, when the ﬁrst building of the Western University
of Pennsylvania was built just east of Srnithﬁeld Street. In 1845 this building

was destroyed by ﬁre and a new school house was built on the site of what is’

now Joseph Horne's Department Store. Fire razed this building in 1849.
It took six years before another building was erected, a red brick structure
at Ross and Diamond Streets. In 1882 classes were transferred across the
river to Allegheny City, to the Presbyterian and Reformed Presbyterian
Seminary Building where classes were held until 1890. In that year the
University moved to its two new buildings at Perrysville and Clayton
Streets, near the old Observatory. In 1908 came the exodus from Allegheny
and the entry into Oakland. State Hall was built in 1908, Thaw Hall in
1909, and Alumni Hall in 1921. Ground was broken in 1926 on the F rick
Acres for the Cathedral of Learning, culminating the advance in 150 years
from logs to limestone.

Not pictured on the map are several buildings of significance in the
history of the University. In 1894 the Pharmacy building was built on the
Boulevard of the, Allies. Pennsylvania Hall, now known as the Medical
School, was completed in 1910. The Upper Dental School was built in
1912, and in the same year Trees Gym was ready for use. The Heinz
House, left smoldering by a ﬁre two months after erection, was rebuilt in
1919. One year later the Dental Inﬁrmary was built. In 1925, with the
era of big football, came the Stadium.

The most beautiful of the University buildings are of recent construc-
tion. The Falk Clinic was built and presented to the University in 1929,
and the Falk Elementary School in 1931. Clustered about the Cathedral
are the Heinz Chapel, begun in 1933, and the Stephen Foster Memorial,
begun in 1935. A

Utility has motivated and beauty has guided the construction of these
latter buildings of the University.

C THE COLLEGE

N ALL of your learning, perhaps the most valuable thing has

, ‘been learning how to learn. You will continue to learn. Never
will your educational preparation for living be completed. Always
something new that is worth doing will lie ahead. In the College
we have tried to broaden your interests, deepen valid purposes,
clarify vision, and stimulate your imagination in useful directions.
The College looks toward rich and useful living in the broadest
sense. It is hoped that you have- endeavored to participate in the
realization of this ideal.

Among the schools of the University, The College comes nearest
to being a direct outgrowth of the Academy of 1787. “The useful
arts and the sciences and literature" were taught then, and they
are taught now. They are taught somewhat differently and other
things have been added to them. It may be asked whether, with
equal success, we have perpetuated and added to the courage and
energy of the founders, and enlarged upon their reverence, their
vision and their faith. A towering Cathedral proclaims that these
things have not been forgotten.- But greater victory, for the Uni-
versity and for you, lies ahead. Heads up and faces forward! We
begin the next hundred and ﬁfty years!

Stanton C. Crawford

STANTON CHAPMAN CRAWFORD
Dean of the College

Stanton Chapman Crawford has been teacher,
zoologist, pastor, and educator. He received his
A.B. degree from Bethany College in 1918 and
his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University
of Cincinnati and the University of Pittsburgh
respectively in 1921 and 1926. Dr. Crawford
began to teach zoology in 1920 and he served
at various schools including Pitt. From 1927 to
1933 he was Head of Pitt's Iohnstown Center and
during the same period acted successively as
assistant professor, associate professor, and pro-
fessor of zoology. He then became Director of
High School Relations which position he main-
tained until 1935 when he became Dean of the
College.

Engaged as he is with his duties as dean, Dr.
Crawford, nevertheless, maintains his interest in
biology. He continues to make biological in-
vestigations and to teach biology, for he still
retains a professorship in this field. Dr. Crawford
has written articles on both education and
zoology. He is a man who is enveloped by his
work and he does not, as others sometimes do,
turn to an unrelated ﬁeld for his hobbies.
Constancy such as this bespeaks a nature intent
upon mastery. For his recreation hours Dr.
Crawford prefers two utterly dissimilar things:
he likes ocean cruising and walking. DEAN STANTON C. CRAWFORD

CHARLES S. TIPPETTS
Dean of the School of Business Administration

Dean Charles S. Tippetts, after working his
way through Mercersburg Academy, enrolled at
Princeton where he received his ‘A.B. degree in
1916. His proﬁciency in scholarship and interest
in activities enabled him to earn a fellowship at
Harvard Law School. The entire course of his
life was changed when, after one year, he left
Harvard to join the army. His executive ability
was recognized by the military authorities and
he was appointed chief of a camp for German
prisoners. He served in that capacity until 1919
and then decided to return to Princeton.
Economics, rather than law, became his major
interest; he combined graduate work in this
ﬁeld with teaching and in 1924 he received his
Ph.D. degree. Dr. Tippetts served as professor
of economics at the Universities of Iowa, Wash-
ington, and Buffalo before he came to Pitt in
1935 to assume his duties as Dean of the School
of Business Administration.

To his students Dr. Tippetts is more than a
clean: he is an understanding fellow, ready and
willing to give advice and to aid in the solution
of their most difficult problems. He has written

‘and collaborated in writing several books,
among which are “State banks and the Federal
Reserve System," “Business Organization and
Control" (a textbook used in about 60 colleges)
and “Money and Banking." The dean's favorite
hobby is ﬁshing and another of his recreational
interests is listening to good music.

DEAN CHARLES S. TIPPETTS

SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

EFORE most of you were born the World War had already
begun. Hardly one of you can personally recall when it ended.
You have grown to manhood and womanhood through turbulent,
chaotic years. The depression has cast a shadow over your daily
lives almost since you can remember. That cloud is now lifting,
but others are descending. What has been your normal world has
been to those of us who are older a world of turmoil and uncer-
tainty. We may look back with fond memories upon things as they
were before all this happened. But that is gone. The future of
democracy is questioned and another world war seems near at
hand. You will, therefore, be faced with problems as great as any
generation has had to deal with. You will meet men who are selfish
and dishonest. You will be so discouraged sometimes that you will
wonder how you can go on. It will be hard but it will give you a
chance to show of what you are made. You will need faith, and
hope, and courage. To those of you who have them, to those of
you who are strong, failure and despair will never come.
Charles S. Tippetts

The new principal was also an

51 author, having written “The West-
ern Galculator” and “The Western
Spelling Book.”

CHARLES E. PRALL
Dean of the School of Education

Dr. Charles E. Prall was educated in the mid-
west. He received his B.A. degree at the Uni-
versity of Iowa in 1912, his M.A. at the University
of Chicago in 1926, and his Ph.D. at the Uni-
versity of Iowa in 1928. Before coming to Pitt
in September, 1934, as Dean of the School of
Education, Dr. Prall had a wide and varied
experience as an educator. From 1912 to 1927
he served as superintendent of four different
school systems in Iowa. In the latter year he
became professor of Educational Research at the
University of Arkansas. The next year he moved
up state to become Dean of Education at
Arkansas State University where he remained
until he accepted his present position.

Dean Prall has a thorough knowledge of the
problems of education and educational research
and has published several works in the ﬁeld.
He displays an active and understanding interest
in his students and associates. '

While living in the West, the dean cultivated
a love for outdoor life. His garden, in which a
variety of ﬂowers bloomed from early spring
until December, was one of the local show

AMUEL JOHNSON once said of a dog that walked on its front

feet without other support:

“The wonder is not that he does it so well, but that he
does it at all."

To the seniors who struggled through 1933 and those lean
succeeding years, we wish to express our admiration and our faith.
The wonder is not that you have done so well, but that you have
carried on at all. Surely you who go forth in this anniversary year

can face the future with a conﬁdence which not even the new
dealers can insure. Our hopes and our heartiest support go with
you.

Dr. Bruce said that while non-col-
legians may be great, Franklin for
instance, the University is the con-
server of all ﬁndings in human
thought.

T THE one-hundred-ﬁfty year mark in the history of our Uni-
versity, it is well for us to look back over the long and honorable
life of our joint Schools of Engineering and Mines. Nearly a century
ago, when engineering studies in our colleges were hardly more
than experiments, our University was certainly among the first six
in America to offer studies of an engineering nature. Before the
Civil War, and particularly since about 1880, our school has sent
a steadily increasing number of trained men into the industrial life
of our great Commonwealth. Our older graduates have and do
occupy positions of importance in wide ﬁelds of endeavor and are
responsible for engineering work of great magnitude. What they
have accomplished must be a continued inspiration to you who are
the present generation of students.

In these days when the cry is ever for change, it is fitting to
remember that sound educational methods do not spring up over
night. They are the result of slow growth, tradition, and trial and
error. The long existence and continued growth of our School and
the success of its past graduates are sufficient proof that our methods
have been sound. I take pride in telling you that we contemplate
no radical changes in our engineering school curricula and that we
hold fast to the belief that broad engineering studies, combined
with the cultural advantages of a great University, will continue
successfully to train young men for our modern industrial world.

SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND MINES

ELMER ALLEN HOLBROOK

Dean of the Schools of Engineering and Mines

 

Dean Elmer Allen Holbrook is a familiar and
well liked figure to the students of engineering
and mines who frequent Thaw Hall. Before com-
ing to the University, he was Dean of the Schools
of Mines and Metallurgy and for two years, Act-
ing Dean of the Graduate school at Penn State.
Mr. Holbrook taught at Nova Scotia Technical
College and was also professor of mining at the
University of Illinois from 1913 to 1917. In addi-
tion to teaching, Mr. Holbrook has been a super-
intendent of mines in Montana, British Columbia,
and Mexico; he has served with the United
States Bureau of Mines at Washington and
Pittsburgh; and he acted as technical advisor on
coal for the NRA.

During the World War Dean Holbrook was in
charge of confidential work in War Minerals in
the central states. In 1904 the B.S. degree was
conferred upon Mr. Holbrook and twelve years
later he received the E.M. degree at the Uni-
versity of Illinois. Of special interest to Dean
Holbrook is the business, safety, and economic
side of the field of mining. He has been inducted
into Sigma Xi, ODK, Sigma Tau, Sigma Gamma
Epsilon, Phi Kappa Phi, Phi Gamma Delta, and

‘ is a member of various other organizations.

HISTORY OF THE DENTAL SCHOOL

, ..~§_.-,__.~,
.
Y

   

IN THE DISPENSARY

The Dental School was chartered April 20, 1896 and affiliated with the Western
University of Pennsylvania as its Dental Department. The City of Pittsburgh contained
schools representing all other professions at that time, but those desiring to study den-
tistry were compelled to go to Philadelphia or Baltimore. The school enjoyed a success-
ful career from the beginning and in 1905 became an organic part of the University.

The school was originally located at 711 Penn Avenue, but on account of its phenom-
enal growth, moved to Tenth and Penn Avenues in 1901, to Pride Street and the Boulevard
of the Allies in 1904, and eight years later to its present location on the campus where it
now occupies three buildings, equipped with the most modern teaching appliances.
Each year has seen improvements in teaching methods and equipment and many addi-
tions to the faculty, and the school has established a reputation throughout the world as
one of the foremost in its field. Its graduates are practicing in every state and many
foreign countries, several in far-off China, Korea and various European countries. Its
alumni number more than three thousand, many of whom are recognized as leaders in
their several fields of practice, and have been honored by election to the highest offices
of the dental profession.

Two members of the original faculty, Drs. Iohn S. Ashbrook and Clement R. Jones,
are still actively connected with the school and several others have a record of more than
thirty-five years of service.

The school has an excellent teaching museum containing many rare specimens of
early dental appliances, and comparative dental anatomy, and its library is recognized . 1 '
as one of the most complete collections of dental literature in existence, including, beside
all modern books and periodicals of consequence in English and other languages, many
early and rare works and association items not available in any other collection.

When the school was established, two years of high school education was required
for entrance and the dental course was three years in length. The present requirement
for entrance is the completion of two years of college work in science and arts. The den-
tal course is four years in length. -

The School has a Section of the International Association for Dental Research, the
members of which have done outstanding research in the many problems of dental
pathology and practice. It also has a chapter of the American College of Dentists and of
Omicron Kappa Upsilon, the honor dental fraternity.

The school offers advanced courses for practitioners, and graduate work for those
desiring preparation for specialization in such fields as Orthodontia, Oral Surgery,
Dental Pathology, Pedodontia, Prosthesis, Anesthesia and Exodontia, etc.

But the mighty hopes of the new
W.U.P. ended again in embers, for
in 181,9 (mother ﬁre demolished the
building.

DEAN’S MESSAGE

OU are about to commence practice in a field of health service

that is of the utmost importance to humanity. It is one which
only the dentist is prepared to care for. Continuance of the methods
that have brought success in your undergraduate training will
insure still greater success in your professional life, and to this
your faculty looks forward with confidence.

In recommending you to the University for graduation, and to
your respective states for licensure, your teachers believe that you
are consecrating yourselves to a life of great usefulness, primarily
for the benefit of your fellow men.

Your teachers will follow your careers with interest, and will
ever be willing to cooperate with you in helping you to solve the
numerous problems which will arise in your professional activities.
They hope that you will continue to be students, and that you will
feel free always to avail yourselves of the facilities of your School
tokeep abreast of the developments of your profession.

H. EDMUND FRIESELL
Dean of the School of Dentistry

Dean H. Edmund Friesell is a native Pitts-
burgher. After his graduation from Allegheny
High School, he attended the Pennsylvania
College of Dental Surgery at the University of
Pennsylvania where he received his D.D.S.
degree in 1895. He entered practice following
his graduation, but the next year he enrolled at
Pitt as a special student and completed his work
for a B.S. degree in 1913. In 1903 he became a
member of the faculty of the School of Dentistry,
and in 1904 he was made Dean of the School.
Dean Friesell has received many honors; he is
past president of the American Dental Associa-
tion and the American College of Dentists; he
is the recipient of three honorary degrees: an
LL.D. from Marquette University in 1920; an
F.A.C.D. from the American College of Dentists
also in 1920, and an Sc.D. from the University
of Pittsburgh in 1930. From 1905 to 1917 he
journeyed to Cleveland, Ohio, once each week,
to conduct a class at Western Reserve Uni-
versity.

Dean Friesell is a man of varied interests. He
is intensely interested in American history and
collects “Americana" as a hobby. He has
written many authoritative articles in his chosen
field, among which are “Organization of the
American College of Dentists,” and “Studies of
the Cause and Nature of Dental Caries" (in
collaboration with I . I. Enright). It was the work
and enthusiasm of Dr. Friesell which brought
the School of Dentistry to its deserved and
recognized place as a leader among American
dental institutions. DEAN H. EDMUND FRIESELL

DENTAL STUDENT COUNCIL

Crowds have been entertained by their antics. Students envy their enthusiasm and
clannish fellowship. When their doleful chant ﬁlls the air you can't miss understanding the
feeling of unity that underlies it. Of course, it's our famous Dents. Their spirit emanates
from the central body of the students, the Dental Student Council. By establishing such
an organization in 1925 dental students were made to feel and appreciate the spirit,
loyalty, and problems that mix together to form our campus life. The Council does not
pretend to direct the policies of Dental School, but when problems arise which can not
best be settled through the individual classes, solutions are usually found when brought
before the student governing body. The composition of the body is unusual in that it
permits proportional representation, for in addition to the automatic membership given
to each of the four class officers, each class elects one representative for every fifty stu-
dents. Five faculty advisors appointed by the Dean of the School bring the total member-
ship of the council to twenty-six. The association of the members with their advisors has
proved to be one of the most important benefits derived from the council. Here class
officers and representatives come in contact with outstanding professional men; here
problems of a professional nature arise, and council is guided in its actions by faculty
men well acquainted with such problems; and from here the undergraduate member can
take back to his group the solutions to those problems because of this association between
student and faculty. Thus the undergraduate finds the beginning of his professional
career. He meets his upper classmates, and is brought to realize his obligations, and
these realizations are assimilated by him and he knows what is expected of him through
the remainder of his years as a “Dent."

True, Dental Student Council may not be so conspicuous on the campus because
much of the “Dent spirit" is spontaneous in nature, but throughout the Dental School
the council has the reputation of getting results when they are necessary or demanded.
Many of these results have been of a social nature because the council is aware of the
value of bringing the “Dent" in contact with social life as an essential element in the
development of a college man. In January the Dental Student Council played host at a
banquet in honor of its classmates on the victorious Panther Rose Bowl team. Win or lose
the Dents are always loyal to their team. Many football cheering section, pep assemblies,
and victory celebrations have been planned and instigated by “those Dents." A tradi-
tional affair, and one looked forward to with much anticipation, is the annual Dental
Dance. Donald Wagner headed the committee and Bill LeRoy’s Orchestra furnished the
music for the affair held on March 19 at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. The dance
was one which could well be included with a Dent's most pleasurable memories of his
undergraduate days.

In 1858 the Rev. Mr. John F. Mo-
87 Loren was succeeded by Dr. George

Woods, who was the ﬁr-at to be

given the title of chancellor.

DENTAL INTERFRATERNITY COU

The Dental Interfraternity Council is a branch of the National Dental lnterfraternity
Council which was founded at Chicago in 1922. The. work of the Council is concerned
with the control and regulation of the three, professional dental fraternities at Pitt: Alpha
Omega, Delta Sigma Delta, and Psi Omega.

The Council is composed of six members, two members from each fraternity. Every
other Thursday these men are entertained at one of the fraternities, at which time the
Council draws up rushing and pledging rules with the aim of fostering harmonious
relations between the fraternities and continuing fraternal associations between the
dental students.

On December fourth the Council held the annual Dental Interfraternity Dance at
the University Club with Val Garvin furnishing the music. The dental students turned
out en masse for this, their main social event.

Competition in the bowling and basketball leagues was close. Robert Berman of
Alpha Omega rolled the highest score in a single game, and his fraternity brother
George Sobel scored the highest three game total. The A.O.'s won the league champion-
ship with the Delta Sig's taking runner-up honors. The Delta Sig's took honors in basket-
ball with the A.O.'s following them in second place. The Psi Omega boys found them-
selves unable to win any of the league basketball games.

The new principal was a Bowdoln
graduate, scholarly and ejﬁcient,
and eminently qualified for the

88

chancellorship.

ALPHA OMEGA

Alpha Omega, the University's youngest professional dental fraternity, is an inter-
national organization. It was‘founded in 1906 at. the University of Maryland. Alpha
Omega, at the present time, has thirty-nine chapters in the United States and Canada.
The local chapter, Omicron, settled in “Fraternity Row,” Dithridge Street, December 13,
1920, as an outgrowth of the Odons Club. The fraternity was organized through the
efforts of a group of Jewish dentists headed by Dr. Albert I. Wise, the present Praetor.
The purpose of Alpha Omega is to foster fraternalism and social recreation, Judaism,
the spurring towards professionalism and intellectual achievement and the making of
college dental training a significant force in the lives of the graduates.

The local fraternity has seventeen members, eleven of them being seniors. Each
year, Alpha Omega sponsors three annual affairs—a Thanksgiving Formal, Founders’
Day on April 1, and a Senior Banquet before lune graduation.

The Alpha Omegas are the top-notch bowlers in the Dental School. They won first
place in the bowling league sponsored by the Dental Interfraternity Council. In the
basketball league, they won second place.

The local chapter was honored by being awarded by the national fraternity a certifi-
cate for having the highest scholastic house-average.

Sam Binstock, senior brother, was presented this year with the junior scholarship
award by the national fraternity for having the highest average of any junior in the fra-
ternity. Iames Goldblum mixes dentistry with journalism. He was editor of the “Dental
Rays," publication of the Dental School. Gilbert Robin represented the local Alpha
Omega at the national convention held in Boston this year. In the sports line is Abe
Konick, who was runner-up in the inter-collegiate boxing conference in the 135 lb. class.

5 A valuable collection of geological
specimens was bequeathed to the
University in 1858 by Thomas Hind. 89
WUP’s interests were becoming
catholic.

 

Through the aid of John Harper,
money was secured in 1859 to equip
a chemical laboratory to aid in a
more comprehensive study of that
subject.

Delta Sigma Delta first appeared in the circle of professional dental
fraternities in 1882. The national fraternity planted its first chapter,
Alpha, on the University of Michigan campus ﬁfty-five years ago.

On February 5, 1903, through the efforts of twelve charter members,
the Sigma chapter of Delta Sigma Delta made its debut at Pitt. The thirty-
four year old local chapter now resides on Darragh Street near the Uni-
versity campus.

The primary aim and purpose of Delta Sigma Delta, a dental fraternity
that holds a high place in the professional world, is to uphold the stand-
ards of dentistry by inculcating in the minds of the students and of
dental practitioners a spirit of paternal cooperation toward scientiﬁc,
ethical, and professional progress.

The Delta Sigs hit the high and low spots this year in the sports activi-
ties among the dental fraternities. The Dental Interfraternity Council
sponsored two sports leagues this year: bowling and basketball. In the
basketball league, the Delta Sigs came out winners. On the other hand,
it seems that they were better able to throw the basketball around than to
hurl a bowling ball down the alley. In the bowling leagues, they ﬁnished
in the cellar position. As usual the Annual Spring Formal was the high
spot on the Delta Sig’s calendar. Once a month, that certain house on
Darragh Street swings and sways, to the strains of one of the fraternity
orchestras. Delta Sig house-dances are high occasions on the campus.

less Lanuti, President of the local chapter, is also President of the
Dental lnterfraternity Council. Fred Archer and Charles Langsdale rep-
resent the Delta Sigs in Student Council.

Psi Omega,.national professional dental fraternity, claims the honor
of being the oldest dental fraternity in Pittsburgh. Forty-five years ago,
the first Psi Omega chapter was founded ‘at Baltimore College of Dental
Surgery. Five years after the origin of the fraternity, Nu, the local chap-
ter, was established on’; the University campus. Now located on Belle-
field Avenue, the Psi Omegas can well be called the grand-daddy of
Pittsburgh's dental fraternities. The Psi Omegas have a twofold aim: to
promote and further the social qualities and abilities of the members and
to provide for the general advancement of the dental profession.

In conjunction with the Pitt Sesqui-centennial, the local Psi Omega
chapter celebrated its fortieth anniversary March 1. At the present time,
there are forty-four members, twenty-nine of whom are seniors. The
Bellefield cavity-fillers have built up quite a reputation for throwing
lively and novel house-dances. All loyal Psi Omegas can fondly recall
the memorable parties celebrating and following the Notre Dame and
Penn State football victories. These Dent students have a weakness for
decorating their house with banners and signs after games. The annual
formal Spring Dance is the one event of the college year for which all
faithful Psi Omegas live. This year the fraternity was a member of the
bowling and basketball leagues sponsored by the Dental Interfraternity
Council for the three dental fraternities. The Psi Omega bowlers won
second place in the league. In basketball, however, they were less
fortunate, coming in third. Psi Omega is well represented in campus
activities. John Adams wears an O.D.K. key on his watch-chain. lohn
Bailey, secretary of the fraternity, also an O.D.K. member, held the envi-
able position of varsity football manager. E. Ernest Rose represents the
Dents at S.F.A. meetings. Bob McClure represented the Psi Omegas on
the football ﬁeld at the Rose Bowl game, New Year's Day.

DENTAL RAYS

A QUARTERLY PUBLICATION OF THE STUDENTS AND ALUMNI
of the
SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY

“Dental Rays" was founded in the school year of 1925-26, the first issue appearing in
Ianuary, 1926. Nine volumes were published,’ with the journal strictly a student publica-
tion; then, with the first issue of Volume 10, in November, 1934, “Dental Rays" was ac-
cepted as, and declared to be, the official publication of the Dental Alumni Association
of the School of Dentistry. Henceforth it was to be a student-alumni journal. The format
was made more distinctive, the type of articles improved, and various new departments
were added. Circulation was increased, and the journal began to assume a place in the
dental journalistic field. It is now in its twelfth volume.

A recent report of the American Association of Dental Editors contained this state-
ment, highly complimenting the journal: “This periodical is today the most outstanding
journal in its ﬁeld. It is exceptionally well edited, good looking, progressive and ideal-
istic in its editorial policy. Its editorials have been positive and militant in the cause of
professional idealism. This journal is a staunch and effective agent in promoting a better
and ﬁner journalism for dental students and alumni."
