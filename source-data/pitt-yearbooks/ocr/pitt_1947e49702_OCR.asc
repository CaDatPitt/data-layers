ALPIIA TAU DELTA

Alpha Tau Delta, national social nurse's fraternity,
was established at Pitt when in 1945 it received oﬁicial
notice of acceptance for membership in the Professional
Panhellenic Association of Pittsburgh. Mu Chapter,
organized in April of that year, has completed its second
successful year of activities. The girls were proud to
serve as co—hostesses with Theta chapter from Duquesne
at the national convention at Atlantic City. Other activi-
ties during the year included a pledge party, the candle-
light ceremony at the annual dinner when twenty-four
new members were initiated and a theatre party at the
Playhouse. The climax of the social year was the bene-
ﬁt dance held jointly with the Alumni Association of
the School of Nursing. The ofﬁcers of Alpha Tau Delta
for the year were: Marion Schmidt as President; Mary
Florence Snyder as Vice—president, Marion Biggs as
Secretary and Cecil Walker as Treasurer. Marion Schmidt

 

SCHO0L 0F PHARMACY

Under the direction of Dean Edward C. Reif,
the University of Pittsburgh School of Phar-
macy has, in the past year, continued in its usual
manner of maintaining an excellent record of
service. In 1946, the School of Pharmacy was
confronted. with the familiar problem of return-
ing servicemen. In order to facilitate the large
number of veteran applicants, it became neces-
sary to disregard usual policy and admit a fresh-
man class in February of 1946. Of the present
enrollment of 319, over 70 per cent are veterans.
Many physical improvements, including a new
chemistry laboratory have been incorporated into
the School of Pharmacy building during recent
months. \Vith the addition of several new mem-
bers of the faculty, the School is looking forward
to a bright future. The students especially are
looking forward to a most promising future in
that the present demand for pharmacists is ex
pected to continue for a. considerable length of
time.

LAMBDA KAPPA SIGMA

Lambda Kappa Sigma, honorary sorority from the
School of Pharmacy, planned and carried out this year
a program of monthly activities. In October they spon-
sored a hayride for the entire women student body to
which everyone invited her special date. An Alumni
banquet followed in November, and in December the
girls had a Christmas party at the school. Members of
Tau chapter at Duquesne were the guests at this party.
The month of January was enlivened by a joint dance
with the men's Pharmacy fraternity, Kappa Psi. The
girls met twice a month at the school for their business
meetings, and then got together once a month at the
Sorority's social affairs. They were represented at the
national convention of Lambda Kappa Sigma which
was held this year in Seattle, \Vashington. The sorority
ended the year with formal initiation for their pledges in
the spring. The officers of Lambda Kappa Sigma for
the year were: Dorothy DeFoggi as President, Peggy
Kimmel as Vice—president, Bertha Dignovich as Secre-
tary, and Charlotte Krouse as Treasurer.

RESEARCH RUREAU
FOR RETAIL TRAINING

The Research Bureau for Retail Training was
founded in l9l8 as a cooperative venture be-
tween Pittsburgh department stores and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. The activities of the Bu-
reau include the retailing school which trains a
selected group of students and the research divi-
sion which makes various studies at the request
of Pittsburgh stores. Students attend classes at
Pitt for three and a half days each Week and
spend the remainder of the week selling and ob—
serving in the Pittsburgh department stores.
During the course they are trained for various
executive positions in the ﬁeld of retail selling,
ranging from interior decorating to personnel.
At the end of the course each student is given an
opportunity to select a division of the store in
which to do specialized work. The Director of
the Research Bureau is Mr. Bishop Brown. He
has been associated with the Bureau since l929
and has been its Director since l936.

In the beginning there was The Point . . . And many

years ago when the pioneers came across the mountains looking
for a place to build their city. they found that point, that place
where three rivers meet. And around The Point they built
their mills, their shops, their homes. Now the city is big and
strong and great. but The Point remains. The city is broad
andisprawling, but its heart is in the same place—The Point

where the three rivers meet.

ORGANIZATIONS

Organizations work at making Pittsburgh an even greater

city. Art shows at Carnegie. clean~up campaigns, recreation
facilities, smoke control, concerts at the Mosque, youth centers.
welcoming committees, health programs, lectures on the radio.
educational betterment, racial equality, religious tolerance, pro-
ductions at the Playhouse. better government. transportation
improvements. housing projects, ﬂower shows at the Conserva-
tory, scientiﬁc research, ﬂood control. industrial promotion.
These are sponsored by the organizations of the city. They

hold the key to the City of Pittsburgh.

There are people at Pitt who do not go home at the end of
seventh hour. Those people may stay until six o'clock or until
midnight working on a Pitt Players production, helping put
out The Pitt News, The Panther, The Owl, practicing with the
Heinz Chapel Choir, the Pitt Band, working in the Y office,
doing a hundred different jobs for which no one ever bothers
to thank them. These people, who give their time to campus

organizations, lift the University out of the realm of educational

factories.

CAI’ AND G0\Vi\'

A four—year absence from campus life failed to dim the
enthusiasm of Cap and Gown, Pitt’s all-male musical
revue. The Stephen Foster stage rocked with the knobby-
kneed chorus routine from December 4 to December 14.
With the aid of the graduate Cap and Gown club, pro-
fessional musical and dance direction was obtained to
produce “Kilroy Was Here." The familiar boy meets
girl background featured romantic tunes, sparkling dance
sequences amid jokes, old and new. The plot oﬂ‘ered a
chance to burlesque USO talent, the army, Sinatra, and
the school in general. Highlights of the two—act pro~
duction centered on the native dance by the chorus, a
realistic vaudeville routine, and ﬁve original songs writ-
ten by undergraduates. Social and ﬁnancial success of
the show was attributed to the cooperation of both the
technical and business staffs. Early in January Cap and
Gown season ended with a banquet for old and new
members. The nucleus of the club was formed with the
tapping of eight members.

Just as the city has its heart at The Point, the University
has its heart in the Commons Room. Teas. parties, organ music,
Coronations—the Common Room is symbolic of all the tradi-
tions, all the ideals of the University. The Commons Room,
with its Gothic arches and majestic stone corridors, is the center
of Pitt's social life. It’s the place to go to talk, to think. or

just to sit and rest. It’s more than just the heart; it’s the soul

of the University as well.

STUDENT CIDNGBESS

 

Marshall Levy

When this year’s Student Congress moved the last
meeting to a close with a brisk tap of the gavel, the books
were closed on a remarkably successful year which
showed a great increase in afternoon tea dances, pre-game
football rallies, and formal evening dances. Football
games were colored by the blue and gold capes of the
demonstration block, and cheering was keyed up by the
pep rallies before the Penn State and Purdue games. Soft
lights and sweet music featured the Soph Hop, Freshman
Dance, and Junior Prom. Stag or date “let’s get acquaint-
ed” was the theme of Howdy Hop and the Turkey Trot,
while the Christmas vacation gaily began with an after-
noon social. As usual, Spring Festival topped the yearly
calendar amid carnival festivities. Student Congress

showed initiative and organization during the
crippling power strike that hit the city. A uni~
versity car pool and printed "I go to Pitt" pla~
cards aided many a commuter. Stepping outside
of school activities, Congress helped push Pitt’s
Community Fund drive far over the top with a
quota of 138 per cent. In a precedent—setting
ceremony, new members of Student Congress
were appointed to membership during Spring
Festival, to carry on the tradition of self govern-
ment at Pitt. The officers of Student Congress for
the year were: Marshall Levy as President,
Corinne Nelan as Vice-president, Cecile Bruder as
Secretary and Robert Battisti as Treasurer.

VETERANS’ ASSOCIATIIIN

A post-war newcomer to campus life, the Veterans’
Association, presented a highly organized, well-rounded
program for the eX—G.I. at Pitt. Major concerns cen-
tered on housing, part-time employment and social acti-
vities. In cooperation with the Dean of Men, diligent
searching discovered living accommodations for many
single and married students. Strictly non-partisan in
nature, V.A. avoided politics, strived to solve problems
as they appeared. Other activities included a free news-
paper and an intramural sports program. All was not
Work with our vets in this ﬁrst year of peace. Early in
November Lena the Hyena led an afternoon Pigskin
Dance amid tunes from an all—vet orchestra. “Strictly
formal," said invitations to Veterans’ Spring Dance,
highlight of the year. The officers of the Veterans’ Asso-
ciation for the year were: Jack Grimes as President,
Stuart Workmaster as Vice-president, Frank Toth as
Jack Grimes Treasurer, and Larry Gibson as Publicity Chairman.

The Women’s Self Government Association is an or-
ganization of all women on campus. Business and activi-
ties for the year were planned and carried out through
W. S. G. A, Commission and eleven standing commit-
tees. Freshmen women realized the importance of the
Customs committee which held the Green Armband
ceremony, Customs sing and Customs Brunch as aids in
getting acquainted with the University’s history and fel-
low students, The Traditions committee planned Lan-
tern Night ceremony as a formal induction of freshmen
into University life and the traditional Coronation cere-
mony for the senior women. The Freshman Mixer
Dances were sponsored by the Social committee of W. S.
G. A. Other committees which carried out the year—long
program of this organization were: Housing, High
School Relations, Employment, Transfer, Student Loan,
Scholastic Honors, Vade Mecum and Activities. Another
important group was the Guild Advisory Board which
prepared freshmen women for participation in campus
organizations. Several new guilds were formed to meet

the needs and new interests of women students.
Class spirit and effort reached a high peak at the
Inter-class Sing, sponsored by W. S. G. A. The
theme, “Once Upon a Time,” gave a wide range
of subjects with the Junior Class planning the
most original performance, according to the
judges. W. S. G. A. of 1947 had the task of
initiating the policy for the twelfth ﬂoor at Pitt,
and for something completely new and different,
W. S. G. A. moved into the ﬁeld of political
science. All women students reaching the age of

CLASS 0F

“Plenty of hot fudge and marshmallow sauce for
everyone" was the theme of the Senior Sundae party on
December 2. It was the first time in the semester that
the ’47 graduates could get together. After enjoying a
variety show they made plans for an active year and prac—
ticed for the inter—class sing. They talked about the next
event, which was the Scotch Party where plaid-clad
lassies had plenty of fun. The Senior dignity was mus-
tered up when the girl’s mothers came to school to meet
the girls and faculty their daughters had known through-
out school, The last big Senior activity before gradua-
tion was the banquet which climaxed four years at Pitt.
The oﬂicers of the class of ’47 for the year were: Betty
Schultz as President, Rosemary Rainey as Vice—president,
Jean Mueller as Secretary, and Shirley La Scola as Treas-
urer.

“Closer friendship and cooperation” was the slogan
of this year’s Junior Class when they planned their many
activities. The girls of the Class of 1948 mingled at
bowling parties, the Inter-class Sing, a birthday party,
and coke get—togethers. At the Inter-class Sing, the
Juniors walked off with top honors with an original
Jack and the Beanstalk variation of the general “Once
Upon a Time” theme. Their ingenuity was shown as
they compared the bean stalk to the Cathedral, and Jack
to President Bowman. At their ﬁnal get—together, the
Juniors planned for next year’s activities and Inter-class
Sing. For this Class of 1948 is looking forward to an
outstanding Senior year. The ofﬁcers of the Class of
1948 for the year were: Betty Shore as President, Anna-
bell Montgomery as Vice-president, Pat Eldridge as Sec-
retary, and Sally Shannon as Treasurer.

The social season for the Class of l949 began with a
“Vanity Fair" party complete with crepe paper, pins, and
original costumes. In January, at the annual banquet,
an outstanding Sophomore was selected, and events for
the year were highlighted by a sports spree, fashion
show, and Sophomore Round—up. Sophomores found
their second year at Pitt a busy one as they forgot their
green arm—band freshman standing and entered Univer-
sity activities as veterans. But besides these activities, the
Sophomores found themselves more oriented to all phases
of University life, and they ended the year with the tradi-
tional tribute to the Seniors, their sister class. The oﬂi—
cers of the class of 1949 for the year were: Irene Maloney
as President, Eugenia Captain as Vice-president, Abby
Clarke as Secretary, and Ruth King as Treasurer.

AND DIINES CABINET

The “men on the hill," represented by the Engineer-
ing and Mines Cabinet, did more than use slide rules and
discuss math this year. Backed by the largest engineering
class in history, the cabinet endeavored to ease crowded
conditions and present an attractive social program.
Problems such as student seniority registration and locker
shortages were discussed and passed on to proper author-
ity for adoption. The traditional E ‘£5 M Christmas
dance, the Holly Folly, gave engineers and their dates a
chance to rhumba to Brad Hunt and his orchestra. Long
to be remembered was the engineer smoker, labeled the
“Pitt Follies of 1947." A lot of gab, a lot of smoke,
and professional entertainment assured this evening of
success, Events such as these created good fellowship
among the engineers, to be remembered after campus days
are forgotten. The oﬂicers for the Engineering and Mines
Cabinet this year Were: William Bilka as president,
Thomas Fraser as Vice-president, John Reuther as Sec-
retary, and Francis Peacock as Treasurer.

IIEINZ CHAPEL

Every Sunday afternoon about four o'clock, the Heinz
Chapel Choir members put on their wine—colored robes
and stand in orderly groups in the hallway of the chapel
waiting for the service to begin. And when, at 4:30, the
choir marches down the aisle, everyone knows that this
singing group is a ﬁnished product. “Pop" Finney, the
amiable and able director of the choir, has been instru-
mental in bringing about this ﬁnish. The choir has to
work hard to attain their perfect harmony and certain
melody. Every day from 4:30 to 5:30, the twenty-
third ﬂoor rings with hymns and anthems. And just
before school starts, carefree basses, altos, tenors, and
sopranos take a camping trip. This year the group spent
a week in the wilds of Pennsylvania. They ate, danced,
and went hiking, but mostly, they sang and had fun
doing it. The choir had their formal Christmas dinner
at the University Club, and the spring tour was termed a
huge success.

The men were back this year, and Men’s Council
helped to welcome them with service and advice. The
semester was only a Week old when the book exchange
eased the shortage of texts. The task of instilling in-
coming freshmen with the spirit of Pitt, its customs and
traditions, became another council duty. Foreign stu-
dents and transfers from other schools found hospitality
and friendship, a chance to adjust to strange surround-
ings. Representing all undergraduate men, Men’s Council
is charged with the welfare and activities, attempts to
alleviate problems. Dr. Carlson and Cap and Gown
performers highlighted the annual smoker night, when
freshmen gathered informally to meet each other. The
oﬂicers of Men’s Council for the year were: Robert Covey
as President, Sid Berkey as Vice-president, Thomas
Leiper as Secretary and Vince Stufft as Treasurer.

Ml§N’S GLEE

Holding forth as the oldest activity on campus, Men’s
Glee Club returned to full time operation this year with
over 60 Well-matched voices under the direction of David
Weiss. Early in the year the club made their debut at
the Chancellor’s reception, followed up with selections
at the Christmas entertainment preceding vacation.
Songs, old and new, from "Begin the Beguine" to “Hail
to Pitt,” marked Glee Club programs. To widen the
scope of the group, a men’s quartet, an octet and the Pitt
Singers were formed, the latter including members of the
Women's Choral society. The social program included
the ﬁnal banquet, and a dance with the PCW choral
group. The Glee Club presented their full length concert
at Stephen Foster Memorial in March. A successful
spring tour of the east wound up a busy season for those
men who sing for a hobby. The oﬂicers of Men’s Glee
Club for the year were: Robert Mild as President, Robert
Calhoun as Business Manager, and David Weiss as
Director.

and religious understanding. Led by Reverend Vance
Yarnelle, assistant pastor of the church, the club discussed
current problems, Bible study, and religious education.
Publicity and meeting notices were handled by the
Young Men’s and Women's Christian Association. Guest
speakers highlighted supper sessions on occasion. Miss

Amateur thespians returned to the footlights after a

President Ivan Birsic and staﬂ‘ succeeded in planning a
program for the entire student body. The call of the
stage brought over 200 applicants to Stephen Foster Me-
morial in November for tryouts. From these, casts were
chosen to present three one—act plays, including one act
of Thornton Wilder's “Our Town." Precedent was set
when three student directors were chosen to produce each
play. At semester's end, the plays were presented. In
March, Players enacted the Broadway hit, “Room Ser-
vice.” Joining in Spring Festival merriment, Pitt Players
fashioned a musical show for the occasion. The officers
of Pitt Players for the year were: Ivan Birsic as President,
Ann Monteverde as Vice—president, Cora Robinson as
Secretary, and Richard Wallace as Business Manager. [mm lggrm

The year 1946-47 brought to Pitt a better football
team, a bigger band, and a bigger and better Women's
Athletic Association. The W. A, A. bad a successful
year with its archery, basketball, bowling, badminton,
swimming, softball, tennis, and volleyball. Archery
helped to decorate the campus. The pretty girls shot
their arrows under the direction of Martha Hornbeck.
The chairman of basketball, Ruth Anne Burke, also was
the head of volleyball, organized similarly into classes.
Tennis enthusiasts climbed all the way up to Trees Gym
with Mary Sarcone, while softball enthusiasts went to
the lot in Schenley Park. Badminton and swimming
tournaments also were held this year. The W. A. A.’s
big activity in 1946-47 was the Freshman Party at
Thanksgiving time, with folk dancing, singing and re-
freshments for all. The oﬂicers of \Vomen's Athletic
Association for the year were: Clara Joan Papuga as
President, Harriet Louise Morris as Vice-president, June

(Jhurlolte Ginsbuzy

The aim of the Women's Speech Association~to
equip each girl to be able to share experiences through
speech work—~was carried out this year by a two—fold
program. This program consisted of group poetry read-
ing centered around speciﬁc themes and informal speech
forums or roundt-ables. These roundtable discussions
were made both informative and interesting by using
current topics of community and civic affairs. W. S. A.
kept up its usual record of serving both the University
and local community whenever possible. The year ended
with the Spring banquet and an evening of entertain-
ment the members will not soon forget. All upperclass
women with an interest in the speech arts and a desire to
learn effective speaking were welcomed into the member-
ship of W. S. A. The officers of Women’s Speech Asso-
ciation for the year were: Charlotte Ginsburg as Presi-
dent, Pat McCleary as Vice-president, Doris Bish as

Wondered about current affairs. he could meet with the

With the end of \7v'orld War II and the return
of the veterans to the campus, a new War De-
partment program for the Reserved Oﬂicer's
Training Corps has been established at Pitt. This
new program includes those subjects found most
necessary in the training of young ofﬁcers. Based
on the experience gained from World War II.
this new program proves more interesting to the
enrolled veteran, since he, in a great many cases.
has had personal experience and can add his prac~
tical knowledge to the textbook theory.
R.O.T.C. program here at Pitt includes 212 stu-
dents enrolled in elementary training and 112
advanced students, 98 of whom are veterans with
at least one year of service. The elementary course

Panhellenic Association serves to integrate sororities
with University life as a whole. Every sorority woman
on campus is included in its membership, and each soror-
ity is represented in Panhellenic Council, the adminis-
trative body, by two members. Through intelligent
discussion and cooperation, the council helps to serve
both the sororities and the University by making and
enforcing a few simple rules for the common good of all.
Panhellenic activities include the annual Panhellenic re-
ception for freshmen women, Panhel sing—won by
Delta Delta Delta for the second consecutive year, an in-
terest in University activities as evidenced concretely by
the Commons Room Christmas decorations, and the
publication of “Who’s Who in Sororities at Pitt." This
year Panhellenic Association fell in with Pitt postwar
plans by holding a party for veterans’ Wives who are
not on campus. Panhellenic Association welcomed to
membership Delta Chi Rho, making ﬁfteen sororities

ALPHA DELTA PI

The gleam in the eyes of the A.D. Pi’s on Pitt campus
is telling the world that they are proud of their achieve-
ments this past year. The formal opening of their new
home was the signal for full speed ahead, and so began
a very successful school year. The calendar of activities
included a Veteran's Dance, tea dances with fraternities,
picnics, and parties which made the social schedule a
full one. But these social events didn’t keep the Alpha
Delts from entering into campus activities and, at the
same time, maintaining their scholastic standing. Past
achievements have kept the girls busy, but future ones
are in the oﬁ’ing——so keep your eyes on the diamond of
Alpha Delta Pi. The oﬂicers of Alpha Delta Pi for the
year Were: Ruth Ann Dinsmore as President, Joan Hall
as Vice—president, Joan Koontz as Secretary, and Mary
Ruth Ann Dinsmore Lou Megaﬂin as Treasurer.

Jane Barbrow

After the first eventful open house, the A.E. Phi’s
looked forward to an exciting year, and Nu chapter, as
usual, discovered that there wasn’t to be a dull moment.
To start the social "wheel” spinning, the girls donned
their traditional green and white ribbon bows on Found-
er’s Day, October 24, when luncheon was held with the
alumna chapter at the Concordia Club. In October, the
chapter played hostess to Alpha Nu chapter at Tech, and
entertained with HalloWe'en and Thanksgiving aﬂ‘airs,
climaxing the season with an annual spring formal. But
A. E. Phi was not only a Whirl of social fun and rush-
ing. The girls held a Christmas party at the Children’s
Hospital and donated their time to a number of.charit—
able organizations. The oﬂicers of Alpha Epsilon Phi
for the year were: Jane Barbrow as President, Annette
Silver Buchman as Vice~president:, Harriet Reich as Sec~
retary, and Charmaine Blatt as Treasurer.

BETA SIGMA

The Beta Sigs are the champion campus tea drinkers.
It was during these’ teas for mothers and the sorority
advisor that the girls planned their December rummage
sale and chalked off the days until the Christmas formal.
The Beta Sigs took time off in their search for a house to
week-end at Penn State with their new sisters. And
then back to work again—successfully completing their
drive for the money which supports their national pro-
ject, Pine Mountain Settlement in Kentucky. An out-
ing at Totem Pole Lodge initiated spring for the Beta
Sigs, and this was followed by a dinner party given for
the girls by the mother's club. Final exams and theater
parties climaxed the school year. The officers of Beta
Sigma Omicron for the year were. Mary Vasilakas as
President, Hallie Jean Smith as Vice—president, Lois

Up to their ears in activities and always ready for a
good time—these were the Chi O's of l947. In all the
leading campus activities, they were represented, and in
publications, they carried oﬂ‘ top honors. With all their
activities, they emphasized scholarship and awarded a
prize to the most outstanding student of the year in
sociology. The Chi O's had a full year of social events
climaxed by a spring formal in May. A new idea of
inviting faculty members and prominent professional
men of Pittsburgh to speak at an informal meeting each
month was brought back from their annual convention
at Spring Lake, New Jersey. The Chi O's played a de~
ﬁnite role in maintaining social sororities’ high standing
on campus. The ofﬁcers of Chi Omega for the year
Were: Jane Mellon as President, Sally Bair as Vice—presi~
dent, Mary Margaret Moran as Secretary, and Dorothy

This has been a busy year for the Tri Delts at their
house on Bigelow Boulevard. They had their ﬁngers in
most extra—curricular activities, they attended to a little
matter known as studying, and they kept up a social
schedule equal to that of any group on campus. Their
calendar included an open house to welcome the new Tri
Delt chapter from Penn State, a Santa Claus party for
the Ward Home for Children, a mother and daughter
party, and an elaborate spring formal. Throughout the
year they maintained steady contributions to the Tri
Delt scholarship fund and the United China relief. So-
cially and academically, 1946-47 was a successful year
for the Tri Delts. The ofﬁcers of Delta Delta Delta for
the year were: Gloria Ressler as President, Betty Rogers
as Vice—president, Grace Bowan as Secretary, and Eleanor
Lynch as Treasurer.

many campus oﬂices and boasting members in almost all
organizations. To get into the swing of things, the
sorority held a Founder's Day banquet on October 23

rushing parties, and dessert dances were highlighted by

The Thetas returned from their national convention
at Pasadena, California, last summer full of enthusiasm
for the coming year. The biggest event of the year was
a formal dance given at the sorority house during the
Christmas week. Running a close second was the spring
formal held at the University Club. In addition to these
affairs the Thetas entertained several of the fraternities
at tea dances and followed each rush period with a dance
for their pledges. The social year was topped oﬂ‘ in the
spring with a tea in honor of the housemother for her
twenty years of service to the chapter. In addition to
their social life this year, the Thetas launched a scholar-
ship improvement campaign. The Oﬂ‘lC€1‘S of Kappa

may be muffled a bit in colfee and cake, but thirty hearts
are in it, and that’s What makes the Monday night scene
at the Kappa House so wonderful. The Kappa girls can

social calendar was ﬁlled with open houses, rushing
parties and teas, November hayrides,/Christmas parties,
2. Mother's Day tea, and 3 ﬁnal ﬂing at the spring formal.
In May, the traditional faculty reception was given by

November 23. This Was just the beginning of an active
year for the Z. T. A.'s. Besides their monthly house
dances, formals and the senior banquet in l‘/lay, the girls
from Chi chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha found time to make

nounced at intermission. A successful rushing season.
lengthened to accommodate returning veterans, was cli-
maxed in December with a banquet and get-together to
introduce pledge and frater. Capping a year of fellow-
ship, tuxes came out of hiding in March for the annual
IF formal. Shortly before Memorial Day the nearly
one thousand fraternity members sat down at their first
banquet to award sports trophies and to look back on an
George Lunn actiVity~packed year.

The Bayard Street Shelter cheered to the merriment of
Saturday night socials. A diary of Delt occasions includ-
ed the Thanksgiving formal at the Churchill Valley
Country Club, the pledge—sponsored Bowery Brawl, the
Yuletide dinner dance, and Easter formal. Twice during
the year, at the Founders’ Day banquet and the Delt
service at Trinity Cathedral, the actives and alums from
Pitt, Tech, and WYSJ were brought together by their
common interest in Delta Tau. Notwithstanding the
chapters private program, the Delts were never too busy
to engage in University activities and interfraternity com-
petition. Scholarship was not forgotten as Delta Tau
Delta, along with socials and activities, included scholas--
tic improvement in this year’s program. The oflicers of
Delta Tau Delta for the year were: Dave Hughes as
President, William Dodds as Vice—president, Jack Moran
as Secretary, and Sidney Pullan as Treasurer.

PHI IIELTA TIIETA

Phi Delta Theta, like most organizations on campus.
has swung back to normal since the ending of the War.
The number of active members this year was just short
of the record year of l94l. With their swelled enroll-
ment, the Phi Delts were able to—and did—accomplish
much. The big affair of the year was the Province dance
on December 15. The Pitt chapter of Phi Delta Theta
played host to the other Phi Delt chapters in the district
when they held their formal at the Chartiers Country
Club. House parties were weekly events until May 29
when the boys at 225 Dithridge sponsored their annual
spring formal. This was just the ﬁrst of many good years
to come for the Pennsylvania Iota chapter. The oﬂicers
of Phi Delta Theta for the year Were: George Lynn as
President, John M. Douthitt as Vice-president, William
Pritchard as Secretary, and James Plunkett as Treasurer.

Zeta chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi can look back on one
of its most successful years. Veteran members returning
to Pitt were anxious to pitch in and start the activities
moving at a fast pace. The social calendar was packed
full of events, including the Thanksgiving formal, rush-
ing dances, and countless Stags. With this strong social
program, it is not hard to see why every Phi Ep fell into
the spirit of unity when the chapter served as host to the
national convention in December. The convention came
to a successful close with a New Year's Eve formal ball
at the William Penn. Phi Epsilon Pi participated in all
inter~fraternity sports events and took an important part
in all phases of Pitt activities throughout the year. The
ofﬁcers of Phi Epsilon Pi for the year were: Paul Stein-
lauf as President, Leon Block as Vice—president, Leroy
Sach as Secretary, and Sanford Lampl as Treasurer. Paul S/einlau/7

PIII GA‘MM£‘ DELTA

How could Phi Gamma Delta miss when they had
over 100 actives this year? l\/lore than once were the
Fijis celebrating some of their boys’ return from the serv-
ice. Like the other fraternities on campus, the Phi Gams
campaigned for a new house. The conversation at 4725
Wallingford Street this year also centered around the Phi
Gam Centennial Ekklesia in 1948, which will be held
here in Pittsburgh. But with plans for a new house and
a centennial in formation, the Fijis had a full social cal-
endar and many activities on campus. They won ﬁrst
place in the IF sports competition in track, bowling, and
the sweepstakes, and took ﬁrst place again in the IF sing
with their original arrangement of “When Day Is Done"
and their “Smoke Dreams" fraternity song. The officers
of Phi Gamma Delta for the year were: James Helman,
as President, Bob Griewahn as Secretary, and John Mc-
James Helman Morris as Treasurer.

Plll KAPPA

The Phi Kaps opened the school year with a house
warming at their new chapter house at 152 North Dith-
ridge Street. The house was completed with the aid of
plenty of industrious workers (pledges) and their house-
mother, Mrs. McElwee, who in March celebrated her
twenty—ﬁfth year with Mu chapter. New Year's Day the
Phi Kaps started preparations for their January formal
in conjunction with the Theta Phi Alpha sorority. The
annual Founder's Day banquet was held March 29 at
the William Penn Hotel. Yet the Phi Kaps still found
time to accent athletics this year and maintained their
popularity with the campus sororities. The fellows
rounded out their social life with numerous dances and
informal get—togethers. The officers of Phi Kappa for the
year were: John Goodworth, as President: Killeen Ray-
mond as Vice—president, Ralph Magnotti as Secretary.
and Gerard Obert as Treasurer. John Goodman},

Pl KAPPA ALPIIA

“A new house by spring," became the motto for Pi
Kappa Alpha this year when the Kappa Sigma chapter
from Tech came back to claim their house. But even
Without a house, the PiKA’s were busy in many activities
on campus, including the Pitt: News, Heinz Chapel
Choir, Men’s Glee Club, the Vet’s Association, and many
others. Their social calendar included Christmas and
spring formals, picnics, hayrides, and many dances. To
complicate the PiKA’s moving problems were the tro-
phies they have Won. The IF Sports Trophy emphasized
the fact that they were ﬁrst in football, basketball, swim-
ming, and second in the sweepstakes, ping pong, track.
and bowling. They also defeated Tech’s intramural
football champions. The officers of Pi Kappa Alpha for
the year were: Edward Stuart as President, Frank
Dougherty as Vice—president, John Button as Secretary,
and Leonard Matonak as Treasurer.

The Pi Lams started the year oﬂ‘ with their formal at

rnals, open houses, stags, and Saturday night house
dances. Two-twenty-ﬁve Dithridge Street was comple-
tely renovated by the hard-working Pi Lams. The
pledges deserve a lot of credit for their untiring efforts
in polishing, painting, and general all—around work.
National convention was both a serious and gay affair
at the Essex House in New York, climaxed by the big
New Year’s Eve celebration. The Pi Lams are proud
that once again they came through with one of the
highest scholastic averages of any fraternity. With socials,
scholarship, activities, and redecorating, it's easy to see
the Pi Lams had a full and busy year. The oﬂicers of
Pi Lambda Phi for the year were: Sid Berkey as Presi-

SIGNIA ALPHA EPSILIIN

 

George Smith

Sigma Alpha Epsilon entered the fall semester of ’46
with a chapter greatly enlarged by returning Veterans and
a successful rush season. The SAE’s highlighted the fall
semester with a grand homecoming for their Pitt alumni
and followed with a dance at the house the evening of
the Penn State game for their brothers from State Col-
lege. The boys all had a hand in helping to clean and
remodel their house on Belleﬁeld Street and they had a
grand time doing it. They cooperated fully in inter-
rraternity athletics. Beside these reunions and remodel-
ing, SAE found time for some social life and formals.
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon was successful not only in its
social activities, but in maintaining its scholastic stand~
ing. The oﬂicers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon for the year
Were: George Smith as President, Peter Homich as Vice-
president, Paul Corcaran as Secretary, and Gerald Aland
as Treasurer.

SIGMA CHI

Each spring at a formal dance the Sigma Chi’s choose
a Pitt co-ed to be their fraternity sweetheart for the com-

ing year, and each year every girl at Pitt secretly hopes
that she may hold the honor. This is a tradition of

Sigma Chi’s throughout the nation that is as old as the
fraternity itself. But the Sigs proved that their talent
is not limited to choosing a sweetheart. They came out
on top in scholarship, too, and were seen in most activi-
ties on campus. The boys really celebrated after the
Penn State game with a big dance in honor of their bro-
thers from State. The Sigma Chi's made their search
for a house their number one project for the year, but
found time to uphold their position among the frater-
nities at Pitt. The oﬂicers of Sigma Chi for the year
were: Herman Knell as President, Robert Reeder as Vice-
president, Warren Whitmyre as Secretary, and James
Armour as Treasurer.

TIIETA CHI

With the return of a half dozen actives to campus life,
Alpha Beta chapter of Theta Chi became active again
late in the spring of 1946. Its ﬁrst signiﬁcant success
was placing ﬁrst among all social fraternities in scholar-
ship competition for the spring semester. Summer rush-
ing and the return of a few more veterans brought Theta
Chi's strength to nineteen men for the beginning of the
1947 school year. The Theta Chi's devoted their atten-
tion throughout the year to ﬁnding a house. Hours of
Work spent on this problem were offset by several suc-
cessful parties and some surprising intramural victories.
This was a great year for Alpha Beta, for in that time it
passed from infancy into a strong chapter of which all
Theta Chi is proud. The officers of Theta Chi for the
year were: Jaclr. O'Brien as President, Bob Swearingen
as Vice—president, Jack Kaercher as Secretary, and Ed
Heckman as Treasurer.

The Alpha Phi Alpha's quit house hunting and began
housekeeping this year when they returned from their
national convention at Columbus, Ohio. The boys cele-
brated Christmas at the house by holding a cabaret dance
to which even Santa Claus came. The following semes-
ter, on Easter morning, the Alpha Phi Alpha's searched
for the brightly colored Easter eggs hidden over Prima
Terra, a farm belonging to one of the members. For the
Alpha Phi Alpha Pitt-Duquesne Scholarship Fund, the
chapter sponsored Josh White, the singing troubadour.
and his Haitian dancer. They also brought to Pittsburgh
Paul Robson and Marian Anderson. These social and
cultural activities combined to bring the year to a suc-
cessful close for the Alpha Phi Alpha’s. The officers of
Alpha Phi Alpha for the year Were: James Jordan as
President, Ernest Conley as Vice-president, Robert

Alpha Phi Delta, one of Pitt's new social fraternities,
returned to campus in the fall after an absence of four
years. With Samuel F, lanni as President, the new
group of twelve active members layed out plans for an
important year. The group pledged ﬁfteen men during
the fall semester. The varied social calendar included a
reunion social hour with alumni at Webster Hall in Sep-
tember——fo1lowed in November by a stag smoker at the
Italian Club. December 27, the boys and their dates got
together at the Balconades for a holiday dance. On Feb-
ruary 22, formal initiation was held at the Italian Club
and during April a banquet honoring the fraternity's
alumni was held at Webster Hall. Faculty advisor to the
fraternity is Dr. DeVitis, and alumni advisor is Mr.
Frank DeCenzo. The officers of Alpha Phi Delta for
the year were: Sam Ianni as President, Dominic R. Guar-

new transfers didn’t waste any time and soon had eight
pledges. While making plans for their new home the
Delta Sigma Phi's meet in their chapter room at 212
Dithridge. The second semester of their ﬁrst active year
on campus was highlighted by a February formal and
Founder’s Day banquet. Delta Sigma Phi was also active
in inter—fraternity basketball competition, University
activities, and maintaining a high scholastic standing.

The Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, which had been idle
throughout the War, returned to the campus to again take
its place among social fraternities. During the ﬁrst semes-
ter in the old homestead, the Sammies held many suc-
cessful alfairs. The pledge class sponsored a hayride in
honor of the active men in the chapter, and the actives
staged picnics, stags, and dances. As a grand ﬁnale there
was a cabaret style dance appropriately called “Club
Sammy.” One of the high points in the social program
was a stag affair held in South Park Lodge with Dr.
John B. “Jock” Sutherland as guest speaker. Back in
the stride again, the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity had a
successful year and hope that the future will be as pleas-
ant as the past. The ofﬁcers of Sigma Alpha Mu for
the year Were: William Kahn as President, Nat Pirchesky
\Villz'um Kahn as Secretary, and Elmer Match as Treasurer.

Paralleling Pitt’s sports program is a similar pattern that
includes all of the people of the city. In Pittsburgh there are
many sports arenas, where sports lovers may see baseball, basket-
ball, football, hockey, track, tennis. It is true that sport has
become a big business but underlying it all is a spirit of sports-
manship among the fans and the players that is something more
than big business. It is this spirit that makes Pittsburgh one of

I

the country’s ‘red hot sports towns.”

People say that Pitt has gone off the athletic, “gold stand-
arii." But we know better than that; Those of [us ‘who saw‘
the courage of Pitt’s great football" team, those of ixs who oner-

ﬂowed the student section_ at almost every game, those of us

 

who saw Doc Carlson’s “little men” lose games, but never lose
heart, those of us who saw those things and all the rest—well,
we know better. We know the color of Pitt's Panther is not K 7 ~—

yellow,’ but gold. «

WES[.EY FESLER

FO0TBALL

Milligan, Fife, Hartwig, Fesler, Clark‘, Fisher

Wes Fesler's l946 edition of the Pitt football
Panther left its imprint on many a gridiron. The
past season proved that Pitt is on the upgrade
and will cause plenty of trouble for its future
foes. Of all the bright spots in the past season's
play, none glittered as much as the sparkling
Pitt defense. Even the mighty powers of Illi-
nois, Notre Dame, and Ohio State found the
Jungle Cat defense anything but easy pickings.
But it was not only on defense that the Blue and
Gold showed signs of returning to its former
greatness, for the young Panther uncorked some
striking power of its own, and countered strong~
ly against its highly rated foes. In no game

was Pitt’s offensive prowess more in evidence
than in the Penn State tussle. Prior to this bat-
tle, the Nittany Lions had held seven opponents
to an average rushing net of 81.8 yards, tops in
the nation for rushing. But after the Panthers
had roared through them for 227 yards, the
Staters were nowhere to be found among the
ﬁrst ten. The squad’s high—spirited determina-
tion was an outstanding asset, for it was said of
the I946 Panthers that they were most at ease
within their own ten—yard line. Perhaps,
through the steady guidance of Fesler's successor.
Mike Milligan and his staff, the saying next year
will be, Pitt is most at home within the enemy’s
ten—yard line.

got exactly nowhere in the ﬁrst half. Late in the
second period Lou Cecconi passed to Bill Mc-
Peak on the Illinois one—yard line, then went
across on a quarterback sneak, Early in the sec-
ond half, Art Dufelmeier of Illinois went 37
yards through right guard to break the tie.
Shortly afterward Paul Patterson caught a pass
in the end zone for the third score. Fighting
desperately to live up to pre—game ratings, the
Illini scored twice more in the fourth quarter
on the tiring Pitt team. Showing amazing
speed, Young went around left end from the one-
yard line. As an anti-climax, Chick Maggioli
carried a Pitt punt 75 yards for the ﬁnal touch-
down.

Reversing the score by which they were defeat~
ed the previous week, the Jungle Cats rolled over
the Mountaineers, 33-7.

After a scoreless ﬁrst quarter, West Virginia
went into the lead on a 28~yard pass to Chuck
Helenski. The Panthers struck back immediately
as Cecconi took the kickoﬂ‘ and went 98 yards
for the score. Two minutes later Carl De-
Pasqua threw a 48-yard scoring pass to Bill
Abraham. Now the touchdowns were coming in
showers. Bill Bruno intercepted a pass on the

Pitt 47, and on the following play he broke
through center for the third Pitt score. The
Mountaineers were still staggering from this
when an interception by Clougherty set up an—
other Pitt touchdown. Cecconi ran it over from
the six. Pitt’s last score came at the end of a sus-
tained drive when Abraham plunged six yards
to cross the goal.

Despite a strong first period defense, the Pitt
eleven bowed to powerful Notre Dame, 33-0.
Johnny Lujack opened the second quarter by
throwing a 26—yard touchdown pass to Living-
ston. Terry Brennan accounted for the second
tally when he plunged ﬁve yards through tackle.
By the end of the ﬁrst half, the Panthers were
badly crippled. Lee Ward had been forced to

dany also had hobbled oﬂ‘, and Buck Johnson
was a third casualty. In the opening moments
of the third quarter the Irish recovered a Pitt
fumble on the 30, In two plays Jim Mello made
the score l9-0. Six minutes later Mello again
scored, running 29 yards through the center of
the Panther line. The ﬁnal touchdown was the
climax of a 47-yard drive. After four plays had
gained 22 yards, Brennan sprinted through
tackle for 25 yards and a touchdown.

In a game played in a heavy downpour the
Panthers outgained the Temple Owls 218 yards
to 157, but were unable to score. The Owls
punched inside the Pitt 30 early in the game but
got nowhere, and rarely got to midﬁeld from
then on. Pitt made three penetrations into Tem-
ple territory, twice getting as far as the 34-yard
line. One of these visits came when Johnny La-
Frankie intercepted an Owl pass and was dragged
down from behind with no one between him and
the goal line. One remarkable aspect of the game
was the skill with which both teams handled the
slippery ball. Pitt fumbled only once, Temple
twice, each team recovering its own bobbles.
Neither club had any success with its passes, most
of them slithering off the passers’ hands. Only
5,000 loyal but drenched spectators, the smallest
crowd of the season, saw the stalemate.

Holding Marquette’s nationally known aerial-
ists to only ﬁve completions in twenty attempts,
the Panthers squeezed past the Golden Ava-
lanche, 7-6. Early in the second quarter Cecconi
fumbled Carl Schuette’s put, and Marquette re-
covered on its own 31. After three plays had net-
ted 23 yards, Schuette passed to Captain Bob
O'Hagan for the ﬁrst score of the game. The at-
tempted conversion was low and to the left.
Bobby Lee, playing his ﬁrst game since being
hurt in the season’s opener, led the Panthers on
their successful third quarter march. Lee passed
from the Pitt l0 to McPeak on the 45. After two
line bucks failed to produce, DePasqua took to
the air and threw a beautiful 50-yard pass to
Skladany for the score. Cecconi place—kicked the
all-important extra point.

Pitt

Pitt looked impressive against the powerful
Hoosiers, but the difference in the 20-6 score
represented the accurate right arm of Ben Rai-
mondi. The Panthers took an early lead as Lee
passed 25 yards to McPeak for the score. But
seven plays later Raimondi and the Hoosiers
struck back. Fullback Pete Pihos plunged over
for the score, but it was Raimondi's passes that
carried the attack. At the start of the second
quarter, center Bob Cannady intercepted a De-
Pasqua pass and returned it to the Pitt 40. After
two line plays were stopped, Jack Groomes swept
right end for a touchdown. Bill Cowan took a
hand—off and went 64 yards for the ﬁnal Indiana
score. Three fumbles inside the Indiana ﬁve-
yard line ruined Pitt's last-period drives.

Hopes of an upset victory over the highly
favored Purdue eleven were shattered as Henry
Stram, reserve back, booted a perfect 19-yard
ﬁeld goal with only three seconds remaining in
the ﬁnal period. After an exchange of punts in
the early part of the first quarter Purdue’s offen-

sive power began to show and the end of the ,

period found them on the Pitt 10. The second
quarter was only three plays old when Purdue’s
Stormy Pfohl plunged over for the initial score
of the day. Stram's placekick was good. The
Boilermakers’ line continued to stall the Panther
offensive until a beautifully placed punt by De-
Pasqua sailed out of bounds on the Purdue two-
yard line. On the next play Skladany tackled
Bob DeMoss in the end zone for a safety. After
Purdue put the ball in play with a punt from its
own 20-yard line, Pitt began rolling, but a
Cecconi pass was intercepted by Gargol on the
Boilermaker 20, ending the scoring threat. In
the third quarter Pitt continued pressing offen-
sively, but each time their attack faltered as they
approached the enemy goal. Late in the fourth
quarter Lee passed to Skladany who advanced to
the Boilermaker 28. Successive ground gains by
DePasqua, Bruno and Abraham gave the Panth-
ers a ﬁrst down on the Purdue ﬁve-yard stripe.
On his second attempt Bruno went through
tackle for the touchdown. Cecconi’s kick was
wide, but Pitt led, 8-7. Following the kickoff
the Pitt line held ﬁrmly, and Purdue was forced
to kick. On the second play after the punt, Mc-
Kay rccovered Lindy Lauro's fumble on the Pitt
43. A DeMoss pass placed the ball on the 12.
and after three plays made two yards and only
three seconds remained, Stram came in to kick a
field goal from the l9.

THE GAME

The troublesome Panthers entered the game a
20-point underdog, but threw a scare into the
powerful Buckeyes before bowing, 20-13. At
the beginning of the second quarter, Alex Ver-
dova fumbled DePasqua's punt, and Bernie Bar-
kouskie recovered on the Buckeye 19. Cecconi
then threw a pass to McPeak in the end zone for
a touchdown. Ohio State roared right back as
George Spencer threw an 11-yard pass to Cecil
Souders for their ﬁrst touchdown. Midway in
the third quarter the Buckeyes, failing to advance
on the ground, took to the air and a 54-yard
pass, Spencer to Bob Brugge, put them ahead.
The ﬁnal period was only a few minutes old,
when the Panthers began a 68-yard march to
the Buckeye goal, where Cecconi, on a quarter-
back sneak, made the score, Pitt 13, Ohio State
14. The Buckeyes tallied their ﬁnal points 'on
another Spencer to Brugge pass, this one covering
eight yards.

The raging Panther thoroughly tamed the
favored Nittany Lion as the Pitt squad captured
its twenty-seventh Penn State victory, by a score
of 14-7. Cecconi hauled in a 38-yard aerial
from DePasqua which carried to the State three
yard line, and Abraham sliced through guard for
six points. Bill Coury added the extra point. In
the fourth quarter a long drive was climaxed by
a bullet-like pass from Cecconi to Skladany, who
stepped in front of three State men to make the
catch in the end zone. Coury again booted the
extra point and the Panthers led, 14-O. Finally
hitting their stride, mainly through the efforts of
Elwood Petchel, the Lions scored on a line buck
by Bob Weitzell after a 56-yard march. Petchel
converted, but the Lions were ﬁnished. Pitt was
rolling into enemy territory again when time ran
out.

BASKETBALL

Twelve more inches in stature, or twelve more
ﬁeld goals would have put the Pitt basketball team
in the Eastern N.C.A.A. playoffs and given them a
chance to win a national championship. In seven
of the games lost the squad was never outscored by
more than one ﬁeld goal. Some years the luck seems
to be bad and this must have been that type of sea-
son for the Panthers. Here was one of the greatest
little teams ever. They had to have plenty of cour-
age to win as often as they did. Every team that beat
them was able to dump in enough points to get the
margin of victory, but no team was able to display
superior ball handling or better mental drive. Only
Nate Apple, and possibly Walt Zernich, seems to be
lost to next year’s team, and there will surely be a
nucleus next year around which to build the "Win
'Em All Champions.”

Capt. Nate Apple

Showing the same spirit which brought na-
tional recognition to the gridiron Panthers, Dr.
Carlson’s ﬁgure eight wizards ﬁnished the season
with a record of eight wins and ten losses. Nate
Apple, outstanding in his al1—around ﬂoor abil-
ity, led the under-sized Panthers in heart-break-
ing early season losses to Ohio State, Illinois,
Butler, and Northwestern. Three of the defeats

Two points For our side

were by a total of eight points. The Pitt squad
ﬁnally hit its stride by defeating the favored
Penn State ﬁve on the stadium ffoor and then
romping over the Tech quintet, 60-22. This
pair of wins set a spark into Carlson’s ﬂoormen
and despite the loss of several key men, they
gained the respect of every coming opponent. In
outstanding performances the Ice Cream Kids
upset Ohio State, 51-41. and then held one of
the nation's top teams, West Virginia, to a 52-
41 victory. With spirits soaring the Panthers
traveled to Farrell where they took revenge on
the previouslv victorious W'estminster Titans,
4439, The ﬁnal game at West Virginia was
typical of the entire season. The battling mid-
gets fought desperately but their opponents’
height was the decisive factor as the Mountain-
eers outscored the Panthers, 72—59. Sammy
David led the team in scoring with 177 points.
Close on his heels were Dodo Canterna with 151
points, Nate Apple with 136, Willie Cieply with
100, and Wally Zernich with 94. Together the
starting ﬁve were responsible for 658 of 835
points scored this season.

TRACK

Coach Olsen’s track men were not very active in winter indoor
competition due to the lack of an adequately equipped ﬁeld house.
They did, however, enter the two major meets of the indoor season,
the West Point Relays and the lC4—A indoor competition. In the
relays Herb Douglas set a new \Vest Point record in the broad jump,
leaping 24%; feet. He placed third in the 60-yard dash. Ed Sud-
zina, mainstay of the cross country squad, ran a close second in the
two mile run. Travelling to the IC4—A indoor meets, the Pitt
representation again held their own among the best track men in
the country. Douglas took the broad jump, this time reaching the
23 and 9/10 mark and Sudzina was a little less fortunate, placing
fourth in the two-mile run. With the winter schedule fulﬁlled
the cindermen looked forward to the outdoor meets. Coach Olsen
primed his enlarged squad for the two most important events of
the entire track season, the Penn Relays and the IC4—A open air
contest. Curl Olsen

S\VIlVIlVlING

Pitt resumed swimming this year after being absent from
the aquatic sport for ﬁve seasons. It was quite a task for
Coach Howard Waite to ready the members of the team for
the ﬁrst meet. The team proved itself, however, defeating
Edinboro, 41-29, just six weeks after the ﬁrst workout. A
little overconﬁdent after their initial win, the team traveled
to Slippery Rock where the more experienced teachers defeat-
ed Waite’s proteges, 42-33. The next three meets were com-
paratively easy, the Pitt squad trouncing Edinboro, 56-19;
Penn State, 46-29, and Geneva, 57—9. Backed by this en~
viable record, the mermen were conﬁdent of a win in their
rematch with the Rockets, but again the young Pitt team
went down to defeat, 42~33. Outstanding this season for
the Panthers was the 400—yard relay team of Capt. Cannon,
Jackson, Brugger, and Wilde. Manko and Levine were un—
defeated in the backstroke and 440—yard free style, respec-
tively. With fourteen teams competing, the Panthers piled
up eighteen points and captured third place in the Eastern
Collegiate Swim Meet held at Rutgers University. Manko
came in second in the 150-yard backstroke and Levine placed
Howard C» Waite third in the 440-yard free style. Pitt’s crack 400~yard relay
team barely missed taking ﬁrst place honors, placing second
to the Rutgers team.

BASEBALL

After ﬁve years of insuﬂﬁcient playing material, lack of
proper equipment and abbreviated schedules, Coach Ralph
Mitterling could ﬁnally look ahead to brighter prospects. The
pre—season drills brought forth siXty—ﬁve battery candidates
and almost twice that number of ﬁelders. Although the
essentials were plentiful, one little detail was lacking, a play-
ing ﬁeld. The Stadium was not available because of the
Civic Light Opera, which opens in May, and as a result
schedule plans were thrown into a mess. Hoping for the best,
Mr. Mitterling Went on with the spring drills, his spirits
bolstered a little by the ﬁne form displayed by the many re-
turning lettermen. Back from last year were ace pitcher
Sammy David and catcher George Schweinebraten, while re-
turning from ’45 nine were the batterymates. Virg Fassio
and Bob Lucchino. Combining a post—war schedule with a
post—war team, Coach Mitterling hoped for pre-war results.

INTBAMUBALS

Intramural sports once again became an im-
portant part of Pitt's athletic program. Under
the direction of George Weekes, a Variety of
sports were opened to the non—varsity men. The
fall schedule featured touch football with games
played at the old Shady Side Academy. In the
winter schedule basketball and bowling were pre-
dominant. The spring program, however, was to
be the most interesting of the three, with track
meets, golf matches and softball contests plan—
ned. Pi Kappa Alpha walked oﬂ‘ with the touch
football honors, wining all but two of their
games. Led by Johnny Gallagher and Ralph
Wilde the PiKA’s captured the post season play-
offs, then went on to defeat Tcch’s Tau Delts in

hoop race and Phi Gamma Delta barely edging
out Sigma Alpha Epsilon for the bowling hon-
ors. The Phi Ep's, led by Bruce Gilbert, slipped
through the ﬁrst half undefeated and went on to
win ten straight contests before being stopped by
the once-defeated Pi Kaps. Then the third place
Delts upset the apple cart and crowned the
PiKA’s champs by defeating the Phi Ep’s. The

summer evening concerts in Schenley Park, the Planetarium and
the art shows. Some people call these things culture. but to
most of us———activities are just things in which we take part for

the fun.

SPRING

Heralding the arrival of spring on the campus
was the traditional Spring Festival. Comic car-
toons carried out the theme of the festival, high-
light of the spring social calendar. Crowds cheer-
(‘Cl decorative ﬂoats, followed friends and broth-
ers to open houses at the sororities, swarmed to
the stadium for the races, danced hour upon hour
at the tea dance and the grand ball, and settled
back to school work after a hectic four days of
festivity. The festival started rolling on the
morning of May 7. At noon ,there was lunch-
eon on Lilly Court. Groups of entertainers from
the Pittsburgh district displayed their talents in
comedy, music, and out—and—out hilarity. Later
in the afternoon, students streamed to the Syria
Mosque for the tea dance where Tommy Carlyn

It was a grand dance that the Sophomores
sponsored for the University students in Jan~
uaryl The Schenley Hotel was decorated for the
occasion with silhouetted ﬁgures dressed in gay
nineties costumes and scenes from the old—fash—
ioned songs such as “A Bicycle Built for Two"
and “The Man on the Flying Trapeze.” At
intermission Bill Zcffiro and Jack Douthitt were
featured in the entertainment with their cap and

called “The Girls in My Hometown.” They
wore the typical striped jackets, bright bow ties.
and straw hats of the era. A barbership quartet,
which was almost hidden behind huge handle-

ful renditions of the old favorites of long ago.

Baby Doll Prance. Everyone was invited, but
the attendance had to be limited to 200 couples.
The dance was advertised weeks beforehand with
novel matchfolders, illustrated with two small
baby dolls on the front cover. In the Baby Doll
motif, the Schenley ballroom was decorated with
large, cuddly dolls and a few baby buggies. The
programs were printed on a folded paper diaper
which opened up to display the names of com-
mittee members and chaperones. Brad Hunt was

of winter social affairs rolling with their
December dance at the William Penn Hotel.
The dance was an informal affair that high-
lighted the season for fraternity" men and
their dates. Winter decorations carried out
the theme of the dance and introduced the
pre-Christmas season at Pitt. The enter-
tainment at the dance was supplied by Brad
Hunts orchestra, which featured Jeanne
Birdseye as vocalist. The bandstand carried
out the frigid theme, too; it was cleverly
decorated as an old-fashioned sleigh. It was
just the atmosphere to get everyone oﬂ‘ to a
gay start for the evening.

Brad Hunt gives out with a slow one

In December the engineering students
invited the school to their annual formal,
which was held in the Gold Room of the
Roosevelt Hotel. A Christmas motif was
the theme for the dance. It Was carried out
with bright holly and Yule decorations.
Although it was not a closed dance, tickets
were limited, so the requests of engineering
students were ﬁlled before tickets Went on
sale for the other students. The orchestra
for the evening was that of Brad Hunt,
who entertained the couples with novelty
tunes and request numbers. The dance was
the ﬁrst formal for the engineers since the
War.

What a Conga Line

The Vets were hosts to the University at
the afternoon dance at the Syria Mosque in
November. Guys, gals, freshies, grads—every~
one was invited to this football season get-
together which featured Joey Dym’s orchestra.
Lena the Hyena was the lady of the day when
she entertained with a novelty dance done to a
special musical arrangement which was fol-
lowed up with rhumbes, sambas, and an end-
less, wriggling conga line. Refreshments,
which are always a welcome part of any dance
to Pitt students, were served throughout the
afternoon, Another feature which pleased the
coeds at the dance was a good old pre-war stag
line.

Very pretty decorations

Pitt coeds had their big dance this semester
with the February affair at the William Penn
Hotel. The treat was on them, and the boys
just leaned back and enjoyed the rush. It was
a Sadie Hawkin's Day at the University. With
the large number of men at Pitt, the girls had
a big choice and they really took advantage of
it. Al Bowman's orchestra, an all-veteran
hand, took over the Urban Room that night
and provided the music and novelty entertain~
ment for the evening. Decorations featured
large, frilly hearts which many of the girls
literally wore on their sleeves for the evening.

Everybody was there

They had a gay time

A warm, spring night, soft lights, tuxes,
and long, colorful formals—-another year
and another Panhellenic Ball, It may have

s been the first inter—sorority dance for a young
freshman who danced with stars in her eyes
among the swirl of skirts around the ﬂoor,
or it may have been the last dance of its kind
for a girl who was graduating the next
month. The last of four Wonderful dances
with the friends she had known throughout
her college days. But whatever the case, it
was a dance to be remembered. Favors were
given, and those girls lucky enough to talk
their dates out of them had another small
memory to add to their bracelet collection.

That was a goody

GREETINGS

To the Students:

We want a sunlike outward life at Pitt. \>v'hen a student who is real meets
another student who is real in the hall or classroom or Commons Room, a fresh
determination gets into hearts. Inward ﬁres start; education becomes a radiant,
happy affair; and you in the depth of your soul are becoming the you that you

want to be, All of that is a main idea at Pitt.

We are proud of the material side of Pitt—honest, excellent buildings
with meanings built into them. We are prouder, though, of a quality of
sincerity all over the campus that makes the ever—present now a delight and

an inspiration.

GREETINGS

To the Students:

We, here at Pitt, learned something last fall which we should never forget
—~that a football team of youngsters who learned their fundamentals and gave
their best would receive the united and loyal support of the University and this
community. The 1946 team did not win many games, but large crowds went
to see those boys play and the sports editors wrote columns of encouragement.
Every boy on the team had an unconquerable spirit. ‘We were so thrilled by
their play that we came away with a feeling of pride. They made us want
to do our best. Do you remember the Purdue game? We had them beaten
8-7, time out, three seconds to play, then .1 ﬁeld goal by Purdue with time run-
ning out as the ball went through the uprights. A deathlike h11sh went over
the crowd but there was not a critic. Nlay you of the Class of 1947 “give

your best."

student, he has served as a member of the faculty
and as head of the Engineering Department. As
supervising engineer, he played an important role
in the construction of the Cathedral and the

Serving in the important capacity of Registrar
is versatile and eﬁcient Dr. J. Gilbert Quick.
With the return of the veterans and the subse-
quent high enrollment record, Dr. Quick has
been faced with one of the most diﬂicult tasks in
the University. Because of the number of stu-
dents, it became necessary to hold the September
registration in the spacious Syria Mosque. Spring
semester registration was held under a special
plan which resulted in a minimum of confusion
and a high degree of elﬁciency. The problems
of registration combined with insuﬂicient space
and a shortage of teachers have indeed make it a
busy year for Registrar Quick.

DEAN (IF WOMEN

The Dean of Women, Miss Helen Pool Rush,
and her assistants and secretaries offer to women
students and to the University all types of per-
sonnel services. Mrs. Harriet Kohberger guides
extra curricular activities from her new oﬂice on
the twelfth ﬂoor. Vocational advice consisting
of individual and group conferences and place-
ment in part—time work are planned by Mrs.
Betty Hamilton. She also provides housing for
out—of—town women students. All those asso-
ciated with the Dean of Women's Oﬂice as well
as women of the faculty plan and carry out the
Orientation Program for freshman women. For
the last ﬁve years, this office has aided the Uni-
versity in the administration of the Commons
Room, under the direction of Mrs. Eunice Ross,
the Nationality Rooms by Miss Nordin, Heinz
Chapel by Miss Robinson, and the Information
Room by Mrs. Raymond. Mrs. Millard, on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor, and l\/liss Becker, on the twelfth, along
with their regular duties as secretaries, keep the
personnel records of individuals and groups.
More recently, the completion and maintenance
of the Women's Floor at Pitt has been the lead-
ing project of the department. The Twelfth
Floor was ofﬁcially opened with a successful open
house in January. The eﬂicient staff of the Dean
of Women’s Office develops the student as a
person while the faculty is developing the student
along intellectual lines. Helen Pool Rush

Theodore W. Biddle

Pitt men first discover the Oﬂice of the Dean
of Men several months before they start their
freshman year. From then, until they graduate
they have occasion again and again to enter that
office for information and guidance. All men

DEAN (IF MEN

applying for admission to the University, whe-
ther they are veterans or non—veterans, must ﬁll
out an information sheet and appear for an inter-
view with a member of the Oﬂice staff before
their applications even are considered. Here is the
first step in the now highly-selective process of
determining who of the thousands of men at-
tempting to enter Pitt shall be accepted. Presiding
over the Oﬂice genially is Theodore W. Biddle.
The Dean, official guardian angel of the greatest
number of men ever to attend Pitt, still has man-
aged to meet informally with a surprisingly high
percentage of them. Students who have waited
long hours to see him have found that his per-
sonal interest in them and his willingness to help
them repay them the time they have lost waiting.
This is the Offices chief purpose——to interest it-
self in all the problems of all Pitt men. As fresh-
men, they were introduced to the University, its
history and its ways. The Office of Dean of Men
did everything possible to adjust freshmen to
University life. When the men became sopho-
mores and juniors, their social and educational
growth was fostered and broadened through
extra—curricular activities, which they may only
have sampled as freshmen. As seniors and pros-
pective graduates, they get from the Oﬂice aid in
obtaining employment.

Miss Schafer

Throughout their stay at Pitt, the Oﬂice
attempts to obtain for out-of-town students
whatever housing may be available, as close to
the school as possible. One of the Oﬂice's greatest
and newest tasks is that of aiding the veteran
student in his special problems. It means answer-
ing every one of the hundreds of questions raised
by veterans studying under the G—I Bill of
Rights. It means keeping the thousands of rec-
ords and serving as liaison between the student
and the Veterans’ Administration. It even means
that the Office of Dean of Men is called upon to
advise women——ex—nurses, ex-Wacs, eX—Waves,
ex—Spars, ex-Marines—-now in school and receiv-
ing veterans beneﬁts. Assisting Dean Biddle is a
staff of seven men. Robert L. Arthur is in charge
of musical activities and directs the Pitt Band
and Orchestra. Charles H. Ebert, Jr., conducts
the Placement Bureau. J, Edward Ricart serves
as special veterans counsellor and supervises the
complicated network of veterans affairs within
the school. William Mclilwain advises the staffs
of the Owl. Panther, and News; Edwin J. Mc-
Intosh supervises Fraternities and Men's Coun-
cil: William F. Saalbach advises Cap and Gown,
Student Congress and its committee system, and
runs the Housing Bureau. Working from the
Information Room, rather than the main oﬂice,
William Daufenbach, the senior member of the
Office staff. oversees the Cathedral marshals. The
eﬂicient and pleasant secretarial staff includes the
Misses l\/lary Stevenson, Perra Hecht, Mary Jane
Messner, Meryl Harris, Betty Maloney, Rose
Ann Schaefer, Betty Rank, Virginia Matty, Vir-
ginia Tierney and Madelyn Reinheimer.

This year, as in the past twenty-ﬁve years, the Owl has -

chosen for its Hall of Fame twenty seniors outstanding during
their four years of college life in leadership, character, honesty.
and participation in activities. Each has given service to the
University far in excess of the average demand for time and

co—operation.

These students were chosen by a committee of faculty
members and junior men and women. At Tap Day on May 9,
the names of these ten men and ten women were revealed at

the services in Soldiers and Sailor's Memorial Hall.

BUSINESS ADMINISTBATION

The use of the Pittsburgh district as a great
laboratory in which the students can obtain 21
wealth of valuable practical knowledge is one
of the major stresses of the policy of the School
of Business Administration. The policy empha-
sizes a close association between the University
and business in the community. In addition to
the basic curriculum, the student is taught about
the problems which business faces and the
changes it undergoes. When the “Bus Ad" is
about to graduate he has a background of prac-
tical business knowledge plus a mastery of the
fundamentals of business administration. Dur-
ing the past year the School of Business Ad-
ministration has been faced with its own "post-
war problems," all stemming from the increased
enrollment which has more than tripled in the
past two semesters. Headed by congenial and
popular Dean Vincent VJ. Lanfear, the school
has evoked many changes, the most important
of which has been the major expansion of the
faculty.

THE CIJLLEGE

The College, the largest single school of the
University of Pittsburgh, had the greatest enroll-
ment in its history during the past year. With
its liberal arts education, it seeks to help young
people realize their full capacities, ﬁrst by making
them aware of the qualities they possess, then
by consciously fostering and developing these to
the fullest possible extent. The College, com-
posed of seventeen departments, also strives to
help the student to think independently and to
convey his ideas effectively. From this he derives
satisfaction and gains conﬁdence which helps
him in later life. As Dean of the College, Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford found enrollment, sched-
ules, and College functions as the school’s great-
est problems this year, but all were solved. The
College and Dean Crawford endeavor to serve
the students so that the students may learn to
serve the University.

SClIO0L 0F EIDITCATIIIN

The past year has found the School of Edu-
cation making large strides of progress, Friendly
and likeable Dean Samuel P. Franklin reports
several minor changes in teaching policy. In-
creased school visitation and the extension of
practice teaching are being emphasized by the
department. Plans have also been formulated for
a weekly laboratory period, during which under-
graduates will be given a chance to come into
direct contact with the community. Although
the School of Education has not been too serious-
ly affected by the inﬂux of veterans, the number
of “in-service” teachers enrolled has increased
appreciably. Extended facilities have been offered
to this group, including a plan whereby the Uni-
versity, working in conjunction with the various
industries of the area, offers actual Work exper-
ience to vocational counsellors with college credit.
Under this plan, high school counsellors are
given an opportunity to gain practical experience
in the various industries and upon returning to
their schools are better able to advise high school
students.

ENGINEERING AND MINES

The Schools of Engineering and Mines this
year had a capacity enrollment of nearly 1,700
undergraduate day students, over 90 per cent of
whom were veterans. They were excellent and
serious students who demanded the best efforts
of their instructors. Under these conditions the
greatest problem for the next few years must be
the care of this large number. The school was
constantly adding new teachers to its staff. Under
the steady leadership of Dean E. A. Holbrook,
the school acquired and installed Varied and ex-
pensive laboratory equipment and is trying to
secure additional laboratory space. V/'hile the
desire to promote graduate Work and to carry on
additional research was strong, first place Was
given to the needs of caring adequately for the
returned veteran undergraduate student.

SCHO0L (IF DENTISTRY

The past year of 1946, in addition to marking
the ﬁftieth anniversary of dental education in
Pittsburgh, has been a memorable year of prog-
ress for the School of Dentistry. Within the past
year many progressive changes have taken place
both in the curriculum and in the physical plant
of the Dentistry Department. Various revisions
in dental education technique have been effected
in the curriculum and as a result more space and
equipment per student has become necessary. The
laboratories have been remodeled and almost all
the equipment of the entire school has been re-
placed by the latest and best equipment available.
In 1946, the School of Dentistry experienced a
great loss in the death of Dean H. Edmund
Friesell. A recognized leader in national dental
circles. Dean Friesell was personally responsible
for many advances in dental education. It was
during his reign of leadership as Dean that the
University of Pittsburgh School of Dentistry
rose to its prominent position as one of the ﬁnest
dental schools in the nation.

PSI IIMEGA

Psi Omega. professional dental fraternity, concentrated
on athletics, scholarship, and social affairs this year. By
maintaining a steady line, the Psi O’s won the dental
interfraternity two-handed touch football championship
and had two of their players, Edward Burns and Danny
Lewis, recognized on the All~Intramural University foot-
ball team. Besides keeping up a winning football team
and powerful basketball squad, the Psi O's found time to
completely redecorate their house. When the redecorat—
ing was ﬁnished, the members celebrated with a house
dance, and later in the semester they entertained at their
homes with buffer dinners and informal dances. The
outstanding affair of the year was a formal dance at
which the Psi O’s and their dates danced to the music
of Clyde Knight and his orchestra. After Pitt’s home
football games, they held “Victory” dances at North
Park. In February the graduating members were honored
at a formal dance. The officers of Psi Omega for the year
were: Edward Burns as Grand Master, P. Hoskins as Sec-
Edward Burns retary, and J. Bell as House Manager.

Alpha Omega, professional dental fraternity, com-
pleted another successful year at the University of Pitts-
burgh living up to their purpose of instilling fraternal-ism
and professionalism in the dental profession. The fra-
ternity furthered interest in their work by sponsoring a
series of professional clinics at which prominent men in
the ﬁeld spoke on various phases of dentistry. In addi-
tion to their scholastic activities, the Alpha Omegas
found time during» the semester to have a Senior Formal
in honor of their graduating members, a fraternity picnic,
informal house dances, and smokers, at which the broth-
ers could just relax and discuss their mutual interests. In
the spring, after new members had been tapped, the
Alpha Omegas held a pledge initiation dance for the
entire fraternity. >Alpha Omega made a deﬁnite contri-
bution to a successful year for the University of Pitts-
burgh. The officers of Alpha Omega for the year were
Jerry Markowitz, as President, Abe Weinberg as Vice
President, Marvin Press as Secretary, and Abe Rothman
RS Treasurer. Jerry Marlzotuilz

 

SCHIHIL 0F NURSING

The School of Nursing, the youngest school
of the University, was established in 1939 as a
result of an urgent need of trained nurses in the
community. In 1940, Magee and Childrens’
Hospitals closed their schools and became divi-
sions of the University's School of Nursing.
They were later joined by Eye and Ear Hospital,
which became the third major division. Early in
.1944, a campaign was organized to raise two
and a half million dollars for the construction
of a combined Home and School of Nursing in
the Medical Center. To date, one and a half
million dollars has been raised for the project.
The enrollment in the School of Nursing has
grown from 58 in 1938, to the present semester
total of 1,294. Today, it is one of the four
accredited schools which offer to all students the
seven basic clinical services and public health ex-
perience. Under the capable direction of Dean
Ruth Kuehn, the University of Pittsburgh
School of Nursing has, in the short space of nine
years, become one of the ﬁnest of its kind in the
nation.

STUD IENT-FACULTY NURSING ASSOCIATIIDN

Student—Faculty Nursing Association is an organiza~
tion of all students enrolled in the School of Nursing.
The purposes of the Association are: to establish valu—
able associations and interesting student activities that
promote a well—balanced and happy life, to uphold the
standards and ideals of the nursing profession and to fos-
ter the best faculty—student as well as student to student
