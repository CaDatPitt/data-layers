Commencement

In his last ofﬁcial act as Chancellor,
Dr. David Kurtzman presented 3000
candidates for degrees on May 31.
Graduates and guests sat on wooden
seats between the Cathedral and
Heinz Chapel. Although there was
no Commencement speaker, the
graduates heard a message from Pres-
ident Johnson challenging them to
continue to show “fresh and vigorous
concern for the quality of American
life.” Dr. Kurtzman then presented
his thoughts on both his and the stu-
dents’ education at the University.

He cautioned the graduates that
they were embarking on a new phase
of life that they would either pass or
fail. They could either participate in
the life of the community, he said, or
refuse to apply the knowledge of
people and living they gained in
college. If they chose the latter, they
would be “the worst kind of dropout
—a dropout of life.” He also ad-
monished the students not to apply
stereotypes to those around them as
generations before them had.

Standing at the back of the lawn
near the Heinz Chapel steps stood a
lone man in a black suit. Observing
the school he would begin to head
the next morning, Dr. Wesley Pos-
var was just another Commencement
guest.

Regional
Campuses

In the past few years, the
University has expanded its
regional campus at johns-
town. Today, Bradford,
Greensburg, johnstown, and
Titusville form a quartet of
regional campuses which
have become a flourishing
part of the University com-
munity. Construction of new
facilities, growing student
bodies, and more student in-
volvement in activities are
indications of the increasing-
ly important role the region-
al campuses play in the
University’s future. The
campuses have been well in-
tegrated into their respective
communities. They offer
academic programs which
are similar to those offered
during the first two years at
the Oakland campus. Stu-
dents are encouraged to
transfer to Oakland after
they have completed two
years at the regional campus.

Located thirty miles from the Oakland
campus, the University of Pittsburgh at
Greensburg offers the student a small college
atmosphere with a rural setting unknown at
the main campus. The campus was established
primarily to serve residents of Fayette, West-
moreland, and surrounding counties. Students
from other states and countries, however, give
the school a cosmopolitan flavor.

After four trimesters at the Greensburg
campus, the student may transfer to the Oak-
land campus. The courses offered are the same
as the freshman and sophomore courses at the
main campus. Extra-curricular and social
activities at Greensburg, also reflective of stu-
dent life at Oakland, include dances, football
weekends, a debate club, and athletics.

In September, 1966, Pitt’s johnstown outlet moved into
its new eight million dollar campus. The ten-building com-
plex, phase one of a campus construction project, provides
academic facilities for over 1,000 full-time students and
dormitories for 300 resident students. Student recreation and
social events are centered in the Student Union and Physical
Education buildings. School ties are very strong at johns-
town. Fraternities, sororities and other organizations provide
a wide range of activities. With the new facilities and a
steadily increasing student body it will be possible to initiate
more stimulating and rewarding programs at Johnstown.

There are approximately 300 students enrolled at the
University’s Titusville campus. Titusville’s present goal
is the expansion improvement, and reﬁnement of its
curriculum and physical plant. Emphasis is currently
placed on engineering and general liberal arts courses.
Students are encouraged to relocate at the Oakland
campus after they have completed their studies at Titus-
ville. The campus has been successfully integrated into
the community, which is encouraging to those who advo-
cate a regional campus program. The most active student
organization at the campus is the Social Committee. A
new dormitory provides for 150 resident students.
Thus, students are given the chance to establish them-
selves in the surroundings of a small college before moving
into the atmosphere of the big campus.

Great '
Professors

Professors have often been accused of
indifference to the conscience of the
undergraduate students. The necessity
to maintain professional status and to
publish and complete research often
deters professors from offering academic
stimulation to these students. Today,
students who have been forced to take
their education in batches, have devel-
oped a collective sense of deprivation.
With the widening scope of student
activity, a change in professor-student
relations is being demanded. Students

are insisting upon education through
dialogue, upon an education which will
effectively assist them after graduation.
The great professors are those who have
provided the student with the type of
academic stimulation he is insisting up-
on, yet still being able to remind him
of his place in the scheme of things and
the fact that freedom is achieved through
discipline.

Following are the thoughts of this
year’s Great Professors on the topic of
“Changing Relationship of Students and
Teachers”.

Perhaps this is an engineering point of view but I have not observed any change in
relationships. It is the teacher’s job to create the situation, by numerous techniques
at his command, that will result in the greatest learning for the student in class and
out of class. It is the student’s job to learn. Until “Brave New World” or some
other artiﬁcial learning method arrives I doubt if the teaching-learning process and
relationship are going to change very much.

To my mind, there are two things especially that make
their joint adventure exciting to the student and the
teacher alike. One of them is the onset of the student’s grasp
of a fundamental point, often betokened by a sudden gleam
in the eye, which gladdens the teacher’s heart as well. The
other is the student’s posing of a genuinely penetrating
question that requires the teacher to rethink his subject
afresh, and reminds him that the search for truth—and not
he—is the arbiter in the classroom.

Forty-ﬁve years ago, we students took teachers, not
courses; today, students take courses not teachers. I was
friendly with many of my teachers for years after graduation
—always to my advantage. To me, these friendships and
their implications are the greatest changes in the relation
between teachers and students.

Edwin L. Peterson

I consider the diversity of col-
legiate student-teacher relation-
ships both desireable and natural
in the view of the array of per-
sonalities involved. Given the
power to change these relation-
ships, I would have each student
seek from each teacher a depth of
learning which goes well beyond
that encyclopedic facility so use-
ful at cocktail parties and exams.
I would have each student more
actively searching for those rare
insights which are intellectually
exciting and fulﬁlling.

For Socrates living example was as
important as dialogue, study the com-
plement of civic conduct. Today’s
commendable pursuit of mass educa-
tion, coupled with the less estimable
commercialization of life, has raised
twin dangers of students concerned
only with degrees and professors dedi-
cated to the accumulation of publica-
tions, and transformed the Socratic
ideal into a challenge to scholars.

David Montgomery
History

Once I could call my stu-
dents by name when I met
them; now, regrettably, I
cannot. However. there is
now more student-faculty
Contact through counseling
and more opportunity for
student involvement in edu-
cational planning. So we
have better education of the
faculty by the students.

It always has been one of
the rewards of college teach-
ing that “you meet the nicest
young people". I see no
change in this.

Allan l\I. Bryson

The school of liberal arts is the oldest and largest in the
University. Most students, including the engineers, have
been enrolled in its three divisions: humanities, social sciences,
and natural sciences. Due to an interested administration
and an effective Liberal Arts Cabinet, students were able to
take advantage of several new policies in the school this
year. Under the pass-fail system, students are allowed to
take six credits of work for which they receive a pass or fail
mark instead of a letter grade. Credits taken in this manner
still fulﬁll graduation requirements. A two day reading
period was added to the winter session to give students
ample time to prepare for ﬁnals. With the cooperation of the
professors involved, the Liberal Arts Cabinet polled classes
for an evaluation of the Distribution of Studies courses.
Data from the questionaires will be compiled in a course
guide and published in the summer.

Engineering Hall is his home for four years;
the slipstick, his bosom pal. Except for an occa-
sional, soon-forgotten humanities course, he
ventures from the Hill once a year for Engi-
neers’ Week and perhaps once again to turn an
election in favor of a crony. After four years of
seminars, calculus and labs, he can expect
Boeing, Alcoa, Shell Oil, and Westinghouse to
wait in line for him with a sizeable check and a
draft deferment.

If the engineers have acquired the stereo-
typed image of anti-intellectual technicians, it
is the unfortunate fault of their self-imposed
isolation. Those few engineers, both male and
female, who have contributed to extra-curricular
life at the University have proven themselves
worthy members of the institution.

Education

For the past few years the School of
Education has enabled holders of a
Liberal Arts Bachelor Degree to ob-
tain a Masters Degree in Education
through the M.A.T. program. A
participant in the program retains the
ﬂexibility of a liberal arts program
while student teaching and obtaining
education credits during the three terms
of the Master’s Program.

For the undergraduate there are still
the four terms of Liberal Arts followed
by three terms in the School of Educa-
tion and a term of student teaching. A
double major requirement leaves the
student little time for electives.

It is during student teaching that
graduates and undergraduates alike
enter the classroom to discover the
rewards and trials of the profession they
have chosen.

Nursing

Donning her blue and white uniform, a Pitt nursing
student enters the three year program of the School of
Nursing after two years in liberal arts. Girls receive
hospital training as soon as they enter the school, in
addition to their classroom preparation.

As she enters the world of the medical center,
usually living in the nurses’ residence, a student nurse
is exposed to a variety of learning situations. Her duties
may take her to Children’s, Magee, Presbyterian,
and Veterans’ Administration hospitals or to Western
Psychiatric Clinic.

Thus each girl gains practical experience in all
phases of Nursing from geriatrics and obstetrics to
psychiatry and surgery.

The school also offers masters and doctoral degrees.

The four year dentistry course trains
the student to become as skilled in using
his hands as he is in using his intellec-
tual abilities.

Students in the School of Dentistry,
of the ﬁve schools of the health profes-
sions, receive two years of pre-clinical
instruction before actually working with
patients. They learn to manipulate the
tools of the profession in order to ease
pain and cure disease. The long rows
of chairs and instruments in the dental
clinic become his laboratory for his
remaining two years where he learns
to work with the trust of his patient.
The clinic serves members of the com-
munity who could not afford more
expensive treatment as well as giving
experience to the new dentist.

Pharmacy

At some time during their three year program in the School of Pharmacy,
pharmacy students in their white jackets may be seen measuring, weigh-
ing, funneling, grinding, and stirring medicinal preparations or testing
samples of their classmates’ blood. After two years of liberal arts training,
the student enters a world of intensive study of all phases of the pharma-
ceutical profession to prepare him for careers ranging from hospital
pharmacology to industrial pharmaceutics to managing a corner drug
store. The pharmacy student learns the dedication and responsibility of a
man on whose skill rests the health and well-being of hundreds of people.
The professional spirit carries through to extracurricular activities such
as the pharmaceutical fraternities—Kappa Psi, Phi Delta Chi, and Alpha
Zeta Omega and the Pitt Capsule—a magazine of pharmacy published
three times a year by students in the school.

Two years ago Pitt made the big-
time. Headlines ﬂashed in local and
national publications about the dissolu-
tion of Edward Litchﬁeld’s pipe dream.
Science magazines ran a meticulously
researched series on the causes of the
ﬁscal problems. The flash was short,
not sweet, and the past two years have
been spent in quiet austerity. Dr. David
Kurtzman came from the Fels Institute
in Philadelphia to apply his ﬁnancial
wizardry. He and a corps of diehard
University administrators and state
legislators created the University of
Pittsburgh in the Commonwealth System
of Higher Education. State-related be-
came the by-word of the new Pitt with
guaranteed state funds reducing tuition
costs for students and giving the Univer-
sity privied access to state resources.
Now the University has made the transi-
ticn from the Litchﬁeld era to the state-
related era. The question remains-
What next? Throughout the ﬁscal crisis
there were continued worries about de-
clining academic status. Talk grew of
the reincarnation of a street-car Univer-
sity geared solely to concerns of, by, and
for Western Pennsylvania. Good acade-
micians would then leave the University
to produce automatons to ﬁll the re-
gion’s needs. Yet the staunchest support
during the crisis came from the faculty.
Although some left the University, ad-
ministrators said there was not much
variance from the normal turnover rate.
Salaries have since been made secure and
a number of departments have begun
vigorous expansion of programs and
faculty. While the University has the

Organizations are many
things to those that take ad-
vantage of them—fun, work,
relaxation, exasperation, re-
warding experiences, and
much more. At the spring
Student Government Gener-
al Assembly, the list of or-
ganizations to be represented
was surprisingly long, even
to those who have been at
Pitt for more than two years.
Pitt’s organizations vary
radically in size, activity,
and purpose. At least six of
the organizations are gov-
erning bodies for the Univer-
sity’s schools. Some of the
groups are sounding boards
for current topics—namely
Vietnam and civil rights.
The Student Union board,
with its many subdivisions,
is responsible for most of the
cultural, educational, and
social programs at Pitt. A
miscellany of professional,
musical, forensic, and athlet-
ic organizations complete
the list. With such a variety
of organizations, a non-active
student is usually non-ac-
tive by choice.

R.O.T.C.

“Pray for rain!” was the chant of the Army
R.O.T.C. cadets each Tuesday morning as
they prepared for drill on the Cathedral lawn.
In the event that the weather proved ill-
suited for marching, the Corps learned the
basics of military theory and its code of con-
duct; or an aspiring cadet might practice
with the M-1 riﬂe at the newly opened ar-
tillery range in Trees Hall.

The two year R.O.T.C. course is designed
to give men practical training in military
science as well as an alternative to the one
year physical fitness requirement. After his
second year a cadet may elect to continue in
the advanced R.O.T.C. courses for the re-
mainder of his college career. Admission is
highly competitive, based on physical exami-
nations and past performance in the mili-
tary ﬁeld. This year over one hundred cadets
applied for less than ﬁfty such positions. Up-
on completion of this four year course a cadet
is commissioned a second lieutenant.

The military year is climaxed by the an-
nual awards ceremony and the Military Ball,
Pitt’s only university-wide formal event which
was held at the Pittsburgh Hilton.

best and most active year in its forty-
seven year history at Pitt. Innovation be-
gan with the establishment of a Women’s
Judicial Board composed of senior women.
The Board will review any infractions of
the Housing rules and other problems.
Freshman Council began the City Sister
Program and Women’s Housing Board
instituted unlimited midweek permissions.
AWS consolidated the four information
booklets for women into one AWS
Handbook which will be distributed to
Freshmen women in the summer. In addi-
tion to several get-togethers for transfer
and re-located students, AWS sponsored
a lecture by a noted Pittsburgh gynecol-

Cheerleaders

The cheerleaders’ efforts to boost a sag-
ging school spirit resulted in a broadening
of their activities this year. The squad at-
tended four away and four home football
games, introduced three new cheers, and
invited football coach Dave Hart to speak
at their Homecoming pep rally. The cheer-
leaders were invited to cheer for the Steel
Bowl this winter. The members of the

appearance and poise, by a panel of judges
from the athletic department, faculty and
squad captains. Members must maintain a

resources to keep in the rat-race of ac-
ademia, there still remains the question
of regionalism. Dr. Wesley Posvar,
newly-appointed chancellor, has said
the University’s most important function
is to use its resources for the good and
welfare of the region. His concerns plus
the drop in out—of-state students have
given many lingering thoughts about
Trolley-Car U. Both Posvar and Dean
of Student Affairs, _]ack Critchﬁeld have
asserted the beneﬁts of the regional con-
cern. Posvar says the regional concern
will only be one, though a primary one,
focus of the school’s resources. Critch-
ﬁeld feels the priority given in-state stu-
dents will not lower. but raise the
quality of the student body. These men
are helping the University maintain a
precarious balance on the tight-rope of
state-relatedness. The State of Pennsyl-
vania must receive compensation for its
funds by priorities to in-state students
and community affairs. Faculty and
students must feel they are in an aca-
demically above-average school. All
wait on the sidelines to see how the
challenge is met.

Meeting the challenge now means
meeting the community in unity. Wil-
liam Rea, new Chairman of the Board
of Trustees, remains an active member of
the civic wing of the Pittsburgh Board
of Education. He and the newly-ap-
pointed trustees bring the governing
board even closer to state and local
concerns. Carnegie Tech President H.
Guyford Stever has already met several
times with Dr. Kurtzman. Their new
vision may be to change the concrete
streets of Oakland into pulsating arter-
ies of Knowledge.

A short man with graying hair came
slowly walking down Forbes Avenue
one morning. He was clad in a well-
tailored grey-ﬂannel suit, a hat neatly
placed on his small head, and a busi-
ness man’s demeanor painted over him.
As he passed a student meandering to
class he gave a short friendly smile like
a patriarch watching one of his chil-
dren grow another inch. The man was
David Kurtzman. He was Chancellor
of the University of Pittsburgh. It was
that image of the benevolent parent
which he conveyed during his tenure.
He summed it up in his commence-
ment address by giving thanks to the
students for the knowledge they had
exchanged. During his stay as Vice-
Chancellor of Finance and Chancellor,
Kurtzman earned the reward of a
bounty hunter. Fiscal soundness had

Engineering Cabinet

The Engineering Student Cabinet is
the governing body for those enrolled in
Pitt’s School of Engineering. The Cabi-
net worked closely with the Central
Planning Committee of Engineers’ Week
to coordinate activities. An intramural
sports program among the departments
was sponsored this year. A bi-weekly
publication, the Bulletin, is printed by
the Cabinet to inform the students of the
activities within the School. The
ESCITT award for travel and training
abroad is presented annually by the
Cabinet. Each year the outstanding
senior is honored at the Engineering
banquet. The special projects for 1966-
67 included the design of a new seal for
the School of Engineering and the pres-
entation of a pass-fail option to the
Dean.

year.

The General Alumni Association
is the graduate’s continuing link with
his alma mater.

Because of the Association’s belief
that education does not end with a
degree, the Alumni staff arranges for
faculty speakers at meetings of some
ﬁfteen Pitt Clubs throughout the
country and at those of the Associa-
tion’s fourteen constituent groups.
In addition, Alumni Continuing Ed-
ucation Day is held on the campus
each winter.

Pitt, the quarterly publication of
the Alumni Association, keeps grad-
uates informed about campus devel-
opments.

Under the auspices of the Alumni
Schools Committee, alumni through-
out the country meet prospective
freshman from their communities and
acquaint them with Pitt. In the past
year, with the cooperation of Student
Government a Student Schools Com-
mittee has been formed to assist in
this program.

Through the Annual Giving Fund
graduates help future generations of
Pitt students by ﬁnancial aid to the
University.

as we were fortunate to have Dr. Ru-
benstein, a leader in the new theolog-
ical ferment, give his views on the sub-
ject.

The function of the Liberal Arts Cabinet is to act as a liaison between Liber-
al Arts students and the faculty and administration. Although the cabinet has
been in existence for several years, this is the first year that it has been instru-
mental in making changes and presenting new ideas on behalf of the stu-
dents. A pass-fail system for upperclassmen has been instituted. The two-day
reading‘ period before ﬁnals was first presented by the council. During the
winter term, the Cabinet conducted an evaluation of most distribution of
studies courses, which will be published next year.

Men’s Council is primarily responsible for introducing
male students to the University through the summer orienta-
tion program, Freshmen camp, Freshmen Council, and
events such as the Activities Fair. This was co-sponsored
with AWS to give all students an insight into the workings
of campus activities. Men’s Council also sponsored Transfer
Days during which students from regional campuses and
other universities could become acquainted with each
other and their new environment.

The year will be remembered as a period of disorder
when the organization was tagged as useless and trite; a
repetition of Student Government. The chief problem
occurred when the Council’s constitution was not ratiﬁed
by the University recognitions committee before its elections
and a question of the legitimacy of the organization arose.
Council was given a chance to prove itself by October 1967.
Outgrowths of this were plans for an upper class advisor
program, a leadership conference and Fall elections for
Freshmen Council.

With these prospects, Men’s Council must strive to meet
the challenge of this university.

Men’s Dorm Council

Men’s Dorm Council is a representative group
of male dormitory residents who debate and
vote on legislation pertaining to all Towers’
dwellers. It contributes to the comfort of the
student and enhances the cultural atmosphere
of the university. Furthermore, MDC sponsors
the intramural sports competition among
Towers’ houses and occasionally provides relief
from the academic worries with TGIF dances.
This year Men’s Dorm Council sponsored a
weekend entirely planned for dorm residents
which featured the Lettermen in concert, a
game night, and a Dinner-Dance in the Towers’
Cafeteria. In addition, it continued to operate
the Towers’ laundry and dry-cleaning service.

The interested student was also given the
opportunity to hear seminars with the University
Chaplains and debates with Student Government
candidates.

Among the important legislation passed by the
Council was a bill which finalized the rules for
distribution of literature in the dorms and one
creating new social regulations concerning fe-
male visitation in the Towers.

Men’s Glee Club

The University of Pittsburgh Men’s
Glee Club, under the direction of Mr.
Philip S. Cavanaugh, is the oldest and
most respected activity at the University.
Composed of undergraduate and graduates
from all ﬁelds of study, it presents a well-
balanced, professional program of the
finest music available for men’s voices.
Past and present accomplishments include
singing at the New York World’s Fair and
such colleges as Centenary, Bowling Green
and the University of Toronto. This year,
the fall and winter tours took them to
Southern Connecticut State College, the
State University of New York at New
Paltz, and Sweet Briar College. The spring
tour was highlighted by a performance
at the British Embassy in Washington
D.C. The Glee Club has sung for Parent’s
Weekend, Pitt Preview, pep rallies and
many other University sponsored programs.

William Pitt Debate Union

Each year members of the William
Pitt Debate Union engage in approx-
imately 500 intercollegiate debates
across the United States. WPDU
also oFFers an international program.
Pitt debaters participate in Canadian
tournaments. For the ﬁrst time, two
WPDU members will tour Great
Britain debating at Oxford, Edin-
burgh, and other universities. The
Union sponsors various informal de-
bates at the University, an invita-
tional high school tournament, and
a public series program.

alluded Pitt, threatening its image as an
academic institution. He systematically
sought out the culprits and secured a
ﬁnancial base from which to grow. Dr.
Kurtzman, a political scientist special-
izing in public ﬁnance, took the role of
the diplomat in addition to re-aligning
the school’s ﬁnances. He dealt effectively
with faculty, students and community
leaders in all required situations. His
heir now need not worry perpetually
about being on the brink of ﬁnancial
disaster. Dr. Wesley Posvar can use the
brinksmanship of a polished diplomat to
develop a vital Pitt under state-related-
ness. He also is a political scientist with
an arm-length list of military and aca-
demic honors. His primary concerns
as Dean of the Social Sciences at the Air
Force Academy were strategy and
decision-making. In physical stature
Posvar resembles more the stern, disci-
plinary parent with heavy curling eye-
brows and grimmacing face. Yet Dr.
Posvar faces a different, but equal chal-
lenge to that of Dr. Kurtzman. He
must now learn to walk the streets of

Oakland.

Within the School of Pharmacy, there are three fraternities, Kappa Psi, Phi Delta
PharInaCy Chi, Alpha Beta Omega; one sorority, Lambda Sigma; and one honorary, Rho Chi.
 Over ﬁfty percent of the School’s students are members of one of these organizations.
The coordination these five pharmaceutical societies is the responsibility of the Phar-
macy IFC. The Council is composed of one delegate from each group. Every No-
vember the IFC, in conjunction with its member groups, sponsors an open house at the
School of Pharmacy. At that time the faculty and students greet the pre-pharmacy stu-
dents and acquaint them with the school.

Student Government

The purpose of the Student Government is to give author-
itative direction to the student body. It achieves this by
orienting new students and their parents through Freshmen
Outing and Parents’ Weekend. It orders the collegians’ lives
by supervising publication of the Student Directory and a
University Calendar of events. For relaxation it sponsors
Homecoming and Winter Weekend and in recognition of
academic excellence and outstanding participation in activ-
ities, the annual Tap Day. SG established a University Re-
view Board and a President’s Council to meet with the
Chancellor. Other important functions of the body were
operation of the book exchange and the allocation of
organizational funds. It established a committee on oil-
campus housing. SG conducted an investigation of Auxilary
Enterprises and its director’s connection with Your Campus
Store.

Student Union Board

Innovation was the keynote of Student
Union programming this year despite the
absence of an overall chairman.

The Four Seasons and the Back Porch
Majority drew full houses of students to two
free concerts at Syria Mosque.

Public Affairs speakers represented some
of the most outspoken and inﬂuential ﬁgures
in the world. Students who could not ﬁnd
room in the ballroom sat on the floor in the
SU lobby and lounge to hear Martin Luther
King, Stokely Carmichael, playwright Edward
Albee, sociologist Paul Goodman and political
scientist Robert Scalapino offer a wide slice of
current views. Politics were represented in the
ﬁgures of gubernatorial candidate, Milton
Shapp, and Senator Wayne Morse.

The graphic and musical arts received due
tribute in the Thursday night jazz series
in the lower lounge and in frequent painting
and photo exhibits in the marble lounge. The
COTA ﬁlm series sponsored free midweek
showings of foreign ﬁlms such as “Boris Gud-
onov,” “Kanal,” and “The Magician.” On
weekends there were such favorites as “Guns
of Navarone,” “Tom Jones,” “Topkapi,” and
“The Cardinal.”

SUB also engineered excursions to widely
spaced Notre Dame and Europe.

Despite all the activities, students still
found time to “relax” in the lower lounge.

University Theater

The University of Pittsburgh Theater has presented
a wide Variety of plays this year which have attracted
large audiences. The “Duchess of Malﬁ” was their
major production. The nature of the play and the
theater’s creativity in presenting it provided a mem-
orable experience for the audience. The most success-
ful venture of the Theater was the new repertory
theater located in the Cathedral of Learning. Several
one act plays were presented on Friday evenings.
“The Man with the Flower in his Mouth”, Beckett’s
“Krapp’s Last Tape” and Sartre’s “No Exit” were
included in the Theater’s program. This repertory
theater is one of the few of its type existing on college
campuses in this country.

Publications

The center of Student Publications is the fourth floor of Schenley Hall. Be-
tween classes and at night publications are assembled which interest most of
the University community. Each publication has a purpose and character of
its own. This year the staffs were not as close as in the past. There was little
sharing of personnel or problems. Yet the typical arguments and discussions
about the administration and student government continued. The high school
clinics were held, posing similar difﬁculties to each staff. Deadlines were met.
The fourth floor was still the place to be, the home away from home.

Pitt News

156

Through the summer months of 1966, the
conﬂict over appropriations and state-related-
ness for Pitt raged in Harrisburg. During this
time while every Pitt student eagerly awaited
any type of legislative decision, it was the
Pitt New.s that kept everyone abreast of the
latest developments. Each new Harrisburg
delay made the front page, while editorially
the News demanded faster -legislative approv-
al. Meanwhile, a top Communist spoke on
campus and several students called for the
abolishment of ROTC. The University was
abusy place.

But that was only the beginning of a year
that would find the Pitt News covering stories
that would have a heavy impact on the
University. Plans for new dorms were an-
nounced; relations with Helen Clay Frick
were severed; and a new chancellor and
chairman of the Board were named. To
provide the best possible coverage, the paper
was issued daily during the Student Govern-
ment campaign.

The Pitt News has ﬁnished recording an-
other year. A similar task lies ahead as the
paper enters its ﬁfty-sixth year of publication.

'The

1967

-..——v—- -

The Owl is many things. To the student body that eagerly awaits its
annual delivery, hurriedly glances through it, and then quickly rele-
gates it to collecting dust on a bookshelf, the book is often little more
than a collection of pictures; a catalogue of good looking and not so
good looking sorority girls or the place to ﬁnd the name of the officer of
that honorary whose name has been forgotten. But to the people who
give up their week nights and all too many of their weekends, the book
is an attempt to capture a year at Pitt graphically; to critically analyze
what differentiates this one year at the University of Pittsburgh from
the 180 that have preceeded it; to ﬁnd new ways to publish a book
that will force the reader to look twice. to read, to think, and to re-
member. This is the 1967 OWL.

l59

Skyscraper

Skyscraper Engineer, olﬁcial
undergraduate publication of the
School of Engineering, made sev-
eral innovations this year. With the
aid of Dean Hoelschcr, a program to
encourage representatives from each
department was initiated to contri-
bute to the magazine.

Heather Harris, Business Man-
ager, developed the Recruiting Cal-
endar as a service to engineering
students and company representa-
tives.

Robert Anservitz provided articles
about faculty members and out-
standing alumni. Al Nauda and
Dennis Ramsier kept readers in-
formed of Engineering Student Cabi-
net’s activities.

The staff also worked closely with
the Central Planning Committee on
Engineers’ Week in publicizing the
activities.

The Techni-Cutie and the Slips
of the Stick joke page were again two
popular features.

Ideas and Figures

Ideas and Figures is the campus literary magazine, usu-
ally. It was founded in 1959 by someone who thought it
would be cool to have a campus literary magazine. Un-
fortunately he was wrong as most members of the university
community will most willingly testify. But in spite of this, the
magazine still publishes short stories, essays, poetry, photog-
raphy and student art work not including the avant garde
drawings and cliches in the Towers elevators.

Probably the most notable achievement of the staff was
the secret repainting of the ofﬁce. The colors, black and
lavender, met with wide acclaim from the Student Union
authorities, who recommended the room be a trial area for
this year’s poverty program.

The I&F Military Arts parade was unavoidably cancelled
when the stall” discovered there weren’t any military artists.
Unrelated to this is the fact that the staff provided an excel-
lent control group for the Pill News feature on Campus
Morality. And completely unrelated to everything, I&F
publishes a literary magazine, which is small, expensive,
and only slightly interesting (to anyone who reads Ayn
Rand, Walter Lippman or Conscience nfa Conservative.) and
most obviously only peripheral to the true intentions ofl & F.

This year, WPGI-I, the student-operated radio station of
the University, expanded its broadcasting to 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

The station aptly broadcast the gory details of the spring
riots and was the ﬁrst to announce the cancellation of school

due to snow.

WPGI-I continued its reporting of national and interna-
tional news through the U.P.I. wire service. Opening the
doors to Dr. Kurtzman’s ofﬁce, it solicited questions from

 the student body and broadcast the chancellor’s answers.

with the ambitious goal of presenting an
“all around” picture of Pitt in an informa-

freshmen, administration, and undergradu-

of asking “What questions are most asked

Ofﬁce of
Student
Publications

At Pitt, the Oﬂice of Student Publications
does not direct as much as it coordinates
the activities of undergraduate publica-
tions. Students are encouraged to assume
the responsibility of the organization and
content of their publications. Any prob-
lems which arise that need the aid of an
advisor are handled through the Director
of Student Publications. Contracts with
printers, plans for high school clinics
and information concerning national stu-
dent publications conventions originate or
pass through the Director’s oﬂice. The
office also makes the arrangements for the
annual selection of editors and business

managers.

Across each student invoice there now appears in bold lettering, “Less Pennsylvania State Residence
Allowance”. That one line symbolizes Pitt’s existence as a University. The state-related deduction
has allowed a freshman class of nearly 2,000 to enroll for September 1967. Most of these stu-
dents will be from Pennsylvania. Each one has been produced by a diﬂerent interaction of heredity and
environment. Each one walks, talks, eats, sleeps, and studies differently. Each one has his peculiar
goals, aims, and aspirations. When each receives a window-faced envelope in August 1967
the each no longer exists. All become numbers. They are different numbers, but all are programmed by
the computer on to an invoice. That invoice becomes the common denominator. All are comrades
with the same problems and woes. All must pay the activities fee recently affixed to the
drab-blue invoice. All must acquaint themselves with the drop-add procedure, time schedules, and
unavailable advisors. All must learn to cope with the gum-chewing, hip-swinging employees of the Ofﬁce
of Student Records. All that comes from a small sheet of paper called an invoice.

Honoraries

Through the years a number of honorary organizations have been established at
Pitt to recognize students who have contributed signiﬁcantly to the University through
their services, leadership or scholarship in particular and varied ﬁelds. The value of
honoraries is an often debated subject. Some feel that the existence of an honorary
system encourages students to strive not for the ideal of service and scholarship but
for the honorary membership these qualities will bring. However, the type of service
which qualiﬁes a student for an honorary is time consuming and consistent. The
students leadership must be creative and eﬁective. His scholarship must usually be
above 3.00. A successful balance of these three qualities is indicative of the students
ability and interest. It seems doubtful that a student who was interested only in
recognition and not in the work involved would make the necessary sacriﬁces, would
accept the additional responsibilities and limitations merely to pay the membership
fees of an honorary to which he was tapped.

Gamma Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa, mens’
junior-senior leadership honorary, celebrated its
ﬁftieth anniversary this year. The occasion was
was marked not only by a special Founder’s Day
program in December, but by coverage by the
national magazine of ODK. Mr. James Reynolds,
Assistant Secretary of Labor, was the featured
speaker for the anniversary. Deans W. Edward
Sell (Law), Harold Hoelscher (Engineering) and
James Kehl (Liberal Arts) were initiated into the
University chapter with Mr. Reynolds. The affairs
also brought numerous past ODK Men of the Year
and other alumni back to Pittsburgh. During the
year a total of nearly 30 new students, faculty
and honorary members were initiated. These stu-
dents joined the 25 member active membership in
luncheon meetings and several evening discussion
groups at Gustines. Ralph Manning, Vice-Presi-
dent of the circle and President of Student Govern-
ment, was selected ODK Man of the Year by a
committee of alumni and faculty. President Bill
Cabin and Manning turned over their ofﬁces in
April to Marc Spiegel and Mike Weingarten, respec-
tively.

Mortar Board recognizes those women
who have out-standing achievement in schol-
arship, leadership, and service to the Univer-
sity. Membership in the chapter is limited
to twenty-ﬁve women who are tapped during
the winter prior to their senior year. Recom-
mendations are received from the faculty,
administration, and campus leaders. Each
year Mortar Board and ODK, the men’s
leadership honorary, have joint meetings. The
regional convention for Mortar Board chap-
ters was held at Pitt last fall. During the year,
Mortar Board holds regular program meet-
ings at which free discussion is encouraged.
Dr. Allen Pollack spoke to the chapter about
the organization of Soviet Universities.
Other guest speakers have been Dr. Agnew
from Graduate School of Business, and Dr.
Rubenstein, contemporary theologian and
Jewish chaplain at Pitt. Mortar Board mem-
bers aided the Dean of Women’s Ofﬁce by
giving tours of the University to prospective

Druids was established at Pitt
in 1916 to recognize and encour-
age leadership, scholarship,
service and character among
undergraduate men. Only sopho-
more and junior men are elig-
ible for tapping and in addition to
the 2.5 quality point average
minimum, those considered for
membership must have a primary
leadership role (Pres. or Vice-
Pres.) in one campus organization
and a secondary role in two other
activities. Druids also recognizes
members of the faculty and ad-
ministration who have shown a
great interest in the University
and its students. Dr. Edward
Litchﬁeld, Dr. David Kurtzman
and Dr. Jonas Salk are a few
Druid Honorary members.

Cwens, a national honorary for sophomore women was
founded at the University of Pittsburgh in 1922. The honor
society taps freshman women who achieve a quality point
average of 3.0 during their first term and who have demon-
strated leadership potential.

The purpose of Cwens is to foster scholarship among
sophomore and freshman women and to promote the
interests of the University. This year’s Cwens continues its
tutoring program for women. They assisted with freshman
orientation and aided the Pittsburgh Symphony with some
of its paperwork.

Phi Eta Sigma, the National Freshman Honor
Fraternity, taps each year those full-time men
students who attain a quality point average of
3.5 during their first term at the University. In
addition to its function of recognizing academic
excellence, the honor fraternity oﬂ"ers a univer-
sity-wide tutoring program. This service is
administrated on a voluntary basis and is desig-
nated to meet the personal demands of each tutee.
Phi Eta Sigma has recently begun to award
those members who have continued to achieve
outstanding quality point averages. Four such
presentations were made this year at Tap Day
ceremonies.

Sigma Tau

Sigma Tau is a national honorary engineering fraternity
which recognizes outstanding men in all ﬁelds of engineering.
Qualiﬁcations for membership in Sigma Tau are junior or
senior status and a minimum 3.00 QPA. Tappees participate
in a pledge program during which they make pledge books
and obtain the signatures of all active members and at least
three faculty sponsors. Recently, outstanding engineering
professors have been tapped as honorary members of the
fraternity.

The highlight of the fall initiation banquet is the presen-
tation of the outstanding Freshman Award to the sophomore
engineering student who achieved the highest QPA in his
freshman class.

Sigma Tau plans to place a pyramid, the symbol of the
fraternity, in the new Benedum Engineering Building.

med” pamphlet. This year a “Pathways
to the Profession” symposium on medi-
cal education was sponsored. Tours of
the University of Pittsburgh Medical
School are also a part of AED’s pro-
gram. The honorary was founded at
the University of Alabama in 1906. To
be eligible for membership, students
must have a 3.00 Quality Point Average

Alpha
Tau Delta

Alpha Tau Delta is a
national fraternity for
women in nursing. It was
established in 1921 to
further higher profession-
al educational standards
for women in the profes-
sion. To be eligible for
membership, the student
must have a 2.5 quality
point average. ATD cele-
brates its Founders Day
in February. This year
ATD has invited several
guest speakers to its
meetings. Members are
currently organizing an
alumni chapter which
would work closely with
the collegiate chapter in
special projects.

Alpha Phi Omega

Alpha Phi Omega is a service oriented fraternity. APO
men usher at University functions, provide refreshment and
coat-check facilities at Student Union affairs, and sponsor
University-wide dances for charity. APO and Chi Omega
built the Homecoming Queens ﬂoat this year. The greatly
improved travel/for sale bulletin board in the Student Union
was also a project of APO. In the winter, the fraternity
sponsors the annual Ugly Man on Campus contest which
provides funds that support an Equadorian orphan as well
as area medical institutions. At present APO is planning a
Stanton Crawford Memorial Film Series for September,
1967.

Kappa Kappa Psi is a national honorary fraternity of bandsmen_ Thirty members
were tapped twice during the year after they had served for two trimesters in either
the concert, brass, Panther, or marching bands. Pledges were chosen on the basis of
outstanding musicianship and leadership and they go through a full trimester pledge
program.

The organization sponsors several pledge parties and each year Kappa Kappa Psi
holds a dance at a downtown hotel. Awards are presented for perfect attendance at
musical events. The year’s president was Jay Snyder and the organization is sponsored
by Robert L. Arthur, band director.

Usually the Greek system is seen
only in caricature. It is the answer to
the lonely student’s prayer. It is all
brotherhood and sisterhood and good
times. Greeks spend their time in the
Tuck Shop over cokes not Sartre.
What is seldom realized and often
ignored is the fact that the Greek
system is not just an assemblage of
unthinking unresponsibles nor its
only activities the rites of spring. One
who seriously assumes the responsi-
bility of sorority or fraternity mem-
bership will ﬁnd something quite dif-
ferent than the Era of Good Feeling.
Means of improving school spirit,
coping with strict quota, and initiat-
ing new programs under a some-
times unyielding administration are
problems which affect the chapters
in varying degrees. Reconstructing a
chapter’s decrepit reputation or con-
structing a new one is a challenge.
Ultimately, it is the problems and
responsibilities which make mem-
bership worthwhile. It is from these
experiences that members mature and
friendships are formed.

Interfraternity
Council

The Interfraternity Council is the
governing body for Pitt’s fraternities.
The function of I.F.C. is to regulate
and supervise activities, such as rush,
which involve the entire fraternity sys-
tem. An intramural athletic program
is maintained by I.F.C. for member
fraternities. This program is directed
by the physical education department.
Every October the Council sponsors the
I.F.C. Ball. Greek Week, held in early
March, is co-sponsored with the Pan-
Hellenic Council. I.F.C. is a service not
only to its member groups, but also to
the community. In the past, members
have done volunteer work for charity
organizations in the Pittsburgh area.

Delta Sigma Phi

For the brothers of Delta Sigma Phi,
this past year was a very active one. The
Delta Sigs were engaged in almost every
campus activity from the Interfraternity
Council to WPGH. Members were starters
in most varsity sports, and the chapter com-
peted in the I.F.C. intramural program.
This year Delta Sigs held a Valentine’s
Day party for the children at the School
for the Blind. At the beginning of the
Winter term, the interior of the fraternity
house was completely remodeled and
painted. Delta Sigs have always had a
busy social schedule, the events ranging
from the usual Saturday night parties to
a weekend at Laurel Mountain. With the
two large pledge classes taken this year,
the chapter looks forward to years even
better than this past one.

HELEN POOL RUSH, Assistant to the Chancellor

HERBERT MCGIBBENY, Dean of Men

Perhaps the most signiﬁcant by-product of state-related-
ness has been the required priority given in-state students.
Dr. jack Critchﬁeld was Dean of Admissions and Student
Aid throughout the state—related deliberation. It was he
who had to ward off thoughts of declining quality of students
and cautions about maintaining a diversiﬁed student body.
These issues still remain, but the priorities are deﬁnitely set.
Critchﬁeld now moves to insure that incoming students will
follow a stable course at state—related Pitt. He replaced
Dean Helen Pool Rush as Dean of Student Affairs. Miss
Rush will become a special assistant to the Chancellor as
Dean Critchﬁeld coordinates the intricate aspects of student
life. Shifts like Rush and Critchﬁeld’s were only minor
changes in an overall administrative reorganization. The
University consolidated seven vice-chancellors into a core
triumverate of three; Finance, Academics, and the Profes-
sions. These shifts were the focal points for a slew of minor
changes throughout the administrative hierarchy. They were
the outgrowth of ﬁscal revamping begun two years ago. Now
the bureaucrats have realigned and the new Pitt is ready to
move.

 

For the brothers of Delta Tau Delta the long, often
tedious, hours of academic work were relieved by
varied activities this year. Social events ranged from
Friday jammies to the Delt Fall Formal. Social
events were a small part of the year’s schedule.
Delta Tau Delta sponsored a Plus-Factor Lecture
Series, hearing speakers from the business, religious,
political, and military worlds. The fraternity
also organized special events for members with
particular interests, such as a tour of Allegheny
General Hospital. Delts served on a variety of cam-
pus organizations ranging from Inter-Fraternity
Council to the Hill Education Project. Within the
fraternity, the Scholarship Award Fund was used to
honor three outstanding students.

Kappa
Sigma

Pitt’s chapter of Kappa Sigma
began in September as a local fra-
ternity, Delta Iota Delta, and ended
in April as a colony of one of the
largest national fraternities. Mem-
bers have always been active in
extra-curricular activities: Sky-
scraper Engineer, Engineering Stu-
dent Cabinet, and Student Govern-
ment. Kappa Sigs participated
in both intramural and varsity
sports programs. The chapter was
well represented in honorary or-
ganizations, and one brother was
tapped to the Order of Omega.

Lambda Sigma Rho was oﬂicially recognized by the
Interfraternity Council this year. The Fraternity was
founded in 1961 at the University’s Johnstown campus.
Since that time, chapters have been established at the
Oakland Campus and at Jersey City College, New Jersey.
Beta Chapter has always participated enthusiastically
in campus activities. This year the brothers won second
place in football and softball in lFC’s intramural sports
program. Last winter they had the highest over-all aca-
demic average of any fraternity on campus.

Pi Lambda Phi

Although the entire year was a
good one for the brothers of Pi
Lambda Phi, the Greek commun-

achievements during Greek Week.
It was then that Bruce Martin was
named Mr. Fraternity 1966, “Blue
Skies” and “Red Sails In the Sun-
set” gained the approval of the
judges and first place in Greek
Sing, and the Pi Lams won both
the trophies for softball and bas-
ketball and All Greek Sports.
While certain members of the
Gamma Sigma chapter contributed
to the intramural program and
held positions on student publica-
tions and student government,
the chapter itself participated in
such campus activities as Home-
coming, Winter Weekend and the
annual Ugly Man on Campus con-

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Sigma Alpha Epsilon has always
encouraged its members to suc-
ceed in extracurricular and aca-
demic activities. The prizewinning
Homecoming Float, participation
in campus events, and number of
members holding responsible posi-
tions in campus organizations is
indicative of SAE’s involvement.
Brothers have been tapped to Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, Druids, Order
of Omega, Sigma Tau and other
honorary fraternities. A well-
planned social calendar provides
the necessary balance between
work and relaxation for a very
successful chapter.

For Sigma Alpha Mu, the
1966-67 year has been the best in
the chapter’s history at Pitt. Fall
and Winter rush added forty
members to the chapter. With
their help Friday and Saturday
night parties set the trend for the
year. The annual Winter Week-
end was the biggest social activity.

Scholastically, the Brothers
ranked first of the thirteen national
fraternities on campus and were
awarded academic honors by the
University.

Brothers have been quite active
in campus activities: Chairman
of Homecoming, President of
Men’s Council, OWL Organiza-

Sigma Chi

Sigma Chi’s basic principle, that a fraternity is
based on the brotherhood of men with different
temperments, talents and convictions, has resulted
in another successful year at Pitt. In the fall, the
Sigs presented Sigma Chi Derby Day for the first time
at Pitt. Derby Day was praised by all Greeks and
the general University community. The Sigs
placed ﬁrst at Homecoming and won the Inter-
fraternity football trophy. Sigma Chi was active
during Winter Weekend and placed very high in
Greek Week competition.

Individuals in Sigma Chi also made their mark
on campus activities. Ralph Manning, President
of Student Government, was chosen ODK Man of
the Year. Tom Meisner, newly elected Vice-President
of Student Government, was tapped into ODK.

Phi Gamma Delta

Pi Sigma chapter of Phi Gamma Delta cele-
brated 1966-67 as its ﬁftieth anniversary. In
February, the Fijis held their annual Norris Din-
ner, honoring the charter members of Pi Sigma.
The Fijis also presented the Student Union with
a special plaque. When that building was the
Schenley Hotel, it served as host to several
national conventions of Phi Gamma Delta. Pi
Sigma began its anniversary year well, taking
a pledge class of sixteen. Alumni and parents
receptions at Homecoming and Parents’ Weekend
were featured parts of the year. The Fijis
regularly invited representatives of other fra-
ternities to attend its chapter meals and to visit
the house.

When the ofﬁcial chapter designation of Zeta
Beta Tau at Pitt was changed to Beta Phi this
year, it served to underscore the new and rapidly
growing character of ZBT. Beta Phi was se-
lected the second most improved chapter by
ZBT National. The remodeling program re-
sulted in new furniture, wood panelling, and
other additons to the house. The “Dunk a Zeeb”
booth at the Winter Weekend Carnival was
among the most successful. The chapter’s entry
in the UMOC contest won second place.
Socially, ZBT began the year with a dinner-
dance at the Penn Sheraton, highlighted by a
newly instituted sweetheart ceremony. The scope
of Zeeb involvement in extra-curricular activities
ranges from the Pitt News, Student Government
and WPGH to debate and varsity track and
soccer. Zeebs have been honored by Druids,
ODK, Pi Delta Epsilon and Phi Eta Sigma.

Panhellenic

Panhellenic Council is composed
of representatives from each na-
tionally affiliated sorority at
Pitt. The Council’s major respon-
sibilities are the regulation of
rush and the promotion of schol-
arship in the sorority system. In
the past year, Panhel has suc-
ceeded in liberalizing rush rules
and is studying the possibility of
increasing the present member-
ship quota. During the winter
term the Council sponsors Panhel
Ball to honor all sorority
pledges and new initiates. Greek
Week is conducted by Panhellenic
Council and the Inter-Fraternity
Council.

A sorority, as any other organization must
experiment and change in order to keep its
vitality, yet the traditions which are the
foundation of a sorority must be preserved. The
sisters of Alpha Delta Pi are aware of
this need to remain vital and have initiated
new programs for the chapter. ADPi has
sponsored several lectures to which other soror-
ities were invited. This program will be con-
tinued and enlarged upon. To generate more
interest in Pitt athletic events, the sisters
participated enthusiastically in the spirit
award competition. In community service,
members read for the School for the Blind
and adopted a child from Appalachia.
Through these projects and many social
events, ADPi hopes to increase the bond of
friendship among the sisters.

Nu chapter of AEP has been an active
part of the University community this year.
Through the mixers, a dinner-dance at the
Le Mont, and undying spirit during Derby
Day, Homecoming and Greek Week, A E
Phis grew together in a bond of friendship
and understanding.

To serve the Pittsburgh community, Nu
chapter in association ‘with the Hill
House Day Care Center adopted ten four-
year-old emotionally and physically handi-
capped children. Sisters planned bi-
monthly activities and visits to the Day
Care Center.

Several members received special honors
this term,-president of Orchesis and THYR-

The sisters of Delta Delta Delta began the fall term
with their Fiftieth Anniversary celebration. Many
alumnae visited the chapter to reminisce and meet
the collegiate members. The Winter Formal, held at
Laurel Mountaingwas the social‘ highlight of the
year. At that time, the Tri-Delt Man of the Year was
named. The last activity before ﬁnals was the an-
nual Christmas Party.

The Trzi-Delts proudly display the scholarship
trophy they won for the highest over-all academic

average for 1966-67. In addition to this achieve-
ment, more than ﬁfteen sisters are members of honorary
organizations.

A winning spirit and more athletic ability than
they realized helped Tri-Delt win the events trophy
during Sigma Chi Derby Day. The second place
award was presented to the Tri-Delts and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon for the miniature ﬂoat which they built
for Homecoming.

Delta Zeta

Sororities have in the past been stereotyped. They are
usually presented as groups of frustrated cheerleaders or
supercilious snobs. What is completely overlooked is the fact
that a sorority‘is a group of young women; it is an or-
ganization through which one can mature and learn. The
sisters of Delta Zeta have created, through their friendship
and respect for one another, a chapter which can give its
members the best that sorority can offer. The sisters are in-
volved as individuals both in their chapter affairs and campus
activities. Their very individuality is the thing which pro-
vides the most challenging and fulﬁlling experiences.
Nothing can surpass the pleasure most DZ’s share in
speaking with one another, unconcerned with crossing the
t’s or dotting the i’s.

Delta Phi Epsilon

 

Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority reactiviated the Eta chapter at the University last October with
a group of twenty-ﬁve pledges. These girls immediately began to participate in campus
events such as Derby Day, Homecoming and the Ugly Man on Campus Contest. The girls
balance extracurricular and scholastic activities. Five members were on the Dean’s List in the
fall. The sisters and seven pledges are now busy thinking of new ideas for decorating their
suite in Amos Hall which will be the sorority’s headquarters.

Theta Phi Alpha is the embodiment
of the spirit of its members. This
spirit of loyalty, of achievement and
of service was evident in the chapter’s
activities this year. At Homecoming,
Theta Phi and the Pershing Riﬂes
won third place in the ﬂoat contest.
Members participated in the Mentor
program, Quo Vadis, Pitt News,
AWS, and several honoraries.
Among the chapter’s service projects
this year were a Doll Party for
orphans at Christmas, and a Valen-
tine’s Day visit to Children’s Hospi-
tal.‘Members also contributed to the

Kappa Alpha Theta

The sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta found the
past year both rewarding and fulﬁlling. Excitement
began with Fall rush and mounted throughout the
year. Highlights of the first term included our two
Homecoming Queen finalists and the co-chairman
of the Homecoming Weekend activities. Studies
were temporarily interruped for the house Christ-
mas Party. Our annual theater party and midnight
supper ended the term.

As the winter trimester got under way, the ex-
citement of another successful pledge class was
heightened as one of our pledges was crowned
Winter Weekend Queen. Panhellenic Ball, Founders
Day, and our annual party for the School for the
Blind added to our schedule of activities. Some of
the sisters were elected to Student Government and
Associated Women’s Students. We concluded the
year with Greek Week and our dinner-dance at Le
Mont honoring our graduating seniors and new
initiates.

Homecoming Queen. Activities con-
tinued with a Valentine’s Day Party

For the sisters of Sigma Delta Tau, 1966-67 will be remembered as a year
ﬁlled with scholastic, campus and sorority activities. A scholarship dessert was
held to reward those sisters whose quality point average had improved and
guest speakers were invited. Sig Delts participated in activities which included
Mortor Board, the Mentor and Senior Assistant programs, Student Union
Board and the OWL. Sorority events included a formal dinner-dance at Le
Mont, mixers, participation in Derby Day, Homecoming, Greek Week and
Winter Weekend. On Founder’s Day, a buffet was held in honor of our Fiftieth

Anniversary as a national sorority. We also entertained at the Jewish Home for

A sister of Phi Sigma Sigma can be found in almost any
activity at Pitt: cheerleading, Student Government, and candi-
dates for Greek Week and Homecoming Queens. They
sponsored many functions with other Greek organizations,
such as a fall picnic and a scholarship dessert. Their
philanthropy projects included Visiting the Pittsburgh Deten-
tion Home and selling lollipops for the Heart Fund. Their
parents were the special guests at a dinner-dance during *
Parent’s Weekend. Scholastically. Phi Sig rated second of

No one doubts that the 1966-67 Panther
sports scene was the most dismal in recent years.
The polluted air of defeat pervaded from Pitt
Stadium to the Field House to Trees Hall.
When a varsity team managed to win, the usual
reaction was “well, you can’t lose them all.”

But an air of optimism has replaced the air
of defeat. And head football coach Dave Hart
has spawned a new recruiting outlook for all
sports.

Hart’s recruiting program has recaptured Pitt’s
dominence in talent-rich Western Pa. It has be-
come increasingly difﬁcult for the Big Ten,
Miami, Notre Dame, the service academies, and
other football powers to land prospects. Hart
once said that he hoped to make the entire area
off-limits to everyone except Pitt and Penn
State. This past year he has even excluded
Penn State from the most sought after players.

When Hart sold Lloyd Weston, perhaps the
most prized high school football player in Amer-
ica, on Pitt, it epitomized the optimism his
successful recruiting has brought to the Athlet-
ic Department.

The bubble could burst, however, if the 33
recruits do not mesh and win their four fresh-
men games. The key to the next ﬁve years could
well be whether new freshman coach Darrell
Lewis can organize the individual talent to beat
the Ohio St., West Virginia, Penn St., and
Notre'Dame frosh.

There are two other new coaches who are
succeeding in their recruiting eﬂforts. Dave
Adams in wrestling, and Bill Grant in swim-
ming have promised to end the losing tradition
of the past few years. Adams, who was the
assistant coach at Navy, and Grant, who was a
winning coach at Mt. Lebanon H.S. have been
given the “go-ahead” signal by Athletic director
Frank Carver.

Both track and gymnastics faced manpower
problems last year. Now more scholarships and
more extensive recruiting promise to end those
difﬁculties for coaches Jim Banner and Warren
Neiger.

Only basketball seems to have trouble in rid-
ding itself of the vicious circle of needing the
star players to win and not being able to get the
star players because it’s losing. Recruiting is once
again the key. Coach Bob Timmons has proven
he can win when he has the ballplayers, and now
he must prove he can get them.

But if the overall recruiting continues on its
present level, in a few years the reaction when a
varsity team somehow loses will be, “well, we
can’t win them all, but we sure can try.”

Football

Frustration and despair haunted a
football season which witnessed a once
mighty tradition shudder and crumble
into near oblivion. Football fans did
not expect much and not much was
offered. It was the worst season in
Panther history.

New coach Dave Hart, an emphasis
on agility, and something called spirit
were to make 1967 the year of the
“new look”. The only new look came
from the grandstands where increased
time was spent looking at opponent’s
score.

Big time power Pitt was playing
with less than ﬁfty players on the
squad and Hart said less than half-a-
dozen had real talent. Dave Hart
gropped himself during his ﬁrst year
as head coach. He spoke early in the
season to local writers about the poor
squad. In fall training he questioned
how in the world certain players had
ever received a scholarship. After being
crunched by UCLA in the opening
game, Panther football entered a night-
mare-like twilight zone for the re-
mainder of the season.

After several humiliating defeats the
gridders gave a surge of energy. They
were not seeking victory so much as
to save face. They barely lost to Duke,
outplayed California, and ﬁnally beat
West Virginia.

222

223

After this effort the team fell ﬂat before both service acad-
emies. It may have been a patriotic gesture but seemed the
inevitable outcome of a team being psyched-up without the
material necessities. Hart’s team lacked those things valued
most~speed size, depth, and talent.

The gridders were playing without an offense after the
fourth game of the season. They gained a scant nine yards
rushing against Syracuse as the defensive unit played three-
quarters of the game. Notre Dame led only 7—0 at halftime.
The Irish were favored by 39 points. They won 4040.

224

Everybody wilted in the heat of Miami and nobody recovered
for Penn State.

Hart brought his team to every pre-game home pep rally.
The glory was there on Friday afternoons, but the power
rarely came on Saturday. Most football fanatics have given
Hart a 3-year grace period to salvage Pitt football. Hart
proved his ability as a recruiter in signing two good frosh
squads. Now he has two years to get a more authentic new
look on the varsity.

A man walks slowly along Forbes Avenue. Wrinkles run
deeply across his face like ripples of a strem newly-stirred by
a rushing wind. A construction worker passes by clad in metal
hat with sweat stained tee-shirt clinging to his skin. An
urchin-like youth propositions him to buy a Pittsburgh
Press. His begging eyes beam as a dime is tossed his way. A
few frolicking youths meander across the ‘street playing
hookey from afternoon classes. They toss insults at one
another and passers-by and enter the Briar Bowl. A young,
smartly-dressed youth steps from Gus Miller’s, his eyes cast
a condescending gaze on Oakland, and he proceeds with
New York Times in-hand to the Cathedral. Each face
passes another with seeming independence. Together they
are Oakland.

Freshman Football

Dave Hart leaned back in his chair. Raising his arm,
he slowly drew an imaginary map in the air. It was a
map of Western Pennsylvania. This was to be his ter-
ritory. For it was here that he would ﬁnd the raw
talent which would rebuild the football tradition.

Hart, a winning personality, recruited 32 prospects
his first time as head coach. He knew he had to do better
the next time around, even though he thought 12 of the
1967 frosh could have started for the varsity. As it was,
they spent all season routinely acting out opponent’s
plays.

They won only one of the four games they played as
a unit. Team play was below par but several individual
standouts offered some hope.

With seven starters back
from the 1965 NCAA tourney
squad, everyone was expecting
a big year from the soccer
team. But, the big year never
materialized, and the booters
settled down to a losing season.

The major reason for the
slump was a loss of spirit suf-
fered when it became obv_ious
that the team wasn’t going to
make it to the NCAA’s.

The season started off as ex-
pected with an easy 4—0
triumph over Frostburg. Then
came the games that were to
show if the team was going
anywhere—with perennial
power West Chester and top
ranked Michigan State. Al-
though they outshot West
Chester, the booters lost a
heartbreaker, 2—1 . Then
Michigan State humbled them,
6——0. But then, in their best
offensive display of the season,
they turned back NCAA con-
tender Ohio University, 5—2.

Next came the game
that broke their back.
With the help of some
unabashedly home ﬁeld
refereeing, Slippery Rock
slipped past the booters,
3—2. Losing their cohe-

sion, players broke up
into factions with each
intent on blaming the

other for the team’s
troubles. The factionalism
carried over onto the ﬁeld,
as players began to play
for themselves instead of
forthe team.

The result was a 441
loss to Grove City, a l—l
tie with Kent State, a
1—0 shutout by West
Virginia, and a 2-0
whitewash by Bucknell—
all teams with
talent.

Pride took over in the last
two games as the team re-
versed itself to down previous-
ly undefeated Akron 1-0
and arch-rival Penn State by
a 2—0 count. It was too late
to salvage a winning season,
but there was at least some
glory in knowing how good
the team could be when it
played as a unit.

Finally there was a hint
of good things for the future
as the freshman soccer team
compiled an undefeated sea-
son. Even though this record
contained three ties, the
scoring potential the fresh-
men showed could bring an-
other winning season for next
year’s squad. Alas—another
“wait for next year” sport.

 

Cross Country

Never before were distance runners so lonely. There
were only ﬁve of them. just enough to claim the distinc-
tion of being a team.

But they weren’t satisﬁed with just that distinction.

. They had a new coach, Jim Banner, who is seldom
satisﬁed with anything less than perfection. They had a
captain, Frank Handelman, who is seldom satisﬁed with
anything less than total involvement. The lonely ﬁve
made cross-country the year’s only fall sport with a win-
ning record.

‘= Out of 21 teams in the Canisius Invitational Tourna-
J ment, they placed second. In the IC4A climax, they
l ﬁnished near the top.

Handelman broke the home course record by over 20
seconds. Banner said he wasn’t satisﬁed. The next time
out Handelman cut another 12 seconds off the time for
the four-and-one-half mile ordeal.

Banner said that there was at least one team people
could be proud of. There were also ﬁve lonely runners

1 that could be proud.

Basketball

234

It was supposed to be the start of a comeback for the
basketball team. This would be the year when the
team would use its sophomore talent to end the devas-
tating drought of the past two seasons.

Instead of improving, the cagers regressed to their
worst season in history.

They lost 19 games and won only six. Two of the
wins were against Carnegie Tech. The other four
victories were against Westminster, Bucknell, Lafayette,
and the Air Force Academy.

The third straight year of famine made coach Bob
Timmons a center of controversy. Timmons still smiled,
kept losing and complained about the loss of several key
sophomores at the start of the season.

Jim LaValley took the dubious honors of leading the
team in scoring and rebounding.

: Freshman Basketball

236

 

For the freshman basketball team the battle has
ended, but the war is ‘just beginning. Behind them
is a 14—4 record, one of the most successful in
history. On the road ahead is the task of trying to
rescue basketball at Pitt.

This fall frosh coach Tim Grgurich brought in
the biggest group of freshman cagers in history.
Limited to four scholarships, he cornered two mem-
bers of state championship teams, Mike Pateher
and Rob McFarland.

Along with them came Bob Petrini of highly
rated DeMatha Catholic in Washington, D.C. and
Charlie Hunt at 6-foot-7.

The 14 wins set a frosh record and included

Victories over arch-rival Duquesne and top-ranked
Wesley Junior College.

Among the team’s disappointments were two
close losses to West Virginia and an early season
trouncing by Duquesne.

The Eastern Wrestling Tournament (EIWA) climaxes the season for most
wrestling teams in the East. This year’s EIWA was truly a climax for the
matmen. It marked the close of their worst season and the ﬁnal degradation
of a once mighty tradition.

The matmen scored minus two points in the Easterns, ﬁnishing next to last.
Only three wrestlers won their first round matches, and they entered no
heavyweight.

In season competition the wrestlers lost ten, beating only St. Francis and
Franklin and Marshall. Against Navy, Michigan, and Lehigh, they came
within one match of being shut out.

Rival coaches ironically looked toward Pitt for a breather in their harsh
schedules when just three years ago they feared the sight of a Blue and Gold
uniform.

‘ Coach Dave Johnson said the decline rested primarily on the lack of schol-
arships and on his being hired only for part-time work.

239

Gymnastics

There is one consolation for a gymnastics team which had its
worst season. They performed, as usual, before little or no audi-
ence. The gymnasts lost to all seven of their Eastern League op-
ponents, only defeating Cornell and West Virginia.

A common denominator of defeat was the lack of gymnasts per
se. Often the gym team marched forth in full strength of five to seven
performers to face the opposition’s 15 to 20.

Dave Shidlemantle, defending Eastern champion on the long
horse, was injured at the start of the season and never fully recovered.
Jim Sacco, who was to have concentrated in only three events,
ended up competing in nearly twice that many.

Swimming

242

 

 

 

All season long the swimmers
aimed for a winning record only
to lose it in their last meet. Some
stellar individual performers placed
them eighteenth out of 20 teams in
the Easterns. The mermen operated
under new coach Jerry Snyder when
Ben Grady resigned before the season.

John Lane had ll ﬁrsts, back-
stroker Jor LeViere had eight, and
sophomore Howie Norris had a win-
ning streak of eight in the 200-yard
butterﬂy.

 

 

The lack of depth that was so apparent
in the indoor track season carried over
into the outdoor season. Coach Jim Banner
sent individual performers to relay meets
and scheduled only two dual meets.
The tracksters clobbered Wayne State,
1161/2x371/Z, after Navy had out-
classed the thinclads in their first meet,
131~23. Penn State easily won the Big
4 Quadrangle Meet, but the track team
captured second ahead of Syracuse and
West Virginia. At least one half dozen
Pitt records were broken indoors but there
weren’t enough individual standouts such
as Tom Christie and Dave Brinn in the
hurdles, Roger Holly in the half mile,
and Frank Handleman in the distance
races, to win team meets. Banner is in
the process of correcting the situation.
Among the high school track stars he has
recruited is Jerry Richey who has run the
mile in 4:10 which already eclipses the Pitt
record. In addition, Banner has foot-
ballers Dave Garnett and Mike Connell
for the sprints. The depth problem will no
longer be so apparent.

Baseball

At the beginning of the season, coach Bobby Lewis
ﬂatly predicted that his baseball team would go unde-
feated. “I put them on the spot,“ he said. “And under
the conditions, I couldn‘t be more pleased with the
way they played. I‘m as proud of this team as any I've
coached.“ The Panthers won 13 of 16 games and
had ten cancelled or postponed because of rain or wet
grounds. Lewis felt that if his club had been able to
play all the rained out games. it would have been in-
vited to the NCAA playoffs. As it was, the baseball
team was in contention for a bid until it lost a double-
header to Penn State. 3—2 and 3—(). Dave W'elty
emerged as one the nation‘s finest pitchers during the
season. The Panther lefthander had a 6—1 record
and compiled an ERA of 0.32 with 89 strikeouts in
55 innings. Before Penn State scored on him. W'elty
had hurled 44273 innings of shutout ball. Against
Syracuse, Welty highlighted the season with a no-
hitter. He also had the third highest batting average
(.333) on the team. Lewis hopes VVelty will use his
last year of eligibility rather than sign a major league
contract.

   

Golf

248

 

 

 

Perhaps golf coach Rex Peery had the 1966 season in mind when he
forecast “a very long season” for 1967. The golf team had won only three
of 17 matches in ’66 and the year’s top two players had graduated. No
one was more pleased than Peery, however, when the golf team refused
to heed his prophesy. Sophomore Pete Keller, playing number one, proved
to be a pleasant surprise and unexpected help came from transfer student
Rick Golden. After their first four matches, the golfers rallied for a 6—8
record and had their hopes for an even season dashed when Bucknell and
Clarion cancelled matches. “They played steady golf,” said Peery, and his
choice of words was correct. Bill Bryan, Dick Winter, john Dellaverson,
and Bob Racunas shot consistently in the 70’s and low 80’s. The golfers
narrowly missed upsetting Eastern Champion Penn State. Bryan, Winter,
and Golden won their matches, but the Lions hung on to win the last
three pairings and the match, 4~3. Only Winter and Karl Quinn, who
played seventh, will not return next season.

Tennis

With new home courts and a permanent
place to practice, the tennis team enjoyed its
first winning season since 1962. After dropping
three of their ﬁrst four matches, the netmen
strung six consecutive victories to compile a
7—5—1 record. Led by first singles player Bill
Nichols, the tennis team defeated Bethany, 6—3,
in the year’s big upset. Bethay had won 18
straight matches over two seasons of play and
Nichols personally snapped the 37 match skein
of Bethany’s Kirk Hunter. Bill Goldstein com-
bined with Nichols for an 8-3 mark as the num-
ber one doubles team. Goldstein, playing pri-
marily number two in singles competition, posted
a 7—5 record. Nichols’ 9—4 singles mark also
included an upset win over Youngstown’s John
Keil, who had a 16 match winning streak. Erik
Lieberman (8—3), Bob Salembier (7—5), Tom
Stromp (10—2), and Elliot Sainer (5—7) con-
tributed to the successful season. Coach Ben
Pope praised the consistency of the netmen,
adding, “they had spirit from the first match
on.” Pope has everyone except Lieberman back
next season

Do you have white socks, a
brown bag, and a pocketful of
change? If you do, you are a com-
muter. You are one of that rare
breed of person who daily awakens
in the heart of the city or the wilds
of suburbia, hops two or three
buses, and arrives haggered at 7:00
a.m. to seek higher education. You
may also play ring-around-Oak-
land as your used car sputters
past ﬁlled spaces, street-cleaning
signs, and the ever-present meter-
maid. Don’t be disgruntled at your
plight; you are in the majority.
With increased state aid not only
are there more in-state students,
but more native Pittsburghers.
High school chums may no longer
have to say good-bye. Instead they
can venture together to meet the
college challenge in Oakland. In
the past the commuters have been
dispersed in their concerns for stu-
dent activity. They do little as a
group, commuting daily and seek-
ing out their individual interests
as normal students. Despite their
increased numbers, the situation
will never change.

Dear Mr. Fischl:
As a result of your recent campus interview with Mr. Wells, we believe
you have the interests and qualifications to fill a position at Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft. Therefore, we are pleased to offer you employment at
our Connecticut Operations in East Hartford.
Your starting salary will be $735 per month based on a 40-hour work week.
This offer is made contingent upon your satisfactory completion of our
established employment requirements which include a physical examination
and personal security investigation. The offer is also made on the basis
of our understanding that your representation to our interviewer concerning your background is complete and accurate.
Your work will be in the Experimental Engineering Department and will concern
various aspects of development and analysis of flight propulsion systems,
energy conversion systems and power devices. Your assignment to an experimental group will follow a brief orientation program designed to provide
an insight into the over-all engineering operation and to acquaint you w.ith
the specific responsibilities and activities of the Experimiental Engineering
Department.
The programs within Experimental Engineering range in scope from the development of both airbreathing and non-airbreathing power systems to the development and application of highly specialized instrumentation for use in the
development of our products. Airbreathing projects include full-scale development of turbojet and turbofan engines, VTOL (vertical-takeoff-and-landing),
STOL (short-takeoff-and-landing) and supersonic powerplants, as well as
industrial and marine gas turbines. Supporting these efforts are component
development groups which carry on work on compressors, burners, turbines,
bearings and seals, afterburners, fuel systems, etc.
Non-airbreathing projects are directed toward the development of energy conversion systems in the fields of thermionics, thermoelectronics, and fuel
cells. Project responsibilities include development of hardware and associated ground support eqaipment for specific applications, such as the fuel
cell systems for the Apollo program. To support these efforts, groups are
involved in studies of a more general nature, such as in the fields of
thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, controls, advanced materials and structures.

After the two-and one-half to four
years it has taken to fulfill graduation
requirements, a student may give some
thought to what his education has been.
To some, the years have been a means
to achieve social respectability or the
promise of success in a career. To others,
formal education has been like crawling
from a funnel, each course raising new
questions and doubts. These people ﬁnd
that their cocksure ignorance at the
beginning has changed to a thoughtful
uncertainty by graduation. Now the
senior looks forward to a job or contin-
ued studies, that which challenges his

abilities, or insures a good salary or
both.

President of Student Government Ralph Manning received the
highest recognition for a senior man in the area of leadership by
being named the ODK Man of the Year.

Mr. Manning was a chemical engineering major with an honor
grade point average. A member of Sigma Tau honorary and presi-
dent of Omega Chi Epsilon honorary, he was also a member of the
Engineer’s Society and the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers. He represented the chemical engineers on the Engi-
neering and Mines Cabinet and was a member of the Allocations
Committee and Chairman ofthe 1965 Engineers’ Week.

As Vice-President of Sigma Chi fraternity, Mr. Manning par-
ticipated in interfraternity sports. He served as Vice-President of
ODK and of the Pennsylvania Association of College Students.

258

Mr. and Miss Pitt

William Cabin and Dina Natali were selected as Mr. and Miss
Pitt by a committee of prominent juniors who chose them on the
basis of their contributions to the University.

Miss Natali was vice-president of AWS and chairwoman of
Women’s Housing Board. A mentor and a senior assistant, she
also served as president of McCormick Halland as a Student Gov-
ernment senator. Other activities include being a member of the
Student Affairs Advisory Committee and Delta Delta Delta
Sorority. She was also the recipient of the Italian Room Schol-
arship for European study. _

Mr. Cabin served as business manager and literary editor of the
OWL and editor of the Pitt News. He was president of ODK
and Pi Delta Epsilon. A member of the Liberal Arts Cabinet and
the Student Allocations Committee, he also served on the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee and the Student Publications Board.

259

The 1967 Owl Hall of Fame

Education at Pitt is not limited to the
classroom. It is also the participation in a
University community which is as diverse
as the people who compose it. Each year the
Owl Hall of Fame recognizes those senior
men and women who have made the greatest
contribution to this community. Students are
chosen from every area of campus activity,
from publications to athletics. Selection is
made by a committee of junior class leaders
who themselves represent the broadest areas
of student life. While scholarship is a factor,
it is not emphasized. The most important
criteria is not how many organizations the
senior has been a member of, but how worth-
while his contributions have been.

Between 5:00-6:00 p.m. daily a huge herd arises from
nowhere to clog the main artery. There are neither pass-
ports nor visas required. To pass through this human mass
one must either push, shove, kick, or yell his way through or
simply not enter the towers dorms. Dorm students cluster
around their home base only at selected times. Besides the
dinner hour seance there is the late evening deluge at the
snack bar. Otherwise the male dorms are merely stop-overs
in the harried life of the -maturing young adult. Women
follow a similar course with most of their time spent dating,
meandering through the quad, or idly window-shopping the
small array of Oakland stores. Ironically many dorm students
spend much time avoiding living and eating in the towers.
They frequent the inexpensive dining halls lining Forbes
Avenue and usually weekend in the rooms of friends in
Shadyside or South Oakland.

There were the masses and the individuals. The noise
and the quiet. There was solitary study and crowded
cram sessions. The meaning and the nonsense. There
was bad food and good company. A lonely walk up the
hill on to the library. There was waiting for books and

crowded elevators and corrected invoices. Experiments
worked and failed. Classes were attended and Cut. There
were good and bad decisions, strong and weak opinions.
There were the places that remained after the people had
left.

The annual apartment-hunting ritual occurs from April to August.
Students swarm throughout the honeycomb of narrow streets and alleys
of Oakland. Middle-aged landladies clad in aprons and house frocks
grudgingly greet exploring students. The rookie ﬁnds the experience
romantic and exciting. The experienced upperclassman ﬁnds it a taxing
chore. His only compensation is not having to live and eat in the Towers.
The hunter’s goal is a nicely-furnished room, good studying atmosphere,
and reasonable rent. Instead the average student ﬁnds some little hole-
in-the-wall, aged furniture, and the sounds and odors of Oakland bars
and cafes. Foreign and women students meet most difﬁculty. Many
foreigners are spurned immediately by Oakland’s real estate elite. Even
when accompanied by American roommates, landlords are hesitant to
rent respectable quarters. Women recently given greater off-campus
privileges by the University ﬁnd few accommodations designed with the
woman in mind. For the well-to-do students there is always the pseudo-
bachelor pad in Shadyside or in Oakland’s periphery. Regardless of the
calibre of the apartment or the student the off-campus life offers the aura
of intriguing independence sought by many students.

The common, culturally-unaware man thinks in stereo-
types. It simpliﬁes reality for him. Everything ﬁts into its
category in a particular time and place. Anything different
can only be seen as deviant, bad and potentially destruc-
tive to his good life. It is to the common man, wherever he
may be, that we dedicate an essay on types around
campus.

A puff of smoke, a sip of coke, and a bit of idle gossip all put together equal a
greek. The greek does not at all resemble those greeks living in the Age of Pericles.
He is a cool man dressed in the latest fashion with his symbol of brotherhood
displayed on a ring,jacket, tee-shirt or hanging from a bulletin board, a tuck shop
wall, or a female’s neck. He has vast academic resources which have been
accumulated by the blood, sweat and ingenuity of his brothers. He spends most
of his time at the house, the tuck shop orjust plain bopping around. He is almost
a perfect man. There is only one tragic flaw. He occassionally goes to class.

As the editor of the yearbook you don’t edit the book—you
live it. It becomes a part of you. It becomes an expression of
your thoughts, your sensitivities, your prejudices. You publish
the book for yourself rather than for the students. You com-
plain about the work, all the while hoarding as much as you
can for yourself—only handing out assignments when time or
exhaustion will not permit your personal attention to the
myriad of details comprising the production of a yearbook. You
are impatient with staff members who must rearrange their
schedules to help an irritant editor meeting deadline.

But in the end you are grateful to the people who put up
with you, those who came up to the office early and stayed
late, the people who made the book a reality. And so it is
with me. It is to these people, those who shared in this year-
book, that I owe a great debt of gratitude: Pat, for her great
organizing of the literary staff and her moral support through-
out the year; Tom, who amid cries of “Stop the Bomb!” man-
aged to gather together a photo staff that turned in the best
pictures the book has ever had to work with; Bill, for taking
over the business staff and for his dynamic copy in the intro-
ductory essay of the book; Bruce, who was a one-man pro-
duction staff during the ﬁnal deadline and without whom this
book would not have been ﬁnished on time (or almost on
time); Marsha, Carole, Kathy, and Carolyn—my last minute
“slave labor gang”, who were there for the “last day” and
many before that; Susan, for handling the institute and the
banquet as well as the production; and to john, Nancy, Tom
Sacks, jay, Dave and the rest of the photography staff, Mary
Carol, Jo Carol, Gerri, and to the others who have helped
make this the great book I know it will be.

Finally, a special thanks should go to Larry Pirnie for
giving the book a new dimension of thinking and for his
tireless help with production during those final days. Also I
would like to thank Mr. Irving Lloyd and Mr. Allan Shane
for their greatjob on photography as well as Mrs. Esther Kitzes
for being there to help in our minor emergencies when they
would come up.

I have gained a great deal from the OWL, not only this
year but in the previous years that I worked. The book has
made this the best of my four years at the University of Pitts-
burgh and it will be a part of me forever. Good luck to Pat and
the 1968 staff. Thank you all again.

I am tall, dark and handsome. I have
bulging muscles and do my exercises daily.
I have a letter, a numeral, and a stun-
ning wardrobe of sweat pants and tee-
shirts. My 124 credits are a drag and I
care for nothing more than a C. Some
professors will let me by because I have
bulging muscles. Girls drop at me when
they realize I am ajock.

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

Beats. That’s what they call us. We
let our hair down most of the time. Our
clothes are different, some army surplus
garb, some worn out khakis or jeans,
and an assortment of earrings, sandals,
boots, and wrinkled shirts. We think a lot.
Sometimes there seems like there is no
direction, but we know we are meandering
somewhere into the future.

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

Most students consider themselves
members of the mass regardless of their
stereotyped role. Just as the average American
citizen considers himself the common man of
the middle class so the student sees himself

as the mean product of all adolescents going

to college. The mass usually takes the form

of a band of students who are basically
disconcerned with everything except getting
out of school. They rarely voice an opinion

in University affairs unless it effects tuition.
They will continually chastize the Pitt News
for poor coverage or the Student Union Board
for inadequate entertainment, but rarely

offer an alternative. In essence the mass are
those people in the majority who go to school
by necessity and seek personal pleasure the
rest of the time.

Student Government elections were
like one majorette passing a baton to
the next. Ken Frederick, of the Associa-
tion for Responsible Action, succeeded
Ralph Manning. Manning had avidly
backed Frederick against previous loser
john Ruskay of the Pitt Progressive
Party Plus. Manning and Frederick
had much in common. Both were engi-
neers with relatively high quality point
averages. Both had extended their edu-
cation to the full ﬁve years allowed in
the engineering curriculum. Both were
native Pittsburghers. Despite an amal-
gam of students from diverse areas, Rus-
kay could not shed the old “greenbagger”
image he had acquired two years ago as
an SG Senator. Both the PPP and ARA
platforms and campaign rhetoric were
similar and the loss was once again
attributed to a heavy engineering bloc
for ARA. The new PPP plus senatorial
slate faired well with the ARA, but
neither Ruskay nor his running mate
Terry Hyman could buck the new image.

There are seven wonders in the
world, but to students none can exceed
in splendor the two at Pitt. The Com-
mons Room will always symbolize
the monumental architecture of the
Cathedral. Its rising columns and inter-
locking supports seem to endlessly ﬂow
above the Commons Room. As the
largest non-library studying area for
students the room will be remembered
for its cold, foot-worn ﬂoors, hard wood
chairs, etched desk tops, and poor light-
ing.

The Cathedral Lawn in all its sparcity
is the second wonder. In the summer
and fall its a study lounge or football
ﬁeld, in the winter a miniature Alaska,
and continually a place for a calm
evening togetherAexcept for the campus
police.

Two ﬁgures stroll hand-in-hand their hips
swaying in perfect rhythm and a perfect os-
mosis of thought ﬂowing between their minds.
Destination seemingly means nothing for the
two are with each other. They may prome-
nade around the Cathedral lawn, lounge in
the Student Union, or innocently talk in the
Towers lobby. As they walk through a crowd
they are often oblivious to all except them-
selves. Occasionally they stop in on the rest
of the world by going to classes, a football
game, or dance. Most of the time they are
the world to each other and school is just a
passing stage.

THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
Earl Fischl, Editor
Cold, hard, calculating, mean, sarcastic. impolite. These
adjectives could describe a person, but they don’t. They
personify snow which continually pervades the Pitt campus.
Although it need not literally be there, snow is ﬁguratively
present all the time. Its form is concrete. .\Iost colleges are
pictured as neat little havens of higher learning tucked in
the green hilled valleys of the country. In the age of modern
science Pitt represents the growing urban university. Its

  

most precious and seemingly least guarded non-human com-
modity is grass. \'Vhen the few blades around the Cathedral
are not hidden by snow they are made totally subservient
to sidewalks and streets. In the summer of 1967, further
encroachments were made on the Cathedral lawn to stop
people from walking on the grass. Most assuredly the new
paths will be by-passed since students seek the joy of mean-
dering through the few bits of greenery.

There is not apathy per se at Pitt. People here are
individuals with their own priorities. Some come here
for an academic education. They get tapped to Phi Eta
Sigma, Phi Beta Kappa, and graduate with honors.
Some come here for sports. They outﬁt themselves in
tee-shirts and sweat pants, develop their physical
prowess, get lettered jackets, and pick up a bachelor’s
degree on the side. Others come here for social reasons.
They satisfy their parents, dress in the latest college fads
from ivy to hippie styles and just have fun. These people
are not apathetic. They are concerned with themselves.
They go where they want to go and do what they want
to do with whomever they please. The only thing all
have in common is being a student at Pitt. Being a stu-
dent, however, does not entail for each the obligation of
becoming involved in the school for the school’s bene-
ﬁt. For those who enjoy such activities apathy still
exists in being unable to sympathize with the desires of
others. For those who care little for the good and wel-
fare of Pitt, apathy exists similarly.

Even the least industrious
student complains about
libraries. They are stuffy,
poorly-lighted. uncomfort-
able, and have too strict
rules for talking. To the
industrious student the li-
brary is primarily poor’
supplied with books in his
Held and is not open suf-
ficient hours. Hillman li-
brary opening in Fall

, is to alleviate that
problem. Unfortunately
when the building designs
were made ten years ago it
was with knowledge that
Hillman would be inade-
quate. Spacewise there will
not be suflicient room to
keep pace with the plethora
of literature. The lighting
and interior will doubtless
be more pleasant, but hours
have not yet been altered
and there will still be the
usual prohibitions.

Rub your eyes. You are in Oakland.
Check your pockets for (limes and
nickels.

Fasten your seat belt. Pray.

“Did you go to school this summer?” “I don’t know.
Do you mean the Spring trimester, the summer ses-
sion, or the spring session?”

Such is the typical conversation as the trimester
system hangs in precarious balance. Since the increased
state-related status of Pitt, University ofhcials have
been debating the merits of academic calendars—the
semester, the trimester, or quarter system. The summer
of ’67 was to be a last test for the trimester. At the
end of the summer experiment, Dr. W. George
Crouch secretary of the University, repeated that the
trimester system is still under intensive review.

A soft breeze vainly tries to break the hot, humid crust
covering the evening. Sounds of cars occasionally pierce
the heavy atmosphere. It is 9:00 p.m. Suddenly the clanging
of ﬁre engines disrupts the solitude. Five engines come
, barrelling into the Towers Dormitory garage. Students
spontaneously emerge from every nook and cranny to con-
verge on the Forbes Avenue patio. Windows open through-
out the dorms and youthful calls rain down on the civic
servants. Shouts are joined by a Hurry of water balloons.
Firemen are joined by police and canines as the crowd
swells. The false ﬁre alarm no longer matters as the swelling
crowd begins its amoeba-like motions. Through the Towers,
on to Fifth Avenue, and cascading a stream of sitting bodies
on to the street. Police chase fragments of the nearly
2,000 persons massing in slapstick fashion to the Quad-
rangle, on to the Boulevard, around the Student Union,

and back to the Towers. A harried Dean of Men Herbert

McGibbeny admonishes students in the quad as panties and
water balloons fall like confetti. Pittsburgh Police Superin-
tendent James Slusser, adorned in a blazing red ban-long
shirt, khaki pants, and green gym shoes, bravely thrusts
across Forbes with megaphone. Alas the saviour comes.
Chancellor Kurtzman gathers the crowd on the Towers
patio and asks the students to consider the University’s repu-
tation. He speaks in an understanding tone, occasionally
dodging water balloons and rolls of toilet paper, and offers
to have air conditioning turned on as soon as possible. After
he enters the dorms for a summit with the police; chairs,
toilet paper, and sundry items continue to cascade onto stu-
dents. About 1:30 a.m. the movements cease. All is quiet
and Pitt has had its historic summer riot.

Orientation

For the upperclassman who braves the sum-
mer heat to study during the third trimester,
Orientation means eight three-day sessions of
freshmen flooding the cafeteria, asking thousands
of questions about courses, housing regulations
or social life, and gazing at them with the ad-
miration that is due upperclassmen. In the eyes
of freshmen the three days of testing, speeches,
luncheons, swimming parties, boatrides. and
advisor’s appointments are exciting but frighten-
ing. Administration, faculty and students spend
many hours preparing long speeches to enlighten
the newcomers and freshmen glow as a multitude
of University personnel report the average CEEB
scores, the range of high school activities and
other vital statistics of the incoming class. i\1ean—
while, after the stirring speeches, these novices
complain of broken elevators, women’s curfews,
closed courses, and poor food, little realizing that
this is their true orientation to everyday Univer-

sity life.

62

The Commons Room becomes a new world when it is lighted
only by the candles carried by freshman women. Led by their
mentors, upperclass women with whom they meet once a week,
the freshman encircle the Commons Room to receive light for
their candles from the Shrine of Truth. They are presented by the
ﬁgure of Father Pitt to Alma Mater dressed in white and ﬂanked
by Truth and Valor.

63

Lantern Night

 

Parents Weekend is an annual event held
to acquaint the parents of Pitt students with
the University. Sponsored by Student Gov-
ernment, the weekend schedule includes a
reception with the Chancellor, a panel dis-
cussion (on campus and general collegiate
concerns), and a football game. Although not
included in the University planned agenda,
major unannounced features of the visit from
home are free meals away from the cafeteria,
ﬁnancial transfusions, shopping trips with
the charge account, and First option on the
family car for the Saturday night date.

Football Weekend

Fall is the season for most typically collegiate activities-
bonﬁres, football games, rum and coke, victory parties,
banner-painting parties, we-lost-another-one parties. Spirit,
school or otherwise, provides Pitt students with the energy
to attend both the games and the weekly pep rallies. Being
an urban school, the University has few facilities for such
student demonstrations, so students improvise by using city
streets. More attention centers on stopping long strings of
street cars, than on cheering, but then this is an urban Uni-
versity with the spirit, school or otherwise, and facilities
in the form of city streets.

The U.S. should be in Vietnam; the U.S. should not be
in Vietnam; Students are more intellectual in college than
later on; many intelligent students do not belong in college;
Shapp for governor; Shafer for governor; the civil rights
movement has gone far and will go farther; black people need
black power. Standing room only crowds entranced by the
speaker to sparse groups of students passing out leaﬂets
heard a wide variety of opinions from lecturers in the Stu-
dent Union Board Public Affairs series.

Stokely Carmichael director of SNCC advocated a greater
organization of Negroes to achieve their goals through black
power. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. told a crowd which
spilled into the SU lobby and marble lounge that there was
still much to be done in the area of civil rights.

The right, left and middle of Vietnam were summarized

pino; and Asian expert, Bernard Fall. Sen. Morse feared the
escalation of the Vietnam conflict into an all Asian war and
questioned the right of the U.S. “to decree there should be
two governments in Vietnam.” Dr. Scalapino dismissed most
of the arguments against U.S. involvement to the satisfaction
of some and the anger of others. Dr. Fall, who was later
killed in Vietnam, traced the crisis from the 1954 French
defeat to the present “wildﬁre guerilla movements” and
questioned if there were indeed a way out.

Other issues were discussed as well. Edward Albee stressed
that university theaters are on a higher level than the Broad-
way stage which produces “Any Wednesday” and “The
Sound of Music.”

Sociologist Paul Goodman asserted that many of the
brighter students do not learn by being forced to go to class
but from extracurricular activities where they learn a skill
such as writing and are forced to accept responsiblity. The
reasons for attending college of 30 to 40 per cent of the stu-
dents in universities are not good enough he decided.

Former Prime Minister of Hungary, Fereve Nagy con-
sidered the effects of Red China, the Hungarian Revolution
and Vietnam on Eastern Europe. Englishman Quentin
Keynes discussed apartheid in South Africa.

Politics not being slighted, candidates Raymond Shafer
and Milton Shapp culled votes from students in separate
speeches.

Unlike the past, this year Pitt drew a top bill of entertainers. The year
began with a concert by the Back Porch lVlajority. This group had
appeared at Pitt the previous winter and had been such a sensation that
SUB invited them back for a return engagement. Homecoming was a
success with Dick Gregory and the voices of Simon and Garfunkel.
In January, SUB once again sponsored a free concert, this time with The

Four Seasons. For Winter Weekend, the ﬁrst week in February, Pitt
was introduced to the soul sound of the Tempting Temptations at one
of the most well-received concerts of the year. For another shift in
mood, The Lettermen performed for the First MDC weekend at the end
of the same month. The year closed with the Serendipity Singers in
concert for Engineers’ Week.

Derby Day

Sigma Chi Derby Day
was held for the ﬁrst time
on Pitt’s campus this year,
much to the dismay of many
administrators and frater-
nity men. The day of fun
and games was preceded by
a hectic publicity contest
which saw sorority women
sustain scraped knees and
bruised bank accounts to
further the names of both
their sorority and of Sigma
Chi. Kappa Kappa Gamma
gained the distinction of
amassing the most points
in the games and publicity
while Elaina Katz was
named Sigma Chi Derby
Darling of 1966.

Homecoming

  

Despite bitter cold temperatures, Pitt alumni braved the
elements to attend the 1966 Homecoming game, only to see
Pitt lose to their classic rival Penn State. Many shivered
through the afternoon only to remember the college days
of their youth, some to watch the colorful parade of
mini-ﬂoats and Homecoming Queen, while others looked
forward to the after-the-game open houses where old
friends would laugh over a drink. For Pitt students the
freezing cold and the unfavorable score offered reasons for
emptying the ﬂask early, or leaving early to watch Notre
Dame and Michigan State on television.

jammed by the students.

 

 

Winter Weekend

The “Psychedelic” theme of this year’s
Winter Weekend was best presented on
Thursday night’s concert in Syria Mosque
on February 2. A performance by the
Temptations had the audience literally
dancing in the aisles.

The Carnival on Friday night had the
usual Chi Omega slave girl sale and Zeta
Beta Tau brother dunking.

Saturday climaxed the weekend with a
continuous showing of experimental ﬁlms
in Clapp Hall. A fast band, Cardil and the
Zylums, and a slow one, Joe Westray’s
Band, entertained at the Saturday dance.

An innovation in the weekend was an
op art contest. The paintings of the ﬁve
winners were exhibited in the Student
Union.

Sue Moudy and Jim Flannigan, queen
and king of Winter Weekend, were
crowned at the concert.

MDC Weekend

Men’s Dormitory Council
made an effort this year to give
the dorm residents a weekend
set aside for them much as Engi-
neer’s Week and Greek Week
are planned to unify their
bodies. Following the same
basic set-up as other weekends,
a Fun Night was held at the
ﬁeld house, Thursday night, A
Dinner-Dance in the Tower’s
Cafeteria occupied the dorm
residents on Friday night, and
the Lettermen performed in
Concert Saturday night. The
fun night included wheel-
barrow races, three legged races
and passing-oranges-under the
chin races. Distinguishing the
game night from those of other
weekends were Barber Shop
Quartet performances from each
house.

MDC topped its weekend
with a standing room only
concert in Carnegie Music Hall.

Dorm trophies were awarded
banners for the Penn State
basketball game and for
spirit exhibited during the
Weekend and especially at the
game.

Roaring Twenties, House of
Lords, and Playboy’s Penthouse
placed first, second and third
respectively on overall points
for the weekend.

Greek Week

After weeks of planning and headaches Greeks let loose to
enjoy the 1967 Greek Week. Banners lined the Towers’ lob-
by to publicize the theme of “Color Us Greek” long before
the first event in which the chariot race down Bigelow
Boulevard took place despite a cold rain. Greeks proved or
disproved their agility during the Fun Night proceedings in
the ﬁeld house. On Wednesday night, fraternity men and
women dressed as gypsies, music box ballerinas, sailors, and

89

soldiers performed in the marathon Greek Sing during which
Judy Martin was crowned as Greek Week queen: In a re-
versed schedule the formal dance was held at Churchill Val-
ley Country Club on Friday night and the concert featuring
The We Five and Astrud Gilberto, was held Saturday night
at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial. Kappa Alpha Theta and
Zeta Beta Tau captured trophies for the overall competition.

Although the City of the future was the
theme of this year’s Engineer’s Week, the
proceedings of the week were very down
to earth. St. Patrick arrived with his Delta 1
Zeta harem after the traditional march l

of the engineers from Engineering Hall to

the Student Union. Five Legged Races l
were the highlight of the Gimmick kept
well hidden behind Engineering Hall.

Additional entertainment was provided at
the traditional Shamrock Ball at (lhurchill

VValt Harper Quintet. The major innovation
in Engineers \/Veek was a school-wide eon-
cert Saturday night by the Serendipity Singers
in Soldiers and Sailors memorial.
