RUTH ANDERSON

To be Senior Queen is the greatest honor that may come to a
woman at the University of Pittsburgh. She is chosen each
year by the women who know her best, her own classmates,
for the contribution she has made by her personality, her
character, her academic achievement, her social qualities, and
her qualities of leadership in making the University a greater
factor in the community. It is she whom the women of the
Senior Class consider to be most representative.

The trend of educatio11 in recent years has been toward the
application of theory, the exercise of principle. The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh has particularly emphasized the need for a
uniting of the academic studies of the lecture hall, the re-
search of the library, the experiments of the laboratory with
the vocational and avocational interests of college students.
From Trees Gymnasium to the stadium to Heinz House to
the Y Hut and down to the Cathedral, eager groups of stu-
dents gather to work together in special ﬁelds. W.A.A. holds
a swimming party. Shouts and laughter echo against the
tiled walls. Husky chorines shake the Y Hut ﬂoor in prepa-
ration for the Cap and Gown show. The do re mi's of the
Men’s Glee Club ring through the lower ﬂoors of the Cathe-
dral, while on the 7th ﬂoor, the staff of the Pin‘ News puts
the Wednesday issue to bed. On Wednesday evenings, above
the Fifth Avenue street lights, Quill members listen to future
Byrons and Austens read their work. Race, schools, fraterni-
ties are forgotten, as those with congenial interests plan to-
gether, test out the ideas given in the classroom, blend the
university into a uniﬁed yet heterogenous community in
touch with the realities of society as a whole.

Student Faculty Association

 

WILLIAM HARVEY

The Student Faculty Association was
formed in the spring of 1934 when a gen-
eral campus referendum approved the
adoption of the newly formed by-laws to
supplant the previous Student Council or-
ganization. The Association, as it is at
present constituted, includes all those stu-
dents registered in the College, the Schools
of Business Administration, Dentistry,
Education, Engineering and Mines, and
their respective faculty members. The pur-
pose of the Association as expressed in the
by—laws is, “To provide additional ways
by which faculty and students may work
together on common problems and
through these joint activities enrich fur-
ther the collective life as well as the life
of the individual at the University."

The governing body of the Association,
which is known as the University Assem-
bly, is composed of forty members——thirty
students and ten faculty members. The As-
sembly is charged with the enforcement of
rules and regulations governing under-
graduate social affairs, the admission of
new organizations, and the regulation of

110

existing organizations and of general
campus activities.

The Executive Committee, composed of
the Chancellor, the Deans of Men and
Women, and six students elected by the
Assembly, is the centralizing force in the
government of the Association. In the As-
sociation's first year of organization, no
division between men and women repre-
sentatives was made. This resulted in a
situation wherein the women of the Uni-
versity were greatly under—represented.
This year a change has been inaugurated
which requires that ten of the Assembly
seats be reserved to women. Two of the
six places on the executive committee are
allotted to the women, one of whom must
be a Senior woman. This reallotment of
representatives both in the Assembly and
in the Executive Committee has done much
to give the coeds an equal voice in the de-
termination of the policy of the Associa-
tion.

During this, its second year on the cam-
pus, the Assembly has endeavored to direct
its powers, both executive and legislative,
into channels which might lead to a high-
er realization of the signiﬁcance of student
life. A Men's Council for the purpose of
administering affairs pertaining strictly to
men students has been organized and will
be ready to function next year. An exten-
sive survey of ﬁfth hour classes was made
in the hope that they might be reduced to
a minimum. Further research has been
made into the problems of student trans-
portation rates, a student cafeteria, a stu-
dent post oﬂice, discussion forums, and a
news—reel theater. Freshmen customs for
men were revived this year under the direc-
tion of the S.F.A.; next year the program
will be the major undertaking of the Men's
Council.

The Assembly has been concerned also
with clarifying its powers and with dele-
gating authority to various sub—commit-
tees. In this, it was guided greatly by the
precedent set by the Assembly of the previ-
ous year.

Unlike its name, W.S.G.A.'s purpose is not one
for governing and controlling the conduct of the
women students, but for promoting Pitt Spirit
through its many ﬁelds of activities. Its numerous
committees adequately manage its many affairs,
from 3, Cathedral library to housing for out of town
students. A very important work is in connection
with Freshmen women, for to W.S.G.A. goes the
credit for many University traditions—Lantern

112

Night, the Senior Coronation, Women's Day, and
customs for the new-comers. Its Leader’s Institute
is just one of the many opportunities for women to
become affiliated with a campus organization, and
serves as a means of contacting the women on
campus who are not active. Thus, its real function
is one of coordination of all organized activities
of women, together with fostering a spiritf‘_of
loyalty to the University.

Young Women’s Christian Association

Women at the University find in the work of the
Young Women's Christian Association an oppor-
tunity to enrich their lives through participation
in human relation projects, student faculty work,
inquiry forums, and social affairs, for all their
activity emphasizes the relationship of social,
political, and economic factors in the present day

freshmen are welcomed by the Y.W.C.A. at the
traditional Hearth Ceremony, through the whole
year, their program forms a vital part of campus
life. The annual retreat, the banquet, and their
devotional services are just three of the events
which increase the organization’s prestige and
usefulness, and helps in the fulﬁllment of its

religion. From the ﬁrst month of school, when purpose.

  FOREWORD

We have tried,—wep seniors,—to make the 1936 OWI_,
—an autobiography of our four years at the University,
—but more than that a memorial to the Institution
which has anticipated our responsibilities and prepared
us to meet them, a tribute to the many fine men and
Women of the faculty and administration who have
guided and inspired us. We hope the pages of our
book Will be as varied and as rich in interest as have
our activities. Although one of the most important
aspects of our college career has been our studies, we
have not dwelt isolated in an arid academic atmosphere.
Working together, playing together, studying together,
we have tasted the fruits of success which ripen on
the tree of cooperation. May we continue to build
together, as we go our separate yet coalescent ways,
with the spirit of oneness the university instilled in

us. Society has tried competition, let us try cooperation.

Young Men’s Christian Association

The aim of the Young l\/ien's Christian Associa-
tion is to provide an opportunity for all to derive
beneﬁts from University life which other collegiate
experiences do not provide. It is the largest and
most active organization on campus; furthermore
every student who finds the purpose congenial is
welcome into irembership—regardless of race,
creed or color. The Y. M. C. A. has no deﬁnite

program. Whatever its members find helps meet
their own needs, interests, and problems, becomes
the Y. program. Tnere are over forty projects of
varied nature. Through this extensive range of ac-
tivities the Young Men's Christian Association
proposes to aid men to discover and accept the full
meaning OfC7r1ristian living.

Panhellenic Council, although it has set up cooperation among the groups, both as friends and
regulations governing the system of formal rushing, as riendly rivals; to help each organization to

restrictions on the informal rushing period, and
speciﬁed rules for the interfraternity sing, serves
another urpose besides that of Watch—dog over the
fraternities.

It has endeavored to create a better spirit of

116

solve its Own problems, internal as well as external,
by suggesting remedies proposed in open discussion
in the Council meetings themselves; and to sponsor
social functions which tend to promote inter-
fraternity goodwill and association.

The Women's Athletic Association in-
cludes not only those women who are
vitally interested in athletics as a pro-
fession, but those who find in its various
sports activities the recreation that is
necessary for a properly balanced campus
life. Their program consists of sports
divided according to the seasons, the
annual Co—ed Prom-~a part of the fresh-
men entertainment, weel<—ends for the
members at Camp Kon—O—Kwee, and their
popular W.A.A. Cabaret, which women
from all classes are sure to attend. The
fact that most of their activities are in-
formal and not restricted enables them to
plan a more widely diversiﬁed program,

and to arrange it for the convenience of
most of its members. This year, swimming
hours were arranged at the Y.M.H.A., in
order to avoid the long trek up the hill;
and when the snow was at its best, their
sleigh ride provided novel, never—t0-be-
forgotten fun.

Such. an organization, founded with the
two—fold purpose of fostering clean sports-
manship and promoting higher physical
efficiency, Certainly fills its place on the
University campus as one of the major
organizations for women—~broad in its
scope, and capable of meeting the needs of
hundreds of women who find in its activi-
ties the real college spirit.

The Pitt News

RecoTd""i‘5i15'

Each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
morning every University student pauses
on his way to classes to pick up a copy of
the Pitt Neu/.r. He may snatch a glance at
its headlines when the professor isn't look-
ing, he may read at lunch hour the items
pertaining to his particular group, or he
may carry the paper along until he has
been able to give it a thorough going—over.

No matter what degree of attention the
reader may pay to this oﬂicial student pub-
lication of the University, he is not likely
to realize the duties and the pleasures of
those whose efforts make the paper pos-
sible. From editors to cub reporters, the
members of this staff become something of
ex—oﬂicio members of every activity, club,
or group on campus. Their work some-
times becomes a joy, sometimes a grind.
But they do it with a will and a persist-
ency; the scope of time spent at their duties
would approximate that spent in practice
by an athlete who participated in football,
basketball, and track.

It mmu‘, Group: mm ,

124

 
    

Three days a week they work in their
office, gathering and writing up material,
reading and headlining copy, and often

eating grilled cheese sandwiches. Three
other days of the week several members of
the staff adjourn to the print shop, where
they check proofs, make up pages, and
amuse the printers by spilling type.

Highlights of the paper's activity the
past year include scooping the city with a
complete story of the chemistry lab ﬁre,
playing host to the Intercollegiate News-
paper Association Convention, sponsoring
a highly successful track meet for the bene-
fit of the Olympic Fund, and presenting
two style shows and tea dances for wall-
bulging crowds of students. V

The paper this year caused no riots,
suffered no suppression, and incurred no
one's dismissal from school. Otherwise it
ranked among the leading college papers

The Owl

The OWL, the Senior year book of the
University, makes its appearance once a
year. All those Seniors who subscribe to
the OWL have their picture and a record of
their undergraduate activities listed in our
publication. That is why it is a Senior
book, for from that section on, the OWL
attempts to record in half-tones and print
the life of the Campus . . . from the scope
of work of the Student-Faculty Associa-
tion to What transpired at the Freshman
Dance. Not only are formal group pictures
and write-ups included, but there are also
side-lights of Spring Festival, of tap days,
of reading by candle light during the ﬂood.
All these things taken together are meant
to help recall in full the entire picture of

.what life at our University means to the

Pitt Student.

126

 

We have tried this year to instill into
our book more than ever before the life
and spirit of our school. We have tried to
vary the pages and break away from estab-
lished layouts. Perhaps it seems the same,
but then, have you ever tried to see how
many ways there are to arrange a picture,
lists of names, a write—up, and maybe a
key on a 9 by 12 page? If in later years,
you happen to pick up the OwL and glanc-
ing through its pages remember from our
pictures the fun you had in Chem lab; or
the grand time you had at the Junior Prom
with the cute blond freshman; or the times
you would cut classes in order to sit on
Alumni Hall landing just to talk; or the
ﬂood and consequent jaunts up and down
fourteen ﬂoors of the Cathedral . . . then
we Will feel that the OWL has done just
what We wanted it to do.

The Pitt Panther

H». ma-us

For quite a number of years now—
twenty—three to be exact—the students on
the Pitt campus (also friends and relatives)
have enjoyed reading the Panther for its
humor. It has been estimated by persons
with no authority whatsoever that quite
a large number of people have actually
laughed at Panther highlights during that
time. With all due modesty, we are not
the ones to doubt the integrity of these
gentlemen. A list of our former contribu-
tors stands as pretty good evidence for this
assurance.

Perhaps the most outstanding of the
former Panther contributors is a gentleman
by the name of Hervey Allen, author of
Anthony Aelverxe. And he is but one of many
who have attained varying degrees of suc-
cess in the fields of literature, business,
advertising, and art.

Thus it is with pardonable pride we
point out the fact that, contrary to public
opinion, not all contributors to college
comics are hustled away, at an early age,
to sanatoriums. This calls to mind a cer-

tain exchange joke which has been mak-
ing the rounds of the different college
magazines. It goes something like this:

He: “I wrote mother and told her I'm
working my way through college
by tending bar in a saloon.”

She: “Yeah? And what do you really
do?"

He: “I don't want mom to know it
but (in a whisper) I’m really editor
of the college comic!"

The folks whose pictures appear in the
accompanying photographs are here to
testify that they are not afraid to let their
mothers know they are members of the
Panther staffs.

The Panther appeared on the campus ten
times during the present scholastic year.
Its special issues included the Christmas
Number, the Military Ball Number, and
the Cap 8: Gown Number. And, may we
add that not a single issue was delayed by
the ﬂood, which is more than a certain
other publication can say.

Debating for women at the University covers
much more than the mere organization of a Varsity
debate squad, for the number of members is not
limited nor is the selection of a team permanent.
The formal debating with various schools in the
country was divided this year into three trips—~one
to Washington, another to Penn State, and the third

to Ohio, while the wide ﬁeld Of extension debating
and discussion before the many clubs of the city
and suburbs was by no means a secondary part of
the year's program. In actual campus work, the
debating association is known for its panel dis-
cussions of current questions and for its entertain-
ment of freshmen at the annual Beaux Arts.

To those students interested in economic, social
and political questions the Men's Debating Asso-
ciation affords the opportunity to organize their
thinking and to develop effective public speaking
ability. Each year the Association selects two or
three current controversial problems and various
squad members then investigate these problems and
prepare adequate expositions of them. Teams then

131

engage in a Widely extended debating program be-
fore leagues of women Voters, business men's clubs,
and many other local organizations; they make a
series of intercollegiate forensic tours through the
Southern, Eastern, and Middle-Western states. The
aim of this Association is not to win decisions but
rather to present clearly, forcibly, and persuasively
the personal convictions of the debaters.

Women’s Choral

Every year the women of the University troup
up to the tenth ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning
to try out for the Women's Choral, one of the oldest
and largest women's organizations on the campus.
When the many have been whittled down to the
few, there remain about sixty to participate in the

concerts in which the organization takes part.

In addition to the annual Home Concert in
Carnegie Music Hall, the group sings at the social
functions of many of the campus activity groups,
and at various churches and clubs, under the direc-
tion‘ of Mrs. Robert D. Ayars.

We dedicate, to you, Thyrsa Wealtheow Amos, the 1936
OWL. Known nationally as an important ﬁgure in the

educational world, respected locally as a force in the
cultural life of Pittsburgh, you are most admired and
esteemed by those who know you best,-—by us of Pitt,—
for your graciousness, your sympathy for and under-
standing of the diﬂiculties which we, in our youth and
ignorance, have confronted. By wise example and tactful
suggestion, you have helped us to form well-adjusted
personalities, rounded lives, and true philosophies. We
are proud of your achievements, of your successes, of the
honors deservedly given you, but our affection rests upon
a ﬁrmer foundation,—your warm humanness. Your kind-
ly inﬂuence has pervaded our work and play at the
University.

Men’s Glee Club

The Mcn’s Glee Club has the distinction of being
the oldest non-athletic activity on the University
campus. Today its membership totals well over
sixty men selected on a rigorous competitive basis.
Excellent quartets have always been the pride of

the club; furthermore both octette and solo work
have rewarded the eﬂ"orts of outstanding vocalists.
In the spring this active organization holds several
concert tours climaxing its singing season with a
home concert in Carnegie Music Hall. Two and

 

four year key awards are given to members.

This year the Pitt Band, continuing its ﬁne work of last year, has
been known as one of the outstanding organizations of this type in the
entire country. Many improvements have been accomplished by the
band during the past year. This has been well proven by the praise
given to the band by the New York papers in its trip to Fordham.

At present the band is guided by Captain D. C. Tredennick and to
him must go much of the credit for the rapid rise of the band. Lee M.
Lockhart is the present musical director of the band, with the former
director, Professor M. S. Rocereto, appointed “Director Emeritus."

One of the outstanding honors paid to the band this year was the
banquet tendered by Mr. E. V. Babcock.

The year has been featured by numerous concerts and radio pro-
grams. At the home concert the band was honored by the presence of
Edwin Franko Goldman, the great band leader.

Under the present system the band is divided into two groups.
Both groups are available to other organizations of the school at any
time their playing is needed.

Act I Scene 1. An evening early in May

Scene 2. Several hours later

Act II Six months later about 5:30 on a Monday afternoon

Act III The following Monday about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon

The Pitt Players "showedoff" their first major
production to a full house at the Y.M. and W.H.A.
Auditorium, November 14, 1935. Geo. Kelly’s mod-
ern character comedy was choosen as the vehicle
through which quite a crowd of campus notables
cavorted. The Fisher family attempts to dissuade
Amy from marrying Aubrey who is a first class four-
ﬂusher if there ever was one. Despite warnings, and
advice Amy marries and although forced to live in
cramped circumstances remains loyal to her hus-

140

band. After the death of Pa Fisher the newlyweds
move in on the rest of the Fisher family. Aubrey
living true to character is always meddling in fami-
ly affairs and causing lots of trouble. His bragging
and "putting on the dog" results in obtaining a
large sum of money for an invention for which Joe
Fisher was willing to take a small inadequate
amount. Aubrey grows bigger and brags louder.
Mrs. Fisher is lamenting, “God help me now" as
the curtain falls.

TIME

Act I Autumn, 1898, Morning

Act II Afternoon of the same day

Act III Late that evening

There will be 10 minute intermissions at the end of the first

and second acts.

George Bernard Shaw’s philosophical play,
Candida, was popular enough to necessitate two
showings at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, February
19 and 20. An excellent well-directed cast con-
vinced us that we were spending a day at St. Dom-
inick’s Parsonage in suburban London at the turn
of the century instead of an enjoyable evening in a
little theater off’ the boulevard. Shaw contrasts a
physically strong, liberal minister embodied with
the characteristics of the conﬁdent public hero type
with a poet is a physical weakling, a coward, but
endowed with spiritual understanding. The plot

141

revolves around the decision the minister’s wife,
Candida, must make when her husband ﬁnds that
the poet loves her, too. In a crude almost bluster-
ing manner the minister forces an issue and Candida
decides that she will choose the weaker of the two,
which in the end proves to be her husband. Shaw
cracks the surface of the public hero and sarcastic-
ally shows him to be dependent on a wife who can
understandingly salve his vanity. This cast de-
serves praise for the clear understanding of the
characters that was necessary to forcefully present
Shaw's philosophical theme.

Out for the Count

 

“To be in, or not to be in, that is the question."
Not quoting Shakespeare but reading Ted Vieh—
man's and Gene Kelly’s minds as they decide the
fates of over a hundred high-kicking collegians
aspiring (and perspiring) for positions in the new
Cap and Gown Chorus that would trip lightly
across the boards of the Nixon stage April 22, 23,
24, and 25.

It is always easy to tell when Cap and Gown is
near because students stand around in long lines
clutching seldom-used, second-semester activity
books that have a brand new look about them. If
you forgot to shave or don't have a necktie on, it
is forgiven if you mumble, “rehearsal.” Mr. Biddle,
the graduate manager, gets deep furrows in his
forehead, and it is impossible to get into his office
unless you whisper the magic password, “Cap and
Gown.”

This year's Show possessed an ingenious plot that
blended satire and humor into a pleasing efferves-

BUSINESS AND PRODUCTION

cent musical comedy. Radiation from the central
theme, that satirized a contemporary old age pen-
sion plan, many stabs and cuts were made to chip
away the gingerbread that veils present day prob-
lems and government policies. It was knitted
together with spicy dialogue, an array of hit songs,
and colored with “swing" dances, so all enjoyed
being “Out for the Count." Deserving of mention
and credit, but seldom receiving it are the hard
working members of the production and business
staffs whose work is essentially necessary for a
successful show.

Again we pay tribute to the Viehman-Kelly
combination, who for the second year have directed
and produced a Cap and Gown show worthy of the
traditions of the club. To Messrs. Spanos and Saff-
ron goes the glory and credit of being the under-
graduates to write the script for a Cap and Gown
show in over a decade. Perhaps they will do it
again; we hope so.

Leisurely enjoying breakfast at the
Commodore about 1:30 A.M., Saturday,
December 7, we joyously doffed our hats
to the Freshman class of '39 who had just
put over a darn swell dance, jammed the
ﬂoor with paying customers, and furnished
us this tasty breakfast. Closing our eyes,
we could still. see the bright green of
Sylvia Briggs’ dress as she whirled around
the room with John Downie, chairman
and escort, an expert at both. We could
also hear the haunting strains of Art Gile's
orchestra ﬂoating around the spacious
Hotel Schenley ballroom. Glancing
around the room, we noticed that the
boisterous freshmen for once outnumbered
the combined group of upperclass dancers.
Finishing our coffee, we arose from our
tables go home safely passing through
the revolving doors without the usual
clink of the cash register ringing in our
ears.

At 2:01 A.M., Saturday, November 9,
1935, the traditionally formal Soph Hop
of the class of '38 passed into history. The
dance was a social success as well as the
first Soph Hop to escape the “red ink"
since the “depression years. ” Archie Bley-
er’s orchestra, who this year won the
award as being “the most versatile dance
band in the country" in a contest spon-
sored by the Dancing Masters of America,
played for the merrymakers dancing on
the beautiful ballroom of the Twentieth
Century Club. Chairman D. C. Schultz,
who escorted Helenclaire Goldsberry,wore
a rather worried frown, he freely con-
fessed, until his 200th couple came through
the door. Then he joyously settled down
to having a good time together with the
rest of the Soph—hoppers. Favors were
combined with programs, each couple re-
ceiving a black suede and silver program
with a novel revolving keyhole in which
to write the exchanged dances. More than
one couple agreed , on their way to a down-
town restaurant, that it was a “swell
evening.”

Dashing happily out into the brisk eve-
ning air about 2:00, A.M. Saturday,_]anu—
ary 18, 1936, from the mirrored Hotel
Schenley ballroom, we suddenly realized
that the junior Prom, the oldest dance
tradition on the campus, would be just a
memory. A memory of glittering top hats,
soft lights, jostling pranksters, and a
marked Lombardian dance tempo played
by the popular Jack Miles.

It will always be a memory of swirling
fusia print and tails as pretty Jane Seaton,
clinging proudly to the arm of Chairman
Bill Schenck, led the grand march at the
stroke of midnight. Nor will we soon for-
get the tall blue top hat over our heads as
we passed through the doorway, brightly
colored balloons jauntily ﬂoating over-
head, or the blue and gold compact favors
ﬁrmly clutched in "the” girl’s hand. And,
dear reader, you may gather by now that
what we're really trying to say is that the
Junior Prom of 1936 will be a long—remem—
bered event.

We didn’t get to the Senior Ball until
late. Although the tickets very plainly
said Summer Formal, Reva worried, as
usual, about Whether to wear a long dress
or a short one. When we arrived at the
Schenley Ballroom, we decided that no
one could have gone wrong . . . there
was every type of dress from strictly sum-
mer formal to sportswear. Although the
dance itself was over at two, we decided
to prolong the evening since it Was our
last big campus dance. The evening was
Warm . . . warm even for May 22. So we
put the top down and rode along with the
breeze, Reva dangling her program in the
wind. Both of us were trying hard to keep
the spirit of our last dance for just a little
longer. And both of us were trying to
forget that it was our last dance.

The Heart Hop is always a good dance.
Partly because the girls instead of the boys
have to worry, for a change, about select-
ing the date. But it was especially apropos
this year. (Remember . . it was Leap
Year I) The scene was the Schenley Hotel
ballroom; the time, February seventh. The
leading parts were played by Peg Speer,
Senior Class President and Chairman of
the dance; Don Hensley, her escort; and
Bill LeRoy and his orchestra.

We thought it was a darn swell dance,
this second annual Heart Hop. The pro-
grams were cleverly combined with valen-
tines, and shiny red paper valentines, large
and small, were pasted over the mirrors of
the ballroom. But not for long . . . they
were soon torn down for souvenirs. Bal-
loons tied by cheesecloth to the large
center chandelier were dropped, and then
pins were very much in evidence. So were
the pops of breaking balloons, and sighs
of regret accompanying each pop. But a
thousand balloons could have been broken,
and still the evening would have been
an enjoyable one.

Promptly at ten o'clock, Reva and I

were marching around the William Penn
Ballroom with about a hundred and ﬁfty
other couples. No, it wasn't a political
rally. It was the annual Interfraternity
Ball. Tal Henry and his band were on the
stage. . . . Romance was in the air.
I had paid for my ticket and we were all
set to spend an enjoyable evening. Nor
were we disappointed. As we marched
past Jane Booth and her escort, Chairman
Frank Frederick, they handed Reva a blue
and gold double scarf and gave me a leath-
er backed program and memo pad.

Then we saw plenty of Greeks because
all were there . . . from the Delts to the
Theta Chis. Handshaking, good—natured
back slapping, and friendly greeting on all
sides contributed to the warm congenial
atmosphere which pervaded the Ballroom
that St. Valentines evening. At the post
mortem that we held in Child’s Restaurant
after the Ball was over, we unanimously
agreed that not even the fact that Tal
Henry played "The Music Goes Round and
Round" spoiled our fun. The floor was
good, there was plenty of dancing room,
and there were double favors. Don't you
think we should have had an exciting
time?

May 20 came and went . but there
was no Military Ball. It seems there was a
ﬂood. And to walk up 17 ﬂoors to a dance
Was a bit too much. So the ball was held
April 2.2. And, of all places, on the Tech
campus. Three bands were in three rooms
. . . Carl Eddy in the Girls Gym . . .
Fran Eichler in Thistle Hall . . . and
Harold Stern in the main Gym. The deco-
rations, usually rather scarce at campus
dances, were militaristic and patriotic.
Flags, cannons, crossed sabres, etc., were
seen in profusion. To add to the novelty
of the dance, the committee booked a ﬂoor
show and a Very good one at that. Guests
sat on the stage of the Tech gym which
was bedecked with palms. And the

A dancers traipsed into a locker room to get

their favors . . handsome silver key
chains for the men and silver necklaces for
the girls. So about two o’clock Crowds
began to leave the Tech campus and the
Pitt dance. And slowly the 800 couples
scattered, still jingling their brand new
favors.

Fitting nicely into the leap year schedule
of the campus, the annual formal Pan-
Hellenic Ball arranged and sponsored by
the sororities of Pitt, was held at the
William Penn Hotel on Friday evening,
April seventeenth. Open only to sorority
women and their escorts, the Ball never-
theless attracted one of the largest and
most colorful groups of dancers seen at any
University affair this year. Beginning at
nine and continuing until one o'clock, the
toe—tickling music of Carl Eddy, favorite
band of campus merrymakers, ﬂooded the
beautiful Urban Room with soft, smooth
syncopation. It was about eleven—thirty
when the orchestra swung into the Grand
March. Leading it were Betty Kelley, Pan-
Hellenic Council's social chairman, and
Frank Hess, imported for the evening from
Carnegie Tech. At the conclusion of the
March, double favors were passed out.
There were gold compacts decorated with
the picture of a Scottie dog for the women,
while the men were recipients of zipper
key cases in which were placed small dance
programs. The favors, the setting, the mu-
sic, and the dancers themselves, each con-
tributed to the success of the Pan—Hellenic
Ball of 1936.

Momentarily freed from the worry of
impending exams, the student body cli-
maxed a hectic Spring Festival Week of
gayety with the traditional sports dance.
Promptly at nine o'clock, Friday evening,
May 1, 1936, the early arrivals glided
around “Lover's Lane" (the Hotel Schen-
ley Ballroom) to the soothing music of
Todd Rollin’s famed Columbia Broadcast-
ing Orchestra.

Chairman Bob Mease, called away on
an important business trip, set a precedent
for future Chairmen by not attending the
dance. In his absence, the guests were
greeted by Business Manager Harvey
Goldstein and his charming escort, Betty
Rosenﬁeld. The eds, from the soles of their
white shoes to the tops of their colorful
spring neckties, and the coeds, dressed in
their tricky spring ensembles, formed a
picture of Youth, the memory of which
will not soon be forgotten.

Pitt's Spring Festival Week program this year
was distinguished by the fact that the four consecu-
tive days of Spring Festival escaped rain. But this
abstinence by the Rain God was not the only dis-
tinguishing feature of the Festival. The inaugura-
tion of a Carnival proved to be the most successful
and popular event of the week.

The Festival opened with its first event, an after-
noon tea dance, on Wednesday afternoon, April 29.
The tea dance was held in the beautiful Georgian
Room of Hotel Webster Hall and boasted the music
of Ches Walters and his po ular band. That eve-
ning, the University Ban presented its annual
home concert in Carnegie Music Hall and had as
its guest conductor, the famous New York band-
master, Edward Franko Goldman. Thursday after-
noon offered the Interfraternity track meet which
was held on the Stadium cinderpaths. Ka pa
Sigma, with its highly-touted "track team" ha no
trouble {pacing the ﬁeld ﬁnishing nearly 20 points
ahead 0 its nearest rival, Phi Kappa. The Carnival,
mentioned above, took place Thursday evening.
Tap Day, always the most colorful assembly of the
year, had a erfect setting Friday morning. Held
outdoors un er a boiling sun, it was attended by
more than 1,500 students, and contained all the ele-
ments of suspense and surprises calculated to sustain
interest to the very end. E. A. Holbrook, Dean of
the School of Engineering, delivered the main
address at the assembly. The Interfraternity sweep-
stakes offered its usual quota of thrills and chills as

164

ROBERTA NERN

the pushomobiles of the various entrants traversed
the campus Friday afternoon. The Float Parade,
another annual feature of the Festival, had as its
theme this year the interpretation of nursery
rhymes. The Sports Dance Friday night was in
keeping with the rest of the Festival. Held at the
Hotel Schenley, it was well attended by a large
portion of the student body including most of the
new tappees. Todd Rollins and his Columbia
Broadcasting Orchestra supplied the music. An
athletic Saturday afternoon, in which Pitt tangled
in a track meet with Notre Dame and staged an
exhibition scrub~varsity football game, brought the
Festival to a glorious ﬁnish.

In our four years of study, we have turned the yellowed
pages of history, social and political. In our four years of
living in the world of the University, we have wiped the
dust of the past from our eyes and looked with clear, open
eyes at the present. Faith and conﬁdence and trust we know
are essential elements in any administration. The ofﬁcers of
our school have inspired these in us. Realizing how easy it is
to jump up onto a soap—box and decry what is and near-
sightedly declare what should be, we discount unthinking
criticism by those who know not whereof they speak. We
have continued secure in the knowledge that those who see
in detail the needs of us who are students, that those who are
capable of meeting these needs, shall go on doing the best
that is possible in this world of trial-and-error to meet their
responsibility.

W0men’s
Fraternities

The women's fraternities on campus are not merely sanc-
tioned by the University; they are fostered and encouraged.
Because Pitt is an urban institution they are small social units
which give training to an individual girl and offer her the
give and take of small, intimate group life, enriching and
broadening the friendships of those who are chosen to mem-
bership. Without fraternities there would be some girls who
would have no way of knowing something of the real mean-
ing of college life, something of its richness outside of the
classroom. A fraternity not only is an integral part of college
life to many during their four years at school, but through
associations afterwards it helps to revive pleasant memories

of the past.

Alpha Delta Pi

 

On February 15, 1920, Sorosis,
a group which was organized on
the University of Pittsburgh
campus in 1916, affiliated with
Alpha Delta Pi. The national or-
ganization was founded at Wes-
leyan Female College in Macon,
Georgia, with the purple Violet
as its ﬂower and blue and white
its colors. Not only does it pro-
pose to establish sincere friend-
ship during college years but also
to continue group interest in
later life.

On December 6, 1919, the local
sorority, Alpha Gamma Omi-
cron, became the Phi Beta chap-
ter of Chi Omega. Of note in its
history, is the fact that it was the
first Greek letter society south of
the Mason—Dixon line, founded
in 1895 at the University of Ar-
kansas. Its purpose is to foster
friendship and to promote higher
education for women; the na-
tional publication, The Elmim.
For reward for success in her
chosen ﬁeld, the most outstand-
ing Woman in the United States
is annually awarded the gold
medal of achievement.

Kappa Alpha Theta, the first
Greek-letter fraternity known
among women, was founded in
1869. When Bettie Locke, a stu-
dent at Depauw University at
Greencastle, Indiana, refused to
accept a Phi Gamma Delta pin
unless she could be initiated as a
member, Phi Gamma Delta
helped Miss Locke to found an
Organization of her own. The
fraternity now numbers sixty-
four chapters. The purpose aims
at excellence in social life, schol—
arship, and activities.

Men’s

Fraternities

Fraternities have undergone radical changes in the past few
years. No longer does the general public think of them as
destructive forces in the peace of citizens and pledges, but as
an association of adults of congenial tastes and similar ideals
of ethics and conduct. The day of destructive pranks and pre-
conceived programs for wearing down the unsuspecting
pledges is now something of the past. Pledgeship has become
a testing ground for the sportsmanship and adaptability of
the young hopefuls instead of a period of obligation and hard-
ship. The sage fathers of fraternalism have gone so far as to
experiment with the abolition of Hell Week and have made
various recommendations to accomplish this end. Fraterni-
ties have as their chief purpose the creation of a socially
pleasant background and a spirit of true friendship in order
to help a person overcome objectionable character traits and
to improve those traits which are the most favorable. Above
all, by stressing loyalty and substantial intellectual progress
at the University, the fraternities as a group aid the individ-
ual to succeed in the fullest measure in achieving those pur-
poses for which he has come to the University.

Desiring to promote closer col-
lege friendships, a group of Ala-
bama students banded together
to found the Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon fraternity in 1856. The Suc-
cess of this group led to the
establishment of 110 more chap-
ters with the local Chi Omicron,
casting aside its independence in
1913 to become the Pennsylvania
Chi Omicron chapter of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. The fraternity's
colors are royal purple and old
gold. News of all the various
chapters is embodied in the con-
tents of The Record of S‘./LE.

rounded life on the part Of its
members along moral, social,
cultural, and scholarly lines. The
first military red and white unit
of Theta Chi was founded in 1856
at Norwich University. The
merging Of Sigma Epsilon in 1919
and Theta Delta Psi in 1934,
resulted in the formation of
Alpha Beta chapter of Theta
Chi. Copies of The Them Chi Rat-
tle, national magazine, and The

Sometimes honoraries are not only honorary but social, not
only social but inspiring, and not only inspiring but progres-
sive. When an honorary group reaches this stage, it has
reached its horizon. This, however, is hardly an adequate
discription of an honorary; rather, it is an ideal that should
at least inﬂuence, perhaps even inspire, the student of the
non—key-chasing variety. The scope of fraternal groups of
this kind at the University is wide, ranging from Druids and
Cwens, national activity groups for sophomores, to the
Mortar Board and O.D.K. combinations for juniors and sen-
iors. Between these two comes a host of national and local
fraternities in the particular professional ﬁelds, based pri-
marily on academic, rather than social or extra-curricular
achievement. Through them, contacts are made with leaders
in the respective ﬁeld. Friendships develop, and in this, the
fraternity achieves its most important function. Fraternities
of this kind will always play an important role in the Uni-
versity four—act production. .

Mortar Board, national senior
women’s honorary fraternity,
recognizes those women who
have best served the University
in the ﬁrst three years of their
college career. This recognition
is based on leadership in the stu-
dent body, scholarship, and their
general attitude Which makes
them truly representative as the
school's outstanding women. Be-
sides promoting friendship
among its members, Mortar
Board as a unit encourages par-
ticipation and interest in activi-
ties.

Omicron Delta Kappa was or-
ganized to honor men who have
attained success in collegiate ac-
tivities above the average. It
brings together the most repre-
sentative men in all phases of col-
lege life in order to create an
organization which will be an
aid to the rest of the student
body. Members are chosen on
the basis of strength of character
and of success in scholarship,

 

To approximately one—tenth of
the Women in the freshman class
each spring comes the honor of
being tapped to Cwens, honorary
activities fraternity for sopho-
more women. This honor is in
recognition of their leadership,
scholarship, and participation in
activities. During their second
year in the University these
women strive to maintain this
standard. Members of the organ-
ization serve as aides at many of
the University social functions
and publish a directory of all
women enrolled in the Univer-

sity.

Druids, men's national honor-
ary activities fraternity for soph-
omores, was founded at Penn
State in 1907 to recognize those
men who had been outstanding
in their freshman year in activi-
ties. Character and scholarship
are also a prerequisite to member-
ship. This year Druids revised
their constitution so as to allow
an active organization of twenty
members instead of eighteen.
Each spring Druids awards a
plaque to outstanding sopho-
more activities men.

Sigma Tau is the honorary fra-
ternity for students of engineer-
ing and mining. Tappees are
chosen not only on the basis of
their scholastic standing but also
on qualities of sociability and
enthusiasm. The stimulation of
interest in the profession is the
primary aim of the group; but
informal activities such as dances
and smokers are also promoted.
Each year the fraternity presents
silver and bronze medals to the
two sophomores who ranked
highest scholastically in their
freshman year.

Buildings are part of the University. For one thing, they let us
get out of the rain. If they are beautiful, they are better than
if they are common or ugly. Trees and grass belong at the
University. They suggest natural goodness. But, more imporant
than buildings or trees or grass, are the lights of character in the
faces of students and of teachers. Kindness, friendship, and
depth of thought, touched with joy and sorrow calm in the
living poetry of life; eagerness that the day unfold the beauty,
not of the means, but of the ends, of life—~ marks of such things
upon the faces are the significant architecture of the University.

I am proud of much that I see in faces about the University, of
the evident growth toward the loveliness and wealth of under-

standing. Let me congratulate you upon your recording of this
life in The Owl.

As more and more women have
received the degree of Bachelor
of Science, so has the importance
of Quax, science fraternity for
women increased. Its purpose is
a two-fold one, for it not only
creates an interest in general sci-
ence among the women students,
but fosters a spirit of good fel-
lowship among those who make
a science their major. With em-
phasis on the Work of women in
science, their program includes
prominent women speakers and
the assembling of a booklet of
biographies of noted women sci-
entists.

Phi Alpha Theta

 

Pi Lambda Theta is a national honorary
education fraternity for women which in
its formative period received impetus and
encouragement from Kappa Pi, a local or-
ganization founded for the same purpose
more than twenty years ago on this cam-
pus. The local organization was later
made a part of the national group which
now consists of thirty-two college chap-
ters. Membership of the fraternity is based
on scholarship and character, and is open
only to those students or graduates who
have ﬁnished or are completing their prac-
tice teaching. Their ambition is to main-
tain high standards of training in the
teaching profession, and to promote a
spirit of fellowship among the women in
that profession.

With each succeeding year Pitt's athletic cycle has been one
of expansion, and as it expands it reﬂects the building spirit
that shows itself most acutely in the climbing Cathedral of
Learning. In this respect, the past year of 1935-36 has truly
been a period of growth. It was not that Pitt football teams
won more games, or that Dr. Carlson's ‘cage teams dropped in
more ﬁeld goals, or that the track-men broke more records
than in previous years. But like construction on the Cathe-
dral, Pitt athletic teams have passed through a period of
development. No less than 22 Sophomores crashed through
their first year of varsity competition in championship style;
ﬁve sophomores played in every varsity basketball game;
Bennett, Woodruff, and Cooper showed championship track
possibilities in their initial tests; Tom Locke, another sopho-
more was the sensation of the swimming season; the frosh
boxers were the best crop in history; Ralph Bald threatened
Bob Madden's tennis reign; and Sophomore Frank Souchak
teed off with the longest drives on the golf books. The period
has been one of experimentation, instruction, and building.
When even the coaches admit the future looks bright, the
slogan is one of “Just keep an eye on them next year. . .

Not all the good that a university does comes from its classrooms
and clubs. Development for the physical self comes in various fields
of sport. Each year the department of athletics is broadening its
program so as to include an opportunity for greater numbers to gain
those beneﬁts that come from the experience of healthy competition,
good fellowship, good sportsmanship, and physical development.

DR. JOHN B. SUTHERLAND

Along with the graduation of ten regulars from
the squad of 1934 the cry went up that the 1935
season could be nothing but a disaster. Indeed
things did look rather gloomy as Dr. john B. Suth-
erland gathered the remains of the graduation
riddled squad at Camp Hamilton for two weeks of
conditioning. The squad was as inexperienced as
any Panther squad that ever trained at camp. In
fact there were barely enough old hands around to
instruct the freshman in the fine art of towing a
bench across the valley.

Forgetting inexperience and ‘seasoning which
they lacked the Panthers went through a ten game
schedule and won seven games, lost one, and tied
two.

225

SEPTEMBER 28—~P1TT 14; WAYNESBURG 0

They were determined Yellowjackets that
swarmed into the Stadium for the opening game.
So determined were they that the Panther backs
were stopped within one-yard of the goal-line. The
Panthers scored the first touchdown in the second
quarter and another in the third quarter.

OCTOBER 5—P1TT 35; WASHINGTON 8: JEFFERSON O

The showing the Panthers made in this game was
good enough to send some of the pessimists home a
little more optimistic about the Panther's chances
during the rest of the season. As the score indicates
the Panthers scored often enough to indicate that
there was plenty of power to the attack. The fact
that W-] advanced the ball but once past mid-ﬁeld
shows that the team knew something about how
to stop the other fellow.

OCTOBER 12——PITT 24; WEST\VIRGINIA 6

Clever deception on the part of the Panther backs
was an important factor in the scoring of the 24
point victory. West Virginia scored the same num-
ber of ﬁrst downs as the Panthers but the winners
piled up more than three times as much yardage as
the Mountaineers. West Virginia errors in the last
quarter gave Pitt two scoring opportunities.

OCTOBER 19——P1TT 6; NOTRE DAME 9

Hub Randour opened the show which was evi-
dently written for Shakes are with a 62-yard run.
This brought the ball eep enough into Notrc
Dame’s territory to enable Patrick to take a chance
on a field goal after three plays had been halted by
Irish tacklers. The attempt for the ﬁeld goal was
wide. The Panthers ﬁnally had 6 points gracing
the score board after a punt had been blocked deep
in the N otre Dame territory.

An unruly punt came twisting and bouncing back
to the spot from which it was kicked to give the

Irish an opportunity to score 6 points for their side.
The score stood at 6-6 until the last two minutes of
the game. With only two minutes to go Peters
dropped back to try for a ﬁeld-goal. The ball was
far enough back and at an angle large enough to
give the Panthers the idea that they would be put-
ting the ball in play on the 20-yard line with the
score still tied. However Peters had other ideas;
the kick was good for three points and enough to
give the Irish a three point victory.

OCTOBER 26~—P1TT 9; PENN STATE 0

The N ittany Lions roared and fought and clawed
at the Panthers throughout the four quarters of the
game. In the first period the Panther attack was
stopped on the four-yard line. On another occasion
the closest the Panthers could get to the Lion goal-
line was the 3. Here they decided that the best
strategy would be to have Patrick try aplacement.
The play was right for the Panthers on the play
gained a three point lead.

The Panther scored their touchdown after a ﬁfty
yard drive. Shedlosky and Patrick taking turns at
the ball carrying duties. Patrick ﬁnally plunged
the ball across from the one-yard line.

NOVEMBER 2—'*PITT 0; FORDHAM O

From the spectators point of view the Panther-
Ram game was about as exciting as a game of soli-
taire. Neither team made a serious threat to score.
Fordham reached the Pitt 18-yard line on one occa-
sion. To keep invasions even the Panthers matched
the ball to the Fordham 20. The tie marked the
first time that Pitt has been held scoreless since
1928.

NOVEMBER 9—P1TT 29; ARMY 6

The color and thrills that were missing in the
Fordham game were shown in a spectacular manner
as the Panthers clashed with the Cadets. The entire
Cadet Corps cheered their team in vain as the Pan-
thers were scoring almost at will. For once during
the season the passers on the Panther squad were
ﬁnding the receivers. Forward passing gave the
Panthers one touchdown and advanced the ball in
position to score two others.

 

MANAGER S. MCAWLEY

226

NOVEMBER 16-P1TT 6; NEBRASKA 0

After Lloyd Cardwell took the kick-off on a dead
run and ran until Larue stopped him, Nebraska did
not threaten until the last few seconds of the game.
The exceptionally long-distance punting by Francis,
Nebraska fullback, and Stapulis, Pitt Sophomore
was the best seen in the Stadium all season. Stapulis
sent one kick from his own goal-line to the Neb-
raska 30.

NOVEMBER 28-P1TT O; CARNEGIE 0

It was a sad and sorry eleven that limped off the
Stadium field after four furious quarters against the
Tartans. The Panthers out-ﬁrst—downed the Tech
team 13 to 2 and gained 262 yards to Techs 64, they
were not able to get the yardage when yards meant
points. An attempt for a ﬁeld foal proved to be the
Panthers only real scoring opportunity. Captain
Nick Kliskey was one big reason why the Tartans
gained no more than 64 yards. His defensive play
stopped Tartan runners at the line time and time
again. A

DECEMBER 14~P1TT 12; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 7

Soon after the game opened Souchak intercepted
a pass and advanced the ball 35-yards. There he
lateraled to Glassford. After two attempts Randour
placed the ball inches from the Trojan goal-line.
Patrick stumbled over the line for the score on the
next play. The Panthers put on their finest offensive
drive of the year. An 81-yard drive on eight con-
secutive plays brought the second touchdown. The
line stopped ﬁve Trojans thrusts within the three
yard line.

FRESHMAN FOOTBALL

The Freshman football team won three games
and lost two during the 1935 season. They lost one
game to Tech's plebes 3 to O, and another to Kiski,
12 to 6. The Panthers won their next three games
with Penn State, West Virginia and The Navy B
team as foes by decisive margins.

Varsity Basketball

 

D3. CARLSON

Giving an electric light exhibition of basketball,
which is "on” at times and “off” at times, the
Panther Varsity cage team swept through the 1935-
36 season playing the longest season since 1931, 27
games, and losing their three-year hold on the East-
ern.Intercollegiate Basketball Conference title to
their rivals across the hollow, Carnegie Tech. Of
the 27 games, 18 had a Carlson smile ringed around
them while nine had the largest number of points
on the wrong side of the box—score.

After a slow conference start, which saw games
dropped to Tech and Georgetown, the Carlson men
suddenly came to life and dribbled out seven suc-
cessive league victories which placed them in the
number one position in the standings. Then, those
pesky Mountaineers of West Virginia, in the last
game of the season, threw the race into a Panther-
Tartan tie by nosing out the Pitt boys down in
Morgantown, 43-42.

In the play—off game at the Stadium, the Panthers,
playing their 27th game of the season, wilted in the
second half to a determined Tech rally and with the
32-27 Victory gave the Tartans the conference title,
the ﬁrst time the championship has been out of the
Panthers’ possession.

At the close of the season, the Pitt boys entered
the Olympic play-offs in Philadelphia, adding two
more games to an already long schedule. The Cats
won the ﬁrst of their Olympic games, defeating the
St. Johns ﬁve of Annapolis, 29-21, but in the district
ﬁnal, the Temple Owls put whatever Berlin—bound
ideas the Panthers may have had to a stop with a
41-37 triumph. In all, the Blue and Gold ﬁve took
19 of the 29 games played during the season.

228

At the beginning of the season, the Panthers
looked as though they might have had another con-
ference winner and a possible national title contend-
er. The first third of the season found them winning
eight out of ten games while making two strenuous
tours, one through the west and the other down
south. The western jaunt showed a net return of
two wins and one loss while the Christmas southern
tour had the Panthers in their best form of the sea-
son, taking ﬁve of six games played with the cream
of the southern cage crop.

Back north once more, the Panthers really did
begin to give the “electric light" exhibition of
basketball. Three straight games were dropped by
the Carlsonites, two of them to conference rivals.
From here until the end of the season, the Panthers
played “on and off" basketball.

Highlights of the year were topped by the Pan-
ther comeback triumph over the widely heralded
“miracle” team, Davies’ Duquesne Dukes, 46-41.
At the half in this game the Cats trailed the Duke
Powerhouse by nine points, 25-16, but after the
"ice cream" intermission, the Pitt team caught on
ﬁre. With Pete Noon and Bob Johnson as the
sparks, the Panthers scored 16 straight points to
take a ten-point lead over the astoun ed boys from
the Bluff, and ﬁnally wind up with a ﬁve point
victory over the Dukes.

Throughout the season, Coach Carlson made
good use of his ten varsity players. The usual start-
ing lineup had Bill _]esko, 1936—37 captain-elect, and
Frank Loucks at the forwards, with Pete Noon on
the center job. Bob Johnson and Ed Spotovich were
the guards. On the other ﬁve, which Carlson used
as much as the first lineup, Captain Ted Roderick,
high—scorer on the team, and Myles Zeleznick
teamed at forwards, Joe Garcia at center, and Mike
Radvansky and Luke Rowe bringing up the rear
with their guard posts. Of the ten men, only Rod-
erick and Noon will be lost in Carlson’s build-up
of next year’s cage team.

Track

 

CoAcH CARL OLsoN

In this 12th Olympic year of track, ﬂashing Pitt
spikes have been cutting deep gashes in smooth
cindered tracks. It has been extremely rare for a
Pitt track team to be engaged in such desperate
activity and perhaps the most logical explanation
would center about the ﬁery mentor of the Panther
runners and jumpers, Mr. Carl Olson, formerly of
Gary, Indiana.

It has not been so long that the short squat track
coach strode into the Stadium oﬂice and took over
the reins, in fact he spent the lst Olympic year with
his Indiana squad. Today, however, he can look
back over the records of the past three years, com-
pare notes with the present listings and deﬁnitely
see the rapid strides forward that have been taken
in that three year period.

During the past indoor campaign the mile relay
team, although ﬁnishing second in ﬁrst class com-
petition was on at with the consistently ﬁne quar-
tets of the past Few years. Art Thomas, Jack Mc-
Connell, Charles Groat, and Harold Connelly com-
prised a quartet of quarter-milers that pushed Man-
hattan to a new world record at the annual I.C.4A.
championships. At this same meet Art Thomas
out-stepped a speedy field to win ﬁrst place in the
50-yar race to garner the Panther's only ﬁrst place.

At the C.I.C. Championships Pitt dropped the
title to Notre Dame's well-balanced squad, but
showed up well in several departments. Thomas
again came through with an individual triumph,
scoring a ﬁrst place in the quarter. The relay team
ﬁnished in a tie with Notre Dame. Pete Bennett
climbed into second place in the high jump. Harold
Tost, Andrew Lasky, and Robert Gerrety accounted
for the remaining points in the Panther total.

Altogether the relay competed in four national
events, the Butler relays, Millrose Games, N .A.
A.U. meet, I.C.4A. meet in addition to the C.I.C.

230

Championships. As usual the Pitt athletes domi-
nated the A.M.A. indoor championships, copping
virtually in all departments with the exception of
the high and broad jumps. Lewis of the Rankin
A.C. was the only runner who scored a ainst the
Panther team. In the Pitt New: Olympic und bene-
ﬁt track and ﬁeld championships, February 15, $150
was raised as the Pitt donation to the American
team fund. At this meet seven records were broken.

In the ﬁrst meet of the out-door campaign, the
Panthers continued to show their dominance over
the two-ring Temple show of Peacock and Thread-
gill to score their fourth successive victory 77-58.
Gene Taano, ﬁnnish—stylist in the javelin, stamped
himself as an outstanding prospect for the Olympic
Team by heaving the spear 202 feet, four inches in
his only attempt of the afternoon. Pete Bennett tied
the Owl’s famed Threadgill in the high jump to
register quite an upset.

Taano and Bennett are perhaps Pitt's outstanding
candidates for the American Olympic Team in the
Games this summer in Berlin. Art Thomas is an-
other boy who might possibly just slip in there
before the trials are over as might Charles Groat,
Harold Connelly, or several others.

Outstanding in the freshman ranks are: Glenn
Cooper, sprinter and hurdler, Ken Ryden, hurdler,
John Woodruff, middle-distance runner. Charles
Perrsons looks like a possible decathalon contender,
possessing the necessary running, jumping and
weight throwing abilities. These four should con-
tinue to improve in the future.

In the I.C.4A. championships at California last
summer Charles Gongloff, past February graduate,
cracked the Intercollegiate javelin record with a
heave of 221 feet, four inches to co the event and
hang up the best American mark in our years. This
performance stamped Charley as the outstanding
candidate for the Olympic Games in August.

In four months, Coach Olson calls together the
ﬁnest group of cross-country prospects in Pitt his-
tory. It has taken virtually three years to build up
the present crew of harriers, a crew that shows
promise of leading the chase for Intercollegiate
cross-country honors in 1936. Already, plans are
under way for the drive to make this a Panther year
in cross-country. An entire Panther team that ﬁn-
ished a "surprise" fourth in the 1935 I.C.4A. cham-
pionships, with the exception of Charley Groat,
returns for combat in the Schenley Park den.

Sam Musico, after a year's lay-off, will add much
to the Panther cause in his ﬁnal year of competition.
Last fall, Sam was stricken with appendicitis early
in September, operated on two days later, and ﬁn-
ished the season recovering on a hospital bed. It
was Sam who cracked the record at Annapolis in
his junior year, 1934, as he led his mates to a 15-40
victory over the Midshipmen. Musico also copped
State scholastic honors in the mile during his high
school competition at Langley.

Another senior, George Cook, missed his sopho-
more year due to injuries, and like Musico, plans
to return for his third year of cross-country in the
fall. Cook ﬁnished high in last year's individual

 

place-getting race. Two more boys, Harold “Red"
ost, honorary captain in ’35, and Alex Leggin,
round out a quartet of seasoned seniors that prom-
ises to shove the University to the top in the hill-
and—dale sport. Both earned varsity letters during
the past two campaigns. Tost was the ﬁrst Panther
to breast the tape in every meet, climaxing a first
place in the Butler encounter with a 14th in the
I.C.4A. championships over the Van Cortlandt
Park Course, New York. Leggin consistently held
down number two or three position on the Panther
lineup.

Balancing this quartet of seniors to make a well-
rounded squad, Franklyn Theriault and Jack Emens
move up from the sophomore class with full years
of varsity and frosh experience under their belts.
Theriault counted enought points to win a letter in
his ﬁrst varsity campaign, ﬁnishing remarkably
well in 34th place at the I.C.4A. games.

From the yearling squad, John Woodruif can
boast of never really being pushed in ﬁnishing un-
defeated on a victorious freshman squad that swept
aside both frosh and high school opponents with
amazing ease. The long-legged Connellsville runner
won All-American scholastic honors by virtue of
cracking the existing mile and half-mile scholastic
marks at the W.P.I.A.L. and state meets.

Others from Coach Potts’ undefeated yearling
aggregation who rate varsity threat positions are:
Al Zamborsky, James Filson, Frank Bonorati, Bob
Cogswell, and Fred Tredennick.

Boxing

If the Panthers had met one or two more top-
notch collegiate boxing squads no one could deny
that the Panthers did not face one of the most dith-
cult schedules ever handed out to a team of collegi-
ate boxers. The Panthers met West Virginia and
Wisconsin, two of the best college boxing outﬁts
in the game. Besides these two strong teams they
met Bucknell, Catholic University, Carnegie Tech,
and Temple University. The Panthers lost to Wis-

consin by a score of 7 to 1. Bucknell won a close
decision over the Panthers. The high-light of the

season was the tie with West Virginia.

Captain Al Paslowski was by far the most per-
sistent winner on Coach Jack Schricker's varsity. Coxcn JACK SCHRICKER
Paslowski dropped only one match during the sea-
son. He reached the ﬁnals of the Conference Cham-
pionships but was defeated by Welsh of West
Virginia. Welsh had previously defeated Paslowski
in the bouts between the Mountaineers and the
Panthers.

Varsity Swimming

For the first time in twelve seasons the Panther
swimmers did not win the Eastern Collegiate Swim-
ming Association Team Championship. A defeat at
the hands of Franklin and Marshall early in the
season ruined the Panthers chance of topping the
team standing in 1936. In the individual champion-
ships, Russell Lindberg, captain of the team won
the 150-yard backstroke championship.

The Pitt swimmers defeated their other three
league opponents in a decisive ‘manner. Manhat-
tan, Carnegie Tech, and Delaware were defeated by
decisive margins. Slippery Rock, a non-league op-
ponent was also defeated. Army and Ohio State,
also non-league foes, defeated the Pitt varsity.

This years squad was one of the smallest ever
coached by Corr. Only nine students were on the
varsity. Lindberg, Locke and McQuillan were by
far the outstanding point getters for the team.
Thomas Anderson, James Lavine, John Stiranka,
Harry Geyer, Robert Prince, and Walter Hunchak
also contributed to the success of the team.

Wrestling

The fact that wrestling is a comparatively new
sport in the University’s athletic curriculum and
that the team is scheduled against strong teams and
schools where the sport has been instituted for years
is no small factor in the losses that the Panther
team sustained during the season. Although the
Panthers have been improving by leaps and bounds
they are as yet not strong enough to hold the better

Out of 53 Intercollegiate matches with teams
from coast to coast the Varsity Riﬂe Team won 33
and lost 20 matches. Other honors were won by
the team. In the National Riﬂe Association’s Al-
legheny County Intercollegiate Match the Panthers
ﬁnished in third place. In this competition the
team won ﬁve matches and lost three. Members of
the varsity team who were awarded letters were:
Captain A. T. Duff,  H. Currie,  C. Duff, W. S.

wrestling teams in the East to respectable scores.

The loss of the services of Captain Russell Bedil-
lion at mid-semesters weakened the team consider-
ably. Babcock, Torrnarelli, Thurston, Niebel,
Simenoff, Richards, Kodashov, and Badillion were
the wrestlers who kept tugging at their more ex-
perienced foes. Edward Mozeski coached the team.

Greer, J. L. Poelott, and J. E. Tredennick.

The R.O.T.C. Riﬂers ended the season with a
somewhat better record than that compiled by the
varsity. The R.O.T.C. team ﬁnished third in the
3rd Corps area and lost but six out of 28 matches.
Of the three teams entered in the Hearst shoot the
first team ﬁnished ﬁfth, the second sixth and the
third team ﬁnished 23rd.

Intramural Sports

After previous spasmodic attempts had failed, an
elaborate Intramural program was ﬁnally conceived
and executed last year with much success by
Martin J. Feely, a member of the Physical Educa-
tion Department's faculty who assumed the added
position of Director of Intramural Athletics. His
primary purpose, which is the fundamental of every
activity in the Intramural ﬁeld, was to give all stu-
dents an opportunity to participate in some type of
athletic competition. To achieve this aim he took
a sputtering Interfraternity athletic program and
made it into a ﬁrm foundation, from which the
Intramural structure rapidly has risen.

In addition to the fraternity competition, leagues
have been formed to include such groups as the
Medical School, the Dental School, the Engineer-
ing School, and the all-embracing Independents.
Touch football, volleyball, bowling, table tennis,
basketball, boxing, wrestling, mushball, track and
tennis compromise the sports selection that was
made available to every student in the school, with
the exception of the varsity letter-winners. In the
ﬁrst year of organized activity, 1392 undergraduates
participated in the various events. This year, while
ﬁgures have yet to be tabulated, a greater entry list
has been deﬁnitely indicated.

Touch football, ranking ﬁrst in calendar order
and second in student appeal with 250 participants,
started the 1935-36 Intramural season late in Octo-
ber. An Independent League, a Medical League,
and a Fraternity Tournament had 22 teams playing
on the gridirons of Trees Field and the Schenley
Oval. Although no winners in the other competi-
tion were determined, the Interfraternity cham-
pionship was won by Kappa Sigma. Martin Groat
threw a 15-yard pass to Paul Mahoney to defeat
Delta Tau Delta, 6-0, in the ﬁnal game.

Volleyball, next on the schedule, was conﬁned
to the Interfraternity group and Delta Tau Delta
received the championship cup with Phi Delta
Theta as runner-up. Bowling, another fraternity
event, divided the thirteen chapters into two
leagues. After defeating Delta Tau Delta and Phi
Kappa by the margin of one pin in the ﬁrst place
play-off, Lambda Chi Alpha lost to the winner of
the other league, Phi Delta Theta in the title match.

235

Table tennis, growing in national popularity,
has gained a large following in the University as
evidenced by the entry list in the second annual
table tennis tourney sponsored by Mr. Feely as a
part of the Intramural program. Close to 100 play-
ers entered the ﬁrst round of the tournament which
was held on the tables of the Y lounge. Tennis
players, Irwin Solow, paddled his way to the cham-
pionship for the second successive year by defeating
William Brosius in the ﬁnal match. A team tourney
was conducted among the 13 fraternities and the
Delta Tau Delta ﬁve man team of Hurst, Gleason,
Pritchard, Housel, and Haller was responsible for
the third Delt cup of the year. Sigma Alpha Mu
was runner-up.

Most widely participated in with regard
to players, games, and the like was basketball.
Five leagues consisting of 28 teams and approxi-
mately 280 players composed the basketball set-up.
Delayed by the ﬂood and other obstacles, the
basketball schedule was not completed until late
April, when the championship play-offs were held.
Two fraterni-ty league titles were won by Kappa
Sigma and Phi Kappa. In the play-off, Kappa Sigma
annexed the Interfraternity championship by de-
feating Phi Delta Theta, 27-18. Engineering League
honors were won by the Chem Engineers and the
Metallurgists, ﬁrst and second place teams. The
Little Potatoes were undefeated in the Medical

School League and the Sophties together with the
Newman Club were tied for the lead in the Inde-
pendent League. To decide the Intramural cham-
pionship play-offs between the ﬁrst and second place
winners of each league were held. In this competi-
tion, the Sophties earned the distinction of being
classiﬁed as the Intramural champions by winning
all their games in an elimination series.

Tournaments in boxing, wrestling, and tennis
provided activity and awards in other lines of
athletic endeavor. Mushball play ended the Intra-
mural list of scheduled events. Place winners in
every activity were awarded gold, silver, and
bronze medals. Trophies were given to the Inter-
fraternity winners.

CORRESPONDENCE INVITED

In the beginning it was Freshman Week.
We were freshmen.

We moved around in the registration
maze feeling as strange and bewildered as
a mile runner at a debutant’s debut. That
feeling of ours faded as the University's
united attack sent us through a swift series
of events and first taught us the meaning of
orientation. By the end of the first day we
were sure we were welcome, by the end of
the second day we had a deﬁnite apprecia-
tion of the value of activities, and by the
end of the third day we ﬁgured we were
going to like the place.

Classes began, and we began climbing
those steps to Alumni Hall. We were fair-
ly well acclimated by the time the Druid
Smoker and Lantern Night came. At the
Smoker, key—conscious ﬁrst—year men
signed up for every activity in sight; the

Women tucked away the beauty and im-
pressiveness of Lantern Night as carefully
as later they pasted freshman armbands in
their scrapbooks.

It was our fortune, that fall, to sit in the
Stadium and watch what we had heard
called “a lethargic Pitt cheering section"
whipped into a frenzy as the Panthers
pushed back the green and gold steamroll-
er that was Notre Dame. And minutes
later we were a part of the back—slapping,
hysterical madness which followed Mike
Sebastian's touchdown run (a heart—break—
er for the Irish). We sang “Hail, hail, the
gangs all here" with all our might. And
as we ﬂoated down the shadowed hillside
that afternoon, drunk with the crazy joy
of that victory and with having seen at
first hand the real Pitt spirit, we knew that
“it felt good to be a Pitt man."

Then our parents went to the Chancel-
lor’s reception, and brought home grade

cards, and these somehow brought home‘

to us the realization that activities, fun,
and tea dances weren't, really, included in
that scholastic grading system that year.
And so we went more conscientiously, if
not more merrily, on our freshman way,
sampling everything new and continually
wondering why Mr. Trees had huilt his

gymnasium so far, far up on a hilltop.
The next fall we were sophomores, with
all rights and privileges appertaining
thereto. We found the Cathedral fully en-
closed, and our hopes rose with the predic-
tion that we would be the first class to
graduate from the lawn in front of a com-
pleted Cathedral. Fraternities and activi-

Deans of the Undergraduate Students

Perhaps in this ﬁnal message which you as Seniors receive from each

of your deans, you will gain not only a broader concept of what you

have been striving for during your life at the University, but an idea

of what standards there are for you to set and maintain as an individual

and as a graduate of an institute of higher learning. May you through

these help to crystallize all the mass of details you have gained both

in the classroom and in extra—curricular activities into a practical work-

ing basis for your philosophy of life in the years to come.

STANTON D. CRAWFORD

Dean of the College

In the College, the constant aim is to help the student
find himself, and then develop in mental, moral, and
spiritual qualities to the full measure of his individual
capacity. This purpose is expressed in recent curricular
changes, enabling the student to do more work of a broad
Cultural nature, and to ursue his studies on a level suited
to his ability. As new acilities are provided in the Cathe-
dral of Learning, he will beneﬁt from an improved pro-
gram of counselling, from better conditions for both
study and recreatory reading in the splendid new library,
and from better acquaintance with fellow students and
members of the faculty.

The student, who, by the time he has reached his senior
year has learned to think objectively and analytically,
who is tolerant of others View points and cautious about
jumping at conclusions, has acquired an asset and a bal-
ance that will be invaluable to him forever after. Some
acquire it in greater degree than others, but no one who
is intelligent can live, work and play with his friends in
the University without proﬁting by the maturing inﬂu-
ences of the University environment.

Life will require the best you have at all times, but
for the able it will be filled with so much of interest that
it can never be monotonous. You will soon be depending
upon yourself instead of the faculty for guidance. Your
mistakes will be costly. But character, education and
balance will reduce errors of judgment to a minimum,
and make continuous growth and development inevita-
ble.

acquaintances, and readjusted our ideas
and ideals. As sophomores we did the
pack work of our college life. We took
part in no hazing, we created little dis-
turbance, and we broke tradition by com-
ing out even on our Hop. The only fresh-
man we had a hand in initiating was a
great fellow named Vincent W. Lanfear,
and he was a dean of men.

Buds bloom in the fall of the year for
college juniors. Those of us who had stuck

to the work began to get some realization
of all this. Many of us showed enough
mettle to win top positions over competi-
tors from the senior class. We were in at

sociation, which replaced the faction-
ridden Student Council, and for the first
time, had a part in student government.

Dear Jim,

Congratulations old fellow! For the past four years
you've been taking exams and have passed them all with flying
colors. You've had many good times while at Pitt and in a few
days Chancellor Bowman will present you with your degree.

Then what? Well, I hope you make a connection that will
be profitable and one that will lead you to great success.
It's going to be a tough struggle, old man, but you've got the
stuff that it takes to get along.

Well Jim, I, too, have been busy with examinations. Every
day is examination day as far as I'm concerned. Each morning,
shortly after eight o'clock, the scientific staff here at
Gulf put me through a series of the most rigid tests that
you've ever seen. If I'm not up to par, and my grade cannot
be lower than "A", I don't get through.

Well Jim, after exams like these you might think that
I'm weary--but I'm not, I'm full of life. Millions of
motorists from Maine to Texas find that I'm full of power,
rapid acceleration, quick starting, and high mileage.

Why not stop in and renew our acqaintance some day when
you're passing? Perhaps you've forgotten my address? Well,
old fellow, here it is again. Jot it down in your date book
so you'll remember. You can always find me at the Sign
of the Orange Disc.

Sincerely,

juniors. We were, in fact, setting all sorts
of records. Our Prom, in spite of a fair
attendance, set a new high in dance deﬁ-
cits. Yet when the time came, they handed
down to us, for the first time in a Tap Day
ceremony, the giant senior spoon, and we
were all set for the last lap of what non-
collegians call a college career.

Autumn of 1935! By that time almost
all the activities were being headed by a
member of our class. The women were
senior mentors and unit adviser, telling
new freshmen what had been told them,

and even more. Scores of the men were
helping in the new orientation system for
freshman men. Days went by swiftly and
faces grew more serious as realization came
that the end of this final year was ap-
proaching fast. We began to talk about
jobs. We asked “What are you going to
do after graduation?" We made quips
about jobjective seniors.

For some reason, the greatest ﬂood the
city ever had popped into our senior year
and washed out a lot of things, including.
the Military Ball. Later, the Ball went

rolling, but on the evening of the day
when thousands jammed the Commons
Room to show their opposition to a next
war. May came; and with it came the
naming of the Senior Queen, the Senior
King, Alma Mater, and members of the
Hall of Fame, those last honors for the
ones outstanding in our class. The next
things to come are little things. These are
merely our making sure that our names are
on the graduation rolls, that we have
gathered the necessary graduation fees,
and that we take a part in the farewell
ceremonies. Then, for a few brief hours
before we walk into the Stadium for the
commencement procession, we shall bob
up to the peak of University achievement.
The scenes will shift then, and the world
will become our new campus.

In the end, it is Commencement. And
we are freshmen all over again.

”A Good Impression"

it proves of great importance.

ELMER A. HOLBROOK
Dam of the Sc/2001 of Engineering and Aline:

Honesty, loyalty, and courtesy things
change but these must remain. With them,
you can go far. Without them, you may
prosper but in what really matters you will
fail. Power and positionware these your
ambition? You may attain them; we hope
you will. But when you have them What
will you do with them? We can teach you
much about the principles and meaning of
business, but how you use what you
learn here is for you to decide.

21

The Schools of Engineering and Mines have for
more than ﬁfty years developed men to enter the
varied engineering professions. Our particular way
of training students has been, not only to give them
the engineering and professional fundamentals, but
to include a broad educational training made pos-
sible by our close association with the College and
the School of Business Administration of a great
university. Thus our graduates have been success-
ful, not only in professional engineering, but in
executive positions, in varied lines of business and
in promoting the well being of professional, civic
and social groups. Most of all, if we can teach the
student to understand the modern industrial world,
give him an engineering point of view, and hope
that he has gathered a common sense outlook on
his life and professional development, then we have
done our work with him.

This year marks the twenty-eighth anniversary
of the founding of a division of the University of
Pittsburgh devoted to the offering of university
courses in the evenings. Approximately twenty-six
hundred men and women have been pursuing studies
this year in a wide variety of ﬁelds in the Down-
town Division. It is really a small university unto
itself, where those who are employed during the
day may do their work for a university degree, or
may do special and graduate work in particular
ﬁelds. It is something more than a place where
classes meet—it is a university campus, with its
social life, its organizations, and its spirit of youth
—set down in the midst of the business life of the
community.

It is probable that no college or training school
for teachers ever turns out a completed product.
At best it serves to short-circuit the long process
by which the hardworking teachers of the pre-
training era became known as “great teachers."
Though we may repeat the popular dictum that
“great teachers are born and not made," more
serious reﬂection reveals that these people came
into their own after a long period of development.
Institutional teacher training is to be considered
but the preliminary step, the preliminary time
saver to becoming a “great teacher."

VINCENT WESLEY LANFEAR
Dam of Men

Hail and farewell! I like to say that to seniors.
It says so simply, “We praise you, we prize you,
go on enjoying, go on lengthening your life." I
like especially the challenge to extend life. I think
it was Martial who said centuries ago, "The excel-
lent man prolongs his life; to be able to enjoy one's
past life is to live twice." Just as the memory of
the joys and pleasures of college days prolongs that
life, so may the graduate days to come lengthen that
life through their enduring satisfactions. So hail
and farewell, seniors!

23

The student, who, by the time he has reached his
senior year has learned to think objectively and
analytically, who is tolerant of others view-points
and cautious about jumping at conclusions, has
acquired an asset and a balance that will be invalu-
able to him forever after. Some acquire it in greater
degree than others, but no one who is intelligent
can live, work and play with his friends in the Uni-
versity without proﬁting by the maturing inﬂu-
ences of the University environment.

Life will require the best you have at all times,
but for the able it will be filled with so much of in-
terest that it can never be monotonous. You will
soon be depending upon yourself instead of the
faculty for guidance. Your mistakes will be costly.
But character, education and balance will reduce
errors of judgment to a minimum, and make con-
tinuous growth and development inevitable.

JOHN W. HALLOCK, Secretary

The General Alumni Association is an organi-
zation of more than twenty thousand graduates
of the various schools of the University. Prac-
tically all colleges and universities maintain
active alumni associations. It is the hope of our
organization that we can provide a significant
service, not only to graduates and former stu-
dents of the University, but also to undergradu-
ates. In order to accomplish this we are anxious
to carry in our alumni publications and to
emphasize in our program of activities timely
information about current student affairs.

As stated in its constitution, its object is “to
promote the welfare and interests of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and its alumni, to foster close
cooperation between alumni and the University,
and to support and advance the cause of higher
education.” The Association does more than
that—it provides opportunity for helpful fellow-
ship; it promotes the friendships and associations
of student days; as an organization, it safeguards
the interests of the University, its faculty, stu-
dents, and alumni. It is a great, constructive,
civic force and every eligible individual should
align himself immediately upon graduation.

Members of the General AlLI1'lI'll Association
automatically become members of the constitu-
ent alumni association representing the school
from which they were graduated. There are ten
such constituent associations,—College, Engi-
neering and Mines, Business Administration,
Medicine, Dentistry, Law, Pharmacy, Down-
town Division, Education and Graduate Schools,
and Alumnae. The General Alumni Association
holds only two stated meetings a year. Constitu-
ent school associations meet frequently and pro-
mote the distinctly professional relationships.

The governing body of the General Alumni
Association is Alumni Council. This consists of
three elected delegates from each of ten constitu-
ent associations, elected delegates from qualiﬁed
Pitt Clubs outside of Allegheny County, and the

Association

25

 

DON F. SAUNDERS, Editor
T/ac Record and The Alumni Review

elected ofﬁcers of the General Alumni Associa-
tion. Alumni Council divides itself into the
following committees: Executive, Finance, Pro-
gram, Publications, Alumni Headquarters, Mem-
bership, Relations with Constituent Associations
and Clubs, Relation with Undergraduates, New
Students, Aims and Objects, and Publicity.

In populous centers Pitt Clubs are chartered by
Alumni Council to hold regular meetings and to
foster and perpetuate an interest in University
affairs. The oldest of these Clubs was formed in
1914. Clubs are now active or are in the process
of organization in Westmoreland County, Erie,
Harrisburg, Connellsville, Lehigh Valley, Lack-
awanna County, Philadelphia, Newark, N. J.,
New York City, Youngstown, Ohio, Chicago,
Illinois, and Southern California.

The General Alumni Association has two oili-
cial publications,——Tbc Pittsburgh Record and the
Alumni Review. The Record is published four times
a year and the Review seven times a year. Both
publications are sent to members in good stand-
ing.

The Placement Bureau is operated by the secre-
tary’s office, to assist in putting alumni in touch
with prospective employers. A very effective
work has thus far been done in this connection.

Dues in the General Alumni Association are
$3.00 a year, payable July first. These dues in-
clude a year's subscription to the Pittrburg/1 Record
and the Alumni Review,‘ membership in one con-
stituent school association (and to a Pitt Club
if the alumnus lives in a Club territory), and all
the general and special services mentioned.
Above all, the payment of the annual dues aligns
the alumnus with the organization which keeps
him a member of the University body as long as
he remains in good standing.

For further information regarding the General

Alumni Association or its activities, address the
secretary, 1301 Cathedral of Learning.

We step forward to receive our degrees, the tangible symbols
of our four years of work, our four years of maturation and
development. We cannot resist, nor do we wish to resist,
taking a backward glance through the kaleidoscope of ﬂash-
ing colors of what has been. Fresh quiet hours spent in the
hush of marble libraries. Fresh green moments of walking
with friends along grass—bordered walks, up stairs worn by
the feet of those who have gone before us. The rich gold and
scarlet minutes of sharing the companionship of the Univer-
sity’s great. The bright orange and purple of active hours,
debating, acting, writing, watching track meets, cheering
football squads. Peaceful azure moments lazed away before
the Heinz House ﬁreplace, sharing thoughts and experiences
with fellow-students. Nor can we, as we reach for the sheep-
skins, escape a glimpse into the future. We watch the rain-
bow of school activities blend into the sharp black and
glaring white of the reality that is the larger life of the city,
as we assign a place and a significance to our little lives in the
entity that is society of today.

Unprecedented advances have been made
in dental education during the past decade,
culminating in the formulation of a new
curriculum, which has been approved by
all the dental schools of the United States
and Canada. Two years of college credits
will be required for entrance, and the den-
tal curriculum will be four years in length.

An entering class on the new curriculum
was admitted to the School of Dentistry in
1935. Beginning with the year l936—l937
the new Curriculum will be in operation
for the two lower classes and as much of
the new work as possible will be incor-
porated in the present curriculum of the
two upper classes during the year.

Besides having a distinguished record of
active professional service Dean Friesell
was one of the founders of the American
College of Dentists. He has been president
and an active member of many dental as-
sociations, during which time his contri-
butions to professional periodicals and the
ﬁeld of research has been great. At the
present time he is chairman of the Dental
Index Bureau which recently has com-
pleted a listing of all English periodical
literature in that field. It is through his
Work and interest that the University of
Pittsburgh Dental School has reached its
present status in this country.

The Dental Student Council, the governing body
of student activities in the School of Dentistry,
aims to promote the moral, intellectual, social, and
physical welfare of its students. It was first or-
ganized in May 1925, to bring about a closer rela-
tionship between students and faculty members
and to encourage a spirit of cooperation between

76

these two groups. The membership now includes
two representatives elected to Council from each
class, representative oﬂicers from the Senior,
Junior, Pre-Junior, and Pre-Sophomore classes, and
five faculty advisors appointed by the Dean of the
School of Dentistry.

A branch of the National Dental Interfraternity
Council founded in Chicago in 1922, the University
of Pittsburgh? Dental Interfraternity Council is
made up of two representatives elected by each of
the three dental fraternities. While entertaining
the council members at regular monthly meetings
at different fraternities, the group discusses the

promotion of interfraternity competition in basket-
ball, bridge, and mushball. In more serious mo-
ments, it regulates and formulates rules for the
rushing and pledging of new members. The annual
dance is of considerable aid in achieving the purpose
of the organization. . . . “to stimulate harmony
among the fraternities under its jurisdiction."

Alpha Omega, professional dental fraternity, was organized in Philadelphia and
incorporated under the laws of Maryland in 1909. It was formed by the consolidation
of the Ramach Fraternity founded at the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery in
1906, and the Alpha Omega Dental Fraternity founded at the University of Maryland
in 1907. In the fall of 1920, the Odons Club, dental organization on the Pitt campus,
became the Omicron chapter of Alpha Omega. The intention of the fraternity is to
foster social recreation, to spur professional and intellectual achievement, and to
make college dental training a signiﬁcant force in the lives of the graduates. Since its
organization, Alpha Omega has grown steadily until today, with its many under-
graduate and alumni chapters, it is international in scope.

Delta Sigma Delta, men’s national dental fraternity, was founded at the University
of Michigan in 1882. The aim of the fraternity is to keep high the standards of
dentistry by inculcating in the minds of dental students and of dental practitioners a
spirit of fraternal cooperation towards scientiﬁc, ethical, and professional progress.
Sigma chapter, local Pitt group, was founded February 5, 1903, with twelve charter
members. Since then it has grown rapidly until today, mainly by keeping its members
in touch with practicing dentists, it ranks high in the professional world.

tinction of being among the oldest of the dental fraternities on the Pitt campus; it
numbers among its alumni twenty-seven members of the faculty of the School of
Dentistry. At the present time there are thirty-ﬁve active and sixty-one alumni

School of
Pharmacy

The School of Pharmacy (The Pittsburgh
College of Pharmacy) was founded by a group
of professionally minded pharmacists in 1878.
Its founding anticipated college prerequisite for
licensure to function as a pharmacist by almost
an entire generation. In 1896 during the chan-
cellorship of the late Dr. William Holland
the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy became
through afﬁliation the School of Pharmacy of
the Western University of Pennsylvania, and
in 1908 of the University of Pittsburgh. In 1908
the Scio College of Pharmacy merged With the
school. From an abridged and intensive two
year course (Graduate in Pharmacy) require-
ments were consistently increased until in 1930
a standard four year course leading to the de-
gree of Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy was
adopted.

86

To the members of the graduation class may I
not extend greetings and felicitations. Through
a period of four college years you have under-
gone a course of study designed not only to
provide an adequate background for efficient
functioning in your ﬁeld but also one designed
to have builded within you a pattern of
thought and action leading toward self disci-
pline. If you have caught the idea that “educa-
tion is life" rather than the idea that one is
educated for life it may well be that you may
catch the added notion that education broadly
considered is a continuous process that should
go on and on as long as one has the power of
rational thinking. May I not wish for you the
ability to face your life's problem with courage
and the purpose to recognize that success in life
may safely be measured in terms of how well
one adapts onesself to his potentiality and
opportunities.

RUSSELL CONNOLLY

The Senior Award is given under the auspices of Omicron
Delta Kappa to the man who is most outstanding in his class.
Selected by a committee of faculty and alumni under the
chairmanship of the Dean of Men, he is the one who has con-
tributed most to the University in activities, character, lead-
ership, scholarship, personality, and service. The material
part of the award consists of having recipient's name placed
on a stone along a Cathedral walk. However, it is the spirit
which is important.
