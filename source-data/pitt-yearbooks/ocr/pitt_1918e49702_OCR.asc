ATHLETICS

iﬁerrhvh an the Cllnp

‘ ‘ HE present school year of 1916-1 7 will soon be a thing of the past, but

' What it has meant for the University in the way of athletics will live
on forever. At the opening of the fall term, there went into eﬂiect in
all departments of intercollegiate sports in Pitt the “one year resi-
dence rule" adopted by the Athletic Council on January I3, I915.
This event marked the placing of Panther athletics on a par with
the best universities of our country.

The excellent records made by the various athletic teams during the inaug-
ural year of the new ruling have far exceeded the hopes of Pitt followers. With
all freshmen and migratory students excluded from varsity competition, it was
to be expected that the standards of the teams would be slightly lowered. Such
was not the case, however, and the apparent ease with which the coaches turned.
out powerful teams was the pleasing feature of momentous happenings.

Without a doubt the football season was the most glorious one ever enjoyed
by a Pitt eleven. Under the coaching of All-American "Pop" Warner, the
Panthers went through another campaign without suffering a defeat. Critics and
scribes everywhere were unsparing in their praise of the team, and they hesitated
not in awarding Pitt the intercollegiate championship. The elimination of
Brown at the hands of Colgate. on the same day that Pitt trounced State, left the
title undisputed. Once more were Captain "Bob" Peck and “Pat" Herron hon-
ored by Walter Camp in his All-American selections, while Hastings, Del-lart,
Mcl_.aren and others were mentioned by many writers. -

Led by the versatile “Andy” Hastings, the basketball team took up the work
of spreading Pitt's fame where the gridders left off. Carnegie Tech, W. & _].,
Lafayette and Rutgers were conquered, but the most notable victory of all was
the one over Allegheny College. Previous to this season the Methodists have
never been vanquished by the Pittsburgh ﬁve. Owing to the inability of several

regulars to accompany the team, the eastern trip was not as successful as last
year. - Syracuse was the only opponent to win a series from the varsity. _ Individ-
ual honors went to Lubic and Hastings, while DeHart on winning his in-
signia in this branch established himself as the first athlete to earn four letters at
the University.

 

 

  

ATHLETICS

The oldest inhabitant couldn't remember a season nearly as gratifying to
Pitt adherents as the I916 Track season. Another “first time in history" was
chalked up when Coach Kerr's charges downed Penn State in a dual meet. The
W. & J. and Tech clashes proved very easy for the Blue and Cold, as did the rest

 
   

of the field in Pitt's section of the Penn Relays. With such performers as Captain '

lVlcMasters, Albright, Livermore, l-lugus and Sutherland, it was not at all sur-
prising to see the records of long standing fall.

In a year of wonders, the lone regret was the showing made by the baseball
team. Despite an excellent pitching staff and an inﬁeld of ability, the nine
couldn’t get going, with the result that out of fourteen games played, only five
were won. This spring, though, every indication points to a real Panther season.
A new coach, in the person of Walter A. Blair, who caught for several years for
the New York Americans, will be in charge, and with his ability to develop men,
a winner seems to be assured.

During the past year at the University, minor sports were given a great deal
of attention. Good results have been obtained, not so much in moulding con-
sistent winners, as in carrying out a reconstruction process with bright prospects
for the future. Swimming, wrestling and tennis, after a year in the making, are
due for worthy accomplishments in this ﬁeld.

As a natural outgrowth of the one year rule, freshmen athletics were put on
a higher level than ever before. Since the new ruling went into effect a most
powerful football eleven and the fastest plebe ﬁve in this section have been de-
veloped. With “Chalky" Williamson in the capacity of coach, the chances for a
good baseball team among the yearlings are fine.

Activities in Co—ed sports have gone merrily forward with Laura Hammer
France at the helm. Like unto Warner’s crew, the girls’ basketball team romped
through its second season undefeated to the championship of Western Pennsyl-
vania. There is a first year squad, and they, too, have made an enviable record.
Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the girls and their coach for the able
manner in which they have upheld the athletic honor of the University.

COACH WARNER CAPTAIN PECK MANAGER THOMPSON

"  UST at dusk on last Thanksgiving Day, when "Tiny" Maxwell's shrill

 

The schedule for the year was an unusually hard one, and offered the Syra-
cuse eleven as another new Eastern opponent. Despite the strength of the oppos-
ing teams, Pittsburgh came through victorious in easy fashion. Navy, Syracuse,
Penn, W. &  and State were met and vanquished. With the exception of the
Navy encounter, the scores were decisive and left no room to doubt Pitt's supremacy.

The brilliant record made by the team can be attributed to the wonderful,
smashing attack and the stiff defense planned by Warner. Simple plays, -that were
certain ground gainers when carried out properly, made up the backbone of a
bewildering repertoire. Team play with clock-like precision was perfected. Each
man had a place in every play, and he saw to it that he performed his duty. So
well was this done that everywhere scribes marveled at Pittsburglfs interfer-
ence. After seeing Syracuse trampled in the mire by the Pitt onslaught, Walter
Camp, the distinguished football authority said: “This team play is perfect.
They are a most wonderful team. Pitt is a marvelous combination." . IL.

While the team was essentially a perfectly balanced unit, with every man a 6
star of the first water, the work of several players in particular stood out for ex-
ceptional -brilliancy. Captain “Bob” Peck, for the second consecutive year,
fought himself into Mr. Camp's first All-American team as center, and "Pat”

whistle brought an end to the State game, the Panther team

niﬁcent feat of winning the undisputed championship of the
Intercollegiate world, and had at last assumed the position to which
she was so richly deserving.

Herron was again placed at end on the second eleven. Various writers picked
"Andy" Hastings as one of two best halfbacks, which honor he fully merited.
All the other regulars, DeHart, McLaren and the rest, displayed great ability
throughout the season, and were on numerous selections and honor rolls. It is
small wonder that, with this galaxy of stars, a championship was captured.

Something that must be mentioned in connection with the success of the var-
sity is the caliber of the reserves. Men were kept on the bench most of the time
who would have been regulars on any other college team. Such men as Cougler,
McNulty, Meadows, Miller, Stahlman, Friedlander, McClelland, Stahl, Hilty,
Brown, Harrington, Ammons, Kendricks and Mclntyre would have been wel-
comed on big elevens. Coach Warner ﬁttingly stated that there were no scrubs
—that every man on the squad was of varsity material.

As wonderful and pleasant as it was, the close of the past season left a tinge
of genuine regret in that it marked the passing of the greatest man who ever
donned the moleskins at Pitt. "Bob" Peck, the clean and energetic center cap-
tain, no more will strike terror to the hearts of strong opponents. He has com-
pleted four years of faithful and invaluable service on the gridiron, during which
time he brought the first All-American recognition to Pittsburgh. it was his irre-
pressible courage and fighting spirit that led the team to the highest pinnacle of
football fame. Stars may come and stars may go, but “Bob” will be everlastingly
revered as the greatest of them all.

Three other sturdy athletes, hardly less renowned, have played their last
game with the Panthers. They, too, have seen four years of successful competi-
tion and their familiar faces will be missing when the fall comes again. “Pat"
Herron, considered by many the peer offend men, and honored twice by Camp as
second All-American, will graduate in the spring, as will Rendall Soppitt and
Claude Thornhill, two of the best linemen ever developed at Pitt. The Uni-
versity sorrowfully parts with them, not only because they will leave big gaps
in the ranks, but because they presented characters seldom met with in college
life. Ammons, Stahlman and Friedlander, famed for their persistency and grit,
have finished their courses and their absence will be mourned by many.

Before concluding this review, the gratitude of the student body must be
extended to the management, the Athletic Council and the Coaching Staff for
the efforts they have made to place Pitt athletics on the highest possible plane.
They have worked together in perfect harmony and that they have succeeded in
their endeavor is glorious history now. Surely this has been the season of seasons
for the Blue and Gold—one of which a Pittite may well feel proud. May the same
be said of yours, Captain Carlson.

PITT 57—\X/ESTMINSTER 0

In prying off the lid of the I916 season, the Gold and Blue Eleven swamped
Westminster’s gridders in a contest that was not much more than a stiff signal
workout for the varsity. The Pitt attack was driving and almost irresistible.
It showed eight touchdowns, six resultant goals and one ﬁeld goal. Hastings,
Del-lart and McLaren advanced the ball at will, as did McNulty and Gougler,
when the opportunity was given them. Many substitutions were made and every
man played up to form. It was an auspicious start for Capt. "Bob" Peck's boys.

PITT 20—U. S. NAVAL ACADEMY I9.

Arriving at Annapolis only a few hours before game time, Pitt displayed poor
form against the Middies and just managed to win out by a single point. The
long hours spent on the delayed train without breakfast had its effect on the
team, as was shown by the excessive fumbling. Despite the closeness of the score,
Pitt’s play was far superior to that of the Navy. The running attack was powerful
and overwhelmed the sturdy sailors, but several opportunities to score slipped by

  
   
   
   

on account of the loose handling of the ball. The touchdowns made by Warner's ,

proteges were all earned by straight football, while two of the Navy scores were
directly due to Pitt fumbles. Capt. Peck, Hastings, Del-lart and Soppitt excelled.
It was a costly win for Pitt inasmuch as Rendall Soppitt was injured and out for
the season.

PITT 30—SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY 0.

Outclassing the heavy Syracuse team in every department of the game,
Glenn Warner's football warriors walked off Archbold Stadium with a glorious
victory. Looming up as the first important clash of the year, and one that would
be bitterly contested, it quickly developed into mere play for the Panthers. Each
time she got the ball, the Blue and Gold began a drive which the much-touted
Hollenback line could not stop. A more powerful running attack and a stronger
defense than Pitt offered was never seen on any gridiron. Coming after the poor
showing of the previous Saturday, the game was exceedingly pleasing to Pitt
adherents. Pittsburgh presented a marvelous combination, as Walter Camp
observed, with every man a star.

PITT 20—UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA 0.

Before the largest crowd that ever witnessed a football game locally, Old
Penn staged its first appearance in Pittsburgh for years, and was humbled by the
fast going Pitt machine. The Quakers, fresh from a victory over Penn State, put
up a stubborn defense, but slowly and surely the greatest team in the country
battered its way to success. The brilliant work of Hastings and Del-lart in the
backfield and Capt. Peck on the line had much to do in conquering Penn. After
the game Coach Polwell, of Pennsylvania, said that it was no disgrace to be
beaten by a team the caliber of Pittsburgh. He praised the end play of Herron
and Carlson as the best he had ever seen.

PITT 46—ALLEGHENY COLLEGE 0.

AlIegheny’s sensational aerial attack of a year ago was missing, and Pitt
had no trouble in trouncing the Methodists on a very muddy field. The regular
team, with the exception of McLaren, who was injured, was started. McClelland
was at fullback and Cougler soon replaced Hastings, who was suffering from a
weak ankle. It was pre-eminently the reserves’ day, Gougler and Friedlander
starring on the offense. Coach Warner was at Ithaca watching Cornell play

Tech.

PITT 37—\X/ASHINGTON & JEFFERSON COLLEGE 0.

Showing an attack that was even more powerful than that uncovered in the
Penn game, the Pitt Panthers ripped" and tore their way to a brilliant victory
over their time—honored rivals from Little Washington. The drubbing handed
out to the Red and Black pleased Pitt adherents immensely because it was the
worst ever experienced by W. & _I. It can be said that in defeat they were not
disgraced, for the old ﬁghting spirit and clean play was ever present. DeHart
with his long runs and McLaren with his short line bucks gave the big crowd many
a thrill. Cougler, who was playing in Hastings’ place, and I-Ierron, at end, also
shone resplendent.

PITT l4—-CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 6.

Pitt was not up to form, while our neighbors from Schenley Park were in
fine fettle, so consequently the Panther was held to the lowest score of the season.
The failure of the Blue and Gold backﬁeld to get going was a big surprise to the
fans who expected a larger score. This was partly due to the Plaids' stubborn
defense and also to a slight condition of staleness resultant from the previous hard
games without a let-up. Tech had a wonderful team, though, and it looked as
good as any that had been met. The play was slow and long drawn out on account
of the over alertness of the officials.

PITT 3l—PENNSYLVANIA STATE COLLEGE 0.

The smashing, irresistible and smooth working offense that had made Pitt
famous was again in evidence against State. The Center County lads couldn’t
cope with the ﬁerce attack, and they went down to the worst defeat suffered from
Pitt in history. “Andy” Hastings, making his re-appearance in the lineup, was
the sensation of the day. He booted two field goals and scored a touchdown.
Capt. Peck brought his career to an end in a blaze of glory. He was here, there
and everywhere. DeHart, McLaren, Herron and Carlson also were very much
in the limelight. At the same time as the Panther was drubbing State, Brown
was being eliminated by Colgate. Pitt then had a clear claim to the Intercollegiate
football title. Verily, ’twas a day of thanks, long to be remembered by Pittites

COACH FLINT CAPTAIN HASTINGS MANAGER SCOTT

Eaaket E5111

 NCE again did Coach Flint rise to the occasion and develop a basket-

‘ ball team that reflected the athletic prowess of Pittsburgh Univer-
sity. After the sensational football season, it was typical of the
Panther upward march in sportdom to display for the critics’
approval a conquering ﬂoor combination.

On account of the football injury sustained a year ago by
Captain-elect Joe Matson which necessitated this sterling athlete's remaining out
0 SP01‘tS, a new leader for the floor representatives had to be elected. “Andy"
Hastings who had done noble deeds in the past, was chosen unanimously, and he
ﬁlled the position to perfection.

Out of nineteen games on the schedule, fourteen were won and only ﬁve were
dropped. A pair of encounters was taken from Lafayette, Carnegie Tech and
Washington & Jefferson, while Syracuse with an exceptionally strong ﬁve was
the only opponent to capture two games from Pitt. An even break ensued when
Penn State and the University of Buffalo were met. The most pleasing feature
of the season's work was the victory over Allegheny College, as it registered the
Panther's initial win against the Methodists.

The ﬁnish of the present campaign brought to a close the wonderful college
career of a wonderful athlete, Ben Lubic. During the four years he was on the
team, he engaged in eighty basketball games for the University, which resulted in
sixty-ﬁve victories and ﬁfteen defeats. Through his accurate foul shooting, Ben
himself was responsible for a score or more of the successes, and in recogition of his I:
marvelous work, the Athletic Council voted him a place in the Hall of Fame. It '
was a ﬁtting climax and an honor fully deserved by the popular Braddock youth.

At the Varsity Letter Men's Club meeting after the season's end, Frank. B.
McNulty, Dent. '|8, was elected to lead the |9l8 team.

 NIVERSITY enthusiasts were considerably disappointed with the
 showing of last year's varsity nine. Out of fourteen starts the team
was able to gather only ﬁve victories. In “Eddie” Langdon and
“Al" Hart were to be had two of the classiest pitchers in inter-
collegiate ranks, but ragged fielding and weak hitting threw the
games into the lost column. A notable instance was the Navy game
in which Langdon held the Middies without a hit, only to lose by a I—0 score.
This was the only major sport in which Pitt lost to Penn State during the
year, all three contests going to the Blue and White. Tech was beaten twice
while an even break resulted from the Lafayette series. Rain helped to put a
damper on the season by preventing both the games scheduled with W. & 
This coming season will witness a great change in the policy governing the
diamond sport. Great efforts are being made to put baseball on an equal basis
with the other major activities. The new coach, Walter Blair, has seen years of ex-
perience in the major leagues, and is skilled in handling young players. With
several new men and all of last veterans, except Capt. Beattie and Hayes, avail-
able for duty, it is felt the 1917 program will be more successful than of the

past seasons, Langdon, for three years one of the best of college twirlers, will
lead the Panther nine this spring.

COACH WALTER A. BLAIR

Walter A. Blair, the new baseball coach for l9] 7, has had diamond experience
in collegiate and professional circles for many years. He is a graduate of Buck-
nell College, where he starred on the college team there. His first professional
work was in the old Tri-State League. Later he was signed by the New York
American League team and was their first string backstop for a number of years.
After he left the big league he coached the baseball team of the University of
Maine, where he met with unusual success. This position he held before coming
to Pitt to assume charge of the destinies of Captain Langdon’s men for the I917
season.

COACH KERR CAPTAIN McMASTERS MANAGER EDSALL

Erark
 EVER before has a Blue and Cold track team accomplished so much

in a single season as was done by the squad last year. Develop-
ment in this department has been rapid in recent years, and in the
spring of I916 Coach Kerr brought his charges to a state of excellence
heretofore unknown in University history.

Signalizing the third year of Professor Andrew Kerr’s reign
as coach, the team made it memorable by winning the dual meet with Penn
State. This is the first time Pittsburgh has ever downed the Mt. Nittany re-
presentatives on the field and track, and this feat alone serves to indicate the
season's success.

Washington & Jefferson and Carnegie Tech were unusually easy victims,
while State barely nosed out the Varsity in the‘ Intercollegiate, in which the Pitt
performers secured ten firsts and a tie out of ﬁfteen events. Syracuse was the
only rival to turn back Kerr's boys, and had the meet with the Orange come
later in the season, the result here would have probably been much closer.

For the second time in more than twenty years, the Panther won its section
of the Penn relays. Burwell, Del-lart, Crumbling and Albright formed an
invincible quartet which finished well ahead of a fast field. A number of men
were entered in the Middle Atlantic A. A. U. championships, and high place was
won by several. Burwell broke the sectional record for the 60-yard dash indoors.

 Seated: Canan, McLaren, Sheehan, Captain McMasters, DeHart, Mays, Albright.
 Sitting: Crumbling, Livermore. Wigle. 

As was to be expected in such a good season, half a dozen University records
1} tell. The one mile record, which had stood since I909, was lowered by Albright,
: a freshman; “_]im" Burwell, the speedy colored lad, surpassed previous marks
I for both sprints; Livermore beat his own best time in the two mile; and Hugus
; and Sutherland set new records in the high jump and the discus throw, respec-
| tively. .
ll Captain "Lou” McMaster brought his wonderful career at the University
5 to a close by winning the ﬁnal event of the State meet, the broad jump, thus
I5 bringing victory to the school. The Sewickley boy's performance during the
: year was all the more remarkable in view of the fact that he underwent an oper-
 ation for appendicitis on March I9, the day following the Syracuse indoor meet.
In recognition of his great work during the past two seasons, “Jock" Suth-
erland, the big Scot, will lead the I917 team. With Kerr again as coach and

_ the present favorable circumstances existing, prospects for the coming spring
1 g are agaln 1nd1cat1ve of great success.

necke. With a stiffer schedule than usual on hand, and no exper-

enced material with which to work, his work was cut out for him.

From men who were entirely green at the game,the coach, by hard

work, formed a team which made a fair showing in the different
meets.

Forster, Stahl and Sutherland, three certain point winners and letter men
of last year, weren't available for this winter's squad. Reilley, last year’s leader
and the only seasoned man left, acted as captain. Collegiate matches were
engaged in with Penn State. Lehigh and Boston Tech men were also entered
in various open meets.

Working out with the team this season were several men who had earned
reputations at other institutions. Notable among these grapplers was Olson,
a former Penn mat man. He exhibited great form during the year and should
be a tower of strength a season hence. Henry and Johnson are two other men of
class ineligible by reason of the one year residence rule.

Without exaggerating in the least, it can be said that next year should wit-
ness the wrestling game at its highest point of development at Pitt. In addition
to the men who are experienced during the past season, these newcomers will be
available. From this wealth of material Coach Reinecke should have little
trouble in turning out a winner.

HE results of the I916 tennis season were quite satisfactory to the ‘
devotees of this sport. With only one letter man available at the
opening of the year, prospects weren't as bright as in former times. ‘
However, a host of likely looking men reported and worked with fine
enthusiasm for a place on the squad. Consequently a good team

was picked from the field, which finished the schedule with two
victories, two defeats and one tie.

 

No Eastern trip was taken during the year, but this spring the manager has
planned an attractive jaunt with matches scheduled with the leading univer-
sities. Great returns are expected fromthe Panthers this season, when the past
year's seasoning and experience are bound to show their effect.

Harry Seymour and E. D. Seitz; who have rendered valuable help to the
teams in the past as tennis advisers, will remain in the same relation for the
coming year. They are anxious to turn out a good team, as the schedule is the
r‘ most extensive ever taken by the University.

Among the newcomers on the team,who have shown improvement this year.
and who will be valuable next season, are Messerly, Willis, Foster, Hamilton,
Barbour, France, West, Hannum, Marlan and Finley. No college teams were
met this year on account of the Freshman rule, the annual meet with the Navy
not taking place for the same reason, so Pitt's work was confined to local A. A. U.
competition only. The following is a list of what the Team has accomplished
this season, at the Press A. A. U. meet held in the Oliver pool November 4.
The University Swimmers won the Relay Race, the team consisting of Taylor,
Love, Swope and Born.

Harry Taylor won the 40 yard back stroke race, the 80-yard medley race and
got third place in the 40-yard free style. Jack Love won the I00-yard and got
second in the 40-yard, while Born got third in the 220, and Swope third in the
I00-yard event. The Pitt team scored 3I points, getting second place.

On December 8, at the P. A. A. Gala, Pitt again captured the open relay
race, beating the P. A. A. teams from scratch. and establishing a new local record
for 200 yards. Love won the 50-yard scratch, with Taylor third. Willis getting
second in the 50-yard handicap.

On January 26, in a dual Meet with P. A. A., Harry Taylor scored three
ﬁrsts, scoring I5 points, winning the 50-yard, I00-yard and back stroke; Swope

getting third in the dive and third in the 200-yard.

Love was not eligible for this meet so Pitt lost the relay and the meet.
February I6, at P. A. A., Harry Taylor won third place in the Middle

Atlantic Association A. A. U. Breast Stroke Championship, which ,.was the
only open event on the program

On February I2, at the Swimming Instructors’ Gala, Harry Taylor won
third place in the Middle Atlantic I00-yard championship, Swope also getting
into the final heat, Messerly won second in the novice race, and Taylor won the
60-yard back stroke event from scratch.

At the P. A. C. Gala on March 29, Harry Taylor of Pitt finished fourth in
the I00-yard National A. A. U. championship, which was won by Tedd Cann, of
New York, in 55 I-5 seconds. The Relay Team won second place in that event

The signal honor of being the first student to be awarded his letter in all
four major sports rests on the shoulders of James DeHart, Col. ’l8. For three
years he has been a backﬁeld star on the football team and as such has received
his insignia in that branch of sport. During an equal period of time he has held
down the third base position on the baseball nine, for which he has been presented
with the coveted “P”. Last spring, the Reynoldsville lad ran the clashes for the
track team and was a member of the winning relay team; and by meeting the
requirements for a letter in this sport, he placed himself among the list of eligibles
for the Hall of Fame. The last winter saw "Jimmy" starring as a guard on the
basketball ﬁve. His brilliant playing warranted his receiving his insignia in this
sport, and thus he became the first recipient of the athletic "P" in each of the
four major sports. Diminutive “Jimmy” is one of the most conscientious as well
as modest workers in school, and the honor bestowed upon him is a popular
and deserving one.

COACH KERR CAPTAIN WILCOX MANAGER TRIMBLE

Zﬂmahmatt Eﬂnnthall

_ RESHMAN FOOTBALL last fall assumed an important place
. among University Athletics. With the advent of the one-year rule,
the team was put on a more representative basis than in preceding
years. As was expected, the Panther yearlings were the most
powerful in history. ’

A large squad of husky youths reported to Coach“Andy" Kerr
in the beginning; and having the advantage of practicing with the varsity un-
der Warner receiving, as it were, the coaching of two such noted .tutors, the
crew was not long in shaping into a mighty eleven. .

The schedule was in keeping with the strength of the team, such worthy
opponents as Kiski, Thiel, Bellefonte Academy, Syracuse and Penn State Fresh-
men being met. A great victory was won over Syracuse on the same day as the
big eleven swamped the Orange. The defeats by Kiski and Penn State were ex-
cusable for in both games the class of the Freshies was most apparent.

Some future varsity lights were uncovered during the course of the season
in the persons of Wilcox, Aschman, Kelly, Thomas, A. Allshouse and V. Alls-
house. Pearlman, Pitler and Burd also gave indications of future greatness. All
in all it was a ﬁne eleven and Coach Kerr is to be congratulated for the excep-
tional showing the boys made. -

. --;  S was the case in football, the Freshmen basketball team was the best
f   yet. Starting the season inauspiciously by losing to the strong
   Schenley High School ﬁve, the youngsters braced and tasted defeat
* only once thereafter. Indiana Normal, Kiski, East Liverpool High,
"‘ East Liberty Academy and the Tech Plebes were some of the routed
opponents. '

All the players were strong and fast, in fact as much so as the Varsity men.
“Bob” Penman’s work, probably stood out as the most brilliant of all, and he
seems headed for a certain berth on next year's big five. The playing of Capt.
%Vl;Clain, Reisgen, Levine and Wilcox also indicated future stardom for these
a s.

Norman Ochsenhirt, known by all Pitt followers of basketball, again coached

the first year men with his usual success, he leaving nothing to be desired in this
line.

CAPTAIN WEHMI ER MANAGER MILLER

(ﬁirlzf lﬂaraitg Eaakrthall
f OLLOWING in the footpaths of their big football brothers, the girls

Varsity basketball team, under the coaching of Laura Hammer
France and N. C. Ochsenhirt, Med.’ I9, has completed two years
on the floor without a single defeat. Last year the Pitt sextet
played seven games, losing none, and this winter they captured all
from a six-game schedule. This indeed is remarkable considering
that the foremost college representatives in Pennsylvania were met.

Adherents of women's athletics throughout the state, have marveled at the
aggressive game displayed by Mrs. France's charges. The explanation of this
lies in the fact that all the girls are fast and play best under fire. Captain Minnie
Wehmier and Grace Vohr at forwards are nearly on a par, with Miss Wehmier
probably a little more sensational. Brenda Wright plays the best guarding game,
but Sara Bonnett is not far behind her. Marie Croetzinger and Lela Lewis are
line at center and side-center, respectively, and with Ruth l-larrison,Verna Irons
and Evelyn Sutter as reserves, round out a splendid squad.

This fast combination has remained intact for two seasons, and chances are
it will be the same in l9l8, practically assuring Pitt another championship. A
vote of gratitude is extended to the girls and the coaches for the able manner in
which they have upheld the athletic reputation of Pittsburgh University.

COACH WRIGHT MANAGER GASKILL CAPTAIN STOKES

($irIa’ Zﬁrpahman Eaakvthall

HE first year girls experienced a very successful season on the ﬂoor, hav-
‘ ing won ﬁve games and lost ﬁve. The schedule, drawn up by Miss
Genevieve Gaskill, was the most extensive of any ever arranged for
a co-ed team, and many new teams were met. Miss Brenda Wright
star guard on the Varsity Girl's ﬁve, gave as much time to the
freshman girls as she could spare from her other duties, with the re-
sult that near the end of the season her proteges had attained a state of perfec-
tion in their play that five of the last seven games played were credited in the win
column.

Miss Mary Stokes stood out among the members of the team. She held
down the pivotal position and outplayed all her opponents. At forward, Miss
Grace Cilson showed an accuracy at shooting that counted many points for the
Pitt girls. The other members of the team showed signs of promise and should
provide splendid material to aid to the varsity squad next year.

MARGARET ALLEWELT

Sewickley, Pa.

Sewickley High School

Ohio Wesleyan University

W. A. A.; Y. W. C. A.

Last year's bird of wisdom, the I9I7 Owl,
predicted that Margaret would soon banish
her Wesleyan loves in a real school. Good
work, bleary eye; she now throws peanut
shells at the players with the best of them.

ROBERT W. ALLISON EA E

Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Wilkinsburg High School

A pair of glass eyes, a grin, and a look as of
ever dawning intelligence; and you know that
Bob is among those present.

ELIZABETH BATES

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Y. W. C. A.; Women's Activities Associa-

tion

The tragedy of human limitations decrees
that Elizabeth and her biographer should be
strangers. From what they say about her,
though, the loss is all the biographer's.

JOHN K. BIBBY

Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Wilkinsburg High School

Y. M. C. A.; Pitkin Club; Varsity Debate

The man of the hour; the great puzzle is
that he is still a studious recluse when Presi-
dent Wilson is in such crying need of his ser-
vices at Washington.

_I. M. DICKSON
Edgewood Park, Pa.

John has a monopoly of doing the unex-
pected. You don't see him for a while and
are about ready to conclude that he has left
for other climes when he pops around the
corner.

The ever reliable Scotchman, the popular
idol of Kingsley House, has spent four years
in the thick of things that demand fair-mind~
edness and unalloyed grit. If there was ever
a man who deserved respect as a doer of
things, run your blue pencil under the name
of Ian Forbes.

CHARLES HENRY GARLOW
Arona, Pa.
Greensburg High School
Y. M. C. A.; Prodigal Club; Pitkin Club

Introducing “Hen”. Hen conceals a likable
personality behind a pair of placid blue gray
eyes, which apparently see nothing out of the
ordinary, but know everything.

 

  

GERTRUDE IRENE GARRIsoN E R O
McKeesport, Pa.
McKeesport High School

more Oratorical Contest; Girls Glee Club
Prima Donna of the Home Concert. Thor-

Omicron Delta Kappa.

An uncrowned king in attainment, he is ac-
claimed the intellectual Colossus of the school.
His editorials in the Pitt Weekly were literary
gems. With a passion for right, he had a
power thereby and was always ready to con-
cede superiority in others. His matchless
record distinguished him as an orator, an
author and a scholar of unchallengeable pre-
eminence.

LESTER C. GILsoN QA H

Castle Shannon, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy

Pitt Players

Hats off to the astute histrionic star. He
suddenly popped into our midst when the ver-
dancy of freshman days still tinged our brows,
and even the trials of a dramatic career
haven’t dampened his original ardor.

ANNA E. GRAHAM KA (9

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Oberlin College

With her faultless features in classic repose,
she calls the Pan Hell board to order and then
the fun begins. She was especially designed
to smile in tooth paste ads but we know that
she has a far more serious career planned.

ELLA R. HILL

New Kensington, Pa.

New Kensington High School

Most cheerful of girls—splendid lunch
company. Surely has the gift of gab, and
strange to say, actually knows the right time
to use it.

EDNA J. H1ssEM
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School
Pitkin Club; Y. W. C. A.
They say she has a young minister up her

sleeve—why, Edna, what a place to banish a

nice young man. With baby doll eyes and

curly hair she still insists on being intellectual.

ALVIN H. HocH

Bellevue. Pa.

East Liberty Academy

That Hoch der Kaiser stuff and the “ ‘Bel-
levue’ Kid" have pulled on Lefty so long that
he wouldn't feel at home without them. If it
were not for that fact that we sympathize with
his aspirations for June, we would like nothing
better than to have him ﬂunk a few years, so
we could watch him grin a while longer.

HELEN HUNT, “HeIing"

Pittsburgh High School
Wilson College
Dianthian; Y. W. C. A.; W. A. A. Board;

Who is Helen? and what is she?
A bit of femininity.
With a penchant for knowing how one
should tell a hat;
With an uncanny insight
lnto Who’s Who, and Why, at Pitt;
And a motherly air of taking care of the
latest hatching of Fresh.

WILMA ST. CLAIR Huor A A A

Carnegie, Pa.

Carnegie High School

W. A. A. Classical Club

Very small—just heart high and 'stremely
business like. The recording angel of the
W. A. A. board. Possessed of an “Age of

lnnocence" expression and a persuasive voice.

JAMES F. KARCHER

Rochester, Pa.

Rochester High School

Y. M. C. A.; Biology Laboratory Assistant

The Guardian of the diplodocus. _I. F. has
had a checkered career since his matriculation
four years ago, but even the saddest prophet
never suspected him of such depravity as

‘ ere's a cute one. Keister coaxed a luxuri-

people would think her to be a rough person,
she wears a wrist watch to counteract the
fierce effect produced by said cilia.

Tall and divinely slender, and they call her
Napoleon. Why, I wonder! Add the slimness
of Irene Castle to the golden locks of Billie B.
and to these a wonderful brother and you
will have a few of her attractions.

MARGARET KISKADDEN

Etna, Pa.

Aspinwall High School

Y. W. C. A.; W. A. A.; Pitkin Club

Her sense of humor is revealed in her
twinkling eyes. The fact that she is a Latin
shalirk doesn’t keep her from being a real live
gir .

ELIZABETH KLINGENSMITH A A A
Pittsburgh. Pa.
Allegheny High School
hen she came to Pitt she was the most
digniﬁed young body but she grows more
frivolous every year. “Sans Souci"—"0hne
Sorge." Thats Betty's attitude toward life.
Imagine a lisp and a baby stare in a senior.

LADA P. LosA

Coraopolis, Pa.

Coraopolis High School

. M. C. A.; Pitkin Club

The pride of Coraopolis has sailed through
a placid career at Pitt and now with sage de-
meanor awaits the benediction and sheepskin.

REGINALD R. Mom:

Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Wilkinsburg High School

Cqlgate University

A name like that ought to be able to write
notes to Germany—suave, imposing-, dignified
and diplomatic. We could rave about it for
a vacation; wonder if it ﬁts him.

VIVIEN B. MooL
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Ben Avon High School
Y. W. C. A.; W. A. A.; Pitkin Club
Imagine a Latin teacher 4 ft. 1 ! in. in
height! Try high heels and tall hair dressing,

Small One! Why will those little things go in ‘

for ancient languages and science.

MARGARET MUIR, _]R.

Duquesne, Pa.

Duquesne High School

W. A. A. '

One of those interesting cases where a little
tomboy girl grows into a stunning and indi-
vidual young woman. "Oh OhOhOhOh—
those eyes!" Her boyish propensities are
still traceable; her selection of courses for sci-
ence is her specialty.

EDITH ALICA MUSSER KA 8

Altoona, Pa.

Altoona High School

W. A. A.; Y. W. C. A.; Student Senate

Her mannish taste in clothes and courses
quite belies her innate femininity. Though an
exemplary student she still manages to keep
up a busy social life, house parties being the
specialty.

VICTOR E. NICKLAS

Evans City, Pa.

Thiel College

It's a long jump from Evans City to Thiel
College, but the leap from Thiel to Pitt we
claim can only be done by a professional
athlete. Some stretch; will the “Nickle" stand
the strain?

J. A. MCCURDY

Jeannette, Pa.

Lafayette College

McCurdy is not our roommate so we can't
tell you any secrets about him. But we once
knew another "jumper" from Lafayette, and
we'll let Mac by on his predecessor's reputa-
txon.

PHILIP F. MCNALLY A E <I>

Homestead, Pa.

Homestead High School

Wrestling Squad; Pitt Players

McNally is one of those chaps whose genu-
ine talent doesn't display itself until you know
him for about three years; after that you
haVen’t time enough left in which to appre-
ciate him.

MARY C. NAIL

Verona, Pa.

Verona High School

W. A. A.

The most elusive senior-—she must have her
quarters over in Thaw Hall or some of those
out-of-the—way places. But she is known by
her wor!<s—some student.

A. C. OCKENDEN

Sewickley, Pa.

University College Southampton

Versatility in the original. For hours he
can regale you with learned discourses on
philosophy and similar light readings—and
that night trip off the light foot stuff with the
best of them.

PENNOCK H. ORR

One good bet against the brunettes being
the most proﬁcient man-killers. The little

with the appealing air.

GEORGE O. REEMSNYDER
New Haven, Conn.
New Haven High School
Carnegie Institute of Technology
Y. M. C. A.; Pitkin Club; Student Volun-

teer Association

The last time we heard deﬁnite news of
Reemy, he was headed for the Theological
Seminary; it is our devout hope that the cares
of this world have in no way deterred him
from his praiseworthy mission.

joE F. REPLOGLE
Oakmont. Pa.
Altoona High School
Oakmont High School

No matter how often you see Joe, the more
you see him the better you like him. The
best of it is, that you would like him even if
he wasn't an artist par excellence on the cello
and lived in Oakmont.

T. G. REYNOLDS
McKeesport, Pa.
McKeesport High School

The pompous doctrinaire from the Tube
City. He is digniﬁed and still after four
years of college life retains that permissible
quality.

GEORGE A. RIZNER
McKees Rocks, Pa.
Coraopolis High School

Boys, bring on your rubber tired carriages,
and drag out the crape. After rejoicing our
hearts for four grateful years the darling of
McKees Rocks is contemplating packing his
trunk and taking a Pullman back to his native
haunts.

EDWARD M. SCHAULE

Schaule don’t wear glasses, is guiltless of all

profane attemptsat mustachios, and has never,

to the best of our knowledge, committed mur-
der. In spite of these deﬁciencies we like him.

JACOB LYON SIGAL
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School
Student Chemical Society; Student Senate

A howl of protest is lifted to the sky from
the mobs of assembled students. For you to
disdainfully leave us and essay to glide
through the medical school with your usual
ﬂippant ease, was bad enough; but, Sigal, oh,
Sigal, why did you have to exercise those un-
canny wits of yours, and leave us in the lurch
by graduating in three and one half years?
For this crime Jacob Lyon is mud———

but it is all ready for you and is wrapped up in

a little paper roll that Dr. Linhart is thinking
of giving you next Commencement Day.

EARL F. WILSON

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Y. M. C. A.

Earl is a man of vicarious duties. Part of
the time he studies, and part of the time he
—doesn't. We wouldn't get so mad about
it but he’s got it all over the rest of us at both
of them. Never mind, Earl, you may be
smarter than we are, but we get our diploma
ﬁrst; our name comes before yours.

Milwaukee, Wis.

Wauwatosa High School

Women's Activities Association

To tell the truth, Dot has a whole lot more nicknarr es, such as Dolly, Jimmy, Dodo,
Dee, et cetera, so we'll put them all in and you can take your choice. We know it sounds
improbable, but she just loves American Political History. Outside of that she is very
normal, although she doesn't like publicity.

GORDON ENDERS

Pittsburgh, Pa.

We would give half of our inheritance to attempt a pungent pun on Enders. but we're
so fearfully certain that the things been done before that we can't muster the nerve.

ISADOR FELDSTEIN

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School

Boys, if we all could make A's like Izzy can roll those pool balls, we would have grad-
uated the year after him instead of the year before. lzzy always eyes the boys up with
his cold stare before he tips them off to his new hunches.

WILLIAM R. JAMES, “Tuck"

Charleroi, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy

Glee Club; Chemical Society

Tuck acquired the gentle art of singing while blowing glass in a factory near Charleroi.
To the best of our knowledge, we believe he would be a real chemist if he would devote
as much time to his studies as he does to that old Corn-Cob.

chances. Is not a socialist but his motto is l. W. W. Since he is one of the controlling

Jim is not very well acquainted with the luminaries of Chemistry. Being a large mole-
cule (molar weight 206) his inertia is correspondingly great, consequently he's hard to
stop once he gets started. When traveling to Meadville he applies the geometrical pro-
position that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points. He reveres the
name of Lincoln.

"Bluey" can always see the funny side of
anything and we often envy him, for life seems
to have no worries for him.

WILLIAM EARL Bocx, "Bill"

Kockey Club

Although Bill never divulges any family
secrets, yet we never knew that he was such a
practical economist until he pulled that speech
at the Economics banquet. However, it was
just the forerunner of his future life.

ROBERT BODEN, "Bob" <11 A (9
Burnham, Pa.
Yeagertown High School
Gettysburg

After having been exposed to Bob for two
years, we cannot help but wish that he had
come to us first instead of wasting two years
at Gettysburg. Can readily understand why
he always has another engagement.

How one man can hold down this list of
activities and still complete enough work in
less than four years is a mystery to all of us;
and yet he does it as complacently and as well
as he leads Pitt’s singers through an Opus of
Grieg.

President International Polity Club; Social

“Eppy"' ﬁl’SlI gained publicity in connection
with the Oscar II and later by his ardent oppo-
sition to militarism. In spite of his socialistic

‘ideas, we all respect his knowledge and ability.

WILLIAM CHRIST FICHTNER, “_/eﬂ"

Jeannette High School

As the ‘‘Jeff'’ of the West-Fichtner combi-
nation, Billy has attracted considerable at-
tention on the campus; but his modesty has
robbed many of the value of his acquaintance.

FORREST F. FRANCE, "Baldy" A T 9

To the uninitiated, France seems as meek
.and as gentle as a lamb; but one day in class
with this representative of the Buckeye State
puts you on your guard and you are not sur-
prised at anything that might happen.

We are afraid Al (not Alice) will have to
take P. G. work if the Cap and Gown Club
wishes to have a show next year, for the show
must have a leading lady. Our previous
knowledge was all that saved us from being

More than an ordinary hustler. After hav-

last semester.

PENNOCK H. ORR E (D

Although a new acquisition to the class, Orr
has made a decidedly favorable impression on

The man who put Lock Haven and Pitts-

“Bill” is every inch 21 man, which explains

Edison has nothing on Baker when it comes to economizing in the matter of sleep.

Bix can hardly be accused of wearing out the University's furniture but on his occa-

IoNE AUSTRAW A A A

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Derry High School

Hood College

Classical Club; Y. W. C. A.

A new senior in our midst. We like her so
well that we wish she were a Freshman—that
would make her twin with Vera in truth as
well as in dress.

LOUISE BORLAND KA ®

Braddock, Pa.

Braddock High School

Lucky Thirteen; W. A. A.

Lou is little and cute and ﬂossy-looking, but
she is not so frivolous as she looks. There is
a lot of gray matter in her ﬂaxen head. The
very best company you could ﬁnd when you
want to be entertained.

KATHERINE SELL BORTZ Z TA

Greensburg, Pa.

Greensburgh High School

W. A. A.

Kay is only partly with us—her heart went
traveling westward some few weeks ago; but
then, what's the diff?—there's a perfectly
good one left in its place.

ALPHA HELEN BURKART Z TA AA N

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

Lucky Thirteen; Senate (4); Executive

Board.

A girl of personality and charm that you
can't resist, though till you truly know her,
you may hold her a wee bit in awe. You see,
she knows so much and does so may more
things than the ordinary girl, sings, plays, re-
cites, dances. is brilliant and good-looking.
She is everything that is excellent—in woman.

ANNABEL COOPER

Falls Creek, Pa.

Clarion Normal

A “regular" student——actually worries if
she hasn't done the advised outside readings.

ISABEL EYLER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

W. A. A.

Blondeand serious is Isabel. And very
reticent about her affairs. But we do know

that Public Speaking is her P. A.

EDUCATION

REGINA HAUPT
Homestead, Pa.
Homestead High School
W. A. A.

One of those inexplicable girls who likes
Math. and such awful things—a regular shark.
None can put anything over on Gina: she
knows how to stand up for her rights.

DAVID CLICK

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

U. S. Naval Academy

A sailor boy who will be in more demand
than ever if the Germans get too familiar.
Has acquired much nerve and courage in edu-
cational visits to Homestead.

MARGARET HEAZLETT K H

Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Wilkinsburg High School

Y. W. C. A.; W. A. A.

Teaches sewing at Dormont school. She
don't like kids with cork screw curls and sim-
pering smiles, and she don't like to travel on
three street cars and a train to practice teach-
ing. Isn't that odd?

RUTH HocAN A A A

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Assistant frog cutter up at Schenley High.
Another of our Pitt Co-eds that has a warm
spot for Tech.

_]AcoB KwALwAssER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

Oh well, you are not supposed to pronounce
his name, so why worry? Just call him Jake
and succumb to the joy of listening to his
wonderful music, for he's our Pitt Paderewski.

LUCILLE LEoNE LEWIS Z TA

Edgewood, Pa.

Edgewood High School
Y. W. C. A.

Lucy is a very distinguished woman—yes'm,
she's had appendicitis! She's one of those
frail little mortals who looks as if a breath
would blow her away, but don't fool yourself,
she can go to fraternity house parties and
dance five nights in succession and still look
nice.

EDITH ELIZA MATTHEWS AA N K H

New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School

Senate (4); Department Editor Pitt Weekly

The Dean was disappointed that there was
no man on the school Senate until he found
that Edith was a senior member——"I'd as
soon have her as two men." She can do more
things and more efficiently than any other girl
in school.

 

    

lVlYRA EVELYN McBR1I:E Z TA

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Indiana State Normal

Y. W. C. A.; Athletic Council

Myra is "Aetna—izing" these days——no, not
insuring her life, merely insuring her future
livelihood in the manner of School of Ed.
Seniors. But really, I don’t think Myra need
worry her head about that—what's the use
when one has a voice and good looks.

MARTHA MCNARY Z TA
Canonsburg, Pa.
Canonsburg High School
W A A

You think she looks like a serious minded
practice teacher—that’s just her Oakdale look-
She can be as frivolous and ﬂirty as any when
she chooses. Very much interested in Texas.
A Texas University pin and a daily letter post.
marked Dallas-—we're getting considerable
worried!

CLARA LOUISE MICHEL

Parnassus, Pa.

Parnassus High School

Says she has no activities except practice
teaching. Well, that ought to keep her pretty
active.

MARY LoUIsE lVlOYE Z TA A A N

Knoxville Union High

Captain Co-Ed. Lou spends week-ends at
Wheeling and charges camisoles on her bach-

lieve she is a senior, but she's on the Com-

No. she is no relation to Swansdown sugar
except in the quality of sweetness. One of
our English teachers said it was insipid to
describe a girl as sweet, so perhaps Anna wont
consider that a compliment.

@112 Alumni Aaanriatinn

The year 1916-1917 was one of advancement in alumni activities and grad-
ually this important feature of Pitt’s organization is being strengthened to a point
where it will be a powerful agency for the upbuilding of the University.

The most important work done was the publishing of a Directory of former
students, this including not only those who received degrees. but those who were
enrolled for any length of time. The Directory, which has 350 pages, contains
the names of about 8,500 Pittites and is of untold value to the University and
Alumni authorities. One thousand copies were published and the majority are
now in circulation. lt is the intention to revise the Directory annually in future,
there having been no revision since 1910, when the first general Directory was
gotten out under the direction of Professor Alexander Silverman, '02.

With the Directory as a foundation for effective work, 'a campaign for 500
members was held during the month of April and was very successful. As a
result the membership of the Association has been increased to almost 2,000, as

compared with 300 two _years ago. Two hundred workers participated in the
campaign, the captains being as follows: '

A. K. Collingwood, Ec. '16; Harold 5. Downing, Col. '15; Dr. S. D. Emrick,
Dent. '10; Prof. C. R. Foster, Ed. '1 1;  Steele Cow, Col. '16; Robert E. Grove,
Ec. '14; W. D. Hockensmith, Engr. '01 ; John W. W. Hallock, Engr. '12; Laurence
B. Hurst, Col. '02, Law, '05; Dr. A. F. Judd, Phar. ’95; Robert W. Kiser, Col. ’01;
W. C. MacQuown, Engr. '13; Dean H. B. Meller, Mines, '10; Roland A. Mccrady,
Ec. '11, Law ’14; Dr. P. V. lVlcParland, Dent. '04;  C. Quick, Ec. ’13; Floyd
Rose, Col. '96, Mines ’1 1; John  O'Connor, _]r., Col. '10; Bertrand H. Smyers,
Col. '93; Prof. Alexander Silverman, Col. '02.

All the Pitt alumni and undergraduate clubs had banquets during the year
and these resulted in bringing many new members into the Association. New
clubs were formed at Johnstown, Pa., Youngstown, 0., and the Kiski Valley,
making a total of eight such organizations. A number of additional clubs will
be formed before the year is over, one being in New York city.

 

 

 

 

ALUMNI

The I916 Commencement season was a very active one for the Alumni.
Class reunions were held, the Alumni baseball team engaged the varsity in a game
on Trees ﬁeld, and the Commencement day banquet was the best ever held.
The toastmaster was T. H. B. McKnight, Assoc. Col. ’80, a member of the Board
of Trustees. Among the speakers was Rev. Dr. John R. Wightman, ’65, who
was the first secretary of the University Alumni Association. The Rev. Dr.
John H. McCandless, '64, the first secretary—treasurer of the Association, was
given the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity at the Commencement exercises.

The publicity work of the Alumni Association was well taken care of in the
"Pitt Weekly," a full page being devoted, as usual, to this feature. During the
April campaign, the "Weekly" space was increased to two pages and free copies
sent to all non—members. This helped to increase interest.

The “Varsity Letter Club,” with membership including alumni and students
who had won the varsity athletic insignia at W. U. P. and Pitt, held an enthusi-
astic meeting in March. Officers were elected as follows: President, Dr. A. B.
Wallagren, Med. ’02; Vice-President, Dr. C. C. Marshall, Med. '08; Secretary-
Treasurer, Robert E. Grove, Ec. 'l4.

Two of Pitt's oldest and most noted alumni died during the year, one being

  

the Hon. George W. Guthrie, '66, American Ambassador to Japan, and the_

other being the Rev. Joseph Horner, '49, who, up to that time, was the oldest
living alumnus of the University. A. W. Pentland, of Washington, D. C., is
now the only surviving member of the class of I849, and is Pitt's oldest living
graduate. He is in fairly good health and has communicated on several occasions
during the year with the Alumni oﬂice.

Alumni took an active part in undergraduate affairs during the year, in a
supervising capacity. Many of the Alumni spoke before student clubs and
organizations, and assisted in the businessmanagement of their affairs. All this
tenéied to create a commendable spirit of co-operation between alumni and
stu ents. ‘

Membership in the General Association is of three classes: Regular, Asso-
ciate and Honorary. Annual dues of Regular and Associate members are $2.00,
which includes a free subscription to the "Pitt Weekly.” Life Membership dues
are $50.00 for these classes.

The Alumni Council is the executive body of the General Alumni Association
and is composed of fifty members, two from the ten different schools of the
University and thirty elected at large. Regular meetings are held on the third
Monday of March, May, October and December. The annual meeting of the
General Alumni Association is held in June. The meetings of Alumni Council
are held, following the custom inaugurated in l9l5, at the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association, dinner being served before the Council went into session. The
attendance was large at all meetings and members took an increased interest in
all activities,

This song will upward go:

When the grand old days of football come around,
In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

Her rooters at the ﬁeld will make an awful sound,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh.

Down across the ﬁeld her mighty line moves on,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

They’ll sweep the foe before them till the goal is won
Then you'll hear them shout:

CHORUS.

Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! every loyal son,

Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! 'til the victory's won,
The Gold and Blue shall wave forever

On high, through fair and stormy weather,
We'll sing her praises far and wide

Until the end of time.

Hoop-hurray! Hoop—hurray for dear old Uni,

Give her a grand old Alleghenee-genac-genac,
We’ll wave and cheer for many a year

And sing her songs out loud and clear,
For our University.

We who have followed her beacon light
And marched ’neath her banner fair,
Sing of her fame in the days gone by
And the glory the years have brought Her;
Her colors we wear, Her honors we share,
Then sing till the winds reply:

Far from Thy shrine we be,

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,

Child of Light and Bride of Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,

Dowered with eternal youth,

Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore,

Dear old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

Cod preserve Thee evermore!

First beyond the mountains founded,
Where the West-road opens free,
Where twin rivers forest bounded,
Merge and journey toward the sea,
In the dawning of the nation

Ere the clouds of strife had cleared,
’Rose Thy rough-hewn habitation,
By our prophet fathers reared.

Close Thy mother-love embraces

All who gather at Thy knee

Caste and classes, creeds and races,
Mother, are as one to Thee;

Thou who unto knowledge bore us

In the good old days long gone,

Raise Thy Gold and Blue high o’er us

Lead and we will follow on.

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,

Ah, how well do I recall, t’was a clay in yester fall
When the North wind warns our B. V. [).’s to store,

Then methinks I heard a, tapping, maybe but a rapping,
Rapping on some Freshman door.

And the D. T. quoted "Evermore.”

FOUNDED . . . ‘ . . . . By Sapho

Do you observe that intellectual group of young ladies before the camera
now? That is the anarchistic organization of Pitt. The big plan is to show up
the profs and those secure fame and low marks. When Helen Howard, Mary
Sanner and associates, pour, you should not ask for cream-—it isn't being done
this year.

We are not strong for dancing ;
For the giddy, gabby prancing,
And for fussing we are much too bright.
But it seems that girls’ looks
Are prized more highly than are books,
Which doesn't seem to us to be quite right.

Some day the young frails at Pitt will look at a daguerreotype of Irene Car-

Even so, the girls are some little prospectives.

Peg and Irene sweetly trill,

Janet debates, and is never still.
The others look on in mild amaze,
And so fly by the happy days.

Or the daffodils are growing

You can hear the sounds of rolling dice.
And you'd think there was killing,
With the victims all quite willing,
Crying, “Come on, Joe, shoot twice.”
