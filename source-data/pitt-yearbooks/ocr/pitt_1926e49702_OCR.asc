manager of the University Radio Studio,

Before coming to the University, she

Al\1UEL Black l\IcC0rmick,
Chancellor Emeritus, was ac-
tive Chancellor of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh from
1904 to 1920, when he re-

tired to his present ofﬁce. During his
sixteen years in oﬂice, the University be-
gan that remarkable growth that makes
imperative today the immediate enlarge-
ment of facilities. The name of the school
was changed from the VVestern Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania to the University of
Pittsburgh, and the campusiwas established
on the present location.

Dr. McCormick received his degree of
Bachelor of Arts from Washington and
Jefferson College in 1880, and in 1883

was awarded a Master of Arts degree from

the same institution. The degr_ee of Bachelor of Divinity was given him by the

Doctor of Laws.

R. Samuel Black Linhart,

D. D., is probably better

known to the people of Pitts-

burgh and Western Pennsyl-

vania than, any other ofﬁcial

of the University. For nearly two decades

he has served as Secretary and as Profes-

sor in the History of Religion and Ethics.

He came here in that dual capacity in

1906, when he resigned the presidency of
Blairsville College.

In addition to his duties as Secretary
and Professor, Dr. Linhart represents the
Chancellor on the Athletic Council and on
the Advisory Board of Student Activities.
He is also Chairman of the Board of Man-
agement of the university branch of the

 first place, her work with the
women students has won her

the respect and admiration of everyone.
Secondly, she is an authority on educa-
tional psychology. Further, she is a na-
tional figure in women’s educational circles.

 

The present eﬁiciency of the Women’s
Self Government Association is largely a
result of her aid and suggestions, and the
same can be said of the ﬂourishing condi-
tion of practically every other campus or-
ganization in which women participate
exclusively. Her work has done much to
make the University more pleasant for
women students.

Student Council is the executive committee of the Student Body, the university
organization which includes all students. It is composed of five members: the President
and one other member of the Men’s Self Government Association, the President of
the Women’s Self Government Association, the Dean of Women, and the Student

I Counselor. These last two members have a voice in all matters, but no vote. A
unanimous vote of the other three is required to transact business.

_

Student Council has control of all matters relating alike to both men and women
of the Student Body, but has no authority to interfere with the duties of M. S. G. A.
and W. S. G. A. Matters falling under the immediate jurisdiction of the faculty are

also excluded from those handled by the Council. Council rulings are subject only to

‘C. "W5? 

 i).t‘£1-‘$1.3

. the vote of the students. When a petition is signed by one hundred members of the 
 Student Body, requesting a general vote on some ruling or other matter, the Council 
 must immediately hold a referendum. The result of the vote is ﬁnal, and can be 
 repealed only by another vote of the students. E‘?
 Pep-meetings and student assemblies are under the Council’s direction, and the

President presides at them as chairman. University dances, elections, Pitt Week, and
similar matters are also under its direction. These are usually conducted through

special committees, appointed by the Council.

The personnel of Student Council also composes the Student Life and Interests
Committee, a body organized to formulate rules for the regulation of the social affairs
of the University and to deal with infringements upon them. It differs from the

Council, though, in that the Dean of Women and the Student Counselor have a voting
power.

The Council was organized in the spring of 1923, when the students voted to
disband Student Senate, the existing agency of student government. The Senate was

a body of about twenty members, and was so loosely organized that it was unwieldy.

Trouble was found in centering responsibility, and practically nothing was accom-

plished. In seeking a solution, the officers of the Senate proposed the small group,
Student Council. '

The members of the first Council were Helen Webster, Willis Mellot, and
Donald Couch. This group was in power_for only a few months in the spring of 1923,
but it laid the foundation for the work done since then. In 1923-24, M. M. Jaquette,
l\/Iarie Messer, and Henry Pracht took ofﬁce. Jaquette resigned before the end of the
year, and was succeeded by George Lynch. This year, 1924-25, Edward C. Smyers
has been president, Mary Dodds, Secretary, and Lawrence E. Irwin, Treasurer.

During the year 1924-25, the members of the Council arrived at the decision that
three was not a suﬂiciently representative number to decide matters that would bind
the whole student body. The organization of the l\'Ien’s‘Self Government Association
created another difhculty. Frequently, legislature originating with the men’s govern—
ing body affected both men and women students, and favorable action from the Council
was necessary before it could become operative. This meant loss of time and much
inconvenience. Consequently, the Council proposed that its powers be merged with

those of Rd. S. G. A. in a group that would include both men and women representa— ‘

‘Lives, and that would have sole legislative power in all matters not pertaining to women
alone. This was adopted by the Student Body, and goes into effect in the fall of 1925.
It is composed of fifteen students: eleven men and four women. The men are elected
in the same manner as for the former l\I. S. G. A., and the women are chosen by

/I/1en’»5 Student Government A/55ocz'atz'on

A new plan of government for men students, involving representation from each
of the six undergraduate schools, from each of the four major activity divisions, and
from the faculty, was adopted at the annual spring elections, May 16, 1924. The
governing body was elected October 17, and was organized October 23. It has
governed for the men students since that time.

This new organization grew out of a meeting called early in 1924 by the
Chancellor and Mr. B. F. Ashe, Student Counselor, to consider a more representative
and efficient method of governing the men students. A committee composed of Ira
Hill, George Lynch, Charles Milliken, Luke Patrick, and John Stewart was appointed
to propose the new system. They ﬁnally adopted what was known as the “O. D. K.”
plan, which was adopted later by the students.

A council of ﬁfteen was planned, eleven students and four faculty members.
The chairman was to be elected by the student body at large, and each of the six
undergraduate schools was to choose one representative. The other four students were
to be elected from students nominated by the University Editor, the Graduate Manager
of Student Activities, the Graduate Manager of Athletics, and the Student Counselor,
to represent publications, minor activities, athletics, and dramatics and music. The
faculty representatives were to be appointed by the Chancellor.

In the elections, Edward Smyers was chosen chairman of the governing body, and
the following men represented schools: Donald Brown, the College; W. P. Geiser,
School of Engineering; E. H. Todd, School of Mines; Clare B. Book, Education;
Ralph S. Meeder, Business Administration; and W. G. S. McKee, Dental _School.

Marsh Johnson was elected to represent athletics; Laurence Irwin, to represent
publications; George VVhite, dramatics and musical clubs; and  F. W. Pearson,
minor activities.

The Chancellor selected the following faculty representatives: John Weber.
associate professor of mechanical engineering; Howard C. Kidd, professor of foreign
trade; B. F. Ashe, Student Counselor; and Dr. A. C. Young, assistant professor of
crown bridgework in the Dental School.

“Whatever you care to make your business is your business,” was Chancellor
Bowman’s statement at the organization meeting.  F. W. Pearson was elected
Secretary, and committees were appointed to consider ‘the business which had been
piling up since the first of the year. President Smyers and Laurence Irwin were
elected to Student Council, and W. G. S. McKee and Donald Brown became student
representatives on the Advisory Board. Clare B. Book was made Treasurer.

Later in the year, _I. F. \V. Pearson, Secretary, resigned to join the Beebe expedi-
tion to the Sargasso Sea. Anthony VV. Smith, llI., was chosen to fill his position on
the governing body, and Geiser was elected to fill his position as secretary. lﬂarsh
Johnson also resigned, Zoner VVissinger taking his place. Of the faculty representa-
tives, VV. Don Harrison was chosen to fill the vacancy caused by the absence of

B. F. Ashe.

During the year, everything that was done showed the necessity for some better
method of cooperation between the men and women. To accomplish this, a combined
governing body was suggested and was submitted to student vote.

Its adoption means that lVI. S. G. A., as a separate organization, will not function
after June, 1925.

It was instrumental in arranging a worth-while series of university assemblies for
the year of 1925-26, and registered student opinion in recommending-a senior. instead
of a junior Owl.

The organization has been criticised for not accomplishing much. Since student
government had been weak for so many years, the new body had no precedent to
follow in determining its powers and in planning its work. lVIuch, however, was
accomplished in laying a foundation for a better government. Among the more
important actions taken by the body were the new system of electing a separate class
organization in each of the schools, the proposed plan for the enlarged student council,
and the reestablishment of freshmen regulations.

W omen’: Self Government z45s0ezatz'on

The women students of the University govern themselves through the VVomen’s
Self Government Association, familiarly known as “VV. S. G. A.” Its purpose is to
foster a spirit of unity and loyalty to the University; to maintain high standards of
academic and social life by increasing the sense of individual responsibility; and to
iegulate all matters pertaining to the student life of its members, including those
matters which may be referred to it by the faculty, and excluding those which fall
under the immediate jurisdiction of the faculty.

All undergraduate women are members of the Association. For purposes of
information, recreation, and discussion, they are divided into organized units of thirty
each. The whole association is governed by three agencies, executive, legislative, and
judicial.

The executive power is vested in an executive committee, consisting of the four
elected officers, four unit captains, the Dean of Women, and two faculty advisors. No
Vote is given the Dean or the faculty members. A body known as the Commission
legislates. It consists of all members of the Executive Committee; one woman commis-
sioner each from the Evening Division, and the Schools of Law, Medicine, Dentistry,
and Pharmacy; one commissioner from each of the recognized activities composed
solely of women; the chairmen of the Association’s eight standing committees; one
commissioner from the Alumnae; and one commissioner from the Women's Association.

W. S. G. A. looks out for the proper use and equipment of the women’s rest
rooms in all the University's buildings through the Women’s Rooms Committee; it
maintains through the Student Loan Committee a permanent fundfrom which any
needy girl may borrow; its Vocational Guidance Committee assists the Dean of
VVomen each year in conducting a Vocational Conference for women. Housing
standards and conditions for women students‘ are under the supervision of another
committee, and the Activities Committee attempts to interest every _co—ed in some
activity. .The Committee on Scholastic Honors is the youngest in the Association.
It studies student cooperation in educational methods at other schools, and suggests
how it may be applied in the University of Pittsburgh. ‘

Its central position in the University has never been lost during the periods of
expansion. It is the nucleus to which the other schools and departments have been
added. Their dependence on the College is shown in the fact that all but one require

T he Schools of Engineering and Mines

ENDING men into every field
of endeavor in the engineering
and mining professions, the

, v— School of Engineering and the
School of lﬂines have gained a nation-wide
reputation. The School of Engineering is
one of the oldest schools of its kind, and
its system of requiring students to put their
theories to practice in industrial plants of
the Pittsburgh district while they are still
in school, has been adopted by other schools
throughout the country. In the School of
Mines, the courses in Oil and Gas Produ-
cation are equaled nowhere.

Two engineering degrees were granted
by the University in 18-1-2, but it was not
until the early 60’s that a department of
engineering was established. This later became the School of Engineering.

 

F1'edem'(: L. Bishop

The founding of the School of Mines came in 1895, through an act of the State
Legislature. A sum of money was appropriated to the Trustees “for the purpose of
establishing in connection with the Engineering School . . . a department to be known
as the Western Pennsylvania School of Mines and Mining Engineering, the object of
which shall be to thoroughly educate capable young men in the principles and art of
mining and mining engineering in the region included within the oil, gas, and bitu1ni—

nous coal fields of this Commonwealth.”

It is perhaps due more to the careful administration of the two schools than to any
other one thing that they have been so successful. Early progress in the School of
Engineering was largely due to one man, Professor Daniel Carhart, who raised the

School to a position among the best in the country during his twenty—six years as Dean.

Dean Frederic Lendall Bishop, Ph.D., head of both schools, took up the work in
the Engineering School in 1909, and in 1923 took over the School of l\Iines. He is
a Fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member
of the Highway Education Board. For eleven years he has been editor of the Journal
of Engineering Education. In recognition of his attainments, President Coolidge
recently appointed him to a delegation of seven men to represent the United States
at the Pan-American Highways Conference to be held at Buenos Aires in October,
1925.

The original schools were called into
existence by the demands of business men
for college trained executives. It was real-
ized that the college graduate entering
business without some special preparation suffers a severe handicap, and that special-
 ization upon the fundamentals of business can be of great value. Since the courses
were designed to this end, they were given full cooperation by the business men of
the district, and the two schools soon developed into important training centers for
men and women about to enter the business World.

To coordinate the work of both schools and to bring them under the same admin-
istration, they were consolidated in the summer of 1923. At the same time, the
Board of Trustees announced the appointment of Dr. Louis K. Manley as Dean.
During the first year under the new arrangement, 318 students were enrolled in the
day division and 1930 in the evening division.

This evening division is doing a unique and valuable service to the community.
in it are enrolled students unable to attend the day courses because of the necessity
of employment. The instruction, which is given in the Chamber of Commerce
building, is of the same content and scope as that of the day division, and has the
added value of being applied in most cases to the daily activities of those who receive it.

Dean Louis K. Manley, formerly head of the Political Science Department in the
College, has a national reputation, not only as a leader in the field of business educa-
tion, but also as a political scientist. He has probably talked before more business.
civic, and professional organizations than any other man in the University.

 The School of Education offered its first courses in the Summer Session of 1910, 
‘rj and enrolled its first regular undergraduates in September of that year. Eight seniors, H}
 four juniors, and seventy—one unclassiﬁed students were registered the first year, 
fﬁl, including the evening and Saturday classes. The faculty included the dean, one 
5? professor, and two part—time instructors. At the present time, the School is one of 
 the largest university schools of education in the country with almost fourteen hun— 
‘."""é] dred students and a faculty of thirty.

gration. This work is aided by the F rick Educational Commission which awards
free scholarships to a number of students from the Pittsburgh district. A special

 department for religious education is also maintained. Its program is one in which 
la the social studies are used in the reconstruction of society through the dynamism of 
L}. the religious motive. In the Department of Vocational Education, teachers are E;
 trained for trade, vocational, and vocational home economics classes. It is largely

 During the early part of the 1924-25 year, the School was under the direction E.

 of Professor John W. Oliver, head of the History Department, in the absence of 
 Dean George H. Reavis. Dean Reavis was later forced to resign because of illness,

and Professor Oliver was relieved of these duties when Dean Lee Paul Sieg, recently
appointed Dean of the College, femporarily took over the School of Education,

School Supervision at Indiana State University, was appointed to the position of Dean
in the last week of April.

HA; ,""' "‘\ School of Pharmacy of the 
 University of Pittsburgh. For thirty years 
5”; it has been training men for the pharma— i 
 ceutical profession, and has made this dis— 1 
"hf; trict independent of the eastern schools. ,’ 
:5‘: The origin of the School of Pharmacy‘ 
 dates back to 1878, when it was established  
 as the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy. 
 Its first sessions were held in buildings :7]
:.‘,,Q belonging to the University, but there was i 5

 until the early 60's that a department of gjyi
‘iii Pharmacy of the VVesterii University of 
 -’"“""' A~ K""” Pennsylvania. ln the year following the i 
 union. the School moved into its present building at Pride and Bluff streets. 
jejfii ln 1908 the well known Scio College of Pharmacy of Scio, Ohio, merged with  
 the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy. The students and alumni of Scio were adopted 
 by the Uiiiversity. This made the School the largest and best equipped in this part 
 of the country.

 education, the School has decided that a three-year minimum course in pharmacy will 
_=f7) more adequately equip students for successful public service. This new requirement 
 goes into effect with the entering class of 1925. Up to this time, the course has been ’i
 for two years only. It leads to the degree of Graduate in Pharmacy. '2

School of Derztzkzfry

‘HE School of Dentistry is
the largest dental school in
the world. More than one

C _ thousand students are enrolled,
and it has a faculty of one hundred instruc-
tors. Its growth has been phenomenal,
and the fact that less than one per cent of
its graduates have failed to pass the state
board examinations testifies to its standards.
In the ratings of dental schools made by
the Dental -Educational Council of Amer-

ica, the school has always been listed in
class “A.”

Before the school was opened in 1896,
dentists for Western Pennsylvania's popu-

 

lation of two million people had to receive

”- “‘“"""d F"“’“""’ their training in Philadelphia or Baltimore.
A group of local dentists and interested citizens took steps to establish a dental school
nearer home. On April 20, 1896, the first charter was granted. Probably no dental
college in America ever opened with as large a number of students as did the Pitts-
burgh Dental College, which had one hundred and eighteen matriculants the first
year.

Although the school was associated with the University from the beginning, it
was not until 1905 that it came under complete control of the University's Board of
Trustees. At this time it moved into the building at Pride and Bluff streets, now
occupied by the School of Pharmacy.

In 1912 the school moved to the Upper Dental Building on the present campus.
Eight years later the building occupied by the clinic was purchased, and an annex was
added in 1922. Arts Hall was also turned over to the school. At the present time
the facilities are lamentably inadequate.

The free dental clinic, first opened in 1897, treats more than seventy thousand
patients yearly. This work is of inestimable value to both the students and the
community. It has become so extensive that thirty-three extramural clinics are now

being operated at various hospitals and institutions throughout Western Pennsylvania. '

Dr. H. Edmund Friesell has been Dean of the Dental School since 1904-. He
is a graduate of the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery and a Fellow of the
American College of Dentists.

The lnterfraternity Council, composed of two representatives from each of the
seventeen leading social fraternities on the campus, functions to maintain close relation-
ships among the fraternities, and between the fraternities and the University. The
present Council is the result of a reorganization of a former council in 1920.

Each year the Interfraternity Council, with the cooperation of the Athletic Asso-
ciation of the University, sponsors the lnterfraternity Track and Field Contests and
the lnterfraternity Basketball Series. Visitations between fraternities have also been
arranged under its direction.

The animal lnterfraternity Ball is held under the auspices of the Council. Inter-
fraternity smokers are also given at frequent intervals throughout the year.

Semi-annually a silver loving cup, the gift of John C. Fetterman, former Dean of
Men, is awarded the fraternity in the Council that has the highest scholastic record.

The rushing and pledging of Freshmen is under the supervision of the Council.
Rules have been adopted which are followed by its members.

Alp/ta P/22° Delta

Alpha Phi Delta social fraternity was organized at Syracuse Uni-
versity in 1911. Since then it has grown with extraordinary rapid-
ity, until at the present time it now has a total enrollment of sixteen
chapters, distributed through the east and the middle west. Among
the largest and most prominent chapters are those of New York Uni-
versity, Yale, Columbia, West Virginia University, Western Reserve,
Syracuse and the University of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh Nu chapter was installed on February 4, 1923. It
was successor to the Delta Lambda Mu local, which appeared on the
campus in 1914. At the present time the fraternity has twenty-two
active members and a strong alumni group.

The badge of the fraternity is a shield displaying upon its face a
white scroll with the letters “Alpha Phi Delta” across the center.
Vertically bisecting the scroll is a gold key upon a background of deep
purple. This is mounted on a‘gold shield bordered with crown-set
pearls, with a diamond star at the top, and a ﬂaming torch cutting
the entire badge diagonally.

Unlike most social fraternities, the Nu chapter of Alpha Phi
Delta has a membership which is drawn from practically all the
schools of the University, Present active members represent the
schools of Business Administration, Dentistry, Law, Pharmacy,
Medicine and the College.

Samuel Albo, Law ’26, is the present consul of the society. Other
oﬂ‘icers include Joseph A. Rossi, pro-consul; Andrew Romito, quaes-
tor; Lawrence Purpura, tribune, and Michael E. Catanzaro, his-
torian.

Alpha Phi Alpha is made up of men of ltalian-American
parentage. '

Delta Sigma Phi was founded at the College of the City of New York in 1899.
At present, it has forty active and ten alumni chapters. The installation of a chapter
at McGill University, Montreal, Canada, has made it international.

The local chapter, Omega, was granted a charter in 1916. It had been founded
in 1914 as the Alpha Omega local fraternity. When the United States entered the
war in 1917, a majority of its members entered the service. The chapter was
revived, though, in the fall of 1919.

The pin, diamond shaped, displays the Greek letters “Delta Sigma Phi,” in gold
on a background of black. At the top is a circle of white displaying a pyramid in

green. Below is a sphinx in green.

Delta Sigma Phi has chapters at the following large schools: Pennsylvania State
College, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago, Uni-
versity of California, University of Illinois, and University of Michigan.

The oﬂicers for the current year are: W. G. S. McKee, President; Walter J.
Rome, Vice President; Floyd H. Bragdon, Secretary; and Richard P. Noll, Treasurer.

Delta T aa Delta

Delta Tau Delta was founded at Bethany College, West Virginia, in 1858 and
1859. It now has sixty-six active chapters with a membership of almost twenty thou-
sand.

chapter that had been established at the Monongahela Academy in 1861. It became
inactive in 1871, was revived in 1877, and again died in 1879. By the absorption of
a local fraternity, Alpha Alpha, it was again revived in 1914-. Alpha Alpha had been
organized for eight years.

The pin of the fraternity is a nearly square shield with concave sides, displaying
in gold the Greek initials for “Delta Tau Delta” on black enamel. Above is an eye,
below a crescent, and in each corner a star. The pledge button is black and gold.

Kappa Szgma

The Kappa Sigma fraternity was founded at the University of Virginia in 1869.
Today, there are ninety-ﬁve chapters in the United States and Canada. It has
chapters at practically every important college and university, and until a few years
ago had a larger number than any other fraternity.

The local chapter was formed through the absorption of a local fraternity, Sigma
Kappa Pi, in 1920. Sigma Kappa Pi had been organized in 1916.

The badge of Kappa Sigma is a crescent of chased gold with horns turned down-
ward and holding suspended a five pointed star enameled in black, with a narrow
border of white and gold. Within the star are the Greek letters for “Kappa Sigma,”
surrounded by a circle of jewels. At its widest part, the crescent displays the skull
and bones. To one side are crossed swords, and at the other, crossed keys.

Oﬂicers of the current year are:  Clyde Barton, G. l\4.; Walter Stryker, G. P.;

Omega Delta

The Omega Delta fraternity was founded at the University of Pittsburgh on
April 28, 1924. It was organized as a local social fraternity, and took as its purpose
the fostering of interest in high scholarship and in student activities, both athletic and
non-athletic.

To guarantee a thorough estimate of candidates as to scholastic merit and as to
their interest in activities, the fraternity adopted the policy of never bidding a student
until he had completed satisfactorily at least one semester’s work at the University.
In actual practice, no man has been rushed until his sophomore year. Bids are not
extended to men who have not maintained a “B” average in their courses, and who
have not taken part in at least one activity.

Omega Delta was recognized by the University on May 20, 1924. It has no
house, and holds its meetings in the Ruskin Apartments». The pledge pin is a plain
white triangle with a narrow gold border, and the badge is a monogram of the letters
“Omega Delta,” set with pearls.

For the ﬁrst semester of the 1924-25 school year, Omega Delta stood first in
scholarship among the forty fraternities, both men’s and women’s, at the University.
Since Omega Delta is not a member of the Interfraternity Conference, it was not
given the scholarship cup awarded each year.

J. F. W. Pearson, one of the charter members, left in the early part of 1925
with William Beebe on the Arcturus Oceanographic Expedition to the Sargasso Sea
and the Galapagos Islands as Assistant in Macroplankton.

Pl: 2' Delta T /2 eta

Phi Delta Theta was founded at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, December
2'6, 1848. There are ninety—three active chapters in American and Canadian schools.
as well as a large number of alumni clubs in the important cities.

Pennsylvania Iota, the local chapter of Phi Delta Theta, was formed by the
absorption in 1918 of Delta Sigma Pi, a local fraternity that had been founded in
1908, before the University moved to its present campus.

The badge consists of a shield with a scroll bearing the Greek letters of “Phi
Delta Theta.” A sword pierces the shield.

The early expansion of Phi Delta Theta was limited almost entirely to schools
in the Middle West. Between 1869 and 1879, the fraternity entered many southern
institutions, and during the next ten years moved eastward, completing its nationaliza-

tl0I’l.
The oﬂicers of the current year are: Robert Fleming, President; Firmin Hayman,

Reporter; William Wilkins, Treasurer; Howard Stouffer, Secretary; Harry Johnstin,
Historian; John Koedel, Steward; and John Roberts, VVarden.

Phi Gamma Delta

Phi Gamma Delta was founded in 1848 at Jefferson College, Canonsburg, Penn-
sylvania. All of its- founders were Free Masons and law students. It now has
chapters in more than sixty schools.

It was the first national fraternity at the University, having been established here
in 1863. This chapter was killed by the Civil War, as were the other fraternities of
the period, and was not revived until 1916. At the Cleveland convention of this

year, the petition of a local fraternity, Phi Zeta Phi, was accepted, and a charter
was‘ granted.

P2’ Lambda P/21'

Pi Lambda Phi was founded at Yale University, March 2], 1895. The intention
of the founders was expressed as follows :——“VVe, students pursuing courses at Ameri-
can colleges, appreciating the need of a fraternity which shall eliminate all prejudice
and sectarianism, and desirous of aﬁiliating ourselves‘ in spirit, in feeling, and in action,
do hereby associate ourselves in this Pi Lambda Phi fraternity.”

At present, the fraternity is composed of ﬁfteen chapters. Two of these are in
Canada: University of Toronto and McGill University. Other schools represented
in the chapter roll are: Cornell University, Lehigh University, University of Chicago,
University of Pennsylvania, Stevens Institute of Technology, West Virginia Univer-
sity, and the University of Michigan.

Gamma Sigma, the local fraternity that ‘grew into Gamma Sigma Chapter of
Pi Lambda Phi, was organized in 1912. May 16, 1914-, a charter was granted by
the national body. —

Officers of the year 1924-25 are: Arnold Silverman, Rex; Howard M. Silver,

Pi R/10 Delta

Pi Rho Delta fraternity was organized June 5, 1921, with twelve charter
members. School was about to close for the summer months, and these twelve students,
who had been associated in their studies and activities, decided to band together that
they might share their ideals and their social life. Recognition by university oﬂicials
was granted early in October of the same year.

As a result of its steady growth, Pi Rho Delta was admitted to the lnter-
fraternity Conference in January, l92-l.

The fraternity first occupied a house at 235 Darragh street. Armistice Day,
1924, it moved into its present home, 230 McKee Place, not far from the stadium.

The current oflicers are: William H. Knox, President; Fred Baumann, ]r.,

‘Vice President; Ralph Kuhns, Secretary; William Jeffries, Treasurer; Frederick M.

Patterson, Steward; and Julius Lange, Historian.

Sigma ﬂip/za Epsilon

Sigma Alpha Epsilon was founded in 1856 at the University of
Alabama. The fraternity was founded with the idea of expansion to
other colleges, and this work has been carried on until it now includes
ninety—ﬁve active chapters.

Pennsylvania Chi-Omicron, the local chapter, was installed
March 9, 1913. It had been organized previously as a local group,
Chi Omicron. The chapter house was originally located on DeSotO
street, and later at 4807 Baum Boulevard. December, 1920, the
present house, 244 Belleﬁeld avenue, was purchasd.

The badge is diamond-shaped, and bears on a groundwork of
black enamel the device of Minerva, with a lion crouching at her
feet, above which are the letters for “Sigma Alpha Epsilon” in gold.
Below are the letters for “Phi Alpha” on a white ground in a wreath.

Sigma‘ Chi

Sigma Chi is one of the “Miami Triad,” as the three societies originating at

Miami are frequently called, the other members being Beta Theta Pi and Phi Delta V

Theta. It was established June 28, 1855, as a protest against the artiﬁciality and
pretense found in another organization of which a majority of its founders had been

members. It now has more than seventy chapters.

Beta Theta Chapter of Sigma Chi was installed at the University in 1909.
It has had an active chapter for a greater number of consecutive years than any other
social fraternity at the University.

The badge of Sigma Chi is a cross of gold and whiteienamel. In the center _is
an elliptical plate of black displaying the letters “Sigma Chi” in gold. On the upper
arm of the cross are two crossed keys; on the right arm a scroll, and on the left an
eagle's head. On the lower arm is a pair of clasped hands above seven stars.

The ‘officers of the current year: Jason E. Stone, ]r., Consul; Norman Stewart,
Jr., Pro-Consul; Leland S. Frantz, Quaestor; Carl Colvin, Magistor; John A.
Thompson, Annotator; lwarshall H. Beatty, Tribune; and Silas E. Thompson, Editor.

Sigma Pi

Sigma Pi was founded in 1897 at Vincennes University, Indiana. It remained
a local organization until 1909, when it consolidated with four other local fraternities
_at Ohio State University, University of Illinois, Temple University, and University
of Pennsylvania.

The local, Delta Upsilon Kappa, was founded in December, 1920, and was
installed as Chi Chapter of Sigma Pi early in 1923. Until the fall of 1924, the

chapter house was located on Center avenue. It then moved into the present house,

212 North Dithridge street.

The badge is a Greek cross of gold bearing in the center an oval of blue with an
emerald between the letters “Sigma” and “Pi.” The corners of the cross display a

scroll, a balance, a wreath, and ten stars.

The officers of the current year are: Homer P. Hoffman, Sage; W. Wade King,
First Counselor; J. B. Ferguson, Second Counselor, Leland W. Hamilton, Third
Counselor; Lester L. Bartlett, Fourth Counselor; Thomas D. Chattaway, Herald;
and William S. Lampe, Correspondent.

The Theta Chi fraternity was organized at Norwich University
then located at Norwich but now at Northfield, Vermont, in 1856.
Although its constitution provided for more than one chapter, it re-
mained a local society for forty-six years. It now has forty—three
chapters.

The local chapter was organized by a group of students in the
Engineering School in 1915 under the name of Sigma Epsilon. Under
its first constitution, membership in the fraternity was limited to en-
gineering students. Before «Theta Chi was petitioned, membership
was extended to students in all other schools. In 1919, the local
became Alpha Beta Chapter of Theta Chi.

The original badge displays in gold a rattlesnake with ruby set
eye coiled with tail crossed to form a “Theta.” Today, the most
commonly used badge consists of a reduction of this badge raised on
a diamond-shaped ﬁeld of black enamel with a “Theta” above and a
“Chi” below the emblem.

The officers of the current year are: Robert S. Christie, President;
George R. White, Vice President; Marcus M. Iacquette, Secretary;
and Ralph A. Boarts, Treasurer.

The Panhellenic Association is an organization composed of one representative
from each of ﬁfteen national and two local women’s fraternities. It is the local chapter
of the National Panhellenic Association, which operates in practically every coeduca-
tional school to regulate interfraternity matters.

The first Panhellenic Association at the University of Pittsburgh was organized
in 1910. Since that time its control over the relations of its members has become

practically absolute.

The organization meets regularly once a month. Its purpose is to foster a spirit
of friendship and cooperation among the women’s social fraternities of the University,
to encourage chapters to take an active interest in all college activities, and to regulate
all matters of local interest to the fraternities.

It formulates rushing, pledging, and initiation regulations that operate for the
welfare of fraternity women. When they are disregarded, it has the power to enforce
them by withholding privileges.

Each year, the Association sponsors a formal dance for fraternity women and
their friends. It also gives recognition to the women's fraternity that averages the

highest scholarship.

A/lp/za Delta Pi

Alpha Delta Pi was founded as the Adelphian Society at Wesleyan Female
College, Macon, Georgia, May 15, 1851. In 1905, the name was changed to
Alpha Delta Phi, and in 1913, to avoid confusion with the men's fraternity of the
same name, was again changed, this time to Alpha Delta Pi. There are now thirty-
seven active chapters and thirty alumnae associations. The local chapter, Alpha Iota,

was installed February 15, 1920. Its faculty advisors are lVIrs. Montfort Jones and

Beta P/22' Alpha

Beta Phi Alpha, national social fraternity, was founded at the
University of California, Berkeley, California, on May 9, 1909.
There were six women in the initial chapter and they were selected by
the University for their ability to take part and succeed in campus life
and scholastic attainment. After a few years, the popularity of the
organization spread to other campuses and the society became national.
There are now seven chapters.

Eta Chapter, University of Pittsburgh, had its beginning Decem-
ber 29, 1920, in the form of a local society, known as Theta Gamma
Phi. The twelve girls who were charter members of the organization
were Emma Coombs Corley, Ruth McFarland, Margaret Boyd,
Lillian Mates, Florence Johnson, Sydney Haas, Verna Hoffman
Haas, Louise VVhite, Martha Bowers, Florence Turner, Roberta
Clements, and Marie McDermott.

The society remained local until the spring of 1924-, when the
national council of Beta Phi Alpha granted a charter. They were
oﬂicially initiated on May 13, 1924. The purposes of Beta Phi Alpha

are for the most part purely social in character.

In each of the societies a Mary Gordon Holway loan fund has
been established for the purpose of assisting Beta Phi Alpha women
go through school.

Chi Omega

Chi Omega was organized at the University of Arkansas, April
5, 1895. The founders were assisted in planning their organization
by Dr. Charles Richardson, a Kappa Sigma, Who, in consideration
of this service, was made the sole honorary member of the fraternity.
There are now seventy—four active chapters, with a membership of
more than ten thousand.

There are a number of alumnae chapters, each of which is active
in some cultural, social or civic service work. Outlines concerning
vocations are supplied the undergraduate chapters, and a special
effort is made by the national organization to see that each member
is fully acquainted with the vocational openings for women. The
open declaration of the fraternity is “Hellenic Culture and Christian
Ideals.” The social and civic service program conducted by the
alumnae reﬂects the latter, and the former is furthered by the Grecian

program which is a ﬁxed feature -of conventions and by the observance
of the Eleusinian festivals.

Each active chapter awards annually a prize, generally of $25,
to the woman student in its college who excels in the worlf of the
department of economics or sociology. At the University of Pitts-
burgh, the chapter gives an annual tea dance to all campus pledges,
both men and women.

The badge is a gold monogram of the letter “Chi" over the
“Omega” which displays on its arch the letters “Rho Beta Upsilon
Eta Sigma” and skull and cross bones in black. The “Chi” is set
with pearls or diamonds, no other stone being allowed.

Kappa Alpha Theta

Kappa Alpha Theta was organized at Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw
University), Greencastle, Indiana, January 27, 1870. It was the first society of
women organized with principles and methods akin to those of the Greek-letter fra-
ternities, and the first to bear a Greek-letter name. There are now ﬁfty-two active
chapters and forty-six alumnae groups.

The local chapter, Alpha Omega, first existed as a local fraternity, Pi Theta Nu.
It was the second local at the University to be granted a charter from a national fra-
ternity, and was installed December 4, 1915.

The badge is kite—shaped, having four sides. It is of black enamel, inlaid with a
white chevron, on which are displayed the letters “Kappa Alpha Theta.” Above this
are two diamond stars, and below are the letters “Alpha Omega Omicron.” The colors
are black and gold.

The strong doubts which prevailed when the fraternity organized in regard to
the advisability of higher education for women, the small number of colleges which
then admitted them to equal educational facilities‘ with men, and the difliculties which
those who availed themselves of this privilege encountered, rendered the establishment
of such an organization somewhat of an experiment.

P/12' Mu

Phi Mu fraternity was organized in its present form in 1904. It grew out of a
local society called the Philomathean which was founded at Wesleyan College, Macon,
Georgia, in 1852. The Philomathean Society was unusually inﬂuential in the South.
Both Robert E. Lee, Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate Army, and Jefferson
Davis, President of the Confederacy, were honorary members. From this one local
fraternity have sprung forty—two undergraduate chapters and twenty-two alumnae
groups. Its membership exceeds 6,000. -

The local chapter of Phi Mu, Beta Theta, was chartered in 1920. It had
originally organized as Alpha Mu local fraternity for the express purpose of petition-
ing Phi Mu.

Phi Mu operates a Healthmobile in the mountains of Georgia to do relief work
among the poor and illiterate. This was undertaken as a memorial to the mother
chapter. The fraternity also maintains the Alpha Memorial Scholarship Fund from
which loans are made to members in unfortunate circumstances.

The badge is a shield of black enamel displaying a hand holding a heart. Above
is a band of gold bearing the letters “Phi Mu,” and below is a band bearing three stars.

Chapters of Phi Mu have been established at the following schools: Hollins
College, Sophie Newcomb School, St. Mary’s College, Chevy Chase College, Belmont
College, Hardin College, Southwestern College, University of Tennessee, Randolph-
Macon Women’s College, Brenau College, Shorter College, University of New
iﬂexico, University of Maine, Knox College, Hanover College, Ohio State University,
University of Texas, University of Missouri, Whitman College, Adelphi College,
l\/Iillsaps College, Lawrence College, Iowa Wesleyan College, George Washington
University, University of Southern California, Southern Methodist University, Baker
University, University of California, University of Washington, Colby College, New
Hampshire State College, Dickinson College, University of Wisconsin, Swarthmore
College, University of Indiana, University of Syracuse, University of Pittsburgh,
University of Georgia, University of Nebraska, University of Illinois, Drake Univer-
sity, and Bucknell University.

The officers of Beta Theta Chapter for the year 1924-25 were: Pauline L. Lin-
genfelser, President; Mildred S. Kerr, Vice President; Helen E. Campbell, Recording
Secretary; Hazel R. Hamilton, Corresponding Secretary; Grace DeWalt, Treasurer;

 Pennsylvania Delta Chapter, Pi Beta Phi, was founded at the 
 University of Pittsburgh in 1918, ﬁfty-one years after the ﬁrst 
 chapter of the fraternity was installed at Monmouth College, 1867. 
 4“! Previously organized Pennsylvania chapters were Alpha, at Swarth- i 
 more, in 1892; Beta, at Bucknell, in 1895, and Gamma, at Dickinson, 
 .-3 in 1903. . 
V ,' ' 3;‘
 The national organization has sixty-eight active chapters, and 
 the fraternity has a national membership of over fourteen thousand. 
 The society is now conﬁned to collegiate institutions only, although :3
 the membership was originally divided into collegiate, associate, and 
5,5 alumnae branches. Many of the chapters were formed from local 3.:
 societies. 
Until the national convention of 1883, the organization was 

known by the name “I. C.,” but at that time Pi Beta Phi was
chosen as the official title.

Kappa Psi

Kappa Psi has the unique distinction of being the ﬁrst medical
and pharmaceutical fraternity to be organized. It was founded at
the Russell Military Academy of New Haven, Connecticut, in May,
1879. Since then its growth has reached practically every large
college or university having medicine in its curriculum. It has a total
enrollment of about 15,000 men.

Beta Kappa Chapter of the organization was inaugurated at the
University of Pittsburgh in’ 1913.

Recently,iKappa Psi merged with two other nationals, Delta
Omicron Alpha and Phi Delta, both strong medical fraternities.
Delta Omicron Alpha united on November 17, 1917, and Phi Delta

' came in on January 26, 1918. All three societies now bear the name
of Kappa Psi.

The fraternity colors are scarlet and cadet gray. The ﬂower is
the red carnation. The badge is a diamond displaying a mask raised
from the face of the black enamel center. The Greek letters Kappa
and Psi appear one above and one below the mask. The eyes of the
mask and the border of the badge may be jeweled.

The fraternity has as its aim the promotion of fellowship,
scholarship, and progress in the medical profession. It also tries to
develop the characters and personalities of all its members. The
local active membership is sixty-five.

American College Quill Club

The American College Quill Club, founded February 1, 1900, at the University
of Kansas by a group of students who wished to encourage literary activity and
literary criticism among American college students, has established Runes, or chapters,
at nine large schools, including the University of VVyoming and the University of
Southern California.

In accordance with the plan that each new Rune be named, in the proper order,
for a letter in the Runic or Anglo—Saxon alphabet, this group of students called itself
the Fech or First Rune.

The Scribners, a local organization at the University of Pittsburgh, became
national in 1921. Being the ninth Rune, it was called Haegl, for the ninth letter
in the Runic alphabet. Haegl Rune is the only Rune east of the Mississippi. In
addition to its present active membership of twenty, it also includes several alumni
members who are prominent writers in this section.

T he 1924-25 Sporting Season

Marking a year of transition between the old era of hampered endeavor and the
new, with its stadium, the 1924-25 University of Pittsburgh athletic season, though
not ﬁlled with victories, was a year of uniform progress. One national victory was
won by a University team, the massive stadium was begun, football season was ended
in a blaze of glory, and the 1924 baseball team, under handicaps, struggled through
a good year. The record, as a whole, is regarded with pride and satisfaction by Pitt
followers.

The outstanding athletic event of the year, both from the standpoint of the
University and of the tri—state district, was the winning by a varsity team of the
National Intercollegiate Cross Country Title at New York City last November.
The Panther harriers, competing with all the leading institutions of the East, sur-
prised the sport world when they swept the field before them in the annual competi-
tion, adding more to the prestige of the University in track activities than any other
team has done in the past decade.

Besides the competitions, the biggest stride was made in the advancement of
University athletics last August when the mammoth Pitt Stadium was begun. The
structure, which was made possible by the support of the students and Alumni of the
University and the citizens of Pittsburgh, will be completed at the beginning of the
1925 gridiron season. From then on all Panther athletic teams, instead of appearing
at Forbes Field, Motor Square Garden, or Trees Gymnasium, will ﬁnd permanent
Facilities for all branches of sports will enable the Pitt
teams to have more time for practice and to appear under the most favorable circum-
stances.

homes in the massive bowl.

Football season saw a ﬁghting team finish a discouraging year by beating one of
the strongest machines of the east, Penn State. It also saw the opening of a new
coaching regime under the guidance of Coach “Jock” Sutherland, who came from
Lafayette last fall to replace “Pop” Warner and to mold a strong squad out of
mediocre material. The record of five victories, three defeats, and one tie, spoiled a
perfect season for West Virginia, humiliated Penn State, and gave Syracuse the
surprise of the year by holding them to a tie. Pitt has turned out better teams.
But when-it is considered that the coach was new to the men and that the season
was unusually hard, there can be nothing but praise for Dr. Sutherland and his men.

The 1924- baseball team, also laboring under handicaps, managed to establish
Panther history by completing their season with a record of eight games won and
three lost. Forced to cancel almost half of its games on account of bad Weather,
the team nevertheless played good ball and, under Coach Harley and Captain
Swetonic, had a most successful season. i

A low Stevvnsmz

Facing the stiff task of shaping
unknown material of little experi-
ence into a football team worthy
of representing the University
against nine of the best elevens
Eastern America could boast,
Coach John Bain Sutherland suc-
ceeded. His diﬂiculties were nei-
ther realized nor appreciated by
the public, but there is no need to
make excuses, for he not only over-
came them, but finally produced a
line-up that compared with the
finest. He was ably assisted by
“Chalky” VVilliamson, Alex Stev-
enson, and Floyd Rose, old stand-
bys of Pitt athletics. No, Pitt
football hasnlt died; it is only get-
ting started.

The /924 Football Season

Opening its first season under Coach Sutherland,
the green Panther football team defeated Grove City
College, 14 to O. Vicious line plunging in the first
and second quarters, resulting in two touchdowns, and
two points scored by Gwosden’s toe, enabled Pitt's
eleven to register the victory. From the start to
the ﬁnish Pitt shaped up as the better team, the
Grovers consistently failing in their forward passing at-
tack and never driving
closer than twenty-ﬁve
yards to the Pittsburgh
goal. The Gold and
Blue outgained the
Grovers in yardage by
ntakfng 13 first downs
to 6 and showed a

 

slight advantage in the

A’””3 aerial art, completing

four, dropping three and allowing one to fall into alien

hands, while Grove City completed only four out of

23 passes, mufﬁng l7 and losing two altogether. Jack

Harding's 56-yard run and a triple pass, Gustafson to

Brown to Harding, proved to be the features of the
contest.

before the powerful, versatile and not-to-be-denied at-
tack of Lafayette College. Facing the experienced
squad led by Berry, all-American end, in the second
game of the year, the Panthers found the weight of
inexperience heavy, but, nevertheless, kept ﬁghting
throughout the entire game, keeping the result in
doubt until late in the ﬁnal quarter when Kirkleski
slipped over the goal line to add a touchdown to the
slim margin of three points that the lVIaroon enjoyed
as the result of a field goal in the second period. Ash-
baugh and Amann,
calling signals for the
P a n t h e r s, conﬁned
most of the offense to

 

straight line plunging
as in the Grove City
game, using the for-
ward at times but with

 

little success on ac-
count of the speed and
watchfulness of McCracken’s men. The Lafayette
team, with outstanding players like Captain Berry,
Budd, Chicknoski, Kirkleski, and Gebhardt, was one of
the best elevens to play at Forbes Field last season, but
they had to use their best to gain a decision over the
Panthers.

sive triumph of that eleven over the Gold and Blue,
the Panther football team presented a rejuvenated and
inspired squad that no opponent could well resist.
With the memory of the Lafayette defeat still smart-
ing and the thought that if the Mountaineers were to
win they would hold three straight decisions over Pitt,
Coach Sutherland’s men entered the game fully deter-

disabled Gustafson and Brown, “Ollie” Harris and
Joe Schmitt instilled new ﬁght into the hearts of the
Panthers, along with

    

the wonderful playing
of l\I a r s h Johnson;
they also scored the
two touchdowns nec-
essary for a victory.
For two periods the
best team West Vir-
ginia ever sent here
and the Panther team,
hardly recognizable as the same that had foundered
the previous week before Lafayette, struggled up and
down the ﬁeld without a score, but with the Suther-
landers gaining a slight edge near the close. VVith the
opening of the second half the Panthers lost no time,
but proceeded to ﬁght through their opponents for two
scores. Bruder, Ekberg, and the mighty Nardacci
g could do very little until‘ the closing minutes of the
Capt Frank game, when the Panthers, minus the services of John-

son and other regulars, relaxed enough to allow the
Mountaineers to score.

Pitt——26, John Hopkins——O

Traveling to Baltimore on their second invasion of
foreign territory, the Pitt footballers succeeded in tak-
ing the measure of the future doctors to the tune of
26 points to nothing. Registering 28 first downs to
none, using crashes through the center of the line, off
tackle plays and sweeping end runs the Panthers
showed the Easterners
that the team from
west of the Alleghenies
could play football.
The Sutherland at-
tack lost some of its
effectiveness through
fumbles after long sus-
tained drives that took

enemy ground. Had it not been for sloppy handling
of the ball during critical moments of play, the Pan-
thers would probably have doubled the score. A
most pleasing feature of the contest was the continued
good playing of Schmidt and Harris. Gustafson
showed a return to his form while Harding and Marsh
Johnson stood out as usual.

in the ﬁrst quarter, the Carnegie Tech eleven, inspired
in the usual manner when it meets Pitt, was successful
in preventing the enraged Panther from crossing the
goal line and thus scored its second successive victory
over the Gold and Blue. Once again the Panthers
ontgained the Tartans, piling up 19 first downs to
six, but once more also the Skibo eleven proved itself
an impassable barrier when it was backed up against
its own goal line. Seven times the charges of Suther-
land lost the ball within the ten—yard line and three
times within the ﬁve-
yard chalk mark. After
the surprise of the
early Carnegie score
had passed, the Pan-
thers launched drive
after drive that carried
the t e a m smashing
through the Tartan
line, but time after

time the gritty Steffenites stopped them as they drew
near the danger line. The Pitt gridders fought hard
but they seemed to lack the inspiration and the punch
they possessed in the Mountaineer fray. Carnegie pre-
sented a versatile attack that had the Panthers guessing
at times, and deserves commendation for the manner in
which it used its resources to outwit Sutherland’s men.
But spectators familiar with Pitt’s showing throughout
the season declare that she played beneath her best

form, and that she would have triumphed easily if she
had played the same kind of ball displayed against
VVcst Virginia and Penn State.

Pitt—7, Syracuse—7

The Panther football team staged its second come-
back in the 1924 season when it journeyed to Syra-
cuse, showed more punch and daring than in the
Tartan battle and, after playing the big Orange on
equal terms following the latter’s touchdown in the
opening period, sur-
p r i s e d the football
world when it rushed
a touchdown over the
goal line in the ﬁnal
quarter and tied one of
the leading teams 'in
the East. Both scores
came as the direct re- "°’”“"”
sult of fumbles, Joe
Schmitt allowing the pigskin to slip in the initial
quarter to let Rugge recover for a twenty-yard dash
to the goal, and redeeming himself in the last frame
when he scooped up Bowman’s error, ran twenty yards,
and put the ball in a position for Gustafson to carry it
through by consistent line plunging. The Orange
backﬁeld of McBride, Bowman, and Foley, renowned
in the East for its speed, showed indications of power
at times, but the Panther backs kept them from getting

into the open where they might have proved dangerous.
The entire Pitt team displayed a remarkably im-
proved game. Wissiriger, Hangartner and Johnson
in the line and Brown and Schmitt in the backfield
deserve a great deal of credit for what was considered
a moral victory for the Panthers. The touchdown by
Syracuse marks the first one it has scored against Pitt
in the past three years.
‘ Pitt—l3, Geneva—0
Using a number of substitutes during the major
part of the contest
with Geneva, Coach
Sutherland was con-
tent to allow his team
defeat the down river
lads by two touch-
downs. The Geneva
gridders, coached by
KW?‘ Jack Sack, former Pitt
football star, brought
plenty of fight to Forbes Field and made the Panther
players earn their fourth victory. “Porkie” Evans and
“Red” McCutcheon, starting the game in place of
Harding and Gustafson in the backfield, played cred-
ibly, showing promise of development into stars.

Pitt—O, W. & _I.—10

 

After the annual contest between the Panther and
Presidents last fall at Forbes Field, the followers of

 

Linn

Page Three Hundred Forty

 

VV. & J. were able to rejoice to their heart's content
and return to Little Washington in a high state of
glee, for their football heroes had at last, after three
years of unrewarded effort, succeeded in handing the
Pitt team an unquestioned defeat. Full credit must
be given to the team brought here by Coach Morrow,
for they displayed a brand of football and a ﬁghting
spirit that was well nigh invincible. The Panthers,
too, deserve praise for the game they put up against a
more experienced and versatile combination. For two
periods the teams bat-
tered each other up
and down the ﬁeld.
but neither seemed to
have an edge. Each
was able to register a
first down or two and

 

gain possible twenty or
thirty yards, but each
was forced to kick or
surrender the ball when it approached the twenty-yard
line. Feeling was intense as the elevens lined up for
a decision in the last half. After a Panther rally that
was stopped like its predecessors in the first half, the
Presidents started another drive that spent its force on
the 25-yard line. Unfortunately, the Red and Black
had another asset that served them beautifully when
Edwards booted a ﬁeld goal that gave his mates a
precious three-point lead. Yet Pitt was by no means

out. Coach Sutherland’s men opened up with every-
thing they had in an effort to overcome their opponents’
lead, but could not quite make the grade. The Presi-
dents’ other seven points resulted from a touchdown
scored by Ride after scooping up a Pitt fumble.

comebacks and the most
sensational reversal of
form during the entire
year to administer the
Penn State team one of
the worst lickings it
has suffered in a good
many years. After a NWT

week of seclusion in

the hills of Ligonier, the Panthers returned to Pitts-
burgh the morning of the game with a new spirit and

 

determination to do or die in their last contest. They
showed a diversified attack of triple passes, double
passes, forward passes, end runs, tackle bucks and trick
formations that ripped through the State defense for
four touchdowns and that made the great holiday as-
sembly wonder if they were the same crew that had
played before with such meager results. For a short

Page Three [fun/[rel] Forty-Iu'0

 

time from the start of the game each team endeavored
to test the other. Pitt seemed to have the greater force
in back of its drives, whereas the State backs appeared
to be slowed up by the Panther spirit that annually
affects their elevens as much as by the charging Panther
forwards. When the Lions were halted successfully
and forced to kick a field goal as they drew near the
line, for the first score of the game, Pitt enthusiasts
became hilarious.

The wonderful offensive that the home team had
under control could
not long be denied a
score by the best of de-
fensive squads. There-
after everything was
Pitt. The first six
points came as the re-
sult of a touchdown by
Gustafson in the sec-

ond quarter. ln the second half the Center Countians
continued to act as though they were in a stupor and
the Pitt team ran wild, sending across three more
touchdowns to far surpass the most optimistic predic-
tions for the outcome. Every Pitt man on the field
deserves a word of praise for the game he played; they
all starred. The game was a wonderful climax to
Sutherland’s first session at Pitt, and to the college ath-
letic careers of Captain Frank, Marsh Johnson, Han-
,,_ N,.,,,,,,»,,_ gartner, Gwosden, VVissinger, Akins and Ashbaugh.

F reylz man F octba/I Season

The Panther freshman football team of 1924 established one of the best records
ever made by a first year team at Pitt. Playing seven games, the Frosh succeeded in
defeating California Normal, and the freshman teams of VVest Virginia, Penn State,
Carnegie Tech, and Washington and Jefferson; in tying Bellefonte Academy; and in
losing to Kiski through overconfidence. Coach Carlson developed a team——one might
say teams, for he had several combinations of almost equal ability—that was vastly
superior in every branch of the game to the majority of its opponents. It was Carl-
son's favorite sport to startle the spectators by yanking out his entire team at one time
to send in a fresh eleven.

California offered the first test for the yearlings, but Carlson’s men were too strong
for the Normalites and they fell before the Frosh attack, 25 to 0. In the second game,
played at Morgantown, the Frosh were held to a field goal by the lVIountaineer cubs.
The three point margin of victory does not begin to indicate the real edge the Pan-
thers had over their opponents. Next, the first year men attempted to set an example
for the Varsity when they walloped the Tartan plebes, -ll to 0. In their fourth con-
test, the Frosh were held by Bellefonte to a 0-0 tie, although they outgained their
rivals, 16 first downs to 6. The game, played at Greensburg, would have done credit
to a small college. In the following game, that with the Penn State freshmen, the
Panther frosh in general, and Booth in particular, showed their strength in winning
by two touchdowns.

Page Three Hundred F0rly—f0ur

 

In the preliminary to the Varsity-W. & J. game, the Carlsonites were given a
stiff battle by the junior President eleven, but they had plenty in reserve and were able
to win 13 to 6, though they were scored on for the first time during the year. It was
a tough blow for the cubs to lose their last contest to Kiski, O to 17, after going
through the season undefeated. Kiski had lost previously to the Penn State first year
team by two touchdowns, the same margin by which the Panthers had overcome the

Staters.

The successes of the team seem to indicate that next season's Varsity will profit
by much new material of real value. Among those developed in the backﬁeld are:
Allan Booth, VValter Hoban, G. A. VVelsh, Andrew Cutler, Clair Aggers, E. L.
Fyock, K. W. Smith, Robert Rose, and John E. Grindle; and in the line: Captain
Albert  Salata, John Roberts, Philip Sargent, James A. Scanlon, Felix Delﬂoise.
VVilliam Kern, Edward Seifert, John Breen, P. A. Fisher, Marion Cowan, Richard
Goldberg, Wilbur C. Hockensmith, Fenton Means, Chester VVasmuth, David Ireland,
and Jacob Rosenberg.

Vanity Baylaetlmll

Varsity basketball during the 1924-25 season was mediocre in point of games
won and lost, but significant because of the fighting spirit of the team. Twelve games

“were played, three resulting in victories, and nine in defeats. The Panthers scored

wins over Allegheny, Carnegie Tch, and Washington & Jefferson; they lost to
Geneva, West Virginia '(2), Penn State (2), Syracuse, Carnegie Tech, VVashington
& Jefferson, and Grove City.

With only two lettermen from the 1924- quintet, Captain Wayde King and Bill
Parsons, Coach Carlson used Ralph Chase, Ben Jones, James Kowallis, Ben Richman,
Joseph Campbell and Elmer Lissfelt. The squad lacked the experience and polish
that go with a team composed of men who have played together for several years, and
lost most of its games for this reason. One might term the season a preparation for
future teams. The entire squad, with the exception of King, will be eligible in 1926.
Varsity letters were awarded to Captain King, Kowallis, Chase, Lissfelt, Parsons,
and Jones.

Continuing the pace set by the frosh football team, the freshman basketball team
won 17 of the 18 games played. Leading high school, prep school, and tri-state college
first year teams fell alike before the attack of the passers coached by Lou lVIcl\Iasters.
Only Braddock High succeeded in out—scoring them, but the Panthers wiped out this
one blot later in the season when they defeated the same five. The team was well
balanced, high scoring, and blessed with plenty of reserve material as well as an
abundance of accurate shots. Among its victims is listed the nationally known Union-
town High School quintet, which had previously won 45 consecutive games, and which
later obtained the \V. P. I. A. L. and State championships.

The squad included quite a few men who should make positions on the varsity
next year. Captain l\TclV'Iahon at center, with Brown at the pivotal position, VVrob-
leski, l\IcGill, and Campbell as forwards, and Sykes, Reed, Hoban, Goldberg, and
Jones at the guard posts, are all good material.

Freshman numerals were awarded to Hoban, Booth, l\Icl\Iah0n, VVrobleski, Reed,

Varsity Baseball

Playing their last year on Tree’s ﬁeld, the Varsity baseball team of 1924 added
to the athletic prestige of Pitt when they won eight games and lost only three. Tri-
umphs were scored over Bucknell (2), Syracuse, Grove City, VVest Virginia (2), and
Penn State (2). Navy and West Virginia were the only teams to defeat the Harley-
ites.

One of the choicest morsels of the season was the sweep of the two games with
Penn State, which was the first victory the locals have recorded over an invading Lion
diamond team in three years. *

As to the mythical Tri-State championship, Pitt lost because unfavorable weather
prevented the playing of more than eleven of the twenty scheduled games

Captain Steve Swetonic was responsible for the mound work most of the season,
although “Lefty” Hill and Alf Schmidt also did creditable work in this position.
Coach Harley’s lineup was well balanced and worked smoothly. Besides either
Swetonic or Schmidt in the outfield, Jakie Bohren and Bill Parsons were held respon-
sible for any distant wallops. The infield was capably manned by Hill on first,
Irwin at second, “Spike” Harding at short, and Carmen at third. “Nig” Lauder
guarded home plate.

“Spike” Harding was elected captain for the 1925 season, but the difficulty of
finding a playing field resulted in dropping this sport for one year.

The 1924 Cross-Country Season

The 192-} cross-country season will go down in the history of the University as
one of the best seasons ever enjoyed by a Pitt squad. Its greatest claim to honor lies
in capturing the I. C. A. A. A. A. championship, but the rest of its meets were equally
noteworthy. The single defeat, by Penn State, was no disgrace, as it came before the
team had recovered from the grind of the championship race.

The season’s first meet was a race over the Schenley Park course with Carnegie
Tech. Pitt won, 20 to 35. Howard Dykeman, Tech star, took the individual honors,
but six Pitt men scored before another Tech man ﬁnished. The Pitt runners placed
in the following order: Kerr, Lies, Corbett, Schroedel, Wadkins, and Howell.
Powell was ninth, and Wick, twelfth. -

In the Allegheny Mountain Association championships, held Armistice Day in
Braddock, the Varsity took both individual and team honors when Ted Corbett led
ﬁve of his mates home for a perfect score. Pitt’s second team was second, and Car-
negie Tech’s second team was third. Taking from first to sixth places, the men
finished in the following order: Corbett, Lies, Howell, Kerr, Wadkins, and Schroedel.
The second teamwwas composed of Rob Roy, Powell, Adams, Hudson, Larson, and
Hinderer.

The third race was with Allegheny College over the Schenley Park course, and
resulted in a Pitt victory by an almost perfect score, 16 to 49. Pitt took the first four
places, and the sixth. Captain Ray of Allegheny ﬁnished fifth, saving his team from
a complete shutout. The runners ﬁnished in the following order: Corbett, Lies,
Howell, Kerr, Ray (Allegheny), Wadkins, and Schroedel. Corbett set a new course
record of 28 minutes 20 seconds.

The record breaking event of the year was the Panther’s surprising victory in
the Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association Cross—Country Championships, held
over a six and one—half mile course in Van Cortlandt Park, New York City, Novem-
ber 24. Unheralded in cross-country circles and competing in the championships for
the first time as a team, the Pitt harriers ran to a decisive victory over thirteen leading
eastern teams, and carried off the team championship by the lowest score since 1921.
Harvard, Syracuse, Yale, Maine, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Princeton, M. I. T.,
Rutgers, Georgetown, Pennsylvania, and the City College of New York followed in
succession. Individual Pitt runners placed in the following order: Lies, ﬁfth; Cor-
bett, ninth; Wadkins, twelfth; Schroedel, fourteenth; Howell, seventeenth; Kerr,
twenty-eighth; and Powell, sixty-ninth.

Three days later, the Varsity closed its season in a meet with Penn State, losing
by a margin of five points, 25 to 30. Fouracre of State won, and Pitt men placed as
follows: Corbett, third; Lies, fourth; Schroedel, ﬁfth; Howell, eighth; and Kerr,
ninth. The Pitt team, with only three days of rest since its gruelling race in New
York, was in no shape to compete.

The varsity team, selected by Coach Frank Shea, and which took part in all
meets during the season, was composed of the following men: Captain Dale Schroedel,
Ted Corbett, Clyde Lies, VVilliam Howell, George Kerr,  E. Wadkins, Edward
Powell, and James Wick. It was managed by C. E. Wiley.

In its single meet of the season, the freshman cross-country team lost to Carnegie
Tech by the score of 26 to 29. Rob Roy, of Pitt, placed first, and the other Pitt men
finished in the following order: Adams, third; Wilson, sixth; Marsh, ninth; and
Shaffer, tenth. Roy and Adams were sent to the championships in New York with
the Varsity, and made a ﬁne showing by finishing sixth and eighteenth in a ﬁeld of
100 eastern freshman stars.

The 1924 Track Season

Enjoying the most successful season of the past five years,
the 1924 track team, coached by Frank
Shea, won two meets placed second in a
triangular competition, lost two, and made
a good showing in the Penn Relays and the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet.

The season opened with the Penn Re-
lays in Philadelphia. Captain Bill Ro-
busch won the high jump at 6 feet 2
inches, and tied for second in the pole vault
at 12 feet 7 inches. Marsh Johnson placed
fifth in the national pentathlon champion-
ship in a field of 15, and Ted Corbett, lone
entry in the international two-mile, placed
seventh in a ﬁeld of 26. His time of 9:51
was several seconds better than the existing
Capt. Robusch Pitt rec()rd_

 

The second meet was held at Annap-
olis, Md., with the Navy and Johns Hopkins. The ﬁnal score ..
was: Navy, 641/_»; Pitt, 321/3; Johns Hopkins, 29. Pitt placed Corbett

 

Page Three Hundred Fifty-one

first in the shot—put, broad jump, pole vault, and the high jump, and second in the
two—mile, discus, and shot.

Held in Morgantown, the West Virginia meet resulted in a 79-56 defeat for
Pitt. Pitt scored ﬁrsts in the high jump, pole vault, broad jump, two-mile, and the
half—mile. Captain Robusch was the outstanding star with a total of three firsts and
a third. One of his firsts set a new pole vault record, 12 feet 101/; inches.

The Tech-Pitt meet was held as a part of the Tech Campus Week. The Tar-
tans were downed, 81-45, when they won but ﬁve first places in the 14 events. Cor-
bett’s victory over Dykeman in the two—mile race featured the day. Cowan, Perry,

Wadkins, Kutchka, Johnson, and Robusch also took first places.

May 21, Pitt journeyed to Beaver Falls to meet Geneva. The ﬁnal score was
in favor of Pitt, 91-41, with 10 out of 15 ﬁrst places. Cowan, Martin, Shaffer, Cost,
Corbett, Johnson, Robusch, Anderson, Sauer, and Smith supplied first places.

The Pitt Intercollegiates, scheduled for May 2-1, were cancelled because of
heavy rains which made it impossible to use Schenley Oval. This was one of the
worst disappointments of the season, for several hundred athletes had already arrived
to participate.

When Robusch was declared ineligible, Ted Corbett was the only entry sent to
the I. C. A. A. A. A. Championships in the Harvard stadium. He placed ninth in

a field of some thirty runners in the two—mile race.

The final meet was held at State College, Saturday, June 7. The score was
State, 96; Pitt, 39. State runners scored wins in all running events, and had a large
share of the ﬁeld events, ﬁnding their only stumbling block in Marsh Johnson. Cap-
tain R0busch’s absence from the squad undoubtedly weakened the Panthers.

The high point scorer of the season was Marsh Johnson, with a total for the
six meets of 67% points. Captain Robusch was a close second, with 56% points for
ﬁve meets, and Lee S. Cowan, sprinter, was third with 23 points; Corbett, 21; Lester
Perry and Joseph E. Wadkins, 15 each; 0. M. Fabiani, 14; Carl H. Sauer, 1314;
T. W. Martin, 13; Dale P. Schroedel, 12; Karl Kutchka, 11; Kenneth Shaffer,
9; W. White, 6. All of these men and G. W. Frederick, manager of the team,

were awarded letters.

At the close of the season, the lettermen elected Ted Corbett to the eapitaney of
the 1925 varsity team.

QT/ze I924 Frey/zmcm T mo/7 Season

Scheduled to compete in the most ambitious freshman track program ever at-
tempted at Pitt, the 1924 first-year team met with disappointment after disappoint-
ment. The Penn State and Bellefonte meets were cancelled because of rain, and a
similar fate befell the Pitt lntercollegiates. "Of the two meets held, Pitt was victorious
in one, and lost the other.

In the Tech meet, the Panthers loomed far above the Tartans, shutting Tech men
completely out in the 100-yard dash, -H0-yard dash, half-mile run, mile run, high
jump, and broad jump. Tech took no first place, but managed to get third in the
javelin, third in the shot put, second in the discus, and second and third in the 220-
yard dash. The three high—point scorers were John Grindle, John Roberts, and Dave
Archibald. Grindle scored 13 points; Roberts, 12; and Archibald, 101/2.

Delay in the arrival of the Pitt team made it impossible to run off more than
nine of the fourteen scheduled events in the meet at Kiski. The mile run, 220-yard
low hurdles, 220—yard dash, pole vault, and the hammer throw had to be cancelled,
and it was in these events that Pitt would probably have proved the better of the two
teams, with men such as Bill Howell, Robert Marquis, Lee Herrington, William
McCoy, George C. Peters, Glenn Connell, and Howard Linn in reserve. As it was,
Kiski won, 45 to 36.

For the two meets, Grindle had the highest score, 20. Others with high scores
were Archibald, 191/_); Herrington, 13; Roberts, 12; and Howell, 10.

T /26 1925 Sw immirzg Season

The 1925 swimming season was one of the most successful the University has
known. The Varsity won six of its seven meets, and the freshman team had a clean
slate of nine victories.

In the opening meet, the Varsity combined with the Freshmen to defeat the
Civic A. A. by a score of 52-17. Bowen and Gluck starred. VVooster, Ohio confer-
cnc leader, was an easy victim, and in this meet Steele started his unbroken string of
free-style triumphs, taking two firsts in every succeeding meet. Elliott Brodie also
made a fine showing with two firsts. The following meet was won by Syracuse,
3—I- to 33.

Case was barely defeated in Cleveland, 36 to 35, and in this meet the relay team
lost its only race of the year. Easy victories were scored over Allegheny and the Oil
City “Y,” 54- to 14, and 51 to 20. In a return meet, Case was again defeated, this

T he 1924 T ennis Season

Coached by Dr. Thomas W. Stephens, the varsity tennis team opened the 1924
season, April 30, with West Virginia’s team on Frick Acres. A score of 5 to 1, in
Pitt’s favor, resulted when the Varsity took all of the single matches and one double
match. W. & J. tied the Varsity in the match held May 17, and the double matches
with Carnegie Tech, May 16 and lVIay Z1, resulted in both a victory and a defeat,
5 to 1, and 2 to 4. West Virginia was again downed, -l- to 2, May 31. The season’s
worst defeat came at the hands of W. & J., 5 to 1, in a return match, June 4, thus
losing the mythical tri-state title. The 4 to 2 Victory over Bucknell, June 7, ended
the year. Thirteen matches were originally scheduled, but rain cancelled six of them.
Two of these were with Penn State, two with Allegheny, and one each with Juniata
and Westminster. The team was captained by S. H. Cooper, and managed by John
E. Bigler, Letters were awarded to Cooper, Bigler, Stannard B. Pfahl,  Ferguson,
Arnold Silverman, and Morris Linton.

The 1924 Golf Season

The University golf team proved its high calibre in a most satisfactory manner
during the 1924 season. All but two of the seven scheduled games were played.
These were with Carnegie Tech, which failed to support a team. Of the games
played, three were victories; two, defeats.

The Bucknell match was the first of the year. Although rain showered the
players on the entire course, the game resulted in a clean sweep over the visitors.
l\lanage1‘ Tom Canon turned in the best score, with a 76. Zimmerman was second
best with an 80.

ln the second match, the first with Penn State, Canon and King starred, both
turning in scores of 74. Captain Laneve and Harry Zimmerman lost their matches.

The next contest, won from VV. & ]., 7-4, was featured by the “comeback” of
Captain Laneve and Zimmerman, who scored six of Pitt’s points. Canon rallied on
the home stretch to score the seventh point. King lost a hard match to Haddon,
VV. 8: J. captain.

After a hard struggle Pitt was compelled to surrender to the golfers from Penn
State and VV. & J. in the last two matches. Both were played away from home.

Letters were awarded to Captain R. A. Laneve, lwanager Tom Canon, VVayde
King, and H. Zimmerman.

The successes of the rifle team equaled those of any other Varsity team of the
1925 season. Eight matches were won by the marksman, and only two were lost.
The team’s standing was third in the l\/Iiddle States Riﬂe League, and it won fourth
place in the National Rifle Tourney, held in New York, in which twelve teams,
representing different Sections of the United States, competed. Captain  C. Hutson
of the militar_v department coached the organization.

Girl’; Vczrsity Baylzetball

The 1924-25 season of the girl’s varsity basketball team was one of the most
spectacular ever experienced by a local team. All of the ten games played resulted in
victories, a record unequaled by any other University team.

Elizabeth Zeigler captained the team, and it was managed by lVIargaret Thomp-
son. The coaching was done by lwiss l\/largaret A. l\IcClenahan, Assistant Professor
of Physical Education. Captain “lb” Zeigler and Kathleen Burgun played guard;
Dorothy Russell and Dorothy Koch, center; Venus Shakarian, Sylvia Perovsky, and
Helen Lloyd, side—center; and Jeanne Rluter and Ruth Stultz, forward. '

The victories over Temple University, which had never before been defeated on
its home floor, and over the University of Cincinnati placed the girl’s team in a
position of prestige. Cincinnati was the only team to defeat Pitt in the 1924
season, and in 1923 the score was tied.

Girl’: Reserve Team

A girl’s reserve basketball team was organized in the winter of l92-l by l\'Iiss
lVIcClenahan to supplement the Varsity organization. It played seven games during
the season, winning three. Competition for positions was spirited, and in addition to
developing material for the varsity team, it increased the opportunities for women to
participate in basketball.

The team was captained by Elsie Thomson, coached by l\~liss l\IcClenahan, and
managed by Grace Hartman. The forward positions were filled by Grace O’I)onnell,
Jessie Tufts, Olive l\'IcElr0y, and l\'Iarie Holler. The defensive work was done by
Sylvia VVechsler, Virginia VValker, Janet lwathison, Louise Patterson, and Jeannette
l\'ICClllI‘C. Dorothy Koch jumped center, and Elsie Thomson, Emily Locke, Ruth
Thompson, and Harriet hlathison played side center.

The team was unique in that practically all of the players had played guard
positions on high school teams.

The 1926 Owl

The staff of the twentieth annual volume of the Owl has attempted to produce a
book that will be more representative of the University of Pittsburgh‘ than its prede-
cessors have been. There is at Pitt a spirit of achievement, a spirit of dynamic action,
that the Owl wants to express. To do this, it has tried to break the monotony of
bare facts by including campus views, an aerial panorama of the Schenley Farms
district, charcoal drawings, and numerous other features.

The theme of the volume is the University itself, and especially the new stadium.
The activities, organizations, and individuals connected with it are presented with the
hope that in future years the remembrance of them will help to recreate a little of the
atmosphere that filled our student days.

The work involved has been great. It was not drudgery, though, but a privilege.
Most of it was done by the staff, but gratitude is due to the student body and the
administration for their help in collecting material. One administrative officer, Ken-
neth M. Gould, the University Editor, has played a very inﬂuential part in the design-
ing of the format and general make-up. Without his efforts, the Owl would have
been the same old book of other years. ‘

Experience in publishing the Owl has suggested the following recommendations:
that the Owl be made a publication of the student body, instead of that of any particu-
lar class, and that senior, instead of junior pictures be printed. These two changes,
the staff believes, would make the Owl a much more valuable annual.

The production of the Owl has involved an expenditure of more than $8,000,
a greater amount than in any previous year. It was printed by the Herbick and Held
Printing Company of Pittsburgh. The Northern Engraving Company of Canton,
Ohio, completed the engraving and art work. More copies were printed than ever
before.

The Owl was first published in 1906. Since it appeared then, in small format,
its appearance and contents have changed almost entirely. Greater changes than ever,
though, are contemplated for the next few years.

The editor and the business manager are chosen each spring by the University
Editor and the Graduate Manager of Student Activities on the recommendation of
the retiring ollicers. School editors and managers are elected in the separate schools.
All other staff members are chosen by the editor and the business manager.

T /26 Pin‘ Pam‘/zer

The first Panther appeared on the campus in 1914, a product of the imagination
and humor of a group of undergraduates. Sidney S. Hoehl, Lou Broido, G. l\I. P.
Baird, George Ketchum, and Carleton Ketchum were among the guilty. Since their
time the l’anther’s welfare has been in the hands of a series of practical and impractical
jol(ers whose sense of humor has gotten the better of any good judgment they may
have had. During this period of very healthy growth, the Panther has tried to teach
others that there is something funny in everything, even in that poor, hen-peeked
niother—in—law joke, operating under some such motto as, “He who laughs last has a

3

poor head for jokes.‘

In the course of the 102425 season, the old boy inflicted himself on the campus
nine distinct and different times. The first issue was the Exchange Number, a resume
of some of the best humor that contemporary publications were offering. The next
month, Panther paid homage to the football stars in the College Hero Number. This
was followed by the December issue, dedicated to the return of the prodigal and to
the Christmas holidays. The fourth magazine was proudly heralded as the Cathedral
of Learning Number, and Cupid and St. Valentine were made the brunt of the
lfebruary issue. The succeeding publication was aptly titled the Dizzy Number.
“Get busy, he dizzy, and die,” was its watchword. Next were offered the Fashion
Number, the Cap and Gown issue, and the final local panning and Pitt \Veek number.
The features of the year were the clever two-page cartoons by Dave Scott, and the

editor’s wild accouxgrts of the Rover Boys at Pitt. The Fashion Number, with fort_y
pages, was the largest issue ever published by the Panther. ‘

In the Panning Number, which appeared ,invJune, the Panther exposed several
campus fallacies, and made fun of ‘everything .and of everybody. The “Pitt Weakly”
was issued as a supplement, and the sale ofthis number seemed to prove it the most
popular of the year. '

The Panther, besides furnishing a comfortable office for its staff members, awards
a gold key to those who_have successfullycontributed to its pages for a period of two
years.‘ This key also carries membership in Pi Beta, the honorary Panther society.
This fraternity meets for social functions and banquets at ‘intervals during the year,
and holds a final celebration each spring. ’

In the fall of 1924, the Panther oﬂice in Alumni Hall was needed for faculty
facilities, and the magazine moved its headquarters to the “barn” on HF rick Acres.-

The Pitt Weekly

The Pitt VVeekly is the oflicial student and alumni journal of the University of
Pittsburgh. During the year 1924-25, decided improvements were made in the format
and editorial contents. Several ten-page editions were issued, and an increased number
of illustrations were used. Its columns were so congested with news at times that the
possibility of publishing two issues a week was considered at length.

Because space was needed in Alumni Hall for faculty offices, the VVeekly was
moved in the late fall from room 117 to the building behind the Retail Research
Bureau house on Frick Acres. The office is known affectionately as the “barn,” or
the “dump.”

The VVeekly is the direct descendant of the first student newspaper published in
the University, the “College Journal,” issued from 1875 until 1882. Between 1882
and 1910, when the \Veekl_v was first issued, two other papers were published: the
“Pennsylvania VVestern,” from 1882 to 1888, and the “Courant,” from 1888 to 1910.

All staff positions are competitive. The editor and the business manager are
appointed by the University Editor and the Graduate Manager of Student Activities
each spring on the recommendation of the retiring heads. l\/Iinor appointments are

made on the basis of merit. The annual competition for positions on the editorial
staff is held in the fall.

Pitt Players

The Pitt Players presented six productions during the 1924-25 season. Of these,
three were full length plays and_ the others were single acts. All of the programs were
well received by large audiences.

Cosmo Hamilton’s “The New Poor” was given in the Heinz House, December
4. A comedy in three acts, its parts were taken by the following students: Kathryn
Rowell, Annette M. Nosoff, Bessie Kann, C. Louise Putnam, Charles Seif, Doris
Rigby, Rebecca Kaufman, Alexander Shaw,  M. Cameron, Alfred Bengston, Chester
McLaughlin, and Elmer Klaber.

January 9, three one-act plays were produced: “Columbine,” by Colin C. Clem-
ents; “In Front of Potter’s,” by Frank Tompkins; and “Evening Dress Indispensable,”
by Roland Pertwee. Parts were played by the following members: Jule Koreff,
l\/Iildred Wagle, Donald Brown, Rufus Monks, Wayde Bloom, Kathryn Rowell,
Henrietta Ronay, Rhody Brenlove, George Crouch, and Nancy Jennings. The last
of these was given later in Butler. .

The second long play was George Kelly’s “The Torch Bearers,” which was pre-
sented at two performances, February 19 and 20. This was a comedy on the little
theater movement. It was played by Annette N osoff, George Crouch, Florence Blose,
Margaret Porch, Charles Seif, Nancy Jennings, Alexander Shaw, Brookie Renner, and
Nelson Runger.

“The Dover Road,” A. A. Milne’s comedy, was the last play of the season. It
was given May 16. The cast consisted of  M. Cameron, Rhody Brenlove, Brookie
Renner, George Crouch, Bessie Kann, Robert Saling, Nancy.Jennings, Annette Nosoff,
and Elmer Klaber.

Pitt Players owed credit for its unusual success this season to Mrs. Madge Blount
MacQueen, who directed the productions. In her charge, the organization has
attained the rank of a major activity, and the calibre of the work produced has been
heightened considerably.

The presentation of plays has been hampered by the lack of proper facilities. The
technical staff, though, continued to make improvements under the direction of E.
VVillis Whited. Most of the scenery was designed by J. M. Cameron, and the stage
management was in the hands of J. E. McLean. Other students on the technical
staff were: Robert Murray, Max Fromm, W. D. Carothers, W. W. Minor, Robert
Donaldson, Evelyn Tonkonogy, and Frances Reitmeyer.

In addition to presenting plays, the Players held a cabaret dinner dance in the
Heinz House, and several theater parties.

The oﬂicers for the 1924-25 season were: Frances Reitmeyer, President; Donald
Brown, Vice President; Annette Nosoff, Secretary; Robert Murray, Treasurer;  E.
McLean, Business Manager; and Professor Percival Hunt, Faculty Advisor. Wayde
Bloom held the ofﬁce of Business Manager during the first semester.

Cap and Gown History

Some nineteen years ago this spring, let it be solemnly recorded, one thousand
and one derby hats suffered severe concussion of the dome at a certain first night held
at the Nixon theater. The carnage in their numbers resulted from an enthusiastic
audience going into spasms of approval over a play entitled, “In \Vupland,” a vehicle
which marked the birth of the University Cap and Gown Club. The project was
run under the guidance of Dr. J. S. Ashbrook, an instructor in the Dental school.
The actors were chosen from his men students.

Derby hats have long since gone by the boards but Cap and Gowners still play
to full houses every spring. The organization has been extended to include the entire
male population of the University and a place in the cast or chorus has become one of

the most coveted of campus honors.

“Castles in Spain,” written by Walter B. Edmundson, present director of the
club and, like Dr. Ashbrook, a one-time member of the University of Pennsylvania
lwask and Wig Club, was this season’s hit. A cast made up of such men as Kuntz,
Hetzel, Hillary, Durnell, Winters, Johnston, Lill'ar, Thomas, Rogers and Long, will
not soon be forgotten. The play appeared here at the Nixon theater on May 7, 8,
and 9, following performances at Johnstown and VVashington, Pa. It met with high
approval. Another tour through Pennsylvania and West Virginia followed the home
appearances. The out of town performances, the first held in a number of years,
were arranged by George VVhite, manager of the club.

The Band

The University of Pittsburgh Band was organized in 1911 under the leadership
of Saul Sabad and Don Kirk. Instruments were purchased with money contributed by
students and alumni. lts first public appearance was made on Forbes Field, Saturday,
October H, 1911, at the football game with Ohio Northern University.

Six years later, l9l7, NI. S. Rocereto, well known musician and band director,
was placed in charge of the organization. Under his direction, the band has developed
until it now includes more than fifty pieces and has a nation—wide reputation.

After two years under the student leadership of George Davis, Col. ’2-l, the band
opened the 1924-25 season with L. W. Jordan as leader. Coach l\I. S. Rocereto
continued in the capacity he has held for eight years, and Professor Gustav L. Schramm
continued as faculty advisor. The student managership, held for the three previous
years by  Loomis Christian, was taken over by Paul Stewart, Bus. Ad. '25. H. B.
Gentzel succeeded Jordan as student leader in the spring term.

The band played at all of the home football games during the season, and accom-
panied the team to the game with Syracuse University at Syracuse. While on this
trip, the band paraded through the streets of Buffalo, and made a vaudeville debut
after the game in the B. F. Keith Theater at Syracuse.

Numerous concerts were given during the season throughout the Pittsburgh dis-
trict, including one at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. The fourth annual home
concerts were held April l5 and 16. The programs, which included a number of
solo features, were received with an unusual degree of enthusiasm.

Keys were awarded to the members at the annual banquet, which brought the
season to a close.

Girl ’5 Glee Club

The 1924-25 season of the Girls’ Glee Club saw the first home concert ever held
separately from that of the men. May 1, the Club presented a program in Carnegie
Music Hall, open to the public. It was well attended, and the program was received
with enthusiasm. The concert will be made an annual event.

The diversified program contained numbers by the ensemble, the quartet, and
several soloists. Two readings and four piano selections were also given. Special
accompaniments on the organ were features.

The ensemble selections were Tschaikowsky’s “Dawn,” “The Gleaners,” by
VVoodcock, Blackwell’s “Rest,” Rachmaninoff’s “Glorious Forever,” “Zingarese Sere-
nade” by Silver, Warner’s “Dance of the Leaves,” and “Little Papoose” by Sherwood.

Marie Ewing, the accompanist, played the following numbers from Mendelssohn:
“Spinning Song, Op. 67, No. -1-”; “Melody, Op. 19, No. 1"; and “Humming Song,
Op. 19, No. 3.” “The Dumb-Waiter’s Diﬁiculty,” a reading, was given by Helen
M. Studer, and Kathryn Rowell read a scene from “The Rivals” by Sheridan.

Negro melodies were one of the Club’s specialties during the season. Those that
were included on most of the programs were: “Nobody Knows de Trouble l’ve
Seen,” by Burleigh—Page; and Dvorak—Fisher’s “Goin’ Home.”

The quartet of the Club was composed of Ruth Smith, Dorothy Douthitt, Anne
Nathanson, and Kay Parker. Anna Schaab was President of the organization, and
it was managed by Mildred Pickrell. Mrs‘. Charles E. Mayhew directed the Club.

Numerous concerts were held during the season in the vicinity of Pittsburgh.
In May, a trip was made to Eric.

Girl ’r Debating C lab

The Girl's Debating Club held four debates during the 1924-25 season. Two
were held in Pittsburgh, and two were away from home. Theresa Kahn was President
of the organization, and the management of the debates was in the hands of Mary
\Varga. Professor W. M. Parrish and Raymond F. Howes, both of the public
speaking department, coached the teams.

A triangular debate with George \Vashington University and VVest Virginia
University on the Supreme Court question opened the season, March 14-. Gertrude
Siegal, Dorothy Knina, and Jean Ballou defeated the \Vest Virginia team at lVIorgan-
town, and Margaret Porch, Catherine Plaster, and Teresina lVIarino won from the
George VVashington University team in Carnegie Lecture Hall.

The other two debates were of the open-forum type, and no decisions were given.
April 18, Emily Thurber, Gertrude Siegal, and Theresa Kahn met with a team from
Ohio State University, in Carnegie Lecture Hall. May 1, Catherine Plaster and
Emily Thurber debated the girl’s team at Swarthmore College.

The number of girls participating in debate try—outs during the season exceeded
by far those of other years. All of the decision debates were won, and the technique
of the debators showed marked improvement.

All of the ability of the University is not found on the gridiron or athletic ﬁelds. 

In debating it has ﬁrmly established a high reputation. lVIore debates were scheduled 
during 1924-25 than in previous years, and the number.of different ‘questions debated 
was unequaled the country over. The debating squad also increased, and the attendance 
at debates improved. 
The 1924-25 season opened in Carnegie Music Hall, October 3, when the Uni» 

versity debaters met with debaters from Oxford University, England. This was the
first‘ international debate in which the University has participated, and the first in a

47‘ ‘E’ :7‘?

series‘of American debates which took the English team to the Paciﬁc coast. One of 
the English debaters was Malcolm MacDonald, son of Ramsay MacDonald, at that 
time Prime Minister of Great Britain. The Pittsburgh debaters were Chauncey 

Pruger and James M. Couse, both of the Law School, and George W. Davis, of the

45-.

College. MacDonald debated with Pruger and Couse. Davis debated with the 
other two Oxford men. 

The audience voted in favor of the team composed of MacDonald, Pruger, and 
Couse, which attacked the question, “Resolved, that the extension of state interference 

with the individual is a chief evil of the times.” An attendance of four thousand was
recorded at this debate.

In the annual triangular debate held December 5 with Pennsylvania State College
and Washington and Jefferson College, the University’s team defeated W. & J. at
Washington. The State debate in Carnegie Lecture Hall was awarded to Pitt by

A neutral ground debate with West Virginia was held in East Pittsburgh,

Western Reserve University sent its first men’s team to Pittsburgh, January 23.
James Barnett, E. Basil Welsh, and Leo Shapiro composed the University's team.
A verdict for Western Reserve was given by the single judge, Elbert R. Moses.

February 13, a forum-type debate was held with Swarthmore, at Swarthmore.
James K. Mierley and Norman lVIattis spoke for Pitt. As the debate adhered strictly
to the forum method, no decision was given.

team had appeared on American soil. Fred Hamlin, James Barnett, and A. L.

Young Man ’J C /2 rz'sz‘z'm1 ﬂ55ocz'atz'on

Organized in 1911 to give expression to student ideals, the University of Pitts-
burgh branch of the Young Men’s Christian Association has gradually enlarged its
activities until it now stands as the only organization on the campus that provides for
the spiritual, social, and practical welfare of men students at the University.

Through the maintenance of the “Y” Hut, it makes available a social and
recreational center where wholesome, inexpensive meals, facilities_for study, games,
writing, and checking books and wraps, and a general atmosphere of good fellowship
attract almost one thousand students daily. The publication of the freshman hand-
book each year, the management of the Senior—Counselor system, and the holding of
the Basketball Banquet are examples of the way in which the “Y” is serving the
campus.

Through discussion groups, weekly Wednesday-noon meetings, and the “Y”
Open Forum, and through cooperation with the local churches, interest is aroused
and maintained in Christian ideals and in their application to life.

The program of “Y” activities is under the direction of a Student Cabinet, of
which the oﬂicers are elected annually by the student members of the Association.
Cabinet members are appointed by the President, and each selects the members of his
committee, to which is intrusted a special branch of the Association’s program. The
entire body of cabinet and committee members form the Y. M. C. A. Student Council,
which meets frequently to consider policies.

The general administration of the Association is vested in a Board of Manage-
ment, composed of students, faculty members, alumni, and trustees of the University.
An executive secretary and his associates are on duty at the hut at all times and are
ready to aid students in any problems.

The organization is financed by voluntary student contributions solicited during
a campaign held in the early fall. No stated membership fee is set, and the amount
of the contribution is left to the individual’s judgment.

The 1924-25 season opened with a Retreat held at the Deer Creek United
Presbyterian Church, near Bakerstown. The first campus activity was the annual
Senior—Counselor Banquet, at which several hundred incoming Freshmen were intro-
duced to their senior counselors and to the traditions of the University. In the
financial campaign, almost $5,000 were obtained. This amount barely covered the
maintenance of the Hut.

The Open Forum met regularly on Tuesday evenings for the discussion of some
controversial subject, and a series of Wednesday-noon meetings was successfully com-
pleted. The l925 Basketball Banquet is generally considered the best ever held.
The “Y” was appointed by the Men’s Self Government Association to conduct the
1925 Men’s Vocational Guidance Conference.

Pit/zz'72 C lid)

“In January, 1914, when Dr. Elizabeth Martin, who was at
the time Dean of Women at the University of Pittsburgh, requested
Dr. Hugh T. Kerr of the Shadyside Presbyterian Church to teach
a small group of students, she little realized that she was making a
suggestion to Dr. Kerr which was to give him an opportunity for a
religious work among students, the inﬂuence of which would prove
both far-reaching and permanent.” In these words is recorded the
origin of the Pitkin Club in the history read at the tenth anniversary
celebration, February 3, 1924-.

At the time the club was founded, 1914, there was no organized
religious work at the University. Neither the Y. M. C. A. nor the
Y. W. C. A. maintained secretaries, and none of the now numerous
religious clubs had come into existence. A

The new organization was named the Pitkin Club after
Horace Tracy Pitkin, an American missionary who was killediin the
Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Its purpose is to study the various mission
ﬁelds and their needs, and to promote interest in Christian work.

It has now grown to an organization of ninety members,'and
its reputation attracts to its meetings practically every missionary
that visits Pittsburgh. During the season of 1924-25, a study of
China was made under the leadership of Dr. Kerr.

The oflicers of the club were: Bertram Kenyon, President;
Walter Rome, Vice President; Grace Hartmann, Secretary; Eliza-
beth Seville, Treasurer; and Elizabeth Highberger, Historian.

Young Women ’s Cl2rz'stz'an As.rocz'atz'on

The Young Women’s Christian Association maintains an organization at the
University which attempts to emphasize Christian ideals in the daily lives of the
women students. Standing for the three-fold development of mind, body, and spirit,
it seeks to present the perspective of life as a whole.

A general secretary is on duty at all times, and a number of student officers and
committees execute the Association’s program. There are the Social, Financial, Pub-
licity, and Membership Committees which arrange and supervise teas, matters pertain-
ing to ﬁnance, posting of notices, and the enrollment of new members. The World
Fellowship Committee strives to unite girls of different nationalities. It holds discus-
sion. groups and has charge of several weekly meetings. The Social Service Committee
cooperates with the city settlement houses by sending girls to be teachers and leaders
of settlement classes. The programs of the regular Monday noon meetings are
arranged by the Committee on Religious Education. Leaders in religious, political,
and intellectual ﬁelds are obtained as speakers. Discussion groups, Bible study, and
informal gatherings of many kinds unite the efforts of the Association and sustain the
interest of the members. ‘

The work of these committees affords opportunities for new friendships, Christian
fellowship, stimuli to honest thinking, discussion of vital subjects, and practical training
in leadership and service. The local Association, in accord with the National Student
Assembly of the Young Women’s Christian Association, declares as its objective: “We
unite in the determination to live unreservedly Jesus’ law of love in every relationship,
and so to know God."

Collem bola Club

The Collembola Club of the University of Pittsburgh was organized in February,
1923, by a group of students interested in the Natural Sciences. In organization and
methods it is modeled after the Agassiz Club of Cornell University and the Natural-
ists’ Field Club of the University of Pennsylvania. The name of the club is taken
from that of a “small, primitive insect, which has the habit of being very active.”

Its purpose is to promote a closer union among students interested in Zoology,
Botany, and Geology, and it lays special emphasis upon ﬁeld study, made possible by
regular ﬁeld trips. VVhile oﬂicers of this club must be undergraduates, membership
is open to any person interested in the club's activities, whether studying natural
sciences or not. lVIembership is not required for participation in meetings and trips
of the club. The dues are nominal.

Through the kindness of members of the faculty, of the staff of Carnegie
lvluseum, and others, the. club hears an interesting, illustrated talk at each meeting.

The publications include the Collembola Club Bulletin which carries notices of
the meetings and of the trips, and the Collembola Song Book, a compilation of old
and new Biological Ditties together with some songs of local interest.

The Collembola Club is represented in Africa by an ex-president, Rudyerd
Boulton, with the expedition of the American Museum, and in the Sargasso Sea by
lay F. W. Pearson, another ex-president, with William Beebe’s expedition.

women. It has as its purpose the promotion of social activities among
its members. The society meets regularly and during the year holds
various social events. A Framasor dance is held annually. lwembers

grown rapidly until it now has one of the largest active memberships
of any organization of its kind on the campus. Oflicers are elected
every spring for a year's term. Jack Crandall, Col. ’25, was presi-

dent of the society this year.

Pitt W eel:

The third annual Pitt Week was held May 20, 21, and 22. It opened \Vednes-
day morning in Soldiers’ lVIemorial Hall with an assembly of entertainment at which
the Druids tapped nine Freshmen. In the afternoon, the Freshmen defeated the
Sophomores, 3 to 1, in a pushball contest: and the Dental School won the tug-of-war
from the School of Business Administration. The annual migratory dance was held
VVednesday night. Twenty-one fraternity houses, elaborately lighted and decorated,
were open. _

A lVIay Day festival and a girl’s play were presented in Carnegie lylusic Hall,
Thursday afternoon. Anne Schaab was crowned May Queen, and in her honor was
given Stuart Walker's Trimj)/el, directed by Mrs. lwadge Blount l\'IacQueen.
Thursday evening, Varsity Nite was held in the Music Hall. In addition to a number
of vaudeville stunts, Omicron Delta Kappa tapped nine men.

Friday was the big day. In the afternoon, Dorothy Russell of Kappa Alpha
Theta won the interfraternity scooter race; Nina Johnston, also of Kappa Alpha
Theta, won the roller-skating contest; and’ Pi Lambda Phi placed first in the animal
sweepstakes. In the last event, Phi Kappa won second place, and Kappa Sigma, third.
Before the races, The Pittsburgh Roast, a burlesque publication of Sigma Delta Chi
and the Pittsburgh Post, was distributed. A mammoth dance in Duquesne Garden,
Friday evening, climaxed the celebration.

The committee was appointed early in February when Student Council ratified
the names selected by M. S. G. A. and W. S. G. A. George M. Durschinger, Jr..,
was general chairman, and his committee was composed of John V. VVatkins, J. VVra_v
Connolly, Robert Fleming, l\/Iartha Schmucker, James Walsh, Charlotte Beachler,
VV. J. Dunford, Jeanne Muter, and F. C. Coulter. The committee later elected
VV. G. S. McKee as business manager.

Pitt VVeek was first held in 1923, with Dick Holbrook as chairman. John G.
Stewart headed the committee in 1924.

T he Stazlzﬂm

N the summer of 1923 it was officially announced that the University was
to build a stadium on the property bounded by Terrace, Lothrop, and
Aliquippa streets This gigantic structure would house in superb fashion
all of Pitt’s athletic organizations, and would provide a place in which
thousands might view their competitions. Enthusiasm was spontaneous,
and immediate steps were taken to make the project a reality.

The first steam shovel bit into the hill on the stadium site, August 7, 1924-, and
it was not long until two thousand cubic feet of earth were being moved daily to
Trees Field, where it was used to establish a new level. By the middle of October,
concrete was being poured for the foundation, and construction of the 220-yard
straightaway began. As this track is longer than the stadium, a special starting
tunnel with a cent; span of ﬁfteen feet was bored under Trees Field.

  

Steel girders began to arrive early in February, and the staccato clatterof riveting
hammers dominated the atmosphere. Starting on the west end, the structural work
curved day by day toward DeSota street, and was completed before the end of lVIay.
By this time enough of the concrete for the outer walls and bench banks had been
poured to give an idea of the ﬁnished appearance. The field down in the bowl had
been cleared and seeded, and the quarter-mile track, which surrounds the field, was
spread with cinders. Everything indicated that it would be ready for the ﬁrst game
of the 1925 football season.

With a seating capacity of 70,000, the stadium measures 791 feet from end to
end, almost three city blocks, and 617 feet in width. Its area is more than nine acres.
The field itself covers 3.63 acres, extending 563 feet in length, and 343 feet in width.

L

From the field level, the stands reach up sixty feet, but the outside wall at the DeSota
street entrance towers to a height of ninety feet. Seven other entrances also give
access to the stadium.

It not only provides 21 football field, but also a baseball diamond, a grass court
for tennis, one of the finest quarter-mile tracks in the country, and a basketball pavil-
ion that will hold -l,000 spectators. Commencements, pageants, and large public
meetings can also be held in the bowl.

The project was handled by a special stadium committee, composed of alumni and
trustees of the University. Headed by Homer D. \/Villiarns, its members were A. R.

Finances were provided through a bond issue. Under the direction of Carleton
G. Ketchum, ’l6, the sale opened l\oy’e111ber 10, 192-}. The goal was to be $2,100,000
ht-fore the end of the year, hut within fourteen days the issue was oyersuhscrihed by

$400,000.

W. S. Hindman, who was designing engineer for the Ohio State'University
stadium, designed the structure and supervised its construction. Stone and VVehster
of Boston were consulting engineers. The excavation and preliminary work was done
h‘y the John F. Casey Company of Pittsburgh, and the New England Foundation
Company sank the concrete on which the McClintic—Marshall Company, of Pitts-
burgh, erected the steel structural work. The Turner Construction Company of
New York completed the stadium.

T he Radio Stua’z'o

Since its inception in l\Iarch, 1924, the University radio studio of station KDKA,
located on the second floor of State Hall, has gradually gained a national reputation
as a broadcasting center of educational programs. It is under the management of
l\/Iiss Mary Frances Philpott, who succeeded Miss Helen Ostrander, Assistant to the
Chancellor, in the summer of 1924-.

In the opening program, March 31, 1924, the studio was presented to the Univer-
sity by H. P. Davis, Vice President of the VVestinghouse Electric and Manufacturing
Company, and known the country over as “the father of broadcasting.” Chancellor
john G. Bowman gave a talk accepting the gift, and explaining how the University
intended to use it in offering some of the advantages of the school to the thousands of
radio listeners who were unable to enjoy them in the usual way. These two men
also spoke on the first anniversary program, i\”Iar<:h 30, 1925.

The agreement made between the University and the VVestinghouse Company
was that KDKA would assume the responsibility of installing and maintaining the
technical equipment, while the University, with a full-time radio manager, would
provide the programs, largely from its faculty and student body. '

Educational talks in every ﬁeld of learning, popular addresses by prominent
individuals connected with the University, and musical programs by members of the
student body, were included in the long list of programs presented during the studio’s
first year. Among these, the most popular were courses broadcast in series of from
six to twelve weekly programs. The following series were given: The Contemporary
Novel, Party Gotuermnent in the United States, The Role of Chemistry in Every-Day
Life, Evolution and /{ere/lity, Developing a Pleasing Personality, American Foreign
Policy, Seience in Industry, Conversations "with a Philoso/)her, Great English Story
Tellers, and The Fra/7zeu'or1' of the World.

The Cathedral of Learning

V /“T was an epochal moment when Chancellor John G. Bowman announced

that the University of Pittsburgh would erect a 52—story structure on

Frick Acres. Breaking all traditions of campus architecture, colossal in

size, magniﬁcent in appearance, yet entirely practical for educational

 purposes, the proposed Cathedral of Learning was heralded enthusiasti-

cally the world over. Not only would it be a monument to education, but also an

embodiment of Pittsburgh’s spirit of achievement. Captivated by the grandeur and

signiﬁcance of this idea, a citizen's committee of one hundred business, industrial, and

civic leaders of Pittsburgh undertook the task of obtaining the $10,000,000 necessary

for its construction. Within two months, $7,000,000 of this amount had been raised
in one of the most extensive public campaigns Pittsburgh has ever known.

Of pure Gothic design, the building will tower-to a heighth of 680 feet, making
it the highest building in Pittsburgh, and one of the highest in the world. White
Kentucky limestone will probably be used in its construction. At its base it is to be
360 feet long and 260 feet wide. Its 52 stories, together with the present buildings,
will enable the University to offer adequate classrooms, shops, libraries, laboratories,
and recreation centers for 12,000 students. Four entrances, with a main doorway 39
feet high, will give access to the first floor, and a battery of 16 elevators will carry
students from ﬂoor to floor with ease.

One or more floors in the building will be set aside for the use of student
activities, and all recognized student organizations will have rooms designed especially
for their use. Space costing about $750,000 is to be devoted to this purpose. The
Student Union, including a modern Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A., and a large dining
room, will be on about the sixth ﬂoor. It will be a great common meeting place for
all students.

For three years the Trustees of the University had sought to enlarge the physical
capacity of the school to hold the ever increasing student body. Gradually the idea
of the Cathedral of Learning evolved in the mind of Chancellor Bowman. Enthused
by the opportunity to express in this building the purpose of the University, he took
his idea to Mr. Charles Z. Klauder, America’s foremost student of collegiate Gothic
architecture. After much experimentation and thought, Mr. Klauder produced the
plan that the Trustees adopted. '

“The buttresses of the building,” said Dr. Bowman in explaining the design,
“rising unadorned, are the supreme use of mass and proportion. By some sort of
instinct in us, these and parallel perpendicular lines convey a mood of power. This
feeling of power in the design is further increased by the horizontal endings of the
buttresses and of the central tower. They do not arrive at their limits; in them is
force still to go higher. Utter simplicity and the lack of ornamentation emphasize
this theme. ~

“Force and power, however, are not all that is wanted. Where is the spiritual
quality? The answer to this is that at each corner of the tower, conspicuous by its
position, occurs "Gothic ornamentation. The character of this ornamentation, here in
contrast to the otherwise stern simplicity of the building, means to us, through cen-
turies of association with church buildings, a mood of Worship and of reverence.

“Here, then, fabricated out of steel and stone, the steel seeming to be a bit of
Pittsburgh itself, is a structure with more power, spirit of achievement, and reverence
in it than has ever before been attempted in the world.”

After adoption by the Trustees, the plans were presented before a gathering of
prominent citizens and faculty members at a dinner in the University Club, November
13, 1924. Enthusiasm in the project came to a climax at a second gathering, this
time of 1,000 people, in the William Penn Hotel, January 29, when Judge Elbert H.
Gary spoke in its favor.

Shortly afterwards, lVIr. Homer D. Williams, chairman of the special committee
of 100 citizens that had been studying the University’s needs, announced that his
organization would immediately undertake the task of getting the $10,000,000 neces-
sary for the Cathedral’s erection. Hamilton Stewart, capitalist and business leader,
was assigned the campaign chairmanship for the Pittsburgh district.

An imposing group of business, industrial, and civic leaders pledged their support
to the campaign, and it opened May -1 with one-third of the total sum already sub-
scribed. Gifts of $100,000 were received from Hamilton Stewart, Joseph Trees,
Harry Croft, and George H. Clapp.

Continuing until May 21, the intensive public campaign came to an end with a
total sum of $6,452,303. Of this amount, $300,000 were subscribed by the West-
inghouse interests; $250,000 by the United States Steel Corporation; $140,000 by
the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation; $112,101 by Kaufmann’s; and $100,000
by the Joseph Home Company interests. The alumni contributed more than
$900,000, and a large amount was given by the student body.

The campaign, however, continued quietly after the public drive closed, and at
the annual banquet of the alumni association, June 10, Chancellor Bowman announced
that building operations would begin in October.

Kartabo

In the midst of South American jungles, sixty miles inland from Georgetown,
British Guiana, the Departments of Botany and Zoology of the University of Pitts-
burgh operate a biological laboratory for the study of tropical plant and animal life.
Here, during the summer of 1924, eight students were sent under the direction of
Professor Alfred Emerson.

The Kartabo laboratory is located between two tributaries of the Essequibo
river, the Mazaruni and the Cuyuni, each a mile wide. In these streams is a wealth
of water life: tiny ﬂying ﬁsh, puffers which inﬂate themselves to prevent being swal:
lowed, sharp—toothed cartabacs and perai capable of biting off one’s finger, 259—pound
catfish, electric eels, giant lizards, and iguanas. ‘

Jungle trails lead out from the laboratory. Along them are found ants which
sting and bees which bite, snakes, ant—eaters, and armadillos. Unknown trees and
shrubs, matted with vines,—between them razor grass and bushes—often thorned,
grow wildly in all directions.

The station was established in 1916 by Mr. William Beebe, author and natural-
ist. Professor Emerson of the university faculty had accompanied Beebe to Kartabo
on a number of trips, and through this friendship Mr. Beebe was led to offer the use
of the place and its equipment to the University for three years, 1924, 1925, and 1926.
The work of Professor Harold D. Fish, head of the Zoology Department, in collect-
ing finances for the expedition made it possible to accept the offer.

In the first Pitt group at Kartabo were three graduate students: Stanton C.
Crawford, Hugh Rays, and Carl lVIcC0nnell. The undergraduates were Clarence
B. Penrod, VVilliam A. lweyers, Edward Graham, Jay F. W. Pearson, and Kenneth
Doutt.

HE first prominent social event of the year, the annual lnterfraternity
Ball, was held Friday evening, January 16, in the Hotel Schenley. More
than three hundred couples participated in the Grand hlarch, led by
Harold F. Latham, President of the lnterfraternity Conference, honoring
l\'Iiss Phyllis L. Newlands, ’2-l-.

Joseph Nesbit’s Orchestra, one of the llnest dance orchestras in Pennsylvania,
responded with encore after encore to the applause of the fraternity men and their
partners.

Page Fom‘ Hmzdrnl Twelve

During the Grand March, programs in blue, stamped with the gold seal of the
University, were given out to the dancers. Dancing continued until eleven o’clock,
when supper was served in the two dining rooms adjoining the ballroom, decorated
with palms and Japanese lanterns. The tables were marked with place-cards bearing
the names of the fraternities in the lnterfraternity Conference. Following this inter-
mission, paper hats, horns, and other novelties were distributed as the couples resumed
dancing until after two o’clock.

Among the patrons and patronesses were listed the following University officials:
Chancellor and l\/Irs. john G. Bowman, Dean and l\I1‘s. Louis K. lVIanley, Mr. and
l\Irs. Sidney S. Hoehl, and Dean Thyrsa VV. Amos.

C. R. VVilson, of Delta Tau Delta, was Chairman of the event, and had com-
pleted practically all arrangements when he was taken to the hospital with pneumonia.
The remaining details were attended to by the members of his committee: VV. G. S.

honoring Miss Lucy M. Chamberlain, ’2-l, of Delta Delta Delta. Due to the size of
the gathering, two supper services, the first at ﬁfteen minutes after eleven o’clock and
the second at twelve o’clock, were necessitated.

Never before had such elaborate decorations been attempted. Costumed figures
of French nobles, nymphs, and other artistic groupings were silhouetted from great
panels hung to the walls. Floods of lights in pastel colors streamed from behind them,
and the same effect was achieved with the ceiling lights, sheathed in delicate silks,
giving a delightful soft effect to the whole scene. Eliza Jane Reynolds, with the
help of Professor G. M. P. Baird of the English Department, was in charge of this
feature of the Prom.

Nearly hidden in their balcony behind palms, ferns, and a Haring canopy, Clark’s
Pennsylvanians, stellar melodists of the light fantastic, played number after number
for the enthusiastic dancers. The ﬁnal encore sounded as fresh as the first selection,
and the players made their escape only under the protests of the many remaining
couples.

Vanity cases of hammered silver were presented to the women as favors, and
everyone received a copy of the Prom Pom Buzzard. an annual publication of non-
sense and scandal issued by Sigma Delta Chi, national professional journalistic fra-
ternity.

Six weeks of preparation were required for the gala event, which was directed
by Robert W. VVinters of the School of Mines. He was assisted by a committee
composed of the following Juniors: Justice l\/lulert, Engineering School; James
Barnett, College; Eliza Jane Reynolds, College; Dorothy Neidhart, College; Hugh
Crossland, College; VVilliam Foraker, Mines; Helen Toay, Education; Anna Louise

ENIORS are usually too digniﬁed and serious to be of much pleasure,
but there was nothing dead or sad about the annual Senior Ball, held
Friday evening, April 17, in the Hotel Schenley ballroom. The Junior
Prom may have been more gorgeous, but the Senior Ball will certainly
be remembered when it is a question of hilarity and good times.

Amid streaming decorations of riotous colors, three hundred couples danced for
five hours to the music of the eleven—piece Prince of VVales Orchestra. Chairman
Lawrence E. Irwin, of Theta Chi, led the Grand l\/larch, honoring Miss Jean Ballou,

of Alpha Xi Delta. For the first time in years an undergraduate co—ed was honored
in this manner, and the student body was whole—hearted in its approval of the inno-
Evation.

E. The orchestra was one of the best heard at a "Pitt function in some time. Its
name was derived from the fact that it was engaged to play for the Prince of ‘Vales
‘during his stay on Long Island in the summer of 1924. Before playing at the Senior
,Ball it had just returned from a successful tour of the South. Its rise to prominence

ihas been phenomenal, and its standing is now comparable with the best dance orches-
ltras the country offers.

Freshman rules were abolished by a board of administration
oflicials before school opened in September, 1924. Consequently,
very few dinks were worn, and upperclassmen cried out that school
spirit was suffering from the break in custom. M. S. G. A., inﬂu-
enced by the protest, took a referendum to determine what the stu-
dents thought of the matter. A vote of 436 asked for reestablish-
ment of the rules, against 22 opposing votes. Legislative action
heeded the student wishes, and plans were made to revive the rules
in the fall of 1925.

Doing Your Best

The call to every man to do his best has had no ﬁner ex-
pression than this, penned by Josiah Wedgwood in 1787:

All worlu of taxte mutt hear a price in proportion to the
skill, tarte, time, expense and risk attending their inven-
tion and manufacture. Thore thing: called clear are, when
jurtly extimated, the cheapest; they are attended with much
let: proﬁt to the artist than there which ever}/hoa’y calls
cheap. Beautiful form: and composition: are not made hy
chance, nor can they ever, in any material, he made at Jinall
expeme. A competition for cheapneu, and not for excellence
of worlamanxhip, tJ‘ the mort frequent and certain came of the
rapid decay and entire dertruction of art; and manufactures.

Following the principles laid down by Wed ood has
brought the dental profession from a lowly "tra<feV,V' ' deeply
infected by charlatanism in 1839, to its present proud
position—an acknowledged world beneﬁcence.

In the earlier years its art outstripped its science. Its
practitioners were keen for practical results and it had at
its elbow a house willing and able to give it instruments
and materials that helped the dentists to do their best.

From its beginning in 1844, the House of White has
worked to prove that “the best is the cheapest," has refused
to enter into “a competition for cheapness." Its proudest
boast is that no one ever bought a poorly made article that
wore its trade-mark.

Excellence of workmanship is as necessary for the ad-
vancement of the dentist. But he cannot do his best with-
out the best tools.

ART PRINTS AND BLUE PRINTS

Painters, authors, and musicians win

fame and fortune by transmitting their
conceptions to paper. Achievement
can be completed merely with such
expression of an idea Not so with
engineering. The design of a turbine
or ofa ﬂat iron, once it is created, is
not placed upon a pedestal in a mil-
lionaire’s mansion, or in an art museum

It immediately goes into the shop-—
there to be executed. Its success is
measured by the degree to which it
ﬁts manufacturing requirements. If it
can't be manufactured economically

it is a failure.

In an organization like VVesting—
house there is a group of engineers
whose chief interest and concern is
the eﬁicient, economical, large scale
manufacture of electrical products.

These men may be electrical engineers

or mechanical engineers. They are
primarily interested in shop practice
and methods——in the same industrial
problems as are the manufacturing
customers whom Westinghouse serves.

The founder of Westinghouse was
such an engineer He possessed a mar-
velous faculty to inspire workmen and
executives alike; there are many tales
of men working nights and Sundays to
help him complete a cherished plan

Throughout all industry there is a
call for men qualiﬁed as manufacturing
engineers who can combine materials,
machines, men, and methods with
better and more efficient results.

Such men ﬁnd pleasure and inspir-
ation at VVestinghouse—developing
apparatus to help other manufacturing
executives solve similar problems in
every kind of industry

This advertisement is ﬁfth in I vocational series, outlining the fields
for engineering achievement in the Westinghouse organization.
Copies of the entire series will be sent to anyone requesting it.

g Vision

HE wise forward look—the intelligent
anticipation of future conditions—that
is vision.

  

“VVhere there is no vision the people
perish," said the sage of old. The sav-
age has no vision—-sees no future. There
can be no progress for him.

Every great achievement has been the
result of Vision.

It was the Vision of a young man which
foresaw that railway transportation fa-
cilities might be extended by a more
effective means of control—The Air
Brake. The world has benefited im-
measurably by the realization of that
Vision.

Age looks back with satisfaction upon
its accomplishments; youth sees potential
achievements with eager eye. “Your old
men shall dream dreams and your young
men shall see visions,” said one who
knew.

Progress will continue to be made as
Visions are seen and brought to real-
ization by Intelligent Training well-
directed.

Young men having technical education, who
are looking forward to a place of usefulness in
the field of Transportation may be interested
in our special course. Every year we train a
limited number for places of responsibility in

our organization.
