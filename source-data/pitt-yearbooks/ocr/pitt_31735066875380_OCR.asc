a helpful family are familiar
signs of moving at Pitt.

Only the Strongest

rrival Survival has become an integral
event—not just for freshman, but for
the entire campus and community,
too. Without the help of the coordinators,
supervisors, and volunteers at Arrival Survival,
the organized chaos of moving in would be
a nightmare. Whether it’s providing directions
to a parking lot, handing out carts, or offering
suggestions for an affordable hair salon, the
staff at Arrival Survival are there to help,
come rain or shine.
When I think back on my first time
moving into the University, I distinctly recall

Housing carts and

 

the heavy traffic on Meyran Avenue. With the
assistance of Arrival Survival personnel and
Pitt police, traffic on Forbes Avenue hesitantly
started ﬂowing as my parents and I cautiously
moved into a new chapter of our lives.

Much has changed about helping students
create their life on campus and throughout
the city. Arrival Survival doesn’t just include
assistance with moving boxes piled high in
the familiar blue and yellow housing carts, it
also services the adjustment to a new lifestyle.
There are shuttles to Target for dorm and
apartment necessities and Nationality Room
tours in the Cathedral of Learning. There are
also social activities such as a Day at the Spa
and Pilates classes, as well as Multicultural
Night, which draws as many upperclassmen
as freshmen.

Arrival Survival is a fitting name for
what goes on during those first crucial days.
The University provides almost everything
a student would need to begin a new school
year—and a new part of life.

f you’ve never attended one of Pitt’s sport-

ing events, you might be in shock at the

level of excitement and energy that
Panther fans generate. Whether watching a
game on TV or in person, Pitt fans are always
ready to cheer their team on to victory.

At Heinz Field during any of Pitt’s football
games, spectators are instantly greeted by
fans chanting, "Let’s Go Pitt," before they even
get to their seats. Once in the stands, the
students form a sea of blue and gold. They
roar when the team makes a touchdown. And
there’s also the sound of hands clapping
and feet stomping when the Panthers thwart
the opponent’s offense.

During the basketball season, you will
always catch Pitt fans on their feet and
cheering. Walking into the Petersen Events
Center, the Oakland Zoo, the student section,
is easy to find because the seats are packed

The fans of the Oakland Zoo cheer on every basketball game.

with those in bright T—shirts proclaiming

Pitt pride. Tickets are hard to come by, but
true fans are always rooting for the Panthers,
whether they are at the game or not.

Being a fan is contagious. There are more
than two sports at Pitt, and there are fans for
each. Attending one sporting event usually
makes students want to come back for more.
From track meets to wrestling and volleyball
matches to soccer and rugby games, Panther
fans of all ages support
their school.

Once a Panther fan, always a Panther fan.

Largely inspired by -his undergraduate days at the University
of Pittsburgh, Michael Chabon’s first novel started as his
graduate thesis. That manuscript, Mysteries of Pittsburgh,
eventually garnered him a $155,000 advance—the highest
ever for a first literary novel.

While at Pitt, Chabon studied under writer Chuck Kinder,
who was impressed by his student’s tenacity and motivation
to learn. Kinder must have equally impressed Chabon, because
it is rumored that the professor provided inspiration for the
main character, Grady Tripp, in Chabon’s second novel,
Wonder Boys. That novel made The New York Times’ notable

Abooks list and was adapted for the screen in 2000.

In 2001, Chabon’s novel The Amazing Adventures
of Kavalier and Clay Won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction
and received numerous other critical accolades. "Chabon’s

- thought, his sharp language, his inventiveness and his .

ambition make this a novel of towering achievement,"
read The New York Times’ book review.

ouldn’t it be great to get an

opportunity to speak to esteemed

writers about their work? At Pitt,
such opportunities are available through the
Pittsburgh Contemporary Writers Series—a
program that allows students to hear famous
novelists, essayists, and poets discuss their
works and answer questions about their
profession.

Sponsored by the University’s Writing
Program in conjunction with the Book Center,
Film Studies Program, Composition Program,
and the University of Pittsburgh Press, the
series is free and open to the public.

One of this year’s most memorable readings
was by Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club.
Following a screening and discussion of the
movie version of Fight Club, Palahniuk read
some of his short stories aloud to a crowded
auditorium of his fans—many of whom waited
for more than 30 minutes just to get the author’s
autograph. The excitement was palpable

animated speech.

when Palahniuk began to weave his tales,
but their often grotesque and graphic nature
didn’t sit well with everyone—at least four
people actually fainted while he read. Those
who remained conscious during the reading
stayed to hear him answer student—submitted
questions, and Palahniuk also gave prizes, such
as a giant plastic baby bottle, to the crowd.

Additional authors who visited campus in
the 2005-04 series included essayist Richard
Rodriguez (Hunger of Memory), author Rick
Moody (77oe Ice Storm), and poet Joel Brouwer
(Exactly What Happened). While most writers
in the series don’t make attendees faint, they
all make fans and future writers alike think,
learn, and dream.

mmmm  pizza  and doughnuts
 and hamburgers  and chocolate.
Unfortunately, these tasty treats
are notorious for showing up on a student’s
waistline. But when Pitt students’ jeans didn’t
fit, they didn’t worry—-there was hope. Pitt’s
numerous exercise facilities and self—help
programs motivated students to get fit and
practice a healthy lifestyle, thereby avoiding
snug jeans and the dreaded "freshman 15."
One of the benefits to on—campus housing
was the accessibility of the University’s state-
of—the—art exercise facilities. Litchfield Towers,
Lothrop Hall, Sutherland Hall, and the dorms
within Schenley Quad are among the buildings
that have exercise facilities on site. Housed in
the Petersen Events Center is the Baierl Student
Recreation Center, which offers students cardio
machines, free weights, and strength—training
equipment. Trees and Bellefield Halls not only
have workout facilities, but they also have
indoor swimming pools.

The chances to stay active didn’t stop
with Pitt’s facilities. There were also group
exercise classes such as aerobics and Pilates.
From racquetball and squash to volleyball
and ultimate Frisbee, intramural sports were
offered to students year-round. There was
even a program called "Getting Fit at Pitt"
to assist students in developing a health and
fitness regimen to suit their individual needs.
And for those who wanted to find ways to
experience the great outdoors, the Pitt Out-
doors Club organized activities such as hiking,
caving, and rafting. The club also provided
action-packed spring break adventures, from
skiing in Killington, Vt., to rock climbing in
Colorado.

With so many opportunities to stay in
shape, if we couldn’t squeeze into our jeans,
we had to squeeze time in to get to one of
Pitt’s workout facilities.

PITT ARTS made sure that we didn’t  out

in 1997 by the University’s Office of the Provost
to ensure that students have an opportunity
to take advantage of Pittsburgh’s exciting arts
and cultural offerings, PITT ARTS embodies
the concept that "the city is our campus."
Every year, more than 23,000 Pitt students
experience free and discounted entertainment
through the program, and PITT ARTS brings
undergraduate students to 110 free programs

a year. These include trips to experience the
most sought—after arts events in Pittsburgh, such
as the symphony, opera, ballet, films, concerts,
galleries, and the theater. Transportation is
provided, along with a catered reception
and tickets. There is always an educational
component to these outings that offers a
context to the encounter students have with art,
be it e—mailed essays, discussions with artists,
or hands—on Workshops.

PITT ARTS Wants Pitt undergrads from all
majors and academic disciplines to discover
and attend outstanding performances, While
graduate students, staff, and faculty can take
advantage of PITT ARTS ticket discounts.
The program also hosts an annual fall arts
fair that brings more than 50 arts organizations
to campus to meet Pitt students and get
them excited about the upcoming seasons.
Experiencing the culture of Pittsburgh through
PITT ARTS is a great enhancement to the
student experience on campus.

Cafe to the velvet ropes of Touch night-

club, the Strip District always had the
jammin’ tunes, discounted drinks, and giant
dance floor that many of the over—21 crowd
were looking for on a night out. For the more
subdued, there was always bar hopping in the
South Side, Shadyside, and the North Shore.

But a student didn’t have to be older than
21 to enjoy Pittsburgh’s nightlife. Through
PITT ARTS, for example, students could take
in musicals, plays, and ballets for free, or at
least very affordable prices.

The greatest addition to Pittsburgh nightlife,
however, was actually a bus route. Running
until 5 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, the
Ultraviolet (UV) Loop linked some of the most
dynamic Pittsburgh neighborhoods. It opened
up a whole new world of opportunity for
students.

"Before the UV loop, my friends and
I would either have to call a taxi or wait
around for what seemed like hours for a bus.
We used to get stuck at places that weren’t
so much fun because leaving was really a

hassle. With the UV Loop we can go from
Shadyside to Downtown to the Strip 
without worrying about how much it will cost
or how safe we are," said one student.

For those who preferred to stay on campus
for entertainment, nighttime in Oakland was
always abuzz. From seeing a movie sponsored
by the Pitt Program Council, attending a
reading at Hemingway’s, or shooting pool
in the William Pitt Union, there was always
something around to light up the night.

hat do rock-wall climbing, pumpkin
painting, and a nationally recog-
nized band all have in common?
They were all a part of the 200:3 Fall
Fest—an annual event sponsored by the Pitt
Program Council. Fall Fest has become the
ultimate study break from midterms and
papers—and a great reason to procrastinate.
The festivities started at noon outside the
William Pitt Union on a brisk Saturday in early
October. The entire block—Bigelow Boule-
vard from Fifth Avenue to Forbes—was closed
and filled with games and activities for the
college crowd. Pitt students could paint pump-
kins, put on a funny suit to jump onto a Velcro
wall, take daring pictures with unique animals
such as a boa constrictor, get temporary tattoos,
and scale a rock—climbing wall.

Pittsburgh

At 2 p.m., the winners of the contest for
best demo tape performed as the opening act
for the evening’s main attraction, a 5 p.m. show
by American Hi—Fi. Before American Hi—Fi came
on, a performance from the Mind Boxing Alliance
featured hip—hop DJ B—Bonics, who played
music for a troupe of break—dancers. Then,
American Hi—Fi finally hit the stage, playing
songs from its latest album for a little more
than an hour before calling it a night.

Fall Fest, as always, was a great success.
With the mixture of fun, interactive games,
music, and other talents, the celebration offered
students a brief respite from their studies.

here Was "much ado about something"

in 2003 in the Department of Theatre

Arts at the University of Pittsburgh—
especially with the unveiling of a newly
renovated theater.

The 2003-04 season opened with the much-
anticipated inauguration of the Charity Randall
Theatre, which along with the Henry Heymann
Theatre is housed in the Stephen Foster Mem-
orial. The 478—seat auditorium was named to
honor Randall, a devotee of literature, poetry,
and the arts. Improvements included restored

The newly renovated Charity

plush seats, new carpeting, safety lighting,
and a chandelier in the lobby. The renovations
resulted in important architectural enhance-
ments and a state—of-the-art space for student
performers.

Each year, faculty and students in theater
arts express humanity and celebrate community
on stage. They select plays and musicals based
on a script’s ability to provide education and
training opportunities and to contribute to the
cultural life both on and off campus. This has
been an important tradition since the
department’s founding in 1982.

Audiences enjoyed the spring 2003
performance of Pitt Repertory Theatre’s version
of Shakespeare’s Much Ado About N02‘/amg
and the fall 2005 drama Mot/oer Courage and
Her Children, Bertolt Brecht’s classic story
of War and resilience. The offbeat musical
Bat Boy and Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night
rounded out the season and gave audiences a
good reason to get to their feet and applaud.

he opportunities that students have at

Pitt aren’t necessarily listed on a course

syllabus, but they are available to every
student in every term. Internships, international
travel, a competitive education, and a stellar
staff of professors are always available, enabling
students to realize Pitt’s enduring traditions of
innovation and excellence.

My most memorable opportunity was
receiving the invitation to join the Kuntu
Repertory Theatre on its trip to South Africa
for the National Arts Festival under the leader-
ship of Vernell Lillie. When the plane landed
and the rigorous rehearsal and performance
schedule kicked in, I discovered that I was
a part of something spectacular.

Founded in 1974 by Lillie and Rob Penny,
Kuntu Repertory Theatre is part of the Depart-
ment of Africana Studies and showcases
the works of African American writers. It is

Pittsburgh

the second oldest Black theater company
associated with a major research institution,
and it gives students the chance to perform
with professionals. Kuntu Repertory Theatre
has produced more than 80 plays by such
playwrights as Penny, Wole Soyinka, James
Baldwin, and August Wilson. The touring
company has performed at such events as the
New Orleans Jazz Heritage Festival and the
Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The other students who went to South
Africa and I became immersed in the world
of dramatic art while being exposed to a new
culture. When the festival ended, we visited
the Apartheid Museum, Robben Island where
Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, and the
township of Soweto.

The experience was invaluable——another
Pitt opportunity that I will never forget.

Dick Thornburgh has had to deal with all kinds of challenges
through decades as a regional and national leader. From the
nuclear emergency at Three Mile Island to people misspelling

his name ("With an h at the end as in Pittsburgh," he used to .

say), there is much to learn from this icon.

Thornburgh served as governor of Pennsylvania (1979-87),
attorney general of the United States (1988-91), and under-
secretary-general of the United Nations (1992-93). He was
the only Republican to be elected governor of Pennsylvania

1 in two successive terms.

Thornburgh.’s connection to Pitt did not end when he
graduated from its School of Law in 1957. Today, the University
Library System contains the Dick Thornburgh Archives,
1,140 cubic feet of the leader’s personal papers. The archives

et’s be blunt: finding a job can be a

stressful process. Crafting a cover letter,

revising a resume, and pulling off the
perfect interview are key skills if students want
to put their Pitt education to good use.

So bring on the loud music, free food,
and candle making! All of those activities were
part of the Office of Career Services’ 2004
Career Fair kickoff. The entertainment was
accompanied by loads of information about
Career paths, internships, and job opportunities.
The next day, employers came to the William
Pitt Union in search of students to hire.

Pitt’s career services make finding a job-
a trying and sometimes—scary venture———less of
a challenge. Its fairs, offered throughout the
school year, are only one way the career
counselors guide students through the process.
The office also provides such services as walk-
in advising and mock interviews. Mock

interviewing is a helpful tool for undergrads
who are first—time job seekers. After a simulated

  

Mock interviews provide helpful tips for Panthers prowling for a job.

and videotaped interview, students receive
feedback regarding their presentation and
interviewing skills.

In addition, the career services office
runs PantherTRACS—an online service where
students can complete profiles, create resumes,
and search and apply for jobs. Career coun-
selors help students chart career plans and
answer questions regarding internships, part-
time positions, and searching for jobs. The
career services office is a one—stop shop for
graduating seniors and others in the arduous
job market—and, on occasion, candlemakers.

The job fair is a great way to meet and impress potential employers.

elling books. Packing up. Cleaning the

apartment. Studying for finals. Saying

good—bye to friends. The last week of
school is hectic for everyone! When it comes
around, students are both excited and sad.

On one hand, there’s the anticipation of
being done with the semester, not having
homework for at least three months, and going
home for the summer. At the same time, there
is the dread of being apart from good friends
and fun times on campus.

Most students begin their last week of
school studying for finals. Countless hours in
the library are an effort to review four months
of book readings and lectures. Then come the
dreaded finals themselves.

Once they’re over and the huge sense of
relief takes hold, its time to sell back the books.
Students flock to every bookstore and trailer
on campus to find the place where they can
get the most cash for their used books.

Finally, it’s time to pack up and move out.
This is arguably the worst process of all.

All of one’s belongings need to be packed;
walls need to be painted; and cupboards,
refrigerators, and carpets all need to be
cleaned. As the packing and cleaning frenzy

Study groups cram before finals.

ensues, it’s fun to remember all of the things
that have happened during the year. Excite-
ment for coming back in August already
starts to set in. Although for some another
great year at Pitt awaits, for those who are
graduating, the following months will bring
many changes—and possibly another round
of packing and moving to a new city for
a new job.

So, addresses and phone numbers are
exchanged with promises to keep in touch.
After all, Pitt friends are a second family.

hat guy from freshman studies class

seems to look more mature as he tries

on his cap and gown. That girl you
bumped into every year at the job fair looks
different in jeans; she is picking out a class ring.

The people who have been where you are
smile at you and welcome you. Someone
hands you a Pam‘/oer Prints book. You look
around one last time to make sure you are in
the right place. Did it all really go by this
quickly? It seems as if just the other day the
people wearing Arrival Survival T—shirts greeted
you. Now the T—shirts read “Alumni.”

Wait. No. As a volunteer turns around to
help the next student, you notice the writing
on the shirts actually reads "Welcome Almost
Alumni."

Alumni volunteers help seniors prepare for graduation.

Alumni

Welcome to Graduation Central!

This is the one—stop shop that makes you
realize that the end of your undergraduate
journey is just around the corner. You can pick
up many pieces of Pitt memorabilia to take
along after graduation and get ready for the
day you get your diploma. It’s also a great
place to bargain with classmates for an extra
commencement ceremony ticket!

The best part of Graduation Central is the
feeling of comfort when you see alums from
your hometown eager to enroll you in their
Pitt Club. It’s good to know that you can
continue experiencing Pitt traditions even in
the "real world."

an you feel it? Almost the moment you

slip on your cap and gown you begin

to feel excited, relieved, and nervous.
You remember four years of writing papers,
taking exams, and staying up all night cram-
ming. You realize that you are about to move
from one major stage in life to another. After
four years, the moment you have been waiting
for has finally arrived——commencement.

The University of Pittsburgh’s Commence-
ment Convocation has always been a joyous
occasion. Throughout the years, the ceremony
has been held at various places. In the 1960s
it was on the Cathedral lawn. Years after that

it took place at the colossal Mellon Arena
in downtown Pittsburgh. In 2002-03, comm-
encement moved closer to home in the new
Petersen Events Center.

It’s hard to believe you are a part of the
sea of blue—and—gold—capped students gather-
ing in the center of the main floor at the
Petersen Center. The processional begins as
class marshals lead each school. Electronic
signs along the arena border announce each
discipline as it enters. You look at the giant
screen broadcasting the events, and it’s still
hard to believe that you’re graduating.

As parents and family search for "their"
graduate, there is an overwhelming sense of
accomplishment in the center. You see your
parents. Excited and nervous at the same
time, you wave back at them. You did it!

Students get a chance
to jump into University

organizations at the
Student Activities Fair.

Making It In

uring the summer, some of us enjoy-
ed parties, traveled the country, and
went out with friends, while others
took classes and worked. However, as summer
ended, it was time to get back to business.
With a student body of more than 20,000,
the first week of classes at the University of
Pittsburgh is hectic and eXciting—and a crash
course in patience for almost every student.
The first week of classes is when we are
swamped with adjustments and decisions.
Standing in long lines at the Pitt bookstore
is a task that reminds us of our commitment
to academic excellence at the University.
We decide whether we should drop that
organic chemistry course so we can take that
astronomy course instead. We wonder if
we will be able to take on a part—time job.

Pittsburgh

What about all the organizations we signed
up for at the Student Activities Fair? Maybe
our first stop should be the time and stress
management class offered by fellow students.
It is difficult to leave the beautiful

summer life of good food, fun, and friends.
As the first week of classes comes and goes
and another week begins, we start to feel
more comfortable about the new school year.
Schedules get settled, familiar faces start
smiling back, and we become better adjusted
and happy to return to our home away from
home—the University of Pittsburgh.

and prestige of every Pitt graduate’s degree. Associate Vice Chancellor for Alumni Relations

In fact, as Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg

has said, “Many of the University’s greatest
accomplishments come through the life’s work
of our alumni.”

We, the alumni, are really the torchbearers
of the Pitt spirit. Some of our traditions are old.
The annual ceremony known as Lantern Night
was performed for the 83rd time last August,
for example. Others are new but promise to be
enduring like Arrival Survival, Graduation Central,
the opening of Alumni Hall for finals week
studying, and the book you hold in your hand.
These are some of the many traditions made
possible in part by the Pitt Alumni Association.

The

First Steps

undreds of incoming freshmen are

seated in the crowded Petersen

Events Center. Many are talking to
newly made friends while others are thinking
of the parents who had left them only a half-
hour before. They are ready for the thrills and
changes that await them as they embark on
their new collegiate careers. All they need
is some direction.

As Freshman Convocation begins, a line
of alumni, followed by Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg, walks in. The low whispering
and rustling of seats hushes as students
prepare to hear the words of the man who
represents their University. As the freshmen

hear stories from alumni about days gone by
at Pitt and words of assurance that they will
succeed, there is a sense of calm relief in
the crowd. The ceremony has reminded them
of something important and welcoming—
that they are a part of Pitt.
With a newfound sense of unity, the

freshmen wander to the outside plaza where
they are greeted by the aroma of free food,

soon to become a staple in their college lives.

Conversations start, and new friendships
are formed. Pitt is not only a place with

a tradition and rich culture, it is also a place
welcoming of new perspectives and experi-
ences. This is best seen during Freshman
Convocation, where the message is clear
and concise—Welcome to Pitt!

 Mater, wise andﬁlorious
Child of Light and Bride of Truth
Over fate and foe victorious
Dowered with eternal youth.
Crowned with love of son and daughter
Thou shalt conquer as of yore.
Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater
God preserve Thee ever more!

First beyond the mountains founded,
Where the West-road opens free,
Where twin-river, forest bounded,

 mlylegrgle and journey t’ward'the Sea;

 W in the dawning of the nation, .

_Erehthe clouds of strife had cleared   it  “'

’Rose thy rough-hewn habitation 
By our prophet fathers reared.

Close thy mother love embraces
All who gather at thy knee,

Mother, are as one to Thee;
Thou, who unto knowledge bore us,
In the good old days long gone, ‘
Raise Thy Gold and Blue high o’er us,  ’
Lead and we will follow on.

   

ongratulations to the class of 2004! It’s hard to believe

that graduation is upon us. Somewhere between

the beginning and the end of our Pitt experience,
we found within ourselves the things that will define us
in the future.

Besides defining ourselves, we also helped shape this
University. The theme for the Student Government Board
(SGB) during my term as president was Every Panther
Leaves Its Mark, and as seniors, we have all left our mark on
this University. An example of this is Panther Pride Campus
Wide—the day before homecoming when we scheduled
campus-wide events to ignite enthusiasm in students. It’s just
one part of our class legacy.

Graduation is quite an achievement, and we should
remember that a journey to achievement is never traveled
alone. I would like to thank the chancellor, who has always
made student needs his priority. The work and devotion
of SGB adviser Joyce Giangarlo kept our office functioning.
I also appreciate Donna Mihalik, who keeps our office
together, and my board and committees. Without their help,
we could never have accomplished as much as we did.

When we leave Pitt’s campus—our home away from our
home—we will remember the classes that we took or the
dorms that we lived in. We will look back to the late nights

we spent putting together a program or the games we played.

We won’t forget our all—nighters or the last minute meetings
we called to ensure the success of our organizations.

I thank you for having enough faith to elect me as
your SGB president. In return, I have faith that we will all
have success beyond our expectations and imaginations.
In that way, we will uphold the name of the University
of Pittsburgh. Best of luck!

to educating the whole student, determined
that every Pitt graduate, regardless of

four key attributes: communications skills, a sense
of motivation, a sense of responsibility, and a
sense of self. I am confident that these attributes
will hold you in good stead in the years ahead.
I congratulate you on your graduation. You

o Night

n 1920', an elaborately costumed senior

queen, complete with her entourage,

officiated at the University of Pittsburgh’s
annual Lantern Night ceremony. She was
elected the previous spring by her classmates
on criteria such as character, personality,
academic achievement, social qualities, and
leadership contributions to the University.
The Lantern Night ceremony, the University
of Pittsburgh’s oldest tradition, was started by
Pitt's first dean of women, Thyrsa Wealhtheow
Amos, to welcome new students in a "sensible"
manner. Lantern Night was also created to
embrace the scholarship exemplified by the
senior queen. Even though distinguished
family and alumni now welcome new students
instead of the queen, the pride and accomp-
lishments she represented still live on.

No one at Lantern Night wears an
elaborate costume anymore, but the truths
and values behind the tradition remain solidly

University of Pittsburgh

Lantern Night in 1959.

in place. Freshman girls gather to light candles
and listen to words of wisdom from a disting-
uished speaker.

A Pitt alumna’s story and example
encourages students to pursue their studies
and dreams. Parents and grandparents who
are themselves Pitt alumnae light each girl’s
lantern and whisper hushed words of blessing.
As one Lantern Night draws to a close, there
is comfort in knowing that the lanterns will
once again light up the night with a new class
of freshman women.

The study abroad fair
and cultural exhibitions
are International

Week highlights.

The Eighth Wonder

nternational Week began as a one—day

International Fair on the Cathedral lawn

organized by the Office of International
Services and the Study Abroad Office to
celebrate and promote multiculturalism and
opportunities to study abroad. But the
University Center for International Studies
(UCIS) later decided to incorporate the fair
with International Day in September 1997,
and students now enjoy a week’s worth of
events that increase multicultural awareness
among the University population and
celebrate the accomplishments of both
the University and community in the
international arena.

According to UCIS Community Relations
Coordinator Elaine Linn, "International Week
has made a difference as students realize early
in the academic year that Pitt has a dynamic
international community and that the resources

for a top—notch international education are
available on campus. The number of student
groups——both international student groups
and student groups with a global focus—
hosting events during International Week has
skyrocketed."

Linn also noted that the demand for
foreign language classes, the number of
students studying abroad or participating in
Amizade Global Service—Learning Center trips,
and the number of students enrolled in the
UCIS certificate programs are all on the rise.

"We want all students to know that
multiculturalism is alive and well on the
Pitt campus."

hen Heinz Memorial Chapel was

dedicated in 1938, Howard Heinz

said, "If those who come under
the inﬂuence of this place go out to face life
with new courage and restored faith because
of the peace and calm and loveliness they
found here  this commemorative sanctuary
will not have been built in vain."

I first went inside the chapel as a freshman
for Lantern Night. The architecture of the
building was captivating, constructed in a
neo—Gothic style with beautiful stained glass
windows, stone, and woodwork that created

a breathtaking ambience. It was inspiring
to be in Heinz Chapel for my first ceremony
at Pitt.

Henry J. Heinz originally wanted a build-
ing on Pitt’s campus to honor his mother, and
he even made such provisions in his will. His
three surviving children carried out his wishes,
adding that the chapel was erected to also
honor their father. The chapel has been a true
gift to all who have found beauty, quiet, and
solitude within its walls.

Even now, when I walk by on a Saturday
afternoon and get a peek at a bridal party
—-—only Pitt alumni, faculty, and staff and
HJ. Heinz Co. employees and their direct
relatives can have ceremonies there—I feel
a special appreciation for the building and
the memories it has created for so many. This
feeling is even stronger when I hear the
harmonies of the Heinz Chapel Choir. If they
are not off traveling and sharing the gift of
song or recording their newest CD, it is a
treasure to hear them live at Heinz Chapel.

arks, museums, shops, and universities
are just some of what makes Oakland
beat as the cultural heart of Pittsburgh.

Oakland has a unique mix of businesses
that cater to the needs of students and provide
opportunities to sample interesting foods and
browse unique merchandise. A number of
coffee shops, restaurants, and boutiques
pepper Craig Street. Nearby are the Carnegie
Museum of Natural History, acclaimed for its
extensive dinosaur relics and sparkling gems,
and the Carnegie Museum of Art, which
houses an impressive collection of Impressionist,
American regional, and modern art.

Besides students, Oakland is also home
to families. In the world from across the

Pitt. The gardens full of flowers, vegetables,
and lawn decorations remind many of being

Bustling with activity all day, Oakland has
the right balance of city living and campus
community. People from around the region
take in what this area of Pittsburgh has to offer,
evidenced in part by the continuously filled
parking garages and lack of street parking.

There is much for students to be a part
of right outside the University in their
surrounding community. They just have to
remember to take advantage of it.

have decided to go to Pittsburgh!" That is

what I told family members years ago at

a dinner reception celebrating my gradua-
tion from high school. My uncle came to me
shortly after the announcement to ask me if
I was certain that the "Steel City" was the place
for me.

He asked, "What can they have there
that you can’t possibly find here closer to
your home?"

He must have never seen what I saw
when I first emerged from the Fort Pitt Tunnel
at night and saw the breathtaking stone, glass,
and steel architecture of downtown Pittsburgh.
The nation’s largest inland port had received
one more Visitor, one who was eager to
discover what treasures lay ahead.

Pittsburgh has gained worldwide recog-
nition for its advanced medical facilities, major
universities, and myriad cultural institutions.

 

Pittsburgh

As a student—not just of a University, but of a
great city filled with interesting people and
attractions—I did not expect my adjustment
to be difficult.

There really is something for everyone
in Pittsburgh. With the University’s diverse
population and the city’s eclectic neighborhoods,
there is a ﬂavor to satisfy the tastes of many.
The South Side offers theaters, galleries, and
funky boutiques, while the Strip District is
known for its wholesalers during the day and
its popular clubs at night. Squirrel Hill and
Shadyside offer cool coffeehouses for studying,
along with upscale shops and pizza parlors.
They provide a close respite from Oakland.
A short bus ride downtown makes accessible
a world-class symphony orchestra and ballet
company.

Yes, I’ve decided to go to Pittsburgh,
and I’m glad about it!

he college experience includes so

much more than attendance in classes.

In particular, it includes big changes
in our living environments. We leave the safe
circle of family living and enter a new world
of roommates, communal bathrooms, and
resident assistants. Familiarity is stripped away,
and we learn about ourselves as we learn
to live with others.

Regardless of whether you live in the
Schenley Quad, a few blocks away in Lothrop
Hall, in the architecturally renowned Litchfield
Towers, or up the hill at Sutherland, chances
are you learned something from living with
so many different people.

A letter from friends or
family can keep
homesickness at bay.

 

Freshman year, I lived with a girl who
held different religious beliefs than I held,
made my first friend of another race, and
learned that some people I thought I didn’t
like were actually pretty cool. Sheltered all
my life, I had never questioned my own
values and beliefs. Living with a more diverse
population gave me a greater sense of who
I am, while allowing me to accept others on
their own terms—a valuable life lesson.

But life in the dorms isn’t just an
educational eXperience—it’s also fun! Sure,
we come to college to learn, but we also
come to make new friends and memories.
Late night movie marathons, quick runs
to 7-11, and parties fostered a sense of
community that’s unique on every campus.
Through our dorms, we became comfortable
with one another and settled into a new way
of life. By year’s end, it was hard to imagine
feeling like a gawky freshman wishing for
home and old friends every day. Pitt had
become home.

sunny day means taking the books

the ﬂuorescent lights of the library. A snowy
day means bundling up and taking a break
to make snow angels and go sledding. What
campus grounds could possibly offer such
different opportunities for students all year
long? The Cathedral lawn.

The beauty of the lawn intensifies as the
leaves of its trees turn scarlet and gold.

Not only is it a great "chill spot" during
temperate weather, it is also a fitting place to
hold events such as the first memorial of the
9-11 tragedy, International Week, and several
intramural and informal sports.

If the Cathedral of Learning symbolizes
the intensity of a high quality education,
the lawn balances it with peaceful ambiance
and a place to play. Often taken for granted
as "that space around the Cathedral," the lawn
is that piece of green we want every college
campus to have.

John Woodruff arrived at Pitt to study sociology and was
largely inexperienced at running track. But he ended up
astonishing the track world when he finished second at the
national Association of American Universities (AAU) meet.

He then Went on to win three straight national collegiate titles
and was the American record holder for the 800-meter‘, with

a time of 1:48.6 in 1940. Before that feat, he was favored to
win Olympic gold in 1936 after his stellarperformance at
qualifying meets.

When Hitler hosted the 1936 Berlin Olympics to showcase
Aryan supremacy, he couldn’t have realized that the African
American Woodruff would reign supreme. At fnst, things
didn’t seem so promising for Woodruff as he began his
800-meter race. Facing the very real possibility of defeat,
Woodruff slowed down and started walking. And then he

» stopped moving altogether. Suddenly, he shifted to an outside

lane and, from last place, he sped past everyone to capture
the gold medal. .
Woodruffs courage in the face of obstacles remains a
testament to the persevering spirit that is characteristic of
many who have spent time at the University of Pittsburgh.

Scholarly System

efore there can be the papers, dissert-

ations, experiments, or presentations,

there are hours spent digging through
stacks of books at Pitt’s libraries. Pitt’s libraries
are the home to numerous journals, books,
magazines, microfilms, and periodicals. The
University Library System, in many Ways, is
as diverse and extensive as the student body
it serves.

Everyone knows Hillman Library. But
many might not know that it houses 1.5
million volumes, focusing primarily on the
humanities and social sciences. There are
times throughout the day when its more than
200 computers are filled and the library seems
to reach its study capacity of 1,500. Still,
students flock to "Club Hillman" on a regular
basis. Hard—Working learners can get a
caffeine buzz at the Cup & Chaucer cafe,
home to the Alldred Collection of titles in
contemporary fiction, travel, biographies,
and film studies, as well as current periodicals.
The first floor is home to the African
American Collection, the Buhl Social Work

University of Pittsburgh

Collection, and the Eduardo Lozano Latin
American Collection. Hillman also has more
than 250,000 volumes and 2,000 periodicals
in its East Asian Library.

As spectacular a library as Hillman is,
it takes an entire library system to satisfy the
needs of such a multidisciplinary campus.
Seventy thousand books and 650 journal
subscriptions greet more than 130,000 yearly
visitors to Langley Library, which focuses
primarily on biology, neuroscience, psychol-
ogy, and life sciences. Similarly, the Bevier
Engineering Library in Benedum Hall houses
about 65,000 books, 76,000 microforms, and
more than 1,000 journals.

No matter What the subject, Pitt’s libraries
have the resources students need.

pon entering the Commons Room
in the Cathedral of Learning, it
becomes clear that it is anything but
common. A popular gathering spot for students
since the Cathedral’s completion in 1956, the
Commons Room provides a reclusiveyet
communal atmosphere. Its neo-Gothic ornate
columns cross in graceful arches overhead.
The room hums with student activity, and
footsteps echo from the surrounding hallways.
Surrounding the Commons Room are
three distinctive galleries, the first of which is
the Nationality Rooms. These commemorative
classrooms are each decorated in the style of
one of 17 cultures. They bring far away
countries a little closer and honor the diversity
at the University of Pittsburgh. The other
galleries detail the history of Pittsburgh and
house memorials celebrating the city’s creators.

Commo

In this way, the Commons Room
intertwines the past and the present, and its
message is not lost on students. Reflecting
in a wooden chair, one can daydream about
past semesters at Pitt or about tomorrow and
what it might bring. It’s easy to get lost in
thoughts—until the realization hits that class
is about to begin. Then it’s off to one of the
42 stories in the Cathedral, the tallest school
building in the Western Hemisphere. Time in
the Commons Room, be it for a nap, a
conversation, studying, or just reading The
Pitt News, fosters a sense of community in a
unique and special atmosphere.

hether it is a challenge, adventure,

lifestyle change, or professional

leadership training, the Army ROTC
program at the University of Pittsburgh has it.
The Reserve Officer Training Corps, otherwise
known as ROTC is a great way to join the
ranks of the armed forces while receiving an
associate’s or bachelor’s degree and earning
scholarship money. Students looking to go
into this program can choose to join the Army,
Air Force, or Navy.

The Pittsburgh Panther ROTC Battalion

encourages a "lifestyle of fitness." For three
mornings per week, they are prepared at

6:30 a.m. for physical training. The physical
training sessions ensure that personnel main-
tain or better their fitness level after meeting
the Army Physical Fitness Standards. The fitness
doesn’t stop there. Seen walking around campus
in uniform with a distinct posture and stride,
there is a mental readiness and purpose in
their presence that exudes a sense of complete
wellness within those participating in the
ROTC program.

Being in ROTC is an experience of a life-
time. It is a fantastic way to develop skills that
are advantageous in the real world. Upon
commissioning, newly—deemed 2nd Lieutenants
will be put in charge of anywhere from
50-100 people of diverse ethnic, religious,
and cultural backgrounds. From cadet, Jessica
L. Knouse's perspective, ROTC is "not just a
course on military customs and courtesies,
history, and protocol." Instead, it is a course
designed to teach professionalism, confidence,
self—discipline, self-motivation, teamwork, time-
management, and leadership. All of these
qualities are necessary in becoming a successful
and effective officer.

he 26 Nationality Rooms on the first

three floors of the Cathedral of

Learning are famous for their elaborate
interior design and their embodiment of a
specific culture. These unique rooms encircle
the Commons Room and provide sanctuary
from the everyday classroom atmosphere.

Construction of the Nationality Rooms
began with the help of enthusiastic Pittsburgh
residents, Who personally funded their
completion. Local residents were eager to
memorialize the culture of their ancestors
for future generations. Sponsoring nations
and regions also provided architects, artists,
materials, and donations for the rooms.
Even during the Great Depression and World
War 11, construction of these rooms continued
—reflecting the participants’ dedication to
their goal in the midst of obstacles such as
harsh economic times and conﬂicting political
opinions.

From the ﬂoral designs found in the
Slovakian space to the hearth—based senti-
mentality of the Early American room,
each area provides a one-of-a—kind learning
experience and an appreciation for the diverse
cultures that make up Pittsburgh.

The African Heritage Room

The Swedish Room

The Nationality Rooms receive more than
50,000 visitors each year, and a number of
committees are planning the construction of
several more rooms. Most recently, the Indian
Classroom was dedicated in 2000, and a
Finnish room is being planned.

The Nationality Rooms program has also
made scholarships for study abroad available
to more than 700 Pitt students since 1948.
The everlasting legacy left by the hardworking
founders and laborers of these rooms is
reflected in the beauty and learning that
students continue to enjoy.

eing able to study abroad is one

of the many great opportunities the

University of Pittsburgh provides for
its students. Not only is there a Study Abroad
Office that helps students learn almost any-
where in the world, but the University Center
for International Studies (UCIS) also offers
financial assistance for international studies
and research.

Pitt student Emily Rogan took classes
at Sorbonne University and the American
University of Paris in France.

"Being able to familiarize myself with the
city and the people is one of the great accomp-
lishments that I made While I was there," she
says. Rogan chose to live with a host in Paris.
She referred to her host, an older Woman,
as Madame.

There are five types of programs available
to students Wanting to study abroad:
Pitt—developed programs, direct—exchange
programs, Pitt-affiliated programs, other
university programs, and direct enrollment.

Studying abroad isn’t only about having a
cultural experience. Students can apply certain
courses they take abroad to an international
certificate. There are also options to participate
in service-learning projects, Work, internships,
teaching positions, and volunteerism abroad.

When traveling abroad, Rogan advises,
"Keep an open mind and meet as many people
as possible and push yourself to experience
everything."

For students who Want a Worldview With-
out leaving the University, UCIS offers six
certificate programs in African, Asian, Latin
American, Russian and East European, West
European, and global studies that provide deep
insight and understanding of foreign cultures.

breathtaking attraction are the vaulted windows
that provide phenomenal views of Pitt’s campus,
Oakland, and beyond.

In the center of the area, there is a beau-
tifully crafted staircase spanning both floors
that has been constructed to harmonize with
the Cathedral’s gothic architecture. The
aesthetic appeal of UHC’s space mirrors the
way in which its students have made learning
and achieving an art form.

The addition of a cyber cafe allows students
to have food and beverages and use laptops
with the new wireless Internet network. From
the café’s stained glass window to the compass
design at the base of the staircase, the home
of UHC is a sight to behold.

Students are getting hands—on
experience in laboratory research.

Eureka!

“ You cannot teacb oz person anything,-
you can only belp tbemfmd it within
themselves.” ——Galileo

alileo was right. Finding answers to

life’s many questions isn’t always

easy, and it some—times it takes some
soul searching to find sought—after answers.
The Office of Experiential Learning (OEL) is a
service provided by the University of Pittsburgh
that helps undergraduates explore the many
mysteries of life that intrigue them. This
service helps students realize their goals
through hands—on experiences, and the office
encourages any avid learner to take what
they’ve been taught in class and apply it to
a "real—life" situation.

OEL offers opportunities for students
to receive academic credit for internships,
research, teaching, and service—learning
projects. Research can be conducted in a
number of different departments. It’s not just
about Bunsen burners and sulfuric acid anymore.

Pittsburgh

While the biology and chemistry departments
do offer research opportunities, positions are

also available in departments such as anthro-

pology, psychology, and geology. Students can
also find information on global service learning
and study abroad through OEL.

With the help and guidance of OEL,
Pitt students have been involved in research
ranging from genetic analysis to the study of
distant galaxies. All it takes is an inquiring
mind and a hard—working spirit—which are
easily found on Pitt’s campus. Experiential
learning can sometimes have even bigger
advantages than getting to work in a lab. Past
molecular biology student researcher Emily
Dornblaser says, "When I think that this research
may eventually benefit the lives of many
more people than I will ever hope to know,

I am grateful for the opportunity of being
a part of it."

in 105 Days

magine having the World as your class-

room, Fidel Castro as your professor, and

the impoverished children at Mother
Teresa’s orphanage as your classmates. Sound
impossible? Well, for some students, this dream
becomes a reality through the University’s
Semester at Sea (SAS) program.

I was aboard the spring 2003 Voyage of
Discovery, which was largely impacted by
the War on terror and the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus. We started
out as planned, and the first five ports of
call—Cuba, Brazil, South Africa, Tanzania,
and India——Were absolutely amazing. From
hearing the infamous, yet charming Castro
speak for four hours and visiting Nelson
Mandela’s former jail cell in South Africa to
comforting the children at Mother Teresa’s
orphanage, the experiences remain etched
in my mind.

Then, SARS hit.

 

The SS Universe Explorer takes students all over the world.

  

For approximately 12 days We were ﬂoating
aimlessly at sea. The acronym SAS no longer
stood for Semester at Sea, but our newly
dubbed "Sadly at Sea." Our dreams of crawling
thru the Chu—Chi Tunnels and shopping in
Vietnam were destroyed. Our visions of visiting
the Great Wall of China and roaming the streets
of Hong Kong quickly faded. With no nearby
port to dock, my fellow SAS—ers and I were
feeling discouraged about the outcome of
our voyage.

But We were not totally disappointed by
the eventual itinerary changes. Our ship, the
SS Universe Explorer, finally docked in the
back—up port of Nagasaki, Japan, and we
replaced the lost Pacific ports with stops in
Alaska and British Columbia. After 105 days,
We again touched U.S. soil. Despite SARS,
the voyage was worth every minute.

to name the University a Marshall Scholarship
Center of Excellence.

Marshall Scholars gathered for

 
 

tudents at the University of Pittsburgh

are given valuable opportunities to

further their academic and career goals
through incredible competitive scholarships.
For example, the nationally recognized Barry
M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in
Education Foundation holds an annual com-
petition during which the University’s Goldwater
Scholarship faculty representative seeks and
approves nominations of as many as four Pitt
students. This year, three Pitt students received
a Goldwater Scholarship, which awards funds
for specified use and encourages academic
and career success in the fields of mathematics,
natural sciences, and engineering.

One 2003-04 Goldwater Scholar, Paul
Ohodnicki—a dual major in engineering
physics and economics—is using the funds
provided by the foundation for research. He
is working to address methods of processing
materials that affect their magnetic properties.
On being a Goldwater Scholar, Ohodnicki says,
"I think it’s going to open a lot of doors for
me. It’s good to be nationally recognized 
in addition to what I have accomplished here."

esearch

One of his fellow 2003-04 Goldwater
recipients, Thanh Ha, expressed similar
thoughts: "It really gives me the opportunity to
stand out.  It shows that other people do
recognize you as having great potential in
fields of research."

A molecular biology and anthropology
major, Ha describes experimental science as
an intricate field wherein much time and effort
is required. She is confident in the value of
her research as a Goldwater Scholar.

"No matter what happens, it will be
beneficial."

History was made at the University of Pittsburgh on the first
day of the fall term in 1895. Chancellor William Jacob Holland
stood atop Observatory Hill in Allegheny City, now Pittsburgh’s
North Side, to personally welcome the first female students to
What was then called the Western University of Pennsylvania.
After completing a year of college Work at Pittsburgh’s .
Central High School, Margaret and Stella Stein came to Pitt

-as sophomores.

Becoming the first Women enrolled at the University Was
no easy feat. A student poll was taken to decide if theschool
should become co-educational, and the all-male campus
opposed the idea. Administration overruled the decision,
and the determined Stein sisters became a part of Pitt history.

They were an early part of Pitt’s tradition of excellence,
sharing the title of valedictorian at their 1898 graduation.

The sisters made history again when they returned for their
master’s degrees in 1901. c

May the victims of 9-11
be remembered
Pitt will never forget

Time to Remember

t has been more than two years since the

9-11 attacks, but the effects of that day

are still very present in the hearts and
lives of Americans. At Pitt, on September 11,
2003, the University community reflected on
that fateful day in 2001. A number of events
helped the community pay tribute to the men
and women who lost their lives.

For the week leading up to the memorial,
at touringexhibit came to the Conney M. Kimbo
Art Gallery in the William Pitt Union. It show-
cased quilts depicting scenes from the attacks,
ﬂags, and other abstract pieces.

Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg hosted
a morning memorial ceremony on the anniv-
ersary of the attacks. The American flag behind
the Cathedral of Learning was raised to half-
staff, and a wreath was dedicated to the victims
of 9-11. Throughout the day, a string quartet

played on the patio of the Cathedral, filling the
air with bittersweet sounds of remembrance.

There was also a showing of the HBO
film In Memomam, which features news reports
and home video footage taken during the
attacks on the World Trade Center.

The day ended with a candlelight vigil on
the Cathedral lawn. Nearly 150 people attend-
ed to pay tribute to the victims and to reﬂect
on the day and their memories. Spontaneous
singing of "America the Beautiful" and "God
Bless America" brought tears to several eyes.
The light from the candles and illumination
of Heinz Memorial Chapel behind the singers
was as beautiful as it was touching. It was
evident from Pitt’s campus that America will
never forget 9-11.

A Great Divide

 

ven though people I knew would

soon be sent off to Afghanistan and

Kuwait, it still had not sunk in that
American was at war. When demonstrations
began and the topics and tones of conversation
started to change, I worked hard to remain
immune to the fact that American was in fact
at war. I avoided the nightly news and the
morning headlines for about three weeks.
Just when I thought I had mastered numbness
to world events, the realization of war became
unavoidable during a busy noon lunch hour
in Schenley Cafe in the William Pitt Union.

I was seated at my assigned table provid-
ing information for the Freedom Mentoring
and Leadership Development Honor Society.
Across from me was a recruitment table for

 

University of Pittsburgh

the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC).
The usual lunchtime crowd of students
surrounded us. Everything was occurring as
usual until an antiwar student approached
the ROTC table. The officer stood to talk to
him, and the conversation soon became a
heated debate.

It was a picture for the papers. But there
is no recorded image because no one in the
crowd moved, especially not to photograph
the sight. It was if we thought that any move-
ment would exacerbate the argument. We all
just watched as their passions heightened;
they pointed their fingers, raised their voices,
and glared.

I can still see them. All of a sudden, I had
to face the war I had been ignoring. I could
not close my ears to the screaming or avert
my eyes from the scene. That was the day
I had to admit that I could not escape the
world around me. I could not run from it.
There was some comfort, however, in know-
ing that Pitt was helping to prepare me for it.

ootball and fireworks are only half of

the story. Homecoming is a time when

the University community comes
together to celebrate school spirit and pride.
It’s just one of many University events that
make Pitt such a phenomenal place to be.

During this fun—filled time, students take
boat rides on the Gateway Clipper Fleet, enjoy
musical entertainment, and marvel at fireworks
in the night sky over the Cathedral. But these
are only a few of the festivities at the
University of Pittsburgh’s annual homecoming.
In the past, students, faculty, parents,

friends, and alumni have come together along
Bigelow Boulevard to enjoy a laser show
choreographed to music. The show featured
an explosion of color and light beams that
illuminated the sky. In addition, the home-
coming extravaganza included tarot card

readings, balloon art, handwriting analyses,
and airbrushed body art. These events turned
into a family affair, as Homecoming 2003
coincided with Freshmen Family Weekend.

Of course, it wouldn’t be right to leave
out the big game. All the homecoming
events, programs, and parties led to just one
thing——the showdown at Heinz Field. As the
Panthers trampled the Orangemen of Syracuse
University for a 34-14 win, homecoming
weekend excitement reached its peak.

For students and alumni alike, home-
coming is a weekend to look forward
to and to celebrate Panther pride.

rom your first gaze up at

the Cathedral of Learning

and the spring afternoons
you spent on its lawns to late-night
fries at "The O" and cramming for
finals until dawn, lots of memories
are made at the University of
Pittsburgh. Larry Fitgerald's amaz-
ing touchdowns made you cheer.
A teacher inspired you to achieve,
Prince Andrew's visit made you
proud, and good friends made
you smile.

Think of all you have learned
at Pitt, not just coursework and
classes, but life lessons as well.
Maybe you've grown more aware
by being exposed to a city full
of cultural amenities, perhaps
taking in the first ballet or opera
of your life. Maybe you are
more appreciative of different
cultures from looking at African
art or taking your first bite of
Vietnamese cuisine. Perhaps the
"real world" no longer seemed so
far away because of your first
part—time job or internship. These
kinds of experiences, coupled
with a first—class education will
send you out of the University's
fold a very different person than
you were when you arrived.

Pitt has prepared you well,
and while you proudly go forth
to conquer the world with your
degree, remember that the things
you learned and the memories
you made both on campus and
beyond will never leave you.
This book will always be there
to remind you of both where
you were and just how far you
have come.

Let It Snow

rom the White House to the Cathedral

of Learning, the 2005 winter brought

the east coast one of its worst blizzards
in more than a decade. In several surrounding
areas such as Maryland and West Virginia,
governors declared states of emergency as
sleet, snow, and torrential winds ravaged every
municipality the storm touched. When it was
all over, 13 inches of snow had piled on top
of Oakland by Monday, February 17, 2003-
the day the University nearly shut down.

The snow started falling on Sunday after-
noon. It did not stop a protest about the war
in Iraq, which still took place as planned.
Demonstrators and students dressed in heavy

winter coats, long woolen scarves, and toasty
mittens for the extreme winds and frigid
temperatures. The snow became an almost
knee—deep sea of white in just a few hours.
Early the next morning, anxious Pitt

students tuned in to local news stations and
waited with baited breath as school cancell-
ations were announced. Not only were Pitt
classes cancelled, but a state of emergency was
also declared for Pennsylvania. The cancella-
tion was an unexpected delight to most Pitt
students. A surprise long weekend to study,
hang out, and catch up on sleep was a
welcome treat. Despite the extreme conditions,
Pitt students were sledding down snow banks,
making snow angels, and having intense snow-
ball fights. The snow, and the fun it brought,
was enthusiastically embraced.

Time to Travel

s the cold weather settles in at Pitt,
most students have one thing on their
minds: spring break! Some see it as a
chance to earn some extra dollars by working
extra hours. Others just want to sit at home
and enjoy the feeling of having nothing due
the next day. There are a few who take the
time away from class to study independently
before the onset of midterms and finals. But
it seems that most students look forward to
spending the week soaking up the sun on
a beach with a friend——MTV style.
But when students see the price tag of
a trip to Cancun, they often ditch their hopes
of fun in the sun. Luckily for Pitt students,

Aaah...seven days _, _
of heaven.

 

aspirations of having the ultimate spring break
experience can be fulfilled, even for those
with limited budgets.

Last year, my friends and I secured spots
on the Pitt Program Council’s trip to Panama
City, F1a.—a siX—night, seVen—day stay at one
of the best hotels in the country. Every day
there was something to do: hang out by the
pool, listen to bands play on the pool deck,
go sightseeing. Panama City nightlife was
also amazing. Going on that trip was the best
decision I could have made. I swam, I danced,
I partied, and I lived out my spring break
dreams.

Every student deserves a break from
the routine of classes, clubs, and work—and
Pitt makes it all easy on the wallet. After all,
we are only young once!

Famous for his dancing, acting, and singing," one would
expect that Pitt alumnus Gene Kelly’s college education would
have reﬂected those interests. In fact, Kelly received his
undergraduate degree in economics ‘in 1933. He returned
to the University to pursue a postbaccalaureate degree from
the School of Law.
Despite his academic pursuits, dancing was Kelly’s passion.
He opened Pittsburgh’s Gene Kelly Studio of Dance in 1932
and then another studio in Johnstown, Pa. After ﬁnishing
his education at Pitt, Broadway beckoned, and Kelly took off
to find the footlights of New York City. He went on to find
fame in the movies, most notably for Singin’ in the Rain and
An American in Paris. ’
This Oscar winner also invented the "Ubangi," a mechanism
that attaches to a camera allowing for low-angle shots. Kelly
was originally told that such an angle could not be achieved
with a regular Technicolor camera. '

time making a difference in the
community. For example, the students who
participated in the America Reads Tutoring
Program spent their free time tutoring children
to improve their reading ability, which Will

or have volunteered at one of more than
180 community agencies.

When most students think of spring break,
they think of sandy beaches, warm sun, and
tanned skin. ‘SVO volunteers often take a
different path—they give up their vacation
time to do good for others. Through SVO’s

 

Alternative Spring Break program, instead of
spending their vacation partying on the beach,
students traveled to Arizona to tutor Navajo
children, to Kentucky to help the Hazard—Perry

HIV/AIDS. Still others Went to Louisiana, but

SVO members work to advance our local

on a three—fold mission of education, research,
and service—ideals that are exemplified in its
student volunteers.

w A BAS event in 1971.

ounded in 1968, the Black Action

Society (BAS) has been impacting the

University of Pittsburgh for decades.
This impact started almost immediately.
On May 19, 1968, BAS presented the University
with a list of demands that addressed issues
facing the Black student community. After
Waiting a year Without a satisfactory response
to those demands, BAS again took action.

On January 15, 1969, Dr. Martin Luther
King ]r.’s birthday, members of BAS took
over the Cathedral of Learning’s computer
center—the only computer facility on the entire
campus at that time. After a seven-hour lock-
in, then Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar finally
agreed to their demands.

Today, BAS continues its efforts to promote
the cultural, educational, political, and social
needs of students. To that end, the Black
Action Society sponsors social activities and
study sessions and brings speakers—such as
rapper Chuck D and director Hype Williams——
to campus in an effort to unite Black students.
Members extend the organization’s inﬂuence
off campus by going into Pittsburgh’s Black
community and hosting events with local
high schools.

Michelle Agostini, a BAS member, welcomes
students to their lndaba event.

here is always a hum of activity on

the fourth floor of the William Pitt

Union. At any given moment on that
floor one may encounter an aspiring radio
D], a determined journalist, or a creative
television producer.

The newest addition to the floor is The
Creation Station. This student group takes
over where classroom learning leaves off,
giving students who are interested in media-
related fields—particularly television—a
chance to get their feet wet and put the skills
that they have only read about to good use.

Aspiring writers may find sanctuary at
The Pitt News, and those who want a copy of
the student newspaper have two ways to get
it—in print and electronically. The online
version not only offers the day's top stories, but
also allows readers to participate in online polls
and comment directly to an article's author.

 

 

Pitt’s radio station, WPTS 92.1—FM, brings
the latest progressive and alternative (i.e.,
non-Top 40) artists to the student body. It also
broadcasts Panther football and basketball
games. The station is run entirely by a staff
whose average age is 20. Allison Rowland,

"a close—knit group of friends working together
to advance their knowledge of an exciting
industry."

Finally, there is the little office that houses
this publication, the Panther Prints Memory
Book. While the other three organizations
are in charge of keeping students in the know
on a daily basis, Panther Prints’ duty is to
remind students of the entire time they’ve
spent at the University.

he Pitt Program Council (PPC) is Pitt’s

number one place for student fun.

Located in the William Pitt Union, PPC
is run mainly by students who know how to
have a good time and want to make sure every-
one else does, too.

There are eight directors in charge of PPC’s
diverse events. The art director brings exhibits
to the William Pitt Union’s Conney M. Kimbo
Gallery, while the film director brings the latest
movies to the union. The travel director plans
all of the events off campus, from spring
break vacations to cultural trips to New York
and Canada. Other directors bring headlining

bands and lecturers to Pitt, and the leisure-
learning director is in charge of special
programs such as beer and wine tasting sem-
inars and exercise classes.

The Pitt Program Council is able and will-
ing to do just about anything to enhance the
quality of student life on campus. It is through
the council’s work that students can take a
walk through the art gallery to view a new
exhibit or get their hair and nails done for
free when the leisure—learning director hosts
"Day at the Spa."

Students can also see recent movies in
the union for only $2. Going to lectures
and Kennywood Park are also offered at
a discounted rate.

Sponsoring traditional events such as Fall
Fest, Bigelow Bash, and the Gateway Clipper
Fleet Boat Ride for Homecoming, PPC is an
integral part of the programming on Pitt’s campus.

t’s 9 p.m. on September 23, 2005—other—

wise known as bid night. In one minute,

more than 150 girls, mostly freshmen and
sophomores, will run out of the William Pitt
Union to join the house from which they have
just accepted a bid. The members of Pitt’s 11
sororities anxiously await their new members,
who arrive singing cheers. The women wel-
come their new sisters and hurry back to their
suite, eager to celebrate their growing group.

The fraternities’ recruitment process ends
with the same kind of celebration.

"It’s about finding where you fit in," says
Elizabeth Bierma, the recruitment chair for
Alpha Epsilon Phi.

Despite the fever of bid night and fraternity
bashes. Greek life is not just one big celeb-
ration. Every house participates in community
service activities, raises money for a house
philanthropy, and organizes a campus-wide
blood drive. The brothers of Pi Kappa Alpha
have even adopted a section of highway
376 East to help keep Pittsburgh clean.
Several other fraternities and sororities have
adopted streets a little closer to home in
Oakland, where they have monthly clean—up
outings.

Your Fit

The sisters of Alpha Epsilon Phi make trips
to an animal shelter to walk the homeless dogs
and cuddle with the lonely cats. The annual
DZ Dunk, sponsored by the sisters of Delta
Zeta, benefits the House Ear Institute in Los
Angeles, Calif. Delta Tau Delta participates in
a 24-hour fast to benefit the Greater Pittsburgh
Community Food Bank.

As Daniel Zapp of Delta Tau Delta puts it,
"Our mission is to teach, to help, and to in-
spire others to lead lives of excellence."

he Student Government Board (SGB)

of the University of Pittsburgh strives

to represent the needs of the University's
undergraduate population. Even with a campus
as large as Pitt's, SGB makes sure that no stu-
dent is without a voice. While it may sound
like a task of mythic proportions, SGB accom-
plishes this through the use of committees.
The Freshman Affairs Committee addresses the
needs of the newest undergrad group, while
the Community Relations Committee brings the
University community together with various

local businesses and residents through comm-
unity service events and projects. SGB and its
committees provide a way to meet students’

academic, socioeconomic, and personal needs.

But can they do it all in one semester?

In a change of policy, those who were
elected to SGB in April 2003 served a single-
semester term (April to December) rather than
the usual yearlong term from April to April.
This will allow for a president and his/ her
board to take office in January and get at least
four months of work accomplished before the
summer break, rather than being elected and
breaking for the summer just one month later.

"It's been a weird semester, but we knew
it was going to be that way from the beginn-
ing," said Brian Kelly, SGB’s business manager
and newly elected president. Even though
time was a major factor that semester, Kelly
said the board was able to accomplish a lot.
The student body is excited to see what the
next board has to offer.

Housed in Alumni Hall in the Office of

Every Monday through Thursday evening,

Tony Drew Dorsett turned down 67 other colleges when

he made the decision to attend the University of Pittsburgh
and play Panther football. As a freshman, he set running
records against Northwestern University and the University
of Notre Dame, finished the season ranked second nationally,
and became the first freshman in 29 years to be named
All-American.

0 When Dorsett was a senior, Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
said that the 1976 football season could very well produce
"our first undefeated season in years. a fair shot at the
national championship, a major bowl bid, a Heisman Trophy
winner, and if you want to dream, maybe all three."

_ Dorsett would play a major role in seeing these dreams
come to fruition. He and the ’76 Panthers beat Pennsylvania
State University, and Dorsett became the first college back to
surpass 6,000 rushing yards. Four days later, he won the
Heisman Trophy. Undefeated so far that year, the Panthers
beat Georgia at the Sugar Bowl.

Three out of three—a pretty good dream after all.

The remarkable run. Touchdown!
Strike up the band!

It all happens so fast that you often find
yourself looking at the big screen for the
instant replay because you can’t believe that
wide receiver and Heisman Trophy
runner-up Larry Fitzgerald and quarterback
Rod Rutherford have such an amazing
connection on the field. You have to see it
again while David Abdul prepares to make
the field goal attempt.

The fast—paced excitement of Pitt football
games culminated in a stellar 2002 season
and ended with an Insight Bowl victory over
Oregon State. The team that asked us to
believe has made believers out of all of us.
We watched Claude Harriot and the defense
stop the opposition, we anticipated Brandon
Miree’s incredible runs, and we hoped for
a Bowl game, too.

We’ve seen this team beat the odds and
win, and we celebrated with them. We also
saw these young men poised and resilient,
and we waited for a resurgence of energy
after any disappointment. After this season’s
loss to Toledo, who wasn’t waiting for the
big win over Texas A&M? Who didn’t expect
to leave victorious after the homecoming
game against Syracuse? True Panther fans
know the real reason the Miami game sold
out before the season even started—because
Pitt has all the resources it needs to play
and win—even if they don’t.

As examples of dedication, diligence, drive,
and determination, the Panther football team
is a true force on the field.

preceded the season that everyone
was waiting for—men’s basketball.

Why did people crave a ticket? Because
fans were riding high after a triumphant
2002-05 season, defeating teams such as
Georgetown University, Rutgers University,
and Syracuse University. The Panthers took
home their first Big East Championship in
a victory against the University of Connecticut
Huskies. Then, a few weeks later, they
made it to the Sweet Sixteen of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
Championship before a heartbreaking fall
to Marquette University.

This record meant that the Panthers
entered the 2005-04 season facing pretty high
expectations. With the return of jaron Brown,
Chevon Troutman, Carl Krauser, and Julius
Page, Panther fans looked toward November
14 and expected to see more great Pitt
basketball.

The new season brought some new faces
to the team, most notably in Head Coach
Jamie Dixon, but also with Guard Keith
Benjamin and Swing Player John DeGrote.

All brought renewed hope in another
championship Panther season, but fans knew
that it would be a tough one with one of

the most difficult schedules in the Big East,
starting with the season opener against the
University of Alabama in New York’s Madison
Square Garden. That would be one of

a record—setting eight nationally broadcast
games.

Still, fans were busy trying to get a seat.
They knew the Panthers could be their ticket
to the national championship, and of course,
they wanted to be there cheering them on.

historic landmark and a symbol

of the pioneering spirit of Pittsburgh,

the Cathedral of Learning has served
as a source of inspiration for nearly 70 years.
Forty—two stories high and 535 feet tall, the
Cathedral is the second—tallest educational
building in the world and towers over the
University with its distinct and dominating
stature. Its architecture is reminiscent of a
12th-century Gothic cathedral, with expansive
ribbed vaulting in the Commons Room,
2,529 windows, and elaborately decorated
structures and moldings adorning exterior
and interior portions alike. The levels of the
progressively truncated tower symbolize the
spirit and achievement of Pittsburgh and the
unending process of learning.

Construction of the Cathedral
of Learning began in 1926 under
Chancellor John Bowman.

Pittsburgh

Construction of the Cathedral began with
the help of charitable donations from men,
women, and, interestingly, 97,000 local
children who each contributed one dime
toward the foundation bricks for the magnificent
structure. Originally constructed to accommodate
the growing number of students enrolled at
the University, the edifice still serves as a place
where students come to learn and study.

In addition to the Cathedral’s striking
architecture, the 26 Nationality Rooms that line
its first three ﬂoors and border the Commons
Room are other features unique to the Cathedral
and its rich history. These defining character-
istics help set the Cathedral of Learning apart
from other educational structures and maintain
the spirit and optimism of those who aided in
its construction. Soaring to the endless possibil-
ities of achievement, it is far more than just
a landmark of Pitt’s campus———it is a symbol
of the traditions of the University.

Pittsburgh, and while several students

were seeking the refuge of a warm spot
to cram before a test or to catch up on some
reading, there was another devoted crowd
gathering at the Fitzgerald Field House.

he men’s and women’s swimming and
diving teams have their hearts set on
winning the national title, and Head
Coach Chuck Knoles thinks that 2005-04 could
be the year the Panthers win it all.
"I feel we have all the right pieces to win
it -all this year," he said.
The team has won seven consecutive
Big East men’s swimming and diving titles, and
the women’s team has broken and held onto
numerous University records. If the Panthers
win the national title, it will be on the backs
of their two All-Americans, Eric Limkemann
and Carolyne Savini, who were named the
team’s Most Valuable Swimmers last year.

 

"We are coming into this season with one
thing on our [minds]: winning the national
title," said Limkemann.

Limkemann won two individual Big East
titles, claiming first place in the 500 and 1650
freestyle races. He also helped the 800 free-
style relay team win All—Big East honors and
placed fifth in the 400 individual medley (IM).
Moreover, Limkemann broke his own school
record in the 500 freestyle at the Big East
Championships.

Savini earned five All-Big East honors with
second-place finishes in the 200 IM and 100
and 200 backstrokes. She helped the medley
relay teams to second— and third—place ﬁnishes.
She broke an unprecedented nine school records
in 2005, including six individual and three
relay marks. Savini also participated in her
first National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) Championships.

The swimming and diving team at the
University of Pittsburgh has shown over
the years that they are truly one of the best.
