The University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg
continues to fulfill its mission set forth fifteen
years ago — extending the resources of a major
university to the residents of Central West-
moreland County.

In response to community needs, UPG offers
four-year majors in business administration,
administration of justice. and two areas of
concentration. Last fall, new majors in English
literature, political science, and psychology
were added to the curriculum. Thus, while many
students continue to relocate to the Pittsburgh
or Johnstown campus after completing pre-
liminary courses in Greensburg, increasing
numbers of students are selecting majors in
which all of the coursework is available on the
Greensburg Campus. All of the four—year pro-
grams, however, are approved by and the
degrees granted through the School of General
Studies in Pittsburgh.

UPG's completely centralized campus now
includes a science building, student activity
center, a combined classroom-library building,
a business office and bookstore complex, and
the original mansion which houses classrooms
and faculty and administrative offices. These
expanded facilities, especially the science build-
ing with its spacious lounge and auditorium,
have permitted the campus to host a variety of
area groups and organizations.

While specifically attuned to the needs of our
immediate area, UPG enjoys strong ties to the
Pittsburgh campus. They include the computer
linkage to Pittsburgh facilities, which provides
the students with direct access to a major
technological resource; it also symbolizes the
interconnecting system of Pitt campuses which
together, serve the needs of Western’ Pennsyl-
vama.

The University of Pittsburgh at Titusville, located
at the former McKinney Estate, is an atmosphere of
personalized instruction in a wooded, residential
setting. McKinney Hall houses classrooms, admin-
istrative offices and the campus bookstore. The
Bennett Davis Memorial Laboratory provides facilities
for both biology and chemistry.

A student center offers a homey atmosphere for
television and record playing. There is also a snack
bar, pool and tennis tables.

Outside of the campus, students may enjoy the

recreational and entertainment advantages of the
surrounding community such as four parks, two golf
courses, ski slopes, a hunting and fishing preserve
and lakes for boating and swimming. There is also
a wide range of urban cultural pursuits sponsored by
the Titusville Council of Arts, such as film, drama
and dance.

This kind of small college familiarity and personalized
environment blends well with the larger university
aspects of Pitt's Titusville campus.

"What Else Is New in Bradford?" At UPB new
is not novel. it is the usual. New is a common
facilities building with 35,000 square feet on two
floors. illustrated right. Anticipated comple-
tion date for the new building is the fall of
I979. It will house the campus store. a student
cafeteria. a separate snack bar and lunch room,
and a faculty dining area. It will include as well
the student organizations and clubs. offices' for
the student affairs staff, a career counseling
and study center, and a health care center. in
addition to a lounge area. a game room. and a
music and art center.

New too is an athletic field large enough to
accommodate a full-size basketball field. two
softball diamonds, four tennis courts, two out-

door handball courts, and a football/soccer field.
Well into its second decade. UPB has become
established as an educational center within the
University of Pittsburgh and within the Common-
wealth system of higher education. This unique
relationship provides UPB students with the com-
bined advantages of a small college and a major

state—re|ated university.
At UPB there are lﬂ full and part—tiine stu-
dents enrolled in all programs. More than 400
full—time students live on campus in apartment
styled residences. We think that IOOO students
strike a good balance between being small
enough to assure individual attention and recog-
nition. yet being large enough to provide a
healthy diversity of relationships and a stimu-
lating academic environment.

At UPB there are eight baccalaureate pro-

grams leading to the BA. or B.S. degree in

areas of concentration allowing broad educa-

tional exploration.

In many programs. intern training is provided

so that following graduation students may em-
bark immediately upon a career in which they have

had field work.

In all programs a broad background in the

arts and sciences is required thus enabling stu-
dents to pursue further study in graduate or
professional school. Professional counseling is
provided so that students may carefully con-

sider their options.

UPB students share in all of the resources of
one of America's outstanding universities . . .

ristitute

  

By Mary Sisak, Suzanne Vlanich and Pam Holtzapple

I'm here. I can't believe it. Here at last in Oakland at
the University of Pittsburgh—playground of the stars.
In a few short minutes my tour will begin and my dreams
will become reality as the Campus bus takes me to
the places where the stars live, work, and play.

The first stop on my tour is the residence halls.
It's bright and early in the morning as thousands of
bit part actors hurry off to their sets with their
scripts in hand. Biology, Chemistry, Political Science.
Psychology, History, Math- scripts full of the most
exciting dialogue imaginable.

Amidst the hustle and bustle, I descend from the
bus to take a closer look at where the stars live. I tour
all the majestic estates—McCormick, Brackenridge.
Amos. Holland Hall and finally the Towers with their
exclusive penthouse rooms.

I roam the halls hoping to catch a glimpse of my
favorite star. In the room to the left, I find My
Favorite Martian in his perpetual sky—high condition.
His roommate. sleeper, begs for five more minutes . ..
of sleep. Further down the hall The Incredible Hulk
practices ripping off doors for his next film "Don't
Let Crime Carry You Away." At the final stop of my
residence tour. the Tower A Hot Pot Gourmet
prepares for the days shooting of "How to Make Roast
Beef au Jus in a Hot Pot." After this thrilling deinon—
stration, I board the bus to continue the tour and
anxiously wait to see where the stars work.

First stop— Hillman Library. Stars shine at Hillman
any time of the day or night. Short, tall; fat. thin!
American, foreign; athlete. sports fan; everyone ends
up at Hillman sometime. However. some stars overdo
the Hillman routine and are here so often that they
have their own private study cubic|e—adorned with
their favorite telephone numbers. obscenities, and

, anything else that inspires them.

Next. the bus moves toward the Cathedral of
Learning. the most renowned studio set at Pitt. The
bus stops here for a I5 minute picture break. I race
into the building with camera in hand, with a flurry
of clicks and flashes I capture many memories of the
stars. Hundred",., of them are here sleeping. eating,
studying. socializing. playing cards. and waiting for
their next rehersal of the stars next hit series
Commuters I978. My I5 minutes pass quickly and
I head outside to reboard the bus. While exiting I
stumble onto the set of Beach Party. The whole cast
is there from frisbee throwers to sun bathers. It all
seems so real that I seem to hear the crash of the
ocean waves. but I'm jarred back to reality as the bus
driver honks the horn signaling it's time to continue
the tour. I board the bus and it embarks on the last
leg of the tour— where the star plays.

Some stars play up at the Colosseum where brute force
is the Name of the Game. Weekly. thousands of
spectators gather to watch the Panthers maul their
defenseless opponent. Each star has his own way of
celebrating the week's victory. Some scope out the
Greek action found on Fraternity Row. Others spend
quiet evenings at their friends homes—Ze|da's. Danny's
Peter's. Uncle Roy’s. and Macs.

My tour comes to its end and I reflect on my Close
Encounters with the Stars. I realize that even though
their lives are glamorous, they are just everyday
people much like you and me.

Before I depart I take one last look at star land.
"Who's that I see peering from the Cathedral?!" It's
Uncle Wes—director of all this.

This year's
Homecoming Week

featured something new

— a Homecoming King.

Never before at Pitt have the

male undergraduates had a

chance to run for such a position.
And the idea caught on. Several
canidates, sponsored by many organi-
zations ran, but all lost to Frank Wiener, the
engineering canidate. Wiener felt that no
elements of a beauty contest exist in the
competition. "I really don't think students view a
king in the same way they view a queen." His queen
was Donna Farey (second frame)."

EATING...

 

   

Eat. eat, eat . . . that is what Mike
Kattern, from the commuter division
(pictured left) did to win the three
minute eat-a|l-the—hamburgers-you-
can contest.

The Eating Contest consisted of
three divisions; one for commuters,
one for RSA and one for the Greeks.
Each person in his/her division ate
as many hamburgers as they could in
three minutes, with the winners from
each division participating in the two
minute Big Eat Off.

 

      

The Greeks division was
handled a little differently, with
the contestants being blind-
folded. The winner in this divi-
sion was Steve Kalik (pictured
left), a sophomore and a member
of the ZBT fraternity. When
asked how he prepared for such a
contest. Steve replied, "It's due
to absolute training at Pitt. The
food at the cafeteria builds your
stomach up."

In the BIG EAT OFF, the
winners of each division were
also blindfolded. As if that was
not enough. the contestants had
to sit on their hands and were
fed by the judges.

The overall winner was Mike
Kattern, a senior from Commuter
divison. Mike won a dinner for
two at C.J. Barney's, and the
division winners won five
sandwiches from Roy Rodgers.

UCTUBERFEST      

The atmosphere of Oktoberfest, with dancing,
drinking and dining replaced the screaming and
shouting atmosphere of a beer festival in the Student
Union ballroom.

Low lights Bavarian music, the aroma of knockwurst
and saurkraut and bright German ornaments strung
from chandelier to chandelier transformed the ball-
room into a genuine German atmosphere.

This year's Oktoberfest was designed to replace
last year's catastrophic beer festival, according to
Homecoming Committee co-chairmen Max Lash and
Marsha Blythe.

The event began at ll a.m. and ran until midnight.

  

During the afternoon, two sessions were held for stu- COST-

llllllliﬂllll

By Maggie McKay

A siren cuts the early morning stillness. an ambulance
rushes through the sleepy Oakland streets. It's 6 a.m., the
beginning of an ordinary day. The air is crisp and clean.
still easy to breathe. A few people stir restlessly in their
beds, check alarm clock, groan softly and roll over for
another hour or two of sleep. The silver PAT buses
rumble slowly down Fifth Avenue, the few passengers
within them stare out the grimy windows at the empty
sidewalks. 7 a.m.; traffic jams the intersections. The
city is awake, but just barely. The streetlights flash —
red, yellow, green —— cars race past them. Yellow lights
flash — damn. Drivers curse and speed through them.
trying to beat the red light. Have to get downtown early
or they'll never find parking places. A lone pedestrian
dodges between PAT buses and sport cars, to sleepy to
worry about being run over. 730 a.m.-, joggers hit the
Oakland pavements on their way to Schenley Park of the
Fitzgerald Field House. They are obscenely alert. Crazy
people. The early morning commuters standing wearily
at bus stops look at the runners with dull amazement. A
person must be crazy to exercise so early in the morning.

8 a.m.; sunlight threatens to break through the cloudy
skies. Students straggle out of their apartments and
dorm rooms, books under their arms. Its along one block
walk to the Cathedral of Learning for classes. They shake
their heads. Classes before IO a.m. should be outlawed.
Students jam the streets not bothering to check out the
traffic before they cross. Most drivers are Oakland
veterans and patiently bide their time, motors idling.
Other drivers irascibly honk horns and shout out their
windows. Students ignore them. They're late for class.

By midmorning the Oakland area is crowded. Students
in jeans rush past Oakland residents — the elderly
people sweeping the sidewalks in front of their apart-
ments. men on the corner selling newspapers or unloading
truck, and the "bag ladies" the little old women who
seem eternally rooted to the corners of Forbes clutch-
ing heavy battered brown bags with plastic handles.

Lunchtime: The student has some time to kill. The
Student Union rec room has stopped serving its donuts
and coffee. Burger Chef is too crowded. It's either eat
in the cafeteria or head to one of the many fast food
shops down the street. . . . walking down the street, he
stops to talk to a friend. Time passes. lt's only a half
hour till the next class. Should he bother with lunch or
just skip class? Seated at the Pancake Kitchen or Gustines,
he surveys the menue. . . . At 2 p.m. he steps out into the
glaring Oakland sunlight. lt hadn't seemed so sunny
earlier. He blinks rapidly and shifts his books from one
arm to the other while stepping over the inevitable
puddle or pile of trash on the sidewalk.

Where to now? The student heads toward Hillman
Library to do some reserve room reading. What a pain
in the neck . . . By 4 p.m., he's going crazy. By 4:lO, he's
back out on the streets. Maybe he'll head toward the
Student Union to meet friends. or better yet, back to the
dorms for a nap. Rush hour traffic clogs up the streets
again. The same motorists rush back from downtown.
The traffic lights flash — red, yellow, green — Drivers
smile and hum songs along with the radio. The day's over.
They're going home . . .

In a few hours the streets darken, but the flow of
pedestrian traffic doesn't slow down. It's time for Happy
Hour in the local bars. For some Happy Hour lasts until
2 a.m., but even when the bars close, the streets don't
empty. Don't some people ever sleep? Lights are still
burning in dormitory rooms as students struggle to
finish reading that last chapter in Political Science or
Economics . . . By 4 a.m., most of the lights are doused and
the streets settle down to a relative quiet . . . But all too
soon, it's 6 a.m. . . sirens scream, buses roll, students
groan, It's a brand new day in Oakland.

STATE APPROPRIATIONS

By Mark Murphy

The problem that would become the most serious crisis Pitt has
faced since it became a state—re|ated university began in March
I977 and did not end until Christmas of this year. During those
months, jobs were threatened, programs seemed doomed, arms
were twisted in the name of higher education and. the University
claimed. hundreds of thousands of dollars were irretrievably lost.

The crisis came to be known as the Appropriations Fight. and
it was. without doubt. the biggest story of l977—78.

In March I977. Chancellor Posvar traveled to Harrisburg to
plead Pitt's case before a House budget committee. The mission
was in vain, and. when all was said and done. Pitt was slated
to receive not the nearly $69 million originally requested. but
only 6l.7 million dollars.

But when the Legislature had to approve the budget in early
summer, it could not generate enough revenue to cover expend-
itures. A compromise was neccessary. and. after about six weeks
of legislative squabblings and public outcry. a budget was approved
that excluded funds for state—re|ated colleges.

The exclusion of funds for Pitt. Penn State. Temple and
Lincoln was to be temporary. and the logic behind the move
was. in the minds of some, sound. The state was about $300 million
short and. since the colleges would not need the money until
they opened in September. that money could be deferred. and
the rest of the budget passed. In September. the Legislature
addressed itself to the problem of how it would raise the $300
million neccessary for the colleges. The answer would come nearly
four months later.

The situation was not critical in September. The tuition money
paid by the students covered most of the University's expenses
for the month. But everyone knew that source of money would

quickly run dry. and the serious problems would begin. Pitt
continued its lobbying efforts in Harrisburg. students from the
Universities formed groups. and the rhetoric from both sides did
little but increase the tempature of the surrounding atmosphere.

"Pitt. and all of Pennsylvania's higher education institutions are

being held hostage, and the ramsom is $300 million, or a way to
raise it," college supporters said. Legislators agreed higher
education is a must. but where was that $300 million to come from?
It was unlikley existing programs could be cut very much, and
they were close to an election and tax increases were about as
popular as tuition increases. It was eyeball to eyeball. and both
sides were catatonic.

For a while, in late September and early October. little happened.
In the first week of October the inevitable occured, and Pitt
began to borrow. Before the month was out, banks would lend
the University about $9 million. and administrators claimed Pitt
was losing thousands of dollars daily.

Both chamber of the Legislature approved Pitt's appropriations
early in the crisis. an action that meant little and was worth
even less. All it showed was the legislators’ willingness to give Pitt
its money — if it had the money to give. To avoid any
confusion. Posvar. who had been using a "|ets—be—quiet- in
public-and—not-upset—them—any—more" strategy. issued a statement
reminding those affected that the problem still existed.

The pressure on the Legislature to vote for a tax increase rose
every day the problem remained unsolved. Then. on Oct. 27
the Senate reconsidered its appropriation vote — a move designed
to allow greater control over the money disbursed. Some University
observers believed the move signaled an appropriations cut was
forthcoming. But the cuts would not come just yet, there was still
no money and the debts became greater.

In early November. both the administration and the students

 

played a trump card. A "Statement of Common Concern" appeared
in newspapers across the state. signed by government, business
labor and religious leaders. calling for a swift solution to the
crisis. Later, students staged a mass rally in Harrisburg to
demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the legislators inactions.

Although both actions were seen as important. and students
hailed their rally as a turning point, it wasn't until early in December
that the logiam broke. After three reiections. the House passed a
tax—hike bill on Dec. 7, and the Senate did the same Dec. 8.

The money from the bill. which raised the personal income tax
rate from 2% to 2.2% and the corporate net income tax rate from
9.5% to lO.5%. was added to a utility receipts tax and some
budget cuts to raise the almost $300 million needed for the
universities.

But on more move was to come. Before signing the tax bill
into law iust before Christmas, Gov. Milton Shapp declared
more cuts were needed in the appropriations. Pitt's $6l.7 million
was slashed $l.2 million, an action Posvar called "bitterly disap-
pointing and quite unfair."

The nearly $69 million Pitt had hoped for in March had become
about $60 million in December, and the state payments scheduled
to begin July I were nearly six months late. But the Universities will
be better prepared for the next Appropriations Fight. Although
the I977 crisis is over. a chronic problem has been born.

Pitt’s winters have become so cold, snowy and
wet that it has become somewhat of an event.
Along with the "Big Freeze” comes many activities-
from snow snoveling. to "traying" on Flagstaff hill,
to skiing down Bouquet Street. This winter was no
exception. It even had something extra- a few days
off from classes.

It might not have been quite like
The Great Gumball Rally and it
might have been a little nippy
outside, but everyone who was
there really had a great time.

The racers were sleek in design.
Some were designed for flat-out
racing only, as evident from some
of the cars, which could only be
driven from the lying f|at—on—your—
stomach position. The drivers
spared no expense in building the
racers, although there were pro-

The only thing really missing was

41THE COUNTRY WIFE

Wit. charming rakes, fops. fools of all sorts.
women of quality. maids. country lasses, and
orange wenches are the stock comic characters
of Restoration comedy. William \X/ycherley's
The Country Wife is peopled by them.

One of the most celebrated wits and pleasure
seekers of dramatic literature is Mr. Horner of
the Country Wife. Harry Horner. long a lewd
man—about—town. long a seducer of other men's
wives and daughters. spreads a rumor about
London; that he has been rendered impotent
by a French surgeon. Many men are fooled by
Horner's trick. and invite him into their homes
to be an "innocent" plaything for their wives,
sisters. and daughters.

Love plots. however. like comic plots. are the
more interesting when they do not run smoothly.
Difficulty is the playwrights ace and the lovers
greatest aprodisiac. Jack Pinchwife. an exceed-
ingly jealous man. has not heard the rumor
about Horner. As he goes to great lengths to hide
his pretty. foolish country wife. from Homer.
he manages not only to fan the flames of de
in his sophisticated rival but in his "witless"
wife Margery.

THE UNIVERSITY

After almost two centuries of development, the University of
Pittsburgh has become a major institution of higher education
serving the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
nation.

Private. state-related. and non—sectarian. Pitt today is a complex
of I6 schools. 97 departments. 34 special centers. and four regional
campuses serving outlying regions of Pennsylvania at Greensburg.
Johnstown. Bradford, and Titusville. The Pittsburgh campus consists
of 52 buildings on I25 acres of land, dominated by the Cathedral of
Learning, a historic landmark and. at 42 stories, the tallest school
building in the country.

Under the leadership of Wesley Wentz Posvar. who became the
University's |5th Chancellor in I967. Pitt has experienced a period of
extraordinary growth in the past IO years. ln that period, University

enrollment has more than doubled to its present 35.000 students.
Full— and part—time faculty numbering 2,900 teach more than 826,000
credit—hours each year.

While striving to conserve traditional values of scholarship
through outstanding teaching and research. the University has also
oriented its efforts towards public service and solutions to the prob-
lems of an urban environment and an international society. New
schools and programs added in the past IO years reflect these added
dimensions: the School of Health Related Professions; new research
centers such as the University Center for Urban Research, and the
University Center for International Studies; special centers such as
the Center for Arms Control and International Security Studies, and
the Pennsylvania Ethnic Heritage Studies Center; and the develop-
ment of interdisciplinary studies and programs. such as the conso|i—

At the heart of these efforts is the new Hillman Library. center
of a library system housing more than 2.9LD.OOO volumes. Other new
major buildings constructed during the past ten years include new
homes for the Schools of Law. Engineering. and Nursing; the award»

The University has continued to increase in national and inter
national stature. annually attracting more than $|0mi|lion in exter-

bership in the Association of American Universities. a select organ-
ization of the nation's most respected graduate and research univer-
sities.

Pitt has been the site of many significant scientific accomplish-
ments. The Salk polio vaccine was developed and tested here by
Dr. Jonas Salk in I953-, the hormone ACTH was synthesized by Dr.
Klaus Hofmann in l96|; and synthetic insulin was developed by Dr.
Panayotis Katsoyannis in I964. In I975 Pitt anthropologist Dr. James
Adovasio began an archeological dig just south of Pittsburgh which
has since been confirmed as the oldest verified site of continuous
human occupation in the Western Hemisphere.

Pitt's 60 plus Fiji's continue to
make a name for the Fraternity of
Phi Gamma Delta — the Univer-
sity's first established fraternity 4
—— by exceling in fraternity, com-
munity and campus events.

New. challenging endeavors are
quickly becoming as part of the Fiji way of life as the older. traditional mainstays.

New endeavors: Social services and public and parents relations in an attempt to reveal the positive aspects
of the Greek system.

Traditional mainstays: a strong rush. which has resulted in the largest fraternity membership orfcampus. By
initiating a diverse audience of young men, Phi Gamma Delta has been able to combine a wide range of talents
for efforts in Greek Week. Homecoming. and intramural sports. Individual interests also result in spreading the
talents throughout campus into IFC, the Pitt News, University Senate and the Homecoming and Commuter Com-
mittees to name a few.

All this is accomplished, of course. in between such
joyous gatherings as the famous Fiji Island party, the
Black Diamond Ball, The Norris Pig Dinner, Founders Day
Dinner and other scheduled and unscheduled events. A

By Mary S. Huzinec

Pitt freshman Anne Jenkins opened the door of her
Tower B room for the first time. She glanced around and
frowned; it was not what she had expected.

The room was small; she could not imagine sharing it
with another person. Two bare pu||—out beds sat on each
side of her, and there was barely any walking space be-
tween them. Desks with scorched formica tops faced the
wall.

“They've got to be kidding,” she said. "This must be
someone’s closet."

Anne bought throw rugs, lamps and prints for the room.
When she and her roommate, Cindy, hung a "Home,
Sweet Home" poster they laughed for 20 minutes, then

wondered about the potential of the Tower's design —
particularly for people, architects and housing officials.

Anne and Cindy had liked each other at first. But
Cindy chain smoked, never made her bed and decorated
the floor with orange peels and cigarette butts. The day
Anne found moldy yogurt under her bed, she decided it
might be time for apartment hunting.

Anne was lucky. Two friends with a vacancy in their
Shadyside apartment invited her to move in. Anne loved
the space. There was a large living room with two chairs,
a couch and some scattered end tables. The kitchen had
room enough for her toaster and blender at the same
time, a luxury she hadn't known in the Towers.

But the apartment took more of her time than the dorm
room. There were more things to be cleaned, more

items, like mops and dishwashing liquid to buy. And
cooking for herself meant standing in long lines at the
Giant Eagle with people who talked to themselves, or
dropping eggs and milk all over Walnut Street on the
way home from shopping.

Taking a bus to school meant getting up earlier to get
to class on time, or walking, if the buses were running
late.

Dorm life had cramped Anne, but apartment living was
wearing her out. She found out early in her college
career how difficult living on or off campus could be.

Obviously, there are advantages to both.

Students usually live in the dorms because of con-
venience, security, custodial work and lack of available
off-campus housing.

Living in an apartment. however has several ad-
vantages over dorm living: privacy, more space and
option to cook your own food.

Often it's hard to decide which dorm or which apart-
ment you want after you've opted for on or off-campus
housing. On campus you have single, double, triple and
quad room in Towers A, B and C, and Holland, Bracken-
ridge, McCormick, Amos and Lothrop Halls to choose
from.

Off campus your choices include a variety of furnished
apartments, houses and efficiencies. The hardest thing is
to find one that has the conveniences you want.

Or maybe, as Anne found, the hardest thing is to
adjust to the inconveniences of both dorms and
apartments.

The Lonely] Lung [lI5'llEJlIl.'.E
EUIIIIIIIIUTEHS

BY Angele Ellis

I rode in via Forbes Avenue. past Arby's and Sera—Tech
Biologicals. the bank clock that blinked 957 (late again)
the and the burned-out Strand Bowling sign. My view of Oak‘
land, through grime—spattered U—Bus windows, narrowed like
a bowling alley, with the Cathedral as a grotesque head pin.

I stumbled off the bus at Hillman Library. clutching the
tel|—tale commuter's burden: a day's load of books and
folders and a crumpled bag lunch. I ran to class and slipped
into a seat. feeling conspicuous and foreign. like a housewife.
returning to college after 20 years. And. like a housewife, I
lived in a suburb world of lawns. family dinners and next-
door neighbors. For me. Pitt ended at '5 p.m.. when the II U
sighed to a stop across from the Cathedral.

In class. conversations floated around me — talk of room-
mates. cafeteria food, weekend plans. My remarks were
limited to coursework and professors’ eccentricities. Other
students, with their room keys and meal tickets. were unreal
to me. All I had was my ID and a wrinkled bus pass. I never
would run into them in Towers lobby or Hillman some evening,
, or sit near them at a Pangborn movie.

College life is fluid. Around me. people were changing.
discarding and remolding their ideas. friends. habits and
lives. But how could I change. when I came home every night
and dumped my books. high school—sty|e. on the kitchen
counter?

As my life narrowed. I clung to the few high school friends
who attended Pitt. We ate lunch together. an isolated circle
on the Cathedral lawn when the weather was good. a group
huddled in the neo—Gothic shadows of the Commons Room
when the weather was bad.

Even this enforced togetherness was preferable to the
days when. due to schedule or sickness. I was left alone. I
sought refuge in a nook in the Cathedral or in a chair in Hill-
inan. There, I felt safe. My loneliness was not exposed. as it
was the few times I loitered in Burger Chef. using a Pitt News
(filled with the events I couldn't participate in) as a frail
defense against the chatter around me. I also was saved from
wandering through the decaying, Hot L Baltimore-like
Student Union. with the sinking sensation of being checked
out — and rejected - 30 times in as many seconds.

In the evening. during the long. rush—hour bus ride. I lapsed
into commuter mononucleosis. as the jargon of Poli Sci 50
or Math 80 jangled in my head. and the wor|d—the guarded
faces of the other riders, the graying scene outside — pressed
in with relentless ugliness.

At home. life continued in the disjointed, empty pattern
of high school. Weekday nights blurred by with TV or study.
More television than study — it was hard to concentrate. and
the loud. mindless action on the tube numbed my fatigue.
Weekends slipped away with bickering or reading. I took
trips to silly movies and aimless drives to escape the house
and the sensation of endless childhood.

I decided to move to Oakland one winter night when the U
Bus didn't come. I stood in the bus shelter across from the
Cathedral for 45 minutes. the cold attacking my feet and my
book—cramped hands. I had a headache. and hated the pros-
pect of taking a 705 bus and blundering downtown in the
dark. looking for my bus stop.

I hung up and trudged upstairs. The Commons Room was
deserted - chairs pushed away from tables. lights clouded.
and stone gnomes grinning spookily in the dusk. It reminded
me of a story in which a man wandered through an empty
town; each building he entered seemed to have been de»
serted the moment before. My footsteps, hurrying outside.
sounded loud and hollow.

I stood on the Cathedral balcony for a long time, hands
hooked onto the cold stone railing. watching my frozen
breath dissolve in the night. I looked out on the people living
behind them. I failed. One group of people. then another,
passed beneath me, laughing.

After a while. I went to meet my ride.

The Greek system has long been an integral part of the University of Pittsburgh. Many leaders are products of the
Greek system at Pitt. including several national Greek officers and field counselors. Three national pre§idents spent
their college days in the Pitt Greek system. Many of those who form Pitt's administration have Greek backgrounds.
including a number of vice-chancellors and members of the Board of Trustees, as well as nearly the entire staff of
the Student Activities Office. There are currently 2| national fraternities, one local. and I5 sororities. all of which are
national. The system is stable, internally and externally. Greeks control most of the leadership positions throughout
campus, including most of the Student Government Board and the editor of the campus newspaper. In addition. the
IFC and Panhellenic Association, as a joint Greek Council, has become one of the nation's strongest systems.

General Information:

This year. the Commuter Committee has assumed a more active
role in dealing with the commuter population.

During Homecoming Week. a group of commuters constructed
a float that was entered in the parade and float competition.

The committee is now focusing on several other proiects. A
"Commuter Suggestion Box" has been placed in the Student Union
by the elevators. This will serve as a means for all commuters to
voice their problems. complaints. or suggestions. A nearby bulletin
board will keep commuters aware of Committee developments.

A major program now being developed by the Commuter Coin-
mittee is "the Commuter Bandit". This program involves four
general parking areas immediately surrounding the University.
The bandit will deposit 5 cents in an expired meter that has not
been ticketed. This program will hopefully in time become self-
supporting. The bandits are members of the committee and are
being assisted by brothers of Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

Another undertaking is improvement of the Rec Room food sere
vice. The Committee is responsible for the addition of regular size
hot dogs. chile and hot chocolate. Many of their other recommenv
dations will hopefully be carried out.

It is hoped that the efforts of the Commuter Committee will
result in increased commuter involvement in all campus organiza-
tions and thus. more awareness that the commuters are the
majority of Pitt's population.

lt is true that the content of a Liberal
Arts education is very broad. There are
in CAS approximately 33(the number
changes as new definitions and new
structures emerge) fairly traditional
“disciplines,” i.e., areas of study, divid-
ed into three categories of Humanities,
Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences.
Nothing less, therefore, than humanity,
society, and nature are the objects of
study in a Liberal Arts curriculum. It
might be added that, as you can see in
the later descriptions of various "pro-
grams” (as opposed to "departments").
there are continuing efforts to develop
areas of study that run across the dis-
ciplines, that are “interdisciplinary” or
“multidisciplinary.”

ANTHROPOLOGY

Anthropology

Anthropology offers a multi faceted approach to educa-
tion because it encompasses every dimension of the life ex-
perience. The Department not only offers a major in an-
thropology but has also included a series of diversified
offerings in the curriculum. Consequently, students who
have majors in other fields and who have met the prere—
quisite course requirements may choose from selected topic
courses to gain further insight to the "anthropological
approach."

The Anthropology Department at the University of Pitts-
burgh offers specializations in five major subfields, Psy—
cho/ogical Anthropology, Physical Anthropology. Cultural
Anthropology. Anthropology. Archae/ogy. and Anthropolo-
gical Linguistics.

Psycholigical Anthropology focuses on the interaction
between individual behavior and socio—cultura| systems.
Among the current pursuits of the faculty in this area are
the study of expressive culture. child and adolescent social-
ization, culture and cognition personality traits and socio-
cultural change. and the application of quantitative techni-
ques in research.

The Physical Anthropology program offers training in a
wide range of areas within the field. Faculty expertise
covers anatomy, behavior. paleontology and provision is
made to supplement from outside the Department in such
areas as genetics and biostatistics. The laboratory facilities
within the Department are perhaps the best of any anthro-
pology department in the country. Students in the pro-
gram make extensive use of these facilities either for their
own research or as part of ongoing faculty projects.

Cultural Anthropology is the section of anthropology
whose aim is to describe and analyze human diversity.
Cultural anthropologists work with materials from non
western areas and have a wide variety of interests. Some
members of this Department specialize in family structures.
political institutions. religion, urbanization. Area specializa-
tions are in Latin America. American Indians. Japan, Caribe
bean and Africa.

The Department operates the most extensive Archeolo-
gical Research and Training Program in the Eastern United
States. Field operations are conducted on a year round basis
in areas as far ranging as Cyprus. Peru. Yugolslavia. Mexico.
The Great Basin, The American Southwest and the Upper
Ohio Valley. The archeological laboratories are the most
extensively equipped examples of their kind in the United
States and perhaps the world.

Anthropological Linguistics offers an in—depth approach to
language study which is very important research. In
addition to the basic introductory course, students are en-
couraged to correlate their area subfield specializations
with topical anthropological linguistics courses offered in the
Department.

Chemistry

The Department of Chemistry is in a new I5-
story building that houses its classrooms, offices.
and laboratories for undergraduate instruction
and graduate research. Funding by the National
Science Foundation and the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania has made possible a number of
faculty additions and substantial purchases of
new instructional and research equipment.

The undergraduate chemistry program is one
of the ten largest in this country. For the chem-
istry majors, a core of material is provided
that will prepare them for as many later options
as possible. Direct employment at the B.S. leads
students both into traditional laboratory work
and into careers involving chemistry and other
disciplines.

The undergraduate curriculum meets all of the
science requirements for admission to grad-
uate school in chemistry and to any one of the
graduate health professions. Graduate studies
include extensive research activities in analyti-
cal, organic, inorganic and physical chemistry,
while the forensic chemistry program is recog—
nized as one of the best in the country.

CLASSICS

Classics

The Department of Classics offers two types of courses on the ancient culture of Greece
and Rome, those based on readings in English and those in Latin and ancient Greek. The
courses include seminars for freshman, classes for honors students, lecture and discussion
as well as language and literature classes for all undergraduate student. In the classes based
on readings in English, students learn about the foundations of western history, thought
religion, mythology, art, rhetoric, and poetic and prose forms of literature. They are also
introduced to the significant contributions of Greece and Rome in such areas as law, medi-
cine, education and engineering. In the first year of Latin or Greek language, the students
receive an introduction to not only these ancient languages but also a valuable basis for
understanding English and some modern European languages. The other language courses
give students the opportunity to read works in the original by such authors as Homer, Sopho-
cles, Plato, Cicero, Virgil and Ovid.

COMPUTER SCIENCE

Computer Science

The Department offers a BS. degree program in computer science. The objectives of the program are;
I. To provide the opportunity for students to focus their educational efforts on computer sciene as a discipline.
2. To prepare students for employment and positions of responsibility in an increasingly computer-oriented
world. 3. To prepare students for graduate study in computer science.

A student majoring in computer science may select one of the following areas of concentration: (I) data
processing, (2)operating systems, (3) preparation for graduate study, (4) computer languages, (5) industrial
computing, (6) computer hardware and its uses, (7) theory of computing, and (8) numerical analysis. Because
fo the variety and richness of these options, our graduates are employed in virtually every segment of business.
industry, education, medicine and government. Currently, graduates in computer science are in great de-
mand.

A small percentage of our graduates choose to specialize further in computer science by studying at the
graduate level, either at Pitt—we offer M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs—or elsewhere.

EARTH 8 PLANETARY SCIENCES

Earth and Planetary Science

The Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences offers programs of teaching and research in geology.
geophysics, geochemistry, and planetry sciences. The primary role of the Department is the training of under-
graduate and graduate students in the geosciences and in conducting research in these areas. Our under-
graduate majors receive a broad and basic educational foundation that is designed to make them competitive
in the current job market and in being accepted into the better graduate programs around the country. The
quality of our program is being increasingly recognized on the national level.

Students who are interested in science and enjoy working out of doors should find a satisfying career in the
geological sciences. Employment opportunities are currently very good. and the demand in the foreseeable
future for geoscientists will continue to be strong in light of the nation's increasing energy demands.

The Departmental faculty consists of IS full-time faculty members. Currently enrolled are about 35 under-
graduate and 45—graduate students.

ECONOMICS

Economics

The department of economics offers a great variety of courses on both the undergraduate and graduate
level. Sixty one courses are offered on the undergraduate level covering the areas of Economic History, Schools
of Economic Thought, Economic Theory, Mathematics and Research Techniques for Economists, Public Fi-
nance, Monetary Economics, Urban and Regional Economics, Labor, Industrial Organization, International
Economics. Comparative Economics, Development Economics, Area Studies, Honors Courses, Independent
Study and Courses for Non—Ma]ors. Forty-four courses are offered in the graduate level covering Comparative
Economic Systems, Demographic Economics, Development and Growth Economics, Econometrics, Economic
History, Fiscal Economics, Industrial Organization, International Economics, Labor Economics. Mathematical
Economics, Monetary Economics and Regional Economics. The total faculty including adjunct professors and
those whose primary appointments are in other departments is 45.

The department aims at preparing undergraduate students for graduate work, for jobs in industry and gov-
ernment. The Department's record for placing its graduate students in excellent positions in teaching and gov-
ernment is outstanding.

RESIDENT LIFE

by Mark Murphy

When I first moved into the dormitories that September day
in I976 I figured I was in for four years of hell. I anticipated cramped
quarters, bad food and a real loser for a roommate.

Boy, was I wrong. Through the windows of the Towers, I could
lean out and absorb all the beauty and culture of Oakland. I will
admit it did take me some time. about a full year, to see what I had
been missing. What convinced me was a letter from the Office of
Residence I ife telling me the results of a poll they took of inmates
on death row in San Quentin prison. Ihey asked the inmates to
describe the place that seemed like home, and nearly all, 93.759.
described quarters uncannily resembling the Towers.

I said to myself, "People like that must know a lot about living."
I thought for a moment, and considered the alternatives to
dormitory life.

Commuters must battle traffic. weather, and the PAI system
iust to get to school in time to hear it has been cancelled.

An apartment dweller must deal with monthly rent payments,
grizzled landlords. and heating bills that rise in proportion to the
falling tempature.

The first plus I diseovered about dorm life was acquiring a
roommate. Some students prefer to pick their roommates in ad
vanee, which is iioi nearly as much fun as sharing your most intimate

‘I8

bodily aberrations with a total stranger. What is more, your rooin
mate is always a great guy. Never Wlll he be so inconsiderate as
to make drug deals using the room phone. Never will the arsenal
of weapons he keeps in the bolster go off aeeidentally when he
lights a match. And never, but never will he entertain his girlfriend

in your room while you lie in feigned peaceful slumber just three
feet away.

Instead, most roommates play a great deal of pinochle, (when
not studying. of coursei. and take turns at leading group pi'ayer.
The space the Llniversity allots to each student is more than
adequate. I Wlll admit that I had to move my annual square dance

out of my room and into the hall but after the first month. I rarely
knocked my roommates teeth while stretching to yawn. There was
plenty of space for my three shirts and pair of ieans, and the shelf
space was more than SltlI|L‘|Cttl for any four thin books I chose to
bring.

The bathroom is perhaps the most fun place in the dorms. Always
clean and ready for use (after stepping over the pile of yuk

in the doorway). the bathrooms feature steaming hot water. If
you are small enough to crawl into a sink. you may use some of that
water. but for most people. a lukewarm (more luke than warmi
shower WIII have to do.

Enghsh

In recent years. the English department has experienced some declining
enrollment and a dramatic shift among its undegraduate majors from liter-
ature to writing. In I970 about 25 percent of its English majors were in the
writing sequence. Today 60 percent are writing majors.

Mary Louise Briscoe. chair of the English department. does not feel this
shift is necessarily indicative of students’ concerns with getting jobs when
they graduate. She bases her reasons on the fact that there are not many
jobs in poetry and fiction. "although some of our non-fiction writing majors
do get jobs in journalism."

She says, "We do not train people to get jobs; that is not what we are
about. Students are flocking to the writing program because they are look-
ing for a place where they can engage in self—expression. The writing pro-
gram offers what liberal arts has traditionally offered — a place where the
student can expand and grow intellectually."

Students concern with being able to express themselves in writing ap-
parently carries over to non—English majors as well. The department's
composition courses, available to all undergraduates, have been increas-
ingly popular. In I97| when the requirement that all Pitt undergraduates
take English composition was dropped, the enrollment in these courses de-
clined substantially. Since then enrollments in comp courses have been
steadily increasing to the point that they fill up very fast. and Briscoe
says. "We could offer more comp courses if we could staff them" The de-
partment offers eight different composition courses in I25 sections.

In I974 writing and composition were together in one program. In the fall
of that year there were 2,866 course registrations in writing and composi-
tion courses. In fall I977. enrollments in the writing and compositon pro-

|jj"————? ENGLISH

grans totaled 2,979 — 704 in writing and 2.275 in compo-
sitoin. During that same period. total undergraduate enroll-
ments in the department dropped. In fall I974 there were
5.6|5 grades issued in the department; in I975, 5,284; in I976.
5|4l; and last fall there were 5.066. The number of under-
graduate majors has also declined from about 500 in the
early I970s to approximately 300 now. However. according
to Fiore Pugliano. undergraduate advisor in the department.
the number of English majors has remained constant in the
last few years at about 300.

With the number of writing majors increasing. it is the lit-
erature program which has felt the brunt of the declining en-
rollment. And. according to Briscoe. the 80s or introductory
lit course have experienced the most steady decline. These
are the courses which students who were considering major-
ing in English lit would have taken first. but since so many
students are going into the writing program, many of these
lit courses are not filling up. The department is offering few-
er sections of the 805 courses now.

This phenomenon. which is not peculiar to Pitt. has affect-
ed graduate programs as well. Briscoe explains. The 805
courses were once the center of English departments's
teacher training programs. she says. At Pitt these introduc-
tory courses were often offered in large sections with one
faculty member and several teaching assistants and fellows
helping the faculty person. But today people who want to
teach English need to be able to teach composition and writ-
ing. not literature. Because of the changing student demand.
"that's where the teaching jobs are. so our TAs need more
experience in comp and writing." Briscoe points out, noting
that the department has added an area to the Ph. D. compre-
hensive exam in composition. The department has about I00
graduate students ~ 47 of them are TAs and TFs.

Right now the English department is engaged in a self-
evaluation. Various committees of faculty are taking a hard
look at the curriculum and are considering new ways to offer
the information which is most vital to literature majors. Bris-
ce says they are considering changing courses titles and re-
organizing some courses.

James Kanpp. who chairs the Committee for the Evaluation
of Undergraduate Curriculum in the department. says "I
don't think there is opposition(among faculty) to meeting de-
mands of students at all. but we find it hard to predict what
will go." He points out that a course he developed call "Medi-
eval lmagination" was tremendously popular. while some
modern literature courses are not doing as well as one might
expect.

His committee is looking for ways to pique students in-
terest in literature. For example, they are considering
courses which use literature to look at social change. at ur-
ban centers. and even at the future. He notes that some tra-
ditional courses have remained popular, such as Shakespeare.
and some newer courses are consistently popular. such as
ones dealing with science fiction. Others such as drama
courses enroll fewer students than they once did. Knapp says
there has been aproliferation of drama courses both in the
English depatment and in other departments like theatre.
and "we're probably saturating the market."

FINE ARTS

The Fine Arts Department offers under-
graduate courses in almost all fields of West-

ern and non-Western art. However, at the ad-

vanced and graduate levels it seeks to pro-
vide rich concentrations in a few fields with
special excellence rather than a thin overall
coverage. The fields of greatest emphasis
are Modern and Medieval art, and, to a
slightly lesser degree, Renaissance and Ori-
ental art. Research is supported by the Frick
Fine Arts Library, located in the same build-
ing with the department. This non-circulat-
ing library, one of the facilities of greatest
excellence in the University, ranks among
the best collections of art history books in
the United States. The University Art Gal-
lery, also located in the Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts building, offers a program of exhi-
bitions planned to correspond to the course
offerings in the Department.

French and Italian

The Department offers undergraduate and masters degree programs in both French and
Italian and a doctoral program in French.

In order to respond to expanding and changing professional markets, the course offerings
are flexible and varied. Students are able to chose from among several areas of specializa-
tion in which language, literature and civilization are combined in ways that best suit the
students needs and interests. Majors are encouraged to combine their language major with a
related field for a more comprehensive educational experience and a diversified training
that will make them more attractive to potential employers.

A graduate degree is essential for those planning careers in higher education. Post bac-
calaureate study is also available for those who want to go into foreign service and pro-
fessional interpreting and translating. . The need for further study beyond the B.A. depends
on the student's goals but, the department stresses, the greater the degree of competency,
the greater the likelihood of employment.

Students are welcome to discuss the foreign language field and the department's pro-
grams with the undergraduate advisors. The departmental office is located in room I328
Cathedral of Learning and the extension is 5220.

Germanic Languages and Literatures

The study of German at Pitt interrelates language. and culture. with a primary emphasis on language. In recent years. the Department
of Germanic Languages and Literature has been shifting its emphasis from the historical dlltti.‘nSlOnS of German toward the contemporary
by offering specially designed courses in culture and by changing the content of traditional language and literature courses.

The department emphasizes a broad general preparation in German and does not recommend specialization on the undergraduate level.
In addition to the required language. literature and culture courses in German. students are encouraged to take language courses in other
departments and courses in history. sociology. philosophy. fine arts, and music. Second majors or strong minor concentrations are ad—

 

vised for students with an interest in such fields as busine. . economics. computer science. mathematics. and teaching.
Ma'ors take intensive courses in the German lan tua ‘e (readin 1. s veakin i and com osition ). courses on the histor of German s weakin ‘

Graduate education is not necessary to teach in secondary schools. but it is necessary for college and university teaching. Beyond the
field of teaching. students who receive MS. and Ph.D. degrees in German may have difficulty finding employment.

Prospective majors should be curious about foreign cultures and adapt in learning languages. Basic language courses in German or
German culture literature courses taught in English (80.8|.|80.|82) can introduce the prospective major to the program. During the student's
college career a year. term. or summer abroad in a German-speaking country is strongly recommended to highlight the cultural and lan—
guage experience.

Geography 

The goal of geography is to interpret the meaning of geographic location and topre_dic._t I "
and plan for mankinds future within earths limitations. Geographers study land use," cit
space organization, transportation movements, and natural and man-made environments at
world, regional, and local scales.

At Pitt, majors in geography combine skill courses (cartography, air photo/remote sensing
interpretation, field procedures, quantitative methods, statistics, and computer science)
with classroom and lab experiences and are encouraged to gain broad familiarity with the
other social sciences. Geography can be a path to a liberal education, or a preparation for
graduate and professional schools, or it can lead to employment, typically in the environ-
ment—related planning fields.

Geographers usually like to be out of doors, to read maps, to enjoy landscapes, and to
travel. They want to work with people and ideas, and are concerned with fundamental
problems of living together on spaceship Earth.

History
The history department offers Pitt under-
graduates a variety of opportunities to develop
their academic skills. broaden their knowledge.
and, generally, to cultivate abilities which should
facilitate life-long learning. The study of history
involves a good deal of reading and writing. Under-
graduates who wish to learn how to read critically.
to write fluently, and to think independently can
learn a great deal from the study of history.
History students develop a healthy scepticism
about the printed word and find that statistical
data often serve to obscure the truth. Historians
search for complex realities which often remain
little understood, obscured by well-known person-
alities and events whether past or present.

The struggle to discover these realities and to
make them known to others defines one major task
of the historian. The skills fostered by this struggle
have wide application in other areas of inquiry.
History offers an excellent background for the
study of law, business administration. library
science, urban and regional planning, social work
and public affairs, and foreign area studies.

The history department at Pitt emphasizes social
history and foreign area studies; Asia Western
Europe. Latin America, Russia and Eastern Europe.
Thus, students have a chance not only to develop
their skills but also to experience societies and
cultures different from their own. For further
information on department offerings of a major in
history call 624—S5|5 or stop in the departmental
office on the third floor of the Forbes Quadrangle.

Jewish Studies

The Jewish Studies Program, an integral
part of the Department of Religious Studies
at the University of Pittsburgh, offers a
variety of undergraduate courses in both
Jewish history and thought as well as

in the Hebrew language.

Jewish Studies courses focus on the
full spectrum of the Jewish experience
from the dawn of civilization to the most
recent period in contemporary history. It
is the Program's purpose to awaken stu-
dents to the breadth and complexity of
Jewish life and thought as well as to indi-
cate the interelationship between Jewish
and non-Jewish life in both Muslim and
Christian societies.

Students may major in Jewish studies
by drawing up their own self-designed
major or they may select Jewish studies
courses in order to fulfill distribution of
studies requirements. Students majoring in
Religious Studies may choose Jewish Studies
as one of their areas of concentration
within that major.

BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES

Biological Sciences
The Biological Sciences Department was
formed in January I976 with the merger of
the departments of Biochemistry, Bio-
physics/Microbiology and Biology. The
undergraduate major includes the require-
ments for application to professional
schools (medicine, dentistry. etc) and
provides the necessary background for
graduate work in the biological sciences.
It also provides a rigorous scientific pro-
gram for students interested in pursuing
careers of graduate programs in other
areas. The Department faculty is divided
into three teaching divisions: (I) Bio-
chemistry and Biophysics, (2) Genetics,
Cellular and Developmental Biology, (3)
Environmental and Evolutional Biology. A
variety of courses are offered in these
areas at the undergraduate and graduate
level. The Pymatuning Laboratory of
Ecology, a field station maintained by the
department, offers opportunities for re-
search and course work in theoretical
ecology and field biology. Advanced level
undergraduate and graduate level courses
are offered at the Pymatuning facility

in the Spring and Summer Sessions. A
growing interdepartmental program in
Neurobiology and Behavior is being de-
veloped with the Psychology Department.
All majors must take a required core of four
courses in Biological Sciences which are or-
ganized in terms of levels of organization:
with courses in: Molecular Biology, Cellular
and Developmental Biology, Organismal
Biology, and Population and Evolutionary
Biology. Corequisites for all majors are one
year of calculus, one year of physics, one
year of inorganic chemistry, one year of
organic chemistry. These requirements re-
flect the growing emphasis in biology of
mathematics, chemistry, and physics for
understanding the nature of biological
phenomena. After completing the core
course, students are free to complete
their major with a series of upper level
courses developing depth in one of the
particular Divisions (Biochemistry/
Biophysics is developing a proposed major
in their Division) represented within the
Department, of gaining further breadth
through taking advanced courses from all
the Divisions.

The Program in Language Com-
munications (Education) is a major
unit in the University’s commitment
to literacy. It offers undergraduate
courses in college reading and study
skills, reading acceleration, and
methods of teaching reading and
English in public schools. Master's
Degree programs provide advanced
competencies for classroom teach-
ers, and preparation for the roles of
reading specialist, reading super-
visor, and English supervisor. The
Doctoral program prepares advanced
students for research, for college
teaching and for curriculum leader-
ship.

Precise diagnosis and treatment
of communication difficulties is as
complex as brain surgery, but most
beginning teachers obtain only an
introduction to the professional
skills needed. The Faculty in
Language Communications is dedi-
cated to improving this situation
and to doing research on the pro-
cesses involved.

EAST ASIAN STUDIES

East Asian Languages and Literatures

The Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures has undergraduate and graduate programs in Chi-
nese and Japanese language, literature and culture. There are classes in modern standard Chinese and Japanese
taught at the elementary, intermediate and advanced levels, and the emphasis is on learning to speak as well
as writing so as to prepare students to use the language both for travelling and research. There are courses in
English on the literature and cultural heritage of these two Asian civilizations, as well as specialized offerings
in literature, linguistics, language teaching methodology, classical language, calligraphy, and films.

Students majoring in Chinese or Japanese also take courses on Asia in other departments in order to gain
a broad understanding of the uniqueness of this part of the world, and to become familiar with the differences
among the many countries in Asia. It is a small department with frequent contact between faculty and students,
and one in which faculty members take a personal interest in their students.

There are student groups which sponsor a variety of extracurricular activities for the purpose of learning
more about Asia and meeting people from those countries. Moreover. there are opportunities for study in
Japan and China for a summer or in a two term year abroad program.

MATHEMATICS 8 STATISTICS

Mathematics 8 Statistics
The two goals of the Mathematics/Statistics Department are (I) to help others learn through a well-designed
curriculum, good teaching and informed advising and (2) to improve our own understanding through research
activities. Our undergraduate course offerings fall into three categories: survey courses, service courses and
field courses. The survey courses are designed for students who wish to acquaint themselves with the nature
and role of mathematics/statistics in the modern world without being intimidated by technical complexities.
The service courses are designed for students who need to learn skills, concepts and techniques which are
necessary or desirable in programs of other departments. The field courses provide a greater depth of under-
standing in a particular subject matter and are primarily taken by our own undergraduate majors.
The department offers a flexible major with several joint major programs (Computer Science, Economics,

Philosophy, Psychology and Sociology) and several subareas of concentration (applied mathematics, numerical
analysis, probability/statistics and pure mathematics).

MILITARY SCIENCE

‘ Military Science

The Military Science Department offers the Army
ROTC Program to all full-time students through the 4-
year and 2-year plan. The goal of the Department is to
train and commission sufficient numbers of college grad-
uates for service as officers in the US. Army to include
full-time active duty and part-time Army Reserve and
National Guard duty. In this mission, the Department
functions as an instrument of the Unviersity to provide
the opportunity for students with aspirations for military
service to earn officer appointments during their
academic career.

The Department presents courses in Military Science
through leadership laboratories and extracurricular
activities, and management skills relative to government
service in various academic courses. These courses,
American Military History, National Strategy, Dynamics
of Group Presentation, and Defense Management, are
intended to prepare the student for successful job
performance in initial assignment upon commissioning.

Studio Arts

Do you want to learn how to draw, paint or sculpt?

The program in the Studio Arts Department provides
an opportunity for students who have no previous art
experience to take classes in the Studio Arts and learn
something about the creative phenomena of Design,
Drawing, Color, and Sculpture. The beginning Core
Courses are specifically beneficial to all students.

They aim to give the student an understanding and the
basic skills of art through practical application.

Beyond the Core Courses the art program is planned
to prepare those students who wish to pursue a career in
art. The program fulfills the necessary requirements for
graduate schools; to teach art; to continue on to graduate
work in architecture, medical illustration, city planning.
public relations, art history and other fields as prospec-
tive professional artists. The preparation received in the
College of Arts and Sciences gives the student a broad
perspective and discipline needed to grow as an artist.

PHILOSOPHY

Philosophy

The Philosophy Department is proud to be among the largest and finest in the nation; it is
committed to broad and deep education on both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
Undergraduates, who on whom about three-quarters of the departments teaching efforts are
concentrated, may choose between two major options, as well as a wide range of courses of
equal interest to non—majors. The Standard Major is unusually flexible in its requirements, to
accommodate the varied needs of the many able students who want to major in both philoso-
phy and another area. This reflects the department's conviction that philosophy is a central
and integral part of the Western intellectual heritage, and thus of a sound education. We
therefore encourage double majors, and also a variety of joint programs. The Honors Major is
more demanding and more structured; it is designed primarily for those few students who

choose to pursue philosophy at an especially high level, and thereby take fuller advantage of
the extraordinary opportunities available at Pittsburgh.

PHYSICS 8 ASTRONOMY

 

Physics and Astronomy

The study of physics and astronomy is aimed

at understanding the nature of the universe.
from the subnuclear to the extragalactic levels,
and discovering the basic laws that govern all
natural phenomena. Through its programs of
teaching and research, the Department of
Physics and Astronomy increases the students’
understanding of what is known and how it was
discovered, enlarges the body of scientific
knowledge, and trains advanced students to
make discoveries of their own. The Depart-
ment's teaching programs range from courses
aimed at nonscience majors through various
levels of preparation for work in scientific
and science related fields. Areas of study in
the Department include astronomy and astro-
physics, atomic and nuclear physics, ele-
mentary particles, general relativity, quantum
optics, solid state physics, and space physics.
The Department welcomes inquiries from in-
terested students about any aspect of its
teaching or research programs.

232

POLITICAL SCIENCE

Political Science

The undergraduate political science majors offers the student courses in four basic areas:
American Government, Comparative Government, International Relations, and Political
Theory. Courses are designed: I) to enhance the student's competence to assume the role of
a democratic citizen; 2) to increase his awareness of the relationship the United States
Government has with other governments; 3) to familiarize the student with the great
philosophical questions concerning the values of various systems of politics; and 4) to pro-
vide the student with the ability to analyze, evaluate, and carry out contemporary social
science research. The Departments current plans include institution of a departmental honors
program and also the addition of elective research seminars with limited enrollment for
undergraduate majors. A government and public service concentration, which includes
specialized courses and internships, is available for those students interested in pursuing
careers in government service.

   
  

233

Psychology
The department of Psychology is, appropriately, in the Natural Sciences at Pitt. Psychology

is the scientific study of human experience and behavior and deals with the relationship of
these to biological processes, the activity of other animals, social interactions, and the well-
being of the individual and his/her society. In the various undergraduate courses, special
attention is given to the social and cognitive development of the child; the physiological and
neuronhemical bases of homeostasis, learning, and sexual behavior; the psychological pro-
cesses underlying social control and social conflict; and the origins and treatment of emo-
tional and behavioral disorders. In these and related courses, the emphasis is placed upon
research, methodological developments, critical issues, and theoretical formulations. The
ultimate goal remains the better understanding of the individual and his/her experience as a
unique person.

Sociology

Sociology is one of the basic social sciences, playing a
major role in the contemporary intellectual world. Some
knowledge of it is essential for the liberally educated
person. Sociologists study the ways in which social
structures and forms emerge out of social interaction.
as well as the movements and conflicts through which
they dissolve or change. Complex social systems often
behave in peculiar ways; well intended efforts for social
change always have unintended consequences; some-
times indeed they may unwittingly defeat themselves
by producing the opposite of the hoped for result. An
understanding of social systems and the complex inter-
actions of processes and trends within them is necessary
for intelligent and effective participation in modern
society.

Sociologists need to be methodical in their work; they
have invented many techniques of social observation.
measurement and analysis currently in wide use such as
survey analysis. methods for evaluation research. quanti-
tative methods in the study of social change and many
others. They are conscious of the need for social theory
and the forming of precise sociological concepts. Some
sociologists see themselves as critics and interpreters
of contemporary social trends.

Today sociological thought and methodology have
provided part of the knowledge base for many of the
social professions and many altered the manner in which
history and political science are practiced; they have
influenced literary criticism and the study of social work.
criminology. public administration and others. Often
debates of matters of public policy rely on sociological
notions and findings concernings such matters as social
stratification and inequality. demographic changes and
their consequences. the emergence of new forms of
organization, the impacts of knowledge and technology
and more. It is because of these facts that sociological
knowledge is an essential ingredient of the liberal arts.
The Sociology Department offers a broad set of intro-
ductory courses, for example in personality and social
role. the conception of societies. social problems and
others. It requires of its maiors courses in theory.
methods and statistics. In order to meet the require-
ments of sociology as a major a student must take four
required courses. two courses in the advanced (three
digit) level and four elective courses.

There are courses on American society and on many
specialized aspects of it. Many sociological courses have
an international and comparative perspective and relate
to programs such as in Latin American studies, Asian
studies and others. An important emphasis deals with
modernization and social change and with such subjects
as complex organizations as well as social movements. By
the nature of the field one aspect of the Department's
work links it closely to the humanities in cultural
sociology. Other aspects of the work link closely to
mathematics and the formal sciences. Opportunities for
study in applied sociology are available in such courses
as technology and social change. the sociology of
knowledge applications and others.

The bachelors degree in sociology does not qualify its
holder for a specialized career in sociology as such. It
is in this regard similar to other liberal arts degrees. for
example. in psychology or English. However. it does pro
vide excellent preparation for many occupations that in
some way deal with issues in organization or planning.
Many careers require well informed people of good sense
who have a basic understanding of modern society — for
this sociology is essential. Undergraduate work in socie
ology is essential. Undergraduate work in sociology furth-
er is a most useful preparation for professional studies
in the social professions such as public administration.
social work. certain aspects of public health. and of
course, for graduate work in any of the social sciences.

The Department of Slavic Languages and Litera-
tures offers students the opportunity to study the
languages. literatures and cultures of Russia and East-
ern Europe. including the Soviet Union. Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. As a small depart-
ment within a large university. the Slavic Department
prides itself in offering personal attention to its stu-
dents and in designing individual programs which
utilize the broad range of courses available at the
University of Pittsburgh. These programs strive to be
both intellectually stimulating and career oriented.
Since language is considered the key to cultural
experience, students are encouraged to explore the

The study of theatre arts at Pitt includes the history. theory
and practice of the theatrical arts. In addition, study of the theatre
involves affective education and training in specific crafts such

as design. criticism, and directing. which relate to the art of the
theatre.

The Theatre Arts Program believes that a student must learn
both theory and practice to know theatre well. Accordingly, majors

are required to take a full complement of academic courses in
history and criticism. to take practical courses in performance
and/or design. and to participate in stage productions either on
stage, backstage. or front—of—house.

Students who are contemplating a theatre arts major should be
aware that they will usually spend more time in the theatre or
shops than in the rest of their classes combined. A sense or disposi-
tion towards the theatre seems to be the core requirement for a
successful major and later a successful career. Students need not be
brilliant or stars, outgoing or se|f—confident. Rather, students must
want to be part of the theatre. No prior experience is necessary.
Students with an interest or facility in painting and sculpture may
find their abilities helpful in scene. costume. and lighting design.
Students can take Speech 2|. "|ntroduction to the Theatre",

or "A Survey of Theatre" to glimpse the variety of experiences
in the theatre field. Speech 22, "Introduction to Drama", will intro-
duce the student to plays and the way playwrights use the medium
to reach their audiences. "Survey of World Theatre". (Speech )3).
examines theatre in its cultural contexts at various periods of
history and can also serve as a good introductory course for pro-
spective majors.

Undergraduate majors in theatre arts may concentrate on per
formance or technical theatre and design. Performance majors
study aspects of acting such as voice and movement, improvisa-
tion. characterization and scene work. and directing. Technical
theatre/design majors study lighting, scene and/or costume design.
stage construction, history of scenography. and/or history of
costume. Intensive courses in various periods of theatre history are
required of all majors. These courses include classical Greek and
Roman theatre, Renaissance theatre, modern theatre (l880|930).
and contemporary theatre (World War |l—present).

Both performance and research opportunities are available for
theatre arts majors. Students may select from a variety of work-
shops for study with non—students. Majors can do field research for
documentary theatre productions. Students can participate in
performances of the program's many production areas such as the
Instructional Performance Company (which stages scenes in class-
rooms). Childsplay (children's theatre), and inainstage productions
in Stephen Foster Memorial Auditorium and the University's Studio
Theatre. Academic credit is available for all of these opportunities.
Theatre arts training at Pitt is geared to prepare students for
careers in educational theatre in primary and secondary schools
and in colleges and in universities. In most circumstances a
post-baccalaureate degree is required for employment; however in

a rare instances a few graduates go directly from undergraduate
status to professional careers. In addition to educational and pro-
fessional employment, recent graduates have found work at WQED
(educational television). the Pittsburgh Ballet, and local corpor-
ations.

A substantial number of undergraduate theatre majors do not

plan theatrical careers. but find their major to be good preparation
for careers in law, counseling. and leisure—time service ac-
industries. Approximately 40 percent of the recent Pitt theatre
majors have continued into graduate training or professional
schools.

Theatre provides expanding opportunities for students trained
in technical theatre, design. and childrens theatre. There are few
jobs at the current time for professional actors and directors;
students are certain they want a career in professional (rather than
college or university) theatre should attend another school if they
can afford it. Pitt's Theatre Program considers professional
training as just one aspect of its program and emphasizes a theatre
experience, which is part of the liberalized university life.

Students who are considering the theatre arts major should read

the Educational Theatre Journal and join the American Theatre

The Speech 8 Theatre Arts Department also tries to give students
a better understanding of the processes that are involved in people
communicating with people. Students become familiar with factors
which improve the effectiveness of communication as well as
sources which become barriers to communication. As students
learn about the processes of communication they work to improve
their communication skills.

The department provides opportunities to study and become
more effective communicators in a wide variety of communication
situations ranging from person to person through small group to
mass media. Consideration is given to listening, speaking. as well
as the non—verba| aspects of communication in interviews, business
conferences, public speeches, therapy conferences, inter—cultural
meetings and a wide variety of real world as well as laboratory
settings. Disordered as well as normal communication receive
attention.

Students may major in one of three broad areas: Rhetroic 8
Communication, Speech 8 Hearing Science and Theatre Arts. The
AB. MA. MS. and Ph.D. degrees are offered in each of the three
sections. Many undergraduates continue in graduate school. Others
pursue professional training in Law. Medicine. Dentistry, Business
Speech. Pathology E Audiology, Broadcasting. Theatre, etc. An
undergraduate major in the department serves as a good base
for students who wish to work in a variety of settings where effec-
tiveness of communication with people is important.

SCHOOL OF EDUCATION

The major thrust of the School of Education is
the initial preparation and career advancement of
educators at all levels in the field of education.
More recently this thrust has been extended to in~
clude the initial preparation of professionals in
agencies and institutions other than public and pri-
vate schools. The need for such professionals in
this category has been increasing as the number of
social agencies with overlapping concerns of the
schools has increased. Strong research and innova-
tive programs support these thrusts at both the un-
dergraduate and graduate levels.

The faculty of the School of Education is made up
of full-time faculty with primary appointments in
the School of Education, faculty from other schools
with secondary appointments in the School of Edu-
cation and a few part—time adjunct faculty enlisted
by the School to provide unique and special compe-
tencies.

Organizationally, the programs of the School are
grouped into four divisions:

Division of Educational Development and Service
Desegregation and Conflict Center
Educational Placement Service
Office of Student Personnel Services

The purpose of the Dental Science Club is to Provide the Pre-dental student with the opportunity to better understand
the field of dentistry. The more exposure the student has to the field of dentistry the better he or she will be able to make
the decision if dentistry is for him or her.

In addition to speakers from various fields of Dentistry, projects are arranged at the Dental School to allow students to
work with dental materials. Such manual dexterity excercises, coupled with observation at the Dental Clinic, aids the
student to better realize what a future in dentistry entails. .

The Dental Science Club is open to all students and meetings are held every other Wednesday evening on Campus.

University administration and dedicates itself to serving stu-
dents.

One of the primary goals of SGB '78 is to increase awareness
of Student Government and to encourage input from all inter-
ested undergraduates.

Student Government is an excellent opportunity to get in-
volved in University affairs. It actively utilizes both financial
and human resources in areas of services, social activities,
academic reform and campus improvement.

There are ten standing committeesgof Student Government
to help the Board serve students more effectively. They are all
open to any full time undergraduate who is willing to contribute
some time and enthusiam. The Student Government office is
located at 305 Student Union or call 624-5920.

voice of the University of Pittsburgh students living in
the Residence Halls. Created by students for students,

the RSA exists to help provide an atmosphere conducive
to individual and group experiences for the 3556 students

living in the eight campus residence halls.

As important as any other aspect of RSA is the main-
tenance of an open channel of communication with the
Office of Residence Life. Recommendations for the re-

vision of housing policies and rules, dialogue on areas of
general student concerns and a mutual striving for an
ever improving living environment is a major objective of

the RSA.

The Residence Hall Councils are composed of elected

officers and floor representatives from each floor in the

respective residence hall. The councils meet regularly to
discuss and resolve pertinent problems arising from
group living within that residence, to promote general
welfare of the students living in residence, to enact and
enforce regulations within the hall, and to improve stu-
dent activities within the hall.

For over fifty years the Choral
Ensemble has been a major en-
semble group on the Pitt campus
and being the only female voice
choir, it offers opportunities

 

which the other singing ensembles can’t match. lts forty female members, under the leadership of Dr. A. Thomas

Caruso, are afforded a great learning experience in mastering proper singing technique while learning about and sing-
ing songs from Mozart's "Requin", to Simon and Garfunkel's "Parsley and Sage, Rosemary and Tyme". Then, Through
concerts and several tours per year, all the work and preparation pays off. Not only are the performances fun to give
but on tour, their are more good times. All in all, it’s a group that learns but gives you the opportunity to have fun
meeting many people and visiting many different places.

MOYE RESIGNS FOR WASHINGTON POST

Pitt lost a fine administrator when Alfred Leon Moye resigned as
Vice—Chancellor of Student Affairs for a position in Jimmy Carter's
administration this year. Moye is now the Deputy Coininisioner for
Higher and Continuing Education at the Department of Health. Educa
tion and Welfare in Washington D.C.

A native of Maryland. Moye went to West Virginia Wesleyan Col’
lege where he received a BS. in chemistry. He came to Pittsburgh in
I968 as an assistant professor in chemistry. Moye received his doc—
torate in l97|. ln I972 he became Dean of Student Affairs and in I973
was appointed Vice»Chance||or of Student Affairs where he remained
until his Washington appointment.

As Deputy Commisioner he will be performing many of the same
activities as at Pitt. He will work with the Special student Services.
the agency for evaluating and accrediting post—secondary schools.
managing higher education monetary sources and meeting with college
presidents.

As deputy commissioner he hopes to take initiative in giving colleges
global perspective. Moye said. "The average student has no knowledge
or respect for other cultures. The United States cannot afford this
isolationist's attitudes as the world is becoming more interdependent."
He added that he will try to formulate programs that will provide an
encompassment of all cultures. "For example," he explained, "Why not
offer comparative psychology of Russia and United States?"

"There is more ethnic interest in Pittsburgh than any other place I
have been to." Dr. Moye said. "But. the ethnicity is not translated into
the education."

Other advice to the Pitt Campus? "Pitt has to get rid of its ‘Poor
Boy Image’ around Pittsburgh. It is more appreciated outside Pitts-
burgh than in its own area. Pitt has a unique mission —— 60-70 percent
of its student body is first generation college kids."

On a more general basis Moye advised students "to educate him or

24

herself for the last job rather than the first. Many times a student Wlll
not keep the first job after graduation." Citing himself as an example
Dr. Moye said he will not return to a career in chemistry because his

knowledge of it is now obsolete. "However. chemistry has helped me
solve problems. I approach them in the same logical way I solved

chemistry problems."

Since Dr. Moye's '73 Vice—Chance||or appointment Moye feels one
of his more important accomplishments at Pitt is computerizing the
Student Job Placement Service. "A student had to get up at 5:00
A.M. in order to stand in line for an appointment. Now a student can
register on the computer terminal and use video tape machines to find
a job after graduation."

Dr. Moye also helped develop a learning Skills Center that now
offers courses in everything from remedial or speed reading to l-acing
Finals fearlessly.

"We had a Veterans’ Affairs Office three years before the Federal
government gave funds for it." he said. "It is now part of the Special
Services office."

"We also established a health fee that bettered the Student Health
Service. We moved the off—campus housing office to Forbes Avenue.
an off~campus area. The InternationalStudents Service now has three
or four sub-groups. And the jucical system. which is constantly re-
fining. is the first in the country for establishing the rights and respon—
sibilities of faculty and students."

"I am proud of every single division in this office." Dr. Moye said.
broadly smiling. "Everyone accepted more work for less money. The
office has been re—trenched in three years."

Dr. Moye's Vice-Chancellor position will be open for one year if he
decides to return. If he stays in Washington DC. HEW may see as
many positive, progressive and swift advances coming from Alfred
Moye as Pitt has.

Heinz Chapel Choir-

The Heinz Chapel Choir has

C. Work. For the Fall of I977
Concert, held in the Heinz

Yes, folks, there is a YMCA at Pitt. No, it doesn't have a swimming pool. What can it possibly do, then?
Well, it happens that the Pitt/Oakland YMCA is one of the most important links between Pitt and the com-
munity! For example, its "Project LINK” (Let’s Involve Neighborhood Kids) has Pitt students leading kids’ club
groups in Oakland and Bloomfield — and bridging gaps between students and community folks. The same
true for big brothers, big sisters — in over thirty student-led projects Pitt volunteers get out into the "real
world'_' and get that priceless ingredient in education - experience!

That's what the Y offered over l.|O0 Pitt student volunteers last year — life experience and career experi-
ence, relating to people and creating goodwill for Pitt! By the way, it was fun, as may be noted from the
groups of crazies in these pictures!

Omicron Delta Kappa, the National Leadership Honor Society, was founded December 3, l9l4, at Washington and
Lee University. Lexington, Virginia, by fifteen student and faculty leaders. In the tradition of the idealism and leader-
ship of George Washington and Robert E. Lee. the founders formulated the idea that leadership of exceptional quality
and versatility in college should be recognized, that representatives in all phases of college life should cooperate in
worthwhile endeavor, and that outstanding students, faculty and administration members should meet on a basis of
mutual interest. understanding, and helpfulness.

The motives which guided the founders sprang from a desire to bring together in one body for the general good of
the institution all leaders in the various phases of college life. They were convinced that such an honor society, prop-
erly conducted. would offer maximum opportunities and experiences in cooperative effort for more effective leader-
ship and service in the purposes, interests and needs of the institution, and for the maintenance and improvement of
the unity and democracy of learning and citizenship responsibilities.

At the University of Pittsburgh, the Gamma circle of Omicron Delta Kappa strives to serve, both its members and
the University community as a whole. Two of this year's many successful activities included the Second Annual Lead-
ership Workshop at which student representatives from ogler 50 student organizations were present, and a testimonial
dinner to honor our Chancellor, Dr. Wesley W. Posvar, in his tenth year as both chancellor of the University and as a
member of Omicron Delta Kappa.

ALDHA IEDSILDN DELTA

Alpha Epsilon Delta, the International Premedical Honor Society was formed by fifteen premedical students on April
28, I926 at the University of Alabama. Today, Alpha Epsilon Delta is the world's largest body devoted to premedical
education with membership exceeding 50,000. There presently are I27 chapters at colleges and universities throughout
the United States and Canada.

Membership in Alpha Epsilon Delta is an honor bestowed upon a student by fellow students in recognition of superior
scholastic achievement. Completion of at least three terms of premedical work with a scholastic standing of 3.3 on a
4.0 scale are the minimum requirements for active membership. Character, general ability and personality are also
carefully considered in the selection of every member. Alpha Epsilon Delta serves to encourage and recognize scho-

T lastic excellence among premedical students, provides activities for the intellectual development of individual mem-

   

bers and provides a program of service to the campus benefitting non—members as well as members.

At the University of Pittsburgh, the Pennsylvania Gamma chapter holds meetings of interest to premedical students
as part of its chapter activities. This year our chapter's endeavors included the revision of our state—wide distributed
pamphlet entitled "Hints to the Pre-Med," and the First Annual Pre—Medica| Conference which was held in the Kurtzman
and Ballrooms of the Student Union. Important services performed by the chapter included a Bingo Party at Children's
Hospital and an opportunity for both members and non—members to view surgery in the domes at Presbyterian-Uni-
versity Hospital.

"Students First, Handicapped Second”

Tom Galante. coordinator of Disabled Student Services, can be found in Room 5|7 of the Student Union (Schenley Hall).
or at 624-6738.

"A handicapped student is not really different from any other student in most respects. He or she has the same prob-
lems, the same joys and fears as anyone else, but his or her disability is one more factor that each has to consider along
with everything else."

"Our office is geared to make the student more independent rather than cause a dependency. We want to integrate
the students into the University as much as possible."

"Our first priority is to make all of our academic facilities accessible to the students. Our office provides assistance
with any problems the student may encounter form the beginning of the admissions process through the entire length
of the student's graduate or undergraduate work. Our aim is to provide supportive services for the students' and to en-
courage each man or woman to become active in all other aspects of the University as much as possible. We are students
first. handicapped second. Our services are furnished on an individual basis. All of our services are geared to the stu-
dents’ individual and special needs to help solve their problems."

We will assist the student with housing. help them to find readers or personal attendants. We work with volunteer
groups who do recording for blind students. We refer students with academic problems to work with the Learning Skills
Center. located in Room 5OOSchen|ey Hall. We work with people in the Counseling Center in Schenley Hall for any student
who needs help in career development or has problems with psychological adiustment.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of I973 prohibits discrimination against handicapped people. When a person has
a problem we work with the student and teacher to make sure that the student is not discriminated against.

The Office of New Student Programs designs the Orientation
Programs to provide the new student with an opportunity to examine
the various programs, service and activities available at the
University. The program is constantly undergoing revision to meet
the specific needs of each incoming group of new students.

The largest aspect of the program is the Freshman Orientation
Session during the summer The ongoing concept of Orientation
is then carried out by the Mentors and office staff throughout the
academic year by providing various support services and activities
that complement the Freshman year. Programs in September and
January are designed specifically for students relocating from
other schools. An additional program for regional campus students
is provided in October and March on days when these students
come to the Oakland campus to register for classes.

The Mentor Program is a major part of New Student Programs.
The Mentors are a volunteer group of upperclassmen who
facilitate and implement not only the Orientation Program but
all other programs for the Office. They function in the capacity of a
friend. a peer counselor. and as an information»referra| person to
provide the new students vital information on academic and social
programs, student organizations, and University services and
facilities.

TIITIE GDE5 BY

Rick- It's no kind of life for you. You don't deserve studying umil ILLXW and then
prowling the bars until 3:00. You're made for better stuff than brawls at the De—
cade. free drinks at C}. Barneys. The Halloween Disco at Zelda's. Remember we
dressed like little kids?

 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  

Ginger— No. Rick, no. Stop!
(EXTRA GIRL THROWS A BEER IN HER DATE's FACE. GINGER LOOKS SICKENED)
Rick— Maybe not today but maybe tomorrow or a month from tomorrow you're go—

mg to regret staying with me. Kid. sooner or later you're going to regret this de—
eision. Get on the phone. call a cab and get out of here.

RIVES.)

Cabbie~ Where to. lady?

Ginger» The airport. I must get to New York before I
lose my iob.

(RICK OPENS THE DOOR FOR HER. CHUCKS HER
UNDER THE CHIN AND \X/INKS)

Rick- Goodbye. kid. (SHUTS DOOR)
(STRAGGLY STUDENT APPROACHES RICK)
Student— Say. aren't you my R.A.?

Rick— That's right, you're Louis from I904.
Louis— Can I buy you a drink?

(THE CAR TAKES OH)

Rick— Sure.

Louis— Rick. this could be the beginning of a beautiful
ficndship.

Rick— That's my line, Lou-..
Louis- Sorry. I‘m a freshman.

by Karen Kadilak

With the ball on the Notre Dame I2-yard line, Pitt Panther
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh surveyed the Fighting Irish de-
fense and barked signals.

Cavanaugh took the snap from the center, back-pedaled,
and finding none of his receivers open, scrambled to his right,
where he found Gordon Jones alone in the left corner of the
end zone. Cavanaugh, an All-American and Heisman Trophy
candidate, lofted a pass to Jones, who caught it for an easy six
points.

However, while the crowd celebrated, Cavanaugh, tackled
on the play by huge Notre Dame defensive end Willie Fry, ran
off the field, clutching his left wrist. which was broken on the
play.

As the crowd feared, Pitt wasn't the same that afternoon.
With Wayne Adams and Tom Yewcic calling the signals, Pitt
couldn't get its offense untracked.

Cavanaugh’s touchdown pass to Jones was the only Pitt M
touchdown in the game as Notre Dame won I9-9 and went on
to win the national championship.

Things perked up the next week, when Rick Trocano, a
sturdy freshman, quarterbacked the Panthers to a win over
William and Mary in overcast weather at Pitt Stadium. The
rusty-haired freshman also lead the Panthers to one-sided
wins over Temple and Boston College.

After a month's layoff, Cavanaugh returned to play against
Florida but had a hard time pitching the ball out on the option
which hampered the Pitt offense. The Panthers forged out a
l7—l7 tie with the explosive Gators.

Cavanaugh found things not so difficult in the next month
or'so as he led the Panthers to consecutive wins over Navy.
Syracuse, Tulane, West Virginia and Army.

QUARTERBACKS:

When quarterback Matt Cavanaugh found him-
.self on the wrong end of a Willie Fry forearm in
Pitt's season opener against Notre Dame, the
Panthers’ chances at the second straight national
championship(as well as Cavanaugh's Heisman Trophy
aspirations) were sidelined.

Cavanaugh's broken left wrist. coupled with
disastrous backup attempts by coach Jackie
Sherril|'s quarterback reserves (freshman Wayne
Adams and the previous year's savior, Tom Yewcik)
contributed to a I9-9 loss to the Irish and alluded
to a fear Sherrill hinted at all preseason; If Pitt
were to lose Matt Cavanaugh, it would become a
very ordinary team.

Waiting patiently, however was freshman Rick
Trocano, who led Pitt to three straight wins, wins
in which the Panthers scored 28, 76, and 45 points.
Trocano with occasional help from Lindsay Delaney
(four for six on the year with two touchdowns
passes of more than 30 yards), smothered popular
doubt about Pitt's quarterback situation long enough
for Cavanaugh’s wrist to heal.

At seasons end. Sherril|’s "very ordinary" team
(eventually ranked seventh by UPI. eighth by AP)
had a I977 season record of 9-2—|, including a 34-3
Gator Bowl trampling of Clemson.

Which brings us back to Cavanaugh. who per-
formed in that Jacksonville classic in the manner
in which his Heisman campaigners knew he could
have played all year long, barring injury: Twenty-
three completions in 36 attempts for a Gator Bowl
record 387 yards, four touchdown strikes and I5
additional yards rushing, the latter providing him
with yet another Gator Bowl mark—402 total offensive
yards.

"And he's still not healthy," Sherrill said after
the game. "I shudder to think what he could have
done had he stayed healthy".

Cavanaugh. The nations top quarterback in I977
capped his collegiate career with four post-
season honors(including All-America) for a year in
which he amassed the highest average gain per
pass play in the country.

RB's and RECEIVERS

Jackie Sherrill knew from day one of Spring camp how to
win football games during the upcoming I977 season:
coming I977 season:

"We have to get the ball to people in the skilled positions,"
he said.

The Panther offense was able to do just that and while
such players as all-Americans Gordon Jones and Elliot
Walker were scampering downfield with the pigskin, Pitt
was winning in bunches.

Walker. whose 59 average and l) touchdown sprints led
the team, collected L025 yards. That put him in a category
with Tony Dorsett — the only two Pitt runners to gain |.000
yards in a single season.

Another feather in Walkers headgear was his placement
on Pitt's all time rushing list; in only the third game of
l977 (against Temple), Walker passed Marshall Goldberg,
the former number two man.

Jones, for his part, was never second to anyone. The
junior's 45 receptions. including grabs that defied gravity,
793 receiving yards and nine scores topped Pitt's pass-
catching list in I977.

The latter two totals represent all-time season highs for
a Panther.

Pitt's "Too Much" Jones wasn't without ample comple-
ment; Steve Gaustad (SI catches for 5|4 yards and one
score) Randy Reutershan (|7—3||—2). Walker (l6—242—3),
Willie Taylor (|5~308—4), Fred Jacobs (8-I334). Larry Sims
(2—|7—0), Benjie Pryor (3—42—|), and JoJo Heath (|—7—0) all
contributed to one of the most explosive offensive units
in the country. (428 points)

As to the running corps, led by Walker and Jacob's
5.6 average. the Panther backfield ground out 2,388 net
yards with‘ reserve help from Sims (5.7), Artell Hawkins
(7.7). Ray "Rooster" Jones (2.9), Steve Harris (3.9) and
Heath (4.2)

Fast Freddie Jacobs picked up the longest run from
scrimmage in I977 (56 yards versus Boston College) and
pulled down the longest pass play—a 58 yarder against
Syracuse.

OFFENSIVE LINE:

Sport's most thankless job — that of
working in the "pits" as the offensive line
is appropriately named — nets little praise
but, when done to perfection results in high
numbers on the football scoreboard.

Pitt's offensive front knew much about
scoring points in I977. Led by the blocking
expertise of al|—American Tom Brzoza -
who made a hurried preseason switch from
guard to center — and Matt Carroll, the
Panther offensive line played a major role
in making Pitt's I977 offense one of the
most potent in the school’s history.

Brzoza, Carroll, Art Bortnick, Jim Buoy.
Walt Brown, Mark May and George Link
opened holes in the defensive front or held
back oncoming defenders long enough for
a Panther runner to dart through or for
Matt Cavanaugh or Rick Trocano to find an
open receiver.

In a rare display of recognition for an
offensive lineman, junior center Walt
Brown, said by Coach Jackie Sherrill to be
the finest deep snapper in the land, was
awarded a game ball by his teammates for
filling in admirably for an ailing Brzoza
in the Navy game.

A fitting sentiment for a member of an
offensive unit that did its job well in I977.

SPECIAL TEAMS:

The graduation of Larry Swider and Carson Long. the
leaders of Pitt’s kicking attack during the four previous
seasons, put the Panthers’ I977 kicking game in question.

To fill the punting void, coach Jackie Sherrill offered
freshman Joe Gasparovic. who quickly erased all memory of
Swider's booming spirals. In the opener against the Notre
Dame, Gasparovic took full advantage of the lrish receivers
insistence upon playing shallow and repeatedly booted the
football over their heads.

Gasparovic kicked 50times in i977 and posted a 40.9 yard
average including a 62 yard blast against West Virginia.

Replacing the NCAA record breaker Long was to pose a
bigger problem for Sherrill. who had freshman Dave Trout
and an eager Mark Schubert to choose from.

Schubert, a two year veteran. was the heir apparent to
Long's iob before Trout came to training camp with a
stronger leg. Both kickers showed preseason determination
to win the starting berth, and each had different talents —-~
Schubert had the high short rangeaccuracy skills. and Trout
was better equiped to handle the lower distance shots.

As a result, Sherrill decided to use four feet to fill Long's
kicking shoes; Trout kicked off and was used in long field
goal situations. while Schubert's leg took care of the extra
point and shorter field goal attempts.

Sherri|l's policy proved successful. Schubert converted 4|
of 43 extra point tries and was 8—for-IO in the field goal
department. Trout. whose over the end-zone kicks dis-
couraged many Panther opponents. finished i977 with two
field goals in eight attempts and contributed ll of l3 PAT's.

Pitt's specialty team excellence didn't end with its
kickers. The "kamikaze" (Kick coverage) squad —~ led by
Ray "Rooster" Jones. Scott McKeel, Randy Reutershan and
Glenn Meyer r— and the kick returners JoJo Heath and
Gordon Jones also took part in the overall kicking game.

Jones returned Pitt's longest punt 84 yards against Temple
in the same flourescent manner in which he returned Pitt's

longest kickoff of I977 — a 93 yarder against Army.

DEFENSIVE LINE;

Awesome for the most part(and merely
impressive on off days), Pitt's defensive line was
perhaps the team's strongest unit in I977.

A national television audience saw and
believed just that on opening day against
Notre Dame. While the Panther offense often
did well merely to hold on to the football, the
defense, spearheaded by the front line and mid-
dle guard Dave Logan especially. terminated
countless Irish possessions and nearly managed
to capture a victory single—handed|y.

Logan's efforts against Notre Dame were in
vain. but Pitt linemen shone as heroes through-
out the year in winning causes as well. One
such star was Randy Holloway. who attained
more post season attention(I| honors. including
A||—America) than any other Panther. His nine
quarterback sacks were second best on the team.
as were his 88 tackles.

And if Holloway wasn't enough. opposing
offenses had Hugh Green to contend with.
Green, Pitt's only freshman a|l—American in
I977. led the team with a dozen sacks and
tied Holloway in the tackle department.

"I don't think there was a better freshman
in the country than Hugh Green." said coach
Jackie Sherrill. ''If there was I'd like to see him."

Holloway. Logan, and Green weren't alone in
their harrassment of quarterbacks. running
backs, ect. Dave DiCiccio. Gary Silvestri. Greg
Meisner. Ricky Jackson Mike Lemosky, Bill Neil.
Jerry Boyarsky. Jim Marnich. Steve Fedell
and Bob Gruber helped greatly as the Panther
defensive front became one of the most
respected in the nation.

DEFENSIVE BACKS.-

The Panthers defensive secondary had
nothing to prove in I977. After displaying
itself as the best in the country the year
before during Pitt's championship season, the
unit returned intact for another successful

campaign.

The nucleus of that secondary comprised
junior safety Jeff Delaney. senior corner—
backs LeRoy Felder and J.C. Wilson and all-
American free safety Bob Jury; backups in-
cluded Mike Balzer (a starter for any other

team), Willie Marsh and Carlton Williamson.

Of 26 Panthers interceptions, Jury grabbed
eight to lead the team and finish his career
as Pitt's all-time leader in that department.

The linebacking squadron of Al Chesley.
Jeff Pelusi, Desmond Robinson and Steve
Clemons carried its share of the defensive
load. Ches|ey's I34 tackles lead the team by
far. while Pe|usi’s total of 79 was third best;
also, each added an interception to highlight
his seasonal efforts.

COACH:
Jackie Sherrill had an easy job to do in I977. All

‘ that was expected of him as Pitt's head football

coach was defend a national title and keep his
predecessors (Jonny Majors’) successful football
rolling.

Though he didn't repeat a national champion-
ship, Sherrill — Pitt's 28th head coach — guided
his Panthers to a 9—2—l record and a Top IO rank-
ing in each of the wire services. The nine vic-
tories marked only the fourth time in 40 years
a Panther team finished with as many wins, and
it gave Sherrill the distinction of being the second
Pitt skipper ever to win nine times in his initial
season.

Sherri|l's success was directly linked to his
recruiting finesse. Despite accepting the Pitt job
well into the recruiting season (mid—January),
Sherrill, who, as an assistant under Majors, was
mainly responsible for bringing Tony Dorsett to
the Cathedral in I972. netted one of the highest
ranked freshman crops in the country.

Those freshmen blended nicely with the re-
turning players, many of whom Sherrill helped
recruit, to sustain a winning atmosphere, even
in such adversity as during the absence of Matt
Cavanaugh.

Sherrill wasn't without his critics, however.
Pitt was only I) points removed from a second
straight undefeated season, and many cited the
three non—wins as an inability to beat the "good"
teams.

That myth came to an impudent end in Jack-
sonville where Sherrills Panthers destroyed |0th
ranked Clemson 34-3, to become the Gator Bowl
Champions.

All told, Sherrill contributed much to a growing
football program — the winningest major college
program through I976-I977 seasons with a 2|-2—|
slate.

As the architect of any fine
rollercoaster will attest, the
best climax to a ride is one that
leaves the people breathless.
The Pitt water polo team
thrilled its fans with an on-
again, off—again season that
ended with a 2|-20 sudden
death overtime defeat at the
hands of Bucknell in the finals
of the Eastern championships.
The poloists, ranked eighth

in the nation in l976, finished
the I977 season with a |8—7 rec-
ord; the championship of the
Mid-Atlantic Conference, and
second place in the Eastern
championships.

After a slow start that found
the Panthers third in the con-
ference, coach Miguel Rivera
brought his team back to win
eight of its last nine to give Pitt
a record of 37-IO over the last
two years.

The Panthers placed six
members of the squad on the
all-East team, as Barry Ford,
Mike Mere, Jorge Machicote.
Papa Ruiz, Butch Silva and Luis
Toro were selected. Machi-
cote. the team's leading scorer
with 97 points (76 goals), was
named the Most Valuable Play-
er in the Eastern champion~
ships.

Pitt will lose no one to grad-
uation this year and coupled
with the fact that goalie Steve
Feller has a year of experience
behind him, the poloists should
remain the number two fall
sport at the University for sea-
sons to come.

By Bob Labriola

The I977 Pitt basketball team resembled in many ways the "little girl with the little curl", the subject
of a popular children's nursery rhyme. One of the descriptions of the girl offered by the verse is that
"when she was good, she was very, very good, but when she was bad. she was horrid.

"Horrid" is a suitable adjective to describe the Panthers performance in an opening game loss to Mor-
ris Harvey. while "very, very good" was exactly the type of game necessary to defeat teams the caliber
of Maryland and Syracuse. On the heels of a 6—2| record. the Panthers went through a season of peaks and
valleys (|6»ll) that. if nothing else. kept Pitt students in their Field House seats until the final buzzer.

Winners in six of the first IO games. including a I-0 record in Eastern Eight play, Pitt played giveaway in
its next two games. against George Washington and Temple. George Washington managed to beat the
Panthers, 73—7l. Even though the Colonials were only in the lead for one second. it happened to be the last
second of the game. Temple rose from the dead twice to top Pitt in double overtime. In each instance,
Panther turnovers late in the game were the fatal blows.

Within a matter of days, Pitt shot Syracuse down from its lofty national ranking by stunning the Or-
angemen. 86—8l. behind 30 points from senior Larry Harris. The 6-6 forward finished his career with l,9|4
points, surpassing Don Hennon as Pitt's al|—time scoring leader. Harris, whose calling card was a 20foot
jumper from anywhere, finished the season with a 20.6 scoring average and was "the man" whenever the
Panthers needed a crucial basket.

Pitt was charitable again in a game against Cincinnati. failing to convert one-and~one free throw op-
portunites that would have iced the game, and lost in overtime. 87-80. Coach Tim Grgurich was learning

that playing well enough to win was often not
sufficient.

Pitt reeled off three victories in a row before being
swept out of the Civic Arena by Duquesne. 88-66.
The Dukes employed a box—and—one defense on Harris.
and the Panthers were no more dangerous than a
bunch of Kittens without claws. The Panthers quickly
grew fangs after the debacle and recorded wins over
West Virginia in Morgantown and over Maryland and
Lefty Driesell.

Just when it appeared Pitt was prepared to make a

     
  
 

move on the rest of the Eastern Eight. the
Panthers lost another overtime game, 75-68.
to Penn State at the Field House. This was
the same team Pitt blasted in University
Park. 8265. less than three weeks prior to
this defeat.

The end of the season brought more sat-
isfying victories. but also the most heart-
breaking defeat. Regular season wins over
Villanove (possibly the Panthers finest
hour). Duquesne and an opening Eastern
Eight tournament victory over George
Washington were replaced in many fans’
minds by the final loss of the season to
Villanove.

With Pitt in possession of the ball and the
score tied in the final seconds of the game,
referee Mickey Crowley whistled Wayne
Williams for an offensive foul (the game films disagree). Wildcat guard Rory Sparrow climaxed
the tragic finale with a jumper at the buzzer. and the Panthers’ season was over. Hope for the
future springs eternal, however. resting largely in the muscular shoulders of Sam Clancy. With
every slam dunk and blocked shot, Clancy established himself as one of the premier freshmen
in college basketball and as a potential star for the remainder of his career.

Other highlights of the season included Williams performing well at point guard. his third
different position since high school; Pete Strickland regularly turning in performances border-
ing on the unbelievable coming off the bench; Ed Scheuermann's showing against the Terrapins.
and Grgurich's emergence as a force to be reckoned with at the end of the bench.

Before a child becomes a mature adult. he must go through an awkward stage known as adolescence. With a little more time to mature. the Pitt bas-
ketball team should be ready to take its place among the elite of college basketball.

Living in a day and age where bills
such as the Equal Rights Amendment
and Title IX (the bill that allows women
participation in separate but equal,
sports programs) have been passed,
more people have grown accustomed
to the idea of women competing in or-
ganized sports programs.

Those who once thought the idea of
women running around and dribbling
a basketball in baggy gym trunks and
high-topped tennis shoes, asburd are
becoming rare. Attendance figures are
up at women’s sporting events through-
out the country. While these figures
continue to climb, records also show
that more money is being pumped into
such women’s athletic programs every
year.

Paraphrasing a well-known football
coach, the future is now as far as wo-
men's sports is concerned. Policies
made today will have an effect on what
women's sports will be in the future,
just as measures passed a ha|f—a-
decade ago have touched women’s
sports in some shape today. Pitt assist-
ant athletic director for women’s
‘sports, Sandra Bullman, remembered
when it was difficult for women’s ath-
letics to get its collective feet off the
ground at Pitt. As little as five years
ago, the entire women’s athletic budget
at Pitt was a miniscule $|0,000-peanuts
even in those days when candy bars
were only a dime.

With such little money to work with.
administrative personnel was limited
in the truest sense of the word. "I
was the administrative personnel,”

Bullman recalled with a chuckle. "I
coached a couple of sports. Handled
things in the office. Got things togeth-

er. It was tough, but I felt it was some-
thing I had to do to get women's sports
going in the right direction here (at
Pitt).” There were hundreds of wo-
men who shared Bu|lman's sense of
direction and purpose. Because of their
efforts, today. women’s athletic organ-
izations such as the Association of In-
tercollegiate Athletics for Women
(AlA\X/) have been established to set
forth the goals and functions of wo-
men's sports programs on both a high
school and college level. "The future
of women’s sports is open," said Bull-
man, who today oversees a five-person
administrative staff and eight-team
program at Pitt. “I'm not saying we're
on an equal level with men's athletic
programs. They have had a signifi-
cant head start on us in terms of
years.” "But then again, neither is it
our purpose to compete with men,"
Bullman continued. "We just want to
provide young women with athletic
ability a program to encourage them
to use whatever talent they might
have.”

"The future is bright," Bullman con-
cluded. lt's bright because of people
like Sandra Bullman. Thanks to her and
the other hundreds of women who had
a similar amount of perserverance and
vision, women’s sports today are grow-
ing, but definitely not gone.

Presently celebrating its Golden Anniversary. The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh at Johnstown was founded in I927 as one
of the first regional campuses of an urban university in the
United States. It was originally located in the city of Johns
town 80 miles east of Pittsburgh. ln I967. UPJ was moved to a
tract of woodlands in Richland Township, just outside the
city of Johnstown. Situated on 635 acres of the picturesque
Laurel Highlands, the new campus is convenient to shopping
and cultural activities of the area, but far enough removed to
provide an environment conductive to study and con-
templation.

ln November of l97|, UPJ was formally designated a four
year degree—granting college of the University of Pittsburgh
and now offers degree programs in humanities, American
studies, English and American literature. iournalism, speech
communications, theatre, speech/theatre. writing, natural
sciences, economics, history. politics and government.
sociology. business 8 economics, education and engineering
technology. Most students complete their undergraduate
degrees at UPJ, but also retain the option of transferring to
the University of Pittsburgh Oakland Campus after two
years. The situation is unique and has afforded UPJ the
dual advantage of drawing upon the institutional resources of
the Pitt system, while offering the advantages of a small-
college environment.

The UPJ $22 million complex comprises 20 buildings
(including the new|y—constructed $l.3 million Sports
Center). all completed since I966, offering the finest

 

 

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

in classroom, laboratory, living and extracurricular
facilities to UPJ's 2.300 full-time and 700 part—time
students-both resident and commuter.

The UPJ campus boasts a variety of recreational facilities.
including six tennis courts. soccer and baseball fields,
numerous outdoor basketball courts. nature trails. iogging
and cross—country course, a student union/gymnasium. and
the multi—purpose Sports Center. Resident students live
either in one of the five residence halls or in the six-
building Manor townhouse complex or the five new Lodge
group apartments.

Additional information concerning the UPJ campus and/or
programs may be obtained by contacting the Office of Ad—

town, Johnstown. PA l5904; telephone 8|4/)66—966l.
