J. Byron, who drew the invigorating at1nos—
phere of this life for the first time at .\'Iasontown_.
Pa., on November 13, 1882. His name, tho’ not
appropriate to his profession. bids fair to become
famous as one skilled in the alleviation of that
which his name suggests. Of small stature, he
made his presence felt by the. energy with which
he planted his os—calcis. He is also known by his
eating proclivities.

roller. He also has patents pending for a boltless
ﬂask of his own designing. \’Ve all wish him suc—
cess.

Harrisville, Pa.

“He is simply the rarest man in the world.”

J. Lawrence opened his eyes for the first time
in the peaceful, not-on—the—map village of Harris-
ville on January 6, 1882. We know not why the
schools, banks and polls do not close on this day,
but suppose it is just an oversight. He has al-
ways been famous for the readiness with which
he can answer questions from the professors, al-
tho Dr. Miller is an exception.

WILLIS H. BEEBE ‘P9

“The world knows nothing of its greatest men.”

He went thru the Dawson public schools. He is
one of our Benedicts and has a son who bids fair
to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious “dad,"
as he talks of “insters" bones and joints with the
precision of a professional man.

RAY MORRIS CLOVIS 9NE—‘W
Mt. Morris, Pa.

“Can such things be?”

“Clovis, called “Green Co” by some. He re-
ceived his early training by absorbing knowledge
from the teachers of the Mt. Morris High School.
Before entering his professional career he was a
blacksmith, and judging from his dental work he
must have been an adept with the hammer and
tongs, as his work is always of the neatest.

coming into this world on the same day. Before

around Freeport in the capacity of a tin—smith
and a slate roofer—“that’s one on the house.” He
has made himself agreeable by his friendly “good
morning.”

JOHN C. GRAYSON FITZHUGH A313
Eagle Wood, Va.

“Few men have my ability.”

John C. Grayson was born at Eagle \7Vood, Va
He attended school at the Culpepper Court House
High School. His occupation, in connection with
tilling the soil, was the breaking of unruly thoro-
breds, and claims never to have met his con-
queror in the equine family. He has worked for
the B. & O. R. R. Co. at McKeesport in addi-
tion to going to the University. We hope his
efforts will be crowned by the success he deserves.

the Rowe College at Johnstown, from which he
graduated in 1902. After completing his Fresh-
man year at tl1e University of Pennsylvania, he
joined us in our Junior year. Although he claims
Johnstown, Pa., as his home, it may be seen at a
glance at the above date of birth that he was not
there “before the ﬂood.”

J. GLENN HUMPHREY,

“A passing show-—without much to show.”

Mr. Humphrey started on life’s way October 2.
1882. He received his education at the Slippery

der the most adverse circumstances; is a “grad”
of the New Bethlehem High School. He also
belongs to the “Don’t Worry Club,” and looks
on the strenuous side of college life with a smile
of placid indifference. He could, as Dr. M<:Curdy
says, “absorb more with less exertion than any-
one else in the class.”

CHARLES L. JOHNS ‘P9
Pittsburgh, Pa.
“By outward show lets not be cheated.”

The Beau Brumniell of the class claims Wi11e-
biddle avenue, E. E., as his home. He is known
as a “good fellow,” but owing to the numerous
duties of this life (outside of school) he rarely
has time to attend to the trivial affairs demanding
his attention at school. He makes himself agree-
able to all by his pleasing manner and earnest
solicitude for your welfare.

BENJAMIN F. JENKINS ‘1’9—9NE

Grove City High School, graduating in 1898. At-
tended the business department of Grove City

have a special escort from the ﬁeld.

FRED R. LA VIER ‘1’9—9N2
Wilmerding, Pa.

“My heart will ever love so long as there are
women.”

Is the original of the accompanying half tone.
He began battle for existence on June 14, 1880,
at Franklin, Pa. He received his education at the
above mentioned place. He says he is not married
but just as happy and has just as good a time as
people who are perfectly sane, which may have
to be taken with a pinch of salt by some of our
beami.ng—faced benedicts. “Fritz” is a Very ef-
ﬁcient eomniitteeman, as he usually makes his
wishes known. ‘

O. GUY LATSHAW ‘W

guiled the freshmen following us to part with a

“lien” took his first peep at this world on the
morning of June 16, 1877, in the well known town.
of Butler, Pa. As he stands about 6 feet 3 he has
been dubbed “Longfellow.” He is a fellow of few
words and usually makes his presence felt more
by the power of his looks than by the use of
words. As he comes from a family of dentists
and is a good mechanic himself, we have hopes.

R. BANKS PEARCE ‘P9
Saltsburg, Pa.

“Aye, sir, a mystery.”

Pearce has never revealed his past. so the au-
tl1or will have to write from hearsay. His father
being‘ a dentist gave him an early taste for the
profession. “l.7oxy" is the author of many puns
which usually bring out the ludicrous side of any
situation. He is another of our benedicts.

HAROLD CHAPMAN STEVENSON 435

«$780 E1334

The class of Nineteen Hundred and Seven of the Western University of
Pennsylvania, deeming it ﬁtting that the chronicles of the institution should
be embodied and preserved in: some lasting form, determined upon the estab-
lishment of an annual publication to ﬁll a neglected place in the University
life. It is with sanguine hopes and no little trepidation that the editors are
now prepared to introduce the new Annual to the friends of the University.
We have labored long and earnestly to produce a book worthy of the Uni-
versity and of our class. The success or failure of the work will doubtless
be evidenced by its reception. In the one case we expect no eulogy. In the
other we beg no sympathy. We hope for the “Owl,” that it may prove of in-
terest to all, afford amusement to some and be a source of offense to none.

DEDICATION.

As the history of a nation, so the history of a great public institution is
embodied in the lives of its great men. A strong alumni body is both founda-
tion and reserve power for a university, and thus with a realization of the
noble office which our alumni have ﬁlled in: the history of the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, recognizing the dignity thus gained for their infant
publication, the editors of the “Owl” respectfully dedicate their maiden effort
to the oldest living alumnus of the University and one who has ever had its
best interests at heart,

HONORABLE THOMAS MELLON.

The subject of this sketch is one of the oldest and best known citizens of
Pittsburgh. He was born February 3, 1813, at Camp Hill, County Tyrone,
Ireland, and when ﬁve years old accompanied his parents to America, settling
in Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania. From that time until he was twenty
years old he lived upon the farm, working in summer, studying in winter,
and by his fondness for study making it clear that he should enter some profes-
sion rather than remain upon the farm. Accordingly he was sent to the Classi-
cal School at Monroeville, Allegheny county, conducted by the Rev. Jonathan
Gill, and later matriculated in the Western University of Pennsylvania, then
situated on Third street, Pittsburgh. Here he graduated in the class of 1837.
Two years before his graduation he began to read law with Judge Shaler,
a leading attorney of the day, and in December of 1838 he was admitted to the
Allegheny County Bar.

While a student in the University, he brought to his work the same
painstaking care, intensity of application and discrimination of judgment

‘which characterized him in all his after life and made it so eminently success-

ful; and when, at the opening of the college term after he had ﬁnished his
course, a temporary vacancy occurred in the Latin department, young Mellon
was, by reason of his accurate and thorough scholarship, chosen to ﬁll the posi-
tion. Ever afterwards he declared that his experience in the professor’s
chair was of incalculable beneﬁt to him.

For some months he served as managing clerk of the Prothonotary’s
office, and in June, 1839, he began the active practice of the law. His office
was on Fifth avenue and Market street. and from the beginning he enjoyed
a remarkably lucrative practice. In 1858 his intense labors began to tell upon
his health, and his friends both at the bar and on the bench, prevailed upon
him to become a candidate for a judgeship recently createdin the Court of
Common Pleas No. I. and he was elected. He discharged the duties of this

“These boys will grow to be men and will drag the heavy artillery along the

plies. A mighty nice boy.

HERMON AIKEN BLACKWOOD, Freeport, Ohio.
“Cut and come again.”

This is quoted because it does not apply. “Black” was never known to
vote Cut on a ballot in class meeting. He is a plodder. Would we all were.
Blackwood graduated from High School at Freeport, Ohio, and taught school
for a number of years before beginning to study medicine.

Don’t say your eyes are brown, Campbell, or we will have to change

PAUL HUME CRAWFORD AK‘? AKE Crafton, Pa.

Israelite indeed in whom is no guile. Attended Normal School at one time.

HOWARD BASSETT EMERSON, Pittsburgh, Pa.
“It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.”

Our Treasurer. Don’t get sore, “Eni.” A good square fellow. He claims

That may come, however, from midnight hours with the American Text

“I do know of these, that are therefore reputed wise for saying nothing.”

“Figger 8” or Sailor Floyd served four long years before the mast as Hos-

Gettysburg College.

M. BENNER GOSSER, NEN ‘1’NE Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Short absence hurt him more
And made his wound far greater than before.”

This doesn‘t refer to school, for Ben spends no more time there than’
necessary. Graduate Pittsburgh High School in 1901. Two years at State
College. There has been a question in the minds of many, why Gosser left
State? V\’e can’t answer it.

“Blessing on him who invented sleep.”

Abe was Secretary last year. He often goes to sleep in lectures, and

made of his jovial disposition, winning smile, and last but not least his sincere

he has speaking tubes, night bells and all other instruments needed by patients.
That’s the way to get along, Moore.

SIMON W. MARICK. Pittsburgh, Pa.

“None but himself can be his parallel.”

Marick is never seen but in company with Williams. Therefore they are
named Hook and I. He can recite anatomy like an Edison phonograph, but
for looking at a patient’s tongue he is as apt to use a bread knife as a tea-
spoon. Never mind us, l\/Iarick. Graduate P. H. S.

C. ROY MEGAHAN AK‘1’—9NE Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Pandarus “You know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin.”
Cressida, “Indeed, a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring

Mac is in earnest when he speaks. That’s about all you can say for him,
unless you add that ‘he is a home product. But “A prophet is without honor
in his own country.”

GEORGE LAWRENCE MCCORMICK ‘PX Coraopolis, Pa.

“His gentleness has all the effect of grace
And for his form,

His only beauty is his honest face;
No common charm.”

CHARLES ROSS ‘PX Pittsburgh, Pa.
“I note a parable from the New Testament and state why a parable is an.

Yes, Ross has a reason for everything. If he hasn’t he says so, and more

ofﬁce with the most signal success until the close of his term, but declined
renomination. From this time on he engaged in the banking business and in
1886 the ﬁrm of T. Mellon & Sons was established. The ﬁrm immediately
took rank as one of the strongest in the country, Mr. Mellon showing the same
capacity for a business career as he had in the practice of law. He has ever
been distinguished for accurate knowledge, clearness of perception, keenness
of Vision, quickness of decision, honesty of purpose, integrity of character,
and in everything he has undertaken has given evidence of qualities of mind
and character that have insured success.

In 1843 Mr. Mellon was united in matrimony with Miss Sarah J. Negley,
and eight children were born of this marriage. He joined his four sons with
him in business, and they have manifested the same distinguished abilities as
their father.

Some years ago Judge Mellon retired from active participation in the
management of affairs, though for a long time he continued daily to visit his
office. Tho the ﬁrm of T. Mellont & Sons has grown into one of the largest cor-
porations in the country, the business is still conducted in the same location
where it was begun many years ago. Three sons, Mr. James R., Mr. Andrew
W., and Mr. Richard B., and ﬁve grandsons compose the strong and inﬂu-
ential Mellon name in the business world to-day.

Judge Mellon, at the advanced age of ninety-three, is spending his clos-
ing years tranquilly at his beautiful home on Negley avenue. Surrounded
as he is by his sons and daughters, his grand-children and his friends, held?
in highest regard by the people of the city where he has spent practically his
entire life, he is able to look back over the past with pride and satisfaction, and
forward into the future with serene trust. As the oldest living alumnus of
the Western University the editors have dedicated this initial volume to him.

thud, rebound, gather himself together and wake up.

HONORABLE JAMES HAY REED.

James Hay Reed was born in Allegheny, Pa., September 10, 1853, and
belongs to one of the old and historic families of the Commonwealth. He
received his preparatory training in the public schools of Pittsburgh and
was graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania in the class of
1872. He entered immediately upon the study of law in the office of his
uncle, Honorable David Reed, and was admitted to the Allegheny County
bar in July, .1875. Very shortly after this he formed a partnership with
Philander Chase Knox under the ﬁrm name Knox & Reed. The ﬁrm sprang
almost at once into prominence and in a very short timle it gained a large and
lucrative practice.

From the beginning the ﬁrm was employed in matters connected with
the large manufacturing and railroad corporate interests, and in many of
these Judge Reed became a stockholder and an ofﬁcer. The partnership be-

. tween Mr. Knox and Mr. Reed continued with a brief interruption until the
former was appointed Attorney General of the United States by President
McKinley in April, 1901, at which time the partnership was dissolved.

In February, 1891, President Harrison appointed Mr. Reed judge of the
District Court of Western District of Pennsylvania. The duties of this office
did not prove congenial to Mr. Reed’s temperament. fond as he was of varied
activities, and he resigned the office in 1892. After a short period of rest he
resumed the active practice of the law with Mr. Knox. For some years Mr.
Reed had served as general counsel for the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad
Company, and shortly after he resigned from the judicial office he was made
the Vice President of this company.

It is not possible in t-his brief sketch to indicate with any fulness the

THE SWEET CO’ED.

A sweet Co’ed came home from school,
And she was wondrous wise;
The folks were astonished—
She quite took them by surprise,
For her knowledge was extensive
And she talked just like 5 book,
Yet she seemed to be offended
When they asked if she could cook.

She knew the whole curriculum
Of sciences and arts
And carried with her on a string
A score of student hearts;
But she always changed the subject
With a pained, reproachful look
When admiring callers asked her
If she’d ever learned to COOK.

She could write a Latin sonnet
Or a poem in Attic Greek,
Could converse in French and German
Or quote Browning by the week.
Though she settled abstruse questions
There was one she could not brook,
Though it seemed so very simple;
’Twas the question, “Can you cook?”

She gave her time to twenty clubs,
Was never known to shirk.

She raved about philanthropy
(Her mother did the work),

But discerning friends oft noticed
How her nose would upward turn

When any one inquired
If ’twas so she could cock.

high a11d responsible offices held by Judge Reed. His legal connection with the
Carnegie Steel Company led to his close identiﬁcation with its various inter-
ests. He was one of the incorporators of the Pittsburgh, Bessemer & Lake
Erie Railroad, and he resigned the Vice Presidency of the Pittsburgh & Lake
Erie to accept the Presidency of the new line. During 1898 he attended to the
legal part of organizing the Consolidated Gas Company of Pittsburgh, and
early in 1899, when other lighting an(l heating interests were consolidated
with it, he was elected President of the Philadelphia Company, which position
he still holds.

Judge Reed also represented the Carnegie interests as counsel in the for-
mation of the United States Steel Corporation and became a member of the
Board of Directors. For many years he has been a director of the Farmers
National Bank of Pittsburgh, and director of the Carnegie Steel Company,
President of the Union Railway Company of Pittsburgh, and in all of these,
as well as in many other organizations, he has been a forceful factor.

In politics Judge Reed is a Republican, in religion a Presbyterian, for
many years a member of the Shadyside Presbyterian church. He is a
member of the Duquesne club of Pittsburgh, Union League of Philadelphia,
and of the Metropolitan, the Union League and the Lawyers’ club of New
York. In: 1902 he was given the degree of Doctor of Laws by Princeton
University.

On June 6, 1878, he was united in marriage with Miss Katherine 
Aiken, daughter of David Aiken, a prominent business man of Pittsburgh,
now deceased. Three children. have been born to them, David A., associated
with l’11S father in the practice of law under the ﬁrm name of Reed, Smith,
Shaw and Beal; James H., ]r., a student, and Miss Katherine Reed.

For her many household duties
She all things then forsook.
And 't\V'as thus. 0 gentle reader,
That she HAD to learn to cook.

HONORABLE GEORGE WILKINS GUTHRIE.

George Wilkins Guthrie was born in Pittsburgh, September 5, 1848, and
is the descendant of historic ancestry. His father was John Brandon
Guthrie, Mayor of Pittsburgh in 185I—52. He prepared for college in the
public schools of Pittsburgh and was graduated from the VVestern University
of Pennsylvania in the class of 1866.

Judge Lowrie was a very intimate friend of the Guthrie family and rec-
ognizing the ability of young Guthrie, advised him to pursue a course that
would prepare him for a commercial career. Even then the future prom-
inence of Pittsburgh along commercial, manufacturing and industrial lines,
was clearly evident. The tastes of Mr. Guthrie, however, inclined him more
strongly to a professional career, and in 1867 he entered the law office of
Robert J. Walker, of Washington, D. C., and still la;ter entered Columbian
University Law School in Washington, from which he was graduated in
1869. He was admitted to the bar in Washington, but soon returned to Pitts-
burgh, and on November 5, 1869, he became a member of the Allegheny
County Bar. Almost at once he took a prominent place among his legal
brethren, became known as one of the orators of the city, identiﬁed himself
with measures of reform which looked to the future wellbeing of the city,
and always interested himself deeply in civic affairs.

His early eminence as a Democratic leader resulted in his election as one
of the secretaries of the National Convention in 1884. He was also nominated

for elector at large in 1896, but bein.g unable to accept the platform of the
National Convention, decided to withdraw. In political life he has always
carried the same lofty principles as have characterized him in. his professional
and personal life.

Mr. Guthrie is one of the framers of the Greater Pittsburgh Bill, his as-
sociate in this measure being David T. Watson. He is prominent in the
Masonic Fraternity, is a member and an honored officer in the Episcopalian
Church, and is also a member of the Pittsburgh Club, the Pittsburgh Golf
Club, and the University Club of New York. In business affairs he is
Vice—President and Trustee of the Dollar Savings Bank, and a member of the
Board of Managers of the Kingsley Association and the Children’s Hospital.
VVhen a student in the University he was a member of the Phi Gamma
Delta Fraternity. In 1905 his Alma Mater conferred upon him the degree of
Doctor of Laws. ~

The election of Mr. Guthrie as Mayor of Greater Pittsburgh is the most
recent tribute that has been paid to his sterling qualities as a citizen and as a
man. As the ﬁrst Mayor of Greater Pittsburgh his friends conﬁdently predict
for him a career of eminence for which his past attainments have ﬁtted him,
and are resting upon the assured hope that his administration will bring
Pittsburgh to its rightful place as one of the greatest cities in the country.,
The editors of the “Owl” congratulate the University upon furnishing such
an alumnus as the Mayor of this great city.

MR. WILLIAM THAW.

While this publication is designed to set forth the various organizations
of the University ar.d is not a history, yet the editors of the ﬁrst Junior
Annual deem it appropriate that some reference be made to the man who,
above all others perhaps, bore the University upon his heart and gave most
bouutifully to its needs. It is nearly seventeen years since VVilliam Thaw
passed away and yet his name in the Western University of Pennsylvania, as
in the community at large, is beloved and his kindly deeds remembered as if
he were still with us.

William Thaw, born in Pittsburgh October 12, 1818, was the son of John
Thaw, who came to this city in I804._ The young lad completed his education
in the Western University and began business in 1834 as bank clerk
and continued his active business life until he died, August 17,
1889. In 1835 he became a clerk in the commission business, and in 1840 he
formed a partnership with Thomas S. Clarke, his brother-in-law, as trans-
porters and owners of steam and canal boats. At this time the forwarding
business furnished a ﬁeld for largest enterprise and so continued until the
advent of the steam road, which, of course, brought an end to the canal, but
introduced the swifter and more effective methods of the present day. Mr.
Thaw at once saw the possibilities of steam, as quickly as possible disposed
of his other interests, entered into therailroad business, and con,nected himself
with the railroad system west of Pittsburgh. He was a director of the Penn-
sylvania Railroad Company, Second Vice-President of the Pennsylvania
Company, and Second Vice-President of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St.
Louis Railroad.

Mr. Thaw’s personality was wrought into the very life of Pittsburgh, so
that what the city becomes will be very largely because of what he did.
He was an earnest Christian, deeply interested in the church, and

The Courant is the official publication of the student body of the Uni-
versity and is published monthly by the editorial board elected directly from
among the students, during the ﬁrst month of each school year. The Courant
this year will see its eighteenth anniversary, having been ﬁrst issued in 1888.
The Courant in the beginning was the student organ of the Collegiate and
Engineering Departments only, but has grown with the institution and now
includes on its editorial staff representatives from each department. With the
publication of the June number The Courant will close one of the most suc-
cessful years in its long history. I

deeply interested in his city. For years before his death certain hours each
morning were devoted to hearing appeals in behalf of those in need, and in
behalf of organizations requiring help. He gave liberally, and niultitudes of
people to—day remember him with gratitude, and scores of institutions are
enjoying prosperity and doing work of largest importance because ‘of the
assistance he gave them years ago. He was gifted with the highest 1ntell1—
gence, and through study and observation became a man of richest culture.
Earnest, sincere, self—reliant, broad, generous, far-seeing, sympathetic, it was
given him to accomplish most largely and most beneﬁcently.

It is, however, because of his interest in the Western University that his
memory is recalled in this publication. He was an early and generous friend of
the Allegheny Observatory, and to him it was largely indebted for the means
wherewith to carry on the great work under Langley, Keeler, and others.
Long before large endowments were thought of Mr. Thaw and Mr. King
provided the salary for the chair of Natural Sciences, and in 1864* ‘through
his gifts and the gifts of others, $20,000 endowment was provided for this
chair. He also contributed to the endowment of others chairs, and in 1871
offered to contribute $100,000 toward the permanent endowment of the Uni-
versity on condition that a like amount should be given by the citizens, a task
accomplished in 1875. In his will he bequeathed another $100,000, and his
total benefactions, doubtless, were something over $300,000. As important
as were his gifts, was his personal devotion to the University, his intelligent
foresight, and his clear conception of its possibilities for the future. Tlhe
failure of his plan to have the University located on the site of the peniten-
tiary, iii West Park, was one of the bitter disappointments of his life. When
the greater University is realized the part that Mr. Thaw had in its making
in the earlier days will not be forgotten.

Kaufman Clinic and Reineman Hospital.

[234]

KAUFMAN C.LINICi AND .REINEMAN HOSPITAL.

These two institutions are under control of the Medical Department and
accomplish much good. The Emma Kaufman Clinic was built through the
generosity of Mr. Isaac Kaufman. Ten men from the Senior Class are ap-
pointed according to class standing, to assist in the care of patients. Over
ten thousand patients are treated here. every year and a like number of pre-
scriptions are dispensed. This is a great factor for good and relieves much
suffering among the poor in the greatly congested Penn avenue district, since
all treatment is free. ’ ‘

The Reineman Maternity Hospital is a benefaction of the late Adam
Reineman. The boys from the Kaufman Clinic take‘ turns acting as Resident
Physician. Thus each man serves a term of ﬁve weeks. About one hundred
and ﬁfty patients are cared for annually and records in the past compare fa-
vorably with the largest hospitals in the East. Dr. Joseph Asdale has direct
supervision of both institutions.

The Electric Club of the Fniversity was organized one year ago among
the students in the Senior and junior classes of the Electric Engineering De-
partment. The objects of the club, as stated in the preamble of its constitu-
tion are: “To familiarize ourselves with the best modern practice in electrical
engineering, to keep informed on current topics of the times; to secure prac-
tice in expressing ourselves in public assemblies; and‘ to promote the interests
of the Electrical Engineering Department of the University.” In pursuit of
these ends the constitution provides for weekly meetings to be devoted to
the reading of papers on electrical subjects and to reviews of current electrical
publications. In addition to these sources of information each member, by
reason of his student membership in the American Institute of Electrical En-
gineers, receives a copy of the proceedings of the monthly meetings of that
body in New York.

The first year’s work of the club has proven it a very interesting adjunct
to the electrical course. The papers have been carefully prepared and the
discussions, if not profound, have, at lea.st, been not without value for

“Thoughts shut up want air,
And spoil, like bales unopen’d to the sun.”

As the result of the commendable showing made last year by the inter-
collegiate debating team the original literary society was reorganized this
year into The Debating Society of the Western University of Pennsylvania,
E. Robert Wiese, ’o7, who strongly advocated the change, was elected presi-
dent, with D. E. Miller, ’o7, and J. A. Miller, ’o7, vice president and secretary
respectfully. When the Tri—State Debating League was formed’ between
Wooster University, University of West Virginia and Western University of
Pennsylvania, at the suggestion of the Chancellor the name was again changed
to the old Philomathein Literary Society of the Western University of Penn-
sylvania. The change in the name has had little to do with the work ac-
complished and the society is now one of the strongest organizations in the
University.

The Classical Club of V’. U. P. was organized in 1905 under the direction
of Professors Scribner and Des Islets. The members for the most part are
drawn from the Classical and Latin—Scientiﬁc courses, but the membership
is not limited to these. The main object of the club ‘has been to stimulate
interest and research in classical subjects in addition to the study of the
languages themselves. The programs are interesting, meeting once in two
weeks, the time is taken up in the reading and discussion of prepared essays.
The beneﬁt derived from this club has been felt by each student. The out-

look for the rest of this year is bright, every member taking a working in-
terest in the club.

Have you heard the glad. refrain?
VVe will sing it once again,
Singing for \/Vestern Pennsylvania.
With our loyal comrades true
We will cheer the gold and blue,
Cheering for Western Pennsylvania.

Chorus.
Hail, Alma Mater,
Thy sons cheer thee now,
To thee, W—U—P,
All foemen must bow;
Victorious forever
Thy colors shall be,
And ever shall wave in victory.

II.

Every morn our colors rise
In the blue and golden skies,

Shining for Western Pennsylvania,
And the love in every soul
Brings us nearer to the goal—

Vict’ry for Western Pennsylvania.

III.
Every man shall play his part;
Each hath love within his heart,

Love for old \/Vestern Pennsylvania.

Dear old Wup shall never fear
While a thousand voices cheer,

Cheer for old Western Pennsylvania.

HISTORY
of
THE WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.

The Western University of Pennsylvania is the oldest institution of
learning, excepting the University of Nashville, west of the Appalachians.
Its life-growth began as early as 1770, when, in the earliest days of Western
Pennsylvania, a school was started for educating the youth. This continued
until 1787, when it was incorporated by act of Legislature as the Pittsburgh
Academy. The incorporators were men famed for their love of learning.
Among the number were some who later took an active interest in the found-
ing of Washington Academy and of Jefferson Academy.

The Principals of the Academy were: George Welch, James Mount,
Robert Patterson and Joseph Stockton. The last named in I805 took charge
of Meadville Academy, now Allegheny College, and was the author of the
“Western Calculator” and the “Western Spelling Book.”

In 1819, after Professor Stockton’s successful service, a distinguished
company of men petitioned the Legislature for a charter, giving the school
full university powers. Here broad-mindedness was shown:, for it was dis-
tinctly speciﬁed that neither color nor creed should cause any discrimination,
and that the instructors must have not only ability, but high moral quality.
On February 19, 1819, the charter was granted, and the University came into
being. The State, as an incentive to learning gave 50 acres of land in. Alle-
gheny and afterward commuted this to $2,400.00 annually for ﬁve years.

With the money thus received, and from generous contributions, a Col-
lege Building, exceptional for that day, was erected at Third Avenue and
Cherry Alley, Pittsburgh. In the new building, a remarkable faculty, the
first of the University, was collected. Here, when denominational rivalrygwas
most intense, Roman Catholic and Presbyterian—Reformed and Associate

Presbyterian—wrought together for the good of the University and of the
community. Under the able and harmonious guidance of these Professors, a
class of three graduated in 1823. The next year a class of seven, then a class
of ten, each having in it men who soon brought distinction to them-
selves and honor to their Alma Mater. So it has always been with this
institution. -

Dr. Bruce, the ﬁrst president, held office from 1822 until 1843. In his
twenty years of service the University flourished and became widely known.
His successor, however, the Rev. Herman Dyer, was not so fortunate. In
1845, the University building was destroyed by the great fire and the new
building on Duquesne way, completed in 1846, met the same fate in 1849.
As a consequence, a temporary suspension of work followed.

In 1854 a third building was completed at Ross and Diamond streets,
Pittsburgh, and in 1855 the work was again started under Dr. John F. Mc-
Laren, who was inducted into office the next year. During the three years
of Dr. McLaren’s regime, the University was marked by a notable gathering
of students.

In 1858 Dr. McLaren was succeeded by Dr. George Woods, LL. D.,
an enthusiastic advocate of culture and an indefatigable worker for the
University. During his ﬁrst year Mr. Thomas Hind bequeathed to the col-
lege a valuable collection of geological specimens, and in October. 1858),
largely through Mr. John Harper, a Chemical Laboratory was equipped.
Three years later a Gymnasium was furnished, and in April, 1863, more
ground was purchased. Soon after an endowment of twenty thousand dollars
was provided for a chair in Natural Science, previously sustained by $1,200
a year from Mr. William Thaw and Mr. Josiah King. In June, 1865, this
chair was changed to one in Chemistry and Geology. Twenty thousand dol-
lars was also secured for a chair in Astrophysics, and the buildings and

jiu jitsu. No one can afford to be without it.

A TOAST OF LOVE.

I drink to the girl, who wrought my woe,

In youth’s bright morning of long ago.

To her whose eyes, as the stars above,

Taught me the sweet old story of love.

To her whose lips, of a cherry red,

Dimpled in smiles, as the laughter spread,
Laughter such as the running brooks,

As nature holds in her unsealed books.

To hair of a color, as clouds that rise,

Touched with the gold of Orient skies:

And a voice whose music, divinely sweet,

The enraptured angels in Heaven repeat.

And, Boys, as I've drunk in Auld Lang Syne,
\V0uld I drink again, in rich. red wine.

But stop, a moment, you see my love

Is an angel on earth, from the Gods above.
Ard he who from now dares her name profane,
Shall answer me in the right of my claim.

So come; ﬁll your glasses, and drink down a toast,
That but one of us utters and all of us boast.

property of the Allegheny observatory were given in trust to the University.
It speaks much for the interest of the community in the University, that,
amid all the anxieties and distractions of the Civil \/Var, the people should
thus make such generous provision for higher education in their midst.

In 1867 Dr. Samuel P. Langley was made director of the observatory
and served as such for twenty years. During this period he made the obser-
vatory famed throughout the world. He resigned to become secretary of
the Smithsonian Institute. His recent death is a loss to the world of science.

In 1871 Mr. William Thaw gave $100,000 to the University on condition
that the citizens of Western Pennsylvania contribute a like amount. This was
secured in 1875. To add to this good fortune, in 1872, the Legislature enlarged
the powers of the University. The Mayors of Pittsburgh and Allegheny were
made ex-officio members of the board; the title of the presiding officer was
changed from president to chancellor; the board was increased to thirty
members, and the University received the right to take and administer prop-
erty for the purposes of its foundation. In 1873 Mr. Robert Watson be-
queathed his large and valuable library to the University and the cabinet of
the Rev. Joseph Travelli was added to the museum. In 1875 the buildings
were en.larged to meet the growing demand of the institution.

In 1860 a preparatory department with Professor H. H. North as principal,
was instituted. From 1862 until 1882, instruction in military tactics, under
Major F. E. Chalfant, was a feature of the curriculum. The increasing repu-
tation of the University brought into the faculty such men as Langley and
Phillips, in Chemistry; Rohrbacher, in German; Jillsen, in Biology, and Goff,
in Mathematics; so that when, in I880, Chancellor Woods resigned from
office, the University had attained a high degree of success and inﬂuence.

In 1880 Dr. Henry  I\IcCracken became chancellor. Singular discour-
agements fell in his path. In 1882 the University building was sold to Alle-

WILBERT AND NANETTE GO FISHING.

J. \/Vilbert Osterbrook sighed, lit a cigarette and perched his feet on the
balustrade of the Merwith Hotel veranda. If one had taken_ the trouble to
examine his face, they could easily have seen that he was troubled, or was it
disgust that ‘held sway in his features? Here he had been in “this one-
horse watering place,” as he called VVyncliffe—on-the-Lake, for three whole
days, and no sign of a conquest as yet.

True, there were women at the hotel who spoke of themselves as “we
girls,” but Mr. Osterbrook had decided on the first day of his visit that none
of them, as far as his inclinations or ambitions led, were eligible. About the
second day Wilbert had reached the conclusion that every member of the
gentle sex at the hotel was a school teacher, and suggested to the hotel clerk
that “The Old Ladies’ Haven” would be a more appropriate name for‘t’he
resort. The afternoon of the third day found Wilbert suffering so badly from
ennui that he thought of tearing up paper money, just to amuse himself.

However, on second thought, he remembered that he had received, the
day before his depature for \Vyncliffe, a letter from a college friend of his, in-
viting him over east to spend a week or two in the Adirondacks, and hinting
that there would be plenty of entertainment of the kind that Wilbert liklid
best. His mind was made up in an instant; he would telegraph to Fred that
he would leave for the east at once. He rose from his chair, threw away his
half-smoked cigarette, went into the office and asked the clerk for a time}-
table. Raising his eyes from the schedule of departing trains at the swish of
approaching skirts, VVilbert received a pleasant shock. Before him stood a
most bewitching little miss of probably nineteen or twenty years, or rather
summers, for every line of her daintly moulded face bespoke the warmth of
July or August, but nothing of cold, hard winters. VVith a ﬂourish she regis-
tered, and without any confusion whatever, and with the ease of one who ‘had
traveled much, she made all arrangements for her stay, and then withdrew to
her room.

The clerk looked at Wilbert; Wilbert slowly crumpled the tin1e—table,
threw it away, walked over to the register and read the name of the newly-

arrived guest.
[ 288 ]

“Nanette Wilcox. It’s a pretty name and sounds quite poetic,” thought
Wilbert.

“Are you going away on the 8:15, Mr. Osterbrook ?” inquired the clerk.

“No,” replied VVi1bert. “I have decided to stay over to-morrow, to do a
little ﬁshing.”

The next morning found \/Vilbert and Nanette strolling aimlessly along

the lake front. The clerk at the hotel was a diplomat, and, by one of a score
or more of clever ruses which ‘he from time to tim-e used in his capacity as a

clerk at summer hotels, had, by no seeming pre-arrangement, found oppor-
tunity for the young folks to be introduced to each other.

Nanette thought Mr. Osterbrook very interesting; Wilbert thought Miss
Wilcox fascinating. Nanette spoke of her family, the Wilcoxes of New York

and London; Wilbert described to her his ranch in Montana and the extenr
sive mining interests he owned throughout the West. After a little time,

without a suggestion from either, they stopped and sat themselves upon the
sandy beach. They were far enough from the hotel so that they would not
be disturbed in their dreams, for they had begun to dream. For a while
neither spoke; she sat gazing out over the lake; he, reclining on his elbow.,
feasted his eyes upon her. Nanette was the ﬁrst to speak.

“How very curious it is that you should be stopping at a little-out—of-
the-way place like Wyncliffe P” ventured Miss Wilcox.

“No more strange than that you should be here,” replied Wilbert. “I'
just stopped off for a day or two of rest before going on to Newport for a.

short visit before leaving on my yacht for Mexico, to look after some business
interests I have there.”

“How very glad I am that I sent my maid on to New York and pre-
vailed upon mama to allow me to stop, all alone, at some quiet little watering
place for a week, before going on to Saratoga, where mama, next week, en-
tertains Lord Verrysopht, of Suffolk; and how fortunate that I chose Wyn-
cliffe,” remarked Nanette.

It it needless to suggest that after these explanations, the young folks
became very interesting to each other. \Vilbert, being of a stremuous caliber,
lost no time in pressing his suit, and as Nianette seemed very much pleased and

offered but little resistance, the young man got along swimmingly. Soon

[289]

Wilbert found himself in the midst of poetic sentiment. An ordinary out-
burst of affection not having the expected result, Wilbert ﬁred a broadside:

“4l\/lomentarily, in a spirit of despondency, I drift into a world, passion-
less and void of hope, where the evening star of my existence has hidden‘ its
endearintg countenance beyond Ia glacier of perpetual sorrow. Many, ere this,
have breathed words of affection and adoration against your beautiful cheek,
but such spasmodic affections were but the incubation of the hothouse of
passion. There are panoramas of sunsets, storms and well—clouded moons,

but one look into your eyes allures and fascinates a mot unwilling captive.”

Wilbert knew that there was more of the above, but he couldn’t recall
the remainder. Nanette eagerly drank in his words. Soon Wilbert discarded
the role of sentimental lover, and became a man of action. With breezy
Western assurance he took the young lady by the waist, and-proposed.
However, Nanette did not capitulate at once. She dropped her eyes and be-
ganu poking the heel of her little low-cut shoe into the sand, revealing, uncon-
sciously, ﬁrst a very trim ankle, and then an inch or two of black open'—work
stocking, and then-—Nanette said:

“I am sorry, Wilbert, but the man I marry must be a hero. Now, if you
could do something romantic, then—” but the little miss did not ﬁnish the

sentence.

Wilbert was silent for a minute. He did not feel downcast; for a ‘West-
ern man to prove himself a hero was a small matter——there was not a man in
the whole West who was not capable of heroic action if the opportunity pre-
sented itself. Wilbert saw that the opportunity was the stumbling block,
but he would create an! opportunity.

The lovers walked leisurely back to the hotel; neither spoke. Nanettle
wished Wilbert a hero, and Wilbert racked his brain for a scheme to create
an opportunity for heroic action. As they neared the hotel, Wilbert’s eyes

suddenly sparkled; he had laid his plans. After making an engagement: to
take her canoeing in the afternoon, he excused himself, rather hastily, Nan-
ette thought.

Indeed, Wilbert, to whom ideas usually came quickly, had hit upon a!
scheme. He went immediately to a boat-house kept by a genial old man, and
boldly laid bare his plans. The old boat—keeper had been young himself, and
[ 290 II

after but little persuasion, and a promise of an extra fee, consented to VVilbert’s
plan and even offered a few suggestions, and wished him success.

Evidently both the young folks enjoyed canoeing, and each other’s com-
pany, very much, for after that afternoon. almost all of their time was spent
paddling up and down the lake. Of course, the scandal chorus of the ancient
ones at the hotel was working over time, but the young folks were too inter-
ested in their love-making to notice the whisperings of the other guests.

Their stay at Wyncliffe was nearing an end. It was Saturday afternoon;
Nanette left that evening for Saratoga; the following morning Wilbert would,
as he. expressed it, “pull stakes and move on to Newport.” So this would be
their last afternoon together on the lake. The young man paddled about
aimlessly for a w‘hile and then turned the nose of the canoe toward a little
cove, where he knew the waiter was shallow. After they were within the
cove, Wilbert ceased his paddling, and the young folks gazed admiringly at
each other.

“I’m so happy,” said Nanette after a while.

“I’m in the same boat,” smilingly answered Wilbert.

Then he called her attention to a little inlet, almost concealed by the
willows along its banks, which they until now had not noticed. She care-
fully turned to look at it, and at the same time Wilbert began to paddle
toward the streamlet. Just as her back was turned to him, Wilbert poumvded
his foot into the bottom of the canoe and then immediately pulled the cork
from a boring he had made in the bottom of the boat.

“What was that jar?” asked Nanette, turning to ﬁnd the cause of the
bump.

“I suppose we must have scraped on a rock,” answered Wilbert, uncon-
cernedly.

“But, O, see the canoe is leaking!” cried Nanette. “Where is the bai1ing~
bucket?” she continued, becoming excited.

In his haste to get the bucket, which he knew he had left behind, Wilbert
let the paddle drop from his grasp and over the side of the canoe, out of his
reach. When the bucket could not be found, Nanette became hysterical.
Now came the opportunity which Wilbert had created.

He struck a dramatic pose, and exclaimed, courageously, “Fear not, dear
one, I Will save you.”

The canoe ﬁlled rapidly, and just as the little boat became submerged,

[291]

Wilbert, keeping Nanette’s nose above water, but ducking her now and then,
and he himself allowing his head to go under occasionally, struck out, as
Nanette thought, for the shore. Having bottom to walk on, the youth ﬁnally
got the maiden to safety.

As Nanette opened her eyes in bewilderment, Wilbert leaned over her
and said, “My dear, I beg to advise you that you are saved. Do you still be-
lieve that to the brave belong the fair ?” Inwardly he chuckled.

“You may send the ring to Saraltoga,” answered Nanette.

About noon the following Friday, a young man left his counter in Kauf-
m=ann’s to go for lun-ch. He walked swiftly down Fifth avenue to Smithﬁeld
street and then continued his way along the latter thoroughfare until he
reached Diamond. Turning from Smithﬁeld street he slackened his pace;
his eyes sought for something. He continued to wander down Diamond
street, looking carefully from one side to the other. His search led him on
past VVood street. Finally his face glowed and his eyes sparkled. He

stopped. He read again. Yes, that was what he was looking for. A sign
on the opposite side of the street read:

“Dinnier Now Ready,
Full Meal, I 5 Cents.”
He crossed over and entered the restaurant.
A young lady came up to wait on him. He raised his eyes and met her’s,

but for an instant. She murmured to herself, “Wilbert!” He muttered under

his breath, “Nanette!” He dropped his eyes to the table; she stared straight
ahead and saw nothing.

After an: embarrassing moment the young lady said, “What’ll y’u have?”
“Fish,” said he.

In the study of the ancients
I exhaust the dear prof’s patience,

In the science known as Trig.
I am nothing but a prig,

But I win m sets in tennis, don’t ou know!

I can't deﬁne Hydraulics,
But none can do my frolics

As a, swimmer and a (liver, don’t you know!

I’m not up in Astronomics,
But excel in Gastronomics,

For my appetite’s quite hearty, don’t you know!

I’ye no use for Osteology,
A jackass in Geology——
I’m the touch-stone of society, you know!

I’ye no interest in Theology,
Don’t bother with Psychology,
As I take things pretty easy, don’t you know!

I’m dead sure of graduation,
’Spite my mental moderation,
For I’m the College Athlete, don’t you know!

ess of ‘ratiocenation’ has led us to the conclusion that instead of foot ball we

gheny county for a temporary court house, made necessary by the destruction
of the old court house by ﬁre. On North avenue, in Allegheny, the college
struggled on despite many heavy handicaps. It was not all misfortune
however, for here Dr. Daniel Carhart became one of the faculty. Dr.
McCracken resigned in 1884 to become Chancellor of the University of New
York.

Chancellor Milton P. Goff, who succeeded Dr. McCracken, directed the
University from 1884 until 1890, when his untimely death left the chancel-
lorship vacant. His term of office was marked by the erection, on Observa-
tory Hill, of the present University buildings, which were completed in 1889,
and occupied January, 1890. Beside this, the adoption of a new and broader
schedule led to the discontinuance of the Preparatory department and to the
establishment of larger laboratories and full courses in Chemistry and Engin-
eering. But the most signal event was the death of Mr. William Thaw, who,
through his thoughtful benefactions in life, and by his will enabled the Uni-
versity to brave those ﬁnancial dangers most disastrous to institutions of
learning. To him has rightly been given the cognomen, “Preserver of the
University.”

This brings us to the third stage in the history of the University. In
1892 Dr. VVilliam J. Holland, distinguished as a naturalist, took up the
arduous duties of Chancellor. By broad and liberal policy the University be-
came so in fact, as in name. Dr. James E. Keeler became director of th.-e
observatory and rendered valuable service until called to the directorship
of the Lick Observatory in California. The Engineering school was enlarged
by courses in Electricity and in Mining—graduate courses of study were
mapped out and laboratories were better equipped by gifts of money and in-
struments.

Furthermore, in 1892, the VVestern Pennsylvania Medical College was
amalgamated with the University. In 1895, the Law department was added

THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS.

I lounged i11 my chair at midnight,
And listening heard the chimes,

And watched the dance and whirling ﬂight
Of the ﬂames as they upward climbed.

The logs burned lower and lower,
Each dying alone in its way,
Until o’er the darkening ﬂoor
The shadowts crept in their play.

And there, as I watched and waited,
Came the dream of a beautiful girl;

She the one of whom I was fated
To dream, a matchless pearl.

And again to me came this maiden,
As beside me she sat and sang

Of the sweetest with which life is ladened;
That which always causes a pang.

I could see her still in my dreaming
Gazing up in the silvery light,

As o’er her the moonlight beaming;
O’er her, a true queen of the night.

Whose touch on my brow cooling lingers,
Whose caress ﬂutters over my lips.

A caress of those slender white ﬁngers,
A touch of those delicate tips.

Who was it my arms enfolded?
Whose head nestled down on my breast?
She, whose ﬁgure, exquisitely moulded,
I would never exchange for the rest.

For, you see, she but lives in my dreams,
This girl with the wonderous air;

And yet——there she always seems
So unsurpassingly fair.

Deﬁnitions.

I. All Boarding Houses are the same Boarding House.

II. Boarders in the same Boarding House and on the same ﬂat are equal
to one another.

III. A single room is that which has no parts and no magnitude.

IV. The landlady of a Boarding House is a parallelogram—that is, an
oblong angular ﬁgure which cannot be described, but which is equal to any-
thing.

V. A wrangle is the disinclination of two boarders to each other that
meet together, but are not on the same ﬂat.

VI. All other rooms being taken, a single room is said to be a double
room.

Postulates and Propositions.

I. A Boarding House Pie may be produced any number of times.

II. The Landlady can- be reduced to her lowest terms by a series of
propositions.

III. A bee line may be made from any boarding house to any other.

IV. The clothes of a Boarding House Bed though produced indeﬁnitely
both ways will not meet.

V. Any two meals at a Boarding House are together less than one
square meal.

_ VI. If from the opposite ends of a Boarding House a line be drawn, pass-
ing through all rooms in succession, then the stove-pipe which heats the
rooms will be within that line.

VII. On the same bill and on the same side of it there should not be
two charges for the same thing, but if there be two charges for the same
thing they should be on opposite side of the bill.

VIII. If there be two boarders on the same ﬂat and the amount of
space of one be equal to the amount of space of the other, each to each, and
the wrangle between one boarder and the landlady be equal to the wrangle
between the landlady and the other, then shall the weekly bills be equal also,

each to each. For if not, let one bill be the greater. Then will the other bill
be less than it might have been, which is absurd. Q E D

Remove yon skull from out the scattered heaps.

Is that a temple where a God may dwell?

Why even the worm at last disdains her shattered cell!
Look on its broken arch, its ruin’d wall;

Its chambers desolate, and portals foul.

Yes, this was once ambition’s airy hall.

The dome of thought, the palace of the soul.

Behold through each lack-lustre eyeless hole,

The gay recesses of wisdom and of wit,

And passion’s host, that never bro0k’d control.

Can all saint, sage, or sophist ever writ,

People this lonely tower, this tenement reﬁt?

MEETING OF THE ATHLETIC COMMITTEE

Being
A ‘.\Ionotony in One Act.

Scene: Chancellors office. Eighteen members seated around large table.
Time: Eight I’. M.

Dr. Huey (Rapping for order): “Gentlemen, we have more than a quo-
rum present. Let us proceed to the business of the evening. Will the
secretary read the minutes of the last meeting.

Dr. Huey, “As there are no corrections the minutes stan'd approved as
read. VVe will hear the reports of standing committees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..No
reports. We will hear from the chairmen of special committees. I will
first call for the report of the committee on material for coach. Dr. Friesell ?”

Dr. Friesell: “Gentlemen, I have here a full report on the correspondence
of the committee to date.” (Reads in full, ending with A. St. Leger Mosse
and Joseph H. Thompson.)

Mr. Hunter (Rises on recognition): “Now, before we go any further, I
would like to say something that has been on my mind for a long time. As
you all know, I am an out and out friend of Joe Thompson, and when I am
a friend to a man at all . . . . . . . . . . . .” (Etc. for forty minutes.)

Dr. McCormick: “Mr. Hunter, just here in connection with your re-
marks, I would like to say for the last time that this question is not one of
individuals nor . . . . . . . . . . ..” (Thirty minutes ultimatum.)

(Prolonged debate of an hour and thirty minutes’ duration.)
Mr. Fetterman (Rising during a pause for breath) : “Gentlemen, I must
positively go at once if I am to make the last train.”

(Debate resumed. Members leave by pairs, yawning.)

Mr. Huey (In desperation): “If there is no new business to be pre-

sented by members who have not spoken as yet, the chair will entertain a
motion to adjourn. Ah . . . . ..is there a second to that motion? Yes. . . .all

in favor will give their assent by . . . . ..The meeting is adjourned. (Aside)

AN ATHLETE’S RESOLUTION.

“Jim” McCleary, ’\/arsity tackle and first baseman, as chairman of the
Junior Prom Committee, had worked hard to make this affair a success and
about all the preparatory work had fallen upon his shoulders. He was ex-
officio chairman of the reception committee, too, and had lOOk€dr forward to
leading the opening march with feverish expectancy, and the thought that
he and his Philadelphia fairy would have this coveted pleasure, as w‘ell as the
privilege of whirling off into as many Waltzes and gallops with her as he chose,
caused his countenance to wear a contended mnemosyneian look, at least
until 7:00 P. M. of the evening before the lor1g—looked—for Hop, when “Mac"
got an unexpected notice from “Brownie" Hill, general athletic trainer,
that he was to report at the track-house immedia.tely to begin training for
baseball, and he well knew what that meant—to bed at 8:30 every evening,
positively no more dances, and most emphatically no more getting in at
4:00 A. M. This unlooked for ultimatum was hard on Jim, but he couldn’t
give up his baseball chances for any dance; anyhow, he must let a certain
Philadelphian know at once, and he did.

McCleary strode out of the telegraph office in no unannoyed state of
mind, and started up College Avenue in a savage condition, mentally, for he
was thinking how disappointed a certain person would?‘ be when she got his
telegram, but, as he swung into more cheery Fraternity Street, he began to
have hopes that she would u-nderstand.

As the annoyed athlete drew near the Sicc’m Fido Fraternity House, he
felt sore when he saw how brilliantly lighted it was, and the strains of music
and sounds of laughter only increased his mental anguish. He hesitated at
the steps, hating to go in, but ﬁnally decided to brave all “guying,” which
he knew would be forth-coming. He shut the front door cautiously, and,
removing his craversette and cap and throwing his books on the hall—rack,
started up the hall-stairs silently, when one of the merry bunch in the parlor
saw him.

“Ho, Jim, come here,” he cried.

“Shut up,” returned the “sour-balled” Jim.

A good‘ laugh followed his retort. He was, undoubtedly, the most pop-
ular man in the Frat, so the fellows didn’t intend to see him get away without
their having some enjoyment.

“Here’s a letter for you, old inan,” yelled ’Varsity VVilson, knowirtg this
would bring him. And it did.

“Come on, Mac, tell us what’s the matter. She’ll come to-morrow. cheer
up,” repeated VVilson.

McCleary felt that he would have to tell the fellows about it, so he began
to ﬁll his pipe to gain time. l\leanwhile the other Frat-men came in from the

f 304- l

_. -....___

den, where they had been studying—on what to bet, and the whole bunch

lounged about interestedly to hear Mac’s account of his “grouched” condition.

With a few puffs from his bull-dog, he commenced :—

“Fellows, you know how hard I have striven to make the Prom a success,
and I believe in an altruistic way that it’s going to be the greatest in the
history of Old L. Moreover, I have been counting for months on leading
the grand march with my dearest from down the state, but, fellows, I’ll have
to miss it all, for we start training for baseball at once, so I must be counted
out. I’m sorry, but you know how it is with me: my college ﬁrst, above
dances and all pleasures, so it is impossible for me to think of attending.”

All the fellows were dubious, but McCleary insisted that athletics are
athletics and that he must be in the best of condition for the trip s0utlh_
during easter vacation.

“Well, but how about your wifey ?” asked “Doggie” White. “Just think
how disappointed she will feel.” .

“I understand that, Whitey, better than you,” put in McCleary, “‘and
that’s just what makes me sore, but she’ll just have to understand or go lto
the dickens. Good-night.”

As ‘he lay tossing in bed in a state of mental perturbation his eyes
unconsciously rested on a picture of a beautiful girl, whose eyes seemed to
plead, to actually insist, and he sighed. Then, he glanced a.t a large pennant,
draped over a picture of “old main,” and he smiled contentedly, as he resolved
to let college spirit overcome strixian Terpsichore.

THE ’VARSITY COOLER FOREVER!?!?!?
I.

Had world—ru1ing Zeus, in his boyhood‘ attended
The hill top department of famous old Wup,

He never had longed for the heavenly nectar
That ﬁlled to the brim the Olympian cup.

II.

For the blood of the grape, and the life of the berry,

Or the nectar of Jove, on the palate would pall

Of one who had quaffecl from the fountain that ﬂowketh,
From the ’Varsity cooler that stands in the hall.

III.

A turnip-like ﬂavor, a feline aroma,

With tinctures of gall and of wormwoocl combined,
And commixed with the bitterest juices in nature,
To form a wild drink that can not be deﬁned.

IV.

It falls from the faucet with crystalline sparkle,
That gladdens the eye of the thirsty one there,
Whose feverish lips, opened wide for a treasure, .
Close only to ﬁnd a delusion and snare.

V.

Like a sup from the vials of the seven last angels,-
Or a brew that the heath-dwelling witches can mix,—
A ﬁendish concoction of horrible nature,—

A draught from the ﬂood of the dark rolling Styx.

VI.

I pledge you a toast in a Cup of the mixture.

A toast to the college a-top of the hill,—-

Drink, drink but a glass of this wonderful water,
It will not intoxicate (though it may kill.)

VII.

But wish while you drink that some kind guarding angel
Will pity our state, and soon banish the ill:

And bring us an up-to—date, microbe-proof ﬁlter

That joy, peace and comfort" may reign on the hill.

VIII.

So ﬁll up a bumper and do not dismay,

For the musty old? cooler will soon pass away,

And we’ll drink to old Wup in a glass full and fair
From the ’Varsity FILTER that stands by the stair.

and the College of Pharmacy joined to the institution. In 1896 the Dental
department was founded, and the true University stood proudly forth with
seven departments. About this time many valuable bequests were made.
The Misses Smith donated their valuable cabinet of mlinerological and zoolog-
ical specimens, to which they are constantly making additions. The Hon.
and Mrs. Felix Brunot gave scholarships to the amounts of $31,000. Later,
in 1897, $100,000 was received to establish a course in iMining Engineering,
while in 1898, $150,000 was received for the new observatory. In addition to
these Mr. Adam Reineman presented the Brereton mansion for a Maternity
Hospital and Mr. Isaac Kaufmann gave the Emma Kaufmann clinic for the
Medical department.

In 1900, after large success, Dr. Holland resigned. Dr. John A. Brashear,
as Acting Chancellor, now placed his best energies at the disposal of the
University. Despite the close personal attention required by his business he
devoted himself with double zeal to the new task and the new observatory,
costing about $200,000 and containing instruments costing $20,000, is a mon-
ument to his unselﬁsh love and devotion for the University.

At January 1st, 1904, Dr. Brashear was compelled by business interests
to leave his important trust. Six months later, Dr. Samuel Black McCor~
mick, D. D., LL. D., was elected Chancellor. Under his wise and vigorous
administration, the University is rapidly coming to that which it lacks——the
uniﬁcation of the University upon a single campus. The student body num-
bers over nine hundred; the faculty 140; the alumni, 2,500, of whom 2,000 are
living; the endowments approach half a million dollars, and the total prop-
erty exceeds one million.

From the present indications. the fondest hopes of the community will
soon be realized and Pittsburgh will have a University great in numbers as
it is in educational inﬂuence. »

SQUIBS.

The Medical Editor was sitting in his sanctum, which by the way is the

bannister, when a wild—eyed individual approached and said—“Run over this :”

Freddy Rhodes once had a dream
That provoked a laughing scream
From the students standing by
[Examination time was nigh]
Almost every one who laughed
Heard with glee that he had passed.
Now when everything is thru

I wish I had laughed some too——

The Editor did not faint. He only ran. But ere he had gone far, he
was overtaken by the wild—eyed contributor who addressed him somewhat

thusly:

[308]

“What would Billy Ingram do,
If it happened now that you
Suddenly took very sick,
And went running to him quick?
Would he stretch you on a table,
And as fast as he was able,
Cut away your liver, heart,
Kidneys, lung or other part;
Make a section microscopic,
Then in accents philanthropic

As you lay all in a quiver
Mourning your dissected liver,
Say, “my boy, my diagnosis
Which reveals all that know is,
Yea, I'll give my testimony

You were kicked by a ‘path’ pony.
But if you have no objections

I will make a few more sections.”

*‘°'F‘£0 P114

The editor at this point had recourse to a cocaine tablet and then
shrieked, “Lay on MacDuff,” calling forth this postlude:

“Willy Lange once said to me”
(He of sage philosophy,

Who is never else than right)

“Of all things with which we’re blest

Dissecting is the very best

For the squeamish appetite.

“When  Chris unloads his jokes
On us poor defenseless folks,
He but shows that in life’s walk
You’d best let the others talk,
Listening while they say instead,
Foolish things we might have said.”

EGLANTINE.

Eglantina, tall and fair,

With your wondrous golden hair,
Laughing eyes, with seeming grace,
Beaming from thy radiant face.

Oh, I can never tell

Of the days in forest dell,
When I thought of thee a1one—
Eglantine.

All throughout the summer day,
While the children at their play,
And the reapers binding sheaves,
And the drowsy buzzing bees
Each to each would seeming say,
Eglantine.

From stone to stone the brooklets purl,
In my brain the wild thoughts whirl,
Of life, of hopes, of love’s sad dream;
But onward flows the little stream

’It bears thee on and far away,

It leaves me here, but still I say
Eglantine.

Eglantina, tall and fair,

With your wondrous golden hair;
Laughing eyes, with seeming grace,
Beaming from thy radiant face.

AN EDITOR’S SOLILOQUY.

Here I sit me down to write with visions of neglected lessons rising be-
fore my sleep—burdened eyes, with the printer’s maledictions and demands
for copy ringing in my ears. After a weary round among the staff, met on
all sides with the reply, “No copy,” I have hied myself to my own sanctum
sanctorum, closed and locked the door, plugged up the keyhole, scratched my
head, dipped my pen in ink, and—stopped.

Before my wondering eyes in panoramic display pass my fellow—students.
Whom now shall I roast? Who is the next victim? Of course they will
never know who wrote the stuff, so it doesn’t matter what I say about them.
Some students are ridiculously foolish and sensitive anyway. When their
foibles are brought to light (only that they may see them and proﬁt thereby)
they become exceedingly wroth. For the life of me, Ican’t understand it.
But then, I suppose it is the way they were brought up. Great deal in bringing
up. Why, it changes the whole course of a person’s life. Why, there’s—but
this isn’t getting out my copy, and I must do at least ten pages to—night. I
am so tired. I with that printer was in my Ethics class and had that “double
header” to prepare for to—morrow. I guess he wouldn’t be so infermally in-
sistent and continually—Oh, yes, here’s an idea. I saw J—ck Bu-—ert and
M—ss. W—lie sitting on the steps which connect the third ﬂoor to the second—
they forgot to look around and above hem. It’s too bad that no privacy can
be had around‘ this institution. Every time a fellow wants to speak to a co-ed
there are about twenty others (I mean fellows) around, with their ears and
eyes wide open. They ought to be roasted here in the annual, but there is
not room and it would be a waste of time—besides the lessons, secondary, I
know, but important. Let me see—Ethics, English, Psychology, Pollycon—
I used to think our Psychology class was halfway decent, but since M—1l-r and

F-1--n monopolize all the time with learned arguments (P) no one else gets
a show; but then, of course, I suppose they have more cheek than the rest
of us and ought to be given their place, but a fellow does like to talk once in
awhilt, even if he doesn’t know much. Why, the other day—oh, yes, that
was the day we worked Dr. H y by asking him questions till it was too
late for him to throw any back at us. We were happy, but next day he sprung
a quiz at us. (We felt different.) Oh! the Junior Class is pretty decent, and
if there weren’t so many Seniors and Sophs sandwiched into our classes we
could make a star record; as it is, we get the blame for all their dullness and
mischief-making. By the «way, isn’t R 11 an orator—and to hear him re-
cite in Ethics would almost raise the hair on a ba1d—headed man. ‘When he
looks over those nose-glasses in that learned way 0-f his one would think he
was full of the subject (but he isn’t). Oh, shucks! here my mind is run-
ning off again, and ‘by Jove! its eleven o’clock, and my winkers won’t stay
open. Here’s where I follow the usual line of “least resistance” and go to
bed, leaving the ten pages for to—morrow.

\ Q

 

A bachelor may eat onions in peace.

The chaﬁng dish is a close friend to the bachelor.

Seeking equality with man, woman sinks to his level.

VVhen a boy begins to get love letters he combs his hair.

A true man is first a bachelor and afterwards a husband.

Love is an intoxicant, and marriage the delirium tremens.

A married man lives in the future, the bachelor in the past.

The more positive the bachelor, the better husband he makes.

A bachelor will never have to atone for the sin of lying to his wifq.

A bachelor laughs at marriage, but he envies the married man’s home.

If a bachelor is in love he does not wait to fall. It takes too long a time.

ln these doubtful days you can’t even trust red hair to be what it seems.

If fewer girls would trump their partner’s ace there would ‘be more mar-
riages.

A bachelor envies the man whose wife lets him smoke when and where
he pleases.

Tell a woman she is beautiful and she may not believe you; but she will
like you.

People go ballooning when they get engaged. They fall out when they
get married.

A woman has but two ages. She is either under twenty-ﬁve, or she is over
forty—ﬁve.

The worst slur one woman puts on another is when she says, “Anyway,
she makes him a good wife.”

[315]

*5V£0HI4

*°'F‘£0P1I-4

When a woman has something she must conﬁde she goes to a bachelor,
and not another woman.

Women will never lose their feminine attributes as long as there is a‘

large supply of looking glasses in the world.

You can’t marry a woman and keep your ideals about her any more than
you can eat your cake and yet have it.

 

SLANG.

By Jonathan Hayseeds, C. E.

Slang is the child of Exaggeration and Wit, an’ takes after both parents
b-ein’ slovenly after remote ancestry.

Slang is on the principle that you can get there quicker by goin’ cross
lots, even if you do look mussed up.

Slang generally hits the bull’s eye, but kicks so hard that folks with
delicate organisms hesitate to shoot.

Slang is s’posed to have moved in somewhere’s from out West, a'n~.’ has
settled down almost everywhere except in reﬁned circles an’ Boston.

Slang will thrive almost anywhere, like Canada thistles an’ bunions.

Cupid——Pierces each heart with a tiny arrow (in Magie’s place an excep-

Scene II.—Pier.

The Distant Re1ative—-Splashing and sputtering in the lake and crying

Girl—Weeping and wailing.

Hero—Calmly removes hat and coat, arranges his cravat, runs to the

pier and dives~— —— —— —— —— ——— —~

I’d like to leave Magie hanging between the water and sky, but the truth
must be told. Magie entered the water like a darning needle, but that was
not all. The water was only eighteen inches deep, and the oozy mud was
just laying for such marks, and received him with open arms.

A derrick and a four—horse team extracted Magic from his own-made
grave, and with a low bow to the Distant Relative, who, meanwhile had
calmly walked ashore, he went damply up to the hotel murmuring:

“None but the brave deserve the fair.”

AN VEPISODE.

Mr. and Mrs. Coffin request Mr. Young’s
evening, April twenty. Time six o’clock.
R. V. S. P.

presence at dinner, Friday

5:45 P. M.——Young is frantically overturning bureau draw-ers, upsetting
trunks, overhauling closets and exploring every inch of stair, ceiling and
ﬂoor room trying vainly to ﬁnd a “Dress Shirt.”

5 :5o.——No shirt !— !— !— !—-ee!
5:55.——Still no shirt! No studs! Nothing except black laundry studs.
It dawns the maid has carefully gathered up said belongings for the

“washerwoman.”

A few moments of situation——dilemma——retrospect—strategy—anything
to the rescue.

5:59.—Telephon-e. Jack, studs? shirts? No!
unfeelingly departs dinnerwards.

6:oo.——Desperation——d-etermination—Phone again, could Bill lend, make,
beg, steal——Y0ung—studs, etc. (?)—“Yes.”

6:Io.——Arrive at Bill’s minus breath. temper and swear-words.

Grand transformation.

6:3o.———Is seated at table (being the last of the guests to arrive.) Wo11~
ders why he’s not the lion of the evening. Soup is cold, hostess haughty.

Moral.—Don’t be late to dinner if you wish to make an impression.

MRS. MEECHEN’S HAIR RESTORER.

“Read Our Testimonials.”
Mrs. Meechen,
Dear Madam:

I have obtained astounding results by frequent repetitions of trea.tment by
the use of your hair tonic. I at present regard; myself as the greatest living
testimonial to your genius. My luxuriant hair varies in length from 3 to 6
inches and that, too, with bi-weekly tonsorial attention. It stands aloft in
any position I prefer, having become most docile in nature. In fact I imagine
I have shattered upwards of one dozen girlish hearts and wounded many
others, simply by intermittent exhibition of my attractive poll. I also speak
louder, show my'one hundred and forty teeth better, look more thoughtful
and feel better satisﬁed with my personal apperance than ever before. Accept
gratitude.

Sincerely yours,
Prof. George.

Dear Madam :—

I am secretary of the VVestern University of Pennsylvania.
I am a self-made man, and am willing to assume the responsibility.
I take great pleasure in attributing to your hair invigorator a great part of
the success of my ambitious strivings. Your remedy has given my hair a
healthy, Hebrew curl, whose gloss is due entirely to applications of your spe-
cial hair grease. My hair is my passport into the higher circles toward which
I naturally gravitate, and I’m sure adds greatly to my self-made dignity.
Sincerely, _
]. Ralph Park.

Mrs. Meechem,
Adorable Madam:

It is with the most extreme felicitation and the most exquisite and
ethereal joy that I am permitted thru my amanuensis to express to your-
self my extreme gratitude for the blessed relief afforded by your adorab-lie
rejuvenator of cephlic (adornment. The sole interruption in my ﬂow
of thanksgiving is occasioned‘, Madami, by the fact that some minute m-is-
apprehension of the application of your remedy resulted in my imbibing your
rejuvenator internally and it is with extreme discomfort that I discover in
addition to the healthy growth from the cephalic cuticle, a disproportionality
luxurious harvest in the seat of my digestive apparatus, which interferes
seriously with the process of digestion and nutrition.

Relying on your eleemosynary disposition of mind I beg your indulgence
in the forwarding of some counter-irritant, with appropriate appreciation.

I am, yours sincerely,
“Charlie.”

West Penn. Medical College.
Dear Mrs. Meecham:——

Of course it is against the rules of the medical profession to use patent
medicines, but my hair had been getting thinner and thinner, despite repeated
massage with a Recipe of Tr. of cantharides and O1. of Ricini; so one day
I got a bottle of your restorer. I had with me a bottle of conc. HNO3 with
which I intended to make some albumin tests. As soon as I got home I
uncorked a bottle and with its contents began to massage my calvarium. I
fortis. Clothed as I was I jumped into a bath tub of water but without effect.
My hair came off en masse. But in some unexplicable manner the bottle of
your restorer became uncorked in my pocket and permeated the bath. The
result was astonishing. My natural hair, however. is gotuie forever.

Respectfully,
Robert Hipsley.

THAT TOTALLY DIFFERENT CLOTHING FOR MEN.

Our Totally Different Clothing for Men is as different from other ready-
made clothing as skillful workmanship and ﬁnest materials can make it.

\\’e are not satisﬁed with using all—wool materials, but we exact it that
patterns shall be exclusive.
in our collection of clothing.

Old patterns or commo11 patterns are not seen

Another feature about which we are very particular is the ﬁt. No cus-
tom tailor can boast of better ﬁtting clothes than those we sell to men.

Time after time men come into our Clothing Department who have al-
ways had their clothes made to 0rder—they enter in a skeptical mood, but
they leave ardently in favor of our line of clothing.

Now don't imagine that our clothing is high priced because it is
high in merit. V\7e sell clothing very near to cost, as you will ﬁnd if you
order a suit or a topcoat from us.

If you have been accustomed to wearing
Rogers-Peet Clothing, we are pleased to advise
that we are ready to serve you, as we have

the exclusive sale of this famous line in Pittsburgh.

OUR HABERDASHERY is another department that is very popular with
men who are particular about their clothes. The London and Paris
styles are always shown here ﬁrst.

Then there is the HAT STORE with its unequalled line of men’s hats.
Prominent among them the well—1iked Stetson hats.

but many activities. As a student he has out-
grown the name. Conservative and strictly re-
ligious—never drank, cursed or clenched a ﬁst.
“He will stand without hitching.” '

OLIVER HENRY FULTON.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Praise him with music and harp.”

Oliver at home, Henry at church, Fulton at
the ‘Musical Union, and Tooter at school. Like
all musicians he is noisy, but generally on time.
Most of his discords are in the class room, where
he invariably adds to his doubtful answers: “Is
it not?” His tongue has acquired many of the
harmonies of his horn, and he is a one—man—l)and
in the presence of ladies.

EDWARD MCKEE GOLDEN.
Pittsburgh, Pa.
“They always talk who never think.”

“Pop,” or in common parlance, “Hot—air mer-
chant,” is a lad of strange ingenuity. He repre-
sents the doubtful combination of a lawyer,
preacher and rniner—he is red-headed and hope-
ful. His strongest inclination is toward the
West, where he hopes to gather gold from the
sunset. Strictly studious, but not any too exact.
A ‘hair-lip.

MISS CHARLOTTE DAISY RICHARDSON.
Allegheny, Pa.
“She was a phantom of delight.”

HOMER CARPENTER RENTON.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“The man with a new idea is a crank until the
idea succeeds.”

If old man Homer could” only come to V\/. U.
P.! Judging from the number of irons he keeps
in the ﬁre, Renton will eventually become a
blacksmith. He is best in the lead, as he won’t
work double. Great at pulling wires, providing
they are attached to the Chancellor’s office. Very
fair and honest with his fellows; believes that
the University is revolving around his head.

ROBERT LEE VANN.
Boston, Mass.

“Procrastination is a thief of time.” (So is a
stubborn printer.”)

Vann is a youth of unbounded imagination, un-
limited exaggeration, and unsophisticated equiv-
ocation; consequently he has made a business of
journalism; has a jaunty air and a step like a
ballet dancer; often mistaken for Mark Twain in
his writings.

MISS LILLIAN MARIE WYLIE.
Wilkinsburg, Pa.

“A very gentle one and of good conscience.”

ELMER HENRY BRUNNER.
Allegheny, Pa.

“A little learning is a dangerous thing.”

Brunner and Socrates make a happy team.
They differ, however, in one respect. Socrates
declared that he knew nothing, while Elmer in-
sists that he knows a “little” about things in
spots. V\/ith one fortune we may credit him:
he has the advantage of his age; a budding gen-
ius, liable to stumble upon a new idea one of these
days.

CLARENCE HALLER HARLAN.
Allegheny, Pa.
“Hitch your wagon to a star.”

Some men know more than they can explain;
some explain more than they know; and some
have neither quality. Harlan is a combination
of the three. Good fellow, and optimistic or he
would have never challenged his course. Not a
society man yet—father objects.

MORRIS HANDELMAN.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“In all thy getting, get understanding.”

Inquisitive, curious and anxious fellow is Han-
delman. Must have a whole loaf or nothing.
"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”"
Small in stature, but a Hercules in imaginations.
A peculiar combimation of curiosity and indif-
ference. Has but one purpose in speaking to a
man—simply to learn his name.

GILBERT ROSS MILLER.
Butler Pa.

“Some men remind us of angles—they are so
different.”

Gilbert is the lad who has been called “Rough
House Miller.” Not so bad as he looks. He
acts on the spur of the moment—his greatest
task is to make up his mind. A man of many vir-
tues which, by the way, is his only vice. He be-
longs also to the herbivorous class of bipeds,
only he doesn°t swallow the juice.

ROBERT THORNTON MCCLELLAND.
Idlewood, Pa.

“Be ye also ready.”

Mac is the lad that moves the country into the
city every morning. A daily ride on the train
makes him appear business-like. Full of energy
because there is no outlet for its escape. Never
surprised in his life; expects everything before
it happens. Not lazy, but naturally tired.

RALPH GEORGE SCHAEFER AA
Allegheny, Pa.

“Little, but oh, my!”

Schaefer got his massive (?) build from work-
ing on a farm; a patron of the terpsichorcan art;
genuine bluffer and skillful ﬂimmer. Schaefer
lost his fatl1er——\V. McKee—last year; since that
time he has picked up and has seemed more like
a man; distinguishing characteristics are a dark
complexion and a masculine voice.

GUY FRANKLIN SILLIMAN.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Mary had a little lamb.” (Sung by request.)

Franklin was certainly named after he had
grown up—the appropriateness of Guy! A Silli-
man? No; not any more silli than any other
man. Not burdened with gray matter, that is,
the fertilized gray. Sees everything through his
glasses darkly. Not proud but rather reluctant
in bending his vertebral column.

ERNEST SUCCOP TAYLOR.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Politeness is written in Greek to me.”

Ernest is the “tertium quid” of this family.
Looks very much concerned; takes everything
to himself. His short trousers and his piquant
nose make him appear clownish, which by the
way, is in splendid but unfortunate congruity
with ‘his nature. About twelve more years in
school would almost round him out for society.

WILLIAM WELWOOD GILL.
Wilkinsburg, Pa.

“Truth is simple, requiring neither study nor art.”

Gill is a ladies’ 1nan—he seeks the best——
preachers’ daughters. Perhaps this fact accounts
for his pre—occupied look and self-sufficient man-
ner. He can be distinguished blocks away by
that ostrich—like stride. He is classed among
the Seniors from personal choice rather than be-
cause of ability or Faculty sanction.

WALTER JOHNSON WELDIN AK
Greensburg, Pa.

“Prudence is a mighty good virtue.”

VValter deserves great credit for the tremen-
dous advance he has 1nade in three years. From
a pusillanimous coxcomb he has been pushed
up to within walking distance of manhood. For
varied experiences he excels Robinson Crusoe;
only one thing he lacks—apprehension. Unlike
many he has not caught the big-head—has not
advanced far enough. Good fellow, though.

CLARENCE BLISS WYNNE.
Shousetown, Pa.

“A loose and strong deﬁer of all order.”

Clarence is not so bad—just a little naughty
at times; very obedient when the Chancellor
speaks. Thinks free speech should be cultivated
—hence his continuous blathering. Rather lanky,
too; a strenuous follower of the Marsh school.

ALBERT JOHN ENDSLEY WILSON, Jr.
Allegheny, Pa.
“Come ye disconso1ate.”
Albert thinks John is Endsley’s rival, but Wil-
son has none. Polite in the extreme; has 21 won-
derful reten.'tive power—conseqnently he stores

what he learns. He is also philosophic—can
make the worse appear the better reason.

 

[68]

FRANK NOBLE ADAMS.
Allegheny, Pa.

“Every man is odd.”

Noble Adams is one man who is Frank enough
to admit his intimacy with the French Briar. The
only fault he keeps secret is his partial inclina-
tion to Cut Plug. Quiet, sincere and obliging in
theory, l)ut in practice quite oblivious of his vir-
tues.

HOWARD GEORGE MARSH.
Allegheny, Pa.

“—But sideburns are a man’s own fault.”

Marsh is the fastest liver of the class; with
him it is race—horse weather in 1907. He is
W’. L‘. P."s author of a vest pocket slang pamph-
let, entitled: “Printed but not published.” Great
sport, too; shaves bi-weekly and shines his
boots quarterly. Has not such an imposing ap-
pearance, but a disposition! that won't down.
Studious, but not particular.

CHARLES MULHEIM,
West Bridgewater, Pa.

“Was he created or did he just happen?”

“Mullie” is better known as the middleweight
champion of the pony riders, an art he acquired
on the farm. Likes city life, but always takes
on too much of it. His family characteristic is
the smile that won’t come off. He has almost
learned to smoke a pipe, too. Has made wonder-
ful progress under the tutelage of Marsh. H

WILLIAM CHARLES REUTER.
Allegheny, P-a.
“Why he, a harmless, necessary parasite.”

Reuter can, without blemish, be termed the
politician of the class. The only objection to his
politics is his ﬂexible nature, which is always
questionable. As a student he spends all his
time on his books, consequently he has no time
for recitations. Has a business-like appearance,
but lacks energy. He has a peculiar attractive-
ness which, by the way, commands admiration.

EDWARD LANGSDORFE TRUXAL.
Braddock, Pa.

“Men should be what they seem.”

Truxal can not complain of ﬂattery, either sub-
jectively or objectively. Few men have his cont»
servative appearance. Strictly religious and
somewhat familiar with the curriculum, tho not
with the beneﬁts thereof. For ready wit and
an uncompromising idealism his equal is impos-
sible. Ed is a college gentleman without a pipe.

EDWARD HENRY WERNER.
Emsworth, Pa.

“But the tongue can no man tame.”

Werner carries with him a massive cranium,
not however i11 striking contrast with ‘his nether
extremities. Has a good but nbt beautiful set
of teeth; very conversant in chapel. Obliging if
he has any more than what is in his mouth. A
natural born engineer.

ROBERT WHYTE AA
Allegheny, Pa.

“Oh, reason! thou hast ﬂed to brutish beasts!”

\/Vhyte is the impossibility of the class; he
thinks himself the sine quo non. He is deserving
of a great deal more than the world will take time
to give him. A good student, but a poor reciter.
Very Choice in language—a perfect incubator of
witticisms.

ALLAN PERCY BENDER.
Allegheny, Pa.

“Modesty is the lowest of virtues.”

Bender is rather an attractive individual;
pleasant in company because he never has any-
thing to say; quick to grasp an idea and as quick
to lose it; fervent in the spirits and constantly
regardless of the seasons. For these traits, pe-
culiar to ‘himself, he Was elected to the presi-
dency of the class, tho he never held the gavel.

RUSH LUCKET DAUGHERTY,
Allegheny, Pa.

“You never miss the water till the well runs dry.”

Rush is not as aggressive as his name sug-
gests. His quaint maxim is: “Never look trouble
"till trouble looks you." He is most sincere when
he looks the least concerned. Never speaks un-
less called upon. Very quiet by nature. but not
infrequently so by necessity.

WAYNE STOKES MITCHELL.
Beaver, Pa.

“Honesty is the best policy.”

Much of a gentleman is “Stokes.”He has a
wonderfully developed sense of Oughtness. He
thinks a man ought to pass exams. if ‘he has to
use the pony and his mother never argues the
question—says that’s a good way to betray ig-
norance. Not sporty, but a simple lover.

EDWARD KUHN PRICE AK
Allegheny, Pa.
“The cat came back.”

Pop. Price might pass for a sage. He is scrupu-
lously neat and is far in advance of the class,
both by nature and practice, especially the lat-
ter. Tried to take a ministerial course but failed,
then he took engineering for spite. Has no re~
ligious dogmas; believes a man’s a man for a’
that.

CLYDE HENDERSON CAMPBELL.
Allegheny, Pa.

‘‘All the world loves a lover.’’

Clyde is a full grown man—never mind his
looks——and has a wonderful insight into matters.
Microbes and Bacteria are visible objects to him
(with his glasses on). Exceedingly conversant
in the presence of ladie.. Not handsome, but
Winsome.

JAMES EDWARD JOHNSTON, AK
Beaver Falls, Pa.

“Every man shall give an account of himself.”

Yes; J. E. J. Same thing either way you read
him. As constant as the stars that shoot every
night. Strictly scientiﬁc; can swear in waltz
time; classical in religion, and in society purely
mechanical. He is without any honorary epi-
thet—simply Mr. Johnston.

EDWARD CAREY TRAX AK
Venetia, Pa.

“The ladies call him sweet.
The stairs, as he treads them, kiss his feet.”

Trax is the lucky lad who has been honored
with an agnomen. “Sue ” serves as well as Carey.
He has the stupid disease known! to us as “Ante-
grinni0sis”—never smiles. Nice fellow; not the
kid—g1oVe kind, but the go-so—far—and-no—further
type. Reliable because he is a chemist; free from
anger. Uses H2504 to precipitate his temper.

EDWARD WALTER RICHARD BUTCHER.
Pittsburgh, Pa.
“I beseech you, what manner of man is he?”

He had better butcher some of these names or
he may expect homicide between Ed and Dick
some day. Butcher is not as skillful a manipula-
tor of the balances as his name suggests, nor is
he especially well versed in the culinary art. He
does, however. butcher up a recitation now and
then, but he is a conscientious lad; polite and
smooth in manner. Not nervous, but habitually
uneasy.

 

GRIFFITH WILLIAMS LINDSAY,
Allegheny, Pa.

“He was the mildest mannered man

That ever scuttled a ship or cut a throat.”

Lindsay is the man of letters as the Banner
indicates. V\/on(derfully original and a gentleman
of caliber not to be questioned. Mild in manner
——almost too mild to join chapel prayers—says
them to himself. Takes everyb0dy’s advice and
then pursues his own choice.

NEWMAN HALL BENNETT, A. B. AK‘?
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“For my voice, I have lost it with the hollaing
and singing of anthems.”

Bennett would say “hanthems,” but of course
that means the same thing. He is not much for
’ot h’air, but his liquid tenor voice quite charmed
the nurses at the South Side Hospital, where he
substituted last summer. A white man.

IRA DAVID BOWSER, ‘PX
Reynoldsville, Pa.
“His hair is of a good color, an excellent

Ira hails from the Northern wilds and his
ruddy face and “reddy” hair bespeak humor and

FREDERICK WILLIAM BREMER.

CHARLES STANLEY ECKER, A. B., AK‘?

“He matched their beauties,

“Eck,” like other noted men bearing the name

not but that he is a favorite with the “gentle
