GREEN SBURG CAMPUS

Route 119 forms the main thoroughfare in Greensburg. It is
nothing more than this to the road—weary motorist passing
through, looking for the green signs directing him to the New
Stanton entrance of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. To the resi-
dents, however, Route l19 is Main Street. Running parallel
to Main is Maple Avenue, where classes at the Greensburg
campus of the University of Pittsburgh are under way.

A red brick facade and stately white pillars ﬂank the main
entrance to the building. Fresh beige, brown and yellow paint
cover the colonial architecture. Five classrooms furnished in
chrome—trimmed brightly colored desks, and the director’s
oﬂices on the carpeted second ﬂoor, make up the work area
of the campus.

A glance at the crowd in the basement lounge reveals that
at Greensburg the accent is not on youth. Part—time students
predominate, and the median age is probably closer to thirty
than twenty. The faces here identify themselves as the man
working for the corporate image, or the woman who left
some smaller images at home.

Pitt at Greensburg is a building, students and faculty; it is
something Greensburg has this year that it did not have last
year. The light, freshly-painted walls have not yet been mel-
lowed by ﬁngerprints; the brand-new yellow and turquoise
desks have no initials carved upon them. But the compact,
fresh building is alive with undergraduates of many ages,
joining together to establish stronger traditions, to achieve
higher goals than can be evidenced by physical signs of use.
They are there, clean and ready as their school, with open
minds and hard senses of purpose to attain a Pitt education.

J OHNSTOWN
CAMPUS

Since its founding in 1927, Johnstown College—the
pioneer regional of the University——has opened its
doors to over 20,000 students. Johnstown, located in
the Moxham area of the Flood City, has no grass cam-
pus; the campus is aspha1t—and this has become a
standing joke. But joke all they want about an asphalt
campus, Johnstown students will readily admit sprawl-
ing green plots don’t always sprout quality instruction.

With a 5-to-1 sex ratio staring them in the face, men
ﬁnd Johnstown College an ideal place for studying.
Although engineers have traditionally outnumbered
students in other scholastic ﬁelds of study, a trend,
begun with the advent of the ’60’s, has broadened stu-
dent thinking in many ways. Social fraternities and a
sorority provide extracurricular interest, as does the
Student Congress.

Tight quarters and close classrooms seem to encour-
age the closeness of interpersonal relations among both
students and faculty. They share classes with nurse
trainees from Memorial Hospital School of Nursing and
with evening students in general studies.

They think about the University with its green lawns
and spiraling Cathedral. They think . . . some day in
the not too distant future an institutional unit will be
erected on a l36—acre campus site in Richland Town-
ship overlooking Johnstown. Some day Johnstown will
have green lawns.

A geology class now discusses igneous rocks under the watchful gaze
of a hand-painted mural covering the ceiling. Where carriages once
awaited their horses, students browse or scribble notes for a paper in
French or chemistry. Antiques languish in the midst of rustling note-
book pages; hand—carved marble ﬁreplaces share rooms with Bunsen
burners. This constant union of past and present, of aesthetic and edu-
cational, characterizes the tightly—knit members of the Titusville
campus. It is a small school in unique surroundings, attempting to
establish itself ﬁrmly and yet not to stagnate.

The quiet elegance of the past does not slow the hopes and ambi-
tions for the future at Pitt’s Titusville campus. With each trimester
enrollment increases, despite competition from longer-established
schools nearby. The central program offered here is a two—year under-
graduate one; students are then encouraged to continue their education
and receive their degree at the Oakland campus.

Titusville is an infant school with a tremendous will to grow, and
an impressive contribution to make to its community. At one time the
town achieved fame from its revolutionary Drake oil well, the ﬁrst
such commercial venture in the country. Now it faces the severe eco-
nomic burden of the gradual decline in the oil industry, and the re-
sultant unemployment. Pitt at Titusville hopes to help. There are plans
for technical re-training programs which should serve to encourage
new industry and provide an efﬁcient available work force. Hard at
work in their mansion, the faculty and students at Titusville are ma-
turing to meet the challenges and rewards which their own town offers.

THE
CHANCELLOR

 

 

To the newsreading public, as well as to
the Pitt student himself, Chancellor Litch—
ﬁeld and ‘the University are almost inter-
changeable words. Alumni who gradu-
ated before the Chancellor arrived here
do not recognize the University, and are
awed by the new spirit-——the dynamism
emanating from Dr. Edward H. Litch—
ﬁeld and enveloping the University of
Pittsburgh.

The keynote this year has been pro-
gress: the regional campuses began oper-
ation; the University extended its scope

 

 

beyond national boundaries; centers for
research into space, into learning, into
knowledge availability systems all be-
came realizable goals; the trimester sys-
tem was strengthened by increased em-
phasis on the Spring Trimester; the Oak-
land Corporation continued its redevel-
opment efforts; and the social conscience
of the entire academic community was
activated by new strides in the ﬁeld of
human rights.

At the heart of all this, serving both to
inspire and to accomplish these wide-
spread and far—reaching projects, is the
Chancellor himself, named Pittsburgh’s
1963 “Man of the Year.” His ideas, his
ability to recognize the right people to
help carry them out, his,untiring passion
for economic, social and educational
progress, and his magnetic, almost
hypnotic, personal intensity are the
source of the progress. The University is
the fortunate beneﬁciary.

 

105
Pitt absorbed, reﬂected, and contributed to the spirit of
the year. The atmosphere was electric with plans and
dreams zooming to fruition. Streamlined architecture be-
came the tangible sign of a growing, forward-looking, far-
reaching scope of activity and interest which smouldered
down from the highest administrative levels to envelop a
newly-dynamic University. It and its leaders shouldered
the responsibility newly incumbent upon a breed deter-
mined to exploit its talent and vitality for the broadest
social good. It and its people assumed the individual bur-
den of search, the classic quest of education.

THE
ADMINISTRATION

A University education is a total
experience for the undergraduate
—its scope and interest spread
far beyond the bounds of the
classroom. The University recog-
nizes and encourages as wide as
possible a range of activities and
interests, and provides those to
whom encouraging them is a full
time occupation and goal.

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, serving
as the Assistant Chancellor of
Student Affairs, attempts to co-
ordinate student activities to
provide scope and balance. It is
he who holds the pursestrings of
extracurricular campus organiza-
tions, and has the authority to
encourage or discourage new
projects and ideas.

Miss Helen Poole Rush, serv-
ing as both Dean of Students
and Dean of Women, welcomes
students to her warm twelfth
ﬂoor office to share concerns of
personal or general student wel-
fare. From her office emanate
dormitory and sorority rules and
policies, and freshman orienta-
tion programs; she encourages
student opinion and ideas to up-
date and improve these aspects
of student life.

Dr. William B. Crafts, Dean
of Men, is the source of personal
guidance and regulation of all
men students. His office guides
fraternity and dormitory policy,
and publishes a list of approved
off—campus housing.

THE UNIVERSITY through

its varied schools. . .

What distinguishes a University from other institutions of
learning is the breadth and depth of available education. The
University is the originator, depository and disseminator of
knowledge in all areas of human endeavor. Traditionally, the
University was an institution outside the pressures and confines
of the swirl of common life.

But times, feelings and responsibilities have shifted, and the
University is among the vanguard which recognizes, and is
attempting to deal with, this fact. The University of Pittsburgh,
through its varied schools, is fast becoming a leader in both
research and speciﬁc, immediate projects to raise the educa-
tional, social and economic level of citizens of the world; these
are vast, University goals, and are realizable only through the
interest and cooperation of each of its individual schools.

Giving the schools a raison d’étre is the student himself,
arriving day and night to learn economics and law, physics and
medicine, political science and international government. The
student selects his ﬁeld, and performs his chosen tasks in a
laboratory, at a typewriter, in a slum neighborhood, at a nu-
clear reactor, or in an elementary school classroom. The
impetus for it all comes from the schools which combine forces
to be the University of Pittsburgh.

THE SCHOOL OF
THE LIBERAL ARTS

 

As a tool of explanation in liberal arts courses, the word
“dichotomy” seems to have been extraordinarily popular this
year. Perhaps no more appropriate word could be found, not
only to instruct, but to describe the liberal arts undergradu-
ate. On the one hand, there can be found within this largest
subgroup of students, interest in every ﬁeld of knowledge; on
the other, the kinship between the theoretical math student
and the poet can only be attributed to their common mem-
bership in this one school. This unity—diversity paradox
builds understanding and sympathy, yet crystallizes individu-
ality; it widens horizons as it delineates boundaries.

During his ﬁrst four trimesters in this school, the under-
classman darts from Freshman Composition to Psych 80; he
hovers in the Tuck Shop and, eventually, lands in the library.
He worries about his new dorm-mates or about his fellow
trolley-riders; he unravels inscrutible requirements for distri-
bution of studies. And he ﬁnds himself surrounded by people
he suddenly wants to know.

There are bull sessions and mentor groups where he talks;
Midday Series and convocations, where he listens; panel dis-
cussions and recitation sections, where he questions. He
learns that professors are approachable and that upperclass-
men are confused.

Then, suddenly, he is an upperclassman and spends hours
in lines changing majors. Shall I be Einstein or Plato? Meade
or Albee? Whatever the choice, he is still surrounded by
those following other paths, vastly divergent yet leading to a
common end. Somehow he has selected his path, and delves
deeper to discover where he is going. He seldom ﬁnds out
before he graduates, and this worries and excites him. The
future becomes immediate; he feels inadequate. But there is
something which drives him, tempts him on. Lacking techni-
cal knowledge in one speciﬁc ﬁeld, he has become aware of
the complexities and subtleties of the human experience. He
is not yet a scientist or statesman; he is a humanist, an
adventurer. His not knowing allows him the freedom to ﬁnd
out——which, in itself, is a dichotomy.

Albert B. Martin, Dean

Students in the Schools of Engineering and Mines are
most densely concentrated in the heart of the Upper
Campus, part way up the steel hill north of the Cathe-
dral. This is where the complex of engineering buildings
is; it is the focus of their life at Pitt. Yet the hill does
not separate them completely from the mainstream of
life on campus. If for no other reason, they are forced
to come down the hill for many of their classes; the
curricula in Engineering and Mines require that the
graduate be a knowledgeable social citizen as well as a
proﬁcient engineer. Thus, engineers thread their way
down to the main campus for English, social and nat-
ural science courses.

In the cluster of buildings on the hill, the entering
freshman spends four years becoming proﬁcient in
Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical, Pe-
troleum, Metallurgical or Aerospace Engineering. After
the initial discovery of Engineering Hall itself, the stu-
dent’s next landmark is State Hall, where all freshmen
study Engineering Graphics. Gradually, the mechanical
engineers drift toward Thaw Hall; the electrical engi-
neers to Pennsylvania Hall, and the mining engineers to
the Mineral Industries Building. Long evenings take
them all back to the seventh ﬂoor of Engineering
Hall——the school’s library.

Come graduation day, engineers are the most envied wane, R, -rurkes, Acting Dean
students in the procession. They have a wide range of
career possibilities for which their specialized education
has trained them; in recent years, there have been two
to three times as many opportunities as there have been
graduates to ﬁll them. Many continue on with graduate
work in their ﬁeld of specialization, while others use
their engineering background as a foundation for ca-
reers in medicine, law or business. Openings in industry
and government beckon, and opportunities for research
abound for Pitt engineers.

THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION

Searching, experimenting and learning how best to educate is
the life work here. But how to approach knowledge? To
whom to direct it?

The School of Education attempts to provide the compre-
hensive preparation necessary to satisfy these goals; only
with a broad background, yet specialized training, can pro-
spective teachers forge new and better paths toward their
teaching goals.

The development of the individual pupil is the theme of
the teacher’s training. But the paths to the goal are almost as
varied as the students themselves. Should the map—maker be
Dewey or Plato? Should practical conveyance be a teaching
machine, a programmed textbook, an instructional color
movie? There are no pat answers; the School of Education
provides an understanding of these problems, and leaves the
answers to be found by the individuals.

After two years as a liberal arts student, the novice in the
School of Education begins his Contact with learning from
the other point of view. The student learns theory and applies
it; he plans lessons and learns to run slide—projectors, visits
schools and observes Team Teaching, and ﬁnally steps in to
do it all himself. He begins student teaching. He sharpens his
red pencil and purchases a little black leather book and
spends nights correcting ninety—two test papers. Three red
pencils and ﬁfteen weeks later, the apprentice is deemed
ready to map his own trip. The University of Pittsburgh’s
School of Education has shown him the signposts and taught
him the manual of instructions, but only experience will
teach him to drive.

Virginia G. Braley, Dean

With a broad study of the Liberal Arts behind her, the
Pitt junior enters the School of Nursing to take her
place in a program designed to prepare her to function
effectively in the areas of clinical nursing practice, nurs-
ing education, nursing administration, and nursing re-
search. No matter which ﬁeld she chooses, the Pitt
nurse will carry with her the ability for critical judg-
ments, the readiness for leadership and responsibility,
and the high quality of education which will allow her
to make a unique contribution to the Nursing profes-
sion.

During her first trimester, the junior discovers, to her
shock, that her ﬁrst injection is given, not to an orange,
but to a classmate. If her patient-centered approach at
first seems a bit off-center, she soon becomes adept at
integrating emotional and physical needs in providing
her patients with complete nursing care.

Having acquired fundamental nursing skills and a
basic knowledge of medical—surgical nursing at the Vet-
eran’s Administration Hospital, the student moves on
to other medical center hospitals for specialized train-
ing.

After three years of concentrated study, the white
uniform of the graduate nurse replaces the navy blues
of the Pitt student.

 

THE SCHOOL OF
PHARMACY

For the 98 students enrolled in the School of Pharmacy
in 1963-64, the ﬁve year program became a reality. No
longer a dream for the future, the liberally—educated
pharmacist is now evolving. Under the new program,
all students enter the School of Pharmacy after two
years of intensiﬁed liberal arts curriculum.

There is an unusually close professor-student rela-
tionship here; the common interest, the advancement of
the profession of pharmacy, is dominant in the wishes
of both professor and student, and unites them.

The pharmacy student has many choices of extracur-
ricular outlets for his interest. There are three pharma-
ceutical fraternities——Kappa Psi, Phi Delta Chi, and
Alpha Zeta Omega. A pharmaceutical sorority, Lambda
Kappa Sigma, exists for the women pharmacy students.
A student branch of the American Pharmaceutical As-
sociation acts as a bridge between the student body and
graduate pharmacists. Should a student be interested in
journalism, he may join the staff of the Pharmacy
School magazine, The Pitt Capsule. Two members from
the School of Pharmacy represent the student body in
the campus Student Government.

With the increased sense of freedom comes an in-
creased degree of responsibility. The pharmacy student
is required to complete courses in all of ﬁve basic
ﬁelds: pharmacy administration, pharmacy, pharma-
ceutical chemistry, pharmaognosy, and pharmacology.

Through these required courses, his own reading,
and discussion with practicing pharmacists, the pharm-
acy student graduates with a broad liberal arts back-
ground, a thorough understanding of general health in-
formation, and a speciﬁc concentration upon and dedi-
cation to his own area in the health professions.

   

Joseph A. Bianculli, Dean

THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY

Treatment, prevention and research are the broad
areas within which the varied activities of the
School of Dentistry are planned and carried out.
Primary in promoting oral health is a ﬁrm under-
standing of the relationship between dentistry and
the other health professions.

Located in the heart of the sprawling complex
of schools, hospitals and clinics, all dedicated to
the promotion of increasingly sophisticated meth-
ods of dealing with disease, the School of Dentist-
ry contributes to the Health Center; its students
learn from it.

The twelve stories of Scaife Hall are ﬁlled by
students in the four Health Professions: Medi-
cine, Pharmacy, Nursing, and Dentistry. This is
where the freshman and sophomore dental stu-
dents receive their preclinical instruction, provid-
ing them with knowledge they will later put to
practice at various University-associated hospitals.

The course of study in the School of Dentistry
ordinarily spans the four years between the time
the liberal arts graduate enters the school, and
when he leaves it with his D.D.S. An intensiﬁed
seven year program is also available whereby the
liberal arts and dental courses are combined, so
that the student graduates with both a B.S. and a
D.D.S. and has a year’s head start in establishing
his practice.

While in the School itself, there are a number
of organizations which reflect the interests of the
future dentists. There is a Student American Den-
tal Association, a Dental Student Council, and a
Dental Interfraternity Council, under whose juris-
diction are the three national dental fraternities
represented on this campus. The Dentones are a
men’s glee club composed exclusively of future
dentists.

Aside from its basic program of dentistry, the
School offers a specialized program for dental as-
sistants, as well as various programs for qualiﬁed
dentists to continue with their professional educa-
tion and to specialize.

The school maintains and encourages an active
research department which has the dual function
of stimulating more general interest in oral health
problems and attempting to ﬁnd solutions to these
same problems.

  

Edward J. Forrest, Dean

In his freshman year, a medical student is characterized by a
foul-smelling lab coat, a Biochemistry folk song concerned
with the scheme of Anaerobic Glycolysis, or an all-girls
sweepstakes in Anatomy. Pride in his school and especially
in his professors develops rapidly, however, as he reads the
name of Dr. Hoﬁman in Harper’s Review of Physiological
Chemistry, or when he attends a biochemistry lecture by Dr.
Katsoyannis, the synthesizer of insulin.

The sophomore may be recognized by a green thumb as he
leaves microbiology lab. He spends many hours injecting
animals with toxins, studying microbial genetics, and observ-
ing the actions of drugs and poisons. He takes pathology, and
the sophomore syndrome is manifested by any disease he is
studying at the time, the most popular being a pain in the
chest radiating to the shoulders and down the arms.

His next year, the future doctor switches to a short white
coat, a sign of seniority. The ﬁnger stains are now blue; the
bags under his eyes are darker. He splits his schedule six
ways to work at the University—afﬁliated hospitals.

Now he is one full year short of “Doctor.” He has attained
the ultimate—a stethoscope in the pocket of a street suit. He
spends eighteen weeks in the hospitals and eighteen weeks in
the Outpatient Departments; this is his opportunity to spe-
cialize in his chosen ﬁeld.

The four years of uncertainty are suddenly past, and the
A.M.A. has a brand new member.

THE GRADUATE
SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

James A. Crabtree, Dean

The bluish—grey walls of the streamlined Graduate School of
Public Health enclose an entire city block. Within the walls,
a comparatively new concept in the health professions is
underway and growing rapidly.

The emphasis here is social rather than individual; the
scope is community—wide, not personal. The central goal,
which unites the diverse interests of the people working and
studying here, is to maintain and improve community health
standards. Although the School is an autonomous unit, it
naturally works closely with the other schools of the health
professions and the related academic disciplines.

Included within the extensive School itself are departments
ranging from nutrition to microbiology, from occupational
health to public health practice. The division of public health
practice offers unique opportunities for research in such vital
ﬁelds as public health nursing, social work and community
health planning.

The work here is pioneering. Theory must be developed
with immediate application, for the aim of the school is not
only to provide qualiﬁed graduates in public health work, but
actively to promote and expand the entire ﬁeld of community
well-being.

Teaching and research work to complement and supple-
ment each other; the researcher experiments and discovers,
and the students are taught to implement the discoveries.
Conversely, students are taught so that they, too, will be
knowledgeable enough in their ﬁelds to begin their own re-
search. In order to maximize their potential for effective
practical application of their methods, the teaching and re-
search programs of the School work closely with state, re-
gional and local health and hospital associations.

A University education uncovers the
paths to fulﬁllment; it represents and fos-
ters growth along these paths. The intel-
lect is aroused and the sympathies are
channeled, as talents are discovered and
exploited. The range is as wide as a Uni-
versity’s people wish to stretch it. And
this year the desire was there, and the need
for opportunity was recognized and ful-
ﬁlled. The opportunities grew with their
creators, and thus the University of Pitts-
burgh grew, and became justly proud and
dedicated to continue to grow. In search
of man’s mind or soul or humanity, there
were people willing to commit themselves
and to recruit others. And this dedication
became a part of Pitt.

 

THE GRADUATE SCHOOL

OF SOCIAL WORK

The library on the twenty-second ﬂoor of the Cathedral is
eternally spilling over into its saucer—sized lounge. Here stu-
dents in the Graduate School of Social Work consult Freud,
arrange a ride to community lab, discuss civil rights or sim-
ply collapse, mumbling something about a fatigued ego.

' The School allows a choice of three areas of concentra-
tion. Some students emphasize case work, dealing solely with
individuals. Others are concerned with group work, enabling
people to ﬁnd individual fulﬁllment through organized group
action. The third group majors in community work, attempt-
ing to achieve individual fulﬁllment through the betterment
of the community itself.

The abstract learned in class becomes vitally concrete
through personal participation in ﬁeld work. In his two years,
each student receives two different ﬁeld placements to help
prepare him to assume one of the ﬁfteen jobs open to each
graduate. It is through this work in a community lab that the
student begins to realize the full potential of social work.

Social work is the link between the individual and the
society. With the professional competence provided by the
School, the social worker is free to use his position to its
fullest advantage. He may help people adjust to society, but
it is also within his power to help mold society to the needs
of its people.

THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS

Attempting to meet the dynamic needs of modern industry
and commerce, the University’s Graduate School of Business
offers programs which stretch the creativity and sharpen the
knowledge of its students.

Pittsburgh itself offers a rich opportunity for the student of
business. Here, within the conﬁnes of the metropolitan area,
are located forty major industrial research laboratories, and a
variety of industrial activities. The School is in the center of
this practical environment. It draws upon local industry to
enrich its curricula; it contributes to the business community
both by offering executive seminars and providing polished
professional graduates. '

Just about half way up the Cathedral of Learning are the
classrooms, oﬁices and library of the Business School. In the
lounge outside the library, a silver coffee urn invites full time
students to take a quick break, and evening students to relax
during the transition from job to classroom. Students are
predominately male Americans; yet often a sari or turban
may be seen, offering contrast to the grey ﬂannel. The visi-
tors from other lands here not only proﬁt from their own
education, but contribute to the growing realization on the
part of Americans that business is a world—wide concern; in
business as much as in politics or general culture the trend is
toward internationalism.

THE GRADUATE
LIBRARY SCHOOL

The complex of University libraries is a depository of approximately
one million volumes. Available also to the University community is
the wealth of libraries located in the city of Pittsburgh, many of them
adjacent to the campus. It is only ﬁtting that in this type of environ-
ment there is a growing need for qualiﬁed, professional librarians.
The Graduate Library School is one of the country’s fastest growing
institutions of its kind, attempting ambitious programs of research
and innovation in library technique to ﬁll the ever—growing needs of
the city’s, and the nation’s libraries.

The School maintains a library of its own which is a source of over
12,000 books and pamphlets pertaining to library science and its
related ﬁelds. An Audio—Visual Laboratory enables students at the
School to take advantage of the latest equipment suitable for library
use.

The master’s degree offered by this School opens the way to posi-
tions of professional stature for its graduates. Advanced certiﬁcates
are also offered to professional librarians who wish to specialize
further in a particular area of library science.

FOR ALL interests and abilities:
be Hamlet, atlzlete,

commentator or brother.

 

The overall goal of a University
education is to produce individuals
with a catholic range of interests
and abilities. Thus, the variety of
extracurricular activities to be
 found at the University reﬂects the
student’s interests and concerns
here as well as does the classroom.

There are groups which supple-
ment the classroom by providing an
opportunity for students to pursue
informally, and often more deeply,
speciﬁc academic interests. Relig-
ious groups of all the major denom-
inations of students here offer a
wide range of activities, from wor-
ship services to functions of a pure-
ly social and recreational nature.
Some organizations provide outlets
for musical, dramatic and athletic
talents, while the major function of
others is to serve the University
and its surrounding community.

The individual student beneﬁts
from all these organizations, either
as a member or an occasional
visitor. It is through these organiza-
tions that a link is welded both
among students, and between the
students and the larger world.

AIR FORCE ROTC

The basic purpose of the Air
Force Reserve Officers Training
Corps is to train and qualify col-
lege men for positions of leader-
ship in the United States Air
Force after graduation. There
are two years of basic training;
after completing the entire four-
year course of study, the men
are automatically commissioned
as second lieutenants.

AFROTC has as a subsidiary
the Arnold Air Society, whose
purpose is to promote interest
and knowledge in air force man-
agement. Pitt’s group captured
ﬁrst place in this year’s regional
evaluation.

I
 ALMNI ASSOCIATN

The Alumni Association is the link which
ties graduates of all the University’s
schools with their alma mater. This office
coordinates and organizes affairs through—
out the year, which bring the various
graduated classes together again. There
are yearly reunions for graduates of each
school; June Week features Commence-
ment and includes activities for all visiting
alumni. This year’s 25th reunion honor-
ing the class of 1938 drew 200 alumni
from as far away as California and Flor-
ida; the activities took place during Hon1e—
coming Weekend, and included educa-
tional seminars and a dinner—dance.

The Alumni Association began a pro-
gram whereby alumni throughout the

ENGINEERING
AND
MINES CABINET

The Engineering and Mines Cabinet is the representative body of all
engineering students, attempting to provide social, cultural and intellec-
tual activities geared to their special interests. It is composed of repre-
sentatives from each of the nine departments.

The Cabinet takes an active part in the governing of the Engineering
School because it works closely with the individual engineering societies
which establish policy within each department.

The Cabinet members publish the Engineering and Mines Bulletin.
The major social event the Cabinet sponsored during the fall trimester
was the Fall Ball. Cabinet members helped guide Engineers’ Week, and
sponsored the Shamrock Ball, highlight of the Week.

CHAPEL
CHOIR

After twenty—ﬁve years of being
strictly a Protestant chapel choir,
this year’s thirty—eight members
of Heinz Chapel Choir have re-
vamped the organization to ex-
tend their talents to general con-
certs.

The Choir sang concerts at
various churches in the Pitts-
burgh area as well as at Univer-
sity functions, such as the Spring
and Fall Convocations and the
Memorial Service for President
Kennedy. During the Christmas
season they caroled in nearby
hospitals and institutions, and
were featured at the Chancel-
1or’s Christmas Concert.

    

MEN’S
DORM
COUNCIL

The 1963-64 Men’s Dormitory Council is the govern-
ing body representing the ﬁrst group of undergraduate
men to inhabit the new Towers. This, at ﬁrst, meant
solving minor technical dilﬁculties involving elevators
and hot water. Later, the emphasis shifted from the
building to the students.

MDC perhaps gained the most extensive fame and
the most purse—felt appreciation from the establishment
of the laundry and dry cleaning service which soon be-
came a landmark of Tower B.

went on tour between trimesters in April, N S E 
during which they made an appearance
at the New York World’s Fair. The men
sang at a beneﬁt sponsored by the Negro
Emergency Education Drive, and at a
prayer breakfast given by the Mayor of
Pittsburgh.

A more cosmopolitan atmosphere was
created by more graduate and foreign
students joining the Glee Club. The
group’s repertoire changed its mood to
cover practically all periods of musical
writing. The year’s program was rounded
out by concerts with a number of colleges
and nursing schools. Concerts on campus
included the Winter Weekend and the
annual Winter and Spring Concerts.

PITTSBURGH
BALLET

From an inauspicious beginning
in an Atwood Street coal bin, the
Pittsburgh Ballet has reached a
position of cultural prominence
in the Renaissance City of
America. All of the Ballet mem-
bers, from the Balletmaster,
Staff Doctor, and Wardrobe’s
Mistress, down to the Staff
Roadrunner, Second Flute, and
Head Nymph, participate in pol-
icy meetings. Generally held at
the Saga training table or the
Fifth Avenue studio, these meet-
ings have formulated policy on
Southern Comfort boiler makers,
ofﬁcial signs (“Squeeze the Syra-
cuse Orange, it goes great with
ginl”) and rehearsed for the sec-
ond annual performance for the
Alf Landon Fan Club.

In addition to a lively interest

in the arts, Ballet members are
readily identiﬁed by their ofﬁcial
sweatshirts and Monday morn-
ing hangovers.

NEWMAN CLUB

The Newman Club, the Catholic
fellowship organization, is made
up of students who are interested
in integrating the spiritual and
secular aspects of University
life. The organization’s central
purpose is to build responsible
individual values based on reli-
gious ideals.

This year the members of the
Club involved themselves in pro-
grams directed both to the Uni-
versity community and to the
larger Pittsburgh area. They
sponsored a social project at
Wadsworth Hall in the Hiss Dis-
trict; classes in contemporary
and classical thought in reli-
gious, social and philosophical
areas; and a lecture series featur-
ing spokesmen in a variety of
ﬁelds.

Among the social affairs
which rounded the Newman
C1ub’s activity schedule were
their Halloween Night Streetcar
Party, the Christmas Party, and
the Lodge Party and Hayride.

,....x..x.,l... «v~

By means of a large number of widely
diversiﬁed committees, the 1963-64 Stu-
dent Government attempted to represent
and encourage undergraduate interest in
the wide range of activities and interests
possible in the total scope of academic
life. It was SG which sponsored Home-
coming activities, Parents’ Weekend
events, and the Freshman Outing; SG,
along with the Student Union Board, co-
sponsored Winter Weekend. The Liberal
Arts Cabinet was established to act as a
liaison between students and the Univer-
sity administration. In order to promote
cooperation and closer relations with the
newly—established regional campuses, SG
formed the Regional Campus Commit-
tee. Other committees helped rearrange
library hours, sponsored the SG Book Ex-
change, and provided study hours for stu-
dents at the Schenley Cafeteria. SG pre-
sented a Football Award and a Spirit
Trophy to promote interest in University
athletics, and its Human Relations Com-
mittee was set up to build harmonious
relations both within and outside of the
University.

Numbers multiply; there are
more people, more interests,
more challenges, more pitfalls;
it is more diﬁicult for the indi-
vidual to gravitate toward what
is right for him. It is more re-
warding when he ﬁnds it. Life
can no longer come easily——
there is sweat and there are
tears, and often a smile through
both. There are personal joys,
and experiences to share, upon
which are built the foundations
of rich life.

STUDENT
UNION
BOARD

The Student Union Board is the policy-
making executive committee which
shapes the scope and direction of activi-
ties and program offerings for the under-
graduate student body. The Board is
composed of its ownexecutive oﬂicers, as
well as the  of committees
whose programming interests range from
classical music to jazz, lectures to rock-
and—roll dances, pool to award-winning
ﬁlms. The Board as a whole joined the
Foreign Students’ Committee to present
International Week, and, along with
Student Government, later co-sponsored
the University-wide Winter Weekend. In
cooperation with Carnegie Tech, the
Board sponsored a Broadway production.
The Board’s activities are in large part
limited to the facilities offered by the Stu-
dent Union itself, including the Pine
Room, the Hunt Room, the newly—deco-
rated recreation room, and the Ballroom
and lounges.

 
   
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

WI   A new activity on William Pitt Debating

Union’s calendar this year was a series
 of parliamentary debates with speakers

drawn from groups outside the Univer-
sity to add diversity. In February, WPDU
 hosted an ' international debate which
pitted WPDU speakers against a team
U   from University College, Dublin.

In its intercollegiate competition,
WPDU placed winning teams in tourna-
ments at eleven colleges and universities
from Carnegie Tech to Johns Hopkins
and Vermont.

The year found Pitt’s debaters travel-
ing to Jamaica and Canada, and saw
them place second in the District Seven
competition and represent Pitt in the Na-
tional Finals held at West Point.

WOMEN’S CHORAL

Women’s Choral opened its 1963-64 season with
a traditional performance of “Hymn of Light,”
composed by Donald Colton who directs the
group. Dressed in black, the girls belong to an
organization which has been a part of Pitt life
since 1926. It is an intimate group, drawn close
by the common interest in music.

This past October the women joined the Men’s
Glee Club at Camp Lutherlyn in Prospect, Penn-
sylvania. At this Choral Camp the co-ed group of
students alternately relaxed and rehearsed for
their Annual Winter Concert.

The Concert, presented free to the entire Uni-
versity community in the Student Union Ball-
room, drew an enthusiastic crowd on December
13. The program was a mixture of traditional and
contemporary holiday and seasonal offerings. In
March, the women provided harmony at the
A.W.S. Senior Women’s Program.

deadlines and deadlines-

cop y, photo, worry

There are opportunities for all facets of journalistic
expression open to Pitt undergraduates. Each of the
student publications is written and edited by and for
students, catering to both general and speciﬁc ﬁelds of
interest. The faculty advisor and the administration
serve in a primarily advisory capacity; the general
policy is to maintain the traditional freedom of the
press from outside censorship.

The publications cater to the various tastes and in-
terests to be found within the student body itself; their
scope ranges from the student newspaper, handbook
and yearbook to magazines of professional schools,
and publications fostering the prose and poetry writ-
ing, artistic and photographic talents of their student
contributors.

THE PITT NEWS

The Pitt News, self—acclaimed as being
“One of America’s Great Student News-
papers,” decided to expand its coverage
this year, and succeeded in producing
three, instead of the traditional two, is-
sues each week. Begun in the fall tri-
mester as a football supplement, the Fri-
day edition soon became a slightly ane-
mic addition to that of the week’s news
which was seen ﬁt to print.

When the tobacco industry’s con-
science began to prick, it discontinued
cigarette ads in college newspapers; the
News successfully made up this loss in
revenue, however, with a weekly “Pitts—
burgh at Night” directory of entertain-
ment around town, and increased sales
of classiﬁed ads. A special promotion
offer of a week’s free ads was used by
students for purposes ranging from sell-
ing cars and appliances to offering date
bureau services.

The News sparked a number of con-
troversies during the year. In its editorial
policy toward various matters of student
interest, feelings often ran high, and thus
it perhaps did much to stimulate student
interest in affairs of general University
concern.

THE 1964 OWL

A University is a vast complex of people and the events
they generate. The yearbook must know the people,
must preserve the events. It is a job which requires the
talents of those who can encompass a mob with a click
of a shutter and those who can capture a spirit with the
clack of a typewriter. It requires the patience of a copy-
reader and the wisdom of an editor. And it is made
possible by the acumen of the businessman.

A staff is born one spring. A year later they are ex-
perts. In the interim, pandemonium is editorial routine,
and oﬂice lights burn when all else is dark.

Ideas and Figures spent the year strug-
gling to maintain its existence and at the
same time to continue its traditionally
high standards of publication. This is
virtually the only recognized outlet for
undergraduate creativity in the entire
spectrum of University life. As such, it
serves the dual function of publicly rec-
ognizing the talent which exists, and of
encouraging an increase in and appreci-
ation of student originality.

Ideas and Figures maintains a ﬂexible
format, allowing for publication of the
work of aspiring essayists, poets, artists
and photographers, as well as fiction
writers. This year, in their fund-raising
efforts, the staff of the magazine also en-
couraged creativity in the graphic arts
connected with public relations and pub-
licity, and provided an opportunity for
the academic community to see some of
the ﬁnest products of recent moviedom.

SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER

Students in the Schools of Engi-
neering and Mines are working
to attain professional compe-
tence as well as intellectual ex-
cellence. It is this difference
which makes it necessary for
engineers to have their own rep—
resentative publication. The
Skyscraper Engineer helps to
unify these students by provid-
ing an expression of specialized
interests; it also serves to ac-
quaint the non-engineer with the
scope of the engineering profes-
sion. The Skyscraper Engineer
is unquestionably a voice speak-
ing for a speciﬁc segment of Pitt
undergraduates; at the same
time, it speaks to these very stu-
dents about their broader aims
and ambitions. It draws the engi-
neers into closer contact with
other segments of the Univer-
sity, and at the same time helps
the University understand what
engineering entails.

The Polaris is a steno—pad sized calendar
and guide to the University, edited by a
staff of undergraduate students affiliated
with the Student Government. To fresh-
men, it is the riddle—solver for the first
confusing months of hunting for build-
ings, wondering about hours, delving into
Greek activities, and discovering names
of classmates. For upperclassmen, it has
come to be an indispensable tool not only
for answering freshmen’s questions, but
also‘as a date, appointment and assign-
ment book.

The 1963-64 Polaris was distinguished
by a full-color doub1e—cover photograph
of the University, taken from a vantage
point in Schenley Park. It included mes-
sages from the Chancellor and the Stu-
dent Government, and went on to ac-
quaint the user with University tradi-
tions, with University people concerned
with student aﬂ‘airs, and with the organi-
zations and activities available to stu-
dents.

The Pitt Capsule is a student magazine published by
members of the Student Branch of the American Phar-
maceutical Association at the University, whose pur-
pose is to report and supplement the professional inter-
ests being developed in the School of Pharmacy. It
features articles and editorials on noteworthy events
within the school and activities of the honorary Greek
organizations, as well as news of purely professional
interest. This past year, with the encouragement of the
Capsule, student representatives of the American Phar-
maceutical Association established the “common hour
program,” a series of lectures and special programs
concerning aspects of pharmacy.

met a need for Mother.

WPGH, Pitt’s campus radio station, fea-
tures regularly—schedu1ed music programs
catering to the Variety of tastes and moods
indicative of a diversiﬁed and large stu-
dent body; there are disc jockey shows,
classical hours, jazz programs, and radio
hootenannies, as well as broadcasts of mu—
sical show and movie hits. The specific
interest of WPGH, however, is to provide
communication of news and ideas of spe-
ciﬁc campus interest.

The station’s reporters cover the social,
academic and extracurricular news of the
student body, and regularly recruit faculty
and administration members to discus-
sions with students on topics of academic
and general interest. News of the world
outside the campus is provided by a direct
tie—in with the CBS Broadcasting Net-
work. This year marked the start of new
discussion shows and Pitt Player dramas.

HONORARIES exist to

recognize superior

achievement

The central, and often all-encompassing,
purpose and goal of the University stu-
dent is academic achievement. In this, as
in any ﬁeld, there are some who stand
out from the rest as being of particular
merit. The well—rounded student partici-
pates in extracurricular interests too, and
here also there are those who excel.

The academic honorary fraternities
exist generally both to recognize superior
achievement in their particular areas,
and to encourage in their members a
continuing professional interest in the
ﬁeld. There are both general academic
honorary groups, whose membership
crosses academic divisional lines, and
speciﬁc groups of members pursuing a
particular course of study.

The non—academic honorary organiza-
tions exist also to recognize leadership in
various endeavors; in addition, most of
them also perform service functions both
for the University itself and in the com-
munity at large.

ALPHA EPSILON
DELTA

Alpha Epsilon Delta, pre-medical honor
society, was reactivated on campus this
academic year, and plunged into a host
of services and activities for members,
other students and the community.
Members have taken ﬁeld trips, ar-
ranged summer research positions for
premeds, sponsored Medical School
Open Houses, and contributed their serv-
ices to various community health organ-
izations. AED’s ﬁlms drew SRO crowds.

ALPHA KAPPA PSI

Due to the phasing out of the
undergraduate School of Busi-
ness, Alpha Kappa Psi has just
completed its ﬁnal year “on the
steps of Delta.” In spite of im-
pending dissolution and dwin-
dling membership, the men, re-
cruited from academic and cam-
pus leadership groups, placed
ﬁrst and second in the past two
years for overall chapter per-
formance, and retained the re-
gional Spirit Award. The broth-
ers contributed to community
organizations, and heard suc-
cessful businessmen from varied
ﬁelds discuss their work. The
semi—annual banquets highlighted
an active social program.

Beta Alpha Psi, honorary ac-

dual purpose of uniting men

ther this interest.

Current activities in the ﬁeld
of accounting provide the sub-
stance of Beta Alpha Psi meet-
ings. Primary among problems
discussed this year was the con-
tinuously expanding data proc-
essing techniques, and the re-
lated question of revising ac-
counting principles to ﬁt the tech-
nological developments. Both
questions were discussed not only
at fraternity meetings, but also at
the semi—annual Symposium.
Other programs offered career in-
formation and guidance.

CWENS

The Cwens are a small group of
outstanding sophomore women
brought together both to stimu-
late diversiﬁed interests and to
serve the University. They are
chosen from those women who
are felt to have made outstand-
ing contributions in one ﬁeld or
another to their class as fresh-
men.

There is ritual and tradition
in being a part of Cwens, and
there is the constant search for
intellectual and cultural awak-
enment, both as a group and as
a part of the larger sphere of
campus life. This year’s Cwens
sponsored bi-monthly lecture-
discussion programs, and host-
essed at activities running the
gamut of‘ interests from Honors
Convocation to sports.

What the full life amounts to is peo-
ple: individuals interacting, stimu-
lating, encouraging, challenging other
individuals. Sometimes the mere ex-
istence of one serves to inspire an-
other. More often there is a word,
a glance, a touching of ﬁngers and
souls. The essence of life ﬂows from
one to the other, miraculously enrich-
ing both. Eyes meet, and barriers are
shattered. The raw need is there; the
honest are aware that it can be ﬁlled
only by giving.

The University offers of itself, and
the individual may take at will. It ex-
tends from the classroom, where the
giving and taking are each one-sided,
to the Tuck Shop or a dorm or the
Commons Room. The deeper it be-
comes, the greater its power to build
or destroy. The individual opens his
soul to another, and risks self-destruc-
tion. But the need is so great, the
risk must be taken. Fulﬁllment de-
mands the utmost from each, yet
holds out its tantalizing reward, lim-
ited only by the individual’s capa-
bility and courage. Words ﬂow con-
stantly, but the giving is to be found
in the eyes; the taking, in the heart.
One person succeeds in reaching out
to another, and love is born. This,
after all, is an answer to the need.

DRUIDS

Druids, the sophomore men’s
leadership organization, serves
both as a means of honoring and
recognizing outstanding under-
classmen, and as an advisory
body in matters of general stu-
dent interest. At luncheon meet-
ings this past year the Druids
discussed news of campus inter-
est and planned activities to
further their goal of encouraging
University leaders.

They helped at Freshman
Camp, and began plans for an
Activities Counseling Service for
incoming students. The Druids
heard several guest speakers and
were addressed at their banquet
by the Chancellor, who stressed
the importance of the student on
campus.

ETA KAPPA NU

Beta Delta is the student chapter of Eta Kappa
Nu Association, the National Electrical Engineer-
ing Honor Society. Eta Kappa Nu has two dis-
tinct purposes. First, it assists its members
throughout their lives in becoming better in their
chosen profession. Another purpose of the organi-
zation is to be a motivating force, providing the
leadership to fellow members and non-members
in improving the standards of the Electrical Engi-
neering profession.

The school year 1963-64 has been a year of
reconstruction for Beta Delta Chapter of Eta
Kappa Nu. As a first step, the chapter changed
its membership requirements to conform more
exactly to the national constitution. The chapter
has taken a more active role this year in providing
leadership for the various student activities in the
Electrical Engineering Department.

ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERS

The Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers, the professional society of
Electrical Engineering, is a recently-
formed merger of two parent organiza-
tions, the American Institute of Elec-
trical Engineers and the Institute of
Radio Engineers. The Student Chapter
of I.E.E.E. functions primarily to interest
engineers in becoming affiliated with the
professional society.

Pitt’s student I.E.E.E. sponsors weekly
electrical engineering seminar programs,
at which prominent speakers address the
entire sophomore, junior and senior
classes of electrical engineers. These
speakers are recruited from industry, ed-
ucation, politics or any other ﬁeld which
might be of interest. I.E.E.E. sponsored
several social functions—cider and do-
nut parties and a school skit.

MORTAR
BOARD

Mortar Board, the national women’s
scholarship and leadership honorary, at-
tempts to promote and encourage diversi-
ﬁed excellence in University women. Its
members are seniors who were selected
by previous members in the spring of
their junior year.

The old president transferred; the new
president led the chapter in revising in-
itiation procedure. The chapter held eve-
ning discussion-dinner meetings with
guest speakers, and inaugurated a semi-
nar series for outstanding freshman wo-
men on “The Role of the Educated Wo-
man,” led by Mrs. Hibbard Kline.

Mortar Board members heard a man-
to—women talk on Pittsburgh politics and
decided they had better vote. What else
could they do, they wondered; so their
motto was “do anything well!”

OMICRON
DELTA KAPPA

The Chancellor’s desire to pursue excellence in
all facets of academic life is perhaps no better
exempliﬁed than by the goals of Omicron Delta
Kappa, junior and senior men’s leadership honor-
ary. This group of upperclassmen who have dis-
tinguished themselves in diversiﬁed activities on
campus, functions to help unify existing leader-
ship for the purpose of stimulating and encourag-
ing continuing excellence in the members’ various
spheres of inﬂuence. As members of a national
fraternity dedicated to the development and rec-
ognition of student leaders. Pitt’s Omicron Delta
Kappa’s exemplify outstanding accomplishment
in both scholastic and service areas of endeavor.
At Tap Day those who have excelled are tapped
to the group, and recognized by their fellow stu-
dents; the most outstanding senior man is named
ODK Man of the Year.

PHI ETA
SIGMA

Phi Eta Sigma, composed of
freshman men with 3.5 QPA’s,
exists to foster scholarship and
the free exchange of ideas. To-
ward these goals, the group dis-
tributed “Hints on How to
Study” pamphlets to freshmen
on the UniVersity’s ﬁve cam-
puses, and sponsored tutoring
sessions which attracted 400 stu-
dents. Feeling that scholarship
must be in touch with the diver-
sity of the world if it is to be
Valid, Phi Eta Sigma co-spon-
sored the International Students’
C0mmittee’s Brother—Sister Pro-
gram. This year, initiates from
Johnstown, Bradford, Titusville
and Greensburg joined with stu-
dents from the Oakland campus
for the initiation ceremonies in
Heinz Chapel, followed by a
banquet at Stouffer’s.

PI DELTA EPSILON

Pi Delta Epsilon, national collegiate jour-
nalism fraternity, is composed of those
who have excelled in the various extra-
curricular publications for undergradu-
ates at the University. It is the policy-
making organization for all the publica-
tions, and represents each of them. Its
basic function is to encourage and main-
tain the highest possible journalistic
standards in student publications, and to
promote a continuing interest in the pro-
fession as a whole. Members are usually
leaders of the Pitt News, Owl, Ideas and
Figures and other periodicals of more
limited scope within the University. They
come to Pi Delt with interests in diversi-
ﬁed aspects of journalism, ranging from
news, feature and editorial writing to
business layout and photography.

QUAX

An October dinner meeting opened the year for
members of Quax, honorary organization for out-
standing women at the University “engaged in
the study of science.”

The following month, the Quax yellow and
green covered dinner tables where bouquets of
fall mums bloomed. Twenty-nine people assem-
bled, eleven of them to become members at the
Fall Initiation Banquet. Dr. Richard Tobias re-
cited Gerard Manley Hopkins’ “Carrion Com-
fort,” and the women honored Miss Jean Teats,
the group’s outgoing advisor, and welcomed new
advisors, Dr. Janice Gibson and Miss Charlsa
Gaskin. The initiates left with white Quax shingles
and yellow mums; the old members, with seven-
sided tiny Quax pins.

When they assembled for the last time in
March to initiate nine Spring tappees, they met
two of the Quax founders, and heard a talk by
Dr. Gibson, urging them to be creative. She
stressed the fact that women are not forced to
compete in contemporary society, and thus are
allowed the freedom to experiment with the un-
certain, perhaps to write the book that will not
sell.

Quax is an honorary group, devoted to indivi-
dual growth and understanding.

QUO VADIS

Quo Vadis is the organization of
women students who are se-
lected to learn the messages con-
tained within the University’s
International Classrooms and
Heinz Chapel, and to guide Visi-
tors in helping to understand
their signiﬁcance. These wo-
men’s academic interests are
varied, and they broaden their
horizons by an active inter-
change of thoughts and ideas.
Each year Quo Vadis awards
the Vera Heinz scholarship to
its outstanding member for
travel and study abroad.

SIGMA THETA TAU

Sigma Theta Tau, national nursing hon-
orary, fosters high professional standards
both by its programs and the personal
excellence of those chosen for member-
ship. This year’s 31 new members were
selected on the basis of scholarship, lead-
ership and professional potential, from
candidates in generic, general and mas-
ters programs.

In October, the University’s Eta Chap-
ter sent delegates to a national conven-
tion in Nashville, Tennessee, to exchange
ideas and experiences with prospective
nurses from the U. S. and abroad.

The group awards a scholarship to
foster professional excellence, and spon-
sored several lecture programs.

SIGMA TAU 175

Sigma Tau, national honorary engineer-
ing fraternity, attempts to recognize out-
standing achievement in the ﬁeld of engi-
neering and to encourage high personal
and professional ideals. Juniors in the
Schools of Engineering and Mines with a
3.0 Q.P.A. are eligible.

During the fall and winter trimesters,
new members were tapped to the Psi
Chapter here on the Pitt campus, and the
initiation banquet was held at Johnny
Garneau’s Restaurant. A plaque was
given to the sophomore who had the
highest Q.P.A. in his freshman class. The
fraternity began plans for a radio pro-
gram on WPGH; it also appropriated
money for a small pyramid, the symbol
of the fraternity, to be placed in the pro-
posed engineering building.

GREEKS offer

refuge or diversity

Pitt is a large school in a large city. This
can mean a variety of things to its stu-
dents. It can mean the excitement of a
diversity of people and experience, or
very real loneliness. It can provide a
wide, diversiﬁed circle of friends, a
small, homogeneous one, or the paucity
of human inter—relationship inherent in a
potentially impersonal mass.

The Greek organizations on campus
offer one solution to the social problems
of entering undergraduates. The fraterni-
ties and sororities provide a ready—made,
close—knit sub—community of students
whose background and interests vary
widely.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 

 

 

F RATERNITIES

There is a place, somewhere among the
seventeen recognized social fraternities
on campus, for every interested Pitt man
to belong, to make friends and share
common experiences. Each fraternity, in
its unique membership, traditions, and
activities, reﬂects in its own way what an
active, complete college life can come to
mean.

The Interfraternity Council, the co-
ordinating body for the fraternities, is the
focal point of inter-fraternity cooperation
and social contact. Under its auspices, all
the fraternities join together to pursue
the interests they have in common.
Through this group spirit, personal con-
tacts widen further than the individual
groups’ boundaries permit; existing cir-
cles and activities are strengthened, and
develop through brotherly inter-group
rivalry.

INTER FRATERNITY
COUNCIL

The Inter—Fraternity Council is the governing and coordinat-
ing body of the recognized fraternities on campus. Under the
direction of the Dean of Men’s Office, this group organizes
general rush policies, determines rules applicable to all fra-
ternities, and helps the individual brotherhoods with cooper-
ative activities. It is IFC which sponsors and schedules fall
rush; this group educates incoming freshmen as to general
fraternity life, without attempting to sell one brotherhood
over another. IFC serves as the general governing body of
fraternity life, enforcing its own rules. It represents aﬂiliated

men on campus in both campus—wide and oﬂicial Greek
events.

DELTA SIGMA
PHI

The Omega Chapter of Sigma Delta Phi,
social fraternity, distinguished itself as a
group, while at the same time its indivi-
dual members brought honor and pres-
tige to the brotherhood by holding posi-
tions of campus leadership. Even their
house itself joined in the move to self-
betterment this year, boasting new furni-
ture on the main ﬂoor and a newly-reno-
vated basement.

As a group, the Delta Sigma Phi’s
copped ﬁrst place standings in baseball,
basketball, wrestling, badminton and
ping pong; they placed second in golf and
swimming, and third in football, squash
and track. To cap this impressive record,
the brothers won the “A” league All-
Sports Trophy.

Outstanding social events of the year
included the traditional costumed Sailor’s
Ball, the Founders’ Day Banquet, and
the Carnation Ball, which brought to-
gether all the local chapters of the broth-
erhood. In August, the group’s national
convention was at Pitt, with the Omega
chapter as host.

DELTA TAU DELTA

A Delt function is operationally deﬁned as any social
event involving three or more people with proportion-
ate kegs. The Gamma Sigma chapter of Delta Tau
Delta functions nearly autonomously.

Conducive to active functioning, the Delt house suits
its members. Boasting a pine—paneled den with a suit-
able number of trophies including this year’s home-
coming award, a pool table, stero system, and a brick
bar, the Delt atmosphere seems to be that of the night
before the morning after.

Combining that which swings with that which pulls
grades the Delts manage a balanced juxtaposition re-
sembling point, and counter point. Possessing both a
brick bar and their own library the Delts uphold bo-
hemia as well as academia.

PI KAPPA
ALPHA

The Pi Kappa Alpha social fraternity at-
tempted this year, through traditional
functions and individual achievement, to
live up to the brotherhood’s ideal of
strengthening friendship through social,
athletic and academic pursuits.

The annual Christmas party for Pitts-
burgh orphans again indicated the aware-
ness of community responsibility. The
Garnet and Gold Ball signiﬁed the cul-
mination of final rush. There was ‘a spring
weekend at Seven Springs; the traditional
Dream Girl Formal was held at the Web-
ster Hall.

The PiKA’s were active and successful
participants in various facets of the intra-
mural sports program, and were re-
warded by being named runners—up for
the All-Sports Trophy. One of the broth-
ers was on the Wrestling Team; several
were members of Druids, and cooperated
in the Pitt Preview program.

In the course of an individual’s growth, there comes a
shattering moment of existential awareness. He is hit by
the terror of irrefutable aloneness, its hollow echo reach-
ing to his very being. Answers have been found with and
through others, but the ultimate answer must be found
within oneself. Alone. It is perhaps the highest goal of
education to enable the individual to face solitude un-
ﬂinchingly and with hope. He must transcend the imme-
diate and reach to timelessness. He must surpass the
trivia and create of himself, for himself. There comes the
moment when he must close his eyes and search deeply
inward. Only he can judge for himself what he is, and
whether it is sufficient.

 

SIGMA
ALPHA MU

The year’s social calendar of Sigma
Alpha Mu was highlighted by such events
as the Founders’ Day Dinner-Dance at
Green Oaks Country Club, the daring
Pajama Party at the house, and the an-
nual Spring Affair. Rousing stags and
Friday afternoon Sammy Jammys also
added to the fun. Second place winners
in the Student Government Spirit Award
competition, the Chapter built a Mr. Wiz-
ard ﬂoat in the rain. The Sammies were
soaked again at their Winter Weekend
Carnival sponge—throwing booth. Greek
Week, a bi—weekly dinner-discussion at
the house with members of the Univer-
sity community, and active participation
in the intramural sports program rounded
out the SAM year.

Fall rush was the first indication of an outstanding
year for Pi Lambda Phi. The enthusiastic pledges
proved their worth by beating the arch-rival Phi
Eps in the annual Pledge football game. They
went on to warn ﬂoat contestants, “We Will Bury
You,” and earned a second place ﬁnish.

The fraternity gained new friends through
joint sorority parties, and, with the aid of “The
Debonaires,” the Pi Lam house became some-
thing of a Friday afternoon landmark. Spirit
effervesced from the Pi Lams, winning them the
Spirit Trophy. In addition to, or perhaps despite,
all the activity, the Pi Lams copped top scholastic
standing on campus.

SIGMA CHI

The Sigma Chis spent the year
involved in a variety of social
activities.

The end of each rush season
was marked by the traditional
White Rose formals, oﬂicial
mark of acceptance into the
ranks of actives.

The pledge classes hosted at
parties in honor of their new
brothers, and even went so far as
to introduce Frankenstein mov-
ies into the proceedings.

The men participated enthusi-
astically in Pitt’s intramural pro-
gram, and several brothers
brought honor to their fraternity
by being tapped to Druids and
ODK.

Zeta Beta Tau, men’s social fra-
ternity, opened its second year
on campus with a tea for fresh-
man women, and closed it with
an Anniversary Dinner—Dance.
In between, the fraternity
pledged twenty—one brothers,
and joined the Alpha Delta Pi
Sorority in creating a Popeye
Homecoming ﬂoat. Before the
Homecoming Dance at the Web-
ster Hall, the brothers hosted a
cocktail party and buffet dinner
at the house. They spent hours
creating an Ugly Man, and re-
laxed to the tunes of their new
juke box. Wine and cheese par-
ties allowed the men a taste of
gourmet living. Combine parties
and Mount Mercy mixers ﬁlled
the social calendar.

SORORITIES

For University women, commitment to a
Greek social fraternity is a lasting con-
tact with sisters throughout the country;
the rewards of membership extend be-
yond the college years. Pitt has ﬁfteen
chapters of recognized national sororities
on campus, whose membership, like their
brother fraternities’, include almost the
gamut of backgrounds and goals to be
found among a diversiﬁed student body.

Sorority life itself is a unique oppor-
tunity for the sisters, who establish a
closeness among themselves which is diﬂi—
cult to duplicate outside of sorority
membership. Some live together in the
suites or houses, intimately sharing the
joys and sorrows of daily existence; for
those who live in the dorms or commute,
the spirit is developed through planning
and working together toward shared ob-
jectives. The Panhellenic Council links
and unites members of the varied in-
dividual groups.

PANHELLENIC
COUNCIL

The Panhellenic Council acts as a co-
ordinating and governing body for all
nationally-aﬂiliated women’s social fra-
ternities at the University. Its purposes
are to maintain the high calibre of soror-
ity life, to promote interfraternity rela—
tionships, to further sound scholarship,
and to cooperate with the University’s
administration and other organizations in
matters related to sorority activities. Pan-
hel this year sponsored the Panhellenic
Prevue, a mixer in cooperation with the
lnterfraternity Council, and a ball honor-
ing new pledges.

ALPHA DELTA PI

Alpha Delta Pi’s ﬁlled the year with ac-
tivities ranging from volleyball to a tea
with Mrs. Litchﬁeld. Between the ex-
tremes were Greek Week, which won
Judy Krausche a crown; Labor Day,
when the sisters and their parents pic-
nicked in Schenley Park; fall Saturdays,
which brought football games and subse-
quent sore throats; and Homecoming,
when the ADPi’s joined forces with
ZBT’s for a Valiant effort toward a color-
ful ﬂoat take-off on “Popeye.” In Jan-
uary, ADPi’s attended their ‘‘Black and
White Formal” at the LaMont, and win-
ter rush allowed fourteen pledges to join
the ranks of the sorority.

The sorority fulﬁlled its obligation to
the community by reading to blind stu-
dents; seven girls were mentors; three,
senior assistants; and four, members of
honoraries in their major ﬁelds.

For some reason, the Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority this year seemed
to find taking in a fall pledge class a major hazard. Once this ob-
stacle was passed, however, the year picked up speed and the
girls, individually and collectively, managed to run the gamut of
experience from Diet Cola to beer. There were difficult moments
having something to do with the contrast between sophistication
and belly dancers. It was a difﬁcult job getting the banner up in
the quad, but, as the sisters realized as they scrambled back to
their feet, they had seen the whole thing from the wrong angle.
The suite phone rang. Girls answered, and heard freshman voices,
a “sexy voice,” and the voices of the established. Perhaps it was

the combination of beer and ice cream that resulted in the 48-hour
sleep marathon.

CHI OMEGA

Chi Omega, a social sorority,
managed to distinguish itself this
year in widely diverse ﬁelds of
University life. Whether an ac-
tivity was academic, social or
service it seemed that a Chi O
was always there. The group
boasted a member of Mortar
Board, a Junior Worthy, and
two dormitory presidents. At
Homecoming, the Chi O ﬂoat
featured Mickey Mouse; at
Greek Sing the girls donned the
plaid and won third place for
their rendition of “Loch Lo-
mond.” The music of Peter, Paul
and Mary, the fervor of rush
parties, accidents and fun at ski
weekend, and pledge pranks all
rounded out the lives of this
year’s Chi Omegas. There were
teas and parties for the alumnae,
and for the favorite faculty
members of each sister. The
longest day of the year lasted 48
hours: Overnight.

The sisters of the Delta Delta
Delta sorority spent the year
squeezing a full schedule of so-
cial events and community proj-
ects into their busy lives. Each
month the girl contributing most
to campus or sorority life was
honored by her sisters. At the
winter formal, the girls selected
their favorite man, the Delta
Man of the Year. The sisters
honored graduating seniors at
the Pansy Breakfast; stayed
awake enjoying two overnights;
and hostessed at dinners, date
parties and mixers. Celebrations
honoring sisters who were
pinned or engaged occurred fre-
quently throughout the year. At
Christmastime, the Tri—Delts
visited Children’s Hospital, and,
later in the year, awarded a
scholarship to an outstanding
University woman. It was a year
of momentous changes in some
lives, memorable for all Tri-
Delts.

DELTA ZETA

Delta Zeta has been an active
participant in campus affairs and
in the Pan—Hellenic Association
this year. At Homecoming the
sisters worked with Theta Chi to
build a ﬂoat featuring “Bull-
winkle Moose.” Their presenta-
tion of “I Wonder What The
King Is Doing Tonight?” won
third prize at Greek Sing, and
DZ’s took second place in the
Ugly Man on Campus Contest.
The Winter Weekend Carnival
booth built by the Delta Zeta’s
revolved around “Mouse Rou-
lette.”

The year’s social events in-
cluded the Christmas party, the
Spring Formal, and several teas
and open houses.

KAPPA
ALPHA
THETA

The Kappa Alpha Theta sorority this year
seemed to cop all sorts of recognition,
while individual members spent time and
effort on fund-raising and community
affairs. The girls won ﬁrst place at Greek
Week Sing for their rendition of “The
Whistling Gypsy;” there were two Theta
ﬁnalists in the Homecoming Queen com-
petition; and the sorority’s Huntley—
Brinkley ﬂoat won ﬁrst place in the
Homecoming parade.

The entire pledge class this year
worked for the Hill Education Project.
The sisters are moving to a new house in
September, and there were several fund-
raising projects this year.

00

The Kappa Kappa Gamma So-
rority, anticipating the building
of their new house, moved to
502 Amos Hall this year. There,
the Kappas’ social calendar in-
cluded the Founders Day Tea,
Mother-Daughter Tea and the
annual faculty dinner with Delta
Tau Delta. The Annual Kappa
Party was held at the Oakmont
Yacht Club after the Panhel
Ball.

The Kappas, working with the
Sigma Chi’s, placed third with
their Homecoming ﬂoat, “Inter-
national Showtime.” Homecom-
ing brought another trophy for
the Kappas with the selection of
Rosemary Brown as Homecom-
ing Queen. Winter Weekend
found a “Kappa Kisses” booth
at the Carnival and Kappa can-
didates as King and Queen of
the Weekend. Debate trophies
were captured by Carol Durant
who also enjoyed a week in
Jamaica with fellow Pitt de-
baters.

Next year the Kappas, old and
new, will continue happily from
new quarters.

PHI SIGMA SIGMA

When the trumpet was sounded for work
this year, Phi Sigma Sigma heard the call
and ‘came out in full force. They spent
many hours at the Pi Lam house trying
to assemble their Homecoming ﬂoat.
Khrushchev’s arm seemed determined to
break under the heavy weights, but
somehow the paint dried, the napkins got
stuffed and the ﬂoat was ready for the
parade. Afterwards, their second place
silver bowl served as a centerpiece for a
victory celebration. Student Government
reinstated the spirit contest this year; the
Phi Sigs again heard the call, slaved over
thirty—seven 10-foot cardboard signs, and
captured first place. Within the suite, the
popular hootenanny seemed to be a fa-
i vorite, whetherorganized or not. The Phi

Sig suite resounded with guitars, laughter

and an occasional professional boost

from a phonograph.

SIGMA DELTA TAU

The girls of Sigma Delta Tau
began the year with a Parents’
Weekend brunch. Dr. Tobias
and Miss Skewis each spent an
evening with the girls. Winter
rush brought SDT the largest
pledge class on campus. The
pledges organized a party for
the patients at Children’s Hos-
pital, and later attended the
sorority’s own Sadie Hawkins
party. SDT won ﬁrst place for
the second consecutive year in
the Ugly Man On Campus con-
test. The Anniversary Affair
took the SDT’s and their dates
to the Holiday House to see and
hear Xavier Cugat and Abbe
Lane; the following day the new
oiﬁcers were installed and hon-
ored at a tea sponsored by their
alumnae.

ZETA TAU
ALPHA

The sisters of Zeta Tau Alpha
sorority joined with their fellow
Greeks this year to build a
Homecoming ﬂoat, to provide
variety during Greek Week fes-
tivities, and to enjoy the annual
sorority Spring Formal. In the
fall, the actives and alumnae
planned a Senior Dinner to hon-
or the graduating sisters. Here
scholarship and activities awards
were presented to those girls
who contributed most to the
advancement of the sorority
throughout the academic year.
Luncheons, teas, and card par-
ties given for the parents and
alumnae made the year pass
quickly. There was a Christmas
party at Children’s hospital, at
which the sisters entertained the
children with songs, candy and
games. ZTA girls continue their
affiliation with their sisters; ac-
tives and alums cooperate.

FOOTBALL

Football was strictly Freddy this fall. Freddy Mazurek. A devilish
munchkin not quite 20, bronze—faced and bashful. He sparked a
football team which soared to a 9-1 record after a 5-5 season the
year before. He threw passes like a guy groping for a towel with
soap in his eyes. But they were caught by Joe Kuzneski, Bill
Howley, Bill Bodle, Paul Martha and John Jenkins. Each of these

fellows caught more passes than the leading receiver of the prior
season.

rrrrrrr

Mazurek broke the school record for yards gained in one season
by passing for 949 yards and running for 646 for a total of 1595,
breaking Warren Heller’s record of 1338 set in 1931.

Of course, Freddy didn’t get all the credit. Neither did his un-
assuming coach, John Michelosen. Neither did the crack front-line,
bolstered by All—American Ernie Borghetti and rugged Ed Adam-
chik. Neither did the team captain Algis Grigaliunas, who spent
his childhood scratching in a German concentration camp in Kau-
nas, Lithuania. No, these were only the elements that made up
Pitt’s most exciting team in years. But it took more than the re-
markable play of Freddy Mazurek. More than the All-America
sprints of halfback Paul Martha. Much more.

It took a little mischievous needling from Chancellor Edward
H. Litchﬁeld who said he wanted “wide—open” football. That’s all.
And as Oakland residents know, whatever Litchﬁeld wants, Litch-
ﬁeld gets. “I’m glad we did so well this year,” said Paul Martha.
“We played interesting football like Chancellor Litchﬁeld wanted
us to. His interest was a clue to our season.”

CROSS COUNTRY

“The Loneliness of the Long—Distance Runner,” which
Alan Sillitoe depicted in his long short story, was sel-
dom experienced by the school’s cross—country team.
Togetherness was their virtue, whether on the grass of
Flagstaﬂ‘ Hill, or in the booths of Cicero’s.

While their point spread was often quite below the
other teams, their personal time spread was often
found to be wonderful by Coach Carl Rees, a man who
has coached ﬁve losing teams here in ﬁve years. The
time difference between the first Pitt runner and the
ﬁfth Pitt runner—the last to ﬁgure in the team scoring
—was seldom signiﬁcant. Except for John Bailey—a
non—conformist who ran ahead and was tagged “the
best runner here in ﬁve years” by Rees—the team ran
in a pack, but alas, usually in the back of the cross-
country crowd.

The climax of the season came when Bailey—-mind
you, “the best in ﬁve years”—fell twice and ﬁnished
104th in the IC4A championships. The ﬁnal record of
3-4 was an improvement over the 2-5 record of the
year before, but cross—country remains in a downhill
glide at Pitt.

SOCCER

A year ago the soccer team recorded a
7-2-2 record, and even made it to the
ﬁrst round of the NCAA championships
One of the biggest reasons was Bob
Cuthbert who scored 15 goals and was
the life—time goal—getter for the team. He
got his scores in an unclassical manner,
however, and he was overlooked for the
team’s MVP award. A do—eVerything
player with lots of ﬁnesse won it instead.
Last year—without Cuthbert—the team
skidded to a 5-5 record. But coach Leo
Bemis learned a lesson. The MVP
award went to Tom Stabb. During the
presentation it was duly noted that “his
desire and hard—work made up for his
lack of ability.” It was hard to take, but
the plaque was there. Staab hadn’t been
able to make up for his lack of ability,
neither has last year’s team. “We started
with a lot of inexperience,” said Bemis,
“We’ve gained a lot of experience.”

BASKETBALL

For the second consecutive year the basketball team went to a post-
season tournament. Last year, they lost to New York University on
the first round of the NCAA regional playoffs. This year, the Pan-
thers lost to Drake, 87-82, in the ﬁrst round of the National Invita-
tional Tournament at Madison Square Garden in New York.

The season started oﬂ slowly for Bob Timmons’s Panthers, who
won only four of their first eight games. But thevrest of the season
was just short of stellar. The Panthers won 13 of their last 16
games, including a 92-76 win over West Virginia University at
Fitzgerald Field House. Forward Brian Generalovich led the scoring
in that game with 22 points. “The General’s” playing that game
typiﬁes the kind of basketball game he played all year. But Gen-
eralovich was only one of the ﬁve seniors who made up the team
that went to two tournaments in two years. Others were guards
Dave Roman and Cal Shefﬁeld, center Paul Krieger, and forward
Dave Sauer. But the success of the team was also attributable to
the capable performance of guards Tim Grgurich and Larry Szy-
kowny, center Bob Lovette, and forward Daryl Ruby.

WRESTLING

Coach Rex Perry lost more men than Napoleon did march-
ing through Russia. Perry salvaged enough, however, to
win seven of nine matches, and ﬁnished runner-up by one
point to Lehigh for the Eastern championship. Tom Hall
and Mike Johnson both were undefeated in individual
meets. Johnson went on to win the outstanding wrestler
award in the Easterns in winning the 130-pound champion-
ship. Hall was second in the 167—pound class. The team
faltered in the NCAA and struggled to a 27th place ﬁnish,
Johnson unbelievably bowing in the ﬁrst round.

SWIMMING

The two workhorses of the swimming
team Rob and Ron Levine ﬁnished their
last year at the university last season but
even these two stars weren’t enough to
overcome the injuries which plagued
Coach Ben Grady’s swim squad. The
4-4 record of the team was highlighted
by some brilliant performances. In the
Easterns Rob Levine set the record for
the back stroke and took a second and
also set a Pitt record in the 500 yard
freestyle. Ron established a Pitt record
in the l00—yard butterﬂy. Don Hahn-
feldt also proved himself one of the best
divers in the East.

THE UNIVERSITY OF
PITTSBURGH has recently won
national recognition and intense
local pride for its progressive plans
for expansion and redevelopment.
Its face is being spectacularly
lifted. Yet, to the student here, it is
not the model in the Commons
Room which symbolizes his
University; it is his own world of
the moment—his classes, his
friends, his individual routine
blended with that of the University
—which fuses Pitt and its future
with his own.

TRACK

 

One of the most important prerequisites for a
winning season requires that a team must remain
healthy. Unfortunately, this year’s track squad
couldn’t maintain that standard. As a result, in
spite of a number of outstanding performances,
they ﬁnished up with a 3-4 mark.

The four defeats came at the hands of Navy,
Penn State, Ohio University, and West Virginia.
Although the first two were by a substantial mar-
gin the others could have been just as easily re-
versed. The Ohio loss was the direct result of an
injury to sprinter Bill DelVecchi0 while the West
Virginia meet found Joe Friend breaking his leg.
Top performers on this year’s squad were sprint-
ers DelVecchio and Dick Crout. Don Hinchberg—
er and John Bailey were both standout distance
runners.

 

   

GYMNASTICS

They changed the scoring system this year in the
Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnastics League, but
it did nothing but make the scores appear closer
than they really were. It didn’t help the Pan-
thers win, however, for they only won two of
eight meets, both victories against minor gym-
nastics competition——Slippery Rock and West Vir—
ginia. In the EIGL championships John Franchuk
finished 6th in the parallel bars and Ed Stim,
the team’s high scorer, ﬁnished 8th in the hori-
zontal bar. “The new system hurt us this sea-
son,” Bemis said. “But in the long run it’s still
the best method. I think that next year we’ll be
able to take better advantage of it.”

GOLF

Although the‘ Panther golf team
was only 3-14 last season they
improved by two wins over the
previous season’s record. The
Panthers play a top schedule in-
cluding such Eastern power-
houses as Navy, Penn State, and
Bucknell. The three wins that
the Panthers did manage to cap-
ture were Duquesne, Carnegie
Tech, and St. Vincent. New
coach J. Clyde Barton and Pro
Tom Connors from Charteirs
Country Club, the Panthers’ new
home course, have team scoring
leaders Phil Fassett and Bill
Baloh back again for the 1965
season.

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

TENNIS

The netters had a losing cam-
paign this year as they compiled
a 1-10 record. Tennis coach Ben
Pope cited Pitt’s lack of having
its own tennis courts as the ma-
jor cause for the poor season.
The outlook for the 1965 season
is also gloomy. In addition to
the lack of courts, the team will
be losing ﬁve members of its
eight—man squad. Team captain
Larry O’Loughlin and sopho-
more Tom Barber will be the
only returning players.

BASEBALL

The baseball team ﬁnished the season
with a 7-13 record. Coach Bobby Lewis
was optimistic about his team’s chances
at the beginning of the season, but as
time progressed, his enthusiasm waned
with the team’s fortunes.

Lewis counted on Doug Chambers to
pick up some of the hitting slack, but
the rangy catcher batted only .108. This
was indicative of the Panthers’ hitting all
year. “You can’t win when you don’t
score runs,” Lewis said. And the Pan-
thers didn’t score many runs. In only
three games did they score more than
four runs. They defeated Clarion, 8-0,
behind Dave Blyshak, lost to Dickinson,
10-9, and defeated Hiram, 11-3.

The Panthers’ Victory over Hiram was
their only win during the last two weeks
of this season. In the other games during
those weeks, the Panthers lost two dou-
ble—headers to Penn State’s Nittany Lions.

MR. AND MISS
PITT

Martha Holstein and Matthew Swetonic
were elected by a group of junior class
leaders to be Mr. and Miss Pitt of 1963-
64. The two seniors were thought to be
the outstanding individuals in the gradu-
ating class, on the basis of service, per-
sonal leadership and general excellence
in a variety of ﬁelds.

Mr. Swetonic, this year’s Pitt News ed-
itor-in-chief, has served on the Student
Aﬂairs Committee and as vice-president
of Pi Delta Epsilon, the national journal-
ism honorary. He was a member of both
Druids and Omicron Delta Kappa, the
senior men’s leadership honorary. Mr.
Swetonic, a native of Easton, Pennsyl-
vania, is graduating from the School of
Liberal Arts as a writing major.

Miss Holstein, who served as Student
Union Board Chairman this year, is a
member of Cwens, the Liberal Arts Cab-
inet and the Student Affairs Committee.
A Liberal Arts student, she has also

The Owl Hall of Fame traditionally recognizes and
honors the outstanding members of the graduating
class. A group of junior class leaders selects the
nominees on the basis of their general contributions to
the University. Primarily, this is a service award, not
particularly emphasizing academic achievement. Those
selected have served in a leadership capacity in some
area or areas vital to student life. The most outstand-
ing man and woman of those elected to the Hall of
Fame are named Mr. and Miss Pitt.

This year Matthew Swetonic, editor of the Pitt
News, and Martha Holstein, chairman of the Student
Union Board, were voted Mr. and Miss Pitt. Twenty
other outstanding seniors, ten men and ten women,
were named to the Hall of Fame.

ONE HUNDRED and twenty-

four credits later. . .

Undergraduates struggle through ninety-six credits, join or-
ganizations, make friends, and then, ﬁnally, become seniors.
Somehow the last 32 credits of work passes all too quickly.
They begin worrying and wondering whether it will be grad-
uate school or a job, Pittsburgh or New York or California,
the Navy or the Air Force. Suddenly the future becomes the
present, plans are made and changed and made again, and
the senior is a Pitt alumnus.

THE UNDERGRADUATE
makes his mark on the totality of
University life. Yet it is often only
through individual escape to his
chosen world of study that he
begins to discover his unique place
here; he begins alone to

discover himself.

focal point of the activity: the classroom.

NO MATTER WHAT THE
WEATHERMAN DECREES, summer ends
when shopping and packing for school begins.
Resident students develop triceps, lugging
trunks, suitcases, lamps, phonographs and
monstrous stuﬁed animals. Commuters heave
boxes of sweaters, coats and boots onto
streetcars heading home. Registration day
allows for no other plans than standing in
lines. And there follows the book hunt.

YEAR THAT BEGINS with the absurd means a
A year of strong oppositions, the absurd may
contrast with the sublime. In the ﬁrst week of
September in 1963, Pitt Players announced try-
outs and rehearsals for Edward Albee’s “The
Sandbox” and Eugene Ionesco’s “The Bald So-
prano.” Albee had distinguished himself in liter-
ary circles during the past year as being the man
who had not Won a Pulitzer Prize for “Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Wolf?” and whose subsequent
disappointment was shared by members of the
awards committee who resigned. Albee repre-
sented the heights of artistic independence and
endeared himself to the literati of college youth
throughout the nation.

Albee’s presence on the campus perhaps
sounded the keynote to a year of stimulation in
the classroom and in activities, sports and ro-
mances beyond the campus. Although few enough
students were aware of Albee, the truth is that
Albee was remarkably aware of them—-trying to
force them out of a compromise with mediocrity.
He has learned well from his great subsumer in
the Theater of the Absurd, Eugene lonesco whose
two plays, “Jack, or The Submission” and “The
Chairs,” played in June of 1964 and seemed to
cap a year of contrasts. It was a year of resist-
ance to compromise, a year when compromise
served not only the best end but the logical one,
a year of complete submission for those of least
independence. And ﬁnally the year-end revelation
that few enough Republicans on campus would
vote for Goldwater seemed either a submission

to the left or a resistance to the right. It was a
year of enduring contrasts and fruitful learning.
F EW UPPERCLASSMEN KNEVV when they arrived

that they would be viewed on nationwide
television. Freshmen had no idea that they would
write home, “Watch me on Hootenanny.” Josh
White led a troupe of folk singers into Fitzgerald
Music Hall to initiate a year of traditional and
contemporary music. The Student Union Board.’s
PM series sponsored “Jazz 80,” billed as a three-
credit course for non-music majors to help fulﬁll
interdisciplinary requirements. Singer Tony Mar-
tin was the headliner for Homecoming Weekend
festivities.

For the more sophisticated listener, the year
started early with a lecture by Miss Friedlind
Wagner, granddaughter of composer Richard
Wagner, who came to Pittsburgh as the personal
guest of the Pittsburgh Opera Company, which
premiered her grandfather’s opera, The Flying
Dutchman. The Pittsburgh Opera, the Pittsburgh
Symphony performed regularly within walking
distance of the University to the advantage of
a thousand students in an urban institution. The
Student Union Board brought pianist Paul Jacobs
to play a concert. The Metropolitan Opera Studio
presented Donizetti’s comic opera, D072 Pasquale,
in the Stephen Foster Memorial. Yet faculty in
the music department and students may have
been most thrilled, not by the professionals, but
by an amateur presentation. The Pitt Band, in its
Winter concert, played Larry Bernfeld’s own
composition and offered to the University an
example of a student’s own creativity as it can
be fostered and produced.

HANCELLOR EDVVARD LITCHFIELD that first week
testified before a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee in VVashington and urged the fed-
eral government to continue its support of the
Leaders Exchange Program. Litchﬁeld had helped
to establish this program in postwar Germany
when the need became apparent for Germany’s
new leaders to examine American methods. At
the same time as Dr. Litchﬁeld spoke in Wash-
ington, james H. Meredith, the ﬁrst Negro to be
graduated from the University of Mississippi,
spoke in the absence of The Reverend Martin
Luther King, and was also concerned with the
problem of leadership—the leadership that could
educate a people against hate and intolerance in
this country. He maintained the conviction that
his was an inevitable role, not for Meredith alone
but for the American Negro: “I was sure that if
I were killed, somebody else would take my

place someday. I do what I do because I must.”

Pitt students met Meredith’s challenge to edu-
cate for leadership as they sought to teach through
the Hill Education Project. HEP needs HELP
became a slogan, and campus leadership fell be-
hind the project when ODK committed a dona-
tion to the administrative work and the Chancel-
lor’s Oﬂice provided administrative help and
office space for the group under the auspices of
the director of educational resources.

BY JUNF. oi: 1964, the exterior of the Frick
Fine Arts library had been completed and
roofers were placing red tiles. Although few stu-
dents approved the Renaissance architecture, they
were impressed with the potential use; contem-
porary concrete facade had been poured by May
for the NASA structure adjacent to Engineering
Hall, and ground was broken on Forbes Street
for the Hillman Library at Commencement cere-
monies. For 1963, however, the only important
construction was the Towers Dormitories, white
concrete cylindrical towers that answered the
problem of housing a large population in a con-
centrated area.

The Towers dormitories opened and director
Curt Roemele felt that “The biggest surprise was
the large number of graduate students who re-
quired housing.” Undergraduates agreed with
him that “it will take a year to iron out the bugs
in this building.” By year’s end, an extra railing
had been installed along the sun deck to prevent
collision accidents. By the year’s end, the dark-

room in the Towers was in use, and by the year’s
end, an announcement was made that in addition
to the three towers opened this fall, two more
would be constructed within two years. Dave
Shaeffer was one of the first students to move in-
to the rooms and his comment: “The desks are
large and there are good study facilities. There is
everything for university living.” And although
there were no shower heads in any of the towers
that ﬁrst day, “Ajax,” “Bab-O,” and “Comet”
were shortly equipped for 1150 students, 62 per
cent of capacity. At the end of the year, reser-
vations for September 1964 indicated that the
Towers would be ﬁlled to capacity—as the Dean
of Men’s oﬂice sought additional funds for coun-
selors.
BUILDING an improved University in an urban
area is not easy, socially or economically.
The forces that prevent change are overwhelm-
ing, and by the end of the school year state aid to
private institutions was threatened by contro-
versy before the State Board of Education. Early
in the year, the Chancellor was forced to de-
nounce the statements of certain legislators in
Harrisburg who based arguments against such
aid on myopic viewpoints of basic cash output.
Late in June, 1964, speaking before a dinner
meeting of the university’s Johnstown campus
advisory board and alumni, he said, “The Com-
monwealth is getting more value for its taxpayers’
money by contributing partial support to private
institutions than by trying to duplicate the same
facilities at public expense.”

He said State—aided colleges have demonstrated
their public responsibility by establishing lower-
cost regional campuses, tuition differentials for
in state students, and private programs of urban
renewal and industry—oriented research.

He urged that a formula for continued state-
aid be established as soon as possible.

A Pitt News editorial in June supported the
need for state aid and blasted antagonists of such
aid. The editor wrote, “They do not see the hu-
man assets to the Pittsburgh area in the form of
research engineering, school administrative and
teaching staffs, and lawyers graduating from a
school helped by state funds.”

The debate will swell in an election year and
Pitt will ﬁnd it increasingly diﬁicult to obtain
land at reasonable rates for expansion.

In the meantime Pitt continues to receive in—~
creased federal grants to study means to provide
economic relief for Appalachia. And early in
June, Chancellor Litchﬁeld became one of four

incorporators of a new private corporation estab-
lished to make commercial use of the scientiﬁc
development produced by pure research in the
laboratories of the University, the Oakland Re-
search and Development Corporation.

REDICTIONS in June indicated that the 1964

freshman class may exceed 1800 students, a
considerable jump from 1100 three years ago.
The dramatic change has resulted, not solely from
the inﬂux of war babies and students from Metro-
politan New York, but from the establishment
of a new concept in institutional education-
regional campuses for the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Dr. Litchﬁeld has expressed the University
philosophy is the University’s establishing new
College centers in Greensburg, Titusville, and
Bradford in addition to the 50-year old campus
of Johnstown College: “The regional campuses
are an extension of the University’s service to all
of Western Pennsylvania. The regional campuses
are not simply junior colleges. Their programs
will be a cross-section of the programs in Oak-
land. Standards will be maintained at the same
high level which we strive for here in Pittsburgh.
It is the University of Pittsburgh’s contribution
to the massive problem facing the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania to provide educational
facilities for the greatly increased demands of
the future.”

The regional colleges opened with a ﬂurry of
excitement in each community and it has not
quieted yet. Bradford College expanded so
quickly that the school purchased the Bradford
Hotel late in the year for dormitory students.

The quality of faculty has been impressive,
among them younger members such as Paul Zol-
brod, an Atlantic Monthly prize winner and Ful-
bright scholar who taught English at Titusville.
Jerry Whalen, former director of Men’s Hous-
ing, became assistant to the president at Bradford
with responsibilities that ranged from administer-
ing counseling to dormitory students to teaching
English.

The ofﬁcers of the Westmoreland County Mu-
seum of Art offered classroom space in the mu-
seum for art lectures; The Bradford Era devoted
a special edition in tribute to the College.
AMYTHICAL STORY about an Ivy League pro-

fessor reﬂects the attitude that most stu-
dents wish professors would adopt. Asked which
University employed him, the professor replied,
“Sir, the University works for me.” The total
structure of the college divisions should exist to

reﬂect the attitudes and teachings of faculty.

Speaking in the Last Lecture series, Dr. Arthur
Tuden, associate professor of anthropology
dwelt on the need to eliminate some of the in-
justices in our society. He said, “We have
learned to think unemployment is a part of our
society. We don’t see our poor; they are unin-
corporated into our society; we tend to overlook
them.” He spoke desperately: “If our economic
allocation among the various classes gets any
worse, it could produce “a bleeding, cancerous
sore.”

Colin Sterne, associate professor of music and
his wife, leading The Antiqua players, playing
the viols and virginals, presented madrigals by
the Shakespearean orchestrator John Dowland in
the year celebrating the quadricentennial of Wil-
liam Shakespeare.

Dr. Richard Cottam, professor of political sci-
ence, claimed that he had “nothing profound to
say” when he delivered his “Last Lecture” to the
University community. But he did voice alarm
in the growth of stagnation and mediocrity in
our society, a falling off of values, and a lack of
direction in Western society. The intellectual
must provide the answer; he must ﬁrst discard
the idea that he can, or should, do value—free
work. He must give attention to the real problem
of society as much as the journalist attends to the
problems; and he must become directly involved
in politics. Professor Cottam stated that the gen-
eral public has been over-idealized, and he chal-
lenged students to escape this public enervation,
to avoid the dull, unimaginative, and hard—to-
move.

A Pitt N ews feature writer congratulated visit-
ing Mellon professor of mathematics Leonard
Roth on an intriguing and amusing Mellon Lec-
ture speech on “Geometry and the Scientiﬁc
Imagination.” Roth stated that the creative im-
agination in science, as elsewhere has to buck the
establishment to get anywhere but there, as no-
where else, it roams with the gods. In a light
tone, inspired by the professor, the writer ex-
plained the speech, noting its inconoclasm, its
sarcasm, and its satire—all with the intent to im-
prove the human mind.

Dr. Albert Martin, professor of political sci-
ence and dean of the School of Liberal Arts, had
forebodings when he planned his “Last Lecture.”
“I started to feel that my last lecture would be
ﬁfty minutes of silence, punctuated by sighs . . .”
Dr. Martin felt that there are “Public Responsi-
bilities in the Educated Man.” The University
must obtain a lever on the power structure of
the society within which it exists,” if it is to make
a signiﬁcant contribution. At the same time as
the University develops a liberal education, it
must be careful not to force the determined

specialist to become a generalist, or they might
lose him.” The Liberal Arts dean views educa-
tion liberally.

One student described Dr. Edward F. Cooke,
associate professor in political science, as a man
“who runs his classes like ward meetings‘ . . . He
lacks only the cigar to be Boss Tweed.”

An active politician who has campaigned for a
seat in Congress, Dr. Cooke delivered one of
three basic speeches in the 1962 campaign to as
many as three groups in an evening—each speech
lasting ﬁve to ﬁfteen minutes depending on the
occasion and need for prolonging the agony un-
til another party candidate came along to pick
up the reins while he took off for another rally.
“If things work out all right, you’re following
each other around,” said Dr. Cooke, “The idea
is to keep the meetings going.”

Dr. Cooke’s classes earn practical training in
the art of political action.

PU3LIcATI()Ns IN A UNIVERSITY serve the pur-
pose of education and communication. Dr.
Agnes Starrett, for 35 years editor of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Press, retired this year at a time
when the Press published several of its most stim-
ulating books. A three-volume planning study on
the economic, social, and geographical growth of
Western Pennsylvania has received world—wide
circulation. Rashi and the Christian Scholars, a
book two years in the making, appeared to fur-
ther demonstrate the intellectual thought of post-
Biblical scholars during the Middle Ages. The
Buhl Foundation presented the Press with a grant
to provide every high school in Western Penn-
sylvania with copies of the Press’s most outstand-
ing art book, Wild Flowers of Pennsylvania in
two volumes. The Reasonable Adventurer ap-

peared in paperback, Dr. Roy Heath’s unparal-

leled study of forty students through four years
of college from the time of their admittance. A
University Press produces those necessary vol-
umes that inform the academic community of
permanent contributions to the ﬁeld of scholar-
ship and research.

Mrs. Starrett had served as a member of THE
OWL executive committee and as a member of
the Student Publications Board during her years
as editor of the University Press.

HE INTERNATIONAL APPEAL of the University
Thas skyrocketed with a University faculty
advisory team at the University of Ecuador, with
the expansion of the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, and with the full—scale
operation of the Office of Cultural and Educa-
tional Exchange.

The International Students Committee estab-
lished a “brother-sister program to orient foreign
students to this academic community. Han Nyo,
Burmese student and senior in metallurgy felt

that the best channels for building friendships
exist in helping foreign students to ﬁnd housing,
to register, to understand American customs, to
give them companionship, and to take them to
cultural activities. Han Nyo stated that one of
the greatest diﬂiculties in the program is the
proportion of American and foreign students-
“Ninety per cent of the 90 foreign students are
men, and 90 per cent of the 90 American stu-
dents participating in the program are women.”
One American student, however, thought differ-
ently. He joked, “It’s the thing to do for the girls
to date foreign students, I can’t even get a date
with my girl.”

The International Students sponsored a night
club mixer during the Spring trimester and a
picnic to Deer Valley. A chartered trip was
planned for the VVorld’s Fair. YWCA and its
faculty—visitation program prompted foreign stu-
dents to meet in faculty homes. And a com-
mittee of Indian students traveled to the river for
a sacramental memorial ceremony in memory of
the late President. VVhen Nehru passed away,
300 Indian students met in the Student Union
Ballroom to pay tribute to this memory.

Foreign students worked on the staffs of The
Pitt New: and WPGH and became involved in
extra—curricular programs with Americans. In
October, International VVeek was celebrated with
dances and with two forums—“The Image of
America abroad” and “United Nations—F act or
Fancy?”
T HE ENGLISH VVRITER C.P. Snow has assessed

the current college generation favorably. The
new generation, “more sensitive, more sensible,
more fully human,” can provide the force to
banish the “ghastly gulf” between the rich and
the poor countries, he told 37oo students and
faculty at the Winter Honors Convocation.

Two-thirds of the world, in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America, is in a situation that “we cannot
contemplate without a feeling of profound guilt,”
Pitt N €"LL‘X reporter Nancy Delaney recorded him
as saying that day. “Our surplus will have to
go to them,” Snow said.

Their plight parallels that which existed all
over the world, particularly in the western coun-
tries, zoo to 3oo years ago. How the lucky coun-
tries managed to pull out of this “animally misera-
ble existence” no one knows; but being among
the lucky, “we cannot contract out of the pas-
sionate concern of our time.”

THE FRESHMAN’S FIRST TRIMESTER
is a curious fabric of joining and shying away,
of being accepted and not always being ready
to accept. The Freshman Camp brings the men
together informally before classes begin to
make their demands. The women are officially
welcomed into the academic community during

Lantern Night ceremonies. The coed freshman
outing attempts to unite the class.

The art of being
a non-conformist

or why many perceptive yearbook
staffs prefer a very distinguished
publishing house

Retaining one’s individuality is not easy in
these days of mass production and stand-
ardization. This is especially true of year-
book publishing, in which mass production
methods have the tendency to force one to
buy just what the other fellow buys.

Making of soap or soup or salad dress-
ing by mass methods is one thing. But it
is quite another to attempt to produce a
creative yearbook by trying to squeeze it
into some pre-conceived mold. It just can't
be done that way.

The Wm. J. Keller firm brings together
highly trained craftsmen, the very finest
papers and ink of superlative quality. Add
to these a unique service plan built around
the individual school, and, finally, produc-
tion by the Velvatone process, which Keller
perfected especially for the printing of
yearbooks, and you have a truly distin-
guished performance. Ld a yearbook with
singular character and individuality . . .
we call it “THE LOOK OF THE BOOK."

The yearbook you are presently leafing
through is the product of the Keller custom
program. if you would care to see other
examples of “THE LOOK OF THE BOOK”
as produced by Wm. J. Keller, get in touch

The OWL works UNDER PRESSURE caught in a
whirl of deadlines, exams, copy, papers, photographs,
and lost photogs. Too many man hours seem necessary.
But somehow a book forms. Bleary eyes, raw nerve end-
ings, coﬁee stains, and even a few cut classes can be
found between the pictures. This year many of these be-
long to Diane and Earl my “here to the bitter end”
crew, even though deadlines did last and last and last.
Janey, who had the misfortune of being friend-to—the—
editor, doubled as copywriter and editor analyst—-—help-
ing to supply ideas and analyzing the traumatic states
of an editor in the delicate condition of an overdue
deadline. To Lynne, George, and all the staff members
who helped, thanks. Special thanks also go to photog-
sitter Maria and photogs Vern, Ron, Bob, and “it’s al-
most done” Wally. To John and his merry band—-—it has
been a lively and good year, I’ve enjoyed working with
you.

Jean Kornfeld, Editor

I credit the success of the business staff to a ﬁne co-op-
erative effort by everyone. First, I would like to express
a great deal of thanks to Paul who did just about every-
thing from stufﬁng hundreds of envelopes to ﬁxing win-
dows and who was always there when the chips were
down. My special thanks to Ed and his staff for breaking
sales records. For the ﬁne advertising section I owe
thanks to Mel, Bob, and Frank. I am indebted to Shirley
who did a great job with the organizations, Sherm who
kept a cautious eye on our accounts, and Joan who kept
a cautious eye on Sherm. I am very proud to have
worked with Jean and her staff in producing this year-
book. My greatest debt goes to two people whose inspi-
ration and trust have made them as much a part of the
OWL and Pitt as I am. Thanks Mom and Dad for being
there all the time.

IT IS OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM where
student life expands and develops into its all
time-consuming pattern. Here the theoretical
classroom discussions are continued, or are
substituted by the practical. Notebooks and
texts are borrowed, questions are answered; in
the process, cigarettes and coﬁee are

consumed, and friendships are made.

All
31

IN THE CLASSROOM, the
student learns to develop his own
shorthand in the languages of
literature, physics or anthropology.
Surrounded by French drapes,
English coats-of-arms, starkly
modern walls or crumbling plaster,
he hears and scribbles and thinks.
Often he seeks more than he can
transcribe. He learns to approach
the lecturer, and discovers a need
for a solitary place to sort and
digest what he knows, or wants

to know.

4.4

 

The classroom was the focal point
of the student’s purpose in being
here; the professor was the reason
the classrooms were here. From
lecture hall to seminar, from
laboratory to Theatre I], from Old
Mellon to the Cathedral, students
went, and listened. They took
notes, absorbed what they could,
and then returned to question.
PROFESSORS INSPIRED,
ENRAGED AND
TANTALIZED. Students learned,
and discovered friends.

THE CLASSROOM IS ONLY THE
FIRST STEP. Students surge and shuﬁ‘le
among books. The ﬁfth ﬂoor library teems with
searchers and researchers; the sixth, with
tranquil readers and panicked crammers.
Liberal arts students develop specialized
interests, and join the discoverers at the
medical, science and business libraries. Some
return to their rooms to learn. When the sun
shines, they pour onto the campus, books and
notebooks in hand.

THE SUN GOES DOWN, and

students swell the ranks of rush-

hour trafﬁc or watch it crawl by as

they walk homeward. The Oakland 
parking lots empty out and reﬁll, as

day students carry their books

home, and are replaced by night

scholars, quickly adjusting from

ofﬁce to classroom.

HOME FOR A LARGE SEGMENT OF
UNIVERSITY COEDS, is a self-contained world a block
from the Cathedral. Dorms and sorority suites are
occasional places of study; for the most part, they provide
a hectic balance to life. The girls talk and laugh and cry
there. They iron clothes, set hair, dash on lipstick, and
emerge into the lobby coolly smiling to meet a date.

The girls’ DORM LOBBIES are
host to swarms of couples coming
and going, and men patiently
shuffling through magazines as
their dates change clothes upstairs.
At curfew time an occasional
father wanders in and scurries out.
Since they opened in September,
the Towers lobbies, too, have
become centers of social activity.

IN SEPTEMBER, FRESHMEN AND
UPPERCLASSMEN ALIKE shared the
confusion of even and odd meal ticket
numbers, and one-way stairways to and from
food. Oldtimers appreciated the shorter lines in
the new cafeterias, which surprised even the
most blase’eaters with occasional mood-setting
nationality dinners. ‘

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

THE TUCK SHOP serves
as an oasis in the struggle
with notebooks and blue
books. Some students
cannot escape the pressure
even there, carrying books,
unable to ignore the sweep
of the clock. But others pass
through the line, smilingly
anticipating a casual

rendezvous with friends and
44 a deck of cards.

THE SURROUNDING OAKLAND AREA allows the
student respite from his work, and permits him to enter a
larger, more diversiﬁed world. A composite of a motley
assortment of individuals and institutions, Oakland
welcomes and encompasses the student. It serves as a
source of pizza, cosmetics, ski jackets and ﬂowers. It
provides a leisurely dinner-date, a quick cup of coﬁee, or a
convivial beer. In Oakland one may sometimes ﬁnd a
parking space, an opera or a worship service. It is host to
the Symphony, to art exhibits and to dinosaurs.

50 In an increasingly real sense, PITT AND
OAKLAND are becoming ‘inextricably bound.

Gradually, the view from the Oval is changing;

0akland’s skyline is rising. Bulldozers screech

and whine. The Towers point the way. The

Fine Arts Building symbolically rises and takes

shape, as the ghostly Park Schenley echoes its

‘ sounds. Tiny stickers cower on slums,

squeaking out against the progress; but the
silent heights of the Cathedral continue to
Zoom high above the noise and dust now
intrinsic in the Oakland at_mosphere.

Pitt is rapidly becoming a
major SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH center. This
inquiry is multi-faceted,
rushing to meet present 5 3
challenges and provide fu-
ture hopes. The means and
methods range from the
Van de Graaf)‘ on the hill to
the laboratories of men like
Dr. P. G. Katsoyannis,
whose team of researchers
this year succeeded in syn-
thesizing the complex
insulin molecule.

THE STUDENT UNION swarmed with
crowds of students and their elders, all
purposefully headed toward the Ballroom or
Lower Lounge. Here M endes-F rance spoke,
and answered questions. John Kenneth
Galbraith and Betty F riedan attracted diverse
audiences. These and other Midday Series
speakers stimulated and often aroused the
audience; the evening P.M. Series relaxed and
refreshed them.

IT WAS A YEAR OF
EXPLOSIONS. Perhaps the
most apparent was the
newly-matured awareness of
the immediacy of social
problems. Speakers like
James Meredith, Sargent
Shriver and John Lewis
presented the problems and
their solutions. Student

reaction in each case

THE VIBRANCY STAYED
after the guests left, and it grew
and spread to form student
organizations like the Hill
Education Project and the
Pittsburgh Volunteers Association.
Students marched, and they
preached and they tutored. They
emerged from the shelter of their
University, and they talked and
walked. They found new roads to
self-actualization; they looked and
saw and learned.

Perhaps only THE SILENCE OF THE
FOUR DAYS could adequately speak.
Emotions were wrested from where they lay
buried, and suﬁused the whole of the being.

U nbelieving and stunned, students listened and
read and watched. They did not talk. They
cried often, but seldom sobbed. It was too
deep, too personal to tell. And everyone

else knew.

THE ROARS OF VICTORY or
disappointment could be heard all the way
over to Forbes Avenue, as the mobs at the
Stadium thronged and cheered and the

team worked. It was the best season

known by this student population, and the
spirit lasted after the goalposts were torn
down. It predominated in Tuck Shop chatter,
and was evidenced in a quad memorial.

IT WAS A YEAR OF THE
GUITAR. Its informal sounds
carried from sorority suites to the
Towers and over to the Student
Union. And it came into its
professional own up in the Field
House, where the television

Hootenanny originated in the fall.

It brought professionals to inspire
the amateurs, who quickly joined
in and could be heard singing,
strumming and clapping for
months thereafter.

This year it was indeed a
HOMECOMING
WEEKEND—alumni from
many classes, residents of
far-flung states, joined the
undergraduates in activities
spanning the entire
weekend. The ﬂoats were
paraded proudly, justifying
weeks of dungaree-clad
napkin stuﬁers’ toil. And
the lovely queen gracefully
accepted her duty to oversee
the festivities.

THE SNOWS CAME and buried gay and drab alike. It
softened shadows and rounded corners, thrilling aesthetes
and maddening drivers. It provided the hush which muffled
Christmas celebrations this year, and spread its peace from
the holy to the secular. Its density provided respite from
classes, its texture welcomed trays abducted from the

cafeteria, and its whiteness was seen through occasional
pairs of sunglasses.

There are vast diﬁerences
between city snow and
mountain snow. Skiiers and
non-skiiers alike went to
Seven Springs, as part of
WINTER WEEKEND
festivities, to ﬁnd out. They
returned, soggy and red-
cheeked and laughing, to
change clothes and dash
over to the dance where the
weekend royalty

was crowned.

boA
A TOUCH OF LAS VEGAS,
with perhaps the occasional
inﬂuence of a psych lab and Coney
Island cotton candy, merged into
the throng of participants and
spectators at the Winter Carnival.

Familiar faces dotted the crowds; it
was a night when inhibitions were
left at the door.

IT BEGAN IN MIDNIGHT
CONFERENCES and long inter-fraternity
meetings, and then burst out to engulf the
freshman class. The Greeks were out to display
what they are, and what they have to oﬁer, and
the freshmen, even the most disinterested, were
caught up in the whirl. There followed the
extremes of exultation and despair for the
accepted and rejected, and then near-despair
for the pledge classes’ napkin-stuffing ﬂoat-
builders. When the excitement waned, other
duties rushed in to ﬁll the time.

The year was one which deﬁed pri-
vacy. Headlines tore out from the
papers and burned themselves so
deeply into individual hearts and
minds that no middle course re-
mained. The individual again
surged to the forefront of signif-
icant existence. Strong minds were
made up, and the weaker had to
be led. There were battles of all
scopes and intensities: political,
intellectual, social and humane.
And there was the ever-constant

inner battle: the revelation of
emotion and the search for larger
truths capable of encompassing the
ferment. It was a year when the
most personal grief was shared in
common, and when causes of com-
mon interest became individual
crusades.

GREEK ACTIVITIES surround,
and ﬁnally culminate in the diverse
calendar of events signifying Greek
Week. It is a loud, happy break
from study, with a Queen to make
it oﬁicial, parties to make it swing,
and surreptitious glances at books
to make it conscienceable.

 

SAINT PATRICK CAME DOWN BIGELOW
BOULEVARD to share his birthday with Pitt's engineers.
His spirit reigned traditionally over the week of activities,
dedicated to a peek into the future of the profession.
Events ranged from serious displays to both mental and
physical tugs-of-war among departments. The Shamrock
Award at the culmination of the seven full days helped the

University’s engineers keep Saint Patrick in Engineers’
Week.

IT WAS A YEAR WHEN visiting Cadets
snowed the women and disgruntled the men;
when the Towers became entrenched in daily
routine; and when undergraduates developed
ties with “brothers” and “sisters” here from
afar. It was an active year of politics, formal
and informal. Hopes for closening student and
administration points of view began with S.U.
Coffee Hours, and continued on to general
campaigns for student facilities. There were
nominations and promises, elections and
awards, winners and losers.

THE LINES OF MULTI-COLORED
HOODS stretched from the Fifth Avenue
entrance to the Cathedral down and across
the street, to Soldiers’ and Sailors’
Memorial in the fall, and to the Mosque in
the winter. Students watched from the
street, from cars, from windows, as
carriers of knowledge in all its diversity
slowly marched by, to hear the Chan-
cellor’s State of the University address in
the fall, and to see and hear C. P. Snow on
a rainy winter day.

THE RAINS CAME, and almost
at the point of despair, the sun
emerged. It was suddenly warm,
and buds popped out and stretched
into leaves. The solid earth turned
to mud, and sprouted crocuses and
grass. Students let books remain
cold, heedless of exams and papers,
and ambled in pairs, smiling and
coatless. They evacuated buildings,
filled the quad and spilled into

the park.

The general exodus came in
April. Everyone left, and
THEN SOME CAME
BACK without ski jackets
and with bathing suits. They
went back to classes in
Bermudas, and even
studying wasn't dismal when
it could be done while
tanning. Even the new
Towers tried to bloom for
their ﬁrst summer.

OAKLAND WELCOMES

three new
cam puses——Brad ford,

Titusville and Greensburg.

In recent years, the scope of in-
terest and inﬂuence of the Univer-
sity has gone far beyond the Cathe-
dral of Learning, which has become
the focal point of far-reaching edu-
cational projects. Not only does the
Cathedral now attract students
from far-ﬂung areas of the country
and the world, but it has sent its
own representatives out into this
world. Part of the mountain of
knowledge—seekers comes to the
Cathedral; the Cathedral goes to
other parts.

It is the aim of the University to
extend the boundaries of human
knowledge qualitatively, in terms of
study and research, and quantita-
tively, in terms of reaching the
largest possible number of potential
students. It has welcomed students
from Asia and Africa, and has sent
disseminators of knowledge to
South America. Yet a most impor-
tant part of this stretch has its
center in communities within the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
itself.

The two—year college is a rapidly
expanding institution, offering the
foundations of an increasingly-
necessary higher education to an
expanded student population. Pitts-
burgh experimented years ago with
this type of subsidiary campus at
Johnstown, and it has ﬂourished.
Now three other regional campuses
have been established as part of the
educational complex of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. They are in
Bradford, Greensburg and Titus-
ville, Pennsylvania.

Still young enough to set high and difficult goals for
itself, and well enough established to hope to carry
them out, the Bradford Campus embodies the dynamism
which has come to be associated with its mother Uni-
versity.

Hamsher House is the focus of activity here, housing
language and science laboratories and classrooms in
which its two—year undergraduate program is taking
shape. Traditional mahogany contrasts with gleaming
metal to prove that elegance and functionalism are com-
patible.

The central aim of this growing educational institu-
tion is total education of the individual—something
which cannot be attained in the classroom alone. A di-
versity of backgrounds among students helps the inter-
change of ideas and experiences; many of the under-
graduates here, of course, are from the Bradford area,
but there are enough others from New York, Massachu-
setts, Vermont and several other states to achieve a bal-
ance of working harmony and intellectual stimulation.
The comfortable lounge, with its inviting fireplace in
Hamsher House, and the traditional Pitt Tuck Shop are
meeting grounds for talking and for relaxing. There are
four men’s residences and one women’s dormitory where
the students extend the day’s challenges into late night
bull sessions, or release tension through pillow ﬁghts.
Supplementing the concentration of the classroom and
the informality of the dormitory is a growing intramurals
program, which also helps to unify those who work in
and for the Bradford campus.
