imester year

tr

. . . a new scnoo/year—ana’ with it comes a new group of
freshmen exposed for tlzeﬁrst time to Oakland, its stores,
concert nails, and parks. T/ze upperc/assmen see the new
faces, and at t/ze same time see themselves as t/zey were,
eager, out uncertain. ./is time passes, the freshman
/earns he must seek out ot/zerfreslzmen w/zo, a/one among
the sophisticated apperc/assmen, will share his enthusi-

asm over a new city, a new life.

vcv

Freshman Camp is the ﬁrst taste of college lie
that the green men encounter. Each year they
come—for guidance, for orientation, for friendly
competition with their new classmates. Each year
a hoary upperclassman instills into the new-
comers a little spirit, a little pride, and perhaps
a yea/later some of these same newcomers will
he the ones who smile knowingly and lead the

way for still more green men.

To /zeig/zten /zis a/ready confused im-
pression of college life, a freshman
goes to registration. He stands in
lines, makes new friends, stands in
more lines, and ﬁnally emerges tri-
ump/zantiy with nothing to s/zow for
his day out a small white se/zedule

card.

:1

Dorm life is often a strange experience for

the freshman. He locates the cafeteria and
the TV Lounge, goes to Student Union
dances, and is contentfor a while. But later
he remembers promises made to himself and

turns to his hooks with a new enthusiasm.

While later—starting friends from State and
Tech are swimming and pieniching, the
Pitt student swelters in stuﬁy classrooms.
He tries vainly to get his summer—logged
mind adjusted to the task of taking notes,
out ﬁnds that learning does not ﬂourish in

90° temperatures.

The upperclassman faces the return to
school with mixed emotions. He enjoys re-
newing friendships and exchanging vacation
stories, but there is always the reading list
and term paper assignment that he receives
the ﬁrst day of class. The adjustment is made
gradually, but after two weeks of classes he
ﬁnds it dzﬁcult to rememher a time when he

was not in school.

 

I9

11 valuable part of an individual’s
college career is his association, how-
ever brief, with the fraternity and
sorority world. During rushing the
freshman goes to parties, watches
skits, and talks to individual active
members. Whether or not the fresh-
man eventually pledges a social or-
ganization, he has learned something
from rushing~about Greeks and
about himself.

On September 24, Nikita Khrushchev, while
visiting the United States, came to Pitt. The
daily routine of classes was abandoned and stu-
dents sought vantage points to view the arriving
Mr. K., a pudgy man in a light suit. Those who
saw him as he passed through the police cordon
into the Union or as he left in an open convertible,
jovially waving his hat and beaming, thought he
looked like anything but the head of the Com-
munist world, rather like a truekdriver, or per-

haps a butcher.

Friday night, dusl<—and the students gather at a
bonﬁre rally in Bubbles’ Field. .4 spark of spirit
which lies dormant during the day is somehow
kindled by the ﬂames at night. ﬂfterwards there

will be a Student Union dance or a house party

with the talk everywhere of tomorrow’s game.

The air is sharp and smells of leaves and
coming winter. The stadium ﬁlls with men
and women hundled warmly in hright
clothes: reds and greens, plaids. Blankets,
scarves and gloves are everywhere. Confetti
and clear brass notes ﬁll the air as the march-
ing hand struts from yardline to yardline.
The game begins and the Panthers rip oﬂ a
long gain hringing the crowd to its feet. The
student shouts his support and knows that
the school year has really started.

28

The aest weekend of the year is Homecoming.
Parties, ﬂoats, a queen, t/ze game, a dance
ﬁll the weekend with /zurried social activity
set in a competitive atmosphere. But when
at last it’s over and Monday morning dawns
origlzt and sterile, the student ﬁnds t/zat mem-

ories are already beginning to fade.

1 \

.\

When dar/eness descends on Oa/e/and, /ig/its
Min/e on in the Catizedral and education can-
tinues as evening classes aegin. The steady
evening student is resigned, ant t/ze day stu-
dent with se/zeda/e diﬁeulties ﬁnds it lzard
to adjust to the nearly deserted nails and the

darkness aeyond t/ze windows.

30

To the majority of students who have no
evening classes, Pitt’s social life at night is
as diversiﬁed as the individual’s imagination,
ﬁlled with all the possihilities a great city has
to oﬁer. It ranges from the hanality of a
twin—horror hill at the Strand to the over-

whelming power of Beethoven’s Ninth Sym-

phony to a kiss somewhere in the quiet «—

darkness.

The niglzt at Pitt is not always for study or
entertainment. /{cross tlze eity—campas ae-
tivigr slows out never ceases. Researclzers,
editors, Players worlc on to aecornplislz t/zeir
individual tasles, to develop a serum, to pub-

lislz a newspaper, or to present a new slzow.

  
  
 
 
 
  

During the year many famous people come
to Pitt——philosophers, poets, politicians.
The students who see them in the Union
Ballroom or talk to them in smaller gather-
ings often go only out of curiosity, hut in
most cases they come away with a new idea,

a fresh viewpoint.

x» p

Learning at its best is an individaalproeess
——an exchange of ideas between student and
teaelzer. This exe/iange ean come in large
lecture sessions as well as in small, intimate
classes. The faculty memaer w/20 has time
to listen is one of t/te most essential attri-

aates of a growing University.

To he/ong to a fraternity or sorority means more
than merely sitting in one hooth in the Tue/6
Shop and wearing the same pin. In working to-
gether, whether it he on a Homeeomingﬂoat or a
service project, the Greeks ﬁna’ a deeper meaning
in the wordfriendship. It is something that re-
mains long after the pin and Tuck Shop are
things of the past.

There is a refreshing spirit of camaraderie
among the memhers of student puhlications
that is unknown to most other non—social
organizations. The fourth ﬂoor of the Stu-
dent Union is the composite area where one
argues philosophy with the lit magazine
staﬂ, listens to the Pitt News FM radio,
and chec/as the Owl bulletin hoard for new
jokes. Without this amity it would he diﬁi—
cult to hear the late hours, the sacriﬁced study
time, and the periodic criticism from helow

and ahove.

45

Whether or not he realizes it, the student, when
he eomes to eollege, will ﬁnd a place uniquely
suited to his interests and personality. For some
it is not found easily. But eventually the search
ends for the majority with student government, a
fraternity, the Owl, or perhaps the first hooth in
the Tuele Shop. Others, never eompletebz satisﬁed,

change plaees—~and values.

It is diﬁicult to tell exactly when winter comes to
Pittsburgh. There is usually little snow, hut the
piercing cola’ refuses to ease for many days at a
time. Those accustomed to warmer temperatures
pull on gloves and extra sweaters and thank the

unseen powers who provide a University has to

huildings on the hill.

47

ﬂs the ﬁrst trimester speeds to a close, the
student ﬁnds himself alternately cramming
for ﬁnals, Christmas shopping, and attend-
ing his last classes. Christmas parties and
ﬁnals come on the same day and there
scarcely seems time to get everything in. But
when the last ﬁnal is taken, and there is
nothing left out two weeles of uninterrupted
rest, the student realizes one of the advan-
tages of the trimester——a Christmas without

term papers.

Winter means indoor activities of one sort or another. For those not en-

that oasis in the midst of the academic desert, the Tuck Shop. The world ’s
problems are never solved there; more talleing is done than thinking. But
outside, away from the worn hooths and paper cups, it’s cold and lonely.

homecoming

A DISMAL QUEEN’S ATTENDANT, a
rainy day, and a badly beaten team tipiﬂed
Homecoming 1960; it was not quite the day it
could have been.

Rain, mud, and Panthers’ loss

Homecoming is that time in the fall of the year when alumni
think of revisiting the campus; when Greeks imagine huge,
gaily decorated, animated ﬂoats, and pretty co—eds dream of
being a Queen. Homecoming 1960 at Pitt was that way. The
alumni made their pilgrimage back to Oakland and looked
with pride upon the new buildings and property recently ac-
quired by Pitt in the expansion program. The Greeks worked
long hours, day and night, planning, building, and decorating

unusual and complicated ﬂoats depicting song titles. Nancy A

Ahlgren was crowned the Homecoming Queen, and reigned
over the week’s events. Her Maid of Honor was Donna Smith,
and Mary Grace MacKenzie, Nancy Noethling, and Barbara
Volkin were the Queen’s Attendants.

For the first time in three years, the ﬂoat parade was held

on Friday evening in Schenley Plaza, leaving the participating “

groups free that night for party—hopping at the fraternity
houses. After the parade a bonﬁre pep—rally was held at Bub-
bles Field near the Cathedral.

Spirits were high and the students were hopeful for a vic-
tory against powerful Syracuse. It was all to no avail, how-
ever, for Saturday dawned grey and dreary, and the Pitt fans
sat in drizzling rain to watch the Panthers lose 35-o.

On Saturday night, students and alumni danced to the
music of Maynard Ferguson in the Commons Room of the
Cathedral of Learning, and cheered as the winners of the ﬂoat
parade were announced.

Despite the poor weather and the team’s loss, the students

would not allow anything to spoil their week. They had a 7

great time and all things considered it was a good Home-
coming.

THE FIRST PLACE FLOAT, depicting the Seven
Dwarf’s song, “Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho,” was constructed by Theta
Phi Alpha and Phi Kappa Theta.

ﬂcould not dull spirit of Pitt students

PARTY-HOPPING at the fraternity houses followed a successful ﬂoat parade
Friday night. Open parties at the houses were a new addition to Homecoming

this year.

“BALI HAI,” the second place ﬂoat, was entered by Delta Delta Delta and Delta Sigma Phi.

NANCY AHLGREN was crowned Homecoming
Queen for 1960. With her attendants, she presided
over the week’s events ending with the dance in

the Commons Room Saturday night.

MANPOWER, so necessary in the construction of a ﬂoat and in
the manipulation of its moving parts, is also put to use in trans-
porting the ﬂoat from one work area to another.

THE THIRD PLACE FLOAT, built by Kappa Alpha Theta
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, depicted the song “Street of Dreams.”

 

‘ FLOAT FIGURES are constructed, painted, and securely wired often days be-
*"“ . fore the ﬂoat parade takes place. A hastily built ﬂoat stands little chance of placing
in the tight competition.

ALL-NIGHT WORK SESSIONS, coﬂ‘ee breaks, and singing
to awaken drooping spirits are all a part of Homecoming, but
are not evident to the spectators in the stands who see only the
ﬁnished product of the Greeks’ work.

THE QUEEN’S FLOAT containing some of
Pitt’s loveliest co-eds added a touch of beauty to
the otherwise grey and gloomy Homecoming
game.

piﬂ players

Three major productions show Players’:

Adapting their schedule to the trimester program, Pitt . -
Players, under the direction of Michael McHale, presented a
major production in each of the school terms.

In the fall, Players did “My Three Angels" with Herb .
Margolis, Jack Kauffman and Tom Hall in the title roles.
During the winter term, “Pajama Game” was presented, with '
Gil Lazier as the male lead, and Kyp Parker and Rosalie
Stewart sharing the female lead. “The Telephone" was the
ﬁrst of a series of short plays presented during the summer
trimester and featured Kyp Parker and Gil Lazier.

Along with these major productions, Players combined
with the Antiqua Players to present “The Play of Robin and '

sible for bringing the French Theatre du Passe Temps to the
university, and worked behind the scenes for the Arnold Moss
production of “The Tempest.”

Shoestring Productions, a subsidiary of Players, was begun
this year as an experimental group that enabled students in- '
terested in the theater to gain experience by working on small 
productions. Directed by Al Wagner, technical director of
Players, this low-budget enterprise staged “Teach Me How

 

Marian," a medieval musical drama. They were also respon- »

MAKE-UP, clothing, sets, lighting, and the myriad other back-
stage activities that go into a Players’ production are given close,
accurate attention, helping to further the illusion of real life.

“THREE ANGELS,” Tom Hall, Jack Kauffman, and
Herb Margolis, sparked the first show of the year with their
wry humor. From the moment they descended onto the
stage they took over the situation——and the audience.

greek week

CHOSEN on a combination of beauty and talent
Shirley Roth of Alpha Epsilon Phi, was crowned
Queen of Greek Week by last year’s queen,
Marian Wood.

When Pitt’s traditional Spring Carnival fell a victim of the
new trimester plan and was abolished by the Student Govern-
ment Association, the fraternities and sororities were deter-
mined to make up for it by turning their Greek Week held
in February, already one of the best in the country, into an
even gayer and more elaborate affair than ever before.

With beautiful little Shirley Roth of Alpha Epsilon Phi as
Queen reigning over the week's events, and the buffoonery
of Sigma Chi’s Chuck Reinhold as the Court Jester, the
Greeks turned out a ﬁne week of fun, competition, and high
spirits.

A giant chess game, with a mixture of Greeks and non-
Greeks acting as the chessmen, was played on the black and
white marble squares in the Student Union Lounge and ended
in a hard-fought draw. All-stars from Pitt’s IFC basketball
league played the Carnegie Tech Greek All-stars. Pitt lost
the game, but only by one point. Exchange dinners were held
on Thursday night, with the fraternities playing host to soror-
ity girls and members of the faculty and administration.

The Greek Week Sing, always a high-point in the week,
was exceptionally good and competition was close all the way.
The Luncheon brought 600 of Pitt’s Greeks to the Student
Union on Saturday, and Fun Day afterwards featured the
annual “Keep Talking” contest and the Greek Auction of
services. The Greek Week Ball that night capped off theweek
in fine style with the music of the Glenn Miller Band and the
presentation of the Sing awards.

KAPPA ALPHA THETA wrapped up the ﬁrst place award for sororities at Greek Week Sing with “The

Lady in Red.”

ALL-GREEK LUNCHEON brought over 600 Greeks together on Satur-
day. Dr. Haywood Kenniston, an Andrew Mellon Professor at Pitt, spoke
on “The Greek’s Place in the Community.”

THE TROPHY for second place was accepted by
Caroline Dunbar for her sorority, Delta Delta
Delta, and their rendition of “The Red, Red
Robin.” Second place song for the fraternities
went to Pi Kappa Alpha and “The Navy Blue
and Gold.”

A SCOTTISH BALLAD,
“Green Grow the Rushes 0,”
won a ﬁrst place award for the
Sigma Chi Fraternity.

greek week

EXCHANGE DINNERS between fraternities and sororities on Thursday night brought together
Greeks and faculty in a friendly, informal atmosphere demonstrating fraternal living at its best.

“SCARLET RIBBONS” won a third award for the girls of Alpha Delta Pi sorority. The third
place for fraternities went to the Alpha Phi Alpha’s for their rendition of “Cordelia Brown.”

THE THETA VICTORY CHANT rang throughout the Student Union Ballroom as the joyous girls of Kappa Alpha
Theta received their ﬁrst place Sing trophy.

FAST-TALKING Judy Brauman and her part-

ner Chuck Herring kept up a steady stream of

wit and wisecracks to overwhelm all other op-

ponents and win in the Greeks’ “Keep Talking"
. Contest.

THE GREEK WEEK BALL was the climax of the week’s activities and
rounded out the celebration with music by the Ray McKinley-Glenn Miller
Band, dancing, and the presentation of awards for Greek competition.

This year, as every year, the Editors and
Staff of the Owl have searched the Uni-
versity for the women who can be said to
best represent beauty at Pitt. The original
candidates were eliminated one by one
through a long process of comparison,
argument, and test photographing until
only the ﬁve Owlettes were left. From these
beauties Miss Owlette was chosen. Miss
Owlette and her court represent the type
of women the University strives to pro-
duce—beautiful, intelligent, well-rounded.
These are the girls you see in class, at
football games, Student Union dances, and
in the Tuck Shop. They may be soph-
omores or seniors, education or English
majors;some may have been Queens be-
fore, or will be Queens in the future; but
no matter what they are, or who they
are——they are most of all, beautiful.

Guests provide opportunities for

The world outside the university is brought to the Pitt stu-
dent through various mediums, but the most effective way is
often through the visits and talks of the many University
guests. Whether it is an expert lecturing in his particular
ﬁeld, a politician seeking support, or a group of Latin Ameri-
can students observing college life in the United States, Pitt
undergraduates are introduced to new and stimulating people
almost daily.
The popular Midday Series presented a variety of programs ‘
 ranging from the light humor of Bennet Cerf, author and
publisher, to the serious challenge presented by Arthur
Schlesinger ]r., noted historian. Occasionally, a guest’s busy
schedule only allowed him time for a formal talk at noon, but
nevertheless, the opportunity to hear and see John Kennedy
or V. Khrishna Menon even for a short while, proved informa-
tive and valuable. More often, the students were given the .
chance to meet guests like poet Alastair Reid, Lyman Kirk-
patrick, Inspector General of the C.I.A., and Editor Martin ‘
Shelby Ochs of the Chattanooga Times at informal luncheons -
and coﬂ"ee hours to exchange views and ideas. At other times,
impressions and insights were received through the artistic
forms of music and the dance at the programs of the Nether-
lands String Quartet and Jean Erdman, creative dancer.

In addition to the personalities introduced by the Midday
Series, many guests, less well-known but just as interesting,
visited the campus, among them the leaders of the sit-in
strikes in the South.

All of these guests, and others who came and spoke, pro-
vided Pitt students with the opportunity to listen, to question,
to learn. "

election issues to the student body.

AUTHOR of ODDMENTS, INKLINGS, OMENS,
MOMENTS, Alastair Reid was one of the many literary
ﬁgures to visit the University under the sponsorship of
the Midday Series.

STUDENT questions from the ﬂoor after the talk are illuminating to all. The audience learns
something about the speaker from the answer, but at the same time the speaker has learned some-
thing about the audience from the question.

 

owl hall of fame

The OWL Hall of Fame is comprised of twenty—four outstand-
ing senior men and women who have been chosen to represent
their class. They are picked by the Hall of Fame Committee,
composed each year of six junior men, six junior women, and
representatives of the Dean of Students’ Staﬂ’. Through the
many diversiﬁed activities and interests of the members of
the 1960 Hall of Fame, the OWL hopes that a fair sampling
of the important men and women in the senior class has been
obtained. These people who have been chosen for this honor
are the recognized leaders and workers in their clubs, groups,
and committees; these are the men and women who support
SG, work for the PITT NEWS, or are Homecoming Chair-
men. They are the students who sit next to you in class; they
are the ones you see in the Union, at football games, at meet-
ings; these are the students who have taken a more than ac-
tive interest in extra-curricular functions, and in the Univer-
sity as a whole.

mr. and miss piH

Every senior class has its leaders, its activities men, its scholars.
The Class of 1960 has many such people, all of whom have con-
tributed much to their class and University. Each year the OWL
singles out two outstanding seniors to represent the best of the
class, the best of the school. These are two people who have been
active in many groups and organizations, quite often oﬂicers in
several, while maintaining high scholarship. Their work has al-
ways been unselﬁsh and they continually fulﬁll more than just
their responsibilities. These two seniors, representative of the
type of student the University is striving to produce, are awarded
with the titles of Mr. and Miss Pitt. For 1960, the OWL has
chosen William Blankenstein and Ann Pongratz.

Miss Pongratz is in the School of Education majoring in Eng-
lish and Business. She has held the presidency of both Associ-
ated Women Students and Cwens. She was a Junior Worthy,
and has been tapped into Mortar Board and Delta Delta Lamb-
da, Business Education Honorary. She is also a member of Chi
Omega social sorority.

Mr. Blankenstein, who is an Electrical Engineering student,
was the 1959 EMITT awardee, a Druid and a member of
Omicron Delta Kappa. He has served as president of his fra-
ternity, Delta Sigma Phi, and president of Interfraternity
Council. He has been a class oﬂicer and worked for the Sky-
scraper Engineer. He was also president of Eta Kappa Nu and a
member of Sigma Tau, both engineering honoraries.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE of Panhel sets the policies followed by all Pitt
social sororities. This year’s committee was composed of Carol Nathan, Toni
Guerrieri, Judy Batcheldor, Mary Seros, Janet Leavers, and Tania Iwanowski.

The Panhellenic Council is the governing
body of the sixteen social sororities on Pitt’s
campus. In the Council each of the sorori-
ties is represented by two members.

Besides operating as the governing and
policy making body for Pitt sororities, the
Council also strives to promote good schol-
arship, good citizenship, and cooperation
among the women of the University.

Among its projects for this year were the
Panhellenic Sing for freshmen and transfer
women, the open houses held in the sorority
apartments, and a Fashion Show.

The Council’s big social event of the year
was the Panhellenic Ball which was held in
February at the Hilton Hotel.

Panhellenic Council also co-sponsored the
Greek Week activities with Interfraternity
Council.

Alpha Delta Pi

Alpha Delta Pi Sorority is the oldest
'Greek-letter organization for women. It
'was founded on May 15, 1851, at Wes-
_leyan Female College in Macon, Georgia.

During the past year Alpha Delta Pi
has been very active on Pitt’s campus.
They participated in Homecoming and
VGreek Week activities and held tea
«dances with other Greek organizations.

Alpha Epsilon Phi, national social sorority, aims
to foster friendship in group life, to stress high
scholarship among its members, and to serve the
University and the community. In reaching these
aims, the sorority adopted a French orphan whom
it has been supporting for three years, and the
national foundation recently established fellow-
ships in the ﬁeld of social work. Most AEPhi’s are
active in various Pitt organizations. This year Lois
Capin served as vice president of SGA, and Gerry
Sack and Gloria Levinson were in Mortar Board.
The AEPhi’s were also active in Greek activities.
They took ﬁrst place in the 1959 Spring Carnival
Shows along with Delta Sigma Phi fraternity, and
this year the Pitt chapter again won the AEPhi
national scholarship award. Their social activities
included a dance celebrating their fiftieth anniver-
sary, a spring formal, tea dances, and parties with
the Tech chapter.

A SCRAPBOOK can help a sister to review her four years of
sorority life. It can also indicate to the new pledges what their
sorority has done in the past.

Delta Zeta, social sorority, endeavors to pro-
mote high scholarship and ﬁrm, lasting

party, a spring formal and mixers and pa-
jama parties in their new suite.

Delta Zeta girls were also active in other
campus activities. Theresa Bozzo was chair-
man of the senior women’s class. Marjorie
Adams and Carole Pettenato were members
of Mortar Board. Jane Popovich, Helen
Tasevich, and Theresa Bozzo served as sen-
ior mentors.

Delta Sigma Phi

Delta Sigma Phi, international social fraternity,
was founded at the College of the City of New
York in 1899, and in December they celebrated
their sixtieth anniversary. A young and rapidly
growing fraternity, the Delta Sigs have risen until
they are now in the top quarter of all national so-
cial fraternities. Through their progressive ideals
and standards and copyrighted plan for “Engi-
neered Leadership,” the Delta Sigs at Pitt have such
campus leaders as Bill Blankenstein, ODK, pres-
ident of IFC, and EMITT Awardee; Ron Scott,
Pi Delta Epsilon and Editor of the OWL; Hank
Bonstedt, Associate Editor of the OWL; Phil
Williams, treasurer of SGA; and Bill Mauro, co-
captain of the varsity basketball team.

A complete social program, including parties,
formals, and a spring weekend, did not stop the
Delta Sigs from being tough competition in Inter-
fraternity sports, winning first place for their 1959
Carnival show, or building a second place Home-
coming ﬂoat.

“To develop a high standard of intellec-
tual achievement in a closely knit group,”
the Gamma Sigma chapter of Delta Tau
Delta was established on the Pitt campus
in 1914.. Since that time the Delts have
been one of the more active Pitt fraterni-
ties. They play an active part in Home-
coming and Greek Week in addition to
holding jazz concerts after all football
games. A winter weekend was held at
Hidden Valley and a spring weekend at
Conneaut. The Delts also held their
annual Baseball Day.

Projects for the year included regular
panel discussions with alumni in Various
areas of the business world and a Christ-
mas Party at the local orphanage.

A few of the outstanding Delts were
William Peckman, head drum major of
the Varsity Marching Band, and James
Groninger, a junior delegate to National
Interfraternity Council.

THE HOUSE is the center of most fra-
ternity activity. Here the brothers gather
for meetings, parties, and companionship.

» Lambda Chi Alpha

>Lambda Chi Alpha was founded in 1909,
and was organized at Pitt in 1919. Moral-
ity, fellowship, scholarship, and justice
are the aims of the Pitt chapter. All the
members observe such requirements as

in good scholarship, participation in other

- activities, willingness to build up mem-
bership and spirit, and working for the
beneﬁt of all the brothers.

Besides holding joint social affairs with
other fraternities and sororities, Lambda

4 Chi Alpha held a Founder's Day Dinner-

» Dance and the annual White Rose formal.
Their projects for the year included a
Christmas party for orphans and foster
children, and the publishing of a news-
letter, “The Gamma-Phone.”

Outstanding members of Lambda Chi

- Alpha include Joseph Bardzil, head foot-
ball manager; and Fred Cox, James Cun-
ningham, and Robert Clemens, members
of the varsity football team.

Gamma Sigma chapter of Pi Lambda Phi frater-
nity has been on Pitt’s campus since 1914.. The
fraternity was founded in 1895, at Yale University
as a non—sectarian fraternity. It has remained so
to the present.

To foster leadership in its members, the frater-
nity encourages the brothers to participate in
school activities outside the fraternity. This
leadership is shown in the number of Pi Lambs
active on campus, such as Richard Zionts, ODK;
Howard Kronenberg and Sam Stahl, Druids;
Paul Schwartz, editor of Ideas and Figures; Harry
Palkovitz, Ronald Perrin, and Paul Schultz, mem-
bers of Alpha Epsilon Delta, the honorary pre-
medical fraternity.

In addition to individual activities, the Pi
Lambs sponsor many group social events includ-
ing a summer formal held at Bedford Springs and
a winter weekend at Seven Springs.

MORTAR BOARD

Mortar Board is a national honorary so-
ciety for outstanding senior women. Fu-
ture members are tapped in the spring of
their junior year on the basis of leader-
ship and service to the University.

Rather than carry on a program of
projects and social activities, this year
Mortar Board concentrated on providing
valuable group experiences for its mem-
bers in its bi-monthly meetings. These
meetings included discussions of modern
art and the suppression of the individual
in modern society, a dinner meeting with
Dr. and Mrs. Litchﬁeld, and a discussion
of Various members’ experiences while in
Europe. The meetings provided a place
for intellectual stimulation and individual
expression of the members.

The purpose of Mortar Board is to rec-
ognize and honor scholarship and leader-
ship in University women.

GROUP HARMONY is an important part of Mortar Board just as it is with
all other eﬂﬁcient, top-ﬂight organizations on campus.

Omicron Delta Kappa

Omicron Delta Kappa, national honorary society,
seeks to reward outstanding leadership within the
University at both student and faculty adminis-
tration levels. The Gamma Circle of ODK was
founded on the Pitt campus in 1916. Since then,
this society has brought recognition to both junior
and senior men who are in the upper third of their
class and who have made substantial contributions
to the University. They also have brought recog-
nition to outstanding members of the faculty and
administration who have demonstrated leadership
and interest in scholarship, athletics, student gov-
ernment, religious aifairs, publications, and foren-
sics. Each spring and fall ODK taps new members.
At the annual spring Tap Day, the fraternity also
selects the outstanding senior man for their “Man
of the Year” award. ODK members meet at bi-
weekly luncheons which feature guest speakers
from the University and from the community.

I61

MEMBERS OF ODK are tapped from all areas of student ac-
tivity to be recognized for their good work. Leaders such as John
Strauch, WPDU, and Murray Chass, PITT NEWS Editor, rep-
resent the type of men Omicron Delta Kappa seeks to honor.

Pi Delta Epsilon’s mission is in the undergraduate collegiate
journalism ﬁeld. It is the oldest national honorary journalism
fraternity in the country. The fraternity acts as the link be-
tween the various campus publications, and through construc-
tive criticism and co-operation between publications, it strives
to better them.

Students exemplifying outstanding achievement in the
publications ﬁeld, with a QPA of 2.5 or above, and with mem-
bership on a publication stall for a year and a half are quali-
ﬁed for membership in Pi Delta Epsilon.

house for the students; a parents’ night for publication staff
members; a brochure presenting life on the publications at the
University; and a- small library including books from all
phases of the journalism profession.

PUBLICATIONS of all sort draw the interest of Pi Delt members.
A new idea or technique in journalism can often be adapted to
good advantage in another paper, magazine, or yearbook.

LAMBDA KAPPA SIGMA

PHI ETA SIGMA

Phi Eta Sigma, freshman scholastic hon-
orary, taps men who have maintained at
least a 3.5 QPA during their first two
terms at the University. Phi Eta Sigma
strives to promote scholastic achieve-
ment among its members and to assist all
freshmen in their academic studies.

The fraternity provides a free tutoring
service to students at Pitt who are en-
rolled in freshman courses. Weekly classes
are conducted by an upperclassman who
tutors in his major subject. The Uni-
versity awarded special recognition to
Phi Eta Sigma this year for its work in
sponsoring this service.

The organization also sponsored stu-
dent-faculty discussion groups throughout
the year. Luncheons and dinners, featur-
ing guest speakers, combined social and
intellectual activity for the members of
Phi Eta Sigma.

Lambda Kappa Sigma, professional phar— 
macy sorority, was organized at the Mas-
sachusetts College of Pharmacy in Bos-
ton, in 1913. The Delta chapter was»
formed at the University of Pittsburgh
School of Pharmacy in 1918. A woman is
selected to membership on the basis of .1
character, scholarship, ability, and per-
sonality. A quality point average of 2.0
must be obtained by freshmen and are
average of 2.5 must be maintained by
upperclass members.

Lambda Kappa Sigma aims to develop »
the pharmaceutical interests of all women
students. This aim is accomplished by
working with the faculty and fellow class-- -
mates on social and academic programs.

Members of Lambda Kappa Sigma par-
ticipated in Greek activities, National
Pharmacy Week, and freshmen orienta-
tion programs. An alumni chapter of
Lambda Kappa Sigma was reorganized
in Pittsburgh during the year and proved,
to be a great help to the student organi-
zation.

Scabbard and Blade

Scabbard and Blade is an honorary fraternity for
advanced Army ROTC cadets. Company D, 7th
Regiment was established on the Pitt campus in
1929. Membership is based upon academic stand-
ing and leadership qualities. Its aims are to spread
intelligent information concerning the military re-
quirements of the United States, to take an active
part in the military affairs of the community, and
to develop and preserve those qualities essential
for good and eﬂicient oﬂicers. Their projects in-
clude a summer camp orientation weekend and the
Military Ball, held in co-operation with the other
military units of the University. The Saber Trick
Drill Team, under the auspices of Scabbard and
Blade, performs at important military functions.

Sigma Tau

Sigma Tau keeps up to date with new articles of interest by
subscribing to the PYRAMID, a national quarterly publica-
tion. Their activities included the presentation of awards to ‘
outstanding freshmen, a dance held in November, a stag
party, and trips to plants in the Pittsburgh area.

One of the members, Ronald Jessup, was recently awarded

Of all the organizations at Pitt, the most
secret, the most congenial, and the best
fed is a little known but highly honored
group called Gourmets Anonymous. Com-
prised of members of the faculty, adminis-
tration, and studentry, its roster is a
closely guarded secret.

To be eligible for membership, an indi-
vidual must exhibit not only an apprecia-
tion of ﬁne food and drink, but a genuine
interest in their preparation, and the
proper climate for their maximum enjoy-
ment. Initiates are notified by unsigned
letter, and have no idea as to the identity
of their brothers until the formal initia-
tion.

At this ceremony, marked by a dinner
prepared completely by the brothers, the
Head Chef reveals to the new members
the creed of the organization:

“The advantage that men have over
angels is the joy of eating and drinking;
that the simplest gifts of the earth, simply
prepared, give the greatest happiness to
men, that these riches are necessarily best
enjoyed in the company of kindred minds
and palates, and that the freedom of se-
cret participation should be guaranteed
to all Chairs of the fraternity.”

From the founding of the ﬁrst Table of
the organization in Pittsburgh in 1957,
the group has expanded its scope and
now claims Tables in Honolulu, New
York, and Boston.

Air Force ROTC

The Air Force Reserve Oﬂicer Training Corps is
much more than the glamor of blue uniforms and
the precision of close order drill. AFROTC actually
means hard work and study, for the cadets must
master complicated courses in air navigation, mili—
tary aviation, air base functions, global geography
—all of which are needed to prepare the cadet for
the role he may play in America’s growing air
power.

On the drill ﬁeld the cadet learns how to take
and give orders, and after passing his physical and
AFOQT, he begins acquiring the conﬁdence and
self—reliance essential to his role as an Air Force
ofﬁcer.

Socially, the cadets co—sponsor the Military Ball
and hold a Parents’ Night program; for an ofﬁcer

versity level, but still under the control
of the Department of the Army. The
present curriculum, which is designed for
overall military service, is not pointed to
any particular type or branch of the army.
Army ROTC is primarily interested in
the development of qualities of leader-
ship and initiative so necessary in a time
of emergency. Practical ﬁeld training is
accomplished in a six-week summer camp
integrated into the program between the
junior and senior years.

Pershing Riﬂes and Scabbard and

A.S.C.E.

The American Society of Civil Engineers is the professional
organization for civil engineering students at the University
of Pittsburgh. The purpose of the organization is to better
prepare the engineers for their entry into the profession by
familiarizing them with some of the outstanding men in the
profession.

Recent honors awarded to ASCE were: the Engineering
School All-Sports Trophy for 1958-59, the outstanding semi-
nar award, and the Shamrock Award for active participation
and accomplishments during the 1959 Engineers’ Week.

The Society holds a departmental dinner each semester as
well as numerous parties. This year the group began a student
publication for the civil engineering department entitled,
“The Surveyor.”

DISPLAYS in the trophy case in Engineering Hall are
increased every year, due in part to wins scored by the
members of the American Society of Civil Engineers over
the other engineers.

Associated Women Students

Associated Women Students is the women’s
self-governing body which co-ordinates all
women's activities in the University. Its
members include all full-time undergradu-
ate women, who are automatically eligible
to participate in any activity sponsored by
the organization.

Organized in 1912, under the name of
Women’s Activities.‘ Association and changed
in 1920, to Women’s Self—Governing Asso-
ciation, the group became Associated Women
Students in 1957.

Each year AWS sponsors the Lantern
Night program for freshman women and a
Transfer Tea. Its Scholastic Honors Com-
mittee also presents a series of book reviews
and provides a tutoring service.

This year AVVS was in charge of the Fresh-
man Assembly and orientation program
under the direction of its Traditions Com-
mittee and the Activities Fair sponsored by
the Activities Committee.

ORGANIZING freshman orientation programs was the main project of the AWS execu-
"tive committee during the ﬁrst trimester. The details of Lantern Night and the freshman

assembly had to be carefully worked out to insure successful programs.

Block P

Block P, the student ﬂashcard section, was or— .-
ganized in 1954, under the Department of Ath-
letics. It was transferred this year to the Dean of
Students. Block P has risen in ﬁve years from a
small group of students performing very simple
stunts to a large section which performs moving
stunts in eight colors. It is now one of the top -
ﬂashcard sections in the country.

Block P performs at every home football game
and complements well the performance of the Uni-
versity Marching band. In addition to providing a
colorful half—time performance, Block P leaders 7
help lead cheers and generally keep spirits at a
high peak.

A party was held in the spring to congratulate
committee members and row leaders for a job well
done.

ROW LEADERS pass out the cards a few minutes before the half-time ceremony.
In addition to their duties as row leaders, they also organize cheers and maintain
school spirit.

ARTISTIC AND COLORFUL half-time performances were presented by the Block P section at every home football game under the
leadership of Howie Kronenberg; Midge Stanboro, Bob DiCicco, co-chairmen; and Marcia Wohlgemuth, secretary.

tion members and election by student groups
for student membership.
. The purpose of the group are to develop a
general policy statement to give direction
' to the total program of religion on the Pitt
campus, to prepare recommendations for a
program of religious fellowship and activi-
ties, and to submit recommendations for
L religion in the curriculum.
Activities of the Board this year included
F the development of a statement of policy
regarding religion on the University cam-
pus and planning for a curriculum in reli-
gion in the School of Liberal Arts.

Ideas and Figures

IDEAS AND FIGURES, located in the
newest oﬂice on the fourth floor of the
SU, is the latest addition to the Univer-
sity student publications. Filling a long
felt need for a literary magazine, IDEAS
has been publishing the best student work
available in the fields of the short story,
poetry, drama, essays, reviews, and art
work. Any student, undergraduate or
graduate, may submit original work to
the magazine’s editorial board for con-
sideration. Present plans call for the pub-
lication of three issues a year, one each
trimester.

Although IDEAS is the youngster in
the publications camp, it has already
gained many followers and hangers-on
who gather daily in the ofhce to sit on
the floor or desktops, and between dis-
cussing everything from Fanny Hurst to
Ferlinghetti, they even manage to get
their magazine out on time.

Men’s Council

 

AN INTRAMURAL FOOTBALL TROPHY was awarded this year by Men’s
Council. Other activities of the council included the selling of the official Pitt
blazer and the sponsoring of the Christmas Ball.

The Men’s Council consists of a ﬁve man
executive board elected by the male students
of the University. It was changed from a
thirty—man General Assembly to its present
size in 1958, to mold it into an eﬁicient and
responsible agent of the male students. It
is the job of Men’s Council to organize and
control the various men's activities.

Activities sponsored by Men’s Council
this year were a Transfer Student Luncheon,
the Christmas Ball, an All—Campus Intra-
mural Sports Banquet, and an All—Campus
Queen Contest. The Council played a major
part in freshman programs by handling
Men’s Conferences and by active work for
Freshmen Orientation Week.

Council, this year, took over the sale of
the oﬂicial Pitt blazer. They also initiated
awarding All—Campus sport trophies at the

The Men’s Glee Club is one of the oldest extra-
curricular activities on the University of Pitts-
burgh Campus. This year the group celebrated its
seventieth anniversary.

Besides being one of the oldest groups on cam-
pus, the Glee Club is one of the most active. In
addition to participating in many University ac-
tivities and presenting a Christmas Concert with
Women’s Choral, they performed throughout the
city of Pittsburgh for many civic organizations.
They also presented programs for high schools in
the area.

Believing that singing together creates a strong
bond of friendship, the Glee Club creates a willing-
ness in its members to constantly strive for per-
fection.

The programs of the Men’s Glee Club demon-
strate their versatility as they present classical
compositions, folk songs, and novelties with the
same enthusiasm and quality.

Owl

In the never ending attempt to keep abreast of the
best in college journalism, the 1960 OVVL changed
its format somewhat from its previous form.
Feeling that the story of the year at Pitt could be
told better in a new way, the editors have relaxed
a little, publishing a lighter, more impressionistic
book. The attempt was to capture the feeling and
spirit of the year at Pitt rather than the strict
factual record.

The OWL also covered all three of the trimes-
ters in Pitt's new educational plan, publishing in
the month of August for the ﬁrst time. With the
move to the fourth ﬂoor of the Student Union by
all student publications, the OVVL at last acquired
the extra oﬂice space it long needed. This year the
staff did their best to turn out a book equal to last
year's OWL which took a Medalist Award at C0-
lumbia University and a First Place from the As-

Foto Club

The menagerie of people pictured to the left
are a random sampling of the carefree and
fun-loving Pitt Foto Club. A few of the mem-
bers (about half) could not be present for the
club photo because four were drunk and three
were needed to take the picture. The club is
composed of anybody in the University who
knows his way around the business end of a
Brownie (slightly) and has ﬁve bucks a year
for dues. For this laughably low price the
members are entitled to all rights and privi-
leges of the club which includes hanging
“art” photos on the walls (that’s what they
call them, the law would call them some-
thing else).

Most of the stalwarts who people this hap-
py group are also publications staff photogs,
but seldom can be found by a harrassed edi-
tor when he needs them. This year when they
managed not to be busy working for publica-
tions (which was most of the time) the Foto
Club squeezed in some social life (57 parties,
at which they got drunk, and one sock hop,
at which they got drunk).

The PITT CAPSULE, organized in 1946, is the
University of Pittsburgh’s Pharmacy School pub-
lication. Beginning as a mimeographed news-
paper, it has since grown into a magazine pub-
lished four times yearly, containing excellent black
and white photographic reproductions in addition
to interesting articles on the latest advancements
in the ﬁeld of pharmacy.

The CAPSULE not only keeps the undergrad-
uate students informed of the latest advance-
ments and achievements in their ﬁeld, but it also
reaches a high percentage of alumni as well.

In order to become a member of the PITT
CAPSULE staﬂ“, a person must be in Pharmacy
School and have a special interest in this particular
type of publication. He does not have to have
journalistic experience, but he must want to study,
write, and learn more about pharmacy, and in so
doing, encourage enthusiasm for his chosen pro-
fession among the pharmacy student body.

THE PITT NEWS began publication ﬁfty—four years ago. It
originated as a weekly, but now the newspaper is published
twice a week. This year the PITT NEWS instituted a contro-
versial editorial policy that led to an increased response on
the part of students and faculty members in the form of letter
writing. Since the aim of the NEWS is to provide an outlet
for student opinion and journalistic abilities as well as a com-
prehensive coverage of the happenings on campus, the organi-
zation eflectively fulﬁlled its purpose.

This year the paper received a ﬁrst class honor rating from
the Allied Collegiate Press. In addition, members of the staff
received seven awards for individual stories in the Pi Delta
Epsilon national newspaper contest. This number was the
highest of any school competing in the contest.

INTERVIEWS with the people who knew the facts or
made the news was the basis for the pointed editorials in
the PITT NEWS this year. Editor Murray Chass eventual-
ly wrote on everything from student apathy to the parking
problem.

Skyscraper Engineer

During the past year the SKYSCRAPER EN-
GINEER has presented the engineering student a
variety of technical articles dealing with all phases
of the engineering profession. Articles strictly in
the technical vein are not the only material pre-
sented in the magazine. During the past year arti-
cles have been featured dealing with campus ac-

During the nine years of its existence the SKY-
SCRAPER has won many awards. This year at a
convention held by Pi Delta Epsilon, the national
honorary journalism fraternity, the magazine was
awarded “Best Magazine in the Country” in com-

The magazine works closely with the engineer-

they promote many of the engineering activities
including the Engineering and Mines International
Travel and Training Award and Engineers’ Week.

Student Government Association

i’ The Student Government Association
this year formulated a new constitution
which changed the system of election of

' representatives to the body. All repre-

the student body rather than represent-

One of SGA’s many activities this year
was the planning of a Freshman Day at
'° Pitt’s Wildwood Club to introduce fresh-
.» men to life at Pitt. This was an all day
picnic which included entertainment,

‘games, and group singing.

Since the trimester system made the
continuation of Spring Carnival in its

5 necessary to discontinue the activity.

They also organized the sale and distri-

and worked on a new school handbook
for entering freshmen and transfer stu-

' dents.

    

CAMPUS PROBLEMS are brought up for discussion at the weekly meetings
of SGA. Although the solutions are not always clear, SGA endeavors to present
both sides to the student body in the hope that effective and constructive action

The William Pitt Debate Union is one of the
most active organizations on campus.
Through its extensive program, the Union
aims at training its forty-ﬁve members in
analysis, argument, and public address and
to motivate them to inquire into controver-
sial issues. Its members made twenty—ﬁve
major trips to other campuses including Ja-
maica and Canada. They performed before
ninety high school audiences in the Pitts-
burgh area, in New York, and in Kansas. In
addition, they were hosts at three major
tournaments at the University: the Annual
Cross—Exam in December which brought
teams from across the nation and abroad,
the Novice Tournament in March, and the
Summer Tournament in July. They brought
debators from Cambridge University to per-
form in a Mid—Day Series program. The
Union also produced its own weekly televi-
sion show, “Face the People,” over VVQED.

 

FACE THE PEOPLE, produced by the members of WPDU, is
seen weekly over WQED-TV. Prominent people from the com-
munity and the nation such as L. Brent Bozzel, Washington
Director of the Freedom for All Peoples Committee, are quizzed

Psi Omega, national dental fra-

memberships of any dental asso-
ciation in the country. It is sec-
ond only to the American Dental
Association. Founded nationally
in 1892, at the Baltimore College
of Dental Surgery, the Pitt chap-
ter was organized in 1923.

Psi Omega endeavors to pro-
vide social activities for Pitt den-
tal students by holding bimonth-
ly date parties and two annual
formal dances. In addition, it ex-
erts its inﬂuence to further the
advancement of the dental pro-
fession by securing benefits and
advantages through the group
that would be impossible to ob-
tain by individual students.

Throughout the year Psi Ome-

The Student Council of Religious Or-

1955, by a group of interested students
who represented four major faith groups -
and eleven religious organizations on the
Pitt campus. SCRO serves a very worth-
while purpose as the co-ordinating body
for all religious groups on campus. Mem-
bers of SCRO are elected by their indi-
vidual clubs and they represent the Prot-
estant, Roman Catholic, Jewish, and
Eastern Orthodox foundations.

Through its activities SCRO tries to
promote inter-religious instruction and
religious consciousness on the campus.
During the academic year of 1959-60, a
series of monthly meetings were held
based on the central theme, “Man's
Search for God.” Through these meetings
each major faith group interpreted their

The pre-season ballyhoo which usually accompanies Pitt into S  A

its opening game each year was conspicuous by its absence
this season. Perhaps this was caused by vivid memories of
the “invincible supermen” of the 1957 and 1958 teams, who
ultimately proved that even though they should have won on
paper, could not win on the ﬁeld. These past letdowns led to T
this year’s skeptical “show me” attitude on the part ofs orts
writers and fans who preferred to wait rather than be wiiong. Season Record

DEFEAT IN THE AFTERNOON, suffered at the hands of ﬁrst-ranked Syracuse and worsened by mud and cold,
came no easier to the players despite their role as underdogs.

,_MARQUETTE: Pitt’s initial game of a rough schedule was
a 21-15 win over the Warriors at Milwaukee. Despite the fact
that Pitt was a two touchdown favorite, Marquette proved

- to be anything but a push—over. The scoring see-sawed back
and forth during the second half, with the winning tally com-
ing on a Toncic to Ditka aerial late in the fourth quarter.
,U.S.C.: Traveling to the West Coast, the Panthers met the
Trojans under the lights at the Los Angeles Colosseum and

 suffered a 26-0 shutout. The Blue and Gold were unable to

~sustain any ground or aerial offensive against an impene-
trable Southern Cal defense which held them to an average
ground gain of only .87 yards per carry.

_U.C.L.A.: With six minutes to go in the game Pitt was be-
hind I5 points and another VVest Coast team had a win over

" the Panthers all but in the bag. However, Ivan Toncic, Pitt’s

-ace quarterback, was still to be reckoned with. He proved
equal to the situation by unleashing three touchdown strikes
to Cox, Ditka, and ]astrzembski—the winning TD coming
with only 31 seconds to go.

DUKE: Hopes for a 9-1 season record were uppermost in
* the minds of Pitt fans as the Panthers shutout the Blue Devils
~ 12-0. Scisly drove from the four in the ﬁrst quarter and Ditka

took a pass from Toncic on the ten early in the ﬁnal period

and went into the endzone to round out the scoring for Pitt.

,The stiff Panther defense held Duke in check for a net ground
gain of only 36 yards.

WEST VIRGINIA: With a 3-1 record behind them, Pitt

- traveled to Morgantown to meet their traditional rivals, the
Mountaineers. Slated to be a breather in Pitt’s suicide sched-
ule, West Virginia proved to be anything but, as they pulled
off one of the biggest collegiate upsets of the year, downing
Pitt 23-15.

A LAST-DITCH OFFENSIVE DRIVE by the Panthers slips
away in the mud as an Orange lineman pulls down Dave Kraus
in the closing minutes of a hard—fought game.

FRED COX breaks up a Horned Frog aerial intended for Justin Rowland, ending a late second
quarter Texas drive at the Pitt 43. Though Pitt came out on the short end of the score, the high
" point of the game was Norton Seaman’s 40 yard ﬁeld goal, tallying Pitt’s only score of the game.

RISING TO HIS FEET, the student shouts
his approval as the Panthers drive forward. De-
spite rain and cold the students continued to
pack the Stadium each football-Saturday, bely-
ing the rumored student apathy.

T.C.U.: Returning to their home ground, the Panthers
hosted the Horned Frogs of Texas. The Blue and Gold played

good ball and led in every game statistic but one, the score. ii

The Pitt team scored only once with a 4.0 yard field goal by
Norton Seaman and suffered their third defeat of the season

13-3. Chuck Reinhold was outstanding for Pitt, gaining 9o \

yards.
SYRACUSE: Homecoming spirits were dampened by the

drizzling rain and by the 35-0 drubbing at the hands of the ‘

ﬁrst ranked Orangemen. The Syracuse defense was, as in

other games, outstanding, holding the helpless Panthers to a __

minus six yards rushing and handing Johnny Micheloson
the worst defeat in his collegiate coaching career.

BOSTON COLLEGE: On a muddy gridiron in Boston, Pitt

successfully invaded the Ivy League with a 9.2-14. win that ‘

featured the powerful running attacks of the three C's, Fred
Cox, Jim Cunningham, and Bob Clemens. VVith Clemens
clearing the way, Cox drove for 16 points and Cunningham
added the ﬁnal 6 bringing the season record to .500.

NOTRE DAME: In the midst of a torrential downpour the

Fighting Irish found their spirits soddened by a well co-or— '

dinated Panther effort. For the second week in a row the
three C's constituted the spearhead of the Pitt attack. The
Panther defensive line was outstanding and had little trouble
containing Notre Dame 28-13.

PENN STATE: In the final game of the season, an inspired
Pitt team clashed with a bowl—bound State, and refusing to
bow to statistics and public opinion stunned the Nittany
Lions with the biggest upset of the year 22-8. With key blocks
by Cunningham, Vignalli, and Coustillac, Fred Cox sprinted
86 yards in the most exciting touchdown of the day.

THE OUTCLASSED BLUEDEVILS succeeded in stopping Fred Cox’s extra point attempt early in the second
quarter but were unable to stop the two drives that netted the Panthers twelve points—more than enough to win.

FRED RIDDLE bursts through the West Virginia line and breaks away for ﬁfteen yards to provide one of the few
bright spots in an otherwise mediocre game against the upset-minded Mountaineers. For the second year in a row
the “breathers” on the Pitt schedule turned out to be the rough ones.

' A SAFETY is scored by Pitt’s Chuck Reinhold as
he brings down Mounty halfback Ray Peterson

in the West Virginia end zone.

Booters again return

Coming back strong after a disappointing 1958 season, the
Panther booters compiled a 6-3-1 record. Coach Leo Bemis
used his ﬁfteen returning lettermen and a ﬁne crop of fresh-
men to form a strong defensive alignment, but lacked suFﬁ-
cient depth of offensive material. Attesting to this was the
fact that in three games the Panthers held their opponents
scoreless while out of the six wins four were won by the
narrow margin of one goal.

Inside-left Simeon Pestich and outside-left Don Jerich
were the team’s scoring punch as they combined to dent the
net ten times. Fancy-dribbling Ed Giraldo led in the assists
column with the four, and Jerich and Bob Murdoch con-
tributed two each.

Co-captains Ron Podmilsak and Ron Wyatt, and fast im-
proving Cal Smith did an excellent job on defense, cramping
the opposition’s style by blocking passes, and constantly
harassing their scoring efforts. Wyatt earned All-American
recognition for the second time with his outstanding playing
at right-fullback. George Zanicopoulos was brilliant in the
goal box, winning an All-American berth with his 118 saves.
When Podmilsak was injured in the Grove City game, Steve
Daniels was called upon and turned in a stylish performance
at the left-fullback position.

An undefeated junior varsity and 3-1 freshman team offer
bright prospects for next season. The frosh squad was also
strong defensively and should be able to fill the backﬁeld
spots of departing Wyatt, Podmilsak, and Tom Young.

Inexperience plagues Pitt runners

With the retirement of Pitt’s veteran cross country coach,
Carl Olson, the harriers this year came under the mentorship
of track coach Carl Rees. Despite all that Coach Rees could
do, the lack of experienced runners proved to be too much of
a handicap as the Pitt men posted a poor 3-5 season record.

Of the entire Panther thinclad squad only Ron Rush was
a consistent first place winner, coming in first in four out of
seven meets and never placing lower than fourth.

Starting off the season on the wrong foot, the Pitt runners
were nudged out by an underdog Slippery Rock team by only
three points. But: hopes for a successful season were still in
sight as the following Saturday the Panthers played host to
Ohio University and humbled the visitors by a good twenty-
five point margin. The Panthers’ hopes were shortlived, how-
ever, as the next two successive weekends found Pitt losing
to a strong Penn State team and dropping a close four—pointer
to West Virginia.

The Panthers managed to get back into the win column
against Fort Lee and then broke even in a triangular meet
with Navy and Georgetown, losing to the powerful Navy
runners and nosing out Georgetown by one point. New York
University was the last competitor on Pitt’s schedule, but
despite high hopes the Panthers again came out on the long
end of the score.

A bright spot on this year’s cross country scene was the
fine performance turned in by the freshman team, which
placed ﬁfth in the IC4A meet in New York. Harry Stokes,
the most promising freshman, placed a very respectable
seventh place in a ﬁeld of I31 runners.

PANTHER HARRIER, Joe Jelovich, leaves the woods
behind as he comes out of Schenley Park following the
cross country trail in a meet with Ohio University.

THE LONG HAUL up Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park is the beginning of all Pitt home meets. The runners from
Ft. Lee gave the Pitt men a good race and the ﬁnal score was a close 23-32, with the Panthers winning by a scant
nine points.

Grapplers tie with State for

This year proved to be another top season for the consistently
victorious Pitt grapplers. As one of the top collegiate teams
in the country, the Panther matmen faced formidable adver-
saries and compiled a 7-1-1 record for the season. In post-
season competition the Pitt wrestlers proved second to no one,
tieing for top berth in the Eastern Championships.

Throughout the season four Pitt matmen proved unbeat-
able to all their opponents. Dick Martin and Larry Lauchle
were acclaimed the “Mighty Mites” of intercollegiate wres-
tling, because of their superlative feats on the mat. John
Zollikov also wrestled his way to an unscathed record. In
the 130 pound division, Larry Lauchle not only remained
undefeated in collegiate competition, but also highlighted his
outstanding career by capturing the national crown for Pitt.

On consistent weekends, the matmen, under the mentor-
ship of Coach Rex Peery, easily rolled over Maryland, Syr-
acuse, and Navy; then Pitt fell heir to its only defeat of the
season at the hands of Michigan.

The grapplers bounced back against Army 17-11 and fol-
lowed through by blacking New York University 34-o. Mich-
igan State and Lehigh were then pinned under the Panther
onslaught. The last match of the season with the Lions of
Penn State ended in a 14-14. tie.

Finally, after the season, the Pennsylvania rivals met
again in the Easterns, battling to a second stalemate 66-66,
and tieing for the Eastern Championship.

COACH REX PEERY discusses the strategy for the ﬁnal period with
Larry Lauchle. Perry, a great wrestler in his own right, through his close,

personal relationship with his men has consistently turned out champion-
ship teams at Pitt. SCZISOII RCCOI d

Road losses cost Pitt hoopsters

SNATCHING THE REBOUND from the hands of a West
Virginia defender, Pitt’s John Fridley employs the over-
head pass to set up his driving teammate Bill Mauro.
Mauro scored a two-pointer.

With the graduation of All-American Don Hennon, local
basketball fans looked to a discouraging year for the Pitt

hoopsters. Even with this dismal outlook for the tough I959- .

60 season, the Panthers pulled through withlan 1 1-14 record,

surprising many of the doubtful experts, and because of the 7

remarkable record of home victories the fans dubbed this the
“win only at home” season.

Coach Bob Timmons’ hoopsters, led by co-captains Bill

Mauro and John Mills, shot their way to a strong victory‘

over Michigan in the ﬁrst game. After dropping two games,
Pitt ﬁred back by whipping St. Johns and Duquesne, thus
capturing the coveted Steel Bowl Tournament for the sec-
ond year in a row.

Christmas proved disappointing to the traveling Panthers,
but the hard—ﬁghting team retaliated by defeating VVilliam

and Mary. Pitt then proved its colors by defeating Westmin- ,

ster College with an overall shooting average of 60%.

Pitt continued to follow their “win only at home” season,
losing to Penn State at University Park and ultimately
defeating them at the Pitt Field House. Then, on the road
again, the Panthers lost their ﬁnal game to the powerful
Kentucky aggregate.

‘e to post good season

In only its sixth year on the varsity program, Pitt’s gymnas-
tic squad once again came up with a winning campaign as
Coach Warren Neiger’s Blue and Gold team was victorious
. in ﬁve of eight dual meets.

Victories were registered over such established powers as
Springﬁeld, VVest Virginia, Syracuse, Temple, and Georgia
Tech while defeats came at the hands of Army, the Eastern
champions, and also Navy and Penn State.

A gymnastic meet consists of the six standard events of
~ tumbling, side horse, high bar, rope climb, parallel bars, and
ﬂying rings.

For the second consecutive season Co-captain Dave Hirst,
a senior from Philadelphia, went through dual meet compe-
tition undefeated on the ﬂying rings, and at the same time
established three new Pitt records. His 288 score against
Navy on the rings broke All-American Torn Darling's previ—
ous high of 285 set in 1958, and his career total of 299 broke
the former Panther record held by Jim Mulvihill from 1956-
58, of 255% points. Hirst also broke his own season high of
111 by four points.

The Panthers’ other Co-captain, Don Kasner of McKees-
- port, also a senior, became the first gymnast in Pitt history

to win three events in an individual meet when he took the

side horse, high bar, and parallel bars against Tech.

Rounding out the 1960 squad were sophomore Earl Mc-
Connell, senior Tom Treese, and juniors Jack Rainaldi, Joe
Battaglia, Ron Daugherty and Howard Coley.

TAKING SPLITS on one of his swimmers, Coach
Ben Grady checks the gain or loss of time intently
eyeing his stopwatch.

Hampered by the loss of key men through graduation, and
the lack of competent sophomores to ﬁll the vacancies, the
Panther mermen were the victims of repeated defeats‘, post-
ing a ﬁnal season talley of 2-8.

Despite the relatively poor showing of the team, Jim Emert
and Bart Haas came through to supply the mermen with the
majority of its individual victories. Emert shattered the
school 50-yard freestyle event three times, ﬁnally trimming
ﬁve-tenths of a second from the standing record of 23.8.
Haas, the Ioo—yard freestyle champion, scored a total of ﬁve
wins in the 22o—yard freestyle; he was also a mainstay on the
freestyle relay team, and a consistent second place winner
in the Ioo-yard freestyle event.

. The most notable victory for the mermen was the 52-43
contest over Lehigh. Pitt nosed ahead late in the meet and
clinched the victory through their expert freestyle relay
team of Barry Kent, Bart Haas, Len Paganini, and Jim
Emert.

Syracuse was also caught in the wake of the Panther
tankers and sunk to a 63-32 defeat. Pitt gained the lead at
the onset and retained a wide, unﬁagging margin.

At the end of the season, Coach Ben Grady stated that the
“freshman squad is one of the strongest I have ever seen. I
am conﬁdent that they will ﬁll the gap in the present team.”

IN THE FINAL LENGTH, sophomore butterﬁyer Bob Koch eyes the ﬁnish line and takes
a last breath. Koch came in a close second to add three points to the team total.

Squash team holds its own 3-2,

SWINGING INTO ACTION, Paul Ribisl prepares to
meet his opponent on the new squash courts at the Pitt
Field House.

Completing the year with a 3-2 record, the Pitt squash team "

slashed their way to a 6-3 victory over Penn, 8-1 over Ford-
ham, and 7-2 over Dickenson. Pitt bowed only to the power-
ful military contingents of Army 9-0, and Navy 6-3.

Despite these two losses, the 1959-60 season proved to be
one of great improvement and advancement for the indoor

racqueteers. Coach Bill Summers had tuned his veteran stars, *

Dave Mason, Ralph Mason, Lauren Guthrie, and Paul
Knouse, for the year’s tough schedule.

Early in September the team suffered a very serious set- S"

back; Dave Mason, Pitt’s major hope for a national title,
broke his right hand and was temporarily benched. Pitt fans
saw the bandaged Dave return to ﬁnish the season left-
handed, racking up a very respectable personal record of
2-3 against his keen competitors.

Ralph Mason blasted through a 4-1 record for the racque-
teers. Lauren Guthrie and Paul Knouse also compounded
brilliant records of 4-1 to culminate the fine overall record
for the year.

Two outstanding freshmen appeared on the yearling squad;
the talented Junior National stars, Joe Brown Jr. and Dave
O’Laughlin, led the freshman squad to its victories for the
year. In addition to numerous titles in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict, Brown has won several state and national honors. With
the returning Ralph Mason and Lauren Guthrie, Coach Bill

Summers looks to next year’s aggregation as possibly the

strongest squash squad in the team's six year history.

track team

_The 1960 track team, though strong and consistent as ﬁrst
place winners, lacked the necessary depth to capture second
and third positions for meet victories. Throughout the season
this fact proved true, and in the larger meets, the Ohio and
'Penn Relays and the ICAAAA competition, the Panther
thinclads faired consistently better than in the dual meet op-
ﬁposition.
Team captain Ron Rush spurred on his teammates with
four wins in ﬁve outings in the one mile event, and three of
four ﬁrsts in the two mile race. Rush compiled the second

3 highest number of points for his team, led only by Pitt’s 220

and 440 star Mel Barnwell.

Pitt’s ﬁrst meet with Navy proved an unfortunate starter
ﬁfor the trackmen. They lost by one point, a heartbreaking
66-65. However, at their second meet with Miami, the Pitt
athletes scored an overwhelming victory, 78.47.

High point winners for the thinclads were Regis Goggin,
Ed Vamos, Danny Kanell, and Larry Och. In the Penn Relays
the sprint—medley team of Rush, Hinchberger, Barnwell, and

‘ Donahue placed ﬁrst for Pitt. In this same meet, the mile
relay team of Barnwell, Hinchberger, Kelly, and Clarke cap-
tured the coveted laurels. .

Coach Carl Rees summarized this year’s 2-3 record and

Hampered by injuries, weak hitting, and erratic pitching, the
[Panther nine concluded their ﬁrst summer trimester season
with a dismal 7-12 record.
Graduation cut deeply into the 1959 squad that had taken
a 14-4 record into the NCAA playoffs. Especially missed was
the big bat of All—American George Schoeppner, although his
replacement, Pete Suder, continued the Pitt tradition of
heavy-hitting shortstops. Son of the former major league in-
ﬁelder, sophomore Suder was one of few bright spots in
Coach Bobby Lewis's year. The only man on the team to bat
over .300, young Suder ﬁnished the year with a blazing .406
average, and ﬁnished second in the runs-batted-in department.
:.As a team, however, the Panthers batted only .236, as
many of the regulars failed to shake of? hitting slumps until
late in the season. Center fielder Nick Kartsonas, who was

~ depended upon to carry the brunt of the long ball hitting,

did not develop his batting eye until the last few games, and
although he led the Panthers in extra base hits, he batted
only .219.

Veteran second baseman and captain Pete Colangelo broke
his ankle early in the year and was lost for the season, while
hurler Bob Conti injured his arm in the middle of the cam~
paign and pitched only three games.

The rest of the pitching staff found it diﬁicult to ﬁnish a
game, as only six complete games were hurled, four by Dick
Wirth, who ﬁnished with a 3-3 slate, and the other two by
Ralph Shutterly, who was 2-4. for the year.

AN INJURED PLAYER, Pete Colangelo, is helped from the ﬁeld
by Coach Lewis and players. Breaking his ankle early in the season,
Pete was lost to the team for the rest of the year.

FOOLED BY THE PITCH, Mike Ditka ﬂails the air. Throughout the season
strong opposing pitchers kept the Jungle Cat batting averages for the most part
below .300.

is an excellent tribute to its ﬁne administration.

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld came to the University in ”

1955, bringing with him the valuable experience gained ‘

through his three successfully combined careers—education,
business, and public service. In the time that Dr. Litchﬁeld_
had been here, he has had to call heavily upon his backgroundr
in inaugurating a bold new program for Pitt.

The University Board of Trustees is composed of outstand— '

ing people from the ﬁelds of education, government, and
business. The diverse abilities of the members of the Board of
Trustees and the service each has been willing to give to the ‘

University has been instrumental in making Pitt a leading,

PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH is one of the
lesser publicized projects, but Pitt leads in this
ﬁeld also as new drugs are constantly prepared to
aid public health.

PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH and Civil Defense information was obtained
by a series of tests in which several Pitt students along with others volunteered to

‘The obvious sign of a university’s value is found in the caliber
of its students and faculty. Yet a university is measured also
by the less obvious. Research done in the quiet of a laboratory

_E or in the dusty shelves of the library can often bring recogni-
tion and acclaim. The achievements that mark our country’s

[srogress in the ﬁelds of science, medicine, and engineering are

‘the products of long and tedious hours spent on the campus
long after the rest of the university has ended its day. A vac-
cine or serum is the culmination of hundreds of successes and

failures in a wide variety of experiments completed by people
within the academic professions.

“ Research at Pitt, growing in importance with the Univer-
_sity as a whole, manifests itself in projects as varied as the
sciences themselves. Ranging from the search for drugs to use
in cancer treatment to the efficient management of an indus-

‘trial ﬁrm to the policy of the United States toward Red China,
the University strives to make itself not only a place oflearn—
ing but of discovery as well. Recognition of the role the Uni-
,versity of Pittsburgh is playing in all areas of research is
shown by the constant increase in endowments to the Univer-

‘sity by industry, government, and private concerns, who real-
ize that the world of tomorrow is being planned and sought
after within the University today.

PHYSICS RESEARCH at Pitt covers all areas from me-
chanical forces to nuclear energy. With the cyclotron, elec-

tron movement is studied for possible use.

CHEMICAL RESEARCH, still the most important single
type of research going on today, supplies more products
and materials than any other science.

liberal arfs

Revamps program as

The School of the Liberal Arts, oldest and largest division of
Pitt, is the backbone of the University. Striving to meet the
demands of the new trimester system, it has incorporated
advanced methods into its present curriculum. Perhaps the
most signiﬁcant new development was the increased use of
the formal lecture led by a prominent scholar and supple-
mented by the small “round table discussion” panel under '
the direction of an advanced graduate student. This combi-
nation of the large lecture and the small personal group
proved very effective and will be used to a greater extent in
the future.

There has also been an effort to distinguish between areas
of general study and areas of major concentration. The pur-
pose of the general education is to provide the student with
a breadth of cultural knowledge, while concentrating on spe-
ciﬁc areas of the major lends depth to the ﬁnal picture. New
instructors and new equipment will lend much to the pro-
gram’s success. All of these additions will aid in the gradual
improvement of the system.

“The objective of the School of the Liberal Arts,” as stated _«
by Dean A.  Martin, “is to provide the student not only
with the intellectual equipment for a career, but also with
the qualities that will enable him to be a competent citizen,
an interesting community member, and an attractive individ-
ual.”

A SHORT REST in the middle of a long reading assignment
gives a tired mind a chance to relax. Outside reading assignments
in the College Reserve Room supplement the text book and the
lecture in many liberal arts courses.

CREATIVITY is developed in the lib-
eral arts student in a class such as color
composition or ﬁction writing. The hu-
manities provide students with an ap-
preciation for truth and beauty which
may be overlooked in a technical ed-
ucation. _

trimester starts

SMALL SEMINARS serve to clarify the ideas presented in a large lecture section. This
combination of classes appeals to the liberal arts student for he gets a chance to present his
own ideas for analysis by the professor and his fellow students.

' a

TERM PAPERS seem to consume a major por-
tion of the liberal arts student’s time in any tri-
mester. The hours spent in planning, compiling
notecards, and writing the paper are familiar to
everyone.

THE CATHEDRAL LAWN often serves as an im-
promptu classroom on a hot day. A discussion of literature
or philosophy in such informal surroundings can often be
the most valuable class of the year.

illustration, discussion, and explanation by the
professor. A thorough knowledge of ﬁnances
will be necessary to the student when he enters
the business world.

As corporations grow more complex the need for businessmen
and women with both a liberal and a professional education
increases. The University of Pittsburgh’s School of Business
Administration helps meet this need by preparing men and
women who are competent in both areas. Each business ad-
ministration student is required to have completed two years
of study in the School of Liberal Arts where he obtains a
solid background in such subjects as literature, foreign lan-
guages and psychology. With this liberal arts background he
is ready to begin his professional education in the School of
Business Administration. His curriculum includes specialized
classes in industry, advertising, and insurance, visits to local
industries, lectures from management oﬂicials, and partici-
pation in business conferences.

The introduction of the trimester system has done a great

- deal to facilitate the acquiring of both a liberal and a pro-

fessional education for the business administration student.
Prior to the new system, students enrolled in this school were
not able to take any business courses until their junior year;
however, this year business courses were opened to sopho-
mores in addition to their liberal program. Under the tri-
mester program, students can ﬁnish their undergraduate
training in two and two thirds years. The School of Business
Administration hopes that this will encourage students to
continue for a master’s degree that will better prepare them
to cope effectively with the problems of an expanding busi-
ness world.

’ UPPERCLASSMEN in the school of business administration are often able to get practical ex-
perience within the university through jobs grading beginning accounting papers or by working
on the business staffs of many student organizations.

engineering and mines

Offers a liberal and technical education

In the mechanical world of today we must depend more and
more on engineering if our country is to continue to progress
and maintain a prominent position in the world. Industry
turns increasingly to the young engineers of today to contin-
ually turn out the newest and finest products of engineering
research. The University of Pittsburgh’s School of Engineer-
ing and Mines, located in the heart of America’s industrial
center, constantly strives to produce engineers of the best
quality possible. The use of the trimester system will play a
great role in reaching this goal. Not only will the school be

uate engineers who have obtained both a liberal and a tech-
nical education.

Pitt’s School of Engineering and Mines today strives to
turn out graduates who are able to represent their ﬁelds of
study in many ways—-in the research laboratory, in the
classroom, in the industrial world, in various countries of the
world as well as in the United States. In order to do this well,
an engineering student must study not only technical sub-
jects but those courses offered in the School of Liberal Arts
such as psychology, foreign languages, sociology, literature,
and political science. With a successful combination of tech-
nical and liberal arts courses, the Pitt engineer can confi-
dently enter the world of industry and human relations pre-
pared to devote his most intelligent efforts to the ideals of
progress.

CHEMICAL PROCESSES are erected in min-
iature in the units laboratory. Here the chemical
engineer gets practical experience in setting up
experiments, reading gauges, and charting con-
clusions.

THE BULLETIN BOARD is one of the best means of com-
municating university activities to the engineering students. Since
many of their classes keep them in the engineering buildings,
notices posted on the bulletin boards are often the only means of
keeping the engineer informed of the cultural and social events
on the university calendar.

A TRANSIT is part of the basic equipment used by the civil engineer. In survey-
ing, the engineer puts his classroom knowledge into practical application.

HEADS TOGETHER, engineers concentrate on a problem presented in a morning’s class. The
crowded schedule of the engineer requires that time outside the classroom be used to maximum

efﬁciency.

STUDY AND CONCENTRATION are neces-
sary in producing neat, accurate, and detailed
drawings. Developing good techniques in design
are an important part of a student’s education if
he is to become a ﬁrst class engineer.

educafion

Celebrates its ﬁftieth anniversary

TEST RESULTS are essential in evaluating the pupils’
capabilities and progress. Preparing and grading exarnina-
tions occupies many of the student teacher’s spare hours.

Founded on February 3, 1910, the University of Pittsburgh
School of Education this year celebrates ﬁfty years of prepar-
ing professional workers in education. During this time it
has continuously made improvements in its teaching program

by constant study and research. The school of education is '

now preparing teachers, supervisors, administrators, and spe-
cialists for every type and level of education. It is dedicated
to extending the frontiers of existing professional knowledge,
promoting higher professional standards, and providing con-

sultative service to other schools to improve their educa-

tional programs. _

The School of Education is included in the trimester pro-
gram and offered a full program of undergraduate and grad-
uate courses in the fall and winter trimesters. During the
spring trimester it offered introductory courses only, but
next year a more complete program is planned. In addition
to this, the School of Education will conduct its usual sum-
mer courses and workshops for teachers not attending the
third trimester. Student teaching is being done in the fall
and winter trimesters only, with emphasis on the fall term
so that student teachers may begin the public school semester
with their pupils.

Future plans for the School of Education include the erec-
tion of a new, separate building which will alleviate the space
limitations now imposed on it. In preparation for the Middle
States evaluation, the School of Education is undertaking
the task of redeﬁning its objectives and revising its curric-
ulum.

CONSOLATION and mediation are also jobs of the student
teacher. Learning to cope with all phases of classroom activity
is a major aspect of complete teacher education.

MAINTAINING ATTENTION in the classroom is an ability which the student
teacher must acquire. Cultivating interest and enthusiasm for the subject is essen-
tial if she is to teach effectively.

INDIVIDUAL HELP beneﬁts both the student and the
. teacher. The child gains increased knowledge and under-

standing of the subject matter while the prospective teacher

acquires broader insights into the child’s problems.

 

THE THREE R’S are still the basic elements
of a child’s education. Mastery of these funda-
mentals is necessary before the student can ad-
vance to more difficult work.

denfisfry

Adds new educational practices instead of

A BREAK in the routine often takes the form of a friendly card game. Students develop a close-
ness in their leisure time that carries over into study and work hours.

LAB EXPERIENCE is a vital
aspect of dental training. A stu-
dent develops patience and con-
centration as he learns to manip-
ulate the delicate tools of his
trade.

‘trimester

Unlike the other professional schools at the University of
Pittsburgh, the School of Dentistry has not been affected by
:the trimester system. The Dental School has not made a
deﬁnite conversion from the two semester plan due to the
added space, equipment, and instructors that would be re-
quired under a trimester program.

The Dental School, however, has initiated several new
practices into its own program this year which are very bene-
ﬁcial to its students. One of these is that students can now
begin treating patients in their sophomore year which is a
year earlier than under the old system. Another new feature
of the Dental School program, instituted last year, is the use
of educational television. It has been especially useful in
transmitting intricate laboratory work in vivid classroom
demonstrations.

As a vital part of the University of Pittsburgh’s medical
center, the School of Dentistry has gained a reputation as
one of the leading Dental Schools in the country. As a result,
the number of applications for admission is steadily increas-
ing and only the most qualiﬁed students are accepted. A
-student may enter the School of Dentistry at the end of two
years of study in an accredited school of liberal arts. Ad-
mission is based on a scholastic record of a “C” or better in
ipre-dental work, on the applicant's results on a manual dex-
terity test, and on his attitude and interest in the study of
dentistry.

MANUAL DEXTERITY is as important a part of the dental
student as his intellectual capability. Tasks requiring accuracy in
ﬁne details such as constructing an impression of a human mouth
teaches the student to improve his skill and to develop his patience.

THE DENTAL CLINIC not only provides the dental student
with the experience of treating patients but also beneﬁts the com-
munity by providing free dental care for those who cannot aﬂbrd
it.

X-RAYS play a vital role in locating the cause
of many disorders. A good technique in taking
and interpreting x-rays is an important part of
the dental student’s education.

nursing

Streamlines system to offer new

Like all other schools throughout the University, the School
of Nursing is adjusting its calendar and courses to the new
trimester system. The revised program offers many deﬁnite
advantages. An entering student will now be required to
matriculate only nine trimesters, or three calendar years,
instead of the former ﬁve years required to earn a baccalau-
reate degree. Essential learning experiences will not be for-
feited in this streamlined course of study.

The School of Nursing offers two programs leading to the
degree, Bachelor of Science in Nursing. One program is for -
graduates of hospital programs wishing to become profes-
sional nurses. The other is for graduates of hospital programs
wishing to earn a baccalaureate degree. Both of these pro-
grams lay the foundation for graduate work in nursing. The
aim of the baccalaureate programs is to prepare nurses to
practice in any setting. General education combined with
professional education prepares them to assume the leader-
ship role on the nursing team and after some staﬂ’ experience

The School of Nursing also offers graduate programs in
nursing leading to the degree Master of Nursing Education.
Nurses holding the professional baccalaureate degree may
prepare to become expert practitioners in a clinical area or
for one of the functional ﬁelds, nursing administration, nurs-
ing education, or nursing research.

ACADEMIC STUDY is as important to the
nurse as practical training. Before she can conﬁ-
dently accept responsibility on the ﬂoor, she must
spend hours reading, attending lectures, and
doing research.

DINNERTIME is not always an escape from work, for the nurse is interested
in her patients and their progress often becomes the topic of discussion around
the mealtable. The exchange of knowledge and observations is an integral part
of the learning process to the student nurse.

to function as a head nurse or an assistant clinical instructor. ~

advantages

.t RELAXATION in the residence
after a busy day in the hospital
is a welcome change of pace.
Laughing together, working to-

‘ gether, learning together—a]l
combine to create a deep bond
of friendship among Pitt nurses.

 

A CASE STUDY can be thor-
oughly discussed in a small sem-
inar while a demonstration can
be adapted to a large lecture
hall. Techniques learned in the
classroom are later applied in
actual practice when the nurse
assumes her position as part of
the hospital staff.

ON DUTY has many meanings
to the student nurse. It includes
time spent at the nurses station
making charts and receiving
calls. In addition, it involves
time spent on the ﬂoor and in
actual bedside care.

pharmacy

Studies total trimester conversion

MORTAR AND PESTLE, the symbol of pharmacy, are useful
in mixing powdered medicines and pills. Pharmacy students be-
come very familiar in their daily labs with the equipment they

will use in their future profession.

The University of Pittsburgh's School of Pharmacy endeav-
ors to “equip young men and women for successful careers in
the profession of pharmacy.” This goal is accomplished by
giving its students both classroom study and practical ex-
perience. In addition to requiring that each student serve an
apprenticeship of two years in a pharmacy or drug store, the
school arranges ﬁeld trips to laboratories of drug manufac-
turing ﬁrms in the junior and senior years.

The School of Pharmacy, in keeping with the transition to
the trimester system, this year began to make adjustments
in its curriculum. The school is a member of the American
Council on Pharmaceutical Education which has extended
the present four year program to ﬁve years. Following this
plan, the school requires new students to take a two year
preparatory course in the School of Liberal Arts and then
spend the remaining three years in the School of Pharmacy.
The time necessary to complete this program will be con-
siderably shortened for those students who elect the trimester
system.

Two separate calendars were put into effect this year4—one
for juniors and seniors, and one for freshmen and sophomores.
Many of the pharmacy students, however, elected the tri-
mester system this year in order to lighten their work load.

Investigation, resulting in complete conversion to the tri-
mester system, is the goal of the School of Pharmacy in the
future.

A SHELF OF BOTTLES containing drugs is a familiar sight to the pharmacy
student. It takes many hours of study to learn the composition and use of

the materials in each bottle.

READING THE GAUGE at eyelevel is the best way to obtain accuracy. Interest,
skill, and patience are required of the pharmacy student in order to obtain perfect
results.

ACCURACY in measuring ingredients is abso-
lutely necessary. The difference of only one grain
can often ruin the desired effect of the pharma-
cist’s work.

PHARMACY LAB is one of the most important and time consuming courses in the student’s
curriculum. It is here that he gains the practical experience necessary before he enters his profession.

MINUTE MEASUREMENTS are more common to the phar-

in working with small amounts is gained through numerous ex-

» CONSTANT CHECKING and rechecking of an experiment though time consuming is neces-
sary. The more familiar the student becomes with his work the less chance there will be for a pos-
sible error on his part.

New processes and increased production rates require refractories capable of withstanding operating conditions

more severe than previously encountered.

\\

HARBISON-WALKER REFRACTORIES
help industries set new production records

In the manufacture of iron and steel, aluminum,
glass, cement and many other products, Harbison-
Walker research and the most modern manufac-
turing facilities provide refractories which are
helping to set new production records. An impor-
tant contribution to the success of the basic oxygen
steelmaking process has been the development of
specialized refractories needed to meet the ex-
tremely severe operating conditions. In the achieve-
ment of the all-basic open hearth furnace, para-
mount among refractories necessary for the new
oxygen steel metallurgy, is Harbison-Walker’s im-
proved internally plated metal-encased roof brick.

For the greatly expanding aluminum industry

with its many new alloys, Harbison-Walker now
produces a series of stabilized high-alumina refrac-
tories of greatest durability, by means of which
contaminants are avoided in the metallurgy of
precision compositions.

Other analogous examples include the rapid evo-
lutionary petroleum reﬁning processes and glass
manufacture in its ever extending uses for which
specially adapted refractories are needed.

Through constant research, rigid quality control
and with continual plant modernization and ex-
pansion, Harbison-Walker maintains its leadership
in the world of refractories, contributing to indus-
trial progress.

there is a
bright future
in foods

. . . and this new Heinz Research Center stands as a promise of the growing world leader-
ship of H. J. Heinz Company in the field of food processing.

Located in Pittsburgh, on the north bank of the Allegheny, it is the hub of the Heinz inter-
national operation. In its ultramodern laboratories, test kitchens and pilot plant, new prod-
ucts are born, new packaging ideas conceived, new methods of factory processing formu-
lated. ,

Here research in the field of nutrition is carried on—to be translated into more healthful,
as well as more ﬂavorful, foods for infants and adults. Here, with scientific exactness, the
high standards of the 57 Varieties are rigidly guarded.

With facilities of this most modern Research Center—and with its staff of talented, well-
trained personnel—pointing the way toward an even more effective production of quality
foods, Heinz looks with confidence to the future.

H. J. Heinz Company wishes for each of you a bright future filled with challenge, fulfill-
ment and just reward.

It’s a little after 2 a.m. and the office, for
the first time in two weeks, is deserted.
Except for me, of course. The coffee is
boiling in the next room, I have half a
pack of cigarettes left, and the Pirates
have just ﬁnished beating the Giants in
San Francisco, 6-3. Across the room‘ the
calendar we’ve been keeping stands at two I
days until the ﬁnal deadline is due in Buf-
falo. We’ll make this one, but it'll be the
ﬁrst all year. I'm afraid Jewell Gates and
Don Messenger of Keller’s, our printer, have had a hard time
with us this year. But they’ve done well, despite all the trouble
we've caused them, and I thank them with
the deepest thanks possible. Ralph Benz
of S. K. Smith didn’t have so much trou-
ble, but he managed to help us come up
with a pretty good cover and the OWL
appreciates this too. And then there is
Sam Fields of Delma Studios, who intro-
duced us to the glory that was Rome at
Romeo Salta when we were in New York
for ACP. A deep thanks goes to all of these
people and to their ﬁne companies for the
great work they’ve turned out for us.
I'm writing this note now because the two days to go before the
deadline will be filled with hard work and I may not get the
time later to do the job I want to do. It to “ *
has been a good year and a hard one, but
I think we’ve turned out a decent book
and, in spite of the faults I can see now as
I look back over what we’ve done, I like
it. The year section is very different from
what the OWL has tried in the past; I
hope Pitt is ready for it. There are some
schools who have been using this type of
year section for a long time. In fact, the
boys at a certain north-country, Ivy-
league school will probably be very sur-
prised when they see the 1960 OWL. We've admired their work
for some time, and I can’t help feeling that this is the right way
to tell the story of the year. It is with a
very sincere thanks that we acknowledge
our debt to the Dartmouth AEGIS.
Well, staff, it's your turn now. To Chris,
my closest friend and brother in every
sense of the word, thanks very much for
returning after being Editor of the 1959
OWL to be my Layout Editor. We've
been at this yearbook game a long time,
haven’t we? To Hank, my Associate
Editor and right hand, without you this

book would have actually been impossi-
ble, and a very special thanks for your
great photography of everything from rol-
ler bearings to Fraternity Sweethearts.
To my Editorial Assistants who wrote
what I consider some of the finest prose
I’ve ever seen in any yearbook, I thank
you deeply. Betty Ellen and Dimitri, so
much of what is good in the year section
is yours, that I'm almost jealous. And
Elsa, who was always there when we
wrote, thanks for those hard sought-after
words and phrases you always seemed to come up with to give
the copy that extra punch. Arleen, my Literary Editor, and Ken,
my Photo Editor, I appreciate all that
the two of you have done for the book,
and although some of it may have seemed
like drudgery, it would have been far
harder for me without your help. Angie,
my Secretary, thanks for your work and
your loyalty, which is even more impor-
tant in the final essence. And to all the
others, there are so many of them, who
worked long and hard, or even helped
occasionally, we owe something to all of
you and we thank you. To Don for that
extra hard push there at the end; to Jack, for being with us at
deadline time; to Neffer and Ummy for your sports; to the other
photogs, Sandy, Jerry, Bill, and Bill; to
Carol, Chris, and all the girls who typed
or copied layouts; to everybody who did
what they could for us, one great big
THANKS!

Well, the birds are chirping outside, the
ashtray is full, and the sky is turning from
black to blue, but before going home for a
few hours sleep (Geology T3 BA/9am T-
Th/1o1 CH), I have two more people to
thank: my Business Manager, Jack, for
his hard work and constant trust in what-
ever I was doing, and Dr. Donald E. Swarts, our advisor and
friend, who was always there when we needed him to help, to '
encourage, or to defend the OWL.

The proudest moment of my life was
when Chris and Doc broke the news to
me that I had been elected Editor of the
OWL. I shall always honor this as a great
privilege. And the second proudest mo-
ment of my life will be when, with mixed .
feelings of relief and regret, I turn my
desk over to so capable a man as Hank.

Again, I thank you all very much.

‘As I sit here at the typewriter for what
may be the last time in connection with
the OWL, I ﬁnd it hard to put into words
just what I want to say about the ﬁnejob
~the staff of this book has done. Probably
the one man at Pitt to whom I owe more
than any other man is Dr. Donald E.
Swarts. Doc has been an invaluable aid
to me and to the yearbook. Thanks, Doc,
I for all your help. I know that you, just as
I, will remember the ﬁne times we’ve had
\at Buffalo and New York City on the OWL trips long after we
have forgotten the hours of hard work that were necessary to
i make such trips possible. Along with Doc,
I would like to thank his very eﬂicient
secretary, Marian, for her help and gen-
eral assistance on all OWL business mat-
ters. I don’t think we could have done
without you this year. To Will, last year’s
Business Manager of the OWL, I owe
special thanks for taking over the or-
ganization section voluntarily and han-
dling the entire project himself. Will has
done a ﬁne job on this book just as he did
4 on his own book, and without his constant
aid the book would never have enjoyed the success it has. I
would also like to thank George for his special help on the OWL,
and although he was connected with all stu-
dent publications as over-all Comptroller,
‘I feel sure he still considered himself
mainly a member of the yearbook staff.
To Doojie I owe the special thanks for
being a very capable and reliable assist-
ant throughout the year. Even while you
had many other things to do, you were al-

help. For the excellent advertising section
in this production, I owe thanks to mainly
two men, Gary and Ron, who between
them were able to get most of the advertising for the book.
Gloria was also very helpful to the advertising staff and despite
her busy schedule was still able to do
some pavement pounding to bring in a
few ads. To Tony I owe thanks for tack-
ling the job of Circulation Manager and
trying so hard to sell the book to the stu-
dent body. Mary handled the sometimes
very diﬂicult job of publicity for the book.
She and her staff sent out hundreds of
postcards to the students, and I appreci-
ate the time they spent working for the
book. Cathy was the Exchange Editor, a
job which falls partly under both staffs,

letters and correspondence with other schools that comprised
most of your job. Ken deserves thanks also for the heavy corre-

spondence sent out to the one hundred and some student or-
ganizations on the Pitt campus. And thanks to Margie for the
very unglamorous job of keeping track of the subscription

cards. I would also like to thank the many
other people who helped us produce this
issue of the OWL; people like Jim, Marty,
Skip, Gay, Sylvia, and Bob, without
whom it would have been far harder.

I would like to take this opportunity to
extend special thanks to the entire edi-
torial staff for producing such a ﬁne book.
All the photographers, writers, layout
people deserve special recognition for a
job well done. To our Editor, Ron, I want
to extend a hearty thanks for the work done, and along with
this, a very appreciative congratulations for producing such a
ﬁne yearbook. To the Wm.  Keller
Company, who printed our book, to the
S. K. Smith Company, who produced the
covers, and to Delma Studios for the
senior portraits, I want to express my
deepest appreciation for excellent work-
manship.

Finally, I would like it to be known that
no matter what I may do in life, and no
matter how successful I may become, I
will always fondly remember that it was
on the University of Pittsburgh OWL
that I and the 50-odd Business Managers before me received
our first great responsibility. I would like to thank the Univer-
sity for this opportunity which I feel has
been an extremely important part of my
education.

Good luck, Hank and Ron, with the
1961 OWL. I’ll be waiting eagerly to see
the ﬁne book you two will turn out.
