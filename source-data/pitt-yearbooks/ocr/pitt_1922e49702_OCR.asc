HARRY HOFFER,
Winnipeg, Canada
St. Johns Technical High

Red hails from Canada. He tried to in-
troduce Canadian Dentistry in Pitt, but the

Vince thoroughly believes in a day off

If Freda misses on a quiz she makes

His motto better late than never. He
surely sticks to it by coming to school
after nine o’clock. I wonder where he
goes at night, that always makes him late.

Just now it’s his fussing and his studies

Herman says little but we take it for
granted that he knows a lot. Herman can
tell you anything about anything if you
only ask him. How about the cow-boll,
Herman?

around school knows when or how often
he has a date.

Alex is our spectacled genius. He is a
very studious young fellow and has accom-
plished a great deal in the short time he
has been away from high school and short
trousers.

there is a way.

The Cabinet of the class of 1923 was selected last November by the President of
the class, G. Dixon Shrum. It was felt that the six hundred and ﬁfty-seven members
of the class could not be assembled readily and that a smaller group of advisers,
with committees on social affairs, publicity, and inter-class relations, could be
summoned to discuss questions of class and University importance. The Cabinet
was composed of the class oﬂicers, the oﬂicers of the girls’ organization, the presi-
dents of each school organization, and a number of other members of the class who
have taken prominent part in activities.

With the activities of the Sophomore Class centered in this body a program was
outlined. To begin with a class platform embodying the policies of the class on
inter-class relations, especially the freshman policy, on social events, dues, member-
ship, and meetings, and also containing the ideals of University spirit and loyalty
held up by the class, was drawn up by the Cabinet, and later unanimously adopted
by the Class. This platform is the working basis for all class activities.

The Cabinet meets twice a month and has discussed many matters relative not
only to the class but also to the University welfare and has put into concrete form
a number of resolutions which, after approval by the class, were sent to the Senate,
the Faculty or proper body. The Cabinet is not an imaginary, abstract, or honorary
organization, but a functioning body.

The membership of the Cabinet follows:

Alumni Artinitira

WITH “Alumni Hall” in process of construction, serving to keep Pittites closer
to Alma Mater than at any time in the history of the University, the past year was
an exceptionally gratifying one from the standpoint of alumni interest. As a result
of all this, membership in the General Alumni Association shows a decided increase
since the last issue of the “Owl". '

The chart on the opposite page shows the membership to be 3,500, January 1,
1921, and this ﬁgure. was increased by more than a hundred when the “Owl” went
to press, or a total of over 3,600. With the additional members secured from the
1921 Senior class, the ﬁgure at the wind-up of the collegiate year will be near the
charmed 4,000 mark. There are few Alumni Associations in the country which can
boast of a paid-up membership of this magnitude.

Owing to the fact that the cost of “Alumni Hall” exceeded the original estimate
by about $200,000, it was necessary to conduct a second campaign during the month
of January. This was handled by Alumni Council, with Carlton G. Ketchum, ’15,
J. Steele Gow, ’15, and the Alumni Secretary acting as Directors. With the aid of
an additional $50,000 from Athletic Council, (making a total of $100,000 from that
source), the required amount was realized.

The second campaign brought in many new subscribers, and a large percent-
age of the original subscribers increased their gifts—many of them 100 percent.
Chairman VVilbur D. Hockensmith, ’01, of Alumni Council, started what was called
the “One Hundred Per Cent Club” for such subscribers and the response was ﬁne.
It did a lot to put things “over the top.” During the progress of the Campaign,
members of Alumni Council held frequent meetings, sometimes two a week, and this
all helped to develop Pitt spirit and enthusiasm.

Athletics, as usual, played an important part in developing alumni spirit. The
1920 football season was the greatest on record in this respect and thousands of
“grads” came back for the games. The demand for tickets was so great that for
the more important contests the alumni only could be supplied, and it was neces-
sary to restrict the number which they secured.

The 1920 Commencement banquet was a decided success. It was held at the
Hotel Schenley, June 9, and was attended by a crowd which taxed the capacity of
that large banquet hall. Col. Joseph H. Thompson, ’05, was toastmaster and the
speakers were C. B. Connelley, Louis Broido, ’17, Dr. John Thom Holdsworth, Floyd
Rose, ’96, and Chancellor S. B. McCormick.

Pitt graduate organizations had their usual affairs during the year and the
alumni were very active on the various advisory committees in charge of under-
graduate activities, lending valuable assistance in these important undertakings for
Pitt betterment.

members of that year’s debating team for the purpose of giving recognition to stu-
dents who were leaders in forensic work by means of an honorary fraternity. At
the beginning of the next school year, the society petitioned Delta Sigma Rho, the
national honorary forensic fraternity with the result that a charter was granted.
The national president, Stanley B. Houck of Minneapolis, Minnesota, installed the
chapter personally at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. The following men were
taken in as charter members.

ALPHA LAMBDA NU

Alpha Lambda Nu, a wo111an’s activities fraternity, was organized Commence-
ment week, 1916, by seniors and juniors who believed that the work an under-
graduate does in activities at the University is worthy of recognition and that by
such recognition girls would be encouraged to engage in activities and to take a
leading part in school affairs. To be eligible for 111e1nbership a girl must be about
to complete her junior year, have participated in activities and possess a pleasing per-
sonality, maintaining high ideals of Womanhood and good standing in scholarships.
During 1917-18 the standard of Alpha Lambda Nu was still maintained though little
was done except to increase the membership. In 1919 the scope of work for the
fraternity ‘was widened. The work of 1920 has been to further the ideals of its
founders and to bring the fraternity to the attention of the scholastic and collegiate
circles.

December 5, 1920, the Women’s Activities Association which for years had been
the general organization of Women students of the University of Pittsburgh was
converted into the Women’s Self Government Association. W. S. G. A. aims toward
furthering the best interests of the women on the campus and for this end it co-
operates with the University administrators in supervising all activities in which
women are engaged. Its membership comprises all the women of the University.
W. S. G. A. has inaugurated a broader policy than W. A. A. The administration
has given it all powers generally conceded to a self—governing body. It has control
over the social life on the campus of the women students, conducts Vocational con-

ferences for undergraduates, provides social contacts, through parties, dances and
receptions. It aims to provide proper housing conditions for the out-of-town girl

and in a general way tries to maintain high soial standards.

Part of the program for the year has been as follows: an Intercollegiate Voca-
tional Conference, a series of informal receptions to the faculty and students, parties
for the girls on the campus, a number of teas for high school seniors, a reception
for alumnae, “Varsity Show”, a co—ed issue of the Panther. In addition to the
work on the campus, a representative Was sent to the Intercollegiate Se1f-Govern-
ment Conference at Elmira, New York.

The Young Men's Christian Association has enjoyed a steady growth, and a
constantly enlarging ﬁeld of service, ever since its organization in 1911, by George
Kirk and his cabinet. In November 1918, it was reorganized as a branch of the
Pittsburgh Metropolitan Y. M. C. A., at which time Dr. H. M. Moore took active
charge of the work on the campus. The immediate direction of all activities is in
the hands of a Student Cabinet, while the general administration is invested in a
Coniniittee of Management, which includes Students, Alumni, Faculty Members and
Trustees.

The Y. M. C. A. Hut, which was erected during the days of the Students’ Army
Training Corps, serves as the student center for young men. A daily average of
over 900 visit it for study, letter writing, recreation, or as a meeting place for the
various student organizations. The “Y” seeks to be of especial service to the in-
coming classes, and maintains a friendly feeling towards foreign students. Approxi-
mately 1000 copies of the Handbook were given personally to the new students dur-
ing the opening days of school last fall, and the “Get Wise Night” for New Students
was a success. The religious activities work have majored in the organization of
Bible Discussion Groups, and co-operation with the Student Volunteer Movement,
Pitkin Club and Student Vespers.

The Pitkin Club is an organization of Christian students, irrespective of creed,
which meets every Wednesday noon at the Shadyside Presbyterian Church. It was
founded in 1914 by the delegates to the Student Volunteer Convention at Kansas
City, and received its name from Horace Pitkin, a martyr missionary in China.
With the help and leadership of Dr. Hugh T. Kerr the club has continued since
then,—gaining in membership each year, having this year a roll of approximately
95-with an average attendance of about 80. This year the club continued in the
study of “The Faiths of Mankind”, a comparative study of the great religions of the

world.

The Chess Club of the University of Pittsburgh was organized in the fall of
1919 with six members. The ﬁrst president was Cyrus G. Dunkle and the secre-
tary—treasurer Henry S. Frank, both then sophomores in the School of Chemistry.

The tournament held during 1919-1920 resulted in Dunkle winning the champion-
ship.

The ﬁrst meeting of the Chess Club was held October 13, 1920, at which time
Albert E. Hoyt, Chemistry, ’23 was elected President; Leon N. Loeb, Chemistry, ’22,
Vice-President; and Norman J. Harrar, Col., ’22, Secretary-Treasurer. Special
efforts to enlarge the club resulted in the membership reaching twenty-nine and an-
other campaign for members in the second semester almost doubled this number.

The tournament of 1920-1921 was again featured by the playing of Dunkle, who
defeated the best players in the club and captured the championship. The Chal-
lenge Round and Inter-Class Tournament also helped maintain interest in the
game throughout the year.

tournament and in so doing, defeated everyone of the other players who later made
up the Chess Team of 1921. Dunkle won ten games, drew one game with Smyers
and lost one game to Harrar.

Athlrtira---IHEH

Perhaps due to the resurrection of sports after the war period, Pitt enjoyed an
athletic year that was quite indicative of its pre-war strength, which so practically
dominated college sport activities in this section for many years. The season of
1920-21 boasted of representative Pitt teams in every branch of sport, football,
basketball, baseball, track, swimming and tennis. Aviation which made its initial
bow at the University last year progressed in ﬁne manner—the team having been
entered in the big intercollegiate meet.

The football team maintained a. clear slate having gone through the season un-
defeated. Captained by Herbert Stein, the team went to Syracuse where it was de-
feated during 1919 and was able to hold the Or.ange gridders to a 7-7 tie. Likewise
did the championship battle with Penn State end a 0-0 tie." This together with the
fact that Herbert Stein made Walter Camp’s All-American eleven and Tom Davies
the second team stamps this football team and season as a very illustrious one.

The 1920 track team led by “Red” Weigel and managed by Harry Gow gave a
good account of itself. Although many colleges had excellent track teams yet Pitt
was able to make .a favorable showing in all competition.

The basketball team, not quite as successful as the others, nevertheless made
an enviable showing. Their old time rivals, W. & J. and W. Va. were handily de-

feated although Penn State was able to defeat the Panther ﬁve twice.
was captained by Herbert McCracken and managed by Howard Haines.
man team as well as the girls’ team also had a most successful season.

The team
The Fresh-

The tennis season of 1920 was not as successful as might have been expected,
yet this season’s team expects to more than make up for last year’s deﬁciencies.

Swimming this year can easily boast of having one of the best successful teams
in its history. Meets with Navy, Johns Hopkins, Syracuse and other eastern
schools took place and at each one of these affairs, the Panther performed to satis-
faction of all. Harry Taylor, Thomas Kestler and especially Pat Corr form a quartet
of the best swimmers Pitt has had for a long while.

The Freshman football and basketball teams each made wonderful records.
Perhaps Pitt has never been able to lay claim to two better Junior teams than these
that represented them the last season. Much good material is expected from both of
these teams.

As for boxing and wrestling nothing certain can as yet be said although a few
tryouts have been held and coaches from the schools assigned, no real meets were
arranged. However from the way things “size—up” now it looks as though both of

these sports are to materialize into major sport activities at Pitt within a very
short space of time.

For the ﬁfth time in six years Glenn Warners’ prodigies were undefeated on
the gridiron. The season of 1920, while not the most successful the Panthers have
enjoyed, was a big success, qualiﬁed only by tie games with Syracuse and Penn
State. Victories were chalked up over Geneva, .West Virginia, Georgia Tech,
Lafayette, Penn and W. & J.

Four big teams of the East, Princeton, Harvard, Penn State and Pitt were un-
defeated. Each played one tie, while Pitt and Penn State each were held even in
addition to their own scoreless clash.

Princeton seems clearly to have outplayed Harvard while there was little doubt
in the minds of the critics of Pitt’s superiority over Penn State last Thanksgiving.
By elimination we have Pitt and Prnceton sharing between the two of them
Eastern grid honors. There is little to afford a comparison between the twb in-
stitutions save their games with West Virginia who after being humbled by the
Panthers, 34-13, held the Tigers to a 14-3 score. The fact that Pitt played unde-
feated through a more difficult schedule than Princeton would seem to add strength
to any claim the Panthers might make to superiority _over Princeton. All four
teams had great elevens and there is no desire on Pitt’s part to make for itself any
championship claims, save only to share in the honor of being one of the greatest
aggregations of the country during the 1920 season.

It is doubtful if any team in the country was forced to meet as strong teams
Satuiday after Saturday as was Pitt. The only soft spot on the entire schedule
was the opener with Geneva, which the Panthers won handily, 47-0.

The second game with West Virginia was expected to prove diﬂicult but
Coach Warner had his men on edge and a 34-13 victory resulted.

Then came the 7-7 tie with Syracuse, our 1919 conquerors, on a muddy grid-
iron. Georgia Tech, with the greatest team of its history came North and for the
third successive year was bowed to defeat. Lafayette was the next victim, 14-0,
although for the most part, she outplayed the Panthers.

November saw Penn fall, 27-21, afer an unexpected hard fought game, and
W. & J. conquered, 7-0, in a defeat that Was no dishonor to our ancient rivals.
Thanksgiving brought the great undefeated teams, Penn State and Pitt, together
and honors were even.

The playing of Captain Stein, who was named All-American center by Walter
Camp, and of Captain-elect Tommy Davies, generally recognized as the greatest
half-back in the country, stood out all year. Tom Holleran, at quarter, did great
work and made the majority of Davies’ famous runs possible by excellent inter-
ference. Herb Mccracken played splendid football all year, while Anderson and
Hewitt both at times shone at fullback. Williams, Edgar and McCr0ry took care
of the ends, with Harman, Gourley, Sacklowsky, McC1ean, and Bond holding the
center of the line. ‘The other members of the squad who received letters were
Bowser, Byers and Clark.

Herb Stein made a great leader and showed wonderful aggressiveness. Tom
Davies has been elected captain for 1921, and promises to lead fully as great a team
as did Captain Stein. Only McCracken and McCrory are lost by graduation from
the 1920 squads, and with strong additions from the Freshman squad prospects
are good for 1921. The schedule will be just as difficult as in 1920, with Nebraska
and Cincinnati taking the place of Georgia Tech, the other games remaining un-
changed. Lawrence I. Klinestiver has been appointed Student Manager for 1921,
succeeding Robert G. Eckhart.

PITT, 47; GENEVA, 0.
(October 2)

In conquering the Beaver Countians, Glenn Warners’ Panthers, fresh from
three weeks at football camp, showed wonderful early season form. Every man
on the squad played a portion of the game, and at no time was there a let-up in the
form of Captain Stein’s men. The Warner Machine showed to best advantage. At
no time could Geneva effectively halt the Panthers’ march toward the goal, nor did
they at any time come near threatening the Pitt goal. To pick an individual star
would be impossible, although the playing of Herby Mccracken was noteworthy.

PITT, 34; VVEST YIYRGINIA, 13.
(October 9)

This was expected to prove one of the hardest games of the season. West
Virginia had great material and to this game Warner had his men pointed from the
ﬁrs . The “Snakes” were the ﬁrst to score but the count was soon evened and the
l1alf ended 21-6, in favor of the Panthers. With Davies, Holleran and Mccracken
carrying the ball it seemed almost impossible to stop them. That trio “pulled off”
gain after gain through double and triple and forward passes. Herb Stein was a
tower of strength on the defense. Beck, the former Harrisburg Tech phenom,
played a bang-up game, making the longest run of the game through the entire Pitt
teen). Warner made many substitutions without any apparent let-up in the team
D 33'-

PITT, 7; SYRACUSE, 7.
(October 16)

A drizzly rain and slimy gridiron prevented either Pitt or Syracuse from show-
ing to best advantage. Fumbling proved costly to both sides and was indirectly
responsible for both teams’ scoring. In the ﬁrst half, Abbott, Syracuse fullback,
fumbled on his own 25-yard line, with Stein recovering for Pitt. From that point
Pitt carried the ball over on straight football, “Tiny” Hewitt making the score. In
the third quarter Syracuse tied the count, when Gulick picked up Laughran’s fumble
in midﬁeld and ran for a touchdown. What little advantage there was probably
rested with Pitt. The Panthers were the speedier outﬁt and handicapped that much
more by the condition of the ﬁeld. Tommy Davies was unable to get started in the
mud. Anderson played the best game for Pitt, although Hewitt’s line plunging
featured. The entire team played well, with the defense work of Stein and Harman
standing out. Gulick, Alexander and Abbott were the Orange Mainstays.

PITT, 10=; GEORGIA TECH, 3.
(October 23)

The following Saturday the Georgia Tech team came North with the greatest
team of its history and conﬁdent of avenging the two defeats already received at the
hands of the Panthers. She was doomed to disappointment but put up a game and
a worthy ﬁght. They marched down the ﬁeld several times to within our 10-yard
line, but lacked the punch to put it over, their best being a lone ﬁeld goal by Flowers
from the 18-yard line. Towards the close of the third quarter Georgia Tech lost
the ball on downs on Pitt’s 6-yard line. Here “Tiny” Hewitt started an almost
single-handed march down the ﬁeld terminating in a touchdown. Before the game
ended Davies kicked a ﬁeld goal from the 30-yard line. It was one of the prettiest
games to watch a person would care to see. The playing of Flowers, Harlan and
Barron, in the Tech backﬁeld was spectacular. Aside from Hewitt’s great plung-
ing, the playing of Stein, Holleran, Davies and Sacklowski featured. Following the
game future relations with Georgia Tech were discontinued.

PITT, 14; LAFAYETTE, 0.
(October 30)

Lafayette had one of the most powerful elements of the country although in
their earlier games the breaks had been against them and their record had not been
impressive. The same proved true in the Pitt game. From tackle to tackle the
Lafayette line outplayed the Pitt line, with Schwab as the outstanding star. Time
and time again they marched down the ﬁeld only to lose the ball on downs within
our 20-yard line. Pitt suffered a slight let—up after the ﬁrst three hard games. The
two touchdowns came as the result of two long runs of Tommy Davies, who played
a ﬁne game. Herb Stein played his usual game. Seascholtz was Lafayette best
bet in the backﬁeld, with Gazella and Leheca close seconds. The Eastonians were
coached by Dr. “Jock” Sutherland, famous Pitt guard of a few years ago, and its
was a case of coach against pupil, with the coach still slightly the wisest.

PITT, 27; PENN, 21.
(November 6)

On November 6, Tommy Davies, Pittsburgh’s wonder man, defeated the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania in one of the most thrilling grid battles ever staged at
Franklin ﬁeld. That tells the story of the Penn game. The Quakers showed a
reverse of form and played a strong game. Their aerial attack was a bewilderment
and the Pitt goal line was crossed thrice. But that could not beat Tom Davies.
For Pitt’s ﬁrst score Davies threw a forward pass to Holleran, who scored. On
the next kick—off he ran through the Penn teams’ 90 yards for a touchdown. In
the third period Davies scored again through two 30-yard runs and to ﬁnish a good
days work in the last period he caught a. Penn forward pass and ran 60 yards for
a touchdown. Davies had ten other men to help him, of course, but his feats stand,
out as the greatest single handed exhibition of the year.

PITT, 7; W. & J., 0.
(November 13)

The margin of Pitt’s superiority over our ancient rivals was not indicated by
the score. It should have been three touchdowns instead of one. W. & J. put up
a game ﬁght, with Erickson and Eilson occasionally throwing scares into the Pan-
thers. Pitt scored in the ﬁrst quarter, when Davies, on W. & J.’s 30-yard line
broke off tackle on one of his famous runs, cut in, dodged past McLaughlin and
crossed the line for the only score of the game. In the third quarter Pitt marched
to W. & J.’s one-foot line only to lose the ball on downs after a fumble. Twice
more was the ball carried within W. & J.’s ten yard line. Davies, Stein, McCracken,
and Holleran all starred for Pitt, while Carroll, Loucks and Russell Stein were much
in evidence on W. & J.’s defense. The game was played on a splendid ﬁeld, interest
was at high tension throughout and a capacity crowded watched the game, thous-
ands being unable to obtain tickets.

PITT, 0; PENN STATE, 0.
(November 25)

Thanksgiving brought together two great teams undefeated in a game that was
sure to be neck-and-neck. Unfortunately the game had to be played in a sea of
mud and as both teams were essentially offensive aggregations neither could show
at its best and it is hard to tell what might have happened on a dry ﬁeld. Unfor-
tunately, also, for Pitt, Tommy Davies had to be removed from the game in the
ﬁrst quarter on account of injuries. While he was in, he shot off tackle time and
again for big gains, and completely outclassed Way and Haines, States Aces. State
used a wide—open formation which seemed ill adapted to the muddy ﬁeld. State
carried the ball to Pitt’s 15-yard line once whereas Pitt was within their 10-yard
several times. An attempted ﬁeld goal by Davies was missed by inches. Herb
Stein starred at center, and McCrory, Harman and Holleran played well. The en-
tire team played its best game of the year and there is no doubt that, we deserved
to win.

VARSITY BASEBALL TEAM—1920

Eaathall

 

Following the determination of a few baseball enthusiasts that the sport be put
on its pre-war footing, arrangements were completed and Pitt was represented in
some very exciting contests. Although their victories were in the minority, much
material was uncovered by Coach Dick Harley, former big-league player and a man
of wide experience in baseball. Coach Harley looks to the coming season with
much optimism, and feels conﬁdent that with the majority of his last year’s material
in which to mould his team, he can produce a winning combination.

Tom Davies, last years Captain, played a good game at short-stop, and led his
men eﬂiciently. The Freshman team of last year won seven games out of eleven,
thus demonstrating their ability. With the merging of the holdover men from the
varsity and the Freshmen, this year will undoubtedly be successful, for Coach Harley
knows the ability of every man on both squads.

The schedule arranged by Student Manager Clark W. Green, includes one long
trip to the east taking in Yale, Rhode Island State, Holy Cross and Brown Univer-
sity, as well as one and two day jaunts to Penn State, West Virginia University,
Western Reserve and W. & J.

Eaakvthall---1921

The basketball season was only fairly successful the team winning but a few
more than half its games. However the Panthers rank second to Grove City in the
Tri-State championship and were the two teams to meet again would give them an
awful battle for supremacy.

Victories over W‘. & J. and West Virginia were the brightest spots of the season
and the double-defeat at the hands of Penn State the darkest. The ﬁrst State and
the ﬁrst W. & J. games were two of the greatest ever seen here. The almost in-
vincible State aggregation had a very close call, 38 to 35, at the hands of Capt.
McCracken’s boys, while W. & J. also possessing a strong team, fell 37 to 25.

The other bright spot on the schedule was the eastern trip on which Colgate
and West Point were defeated and the Syracuse game lost by a narrow margin.
During the Christmas holidays Dartmouth, Yale, and Cornell invaded this section
and only Cornell went away victorious.

The work of Lloyd Jordan featured, throughout the year. Against ﬁve of the
big eastern teams he averaged nine ﬁeld goals. He was constantly a marked man
and subjected to the closest guarding.

The team was captained by Herb Mccracken who made one of the best ﬁght-
ing leaders a team could have. In addition Herby played a high-class ﬂoor game
and his guarding was of high calibre. Playing the other guard position was “Red"
Byers, who played a fast ﬂoor game and proved a crack shot. Rose played the
other forward and his passing and shooting featured. Clawson was at center and
usually got the jump on his man.

The team was managed by Howard Haines and coached by Dr. George M. Flint.

The past season Pitt was represented by a swimming team which deserved to be
ranked with the best in the country. Duals meets were held with the Navy, Johns
Hopkins, Rensselaer and Syracuse, and only the Navy meet was lost. The Navy
was recognized as having by far the greatest team in the country and a defeat at
their hands was certainly no disgrace. Syracuse always has a strong team but was
defeated, 44 to 26.

In addition to the collegiate meets the team took part in all the local A. A. U.
meets and performed creditably, winning many points. . .

The individual work of Corr featured all the meets. On the eastern trips he
won eight ﬁrsts, two seconds, and a third. Harry Taylor also did some good work
and captured a number of points. The remainder of the team consisted of Jacobs,
Clark, Marshall, Thoma, Kistler and Baur. The team was in charge of Manager
Baur and Coach Taylor.

The tennis team did not enjoy a very successful year in 1920. Meets were lost
to Harvard, Swarthmore, Syracuse and W. & J. On the other hand most of the

' local schools such as Geneva, Bethany, Thiel, etc. were easily defeated. Lack of

courts again proved a big handicap to the team.

The team was composed of Smith, Monk, Lewis, Doane and Schmertz. The
freshmen had a very good team and with several men from that squad this year’s
team should compile a much better record, provide anything extensive is done this
year in tennis.

The Freshman football team was crowned in glory. This year’s team ran true
to form and displayed championship football. It has made a. record that many
minor college teams would be proud to possess. The Cubs meet the best yearling
teams in the country and have shown themselves to be among the leaders.

The outstanding feat of the season was the Syracuse contest. In this struggle,
the Freshmen proved themselves of championship calibre. Being nosed out by only
one point, a 14-13 score, the Cubs have a just right to be among the ﬁrst—year
leaders. In the ﬁnal reckonings, the Syracuse Freshmen were given the premier
position. Is it not some boost to hold the champions on almost the same level?

Next in importance comes the State Freshie struggle. The Panther Cubs re-
versed the “dope” and held the strong Mt. Nittany Babes to a 7-7 tie. Greatly out-
weighed and on the small end of the betting, the Pitt Freshies displayed great foot-
ball and took the ﬁght out of the Up-Staters.

The Freshmen defeated Parkersburg High 13-0 in the opening contest. They
played the West Virginia Reserves to a scoreless tie. They walloped Harrisburg
Tech 20—7«the ﬁrst defeat for this Prep school in four years. Kiski fell before
the onslaught, 6-0, for the ﬁrst time. The Yearlings lost their stride and succumbed
to the Indiana Normal attack, 7-0.

The collective excellence of the team was aided by the individual prowess of
several star performers. Capt. “Poke” Williams was the shining light. His general
all-around ability was the outstanding feature. Winterburn, Shuler, Robusch and
Colonna were the other capable members of the star backﬁeld.

The line w.as a stone wall.‘ Time after time the massed attacks of the oppon-
ents were hurled back. Fredette was the pivot and strong man of the line. Haines,
his ﬁrst assistant performed well when called upon. The guard positions were ably
taken care of by Seidelson, Lear, Lewis and Bryce. The tackles were well fortiﬁed
by Yost, Youngk and Newbaker. The wings of the line were handled by Burlay,
Fisher, Slessinger and Abels.

A tribute to such a team would not be complete without a Word of apprecia-
tion to the main spring, Coach Andy Kerr. Without Coach Kerr his ﬁne material
would have remained in its crude state; we would not have the well polished and
ﬁnished varsity material that we now possess. His success may be attributed not
merely to his football ability but also to his wonderful personality.

We can not restrain ourselves from feeling that this year’s crop of Freshmen
is going to wonderfully assist “Pop” Warner. Already we have visions of “Poke”
Williams and “Frenchy” Fredette trotting out in the Panther machine. We are
anticipating great things from this year’s Freshmen.

For the ﬁrst time since before the War Pitt was represented on the diamond
with a freshman nine in 1920. The team compiled an enviable record losing but
three games, those to California Normal, Indiana Normal and Kiski. Indiana Nor-
mal and Kiski were in return defeated along with the other leading prep and high
schools of the section. The feature of the reason was its heavy batting.

The team lined up with Hughes, catcher; Hendrian, Barnes and Noble,
pitchers; Clawson, ﬁrst; Holleran, second; Winterburn, short; Cooper, third; and
Cook, Barber and Fair, in the outﬁeld.

The Freshman ﬂoor team again compiled a remarkable record, but two defeats
bloting an otherwise perfect record. The one defeat was at the hands of McKees—
port High by two points, the other of Penn State Freshmen in a return game by a
lone point.

On the other hand practically all the best local high and prep school teams
were decisively defeated. Kiski and Indiana Normal were twice beaten, and West
Virginia Freshmen, Penn State Freshmen, and Geneva Reserves conquered once
each. In addition the team had little trouble defeating Schenley, Peabody, South
Hills, Carnegie and Norwin Highs.

The team was made up of Bowman and Levinson at forwards, Funk at center,
and Captain Carr, Youngk and Williams at guards.

The girls’ varsity basketball team has completed the seventh highly successful
season of its career, defeating by decisive scores all the strongest collegiate sextets
of the vicinity. Waynesburg, Geneva, Beaver, Thiel and Slippery Rock fell easy vic-
tims to the Panther lassies. For the ﬁrst ti-me in the history of girls’ athletics at
Pitt, a two-day trip was scheduled. The team played Slippery Rock on March 11,
leaving there for Thiel College on the 12th.

The varsity team for 1921 was with the exceptions of Ethel James, captain,
and Blanche Parker, composed of freshman stars of the 1920 season. Mary Chap-
man, Anna Anderson and Blanche Parker forwards, did some brilliant work. Mary
Chapman was especially good from the foul line. Elizabeth Dutney fulﬁlled her
earlier promises as a strong, reliable center and was ably assisted by either “Kit”
McNamara or “Kit” Roehn, side centers, and Florence Montgomery, Ethel James,
Grace Love and Edith Lazarus vied for positions at guard. Florence Montgomery
starred every game in Which she played.

Lemon Arnold coached the team. Katherine Saunders was manager, assisted
by Mary Zeigler.

Illreahman (ﬁirlrf Tﬁaakpthall §1>aan11—~-1921

The University of Pittsburgh has been a pioneer in developing ﬁrst class girls’
Basketball teams and the freshmen team of the past season has been no exception
A new policy was adopted in training the “freshies”, the coach aiming to develop a
well-rounded out squad and to discover new material, rather than to star any in-
dividuals.

The lineup included Mary Bigham, Arnoldine Lohman, Olive Wilt and Leah
Rothman at forward; Mary Robb and Christine Hooper at side center; Beryl Zeigler
at center; Nan Steele, Jean Robb, Ruth Sturdivant and Anna Stuffle at guard. After
1nid—year registration Eleanor Thomas, from Fifth Avenue High, played at center
and Beryl Zeigler moved to a guard position.

A. Lemon Arnold, Assistant Physical Instructor of the University, coached the
team. Mr. Arnold succeeded Mr. H. H. Provin as coach of the girls’ basketball
teams.

Mary Bigham was elected temporary captain at the initial game of the season,
which election was later reaﬁirmed. Mary Zeigler managed the team and Katherine
Roehn was apprentice manager.

COLLEGE IS OVER
——-WHAT’S NEXT?

Your career is ahead of you, with all
its opportunities and possibilities. If you
are going to be a success, you must have,
in addition to your professional ability,
a comprehensive view of the business
side of dentistry,---the side that has to
do with “Dollars and Cents.”

“fa”-Ii

Successful dentists are realizing the
importance of environment on their
patients. and the effect exerted on them
by modern. pleasingly appointed offices,
and up-to—date equipment.

When you buy equipment for your
___ofﬁce_, select the kind that will give you
»__the_ mgst efﬁcient and lasting service;:

the kindjthat will save your time, and
the time of your patients.

Ritter Equipment will do all of these
things, and more. It will give you a
big impetus on the way to ﬁnancial
success.

Write to-day for literature and
descriptions of Ritter Equipment.

Mental and Mechanical
Equipment

HATEVER your preparation for dental practice

 may be, the accumulation of specialized know-

ledge represents an asset in mental equipment.

It is a valuable asset; more valuable as you have con-

scientiously applied yourself to the mastery of the science
of dentistry.

Having acquired the knowledge and the training with
which to work out a successful career, the next consider-
ation is the character of the equipment which will enable
you to give the fullest expression to your abilities.

 

Manifestly, an environment and a mechanical equip-
ment of a standard below your personal standard will not
contribute to your best efforts, neither as an inspiration
nor as a material aid.

We urge you therefore to procure the best materials,
the best instruments, the best goods of every kind within
your capacity to purchase, not that they must be of our
manufacture but of the kind we have always endeavored
to provide.

Let your mechanical equipment equal your mental
equipment in that it is of the highest character possible
of attainment.

Fraternity Song . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. “Can You Tame Wild Women”?

As the name doubtless indicates, you will notice that this organization is one
of an unusual type, pointing out most clearly the new, independent status of Women,
and ignoring absolutely the existence of mere man as unworthy of any form of
recognition. Now we ask you, ain’t that just like a woman?

Fraternity Song . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. “Heaven will protect the woiking goil”

Here we introduce to the unwashed mob an organization whose dominant char-
acteristics are comprised of the indiscriminate use of smokeless powder, and ‘life-
long devotion to the application of Newtons' principle, “A bird in the frying pan is
worth two goldﬁsh in the ocean”.

Here is a shining example of a group of nice, harmless females with no ambi-
tion other than to grow a moustache like one of the Smith Brothers of Cough Drop
Famé. What could be sweeter?

That Djer-Kiss Jake!

True ove again, eh Jake? “Fish” can
also talk in the sign, or deaf and dumb
language. This is a great advantage, es-
pecially in assembly. Let him live to be
a hundred, we need him on the earth. No.
He has nothing to do with the Larkin Co.
Ask him about the trunk business.

He claims that movies are responsible for
keeping the home town folks out—some-
