KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA

The focal point of interest these days at 165 N. Dithridge Street is
the new trophy case. For the members of Kappa Kappa Gamma
take great pride in its latest additions, symbols of a busy and fruitful
year on campus. Among these are first place trophies for front and
show in last year’s carnival activities with Sigma Chi, and a National
Recognition Trophy for the most improvement in scholarship.

Kappa queens last year included Ellie Leslie, Delta Tau Delta and
IF Sweetheart, Homecoming Queen, and Pitt’s representative to the
Sugar Bowl; Darin Ceise, Military Ball Sweetheart; Popie Papandreas,
Senior Queen.

To promote their purpose of service to the community and the Uni-
Versity, the Kappas assisted in the Red Cross drive, held a Christmas
party for orphans, and with Delta Tau Delta, sponsored the annual
Kappa-Delt reception for the faculty.

KAPPA NU

For the last two years the Kappa Nus l1ave won
the Ugly Man contest hands down. This award,
however, has no bearing on the men of the chapter
as a whole. Ask any of the sororities who share
tea dances with them.

The KNs spent a lot of hours remodeling their
basement into a game room and added a ping pong
room this year—which shows both their industrial
tendencies and the pride they feel towards their
house and fraternity.

The big social events of the season for the
Kappa Nus were two formals—one in Winter and
another in the Spring. Interspersed with these
events were numerous parties and stag events:
most of which strove, naturally, to enlighten their
members in the various ﬁelds of ﬁne arts and to
beneﬁt them vocationally and mentally. Sounds
"ke they had some gay times, doesn’t it?

PHI EPSILON PI

From badminton to singing to hitting the books;
there’s nothing the Phi Eps don’t excel at. The
unusual versatility of the Phi Eps can best be seen
by inspecting the gigantic trophy case in their
Dithridge Street abode. The latest additions in
the case are ﬁrst place awards for scholarship,
bowling, badminton, and IF Sing.

Socially the Phi Eps are also a winner. Their
Winter and Spring formals are two of the high-
lights on their social calendar. They also hold two
house affairs each month.

Their reputation for enjoying themselves is
campus wide—and best evidenced in the farces
they annually produce for Spring Festival. The
last production they collaborated in—~“Dirty
Deed In Denmark”—may succeed in doing to
Shakespeare what time couldn’t. But never-the-
less everyone enjoyed themselves.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

For Phi Gamma Delta the number thirteen has
no unlucky connotation, for the Phi Cams are
the thirteenth oldest college social fraternity. But
when it comes to thinking up ideas, the Phi Gams
are certainly not hampered by this age barrier.

104

Last Christmas they got together with the Zeta
Tau Alpha sorority for an orphans party, and over
the year held a number of enjoyable parties.

The Fijis are proud to claim as brothers such
outstanding men as Reed Harper, president of
lnterfraternity Council, Tom Darling, Jack Ham-
mond, and Dave Hirst, mainstays of the Panther
gymnastic team. Darling was the Eastern Inter-
collegiate champ on the ﬂying rings.

ALAN MAGEE SCAIFE, PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD
OF TRUSTEES. . . Industrialist, philanthropist, military
leader-—all of these terms are applicable to Alan Scaife. But
above all of these is one word that most typiﬁes this man—
Pittsburgher. It is because of his intense love for his native Pitts-
burgh and its people that he has worked so hard to raise the
stature of Pitt, which is an integral part of the community.

Included in the charter of the Western University of Penn-
sylvania was the following sentence: ". . . the happiness
and prosperity of every Community (under the direction
of Divine Providence) depend greatly on the proper ed-
ucation of youth.” No one group of people has so com-
pletely taken this sentence to heart and has striven more
arduously for the proper education of the youth of their
city than the men who have been trustees of this Univer-
sity.

Who are these men? Their names are instantly recog-
nized by Pittsburghers. Names like Mellon, Scaife, F alk,
McKenna, Follansbee have long been synonymous with
the name of Pittsburgh. Most of these men grew up with
this city, and then helped it grow to be the industrial cap-
ital of the world. Their professions are varied: law, med-
icine, banking, the ministry, education, and industry. A
list of the companies they direct is a cross-section of
Pittsburgh industry.

These men have known that an industrial community
needs an abundance of trained leaders. Thus they have
educated engineers, labor relations men, accountants,
lawyers. And, because the trustees of the University of
Pittsburgh have lived in this city, as well as worked here,
they have set their sights beyond the city’s economic
interests to encompass the cultural needs of its people.

They have worked to improve and enlarge the Univer-
sity; they have envisioned an institution equal to the best
in the world. To help achieve this goal they have provided
the University with the best physical and administrative
material they could obtain. They sensed the greatness of
John Cabbert Bowman’s vision of a Cathedral of Learning
and cast it in stone. They brought his able successors,
Rufus H. Fitzgerald, and now, Edward H. Litchﬁeld, to
advance their grand design. Toward this end, they have
provided these educators with almost unlimited ﬁnancial
support. They have been able to do this because of their
assurance that the people of Pittsburgh will back them.
To men who have seen the citizens and corporations of
their city ﬁnish building their University in the midst of
the depression no undertaking seems too ambitious.

PHI KAPPA

Phi Kappa, national Roman Catholic fraternity,
is the only group that proﬁted at last year’s Spring
Carnival by losing their heads. They won a second
place award for their booth, “Heads Off to Shake-
speare.”

During the rest of the year, however, the Phi
Kaps managed to keep their heads. They held a
semi-formal affair at the Holiday House, and two
formals—0ne in December and one in June.

Besides social activities, the Phi Kaps head up
many charitable events, including an orphan’s
party.

Many Phi Kaps are active in school affairs.
Among the best known are Gene Reinhold, Tony
Arabia, and Dennis Zymboly.

PHI MU

In 1920, several young women at the University
of Pittsburgh banded together to form Alpha Mu,
a local sorority. Some time later, endowed with a
charter and a new name, Beta Theta chapter of
Phi Mu, became part of a national organization
and started on the path toward new goals of sister-
hood and friendship.

Through the years, Phi Mu has increased its
activities in line with its purposes. Last year, out-
standing contributions made by the group in-
cluded maintenance of a toy cart at Children’s
Hospital and an Easter party for orphans.

Last year’s calendar is proof that the Phi Mus
did not lack social activities. ‘Tea dances with
fraternities, a Christmas party, and the annual
winter formal helped to make busy days complete.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

The PiKAs might be a little harder to ﬁnd this
year than in the past, but they remain an active
force on the campus. The proﬁtable selling of
their house on Craig Street necessitated moving
to a temporary location. At present they are sit-
uated in an apartment in the Belleﬁeld Dwellings
until they buy another house.

Cramped quarters have not, however, curtailed
the large number of events in which they annually
participate. Foremost among their social events
are tea dances, the “Dream Girl” Winter formal,
a Spring formal, and an annual orphan’s party.

The PiKAs made quite a name for themselves
in the athletic world last year by copping the City
Touch Football Championship. Some of the oppo-
sition protested that the PiKAs were feigning
injuries to stop the clock at crucial moments dur-
ing the games. We can’t say whether these pro-
tests carry any legitimacy but ﬁve PiKAs did
win first place acting awards in Spring Carnival.

PI LAMBDA PHI

Horticulturists declare that the atmospheric and
climatic conditions of the Pittsburgh area are
not conducive to the growing of healthy plants.
The Pi Lams, however, disproved this theory by
showing how a sprig of ivy transplanted from
Yale in 1914 has blossomed into one of Pitt’s stur-
diest fraternities.

The Pi Lams~with two cheerleaders, the pres-
ident of a pre-legal honorary, and an assistant
chairman of Block “P” among their membership
~are not known for their tranquility. However,
from out of this maze of “hold that line,” “Yes,
your Honor,” and multi-colored pieces of card-
board has evolved one of the most active frater-
nities on campus.

Highlights of the Pi Lams social season are a
student-faculty tea, a Winter and Summer formal,
and the IF ping pong tournament—which they
won last year and which we had to mention some-
where.

founded at the University of Alabama. The Chi
Omicron chapter was started at Pitt in 1913.

In last year’s Spring Festival the SAES copped
four cups, including one for the best novelty act.
They proved, however, that not all of their time
was spent in merry-making by winning the IF
award for the most improved scholarship.

They strive to improve inter-college relations,
annually sponsoring a joint dinner with Carnegie
Tech’s chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. At this
affair alumni, state, and national oﬂicers are

ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE . . .

Foremost among those behind the University of Pitts-
burgh’s rapid rise in the ﬁeld of education are nine men—~
the Administrative Committee of the University. It is the
duty of these men to assure a successful culmination to the
“era” that is now beginning—to achieve the visions of the
school’s founders.

Heading this group is Dr. Edward H. Litchﬁeld, newly
appointed Chancellor of the University. In his effort to
place Pitt among the nation’s top schools Dr. Litchﬁeld
has completely reorganized the administrative set-up. For-
merly, each department of the University would send its
representative directly to the Chancellor who had to fit
meetings with each of them into his busy schedule. This
was declared impractical. It was decided that a system re-
quiring only eight or nine men to report their ﬁndings to
the Chancellor would be better than a method requiring
forty-ﬁve or ﬁfty separate reports. By lowering the num-
ber of reports, the Chancellor would be able to spend more

TO

time with each representative and more fully discuss his
problems. However, this meant that each representative
would have to be a highly learned and skilled person—he
would have to have a thorough and intense knowledge of
several related ﬁelds. For instance, the vice chancellor of
the health professions has to be able to know and compre-
hend the problems encountered in the schools of dentistry,
medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and the Graduate School of
Public Health. In addition, he must take care of all prob-
lems pertaining to F alk Clinic, the nurses residence, and
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. Men capable of
such formidable tasks are a relatively rare commodity.
Nevertheless, Chancellor Litchﬁeld has thus far managed
to ﬁll all but one of these positions.

Dr. Robert A. Moore has been named vice chancellor of
the health professions.The position of secretary of the Uni-
versity and dean of the faculties has been awarded to Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford, former dean of the College. Dr.

Alpha Zeta chapter of Sigma Delta Tau won national recogni-

convention in Estes Park, Colorado. Judging from this year’s
list of activities, they seem determined to win it again. They
started off the year by taking a pledge class of eleven, the largest
number taken by any sorority on the campus. These pledges
went right to work making seventy-ﬁve stuffed animals to be
sent to Heart House for Christmas. Meanwhile, the actives gave
a barn dance and presented the proceeds to their national phi-
lanthropy. Both actives and pledges joined together to enjoy
themselves at pledge parties, tea dances, and the annual Winter

ZETA TAU ALPHA

Members of Zeta Tau Alpha seem to thrive on ac-
tivity! A glance at last ycar’s Spring Carnival
shows that ZTA won first prize in the Kiddie Kar
race and took second place honors in the Women’s
Olympics. In addition, Bobby Spalie was last
year°s Spring Festival Queen. This year Sue Bid-
dle led the way as president of Block “P”, chief
justice of Senior Court, and a member of Heinz
Chapel Choir.

Not all of the Ze Las activity is conﬁned to win-
ning trophies. This year they gave a beneﬁt to
raise money for the support of the Allegheny
County Society for Crippled Children, and they
also sold Easter seals.

The Zetas enjoy social life, too, and this year’s
social calendar showed a Winter formal, a Christ-
mas orphan’s party, a party for the girls in ‘the
Zeta house, and a Spring formal.

ACHIEVE VISIONS OF SCHOOL’S F OUNDERS

Edward H. Litchﬁeld; Walter F. Vieh, assistant chancellor—business affairs; Albert C. Van Dusen, assistant chancellor—planning and
development; Charles H. Peake, assistant chancellor—student affairs. One position remained to be ﬁlled, vice chancello1~—the disciplines.

Crawford will act as liaison between the Chancellor and
the individual members of the faculty. In addition, he will
serve as secretary to the Board of Trustees, the Adminis-
trative Committee, and other committees. Named as the
vice chancellor of the professions was Dr. Elvis J. Stahr.
Dr. Stahr will direct the schools of law, engineering, edu-
cation, and the other professional schools. The assistant
chancellor of business affairs is Dr. Walter F. Vieh. Dr.
Vieh’s primary duty is ﬁnancial planning and keeping the
University operating within the limits of its budget. Dr.
Albert C. Van Dusen was named as the assistant chancel-
lor of planning and development, a job that attempts to
promote a strong bond between the University and its
alumni and works to obtain funds to help ﬁnance Univer-
sity programs. The man in charge of all student affairs is
Dr. Charles H. Peake, assistant chancellor of student af-
fairs. Dr. Peake’s primary concern is the student himself,
and whatwoutside of class~—his school life consists of. One

more position, the vice chancellor of the disciplines, has
not yet been ﬁlled. This position encompasses supervision
of the College in the natural, social, and military sciences
as well as physical education, the humanities and summer
and evening school. Appointed to the position of executive
assistant to the Chancellor was Dr. Alan C. Rankin. Dr.
Rankin will assist the Chancellor and handle affairs that
do not require the Chancellor’s personal supervision.

These are the men who are working to make our school
an even better one than it already is. These are the men
who are attempting to fulﬁll the dreams of all who have
represented Pitt in the past and in the present. These are
the men who must guide us through a period destined to
be the most dynamic and successful in the University’s
170 year history.

ALPHA KAPPA
ALPHA

Alpha Kappa Alpha came far during the past year

in the accomplishment of its dual purpose of
maintaining high scholarship and keeping alive an
interest in college life among the alumnae and
other community members.

Foremost on the list of last year’s AKA activ-
ities was their contribution of gifts to Veteran’s
Hospital. Their many social affairs included a

‘barn dance and a talent show.

Iota Chapter, since its founding in 1918, has
constantly striven toward a goal of service to the
University. It is well represented in several of the
campus activities. The various vocal groups claim
several members of Alpha Kappa Alpha, including
Joanne Snyder, the president of the Chapter, who
serves as the social chairman of Women’s Choral.

Other oﬂicers of the group include Barbara

ALPHA PHI ALPHA

Alpha Phi Alpha grew out of a literary and social
study club, and still adheres strictly to these
ideals. Any skeptical readers are invited to Visit
the AIpha’s sprawling residence on Centre Avenue
and prove this for themselves.

Here they will ﬁnd students known for their
high scholastic and moral standards preparing
arduous y for their next social study—wl1 ch
could quite possibly be the Alpha’s Autumn Hop.
At these events the Alphas can observe society in
all of its various phases—~—or so they say. Some
sorority girls doubt this. They think it’s just a
gag to get girls hopping around raking leaves off
the Alpha’s huge lawn. They do concede, how-
ever, that it’s a lot of fun—and the boys say it's a
valuable experiment for the beneﬁt of society. All
we can say is that there are few better kept lawns
on Centre Avenue.

DELTA SIGMA
THETA

To celebrate the beginning of the 1956 football
season, the Delta Sigma Thetas sponsored their
first event of the school year, the annual Pig-Skin
Punt. This was just one of the many events which
President Lillian Warren and her ofﬁcers had
planned for the year. Others included the annual
Delta Sigma Theta weekend which featured a tea
and a dance for the members and their dates, and
also a party for the sisters who lived out of town.
During the Christmas season, they participated
in a candlelight soiree, and in the Spring, they
held their annual formal.

As special projects, the Delta Sigma T hetas
held a job opportunities forum to offer adjustive
aid to teenagers of this area and also gave schol-
arships to deserving members.

This past Summer, for the second year in a row,
the Delta Sigma Thetas placed second in the

LAMBDA CHI ALPHA

One thing Lambda Chi Alpha will never have to
worry about is alumni. They are the largest national
social fraternity in the nation, and the local Gamma
Epsilon chapter ﬁnd that they run into brothers
wherever they go.

On the local level, the Lambda Chis treat or-

iphans to an annual football game, hold a dinner

dance at Colonial Manor, and stage a F ounder’s
Day Banquet each spring.

In the last few semesters the Lambda Chis have
greatly increased their membership and are in line
for an award from their national office for this
achievement.

The Lambda Chis have such assets as a new
house and Bob Pollock to impress rushees. Add to
this “a good social life, a solid brotherhood, and a
building of men” and you have the story of Lambda
Chi Alpha’s success.

PHI SIGMA SIGMA

As one of their first projects of the year, the Phi
Sigma Sigmas put on their blue jeans and joined
with Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority to sponsor a
barn dance. To round out their social program,
the sorority held a brides’ tea to honor recent
brides in the chapter, a Winter formal, and
monthly dinners which ‘the girls cooked them-
selves in their apartment.

To raise money for their national philanthropy
the Phi Sigma Sigmas washed cars and held a
rummage sale. Not to be outdone by the actives
in helping others, the pledges dyed Easter eggs
for Children s Hospital.

Many members brought honor to the chapter
through their activities at the University. This

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

The Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter at Pitt was re-
activated only eight years ago, but they have
taken ﬁrm hold and are a rapidly growing and
progressive organization.

This year the Sigma Phis played host to chap-
ters of their fraternity from most of Pennsylvania,
Ohio, and West Virginia in the annual district
basketball convention.

The SPEs achieved one of their fullest seasons
this year, as they sponsored numerous tea dances,
unique house parties, several smorgasbords, and
an annual Spring formal, highlighted by the
crowning of their sweetheart.

Most of this past year was spent remodeling
their recently acquired house on Forbes Street.
In spare moments the fellows managed to compete
in intramurals and hold an orphan’s party.

SIGMA PI

Although the Sigma Pi fraternity is thesecond oldest fraternity
west of the Ohio River, it is a relative newcomer to Pitt, being
reactivated in 1948,

However, in the last several semesters hard rushing has been
the keynote, and they have risen to a place of prominence among
local fraternities.

In line with this growth, the chapter house has not been neg-
lected. Last year the interior was repainted, and the adjoining
parking lot enlarged.

The social program has also been expanded and includes such
events as a Homecoming affair, an Alumni Banquet, an annual
Cellar-Dwellers party, and a two day long Orchid Ball in the Oﬂicers: Max Kumer, alumni corresponding secretary; John Kinkle, _

THETA CHI

 

Oﬂicers: Ronald Mould, corresponding secretary; Denis Lichtrnan, vice
president; Robert McCabe, president; Don Matthews, pledge master;
William Patterson, recording secretary; Robert Morley, treasurer.

There is no doubt that Theta Chi was the best known fraternity in England last
year. Their president, Bob McCabe, was the S Award winner, and spent the sum-
mer studying at Oxford.

With their Bayard Street house now refurnished and redecorated, they were in a
position to hold a number of parties—and they made the most of this opportunity.
Among the affairs were dinners, numerous dances, and a hypnotist show.

This year is the one hundredth anniversary of Theta Chi’s founding and the
local chapter is endeavoring now more than ever to carry out the aim of the fra-
ternity—to provide a social life on campus, to bring men of high caliber into a
brotherhood of friendship, and to help the student scholastically.

Their members feel that these aims are being attained—and not when they were
under the inﬂuence of a hypnotist, either.

Ronald Mould and Bill Patterson check frat mailing list as Jan Crail looks
on. That’s Don Mathews in the background.

GIRLS IN THE SHADOW OF A CLOUD

Walk on the holy earth.
Breathe of the sacred air.
Stare at the wonder of light.
The cauliﬂower cloud

Roars into columned white
Above reﬂecting seas,

Less dazzling than the birth
Of Aphrodite as

A knock-kneed naked girl,
With blowing taffy hair,
Standing upon a shell—
Wind kissed and proud,

As though her nakedness was
An unencumbered pearl

For some sure love to wear.
Now time delivers these
Clothed shapes of girls, to tell
That living and love outlast
The strontium cloud, the atom blast.

The "New Era” marks expansion of Pitt’s physical dimensions as can be seen in this air view of the University’s Medical Center, most
rapidly advancing area on the campus. In the foreground Pitt's Graduate School of Public Health, still under construction, is surrounded
by DeSoto Hall, Nurse’s Residence, Children’s Hospital, Presbyterian Hospital, School of Health Professions, and Western Psychiatric

Institute and Clinic.

PITT TAKES ON NEW DIMENSIONS

One hundred and seventy years ago the people of Pitts-
burgh embarked upon a "New Era”—an era dedicated to
providing higher education to the people of the Pittsburgh
district. The ﬁrst efforts of these early settlers led by Hugh
Henry Brackenridge was the founding of the log Academy
in the Pittsburgh of 1787. This was the beginning——the
start of the era. From the Academy has evolved the Uni-
versity we know today.

But it wasn’t that simple. In the 1790’s a new Academy,
a two-story brick building, was erected next to the log
house on the lot at Third and Cherry Alley. Then, by 1819,
another kind of expansion became necessary. Academy-
trained men had to go away from Pittsburgh to univer-
sities in the East to continue their educations. The city,
now numbering 7,000 people, sought and received in

10

February, 1819, the charter of the Western University of
Pennsylvania.

Twice the University was destroyed by ﬁre, in 1845 and
again in 1849, and each time the people of Pittsburgh
rallied to its aid and rebuilt it. When it outgrew its few
buildings in Old Allegheny, the University was moved
back across the river to a pasture in Oakland where, in
1908, it became the University of Pittsburgh.

In the 1920’s and 1930’s the citizens of this industrial
community were again called upon to aid their University.
The nearly ten thousand students enrolled in 1924 and the
certainty of increasing enrollment showed a need for ex-
pansion. The University’s Chancellor, John Gabbert
Bowman, convinced the people of Pittsburgh that new
buildings must provide, in addition to space, beauty and

WHAT IS A
FRATERNITY
SWEETHEART ?

What is a fraternity sweetheart? To the casual observer
she is a pretty girl whose picture adorns some fraternity’s
page in a yearbook. But what is beneath the surface; what
makes her a sweetheart? The Owl had some ideas, but not
the answer. To ﬁnd out, we went to the men who should
most logically know-—the presidents of the fraternities.
All of them had different ideas about what a sweetheart is,
but from the jumble of opinions we began to understand.

To start off with, Delta Sigma Phi’s John Hodak felt:

"In her, all the brothers see those ﬁne
qualities they attribute to their own
sweethearts.”

We had our ﬁrst clue. She is a girl that you can compare
favorably with your own. She is a good dancer, but not a
showoff. Her dress is neat at all times, but never gaudy.
She makes you grudgingly envy her boy friend, while at
the same time, proudly aware that she is a friend of yours.
A hazy outline was being formed.

At the Delta Tau Delta house, Lynn Watson said:

"A girl chosen for public relations work.”

Now her association with the fraternity became clear.
She is the girl that others associate with the fraternity;
the better the impression she makes, the better the fra-
ternity looks. She is the girl that can act as the perfect
hostess for the fraternity. At rushing events she makes it
a point to meet all the rushees and their dates and make
them feel at ease. She is, in effect, a window into the fra-
ternity——she can help to direct favorable opinion of others
toward the fraternity. She was taking deﬁnite form now;
only one small feature was missing.

Mike Underwood of Phi Gamma Delta supplied the
answer. He said simply:

"She’s a girl that’s one of the boys.”

She is the kind of girl who keeps a party alive without
having to make a fool of herself. She boosts morale after
a defeat and sincerely compliments all concerned after a
victory. She is a good shoulder to cry on. You watch your
language around her, of course, but you are never uncom-
fortable in her presence.

Now the picture was clear. We knew what a fraternity
sweetheart was: now the question was, Who is she? She is
the girl next door, the girl in the pew in front of you in
church, the girl cheering behind you at the football game.
She is the girl on the following pages . . .

performance worthy of a great university. Thus, a Gothic
skyscraper—which was as revolutionary to architecture
as to education—was designed. The people and corpora-
tions of this community donated over eight-million
dollars—much of it in the midst of this country’s severest
depression—to build the beautiful Cathedral of Learning.
This, they thought, would satisfy the educational needs of
the district for many future years. "The Cathedral of
Learning is not a revolution but a conclusion,” stated the
1929 Owl. But it wasn°t a conclusion. It was just another
step, although a very large step, in the continuation of the
era that had started 140 years before.

In the past few years the need for physical expansion
has again become evident. New buildings, particularly to
house students of the medical professions, have sprung up
all over the Oakland campus. Just this year two new
buildings—George Hubbard Clapp Hall and The School
of Health Professions—have opened their doors to students
for the first time and the Graduate School of Public

Health is under construction.
In conjunction with this constructional expansion the

University has acquired other valuable property through
purchases and gifts. Among the purchases are the lux-
urious Schenley Hotel and Apartments. The hotel, serving

Parking has always been a campus problem. With the construc-
tion of multi-ﬂoor parking garages in the near future the prob-
lem will be solved. However, the situation was lessened this year
with the opening of the new faculty parking lot (above).

Pitt students in the new School of the Health Professions didn’t
have to worry about catching an elevator; they used escalators.

AIR FORCE R.O.T.C.
With more and more stress being put on air power every day, it is little wonder that
the Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps has become one of the most modern
and fastest growing organizations at Pitt.
  The job of Air Force R.O.T.C. is to grant commissions to certain qualifying
cadets, and just as important, to train these cadets for the role of an officer.
  Juniors and seniors attend a four-week summer camp, where they actually tackle
the problems that will confront them upon entering the service.
  A.F.R.O.T.C. provides a number of activities for its cadets. Among them are:
Arnold Air Society for juniors and seniors, Sabre Air Command for freshmen and
sophomores, a trick drill team, a rifle team, and along with Army R.O.T.C., the
Pershing Rifles.
  On the social side, A.F.R.O.T.C. joins up with the Army to hold a Military Ball
each Spring.
Attention is called as Cadet Lieutenant Colonels Jack Tolochko
and John Powell inspect their
troops.
The Air Force Cadet Staff were pleased with the Fall drill program.
This formation of cadets on the University campus is a familiar scene to all.

ARMY R.O.T.C.
The Army Reserve Officers Training Corps deals
with the training of officers for the Army of the
United States. The present curriculum, which is
designed for overall military service, is not
pointed toward any particular type or branch of
the service.
  Practical field training is accomplished in a
six-week summer camp integrated into the overall
program between the junior and senior years.
  The Army R.O.T.C. is primarily interested in
developing habits and traits of leadership and the
qualities of discipline and initiative so necessary
in times of emergency. Pershing Rifles, Scabbard
and Blade, and the Army Cadet Association are
organizations for further development.
  The Military Ball held every Spring in conjunction with the Air Force R.O.T.C. is the social
highlight of the year for Army R.O.T.C.

largest dental frat
PSI OMEGA
Psi Omega, largest national dental fraternity, was founded in
1892 at the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. The central
office is located in the Tri-State district at Weirton, West Virginia.
  The specific aims and purposes of the organization are to cultivate the social qualities of its members, to secure benefits out
of the individual's reach, and to exert influence for the advancement of the dental profession.
  Members may be tapped after satisfactory completion of one
semester in the School of Dentistry.
  High spots on the social calendar include a Christmas formal
and a Spring formal, which marks the end of both the school
and social year.
  The Psi Omegas take part in many drives for charity, including an orphan's Christmas party.
Tom Dudas is about to sink the eight ball.
Tom Campbell, Sam Kerr, and John Vancheri seem to be having fun at Sherwood Wolfson's expense.

elementary educators
APHA BETA GAMMA
The latest trends in teaching in the elementary
school are tamiliar to every member of Alpha
Beta Gamma. Through student-faculty panels,
the members of this sorority become acquainted
with contemporary methods of instruction. Movies from the Pennsylvania School for the Blind
are also of interest to the group.
  Founded at Pitt, in 1939, this local sorority
has many worthwhile projects throughout the
year. A teachers' placement bureau, a forum for
foreign exchange students, and an annual banquet
in the Spring are a part of the sorority's program
which is designed to foster cooperation and friendship betxween students and faculty. Field trips
and other special events under the direction of
their advisors, Dr. Blanche Jefferson, Dr. June
Mulry, Dr. Maxine Gray, and Dr. Dorothy McMurry are arranged periodically to establish
unity among elementary education students.

business researchers
ALPHA KAPPA PSI
All students majoring in business administration
at Pitt are eligible for membership in Alpha Kappa
Psi, the professional business administration fraternity.
  Alpha Kappa Psi aims to further the individual
welfare of its members and to foster scientific research in the fields of commerce, accounts, and
finance. It also strives to educate the public to
appreciate and demand higher ideals in the field
of business administration.
  The Delta chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi at Pitt
goes a long way towards fulfilling these aims, but
they also manage to fulfill the social desires of
their members. They hold a semi-annual pledge
dance, banquets, and smokers in addition to
sponsoring a booth at Spring Carnival.
  Alpha Kappa Psi also awards a scholarship key
to the senior in business administration who attains the top ranking in his class.
   A group of Alpha Kappa Psis enjoy a card game in the kitchen.

Alpha Omega, national dental fraternity, is especially proud of their scholastic ranking. Since 1952
their group has maintained the highest fraternity
scholastic average.
  Even though this is true, the organization is
far from being one-sided. Besides numerous parties
and minor social affairs, they sponsor an annual
alumni and senior dinner dance.
  The guiding factor behind Alpha Omega is the
wish to promote the ideals of professionalism,
Judaism, and fraternalism among dental students
of Jewish faith.
  At the present time the AOs are engaged in a
fund raising drive. They are working to collect
one thousand dollars for a new dental school established in Israel.

ALPHA ZETA
OMEGA
The local chapter of Alpha Zeta Omega is undoubtedly the most active branch in the country.
In the last three years the locals have been
awarded the Directorum Cup, symbolic of the
most active and outstanding chapter, from their
national headquarters. In addition to this honor,
they were awarded a cup for the best chapter
newspaper.
  The purpose of the organization is to promote
and advance the aims of pharmacy. In line with
this, the Alpha Zeta Omegas are in the midst of a
fund raising drive to support a new pharmacy
school in Israel.
  A pharmacy student must maintain at least a
1.5 Q.P.A. in order to be qualified for membership.
             This group of AZOs admire the new School
             of the Health Professions.
The Alpha Zeta Omegas are often seen taking a break at the soda fountain between classes.

    tomorrow's pharmacists
    AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION
Students enrolled in the Pitt Pharmacy school                                                                      _
have the opportunity of joining the American
Pharmaceutical Association-and, by doing so,
have the opportunity to help improve and better
pharmacy as a profession.
  The members of the association strive mainly
to acquaint outsiders with the details and intricacies of the profession. Too many people, they
contend, think of pharmacists as doing nothing
but counting pills. In an effort to enlighten the
public to the humanitarian duties of the pharmacist, the association sets up displays showing the
various phases of the profession.
  The association also invites speakers from leading drug companies to talk to their members about
opportunities in the field. The members of the
association know the prescription for enjoyment

A.S.C.L.
The American Society of Civil Engineers is one organization on campus that never
complains of having difficulty in obtaining new members -all junior and seniors in
civil engineering are required to join. Nevertheless the popularity of the group is
shown by the large number of underclassmen -who are not required to joinamong its members.
  A.S.C.E. v,orks to develop well rounded engineers and to give their members
additional practical and theoretical knoM ledge that they would otherwise not have
the opportunity to obtain. To fulfill this aim they bring in guest speakers who have
attained great heights in their profession to share their experiences with the student
members.
  Spaghetti dinners, a senior banquet, and field trips to various points of interest
were also on the A.S.C.E. agenda this year.

across the street, past Masonic Temple, to Clapp Hall, was
tread by many students.

Students of the natural sciences attended many lectures in Clapp
Hall’s spacious auditorium. '

The first room open to student use in the newly acquired Schenley
Hotel was the Hunt Boom. Here students gathered for "small

Army R.O.T.C. believes that a student involved
in its program carry his interest in R.O.T.C. outside the classroom as well as in it. The Army Cadet
Association helps to accomplish this goal.
  The association was installed at Pitt when the
general military science program replaced the
quartermaster corps this year. In order to be
eligible for membership, the future Army officer
must be in advanced R.O.T.C.
  This year the association put on a campaign to
raise funds for the United States Olympic team
and also held a Christmas toy drive for orphans.
One of their most successful projects was a parents' night which brought together the parents of
freshman and sophomore R.O.T.C. students at
Ellsworth Center.

international dental practitioners
DELTA SIGMA DELTA
Delta Sigma Delta, comprised of students and
practitioners of dentistry, takes pride in being
the only international dentistry fraternity in
existence.
  The specific aim and purpose of the group is
to raise the standards of dentistry by inculcating
in the minds of dental students and practitioners
a spirit of fraternal cooperation toward scientific,
ethical, and professional progress.
  Undergraduate membership is limited to dental
students in good class standing and not holding
membership in any other dental fraternity.
  Socially, the DSDs highlight their program
with a Christmas and Spring formal. During the
year they manage to hold a party on the average
of once every two weeks. In this way they blend
the concentrated study of dental school with a
certain amount of fun.

for men in education
KAPPA PHI KAPPA
The male view on education is very sound as seen
through the eyes of Kappa Phi Kappa, national
education fraternity for men. This organization
founded on Pitt's campus in 1926 encourages men
of sound moral character and recognized ability
to engage in the study of educational problems.
  Kappa Phi Kappa accepts into its fold any
male in the undergraduate school of education.
All of its members must maintain a high scholastic rating in accordance with the professional
field they have chosen.
  This year the men of Kappa Phi Kappa have
given to their educational peers a curriculum library. This library will be of service to all those
enrolled in the field of education.
  Kappa Phi Kappa also believes in play, for
each year it holds several smokers as well as other
outstanding social events.

KAPPA PSI
Since its beginning at Pitt in 1913, Kappa Psi, national professional pharmacy fraternity, has endeavored to advance fraternalism   and professionalism among pharmacy students.
  An overall Q.P.A. of 1.5 and one full semester
in the Pharmacy school are the basic requirements
for membership.
  Two awards are given each year fo deserving
individuals of Kappa Psi. These are the Ray
Kelly Scholarship Award of $500 and the Alvin
J. Vavro Award worth $25. The winners of these
are chosen by a committee comprised of the dean
of the school, faculty members, and charter members.                                                                                                            f

PHI DELTA CHI
Any male student in pharmacy school who is able
to maintain a 1.5 Q.P.A. is eligible for admission
to the local branch of Phi Delta Chi, national
pharmaceutical fraternity.
  Phi Delta Chi exists with two purposes in mind.
First, to advance the science of pharmacy and
second, to promote a fraternal spirit among its
members.
  Each year Phi Delta Chi supports the local
charities such as the Pitt Chest.
  To balance their program, they sponsor a number of mixer dances with student nurses and a
Spring and Fall smoker to tap new members. The
social season is highlighted by two Spring affairs,
an alumni banquet, and a dinner dance.
  Phi Delta Chi is a good example of how fraternal spirit and professional pride can mix.

phys ed majors
PHYSICAL
EDUCATION CLUB
In 1954 the men in the physical education department decided to declare their independence
from the women and form their own branch.
Through a series of planned professional and
social events, the men have strived to promote
an interest in the field of physical education.
  The organization originated in 1939 and has
been active on Pitt's campus since. Previously,
it had opened its membership to both men and
women. The group has the distinction of being
the only one of its kind in this area. Any male in
the physical education department is qualified
for membership and since its start every man has
joined.
  The men have proved that socially they are
quite adept. Their Christmas party last year was
a huge success. In the Spring of the year, the men
escort females to the traditional semi-formal
dance.

PRE-SOCIAL WORK CLUB
        Although the Pre-Social Work Club was founded
        at Pitt only two years ago, it is rapidly becoming
        one of the sturdiest organizations on campus.
        Membership in the club is open to students who
        have a genuine interest in social work and who
        have maintained a "C" average in their scholastic
        work.

  Each year the Pre-Social Work Club sponsors

in the field. Participants at the conclave also
visit various welfare agencies and attend a dinner
at which top men in social work are the featured
speakers.

          Sigma Theta Tau, national honorary society for
          nursing, strives to foster high professional stand          ards and to promote the spirit of fellowship among
          its members.
            Nursing students who have demonstrated qual          ities of leadership and who have maintained a
          better than two-point scholastic average are qual          ified for membership.
            Each year Sigma Theta Tau awards a full tu          ition scholarship to a deserving student in the
          School of Nursing. In addition, they give a fifty          dollar award on Scholar's Day to the outstanding
          senior graduating from either the basic or ad          vanced professional program in the School of
          Nursing.
            Through creative work in nursing, the society
          works to increase the student's capacity to serve
          his profession and develop an abiding interest in
          the advancement of nursing.

as a student union, will house the Deans of Men and
Women and most of the student activities. The apart-
ments will provide living space for 1200 students, including
a proposed sorority and fraternity row. Another recent
acquisition was the Hubbard Reservation in North Park
which will be used for student indoor and outdoor recre-
ational and athletic events and for nature and scientiﬁc
class studies.

All of this physical expansion is a necessary part of the
continuation of the era that began with the Pittsburgh
Academy; but Pitt is also expanding in other ways. Lead-
ing Pitt into this "New Era” of many-fold expansion is
Dr. Edward H. Litchﬁeld, newly appointed chancellor of
the University. Chancellor Litchﬁeld has been allocated
more than one-hundred million dollars of working capital
to reorganize Pitt’s educational system and eventually
place Pitt among the foremost universities of the World.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld has concentrated his efforts on
the University as a whole and on each of the various de-
partments within the University in his efforts to achieve
this goal. Salaries of all faculty members have been raised
to keep top men from migrating to greener pastures and
also to lure men of proven ability in all ﬁelds to Pitt.
Entrance exams have been stiffened to make. the caliber
of the average Pitt student much higher than it has been
in the past. This, along with the greater inﬂux of students
from outside the Pittsburgh area now that adequate dor-
mitory space is available, will give us a more cosmopolitan
student; a student ﬁtted for leadership in a smaller world.

New ﬁelds of study, such as the training of men for gov-
ernmental work, the department of Far Eastern Studies.
and courses in television techniques have cut across subject
areas. A common core of knowledge is needed by both the
engineer and the liberal arts student. Dr. Litchﬁeld him-
self has said: "The tendency in most universities is toward
autonomy in the various colleges, such as engineering,
law, arts, and so on. I want Pitt to be an organic whole, a
university in the older sense, with joint faculty appoint-
ments, so that the student’s education is a rounded one.”

This physical and educational expansion is not a new
policy at Pitt. It is just another example of a dynamic new
administration continuing the work outlined by its pred-
ecessors and interjecting new ideas along with the old. In
this way the university has avoided the one pitfall that
most great nations and institutions of the past fell victim
to—~stagnation.

Since its beginning in 1787 Pitt’s administrators have
worked to bring its founder’s hopes to fulﬁllment. Several
times during this long span of years there were opportuni-
ties to relax their efforts and to gaze contentedly upon the
results of their labors. Especially was this true after the
completion of the Cathedral of Learning. But, fortunately,
each new administration, perhaps thinking of decadent
Greece and Rome, chose to look to the future rather than
to any Golden Age of the past. Each new administration
strove for a goal they knew could never be attained—
perfection in education—~and in striving, gained a large
measure of that goal.

In May of this year a new administration headed by Dr.
Litchﬁeld will officially be inaugurated as the leaders of
the University. Although the ceremonies will be impressive
and great men in all ﬁelds of learning will watch the In-
auguration with utmost interest, it will be in a sense anti-
climactic. The Inauguration will take place more than a

. year after the administration has begun its job—the job
‘of continuing the era that started 170 years ago.

Dr. Jonas $alk,_ victorious in his battle against polio, brought

nursing fellowship
ALPHA TAU DELTA
Alpha Tau Delta, national social fraternity for women in a
degree-program of nursing, aims to foster friendship and fellowship among college women in the nursing profession.
  Alpha Tau Delta held their first meeting on February, 1921,
on the University of California campus. The first chapter was
called "Lady of the Lamp" in honor of Florence Nightingale.
There are now twelve chapters in the United States.
  Their most recent project was selling "Little Christmas
Town" put out by the National League for Epilepsy to raise
money for research and treatment of this illness.
  Members must be either graduate nurses working toward
their degree or students in a college program working for the
bachelor of science degree in nursing with a high "C" average.

electrical engineers
A.I.E.E.
Since 1915 the American Institute of Electrical Engineers has
been an active organization at the University of Pittsburgh. The
aims of the group are to promote the field of electrical engineering and to keep those in the course of study aware of the newest
developments arising. The seminar has maintained these goals
since its founding.
  Due to the value of the seminars, the School of Engineering
automatically recognizes undergraduate members of the school
as a part of the group.
  This past year the regional convention was held at Lafayette
College. At the convention an award is given to the outstanding
undergraduate electrical engineer in this area.
  An annual social event of the A.I.E.E. is the formal dinner
dance during Engineer's Week. At this affair the men have an
opportunity to become acquainted with each other socially as
well as professionally.
foster interest in chemistry
AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
Any student at the University who is interested
in chemistry is eligible to become a member of the
American   Chemical Society, an   organization
which strives to foster and promote an interest in
chemistry among undergraduates.
  Members hear famous lecturers in the field of
chemistry-complete with involved demonstrations-as well as conduct experiments themselves
at the society's meetings. They also tour chemical plants and experimental labs.
  Several joint meetings with other A.C.S. chapters occur throughout the year. At these meetings
the students have the opportunity to compare
their views and thoughts with members from
other universities and in this way broaden their
scope of learning.
  The fact that the University is still standing is
evidence that the society also stresses safety.
FRONT: G. Haberland, J. Burke. BACK ROW: IH.

(president), R. Wiley, R. Cerutti (vice president).
Each week every student enrolled as a chemical
engineer has an opportunity to attend the meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. This organization strives to teach future
chemical engineers the advantages this course of
study offers.
  During the year the association was busy planning, along with its brother organization at Carnegie Tech, the annual student convention.
  In the past year A.I.CH.E. managed to winfor the  second  straight year-the   Shamrock
Award. This award is given to the organization
in the School of Engineering which presents the
best displays during the annual Engineer's Week
in the Spring.
  All social events are held in conjunction with
the Engineering and Mines school. This includes
dances and smokers.

mechanical engineers
A.S.M.E.
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers aims for professional development and fellowship among undergraduate
mechanical engineering students. The A.S.M.E. chapter at
Pitt has achieved distinction in both departments of this aim.
  Throughout the school year student paper competitions are
held. This enables the members to express their individual views
on subjects of current importance in their field. Many of the
meetings are devoted to technical studies and trips are taken
to various places of interest. Through these varied activities,
the members are given an insight into their chosen profession.
  Several social functions during the year, including dinners
and group smokers, provide the members an opportunity to
develop the fellowship they aim for.

preparatory for nursing
IDAKA
Probably to promote a better "bedside manner," the keynote
of the local pre-nursing sorority, better known as Idaka, is fellowship.
  This group attempts to better acquaint its members with the
nursing profession through interviews and visits to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
  Idaka was founded in 1939 and by May, 1942, when by-laws
were drawn up and approved by the committee on recognition
for women, it became formally recognized on campus.
  Membership in Idaka is limited to those in pre-nursing, having a minimum of fourteen credits, and with at least a 1.0 Q.P.A.
  The Idaka social program includes such affairs as an October
open house, a parent's tea given in March, and an annual Christmas party.
                                                                                 aeronautical engineers

 or aerodynamics have the opportunity to become                                  L         *
 members of the Institute of Aeronautical Sci ences. At present the I.A.S. at Pitt is relatively
 small, but it is rapidly growing into a strong engi neering group.
   The institute's main purpose is to develop an
 interest in aeronautical science among engineering
 students. To do this they sponsor field trips to
 various aeronautical labs, such as the Lewis Lab oratory in Cleveland, and bring in top speakers
 in the field.
   The Pitt branch of I.A.S. is in the process of
completing an NACA development library and
is constructing a wind tunnel to further their experiments in aerodynamics.
   Socially the members of I.A.S. fly high too.
They hold a picnic, dinner, and cider and doughnut affairs during the course of the year.

In 1949 a group known as the Institute of Radio
Engineers was chartered at the University of
Pittsburgh. Because of the avid interest in the:y
radio side of electronics, the club prospered and
today is one of the most active organizations in
the Engineering school. The group is a part of a
national association which cites as its main goal
the advancement of radio electronics to electrical
engineering students.
  Since its founding on Pitt campus, I.R.E. has
become an integral part of engineering activities.
During the annual Engineer's Week, many of its
projects are displayed. The organization sponsors the Student Radio Club for any interested
persons.
  The outstanding social event of the season for
I.R.E. is the banquet held in honor of the graduating seniors. This.affair is held jointly with the

The organization with the loftiest aims on campus
is quite possibly the American Road Builders Association. The A.R.B.A. aims to promote interest,
study and discussion of all subjects related to
design, construction, maintenance, and administration of streets and highways including traffic
control.
   The A.R.B.A. also studies and discusses city
 and regional planning and helps its graduating
 members find engineering positions by keeping in
 constant contact with men in the profession.
   Second semester sophomores, juniors, and sen iors majoring in civil engineering are eligible for
 membership in the A.R.B.A.

 Automotive Engineers    a group   which   exists
 primarily to better the design and quality of auto motive materials, and in this way to continually
 aid the American public.
 The student chapter of S.A.E. at Pitt attempts
 to acquaint prospective automotive engineers of
 the services the society does, and in this method
make its members more conscious of their responsibilities as engineers.
  This year Pitt's S.A.E. is planning a racer to be

HONORARIES
The Inauguration of a New Era. This phrase presents a challenge to the young men and women who are members of the
leadership societies on this campus. The University of Pittsburgh has great plans for the future. These will encompass
physical growth, plans for the expansion of the curriculum, and
an even stronger faculty. Along with these must be plans for
the improvement and growth in the student life and activities
on the campus. From the hearts and minds of those in the leadership societies will come the suggestions and ideas for this
growth in student affairs.

future accountants
BETA ALPHA PSI
Accounting majors who have maintained a 2.0 accounting average and a 1.8 Q.P.A. overall are eligible for membership in
Beta Alpha Psi, national honorary fraternity.
  The prime purpose of this organization is to promote the
study of accounting and to act as a medium between the students, instructors, and professional men interested in the accounting field. It also attempts to foster the spirit of pride in
the high scholastic and the professional standards established
and maintained by its members.
  Here is stressed the importance of the ideal of service as the
basis for the accounting profession. This ideal is perpetuated by
the new initiates who are first made familiar with the aims of
the honorary through the solemn ceremonies of taking the new
vows.
  Interspersed among the formal meetings are some informal
gatherings and a number of social events. By working towards
a common goal, the group has progressed to the culmination of
another successful year.                                       A new initiate meets the president.

SCABBARD AND BLADE
Outstanding Army R.O.T.C. students at Pitt are
rewarded  with  membership in   Scabbard  and
Blade, an honorary military fraternity for advanced cadets.
  The purposes of Scabbard and Blade are threefold-to raise the standard of military education
in the University, to encourage and foster the
qualities which are essential to a good, efficieni
officer, and to promote a spirit of friendship and
good fellowship among the cadets.
  Throughout the year members of Scabbard
and Blade perform services to the University.
Among these services was the operation of an information booth for West Point cadets at the
Pitt-Army game and the furnishing of members
to act as aides for the military dance following
the game.
  A quality point average of at least 2.0 in
R.O.T.C. courses is required for membership.

Sigma Gamma Epsilon, the national earth science
fraternity, has two aims. The first is the scholastic, scientific, and social advancement of its members. The organization sponsors seminars in mining, geology, and petroleum engineering, which
help to fulfill that purpose. Another project of the
group is counseling scout troops.
  Extension of relations and assistance among
universities and scientific schools which are devoted to the advancement of earth sciences is
Sigma Gamma Epsilon's second aim.
  This Fall plans were being made to hold the
national convention of Sigma Gamma Epsilon in
Pittsburgh in 1957.
  Any male student who is a major in one of the
earth sciences and has a 2.0 quality point average
is eligible for membership in Sigma Gamma Epsilon.

To stimulate interest and encourage achievement
in the study of foreign languages are the objectives of Sigma Kappa Phi, the national honorary
foreign language fraternity.
  The organization is open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors who have completed either sixteen credits in one language or who have satisfactorily completed an advanced course in their
major language. Prospective members must also
have an overall 2.0 quality point average and a
2.0 Q.P.A. in their qualifying language.
  Through social and academic meetings the fraternity helps students to gain a better understanding and appreciation of both ancient and
modern languages and the literature written in
these tongues.
  Highlighting Sigma Kappa Phi's social agenda
this year was the annual Christmas open house.

RELIGION
Gratefully mindful of all who have made possible our beloved
University, and thankful for Chancellor Litchfield and his colleagues, we welcome the "New Era!"
   More than ever we are resolved to find in religious experience
the knowledge and skills that will enable us to live more worthily and usefully.
   Taking advantage of the new courses in religion, getting ac quainted with the University Chaplain and his colleagues, iden tifying ourselves with a religious fellowship, attending the Uni versity Services of Worship in Heinz Chapel, we will strive, in
 and out of our classes, to press on toward the stature of God's
 will for us.
   We thank the OWL for the following pages!

Y.M.C.A.
This year the Young Men's Christian Association
celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding
on the Pitt campus. This very active organization
was founded in 1907 in order to help students discover and accept the full meaning of Christian
fellowship in their own lives and in society
through a variety of religious, educational, and
social programs. Any male student who supports
this aim is qualified for membership.
  Through its activities, which include monthly
association  nites, inter-collegiate conferences,
Bible study groups, student-faculty coffee hours,
intramural sports, and the sponsorship of Freshman Camp, United Nations Week, Political Week,
and community service projects, the association
provides many opportunities for leadership experience.
  The Y.M.C.A. does much of its work with the
Y.W.C.A. and many of its social affairs, such as
the Fall jamboree and square dance, are held with
that group.
Bill Jones, Al Louden, executive secretary, Bill Kelly, and Christ Christ enjoy a committee planning session.

HILLEL FOUNDATION
  The television set, library, phonograph, and mag  azine collection aren't the only things that keep a
  steady stream of students flowing in and out of the
  Hillel Foundation's student lounge in theY.M.H.A.
  building. Here is a place where any student.
  but particularly students of the Jewish faith,
can fulfill their spiritual, religious, cultural, and
educational needs. The Foundation also strives
to foster interfaith programs and relationships
on campus and to offer counseling and guidance
to all students.
  To achieve these aims the Foundation, under
the direction of Dr. Henry A. Fischel, holds forums, panels, and lectures in important contemporary issues and classes in the history and meaning of Judaism. Hillel also actively participates in
the celebration of Jewish holidays and community welfare projects.
An interested audience observes the provocative panel discussion.

          LUTHERAN STUDENT ASSOCIATION
A Tuesday evening rally, consisting of faith, food,
and fellowship, was the highlight of the Lutheran
Student Association social season.
  Any student of a local college who has a sincere
interest in promoting the Christian Gospel to the
academic community is eligible for membership.
  Besides the Tuesday rally, the Association
sponsored a progressive dinner, swimming parties,
and weekend retreats to create a balance between
social life and worship services.
  During Bible study classes and group religious
discussions, different views and opinions were presented and discussed by the members.
  As has been done previously, last year the group
conducted worship services for the patients at the
Passavant Hospital. These services were led by
pre-theological students in the Association.

NEWMAN CLUB
Pope Pius X once said "Where there are public
colleges and universities, let religious doctrine
classes be established for the purpose of teaching
the truths of our faith, and the precepts of Christian morality, to youths who attend such public
institutions." It is for this reason that the Newman Club was founded to offer Catholic students
the opportunity to strengthen themselves both
spiritually and socially in a healthy, wholesome
manner.
  The Newman Club holds theology classes, a
weekly rosary hour, and communion breakfasts.
They also sponsor what is perhaps the most active
social calendar on campus. They hold various
dances, both formal and informal, a Christmas
party, a Summer camping trip, and weekly open
house. In addition, to this, club members also participate in Pitt's intramural athletic leagues, publish a club newspaper, and maintain a house on
Craig Street.

PI THETA
In 1954, a few interested students with the aid of Chaplain
Emory Luccock organized Pi Theta. This pre-theological fraternity, which is open to students who are preparing to become
ministers, priests, or rabbis, was formed in order to establish
common ground for greater understanding and fellowship among
the different religious faiths.
   While Pi Theta does not emphasize the doctrinal differences
 of the faiths represented, each member of the organization
 learns to appreciate the aspirations of the other members and
 also gains a better perspective of his own faith. This knowledge
 of all the faiths comes from having prominent members of re ligious and theological institutions address the organization.
   One of this year's outstanding lectures was given in Novem ber by Reverend Charles Vogel, a United States Navy Chaplain.
John Smith calls a potential speaker for Pi Theta's next meeting.

STUDENT CHAPEL BOARD
Working closely with the Chaplain, the Student
Chapel Board strives to make the campus chapel
service of worship and the other varied uses of the
chapel an increasingly effective means of spiritual
emphasis on the University campus.
  Membership is composed of two representatives
from W.S.G.A., Men's Council, Heinz Chapel
Choir, Pi Theta, Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., and one
from each of the religious organizations.
  The most recent project has been a move to acquire better lighting facilities for the Chapel. The
Board also picks three charitable organizations to
receive Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter offerings.
  Each November the Chapel Board holds an
installation dinner, and marks the end of the
school year with a final banquet in late May.
  At the present time the Board is attempting to
secure a free hour during which all students can
take advantage of chapel services.

STUDENT COUNCIL OF
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS
The specific aim of the Pitt Student Council of
Religious Organizations is to promote awareness
of all the areas in which the effect of religion can
be noted, and to encourage the Pitt students to
think about these implications of religion.
  This organization was founded in the Fall of
1955 by a group of students representing the four
major faith groups and the eleven religious organizations on campus.
Marian Lazzo prepares to open a regular council meeting.
  Members are elected by individual religious
groups as representatives to Council. Their goal is
to co-ordinate the various activities of the religious groups on campus, and to provide the opportunity for college students to recognize the
many religious concerns at the University.
  An October weekend planning conference and a
discussion with the president of the Unitarian Association were two of their projects.
Officers: Dave Caird, vice president; Marian Lazzo, president;
Lowell Jackman, treasurer.

                            WESLEY FELLOWSHIP
The Wesley Fellowship of Pittsburgh, which is a
local branch of the nationwide Methodist Student
Movement, is defined as the Methodist church
following its students to the campus.
  The local group is made up of students of any
district college, or any other of that age group,
who are interested in taking part in the activities
of the organization.
  The specific purpose of the organization is to
develop and strengthen the Christian faith and to
prepare young people for future leadership in the
church.
  During the past year, the Fellowship sponsored
a Korean dinner, a Spring and Fall retreat, and a
fund raising drive for the library of the American
University in Alaska. On the social calendar were
included such events as skating and swimming
parties, hay rides, picnics, and cave exploring.
Officers: Jane Edmunds, recording secretary; John Tyler, treasurer; Frank Theodore, vice president; Jane Lucarell, corresponding secretary; Roy Oldham, adviser; August Pike, president.

  WESTMINSTER FOUNDATION
The members of Westminster Foundation are
mainly Presbyterians, United Presbyterians, Congregational Christians, and students belonging to
the Evangelical and Reformed churches. Membership, on the other hand, is open to all students
who are interested. Dinner meetings are held every
Tuesday.
  This organization obtained its charter in 1945,
acquiring its first full-time University pastordirector in 1950. Its present director is Reverend
E. Vincent Stratton, who came to Pitt in 1953.
There are 138 chapters on college campuses.
  Service and work projects, which are related to
needs abroad as well as at home, are conducted
regularly.
  The organization provides many social activities for its members, sponsoring such events as
swimming parties, retreats, and athletic events.

 Y.W.C.A.
 The purpose of the Young Women's Christian As sociation is to provide an opportunity for indi vidual growth in a Christian fellowship. Any wom an student who supports this aim is qualified for
membership.
  The organization   held  monthly   association
meetings, weekly religious discussions, studentfaculty discussions in neighborhood areas, and a
mid-semester weekend conference.
  Important projects of the Y.W.C.A. include
Caritas, the United Nations Week program, and.

“BACK TO SCHOOL"...I70TH OPENING

The cheerleaders and some students returned to school before classes began to
attend the West Virginia game at Morgantown.

 

18

Septemberéand for the 170th time the University
of Pittsburgh opened its doors for the beginning of
another school year.

As usual, registration#with its endless lines and
constant confusion—dominated the ﬁrst week
back. But endless lines did end—only to lead to
the book store and a mass crowding that deﬁed
even the formation of lines.

The Tuck Shops were open during registration
Week, and many students who grew tired of con-
stantly bucking lines and tracking down class
cards took advantage of the opportunity to cool
off with a coke and ﬁnd out how the Yanks and
Dodgers were doing in the Series.

With registration over and most of the needed
books already purchased, a large segment of the

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
                  In a large, complex university it is impossible for an elected
                  group to govern the others as a regulating, penalizing body. Our
                  size, the diversity of our interests, and the wide geographic area
                  in which we live, study, and play makes that too difficult. It is
                  also undesirable. Certainly the "New Era" at the University
                  calls for a more mature emphasis. The purpose of student gov                  ernment organizations is basically the same as that of the whole
                  University-the development of thinking, kindly, cultivated
                  men and women, capable of self-restraint, and able and willing
                  to contribute their unique capacities to the good of society. Only
                  through the realization of each of these objectives can the high                  est happiness come to a student during his University years and
                  throughout his life.
                  This concept imposes serious obligations on every student of
                  the University, not just on those selected as leaders of the gov                  ernment organizations.

pitt's best interests at heart
STUDENT CONGRESS
Pitt students can always look for leadership to Student
Congress, the co-educational student governing body,
whose membership is made up of representatives elected
by the entire student body.
  Congress studies the needs and interests of the students,
following up with programs to foster good will and constructive work together among the students of the University.
  Student Congress' ultimate goal was to make its students proud of Pitt. Planning such activities as all-University dances, pep rallies at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall, Spring Carnival, and the Homecoming celebrations
were some of the projects undertaken by the members of
this student governing body this year. The reorganization
of student government bodies was also on the Student
Congress agenda.
  Congress meetings were held each Monday.
At a Student Congress meeting new business comes up on the
agenda. Betty Chiapetta and Vivian Muncaster have motions to
bring to the floor.
Dave Bender, president, states the motion. Discussion is introduced. Tom Jenkins,
vice president, listens.
                                                    Secretary Judy Kirkpatrick, inscribes into the minutes a move to send the motion

              ENGINEERING AND MINES CABINET
Engineering and Mines Cabinet is an organization of engineering and mining students that provides social, cultural,
and intellectual activities for engineering students.
  The Cabinet guides the functioning of the Engineering
and Mines Association, an organization open to any student in the Schools of Engineering and Mines. Each class
of the nine engineering and mines departments selects a
representative to the Cabinet.
  These men seek to provide a complete calendar of social
functions for engineers. The group also serves to represent
student demands before the administration and to promote a closer union with the faculty.
  They sponsored two informal dances this year. The
Shamrock Ball held during Engineer's Week was the highlight of the social season.

 The purpose of the Interfraternity Council is to
 establish unity of spirit and action among frater nities and to promote the general welfare of the
 student body and University. To accomplish this
 end, I.F. sponsors athletic, social, and educational
 programs for the benefit of the entire University.
 Each fraternity is proportionally represented on
 Council according to its size of membership.
 Some recent projects were collecting canned
 goods for underprivileged persons, collecting
 money for muscular dystrophy, and sponsoring
 the "S" Award enabling a deserving Junior man
 to spend a summer studying in Europe.
 The Council's social affairs included the Inter fraternity Ball, Spring Carnival, and Greek Week

MEN'S CLASS OFFICERS
Men's Class Officers, comprised of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors from four different schools, represent an ideal
cross-section of the male student body.
  Membership is made up of a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and fifth man from each class in the College
and Schools of Business Administration and Engineering and
Mines, and the Junior and Senior class of the School of Education.
  This year, instead of a joint meeting, all four classes met
separately, with group meetings held to co-ordinate the various
activities.
   All four groups are bound together by a common aim. Each
 of them strives to unify the men in the various schools, help
 men students use the facilities and activities program of the
 University to best advantage, foster a continuing interest in the
 University, and promote in all ways the best interests of the
 student and the University.
 However, each had its particular projects and activities. The
 Seniors were particularly concerned with a choice of a class
 memorial gift to the University, and activities wise, sponsored
 the Christmas Commons Room Ball.
 The Juniors organized a career conference for members of
 their class, and took charge of the Junior dance, while the
 Sophomores were responsible for the Fall Kickoff dance.
 It did not take long for the Freshman officers to become
oriented, as they carried out the Spring Commons Room Ball,
and allied themselves with the Women's Freshman Council to
sponsor mixer dances for their classmates.

MEN'S COUNCIL
Men's Council is the voice of the male student at Pitt. Its specific aim is to accept,
develop, promote, administer, and evaluate the activities and services within the
framework of the University program that pertain to men students, in the belief
that many will benefit from such programs.
  Council is composed of thirty members, two from each class in the College and
Schools of Business Administration, Engineering and Mines, and Education, and
one member each from Pharmacy, I.F. Council, and Engineering and Mines Association.
  Some of the many services maintained by Men's Council are freshman orienta.
tion programs, conference classes, the eighth floor lounge, football movies, and student typewriters and mimeographing machines.
  This year the Council sponsored mixer dances for freshmen, a retreat in October
and a mid-semester dance in February.

PANHELLENIC COUNCIL
Panhellenic Council, the governing body of sorority
women, is composed of three representatives elected from
each sorority.
   The general purpose of the Council is to maintain inter sorority co-operation, determine Panhellenic policy, and
 establish uniform procedures for rushing.
   Some of the many social events sponsored by the Pan hels included a reception in the fall for freshmen and
 transfer women, a Panhellenic Ball honoring pledges in
 the spring, and in conjunction with the fraternities, a Pan hellenic-I.F. Sing.
   Annually, for the past ten years, they have contributed
 to the aid of a war orphan, and each year presented a
 scholarship cup to the sorority that maintained the highest
 overall average. Through proceeds gained from Stunt
 Night they also financed a Panhellenic scholarship.
Officers: Helen McLain, treasurer; Christine Taylor, secretary; Eloise
France, president.

WOMEN'S SELF GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION
The specific aims of the Women's Self Government Association
are to foster a spirit of loyalty to the University, to promote
fellowship between faculty, administration, and the students,
to uphold and develop the traditions of the University, and to
coordinate the organized activities of the women into a unified
whole.
  All undergraduate women students registered in the University and who are carrying a minimum of twelve credits are ipso
facto members.
  The group began the year with its annual retreat at White
Sulphur Springs Hotel near Bedford, Pennsylvania, in September. The social affairs that were planned included the Rose Tea,
Commons Room Christmas party, mixer dances, and afternoon
teas in the Commons Room. The most significant activities
were the publication of the Polaris and the Freshman orientation program.

the University. Membership is made up of forty women, two

WOMEN'S SOPHOMORE CLASS CABINET
This year the Women's Sophomore Class certainly proved themselves to be one of the most active student organizations. Led
by their president, Jean Lintio, they started off the year by welcoming the new Sophomore transfers at a tea.
  With the Sophomore men, they held the first dance of the
school year, the Football Fracas. This dance featured a program
by the football players and cheerleaders during the intermission.
Officers: Jean Lintio, president; Sally Nelson, W. S. G. A. representative; Esther Mishelevich, secretary; Mary Palmiere, treasurer.
The Sophomore men and women found that they worked well
together, and cooperated again to institute a Sophomore Day.
  The highlight of this year was a dinner the girls gave for their
mothers. This event was so successful that it had to be held on
two different evenings to accommodate allwho wanted to attend.
  Certainly with such a fine record, Pitt can expect even
greater things from this class in the next two years.

WOMEN'S SENIOR CLASS CABINET
We all know that Seniors are always busy, but the
Women's Senior Class still managed to find time
to meet and enjoy social events during their last
year here at Pitt. Many of them gave up the last
week of their summer vacation to attend Mentor
Training, and then they served as Mentors to the
incoming Freshmen for a six-week period.
  The Senior Class officers directed the officials of
the other women's classes in planning the Heart
Hop, Pitt's only girl-ask-boy dance.
  The Seniors enjoyed each other's company at
class dinners, and as the year drew to a close, they
came together for the Rose Tea. At this time the
nominees for Senior Queen were revealed. On
Coronation day, the day before graduation, the
Seniors came together for the last time as a class
to honor the outstanding Senior woman.

        EVENING STUDENT'S ASSOCIATION
The need for the unification and organization of the thousands
of University Evening School students prompted the founding
of the Evening Student's Association, a local organization to
which all students attending evening sessions automatically
belong and yearly the group works toward fulfilling that need
through various E.S.A. sponsored student activities.
  This year under the active E.S.A. social program evening
students enjoyed square dances and get-acquainted dances,
along with a semi-formal dance and a candle-light dinner. The
Association also sponsored chapel services and an evening
newspaper.
  E.S.A. annually makes the presentation of an Activity Key
award to all members of the executive committee and the officers
of the group, in recognition of the services they have rendered.

FINE ARTS
As we look forward into a "New Era" at Pitt, it is perhaps
worth risking momentary eye strain by attempting to look backward at the same time. The so-called "Fine Arts" activities have
had a healthy part in our educational enterprise. While they
have had to "make do" with what has at times seemed to be inadequate space and schedule facilities, they have never lacked
for students and directors whose enthusiasm has made it unthinkable that they would mark time waiting for heaven to
arrive.
  The result has been that these activities have furnished a very
real and very important part of the education of their members.
These young people have all, at times, achieved something better than they knew they had.
  We all look forward with eagerness to what is to come.

the living theater and drama
PITT PLAYERS
The purposes of the Pitt Players, the oldest dramatic organization in Pittsburgh, are to provide
worthwhile dramatic experiences and promote
good theater at the University.
   Pitt Players, however, is far more than a dramatic club, for it is open to all students who are
interested in any phase of the theater. Before an
actor can step upon the stage, it is necessary to
have a stage crew, a makeup department, a business staff, and the multitude of people to do the
countless odd jobs that arise. As Director Michael
McHale put it, "Anyone who can lift a paintbrush or address a post card can help. There is no
talent in the world the theater can't use."
  This year Pitt's "community theater"-despite
an outbreak of measles, bouts with the flu, and all
the other hard luck that seems to plague show
business put on a musical, "Brigadoon," two
modern comedies, "The Man Who Came to Dinner," and "Stalag 17," and "Taming of the
Shrew."
Lloyd Welden, technical director, and Michael McHlale,
director of Pitt Players, discuss sets between scenes during
a dress rehearsal.
Lloyd Welden's technicians were kept busy the year around building sets in the
Scene Shop located on the basement floor of the Cathedral.
Props are essential to any Player production. Here Donna Groves
and Betty Chiapetta make ready props for "Taming of the Shrew."
Larry Heller gets "made up" for the part of Sheridan Whiteside, the
male lead in "The Man Who Came to Dinner."
Sheridan Whiteside (Larry Heller), script in hand, prepares to "go on the air" in
"The Man Who Came to Dinner."
Three stalwarts of the stage crew were Roswell Jones, technical assistant, Roland Moyan, and Terry Evans. Above they prepare and hang
lights.
In charge of the sound for "Taming of the Shrew" were Barbara Fifer and Don
Gersztoff.
"A Shrew, a title of all titles, the worst." Katharina (Mary Johnson), at right, shows her shrewish qualities. But as Petruchio (John Joy),
center, carries his newly won bride Kate across the threshold, she weakens. And finally by the end of the play, "Taming of the Shrew,"
Kate is quite the most obedient wife, and Petruchio and Kate embrace, at right, in peace and love.
"Come, kiss me Kate!" With those words Petruchio kisses Kate and "peace it bodes and love and quiet life" as the curtain falls.

They also serve as an outstanding representative of the
University through the presentation of concerts at other
colleges in the surrounding areas.
  After their strenuous auditions in the Fall, the Glee
Club teamed up with Women's Choral to present a Christrnas concert, and later in the year, they presented their
own Spring concert. In addition, the Glee Club has been
called upon many times to sing at University functions.
  The outstanding event for these boys was their Spring
tour in April. None of the members minded missing a few
days of classes to sing at several women's colleges and to
spend a memorable weekend in New York City. Much ol
Lhe credit for the success of this organization should go to
the director, David Weiss, and to the president, Mike
Higgins.

Through its five-fold activities program, which encourages
fluency in speech and thought among its members, the
Men's Debate Association has become one of the most
prominent organizations on the Pitt campus. The group
devoted three weekly meetings to an intramural program
of practice debates and speeches. MDA also held many
intercollegiate debates, which included trips to Notre
Dame, Houston, West Point, and Cornell. The Pitt Cross
Examination Tournament climaxed the intercollegiate
program. Another part of MDA's busy schedule was taking intramural debates to 35 local service club organizations. A fourth area of MDA's work was the annual high
school debate clinic. The fifth point of the Association's
program was the sponsorship of "Face the People" each
week on WQED, on which a panel of students quizzed
prominent guests on interesting discussion subjects.
  MDA took many honors this year including the State
Championship and first place honors at Maryland.

The purpose of the Women's Speech Association is to promote effective speaking, create an awareness of the need
for critical thinking, and provide hostessing for speech
events. The only qualification for membership is a desire
to become an effective speaker by participating in debates,
poetry reading sessions, radio shows, and other speech
exhibitions.
  Their projects were a Beaux Arts show, put on primarily
for the benefit of the freshman women, and the sponsoring
of a debate tournament. They also held a retreat where
they discussed future objectives.
  The Association is unique in the type of meetings it
holds. They have no set of traditions handed down from
year to year, other than the by-laws. They believe that
each year the interests of the girls should be satisfied.

PUBLICATIONS
Student publications at the University of Pittsburgh have been
organized and administered in such a way that they have provided both staff members and readers with training in the best
journalistic traditions. One of the strong traditions of Pitt publications concerns the freedom of staff members to write as they
please. In exercising this important journalistic principle, students have developed for themselves new concepts of democratic living. They have acknowledged their responsibilities in
upholding the rights of others. Readers of Pitt publications are
aware of the tradition and know that such practices will, in the
"New Era," strengthen the position of the Pitt News, the Owl,
the Skyscraper Engineer, and the Pitt Capsule as significant student activities.

THE 1957 OWL
Eugene J. Reinbold, business manager
The 1957 Owl staff began functioning in May, 1956, and completed its work Friday, March 15, 1957. The year-round operation of producing a pictorial and written record of the school
year was undertaken by Thomas C. Vrana, editor-in-chief;
Mazie Ann Hoffman, associate editor; Bob Hawxhurst, photo
editor; and Alfred Pelaez, literary editor. The so called "big
four" were capably assisted by an editorial staff of 48 and a
business staff of 16 under the direction of Eugene J. Reinbold,
business manager. Neal Zweig, assistant business manager, and
Howie Rossen, business coordinator, helped Reinbold to have
one of the most efficient business staffs in Owl history.
   The theme "The Inauguration of a New Era," was chosen
because the staff believed that the year 1957 would be a pivot
year in Pitt's continued growth. With a new administration
under the leadership of Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield, 1957
was destined to be the first year of a "new.era" which promises
"to make Pitt nothing less than one of the top six universities
in the country." The theme also had direct bearing on the yearbook itself. The 1957 Owl was the 51st student annualthe start of a second half of a century and of perhaps "a new era
in yearbooks."
  The Owl staff not only went through the editorial and business steps of trying to put out an "All-American" book, but
also stepped out socially quite often during the year. Besides
parties and the annual banquet at the end of the year, Owl staffers made two trips to Buffalo--where the Owl is published by
Wm. J; Keller Inc.--to lay down yearbook plans and read proof
and in general to have "a good time." A Fall trip to Cleveland
for the annual Associated Collegiate Press convention was enjoyed by selected staff members. And the Owl Photo Editor,

  Whether or not the 1957 Owl is an "All-American" book, one
thing can be said of its staff: "It was an All-American staff."

published semi-weekly
THE PITT NEWS
The Pitt News, during the year 1956-57, attempted to express
the growth and vitality of the University led by the new administration. This was shown through campus features, news
articles, and editorials. Outstanding news stories during the
year included the opening of the Student Union, a campaign to
send the Varsity Marching Band to the Miami football game,
the announcement of football player Joe Walton's selection to
the All-American ranks, the coverage of the presidential campaign through a series of debates by columnists Irv Rothman
and Harold Jacobs, a discussion with Eleanor Roosevelt by Pitt
News reporter Joyce Koplos, and a television interview with
Vice President Richard M. Nixon by Editor Rosemary Ray.
The business staff was ably handled by John Fischer, business
manager, with the help of Jim Edmonston, assistant manager,
and Fred Sarbin, controller.
  New features included frequent articles on cooking by gourmet Fitzhugh Schenley, a change in the front page flag, and a
pictorial two-page spread covering Homecoming events.
  The News, working in cramped office conditions this year,
nevertheless, strove to live up to its past All-American ratings
and to its responsibilities to the University of Pittsburgh.

workshop for magazine journalism
  SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER
  Now in its sixth year of publication, the Skyscraper Engineer is
  a permanent and vital part of the Schools of Engineering and
  Mines at Pitt. The magazine serves as the leading activity for
  many engineering students and encourages original writing and
  research and serves as a workshop for magazine journalism.
  This was a year of progress for the magazine and one in which
  many records were set and innovations created. Early in No  vember, Editor-in-chief Mitchell Kozikowski and Business Man  ager Richard Jackson attended the Engineering College Mag  azine's convention at the University of Arkansas to petition for
  membership in the Association. The Skyscraper was accepted
  unanimously on the basis of its high standards.
  Many circulation and advertising records were set by the
  capable business staff. Each issue was bigger than the previous
one with a record 88-pages appearing in the March issue.
   A record number of students were on this year's staff. The
mainstay of the staff was Managing Editor Jack Albert. Many
hours were spent by Bob Muzik, Ken Rothert, and Bill Snodgrass who assembled the January research issue. Other major
staff members were Story Editor Dick Bott, Associate Editor
Tom Tarolli, and Production Manager Ken Speckhals. Fred
Horn, Cal Jobe, and Dick Reutzel were invaluable on the business staff.
  All of the articles and features in the magazine are not staff
pieces; the Skyscraper encourages contributions from engineering and science students.
  Aside from copies that are sold on campus, the Skyscraper
Engineer is circulated throughout the world to alumni, high
school students, other colleges, and business men in all fields.

pharmacy magazine
PITT CAPSULE
Nowhere in the history of any student publication has
the going been easy. To obtain the many talents and facilities necessary in producing a magazine of quality is difficult for even professional groups, but most certainly is it
true for the health profession schools. So specialized are
the courses there that no background of training is offered
in writing or composition other than the minimum year
required for a bachelor of science degree. The students
responsible for the past ten successful years of the Capsule's publication have never received any great material
reward, nor have they expected any. They have assumed
the job of continuing to publish a pharmaceutical publication for only one personal purpose: to study, write, and
learn more of their own profession and in doing so help
make their public cognizant of the students desire to promote pharmacy.

student handbook
POLARIS
Polaris this past fall was again published for the second time as
a combined men's and women's student handbook under the coeditorship of Patricia Link and Chris Christ and the capable
business management of Vera Krokonko and Howard Rossen.
A TRIBUTE TO "THE GOOD DOC"
  Under its gold and blue cover the Polaris made available to
all students of the University information concerning the University, student activities, and important student events in
the coming year.
  In September the Polaris was distributed to all freshmen in
special Freshman Week events in order to aid them in becoming
acquainted with the University and its various facilities. The
Polaris was also made available to any other student of the University durirng the first week of school in September through the
offices of the Dean of Men and the Dean of Women.
Pitt publications paid tribute to Dr. Donald E. Swarts, director of Student Publications, by giving their favorite gourmet a box of apples
and cheeses at the annual Christmas party.
Meade Beers, president of Y.M.C.A., was chair-
man of Freshman Camp.

FRESHMEN LEARN TO WORK TOGETHER AT CAMP

Prior to the opening of school a group of 207 freshman men went
to Camp Kon-O-Kwee for a three day session of fun and in-
struction. The average newcomer to the University feels uneasy
and lonely during his first few weeks on campus. This, perhaps,
is a result of the UniVersity’s size and its foreboding style of
Gothic architecture, complete with narrow windows and dark
corridors. In time, of course,the freshman becomes acclimated
to his surroundings and adjusts into an active, happy student.

For the men who have the opportunity of attending Fresh-
man Camp, however, this adjustment period is by-passed. In
the course of the three days they met many of their fellow stu-
dents as well as faculty members and upper-class student leaders
with whom they would soon be working. They learned Pitt’s
traditions and status as an institution of higher education. They
learned how cooperation is a vital part of any university. They
learned to sing the Alma Mater—and to sing it with pride and
meaning.

 

Ray Bees reaches for the Freshman Camp trophy awarded to the
freshmen in the School of Business Administration. Tom Wiegman
(standing), head counselor for the “bus ads,” Dr. Demas Barnes,
president of the Y.M.C.A., and Dr. John Geise, dean of the College,
watch the unveiling.

Shown here is the skit “Freshman Registration" put on by the fresh-
men in business administration. This skit helped the “bus ads” pile
up points toward the camp trophy.

A football Saturday at Pitt Stadium.
      A TIME FOR SPIRIT AND A TIME FOR VICTORY
Slowly but surely Coach Johnny Michelosen's Panthers are
showing the nation that a team unversed in theatrics and
slight-of-hand magic tricks can play winning football. For the
second consecutive year Pitt finished in the upper echelon of
gridiron powers and they did it with a relentless, hard driving
ground attack and a sturdy defense.
  Throughout the season fans could be heard muttering that
the Panthers didn't give the customers their money's worth.
"All they do is run off tackle and up the middle" was a common
complaint. It might be added that they also won more than their
share of ball games.
  Every fan in the stadium knew who had the ball when the
Blue and Gold was on the attack. They could clearly see Corny
Salvaterra take the snap back from Charley Brueckman and
hand off to Corky Cost, Ralph Jelic, Tom Jenkins, Jim Theodore, or any of a host of good running backs. And, if they knew
anything about football they could clearly see Bob Pollock,
Herman Canil, Bob Rosborough, and Joe Walton opening up
giant holes in the defensive line to enable the backs to grind out
valuable yardage. They could see Dan Wisniewski and Vince
Scorsone quickly pull out of the line and cut down the defending
backs with the precision of a McCormick reaper during the harvest.
  This was the way the Panthers played. They didn't depend
upon tricks of any sort to win ball games. They used talented
material and coached them to perfection in the fundamentals of
the game-and it worked better than any razzle-dazzle that numerous coaches have used at Pitt since Jock Sutherland left
in 1938. The Panthers played as tough a schedule as any team
in the country, and lost only two games-to California and
Minnesota-while winning seven and playing a seven-seven tie
with Penn State. This was the best brand of football seen in the
stadium in almost two decades. And the fans stopped complaining long enough to set an all time high in home attendance
which proves that any type of winning football is spectacular.

One of the ways the students backed the team was by turning out for victory rallies. "Doc" Carlson and "Fergy" Ferguson were always
on hand to add life to these events along with, of course, the players, the coaches, the cheerleaders, and the band. Pictured here is part of
the crowd of 1700 who turned out for the rally after the Notre Dame game.
              Pitt's seven cheerleaders aroused student spirit and morally helped the team post a great record.

   Joe Walton capped a brilliant college career by becoming Pitt's
   thirty-seventh All-American football player. The burley end,
   who excelled both on offense and defense, made every one of the
   mythical teams selected and finished high up in the voting for
   the Heisman Trophy, annually awarded to the outstanding col   lege football player.
     Joe, the son of the late Frank "Tiger" Walton, a star Pitt
   tackle during the early 1930's, led the nation in touchdown
   catches in 1955 and tied for the lead this season. On defense he
   constantly piled up opposing plays and made sensational tackles,
   causing Duke coach Bill Murray to say that he's "unmatched at
   smashing end runs."
     The Owl proudly congratulates a true All-American, both as
   a player and as a classmate.

LANTERN NIGHT, CARITAS,
PANHEL  TRADITIONS

Two weeks after the beginning of school freshman women were ofﬁcially initiated
into the University at Lantern Night, the first of many traditions they will partic-
ipate in during the next four years.

At the colorful ceremony performed in the Commons Room, 239 women, attired
completely in white, held their lanterns of truth before them so they could more
readily follow “the inner light of Truth.” They were now a part of the University
and ready to meet the wonders and challenges that awaited them.

Before October was completed the freshman women also participated in two
other traditional events~Caritas and the Panhellenic Party. Caritas is a ceremony
given each year in honor of the freshmen and their senior mentors. It strives to im-
press the importance and value of certain things#such as charity and kindness—
that will aid the women in their college lives. The Panhellenic Party introduces

Pitt sororities entertained freshman women and their senior mentors Carrie Misner (Voice of Caritas) and Charlotte Overly (Marcissa

at the annual Panhellenic Party in Stephen Foster Memorial. Whitman) appeared in Caritas presented annually by the Women of
Pitt as a symbol of faith, hope, and love. Caritas expresses the hard-

ships and accomplishments of women throughout the ages.

 

The Panhellenic Choir consisting of three members from each sorority sang for the freshman women. _

“By this ﬂame within my hand, I pledge my word, 0 Alma Mater, to seek, both for myself and for
those who follow me, the inner light of Truth.” With this pledge, given in the Commons Rooms,
239 freshman women of the Class of 1960 were officially inducted into University life.

   For the second time this year Pitt's fighting Panthers won
   everything--except the ball game--from the Rambling Wrecks
   from Georgia Tech.
     The Panthers completely dominated the statistics, just as
   they did last January in the Sugar Bowl, but lacked the neces   sary scoring punch when they got inside the Tech 30-yard line.
     Experts predicted that the Rambling Wrecks, the top defen   sive team in the nation, and the big, hard hitting Panthers
   would engage in a defensive battle with the possibility of one
   touchdown winning the game. Although one touchdown did
   decide the outcome, both teams opened up and turned the game
   into an offensive thriller, with the southerners coming out on
   top, 21-14.
     Over 400 student followers of Pitt football made the journey
   to Jacksonville, Florida, to root for the Blue and Gold in one of
   their finest efforts.
     The Panthers lost, but they surely weren't beaten.

competition, 21-14.

BASKETBALL
Coach Bob Timmons' hoopsters climaxed Pitt's most successful basketball season in twenty years by being selected
to participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's annual tournament.
  During regular season play the Blue and Gold posted
an impressive 15 9 record against some of the nation's
toughest college teams. Included in the record were victories over Geneva and perennially strong Duquesne for
the Steel Bowl championship and wins over Seton Hall
and Western Kentucky to carry them into the finals of
the Orange Bowl Tournament where they bowed to Connecticut in an overtime tussle.
  Leading the Panthers this season, as they have for the
past three years, were co-captains Bob Lazor and John
Riser. Both Lazor and Riser broke the existing Pitt career
scoring record by netting more than a thousand points.
Rounding out the starting array were junior sparkplugs
Chuck l[ursh and Julius Pegues and sophomore sensation

also enjoyed bowling parties and fishing trips.

      ARNOLD SOWELL

Arnie Sowell, Pitt's representative at the Olympic games at
Melbourne, Australia, earned respect and admiration for himself, his school, and his country.
  Sowell, a product of Schenley High School, is one of the greatest middle-distance runners in the world. He is co-holder of the
1000-yard run record at 2:02.8 minutes, the IC4A half-mile
champion for the past three years, and the National Collegiate
and National A.A.U. king for the last two years.
  But more than all these track titles, at Melbourne, Sowell
was, in the words of his coach, Carl Olson, "A good-will ambassador for Pitt." The Owl salutes Arnie Sowell, an Olympian on
and off the track.

Wendell Harford limbers up before the Penn State meet.
Hampered by the absence of Olympian Arnie Sowell, coach Carl Olson's cross country runners still
managed to win five of six regular season meets.
  Sowell was missed sorely, however, in the
IC4A championship in which the Panther harriers were the defending title-holders. As it was,
they wound up ninth.
  The only loss came in their last meet with Penn
State, 34-25. The local thinclads won three other
dual meets and one tri-meet. A meet with Army
was postponed when the cadets became the victims of food poisoning.
  Sophomore Vince Timon came the closest to
filling Sowell's spikes. Timon topped off his great
year with a third place finish in the IC4A. Other
frontline runners were Jim  Moore, Thornton
Smith, Wendell Harford, John Christof, Tom
Jessep, and Dale Fauser.

SOCCER
With inexperience as the main drawback, the Panther soccer
team suffered its worst season since its beginning in 1954. Coach
Leo Bemis' booters wound up the season with three wins, five
losses, and two ties.
  The only three opponents the soccermen could beat were
Lock Haven, North Carolina State, and Denison; the ties came
with Slippery Rock and Army. Among their conquerors were
last year's national co-champions, Brockport State and Penn
State.
  Sam Hazou, a native Jordanian, was the high scorer of the
sophomore-dotted eleven, but Jerry Bressanelli was the top allaround booter. Both have one more year of eligibility.
  Defensive stalwarts were Paul Griffiths, Jack Hill, and Jack
Hester. Chuck Kane, who played soccer for the first time this
season, was the most promising of the sophomores.

A close decision by tough Penn'State in the final
meet of the season snapped the matmen's 26 meet
winning streak and halted their bid for a third
consecutive undefeated year.
  Nevertheless, the grapplers had the most successful season of any of Pitt's varsity squads.
Numbering among their nine victories were wins
over the Big Ten champs, Michigan; the Atlantic
Coast kings, Maryland; and the Big Seven runnerups, Iowa State.
  National champion Ed Peery continued undefeated in dual meet competition with ten straight
wins, while Ted Bienkowski and heavyweight
Ron Schirf had only one draw apiece to mar a
perfect record. Bill Hulings (6-2-2), Vic DeFelice
(8 2), Bob Bubb (2-2), Bob Richardson (3-6),
Dave Johnson (9-1), and Tom Alberts (6-2) completed the squad that Coach Rex Peery called
"one of the best we've had here in eight years."

 Coach Warren Neiger's gymnasts turned in the
 best season record of their three years in varsity
 competition as they knocked off some of the top
 teams in the East to post a 6 3 mark.
   The leading scorers for the Panther tumblers
 were Dave lirst, John hlammond, Don Neeld,
 Chuck Kerber, Jim Mulvihill, Joe Lamartine,
 Tom Darling, Ron Kohn, John Cacolice, and
 Dave RuLer.
   The flying rings contingent of Tom Darling,
 John hammond, and Dave Hlirst proved to b
 the Blue and Gold's most consistent scorers. Time
 after time this Panther trio would cop the first
 three places in the rings, and often contributed
 the points needed to garner a xictor).
   iNeiger is losing only three lettermen to gradua tion. an(l with a flock of promising freshmen on
 the way uip, the gymnasts should turn in an ev en
 better record next xear.

October was the ﬁnal month of all-out
campaigning for the presidential elections,
and Pitt and Pittsburgh certainly weren’t
missed by the touring politicians.

Eleanor Roosevelt, former First Lady,
started the parade. Mrs. Roosevelt spoke
to a primarily student audience in the
Carnegie Lecture Hall. Following in the
footsteps of the gracious Mrs. Roosevelt
were ex-President Harry S. Truman, com-
plete with his repertoire of “give ’em

Sergeant Joe Grcrmko's riflemen improved as the
season progressed, but their late surge still xwasn't
enough to lift them higher than fifth place in the
Greater Pittsburgh Rifle League standings.
  Led by Captain James Flynn, the Blue and
Gold scored double wins over Geneva and indiana
State Teachers and split with Duquesne -the win
being a forfeit when the Dukes failed to appear
for a meet. Washington and Jefferson, Carnegie
Tech, and West Virginia proved to be too tough
for the locals, each defeating them twice.
  Aiding Flynn throughout the season were seniors Howard Brewer and Ronald Fry, sophomore
Larry Duquette, and junior Richard Simpson.
Duquette and Simpson are expected to form the
nucleus of a much improved team next season.
Aiding them will be a freshman team that fired a
score of 1373 in their only match a very creditable performance for a group of first year men.

Wait until next year is more than just an idle
dream when followers of Pitt's squash team are on
the shouting end. Although the 1957 squad failed
to garner a victory in five matches, a strong freshman team and six returnees from this year's varsity indicate that a brighter future is ahead. In
these respects this was more than just a "lost season" for Coach Jim Tully's racquet wielders.
  Navy, Army, Amherst, Trinity, and Wesleyan
all handily defeated the Panthers but, to their
credit, it must be said that they acquitted themselves admirably. All of their matches were played
away from home, and in few other sports is a
home court more of an advantage than it is in
squash. And, although the team scores were onesided, the individual scores were usually close and
victory was not as distant as it appeared

Founded in 1953 by a group of twenty students under the
instruction of Bill Rowe, the Pitt Fencing Club, a local organization, has become a permanent part of the artistic,
sports, and social scene at the University. Anyone who is
affiliated with the University and who has an interest and
enjoys participating in the art of fencing is eligible for
membership in the group, whose instructorship has now
been assumed by Dr. F. A. McKnight.
  The Pitt Fencing Club, which has grown more popular
with the student body each year since its founding, was
formed in order to further the art of fencing and encourage
good sportsmanship.
  The organization's activities have included fencing
meets in Washington, Pennsylvania, Cleveland, Ohio,
and Pittsburgh, the instruction of new fencers, and an
annual spring outing.

                                                             MESSAGE
                                                             During your four years at Pitt, our faculty has sought two ob                                                             jectives for your education: to introduce you to a number of
                                                             fields of learning, and to teach you to apply systematic and crit                                                             ical ways of thinking to the subjects you have studied.
                                                               I hope you will remember the significance of their efforts. The
                                                             first suggests that learning never ceases, that we have only been
                                                             introduced to the vast storehouse of knowledge which has been
                                                             developed through the centuries and to which we add constantly.
                                                             The second suggests that having learned sound ways of thinking,
                                                             sound methods for attacking problems, evaluating ideas or
                                                             studying issues, we must continue to apply rational and critical
                                                             thinking outside the classroom as well as in.
                                                               Your habits of study and thought must now be transferred to
                                                             professional journals, handbooks and manuals, in-service train                                                             ing programs in your career field, and to self-directed reading
                                                             and studying in the world of affairs which may shape your hap                                                             piness and success as it shapes that of all of us.
                                                               There is a corollary to these suggestions. Just as you continue
                                                             the learning process, so we, on our part, pledge our efforts to see
                                                             that Pitt continues to offer educational services to you. Through

                 is just starting at the University and coincides with the great
                 new developments in the city and the nation. They are in school
                 at a time when business leaders are giving a new emphasis to the
                 importance of management, as is evidenced by the way man                 agement development programs are being sponsored by industry
                 over the country. This Atomic Age, however, requires people
                 with ability, initiative, imagination, and a willingness to work.
   I tI hope our students will not take seriously the idea so often
                 heard relative to security from the cradle to the grave. There is
                 no security except that which the individual makes for himself.
                 Pitt students of Business Administration have never had a
                 greater opportunity. May they accept the challenge and move
                 forward with the spirit of Pitt and the times.

PITTSBURGH INDUSTRY GR
There is little doubt that Pittsburgh is the most important industrial community in the nation. Nowhere else does the field of
industry offer so great an opportunity to the college graduate.
With this thought in mind, the School of Business Administration has taken unto itself the task of preparing students for positions of responsibility open to both men and women today in
the field of business and commerce.
  Since its founding in 1908, the School has sought to establish
a sound business education for its students, bring about an
understanding of the relationships between individuals, business
and the community, and disseminate knowledge in the field of
economic and business affairs.
Dean Vincent Lanfear, Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield, and Dr.
Albert Van Dusen, assistant chancellor in charge of planning and
development, were on hand when the newly-installed electronic
computer, nerve center of a new University data processing center,
was formally put into operation.
Students using the new International Business Machine located on the eighth floor of the Cathedral, already have nicknamed it "Pedro,"
a friendly contraction for Pitt Electronic Data-processing Research Organization.

:AT CHANCE FOR GRADUATE
     The School has found that narrow specialization in one phase
   of business training should be avoided, and that in the long run,
   the students who have been the most broadly trained will ad   vance the farthest. For this reason the student is required to
   make a study of the fundamentals of English, mathematics,
   political science, economics, accounting, business law, money
   and banking, business finance, and statistics.
     Many graduates have been assisted in obtaining fine positions
   by the University placement bureau, for there is a continuous
   flow of calls from industry to the School of Business Adminis   tration asking for a recommendation of some alumni.
                                                                       The School of Business Administration has its own library located
                                                                       on the 21st floor of the Cathedral. All books, periodicals, news                                                                       papers, magazines, and pamphlets are kept up to date.
Dean Vincent Lanfear is always willing to help students. Here he is shown counseling Christos Kyriazi about his course of study for the
Spring semester.
Business administration classes are held throughout the Cathedral. Below, Watson McKee, instructor in industry, reads from a source
book to supplement a point in his lecture.

ICAL WHOOPING

The whole atmosphere of Pitt changed
as the sixth of November—election dayﬁ
neared. Members of the Young Demo-
crats and Young Republicans rabidly
Voiced their opinions. The Pitt News ran
a series of heated political debates, with
both Irv Rothman (Democrat) and Har-
old Jacobs (Republican) declaring why
his party should be elected. Everyone
walking through the halls wore some sort
of a campaign button. Then, as suddenly
as it began, it was oVer—the buttons and
un-used speeches were put away for an-
other four years and an unusual calmness
covered the campus.

Freshman Lois Coss holds Ike-Nixon buttons and ﬂashes a big victory grin indi-
cating President Eisenhower’s successful bid for a second term.

Pitt students teamed up with other students from district colleges to give out with
political whooping for their favorite candidates.

A sort of "tool of the trade" for many business administration students was the
adding machine. With its fast, easy manner of adding and subtracting long columns of figures, it helped many a student "find an answer to his problems."
THE COLLEGE
          More than a century ago, Pudd'nhead Wilson advised his
          friends, "Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die
          even the undertaker will be sorry." Had he been the dean of a
          college, he doubtless would have told his students, "So do your
          work day by day that examination time will be vacation time
          for everybody but the instructors." I heartily recommend both
          views, and suggest that there is a close relationship between
          them. On entering college, every student opens a new era in his
          life which can and should be a glorious period of growth. Pudd'n          head's advice provides a good basis for making it so.

LIBERAL EDUCATION-BASIS FOR SUCCESS
Eleven years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Pittsburgh Academy was founded. Today, the College
in the University of Pittsburgh is the direct descendant of that
pioneer institution.
  Of all the schools in the University the College is by far the
least specialized. In general practice it does not attempt to
train its students in one narrow field--rather it seeks to endow
in its graduates, through a liberal education, the ability to lead
an effective and satisfying life.
  Because such an education most fully brings out the full
potentialities of an individual, it provides the best foundation
for further professional training, for an executive career in
business and industry, for leadership in community affairs, and
In addition to classroom instruction students seek guidance through

even for a successful family life.
  To achieve its purpose, the College has developed a program
to enable the student to study a variety of dissimilar fields and
to see their relationship and to teach him to assemble facts and
draw reasonable conclusions from them.
  From such subjects as geology, chemistry, physics, and biology he learns to understand his world. From history, languages, and sociology he learns to understand his fellowman,
and from psychology and philosophy he learns to understand
himself. Through English, speech, and journalism he learns to
express what he has learned.
  If the University were the entire solar system, the College
would surely be the sun.
      In search for a quiet place to study, many students found the solitude
      of the University libraries an ideal atmosphere. Pitt's libraries con312   tain over 700,000 volumes.

Over 1400 parents and friends of freshman students passed through the reception line to shake hands with Chancellor Edward H. Litch-

field and other Pitt officials.

DR. LITCHFIELD MEETS PARENTS OF FRESHMEN

 

Dave Bender, president of Student Congress, was one of the 175
student aides in attendance at the Chancellor’s Reception to assist
parents and to interpret to them the meaning of the University.

 

The l\Ien’s Glee Club under the direction of David Weiss sang for
the parents a11d friends of Pitt freshman students.

Freshman Camp, Lantern Night, and the other various pro-
grams intended to acclimate freshmen to college life had prac-
tically accomplished their aims by the ninth of November. One
more group, however, had to be shown what a university educa-
tion consisted of and how it should be attained—the parents.

At the annual Chancellor’s Reception held in the Commons
Room parents of Pitt freshmen met the officials and faculty of
the University and also learned what would be expected of their
sons and daughters during the next four years. They were told
that the fundamental purpose of an education is not to produce
specialists in various ﬁelds, but to give each student a good,
general foundation upon which he can build throughout his life.

After meeting the Chancellor, the parents toured the Uni-
versity and met with student leaders who acted as aides for the
occasion.

 

Light refreshments were served in the Commons Room as University
personnel met the parents.

SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY
            The faculty and students of the School of Dentistry accept the
            Inauguration of the "New Era" at Pitt as an exciting challenge.
            The facilities of the new Schools of the Health Professions
            Building for teaching and research, the expanding possibilities
            of preventing further dental caries while utilizing the excellent
            present methods of correcting "dental ills," and the added hope
            of a new clinic building, give one solace in the knowledge that,
            while much has been done, much more can and will be done. Un            der this "New Era" the dental student gains a great deal, for
            these expanding facilities immeasurably advance his education
            and, consequently, his usefulness to the community as a whole.
            Dr. William F. Swanson
            Dean of the School of Dentistry
Besides working on patients in the infirmary, a different aspect of
dentistry is approached in the dent school laboratories. Articulating
and waxing dentures are a few of the jobs performed by the dentistry
student.
Should any of the students in the dental infirmary run into difficulties a group of doctors is available at all times to help them.
Here a student is shown discussing a problem with one of the doctors.
James Hodges, a junior in the School of Dentistry, gains valuable experience working on a patient in the dental infirmary.
SATISFIES DENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF COMMUNITY
This year the School of Dentistry moved its pre-clinical instruction for freshmen and sophomores to the ultra-modern,
newly erected Schools of the Health Professions building. It is
a nine story structure with a common student center, a library,
lecture and seminar rooms, laboratories and an auditorium.
  Since the general purpose of the School of Dentistry-just as
any dental education facility depends on the dental health needs
of the community and the ever growing responsibilities modern
dentistry must face, its ability to turn out expert practitioners
year in and year out must be unfailing.
  To accomplish this, the School selects only the students best
qualified to become successful dentists, presents a curriculum
and training program enabling every graduate to be qualified
DENTISTRY e SENIORS
and competent to begin the practice of dentistry, and maintains
a postgraduate program to increase the effectiveness of the
practicing dentist in both knowledge and skill.
  For the undergraduate students, the School includes a branch
of the Student American Dental Association, three chapters of
national dental fraternities, Dental Student Council, and numerous honors and cash awards for outstanding achievement.
  The library of the School of Dentistry is quite extensive, containing 27,000 bound volumes, 10,000 pamphlets, and 11,000
journals some in foreign languages, covering the field from the
earliest known works on dentistry in Latin to the most current
findings.
The student dentists gain most of their experience by performing what they have
learned in class on patients in the dental infirmary. Pictured above is a typical
day in the infirmary with junior and senior students at work.

SCHOOL OF EDUCATION
           In America men look to education as the bulwark of freedom.
  fl       Today more than ever before Americans are turning to education
           for leadership in the struggle to make the world free. They are
           expressing serious concern for the role that our schools must
    -      assume in the years ahead. Those who are planning to become
-~         teachers of America's youth must face this challenge with schol,-     arship and vision. As students in a great university entering a
 A?      "New Era" of growth and development they will have an un          usual opportunity to prepare themselves for the important re          sponsibilities of education in the critical years of the twentieth
          century just ahead.
          Dr. Paul I. Masoner
          Dean of the School of Education
  PREPARES EDUCATORS IN A CHANGING SOCIETY
It has become apparent that the profession of teaching
increasingly characterized by specialized techniques and
knowledge requires specialized preparation. Essential to
the successful pursuit of teaching is a knowledge of the
nature of students and the learning process, the function
of education in a changing society, and the management
of educational institutions in accordance with a modern
educational philosophy.
  Although the state requires that teachers have specialized preparation, the School of Education feels that its
responsibility is more than merely helping its students
meet legal specifications. It has built a program that best
prepares educators to assume qualified positions by setting standards high above requirements of state certification. To accomplish this, the School has drawn freely
upon the resources of the other schools of the University,
and in some cases, asked them to offer special courses for
the students of the School of Education.
  Students are carefully selected for the School, and those
who do qualify are helped to select the curriculum best
suited for them, and urged to consider fields where the
need for education workers is greatest.
  In addition to training, the School of Education, through
studies of educational problems, endeavors to advance the
frontiers of existing knowledge.
Audio visual aids is a required subject for students in the School of
Education before a permanent college certification is granted to teach
in Pennsylvania.                                    3

            What new developments can one predict for the future when
            already 1500 mile-an-hour flight is a reality and electronic com            puters can translate Russian faster than the best linguist. A few
            of the many new developments which appear in the future are:
              1. Electronic artificial sight.
              2. Solar and atomic power for "have-not" nations.
              3. Intercontinental communication which will transmit,
                 translate, and type the spoken word.
              4. The conquest of gravity and "free-flight."
              5. Roads which move as conveyor belts while the motorists
                 simply drive on or off the belt at interchanges.
              The schools of Engineering and Mines will be in the midst of
            the development activity which will make these new things
            available.

HOMECOMING HIGHLIGHTS FALL SEMESTER

“Three Blind Mice,” the efforts of Sigma Chi and Alpha Delta Pi took ﬁrst place
honors in the Float Parade, theme of which was nursery rhymes.

The quiet that settled over the campus after the
presidential election could aptly be called the
“calm before the storm”—~with the storm being
Homecoming Weekend, the social highlight of the
Fall semester.

Mother Goose held sway as the Homecoming
was ofﬁcially opened on Friday afternoon, the six-
teenth of November. Then, the ﬂoats and fronts
which every fraternity and sorority had been
working on so diligently for several weeks were put
on display. An overﬂow crowd of students and in-
terested spectators—including Mayor David L.
Lawrence—viewed the parade of nursery rhyme
characters.

Sigma Chi and Alpha Delta Pi combined to
build the winning ﬂoat featuring the famed “Three
Blind Mice.” Finishing closely behind the “trio of
sightless rodents” was Delta Delta Delta and
Delta Sigma Phi’s elaborate portrayal of “Old
King Cole.”

A huge bonﬁre was scheduled to highlight the
pep rally Friday night, but it was prematurely set
off and the rally—complete with refreshments and
dancing—took place in the cafeteria. Awards for
best house fronts were given to Alpha Delta Pi and
Sigma Chi to cap the evening of entertainment.

Saturday dawned cold and clear#a perfect day

All student engineer's studies do not take place in the classroom. A
senior electrical engineering lab group inspects the construction of a
high current transformer at the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company transformer plant.
The new Engineering Hall is the center of the student engineer's
classes. Included in the building are modern classrooms, laboratories,
a modern library, and a wind tunnel.
TECHNICAL EXPERTS FOR AN INDUSTRIAL MECCA
Originally the Schools of Engineering and Mines, the first such
schools west of the Alleghenies, were organized and operated
separately. Engineering degrees were first given in 1846 and the
School of Mines was set up in 1895. Since 1922, however, the
two have operated under the same administrative dean, although still retaining their own identities.
  Their location in such an industrial mecca as Pittsburgh gives
the Schools of Engineering and Mines an advantage most other
technical schools do not have. The direct contact between engineering teachers and engineers and officials of industry, and the
proximity of actual use of engineering techniques can only help
to boost the Schools to a high national ranking.
  In addition to merely teaching the students fundamental
sciences, techniques and principles of their field of specialization, the Schools endeavor to develop a questioning degree of
curiosity in their students and encourage them to contribute
through these skills to the welfare and improvement of our
society.
  Realizing that the engineer must also take his place as a member of the community, the Schools attempt to instill in the student the ability to analyze his problems not only on the scientific level, but from the social, economic, and human viewpoint.
  Engineering and Mines graduates are thus not only technical
experts, but men qualified as employers, teachers, and civic
leaders.

A new, modern, scientific library, located atop the Engineering Hall, provides a
comfortable atmosphere where the physical science and engineering students can
supplement class studies. The library contains books from the science-technology
library besides new volumes donated to the library.
Edward Gehhardt and Bill Patterson, metallurgical engineers, test a metal rod in
a tensile testing machine.
Housing the department of physics and many of
the engineering laboratories is Thaw Htall. The
building, one of the older land marks of Pitt, is
located adjacent to the new Engineering Hall.
An essential part of the engineer's studies consists of laboratory work, where the
engineer can gain valuable experience toward his future career. Don Agafon,
lioward Brewer, and Lowell Tarbett, all petroleum engineers, perform a test on a
core sample from a rock strata formation.

SCHOOL OF NURSING
            The bringing together of the Schools of the Health Professions
            at the University of Pittsburgh at a significant period in the de            velopment of health services in this country and throughout the
            world has presented a real challenge to students in nursing.
              We believe that health reflects the measure of man's control
            over his environment and makes possible the maximum devel            opment of each individual according to his capacity, his needs,
            and his interests. The responsibility for comprehensive health
            service is a joint one in which the nurse makes a unique contri            bution to the promotion of health, the prevention of disease,
            and the rehabilitation of the disabled.
              Graduates of the Pitt program will assist in the attainment
            of these health goals wherever they serve.
            Dr. Ruth Perkins Kuehn
            Dean of the School of Nursing
 

 

The judges of the Float Parade, headed by Mayor David L. Law- “Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary” was the work of Sigma Sigma Sigma
rence (third from left), were impressed with the ﬂoat creations of and Phi Kappa-
Pitt’s sororities and fraternities.

   

Second place honors in the Float Parade went to Delta Sigma Phi A Pitt student disguised as the traditional Army mule had his place
and Delta Delta Delta for “Old King Cole." in the parade, too. It reminded students of the Pitt-Army, Home-
coming football game the next day.

 

The best fraternity house front was Sigma Chis. The Sigs carried out Delta Tau Delta fraternity took second place in house fronts with
the theme “Old Woman Who Lived In A Shoe.” “Rub-a-Dub Dub.”

Students in Pitt's School of Nursing are taught all aspects of their profession. Operating room technique was an essential part of the
student nurse's program as these students found out by assisting in the "O. R." at Magee Hospital.
PITT NURSES WELL-ROUNDED COLLEGE WOMEN
The School of Nursing is the newest of all the University schools,
having been founded in September, 1939, an outgrowth of programs offered in the College and the School of Education.
  The purpose of the School of Nursing is simple--to prepare
college women to assume a practice as professional nurses. To
achieve this purpose, the training program is divided into two
branches, the basic professional program and the general program.
  The basic professional program consists of two years of general college work in natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This training, culminating in a Bachelor of Science degree
in Nursing, serves as a foundation for the advanced work in
nursing to come.
  The general program gives the graduates an opportunity to
enrich their background in general education and increases their
competency in basic nursing.
  Close cooperation is maintained between the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing, and a number of hospitals in
the Oakland Medical Center assist in furthering the program.
Annually at the Magee Hospital, 4500 births are viewed for
teaching purposes, and prenatal and postnatal clinics and classes
are provided.
  At the Children's Hospital, students are able to study diseases of infants and children, and at the Women's Hospital,
diseases peculiar to women.
  Students also receive clinical experience at the Eye and Ear
Hospital and at Western Psychiatric Institute, a division of
Pitt's School of Medicine.
Instruments in the Magee Hospital are kept in expert condition by the nurses.
Each instrument is washed and put in its place. Grace Todd demonstrates a
retractor to Gail Racy and Kathryn Wagener.

SCHOOL OF PHARMACY
              The inauguration of Chancellor Litchfield and the completion of
              the Schools of the Health Professions Building herald the open              ing of a "New Era" for students of Pharmacy.
                To meet the challenge of providing excellent students and
              alumni who will carry the fame of the University throughout
              the nation and the world, a program in cooperative education
              has been devised for the sister professions who make up the
              health care team.
                Living, studying, and working together while preparing for a
              satisfying career of srvice to mankind offers the opportunity
              for continued advances in improving the public's health after
              formal education has ended. This is an exciting possibility for
              all who are a part of the School of Pharmacy and the entire field
              of the health professions.
              Dr. Edward C. Reif
              Dean of the School of Pharmacy
COOPERATES WITH OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS
                                                            Although the Pharmacy School can trace its ancestry back
                                                            to the founding of the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy in
                                                            1878, it did not legally become a part of the University
                                                            until 1948. Since then it has risen to take its place as an
                                                            integral part of the Health Center along with the other
                                                            schools of the Health Professions.
                                                            In addition to equipping young men and women for suc.                     cessful careers in the field of pharmacy, the School also
                                                           seeks to establish the idea of cooperation with members of
                                                           other health professions, familiarize the student with the
                                                           principles of good business to make him economically
                                                           competent, and to enable the student to become profes                                                           sionally capable of contributing to advances of pharmacy
                                                           in the future.
                                                             To accomplish these aims, the School of Pharmacy has
                                                           initiated a program that creates a balance between scholas                                                             The School maintains a medicinal plant garden, a nat                                                           ural laboratory for the observation of drug plant growth.
                                                           Each year various species of drug and medicine yielding
                                        lplants are collected and studied by the undergraduate
                                                           students.
                                                             Junior and senior classes annually visit laboratories of
                                                           large drug manufacturers and observe the manufacturing,
                                                           standardization, and distribution of pharmaceutical prod                                          S                ucts on a large scale.
                                                             The Pharmacy School also makes use of a library, an
                                                     J     Alumni News Review, and a student council to turn out

Valuable experience is gained in the pharmacy laboratories. An         Although most pharmacies have all the prescriptions ever needed

SCHOOL OF RETAILING
              As Pitt enters a "New Era," our economy, too, is entering a
              new era-one in which distribution rather than production is
              destined to play the major role. The challenge of the future is
              not in our capacity to produce but in our capacity to distribute
              the almost unlimited production of our farms and factories.
                If our standard of living is to continue to improve, bold new
              concepts of distribution must be developed and applied. More
              and more young people will find their greatest chance for service
              and personal achievement in this area. Pitt's School of Retail              ing, which has pioneered in education and research in distribu              tion, will continue to further its development of college gradu              ates for the challenges of executive leadership in the "New Era"
              ahead.
              Dr. Albert B. Smith
              Dean of the School of Retailing
This retailing conference with Dean Smith indicates that even business problems have an occasional amusing slant.
ONLY GRADUATE RETAILING SCHOOL IN U.S.
"My Fair Lady" fashions of 1912 and their current fashion inspirations are discussed by the students and lecturer, Mrs. Mae Stern
(second from right).
The chief objective of the School of Retailing is to provide an
opportunity for men and women college graduates to prepare
themselves for positions of responsibility in the field of retailing
and in other fields in which the knowledge of retailing is an asset.
This objective is reached through a one-year program which
combines classroom work and in-store executive development.
Cooperating with the School in the program are prominent
stores in major eastern and midwestern cities.
   The initial beginnings of the School of Retailing reach back
 to the year 1918 when Pittsburgh retailers and educators first
 voiced the need for development of college graduates as junior
 executives of retailing. Since then, the School has expanded its
 activities from the original area of personnel to include all
 phases of retailing, and has developed into one of the country's
 foremost schools of retailing with world-wide recognition.
   From the modern nineteenth and twentieth floors of the
Cathedral of Learning are graduated some of the highest qualified young men and women who enter the world of retailing and
develop to become merchandising, advertising, personnel, management, and control executives.
  Graduates of the School earn the Master of Retailing degree.
They are trained to think like executives, to appreciate the responsibilities and problems -of the executive, and to work with
and for others. Students so trained rise quickly on the job and,
depending upon personal initiative, reach top positions in the
fast-moving world of retailing.
  Pitt has the distinction of having the only exclusively graduate School of Retailing.

                   GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
TO THE GRADUATE OF THE CLASS OF 1957
First, congratulations. As a representative of 47,000 other Pitt
alumni I'd like to tell you how pleased we are to have you be-.
come one of us.n
  To be an alumnus of a university after having been for four
years its student is perhaps a strange feeling. Inevitably the
first sense is of separation, of having completed the final phase
in a relationship which-no matter how pleasant or dear-is
no longer useful.
  Yet in truth there is no reason for this feeling. Pitt graduates
today are entering into a new relationship with their school,
not simply ending an old one. In the current thought at Pitt the
forming product, the student, and the finished product, the
alumnus, are both of major importance. The years ahead will
show this new role to all of us. Defining it will be a stimulation we can look forward to, now and in the future.

                                                            may enjoy the products. Mass production, however,

The many services that a bank performs require the
talents of a surprising variety of personnel, aside from
those with the obviously logical background of financial
training. Your education may very well be the perfect
background for one of the more than 20 well-paying
positions in a bank.
  One of.every five and a half banking employees is an
officer. A greater portion of graduates who pursue a
banking career attain the $7500 to $10,000 per year
bracket than those in any other business. These statistics
apply in many cases to both men and women in banking,
since 10% of banking officials are women.

  Banking is out ahead of most other fields in the
important matter of fringe benefits. The average bank
employee receives an additional $24 in fringe benefits for
every $100 in salary.
  A career in banking offers the opportunity to further
your education if you so desire. Many banks offer free
courses in money, credit, banking, economics, and other
allied subjects.
  Banking is a profession of prestige and respect. Few
fields offer the college graduate such opportunities. Look
ahead, weighing your talents and ambitions, and then
answer this question:
What about a banking career... for you?

The crowning moment during Homecoming was the selection of the
Queen. Above, Sally Johnson sponsored by Delta Tau Delta fra-
ternity walks to the center of the ﬁeld. Moments later it was an-
nounced that she was the Homecoming Queen.

 

Joe E. Brown was on hand to help Dolly McCabe, queen candidate
of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, off with her coat before half-time
ceremonies. ‘

for a football game, and Army made a perfect op-
ponent. Twelve hundred cadets accompanied the
Black Knights to Pittsburgh, and the precision
and ﬂowing power of their marching awed the
56,000 heavily bundled spectators. The game was
typical of those the Panthers played throughout
the year—they started slowly and gained mo-
mentum as the game progressed. The cadets
struck ﬁrst, and carried a one point lead into the
dressing room with them as the halftime ceremo-
nies began.

The performance of the fast-stepping Pitt band
at half-time proved once more that they are second
to none—but even old band alumni had to admit
that the spotlight wasn’t focused on the musicians

Sally Johnson was crowned by last year’s Homecoming Queen, Elea-
nor Leslie.

but on the vivacious Sally Johnson. Sally, repre-
senting Delta Tau Delta, was crowned Home-
coming Queen of 1956 to conclude the ceremonies.

In the second half the Panthers played the type
of ball everyone predicted they were capable of
playing. The ﬁnal score read 20-7, in favor of the
Blue and Gold.

Open houses all over the campus followed the
game and a formal dance in the Commons Room
featuring the music of Benny Benack and the West
Point Glee Club rounded out the weekend of en-
tertainment. By twelve o'clock the last cadet had
arrived at the depot to board the waiting train,
and Homecoming 1956 was a thing of the past.

It was a sleepy bus ride home from the Gator Bowl for many Pitt students who traveled to Jacksonville, Florida, for Pitt lost to Georgia Tech, 21 to 14.

HARBISON-WALKER REFRACTORIES
        keep pace with the atomic age
Refractories are needed for building the many
widely diversified types of furnaces used for
making steel, aluminum, copper, and other
metals, cement, glass, steam-generated power
and substantially all products vital to our
modern civilization and our national economy.
  The high temperatures and other severe
operating conditions which refractories must
withstand in service differ greatly among the
various industrial processes. Through research
and extensive application experience, HarbisonWalker has developed the kinds of refractories
best suited for each specific requirement. From
a mere dozen kinds of refractories made available to industry a half century ago, HarbisonWalker now produces more than four score
commercial types and classes. The proper
selection of these refractories for every particular application assures longest service life
and greatest operating economy.

Comparing life in 1956 to 1984-, Harriet Laby and Sandra Johnston
debated the values of romanticism today versus possible objec-
tivity 28 years hence.

BEAUX ARTS—L|FE
IN I956 ANDI984

From November 1956 to November 1984 is quite
a jump~—but thanks to Beaux Arts, freshman
women at Pitt made the rapid transition and de-
cided which of the two dates most suited their
fancy.

The theme of the annual Beaux Arts show was
Pitt-1984~and the narrator was Edward K. To-
morrow, the star of “See it Then.” Members of
various ﬁne arts organizations at Pitt portrayed
scenes that are common place now and scenes that
represented college life 28-years hence.

Members of Pitt Players presented scenes from
“Picnic,” representing 1956, and “Rossums Uni-
versal Robots,” representing the future; Men’s
. . .. Quartet sang present day and future songs; and
W4‘ * ’ ’ t I » members of Pitt dance groups did interpretations

. . , _ of modern and future dances. A debate between
Barbara Hoffman glves us a hint as to what the popular dance Wlll be in S d h d H . L b h .
1984. She is shown doing the “Spider Dance,” perhaps to prove “the woman an y J0 nston an arnet a y on t e merlts
is the more deadly of the two species)’ of each era concluded the events—and we returned

to Pitt and the waning year 1956.

   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 The 1957 Owl, published by and for the students of the University of Pitts burgh, was one year's work of a staff of 64. To these staffers I want to ex tend my sincere congratulations on a job well done. I can only say that of
 the four yearbook staffs at Pitt that I have had the privilege to work on,
 the 1957 staff worked the hardest, got the work done the quickest, and in
 my estimation put out the "best book ever."
   The 48 editorial staffers and the 16 business staffers who worked on the
 1957 Owl are listed at the left. To run through their names again and enu merate all their loyal services devoted to the Owl would take up an endless
 number of pages. I do want to take this opportunity, however, to say
 thanks to them for their time and services rendered and to call attention to
 some special services of staff members and contributors which should be
 accredited.
   First of all, I must say that Mazie Ann was a "true associate" editor.
 She knew the book from cover to cover and spent diligent hours reading
 copy and helping coordinate staff functions. I can never thank her enough;
 but "I'll spend my life trying!"
   Gene Reinbold was exactly what a business manager should be. He co operated in everything for the betterment of staff and yearbook. Gene's
 staff had the best communications of any yearbook business staff with the
 student body. This fact is evidenced by the increase of 1050 senior pictures
 in the book and an increase in sales.
   As the reader can see, a yearbook is mostly pictures. Special credit in this
 line goes to Bob Hawxhurst whose time and devotion to the book is more
 than one can add up. Bob's aerial photos of the campus which are in the
 front of the book and on the end sheets also deserve special merit. Thanks
 also goes to Bob's photo staff. Photogs such as Walt Sickles were the back bone of the book.
   Besides pictures, copy is important to the complete story of the school
 year. Al Pelaez, along with Chris Gillotti, deserve much thanks. They put
 in endless hours and always managed to meet the deadlines.
   To all staff writers, typists, section editors and their assistants, I can
 only commend their work most highly. It was nothing but exceptional.
   Thanks goes to Wm. J. Keller's and Jewell Gates, Don Messinger, and
Blair Schrecongost for the best in reproduction. Ralph Benz of S. K.
Smith Covers and Sam Fields of Delma Photo Studios cooperated wonderfully. On the local scene, I want to thank Fran Pray, Agnes Starrett, Jane
Shaw, Tom Coleman, Tom Jarrett, and Dean Biddle and the other faculty
and administration who contributed to our efforts in book publishing.
  Special credit goes to contributor Lou Halprin for his snow pictures
(pages 216 and 245) and Stewart Love and the Pittsburgh Press for the
picture of Pittsburgh with lights aglow (pages 398 and 399).
  To Dr. Donald E. Swarts, director of Student Publications, I am deeply
devoted. I feel that throughout my four years at Pitt I have learned much
through his guidance, not only as an advisor to an editor, but as man to
man.
  I want to thank, too, the University of Pittsburgh for giving me an education and a chance that only 50 other persons received-the chance to
serve Pitt as its yearbook editor for one year.
  There are two persons that I purposely saved last to thank, because I
owe them the most-thanks! I would like to thank my mother and father
the most. For they too helped in this yearbook production, if for no other
reason than they were behind me all the way. Thanks mom and dad, too,
for a job well done.

FINE ARTS— “VALUABLE PHASE
OF GENERAL EDUCATION PLAN"

“N ext to English, I feel that the fine arts are the most valuable phase of the general education
plan that we follow today.”

Professor Walter R. Hovey, the head of the Henry Clay Frick’s Fine Arts Department, went
on to support this statement by pointing out that the history of art establishes within itself a
relationship with philosophy mathematics, religion, psychology, science, and almost every other
branch of learning.

The Fine Arts Department, located on the seventh ﬂoor, contains one of the most complete
ﬁne arts libraries in the nation.

The exhibition gallery presents a new show every month. During the year the gallery presented,
among others, a national ceramic exhibition, a presentation of stage designs by Donald Oeu-
slager, New York’s foremost theatrical set designer, a combined show of poetry and painting, and
a review of Chinese and European handwriting.

Students took an active part in the exhibitions, too. Annual student art and photography
shows displayed the talents of Pitt’s student body.

The department is fortunate to have Virgil Cantini, nationally known artist, as an instructor.
In Mr. Cantini’s classes the students are not so much trained to be artists as they are led to
develop an understanding of art.

 

A student stops to look at the selection from the Chinese ceramic collection owned by Professor
Walter Read Hovey, on view in the foyer of the seventh ﬂoor.

brary on the seventh ﬂoor. The library contains 26,000 volumes,
23,000 slides, and 60,000 photographs of works of art from all organized and installed by the ﬁne arts honors majors.

SNOW BLANKETS CAMPUS—AND 'TWAS CHRISTMAS

at Christmas the student nurses at Pitt gather on the spiral stairway and around their eighteen foot Christmas tree in the lobby
of their residence to sing medleys of carols for their families and friends.

40

Each year

The Saturday before Christmas is a day that many children of Pitt alumni, faculty, and staff look forward to almost as much as the 25th.
That’s the day of the annual Children’s Christmas Party in Pitt’s massive Commons Room, when the small fry cut loose in those other-
wise digniﬁed surroundings. Here a few of the children react differently toward Santa Claus.

Midway through December the unusually warm winter weather
ended and the campus was shrouded in a blanket of white snow
—and it was Christmas. To the outside world, the University
looks like a serene place devoid of any activity during the
Christmas season. The huge cross on the Cathedral, the lighted
stained-glass windows of Heinz Chapel, the rolling, snow-
covered Cathedral lawn—all give the appearance of quiet and
calm. This was not the case, however. As usual, the University
was the center of bustling activity, just as it is throughout the
year.

Inside the Cathedral the spirit of Christmas prevailed. The
Commons Room was decorated with Christmas trees and yule
logs blazed away in the huge ﬁreplaces. The organ continually
played Christmas songs, and students gathered to sing carols
throughout the ﬁnal week of school. Other parts of the Cathedral
were given festive decorations too. The Nationality Rooms were
all decorated, each one depicting aspects of Christmas in the
various countries they represented. The Deans of Men and
Women completely decorated the eighth and twelfth ﬂoors, and
several other organizations added festive touches to their oﬂices.

The annual Christmas Commons Room Ball, featuring the
music of Baron Elliot and members of the Heinz Chapel Choir

41

officially opened the social aspects of the holiday. The Men’s
Glee Club and Women’s Choral presented their third annual
Christmas Concert in the Foster Memorial, and many organi-
zations sponsored Christmas parties.

But Christmas meant more at Pitt than fun and gaiety—it
was also a time to think of others less fortunate than us. Con-
sequently, many groups held parties for and gave gifts to the
poor children of the area and to orphans from nearby orphan-
ages. Other students went throughout the Oakland district
caroling and raising the spirits of all who heard them.

The last minute shoppers ﬁnished their chores, and it was
Christmas EveAand the University was for once as serene as it
actually appeared. A quiet seemed to encompass the whole
Oakland area—the icy streets were cold and barren. Only the
bells in St. Paul’s Cathedral broke the silence, tolling carols
through the night. Churches began to ﬁll for midnight services,
and organ music and singing drifted out of their open doors. At
no other time does the Oakland district appear so at rest, so
peaceful—and keeping watch over the whole scene was the
Cathedral, with its four white crosses seemingly suspended in
the heavens.

Couples pause after the Christmas Ball to look at the decorative
Christmas tree on Lily Court. A similar tree was also displayed on

Bigelow Court Sigma Chi and Zeta Tau Alpha were among the many fraternities and sorori-

ties to hold a Christmas party for children in Various communities. Bob Ros-

Students stretched and awed hut in the end most came up with popcorn balls thrown down from the balcony of the Commons Room

during the annual Christmas party.

Pitt pays a fitting Christmas tribute to the war torn country of Hungary, “memo-
rializing the heroic deeds of the students of Hungarian universities and the people
of Hungary.” Louise Lomnicki, president of WSCA, and Dave Bender, president
of Student Congress, place red and white Carnations in the Hungarian Nationality
Room during the Commons Boom Ball.

borough of Sigma Chi appears to be a good Santa to the chil-
dren of Stephen Foster Community Center in Lawrenceville.

 

Each year Sigma Kappa Phi, honorary modern language fraternity, holds a Christmas party and open house. A
part of their program this year included the German club’s presentation of “Die Anhetung der Hierten,” which
brought the Christ child into Pitt’s Christmas rejoicing.

GREEK WEEK—FUN AND REVELRY— OPEN TO ALL

Less than a week after Christmas vacation ended the
Greek element on campus lifted the lid on the ﬁfth annual
Greek Week. This affair strives to promote a better rela-
tionship between all sororities and fraternities on campus
and to strengthen their bonds through a fresh realization
of the interdependence of all groups.

The theme of this year’s Greek Week was comic strip
characters, and for a full week Peanuts, Gordo, Dick
Tracy, etc., held full sway over the entire student body.
But it was far more than just a week of fun and revelry.
Fraternity and sorority leaders also heard speakers discuss
“The Greek’s Role in the Future of Pitt’s Campus” and
attended chapel services at the Heinz Memorial Chapel.

The evenings, however, were devoted primarily to fun—
and no one was disappointed. Monday featured exchange
dinners between the fraternities and sororities and jazz at
the Delta Tau Delta and Phi Epsilon Pi houses, where
combos played for the enjoyment of Greeks and non-
Greeks alike.

On Wednesday night the Greeks tossed eggs, broke bal-
loons, donned potato sacks, played leapfrog, and engaged
in coed basketball at their annual Fun Night.

Thursday afternoon Greek chariots with elaborate car-
toon designs raced around the Schenley Oval. The Pi
Lambda-Tri Delt vehicle won ﬁrst prize for design with
its theme of “Gordo,” while the Delta Tau Delta-Kappa
Kappa Gamma chariot won the race. Phi Delt-Chi Omega’s
“Prince Valiant” took second place in both design and
speed.

That same evening at Clapp Hall, fraternity men did a
lot of talking at the annual I.F. Sling. Zola Levitt of Kappa
Nu won ﬁrst prize with a comic situation built around the
character of “L’il Abner.” Phi Gam’s Jack Hammond
took second place, and Don Compton of Sigma Chi came
in third.

Friday night the Greeks were in full voice as they took
part in the Greek Sing. The sorority half of the program
was won by Kappa Kappa Gamma with their rendition of
“It’s a Grand Night for Singing.” The Tri-Delts and the
ZTAs captured second and third place trophies respec-
tively. In the fraternity section the Phi Eps took ﬁrst
place with their version of “It Might As Well Be Spring,”
with Theta Chi and Delta Sigma Phi coming in second
and third respectively.

Following the Sing, Benny Benack and his orchestra
played for the Greek Week dance—and as Greek Week
came to an end, co-chairmen Benita Reingold and Larry
Fiedler and all their staff agreed that it was worth all the
effort.

Mary Ellen Overmier of Chi Omega seems to be in control of the ball in
this situation during the “l\rIaggie and Jiggs” basketball game at the F ield
House at Fun Night. That’s Dick Hopkins of Sigma Alpha Epsilon ap-
proaching Mary Ellen. The theme of Greek Week was comic strip characters.

Dancing and soft sounds were featured at the Phi Epsilon Pi (above)
and the Delta Tau Delta houses to kickoff Greek W eek. The jam

IOHS followed e change dinners a11d were open to the entire stu-
dent body as were all Greek Week events.

Race," during Fun Night.

Books, books, and more books confronted students in their last minute attempts to study for ﬁnal exams.

BOOKS AND STUDY MARK WEEK OF FINAL EXAMS

Just before the end of the ﬁrst semester the whole atmos-
phere of Pitt changed. Social and athletic events ground
to a halt and for a week ﬁnal exams were uppermost in
everyone’s mind.

The University during exam week bears little resem-
blance to Pitt at other times of the year. The usual loud
din of laughter and conversation in the tuck shops and
cafeteria was reduced to a low murmur, and the students

peered over the rims of their coffee cups at open textbooks
instead of the morning paper. Every available space for
studyingﬂthe libraries, the Commons Room, and the
lounges——was ﬁlled to capacity. Glances through open
classroom doors revealed students, heads bent low, writing
fervently Professors hurrying through the halls with blue
test booklets became a common sight. Anywhere you went
on campus you could see and hear evidence of ﬁnal exams.

Serious study was mirrored by many students as they crammed in preparation for “that big one.”

460 RECEIVE DEGREES
AT COMMENCEMENT

F or most of the student body, February 1 was nothing
more than another day of mid-semester vacation. How-
ever, to 302 undergraduates and 158 graduate students, it
Inarked the completion of years of hard work. February
Commencement. 1957, was held indoors at the Carnegie
Music Hall and marked the first commencement presided
over by Chancellor Edward H. Litehfield.

Dr. Ralph Bunehe, under-secretary of the United Na-
tions and the commencement speaker, received the honor-
ary degree doctor of civil laws. Dr. Charles B. Nutting, di-
rector of the Buhl Foundation, and Dr. Gaylord P. Harn-
well, pr . lent of the University of Pennsylvania, received

the honorary degree doctor of laws.

Dr. Bunche’s speech left a feeling of optimism with the
graduates, as he told them that “the world has never of-
fered greater opportunity for constructive efforts as it does
today.”

It was wonderful to be handed that diploma, but that
last look at the Cathedral did leave a lump in the throat.

Realizing that an exchange of ideas and thoughts between
the various cultures of the world is necessary for better
understanding between men, the University has founded
and fostered the Educational Exchange Program.

Through this program, deserving Pitt men and women
are selected for travel and study abroad. The awards are
limited to juniors, so that the recipients are able to return
to Pitt during their senior year and share their experiences
with the rest of the student body.

The 1.17‘. Council’s “S” Award enabled Bob McCabe to
study at Oxford, and at the same time, travel throughout
England. The EMITT Award—the Engineering and
Mines International Travel and Training Award*sent
Paul Thomas to the Highlands of Scotland. The Student
Hostess Award and the Vira Heinz Award, both given to
outstanding Nationality Rooms’ Hostesses, were won by
Carolyn Loeﬂier and Suzanne Roche, respectively. Both
travelled extensively in Europe. Two Nationality Room
Committees sponsored grants; Frances Hedges, who jour-
neyed through Scandinavia, received the Norwegian Room
Award, and Sue Biddle, who spent most of her time in
France and England, won the French Room Award.

THEINAUGUR»

The Inauguration of a "New Era” suggests change. Ed-
mund Spenser’s "ever whirling wheele of change” now
represents one of the principal characteristics of a free
society. Societies unreceptive to change are unresponsive
to their constantly emerging needs. The unresponsive
society has provided the milieu for the social, economic,
and political evils which through the centuries have
arisen to threaten the progress and freedom of mankind.

Education is no exception. The changes in education
since the founding of Pitt have completely revolutionized
educational thought and practice. The problems facing
higher education today will undoubtedly mean more ed-
ucational revolutions in the years ahead. Problems will
press upon us in quick succession and meeting them will
be the order of the day. More change will inevitably
result.

 

Educational exchange is represented in the chemistry de-
partment in the person of John Johns, a graduate assistant
from Wales. Concerning the exchange program, he said:
“It offers the invaluable experience of living with people of
other lands.”

EXCHANGE BRINGS
OTHERS TO PITT

Because trade of any kind is always a two-way
street, the Educational Exchange Program not
only makes it possible for Pitt students to travel
abroad, but it also makes provision for deserving
foreign students to come to Pitt. Here they earn
a degree and, more important, gain a clearer
understanding of what our nation represents.
They are then able to act as effective “goodwill
ambassadors” upon returning to their homelands.

From 62 foreign students and research fellows
in 1952, the exchange population at Pitt has sky-
rocketed to over 180 this year. Included in this
group are five faculty members and a member of
the administrative staff. These students come
from all parts of the globe; the group represents
40 countries. Thirty-ﬁve per cent of the foreign
exchange students are undergraduates.

Two factors have provided the impetus for the
increase during this period. First, the University
revised its policy concerning admission of under-
graduates from outside the United States, and
second, the School of Medicine began participa-
tion in educational exchange by appointing teach-
ing fellows and residents and interns from abroad
in the Medical Center hospitals

The students taking part in the Educational
Exchange Program are recipients of a wide diver-
sity of sponsorship. Although some ﬁnance their
own studies, many are sponsored by grants from
their own governments, from foundations, from
various church groups and private organizations,
and from the United States government.

Naree Rochanapurananda, Thailand’s representative to
the Pitt Nursing School, is sponsored by a grant from the
Thai Embassy in Washington. When asked if people have
trouble with her name, she smiled and replied: “Not at all.
Everyone just calls me Naree.”

Adriana Rossi, a graduate student in political science from
Argentina, is the recipient of a maintenance award from
the Pennsylvania Federation of Business and Professional
Women. She plans to enter the foreign service of her
country upon completion of her studies.

The only thing that Raja Chelliah, graduate student in
economics, ﬁnds Pitt lacking in is a “campus life.” Other-
wise the Indian awardee of a full United States government
grant feels Pitt compares favorably with any university in
the world.

Although she and her husband were eligible for scholarship
aid from their nation, Israel, Mrs. Zvi Miriam Westreich,
a straight “A” student in the college, refused the grant.
“We are able to support ourselves by working, and feel
the money can he used to help someone else.”

The year 1957 found many dances favorites of Pitt stu-
dents. Louis Levinson and Es Luterman “jump” to the
jitterbug at the Greek Week dance.

Benny Benack and his dance band supplied the music for
two Pitt dances this year, the Homecoming Week dance
and the Greek Week dance.

STUDENTS DANCE, “JUMP” TO MANY TUNES

Every dance of the school year had its bunnyhop, from the Kickoff dance
(above) to the Spring Formal.

58

Throughout the school year, students at Pitt were at-
tending dances‘ as often as excuses could be thought up
to hold them. It started when the beginning of the foot-
ball season warranted a Kickoff dance, an informal
gathering with disc jockey Art Pallan spinning records.
Fraternities and sororities put their Hellenic heads to-
gether and came up with the Greek Week dance that
featured Benny Benack and his group. At the Heart
Hop a queen was crowned, and at the Military Ball,
complete with reception line, another coed was coro-
nated.

No matter what the name was, all the dances resulted
in the same type of situations and problems. First,
and foremost, who to take? Whether the Sadie Haw-
kins style Heart Hop or the saner boy-ask-girl affairs,
there was still the telephone call, the “I wondered if
you weren’t doing anything Friday night, if . . .,” or
sometimes, desperately, the “Now wait a minute, be-
fore you do me any favors; just what does she look like?
. . .” And of course, the last minute rushing to get
dressed, whether jeans, a tux, or skirt and sweater,
and the familiar, “Dad, I’d like you to meet . . .”

But when even ‘the suavest had to laugh at the bunny-
hop, and everyone stopped to watch one talented couple
“jump,” and the music mellowed and every couple was
suddenly alone, all the trouble was worth it and “I
really had fun . . .” meant something.

Kay Koelsch and Angelo lﬂanolas Preferrul the Cha.Cha_ A waltz was more to the liking of Aline Chauvin and Tom Shepard at the

Heart Hop held in Carnegie l\’Iusic Hall.

The mambo had its popularity, too, as evidenced here by Joan
Bails and Herb Krayltz.

Jenny Hoﬁman and Paul Groff enioyed the samba.

Ann Greenlee (left), College freshman, was quite surprised when she heard
her name announced as the Queen of Hearts at the Heart Hop.

Disc jockey Art Pallan (right) always had enough records to ﬁll
student requests. He supplied the music at the Kickoff dance.

Some girls found it easier dancing with no shoes. A few girls at

the Mixer dance, held between semesters, explained: “It makes
for smoother dancing.”

The King and Queen of Hearts, Bob Stanborough and Ann
Greenlee, dance the first waltz after their crowning.

The Queen of the Military Ball, Lois Coss, College freshman, is escorted
through the honor guard by Victor Rockhill, basic Air Force cadet who
nominated her for Queen candidate.

A familiar part of any lVIilitary Ball is the reception line. Here
cadets had the opportunity to introduce their dates to the top
ranking cadet ofﬁcers of the Army and Air Force R.O.T.C.

More than 25,000 members of the University family were eligible for free polio shots. Some took

the shots by gritting teeth. . .

PITT MEDICAL FUTURE SECOND TO NONE

The widespread publicity given the Salk polio vaccine
made the nation acutely aware of a fact that the medical
profession has known for several years—the University
of Pittsburgh’s Medical School and research facilities are
second to none.

The importance of the discovery drew medical and news-
men from all over the world to Pittsburgh, and what they
saw amazed them. Within a four block area they saw
twenty-four buildings—including eight hospitals—Valued
at more than one-hundred million dollars all working to
free the world of sickness and disease. Within these build-
ings approximately 170,000 patients are treated annually
and hundreds of skilled researchers areworking to ﬁnd
new ways of eliminating disease. Also located within these

buildings are educational and laboratory facilities for all
of the health professions taught at the University.

The men who came to observe the new Vaccine S00]
realized that this was ju t a small part of the University’:
health program. Men equally talented as Dr. Jonas E.
Salk were busy working on cures for cancer, heart ailments,
mental health, and several other important projects.
These men worked tirelessly in relative obscurity using
the best equipment and materials that money could ob-
tain in an effort to accomplish their aims. It’s because of
men such as these that the University7s Medical Center
has grown and continues growing at such a rapid pace.
It, more than any other school within the University,
typifies the much heralded “New Era” at Pitt.

OWL HALL
OF FAME

fhe Owl feels that, upon graduation, certain deserving stu-
dents should be recognized and honored for the active part
they have taken in the life of the University. Although the
Owl realizes that there are many others who might fully as
well deserve the honor conferred upon these twelve men
and twelve women, it has accepted them as representative
of the best element of the graduating class.

The awardees are chosen by the Owl Hall of Fame Com-
mittee, consisting of six junior men, six junior women, six
members of the faculty, and one representative each from
the Dean of Men’s and Dean of Women’s office. From
their observation of the senior class, the committee selec-
ted those that they felt best represent the class, and who
will leave a lasting impression in the minds of the student
body. The Owl accepts their selections, and on these pages
present them.

The changes of a "New Era” do not mean an abandon-
ment of all that the past has given us. There are deep and
basic values to which we cling tenaciously. Pitt has much
in its background which makes us proud. The foundations
have been well laid; the "New Era” provides an oppor-
tunity for creative thinking and development on these
foundations.

Pitt is faced with the same problems which confront
most, if not all, of the colleges and universities of the
country. But Pitt will do more than adapt to its environ-
mental problems. Pitt has an opportunity which few in-
stitutions have because Pitt has new and exciting educa-
tional objectives. First, the trustees, faculty, and admin-
istration are working together to provide America with
another university of first rank. This is a deliberate and
calculated effort to advance Pitt to the forefront of

I‘ION OF A NEW ERA

American Education. Second, Pitt must offer specialized
programs which will be needed in a variety of areas but
are not now available. Finally, we must endeavor to create
a more closely integrated institution in which the disci-
plines supplement each other, undergird the professions
and support rigorous graduate training in both profes-
sional and research areas.

Through the decades, stability and change have
marched side by side in our universities thereby providing
the means for our rich intellectual heritage to be utilized
in the development of an educated people. By remem-
bering constantly that "the universe is change,” we will
continue to enrich this intellectual heritage and widen

goals of the "New Era."

Mark M Rubenstein

MR. PITT

Each year the Owl sees ﬁt to select from the gradu-
ating class a man and a woman student to bear
the titles Mr. and Miss Pitt. In the estimation of
the Owl, these two students typify the ideals that
a student may develop who ﬁnds a keen interest
in working for his school and with his fellow class-
mates.

Mr and Miss Pitt are two students among
many who have completed 16 years of learning—
learning which is like a river. At its first rising a
river is small and easily viewed, but as it ﬂows
onward it increases in breadth and depth, being
fed by a thousand smaller streams ﬂowing into it
on either side, until at length it pours its mighty
torrent into the ocean. So learning, which seemed
so small to us at the beginning——16 years ago—
ever increased in its range and scope, until even
today the greatest minds among us are unable to
comprehend it as a whole.

However, our learning throughout our school

years and specifically here at Pitt during the last
four years did not just stop with the textbook and
class lecture but extended itself into various ac-
tivities which brought about close friendships.

Life has many turning points, and we gradua-
ting seniors are at such a turning point now. What-
ever the future may hold in store for us, we can
always look back, however, to our years at Pitt~—
to years that were ﬁlled with friendships, accom-
plishments, and learning.

This year of those among us, the Owl has singled
out Mark M. Rubenstein (pre-medical, psy-
ehology major) and Cecelia M. Trower (elemen-
tary education major), who through their abilities,
interests, and developments have shown them-
selves worthy of the titles Mr. and Miss Pitt.

tempted to generate in uswpersonality leader-

owl’s choice of campus beauty

Just as Mr. Shakespeare described “a rose »by any other
name,” a pretty girl by any title is still a pretty girl. Fra-
ternity Sweetheart, Military Ball Queen, Homecoming
Queen, and all the other awards bestowed on the fairest of
the fair sex at Pitt have convinced the Owl that it, too,
should pay homage to a representative of beauty on campus.
For this purpose the Owl selects from the coed ranks one girl
it considers typical of all the pretty girls and dubs her “Miss
Owlette.”

For 1957 she is an 18 year old blonde, blue-eyed freshman
named Lois Coss. She is of Swedish descent, and like the cur-
rent crop of Swedish beauties, she is tall, well-constructed,
and loaded with sex-appeal. To her, the ideal man should
have “personality in preference to looks, ambition, and a
good sense of humor.”

“YEAR'S AT THE SPRING";
THE END, A BEGINNING

The cold, gray, dampness of winter gradually subsided and the
days grew longer and brighter—it was spring. Spring~a time for
new thoughts, new sentiments, new outlooks.

The oriental cherry trees scattered about the campus were
transformed almost overnight into gigantic bouquets of pink
blossoms, accenting the greenness of the meticulously cared for
lawns. The sweet smell of newly cut grass and the pungent odor of
fresh paint permeated the air. Temperate breezes played havoc
with brightly colored skirts and head scarfs. Baseball and the
chancellor's inauguration became the major topics of conversation
in the Oakland area. R.O.T.C. students marched in uncertain for-
mations on the Cathedral lawn. Students lounged in the noonday
sun.

It was a new year—a “New Era”—it was spring.

SPRING W'ORE ON, THE RESTLESS

THE FACULTY . . .
CORNERSTONE
OF A GREAT
UNIVERSITY

DEDI CA TION

Many things are necessary for the functioning of a
modern university. Buildings, books, equipment,
students——all are intricate parts of the mechanisms
that constantly turn in the processes of education.
Yet, integral to the whole scheme of a university is
its faculty.

Gathered together in the several buildings of this
University are men who bring knowledge of all lands,
of all languages, of all times. Gathered together are
men who bring a record of achievement in every
ﬁeld. The lecturer freshmen hear at eight-thirty
every morning is the author of a comprehensive
world history; the professor at the head of the round
table in the Polish room has been honored in the
court of Spain and throughout Latin America; the
teacher of Shakespeare scholars listens intently to a
sophomore’s halting attempt to deﬁne his interpre-
tation; the jovial man leaning on the lecturn has
seen his by-line above the biggest news stories of
his time. . . .

It is to these men—the faculty—all of whom have
achieved, some of whom have known fame, that this
book is dedicated. For these men the desire to learn
has never ceased. The inscription above the iron
gates to the Commons Room is as true of these
teachers as it is of the students who come to be
taught by them. "Here is eternal spring; for you the
very stars of heaven are new.”

NEW VISION OF PLACE
IN STUDENT ACTIVITIES
INCREASES STATURE

IN ACADEMIC FIELDS

Fraternities and sororities have, in the years past,
become increasingly conscious of their responsibil-
ities to the campus community. They have become
aware of their opportunities to serve other students
as well as their own members. With this new, mature
vision of their place in the world of student activities
comes increased stature in academic ﬁelds. In the
future their contributions to the University, as
planned in their own programs for providing housing,
promoting activities and contributing leadership,
will be even more valuable.

The University approves fully the academic and
social programs provided by the Greek Letter So-
cieties. The future of these programs is bright be-
cause the organizations, both on the national and on
the local level, have acquired added strength and
character by giving new meanings and new atten-
tion to their original high ideals. Students who have
developed enthusiasm and loyalty for such activities
will play a major role in the development of the
University of Pittsburgh.

ALPHA DELTA PI

To give their alumnae a chance to meet their ac-
tive Pitt s'sters, the Alpha Delta Pis began the
year with a party to honor them. From this they
turned their attention to Fall rushing and then to
the annual Kid party for their dates in November.
During the Christmas season, they held their an-
nual black and white formal.

Alpha Delta Pis were active in many phases of
Pitt life this year. Mary Johnson was a Very prom-
inent member of Pitt Players, and she also di-
rected the Panhellenic Choir. Annabel Fawcett
was a member of Mortar Board, and Marian
Mlay won the Chi’ Omega Scholarship for out-
standing undergraduate work in political sci-
ence. Both Marian and Annabel were members of
Pi Tau Phi. ii

Even with such a busy schedule, the Alpha
Delta Pis found time to sponsor a project to raise
money to aid crippled children.

Alpha Epsilon Phi found pleasure and purpose in
all of their group activities last year, but out-
standing in the mind of each member was the
chapter support of an “adopted” orphan. The
project served a two-fold purpose: in addition to
the opportunities it afforded the orphan, it helped

the AEPhis to reach their goals of developing a
strong esprit de corps, and of producing women of
personality, poise, and power. They are noted for
their character, culture, and charm.

In line with these purposes was the chapter’s
decision to give gifts for the cart in the children’s
ward of Monteﬁore Hospital. Participation in the
campus carnival activities with Phi Gamma‘Delta
fraternity provided fun and helped the AEPhis
to realize the third goal of their chapter, to make
Alpha Epsilon Phi a vital force on Pitt’s campus.

BETA SIGMA OMICRON

The Beta Sigma Omicrons were one step ahead of
the other sororities this Fall, for they had held a
summer vacation meeting at Conneaut Lake.
Here, the members cooperated in planning for the
numerous social affairs which they held through-
out the year. These included a hayride, a square-
dance, several bowling parties, a Christmas dance,
and the highlight of the year, the annual Spring
formal.

Certainly the Beta Sigma Omicrons have a
wide variety of interests and activities repre-
sented among their members. Their chapter roll
shows four senior mentors, three members of
Quax, a member of Alpha Epsilon Delta, mem-
bers of the Heinz Chapel Choir, Mortar Board,
Pi Tau Phi, and Quo Vadis.

The chapter was also active in working for the
Sneed Scholarship Fund, and also for their na-
tional philanthropy, the Pine Mountain Settle-
ment School.

CHI OMEGA

Each year the Owl honors the woman whom they
think most typiﬁes the ideals that the University
is trying to instill in its students by naming her
Miss Pitt. The fact that Chi Omegas have been
the recipients of this award for the last two years
is more than just a coincidence. It is tangible evi-
dence that the high standards the sorority strives
for are being attained by its members.

Activity could well be the key word for Chi
Omega. There is hardly an organization on cam-
pus which doesn’t include at least one Chi 0.
Among the more prominent Chi Os are Louise
Lomnicki, president of WSGA; Carolyn Loefﬂer,
recipient of a Nationality. Room trip to Europe
this past summer; and Eileen Jordan, Sweetheart
of Phi Delta Theta. The Chi Os, also, award an-
nually a scholarship to the outstanding woman
political science major and sponsor a faculty tea,
parent’s day dinner, and orphan’s party.

DELTA DELTA
DELTA

This year members of Delta Delta Delta held some
of the most important positions on Pitt’s campus.
Rosemary Ray led this group as editor of the Pitt
News. Close behind was Carole Vagnozzi, a mem-
ber of senior court and president of l\Iortar Board.
Rose Miller was president of ldaka, Pat Brown
and Marica Depew were members of Cwens, and
Frannie Miale was secretary of Block “P”.

As a group, the Tri Delts certainly have an en-
viable record. Dressed as angels, they won second
place in last year’s Greek Sing, and in cooperation
with Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, they won second
place for their Spring Carnival show and third
place for their front.

To round out their program, the Tri Delts gave
their time and services to several charitable or-
ganizations and also participated in an active so-
cial program.

Three Tri Delts check out for an evening of fun.

DELTA SIGMA PHI

In the ten years since Delta Sigma Phi has been
back on campus it has managed to achieve the
status of one of Pitt’s top fraternities. Proof of
this is the forty-one pledges they had last fall-
the highest number on campus.

The Delta Sigs have much more to offer pro-
spective members than their advantageous Loth-
rop Street location. They are among the most pro-
gressive and active fraternities at Pitt.

Last year the Delta Sigs captured eight tro-
phies in inter-fraternity competition, and never
ﬁnished lower than third in an athletic contest.
They also excel at non-athletic events. There’s
hardly an organization on campus which doesn’t
number a Delta Sig among its members.

Highlights of their social program are a Sailor’s
Ball, Founder’s Day Banquet, a formal Carna-
tion Ball, and sitting on the front porch watching
the nurses ascend the steps to their residence.

DELTA TAU DELTA

Another frat which apparently is proud of its
venerability is Delta Tau Delta—the oldest social
fraternity at Pitt. It has been an integral part of
the University since 1904.

A more active group of men would be hard to
ﬁnd. They annually hold an alumni dance, jazz
concerts, a Winter Weekend, at Spring Weekend,
and several lost weekends.

90

Their celebrated sports cars have done more
than provide the Delts transportation to various
social events, however. The Delts hold regular
panel discussions with alumni in various profes-
sional ﬁelds in an effort to help their members
adjust more rapidly from college life to the busi-
ness world.

The Delts say their purpose for existing is to
“develop a high standard of intellectual achieve-
ment in a closely knit group.” And, we might add,
to have a heluva time doing it.

These DZs seemed to be enjoying themselves as they wait for the driver.

The cause of all the excitement at the Delta Zeta
house this Fall certainly could be attributed to
two special awards which have recently been ac-
corded the chapter. Omicron chapter received the
Delta Zeta National Chapter award at last sum-
mer’s convention, and because they have won the
Panhellenic Scholarship Cup for the third con-
secutive year, they now have permanent posses-
sion of this coveted trophy.

The Delta Zetas never tire of hearing last year’s
Norwegian Scholarship winner, Fran Hedges, tell
of her summer travels, and they certainly don’t
mind shining the new trophies which were added
to the mantel last year during Greek Week in the
Greek Sing.

Individual members were honored at last year's
elections and on Tap Day, and this year, Delta
Zeta can boast of members of Cwens, Mortar

Board, Heinz Chapel Choir, and W. S.  A.

KAPPA ALPHA
THET A

The Thetas have two reasons for being proud of
this year°s chapter: ﬁrst, for the many honors
which have come to individual members, and
second, for the achievements of the chapter as a
whole.

This year Eloise France was president of Pan-
hellenic Council, aided by Chris Taylor as secre-
tary. As customs chairman, Ruthanne Sturges
helped to launch 250 Freshmen girls, and Kim
Harrison was kept busy as housing board chair-
man. Along the line of beauty, Gloria Kohl rep-
resented Pitt in the Football Festival at Berkeley,
California; Peggy Brooks was chosen Sweetheart
of Sigma Chi; Annamary Steves was Phi Gamma
Delta’s Sweetheart.

The entire chapter participated m the Home-
coming events with Phi Gamma Delta fraternity,
a Christmas orphan°s party, a party with the
Tech Thetas, and they concluded the year with a
spring formal at Mountain View Hotel.
