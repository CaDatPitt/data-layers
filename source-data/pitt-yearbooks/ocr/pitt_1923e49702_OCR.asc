           The class of 1922 had an unfortunate beginning in its organization, for it was
      ushered in during the war. At that time uniforms-both naval and army-pre      dominaled, and every effort was made to make the S. A. T. C. comfortable. The
      school assumed a military aspect--men were marched to and from classes, no
      communication was allowed with the co-eds, and the best the girls could do was to
      watch the boys marching up and down the hill from     the steps of State Hall.
      Then came the quarantine, during the influenza epidemic and it was not until
      December that the S. A. T. C. was mustered out and the R. O. T. C. replaced it.
      Regular classes were resumed on January 2, 1919, and the slow but gradual re      turn to normalcy began. Fraternities, forbidden during the war, began their ac      tivities, and enlivened things considerably.
           The freshmen girls, with Ann Peterson as president, were given their share
      of hazing at a party given by the Sophomore girls in the old School of Education
      Gymnasium-now in the realmn of kindling wood.
           Aside from the Sophomore Hop, of which Howard Krick was chairman, few
      affairs as a class were held.
           Alumni Hall was becoming a reality, and ground was broken for the new build      ing after a campaign to raise $300,000 was completed.
           With the coming of a Dean of Women, Miss Thrysa Amos, the need for a leader
      for the girls was realized. Through her efforts, the girls of the University have
      attained a new position, in campus activities.                                      1,
           During the Junior year, class activities began in earnest. Harvey Harmon was
      elected president; Cullen Gourley, vice-president, and Henry Angus, secretary and
J.   treasurer.
           Junior class dances were held throughout the year and reached a climax with
      the Junior Promenade. The Prom, under the leadership of Howard Krick, as
      chairman, assisted by Max Loevner, Carl Kingsbury, Harvey Harmon, Erson Ogg,
      C. A. F. James, Irene Horner, Willa Dorning and Carl Mulert, proved to be the most
      successful in years.
           The publication of the Junior Owl was another achievement. The editor-inr
      chief was Charles Williams and H. Oton Goodman was the business manager.
           Harvey Harmon was again elected president; Reynolds, vice-President; Angus,
      secretary; and John Mars, Treasurer. The president appointed the following chair      men of committees: Ring, Dorothy Fineman; social, Holgar Johnson; commence      ment, Dan Kovar; invitation W. H. Zeder; finance, Harold Moore and Publicity,
      C. R. Williams.
           It was planned to center most of the senior activities during Commencement
      week the first big event is the Senior Ball, held in May in the Schenley Hotel.
      Among the events scheduled are the celebration of Class Night, and Class Day, the
      Senior Smoker, and the girl's Card Party. The Senior Breakfast, an annual affair,
      will be held June 13, under the auspices of the W. S. G. A.

                          giistorg of Class'24.
     The Class of 1924 is a striking exception to the time worn maxim that "In
union there is strength." Its success and power as a factor in the University is
especIally commendable when one considers that the organization of the class has
suffered many reverses at the hand of Fate and Circumstance. In the Freshman
year the class was fortunate in having as a president William H. Rhody, a student
as capable of the office as he was popular with his fellow-classmen. His death was
mourned not only by his own class, but by all who knew him. The vice-president,
Samuel Samberg then assumed the office, and with the aid of the SecretaryTreasurer Frank Fleming, executed the affairs of the class for the remainder of the
year.
     At the beginning of the Sophomore year, Louis Abels was elected president,
but before the end of the first term he left school to enter business, and Bernard
Funk was elected to take his place, with Norman Wynn as vice-president and R. S
Christy as Secretary-Treasurer.
     The girls were separately organized, with Edna Vero president in the Freshman year and Claire McKay in the Sophomore. They held several teas and a
luncheon, but their most notable accomplishment was the enforcement of the hazing rules on Freshman girls. They carried this through more successfully than
any other class
     The class has shown a great deal of originality and initiative. They conceived the idea of becoming acquainted among themselves and building up a class
spirit by holding dances at the Heinz House during lunch hour, which was quite
an innovation in University social life. These "Baby Hops" as they have since
come to be called, have been held on an average of twice a month ever since, and
their popularity has never waned.
     Another idea which was organized by the Class of'24, and which we hope
will be a precedent for all future classes, was the "Emancipation Day" ceremony.
On the last day that Freshmen were required to comply with the Sophomore laws
they conducted an elaborate and solemn ceremony, the feature of which was the
burning of the "dink" caps. To the strains of Chopin's funeral march, six Freshmen draped in mourning black bore the casket containing those emblems of their
Freshman days, exituri. Followed by the whole class, manifesting proper grief,
they placed the casket on the funeral pyle erected for the occasion and while the
smoke from the fire slowly disappeared heavenward, appropriate speeches were
made by prominent members of the class, and by the'23 president.
     One most memorable incident of their Freshman career was the camnpus fight
featuring the hose as an effective weapon of attack. The power of the law and the
SoDhomnore Tribunal alike were offered no means of dignified retreat under this
liquid barrage.
    Of social functions there was but one during the Freshman year, a dance held
at the Rittenhouse in the spring. Three successful dances were held under the
auspices of the class during the Sophomore year: the "Pre-victory" dance, held at
the Knights of Columbus Hall October 21, the night before the Syracuse game; the
Sophomore Hop, held at the Schenley December 9, and a dance held late in the
spring at the Schenley.

                            Alpha (f4i gigma
    Alpha Chi Sigma is a professional chemical fraternity. Its members are students who intend to make some branch of pure or applied chemistry their profession, and are elected from the Sophomore, Junior, and Senior classes and from
among graduate students specializing in chemistry. A high standard of scholarship is requisite for membership. Its objects are to bring its members into closer
touch in a social as well as a professional way and to advance the science of
chemistry.
    The fraternity was founded at the University of Wisconsin in 1902. There are
now  thirty-three active chapters at institutions where strong departments of
chemistry or of chemical engineering exist. There are also ten professional alumni
chapters in various larger cities.

     Nu Sigma Nu, medical fraternity, was organized at the University of Michigan
in 1882. Delta Chapter received its charter in 1891 and became the first medical
fraternity at the, then Western University of Pennsylvania.
     It was not until 1900 that the chapter had permanent quarters. The headquarters were first near the old Medical School on Reardon Avenue. When the
school was moved to the campus the house became located at 3517-5th Ave.-later
to be moved to Melwood Street where the present home is located.
     The local chapter has given to the Profession 243 graduated doctors who for
the most part are located in Pittsburgh or the immediate vicinity. The National
Fraternity is well represented in the Class A schools with 35 chapters and a strong
Alumni and Active bodies.
    The chapter of itself must require high scholastic standing in the Medical
Schooi, out has not failed to emphasize the importance of activities on the campus
and the athletic field. No man is pledged until he has entered the mnedical school
and then only if his previous work has been satisfactory.

    In the fall of 1919 lines of students drawn from the high schools and prep
schools all over the country converged in a rushing surging group in State Hall.
Aftei many pushes and jams, after unraveling miles of red tape, after parting with
lots of Dad's cash each was duly enrolled as a Freshman in the University.
Though enrolled in many different schools and departments forces were already at
work that soon made a union necessary. Just as soon as the Sophomores began
their activities in enforcing the traditions of the old Uni the Freshmen saw that
they must unite to maintain their identity. As they cast about for a suitable leader
interest centered on the embryo football champion Tommy Holleran. Accordingly
Toniniy was elected at the fall election. Under his leadership the class was able to
not only preserve its identity but also to give good account of itself in school activities. To go over its roll of honor men and women.
     At the opening of the second year of its existence the class entered school with
the firm intention to make a name such as no other class up to that time had had.
With this in mind the leaders very early began to train up the incoming Freshman
in the way they should go. Many an unwary Frosh received a free hair-cut, many
a young gentleman was seen wearing his best's apron and boudoir cap, many a one
with a waste basket on his curly mop-all this because the Sophomores were resolved that the new students should become good Pittites. In the fall elections a
new management was put into offce. This time Dick Shrum was elevated to the
presidential chair. Under his sway it was decided to give the class of'23 a distinction that no other had enjoyed. This decision was to form a definite class organization with rules and Constitution to govern its actions. The new plan met with instant favor. The Constitution was drawn up and this was unanimously adopted by
the class. Organized with an efficient and active group of officers and committees  -i
the clas of'23 soon became a leader in class activities. With an interest in social
scholastic, and campus activities the second year soon passed and the 500 odd students found themselves ready for the high rank of Juniors.
     To carry on the new years work Russell Stahhnan was elected president. The
first big duty was to prepare for the annual Prom. Comments on this dance would
be superfluous. Its success under the management of Thornton McGovern has become a matter of history. Campus activities showed the names of more and more
of its members. On all sides we see the names of members of the class of'23
which names go down on the honor roll of the Uni. The mention of such names as
Holleran, Anderson, Bowser, Hewitt, Pie Williams, Stone, Nevin, Solof, Parkhill,
Hartnett, Taylor, Newlands, Stewart, Hipple, Fleming, and Zeigler, show the wide
variety of activities in which'23 excels.
   Twenty-three does not say that it is the best class ever in Pitt. It does not say
 this-it admits it. Many other classes have left the Alma Mater and each has
 proved its worth but as each has striven to prove better its predecessor so'23 has
 sought to build up a name that will endure long after our University has developed
 into the finest and best in the land. At all times old Uni will find the class of
 twenty-three a staunch supporter of any move in an onward direction. Our work
 in school will soon be over but our interest will last as long as
                       "Twin rivers forest bounded
                       "Meet and journey toward the sea"

     Phi Epsilon Pi was founded in the year 1902 at the University of New York.
Urged on by its progressive and democratic doctrines, its expansion was phenominal. In but a brief period it was ready to take an honored position in the fraternity world. Recognizing no barriers to any race or creed, social or political station, it opens its door to anyone who can measure up to its qualifications and
standards; and today, Phi Epsilon Pi enjoys the unique privilege of being the only
national fraternity in the country non-sectarian. Its aim is to promote an invisible
comradeship that strives both to make the individual less selfish; and to develop
the more inate of altruistic motives until the common welfare becomes a continual
source of intellectual enjoyment.
     Imbued with these very principles, Zeta Chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi was installed at the University of Pittsburgh on December 26, 1913 and since then has left
no stone unturned in its earnest endeavors to help place Pitt where it deserves to be.

gigma Alpha lu
    Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity was founded at the college of the city of New York
on November 6, 1909. In the short time of its existence the fraternity has grown
by leaps and bounds until today it has a membership of over twenty-five hundred
in twenty-seven chapters.
    The local Psi chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu, was installed December 6, 1919.
Its active chapter has been well represented in the activities of the University.
Football teams, baseball teams, basketball teams, track teams, swimming teams,
the Orchestra, the Cap and Gown Club and various other clubs have members of
Sigma Alpha Mu occupying prominent positions in their organization.

     The Signma Chi Fraternity was founded at Miami University, Oxford Ohio in
1855. It grew steadily until the Civil War when fraternity and college life in
general was paralyzed. During the war Sigma Chi had something that was unparalleled in the Greek world, an active chapter with the armies in the field. After
the war Sigma Chi recovered quickly and continued her progress and expansion.
    In 1909 Beta Theta chapter was installed at the University of Pittsburgh making the oldest national non-professional body on the campus. The young chapter
prospered and soon took a leading part in all school affairs, in athletics, scholarship. and other activities.

located at Northfield, Vermont. It was incorporated in 1888. The two most
prominent men in the organization were Arthur Chase'56, and George Freeman'57.

     Kappa Kappa Ganimma, the third women's Greek letter fraternity, was iounded
 at Monmouth, Illinois, October 13, 1870.
     It now ranks as the second largest organization of this sort, with a menbership of over nine thousand and alumnae chapters in over fifty cities.
     Conventions of the fraternity are held biennially. The next convention is to
be held at Glacier National Park. It is the custom that each chapter is visited at
least once each year by one of the members of the National Council. The chapters
are grouped into provinces which have special means of keeping in touch with each
other. The publication of a journal was authorized by the convention of 1881.
This was known as The Key and was the first journal published by a Womhn's
fraternity.
     Kappa Kappa Gamma, aside from the individual activities of the chapters, has
as a national organization established a Student's Aid Fund, giving scholarships
which are open not only to the members of the fraternity but to all college women.
It has also been active in philanthropic work, the most important being that of the
Bellevue Meudon, to which they contribute approximately $1,300.00 a year.
    Ganima Epsilon Chapter grew out of a local club, E. R. 0., started several
years ago. The charter was granted in 1919.

    Pi,kin Club was organized in 1914 by a group of 11 Student Volunteers. It
was named for Horace Tracy Pitkin, who was a martyr missionary to China. The
club has had a steady growth, until at the present time the membership is between
90 and 100. The meeting place is Shadyside Presbyterian Church and the lessons
are under the direction of Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr, who has been a great inspiration to the members. The book studied this year was "The Kingdom and the
Nations" by Erie M. North.

            The Young Men's Christian Association organized in 1911 by George M. Kirk
       has enlarged its field of service to the men of the University in many helpful and
       practical ways: helping them to attain the best in life, encouraging a larger ex       pression of Christianity in their every day life on the campus and in the class room,
;'     and has trained many students for lives of Christian service. the Association co       operates with the campus churches in uniting their members and others of the stu       dent oody in carrying out the purpose of the Association wherever they may be.
       The activities of the Association are directed by the student cabinet the officers of
       which are elected annually by the members of the Association. Each President ap,I j" pointing the other members of his cabinet. The general administration is vested
       in a committee of management composed of students, faculty, alumni and trustees
       of the University.
           The Y. M. C. A. Hut is the general social center for the men of the University.
       Facilities for study, recreation, letter writing, lunch room, check room, and general
       good fellowship attracts 800 to 900 students within is doors daily. Various
       classes, clubs, fraternities, and other student organizations use the Hut for their
       place of meeting.
           The inauguration of a Monday noon religious meeting met with general ap       proval by the men using the Hut. The state student conference will meet at Pitt
       in May, this is the first meeting in the history of the organization held in Western
       Pennsylvania. The first basketball banquet was so successful that it will continue
       to be an annual association activity. "The Y" extends special service to the in       coming freshman and foreign students of the University. 1200 copies of the "Y"
       hand book are distributed personally to the incoming students and a reception is

           For over twenty-five years the principle of student government has had a
       recognized place in American colleges, and for thirteen years an intercollegiate stu       dent-government association has been in existence in the eastern states. Only of
       late, however, has that principle been developed at the University of Pittsburgh.
       On March 3, 1920 the movement, which had been growing for some time, was given
       official sanction by the University Council; and on December 5 of the same year
       the organization, to be known as the Women's Self Government Association, was
       perfected by the women of the University. Since then its development has ad       vanced by rapid stages. Its membership is all-inclusive. Every woman student is
       ipso facto a member. Its purpose is three fold, to foster among its members a
       spirit of unity and loyalty to the University; to maintain high standards of academic'
       and social life; and to regulate all matters pertaining to the student life of its
       members.
           The entire membership is divided into eighteen units, which meet for purposes
       of discussion, information and recreation. All judicial powers are vested in a
       Senior Court; and both legislative and executive powers, in an Executive Board,
       which is comprised of the officers of the Association, together with the chairmen of
       committees and representatives from certain organizations.
           The Women's Self Government Association of the University of Pittsburgh
1.,    holds membership in the Intercollegiate Women's Self Government Association. In
       November of this year two delegates were sent to attend the annual sectional con       ference of this Association held at Simmons College, Boston.

    The Federal Board Club of the University of Pittsburgh was organized in the
month of October, nineteen hundred and nineteen, for the purpose of providing a
common ground upon which the disabled men of the Great War could meet and
keep fresh the spirit of their service life. Keep alive the ineniories of "the good
old days" and to tighten the bonds of interest and comradeship existing among the
disablied men at the University.
    To this end, Smokers are frequently held. Dances are popular and in fact any
event that will tend to draw the ex-service men closer together is made an occasion
for the men to become better acquainted and to promote the fraternal spirit. Meetings are called every Wednesday, in the school year, for the transaction of club
business, to inquire as to the needy members and to extend the fraternal hand in
their aid if the member is worthy and found in want.
    The organization has met with great success. In October, 1919 it consisted or
only twelve members. In October, 1921 there were one hundred and sixty menmbers in good standing.
    Dr. E. W. Hawkes, is at present co-ordinator for the Federal Board Men receiving training in the University.
    John A. Jordan, is at present president of the club. Howard E. Reppert, VicePresident and George E. McQuiston Secretary and Treasurer.

Alumni Artiuitirs
     The past year, (which means the year starting with the publication of the
1922 "Owl") was an eventful one, so far as alumni activities were concerned. "Alumni
Hall", the magnificent recitation building, which was presented to Alma Mater by
Pitt alumni and students, was occupied by classes March 28, 1921, the "House
Warming" being held there March 31, which was attended by hundreds of alumni.
When classes were started in "Alumni Hall," the first and second floors were complete and the third floor practically in the sanime shape. The entire building is now complete and occupied and, in the words of Chancellor Bowman "has been a life saver
for the University".
     Here's the official chronology of the building:
         First campaign, January 17-31, 1920.
         Ground broken, January 26, 1920.
         Corner stone laid June 9, 1920.
         Second Fund campaign January 1921.
         First and second floors occupied by classes March 28, 1921.
         House warming March 31, 1921.
         Third floor completed and entire building ready for occupancy
         Sept 12, 1921.
    The building is 322 feet long, with a depth of 52 feet and a height of 50
feet. The floor space comprises 50,232 square feet. There are four lecture rooms,
40 recitation rooms, 16 faculty rooms and 16 auxiliary rooms for engine, boiler,
locker, toilets, etc.
    The donors included over 2700 alumni and students. The cost was in excess of
$650,000. The oldest subscriber was Thomas Bakewell Kerr,'67, (now deceased).
and the youngest, Robert Wesley James,'40. The largest individual subscription was
from Joseph C. Trees,'95. The building Committee consisted of Floyd Rose,'96,
(Chairman), C. L. Wooldridge,'97, L. B. Hurst,'02 and Carlton G. Ketchum'16
The architect was Benno Janssen
                                  Membership
    The chart on the opposite page shows the membership of the General Alumni
Association over 4200 January 1. 1922. This shows an increase of 700 over the same
date in the previous year. All members of the Alumni Association receive "The Pitt
Weekly" regularly. Statistics show that there are few Alumni Associations in the
country which have as large a membership as this.
    Analysis of the membership shows that the 4200 or more members are divided
as follows: College 740, Pharmacy 673, Medicine 610, Dentistry 596, Engineering
579. Economics 442, Law 317, Education 282, Graduate School 43. Four hundred
and ninety two members of the Association are women. The geographical distribution
is as follows: 843 reside in Pittsburgh and vicinity, 1193 reside in Western Pennsylvania other than Pittsburgh and within a radius of 30 miles of Pittsburgh, 615 reside
in Pennsylvania outside of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, 580 reside in
states ouside of Pennsylvania, and 22 reside in foreign countries.

Alumni Artiuities-Continued
                                     SNew Alumni Groups
            Two important alumni groups were formed during the year which are working
       hand in hand with the General Alumni Association. The Engineering alumni
       organized what is kown as the "Pitt Engineering Club" at a meeting November 15.
       1921, the officers being as follows: Graham Bright,'97, president, W. M. Bradshaw,
'9, vice president, J. WV. Hallock,'12, secretary and treasurer. The Executive Com       mittee consists of A. L. Hoerr.'97, C. G. Fisher,'00, A. B. Kiser,'97, C. F. Ryman,
'20. C. L. Wooldridge,'97, H. G. Farmer,'11, Dean F. L. Bishop and C. L. Henry
'22. The objects of this association are to advance the interests of engineering and
       engineering education at Pitt, and to promote a better acquaintance and fellowship
       among Pitt engineers. To date the membership is around 400.
            The Medical Alumni also formed an association, th( officers being Dr. R. J.
       Behan, President, Dr. C. C. Marshall, Vice President, Dr. H. J. Benz, Secretary. and
       Dr. H. E. McGuire, treasurer. The Executive Committee consists of Doctors, E. A.
 S-~Weiss, E. E. Mayer, C. J. Vaux, J. W. Boyd, Harold A. Miller, J. H. Wagner, J. A.
       Jawkins, T. G. Jenny and Ralph V. Robinson. The Association held its first social
       event at the University Club January 26, 1922, at which time Dr. C. J. Vaux,'99,
       director of the Department of Public Health at Pittsburgh, and Dr. W. J. McGregor.
'11, Coroner of Allegheny County, were the honor guests. Several clinics were
       held under the direction of this organization during the year, the first one being
       held at the Magee Hospital February 15 and another at the Mercy Hospital April 11.
            The Dental Alumni also have a live organization, their annual clinic and banquet
       being held at the William Penn Hotel June 14, 1921, the program being a part of the
       Commencement activities.
                                  Alumnae Have Secretary
            The Alumnae of the University were given deserved recognition when Alumni
       Council approved the appointment of Miss Minnie Z. Buckley, College'15, Law'18,
       as Secretary of Women's Activities, she to be associated on the staff of the General
       Alumni Secretary. This action was taken at te Council meeting of March 15 1922.
       Miss Buckley's duties are to bring the alumnae into closer touch with the Univer       sity and the General Alumni Association, to cooperate with the Dean of Women of
       the University, to assist the General Secretary in the extension work, etc.
            Undergraduate activities were given additional alumni support in the appoint       ment of S. S. Hoehl,'15, as Graduate Manager of Non-athletic Activities. Mr. Hoehi
       occupies the same position, as regards activities other than athletics, as the Grad       uate Manager of Athletics does.
                                  The 1921 Commencement
           The Commencement activities of 1921 including the annual luncheon of the
       Engineering alumni at the Fort Pitt Hotel, June 14, with R. T. Stewart as honor guest.
       An "Alumni Carnival." held in Alumni Hall Friday, June 10, the annual "Sunset
       Dinner" of the Alumnae in the Heinz House, June 11; and the annual Alumni
       Banquet at the Hotel Schenley June 15. C. R. Foster,'11, was toastmaster at the
       banquet, the speakers being the Hon. George Wharton Pepper, Chancellor J. G.
       Bowman, A. W. Thompson, Chancellor Emeritus S. B. McCormick and R. A. McCrady,
       Chairman of Alumni Council. All the Commencement affairs were well attended and
       unusual enthusiasm prevailed.

             It might be possible, ii' one tried, to point out greater years in Pitt's athletic
        history than the year 1921. On the other hand it would be easily possible to name
        far worse ones. Taken as a whole, Pitt records in all branches of sport were so
        fine that, could they have been equalled by many of the large universities and  
        colleges of the country, they would have been singled out with great pride. fow         ever during the past seven years the records hung up by Panther teanls have been
        so unusually good that in comparison last year's records seem a little weak-that,
        in spite of the fact that in every branch of athletics Pitt teams won a big majority
        of their contests.
             The football team, captained by Tommn  Davies, proved itself almost as power        ful an aggregation as any of its predecessors and one of the leading elevens of the
        country, when teani-power alone is considered. However the record of five won,
        three lost, and one tie, in spite of the teanl's splendid showing against Syracuse,
        defeated 35-0, Penn, defeated 28-0, and Penn State, tied 0-0 and outplayed, repre        sents on paper the poorest season of any Panther grid team since Glenn Wa'rner
        assumed the coaching reigns.
             The 1921-22 floor team was coached by Andy Kerr, famous as a coach in all
        branches of athletics, and bids fair (this is written while the season is yet very
        young) to hang up the greatest record ever made by a Pitt basketball team. The
        team was captained by Lloyd Jordan, brilliant forward and one of the greate,st
        shots in college basketball.
             The 1921 baseball team, thanks to the excellent coaching of Dick Harley, had
        a very good season, although varsity baseball was still in its infancy since its
        revival. But six games were lost out of nineteen and the season was closed in a'
        blaze of glory with two victories over Penn State, till then supposed to have the
        greatest college team in the country.
             The track team also had a good season, although the team suffered from a
        dearth of good material. Frank Shea and Esler Hays were easily the stars of the
        team, each defeating at vari'ous times some of the best track men in the country.
            A record of three victories and one defeat in dual meets was made by the
        swimming teanm, which deserved to be ranked among the best college swimmning
        teams of the country. Pat Corr was the star of the team and mnade a real reputa        tion for himself throughout the east.
            The Tennis team had a fair season, winning four matches, losing four, and
        tying three, a tie match being played with Penn State in their only meeting.
j.J         The Freshni,an teams in the various branches of sport enjoyed wonderfully
        successful years. The 1921 football team ranked as probably the best freshman
        team in the east, going through the season without a defeat. The 1921 freshman
        basketball team had a record of sixteen victories out of eighteen games played,
        while the yearling track team broke even in two dual meets.

                        FRESHMAN FOOTBALL-1921
    The 1921 freshman team, coached again by Andy Kerr, could rightfully claim
the yearling championship of the east on the basis of the best record ever made by
a Pitt freshman eleven. Seven straight victories were annexed, without tie or
defeat  Three of the best first-year teams in the country were defeated, as was the
best prep school eleven.
    The high-marks of the record are the victories over the Syracuse, Cornell, and
Penn State freshman elevens and over Kiski. In addition West Virginia Freshmen, Slippery Rock Normal, and Bellefonte Academy encountered defeat. The
closest contest was that with the Syracuse freshman, the victory being by a margin
of but one point, a reversal of the year before when the Orange Cubs won by a
single point.
    The Cornell freshmen had a good team but were completely outclassed, 27 to
7. The Penn State Cubs were a team of recognized ability and a team always hard
to defeat on their own field, but that was accomplished, 14 to 6. The following
week, Kiski, who laid claim to the prep school championship of the east, was defeated, 9-0, a score which does not completely indicate the margin of the Panther
Cub's superiority.
    The freshman line was one of the largest in years and the backfield one of
the fastest and cleverest. The team was captained by "Hank" Hangartner, who not
only made a splendid leader but bids fair to become one of the greatest guards
in the history of the University. The rest of the line, Lewis, Carnahan, Ashbaugh,
Murdoch, and Akins all played fine and consistent football. The ends, Gwosden
and Frank, were big, strong, and fast, and deadly tacklers. The team   was
generaled by Bohren, who though small of stature is a great halfback, and Bruder
at the other half is equally as good. "Hoots" Flanagan was good at the quatterback position, while Johnson is one of the most promising fullbacks that has come
alopg for several years, being both a good line-plunger and punter. Moreover the
team was not lacking for strong substitutes, for it had them in' Bruckman, Evans,

                       enties Ierorb for 1921
    The interest shown by the mnembers of the 1921 team cannot be overestimated.
Being handicapped from the start by ineligibility rules, it was no e,asy matter for
Coach Stephens to pick a strong team.
    A team   composed of the following men, however. was selected; Greene
(Capt.), Pfeifer. Williams, Groomes, Beecher and Moulton. With a team of this
calibre such schools as Grove City, W. &amp; J., West Virginia University and Penn
State College were encountered.
    Of the eleven double matches played, Pitt won four, lost four and tied three
In addition, Pitt won twenty-six singles and lost sixteen.
    The outstanding feature of the season was the excellent playing done by
Pfeiter and Williams. Too much credit cannot be given these nien and it suffices
to say that they have both received their varsity letter and are back again this
season.

      Good Equipment is
      A Powerful Asset
 DO not view high grade equipment as a mere
      luxury nor as an item of expense; it is a sound
      investment, and next to your personal talents,
 your most valuable business asset. A first class oper ating outfit not only enables you to do your best, it
 inspires your best efforts, and it promotes the con fidence and respect of your patients.
 A complete S. S. White Equipment can be installed
 on a small initial cash payment and the balance may
 be paid from the current proceeds of your practice.
 The deferred payment plan will enable you to own an
 up-to-date equipment and start your practice right.
              Ask your dealer for details
                 or write us direct.

       ability, a comprehensive view of the business side of
       dentistry-the side that is related to "Dollars and
       Cents.
          Successful dentists are realizing the importance.
      of environment on their patients, and the psychologi      cal effect exerted on them by modern, pleasingly
      appointed offices, and up-to-date equipment.
          When you buy equipment for your office, select
      the kind that will give you the most efficient and
      lasting service; the kind that will save your time,
      and the time of your patients.

"OPPORTUNITY"
                Sa young man seeking Opportunity, George Westing                house turned his attention to the art of train control. His
                  subsequent invention of the Air Brake, regarded as the
         world's greatest single contribution to human safety, resulted in a
         remarkable period of railroad development and opened up a new
         field of industrial activ ity which has been occupied by the Westing         house Air Brake Company since 1869.
         Great as the growth of this industry has been, the opportunity for
         further development, and for the men who dcvote themselves to the
         work, seems still unlimited.
         The Westinghouse Air Brake Company looks to the engineering
         schools of America for recruits from which to select those who shall
         be entrusted with the future progress of the organization.  For the
         benefit oft those possessing the necessary requirements, a popular
         Special Apprenticeship Course in Air Brake Engineering is main         tained at the home plant in Wilmerding, Pa., the largest Air Brake
         manutictor\ in the world.  A representative of the Apprenticeship
         Department \will bc glad to explain this course and the advantages
         it holds.

                                      equally as butler or irate father.

                                       in her method that proves a saving grace.

to suspect "Bella donna." Bella donna, you
know means "fine young lady." Her power

know her to appreciate that. We can describe her in one little word- "clever".

"Why spend your time worrying when there

               favorite subject is math and it is rumored
               that he has discovered many new ways of
               working "calc" problems but the only
               trouble is, he never gets the right answer.
               Nevertheless "Bill" is one of our most
               conscientious workers and is bound to
               make good.
