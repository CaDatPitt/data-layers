DRAMATICS

TO YOU‘
at the top, where it is lonesome, we dedicate
our Owl.

We are told that, before you became one of us
at the University, you especially liked the fact
that two and two are four. lt was solid and
dependable. You could count upon it. After
some years, though, you came upon feelings
which the old arithmetic did not fit. The still
small Voice, for example, would not add up.
It was out of time and space. Thinking about _
this, you discovered that the voice was y_o_u at
your best moments. Yet what was it? After a
time you found that Raphael, too, hadheard
the Voice and had told about it with color, form,
and design. With his head full of the light of
stars, it seemed, he had put upon canvas the
sheer limits of kindness and of tenderness. To
you this became also solid and dependable, like
two and two are four. Yet Raphael seemed to
say: ”Be active, creative. In the good World,
do something.” You understood.

Many years have gone by since those days.
Great industries are here because of you. Bet-
ter schools, churches, hospitals, and scientific
research are here because of you. The nation,
as well as Pittsburgh, owes you much thankful-
ness.

For what you have done, we honor you, and
especially for what you have done for us at the
University, we honor and thank you. In this
spirit, we dedicate to you our Owl.

JOHN GABBERT BOWMAN

C /zzmcellor

Dr. John G. Bowman has been Chancellor of the University for
fourteen years. During these years, he has brought many material gains:
more students, the Cathedral of Learning, the Stadium, and six other
permanent University buildings. There have been, moreover, gains which
cannot be measured in Gothic spires and sixty-ton monoliths. The recep-
tion for parents each Fall has welded the school more closely to the com-
munity. Sincerity in Dr. Bowman’s relations with the students has lifted
their spirit and increased their confidence. And his efforts for more of
what, by understatement, is called good teaching, have raised the academic
standards of the University. Throughout the fourteen years Chancellor
Bowman has been at Pittsburgh the gains in ideals and the spiritual gains
have been constant. There have been the good things done which we
can clearly count, and beyond them there have been the unremembered,
day by day, inspirations from the Chancellor, by which we are all marching
into a brighter air.

wOmen’s fraternities on the campus. The purpose is to strengthen each fraternity through
a mutual exchange of ideas, to improve inter-fraternity relationships, to initiate programs of
work suﬂiciently large in scope, service, and appeal to give many girls Opportunity for exper-
ience in extra-curricular activities and to make such rules as are necessary for the best
interfraternity relationships.

Four years ago the Class of 1934 entered the University. Most of us had
the same illusions, ambitions, and aspirations that you have today. We
pictured ourselves as future statesmen guiding the nation, as poets explor-
ing the souls of men, or as engineers constructing improvements for human
progress. With these ideas in mind we began our careers at the University.
The campus atmosphere nurtured our unrestrained hopes. Travelling back
and forth from classes we gazed upon the Cathedral of Learning as it rose
fearlessly in the clouds above. The very power and force we need to com-
plete our dreams is embodied in its boundless strength. Living daily with-
in the shadows of its sublimity, we grasped its determination, its boldness,
and its daring. When the day was over, we left the campus but not the
University. Our city and our University are one; both have been created
by the same imaginative power and vital energy that makes Pittsburgh the
nation's industrial center. Together they startled the world. Pittsburgh,
the city, developed iron, steel, coal, glass, and aluminum, which made the
twentieth century possible. Pittsburgh, the University, develops creative
thought, exploring zeal, and an adventurous desire for learning. Life at
Pitt is full of the Pioneer spirit and enthusiasm of those who built our city.
As we leave to translate our energy into accomplishment and service, Pitt
has a personal meaning and significance to us. ”It's Our University" which
we hope you too may some day share with us.

GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

 

JOHN W. IlA1.LOCK,_ Secretary

The General Alumni Association is an organi7.a-
tion of more than twenty thousand graduates of the
various schools of the University.

As stated in its constitution, its object is “to pro-
mote the welfare and interests of the University of
Pittsburgh and its alumni, to foster close cooperation
between alumni and the University, and to support
and advance the cause of higher education.” The
Association does more than that—it provides oppor-
tunity for helpful fellowship; it promotes the friend-
ships and associations of student days; as an organi-
zation, it safeguards the interests of the Universit_v,
its faculty, students, and alumni. It is a great, con-
structive, civic force and every eligible individual
should align himself immediately upon graduation.

Members of the General Alumni Association auto-
matically become members of the constituent alumni
association representing the school from which they
were graduated. There are ten such constituent as-
sociations,—College, Engineering and Mines, Busi-
ness Administration, Medicine, Dentistry, Law,
Pharmacy, Downtown Division, Education and
Graduate Schools, and Alumnae. The General Alumni
Association holds only two stated meetings a year.
Constituent school associations meet frequently and
promote the distinctly professional relationships.

The governing body of the General Alumni As-
sociation is Alumni Council. This consists of three
elected delegates from each of the ten constituent
associations, three delegates from Pitt Clubs outside
of Allegheny County, and the elected officers of the
General Alumni Association. Alumni Council

Alumni Council to hold regular meetings and to
foster and perpetuate an interest in University
affairs. The oldest of these Clubs was formed in
1914. Clubs are now active or are in the process
of organization in Greensburg, johnstown, Butler,
Beaver Valley, New Castle, Altoona, Erie, Harris-
burg, Connellsville, Allentown, Scranton, Philadel-
phia, Newark, N.  New York City, Youngstown,
Steubenville, and Cleveland, Ohio, and Chicago,
Illinois.

The Pittsburgh Record is the oflicial publication
of the General Alumni Association. It is published
ﬁve times a year and is sent to all members in good
standing.

A Placement Bureau is operated by the secretary’:
ofﬁce, to assist in putting alumni in touch with pros-
pective employers. A very effective work has thus
far been done in this connection.

Other services rendered the University and alumni
by the General Alumni Association include special
privileges in securing tickets to athletic events un-
der University supervision; furnishing speakers for
Pitt Clubs and service organizations; assistance in or-
ganizing class reunions; interviewing secondary
school oﬂicials and prospective students; and many
distinctly personal services to individual alumni.

Dues in the General Alumni Association are $3.00
a year, payable _luly ﬁrst. These dues include a.
year’s subscription to the Pittsburgh Record; mem-
bership in one constituent school association (and to
a Pitt Club if the alumnus lives in a Club territory),
and all the general and special services mentioned.
Above all, the payment of the animal dues aligns the
alumnus with the organization which keeps him a
member of the University body as long as he remains.
in good standing.

The American lVIanagement Association is a national organization which was
founded in 1918 for the purpose of promoting the study of the Science of lVIanage—
ment. There are four divisions of the association, each of which divisions holds con-
ferences at which topics of special interest are discussed. The proceedings of these
conferences are published in pamphlet form to supplement the information of the
meetings and are issued to all members in their respective divisions. Two general
conventions are held each year—MidWestern in Autumn—and Eastern in Spring.
The association renders great service in assisting educational and other institutions
in interpreting the personnel needs of commerce and industry by maintaining recip-
rocal relations with them.

A schedule that included such teams as Washington and Jefferson, West Virginia, Navy,
Minnesota, Notre Dame, Centre, Duquesne, Nebraska, and Carnegie Tech is tough enough
for any major college in the country. When you consider that a coach has to meet this
competition minus such men as Heller, Dailey, Tormey, Cuba, Rcider, and company, you
have a good idea of the predicament that confronted Coach Jock Sutherland at the start
of the 1933 football season.

Washington and Jeﬂerson, minus their past glories, opened the Panther’s season before
a small stadium crowd. Walton was acting captain. Either the Panthers took this game
too lightly, or weren’t in proper shape is still a question, but the fact remains that for
ﬁfty-six minutes, the game was scoreless. With but four minutes left to play, Izzy Wein-
stock gave a preview of his season’s work by booting a ﬁeld goal from the thirty yard line.
Howdy O’Dell, sprinted through the entire President team to score the only touchdown of
the game. The ﬁnal score was 9 to 0.

 

LEROY L. LEWIS

A warm day, packed stands, and fanatical Mountaineers with
“the greatest team in years” proved the usual opposition for Jock
Sutherland’s machine. Johnny Meredith was acting captain,
and put on a great show on the line for the home folks. The
game was anything but all Pitt’s. Twice the Mountaineers drove
inside the Panther ten yard line but were held for downs. The
biggest Pitt scare came in the first quarter when Hogan’s punt
was blocked and recovered by West Virginia on the Pitt two
yard line. The Panther’s held. The first touchdown resulted
from some clever ball handling by Sebastian, Weinstock and
Q’Dell after a ()0 yard drive down the field. O’Dell and Weis-
enbaugh scored the other two touchdowns. O’Dell’s passing was
a feature of the game, as was the running of Weisenbaugh after
he was sent in to replace Weinstock, who had recovered Sebas-
tian’s fumble for the ﬁrst score.

Rip Miller’s Navy midshipmen were expected to provide
quite a bit of opposition for the undefeated Panthers, but the
game turned into a rout. The feature of the day, to the 40,000
speetatorstwas the introduction of a live Panther cub, “Jock”

for the oﬁicial University mascot.

HOWDY O’DELL

Clicking for the first time in the season, and showing some
good blocking and passing as well, the heavy Panther line crushed
the lighter Middies, and rolled up a 34 to 6 triumph. Suther-
land swept the bench clean in an effort to stop the scoring spree.
The Panthers scored their first touchdown in the second quarter
as a result of a ﬁfty yard pass from Sebastian to O’Dell. Wein-
stock went over from the two yard line, ﬁve plays later. The
Panthers scored three times in the third quarter. Weisenbaugh
counting twice, and Randour once. The ﬁnal Panther score was
made in the last few minutes of play when Shedlosky dove over
from the one foot line, with a third string line clearing the way.

Navy scored its lone touchdown in the last quarter, when
Chung Hoon raced around his own right end for seven yards and
the score. He failed on the try for point. Once more the
Panther kicking on points after touchdown was nearly perfect,

only one being missed on ﬁve attempts.

The undefeated ‘Panthers, somewhat “cocky” were reduced in size at Minneapolis on
October 21‘, when the unbeaten, but oft—tied Gopliers of Minnesota downed them, 7 to 3.
The Gophers scored in the ﬁrst quarter when Francis Lund, All-American halfback com-
pleted an underhand pass to T_enner, left end for 14. yards and a touchdown. Bevan place
kicked the extra point. The Panther score was the result of a ﬁeld goal by Izzy VI/einstock,
his second of the season. The Panthers outplayed the Gophers throughout the game, but
lost several scoring opportunities by fumbling within the ﬁve yard line twice.

For the first time since the recent resumption of athletic relations between Pitt and
Notre Danie, the Panthers were favored in the pre—game predictions to top the Irish, who
were suffering their worst season in years. Coach Sutherland announced so1ne drastic
changes in the lineup prior to the game, and sent in Dick Matesic to replace Mike Sebastian
at halfback, George Shotwell at center in place of the injured Kliskey, and Miller Munjas
at quarter.

Barely 20,000 people chanced, colds, pneumonia, and worse to see the Panthers and
Irish tangle at South Bend. O’Dell was acting captain for the Panthers, and from the
beginning, the Panther’s demonstrated superiority. Mike Sebastian, breaking into the
lineup in the second quarter, once more proved a Notre Dame menace as he raced 75
yards off tackle for the first touchdown. Howdy O’Dell gave Sebastian wonderful inter-
ference on the run, keeping three Irish tacklers away. The second and ﬁnal touchdown
came in the second quarter when the entire backﬁeld alternated in taking the ball eighty
yards down the ﬁeld. Both trys at
points were good, Notre Dame threatened only once, in the fourth quarter, but their threat

The “Praying Colonels” from Centre'college, evidently hadn’t brushed up on their
praying apparatus, or they would never have scheduled the Panthers. The game, scheduled
as a “breather” for the tired Panthers proved to be just that, and the only good thing about
the entire day as far as the Kentucky gentlemen were concerned, was the warm weather.

Bobby Hogan was appointed acting captain by Coach Sutherland for this game.
Centre made a serious threat to score in the first period when they completed two forward
passes to place the ball on Pitt’s seven yard line. Failing to gain through the line, the
Colonels tried the aerial route, and ﬁnally compromised on a try for ﬁeld goal, which was
incomplete. After that, the game was over as far as they were concerned.

The Panthers, using a passing and running attack advanced the ball to the Centre
three-yard line. O’Dell, who carried the ball over on an off tackle play, fumbled on the
goal line and Meredith recovered for the first score. In the same period “Heinie” Weisen—
baugh ran 15 yards for the second score. Matesic and Nicksick teamed up in a forward
passing combination to score two more touchdowns.

Matesic accounted for a score in the third period after a 15-yard run. Wilkens, sub-
stituting for Shotwell at center, intercepted a Centre pass and returned it 24. yards to the
Centre seven-yard line. Rector went through right guard for the ﬁnal Pitt score. The
reserves saw action for the greater part of the game, the varsity only being in action for
the first and a small part of the second quarter. The ﬁnal score was Pitt 37, Centre 0.

Armistice Day provided plenty of ﬁreworks when the Undefeated Duquesne Dukes
trooped into the stadium to attempt to gain the city football title from the defending Panthers.
More than 60,000 people jammed the Stadium for the game. The day was murky, and
snow and rain fell throughout the game.

The Panthers started a touchdown march early in the first quarter which terminated,
when acting captain Mike Sebastian’s,forward pass to O’Dell was incomplete over the
goal line._ In the second period, a Duke passing threat placed the ball on the Pitt 42
yard line. Nicolai’s ﬁeld goal was slightly low, a beautiful 60 yard place kick. Pitt lost
the ball on down early in the third quarter on the Duquesne 34.. However, Skladany re-
covered a Duke fumble, which gave the Panther’s possession on Duquesne’s 26 yard line.
Weinstock crashed through to the 15, but the Dukes took the ball on downs on their own
6. Penalties, mud, rain, and snow combined to make the ball game a see-saw affair, until
Matesie’s pass to O’Dell put the ball in scoring position on the Duke 17 yard line. Wein-
stock took the ball over from the seven yard line, standing up, and later kicked the extra
point for the only score of the game. The Duquesne winning streak was cracked, 7 to O.

lists as the Panthers handed Nebraska a 6 to 0, defeat, the score coming in the fourth
quarter on a pass from Shedlosky to Nicksick.

A sixty yard quick kick by Howdy O’Dell put Nebraska in a bad hole early in the
second quarter, as Bobby Timmons downed the ball on the two yard line. Sauer kept punt-
ing Nebraska out of danger until Mike Sebastian started playing the real Sebastian type of
football. Sebastian gave one of the finest exhibitions of ball carrying ever seen in the
Stadium. He was knocked out three times, but refused a substitution. He received a
tremendous ovation when he left the ﬁeld. The game was one sided, in spite of the low
score, the Panther’s dominating the play throughout.

TECH

 

Fourteen varsity gridders donned their football equipment for the last time on Thanks~
giving day, as Carnegie Tech, under Howard Harpster, made their annual try for the city
title. 40,000 people saw the Panthers sew up the city championship with a 16 to 0
victory. Joseph Skladany was acting captain.

A quick kick by Howdy O’Dell once more turned the tide toward the Panthers, and
it was only a matter of minutes until Weiscnbaugh started running wild, and the passes
started ﬁnding their marks. Bobby Hogan scored the ﬁrst touchdown on a Hat pass, for
the ﬁrst touchdown of his collegiate career. In the second half, Tiger Walton caught up
with Bill Spisak behind the Tartan goal line and threw him for a safety. Weinstock con-
tributed the remaining points by plunging for the score after intercepting a Tech pass.
He also added the extra points.

Compiling an enviable record that showed only three losses in 21 games and closing
the regular season in the midst of a thirteen-game victory streak, Pitt's Golden Panthers
enjoyed a highly successful basketball season for 1933-34. Coach Carlson started the
season with four regulars of last year back in the lineup but he was faced with the problem
of ﬁnding .1 forward to take over the position left vacant by the graduation of the stellar
Don Smith. It remained for Don McCamant to move up from his guard post and team
up with Skip Hughes as forwards. The rest of the lineup was certain at the beginning of
the season, Claire Cribbs playing his second year at center and Russ Ochsenhirt and Charley
Hughes rounding out their third year of varsity competition at the guards.

The Panthers again captured the Eastern Intercollegiate conference championship,
winning eight games and losing none in that league. The Cats also tied with Duquesne
in the city loop race, each team having two victories against one defeat. Highlights in
the Panther campaign were the shattering of Notre Dame’s 22-game victory list and a win
over the Irish in a return game later in the season, the victory over Duquesne’s Dukes in
the second game between the two rivals, and the splendid victory over the highly-touted
VVestminster Titans.

Wainio

Skip Hughes was the leading scorer for the Carlsonmen, getting 55 ﬁeld goals and 55
fouls for a total of 165 points in 21 games. Cribbs was second in the standings, although
he participated in only 16 contests. The Panthers rolled up 751 points for their season’s
total as against 585 which their opponents registered. Pitt’s total brings an average which
falls just short of 36 points per game.

Pitt tried a new system in electing captains for the season. The three seniors on the
squad, McCamant, C. Hughes, and Ochsenhirt, were named co-captains and alternated in
leading the team.

After the close of the regular season Carlson took his team to the Basketball Coaches’
national convention at Atlanta, Georgia, where they appeared in several exhibition games
with the DeKalb Teacher’s college.

P1'rT———34_ GEoRc1~:TowN—3 I

Before a crowd of 4,000, most of whom __had gathered to witness Dr. Carlson’s fourth
annual basketball clinic, the Panthers opened the season with a rather handy win over the
Hoyas. It took ten minutes for Cribbs to score the ﬁrst Pitt ﬁeld goal of the year but the
Panthers managed to hold a 14-13 lead at the half. Pitt ﬁnally got going in the second
half and controlled the game the rest ‘of the way. Ochsenhirt sparkled with 12 points while

Hargaden totaled a similar number for the Hoyas.

PITT—27 PURDUE—3 3

The Pitt midwestern trip opened with disaster. Although they paced the Boiler-
makers in the ﬁrst three-quarters of the game, the Panthers couldn’t hold out against the
superior reserve forces of Purdue. Cribbs played a ﬁne game throughout and led the Pitt
scorers with Don McCamant and Skip Hughes not far behind. The game was quite

rough and the Boilermakers practically won the contest at the foul line.

NoRTiIWEsTERN—23

P1'rT—27

Avenging last season’s loss togthe Purple, Pitt took over Northwestern after trailing most
of the game. Ochsenhirt again led the Panther attack and started the spurt which gained
victory. The game was exceedingly rough, more than 25 fouls being called on the two
teams. A weakness at the free-throw line kept the Panthers from an easier win.

PITT~—24. BUTLER-35
Playing their third game in four days, the Panthers were not able to stave oﬁ‘ the

attack of a strong Butler outﬁt and lost their second game of the midwest invasion.

P1TT—28 MINNEsoTA—23
Back again on the home iloor, the Panthers found Minnesota a tough opponent until
Ted Roderick, sophomore forward, entered the game in the last minutes of play and rang
up ﬁve points to insure the Pitt victory. Cribbs sparkled with a clever exhibition of shooting
throughout.
PITT-—27 OH1o STATE—18
Pitt ﬁnally appeared to be hitting on all cylinders and easily took over the Buckeyes.
Charley Hughes led the Panther procession with some ﬁne shots from under the basket.

Noon

Px’r’r--~35 TEM1>LE—3O
The Panther’s second win in the conference had all the earmarks of a football game.
The Owls tried to do battle with the oﬂicials and the Pitt ﬁve, with little success. Skip
Hughes counted 13 points for the Panthers while Brown starred for the Owls. A total
of 34. personal fouls were called.

P1T'r—z9 DUQUi~:sN1-:——3o
For the third time in succession a one-point jinx tripped up the Pitt quintet in a
whirlwind game with the Duquesne Dukes. Faced with a 10-point deﬁcit in the closing
moments of the game, the Cats all but made it up. An unmolested sleeper shot by Irv
Brenner was the margin of the Duke victory. Cribbs and Ochsenhirt played best for Pitt.

P1TT—44 CARNEGIE TECH 35

The second team started this one for Pitt and had to be rescued by the regulars after
the ﬁrst quarter. From then on it wasn’t much of a ball game. Cribbs led the scoring again
with 12 points.

PI'rT—39 NOTRE DAME——34

Making up a seven-point first half deﬁcit, the Panthers turned on the power in the
second half of the greatest game seen at the Stadium pavilion in years. A brilliant rally,
during which Skip Hughes counted seven points in rapid succession, dazzled the famed
“Moose” Krause and Company. Cribbs outplayed the Irish center throughout and was
largely responsible for ending the Notre Dame 22-game win streak.

PITT——4.2 WEs'r ViRcxN1A—2I

The Panther quintet hit a real stride against the Mountaineers and made the fair
West Virginia outfit look terrible in a sluggish game. Pitt led all the way and it required
eleven minutes for the Morgantowncrs to get a point.

PITT—6O WASHINGTON 8: JEFFERsoN—3 6

Once again the second team swung into action and they were enough to hand out to
W’ 8: J its customary shellacking. Wainio led the -scorers with 11 points as the adding ma-
chines worked far into the night.

P1'r'r—3 I DUQUEsNE—29
With Slim Wainio playing the hero role by bagging a brace of baskets in the ﬁnal
minutes. Pitt wrote ﬁnis to the Duquesne basketball jinx. Duquesnc appeared well on
the way to another triumph until Wainio entered the game and settled things.

224

P1TT—64 ARMY—1 8

The Army took another grand licking as only the Army can take them. Roderick ran
up a total of 14. points and both Skip Hughes and Cribbs accounted for 10 during the 15
minutes they played against the soldiers.

P1TT—-2 1 NOTRE DAME--I 7

Showing the good people of South Bend just what a real team looks like, the Panthers
coasted to victory over the Irish in a return game. Despite the absence of Charley Hughes,
Pitt put on a passing exhibition that had the Irish gasping.

PITT--3 2 WEsTM1NsTER—26

To settle a little matter of district basketball prowess, Pitt took on the Titans before a
record crowd. Once again the Panthers lagged in the first half, only to have Ochsenhirt,
Skip Hughes and Cribbs score baskets from all angles in the second period to win the ball
game. Ochsenhirt got 12 points, Cribbs II, and Hughes 6. Cribbs sustained a leg injury
late in the game which kept him out for the remainder of the season.

P1'rT—3 8 GEoRc;ETowN—27

Big Pete Noon, subbing for Cribbs, led the Pitt attack along with Ochsenhirt while the
Panthers downed the Hoyas,in easy fashion at Washington. Hargaden once more played
best for Georgetown.

P1TT—44. CARNEGIE TEcH——3o

Charley Hughes ﬁnally returned to the lineup as Pitt beat Tech in a listless game.
Skip Hughes had 12 points in the nineteenth straight Pitt win over the Skibos.

P1TT—38 'T'EM1;LE:34_

Rallying in the closing minutes of the game, Pitt snatched Victory away from an anxious
Owl quintet at Philadelphia. Don McCamant began the spurt to Victory with a ﬁeld goal
and a foul in the ﬁnal quarter.

P1TT—27 WEsT V1Rc1N1A—26

Throwing away many opportunities to win easily, the Panthers had a scare from the
lwountaineers until Wainio turned in another heroic two-pointer as the ﬁnal gun banged.

PxTT—4.0 WEs'rERN REsERvE—29

Pete Noon held the renowned Pontius in check while Skip Hughes was scoring 11
points and the Panthers had a rather easy time of it at Cleveland in their ﬁnal game of the
season.

LEE PAUL SIEG
Dem of the College

THE
COLLEGE

There is an old belief, older even than the precepts in the Scriptures,
to the eﬂiect that one who seeks a highly desired end may miss it, but one
who does not seek it too directly, may ﬁnd it. This idea, so it seems to me,
applies to collegiate study. If one goes to college with an idea that here
is a royal and direct road to success in life, or, with a less diffusive aim,
that here is surely a way to learn what is necessary about history, and
mathematics, and government, and all these other ﬁelds that make up our
civilization; if one does this, I say, I fear that he will really miss what he
is trying to ﬁnd.

One cannot say, “I am now going to allow myself four years
in which to become more resourceful, more appreciative, more toler-
ant-—in short, more wise.” No, it just is not to be done that way. One
must start at the beginning with a determination to approach the subject
that is before him with his own mind. He must attach to every statement
that he reads or hears a series of questions. VVhat he reads or hears may
be true, but he must doubt it long enough to satisfy himself that it ﬁts on
to his own mental background. Then he must go further—he must build
up his own new relations, new to him, at least. He must put all of him-
self into the matter at hand. If it is mathematics, he must see how the
author arrives a proofs; he must work the problems assigned but not stop
there; he must make up his own problems; he must reach out and formu-
late new relations. It is his mathematical ability that is being sounded.
Surely, just following the author, and doing what the author suggests is no
real education at all. Maybe he can never contribute much to any great
moment. No matter. His own thinking is the tiny grain of gold in the
vast pile of well nigh useless sand. Without that grain, there is little
education of any permanent value. And, so, at the end, one will have
reached his goal, without having steered directly toward it.

VARSITY AND FROSH
CROSS-COUNTRY

Coach Carl Olson got together another crack
varsity cross—country outﬁt last fall and the har-
riers swept through a diﬂicult campaign with
but one defeat. That lone setback was admin-
istered by a great Notre Dame aggregation led
by Bob King, Canadian Olympic champion.

Aside from participation in ﬁve dual meets,
Olson took his men to New York for the Inter-
collegiate Association meet and the Panthers en-
tered teams in the Allegheny Mountain associa-
tion’s meet here. Sam Musico led the Pitt har-
riers home in the former meet, capturing 29th
place. Kirkpatrick was 31st and Albright 37th.
In the latter meet Ken Wagenhouser won the
individual championship with a great exhibition
that stamped him as the best man on the Pitt
team. The Panther entry also won the team
title.

First Row: Albright, Kirkpatrick, Lawrence,
Musico, Wagenhouser, Watkins

At the close of the season Coach Olson recom-
mended letters for Wagenhouser, Kirkpatrick,
Musico, Albright, Watkins, Cook, Bill Lawrence,
honorary captain, and David De Marche, mana-
ger. Of this list, all will return for another sea-
son of competition with the exception of honor-
ary captain Lawrence and Watkins.

The combination of Albright, Wagenhouser,
Lawrence, Kirkpatrick, and Musico was too much
for the Westminster Titans in the opening meet
and these ﬁve boys crossed the ﬁnish line together
to account for a perfect cross-country score, I5-40.

Miami University’s Ohio conference champs
for 1932 did not fare much better against the
Panthers, Albright, Wagenhouser, Lawrence, and
Kirkpatrick ﬁnished in a dead heat for ﬁrst place.
The score was 19-36.

 

226

The following Saturday the Pitt harriers met the Irish cross—country team at South
Bend and subsequently lost their only meet. of the season. Wagenhouser ﬁnished a scant
yard behind Bob King to take second place. Pitt took fourth, sixth, eighth, and ninth
places for a score of 29 while Notre Dame Won out with 26.

The Panthers had little more than a breeze at West Virginia the following week.
Wagenhouser and Albright ﬁnished arm in arm for the ﬁrst two places while Kirkpatrick,
Albright, and Lawrence ﬁnished in the same manner for the next three, giving the Olson-
men another perfect score.

Carnegie Tech’s harriers furnished more of a test in the ﬁnal dual meet which was
run through ice and snow. Musico trailed Giolma, Tartan ace, to the ﬁnish line but the
Panthers managed to ﬁnish high enough in place standings to pull through with a 23-32 win.

The freshman harriers went their varsity brothers one better, going through a strenuous
campaign undefeated. Schenley, Peabody, Oliver, South Hills, Westinghouse, and Langley
high schools, and the West Virginia University frosh all fell before the little Panthers. The
last named dual meet was the closest call for Pitt, and the frosh took that one 22-33.

Harold Tost, brilliant Plumville, Pa., runner, was the ﬁrst man to ﬁnish for the frosh
in every meet. Only once was he defeated by an opponent, that loss being to a sensation,
Geclwalis, at the West Virginia meet. George Prosnik was second in places won, while
Radosevich, Leggin, and Beachler ﬁgured prominently in the list of triumphs.

Ballantyne

There is no doubt that the varsity swimming team of 1934 has surpassed any records
made by any of the past Pitt teams. This year’s team, besides winning the four scheduled
dual swimming meets, tied for first place in the Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming con-
ference, and won third place in the Eastern Swimming association championships. Besides
the collegiate contests, the Panther swimmers competed in seven Allegheny Mountain asso-
ciation swimming meets, in which they established three new championship records.

The Panthers won their conference meets easily enough. Carnegie Tech was defeated
52 to 20, the University of Delaware lost a 4.5 to 14. decision to the Pitt team, and Franklin
and Marshall college was defeated 44. to 27. Ohio State University was defeated 42 to
29, in the closest meet of the season. The ﬁnal event, the relay, decided the out-come of
the meet.

In every Allegheny Mountain association meet Coach Corr’s swimmers won most of
the events. Russell Lindberg set up a new 50-yard free style record, and won a 220,
and a I00-yard freestyle championship. Jack Denny also won a 220 crown. A new record
for 400-yard freestyle records was established by a Pitt team composed of Jack Hanna, Jack
Denny, Herman Adlersberg, and Russell Lindberg. A new 300-yard medley relay record
was made by Lindberg, Schmeiler, and Denny. In AMA Junior competition Joe Jones
won a 220-yard freestyle title.

This years squad was the largest and strongest teams ever coached by Pat Corr. The
team was well represented in every event. Charles Chambers, Herman Adlersberg, Paul
Stinner, and Joseph Madden swam the 50-yard freestyle races. Jack Denny, Russell Lind-
berg, Joe Jones and William Lewis specialized in the 220. John Carik and Joseph
Schmeiler were the team’s divers. In the 4.4.0-yard freestyle event Corr could call on Jack
Hanna and William Swazuk or Williani Lewis. Russell Lindberg, William Swazuk, and
Joe Jones fortiﬁed the Panthers in the backstroke event. Herman Aldersberg and Joseph
Schmeiler handled the breaststroking duties. Jack Denny, Joseph Madden, William Ruhe,
and Charles Chambers swam in the loo-yard freestyle event.

Considering the fact that this was the ﬁrst year that there has
been a Panther wrestling team since 1917 the season was quite suc-
cessful. A large number of students have taken an interest in the
sport, which may mean that in the next few years far better wrest-
lers will be turned out.

In the number of matches won and lost the Panthers finished
the season with 3. far better record than was expected. Going
through a four match schedule the Pitt team won two matches and
lost the same number. Carnegie Tech was defeated 31 to 5, and
Waynesburg was defeated 16 to 12. The strong VVest Virginia
team won a 26 to 10 point victory over the Panthers. Washington
and Jefferson won a close 21 to 13 point win by Virtue of a Panther
forfeit in the I75-pound weight class. The team also tied for first
place in a Junior Allegheny Mountain association championship
wrestling match.

The members of the squad are: Bradford Ilsley captain, Norman
Evans, Rhinehart Theissen, Paul Hinchberger, Albert Barr, Milli-ard
Cox, Arthur Willets, Mike Nicksick, and Arthur Detzel.

BOXING

 

First Row: Konick, Giannatti, Spiegel, Schricker, Thill, Carmella
Second Row: Orsini, Linderman, Long, Greene, Copp, Gongloﬂ, Tomarelli, Blair, Boydston

What started out to be a successful season for the Panther boxers later turned into
one of the most disastrous ever experienced by this sport.

The ﬁrst trials and work-outs saw more candidates out for the team than in any previous
year, but sickness, injuries, and the various other items that go to make up a varsity sport
cut the number down to such an extent that the boxers ﬁnished up their short season with
the unpromising record of one match won, two lost, and one cancelled.

The Panthers won their first match of the season from Temple, 4-3 at the pavilion.
However, the results of the next two, which were a 4-3 defeat by Duquesne, and a 6-1
defeat by West Virginia cancelled all the ‘good done by the ﬁrst victory. The scheduled
match with Washington and Jefferson was twice postponed, and ﬁnally cancelled.

The team usually consisted of Carmella, Thill, Giannatti, Konick, Schricker, and Kopp.
Bernie Spiegel, veteran welterweight, was only entered in one ﬁght, in the 155 pound
class. This marked the second successive season that Spiegel has failed to meet a man his
own weight. In every bout he has been in at Pitt, Spiegel has given away at least ten pounds.
Joe Kopp was the surprise package of the season, but a broken hand suffered in the Duquesne
match forced his withdrawal from competition after he had been undefeated in his two
ﬁghts.

Pitt failed to win or retain a title at the Conference championships at Morgantown,
with Carmella, Konick, and Giannatti losing in the semi-ﬁnals, and Captain Jack Schricker
losing his 155 pound title in the ﬁnals.

 

RIFLE TEAM

LT. ARTHUR WILSON

 

First Row: Hykes, Duﬁ”, Mastrucci, Davis, Weitershausen, Zoller
Second Row: Shapira, Vcogtly, Dixon, Gunther, Trumon, Miller, Dorrence

The Univ. of Pgh. varsity riﬂe team completed the most successful season since its
organization. The team won the sectional championship and placed ﬁfth in national
standing. Carnegie Tech and the Swiss Riﬂe Club were victims of the varsity riﬂers’
marksmanship in shoulder to shoulder matches in addition to a large majority of forty-ﬁve
or more schools.

Captain Zoller and Manager Davis were the high scorers of the team. The men to
receive letters were Davis,  C. Duff, Frabotta, Mastrucci, Weitershausen, and Zoller; it
was these men who represented Pitt in the national match while at the Uni. of Cinn. Upon
these men fell the burden of being the mainstays of the ROTC team which won the
Third Corps Area championship and the right to represent The Corps Area in the national
ﬁnals. Lieut. A. E. Wilson is the coach and is ably assisted by Serg’t. Gunter. This
is Lieut. Wilson’s last year at Pitt, and it is with regret that the varsity and ROTC teams
look upon his leaving. He will be missed greatly, but he predicts that next year’s team is
to be the best in the country. He also expresses the hope that more students will show
interest in the team and come out for it next year.

231

 

WOMEN'S

 

“Play for play’As sake” is the motto_used by the Co-eds at Pitt who are interested in
Athletics. Women’s Physical Educational activities are taken care of by three organizations:
Physical Educational Club of Pitt (P.E.P.), Daecs, and the Women’s Athletic Association
(W.A.A.). The P.E.P. Clul5’s membership is restricted to physical education majors. The
Club is well organized and entertains with many social functions throughout the year. Daec
is an honorary Physical Education Club that is relatively new at the University, but has
already made itself known by enforcing good standards for physical education majors.

 whose membership is open to any bona ﬁde woman stiudent at the University, is
one of the outstanding organizations on campus, and is known to all because of its ability to
promote friendly relationships with fellow students. By sponsoring ambitious sport programs
and enlisting student cooperations, W.A..'—\. has made it possible for hundreds of girls to
participate in athletics who would otherwise have been deprived of that opportunity. W.A.A.
has its social activities, also. The social calendar includes the Co-ed Prom, the Cabaret, Tea
Dances, Fall Sports Day, Winter Carnival, Dance Drama and Senior Farewell. W.A.A. was
organized in 1919 and has ever since retained its two-fold purpose, that of fostering clean
sportsmanship and promoting higher physical eﬂiciency among the women at Pitt.

 

ATHLETICS

In the spring of 1927, the Pitt Co-eds held their first Play Day. An equal number of
representatives from all the institutions of collegiate rank in this district took part. The
girls were placed upon teams irrespective of schools. So successful was it that  now
sponsors several annual Play days. The basic purpose of these Play Days is to eliminate
intercollegiate competition and foster a spirit of play.

In 1918-19 all the Wo1nen’s athletics were sponsored by one organization, “Women’s
Athletic Council, and just recently the plans of the Athletic Association are to again combine

the three organizations into one, the name not yet known.

TE) you who are about to enter-into the actual practice
of dentistry, the problems of locating, planning, and equip-
ping an office cannot seem other than momentous. They
are big problems; yet, years hence you will look back
upon this period with its perplexities as the most inter—
esting and fascinating of your whole career.

the light that it is an investment, an investment that will
bring return in ratio to the soundness of its quality and
completeness for modern dental practice.

Fin plan for the lﬂrara in Glam»

 AINFUL employment is not easily found after middle life. Fortunate is the
5" man or woman who can retire on a guaranteed income.

The surest form of self—pension is an Annuity contract with a strong life
insurance company. Acheck for an unfailing amount reaches you on time no
matter how long you live.

You can buy an Annuity outright if you have afund now available. If not,
purchase it on easy payments through our new RETIREMENT ANNUITY
POLICY.

Choose the age at which you intend to retire. Spread premium payments
over the intervening years. Regular saving is encouraged and you carry your
program through.

No investment problems, either now or in latter years. A high income yield,
not subject to reduction. '

No medical examinations.

131111 will want in knn1n—

What cash value if I withdraw? May I borrow all or part
of this? May I have a lump sum at retirementinstead of
the monthly income? Suppose I want to retire earlier than
the date at first selected? What happens if I do not live
to the retirement date? Or, if death occurs thereafter,
before I have received much income return? Is it possible
to add greater death benefits if I need life insurance
later? What provision is made if I should become entirely
disabled?

For each of these queries the policy has a good answer

T in the world are within the grasp of every dental grad-

uate. Ritter equipment, recognized by the entire dental
profession as the finest and most modern equipment manu-

long as three years if desired.

Think what this means to you—the possession of convenient,
modern equipment which will increase your operating
efficiency and create patient confidence and goodwill at
the very beginning of your professional career!

Forget the false economy of cheaper or second-hand
equipment. lnstall new, up-to-date, completely modern

itter equipment throughout your professional offices. lt's
the most profitable step you can take.

Plan to visit your nearest Ritter dealer as soon as convenient.
Have him explain how a small initial investment can com-
pletely equip your office with new, modern Ritter equip-
ment.

You will be surprised to learn just how economically you
can start out right with Ritter!

SCHOOL OF
BUSINESS
ADMINISTRATION

A. H. ARMBRUSTER
Acting Dean of the Sc/2001 of Bminerr Administration

The School of Business Administration endeavors to train young
men and women to understand the economic and business world. This it
does through courses both in the liberal arts and in economics and business.
The liberal arts courses furnish a broad background of general knowledge,
while the business courses stress economic principles. These courses in-
clude economic theory, corporation ﬁnance, labor problems, taxation,
transportation, industry, marketing, business law, accounting, and statistics.

The college graduate entering business Without some special prepara-
tion suffers a severe handicap. On the other hand, one who has conﬁned
his study to business subjects exclusively is scarcely less handicapped. The
program of the School, therefore, is a combination of both academic and
business subjects, so adjusted as to give students the equipment they need.

Since training in the details of particular positions in business must
come from experience, the curriculum is not designed to prepare students
for speciﬁc jobs. In fact the curriculum, although specialized, is more cul-
tural than vocational in aim. But as a result of the knowledge and disci-
pline offered by the School, a student’s progress in the business world will
be facilitated.

The School of Business Administration endeavors to cultivate in stu-
dents those qualities of mind and character which will make them useful
citizens, imbued with high ideals of business morality and social responsi-
bility.

SCHOOL OF
EDUCATION

LEE PAUL SIEG
Acting Dam of the Sc/zaol of Education

Wliy do you want to be a teacher? Is it a job you are looking for,
a refuge from the nightmare of unemployment? Is it a temporary port in
a storm, to be left when the skies clear? Or is there something in you
that drives you to make teaching your profession, not because it is a job
or a temporary haven, but because that is going to be your Way to a happy
and useful life? Every prospective teacher should really ask himself and
answer these questions. In the answers may lie the key to whether or not
the career of teaching is the right one—right for the asker of the question,
but more essentially, right and just for those who are to be taught.

To be a good teacher one must be a good student; that is, a person
who knows that education is not something to give to another, or to put on
another like a coat of enamel. If the teacher is not a genuine student how
can he hope to lead others to be genuine students? That question reveals
the setting for many a vicious circle.. A teacher, himself not really edu-
cated, teaches others, who, in turn grow up and teach still others. Educa-
tion has a slim chance to break into that closed circle.

But the teacher must be something else than a good student. He
must want to be a teacher, not for trivial reasons, but because he is happiest
when he sees himself, in his mind’s eye, working with young people who
want to learn. He must have the kind of personality that all of us value
in our good friends and neighbors. I need not list the qualities which go
into that personality, for the world is pretty well agreed upon them. Pos-
sibly the phrase, a cultured gentleman or lady brings to mind what we
instinctively would demand.

So the particular course of study provided in any school of education
although of considerable importance is not a matter that will in itself deter-
mine the quality of its product. These other qualities that can contribute
to success lie largely in the student himself. Do you have them?

Dean of 2‘,/ze Sc/zool of Evzgiizeering and Mine:

The Schools of Engineering and Mines, by means of a deﬁnite four

engineering point of view. There are eleven professional departments in

A student graduating in any branch of engineering has taken about
one quarter of his college work in this branch. The other three quarters
he has devoted to a broad training in the sciences, mathematics, English,
business subjects, and electives. Our objective is to give him a broad
college training and at the same time to give him the essentials of and a
particular interest in his chosen profession. VVith this preparation he can
pursue his professional studies further and develop into a professional en-
gineer. The majority of graduates, however, enter industry directly in a
wide field of opportunity. They are equipped with knowledge, habits, and
training on which to build their advancement.

SCHOOL OF
PHARMACY

C. LEONARD O’CoNNELL
Dean of t/ze Sc/zool of P/zarmzzcy

The School of Pharmacy has for its chief purpose the task of equip-
ping young men and Women with proper backgrounds for successful
careers in the profession of pharmacy. While the essential purpose of the
course is to provide a specialized training for a speciﬁc Vocation yet the
curriculum also affords a Wealth of subject matter especially general in
nature.

Pharmacy is an art as well as a science. Actually the pharmacist is
judged by the public in terms of his ability to perform satisfactorily the
duties of his calling. Consequently the school places a steady emphasis
upon the necessity of the student developing considerable quality in the
art of applying in his manual technique the principles upon which the
science of pharmacy is based.

The School of Pharmacy always keeps in a true focus the central fact
that a school is measured and should be measured in terms of its products,
the graduates. To produce graduates of the capacity that will satisfy the
demands of a discriminating public and that will endeavor to develop their
potentialities to the full is the chief business of the School of Pharmacy.

Paradoxically my ﬁve years participation in extra-curricular activities
have convinced me that there are no such things as extra-curricular activ-
ities. Time and tradition have played an important role in designating
those activities in which the student plays a part outside the classroom as
extra-curricular in nature, but to me those activities are a vital and integral
part of a well—rounded curriculum. We assume that the college student
has come to college for the purpose of furthering his education. If this
is true the student ought not to overlook those experiences which may be
encountered outside the classroom, for, in the larger sense, education is
merely the cumulative effect of a series of experiences. It is in the classroom
that the stimulus for creative thinking ought to be instilled; it is outside
the classroom that the creative thinking ought to be applied. Any in-
structor who fails to provide that stimulus is failing in his purpose; any
student who feels that stimulus an_d fails to respond is not furthering his
education. It is in the so-called extra-curricular activities that the stu-
dent has a natural outlet for this type of thinking while in school, and it is
in these activities that he has a splendid opportunity to add further color
to his education, to give himself a keener appreciation of education, and to
add grace and beauty to his personality.

“VVith all the rights and privileges pertaining thereto” is a classic
phrase in the conferring of academic degrees. What are the rights and
privileges of the degree each of you will receive? My great hope is that
you will consider them to be the increase of culture in your own life, and
in the life of the World in which you move, because love of culture has been
instilled in you through your association at the University of Pittsburgh.

90

You seniors have had the advantage of four years of education at a
time when positions were most diﬂicult, if not impossible, to obtain. You
will start testing the value of this education at a time that needs you at your
best.

VVhile conditions are diﬂicult for recent graduates to start earning
a living, yet at the same time, this period offers one of the greatest oppor-
tunities in history for able young men and women. People are now con-
sidered old at forty because they are often unable to keep themselves
adjusted to rapidly changing conditions. Young men are called to positions
of responsibility today that would have been unthinkable twenty years ago.
It should be remembered, however, that responsible positions are never
open to the mediocre.

Failure on the part of college graduates to succeed is most often the
result of failure to relate the principles learned in school to the problems
of the job at hand. Those of you who have learned to think objectively
with truth as your goal will ﬁnd that while life requires the best you have
at all times, it will be ﬁlled with so much of interest that making a living
becomes a by-product of living itself.

The other day I received a letter from a classmate of mine living in
Venezuela. He writes, “In looking through the 1926 Owl, I noticed
your picture and knowing you were at the University, I thought I would
write you and let you know what a great kick I get out of leaﬁng through
our Owl. The pictures open for me a great ﬂood of pleasant recollections,
and believe me one is in need of pleasant recollections down here.”

I hope the I934. Owl will serve you in the same way the 1926 Owl
served my friend. The Owl is a record of one of the best periods of
your life. As the years go by may it serve to keep burning in your heart a
love and loyalty to your Alma Mater and keep alive the most cherished of
all possessions, friendship.
