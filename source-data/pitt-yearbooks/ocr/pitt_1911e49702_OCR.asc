P from the heart. of things Thou hast. risen, my beautiful mother,
Born with the nation, in ftrife of Freedom’s travail and tears,
Formed of the new-world ftuff and the breath of the great. Primeval,
Strong in the valiant. thews and the heart. of the Pioneers.

<0-6
Blessed are they of old appointed by God for thy keeping, ‘
Men of the larger life, world-fculptors, captains, feers
Of the time to be, in thy wilderness birth forseeing
Fruits of this perfect tree, glory of coming years.

Up through forrow and toil Thou hast. itruggled, my beautiful mother,

Life wars, lures of the dust, pangs of becoming, ﬂashes

Of world-hate conquered and broken, twice purged by reﬁning ﬁres
Phaanix-like, dowered with truth, Thou hast. risen in itrength from the ashes.

grow and bloom the fruits of the

GEORGE HENRY BAILEY, Dickson City.
East Stroudsburg Normal School, 1908. Class President, ’08.

Varsity Football.

A man with a future as well as
a past and successful in every-
thing from politics to graft.
Strenuous in athletics and society.
Won the heart of the coach by
his enthusiasm, but set the man-
ager crazy by insistent demands
for new stockings and other foot-
ball accessories which he uses to
delight the ladies. When so dis-
posed he can play in star style,
especially in the presence of the
fair sex.

 

ROBERT BOTHWELL CHAPMAN, Pittsburg.

Laughs now and then, mostly
then. He stays up all night try-
ing to ‘do the school justice, but
has a hard time of it. Never
known to use a pony or like ani-
mal. Possesses his own corner in
the lecture room, over which he
claims absolute rule; all persons
are warned not to attempt to in-
terfere with Robert’s sovereign
rights when he has a corner on
things. Chappie is a good fellow
but so backward that he gets off
the car like a woman.

 

NORMAN JOHN BUDD, Pittsburg.
Varsity Football. \IIﬂ. Basket Ball.

Bill is a sawed—olT, fair-faced
fellow and a rough house artist
who can break the horns of a
cow. He has a cheery smile and
a happy-go-lucky swing that con-
vinces all the girls that he is the
A1 of the bunch. If Budd con-
tinues to grow he will become
quite a ﬂower of chivalry. Quite
a‘ blooming fellow, y’know. He
is unable to understand why the
authorities fail to recognize his
genius, but it is probably because
he is too easy—going.

Base Ball.

 

CLYDE PORTER CHURCH, Littleton, W. Va.
West Virginia University. AEA.

A sly young thing. W'ith a
rather sober, earnest face and the
disposition of an ingenue. “Sober”
drifted to Pittsburg from West
Virginia, but still has a fancy for
snake charmers. Can get more
out of a dry town than any other
fellow in school. During spare
time he eats, drinks, studies (?)
and tells those things for which
he is famous. The one bright par-
ticular star of Littleton and gen-
eral hope of the town.

“Dago” is a brown—eyed devotee
to my Lady Nicotine. -Has a nerv—
ous past and a never—ceasing won-
der at the greatness of Pittsburg.
Ever ready to talk politics and au-
tomobiles. No rough house or
political meeting is.con1plete with-
out him. Helps to make life worth
living in this vale of tears. Pres-
ident of the lady fussers, but a
good, all—around fellow who will
stick closer than molasses.

 

HERBERT DEWAR, California.

Varsity Baseball. Varsity Football. Class Football Captain.
“Tilly” is the children’s favor-

vania know Tilly. He has played
in all diPferent kinds of baseball
leagues, but has not yet started
to play very much for Pitt. Vl/ent
oL1t for football in the eleventh
hour and almost put Captain
Roe in the Scrub bunch. He has
only one fault: he likes to be
coaxed. And only one weakness:
he likes the girls from California
Normal.

ALBERT LESLIE EVANS, Dickerson Run.
Vamlergrift High School, 1899.

“Handsome” shuns society in
general as a delusion and a snare,
but fusses very violently when—
ever he happens to ﬁnd his affin-
ity. which event occurs every two
weeks, on the average. He has
an efficient sense of humor and
can outtalk anyone on girls and
other pet subjects. Generous in
anything but argument, in which
he reduces his opponent to a
state of somnolence by his conﬁ-
dential manner and coquettish
lisp.

WILL ELLIS FERINGER New Castle.

Plays the mouth organ in
French, the violin in Italian, and
sings in Spanish. Talks like an
overloaded dynamo engine with
a loose nut and a sore tooth. One
of the greatest fussers that ever
happened. Has enough blood and
thunder tales from his own ex-
perience to make a person think

_that he is honorary president of

the Ananias Club.‘ Studies so
hard that his hair has turned
gray. From his general disposi-
tion renamed “Kitty.”

CLARENCE WESTERVELT HAGAN, Wilkinsburg.

Wilkinsburg High School, 1908.
Hockey.

AEA

 

A sweetened example of the
village cut—up. Quite a fusser
and public reader, especially of
Shakespeare and Julius Caesar.
Known as the Human Joke Book
and a walking dictionary of
things humorous. Annoys those
who know him best. “Click” ex-
pects to be an assistant in His-
tology some day. Quite a dancer
and manipulator of Junior Proms.
Destined, in spite of his ambition,
for the nickelodeon stage, where
he will be a star.

CLARENCE HENRY HAPGOOD, Erie.
Warren High School. ‘I'll. Class Football. Varsity Football.

 

The class landmark. Roomed
with the Billiken, but enjoyed
good company all the time. Al-
ways happy. A dilletante athlete
who acquired strength by avoid-
ing work. Usually tries to bluff
and occasionally ru11s up against
a snag. In him We have a type
of those dear to the fair sex. His
winning ways, coy manners and
captivating smile have had mar-
velous effect. Happy like a girl
with the giggles. Is he in love?

ARTHUR WILLIAM HEAPE, Syracuse.
Syracuse High. \I'$Z.

“Grinny” gets fussed every
time anything with skirts comes
his way. Stays up nights and
studies, but does not object to a
little fun so long as you save the
furniture. Vi/ould _inake a good
mother for some poor Freshman.
Left fame and fortune to become
one of the boys and has succeed-
ed very well. > But even in spite
of these remarks he is a rawthah
good fellow, doncherno? Arthur
is a peculiar mixture of maternal
care and latent wildness.

 

JOHN VERNON LINDSAY, Johnstcwn.
Johnstown High School, 1907. Varsity Football.

Jack went out for football in
his Freshman year, so he could
eat at the training table, but he
discovered that he could play
some, after all. He has dates
three weeks in advance with Bird.
Fusses merely to be one of the
fellows. Quite a hunter and nim-
rod. VVent to Greensburg on a
hunt but luck and the game laws,
assisted by the sheriff, were
against him. Lindsay is a star
end man a11d likes to have his
picture taken.

CHARLES EDWARD MILLER, Sharpsburg.

“Doc” is the Don Quixote of
the class. Had a career before
this and is striving for another,
Truly a dashing young dentist
who stood for his fellow men in
early years and 110w stands on
them. Acquired the fussing habit
in Sharpsburg while still a young
fellow in his twenties, developed
it to an alarming extent, until
now he ranks with the best. Has
served time in l)oth East Liberty
and VVill<insburg.

 

WILLIAM MacILWAINE McGIFFIN, Pittsburg.
Class Football.

A sprightly young chicken with
a squeaky voice and a laugh that
would turn Balaam’s steed green
with envy. Holds the unanimous
opinion that he sings divinely.
Recites heroic poetry with appro-
priate gestures and is understood
to have dramatic aspirations.
Though iinportuned by Various
vaudeville managers throughout
the state. he stuck to dentistry,
thinking that there he would at
least give as much pain.

OLIVER CLARENCE NEELY, ]r., Alum Rock.

Dental Manager 1911 Owl. St. Petersburg High School, 1901.
‘P9. Cap and Gown Club.

Nimrod Neely is a happy—go—
lucky son of Clarion County.
Always in an amiable frame of
mind and when he smiles he is
the envy of all the tooth powder
advertisers. Willing to accommo-
date anyone at any time, even to
the ‘extent of lending his melo-
dious voice to the vocal jubila-
tions. Can enter a recitation and
reel oﬂ? hot air until the in-
structor calls for help. Pretends
to be a cynic, but in vain.

 

LUCIUS WALLACE OHL, Ingram.

Ingram High School, 1906. ‘I19. Cap and Gown Club. Class
Football.

Although a good fellow, he is
a little Lucius in his upper story.
Strong for the Y. M. C. A., and
does stunts in the gym., retain-
ing his religion at the same time
in spite of the blisters obtained.
A fusser of no mean ability, but
temperate. Can slap one on the
back so that he thinks one of
mother’s biscuits has been hurled
at him. They call him “Crazy"
because they are unable to under-
stand his genius.

Joe handed in something about
himself that it would be a shame
to print. He says that people
think he is lazy, but he claims in-
nocence on this charge. Acquit—
ted. Also says he is always out
of tobacco, clothes and money.
Alibi proven. Pleads guilty to a
bad disposition. Acquitted. Fi-
nally accuses himself of being a
fusser of the ladies. Convicted
and sentenced to hard labor for
life.

WILLIAM CUTHBERT PIDGEON, Houtzdale.
llnutzdale High School, 1907. Cap and Gown Club.

Would rather believe what the
text book says than ﬁgure it out
for himself. Believes that all the
Waltzes are “Wild Rose” and that
all the two—steps are “Miss Me-
linda.” Also believes in giving
his class pin an education; it is
now taking a course at Bellevue
High. Works periodically when
the humor suits him; at other
times gives a ﬁne imitation of a
dead man. Danced out of Houtz-
dale to be one of the gang.

David may be a post, but he is
not content to rest in one place.
As a supporter of the strenuous
doctrine he is the man for the
right place. Always doing some-
thing or somebody and never sat-
isﬁed unless active. Has not had
much success yet as a lady fusser,
but is progressing rapidly under
the tuition of his fellow—students.
A hard worker at times and one
who works less than he thinks he
does. I

 

CHARLES BERNARD QUAILEY, Dennison, O.

Dennison High School, 1906.

Baseball.

A genial son of Ohio who left
girls and fortune to enter Pitt.
Learned football through the
Correspondence School and
therefore is a successful candi-
date for the Varsity. He is con-
tinually being bumped, forgetting
things, and, worst of all, giggling
like a High School girl. A
famous rough-houser and all-
around good fellow. Star ﬁrst
baseman on the team and quartet.
Disliked girls but prefers them
to study.

Buck shows two rows of teeth
when he smiles that would make
Bwana Tumbo turn green with
envy. Has a pair of dimples so
deep that they form warts on the
back of his neck. Always ﬁrst at
school and last to leave; we think
he is an assistant to the janitor.
Refuses to say anything on the
subject. Familiarly known as the
“South Side Tough.” Handsome
fellow and a perfect encyclopedia
of information. Keeps John D.
Rockefeller by burning vast
quantities of midnight oil.

CHARLES HENRY RIDENOUR, Rockwood.

Billiken Sport, fat and chubby,
wishes life were all vacation. Has
been known to gaze longingly at
Venus at the most unearthly
hours. Out for a good time and
has developed -a happy faculty of
listening interestedly to every-
body’s woes. Loves after the
most approved style, dreamy ex-
pression, lovesick sighs and sen-
timental air. Nevertheless has a
hearty appetite and looks like
Bilious Taffy, our respected Pres-
ident. Very handsome and at-
tractive.

SAMUEL SARVER SHEFFLER, Greensburg.
Greensburg High School, 1909. AEA. Class Football.

 

The best-natured man in the
class and everybody’s goat, if his
mark is not threatened. The
easiest going member of this col-
lection of celebrities, and be-
liever that the world will move

 

just the same. Hunts rabbits with
Lindsay, but the rabbits were
faster than he. Never known to
look at the opposite sex except
on holidays and when the crows
are likely to see him. Try to pro-
nounce his name with all the S’s.

FRANK OSCAR ERNEST STONE, Point Pleasant, W. Va.

Point Pleasant High School, 1908. ABA.

A cute little fellow with goo-
goo eyes and a bird—like voice,
with which he warbles when he is
happy. Can commit whole chap-
ters of Anatomy, but gets sore
when he cannot describe the
“sternum.” He spends his vaca-
tions in Texas, putting elevators
in the adobe houses of the greas-
ers. Went to a dance once and
heard a girl say, “Isn’t he cute?"
Since then he has surpassed the
class in the noble art. Pretty soft
fellow for so hard a name.

WALTER JOSEPH ALLISON, Nowata, Okla.

The busiest broncho ever busted. Fresh from the
plains. with a cyclone disposition and a vocabulary of guns,
ropes and chaps. Put him on a cayuse with a square mile
of coyotes around and watch them scatter. He’s married
now, a result of the evils of loving in‘ his youth.

ALBERT MARTIN BINGER, Pittsburg.

German High School.

The man who “deserted the German Army to enter Pitt
Dental. Studious and very bright. Partakes of the amber
ﬂuid freely. Headquarters at the Fort Pitt dining room.
Quite a traveler and able to tell hair—raising stories of his
adventures.

ALBERT CLARK VAN KIRK, Waynesburg.
SN/.

This is one of our twins, the
pride of the class and the terror
of the chaperons. Has a fondness
for the “Silvery Moon” and rela-
tions with Romeo. Envies Dr.
Booth, but thinks he can beat him
in a fair trial. Believes in love at
ﬁrst sight, second sight and out
of sight. Some of the loves he
gets are sights! Say. fellows,
'(lon’t she look good to you? VVe
are too tender—hearted to tell him
the truth. Very susceptible for a
dentist.

 

HENRY ATWELL BLAIR, Pittsburg.
Varsity Football.

The man who wrote the book on football. He visits
the Martin College frequently and had persuaded her to
wait until he has ﬁnished his college career. He has a
smooth-folding face something like that of a Chinese Joss.

HARRY EDGAR CAMPBELL, Upper Middletown.
Ohio Northern University, 1907. ‘P9.

“Parsons” needs only glasses and a frock coat to make
him perfectly preacheresque in appearance. Has the oscil-
lating walk, a hesitating speech. but a well developed mem-
ory. Won the honors -in being one of the “Brilliant Set."

One hundred thirty-six

CLARENCE CARLTON CAMPMAN, Pittsburg.

Clarence has such an alliterative name that we might
say that he was born on the high C’s. Not such a bad fel-
low after you get to know hi1n, which is rather difﬁcult,
since he appears about once a week with enough noise to
proclaim his presence. VVill make a ﬁne dentist.

THOMAS FRANCIS CORR, Taunton, Mass.

Taunton Higli School. Cap and Gown Club.

The man with the sylph—like walk. Usually rather sol-
emn in expression, but fond of a joke. Stayed at the train-
ing house the ﬁrst year,.but the boys were too rough. Good
fellow, but rather timid, like all people from Taunton.

ISAAC J. COTTOM, Dawson.

Dawson High School, 1901. \l'Q.

The Chaperons’ favorite, but refuses to spoon. This is
his ﬁrst with this class, but he honors both it and the one he
hailed from. Used to be a butcher, but he couldn’t stand
the cruelty and became a dentist. He is one of those heart-
Crushers.

CLARKE RAYMOND CRAWFORD, Tidioute.

Tidioute High School, 1903. Class Football.

Down with the law. discipline, subordination and gov-
ernment! Slip the leash from anarchy and let red ruin run
riot! For here is — Crawford. He wears all the latest
loud clothes. For the real essence of toughness, history
has no parallel.

ALBERT EDWARD DAVIDSON, Wheeling.

A motherly, sweet—dispositioned old lady who forsook
the cozy chimney corner in his pater’s house for a chance at
our proposed dormitories. Makes center pieces and corset-
eovers. Has a work-basket with all kinds of things. Ask
him, if you need anything.

CHARLES JEFFERSON DENHOLM, Pittsburg.

‘I19.

A serious minded youth from the land of wisdom who
was never known to make a remark on any subject. “As
thin as a tenpenny nail.” An admirer of the fair sex, in
whose presence his reserve seems to make him all the 111ore
interesting. Otherwise a good fellow.

WILLARD LEROY ELLSWORTH, Pittsburg.

Looks like a yellow kid from some shoe advertisement;
chews spearniint gum and sings like a fellow in burlesque.
One of the famous Indians in the Cap an(l Gown show; has
a laugh like a fire alarm. Got a job running an auto, but it
did11’t last. A rough houser.

WALTER CONRAD FEICK, Avalon.

Avalon High School, 1908.

Willie is the man whose existence is unique and essen-
tial. A master of diplomacy and politics. Treats with scorn
those who come under displeasure. One of the best “fans”
in the school. The real power behind the throne, who sows
what others reap (he harvests a little).

CLIFTON CHARLES FISH, Pittsburg.

A big, fat lump of fun, always jolly. By the looks of
things he must have a pull. Fish married when quite young,
but that is a tale of its own The ladies simply conldn’t re-
sist him, so he fell by the wayside and is (loomed to a life
at hard labor.

CHARLES JOHN GAFFNEY, Houtzdale.

Has all the Dinwiddie Street at his heels, and is fond
of taking walks by moonlight. VVas a tonserial artist, but
got into the habits of the dental profession. VVhen not busy
he is for all the rough-house going. Ca11 give Anatomy just
as well as Dr. l\lcCurdy.

GEORGE PETER GOLDMAN, Pittsburg.
Pittsburg High School.

“Sol” can trace his ancestry back to the year 1776 A.D.,
but he is the first dentist. Has the fault that he must come
into class late to be noticed. A good workman, who pulls
teeth without pain to himself. Entirely Irish in race and a
descendant of St. Patrick.

ANGUST HERMAN HOPPEL, Carrolltown.
Indiana Normal, 1905.

He got that feminine manner from going to Indiana
Normal which is the home of all the lady charmers. His
name indicates that he is one of those who made Milwaukee
famous, but it does not affect his power to learn everything
The worth knowing about Dentistry.

COURTLAN D JAMES, Pittsburg.

Seems a little as if Courtland got his name twisted. He
is a near relation of Henry James and William James, so his
peculiarly abstruse didactic elocution may not seem so very
mysterious as before. He will make an expert in keeping
his patients interested.

SAMUEL MEYERS, Pittsburg.
A little, red-facedfellow with a smile that would make

an artist long to have him for a model. Sam is unable to_

talk back; a trait he acquired in the plumbing business. No
rough artist and a gentleman on all occasions. Has more
brains than money and don’t use them.

FRANCIS CHARLES MORAN, Pittsburg.

A son of Old Erin and one who is a credit to the auld
sod. Always merry and willing to joke, even if the weather
is cloudy. Another honorary member of the Lady Fussers’
Union and a holder of the speed record for fussing. Works
at times and loafs at others.

JOHN JOSEPH McCAIG, Pittsburg.

He comes into the lecture room with such an air of wis-
dom and concealed knowledge on his physiognomy that the
professors are prompted to ask him questions. He could
answer them, too, but believes in getting something for
everything he gives away.

JOHN JOSEPH McDONNELL Throop.

East Stroudsburg Normal, 1908.

Weary by name, but a grouch by nature, he walks
around like a man in a trance and would rather growl than
eat. Thinks that all aischool is for is to remove the cash
from the unsuspecting victim. Great baseball player, but
never got into the big leagues.

JOHN HOMER MCNEELY, Pittsburg.

John Homer is wiser than he looks, which is saying a
great deal for him since he is quite a wise looking fellow.
Born with a purpose, which is slowly nearing fulﬁllment.
Expects some day to be the greatest dentist that ever hap-
pened. Here's luck to you, John.

Washington and Jefferson. ‘H2. Vice-1’re‘sident, ’08. Varsity

Football.

Hails from W. & J. Looks more like a Viking of old
than a student. Or, perhaps, like a camera tripod. An ex-
cited scrutinizer of the bulletin board when marks are
posted, then says “Soaked again,” with much pathos. His
legs are ten inches longer than speciﬁcations.

WILLIAM PATRICK MCQUILLAN, Pittsburg.
R. I. School of Design.

Has a frame like the cross section of a grasshopper L’ ‘ '

engine and walks with a corresponding angle. Speaks the

Yiddish language correctly and can account for the loss of
his class pin. Pauline’s old standby. Admirer of all Irish.

WALTER J. THOMAS, Wilmore.

A ruddy and aristocratic chap from one of the leading
knowledge dispensaries; but from the amount of dentistry
he knows it looks as if he didn’t inhale much of the ozone.
A willing helper of all lower class men, but possesses a grin
like a heathen Chinee.

luck to him in his profession.
Curly‘ is a good fellow and we

HARRY L. BRINKHOFF, Pittsburg.
Pittsburg High School, 1908.

Harry is a pretty decent sort of
a fellow and we bet that when he
gets started in business, his soda
fountain will be the attraction for
all the pretty girls in the neigh-
borhood. We know that he knows

_ This proves him a man of ability.

WYLIE B. DOAK, Oakmont.

One of the most important per-

knows, how much he should
know and how much he must
learn before he keeps a shop of
his own.

(‘uehua High School.

 

A typical Pennsylvania hill
climber. Climbing in his great

ing straight up through Phar-

a help to his neighbors in the

GEORGE W. HEER, Pittsburg.
Pittsburg High School, 1908.

“Her” may have been called

(He wasn’t called before him).
Lots of ideas under his black In-

Ask G. E. Brown whom you met

JAMES A. NULL, Chambersburg.

Much to his regret. he was de-

Weber is a hard worker and des-
tined to make her fortune in the

HARRY D. WITHERS, Connellsville.

Honest, Harry is better look-
ing than this. He has a ‘heart
the size of his foot and yet in its

Beighley aspires to become a basketball player. He

support a team and allow him to display his ability to the
wondering thousands.

JOSEPH WILLIAM BELL, Beechview.

Here’s good wishes to Bell,

May he set up in business and do very well;
He’ll never mind,
He’s not that kind.

To kick when the sodas won’t sell.

W. S. BIXLER, Connellsville.
Connellsville High School.

Bix has never been known to have dislocation of the
tie; he carries a smile of huge proportions and we hope that
in time he may develop i_nto a Pharmacist to make us sit up
and notice.

H. W. HAGMEYER, Pittsburg.
Pittsburg A('€1(i(‘l’I1_V.

He travels home on the Second
Avenue cars. I guess that is about
enough to say in disparagement of
any fellow, liagmeyer is rather
good—natured, but talks too much
for a (lruggist. His pompadour re;
quires an hour’s work every 1norn—
ing, so he gets to school late.

 

J. A. BOORMAN, Altoona.
Altoona Higli School, 1909.

Boory’s singing is beyond description; he warbles like
a real Caruso. He should have been an opera star rather
than a druggist; indeed, we have proof that Hammerstein
made him offers.

HERBERT J. BROWN, Johnstown.
Johnstown High School.
Herbert distinctly remembers the ﬂood. But'he was
very young then. The result of the experiences has been to
make him an ardent advocate of the dry policy in all things.

M. S. CLARK, Butler.

A happy-go—lucky, with no bad habits. Gives his time
to study Whenever there is no skating, basketball or such
things going on. Otherwise very studious. Inquire at
Johnston’s, the great Butler Pharmacy. Knows a thing

JAMES B. GEORGE, North Side.

Jim can put off enough hot air to keep the room—we1l,

It’s worth a long walk to see James.

J. B. HAMILTON, Elizabeth.

One of the Frat men whom we are glad to see among

wisdom from the foolish. Therefore he always studies what

he don’t expect to get.

For a description of his physical appearance take a

THOMAS ROSS KEPPLE, Johnstown.

Kep claims to have such a happy home that he has to

time before the prohibition craze. Nothing like that would
have happened had Kepple been there.

ELMER KIEFER, Charleroi.

ALBERT L. KOSLER, Crafton.

His specialty is seeing things through a microscope that
do not exist. He is the handsome chap with dark curly hair
on his noble brow, large, expressive eyes, and a Mark Twain
head. He may not be much of a humorist but he is a
hustler iii the full sense of the word.

T. W. LAWRENCE, Beaver.

He comes to us with apologies for claiming the Saints’
Rest for a stopping place. His excuses will be accepted if
he guarantees that he will go into business in his own town.
He is quite a genius with the racket. It is even said that he
makes a racket in his courting.

R. M. METZ, Aspinwall.
Etna High School, 1906. Class Treasurer.

Metz has so much money to handle that he promises to
be more of a banker than a Pharmacist. He comes in at
twelve, takes an hour for dinner and leaves at one. (Bank-
er’s hours).

C. C. MITCHELL, McKeesport.

Mitchell is the gentleman with the elephantine frame

and a grace like a hippopotamus. When Mitchell walks let
no man leave his feet in the aisle. Favorite with the ladies,
like all big men.

HERBERT P. MOSCA, Pittsburg.

J. C. MCBRIDE, Butler.

From which clan we are not prepared to say, but from

American. Much to his credit, he has a natural tendency to
shy at the fair sex.

JOHN J. MCCONVILLE, Momestead.

its goal.” This statement was made in regard

to the philosophy of Lord Bacon; apply it to the educa-

enlightened with the versiﬁcaition of a conclusive prin-
ciple. From a small, inadequate building, situated on
the corner of Third street and Cherry alley, the progress
of the embryo institution was marked by prodigious
leaps and bounds until to—day it stands as the conceptive
monument of the educational advantages of the city of

learning and strength of mind, not Puritanic in tenden-
cies, but emine_ntly practical and conservative in educa-
tional ability and morals.

In 1818 the institution became the VVestern Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. Under such men as Black, Bruce,
Swift and Maguire the scope of learning enlarged and
embraced a more extensive ﬁeld. As men of stable char-
acter, of ﬁrm, enduring purpose, they are to be com-
mended for their earnest and painstaking endeavors in
building the University up from such a basis. The nar-
row tendencies of our forefathers held no sway with
them, and their successful efforts are the result of dear
experience. ‘

Prior to the change the school had ﬂourished as the
Pittsburgh Academy. Later some inconsistent litigation
concerning the location of the buildings involved a
change of situation. With the decision of the Supreme
Court an appropriation of $2,400 per year for ﬁve years
was granted,’ conditional upon the surrender to the State
of the original grant. This was done, and with the
$12,000 received from the State, the ﬁrst University build-
ing, located at the corner of Third and Cherry, was erect-
ed. Later it was consumed in the “great ﬁre” of 1845.

The presidency of the institution was held by Dr.
Bruce from 1822 to 1835, when he was succeeded by Rev.
Gilbert Morgan, who resigned after one year, and was
succeeded by Dr. Bruce, who resumed charge and re-
mained until I842, when he was succeeded by the Rev.
Herman Dyer. These rapid and radical changes gave
the institution a necessary experience. The best men
were retained, and through their earnest work a founda-
tion of solidity and progressive education was effected.

A succession of disheartening misfortunes so dis-
couraged these hardy educational pioneers that the fac-
ulty was disbanded. Through the efforts of John Har-
per, a man of indefatigable courage and will power, a
new building was erected at the corner of Ross and Dia-
mond streets.

In 1855 Dr. J. F. MacLaren was elected, only to re-
sign three years later, after an indifferent administration.
He was succeeded by Dr. George Woods, who was the
ﬁrst to be accorded the title of Chancellor. For twenty-
one years he remained at the head of the institution.
Shortly after his arrival in Pittsburgh he became per-
suaded that the effort to secure an endowment would not
be fruitless, and in his enthusiastic way he set about ac-
complishing his task. VVith the aid of a promise made
by Mr. William Thaw, the sum of $20,000 was secured.
It is to this man chieﬂy that the pioneer efforts of the
University were successfully handled. Imbued with the
idea that a great University was needed, he gave freely
toward the accomplishment of its establishment.

In 1880 Dr. H. M. McCracken was elected Chancel-
lor. It was during his ofﬁciation that the engineering
course was established, with Prof. Daniel Carhart at its
head. Milton B. Goff became head of the institution at
the resignation of Dr. McCracken.

After six years of very efficient service, mainly in
the establishment of an effective system, he died as the
result of an accident, and his place was taken by Dr. W.
J. Holland, under whom the University prospered to a
marked degree. Dr. Holland is not only locally known,
but his scientiﬁc reputation is world-wide, he being a
member of the Queen’s Society and several other impor-

ATHLETIC HISTORY

THLETICS in the University has had many ups
A and downs with a predominance of the latter.
These have been intermingled witl1 frequent bright
successes and some very dismal failures. Prior to 1897
the fortunes of the various teams depended upon individ-
ual efforts more than upon any concerted action by the
students or the alumni. This meant that from year to
year the strength of the teams ﬂuctuated all the Way from
championship caliber to meager nonentity. If among the
students there were any who took a great interest in the
branch of athletics, they would give it their attention
with the result of a possible success. But there was no
coaching system evolved to develop the new material, so
when the few stars graduated the standard of -the sport
immediately took a plumb line drop. Of course there
were exceptions to this general rule, as for example the
varsity team of baseball between the years of 1888 and
1894. This organization was indeed famous and became
widely known. However, such a small matter as “ring—
ing” in a professional once in a while was not considered
a criminal offence, for intercollegiate standards had not
-then attained the height to which they have reached in
the present day.

Football was played, but the members of the teams
depended upon eastern collegiate stars, playing on local
teams, for their guidance in opening the games. It was
the same in case of individual efforts. But the individuality
brought about an era in the history of University athletics

that may be justly termed the “golden age.” It was from
1892 to 1894 and during this time all the branches of ath-
letics ﬂourished Wonderfully. But sad -to relate a night of
oblivion that followed was a woful contrast. Some of the
athletes graduated, others left, and from 1895 to 1897
University athletics were hardly of a prep school stand-
ard, excepting possibly the Medical School baseball team.

This led to a general realization of the state of affairs
and steps were immediately taken to remedy the situation
and to place athletics upon a ﬁrmer basis. An advisory
board was organized from the faculty and alumni com-
posed of Chancellor H-olland, Henry S. Calvert, John B.
Scott, James E. McKirdy, Walter Riddle, Edward E.
Mayer, and Clifford B. Connelly. This board did their
level best to create order out of chaos, securing Hoskins
of State and the next year Tranchard of Princeton in the
capacity of football coach. They also tried to organize
the students, but the bottom fell out and they succumbed
to an enormous accumulation of old debts of former stu-
dent bodies.

For a couple of more years affairs jogged along and
in 1904 a few enthusiastic alumni got busy and laid plans
for a coach and a training table. It is needless to say that
they may be justly proud of the fruit that has resulted
from the smalllseed that they planted, and from all evi-
dence, athletics in the University are bound to climb much
higher on the ladder of success in the near future.

FOOTBALL

versity has created such widespread interest and ad-

miration as tl1e one of the past season. Pitted against
teams of championship caliber, made up of gridiron veter-
ans, they were never known to lose courage, even in the
most crucial moments, and, indeed, it is a11 enviable
record to have only two defeats marked against them;
one from the undefeated champions of the \\7est, and the
other from the champions -of the State of l’e11nsylvania.
It is well to note also that only one touchdown was the
total in each case. Not a little of the credit is due to
Coach “]oe" Thompson, who successfully overcame many
apparently unsurmountable difﬁculties. In the first place
only four of the 1908 varsity men were available for the
squad and new material was not forthcoming very rap-
idly. Thompson developed most of the men who took
part in the big games from last year's scrubs and the way
they performed was a revelation to every one.

There were few stars on the Pitt eleven. All the lads
were earnest, hard-working, conscientious players who
never knew what it was to give up. In a combination,
they formed a great animated machine, well oiled with a
thorough knowledge of the game and impelled by a spirit
that was indomitable.

l:)ERHAl’S no football team in the history of the Uni-

Regular practice was started Sept. 10, 1909. on the
campus on De Soto St. and sixteen men reported. The
weather was hot and unsuited for football, but Thompson
started in immediately to limber the men up. Schenley
Oval was used several times in these early practices until

One hundred seventy-seven

Exposition Park was ready. Before the end of the next
week the squad had enlarged ﬁfty per cent. and the regu-
lar work of tackling the dummy and learning the signals
was i11 full swing.

Of last year's men there were Capt. Roe, jack Lind-
say, Doc Van Dore11, Tex Richards. Stevenson, Blair,
Ebeck, Quailey, Bailey, Ent, Budd and Sayre. Among
the new men were Galvin, Bill and Art Robinson, Red
Frankel, Peacock. F eightner, Porter, Gehlert and Leahy.

The training quarters were comfortably located in a
large roomy house at 3456 Bouquet St. The sixteen
rooms were pleasantly furnished and the members of the
squad who stayed there felt quite at home.

In the two minor games of the season, Ohio Northern
and Marietta, Pitt proved an easy victor, but some very
ragged playing was shown in the line and back ﬁeld.
Many substitutions were made in order to try out new
men and the performance of some of the recruits appeared
decidedly promising. Galvin showed ability at center,
a11d Frankel, Leahy and Sayre were making good bids for
line positions. Budd and Bill Robinson alternated at
quarterback and it was pretty hard to choose between
Richards, Quailey, and Ent who made up the back ﬁeld.
Art Robinson, Feightner, and Porter were frequently
substituted in the back ﬁeld in the beginning of the
games.

The opening game of the season with the Ohio
Northern resulted in a score of 16 to 0. There was much

sulted in a loss. T11e most pleasing feature of the game
was the helping spirit displayed by the entire Pitt team.
Every man seemed to be in every play, and it was a fre-
quent sight to see a big lineman dragging the runner an
additional yard or two after he had been tackled.

The game with Mar1'etfa College on the 9th of October
resulted in a score of 12 to 0. It was played at 10 o'clock
in the morning to avoid conflicting with the \r\/'orld’s
Chainpionship Baseball game in the afternoon. Marietta
started in with great speed and seemed to be having
rather the best of the contest, until Budd, who was play-
ing end i11 Roe's place (Roe being out of the game with a
“charley horse") grabbed a fumble made by the visitors
and ran 65 yards for a touchdown. Twice in the same
half the visitors were dangerously near the Pitt goal line,
but at the critical moment the "Varsity" always rallied
and held them for downs. _

The story of the second half was different. Pitt
started in from the kickoff like a new team, and while the
score was held close by the plucky perseverance of their
opponent_s, the superiority of Thompson’s men was appar-
ent throughout. The second score was made when Bill
Robinson, who was playing quarterback, caught a punt
on the ﬁfty—ﬁve yard line and carried it through a broken
ﬁeld for a touchdown.

Unfortunately, l\'Iarietta's right half-back, Nutter,
who it is said was the veteran West Virginia University
half-back playing under an assumed name, tried to “mix
it up,” with the officials and every one in general toward
the end of the game. However. serious trouble was averted
by the presence of the police.

Indian was going to (live for him, but Quailey, who was
nearby, dove ﬁrst, and both went sprawling in the mud.
This gave Roe a good start and with the excellent inter-
ference, especially that of Van Doren, he kept on going
and never stopped until he was joyfully kicking up his
heels behind the lndians’ goal posts. The Pitt rooters
went mad, absolutely delirious. Pennants and everything
movable went sailing in the air and a shout went up that
was heard for a radius of x miles.

The Indians then became desperate and fought with
a_ dogged perseverance that could not but command ad-
miration. Twice they attempted ﬁeld goals and failed,
but the third attempt was rewarded by success. The ﬁrst
half ended, 6 to 3.

In the second half Galvin added three more points to
the score by kicking a goal from placement and toward
the end the Varsity pushed over another touchdown by
straight football tactics.

The game showed the real power of the machine that
Thompson was developing. The team work displayed
was truly wonderful. No man can hardly be commended
more than another. “_[ack." Lindsay and Captain Roe
played splen(lidl_v at the ends. both making some of the
cleanest tackles of the year. "Tex" Richards was a tower
of strength on the back ﬁeld and was sturdily reinforced
by Ent and Quailey. “Art" Robinson played well when
substituted for “Rich,” toward the end. The line cov-
ered itself with glory and proved that it had those stone-
wall qualities that are so essential. “Re(l" Frankel was a
part of it and indeed made good.

On the following .\Ionda_v was held one of the great-
est celebrations ever witnessed in the school. It was

glorious. The faculty acted very nicely, probably, not
out of courtesy, but kindness, and permitted the tempor-
ary insane school to be dismissed. Insane. Rather. Mad,
delirious, incoherent, weak, hoarse, tired, but,—confound

prisoners from the clutches of a cruel and relentless fac-
ulty. The Medical ‘surrendered likewise. The mob, very
quiet an(l orderly, proceeded down town with a decorum
and dignity worthy a raving maniac. Noise? VVell, the
Ear Hospital fared prosperously for a few days. The the-
atre was occupied, or rather stampeded, and the perform-
ance turned into a farce. Following this, in the evening
a war dance of victory was held 011 the campus.

The afternoon of the 30th-of October found the Pitt
team lined up against the famous Veteran team of Notre
Dame. It was the same aggregation that sustained only
one defeat during the season of 1908. That occured when
Michigan kicked three ﬁeld goals against them in a game
that ended I2 to 6. The Pitt rooters were very hopeful,
but after the game, when “Pop" Zieg, the loyal and faitl1-
ful rooter for Pitt, said, “They have a better team than
ours,” he told in simple, but expressive words the truth.
To be sure the “breaks" went to the \\’esterners and the
wind helped their punting in the ﬁrst half, but Notre
Dame outplayed Pitt and the score didn’t quite indicate
how much. They were too fast, too clever, and too con-
sistent to be beaten even by a team that had defeated the
Carlisle Indians.

The VVesterners started in with a whirlwind speed
that never slackened and the lead attained by an early

touchdown, by means of a couple of clever forward
passes, was never lost. The Varsity was stage—struck by
the legitimate display of trickiness and were confused to
the point of desperation. It was a game full of surprises.
Once especially a Notre Dame man lay unseen, out near
the side lines, feigning injury, only to leap to his feet

every student in it. Dr. Brashear’s love for the Univer-
sity and the interest he manifested in its welfare has con-
stituted the major portion of his life. Although pressed
by private affairs during his administration, he rendered
most valuable service and maintained unimpaired the
high efficiency of the institution. Conscientious in his
duty, loyal in his attitude, devoted in his hopes, he gave
his strength without stint to its welfare, and as a monu-

school to the Oakland (listrict brings in a new element—
the advantage of valuable surroundings, in music, art and

the buildings will be reared upon the splendid campus, it
requires no prophetic mind to foresee the complete reali-
zation of the most optimistic hope of the alumni and the
friends of the University. It is as yet in the beginning,
but it is in the beginning of the end. Its progress devel-
ops a wonderful contrast—the pioneers of V\/estern
Pennsylvanian education and the splendidly equipped
faculty of the present are proofs of the marvelous educa-
tional advance. The school has already had an existence,
tried and true, venerable in this land of over one hundred
years; it has a tradition, one that others might envy; it
has achievement, toward which one may point with
pride; it has a high record of directorship, they have

HISTORY OF THE PAST YEAR

 

EXCAVATION FOR THE MEDICAL BUILDING

as an important date in the history of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburg. Then was laid with appropriate
ceremonies the corner-stone of the ﬁrst building on the
new campus. In accordance with the plan of the Sesqui-

FRIDAY, the second of October, will be remembered

Centennial celebration, this event followed the similar
exercises at the Soldiers’ Memorial.

The assembly of the Faculty, Alumni and students,
comprising over ﬁve hundred in number, were stationed
on either side of Grant Boulevard. Before them passed
the column of the veterans, whose standards they saluted
as the latter marched to their positions at the Memorial
Building.

After the completion of the ceremonies here, the
speakers and guests of the occasion proceeded to the
School of Mines, where, with ﬁtting dignity, the corner-
stone was laid. Addresses were made by Governor
Edwin S. Stuart, of Pennsylvania; Hon. John O. Sheatz,
State Treasurer; Mayor George W. Guthrie, and several
others. The evidence of good will on the part of these
prominent ofﬁcials testiﬁed to a hearty interest in the
welfare of the University at large, and justiﬁes a decid-
edly Optimistic outlook for its ultimate realization. The
ﬁnal address, by Dr. John A. Brashear, reflected well the
spirit of the occasion. By the ﬂuency of his ‘humor and
terse epigrams, the popular scientist stimulated the
faith of his listeners into enthusiasm. At his suggestion
cheers Were.raised for each of those who had assisted in
the program. Then followed a mighty one in testimony
of his own personal esteem.

ards annexed ﬁve more points before time was called
making the ﬁnal score 17 to 3.

On Thanksgiving day the ﬁnal game of the Season
was played with State. The weather was crisp and fair,
and the ﬁeld dry. The crowd began to gather early and
by the time the game was called it had reached propor-
tions that broke all records for a football game in Pitts-
burgh.

It was indeed the greatest football game that was
ever played in the city of Pittsburgh. Probably no two
teams were more evenly matched and victory was not
certain until the ﬁnal whistle blew.

In the ﬁrst half Pitt was on the defensive the greater
part of the time. Again and again State forged its way
into the dangerous territory only to be repulsed. Finally,
owing to a bad pass from Galvin (his only offense of that
kind during the whole season), Richards made a poor
punt, which gave State the ball within striking distance
of the line and after a most desperate struggle they just
barely pushed it over. However, Vorhis failed at goal.

In the second half it was State’s turn to be on the de-
fensive. The Varsity played with whirlwind speed and
seemed to have their opponents at their mercy com-
pletely. The way “Bill” Robinson and Roe handled the
punts was remarkable and often made State hold their
breaths in awe-stricken wonderment.

State was successful with the forward pass only once
out of the many tries, while the way Pitt executed it
made them all “sit up and take notice.” One triple pass
toward the end of the game was a beauty. “Bill” Robin-
son threw the ball to Richards who threw it to Galvin,
making a gain of about 20 yards. Statistics show that
Richards averaged better in his punting than Vorhis and
the Pitt men ran back the punts much better. In the sec-
ond half State did not make a single ﬁrst down while the
Varsity made two. It was a case of the “fortunes of
war,”—the breaks went to State and it is held by experts
that a tie score would better have indicated the worth of
the two teams.

State presented an unbeaten team of seasoned veter-
ans against an aggregation of newly organized material.
In developing this material into a team that was able to
hold the best combination in State’s history to a 0-5 score,
Joe Thompson accomplished a task that would have made
many a football coach throw up his hands in despair.

Joe Thompson has not only d-one all that could be
reasonably expected of him bL1t a great deal more. He
made something out of nothing and introduced a style
and system that should result in a truly great team in
1910, besides stirring up an unprecedented spirit among
the students that was never before in evidence.

At the annual meeting on the Saturday following
Thanksgiving, “Tex” Richards was unanimously elected
captain of the 1910 team.

TRACK AND FIELD

W HEN the snow had melted and Schenley Park

was placed in good condition Joe Thompson

called out his 1ne11 and began active prepara-
tions for the coming‘ season. Of the previous year‘s
team there were quite a number who answered the
call: Capt. Knotts, Zieg, Van Doren, Richards, Brown.
McCandless, Decker and Coleman. The new material was
promising and embraced such men as V\7eger, Ross, Rob-
inson, Bryson, Henry, VVooton, Lindsay, Elliott, Black-
burn, Mackrell, and Halferty. The prospects were ex«
ceedingly bright and the embryo track men gave excel-
lent hopes of developing a winning team with the con-
sistent and dependable aid of the old—ti1ners.

The ﬁrst trial of the season came on April 17, when
the team entered the Pittsburg Athletic Association
meet at Duquesne Garden. The outcome of the contest
was highly satisfactory: three ﬁrsts, one second and two
thirds was the record of the gold and blue. Quince Ban—
bury was a leading star: by his great speed in winning
the 50 yard dash, he came within a ﬁfth of a second of
equaling the world's record for that distance. In Ross,
Pitt found an excellent man, in fact, one of the ﬁnest
track men in this section. “Lefty” Weger sprang a sur-
prise and initiated himself into prominence by winning
the quarter-mile novice race. Henry and Coleman cap-
tured second and third in the half mile, while Van Doren
took third in the shot put. The results of the meet for
Pitt were entirely satisfactory and much credit is due
the contestants.

On May 6, the team went to Morgantown, VV. Va.,
and captured ﬁrst honors in a dual meet with the Univer-
sity of West Virginia. Nine ﬁrsts, nine seconds and
seven thirds were chalked up to the credit account of
Pitt when the curtain rang down, concluding with a tally

The annual track meet with the Carnegie Technical
Schools was held on Schenley Oval on May 15. It re-
sulted in a score of 66 to 51 in favor of the Plaid. The ab-
sence of Roe in the sprints and Lindsay in the hurdles
materially weakened the lllue and Gold team, permitting‘
Tech to capture practically everything in that line. The
best time was made by Ross in the quarter mile and
Bates in the half mile. The former defeated his old rival
Charles with ease, accomplishing the distance in 52 sec-
onds ﬂat. Brown, of Pitt, set the pace in the half mile.
but unfortunately was passed by Rates in the home
stretch, the Techite making the distance in 2 minutes,
4 3/5 seconds. Pitt captured about everything in the
weight events, Van Doren taking ﬁrst in the discus a11d
the shot, and “Bunny” Elliot landing the hammer throw
neatly. Captain Knotts managed his end of the meet in
a successful manner. “Lefty” VVeger created some heart
palpitations by winning from Boots of Tech by a narrow
margin. Of course, the right men in Pitt could have
handled the meet easily, as subsequent events proved.

A crowd of fully six thousand enthusiastic lovers of
athletics witnessed the annual intercollegiate and inter-
scholastic meet held at Schenley Oval on May 22 and

'with the classiest list of track athletes that ever appeared
in any such event in this city contesting for honors, the

meet was a success from every standpoint.

The Pitt team captured ﬁrst honors, landing 69
points against 50% for Carnegie Tech, 2I for W. & J.
and 18 for VVooster University. The Blue and Gold ath-
letes captured eight out of 14 ﬁrsts. Pitt’s team was by
far the best balanced of those entered, Thompson’s pro-
tégés taking points in 13 of the 15 events on the program.
Their claim to the VVestern Pennsylvania championship
can hardly be disputed after the remarkable showing in
this meet. '

A stiff wind aided the contestants in the track
events and as a result some remarkable track records
were hung up by both college and school athletes. Van
Doren, the Pitt star, set a new university mark when he

a new \V. & I. record for the half mile at 2 :04 1-5 and the
University's relay team composed of Halferty, Weger,
Robinson and Ross, by defeating Carnegie’s team in 3 :35,
added another new university mark. Dowling and Hal-

ferty were Tech’s leading point-winners, they getting the
majority of the points in the I00 and 200 and the low hur-
dles. Outside these events the Plaid was lamentably
weak, landing but one half a point in the six ﬁeld events,
which included the jumps, pole vault and weights.

The running of Captain Knotts in the distances was

The

one of the prettiest exhibitions in the meet. In the mile
event he won over Bates, of Tech, by a remarkable sprint
in the home stretch, allowing the Plaid star to lead the
way up to that point. In the two mile race it was the same
story, Henderson, of Tech, setting the pace and being
passed in the last quarter. In the collegiate quarter
mile, Hosey, of Tech, gave Ross, of Pitt, a hard battle,
although he did not possess the stamina the Blue and
Gold speeder did and was outdistanced as the tape was
neared. Ross also outran Hosey in the quarter mile of
the relay, leading his opponent by a good margin.

Wicks, of W. & ]., ran a beautiful race in the half
mile and the victory of the Red and Black leader was
well received by the spectators. Brown, of Pitt, who has
the reputation of setting a terriﬁc pace in this distance
and who is one of the nerviest representatives of the
Blue and Gold, led Wicks until the home stretch was
reached, when the W. & J. lad proved the better ﬁnisher.

On May 29, the annual track and ﬁeld meet of the
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Athletic Association was
held at Harrisburg. A few members of the Blue and
Gold were sent, but the ﬁeld was too fast and not a point
was captured. Possibly the most remarkable feature of
the meet was the work of Thorpe, the Indian, whose phe-
nomenal efforts were mainly instrumental in securing
Carlisle ﬁrst place.

On the 22nd of June the Pitt team journeyed to
State College with an aggregation that showed many va-
cancies, owing to the school year closing the last of
May. As was expected the track events were all rather
easy for the State men, but Pitt sprung a surprise in the

quarter mile, when Ross captured ﬁrst honors. His ex-
cellent ﬁnish was all the more praiseworthy because _he
had recently been ill and Pitt showed their apprec1a—
tion of his efforts by electing him captain of the 1910
team.

. BASEBALL

HE season’s practice was opened early at the

Denny Grounds. Later it was transferred to DC

& AC Park, at Wilkinsburg. Exposition Park was

not open at that time. Tom Fleming, the former minor

league player, coached the team until he had to leave for

Lowell, Mass., where he took charge of the New Eng-

land league team of that town. Mays Edmondson, the

local minor league player, then took our men in hand,

and it seemed like old times, because a few years ago he
coached the W. U. P. Varsity team.

The opening game of the season was to have been
played at Wheeling on the 14th of April, but rain inter-
fered and for the same reason the game at Johnstown on
the 20th of April was postponed. It was not until the
24th that the ﬁrst game was played and McKeesport
won by a score of 14 to 3. It was a rather poorly played
and uninteresting game, except for Quailey’s home run,
—a liner over the right ﬁeld fence with one man on base.
Malloy started the game, but he was hit so hard that
Brooks was substituted in the ﬁfth inning. He held the
opponents fairly well, but their lead was too large to be
overcome.

The next day Pittsburg College was played. It was
the best collegiate game ever played in this city; a pitch-
er’s battle which lasted through twelve hard fought in-
nings. Martin of Pittsburg College pitched a ﬁne game
and ﬁnished with eleven strike—outs to his credit. Al-
though Malloy did not have as many strike—outs, he
seemed to be complete master of the situation. It was
anybodies’ until the twelfth inning when one costly error
gave the game to the “Blufﬁtes.” VVith a man on second
and two out, Bulger hit a fast one to Farmer, who made a
neat stop and threw to ﬁrst. Here Quailey dropped the
ball allowing McKnight to score. VVilhains followed
with a hit to middle ﬁeld scoring Bulger with the win-
ning run. The playing of the entire Pitt team, especially

Two hundred three

the work of Bien at third and Farmer at short, certainly
gave credit to the organization.

On May 14th Pitt met the famous Cuban Stars at
Exposition Park. This was the same team that had
beaten the Cincinnati Nationals ﬁfteen out of nineteen
games in Cuba during the previous winter. They put in
the box that invincible pitcher, Mendez, and Pitt could do
nothing whatever. The Varsity used three pitchers, Mc-
Kown, Brooks, and Harrington, but they were all hit
hard. The hitting of the Cubans, together with the ﬁne
running catch of Johnny Mackrell, constituted the fea-
tures of the game. The ﬁnal score was eleven to nothing.

On the following day VV. & I. came to Exposition
Park and won the game by the tally of 3 to I. The game
was close, but uninteresting. The Pitt players failed to
show their usual form and consequently VV. & I. Went
home happy.

State was to have been played on May 20th, but I.
Pluvius decreed otherwise. Both teams were on Exposi-
tion ﬁeld, but as the rain continued the game was called
off.

The next day West Virginia defeated Pitt by a score
of 4 to 0. It was a close game until the ninth inning
when bunched hits and a few expensive errors allowed
the Mountaineers to score three runs. Thounhurst
pitched for Pitt.

On the 22nd of May Pitt went to Morgantown to
meet West Virginia in a return game. The “snake—hunt—
ers” again defeated the “Varsity” in a weird exhibition of
baseball nightmare ending a score of 10 to 5. McKown
opened for Pitt, but he was jumped on from the ﬁrst and
hit for ten circuits in ﬁve innings. Brooks was then sub-
stituted and he held them safely until the seventh inning
when the game was called to enable the Pitt team to
catch the train.

BASEBALL TEAM

On May 29th Pittsburg College was once more en-
countered on Expo ﬁeld. The game was a counterpart of
the ﬁrst in that it was close and exciting, but the inability
of Pitt to hit opportunely resulted in a victory for Pitts-
burg College. A drizzling rain which fell continually put
the ﬁeld in a very poor condition. In spite of this both
teams ﬁelded remarkably well. The score was 5 to 4.

On Sunday evening, May 30th, the Pitt squad left
for the eastern trip. The ﬁrst game was featureless and
resulted in a victory for Dickinson, 7 to 5. Brooks hand-
led the sphere for Pitt. In the afternoon Malloy faced
Langstaff, Dicl<inson’s star slab-man. The game was a
toss-up until the last of the eighth when Dickinson
forged ahead with two runs. Langstaff was the “head
liner” of the program, striking out sixteen men. Pitt
registered two hits and succeeded in obtaining three runs
through the inability of the Dickinson catcher to hold
I .angstaff, who had remarkable speed. Malloy pitched a
fair game but errors at critical moments were disastrous.

The Indians were met the next day in a fast and ex-
citing game. Pitt scored two runs in the seventh, thus put-
ting them one run to the good, but in the last of that
same inning the Indians scored two runs. giving them the
leading margin. This was due to Mackrell misjudging
Balenti’s long hit, placing the aborigine on the third cor-
ner before the ball was recovered, scoring Newashi. The
features of the game were the pitching of Thounhurst
and Garlow.

June 2nd is a memorable date from the fact that on
that day Pitt won their only victory of the season. It
happened in the little town of Emmittsburg, Md., and the
Victims were St. Mary’s College. This chesty bunch of
sluggers had beaten Villa Nova and expected an easy
Victory, but Pitt rose to the occasion and played by far
the best game of the season, ﬁnally coming out victorious
to the tune of 4 to 2. Both Malloy and Connelly pitched
well and Thounhurst’s batting, together with the fast play-
ing of Farmer, made the game a spectacular one.

The last game of the season was played with Buck-

Two hundred five

nell at Louisburg on the third of June. Northrop held
Pitt to four hits, Farmer getting two of these. Nobody
scored until the fourth when O’Leary of Bucknell swung
for a homer with one man on base. Brooks pitched well,
but costly errors lost the game. Pitt’s lone run was sup-
plied in the eighth by Farmer, who singled and scored on
Duff’s two bagger. .

The men who handled the 1909 baseball team and
put it through are to be highly commended. Under the
conditions it is no wonder that only one game was won.
In the ﬁrst place they had no grounds upon which to
practice, without going all the way to \Vilkinsburg, and
ﬁxing hours that would suit all the players was well nigh
impossible. In one or two places the team was weak and
showed the loss of several good men of last year, but
considering the difficulties the season’s showing is not so
ignominious, for many of the games were lost by only a
single run.

the corner-stone of the Engineering Building was laid.
Although a large part of the splendor attendant upon the
previous ceremonies was lacking, there remained the im-
pressive fact that another step has been made in the pro-
gress of the University. With dignity and simplicity
the performance was carried out in a manner beﬁtting
the nature of the Institution.

On the same day ground was broken for the Medical
Building. Its construction has been placed in capable
hands, and the ﬁnished structure will be ready for occu-
pancy in the fall of 1910. As has been the rule through-
out, the most modern equipment will be used. No ex-
pense will be spared to provide i11 every sense the highest
state of cfﬁciency possible. Immediately after the com-
pletion of the School of Medicine, work upon the Dental
College will be begun, and the opening of the University
year of 1911-12 will, in all probability, ﬁnd the fourth
building on the campus.

The architectural idea of the completed University
will be much nearer fulﬁllment with the addition of these
two units, and while the present aspect may be disap-
pointing, it is well to await what the future will bring
forth. Not until then can be understood the magniﬁcence
of the selected plan.

\'\'ith the construction of the third and fourth build-
ings new links will be forged in the chain binding the in-
stitution together. A ﬁrmer organization of the student
body, a far—reaching grasp of the Various facilities

Seventeen

offered, a greater conception of the capacity of the school
—all these will assist in the ﬁnal realization of the hope
and expectations of the friends of the University.

HOCKEY

at Duquesne Garden, the prospects were par-

ticularly bright for promoting this branch of
athletics among the colleges. During the previous year
professional hockey had proven a decisive failure, and
on account of this the outlook for an Intercollegiate
League was very bright. By some diplomatic maneu-
vering, Pitt, State and Tech were ﬁnally organized
and formed the league. Through the kindness of the
management the Garden ofﬁcials assumed all ﬁnancial
obligations and arranged a schedule calling for a game
every Saturday during a period of sixteen weeks.

The League opened the season with Tech and Pitt
as opponents and then followed the State games in
the Christmas week. Through the intervention of the
Faculty at State College, their representatives return-
ed to school, disregarding the fact that their expenses

3 T the opening of the hockey season for 1909-10

had been guaranteed them. Following the withdrawal
of this team Case and Western Reserve were invited to
join the association, but this invitation met with no
encouraging response. Two more games were played
with Tech and the season at the Garden closed. There
seemed to be a lack of initiative energy necessary to
keep matters upon an interesting basis, inasmuch as
the indifferent attitude evident fostered no spirit
among the general student body.

Much credit for the excellent quality of hockey
displayed is due to the coaching of Dr. Milliken. He
is a graduate of the Toronto University of Canada,
and coach of the champion collegiate teams of that
section. His motive was impelled by the spirit of the

. game, for he had no mercenary idea in his instruction.

Conscientious he was, always out to help the team——a
friend, a man to be admired.

THE CAP AND GOVVN CLYB

 

The Cap and Gown Club was organized on the ﬁfteenth of January, 1908, with the purpose of fostering the
spirit of loyalty and sociability throughout the University. The difficulty of concentration resultant from the scat—

tering of the departments has retarded seriously the growth and success of the club, but with the coalescence of the

The Courant occurs monthly. It is the University publication, controlled by a board of ten members, of which
three do the work. The Courant appears on the twentieth of the month, but occasionally it misses a month and no
one knows the difference. The management is a contest between the editors and managers to discover whether the
former can spend the money faster than the others can gather it. The editors always win. The duty of the assistant
editors is to collect material for the editor to reject. The offices of the Courant are located in the Engineering Build-
ing and are elaborately furnished with a table and chair. Only the editor sits. Attempts to embellish the ofﬁce have
resulted in an artistic chaos. The general public is invited to call and read the ofﬁce rules.

The design above is intentionally ambiguous. It may be rega1'(le(l as a triumphal monument or a memorial tomb.
The latter interpretation is preferred. The Literary Society is temporarily dead, so to speak. Since the last Faculty
ball game, when the society pitcher literarily caused the ball to come into contact with the anatomies of six distinct
professors, the Philomathean has slept: the sleep of the just. \\'itl1 its passing several institutions of the college be-
come archaic history. The athletic festivities. previously mentioned. the annual picnic and frequent soirees will be no
more. Let us hope that it responds when the summons come again.

The purpose of the Classical Club is not to discover the derivation of Greek verbs, but rather to gather the in- The
teresting things from the lives of the ancients. Classicisin here has not yet reached its culmination, nor can it do Iogul
w

so without the cooperation of the students. Professors Scribner and Ullman have given their attention to the de-

velopment of the interest along this line with ﬂattering success.
While no screaming farces are staged, something attractive is always oﬁered and the time spent is not wasted.

The

W far it has succeeded in conducting lengthy talkfests every spring. Three months are usually spent in ﬁnding a subject
and a week in preparing to debate it. Allan Davis is the principal nuisance of the organization and is violently opposed

by George Baird. If the same eloquence were shown in the ﬁnal as in these preliminary contests, there would be no

difficulty whatever in obtaining the college championship. The ambition of the Union to defeat VVooster may be real-

ized in the future.

The Y. M. C. A. is a ﬂourishing organization. which is natural in these times of councilmanic scandals. lt ﬁlls
an important niche in the life of the University and has re formed more hopeless cases than any other one force. Aside Owl
from the essential purpose of the association, it leads in the amount of noise produced by any organization, the com-
bined efforts of a much-enduring piano and the voices of several imaginative hucksters. Its ineinbers can always be
distinguished at a long distance, either by means of their strenuous appearance or by their tendency to cultivate hirsute
ornaments. But the Y. M. C. A. is justly celebrated in virtue of its annual banquets.

The Billiken Club originated in the modification of the lunch habit up at the ol(l Courant room. The noonday
feeds were first pooled, then a banquet developed. There were four courses, each canned. The Faculty were enter-
tained at ﬂie ﬁrst pubhc feast at ulnch l)r. Frost ate a can of liaked lleans. Tlien the Ckreds xvere ﬂie guests of
lionor. chaperoned by liﬁty Elston. llns ended the year in a lﬂaze of glory.

The Billiken Club is very small and very exclusive. They even have the nerve to present theatricals. where the
four Billikens take seventeen parts. Their specialty is the development of original ideas. usually ones indicative of
psychological abnormality.

The requirements for membership are so difficult to ﬁll that the club will probably die with the graduation of the
present nienibers. 'Fhere are no cﬁﬁcers in pursuance of the theory of equahty before lhlhken.

has been done mainly by the members of the edi-

torial staff. Assistance has been rendered by sev-
eral of the students of the University both in the literary
and artistic departments. The Owl Board takes this op-
portunity to thank all who have aided in the work of com-
piling the book.

The introductory chant, ”/Ilnia M ater,” is from the pen
of Mr. George M. P. Baird. In addition to this, Mr. Baird
contributed to the Howl the poems, “The Editor’s Philoso-
phy,” “The Incori'igiblc,” "Behind the Scenes,” “Hc
ll/oula’n’t” and “The Forlorn Freshman.” The Board is
also indebted to him for the “Extract from the Archa:’l0gi-
cal Journal.” The f‘Dcdicatz'on of the N cw Gymnasium” is
the work of Mr. Carl F. Ohliger, and the drama, “Got the
Hook,” was written by Mr. Charles I. Cooper.

In the preparation of the student biographies, valuable
assistance was rendered by Mr. Claude V. Luce, of the
Sophomore Class, and Mr. Robert H. VVettach and Mr.
Philip O. Davis, of the Freshman Class. The formal in-
formation relating the the Faculty and students was fur-
nished by the ofﬁce forces of the various department‘).

The Art Editor acknowledges the services of Mr. War-
ren B.,Dygert, Engineering, ’Io; Mr. Chalmers Hall, Min-
ing, ’13, and Mr. Charles O. Morelli, Mining, ’I3. M1‘. Dy-
gert’s work was particularly appreciated because of the

T HE work of preparing the material for the 1911 Owl

number and excellence of his drawings. Mr. Baird con-
tributed the heading for the Billiken Club. Two football
cartoons were courteously offered by Mr. J. V. Early, staff
artist on the Pittsburgh Dispatch.

Mr. Frank H. Ramsey, Mining, ’1o, made the pictures
of the Sophomore—Freshman contest. For the football
photographs the Board is indebted to the Pittsburgh news-
papers. The remainder of the unpaid photographic work
was done by Mr. Reed and Mr. Marshall of the Photo-
graphic Board.

The individual engravings and grouped views were
made by the Northern Engraving Company of Canton,
Ohio. The Board desires to express their appreciation of
the advice and suggestions offered by Mr. A. P. Rickard of
this company. .

The printing and binding of the book has been done
by Murdoch, Kerr & Company, of Pittsburgh, who have
displayed much care and originality in the treatment of the
material. The Owl is a representative specimen of their
excellent work.

In the distribution of thanks those who have support-
ed the book by the insertion of advertisements must not
be forgotten. Without their aid the publication of the book
would be ﬁnancially impossible. It is urged upon the read-

ers of this volume that they return the good-will of these
business men.

THE ]E.lDlITOR’S PIHIIILOSOPHY

Oh, what’s the use of writing? Wc’rc but slaves to swift mutation,
The word which burned with meaning yestereven’s cold to—day;
You cannot get a tremor with last issue’s Great Sensation;
All’s life and death, all’s ﬂux and change, all’s hither and away.

We write about professors, but alas! they're evanescent,
The youthful ones are fired, or they gather fame and ﬂy.

And those who stay, in course of time, get moldy and senescent,
They pass; we mourn a season, and forget them by and by.

The article intended to provoke :1 revolution,
The exposé is ﬂat and stale before the ink is dry;

The thoughts that seemed so strong to us approach to dissolution
And the verses writ for laughter only make our readers cry.

The jokes that ﬂash so bright today are epitaphs to-morrow,
The “features” are forgotten by the world, ere fully read;

But it never quite forgets about the things we chanced to borrow,
Or to say our wit is acrid and our humor forced and‘ dead.

But, still we keep on writing, self-deceiving, self—deludi.ng,
Unmindful of the countless scribes forgotten long before;

The Nemesis of Printer’s Ink, all sense and peace precluding,
Hath followed us, doth follow us, andshall forevermore.

OPENING OF THE NEW GYMNASHUM

OT since the opening of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial
Hall have Pittsburgers so manifested their appreciation of
the city’s architectural beauties as they did at the dedica-

tion of the University’s new gymnasium.
The dedicatory procession formed at the Union Station at 5
A. M., whence it proceeded to iOa‘kland. At the head majestically
marched the Pitt Panrther drawing the chariot made famous by
Doug*herty's bridal tour. The students followed riding, some in
automobiles, some on horseback; in the rear marched the Faculty
in great disorder, most conspicuous among whom was Allan Davis
declaiming vociferously that he had to write a second act before
the Empire rnaitinee. The line was closed

Hall of Fame, Chancellor McCormick, and by others his most
active rival, Andy Carnegie; thus being interpreted as symbolizing
oratory or money. The Chancellor then made a few brief remarks,
occupying the rest of the morning, and promptly at twelve o’clock,
while Berger played a few parallel bars on the steam calliope of

our ‘chapel, the ponderous aluminum doors of the gym swung open

and the radiance of the radium illumination dazzled the breathless
crowd.

.Tl1en ensued a wild rush for the door, led by Prof. Scribner,
who was assigned by the Clathical Journal to compare the statuary
with that discovered at the South Pole. Space will not permit us

to describe or even to name the pieces that

Agency an-d the Billiken Club. No stop
was ma(le until Forbes Field was reached,

ful basketball team. After the panther ‘had
given three delightful screams, the mem-
bers of the team were raised on the shoul-
ders of the Faculty and the march was
continued to the Mining Building, where
the column was joined by a representation
from the ladies of the college. These were
selected with much diﬂiculty, personal

occupied the foyer, but attention may be
called to some of the divisions. One sec-
tion commemorated those students who
had paid all their class assessments, an-
other was devoted to the VVise and Other-
wise, while the balcony was ﬁlled with a
collection of fossils of professors from the
Observatory Hill, North Side. The ﬁgure
that seems to be the center of interest was
that of a small benign Sc.D. gazing in-
tently at a watch and holding ﬁrmly a pack
of schedule cards. Behind him stands a

beauty being «the basis of choice; ﬁnally, Plzotoby Car]!-‘, 011/Iggy
however, thirty—four were chosen. While
awaiting the marchers, the ladies had been entertained by Mrs.
Linhart in the third building, recently completed.

As the moving stairway was still out of order, the column was
compelled to climb the hill, and when the summit was reached a
pause was made to draw up the ﬁle so that exit might be facilitated
in case of ﬁre. This gave all an opportunity to examine the ex-
terior of the building. On one side of the steps stood a huge statue
of Turnvater Jahn, and facing him from the opposite side s-tood
Father Pitt, his ‘hands extended as if welcoming to our city the
father of gymnastics. From the keystone above the door projects
an ambiguous head, thought by some to represent the leader of the

huge cider barrel from whose sides dangle
several drinking cups and pretzels. T-he
inscription reads “Alma Mater.” At the sound of a gong the vis-
itors assembled in the gymnasium proper, where the exercises of
the day were to be held. The empty swimming pool, furnished with
chairs, made a comfortable sloping parquet, over which extended
the pulpit for the occasion in the shape of a springing board. The
students occupied these seats and the faculty distributed themselves
about on the window sills and apparatus. Doc Wallgren, the mas-
ter of ceremonies, then rose to introduce Joe Thompson, the orator
of the day. ‘Considerable diﬂiculty was encountered in bringing the
faculty representatives to order, and even after the speaker had
commenced there was some disturbance caused by Doctor Dyess,

who persisted in exclaiming that some one was making fun of his
red necktie.

_Toe read for his text the entire Book of Leviticus and very
interestingly explained why it recommends cigarette smoking for
football "players. His speech was followed by the singing of the
Dedication Hymn from the poetic pen of Professor Chambers.
The refrain proved popular:

“Little springs and dashes,
Bathings in the pool,

A course in fancy splashes
Miake an ideal school.”

A re-markable dedicatory ode was then read by the Poet
Laureate of the Freshman Class. I-ts perfection in rhyme
and meter, not to mention the marvellous poetic phras-
ing, may best be imagined from the opening couplet:
“Oh, alas how happy are we all to have a brand new

gymnasium,
Then come, attic muse, and inspire me to celebrate
this glorious occasion."

After the injured had been removed, Doc. Wallgren cau-
tiously ventured to the end of the springing board and com-
menced his discourse. He said in part:

“I am keeping an appropriation by the trustees to preserve
this building in its present condition.” The Chancellor rubbed
his hand over the trapeze on which he was hanging and found
it covered with dust, then cleared his throat. A groan
arose from the students in the dry pool.

“Oh, yes,” Doc went on, “this pool will have water
in it 011 Sundays to supply the Magee Memorial Foun-
tain.” At the conclusion of this address, the announce-
ment was made that because of the lateness of the hour
the remaining speakers will be carefully protected
until the following "Friday. Manager Hurst invited all
present to be the guests of the Athletic Committee at a
sumptuous banquet in the Cozy Restaurant in conse-
quence of which the student season books next year will
sell at the reduced rate of six dollars.

of Moliere, the mock heroics and satiricals of

lloileau and the pulpit eloquence of Massilon, but
the real pyrotechnical display and eclat is capably han-
dled by Dr. 0. C. Gaub. Now, if Otto had lived in the
days of old, when cast iron clothing and malleable iron
chemises were sportively worn to the joust and the good
old knights spent the nights passing the tankards and
bidding dull care be gone, he would have saved money
on leather and cravats, and mayhap nurtured the hardy
cacti and pruneless shrubbery around Capernaum. But
having the pickiof eleven cities similar to Terre Haute,
Montijo, Tacoma and Trachoma, he declared in favor of
Allegheny. He did ﬁrst rate in the public school, and
while in High School he mastered pinochle, ping pong,
hay rides, calf love and hen parties. This acerbation was
at its height when he graduated in 1901.

Discovering that the “highly scientiﬁc, codiﬁed, Chi-
rurgia in the hands of hair—splintting dialecticians” was
causing gangrene in the land, he got a hunch that he
would do time at the University of Pennsylvania. While
a debutante there he learned that if the world owes you
a living you should collect it with a Winchester. Some
of the boys wore cutaways in the morning, frocks and
violets in the afternoon, and even low—necked Tuxseudos
in the evening, but Gobbie was a real Beau Brummel
himself and had a line of waistcoats and male jabots that
carry on a conversation of their own without waiting

YOU may rant of the tragedy of Racine, the comedy

for Easter. The boys used to sip the juice of Lethe and
produce a ruddy glow about the Quaker City, but often
lost their habitual sang froid in a wild and impetuous
ﬂight from the gendarme. Between teasing the zither
and whistling such airs as “Vi Ranviso O Luoglii
Ameni,” he managed to pick up a lot of mental bric-a-
brac useful in surgery. After jollying his Uncle Cyrus
into a ﬁnancial handout, he chartered a Cunard and
knocked about the Atlantic till he landediin Bordeaux.
Here the custom officials gleefully mailed him to Bern,
where he showed the Switzers that all is not cheese that
ﬂitters. Besides inventing a buttoner that fastens on
your shoes so that they never come off, he made a pastel
of Bjornstjerne Bjornsen and wrote his initials on the
skull of Talleyrand. Meanwhile Gobbie ﬁlled up the
boring intermissions with Surgery at the Dan Patch rec-
ord. Unlike his disgruntled contemporaries, he gave his
patients their money’s worth and made incisions from
Alpha to Omaha, using a vacuum cleaner on the viscera.
After a brief struggle he decided to return to America.
He struck Allegheny on Thanksgiving Day—that day
eight men jumped into the Youghiogheny and six others
tried to stand on the American climate by the aid of a
lariat around the neck and thence to the chandelier——sul-
phuric cocktails were tabooed and the Allegheny General
Hospital was rapidly bungalowed. The smart set loy-
ally rallied and the conservatory was full of ennuied ap-
pendices. After a while I. Chris heard the hubbub and

had many an impromptu loaf there, and it ﬁnally ended
up with Gobbie in the bull ring doing the Speaker Can-
non. There he had the real simoon faded to a low moan
—epitomizing, travesting and caricaturing in the same
breath, keeping eyes and ears open to a classy effect.

VVe love his clea11—shaven smile and Cupid form, and
even if he doesn't walk a la Madame Delsarte, he gets

there. He wears large pumps, but “big shoes are to be
preferred to tight breeches.” Any evening you can see
his slippers over the front stoop and watch him knock a
few million plunks out of a harp. Now, really, isn’t he
great? Professor, we trust you will long continue to
edify us. May the bichlorides keep thee ever safe.

brate the birth, growth, obesity and simple gas—

tritis of Dr. J. J. Buchanan, and all about the
hamlet one ‘hears a loud buzz of pride and pre—historic
drollery. Here amongst the fragrant apricots, sweet
peas and prowling tom—cats his genius insiduously began
incubation. Like the famous child Handel he was fond
of an organ, but, unfortunately, it was a different organ
than that from which George Handel catheterized his glor-
ious oratorios. Neighbors began to miss tame pheas-
ants, affectionate goldﬁsh and peevish Pomeranians; and
Buck was looked upon with suspicion. He showed an
acute inﬂammatory interest for bones and was end man
for all local amateur minstrel shows. His interest in
fractures was so phenomenal that he slept in a fracture
box, shaved with a splint, smoked aseptic peat and wore
a Gibson bandage to school instead of the usual skull
cap. Naturally he began to slough in history, etc., not
knowing King Canute from Charlie Culberson. Often
he was late to school, owing to lingering in the highway,
in hope that some gink would rupture his downie and

put a slit in his cranial landscape. Finally the old school-
master, after hesitating between anguish and strabismus,
had to knock on him and Buck’s father used some hard
words and a bed slat. Dating from this time on he put
kinks in his cranium at a great rate. VVhile other boys
played hob with their time or loafed at Ike Weisenstein’s
shoe shop, he lingered at home and kept the meter going
like a harness matinee, reading light literature, such as
Fouillehouzes’ “Diagrams of Cranio-Cerebral Relations
in Adults.” By this time he had dissected all the cinch
bugs, Hessian ﬂies, pip and contumely that were at hand
and had a small—sized bone foundry near the porte
cochere, but his father, having conservative views and a
reﬁned olfactory nerve, bade him nullify the obituaries;
so he repaired to the City of Brotherly Love, and here,
between the blue blood, thee’s and thou’s and all-around
Fletcherisms, he made hectic progress and was ready to
graduate shortly after he matriculated. Looking over
the map he decided to take a jaunt through France, ‘Ger-
many and Switzerland, and a year later was sauntering
up the Champ Elysees with a No. 28 French Sound, Pall

Mall spats and an eight carat stud. From the lovely and
expensive human hive he migrated to Vienna, where he
discovered that if ignorance is bliss he was the jolliest
bug on the atlas. Here he wrote a brochure entitled
“How to Handle Bones; with Tips from Famous Crap-
shooters.” He also wrote a series of articles appearing
in the Cynical Medicine on “Egyptian Athletes,” naming
Moses as the most eminent, as he was considered ﬁrst in
the Bull Rushes.

He runs a ﬁne limousine car and loves to crawl

under the affair, where he can better learn its regional
anatomy. Buck conducts rich clinics at the Mercy Hos-
pital, and no one ever leaves before attendance is taken,
All of his exams are similar to the third degree and those
who pass go to the Battle Creek Sanitarium.

He has done well. His efforts to popularize surgery
have not been in vain, and he deserves a Carnegie Hero
Medal for accomplishing so much against such heavy
odds.

HORATIO V. DILLER.

Bishop Horatio V. Diller, B. S., O. K., M. D.,
through the kind a11d expensive efforts of Scotland Yard
has successfully traced his ancestry to Diogenes, 320
B. C., who was a Greek philosopher and tight Wad. At
an early age he renigged on the chaﬁng dish
and relied on his own lunch hooks instead of
Rogers’ Brass Silver. At a tender age “Dill”
exhibited marked literary talent and his parents,
though poor and pious, allowed it to take its course,
with the result that he soon secured the editorship of the
Sunday Herald and the Prayer Review—here he came to
notice by ﬁne articles; as “jonahs I Have Whaled,” “Dr.
Job and His Patients,” “How to Darn the Holy Sab-
bath,” etc., etc. Living, as it were, in the sweet pure at-
mosphere of Lamb and Goldsmith, the subtle perfumes
of Oscar Wilde and Verlaine and the reﬁning inﬂuence
of Nietzsche and Spinoza, his immature mind was indeed
exquisitely moulded and cultured. After making his toi-

let with a hymn and a nasal douche he was prepared for
a day of legitimate drudgery, only broken by the noon
meal of artichokes and Filet de Boeuf a la Pocahontas,
after which came a half hour with Morpheus, from which
he returned refreshed and whistling to spend the after-
noon with the goldﬁsh and the Police Gazette.

At this time his Creatorean halo deserted him and
wrought a great change in his personality. Despondent
over failure to get a plug hat to ﬁt, he almost gave up,
but ﬁnally started out and so moved his audiences that
great crowds clamored about the box ofﬁces—to get their
money back. Hard times overtook “Dill” at this critical
period and with reluctance on his part and joy on that of
the congregation he gave up his choir work and became
Chef de Cuisine of a small celery farm where he harassed
the deadly hook worm and plucked the fragrant night-
blooming bull thistle. Here his Chesterﬁeldian culture

was repulsed by the wholesale gaucherie and porcine ple-

beianisms; the innocuous desuetude gnawed holes in his
unsophisticated soul, so one night whilst his genial hosts
were playing their usual nocturnal nasal symphony he
departed with a slab of seal—brown gingerbread, a pair
of stoga boots and an Ascot tie. After reaching the
banks of the Kinnickinnick he won the approval of the

_ plain clothes men and met many folk of real inﬂuence

and afﬂuence.

Just at this time a nonagenarian aunt of his slid
through the pearly gates from the effects of a Phenol
gargle, leaving him college tuition, military brushes and
twelve ecru tidies; and when “Dill” recovered from sur-
prise and the l3arber’s itch he was through his ﬁrst year
and perfectly calm, bald and spirited. In his Senior year
he wrote a series of articles entitled “Entitative Cachato-

logy and its Relation to Malacostraca." These articles
brought him before the public, but by hustling up an
alley he escaped popular favor and permanent injury.
Dating from this time he evinced great interest in Ner-
vous Diseases, Hair Rcstorers and Drtina and by the
combined efforts of Houdini, Kellar and Sandow he got
on the Medical Faculty while the Dean was at a Hurdy—
gurdy recital on Lake Titicaca. He won respect by writ«
ing “Ten Nights in a Taxicab or Why Cigarettes Leave
Home.” Refusing to wear a green Fedora hat, he be-
came more popular and stouter. V\7ith a bald head that

CHARLES E. ZIEGLER.

Dr. Charles E. Ziegler is an intricate combination of
German text-books, succinct science and academic cra-
nium; being accustomed to sleeping with both eyes open,
he caught Opportunity knocking at his door and handed
him one with a blackjack. When four years old he fell
off the piazza and lit on a gum drop and for weeks lin-
gered between convalescence and devilment; for a while
his bewhiskered parent feared he would lose his little
yodeler, but unfortunately he recovered and shone like a
union suit ad. He spent his early youth drinking Moxie
and watching the chain gang swat the boulevards.
When nineteen years of agehis forehead bulged notice-
ably and he then stopped wearing skull caps and bought

his sweat bands in New York. Coming from a dynasty
possessing blood by no means ditch water, the village
wise man predicted a future in an electric light plant.
Here he was to go to Medical School and so he set out
for Phillie full of prunes, hope and hayseeds.

He matriculated at two o’clock Sunday morning at
the Uni of Penn and here he studied so viciously that he
rapidly lost his hair. Neither toupees nor frappes could
assauge his well earned misery. But unlike John D. he
kept his baldness to himself.

Leaving dear Old Penn he jimmied his way to Dres-
den and Berlin and spent considerable time separating
Grand Opera from German Cheese. Receiving word

that an uncle in Shadagee had fallen through a church
floor he stored his tennis shoes a11d croquet set with the
kindly pawn broker and set sail for the States in a party
with some sociable anarchists. Arriving, he became a
favorite with the profession owing to his verse which
appeared in the Clinical Mag:

l shun the modern Iconoclast
And welcome the operator;

I laud the good old Cranioclast
And Smellie’s perforator.

I praise to skies the Voorhees bag
Although there’s no inﬂator;
Of its uses I can always brag
And Doc Hirst's ﬁne dilator.

Then comes Tarnier's basiotribe,
It certainly is a peach;

Its uses I don’t dare describe,

“ —3ut never on a breech.”

(\\"e omit the other sixty verses because of lack of
space.)

The Human Society then secured his services and he
agreed to teach at Pitt Medical. Here he lectured at the
rate of 50,000 words an hour with gestures from \\’ild

of his talk consists of a jointed ﬁshing pole with which
he elucidates. He is a great lover of ﬂowers and the
author of the “Monograph on Gladioli and Daffydils,"
also “\\'hat to Raise in Hades ;"' etc. But after all is said
and done, you still fall short of the truth about Charlie.

The College of the University is completely equipped. The Faculty has been enlarged so that all the
courses required can be given. The group system allows students to specialize without neglecting their
general culture.

Pittsburgh is the center of some of the greatest engineering industries in the world, and students in the
Engineering School have access to all the large plants where they can study modern practice in its highest
development and practical application. The cooperative plan by which students take practical work in
manufacturing establishments will be introduced in the School of Engineering for the year 1910-11, and the
same principle will be extended to other departments wherever practicable.

The Professional Schools of the University are thoroughly modern in their equipment and methods,
and oHer excellent opportunities to those preparing for professional life.

The Summer Term begins the last week in June and continues ten weeks. Special courses are provided
for teachers. Opportunity will be given to make up conditions. Credit toward a degree will be allowed
for work done in the Summer Term.

The Summer Term for 1910 will be held in the new Buildings in Oakland. In October, 1910, the
work of the School of Medicine will be transferred to the new Medical Building in Oakland.

THE. RETRJIBUTJIQN OF REMORSE

THE BRINGING BACK OF THE BRAINLESS BANDITS’ BOOTY.

Prologue.

A group of weary men moved slowly in the direction of the
Rume Curaunte. In their midst they carried a priceless treasure,
which they guarded with scrupulous care. As the sun was sinking
into the blood—re(l \Vest, they reached their destination. From the
cave came a singular ﬁgure, in appearance similar to the travelers,
but whose age was belied by the dark curls clustering upon his high,
white brow. This was the Hermit Bard of the Mountains. The
leader addressed him in a \'()lC(‘ of sadness.

“The time approaches when we must go. You alone of us will
remain. VVe entrust to you our treasure, the Mystic Spune. De-
liver it to those who come after us in the manner i11 which we have
received it.”

The Bard replied while the tears coursed down his cheeks.

“I will do my best.” Then the ﬁgures faded into the veil of the
twilight.

CHAPTER I.
Temptation.

Upon the brink of a precipice overltanging the trail to the
Rume Curaunte lay a band of sinister men. Upon the face of each
was written the cunning of the desert bandit. As they gazed upon
the wayfarers below, their faces were conyulsed with greed. One.
a tall handsome Villain, known as Muckraker Mike, spoke in his
peculiar dialect.

“Bcgorra, byes. and it's thinking Oi am that we has betther go
down and stale that Spune.” But his neighbor. Fresh the Ruffneck
answered with contempt:

“Naw, wait till that crazy poet gets it.”

Little did the depraved minds of the desperadoes comprehend
that it was for them that the Spune was intended. Since the year
when the first of men had settled in the Yuni Valley had the Spune

been handed down time after time, but never before had tlmse, into
whose trust it was to be given, proved so unworthy. Suddenly the
stillness of the night was broken by the voice of the leader, Richar(l

the Tex.
“We will throw the bones and the winner will get the stuff

 

while the poet is asleep.” No voice was raised in dissent. Eagerly
the lots were cast and as the owl's shriek echoed through the dark~
ness, the choice of fate fell upon the shiftiest of all, the notorious
Breezy Blow.

CH APTER II.
Execution.

The ghostly white trail faded away into the darkness of the
night. In peaceful slumber reposed the weary poet, hugging to his
breast the precious Spune. A few dim stars struggled through the
raven canopy. Then in the distance against the lurid trail appeared
a shadowy form, growing larger and larger as it stealthily ap-
proached. At last the face of Breezy Blow was revealed at the
threshold of the poet’s cave. Silently the form slipped within,
then again the stillness of the night was resumed. From within the
cavern the sound of careful movements drifted into the open with
out. Then appeared the shadowy form, clasping the Mystic Spune.
Hurriedly it moved far down the trail into the indistinct beyond.

CHAPTER III.
Remorse.

Six months had passed since the disappearance of the Spune.
After his companions had passed away, the Mountain Bard, in res«
ignation had given up the search. But deep in the hearts of the
perpetrators of the theft, the rankling thoughts of their guilt still
held sway. Too late they realized that their deeds had been those
of simple children and willingly would they have returned the
Spune. But now there were two more settlements in the Yuni Val-
ley, whose founders had decreed that a time should be given each
day to laughter at the simplicity of the robbers. So they sought to
ﬁnd a way whereby they might ‘return the Spune without betraying
to the world that their conscience was awakened at last. The
brightest minds of the band, Muckraker Mike, Allright Wade,
Baldy Weeg and Davy Carlos struggled to ﬁnd a way to restore the
Spune. They knew that the end was nearing also for them and that
they would not rest content until they had been justly invested with
the mystic treasure. Finally in the fertile brain of one a plan de-
veloped itself equal in subtility to the wonderful plan of the theft.
VVord was passed abroad that at midnight all the band must meet.
Then in the secret gathering was disclosed by Fresh the Ruffneck

 

the scheme for the return of the Spune, in whispers so low that
even the coyotes, who slunk about near the circle could hear naught
but the moaning of the hills.

_CHAPTER IV.
Return.

Into the Yuni Canon wandered confnsedly a large party of
young, verdant explorers. On all sides the welcome of nature
seemed extended to them and they were satisﬁed to settle them~
‘selves in peace. \/Vithout suspicion they took up their abode in the
lowest part of the valley. Suddenly on a day in winter appeared a
savagz: ban(l who seized six of their number. Mysteriously they
were spirited away, to be seen never again until, they robed in the
garments of the (lead.

The venerable poet, with locks still black and curly, stood by
the entrance of his cavern and gazed into the distance. Far away
he saw moving quickly toward him a group of sepulchral ﬁgures
clad in white. Like the angels of Retribution they hastened to him
and he saw that they bore the Mystic Spune. Silently they deliv-
ered it to him and vanished. ‘

Epilogue.

The dwellers in the Canon of Yuni marveled at the wonder of
the Restoration. Some thought that Providence had intervened,
but none suspected the robbers. Then the band arose and smote
themselves on their puffed-up chests and said “What mighty men
are We.” And so the dwellers knew that they had acquired frigid
extremities and misplaced their neurotic power. But such as they
were they were destined to receive the Spune and at last the
poet was able to do his best.

>2: >1: >:< ac >x<

Where the alkaline drifts of the desert are parted by a brook-
let’s ripples sleeps the band of the robbers. As traveler passes
in his journey, he may read the epitaph—lt is more blessed to steal
than to receive.

River, Professor 1. X. Kavate, of the University of Pitts-
burgh, found an interesting and important writing dated
A.D. 1909. This priceless manuscript, which is printed up-
on some substance of a dull—brown color, is in the primitive
American dialect and was found many meters below the
surface in the debris of a red—briek building, many hun-

dred years older than the surface ruins, and believed by

some scientists to be the remains of the old University of
Pittsburgh, which occupied that site. Professor I. X. Ka-
vate, with the assistance of Dr. VV. E. D'Sipher, has made
a translation of the script which we give herewith. The
notes are by Professor O. N. Marjyn, who represented this
bureau in the investigations.

TR.\NSL.\TION.

Now it came to pass in the reign of Sam-E-l\/lac
[President of the United States in 1909] that the Philoma-
theans [a secret religious order of doubtful character]
challenged the Faculty of the University to a game of base-
ball. [This game was a kind of battle in vogue among our
semi-barbaric ancestors, and was the purported invention of
the demi-god Honus Wag-Ner (l'/Vag-Ner: a driruer of the
More extinct cquus), whose temple has been recently un-
earthed near the present University site.] Then said Pro-

fessor Fetterman to his cohorts, “\’\/hat say you, 0
Brothers of the Flunk, [ﬂuu/8: a niar/r of merit much sought
after by students], shall we do battle for the honor of the
Faculty?" Then said the Faculty unto him, as with one
voice, “Yea, for it is meet so to do.”

[At this point the nianuscri[>t is ille{/z'ble.]

[It co/2tfI1ues.j Now when they were come unto the
place of conﬂict, great was the wonder of all the people, for
verily Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. There were “Gusky” liarrington and Luke Acker of
the Mining School, Jordon, the starchaser, and Captain
V\/allgren, of the Pitt Cadets, Lariat Bill, Old King Brady,
Kiddo Harris, Fussers Rich and Ries, and, last and longest,
Squire Beck, all in robes of various colors, patterns and
vintages. And after them came the student horde; Mar-
shall of the pink coiffure, Burtie the Beanpole, Richardson
the Irish—Swede and bold Sir Clarence, the Knighte of Con-
neaute, to say nothing of Gumarm Grier, Paddy O’Connor,
Geordie Bard, St. Alter, Kinky Carl and Charlzcoop, the
VVylie Avenue dramatist.

Grier was pitcher for the Philomatheans and threw
the ball with such murderous intent that he slew six pro-
fessors and struck out [horribly injured] twelve others,
whereat was the rejoicing great among the Philos and the
hearts of the spectators were glad.

Then rose up Fetterman, like to a lion in wrath and
cried unto his men: “O woe and well-a—dayl Shall we be
slaughtered so by these young youths?” “Nay, and of a truth

and the right shall prevail.” [The umpire was a priest who
otheiated at these baseball festivals and was sometimes of-
fered up as a living sacriﬁce to the God Fan.]

[The next section cannot be deeiphered.]

[It continues.] Now waxed the conﬂict most furious
and professor after professor came home. [This probably
refers to a journey which is described in the obliterated pas-
sage preceding.] Sad were the Philomatheans and bitter,
for the battle went against them and the faithless Co-eds
[Co-ed: An abnormal species of the ancient female which
frequented colleges in large numbers for the purpose of get-
ing life meal—tieleets.] turned down their thumbs and made
the eye of the goo—goo [an extinct animal] at the deceitful

THE WASTE ASKETA

Unfortunately for the editor he was born with a soft heart.
He really (lid not have the moral stability to throw some of the
stuff out that they gave him after he promised to publish it. So,
as the next best thing, in a spirit of recognition of justice, he placed
it in the waste basket. This is the waste basket. Because of lack
of space, we are able to mention only a few of the more despicable
crimes perpetrated upon his innocent head.

Occasionally we were awarded ohoice bits of poetry. With
the utmost reluctance did the editor accept three peeks of assorted
poems by Jawrg Baird. A few of the titles are “Learning to
Dance,” or the “Hop Scotch”; “Under the Spreading Chestnut
Tree,” a collection of puns; and “The Tail of an Overcoat.” Miss
Alma Elizabeth Frederica Boehrig offered an ode relating to the
infernal regions, which we were unable to print in the expurgated
edition. Miss Lillie McIntosh contributed an excellent poem, but
the lines were so short that the punctuation concealed the words.

Learned monographs on various subjects were delivered in
vans. “Spreading the Gospel with a Shovel,” by \/V. Gray Alter,
and “Wives of Great Men,” by ‘G. M. Dougherty, represent the
more philosophical. In the department of travel and description,
“The Conquest of Cincinnati,” by E. Gertrude Levin, and “F-lor-
ence, the Beautiful,” by F. Melvina Franklin, excelled. The ﬁction
is well represented by two of the best offerings, “The Mystery of
the Nlisplace-d Eyebrow,” by A. Suss Pender, and “Cort Love
Secrets,” by Austin Lynch. Mr. Charles H. Bode composed a bal-
lad especially for the Howl entitled “Here’s to dear old Jail.”

It seems that a professor of Latin, Ullman by name, has a
grouch on a person named Horace. This Horace fellow, in a mo-
ment of mental distraction, wrote a few polite duns in Latin. These
have become classical under the name of “Horace’s Odes.” To
show up the poor departed Horace, this Ullman has a class of his

translate the Odes into English verse. Horace is buried near Mt.
Etna; t.herefore the recent disturbances.

In regard to these translations, they are a revised form of the
Inquisition. The rhymes are in all cases original and occasionally
a line imitates a centipede. The worst of ‘these was produced by
the originator of the Luce style of rhythm. His crime follows:

Rugged Soracte stands white with deep snow
V\-’hich threatens the fores-t to overthrow

By the weight of its thick hanging crystals.
The rivers under their armors of ice

Slide lazily onward, silent as mice,

The same that were summer's swift prodigals.

Notice that? Pretty nifty. But don't go till you hear the sec-

end verse:
(

But then, why should you care, Thaliarchus,

How much the cold makes even Caesar cuss?
You need fear no bad change in the weather.
Let generous heat from your log ﬁre ooze
VVhirle you ﬁll your skin with the sparkling booze,
Bottled, now four years ago or longer.

This was bad enough, but the last straw was strewed when one
Charles I. Cooper wrote a “magic trelodrama” entitled “Get the
Hook.” This Cooper worked a light down in the Nixon once and
since has become imbued with the idea that he is an Arbiter of the
Drayma. For the beneﬁt of the ignorant, he endeavors to give us
a small satire on modern stagecraft. He has difficulty selecting a
title, whereupon we suggested “An Egg in the Hand is Worth

‘Two on the Shirt Front.” But we have to print the stuff, so here

it is :

ACT II.

Scene: The garden of the same, late in the afternoon. On the
background drop is painted an oraiige—colored sun, representing sun-
set. At L. are seen bushes, trees and ﬂowers, the leaves manu-
factured of parafﬁne and the ﬂowers of cloth (like the ladies’ Easter
hats) Estelle in a different dress.

Thaddeus: My tootsey—wootsey, darling girlie.
I.-‘ste!le.' Dear Tad.

_Tl1addcus.' Light of my life, my joy. (Pulls handkerchief out
of his pocket, places ‘lt at Estelle’s feet, kneels before her, carefully
arranges the creases in his trousers.) My Joy, I mean, Miss Fudge,
Wlll you be my wife?

Estelle: Sweet Taddie, how lovely of you to ask me. You
popped the question like a regular matinee idol. like Wlilliam Faver—
sham. Sure, I’ll be your wife—.—now rise and kiss me. (Thaddeus
embraces and kisses her.) (It is gradually getting darker, the foot-
lights green ‘and deep red. Enter Simon, quietly like Mephisto in
Faust, stops in the center of_ the stage. . Thaddeus approaches Simon
and the latter whispers in his ear.) (Simon exits like Banquo in the
banquet scene.)

Thaddeus: Oh!

Estelle: VVhat did he tell you?

Thaddeus: He reminded me that it is the middle of the sec-
ond act.

Estelle: Well, what of it?

Tl1adde14s.' \/Vvhy, don’t you know? The climax of the play;
things have to take a turn now.
Estelle: What?
Thaddeus (irritated) : Don’t say “What.”

Estelle: Oh, Tad!

Thaddeus: VVell, that's my nanie——Thaddeus it is—Thaddeus
B. Plus. You understand me, Thaddeus B.

Estelle: But Tad (assumes an imploring position).

Tliaddeus: Yes, but you are not writing this play. Impossible.

Estelle: Oh (swoons). ~

Thaddeus: Help, help, she faints, poor Estelle.

Estelle: You do love me?

Thaddeus (lights cigarette): Ha, ha, -ha, so sorry, so sorry
(exit).

' Enter Simon.

Simon: Miracle of miracles!

Estelle: Go, go, you must exit now so that I may deliver my
soliloquy.

Emit Simon.

The Villain Simon must be foiled; so it is in all melodramas.
This apparent diﬂiculty is only for emotional purposes, expressly
brought in by the au'thor for the human interest. But this play?
What is it? A tragedy, a tragic melodrama.

Enter Simon.

Simon: Vvrong, wrong, look at the program, it says a magic

trelodrama. (Hands her the program.)
Estelle: Merciful heavens!
Simon: But say, that’s enough, this is no continuous vaude-

iville show. _

Thadueus: Here—you two—is this a Bernard Shaw play?

Estelle: No, we are merely trying to deceive the audience as
to the ﬁnal result.

Simon: So you won’t be mine? -

Thaddeus: Go away (goes over closer to Simon). I’ll write
you‘ an order on the propertyman for some stage money to calm
your feelings.

Simon: You cur! (draws the pistols)_. V‘/ith these stage pis-
tols I’ll ﬁll you full of lead——stage lead—br1ck dust.

Thaddeus: Don’t do it, you’ll spoil the play. Out, you villain.
(Pushes him off the stage.) And now, Estelle, my dear——

NORTH SIDE :: 2: :: PITTSBURGH, PA.
FOUNDED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, 1825

HE FACULTY consists of six professors
and four instructors. Modern methods
of study are employed in all depart-
ments. The course of study is thor-
ough and practical, and is intended to
train men as pastors and preachers.
Committees of the Faculty and the
Board of Directors are co—operating in
the revision of the curriculum. It is
expected that the revised curriculum
will be put in operation next September.
A complete description of the new
courses will be published after they are

adopted by the Board of Directors. A special course is of-
fered in Practical Christian Ethics, in which students investi-
gate the problems of city missions, settlement work, and other
forms of Christian activity. The City of Pittsburgh aﬂords
unusual opportunities for the study of social problems.

The students have exceptional library facilities. The Seminary
Library of 34,000 volumes contains valuable collections of works in
all departments of Theology, but is especially rich in Exegesis and
Church History; the students also have access to Carnegie Library,
which is situated within ﬁve minutes’ walk of the Seminary buildings.

A post—graduate scholarship of $400 is annually awarded to the
member of the graduating class who has the highest rank and who
has spent three years in the institution. A gymnasium and grounds
aﬂord ample opportunity for recreation.

All the buildings are located on the West Park, one of the most
beautiful residence districts of Greater Pittsburgh.

CHANDLER CARTER CLARK, Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh High School, 1906.

Clark is the only fellow we know who ca11 avoid all the impor-
tant points in a thirty—minute discussion. He beams benignly through
his spectacles and concludes with a smile of satisfaction.

CHARLES ISADORE COOPER, Pittsburgh.

JEAN HAMILTON, North Side.
Allegheny High School, 1905.

She is knowledge boiled down to about a quart. Deeply appre-
ciative of humor and near—hurnor, which she receives with prolonged
internal laughter. Protests permanently at the professors ex-
pectations.

FREDERICK DANNENBERG HAWKINS, Baltimore.
Baltimore High School, ’06. Literary Society. Science Club.

He excels in reciting Bobbie Burns’ verse and in drawing biolog-
ical pictures. If he were any more erect he would step upon the
back of his head. Grins at anything, even something pathetic.

her to be a great light some «lay iii the poetical line.

ELIZABETH GERTRUDE LEVIN, Pittsburgh.

Pit1.sbur9;h High School, ’07. Literary Society. Classical Club, Secretary,

crets will shortly be published in twenty volumes.

MARY EMMA MCKEAN, Avalon.

Avalon "High School, 1906. HON.

Mary is a large bunch of opinion surrounded by an atmosphere
of reserve. She considers all philosophers and biologists as heretics
and possesses a deep fear of straining her voice. Invented the Gib-
son walk.

ERIC JOHAN NORLANDER, McKeesport.
Sioux Falls College. Iﬁniversity of Chicago.

The gentleman of the Scandinavian name 1S afﬁliated with a
strongly developed sense of humor. He tells a joke in a way
that suggests great personal grief. Mistaken usually for a mem-
ber of the faculty.

THE STORY OF THE FORLORN FRESHMAN.

And it came to pass in the reign of Sani—E—Mac that the
Student Senate gave a dance in the Mosque of the En—gi—neer.
unto which there came a lireslnnan and with him a woman of
his tribe. Now came also unto the dance an instructor of the
college of Un—i—Pitt. and he, liaving no lnaiden, (lid take the
maiden from the Freshman boldly and in deliance of the Law of
Manyers, danced with her and took her back unto the tents of
her father. Then waxed the Freslnnan exceeding wroth, but
being impotent by reason of the power of the genii Flunk. a slave
of the learned one, he made shift to hide his anger, and coming
unto the singer Garg—E—Bar(l sang i11 this wise:

OH! We /‘ruﬁr ADORE ouuzjse/we

I’m only a green, untutored Fresh,
But my good coin I spent;

She danced with me till the other came,
And then away she went.

Away she went with the Prof, and I
Was left without redress,

For I’m in his class and cannot pass
If he gives me an E or less.

I’m only a young unnoticed Fresh,
But I have feelings, too;

Say, wouldn’t you growl if 21 boun<ler’s trick
Had been done like that to you?

If a bounder’s trick had been done to you,
You’d likely growl and swear,

But what can :1 I’resl1man do to :1 Prof
And a shanghied lady fair?

 

I’m only a small, unhappy Fresh
Time ﬂies, revenge is sweet—

And when my college days are o'er,
The Prof and I will meet.

We’ll meet, and I will thrash him well,
And ‘thus the price he’ll pay,

For the girl I took to the Chapel dance
And didn’t take away.

RAYMOND LEROY ARCHER, West Homestead.
Beaver College, 1907. Y. M. C. A. President, ’09.

Archer and Daugherty compose the
Methodist Church conferences. The
eye—glasses give Leroy the title of
handsomest Co—ed. We suspect that
Archer is married, but he refused to
be interviewed after the honeymoon
trip of his partner in a crate. He
played basketball once, since when his
conscience has oppressed him mightily.
Talks to the Co—eds too much for min-
ister. Flunks in Bible History.

 

EARL EMERSON BOREN, Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh High School, 1906. Pittsburgh College. Science
Club. Cosmopolitan Club. Chemical Club. Student Assist-
ant in (,hemistr_v.

Tuhis yellow—haired chap is the big
man in the Chemistry department.
Knows all about Chemistry of any use
and can tell Woolly a few things. De-
tests ﬂoods and is working on a life pre-
server to rescue people like himself
from the females. His usual stunt is
telling Vogt about his old pals, Stiefel

and “Cap.” Once he was known to
speak to a female person, but never
again for Earl.

HOWARD CHARLES CARPENTER,
Bcllevue High School. Allegheny High School.

State College. Phi Zeta Phi.

Have you ever seen his note~book? A
work of art. Very sober man, but fails
to bluff Dr. Gibbs. V\/hen he gets on
that glad uniform (now discarded) he
looks like West Point. Carpenter re-
fuses to answer any questions until they
are forced out of him. A friend of Dr.
Dyess, who knows him well enough to
make him take the exams. He talks
with a peculiarly feminine inflection
through his nose.

AUSTIN LYNCH CORT,

(‘lairton High School, 1907. Class Football, ’0S.

It took three years to get Cort tamed
down to the present stage. Austin is an
enigma, a riddle, the Sphinx of the Uni-
versity. Studies epileptically, is serious
from three to ﬁve. Believes everything,
but thinks the world is a fake. VVhen
he starts to ask questions the best thing

GEORGE MEADE DOUGHERTY, Dravosburg.

Beaver College, 1907. Y. M. C. A. President, ’08. Inter-
('olle:2;iate Debate, ’08.

There is only one thing worse than
being a Methodist preacher and that
is being married. “Reverend” is the
big man with the mouse—colore~d
voice, who has such a demure and
angelic countenance. If you haven’t
seen him, you have heard him sneeze.
It sounds like the eruption of Mont
Pelee. He is very modest and always
busy, especially since last September.
Very modest and unassuming.

 

FRED CLARENCE GILLESPIE, Duquesne.

Duquesne High School, 1907. Owl Board. Classical Club.
Cosmopolitan Club.

This and Goldman are the two
“Archaic Twins.” His name is not
Canilius. Doc Ramsey conferred
that upon him in a ﬁt of insanity.
Has distinguished himself in litera-
ture, biologieal art and the search
for primeval Greek forms. Agita-
tor of the Gayety period and a
believer in the assassination of
femininity in general with one ex-
ception. Inventor of the Blue Book
and Gladsome Grin.

SAMUEL JAMES GLASS, North Side.

Carnegie High School. AA. Owl Board. Student Senate‘.
Science Club. Class Football, ’O7, ’08, ’09. Baseball, ’07,

The personiﬁcation of the “Don’t
Care” spirit. Inverts his expres-
sions, “Uniburg of Pittsversity.” A
minister’s son, but nobody would
think so; one of our most success-
ful bluffers. He lives in the Biol-
ogy department, but does not eat
there. Possesses an athletic laugh,
which he uses on all occasions.
Since his. election to the Senate,
dances too much.

 

MORRIS AARON GOLDMAN, Homestead.

Grcensburg Seminary, 1907. Classical Club. Cosmopoli-
tan Club. Class baseball, ’07, ’08, ’09.

Goldman! \/Vhenever you hear
that name you associate it with a
joke-. He is to become a vaudevill-
ian. Believes in the reincarnation
and vivisection of all biologists. His
purpose in life is to smoke cigarettes
and satirize society. He hides his
light under a bushel of nonsense.
Received a gold medal at the Paris
Exposition for rolling cigarettes with
both hands at once.

That spirit of bluff in you, Norman,
would take you anywhere. Firmly be-
lieves that the Juniors are barbarous.
Sings frequently and with a varying de-
gree of suffering to the listeners. His
voice is an excellent imitation of the
Highland Zoo. Fusses the ladies, but is
embarrassed in their presence. The only
man in the University who had the
nerve to hit the profs with a baseball.

 

JOHN ROCHAMBEAU HAUDENSHIELD,
Carnegie High School, 1906. Class Football, ‘07, ’08.

Carnegie.

Say that name with a long r—r-r-roll
and a benign aspect, for Napoleon in
all his glory never heard of such a man.
How noble he looked when he took pub-
lic speaking! He ‘has performed in
amateur theatricals and so is disquali-
ﬁed for the public stage. Speak gently
to him, he is yet untamed. Firmly be-
lieves that Goldman is a Hebrew. The
last of the avenging knights for faire
ladyes. Rumble on, mighty Jove!

\Ve adore thee, Ernest! (This from
Gillcspie—Ed.) When thy beatiﬁc physi-
ognomy appears on the ‘horizon, we

Allegheny High School. Y. M. C. A. Vice-Presirlent. ’09.

Wherever there is a religious
meeting you will be sure to ﬁnd
Charles. He is one of the corner-
stones of the Y. M. C. A. and is
known as the animated “Hymn-
Book.” Lander is six feet long and
four inches wide, but despite the ex-
treme hipless effect, he is not nar--

Riley is the quiet man with the

of a new bacterium. He draws left—
handed pictures of microcosms more
naturally than the original. R. Sa-
lathian can be identiﬁed by his
omnipresent suit—case an(1 his unique

VICTOR EDWARD MARLIER, MacDonald.
MacDonald High School, 1907. AA. Class Football, ‘07, ’08, ’09.

Of French descent (always going
down) and therefore is not made of
stone. Has held to the same swear-
word for three years. He enjoys life
mainly in trying to cake a pipe. “See,
fellows, she’s caking!” He is the de-
fendant in all cases against Kurz’s
restaurant. Quit smoking three times;
each time there was a girl in the case.
Adores the professors of the uni-

\Vedd, through constant associa-
tion with George Baird, has degen-
erated into a poor punstcr and the
utmost persuasion is unable to make
him disbelieve in his own superb
wit. He outrages public taste l)y
wearing a dress suit. Since he
starched his front hair two years
ago he looks like a rooster. In mu-
sical matters, he quotes himself as an
authority.

 

FLORENCE ANNA EATON, Beaver Falls.

McKinley Highischool (Chicago), 1906.

Florence Anna has one aim in life; to have her name in
the newspapers. She believes that every Co-ed should appear in
the Courant and that they should distribute their photographs.
Great admirer of the men and is personally acquainted ‘with
every fellow in the school. Educationally speaking, nothing is
dearer to her than a musty Greek verb. . -

Wooten talking like a bucketful of

Farmer is so much an athlete that
in fear of making him less studious,
the Faculty decreed that baseball and

Holds strange views on socialism,

His front name was given him in

Poland Seminary.

Before studying medicine Jesse
was a jockey of national reputa-
tion; this partially accounts for'his
large store of horse sense; small in
stature l)ut not in intellect or sym-
pathy; iirfact, he is so tender-
hearted that we are informed Jesse
will give his children chloroform

before whipping them

sers, and a good one, too. Bob is
away above the average from Mc-

friends call him “Rachel.” John is
trying to endeavor to attempt to

couraging him 'by not appearing
bored. Talk about your good times
on those Glee Club trips! ! Never
mind, when it comes to practical
chemistry, Coen is always among
those present.

JOHN WILLIAM CONNELLY, Pittsburgh.

Pittsburg Academy, 1905.
Phi Beta Pi.

Judge this man by his questions
rather than by his answers. John
is a regular interrogation mark,
and even if he does come from the
North Side, :1 better fellow is hard
to ﬁnd. With his curly hair, pleas-
ant personality and winning ways,
is it any wonder he is already
specializing on affections of the
heart?

late the hoe as skilfully as he can
the scalpel. Has quite a reputation
as a musician, dog fancier and
baseball player.

“In manners gentle, of affections
mild;
In wit a man, simplicity, a child.”

LEE WILLIAM DARRAH, Pittsburgh.

Oil City High School.
Courant Beard, ’09.

By common consent we yclept
him “sthakespeare.” The -old bard
would truly be delighted to know
this namesake. Emanations from
his witty cerebral cells appear
monthly in The Courant, and daily
on notes passed around the class.
During surgery exam. was heard
to exclaim, “A horse! a horse!
My kingdom for a horse!”

running mate, renders life miser-
able between hours. There is ab-
solutely no limit to the gymnastic
ability of ]im’s vocal cords. Set a
rapid pace for his class by winning
the Finklepearl Pharmacy prize in
the ﬁrst year. J. R. demands the
ocular proof every time.

plays unusual ability evading ques-
tions. He knows the luizury of do-

sistent with the man. “Dorothy”
bids fair to rival the great Osler.

Doctors will happen in the best
regulated families. Jean serves as
a balance wheel for brother Ed.——
together they live, move and have
their being. She is a student of the
first rank, of highest ideals, and
commands the respect of us all.
The mere fact that Jean is from
Ohio is sufficient guarantee of her
worth. Selah.

ALBERT J. ENDERLIN, Pittsburgh.
Allegheny High School, 1907.

Phi Beta Pi.

Well described by one word,
“Fuzz,” so nicknamed because of
his downy thought—(lome. An au~
thority on the track—both ponies
and trots; often gets there before
some of us slow road horses have
started. “And still the wonder
grew, how one small head could
carry all he knew.”

JAMES WALTER FER‘GUSON, Harrison City.

sky, shoots higher far than he who
means a tree.” Rivals Larimore
