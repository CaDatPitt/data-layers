Viewing the ‘‘hill'' from atop the Cathedral the camera's eye catches the sites from which

have and will come the minds and imaginations that have produced the city in the back-
ground. Though they are not all new buildings, they are as old friends who have given
freely of their wares.

New times demand new measures and new men;
The world advances, and in our time outgrows

The laws that in ourfathers day were best;

And, doubtless, after us, some purer scheme

Will be shaped out by wiser men than we.

J. P. LOWELL

" Leaving the responsibilities and duties of school life
§ behind them, )Ir. and l\Iiss Pitt will now look to the future
prepared to accept the challenges’ of an adult world.

An education, consisting of more than just book
learning, includes participation in some of the many or-
ganizations and clubs on the campus, fraternity and soror-
ity life, athletics, Tuck Shop meetings, dates, etc.

Also illustrating the attributes of a good leader is the
ability to possess a winning personality and make friends
easily.

When the graduates of Pitt leave the University, they
will take with them forever the many memories of college
life.

Representing these many activities, the Owl has

‘. ' chosen Teddi Arvanitis and Dick Deitrick.

Alumni

Greetings to the Graduates of 1954:

The officers and members of the General
Alumni Association of the University of Pitts-
burgh extend their heartiest congratulations and
best Wishes for success and accomplishment to
the graduates of 1954. As graduates of our great

Lawrence F. Greenberger

Association

As graduates, you will want to continue your
association with your fellow students and pro-
fessors, and membership in the General Alumni
Association facilitiates this process.

As graduates, you probably recognize that
many of the Worth while experiences you enjoyed
in school were made possible by a keen and active
interest of other graduates of Pitt—alumni who
felt a personal responsibility to give something
back to the institution which gave them the gift
of education. As graduates, you too will have the
opportunity to continue these privileges for
students who are to follow you, thereby extending
Pitt’s contribution to the community and to so-
ciety as a Whole. By active support of Alumni func-
tions, each graduate is enabled to contribute in
his own Way, year after year, to insure an even
greater success for the University in the world of
learning.

Your greatest sense of security, pride, and
satisfaction in the years to come will be derived
from the educational experiences you have lived
through during the years you have spent at Pitt.
Therefore, you owe it to yourself and your school
to share in the activities and objectives of your
Alumni Association. Visit our Alumni offices,
3632 Cathedral of Learning, and learn from the
General Alumni Secretary, J. Clyde Barton, how
you personally may take your rightful place in
alumni work and thereby continue your deep
interest and loyalty to your Alma Mater.

Sincerely yours,
LAWRENCE F. GREENBERGER
President, 1953-1954

Class cards are given to the students by a representative of
the department. One of the more fortunate students gets the
card she wants.

 
  
 
 
 

Lines are a common sight during registration. Students wait
to get their card sets which have to be ﬁlled out inevitably.

 

Pitt has long been lacking adequate facilities
along athletic lines. The remedy to this situation
has been the ﬁeld house. Containing a gymnas-
tics room, a wrestling room, spacious locker
rooms and locker room facilities, and one of the
most beautiful floors in college basketball, the
Pitt Memorial field house fast became the
center of student athletic activities at Pitt.

 

Now nearing completion, the Gateway Center
is approaching the goal that Pittsburgh has
set for herself. That goal being the advance of
the city to the pinnacle of industrial transactions
and beauty. The Buildings supply a tremen-
dous amount of office space, while the gateway
as a whole beautifies the Point area with their

silvery cleanness of line.

The School of Business Administration offers
not only a sound education in the accounting ﬁeld
of business but also offers ﬁne courses in merchan-
dising, insurance, and real estate. These courses
give to the student a wide scope covering all the
necessary qualiﬁcations for a business life that
will lead to a secure future. Also, the school for the
ﬁrst time this year has offered majors. This is a
long step in the direction of specialization, which
is in demand by ﬁrms and industries of today.
These specialized ﬁelds, some of which are; real
estate, ﬁnance, marketing, and insurance. These
ﬁelds which before had only been covered generally,
have now been treated with the detail deserved a
complicated affair such as they are.

The School of Business Administration hav-
ing shown itself to be progressive will not rest on
its laurels, but will continue forward as it has in
the past.

The balance sheet and P & L statements are familiar words to
all Business Administration students, for each one must take
at least one year of accounting.

Dean Lanfear, who efﬁciently guides the School of Business
Administration, is always glad to help the students with any
of their individual problems.

 

Progress cannot be denoted by physical
things alone. The Cathedral represents a great
part of what might be called unseen progress.
With the use of only their training and minds
the men of this university have built greater
things. Meaning, the minds of the students at
Pitt. For what greater ediﬁce has ever been
constructed for the good of mankind? No
building, however large or impressive, can
equal the human mind. And the training of
these minds is the most important iob that has
ever existed. It is the most vital part of the
progress at Pitt. This movement is always
advancing and has done so ever since

the inauguration of the university. Though in
this book we cannot take pictures of this
development, we can only tell you that it is
going on. And now the OWL staff presents to
you the 1954 OWL, this record of your year.

An unobtrusive, but nonetheless important part
of the University's expansion plan is the Cyclo-
tron Laboratory on Thackery near O'Hara
Street. Housing equipment and instruments for
advanced research in nuclear physics, the lab
works closely with the physics department in
the never-ending search for knowledge in the
atomic field. The lab was one of the first

buildings erected under Pitt's plan to increase

 

its capabilities for scientific research.

High atop the hill, near Pitt Stadium, one of the
country's newest and most modern hospitals
is being erected to house the thousands of war
veterans still undergoing treatment for battle
injuries. With present VA hospitals filled to
overﬂowing, the University tore down the Old
Trees Gym in order to make space available
for the government hospital which will increase
the services presently rendered by Aspinwall
and Deshon VA medical facilities.

Newly completed and costing $4,750,000,
one of the latest additions to the University's
rapidly growing Medical Center is this home for
resident nurses. The formal dedication of the
structure took place in April of l953 but due
to pressing needs, nurses were moved into the
building as fast as facilities were available,
and before the ﬁnishing touches had been
made to equip it for full-scale operations.

cept in education at Pitt, will consist of four
“cores”; communication skills, introduction to
humanities, social sciences, and physical sciences.
This plan, which will give a well rounded person-
ality grounded in fundamental ﬁelds. The Uni-
versity has brought this forward as a service to the
students of the College who will beneﬁt tremen-
dously from its ﬁne advantages. The College also
offers courses in its ﬁelds to students of all the
other schools. The College has striven, since its
founding in 1789, to give its students a desire for
knowledge and an instinct to feel a personal re-
sponsibility for the advancement of the cultural
welfare of his community be it university, city or
family.

College students can readily find available information in the
sixth ﬂoor College reference room for term papers when the
end of the semester draws to a close.

As head of the College, Dean Crawford spends many busy
hours solving the difﬁculties of his students.

In classes like elementary arts, education
students gain Valuable skill for instructing
their future students through practical ex-
perience.

Mr. Grubbs instructs some of the Business
Education students in the correct procedures
for high school teaching.

 

 

Boasting one of the largest enrollments in the
undergraduate schools at the University of Pitts-
burgh, the School of Education offers four spe-
cialized courses of study to the prospective teach-
er. After two years and 62 credits earned in the
College, students may apply for admission to
the school and pursue their degree in Secondary
Education, Physical Education, Elementary Edu-
cation or Business Education. During the ﬁrst
two years in the college, the education student
schedules English, geography, biology, history
and other related courses in the sciences and
general education. The student then continues
his studies in the school and at the same time
schedules observation classes in schools, prepares
lesson plans, and does student teaching. In gen-
eral, they do everything a teacher must do in
actual practice. ‘

During one semester of their senior year each Education stu-
dent conducts classes in one of the Pittsburgh schools, such as
this chemistry class at Schenley High School.

Samuel P. Franklin, Dean of Education, enjoys the interesting
work with the future teachers.

Panhellenic Choir, directed by Dottie Jacobs, is composed of two girls from each sorority. They sang

throughout the ceremony.

With its great, sweeping curves the Penn-Lincoln Parkway is one of the facts proving that
Pittsburgh is the city that is pulling itself up by its bootstraps. Speeding autos to and from
downtown, the Parkway is relieving some of the tremendous traffic pressures which con-

front our growing city. When it is completed the huge six-lane roadway will enable

thousands of office workers and students to get that extra halt-hour of sleep.

Dean Fitterer addresses the joint meeting of
all Engineering and Mines seminars, which
is held once each semester to present awards
to the outstanding senior of each division of
the school.

E. & M. students hurrying through the new
entrance to State Hall, their second home,
after a chilly tramp up the hill.

 
     

Facing the brightest future among all stu-
dents are the men of Engineering and Mines going
forth with a technical education which is Valuable
in any ﬁeld he chooses. Now the administration
of the university has brought forth the expansion
of the school. The new Engineering hall which is
well under construction will boost Pitt’s already
high engineering status. It will contain oﬂices,
classrooms, and in the basement will be the wind
tunnel, to be used by the aeronautical engineering
department for testing certain airfoil surfaces.
Along with all this progress in physical things,
teaching has kept right in stride. By keeping up
with the latest advances in engineering, the Engi-
neering and Mines faculty has been able to trans-
fer this knowledge to the student body.

Symbolic of the school is the engineering drawing lab.

Dean Fitterer has been pleased with the progress made in
the plans for the new E. & M. building, which is shown in the
architect's drawing in the background.

School of Dentistry

Many of Oakland’s residents, such as this little boy, receive

their dental care at the student clinic.

In maintaining its status as one of the ﬁnest
dental schools in the world, the University of
Pittsburgh scree11s hundreds of applicants every
year and selects only the 96 most capable of the
group to enroll in its school.

The objective of the school is to select those
students best qualiﬁed to becoII1e effective den-
tists, and to present a curriculum and training
program so that every graduate will be qualiﬁed
and competent to begin the practice of dentistry.

Students receive thorough training and dur-
ing the last two years he applies this training as
he begins working in the clinic.

1896 was the birth date of the Dental School
which was at that time called the Pittsburgh
Dental College. Since that time it has grown in
both size and improved techniques. The present
buildings house the most modern teaching appara-
tus and dental instruments available.

An interested patient looks on as one of the instructors ex-

plains how X-rays may be read.

The future dentists spend many hours in learning how to
make and ﬁt dental plates properly.

Dean Ruth Perkins Kuehn

University of Pittsburgh Nursing students took a
giant step last Spring as they moved into the new Nurses’
Residence. Faculty and students formed a closely bonded
group and the students themselves handled governmental
aﬂ"airs through the Residence Council, a group comprised
of representatives from all aﬂiliated groups.

As the preclinical period was completed, beginning
nursing students were honored at the “Capping cere-
mony.” Seniors were honored at the “Black Banding
Ceremony,” and ﬁnal recognition was given the graduating
students at the “Pinning Ceremony.”

The ability to serve as highly trained nurses and a
sense of positive security were just two of the rewards
which the students received at the end of their ﬁve-year
training program. They entered their profession, secure in
the knowledge that they had received training which
stands second to none in their ﬁeld.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The new Nurses’ Residence provides a wonderful place for the
students to relax together in a home like atmosphere.

Pitt’s School of Pharmacy, now in its seventy-sixth
year, offers much to its students. The Pharmacy School
is located off the main campus, and as a result, many stu-
dent activities have developed there, either to augment or
replace other campus organizations.

The student branch of the American Pharmaceutical
Association serves to keep the students in close contact
with the day-to-day happenings of their profession. Pro1n-
inent visiting speakers round out the activities of this
group.

Student affairs are handled by the Pharmacy Stu-
dent Council, the active governing body of the school.

The five professional and honorary fraternities have
banded together to form the Pharmacy Inter-Fraternity
Council, for the purpose of liaison between fraternal
groups.

In addition, students of the upper two classes have
the opportunity of visiting manufacturing plants in other
states as well as local pharmacy wholesalers.

The combination of work, play, travel, and study
makes for full preparation of pharmacy graduates who
are equipped to take their places in the ranks of the
Health Professions.

On Warm spring afternoons “Pittites” spend hours between The Commons Room is a popular place to meet and talk after
classes enjoying the University’s outdoor campus. classes.

Regardless of which school in the University students are en-
rolled, they can find an unlimited source of material in the
libraries.

Undergraduates and underdogs! Such might be the
case in certain colleges and universities but not at Pitt. It
is also frequently the custom to plan a yearbook with total
emphasis on graduating seniors.

But at Pitt emphasis is placed on the entire student
body which makes Pitt the internationally known Uni-
versity that it has come to be. Emerson had a phrase for it.
“Our knowledge is the amassed thought and experience
of innumerable minds.”

Undergraduate students become an integral part of
the university when they enter their ﬁrst class and remain
a part of Pitt for the rest of their lives. Opportunities for
participation in government, publications and all phases of
student activity are virtually unlimited to all students,
be they freshmen or seniors.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  

An industrious student can often use the study tables in the
Commons Room to work on his next assignment.

SCHOOL OF
RETAILING

Professor Sobotka explains fabric construction to a group of
textiles students.

Advertising managers, buyers, controllers,
employment directors—these are the positions
for which men and women train at Pitt’s School of
Retailing. The year of graduate study is one of
concentration on the ﬁeld of retailing as projected
from the points of view of many and varied type
stores and from the teachings of professors who
themselves have retail experience.

The School of retailing has prepared graduate
students for careers in retailing for 36 years and
from a class of few students has grown to classes
of up to one hundred students. Undoubtedly, most
of this growth is due to the soundness of the pro-
gram. However, Pittsburgh itself is an attraction
to students of retailing since Pittsburgh is “The

partment store volume than any other city Of Students of the School in their own retailing library.

ease the way for students who will hold retailing

positions of their own in less time than a year.

Students of the School of Retailing have the

added advantage of being paid for the time they
work in the stores during the school year.

The School of Retailing confers the Master
of Retailing Degree upon those who meet the re-
quirements of the School. The degree is conferred,
not on the sole basis of grades earned, but also is
based upon individual performance which indi-
cates the applicant as good or poor executive

Albert B. Smith, Acting Dean, School of Retailing.

 

The School of Retailing is located on the 19th
and 20th ﬂoors of the Cathedral of Learning. From
especially designed classrooms to the housing of
the world’s largest library devoted to retailing
subjects, the ﬂoors have been planned for effective
and efficient training of future retail executives.
The faculty and administrative offices and the
student lounge are also on these ﬂoors.

Acting as dean is Professor Albert B. Smith
who has been associated with the school since
1938 in teaching and administrative capacities.
Professor Smith has inspired hundreds of youthful
retailers with his own enthusiasm and example of
leadershipvvwith his sympathetic understanding,
capable direction and guidance.

The goals of the A.I.E.E. Seminar are: to
encourage young electrical engineers to keep the
students in close contact with the practicing
ﬁeld, and to keep the A.I.E.E.’s abreast of the
latest developments.

In 1915, ﬁve seniors, representing the Elec-
trical Engineering Department, attended the
ﬁrst seminar of A.I.E.E. Since that time the semi-
nar has grown steadily into one of the most ac-
tive seminars. The student representation in the
chapter is forty times as great as that of the be-
ginning class, that is, that the enrollment is now
almost two hundred. That ﬁgure includes all the
juniors and seniors in the Electrical Engineers
in the school.

On fourth hour each Thursday all EE’s
move toward their designated classroom, by doing
so being granted one-half credit toward gradua-
tion. At these meetings, which all engineers greatly
enjoy, movies on some particular subject in elec-
trical engineering or speakers who are closely re-
lated to electrical engineering in industry put
forth the latest developments in electrical engi-
neering.

Actually the American Institute of Industrial
Engineers is a combination of two organizationsw
the l\Iechanical engineers and the institute of
industrial engineers. Merged as one, the organiza-
tion has two purposes: to keep the members in-
formed on the advances in the engineering ﬁeld
and to help the students get the feel of the in-
dustry. The A.I.I.E. celebrates its birthday
simultaneously with the school of industrial engi-
neering here at Pitt.

Relaxing at various smokers where everything
from football to industry is discussed is a favorite
pastime of the engineers. In the spring semester,
seminar members all attend the annual senior
banquet. Later the same month, the members and
their dates sponsor a picnic party for the associa-
tion. Finishing their social season in grand engi-
neering style, the men, in conjunction with the
Engineering and Mines Association, plan the

held. The supervisory teachers were able to give
the girls ﬁrst-hand advice on the subject.

where the girls obtained material for their student
teaching. An educational T.V. program and panel
discussion for radio were planned.

the visits of professional speakers from the various
ﬁelds of business, helped ﬁll up the busy schedule
that its officers plan. A special project given to
them by their Nation Headquarters, pertaining

Progress is an important word to everyone,
especially the members of Alpha Tau Delta who
are vitally interested in the progress of medicine
and nursing.

Pitt’s chapter of Alpha Tau Delta was found-
ed eight years ago to foster friendship among Pitt’s
nursing students. In those eight years the chapter
has come to mean much to many Pitt nursing
students.

The main social affairs of the ATD’s are two
formals, one in December and one in April. At
Christmas time the girls get together for a worthy
Christmas project.

Their meetings feature prominent speakers
who stimulate discussions on the ﬁeld of nursing.
Last year, Pitt’s chapter was honored by a visit
from Miss Miriam Furlong, the national president.

and tours through the diﬂt'erent plants in the dis-
trict.

The members are men and women that are
interested in chemistry. The student chemists
originate and read their papers before the other
members at their meetings. In this way, new
ideas and theories are discussed. Again this year
the members have edited the A.C.S. newspaper.
This is the third year that the members have
undertaken this project.

As the year progresses new members are
recruited in order to carry out their reorganization
plan. The student society has worked hard to pro-
mote the aims of the parent organization. The

chemistry.

in the ﬁnal elimination, winning the league
championship in two of those years. The Civil

A most efﬁcient organization in the daily
lives of the Pitt engineers is the Engineering and
Mines Association. Two members from each
engineer seminar and the freshman and sopho-
more classes make up the E&M Cabinet and the
heart of the organization. They form the govern-
ing body for the men “on the hill” and try to
make things a little easier for the students who
spend so much of their time in the engineering
buildings.

Candy and coke machines andawell-furnished
lounge in State Hall provided a special Tuck Shop
for the engineers and the social calendar lists
everything from smokers and bowling parties to
special scientiﬁc exhibits and the annual E&M
Ball. A less publicized but equally important aim
of the association is the promotion of closer re-
lations between students and their faculty.

“I Wonder if you can stop a panther with this.”

The outstanding pre-legal society on campus
is John Marshall. This year it is led by Tom
Rutter. The society is sure to forge ahead once
more with its purpose of giving assistance and
guidance to all pre-legal students. This assistance
and guidance is given so that the student can
adjust himself to the law school curriculum. The
events of the year were brought to a close with
the annual dinner in the spring.

The society wishes to help anyone whom they
think will work intelligently and is able to cope
with the diﬂicult problems that will face him in
the future at law school. Long noted for the out-
standing law students that come from its ranks,
the John Marshall society again this year has
produced the finer law students to be sent to
law school here and at other colleges.

Since 1926 Kappa Phi Kappa, national
honorary education fraternity for men, has been
active on Pitt’s Campus. The ﬁrst chapter Alpha,
was founded in 1922 at Dartmouth College. Since
then, the fraternity has expanded until there are
now ﬁfty—three chapters throughout the country.
Social activities, scholastic attainment, profession-
al ideals are the goals toward which Kappa Phi
Kappa Works.

Under the guidance of l\1r. George W. Hoff-
man, Tau Chapter has enjoyed an active year.
There was the annual fall smoker and the initiation
in December at a formal banquet. The chapter
also held a Spring initiation this year and a success-
ful picnic at North Park. Charles McNutt served
as Tau Chapter president during the 1953-54
school year.

The aim of Kappa Psi, Pharmaceutical Fra-
ternity at the University of Pittsburgh, is to fur-
ther professional relationships and endeavors in
the ﬁeld of Pharmacy. Kappa Psi was founded in
1879 and since then professional advancement
has been their goal. In 1913 Beta Kappa Chapter
became active at Pitt and today it joins thirty-
four collegiate chapters in advancing profession-
alism and fraternalism, making Kappa Psi one of
the largest professional fraternities in the United
States.

Various informal and formal affairs, plus an
active pledging period comprised the social
calendar for the chapter this year. The Alvin J.
Vavro Award was made to an outstanding sopho-
more of the School of Pharmacy.

Happy people make good social Workers.

The Pre-Social Work Club at Pitt offers
interested students in the ﬁeld a chance to gain a
better understanding of social work as a profes-
sion. A pre-professional organization, the club
attempts to stimulate interest in the ﬁeld by
sponsoring discussions with faculty members,
local agency staff members and visiting national
leaders.

Lois M. James, chairman of the club, and
Dr. Merrill B. Conover, the advisor for the group
have tried to set up a program for the many stu-
dents who are interested in that type of work but
do not plan to pursue social work as a career.

Social activities of the organization included
dances, picnics in local parks, and what Lois terms
“just plain get-togethers.”

“Let’s go down to the Tuck Shop and discuss it some more.”

An outstanding pre-med honorary for out-
standing pre-med students would describe Alpha
Epsilon Delta. When a student is admitted, then
will he see the kind of an organization it really is.
He will then see the type and quality of service
it offers him, then and only then will he ﬁnd the
experience that will result from the trips to the
various state owned institutions or the informa-
tion that he will get from the booklet published
by Alpha Epsilon Delta or the entertainment and
information he will gain from the movies and
speakers from the ﬁeld of medicine brought in by
AED. Of course the honorary isn’t entirely‘ the
study of medicine, there are the social get-to-
gethers and the spring picnic. All this serves to
round the student’s personality so that he will
be better prepared for his career in medicine.

After the first bustle of the Tuck Shop in
September wore off, the ADPi’s were busy with
tea dances, hayrides, and the annual Black and
White formal in December.

Not just thinking of themselves, the girls
entertained a group of orphans from a local
children’s home at a Christmas party. Fascinating
gifts, Santa Claus, and movies provided a de-
lightful afternoon for the children and the sorority
girls. The boys and girls were reluctant to leave
the pretty girls on Bigelow Blvd. and we can
readily understand Why.

Besides the ﬁne sorority spirit shown by the
ADPi’s this year, there was also evidence of their
school spirit on campus. Louise Tibero was on
the Transfer Committee and Jody Mcllvain an
active Cwen. Ann Burns, president of the sorority,
was one of the ﬁve ﬁnalists for the Spring Carni-
Val 1952-53.

A. E. Phi is on the move, literally and ﬁgura-

year by moving into their new sorority apartment
at 214 South Craig Street. The old members,
along with their two new transfer sisters, spent
the week prior to school by moving furniture,
painting, hanging drapes, and turning the apart-
ment into a new and beautiful home under the
leadership of Rita Gordon, the new president.

When the moving was ﬁnished, the girls
settled down to a new year of scholarship, social
events, and school. Estelle Adler moved back into

Hart Rubin returned to the vice—presidency of

North Park, complete with cider, doughnuts,
hot dogs, blue jeans, plaid shirts, and square

with their dates for the ﬁrst time of the year.

Besides having brains and “book learning,”

be called “Activities Night.”

December was a big month for the Beta

this year but along about Christmas time the
orphans of St. Peter’s Home receive the “ﬁxing”

Then, too, the girls pause from their nailing

but there’s no stopping the determined Chi O’s
from making their house one of the most outstand-

Jean Hill is the ﬁrst president to bang the

are conﬁned to just talking with ﬁve Chi O’s
members of Heinz Chapel Choir.

Chi O’s like Barbara Rupp, vice president
of Cwens, Marie Carr, Student Congress member
and Bobbie Douglas, Chairman of the Transfer
Committee, have to carefully divide their time
between school activities and the new house.

VVhen the Spring Festival Awards were an-
nounced last year the Tri-Delt’s had plenty to
shout about. Besides having the best Festival
show and taking third place honors with their
eye-catching show front, the hard-working Tri-
Delt’s snagged the ﬁrst place award in the Float
Parade. And as if the Tri-Delt house wasn’t full
of cups already, they added another to their col-
lection when they placed second in the I. F. Pan-
hellenic Sing.

But winning honors as a group is easy when
there are so many active individuals on campus.
This year Dotty Jacobs is serving as prexy of

a Parents’ Tea and a Variety Night for the enter-
tainment of their alums, parents and Carnegie

attended by a large group of all-students and fa-

During the year Phi Delta Theta makes its
mark all over the university campus. In the
spring everyone sees some ingenious ﬂoat concoct-
ed for the carnival, and in the fall the White Car-
nation dance during rushing is quite a high spot
on the social calendar. But the men of this highly
rated fraternity are more than socially conscious.

At Christmas time they held a party for
the orphans; and in the brains department, too,
we ﬁnd that Dick Deitrick is not only O.D.K. but
also treasurer of student congress, and president Jim Trebac isn.t quite Sure M3 the right aeria1_
of the Senior class. Phi Delta Theta also helps
keep the name of the university up there in the
sports light . . . there’s Ray Ferguson on the foot-
ball team and Bob Kennedy on the gymnastic
team as well as the football squad.

These boys are literally in the social swim.

Phi Gamma Delta can well be called the fra-

fall formal held at the Churchill Valley Country
Club was far from unlucky even though it was
held on a Friday ‘13th’.

It seems as though it’s almost a dancing year
with the spring formal and all the house parties
that go on. But like most of the Pitt fraternities,
this one has a more serious side, too.

At Christmas time, the orphans are hosted
at a gala party and treated to ice cream and cakes
and even surprise presents are delivered by a.
fraternity man disguised as Santa Claus.

Then in helping to cement a friendly and
warm feeling between faculty and students, Phi
Gamma Delta annually holds a faculty reception.

“Phi Kappa is a social fraternity of Catholic
students chartered to promote social and intellec-
tual programs among its members; to identify
student and alumni more closely with their col-
lege and to cultivate a spirit of loyalty to their
Alma l\Iater.” There is no doubt that as a social
group, Phi Kappa has its share of fun, but it is
clearly seen from their own statement of purpose
that parties are not the only aim of this organiza-
tion. They take part in the canned food drive,
and hold an annual party for the orphans. And
in addition to this interest in their community,
they are always trying to make improvements
concerning themselves—a parking lot project
with reconditioning, enlarging and resurfacing
is being carried on and, their house is undergoing a
face lifting job with sandblasting and re-painting.
VVith proof such as this, it is correct to say that
Phi Kappa is unquestionably an alert and active
fraternity.

The Chi Omicron chapter of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon at Pitt can rightfully be proud of their
alumni. The Alumni chapter was very active in
giving the boys a “helping hand.”

SAE, one of the oldest collegiate fraternities
in the United States was founded nationally at
the University of Alabama in 1856. The fraternity
now boasts one of the largest memberships of any
national fraternity.

The 1953-54 school year was full of fun and
fellowships for SAE’s. There were “brunches” be-
fore the football games, the Harvest dance in
November, the annual Sweetheart dance, the
South Sea dress-up party in December and the
spring formal.

A new project this year was the publication
of a booklet that listed all the living alumni of the
Pitt Chapter.

Outstanding members like Tom Piemme,
president of l\Ien’s Council and editor of Pitt
Compass; Bill Dickenson, editor of I.F. Hand-
book, and Richard Ritter, freshman orientation
chairman represented the fraternity on the campus

United with common belief that a college stu-
dent can best equip himself for life by development
of honor, loyalty, and friendship, the organization
is constantly striving toward these ideals.

pride than this introduction for it ushers in a
university musical aggregation which is second

And yet, the students which comprise this
group are anything but professional musicians.
They will some day take their places in the
ﬁelds of law, medicine, engineering, and
business, but this year they have taken their
places on the drill ﬁeld as one of the outstanding
marching bands in the country.

Of course, where a group of this size is
concerned, there must be men who manage,
who plan, and just plain work. These men
constantly came up with new formations and
drills which, incidentally, the band executed
at a cadence of 180 steps per minute.
Practice sessions all week long prepare

these men for appearances at football games,
reviews, and pep rallies. The Stadium Review
in December is just one of the many high
points in an eventful year. Oh yes! the band

Once a week the girls of Sigma Sigma Sigma
sorority entertain the children from Juvenile
Court. Naming this as their biggest project of
the school term, the girls read stories, played
games, and had parties for the boys and girls.

VVith a meaningful motto of “doing for
others” the girls proved their loyalty each year
to youth by contributing to the Robbie Page
Memorial Fund for polio research. They also
joined with a fraternity at Christmas to entertain
St. Paul’s Orphanage children with Santa Claus,
presents, and good things to eat.

Activities were always humming at the Tri
Sig’s apartment this past year. Jackie was always
sighing over her private room at the new nurses’
home, Pat Halvorsen was either bragging about
her mentor group or talking about the problems
of Senior Court members, Rosaline Babinski was

of time to campus activities: Druids, Varsity
Marching Band, Glee Club, and Heinz Chapel
Choir, as well as publications and student govern-
ment beneﬁted from their participation.

The fraternity social calendar was a very
busy one too. They crowned their sweetheart at
their annual winter formal in December and in
April they presented their colorful Red Carnation
Dance. The Theta Chi’s also held two rousing
stag parties beside a smoker for their Alums, and
sprinkled throughout the year were numerous
house parties that no Theta Chi will forget.

The Theta Chi’s also have a love for the
orphans of Pittsburgh, when at Christmas time
they drop everything and provide a joyous Christ-

What a wonderful time the Zetas must have
had planning their ’53—’54 calendar! And how
anxious they must have been to start it!

The social conscious girls of ZTA began the
year with a tea for Alumnae and chose to wind
it up with a swimming party. In between were
tea dances, Christmas and spring formals, a
Barn Dance and the annual Mother-Daughter
Banquet.

But the ZTA’s didn’t forget their favorite
charity, the Cerebral Palsy Fund. Each member
pledged money towards the treating and training

of palsied children. And the girls are especially
proud of their Scholarship Loan Fund open to
any girl in Pitt.

The Zetas have had special cause to congratu-
late some of their sisters this year. Rose Scarpi-

Alpha Phi Alpha is a fraternity with a pur-
pose, known as one of the more thoughtful fra-
ternal groups on campus. As one of their projects
which they hope will continue through the history
of the chapter is the scholarship fund. This fund
set up by the fraternity itself is parceled out to a
deserving undergraduate each year.

At their rushing events this year the Alphas
showed prizeﬁght ﬁlms with Joe Louis as the
main contestant, and after the movies they had
their usual, or it should be said their unusual
chicken dinner. The way those boys can devour a
half a fried chicken is the talk of the campus.
Everyone in the house said that this has been
one of the most satisfying years that Alpha Phi
Alpha has had throughout their years on campus.

During the Spring semester, Delta Sigma
Theta sponsored two affairs to replenish their
scholarship fund. The first was called “Jabber-

chapters of the sorority. The second was a card

Nineteen ﬁfty-three was a memorable year
for Phi Epsilon Pi, for Zeta chapter passed its
forty-year mark on the Pitt campus. And in this
anniversary year, as in the past, Phi Ep once
again proved that it is one of the outstanding
fraternities at Pitt. The official celebration was
held over the weekend of November 21st, with
a house affair given by the present members and
an Alumni dinner dance held on the following
night.

The anniversary affair, however, was only
one of many exciting parties. Last fall there was
a costume party for Halloween, and a few weeks
later, a combined barn dance and hay ride. A little
later in the year, Phi Ep held a winter formal and
a Valentine Dance. Toward the end of school
was the picnic in North Park, the Flapper affair,
and the beautiful summer formal at which the
graduating members received their senior keys, The Phi Ep’s give vent to some very unusual cheers.

December the eighteenth is a date which

having a party at their house before the dance.
Here they exchanged presents and met each

Although they participate in the customary
round of house parties, barn dances, and tea
dances, the Founders’ Day Banquet is their big-
gest event. On this day the actives, pledges, and
Alumni all enjoy a wonderful evening at the Villa
Catalina. The banquet is always held at this fa-

Pitt’s 1953 football edition seemed to have
been caught in the shuﬂie resulting from the switch
to single platoon play. But whatever the reason,
the season ended on as dismal a note as it began,
and the Panthers held a meager 3-5-1 chart to
show for their efforts.

After an unexpectedly strong showing the
year before, when they defeated Notre Dame,
Army, and three Big Ten schools in their 6-3 rec-
ord, the Panthers ranked high among Eastern grid
powers. Some experts rated Pitt number one in the

East in the pre-season roundups; local observers
already had spots picked in the post-season bowl
games.

But along came the rigors of conversion to
the single platoon system to spoil the well-laid
plans of Coach Lowell “Red”Dawson in his second
term at the helm. As was the case all over the
collegiate world, erstwhile specialists had to learn
to handle new jobs, and many ﬁrst—stringers were
found lacking in all-around ability.

It was evident at the very start of
the season that Red Dawson’s forces had
trouble adjusting themselves. More than
42,000 fans watched rival West Virginia
push the locals to a savory 17-7 victory
around the Stadium turf in the opening
game.

Some of the disappointment abated
the following Saturday, however, when
the underdog Blue-and-Gold managed to
hold powerful Oklahoma to a '7-7 tie, in a
game that either team might easily have
Won. Little did the Stadium followers sus~
pect that Oklahoma was to defeat the
nation’s number one team, Maryland, in
the Orange Bowl three months later.

Meanwhile, the halfback situation
was disturbing Dawson. In these two
games and in the three which followed,
the Redhead started ﬁve men at left half
—Chet Rice, Bill Hoffman, Ray DiPas-
quale, John Jacobs, and Dick Manson-
before deciding upon Manson as his
choice.

In the third game, Nebraska fell vic-
tim to the Panthers, 14-6, although the
latter looked far from impressive in their
ﬁrst win. By this time Henry Ford had
established himself as the ﬁrst string
quarterback, after getting the nod over
Hoffman, Neft, and Mattioli. Ford’s su-
perb defensive play at safety won him the
job.

“The play’s the thing.” Shakespeare said it
and the Pitt Players proved it not once, but four
times this year. “Androcles and the Lion” was
the opener for the season followed by “The l\Iale

of the season was a play on British politics and
aristocracy entitled “Yes Nfy-Lord.”

In an effort to make students more aware of
the Pitt drama group and the beneﬁts which may
be derived from it, the players this year initiated
a new plan whereby the various service and hon-
orary groups on campus were invited to preview
showings of the plays. These groups included
such organizations as the Pitt News, Alpha Phi

Pitt took to the road the following
week for the “big one” with Notre Dame
as the ﬁrst stop on a four-game trip. The
Panthers had pulled one of their biggest
upsets in years the season before, and all
things pointed to a rousing battle with
the reVenge—minded Irish. And it really
was a battle—for the ﬁrst half, at least.
The Visitors stunned the capacity crowd
when they scored the ﬁrst time they got
their hands on the ball, and left the ﬁeld
at halftime with a 14-7 lead. The tide
turned sharply, however, in the third
quarter following a safety in the Pitt end
zone, and the Leahymen used their re-
serve power to grind the Panthers right
out of the ball game.

The 23-14 loss at South Bend seemed to take
the starch out of the locals, for they dropped the
next two contests to Northwestern and Minne-
sota. So far the Oaklanders most obvious deﬁ-
ciency lay in their passing attack, so much so that
the opposition seemed to be setting up their de-
fenses strictly against the running of Bobby Epps,
the leading ground-gainer who turned in magniﬁ-

It was not until the Panthers invaded Vir-
ginia that they snapped out of their tailspin, when
they easily trampled the Cavaliers, 26-0. For the
first time Dawson was able to give some of his
reserves a chance to crack the lineup. The easy
victory proved costly for Eldred Kraemer, star
tackle, suffered a shoulder separation which put
him out for the season. This made the line situa-
tion critical, for guards Ed Stowe and Rudy Grun-
der already had been put out of action. The for-
ward wall had been weakened at the start when
tackle Lou Palatella broke a leg and had to sit
out the entire campaign. Dick Gatz, Bill Schmitt,
and Bill Cessar ﬁlled in at his spot, and Howard
Linn took over Kraemer’s vacancy.

Fortunately, Dawson had enough suitable
guards to relieve any pressure at that spot—Joe
Los, Harold Hunter, Bob Kennedy, and John
Cenci pulling reserve duty. ‘

Despite recurrent injuries, Captain Dick Dei-
trick continued to stand out at end, along with
Joe Zombek, Jack Paluck, Bob McQuaide, and
Fred Glatz. Bill Adams had been lost earlier with
a leg injury. The center position, too, was deep in
top—ﬂight performers——Ed Bose, Ed Johnson, Bob
Ballock, and Gary LeDonne.

The squad returned from its travels after the
Virginia game and proceeded to humble a hapless
Wolfpack from North Carolina State, 40-6. The
victory unveiled a new star in Bob Grier, a sub
fullback playing behind Epps and Joe Capp. Grier
gained 298 yards—two short of the Pitt record—
in a stunning display of speed and power that aft-
ernoon. Halfback Don Michaels, who had been
playing behind Gene Steratore also broke into the
lineup as a regular.

At this point, the won-lost record read 3-4-1
and the Blue-and-Gold had one last chance to
even up the chart for the season. A Dawson-
coached team had never before compiled a losing
record, and only Penn State loomed as a possible
spoiler in the ﬁnale at the stadium.

Pitt fans were doomed to disappointment,
however, as the Panthers suffered their only
Whitewash of the season, 17-0. Aside from more
ﬁne running by Grier, the Panthers could do little
in the way of offense against the towering State
line and fell before the sharp passing of Tony Ra-
dos and the deadly running of Lenny Moore.

The game marked the ﬁnal appearances of
seven seniors—Deitrick, Epps, Zombek, Capp,
Ferguson, Adams, and Ken Voytell.

Deitrick, a pre-med student, gained the
distinction of being named to the C0llier’s All-
East team and later played in the annual Blue-
Gray game after the season.

One individual school record fell during the
season. Linebacker Paul Blanda erased Nick Bol-
koVac’s old placekicking record of 44. Blanda has
another year to add to the mark.

   

Neither Pitt nor Penn State was able to get this one.

Under a new coach for the ﬁrst time in 31
years, Bob Timmons, the 1953-54 Panther bas-
ketball team started slow but ended in a ﬂurry to
ﬁnish with a 9-14 record.

Timmons succeeded Dr. H. C. “Doc” Carl-
son after the good doctor decided to retire and
formed the Panthers into a much more formidable
team than most observers thought could be ob-
tained.

As was expected, the team dropped their

In the ﬁrst night’s contests, Duquesne elimi-
nated Wlake Forest and the Panthers surprised
Bradley in a stunning upset, 66-64, as Captain
Dutch Burch sank a last minute ﬁeld goal. The
Dukes, however, took the sting out the next eve-
ning as they whipped Pitt 79-43 to win the tourna-
mcnt.

After this brief ﬂurry, the Panthers Went into

straight through the Christmas vacation until
January 13. Carnegie Tech then came along to
put the hoopsters back on the right. side of the
ledger as the Blue and Gold broke their skein with
a 69-58 Victory at the Field House.

Following this up with a triumph over VVest
Virginia at the l\Iountaineer court, local fans took
heart that things were to look better.

After this initial attempt to continue winning
was stopped by Westminster, the Pitts lost a
close three-overtime 91-85 game to Penn State at
State College. A mid-semester road trip brought
back two more conquests, however, as Columbia
and Georgetown fell.

In the_neXt encounter at Annapolis against
Navy, Pitt found the record book being slapped
in their faces as the l\Iiddies rang up the highest
score ever for Panther opponents, 108 points, as
they swept to a 108-73 margin.

“I do not fear this lion, yet the strain of his presence is con-

The men behind the scenes play an indis-
pensible role along with the actors on stage. Thea-
ter technicians, the production staff and the ad-
ministrators all function along with the actors to
make a solid, well knit organization.

Just as the hero gets his reward at the end of
the play, so do the Pitt Players get their rewards
at the end of the year when their annual banquet
is held.

Students who have rendered outstanding
service are awarded keys while others are granted
active membership in the organization. “The-
atron,” undergraduate dramatics honorary, gives
two awards at this time. One for the outstanding
actor and one for the person who achieved most in

the technical ﬁeld.

first time the Panthers have beaten their arch
rivals twice in one season since 1944.

Pitt concluded the campaign by whipping
Tech again and Geneva in a return engagement at
the Field House. Burch ended as the top point
producer with 363 tallies for a 15.8 average. Pav-
lick was second, Fenwick third, Artman fourth,

obscurity to national prominence—all in the short
span of ﬁve years—by winning the Eastern Col- K015’ applying half 11615011: trying for 3»fa11-
legiate Championship and placing second in the
NCAA Tournament in 1954.

Hugh Peery, the coach’s son, ran his unde-
feated streak to 4:8 matchesihe lost but one in
college competition. He also equalled the mark of
the elder Peery by winning his NCAA division
for the third time. Joe Solomon won the 167-pound
title.

This was the ﬁrst season as a member of the
Eastern Intercollegiate Wirestling Association
for the local matmen, and they promptly displaced
Penn State as the champion, besides beating the

Pitt’s varsity swimming team completed a
winning dual meet season with their third straight
championship in the Eastern Collegiate Swim-
ming Association meet.

After copping dual Victories over Ohio Uni-
versity, Duke, West Virginia, Syracuse, Miami
of Ohio, and Lehigh, the mermen grabbed 94
points in the ECSA to carry home the James H.
Reilly trophy for good.

Captain Ronnie Gainsford led the Panthers
as he was undefeated in dual competition and won
both the 100 and 200 yard breast strokes in the
title match.

Freddie O’nions and Jim Zurcher also con-
tributed highly to the Panthers’ success and both
ended up with new ECSA records in the individual
medley and 440-yard free style, respectively.

Soccer arrived at Pitt in 1953, as the newly-
formed team played its ﬁrst inter-collegiate
matches with district schools. The team did not
fare so well in the scoring, however, as seven games
failed to produce a single victory, although the
booters managed to tie Indiana Teachers in their
opening game, 2-2.

Signs of improvement appeared in the second
contest although not indicated in the score when
Grove City won, 5-0. VVith the development of a
better passing attack, the team made good show-
ings in losses to Allegheny, 5-3; Denison, 6-3; and
Slippery Rock, 4-0.

Frostburg tacked on the ﬁfth loss, 3-1, be-
fore Pitt made its ﬁrst home appearance. Pitt put

For the ﬁrst time in its history, Pitt ﬁelded a Gymnas-
tic team this year and took on a full intercollegiate sched-
ule including such teams as Army, West Virginia, Ohio
State and Illinois.

The “men on the ﬂying trapeze” put up a good show-
ing in spite of the fact that some of them had never com-
peted in gym events before and although competent, were
inexperienced.

Coach Warren Neiger had his boys competing on the
parallel bars, horizontal bars, ﬂying rings, sidehorse, rope
climb, and tumbling (not to be confused with tripping
over one’s foot).

The gymnasts took to the road twice in their ﬁrst
year of competition but came home with losses to both
West Virginia and Ohio State. VVith a few more perform-
ers and a little experience under their belts the boys in
tights should attract some attention next year.

League.

Only West Virginia has been the obstacle in
keeping the Panther sharpshooters from the title
in the loop’s three-year history.

The Mountaineers were the only riﬂers to
beat Pitt in the past season. The local squad,
however, posted Victories over all the other mem-
bers of the league, besides topping an outside
rival, Ohio State.

Top men for the Panthers were Tom Shepard,
Dave Jacobson, Bob Stanger, Jim Cleary, Bell _
Kelly, Al Johnson, and Dick Greene. Shepard is Tom Shepard’ Captain

Intramural activities covered a ﬁeld of
twenty different sports as increased facilities and
broader programs allowed more students to par-
ticipate in both team and individual events.

Pitt retained the city Il\I crown in football
as Phi Delta Theta beat Duquesne’s champion,
26-20. The Dukes had previously defeated Tech
and the Phi Delts had won the Pitt title by elimi-
nating the Collegians, Independent League win-
ners.

Titlists in the all-campus Wrestling tourna-
ment also went on to further honors by whipping
Tech’s best grapplers, 17-13.

Basketball got a late start in 1954 under a
new setup~hoop play did not start until the sec-
ond semester, whereas it formerly began in early
winter, thus enabling the Field House to be used.
A total of 43 teams entered in the Various leagues

The V\'omen’s Recreation Association which offers
the women of the University a chance for real fellowship is
one of the most popular campus organizations among the
girls. Any woman student may become a member and by
doing so will gain many social beneﬁts. These include par-
ticipation in athletic games, “cook-outs,” and “Fun and
Frolic Nights” which are held in the Cathedral Gym.
Through active participation in VVRA the students have
an opportunity for relaxation and development of their
sports ability.

Sports contests with area schools have been a signiﬁ-
cant part of this year’s program. Some of these events
were basketball games with Tech, swimming meets and
general play days. The friendly competition of these events
has fostered a strong bond of cooperation between the
women’s athletic departments of the participating schools.

Coach Carl Olson’s cross-country team not
only_posted an undefeated record for 1953, but
shut out seven of their eight victirns with “blan-
ket” ﬁnishes. Thus the harriers proved to be the
winningest Varsity group in Pitt athletics.

Led by VValt Starz, Allen Gunderson, Don
I)elliGatti, and Bob Cherry, who usually made up
the blanket, in which four or more runners ﬁnish
before a. single opponent breaks the tape, the
harriers also copped second place in the annual
IC4A championships in New York. l\Iichigan
State edged past by only two points with 86.

Other consistent winners for the “Blue-and-
Gold” were Dan Sommer, Pete Kress, and Ron
Sallade. As Olsen likes to point out, no single
runner could be cited as the star~all the boys (lid

A Career

with a Future

0 With 55 plants in 26 states, Koppers activities are so varied
that every day you come in direct contact with some product or
service made possible by Koppers that helps to increase your com-
fort, guard your health, enrich your life.

HISTORY

Origin of Koppers Company, Inc., dates back to June 10, 1907
when Heinrich Koppers, a young German engineer who had de-
vised a better way of heating chemical-recovery coke ovens, es-
tablished engineering offices at Joliet, Ill.

Koppers set about building a battery of his coke ovens for the
Illinois Steel Company. The budding young steel industry of the
United States watched with interest, recognizing that the Koppers
ovens made better coke, and at the same time recovered the gas,
tar and other products which the old bee-hive ovens burned off.

GROWTH

From a small engineering firm, later purchased by American
interests and moved to Pittsburgh, K0’ pers grew rapidly, enter-
ing new ﬁelds opened by the chemicall)-recovery coke ovens. To
supply cities with gas and coke, it built for itself and operated
several batteries of the coke ovens. It built plants for the recovery
of benzene and toluene which were s() badly needed for produc-
tion of explosives during World VV-ar I. It began to make tar
products such as road and rooﬁng materials. to find \-Jays of get-
ting more of the chemical derivatives from tar, and to utilize
certain chemicals that could berecovered from the coking process.

Experience at building complicated coke oven batteries led
Koppers into other ﬁelds of metallurgical engineering and con-
struction. Today Koppers and its Freyn Engineering Department
are known throughout the world as builders of superior blast
furnaces, sintering plants, rolling mills and entire integrated steel
plants.

 

Koppers is a world leader in design-
ing and constructing coke oven plants

345

World War II saw a need for synthetic rubber, and the govern-
ment, recognizing Koppers ability in constructing specialized
chemical plants, asked it to build a plant at Kobuta, Pa., to make
styrene and butadiene, primary ingredients of synthetic rubber.

After the war, Koppers purchased part of the Kobuta plant and
converted it to the manufacture of the versatile plastic molding
material—polystyrene. With ﬁve other chemical plants in opera-
tion, Koppers has become a growing unit of America’s rapidly
expanding chemical industry.

RESEARCH

Recpgnizing that continued growth demands unceasing efforts
to better serve industry and the public, Koppers places great em-
phasis on scientiﬁc research . . . research that makes many prod-
ucts better and many better products possible.

_Koppers operates a new Research Center at Verona, Pennsyl-
vania, where nearly 200 scientists, technicians and other research
men and women work to create new and better products and
processes.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

A career with Koppers oﬁers the qualified college graduate in-
teresting work, at good pay and with a high degree of job security.
Comprehensive training programs have been developed to pre-
pare you for an initial position and for future advancement. Ex-
ecutive positions are, with few exceptions. ﬁlled by those who
have come up through the ranks.

INQUIRIES

College graduates who may be interested in a career with
Koppers are invited to Contact the personnel placement oﬂices of
their respective schools, or communicate with the Personnel Man-
ager, Industrial Relations Department, Koppers Company, Inc.,

Luke Swank

In the very beginning, when Pittsburgh was only a cluster of cabins at the
Point, two dreams stirred its soul—-a splendid, surging materialism, and a yearning
for cultural growth. That these two have achieved a happy symbiosis is brilliantly
expressed today in the Cathedral of Learning.

0 It could have been a temptation, in this town of teeming potentialities,
to concentrate solely on the practical. Wealth always burgeoned here—in farm
products, coal, iron, glass, oil, and steel. Any man with horse-sense and a right
good will to work, could wrest a fortune from the wilderness, seemingly overnight.

0 This city was singularly blessed though, by the quality of the people who
came here in search of a fuller life. They recognized early a need for the specialized
type of training our industries would require. But they wished, for their sons and
daughters, much more than this. With William Penn they believed that “good
and commendable learning is to be preferred before wealth.”

O A succession of such great men—founders, trustees, Chancellors, teachers,
and alumni—have steered our university’s destiny from the log cabin Academy
of 1787 to the Cathedral of today. Under their vigil has grown up a special type of
university that marries, in its wide curriculum, both the cultural and the practical.
The Cathedral of Learning, itself a uniquely American architectural expression,
is a symbol of a uniquely American type of education.

0 Also uniquely American was the early development of the food manu-
facturing business. For more than three generations we have been preparing
ready-to-serve delicacies to save the time and effort of America’s housewives.

omen’s Choral

Pres. Suzanne Janos
V. Pres. Anna Mae Bartirome
Bus. l\Tgr. Norma Handlos
Sec. Theresa Seboly
Adv. l\Tr. Kniseley

Through the voices of the group of young
ladies, one can see they are happy when the time
arrives for them to get together to sing. The tunes
are directed by their new director Phillip Kniseley,
who leads them in singing such songs as Father
Williams from Alice in Wonderland, Lobster
Quadrilly, (lomirzg Through the Rye, and Why do I
Love You*The Women in the choral group have
the highest respect for each other. They have
also gained a greater appreciation of both classical
” and modern music.

£ “This organization gives a feeling of friendship
‘ and just belonging”, says Barbara lVIcCants.

Y ‘. *
g p Other members say

“For any women interested
in singing, learning a Variety of melodies and mak
ing new friends the W'omen’s Choral is the best.”

“Let’s try the chorus again.”

l\Ir. Kniseley demonstrates the alto part.

In the Refractory Business...
                   THE HEAT IS ON
                          Every Day and Night
     In the plants that make iron, steel, glass, petroleum and aluminum many of the key
     processes are conducted at extremely high temperatures. Harnessing the heat in tl,._,
     processes is the job performed by refractories.
     Refractories are standard and special shapes made from fire clay, magnesia, chrome
     ore, alumina, silica rock and many other minerals. They form the walls and linings of
     blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, glass tanks, coke ovens, melting furnaces, heat     ing furnaces, boiler settings and other structures where heat must be confined to do
     useful work. They must be produced in many different sizes and compositions of
     material to properly serve the various applications.
                                        Progress in industrial processes is fre                                        quently dependent upon the development
                                        of new and better refractories. During the
                                        last 88 years research by Harbison-Walker
                   ",2      has led in the development of many new
                                        and vastly improved refractories - mak..                                   ing possible improved glass, aluminum,
                                        iron, steel, and petroleum products.
                                        With mines, plants, and quarries in 14
                                        "states, Harbison-Walker is the world lead                                        er in refractory production and research.

FOR YOU
AND YOUR PATIENT
HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN IMPORTANT
   This is why, after 110 years, we are still pioneering, still
 searching, still devising, still improving, to promote better aids
 for dentistry. Perhaps you are aware of this.
   There is a dramatic story, for example, much too long, for
 this page, in the evolution of S. S. White Equipment for con venience and comfort in the dental operating room. It stems
 from "headrest that can be adapted to any kind of chair, well
 suited to the traveling dentist," made by Dr. Samuel S. White
 in 1844, through the first self-cleansing cuspidor made in
'66, the first electric engine in'70, first all-metal chair in'71,
 first chair to introduce the compensating seat and backrest
 in'72, the first hydraulic chair in'77, the first chair to give
 horizontal position in'99, the first equipment unit in 1913.
 The list of "firsts" is long, impressive, touches almost every
 phase of dentistry.
   In 1938 the S. S. White Master Unit brought modern styling
into the operating room. In 1950, a new triumph in dentistry's
conquest over pain came with the introduction of the S. S.
White "Airdent" Unit for cavity preparation by the "Airbrasive Technique".
  This we hope you will remember always-we and all distributors of S. S. White products have a constant concern for
you and your patients and strive always to provide superlative
service in all we do and make for you. Proof of this will
be evidenced in our free office planning service and convenient
financing terms. Test us. Ask any distributor of S. S. White
Equipment or write direct.

The immaculately clad young men who ap-
pear above individually form a good cross section
of the average Pitt Student. Together, however,
they form a rather remarkable vocal group, the
Pitt l\'Ien’s Glee Club.

Directed by Colin C. Stern, the Glee Club
started the year by electing Don Gardner as
president and Bob Foley as secretary. Samson Air
Force Base and Niagara Falls were the ﬁrst of
many stops in a busy schedule. There were many
stops in western Pennsylvania in the spring tour
ending with a special invitation to the l\Iasonic
Conservatory.

Appearances at the Chancellor’s Reception
and February’s graduation exercises rounded out
a varied schedule.

One of the sections going over their part.

lVIr. Sterne calls for a pianissimo.

                                         thanks.
                         SJust a few words of appreciation to those to whom I cannot express
                                          enough appreciation.
                                          just what the doctor ordered, for the closeness and cooperation which is
Karl Meyers                              needed between the business and the editorial staffs.
                                              Jack Caldwell went through the year firing strobs, developing film,
                                         printing pictures and helping out on layout, typing, writing or anything
                      i                  else that needed to be done. His loyalty and talent were extended to the
                                         limit this year. Thanks, Jack.
                                             Al Skirboll was another business staffer whose personality and ability
                           SJack Caldwell were welcome and necessary.
                                             Bobbi Douglas, in her first year on the staff, did a volume of work
                                         that seemed impossible for such a little girl to manage, Thanks, Bobbi.
                                             Joe Banik and I had become fast friends last year, and if it hadn't been
                                         for Joe's cheerfulness and ability to absorb the steam that I let off once in a
                                         while it would have been a much tougher year.
                                             Paul Gilliland breezed through what is usually one of the toughest
Alan Skirboll                            sections of the book. Paul could always be counted on to produce when the
                                         deadline rolled around.
                                             Lois Duerr became the'copy girl' on the staff this year, besides being
                                         on the classes staff, she was always willing to type all those necessary little
                                         things that seem to be needed at the last moment.
                                             John Obitz did a fantastic job on the fraternities this year; with no
                          SBobbi Douglas previous experience he managed to meet a rough deadline in December
                                         that consisted of his entire section, a fine job Johnny.
                                             Joan Stigers, who poured out the thousands of words needed, is another
                                         to whom no words can express my thanks.
                                             Tom Vrana, another first year member, came to be depended upon
                   Joe Banik             for that crucial photo. You did a terrific job, Tom.
                                Joe Bak      With more space, I could go on to enumerate each member of the staff
                                         to say how much they've given to the OWL in time and talent. But know                                         ing them, I know they realize the gratitude I feel towards them.
                                             The commercial firms and their representatives that helped me this
                                         year are some of the finest people I know. They are: Donald Messinger and
                                         Mrs. Jewell Gates of Wm. J. Keller Inc.; Ralph Benz of the S. K. Smith Co.;
                           Paul Gilliland and S. M. Fields of Delma Studios.
                                             Some of those here at the university to whom I would like to express
                                         my appreciation are: Mr. Theodore Biddle, Dean of Men; Mrs. Agnes
                                         Starrett, university editor; Mr. Thomas Jarrett, university photographer,
                                         for your help, cooperation and encouragement, many thanks.
                                             And finally, I would like to say'thank you' to my family. Though I
Lois Duerr                               had to give them a picture of me, so that they would remember what I
                                         looked like, my mother and my father were unflagging in their interest and
                                         loyalty.
                                             And to him that follows, may I wish you the luck of having the same
                                         type of staff that has been my pride and joy this year.

Pitt students will always ﬁnd Dr. Luccock’s
door open, and they’ll ﬁnd that he's never too
busy to listen to their religious problems,
regardless of their creed.

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald, Paul Schrad-
ing and Dr. Emory Luccock have just finished
discussing plans for the Campus Chapel Ser-
Vices.

Many of the services at Heinz Chapel are
led by students themselves. Here we ﬁnd
Ross Reese leading services.

The Canterbury Association of the University
of Pittsburgh aims to serve Christianity in a higher
education by fostering among its members a bet-
ter understanding of the faith and practices of the
Episcopal Church.

Among the services rendered to its members
the association serves Holy Communion each week
on Thursday. It also has an added function of con-
sultations With the Episcopal ministers for its
members who might like to talk over something,

or to straighten themselves out on some point of
religion.

l\Iembership is open to all students who are
Episcopalian, or who are interested in the Episco-
palian Church.

As a social club, the Canterbury Association
is also quite active, as can be seen by its popular
dinner-dances once a month and its Weekly social
dinners which is a very good incentive to get mem-
bers to meeting on time.

After the meeting the group stays for a session of music.

Pitt students, sitting around in the Y.M.H.A. Hillel lounge,

participate in the activities and interests of a group
with a similar faith as your own. The Hillel
Foundation, however, with its many varied ac-
tivities around campus, has tried to make it pos-

sible for more Jewish students to participate in a ' I
religious organization. In September and Febru-  l   U n d  I 
ary, they sponsored a Freshman tea; and in the

Religion-in-Life VVeek program, Hillel took a deep

interest. During the year, Hillel also combines with

other Religious organizations on campus in the PreS- S-31111161 Balk

Foundation has a more serious side to their ac- R39 S90 B93 L3b0VitZ
tivities; weekly Jewish religious services are held, T1'e3S- léwanuel Slawkill
and there are also classes on the “l\Iodern Trend Ad“ Rabbi 1W01‘1‘iS Feldmafl

Student Association

The Lutheran Student Association is one of
the busiest religious organizations on campus.
Their activities, however, are not limited to re-
ligious projects although that is the major function
for which it exists. Barn dances, swim parties, and
socials at the student center make up the lighter
side of their schedule. On the more formal and
serious side are weekly Seminars in the New Testa-
ment, dinner rallies with representatives from Pitt,
Tech, and PCW and the Nursing schools of the
area meeting for an informal dinner and a dis-
cussion group afterwards.

Their cooperation with other school groups as
well as with those within their own university
certainly helps to put across the true purpose
of their organization.

Andrew Ednie’s latest joke gets a big laugh from the fellows
and girls.

The purpose of the Newman Club is to deepen
the spiritual and enrich the temporal lives of its
members through a balanced program of religious,
cultural and social activities, so that there will
develop in the Catholic student a quality of leader-
ship to represent its student membership in Uni-
versity aﬁairs, and to help carry out University
duties.” This is a statement of the purpose of the
Newman Club; the listing of outstanding student
participation on campus justifies every word of
their credo Paul Gallagher, Treasurer of Business
Administration Class; Theresa VVojciak, Twelfth
ﬂoor guild advisor; Alice Smolkovich, Nationality
Room hostess Guild advisor; and Chuck Fritz,
Druids . . . this is only a part of their participa-
tion in the University and it speaks highly of this
ﬁne religious organization.

Paul gets some help on how to plan a good social event from
other members of the organization.

Chuck and Tom seem to think that this idea might not be so
good.

The newest organization on the Pitt campus is
Pi Theta. This organization is not exactly a
fraternity, but a close fellowship formed by the
pre-theological students at the University. Pi
Theta provides a common ground for the religious
students to meet, understand, and appreciate
the other faiths and denominations.

Thomas Cooper was the ﬁrst president of
Pi Theta. Presiding at the bi-monthly meetings,
he was capably assisted by Paul Schrading, chair-
man of Religion-in-Life \Veek; John Bucher,
president of the Lutheran student association;
and advised by the university chaplain, Dr.
Luccock.

The main purpose of Pi Theta is to help the
pre-theological members in choosing the best
courses and activities at the university for their
purposes, and to acquaint others with the prob-
lems and opportunities of full time theological
work.

Every Thursday at 1:00 P.M. The H.C.C.
don their velvet robes of royal purple, to sing for
Campus Chapel. In the Words of their director
Dr. Theodore M. Finney the work of the choir is
to the end that the worship of God may have
dignity and beauty and meaning. In the ﬁfteen
years of its existence the choir has achieved Well
deserved fame, not only at Pitt but throughout
this section of the country. By its concert tours,
its television appearances and performances at
University functions it has become a symbolic
representative of Pitt and Pittsburgh.

Perhaps the best description of the purpose
of the choir comes from one of its members. He
said: We practice our art for the service of God.
Our rewards, quite various, and at times seemingly
unrelated to our chief work, really have the func-
tions at their foundations. The music we make,
when we make it as we should, has important
meaning only as it relates to that fundamental
function.

Roger Wi||iam’s Fellowship

The Roger Williams Fellowship is the name
of the Baptist student fellowship for the Pitts-
burgh area. Organized in 1947, its headquarters
are located in The First Baptist Church at Belle-
ﬁeld and Bayard Streets, very near the campus.
Regular Thursday evening meetings of the Fellow-
ship are held here and are open to young people
of college age regardless of national background
or church aﬁiliation. The purposes of this group
are inspiration, recreation, spiritual growth,
training in Christian leadership, cooperative and
coordinated campus and community service,
education, and promotions of inter-denomina-
tional and inter-collegiate understanding. In a
large university such as ours, this organization
does much in bringing together many members
and students.

The VVesley Fellowship includes all Methodist
students from Pitt, Tech, and P. C. VV. On the
University campus, it is one of the many religious-
ly active organizations that wants to provide for
the student a religious affiliation away from home.
In carrying out this program many social and com-
munity affairs form a basic part of the year’s
schedule. Bowling parties, a box social, dinner
meetings, and weekend trips twice during the
school year help to provide a varied social list
that keeps the year a busy one. In furthering youth
interest in the church of the community, the
W’esley Fellowship sends out deputation teams at
the request of a particular church; this group
made up of members of the Fellowship leads the
youth program in the church.

The Young Men’s Christian Association at Pitt is a
fellowship whose primary purpose is to associate students in
Christian living and to help them discover and accept the
full meaning of Christian discipleship for their own lives and
society.

The Pitt Yl\ICA is concerned with four main areas
relevant to their purpose. These, along with some special
events are initiated and planned by the committee of
Management, a student-faculty organization and the student
cabinet that meets once a Week throughout the year.

The YMCA is also one of the vertebrae in the backbone
of Religion-in-Life Program which is held each spring semes-
ter. During this week, laymen and theologians, both local
and national, talk on a selected theme which is important
to college students.

Except for Mr. Payne’s absence it looks like an executive board
meeting of the ‘Y.’

For two years the directory has listed both male
and female students.

The members of this honorary are in con-
tinuous service to Pitt. Some of these exercises
include ushering at commencement exercises,
proctoring a Freshmen VVeek events and also for
the men’s customs exams; and Pitt Chest Fund
speakers and workers.

One of the chief projects in 1953 was working
at summer scout camps. Since Alpha Phi Omega
is an honorary scouting service fraternity, the
chapter at Pitt works in cooperation with Pitts-
burgh Boy Scout troops on many projects. There
are now 1242 similar chapters throughout the
United States although Pitt was the second of its
kind to be formed.

the year. The members of the Arnold Air Society
have been recognized for their high qualiﬁcations
as Air Force ROTC cadets. The aim of the group
in general is to try and advance the student in-
terest in the United States Air Force and the

The Gold and Blue student directory seen
and used constantly around the campus is a
product of this highly active organization. The
Cwens this year have lived up to the purpose of
their organization, part of which is; through their
service to the campus, to serve the university.
And the Cwens are really busy serving the uni-
versity, besides the student directory, they in-
terpret the nationality rooms for the visitors,
giving interesting sidelights on each room and on
the artists who created them. And if that weren’t
enough to keep these girls busy, Cwens also act
as advisors to the freshman guilds.

This organization is not entirely service
however, on December sixth the girls got together
with the Cwen organization from Carnegie Tech
as a part of their well planned social program.
And in this way are serving the university again
by promoting their inter—collegiatc relations.

November is banquet and initiation time for

Lambda, the honorary business education fra-

They have faculty speakers, honored guests, and
alumni at their large affairs and social gatherings.

Another annual D.D.L. event is the Christ-
mas party at one of the sorority houses on campus.
They exchange presents and have good things
to eat.

All of Delta Delta Lambda’s activities have’
been built on the premise of encouraging and hon-
oring outstanding scholarship in the field of Bus.
Ed. In keeping with this premise, a 2.0 average
or better is necessary for membership in the
fraternity. l\Ien and women who are invited to
join are challenged to consistently maintain
their high scholastic standing. \Vith a foundation
as solid as this, Delta Delta Lambda has had no

the season and feature barn dances, a formal, and
picnics in the spring.

Its more serious business is the recognition

The men in this honorary have not made
this their only activity as is exempliﬁed by the
roster of the organization. Among their members
are Elmer Shuster, president of Inter-fraternity
council and Omicron Delta Kappa and Paul

The Pitt Band is a lively addition to a pep meeting in Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial.

There is a great deal of pride evident when
Pitt students talk about the Varsity l\Iarching
Band. And behind that high stepping group of
bandsters is the Kappa Kappa Psi, service fra-
ternity. Members of Kappa Kappa Psi print the
band newspapers, provide T-shirts and sweaters
and sponsor the “Bandsman of the Year” award.

VVhen a visiting band is served hot coffee,
donuts, or cider, it’s Kappa Kappa Psi members
who are responsible. The organizing of the band
shows is also a major job of the honorary, along
with assisting in the direction of the performances.

After the Penn State game, the members
sponsored a formal in the Georgian Room of
VVebster Hall. They also sponsored the annual
banquet for the band alumni.

1953-54 marked the sixth year on campus for
this fraternity. l\Iembers have found that the
band is not all marching and music because Kap-
pa Kappa Psi plans for the year many social
affairs—s0me stag, but more often date affairs.

It’s practice like this that makes the band reviews so good.

Powders, pills, organic chemistry and many
hours of pharmacy tests didn’t prevent the
women of Lambda Kappa Sigma, honorary
pharmaceutical fraternity, from having a busy,
active year.

Besides all the planning for rushing parties
and pledge period, Lambda Kappa Sigma mem-
bers found time to have bake sales and many
informal gatherings. Proceeds from the sales
were used to extend the fraternity’s scientiﬁc
and social program.

Pitt’s undergraduate chapter was particularly
proud of its close bond with the Delta Graduate
Chapter of the fraternity in the School of Phar-
macy.

Unique in its ﬁeld, the fraternity allows an
opportunity for similarly interested students to
become acquainted, and enjoy their common
interest in pharmacy.

Organized in 1918 the organization provided
fellowship for a small group of women students.
Since then it has grown rapidly adopting itself
to the large increase of women students.

In November, the Mortar Board members
had a Thanksgiving dinner, prepared the food, and

Pi Tau Phi a local honorary that is really

men and women who have maintained a Q.5
quality point average or better. Even though this
is an organization that is primarily concerned with
scholastics it has its social life, in November Pi
Tau Phi held its fall dinner meeting and as a
special part of that meeting was a tour of the
Carnegie Museum Medieval Armor Show. Also
in January and April the honorary held its initi-
ation banquets and in March they held a new
event which was a get-acquainted social with
movies and a guest speaker.

A project of the local group is two awards
to be presented to the senior man and senior
woman in the college who have maintained the
highest overall quality point average in their
four years at Pitt.

brotherhood and understanding among all na-

busy with many things on campus. This year,
however, they are adding to their list of projects

Some members of Scabbard and Blade discuss the require-

Scabbard and Blade, whose members repre-
sent all departments of the armed forces, is the
only national undergraduate honorary society of
its kind. Organized on the Pitt campus in 1927,
Company D of the Seventh regiment has endeav-
ored to live up to the high ideals set by its found-
ers. The major purpose of Scabbard and Blade is
to promote and reward efficiency in the training
of Reserve Officers.

On l\Tarch 17 of this year there was a Scab-
bard and Blade Day banquet. Pitt, Tech, and
Duquesne companies joined for the ﬁrst time to
honor their organization at the three local schools.

Company D’s special project for 1953-54
was to revise completely the pledge program, to
_ remove all objectionable hazing, and to impart
Making plans for the group after a consultation with Major to the candidates as much knowledge of military

Language is one of the main links in the
chain of communication. To the Sigma Kaps, the
language is not limited to English. Foreign lan-
guage is the link that Sigma Kappa strives to add
to the chain. They consider this necessary, es-
pecially in view of the decreasing size of our world.

Annually high school and Pitt students are
entertained by Sigma Kappa Phi. The day’s
activities are similar to other high school days
with plays, recital, and speeches, except that only
foreign languages are spoken.

There is a full social schedule for the Sigma
Kaps, especially during Christmas. This is the
time of the year when each language group por-
trays how Christmas is celebrated in their re-
spective lands.

Student Government

Social Committee members socialize a bit themselves over a
cup of tea in the Commons Room.

Congress committee meeting.

One of the features of this year’s Student
Congress program was a monthly dinner-meeting
with a member of the faculty or administration as
guest speaker each month. The student solons
obtained a better over-all picture of the University
through the talks and the open discussions which
followed and used the knowledge thus gained to
increase their efliciency in coping with student
problems.

Under an ambitious program of objectives
and projects, the members had their work cut out
for them and found the life of a congressman to be
a busy oneif not an easy task. They had their
ups and downs with legislative problems but a list
of the SC achievements this year is impressive.

Their annual High School Day program was
an outstanding success as well as a colorful event
in the Fall semester. Organization of the Aca-
demic Promotions Committee, the founding of
the Student Orchestra, an agreement with neigh-
boring colleges on pep rally damages to campuses,
and an investigation of the parking situation were
only a few of their accomplishments.

year co-sponsoring the mixer dances with l\Ien’s
Council which gets the freshmen acquainted with
each other and the upper class students. And there
was something new this year in the line of social
events, as the Transfer Committee headed by
Barbara Douglas held a tea for all the transfer
women students.

Also, proving Pitt women equal to the men,
the Traditions committee brought out the Pitt
blazer for women. A very ﬂattering piece of ap-
parel that made a hit with the girls as well as the
boys.

Instead of squinting at green armbands this
year, the men on campus this year squinted at
blue and gold ones on the arms of freshman wom-
en. This was the work of the Customs committee.

And, as always, the girls of WSGA were
working to foster a spirit of loyalty to the uni-

the builder’s message

Pittsburgh is in the midst of anlera of vigorous new growth and

development that has gained world-wide attention and recognition. Covering
almost every phase of community life, the Pittsburgh Program is broad and
balanced——a fact that represents perhaps its most noteworthy and remarkable
aspect.

Evidence of the physical changes are strikingly visible and
apparent—in the imposing skyline of the Triangle, at the Point where a
36-acre park will restore the beauty of this historic Gateway to the West,
and in the towering skyscrapers of steel and stone and aluminum that
exemplify Pittsburgh’s economic resurgence.

lt is evident, too, because of smoke and ﬂood control, the great airport,
modern highways built to move traffic quickly and efficiently, and the new
parks and playgrounds for wholesome recreation.

Along with the physical rebuilding there has been an equally impressive
cultural and educational rebirth. Carnegie Institute, with its renowned museum,
international art exhibitions, library and musical activities, is a vital part of
this larger and richer picture.

A unique auditorium for year-round use as an amphitheater, sports
arena and convention hall is proiected for the Lower Hill. The symphony
orchestra, the grand opera, summer operettas and the Pittsburgh
Playhouse productions have achieved distinction and rank among the finest
in the country. WQED has been established in the pioneering ﬁeld of
educational television.

New buildings and expanding facilities at the University of Pittsburgh,
Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pennsylvania College for Women, and
Duquesne University are but part of the plans of these leading institutions for
enlarging and enriching their services to youth and community. The University
Medical Center with its many affiliated hospitals, schools, and clinics is
destined for a leading role in this age of miraculous medical progress.

Most important of all is the way the program is touching the lives of
the people who live and work here and attracting to Pittsburgh
outstanding executives, scientists, engineers, scholars, physicians, and research
workers who see an opportunity for a fuller and richer life in this dynamic
industrial community.

The accomplishments which have already been made on the many
phases of the Pittsburgh Program during the four years the Class of 1954
has been in the University are substantial and significant and have created
the solid foundation for greater achievements in the days ahead.

Men's Council

The fall semester mixer dances ‘are the ﬁrst
social affairs for the freshman students as a group.
The men and women get acquainted, enjoy re-
freshments and have a special party at the holiday
mixer. All this fun is planned and produced by
Men’s Council in cooperation with VVSGA. They
are active in helping the individual student to ad-
just to university life and to provide recreation
and relaxation within the school for the students.

Twice a year the Men’s Council Bookstore
opens on the eighth floor for the sale and resale
of used books. This year the council also spon-
sored the sale of Civic light opera, Nixon, and
l\Iay Beegle concert tickets doing a total business
of $8000. They saved the students $6000. through
this program.

MC is also investigating the possibility of a
faculty-advisory system which would give each
student a faculty advisor during his four years at
Pitt. This would lessen the confusion for the fresh-
man students and aid the upperclass members in
planning their schedules.

Men’s Council always seems to ﬁnd time to
remember the student and his problems and lend
a helping hand.

THE OWL

To a great many students the Owl is just .a
large ledger to which in later years they can refer
to prove to unbelieving grandchildren that they
really did attend college. But to those who pro-
duced it and whose talents went into it, the Owl
is not just a book; it is part of them. To the stall’
the things to be remembered are not how good
the pictures were or how Well the book was laid
out, but the experiences they had and the friends
they made during their years on the stall’.

This year’s staff was headed by Chuck Sup-
rock and Karl Meyers, who used his experience
as business manager of the 1953 Owl to the utmost.
Karl planned and carried out a successful year for
the Owl. Managing his staff with a practiced hand,
he appointed Alan Skirboll as circulation manager
and Al, with less than a thousand portraits of
seniors and undergraduates taken, worked doubly
hard to sell the required number of subscriptions.
Mark Friedman, organizations manager, did a
ﬁne job of contacting the various organizations
and ﬁnding out exactly what their needs were.
One of the most pleasant surprises on Karl’s staﬂ’
was Bob \Vilkins, who took care of advertising;
it was Bob’s ﬁrst year on the staff and he managed
through hard work to send the advertising budget
over the top. Rounding out the business staﬂ’
were Mimi Weiss, publicity manager, and Eugene
Reinbold, circulation.

working full time at night and student teaching

The Pitt News

The Pitt News adopted a new feature in the
Fall semester to give better coverage to social
activities sponsored by small organizations and
dubbed it “Pittpourri.” The enthusiastic response
to the column has been characteristic of many of
the NEWS features this year.

Under Editor-in-Chief Tim Kovar, a compara-
tively green staff undertook the task of maintain-
ing their Associated Collegiate Press All-American
rating which they have obtained for nine of the
last ten semesters. With nine assistant editors,
an editorial staff of 30 students, and a business
staff of 10 under Business l\Ianager Joe Shuler,
the NEWS buckled down to the business of re-
porting the daily goings-on at Skyscraper U.

Their biggest news break of the season was
undoubtedly the announcement of the 15 mill-
ion dollar grant to the Medical School from the
Mellon Foundations. The NEWS was fortunate
enough to publish the entire story at the same
time the downtown papers printed the story,
earning the praise of their professional brother
journalists.

Sports Editor Russ Franke and his staff
had a busy time chasing the Panthers around the
country to follow the football games and had the
added task of spotting the games for Ray Scott.
They instituted the ﬁrst All-American college
football selections by the editors of college news-
papers and gained national fame for their efforts.

Credit for good sharp reporting went to staff-
ers John DeNinno, Cecy Lincoff, Jim DeWeese,
Judy Gotterer, Nancy Jones, Nancy Schor, and
Irv Rothman.

Meanwhile, the business staff was faced with
the traditional battle of income vs. expenditures
and managed to keep the NEWS running smooth-
ly despite increased costs.

This past semester marked the third full
year of publication of the SIryscra.per Engineer, a
semi-technical magazine.

This year Mr. James A. Fallon was the editor
and the quality of the magazine attests to Jim’s
proﬁciency. He met and conquered many “haz-
ards” during the year with the helping hand of a
good staff in the makeup of one of the ﬁnest
magazines of its kind in the United States.

Some of the staff members who contributed
greatly to the Skyscraper were Bill Rimmel, man-
aging editor; Bill Svec, art editor; T om Bundorf,
layout editor, and Irvin Spangler, features. Others
who contributed greatly were Esther Currie, Vir-
gil Smeltzer, Cecil Townsend, Louis Lubert, and
Norman Hanevich.

ald E. Swarts. Second Row: B. Rimmel, VV. Vogt, N. Sirianni, R. Varga, C. Lockard, T. Bundorf, G. Pasekoff, J. Fallon, VV.
Svec, D. Rohaus.

The Business end of the magazine was
capably handled by Paul Weiner, the business
manager. Paul learned one pet phrase this past
year, “It costs too much.” Paul deserves a great
deal of praise for keeping such a good eye on the
budget. Nick Sirianni was Paul’s able helper, and
a very hard working assistant business manager.

Wlilliam lVIcKenna handled the circulation
of the magazine. Bill received much help from
John Keenan who was his assistant.

The staff of the Skyscraper was also very
lucky to have excellent advisors, and should like
to extend their appreciation to Mr. VV'lliam G.
Vogt, Dr. D. E. Swarts, Professor A. C. Ackenheil
and Professor N. H. VVackenhut for the time they
gave to the problems of the magazine.

The Pitt Capsule is the student publication
of the School of Pharmacy under the auspices of
the student branch of the American Pharmaceuti-
cal Association. It is a monthly publication of the
activities of students and alumni and features
‘articles of interest to both.

Included are columns such as the “Greek
Corner” which is fraternity and sorority news,
“New Products” describing current therapeutic
remedies on the market, and their uses, and news
of graduates in the “Alumni News.”

Since the (,’a.psule was first organized in 1947,
it has become one of the major student activities
of the Pharmacy students. It provides an oppor-
tunity for students to work in a ﬁeld other than
the major one of science, and thus develops a
variety of interests.
