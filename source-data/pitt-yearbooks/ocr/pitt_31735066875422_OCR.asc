A Mile AHEAD

Cross Country

he early morning sun beat down harshly on the

runners’ glistening skin. Bulging from the high—cut

shorts, muscles tightened while waiting impatiently

for the deafening roan Bang! The gun signaled the
start as eyes focused on the goal ahead.Whizzing past the
beautiful serenity of playgrounds, open ﬁelds, and the trees
and ﬂowers of Schenley Park, these cross—country runners
had their eyes set on only one type of breathtaking scenery:
the glorious sight of a trophy Owning this symbol of
success almost makes up for the countless blisters, the
numerous shin splints, the thirty pairs of worn out sneakers,
and the ten empty jars of lcy l-lot. Not to mention waking
up on a Saturday morning at 7:30. But these men and
women, with their incredible stamina and endurance were
willing to give up much—wanted sleep to make Pitt proud.
Hours upon hours of practices and achy bones didn’t deter
these runners from the sport because they love to run. And
it shows.They have been winning meets and invitationals for
years, traveling all over to do so.

ln what seemed like the blink of an eye, the ﬁve

miles were all overThere was gasping for air, sweat
streaming, muscles cramping, water bottles ﬂowing, coaches
congratulating, and lots of smiling.

E//enmarie Agnew

"BANG!

The women's cross country team
after their meet, cheer on the men.

houts from the Pitt soccer players
covered the ﬂeld.They called on each
other for assistance, warned one
another of an opponent’s presence,
and cheered each other on.The loudest voice of
them all rose from the goalkeeper instructing her
team from the end of the ﬁeld. Minutes later, she
crashed against the ground, using her hips to stop
the ball from reaching the goal. She pushed
herself to her feet with one arm while cradling
the ball with the other, then kicked the ball
across the green. She brushed the grass and
dirt from her shorts and began yelling again.

The team’s senior goalie made some
noise in other ways; she was named Big East
Goalkeeper of the Year for the second
consecutive year With an even mix of seniors,

juniors, sophomores and freshmen, the Panthers
completed the regular season with the team's
highest winning percentage in six seasons.These
results weren’t surprising, considering this team
consisted of an unforgiving goalie, a sophomore
with a hat trick—three goals in one game—in the
ﬁrst half of a game, and a senior previously chosen
as a member of the Big East All—Rookie Team.
Not only did these women build their
muscles from bicep to calf, they concentrated in
class and studied their notes.With more than half
of the team named University Scholar Athletes
and/or Big East Academic All—Stars, the women’s
soccer team proved they were more than
defensive and offensive champions of the sport.

PRACTICE

Duratz Sports Complex

Pittsburgh Panther football player walked by on his way
to practice. His legs, like chiseled stone, strode across
the land he knew was his territory. His shoulders were
broad, his chest thick, and his head held high in the air

He entered through the doors of the UPMC Sports Performance
Complex, home to the Duratz Sports Complex, and sauntered into
the massive labyrinth of state—of—the—art facilities.

The only thing as awe-inspiring as the fearless men who
wear the blue and gold is the complex in which they practice.The
list of amenities and luxuries suits a team with the heart, desire and
talent of the Panthers.The Duratz Complex houses three impressive
practice ﬁelds (two outdoor and one indoor), a high tech Iron
Works weight training center, a therapeutic pool, radiology and
laboratory services, and a lO0,000 sq. ft. patient rehab center

The player continued on his path through the complex
and joined his teammates for a practice that was, like all others,
top secret. An aura of mystery surrounded the ZOOI Panther
football season, as only players, coaches, and those who held a
coveted media pass were admitted to the practices. Every Tuesday,
Wednesday,Thursday, and Friday the team held meetings, ran
drills and scrimmaged.Twice a week they lifted weights.

And as they poured forth from the tunnel at each game,
cheered on by the thunderous roar of the crowd, the men in the
blue and gold became true heroes, striving for victory and
everything Pittsburgh fans know and love about Panther football.

or the students who put

togetherThe Pitt News every

day, reporting was basically just a

respectable cover Whether they
were copy readers, staff writers,
columnists, cartoonists or photographers,
there was one common bond within the
staff — they all wanted to be the ﬁrst to
know. So chances are this group would
have been digging out the truth even
without the allure of a printed byline and
a modest paycheck.

The self—diagnosed reporters
(and the rest of the staff) strove every
day to inform, enlighten, stimulate, amuse
and entertain the Pitt community. Even if
it meant giving up nights off and serious
hours in sleep to work more than 50
hours each week.

There was something magical
about the smell of fresh newsprint and
the way it seeped between the creases

= he hours between 3:30 a.m. and 6 a.m.
were generally the quietest in Holland
Hall, but even that wasn't guaranteed
when sharing living space with 50 other
women. It became necessary to learn how to block
out those noises that weren't signiﬁcant, such as
the ringing of the alarm bell in the elevator or the
constant ﬂushing of toilets at all hours ofthe night.
Perhaps there was no better example of
fate in action as in dorm buildings. Some supreme
being (or, more likely the Residence Life personnel)
decided which students would become the closest
of friends.They decided where these students
would sleep and where they would showerThey
decided where students would learn important
lessons of their lives, such as how to cook ramen
without a stove or who delivered pizza faster.
Dorm life was unlike any other living

situation. Students learned to appreciate the rare
occasion of having the bathroom to themselves, or

 

the quiet half—hour designated for napping between
classes.They learned to appreciate home—cool<ed meals
after weeks of eating nothing but French fries and pizza.
They might even learn, after spending time living in a
dorm, that home wasn't such a bad place after all.
Despite it all they learned to appreciate their neighbors,
who always had a word of advice or an ear to listen
when needed./\nd whether these students resided in
the Quad, Suther|and,Towers or Forbes, their experience
probably made an impression to last for years.

September |8th vigil in front of the cathedral.

September 11th

n the wake of September I lth, 200 l , the skies

were silent across the United States, everyone

frozen in fear of the aftershocks from the attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

ln the days afterwards, media reports were
somber and eerie without the usual celebrity gossip,
instead replaying the terrible footage of the attacks.
American flags ﬁlled the lawn of Soldiers and Sailors;
apartment, dorm and car windows; and made their way
onto bookbags and lapels. Grieving citizens throughout
the nation chimed in with prayers for the nation.Across
Pittsburgh campuses, religious organizations held prayer
meetings and candlelight vigils, ﬁrst for the victims killed
in the World Trade Center collapse, then later for the
lost lives and homes ofAfghani civilians.

But many students questioned the war against
terrorism, and gathered at Pitt and across the nation to
voice their misgivings at peace rallies, hoping to bring
about discussion on the role of the United States in the
aftermath of terrorist attacks.

Whether in favor of or opposed to military
response, an overwhelming amount of students
gathered to donate blood to the Red Cross, attended
and organized protests or simply dropped change in
United Way jars. ln the days and weeks after the
eleventh, students hoped that their contributions,
however small, could help ease the widespread
suffering, both in Afghanistan and the United States.

Roar of

ain poured down in buckets on the last

day ofAugust, a day ending the first week

of c|asses.A soaked blue and gold nylon

sheet rested over a large lump on the lawn
outside the Union, and a small crowd awaited the
unveiling of the new statue, huddled under their
umbrellas and hooded raincoats. Protected under a
small tent, Chancellor Nordenberg began to give an
abbreviated history of the Panther as the University
mascot, but not abbreviated enough given the wet
weather He laughedsympathetically as the onlookers
shivered, telling them he'd save the speech for
another day.

Students with dripping raincoats wandered
by, craning their necks to determine the cause of all
the commotion. Photographers tried to hide their
cameras from the rain, encroaching on the hospitality
of umbrella owners. Former SGB president George
Mongell and current president JeffAle>< told the
story of the new bronze panther, ordered and built
in Italy over the course of two years.This statue was
one of the Student Government Boardkcontributions,
among manyThe SGB ofﬁce on the 6th ﬂoor of the
Union was the Washington DC ofthe University,
standing up for the rights and requests of its
“people”, of its students.

As a few members of the marching band
played, Monge|l,Alex and the Chancellor braved the
rain to pull off the tarp and reveal the ferocious
shining cat underneath, a symbol of pride for
students to witness every day on their way to class.

Splash & Sparkle

Marching Band and Cheerleading

lumes of smoke rose from the tunnel entrances at

Heinz Stadium. Out of the fog emerged Pitt Band's

drum major, followed by the drum line, the sounds of

their drums echoing throughout the stadium. After a
short percussion solo, the rest ofthe Pitt Band materialized,
causing a wave of applause. Onto the ﬁeld they marched,
l<nees lifted high, each step in perfect unison.Along the
sideline, they proudly played Pitt's theme song.

On the opposite side of the ﬁeld, the cheerleaders
led the way for the Panthers, carrying huge blue and gold flags
that ﬁapped behind them, each printed with one letter of the
word “PlTTSBURGl-l.”They ran toward the 50-yard line, with
long, golden streamers announcing the Panthers’ grand
entrance. During the game, the cheerleaders and dance
teams’ exuberant energy enveloped the crowd as they made
their way around the stadium chanting and cheering.The
crowd gasped as these women did multiple bacl< ﬂips or were
thrown into the air, only to be caught by vigilant arms.

At half—time the band marched onto the ﬁeld, the
golden trumpets and trombones pointed toward the press
box, entertaining and aweing the crowd with their well-
executed formations and captivating music.

A Humble

Living Off Campus

ho knew there would be so many bills? Between rent,
electric, phone, cable, groceries and other hidden costs,
oﬁ‘—campus students often learned more about inde-
pendence and chec|< balancing than they ever thought
possible. On the upside, they were ﬁnally away from the watchful eyes
of 24/7 security guards, which meant no more lD—swiping and signing
in guests. On the downside, the room and board bills no longer went
right to mom and dads doorstep.

An extra ﬁfteen minutes to walk to classes was not unusual,
but the exercise made up for the fact thatTowers Gym was no longer
an option. Memorizing PAT and shuttle schedules became second
nature. Students could now cool< meals in a real kitchen, but on the
downside, Chicl<—Fil—A was no longer a simple swipe of the Panther
Card. Easy Mac was now the meal of choice.

There was that leak above the toilet that was turning the
bathroom into an in—ground pool, but there was also digital cable with
several hundred channels for the student ready to procrastinate.There
were the rowdy neighbors next door whose recreational habits were
less than conducive to sleep, but there was also privacy and a sense of
independence that students had been waiting for since high school
graduation. Living off campus had its ups and downs, but if nothing
else, it gave Pitt students an enticing taste of what lay ahead. ’

the Faith

Religion

riday evening. Before the relaxing could begin, many students

headed into the newly built Hillel Jewish University Center

for weekly services and prayerThere was always a motley

mixture of youth; a guy wearing denim shorts and a diverse-
colored yamaka, dapper men donned in Versace, and women in long
skirts worn to conceal the female form.They conversed in the lobby
about various topics; who was wearing what, the upcoming trip to
Israel or the annual Vodka and Latkes, a Chanukah party held atThe
Attic.Whether they dispersed into the orthodox, reform or
conservative service rooms, these students emerged spiritually
cleansed and gathered together for the Shabbat dinner, which they
could pay for with meal blocks.

Sunday morning. l-lalf—awake students stumbled out of their
dorms and apartments and into the hard, wooden pews of the dimly
lit Heinz Chapel to get their dose of Christian spirituality and
reverence.The high ceilings, massive arches and figures in stained
glass enticed the students to absorb their surroundings, as well as the
sermon. Prayer after prayer, song after song, the hour passed quickly
and students dispersed from the chapel feeling a lot better

Whether it meant practicing over the weekend or during
each day, religion was an immense part of many lives on campus.
Whether it was belonging to the CrossSeekers, a Baptist Campus
Ministry to socials at the Ryan Catholic Newman Center Pittsburgh
Oratory to the numerous other religious organizations across
campus, these students sure knew how to keep the faith.

he Dog Walking/Cat Cuddling Project at
the Animal Rescue League was a popular
project. Entering the East Liberty shelter,
excited barks ﬁlled the air Dogs of all sizes
greeted the Pitt students by standing on their hind
legs and putting their paws on their cages door,
barking and howling as if to say “Pick me — I'm the
cutest!” One volunteer signed out several enthusiastic
dogs and took them for brisk ﬁve—minute walks
outside the shelter When it came time to cuddle
with the cats, students petted them until their purring
reached a low roar
Through the Student Volunteer Outreach,
students gave a few weekend hours to the Ronald
McDonald House or played the piano in the lobby of
Magee—Women’s Hospital. Students with cars bought

and delivered groceries to elderly people unable
to shop for themselves. Students worked in soup
kitchens, tutored or read to children, spent time
playing cards with or just talking to the elderly
living in Oakland.They wrapped gifts for charity
over the holidays, or even dressed up as elves.
Some students actually got their hands dirty,
planting ﬂowers and greenery to make
neighborhoods more beautiful. Some trained to be
counselors for one of Pittsburgh’s emergency
hotlines, consoling and giving hope to people
during times of crisis. lt didn't take much to make a
difference, as any of these students would say, and
the benefits always outweighed any costs.

Exercise

tudents wearing PittT—shirts chatted non—stop while

bicycling in place.An elderly male student appeared

quite out of breath while running on the treadmil|.A

couple of ladies read the latest issues of In Style
while burning calories on the steppers.A young man smiled
proudly as he practically benchpressed his entire body
weight.Weights clanl<ed and the smell of sweat lingered in
the air Lothrop,Trees and Belleﬁeld l-lalls all housed gyms
where this scene occurred daily.

Swimming laps through the crystal blue waters in
the pool at Belleﬂeld orTrees provided students with an
alternative to the gyms. Equipped with water bottles and
headsets, students jogged their way across campus and
beyond.They ran through the park, down Forbes, around the
Cathedral and just about anwvhere else. Some students
didn’t need to leave home for their exercise.Wor|<out
videos blared in the dorms. Gym equipment dominated
space in apartment bedrooms. Students ritually did stomach
crunches and push—ups before bed each night.

Whether they wanted to stay in shape, relieve
everyday stress, lose the
dreaded “freshmen ﬁfteen"
or simply try a new hobby,
exercise became a popular
college pastime for many
students, giving them a
break from their rigorous
schoolday routine.

Graduation

Farewell

osing for photographs in their

caps and gowns, senior class

members had waited for

graduation since their first day of
college began in the Towers dorms four (or
ﬁve, or six) years ago. For non—traditional
students, many of whom had worked far
longer to complete their bachelor's degrees,
this moment was a welcome relief from
years of a too—heavy workload of school,
family and making a living.

Surrounded by more than a
thousand peers in caps and gowns, with
parents and siblings from across the state
and throughout the nation looking on, the
prospect of graduation meant more than
just a diploma that would arrive in the mail a
month later

It was also a dinner at home for the
ﬁrst time in months, or the ﬁrst few days of

summer before starting a full—time job or
moving cross country. For students not going
on to a graduate or professional school,
April 28 marked the end of more than
sixteen years of education that began with
l<indergarten.And most importantly, it
offered the beginning of an answer to the
question that had lingered since the
beginning ofjunior or senior year—what the
future would hold.Who would go on to
become artists, lawyers, nurses or social
workers? Who would travel the world or
win the Nobel Prize? Who would write,
design, become an architect or famous chef?
Who among the graduates would become
professors themselves? Who would ﬁnd their
lives changed forever?

tudents of all majors began their immersion
into the real world with a visit to a fair, where
they attempted to get their proverbial foot in
the proverbial door. Students ironed their
once—forgotten suits and glanced over their resumes
again and again, ﬁxing any crease or any typo, ready
to offer themselves to the world. Prospective
employers smiled and held out their hands as
prospective employees greeted them with resumes
and portfolios as well as a ﬁrm handshake. Plenty of
questions spilled out of their mouths, trying to learn

Best Foot Forward

Graduate Programs at Pitt

or students in some majors, the next logical

step after college was graduate school.

Pharmacy, nursing, law and med students
pursued that degree of higher education required for
their career of choice.The schools of Public Health,
Social Work and Public and International Affairs offered
students diversity in their options after college, the
chance to study a speciﬁc area of their interest.The
prestige of the Katz Graduate School of Business
beckoned to students with bachelor's degrees in
marketing or ﬁnance.The medical school accepted only
the brightest and the best, promising an MD years
down the |ine.The Faculty ofArts and Sciences offered
graduate degrees in 37 different areas, ranging from
linguistics to math to English, a chance to earn an MFA
or eventually the coveted PhD.

It was like senior year all over again, except that
students were seniors in college instead of high school. Recruiting students from the Katz Graduate School of Business.
Students carried their textbooks as well as their GRE,

MCAT, or LSAT study guides. Manila envelopes arrived
in the mail containing applications from grad schools
across the country Considering new schools and
programs, making a decision that would influence the
direction of their lives, weighed heavily on students’
shoulders once more. Many would leave Pittsburgh to
pursue their studies or life elsewhere, but some chose
Pitt as their Alma Mater once again.

From the President

Congratulations!

Dear New Pitt Graduate:

As president of the Pittsburgh Alumni Association, I have found that the association has unlimited
possibilities. As is witnessed by the recent opening of the ﬁrst ever University of Pittsburgh
Alumni Center, your home on campus, the organization has been moving forward decisively to
connect and reconnect alumni to the University. We hope you will register
for the Pitt Online Connection and use its searchable alumni directory to
connect with other Pitt alumni. Connection users also receive our monthly
email newsletter, The Pitt Connection. It s easy to register. Just go to

www.alumni.pitt.edu and follow the link. The alumni association makes the

 

connection available free to Pitt graduates.

Samuel S. Zacharias

We have other ways to help you stay connected to your alma mater.
You could join the Pitt Alumni Recruitment Team, for example, and help recruit the best and the
brightest to the University. Or, if you stay in Pennsylvania, you might like to volunteer for the
Alumni Legislative Network and contact your Pennsylvania legislators about support for the
University and higher education in general.
As a new graduate, you have the opportunity to join the Pitt Alumni Association for a year
for $20 (regular annual membership is $35). Join us. You owe it to yourself to receive the bene-
ﬁts of membership and the company of the thousands

of others who have joined forces in the name of Pitt.

Sincerely,

1%».  ﬂzc/ma”

From the Executive Director

Welcome

Dear New Graduate:

Congratulations on your academic achievement. We know that a tremendous amount of work
and perseverance went into earning your degree, and we hope that you have enjoyed your
experience at Pitt. You have been fortunate to attend during a time of
tremendous growth and development for the University. Pitt s quality is at an
all-time high as is witnessed by the increase in applications, the impressive
amount of sponsored research, and the high ratings achieved by many depart-

ments and programs.

 

The Pitt Alumni Association has a unique role in your future. As you

Leland D. Patouillet

can see on page 136, we have 104 Pitt Clubs and representatives ready to
help keep you connected with Pitt. Whether you want to support your school or college or get in
touch with alumni from your own geographical area, we want to help you achieve your goal.
If you would like to volunteer online, consider joining AlumNet, our career networking program.
You will find many ways to stay involved in the life of the University. Now is the time to join
the thousands of alumni who are building a greater sense of community, which will, in turn,

build a stronger University.

Sincerely,

/éfﬂeaea

A Message from the SGB President

The years spent in college are an opportunity to prepare each student
for success in his or her future.The University of Pittsburgh provided us with
such opportunities. Educational and life experiences confronted us, giving us
more opportunities to meet and overcome any future obstacles that might
face us. Each event, each challenge, made us stronger individuals.

By challenging administrators, staff, and ourselves, the Student
Government sought to improve students academic and also personal life.This
past year, we've focused on housing, ﬁnancial aid and safety We brought
students’ concerns to administrators in order to improve on—campus housing
and facilities.We will soon create a resource guide for off—campus housing with
student ratings of landlords. ln order to improve its efﬁciency, we worked to
restructure Van Call.We put in place an online scholarship guide, a data base
enabling students to easily ﬁnd ﬁnancial aid opportunities.We continued to
review our own constitution, seeking to better the Student Governments
effectiveness. By working for the entire student body, we strove to make your
challenges a little less overwhelming.

This past year, our nation, city and school were challenged by the
horriﬁc terrorist acts of September l lth, 200 l. Many suffered the loss of a
family member or a friend, and the Pitt community lost one of its alumni.
Despite our losses, we met this challenge simply by persevering to ﬁnish our
undergraduate education.Additionally, we provided assistance to the families,
ﬁreﬁghters and police through fundraisers ranging from car washes to blood
drives. Students came together in solidarity for prayer and peace vigils.The
Student Government compiled a log of student thoughts, feelings and
reactions to the events.The log will be placed in Hillman Library.

I would like to thank the Chancellor for his support, SGB advisor
Joyce Giangarlo for her guidance, Donna Mihilik for keeping our ofﬁce in line,
and also everyone in the Ofﬁce of Student Activities. Congratulations to the
graduating Class of 2002.There is no doubt that you will meet the challenges
that face you and ﬁnd success in your future.

Sincerely,

Jeffrey M.Ale><
Student Government President

Relocating

Everything But the
Kitchen Sink

ugust blanketed campus life with the
hottest of heat waves and the return

' to the weekly grind. But before Pitt
students could settle in, they ﬂrst had
to return to their home away from home.

in the weeks before classes started, U-

l-lauls and Ryder trucks popped up throughout
Oakland and the surrounding neighborhoods
like some bizarre garden of orange and yellow
ﬂowers. From above, it must have looked like
a small child was playing a very intense game
of Matchbox cars where allof the imaginary
people needed to drag boxes of dishes and
garbage bags full of clothes up ﬂights and
ﬂights of stairs.The humid August air was

not conducive to trucking up and down, in

and out, back and forth. Sweat, dirt and a lot
of arguing oozed out amongst the closest of

 
   

l.5i:§vci”sity of Pit%::hai:‘gli 2882

friends, but a tiff with best chums was still better
than letting parents help you move.

Fitting eighteen years of life into half of
aTower A dorm room wasn't the easiest thing
in the world to do either Parents and students
roamed campus searching for yellow carts,
asking volunteers (and the occasional stranger)
which way to Sutherland, and ﬁghting the trafﬂc
of families in similar situations. Meeting the
roommate for the ﬂrst time was awkward, with
parents making the occasional embarrassing
remark, but settling in eased once the minivan
pulled away 

...Only to pull back up in eight months
when the entire process went in reverse.

Transportation

"Pith curliqueued routes through Bloomﬁeld and
Lawrenceville, winding around Herron Avenue by

,  Goosl<i’s in Polish Hill and down Penn Avenue
through the Strip District, the 54C was not a bus for the linear-
minded.Though it eventually arrived at the Strip for fresh fruit
and real ethnic food stores, or at the Mattress Factory in the
North Side, it wasn’t without a caveat: by the time it was there,
the gallery opening was winding down, or the market closed for
the afternoon. But not all bus routes were as eccentric as this
one, and often it was easier to take PAT than to ﬁnd the elusive
metered par|<ing space.

Just as strange as the 54C, no image of Pittsburgh
was more ubiquitous than the lncline.The Incline, with its
appearance of a carnival ride for retired tightrope walkers,
climbed Mt. Washington four times an hour, carrying ordinary,

A unastounded people to their jobs. And almost as peculiar, theT
started out as a subway from the basement of downtown’s
largest ofﬁce buildings, and wound its way above ground as
slow and clattery as an old pickup truck into the South Hills,
as circuitous as the 54C.

Even for students who didn’t take public transportation,
the bus lanes gave bicyclists an impromptu route against trafﬁc
on Fifth Avenue. ln warmer months, students on bikes were
everywhere——weaving through trafﬁc or cautiously on the
sidewalk, heading to and from class and work, with their hair
and shirttails caught up by the wind.

“ One of the greatest joys of being a teacher is when you can use your
experience to help a student. Working with the nursing education students has
given me the opportunity to guide students in their chosen ﬁeld. I help them get
jobs, scholarships, and more information about Nursing Education, and once they
are teaching, I help them deal with their difﬂcult students. It's especially gratifying
to see some past students as fellow teachers in the school. In the current job
market, where nurses are in great demand, such a commitment to the education
ﬁeld is commendable. H

“ I enjoy helping students achieve their academic goals, knowing that in the
process I have made a difference in their lives. Over the summer I received a call
from a student who was very upset because she was not sure whether she would
be able to afford to return to Pitt in the fall and was looking for any advice that I
could give to her I had worked closely with this student for several years. She
excelled academically and had been quite involved with campus organizations. ln
the end, the department was able to arrange for her to assist as a grader for a class,
paying her the difference between her tuition bill and what she was able to afford.
She came back to school in the fall and made excellent progress. H

School of Nursing

ost nursing classes consisted of three simple parts —
lectures, labs and clinicals. Nursing students learned,
practiced, and then they ventured into the world of
medicine where they performed.Yet, as any Nursing
student would readily profess, it wasn’t quite as easy as it sounds.

Freshman nursing students poured over their Anatomy and
Physiology books for days upon end. Sophomore year, their
friends were amazed at the te><tbool<s hauled from class to class.
From Pathophysiology, where students studied the disease process,
to Pharmacodynamics, where they learned about the interaction of
different prescription drugs within the human body— the worl<|oad
seemed endlessjunior year offered classes such as Nursing Care for
Mothers, Newborns, and Families; Gerontological Nursing; and Nursing
Care of Clients with Psychiatric Mental Health Problems. Senior year
concluded with a nine—creditTransition Into Professional Nursing, where
students shadowed a working nurse, performing all the same tasks and
orienting themselves into the world of a Registered Nurse.

The courses were demanding and the workload could be
staggering. At the end of the four years, students were rewarded with
a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing and a promising career as
skilled and marketable RNs.And the scrubs were an added bonus.

Calm Before

Summers On Campus

corching 90—degree heat burst in through the
Cathedral’s open windows as students yearned
to be at the beach or pool. Some professors
taught on the lawn, making lectures a bit more
bearable except for the mosquitoes and bumblebees.
Pitt summer classes felt out of place with the smell of
barbecue in the air, the smoldering sun and late night
thunderstorms, but students needed them.

For some, summer classes meant the thrill of
graduating early while others caught up after too many
l5—credit semesters. Internships dominated the daytime
hours of many students while others sought employment
with one of downtown’s many ﬁrms and corporations.

Silence ﬁlled the campus over the summers.
Fewer classes occurred and students out of school spent
their days in their hometowns catching up with friends
and family or vacationing somewhere faraway from the
Steel City Bars still managed to have happening happy
hours. Parties still overtook the streets of South Oakland.

Fun still existed despite e><ams,jobs, and
homework.They sunbathed in Schenley Park.They
participated in the South
Side Street Spectacular
And made their daily
visits to the statuesque
Cathedral of Learning.

“ ln Psychodrama, l was working with five students on an exercise that would lead
them to explore who they are. I asked each, “Who are you?" After asking this question
several times, a young woman who was generally quiet, stood up, and walked towards a
young man who always had an answer or solution for everything. She stood in front of him
and said,“My name is Karen. l am female. I am sensitive and caring. As a person, l have the
right to let you know I want to speak ﬁrst sometimes in this class. I am quiet, but I still have
a lot to say." The young man smiled with love showing on his face.

This was important to me for several reasons. One, a young woman struggling
with her own shyness decided to let a group of strangers understand that she wants to
share her ideas with the class. Second, people who are verbal were made aware that they
should sometimes remain silent so that “quiet ones" might have an opportunity to speak.
Third, students learned indirectly from Karen that you are responsible for letting people
know how you feel and what you want from others. ’ ’

Taking Exams and Writing Papers

he professors passed out the exams while
students bucl<led down with pencils in hand,
ready to go.They only looked like a few
sheets of paper stapled together, yet they
generated immeasurable amounts of stress. Hours of
reading thick te><tbool<s went into answering just one
of those daunting essay questions. Liberal amounts of
coffee were consumed. Libraries stayed open late for
research. Students sacriﬁced precious sleep to hopefully
obtain that “A” and sometimes they realized that

9 ~  as cramming an hour before just wasn't going to cut it.

i J Computers whirred all night with l"licrosoft’s
smiling paper clip icon at the bottom corner of the
screen growing more annoying as the hours ticl<ed on.
The ten—page paper was due promptly at 9 a.m.; page
one not yet complete when midnight encroached. Spell
Check, grammar checl<, one—inch margins, and twelve-
point fonts plagued students as much as preparing for
those multiple choice and short answer questions.

The time was ticking, the keyboard was

waiting, the coffee mugs
were empty, and the
books were piled high.
The bars were empty.
The world, except for
college campuses, was
asleep. Students filled
the library and
computer labs, creating
their own hot spots on
nights like these.

on the job consisted of warming up to the place and people.

After that, professional work revealed the wonderful future

opportunities students could look forward to.

When graduation ﬁnally rolled around, social work

eyes, and raced into the real world.Their degree took them on
a journey to reach out to all kinds of human life. Each day they
leapt at the chance to make a difference in the life of a drug

the rewards showed.

H A cardinal practice principle in professional social work is that every individual has inherent
worth and dignity I often reinforce this message to students by noting that a person cannot lose or
misplace this inherent worth and dignity. She cannot put it aside for awhile. It cannot be stolen.A
person, though, can behave as if she believes one of these things has occurred. In that instance, the
social wor|<er’s task is to help the individual recognize her/his worth and dignity as ever present and
ever ready to be reflected. I often see that this message enables students to engage effectively, even
with individuals whose behavior in a particular situation may seem to defy understanding. ”

” Last year, a group of four BSIS seniors from my C++ programming class came to me
interested in doing a project together. For the project, we decided to build a Web site as an
on—line yearbook for BSIS alumni.The yearbook will not only allow alumni to share memories
of the past years, but also keep in touch with one another: We may depart from one another,
but wherever we go, we can still access the Web site to update our information, and read
about others. Point your browsers to http://www2.sis.pitt.edu/~pwu/BSlS—2002.html and stay
tuned. Students may share the fun of creative project work to put what they learn into
practice.There is a proverb that says: ‘Tell me, and I will surely forget; show me, and maybe I
will remember: Let me do it, and I will understand.’ ”

Approach

Schoolof
Information Sciences

itt’s School of Information Sciences is nationally
ranked. It blends aspects of computer science with
those of business, focusing less on the theoretical and
mathematical aspects of computer science and more on
practical issues in computing. Additionally, it offers majors in
telecommunications and graduate degrees in Library and
Information Science.The IS degree is a two—year program
students applied to in the spring of their sophomore year
Students took classes in graphics, where they
modeled basic three—dimensiona| shapes from scratch using
the programming language C++, and in Internet construction,
in which groups built servers, installed operating systems, and
by the end of the semesteryhad working Web servers.
Between classes, students headed to the fourth floor
for its snack machines and antiquated coffee machine, or sat

outside smoking on the ledges overlooking Bigelow Boulevard.

On the bulletin boards, amid ﬂiers advertising cars for sale or
meetings of the graduate gay & lesbian student association,
hung ﬂiers for doctoral students’ computer usage studies or
information about professional internships for undergrads—
a hint at the opportunities available to those with an
undergraduate degree in Information Sciences.

Where We Study

n Every Nook & Cranny

usic blared while the sweet aroma of
coffee and tea ﬁltered through the air
at Starbucks. Students cuddled up
with their books on the big soft
couches by the fire with espresso in hand.
Coffee kept their tired eyes open while people
hurried in and out, maintaining a sense of
urgency, keeping the atmosphere moving.

Studiers lounged on the couches in the
Red Room of the William Pitt Union while the
sound of the television provided relief from
si|ence.The only noises usually came from a quiet
conversation or a runaway laugh or a Pathﬁnder
making a tour stop.

The sun provided all the light studiers
needed on the Cathedral lawn. On warm days,
they lounged in the green grass, sat on benches,
or leaned against a nearby tree. Between learn-

ing, students tanned, fed the birds and squirrels,
and made sure the wind didn't blow their notes
away People—watching opportunities galore gave
students respite when they needed a study break.

Across the street, students huddled at
tables hidden in ceiling-high stacks of books at
l-lillman Library, as the sound of turning library
cart wheels echoed in their ears.The ground
floor was a studier's paradise, with the smiling
librarians bustling around, computers and copiers
running in full gear and cushiony chairs for
comfort. With a million possibilities, students
found their own havens to study their notes,
read their textbooks, and delve into the
rigorous world of studying.

wo students trekked across campus, one in a
clean, crisp suit and the other in a navy blue skirt
with a matching jacket. They were not headed to
the ofﬁce, but rather: to class. As these students
in the College of Business Administration prepared to
present to their marketing research class, they “dressed
for success,” practicing techniques in their classes that
would carry them far in the competitive world of business.
With the option of majoring in accounting, ﬁnance,
general management, or marketing, the business school
offered a great deal of options. Classes such as intro to
macroeconomics and business calculus paved the
way for a solid foundation while advanced ﬁnancial
accounting and marketing management reﬁned skills.
Students could combine business classes with anything
from communications to political science classes, working
towards a CAS/Business dual major or even earning a

 

certiﬁcate in international business to further broaden
their horizons. All of this prepared business students
to become our managers, sales people, or ﬁnancial

. consultants — our leaders.

Internships launched students in real—life
situations at well—known businesses and corporations.
Mellon and PNC Banks tested ﬁnance skills while
companies such as FreeMarkets presented the
opportunity to create sales proposals. Preparing for
the challenges of graduate school was always another
option, with the Katz school right down the street.

Whether off to grad school or straight into
the work force, CBA students left the University of
Pittsburgh with their Bachelors of Science in Business
Administration, ready to take on the world.

"...students joined professors to support and counsel...”

“Health information management, a department within the School of Health and Rehabilitation
Sciences, has many international students, and some of them were targeted for discrimination after the
terrorist attacks. One student even considered leaving the program to move back to her home. Although
we as faculty urged her to stay, it was other students who made the difference for herThey reinforced that
the discrimination she experienced was not representative of an entire community She decided to stay. l
continue to be impressed by the way in which students joined professors to support and counsel during

this difﬁcult time. ”

“ The reason I teach is simple~it's because of the students. I enjoy their company, and l enjoy
stimulating their intellectual curiosity.They, in turn, ask questions that stimulate me intellectually, and
force me to be a better teacher Before entering academics, I worked in a corporate environment-
rubbing elbows with presidents and CEOs—and I can honestly say that I prefer engaging with
energetic, curious and motivated students.

Former students now working at Accenture or Marconi Communications or Smith Kline
Beechum regularly get back in touch with me. Its a highlight when a student acknowledges how the
classroom experience has equipped him or her to think through and deal with real world issues. If!
can give students a set of tools to help them think clearly and strategically, and be successful at what
they do, l am succeeding at my job. ”

Road to

School of Health
and Rehabilitation Sciences

n the fourth floor lounge of the Forbes Tower,

he squarish orange building in the thick of

Oakland, students chatted about rehabilitation

technology, bowed their heads to their Dietetics
and Nutrition textbooks or mentally went through the
steps of their emergency medicine procedures.The
School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences houses six
focused programs.These range from health information
management to occupational therapy to communication
sciences and disorders.

With white coats and white hairnets, students
stood in the dietetic laboratory, somewhat resembling a
home economics room in a middle school, but these
students weren’t learning to cook; they were learning
about food standards and how to analyze meals for
nutritional content. In the occupational therapy adaptive
learning lab, students helped people learn how to play or
work or take care of themselves after an injury In
addition, students gained clinical experience in more than
550 afﬁliated training sites, including the Center for
Vestibular and Balance Disorders and the Western
Pennsylvania School for Blind
Children.

As if classes and labs and
clinicals weren’t enough, students
could do research at the
Rehabilitation Engineering
Research Center or the Center
for l-learing and Balance, among
others.These students not only
trained to help the people
themselves, they trained to further
develop the technologies used
to help them.

hat time of the year again,

when the registration and

add/drop forms came out in

all of their pink and yellow
glory.That time of the year again, when
the course description booklets arrived
and students frantically combed
through them looking for that one class
they just had to get into next semester.
Throughout campus, students were
seen paging through these oddly sized
newspapers, looking not for news but
rather for Intro to Biopsychology or
Analytical Geometry.

Students found time in their
already busy schedules to attend
dreaded group sessions, and they
competed for the best advising
appointments.Time was of the essence.

of the registration world. Students

Registration

Pink & Yellow Glory

ﬂocked to this old, graying building only
to be greeted by a mi|e—long line
extending far beyond the doors, around
the building and up the street.There
they stood, waiting in anxious
anticipation to claim a seat in one of
the many coveted classes. In majors

like Communications, students rose well
before dawn to be guaranteed a seat in
required classes.

Midterms had barely begun, but
students had to make plans for the
return after winter break. Seniors ﬁlled
out applications for graduation. After all
these years, the time for the ﬁnal
registration ﬁnally came, a concept that
might have been a bit hard to grasp
amidst the uncertain fate of the classes
still under way

A Message from the Chancellor

Congratulations on your graduation from the University of
Pittsburgh. This book, ﬁlled with essays and photos by fellow
students, is meant to keep memories of your Pitt experiences
alive and vibrant. Produced through a partnership among
the Student Government, the Pitt Alumni Association, and
University administration, this volume serves as a keepsake
of impressions for the class of 2002.

The tragic events of September I l, ZOOI have indeli-
bly marked this academic year for all of us. Yet, in the midst
of that unfolding crisis, it was a selfless focus on the needs of
others that characterized our students. In conversations with
me and others, what students most wanted to know was
how they could help. As a student body, and in the proud Pitt
tradition, you pulled together and responded with expressions
of concern and acts of caring. I commend you for moving
forward in the face of tragedy and uncertainty with a re-
newed sense of commitment to civility and community.

As you look to the future, know that you are enter-
ing a world eager for the knowledge, talents, and skills you
developed at the University of Pittsburgh. Some of what
you have achieved will be apparent from your formal
credentials. But many of the truly important talents you
nurtured here are not formally recorded on your diploma:
the ability to analyze problems and think critically, to gather
information using an array of newfound tools, to put yourself
in another person’s shoes, to work in teams, and always to
~ continue learning. These lasting benefits of higher education
will help you grow and lead throughout your life and will pay lasting dividends, for you and for society

As you now move on to pursue new opportunities and meet new challenges, we ask you to remember
that you will always remain part of the University of Pittsburgh. Our e><tended family of alumni can be found in
every state in the United States and in most of the world’s nations. One of the most rewarding ways to nurture
your ties with Pitt is through active participation in our alumni programs, which are rich in mutual benefits for grad-
uates and for the institution. Participation in these programs is one of the best ways to continue building the tal-
ents and skills that are the foundation of your Pitt education.

We hope your alma mater will forever play a part in your life and that you will continue to take part in the
exciting enterprise that is the University of Pittsburgh in the 2 l st century

Local Music

utside the Mr. Roboto Project ll, a small

show space and concert venue in

Will<insburg, l<ids stood around,eating pizza

or vegan Chinese food from down the
block, a few taking the opportunity to smol<e.They may
have been waiting for one of the evening's bands to
ﬁnish setting up and start playing. Or maybe a touring
band got lost on its way, and hadn’t yet arrived.

In a few minutes people headed inside as the
band started warming up, the bassist playing a few
chords to signal that the show was about to start.
Inside, Roboto was small—just large enough to hold a
few bands and their equipment, plus about forty or ﬁfty
show—goers, and a zine library. Around the edge of the
room, silver robot stencils ornament the walls.

Millvale Industrial Theater, Goosl<i's,WPTS’s
annual Birthday Bash, and sometimes the Public Health
Auditorium also provided outlets for local music
without the hassle of bouncers and high ticket prices.
But because so many people were involved in the
collectively run Mr Roboto Project ll, most independent
bands that traveled through Pittsburgh played there.

And because there was no central booking
agent, the show could’ve been anything—rocl< or punl<,
hardcore or experimental jazz, a traveling puppet show
or a beneﬁt held to raise money for a political issue.
Well—l<nown local bands like The Modey Lemon,
Microwaves, and Grand
Buffet (who rapped
about baseball cards and
the secret levels in Mario
l) drew a large audience
and were musical staples
of Mr Roboto, proving
there were alternatives
to Club Laga and
over—2l venues.

tepping into Thirstys in North Oakland,

there was an immediate difference from the

outside wor|d.The Grateful Dead, played by

the deejay in a tie—dye T—shirt on the corner
stage, replaced the soon forgotten noise of Center
Avenues trafﬁc.Thick clouds of cigarette smoke
permeated the air.The poorly lit bar became jam-
packed with people as the night went on, students
mingling in the semi—dark world of Dead Night.

Pitts nightlife was more than just a tucl<ed—
away neighborhood hangout such as Thirstys. Some
preferred frequenting the Strip Districts clubs or one

of the many themed bars on the crowded South Side.

On Thursdays,The Upstage on Forbes hosted 80s
Nights, where hordes of students got down to the
music of their elementary or middle school years.
Many students headed to Antoons to devour a large
cheese pizza for four bucks.Without a doubt, every
student on campus had at one point attended a South
Oakland house party or seen people roaming the

streets trying to find one. However South Oaklands nightlife
scene underwent a few changes in the past year with the
closing of Cl. Barneys in February 200i and then the
Oakland Beehive in May
Students could go out to eat, shoot pool, go

drinking orjust hang out in a friends room when they
needed a break from the stress of school. On this weekend
night, students in Thirstys consumed drinks, smoked countless
cigarettes and held raucous conversations.Twenty minutes
past last call, students flooded the streets, their thoughts far
away from exams and homework.

Annual Jazz Concert

irk Lightsey, the piano man, tapped his foot in a
rhythm all its own, with his toes and heel tapping
and stomping at seemingly different paces.The

trumpeters and saxophonists tapped their whole bodies
like a wave, starting from their toes and traveling up
through their knees, to their hips, to their shoulders, all
the way to the tops of their heads. Crad ling his cherry
red guitar in his arms, Mark Whitﬁeld leaned back, one
foot on the ground, one resting on the stool, moving
his ﬁngers along the frets as if in a trance.

DrummerTeri Lynn Carrington, the lone woman
of the 3 I St Annual Jazz Concert, became the rhythm and
created it all at once. Dreadlocks swung in front of her
face as she set the pace for the men, driving them forward
and back. Abraham Laboriel couldn’t stop dancing with his
partner, the bass guitar”. David Baker sat front and center,
playing his cello, his arm and head swinging wildly back and
forth.The piano man danced across the stage as trumpeter
John Faddis sent the high notes to the ceiling of l-leinz Hall.

From the serious jazz devotees, quiet and focused,
to the excited jazz novices, whispering in amazement to
each other, the whole crowd burst into applause when
trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater played a melodic Ellington
tune.Without awareness, a mass of heads bobbed in
unison and the night hours passed without warning
among Nathan Davis’s all—star ensemble.

Different Tastes

   

 hiffs of chicken curry
 ﬂoated through the air

In the dim lights, students
 ordered dinners of shrimp
vindaloo and chicken til<l<a masala. Rating
the spiciness of each dish on a scale of
|— l O depended on what their taste buds
could handle. India Garden featured half-
priced dinners after I l p.m. while the
sounds of upbeat exotic dance tunes
echoed off the walls.The waiters smiled
as they poured mango shal<es, collected
tips and served rice.

Further down Atwood Street,
quesadillas and burritos delighted the
hungry faces while margaritas and
sangria ﬁlled the glasses. Servers reﬁlled
chips and salsa while students examined
the half-off menu. Music blasted, candles

 

burned, and people squashed together
to be seated at Mad Mex on bustling
Saturday nights.

At Yum Wol< they grabbed their
chopsticks as the green tea steamed.
Appetizers of fried dumplings and
shrimp egg rolls followed dinners of
chicken egg foo young and lemon
chicken. Fortunes arrived at the end.

A student wrapped spaghetti
around the fork as a one—pound
meatball waited anxiously on the plate.
Joe Mama’s meant Italy Ravioli, fettuccine,
pizza! Not just food, but a happening bar
added flavor. Ethnic foods took over the
menus in Oakland.

The O

t was the only restaurant still serving food and crammed full of
people in the middle of the night. lt was the only place where
you could get a small order of fries that was enough to feed a
family of four It was the only spot where you found starving,
destitute students at 3 a.m. devouring fast food or stopping in to grab
a few 40s. It was the Original Hot Dog Shop on the corner of Forbes
and Bouquet, affectionately known to Pitt students as simply “The O."
The O was always full of people greeting friends and ready
to eat, whether it was lunchtime or 2 a.m.The ﬂuorescent neon signs
and painted windows drew everyone’s attention and beckoned
passers—by to stop in.After pushing through the packed entrance, the
bright yellow, red, and orange menus shouted out the various choices
of hot dogs, burgers, subs, pizza, and fries, all offered at dirt cheap
prices. A plethora of aromas filled the air, from the distinctness of the
ever—so—popular fries sizzling in grease behind the counter to the
pizza cooking in the ovens. It was enough to make anyone hungry
Nothing beat relaxing and devouring a foot long hotdog

complete with all the ﬁxins while watching other patrons pump
quarters in the various clinging arcade games, namely Virtual Boxing. It
was an experience every Pitt student will remember long into his or
her alumni years, and “O" what an experience it was.

5 r ush Tri—Sig, S/\E,Tri—Delt!"The
roaring of young Pitt students and
the deafeningly loud hip—hop music
blared from the Quad on a sunny

Friday afternoon. “Meet Pi Lam brothers at Fuel
and Fuddlel”“Join the Ro—Chi groups and meet
all of the sororities at once!” It was the Greek
Watermelon Picnic, an event set up to attract
potential new brothers and sisters to the Pitt
Greek system. Candidates ﬂipped through old
photo albums of frats and sororities at various
events, from building houses for Habitat for

Humanity, to working the amusement rides at

Cedar Point and formals and dances. Greeks
gave out pamphlets detailing the history of each
‘house,’ including statistics of money raised for
charities.With enthusiasm, brothers and sisters
explained the Greek system to students and

 

distributed schedules of rush events like Primanti
Brothers with SAE at 8 p.m. on Friday night and
football on the Cathedral lawn at 2 p.m. with the
Sig Ep brothers.

With shiny pledge pins now safely secured to
shirts, these ‘nu’ members were ready to go through
the next few months of learning about their fraternity
or sorority in Greek lOl,taking part in numerous
charity events like going door—to—door collecting change
for cystic ﬁbrosis and gathering unwanted articles for
clothing drives as well as having a great time getting
to know their brothers and sisters. After these long
but worthwhile months, the pledges could shed those
somewhat tarnished pins and don some pretty cool
looking letters instead.

 hollow eyes of the dinosaurs
stared down at the passers—by
peering up at them.Their tails
 stretched across the room, the
bones held ﬁrmly in place, but giving the
illusion that they might strike out and
knock someone off their feet at any time.
Up the long stone stairway and through
the glass doors, modern masters Van
Gogh, Monet and Matisse hung in majestic
silence. Special exhibits may have come
and gone, but the remnants of Rome and
ancient Egypt have always been here and
probably always will be. Asian and African
exhibits added international diversity to
the Carnegie. l-lands—on activities, such as
in the Discovery Room, provided an
entertaining atmosphere for school—age

children or college students reclaiming
their youth. Pottery and painting classes
gave students the opportunity to test
their own abilities, seel<ing perhaps to be
the next Degas.The Carnegie Cafe’ gave
visitors the opportunity to relax and enjoy
a sandwich and a latte while watching
Pittsburgh life roll by on Forbes Avenue.
These and other areas of the

museum had just as much eye candy to
offer students on a class trip or a curious
Saturday afternoon. From Architecture
Hall to the Carnegie International to Andy
Warhol to Hiroshige, the museum offered
students a rare cultural opportunity close
to home and school.

Dance on the Gateway Clipper.

Once A Year

Homecoming Weekend

  

 he immense heat started it all. Flames jumping,
cheerleaders pumping and the crowd bumping.

 As the bonﬁre sizzled and crackled, fans exuberantly
welcomed the beginning of yet another Pitt Homecoming
weekend. Pathﬁnders were busier than usual when family
members started arriving. Between tours, seminars, special
luncheons and loading up at the Pitt Stop for Panther gear,
there was something for everyone./\s nighttime came, so did
the laserized panther crawling up the Cathedral of Learning
and so did the spectacular ﬁreworks display, delighting
everyone from the awed toddler perched on his big
brother’s shoulders to the alumnus in for the big weekend.

‘Game Day’ came a little too quickly for these
students. Blue and gold radiated everywhere from the fans
right down to the ﬁeld. Elsewhere, bars from the South Side
to Shadyside were loaded with fans toasting drafts to
Antonio Bryant and the rest of the team.

Though the Panthers lost to Syracuse, the
disappointment didn't last long with all that fun to be had.
Even the evacuation of the Quad and Towers due to a Fireworks and laser light show.
bogus Anthrax scare didn't dampen the spirits of these
students. From the parties on frat hill to dancing the night
away under the stars on the Gateway Clipper, homecoming
spirits were in full eﬁ‘ect.As the wee hours of the morning
disappeared and the worn out partiers trel<l<ed home, the
same thought was in everyones’ mind: How come this only
happens once a year?

Hedonism

Spring Break

tudents escaped the gray and frigid Pittsburgh

weather for sunny skies and sandy beaches

during Spring Break. Many students didn't even

have to cross “south of the border" to fulﬁll
their party needs, instead migrating en masse to the
Florida beaches. Panama City Beach, Florida, has
become America's Mecca for Spring Breakers in the
past couple of years as many chose to take the 24-
hour party route. Other Spring Break hot spots
include Cancun, Mexico, the Bahamas and Jamaica.
A state of euphoria descended on most students as
their pale skin transformed into a golden tan after
countless hours out in the sun. Swimwear became
the standard uniform for all. Men and women partied
until the sun came up and slept the day away

Of course, not all could afford trips to
paradise. Alternative Spring Break offered students a
chance to go somewhere out of Pittsburgh and
complete a service project. Other students went
home and watched Spring Breakers go crazy on MTV,
or they stayed on campus and put in extended hours
at their part—time job.
Students came back to
Pitt at the end of the
week feeling refreshed
but anxiously awaiting the
conclusion of the frosty
winter and the arrival of
Pittsburgh’s sunny skies.

id you challenge a professor? Did you rally for your cause? Did you hoot and

holler at the football games? Did you voice your opinions to whomever might

listen? How did you make your impression? Whether you never spoke a word

in class or were the president of the student government board, you left some
piece of yourself with the UniversityYour footsteps, voice, perseverance; it echoed and
resonated.You became part of Pitt's past and part of Pitt’s future.

The future was yours, ours, to create and shape.

We walked on the path where many have walked before, down sidewalks and
hallways, into elevators and stairwells, into and out of classrooms.We walked on a path
towards our future |ife.We were always in motion, forward motion.We pushed buttons
and limits, worked to reﬁne and smooth the rough edges. As much as the University
pushed us into the future, we pushed the University into the future.We impressed
ourselves upon our surroundings.

In return, the University fed our minds, arming us with knowledge and the power‘
to use that know|edge.We came here pursuing skills and information and a piece of
paper.We left with so much more.We left with impressions of who we are and who we
want to be. Pitt will always be our alma mater Pitt is part of what grounds us.

V\/nere will you make your next impression ?

Fall Fest

reen to red. Red to orange. Orange to yellow. Adding to

the color—changing foliage of Pittsburgh was the Fall Fest,

an all—day event in late September sponsored by the Pitt

Program Council. From instantly gaining IOO lbs. for
“sumo" wrestling your roommate, to catapulting into the sky off a
monstrous trampoline, to stuffing your face in pie—eating contests,
students packed in the fun.

Exhausted students could then watch the various
entertainment performances on the massive stage constructed
right in the middle of Bigelow Boulevard. From singing along to
the Red Hot Chili Peppers cover band, Sideview, to breal<~dancing
to the hip—hop beats of the Mind Boxing Alliance, Pitt students
encouraged their fellow peers in the limelight.

As dusl< crept up on the fest, SR—7 l , a punk band famous
for the song “Right Now,” took to the stage.With a packed crowd,
the group gave students at the Fall Fest a great finale./\sl< any
student and they’ll give you a different answer as to their favorite
part of Fall Fest, but all could agree on one thing: lt was nice to be
able to cross Bigelow Boulevard and not fear for your life!

The Commons
Room

Take Another Look

tudents felt it when they entered

through the revolving doors.The

sun disappeared and their eyes

adjusted to the light as they gazed

in awe.Arched, high ceilings
branched out in all directions, representing
the unique paths Pitt students took during
their days at the University

Massive lamps hung down from
the ceiling, casting the dim light for tired
studiers trying to stay awake.Tables,
throne—like chairs, benches, and even
seating attached to pillars reaching down
from the ceiling, gave students plenty of
opportunity for learning and exploring.
Grayish, smoky stone formed the tiny
archways and tunnels with steps leading
visitors into the dark and mysterious
hallways interspersed with Nationality
Rooms. Hidden twisted stairvvells took
curious students up to the second ﬂoor

70

People watched people and took
in the peacefulness ofthe room from the
second and third ﬂoor overlooks.Artists
discovered these areas to be excellent
spots for capturing this memory on paper
or canvas or camera. Voices echoed
through the silent air.The beeping of
elevators ricocheted off the ceilings. Black
tall gates with intricate lacelike patterns
sketched the words,“Here is eternal spring.
For you the very stars of heaven are new."

Passing through the Commons
Room every day, students forgot what they
must have seen on a campus tour or their
ﬁrst day of classes. But as students graduate
and leave this campus, eventually returning
or passing through again, the Commons
Room will again look mysterious and
majestic and new all over again.

tone lions with permanent grins etched upon

their faces stood guard at the entrance to the

peaceful Chinese Room. Bright ﬂoral velvet

walls the color of red roses matched the
velvet chairs around the white, wooden table in the
Austrian room. The carved ceiling of the Russian
Nationality Room depicted the four seasons, with a
ﬂower bud representing spring, a sunﬂower for
summer, grapes for autumn and a pinecone for
winter.Two bronze statues~patriot Sir William
Wallace and freedom ﬁghter Robert the Bruceesat
on the mantel above the stone ﬁreplace in the
Scottish classroom representing the country’s heroic
ﬁght for freedom.The windowed wall in the
Romanian Room allowed the outside light to shine
brightly through, reminiscent of an icon shrine found
in the Orthodox Church. In the Early American
Room, the low ceilings and hanging tin light ﬁxtures
told the story of life in the seventeenth century

Students forgot to notice the details of these
rooms after years of instruction. Instead, they sometimes
grudgingly sat in their meticulously carved and ornate
chairs, impatiently waiting for their class to conclude.
Little did they know that their tuition not only paid for
their education but for a chance to learn about other
countries. Pitt students traveled all around the world
without ever leaving the Cathedral of Learning.

The Honors College

tepping off the elevator, ﬁnally, students made their

way down a narrow ﬂight of stairs, past a window with

a view of the miniature cars and buildings far below, to
the 35th floor of the Cathedral. Opening the heavy metal
door, breaking the precarious balance of pressure, the air

whistled between the cracks in the windows and doors.The l  
letter board behind glass read “Welcome to the Honors * firm
College," and below that, on display were their sponsored C O L L E_

undergraduate literary magazines: The Three Rivers Review,
Collision, and the Undergraduate Review.

Students lounged on the purple couches, reading
selections from a huge bool<shelffil|ed with encyclopedias
and donated bool<s. Students'~papers mixed with the
magazines and newspapers lying well—worn on the large
wooden table as they discussed graduate schools and
Rhodes and Marshall applications with Doc Stewart.

There was always free coffee. Students brewed fresh
coffee in the morning, in the afternoon, and at 3 a.m. while
they studied and the rest of the world slept.The whistling
doors of the Honors College were always open, the
elevator always ready to lift students to the unadorned
white walls and quiet scholarly hum in the air

The Honors College will not look like this for much
longer Renovations scheduled to begin in January 2002 will
combine the 35th and 36th ﬂoors and expand the
conference room, already with a view to rival Mt.
Washington, up one more ﬂoor.The 35th ﬂoor will belong
almost entirely to students, leaving them more space for
applications to be completed, books to be read and, as
always, fresh coffee to brew.

riting home was difficult. How could parents, who
worked 9 to 5 jobs, understand the simple beauty of
taking a real Spanish siesta halfway through the
workday? How could they be expected to picture
the silent and abandoned streets at 3 p.m.? How could an older
brother, who drove his car on concrete highways, even try to
picture what it was like to walk atop cobblestone streets on the
way to class? How could a family whose favorite meal was
hamburgers on the grill know the colorful explosion of paella on
the palate? How could people for whom fast food was a way of
life recognize that some cultures do not even understand what is
meant by ordering coffee “to go?"

In their letters from abroad, students’ words were both
eager and stilted as they tried to describe the exact angle at
which the Leaning Tower of Pisa tipped. An Italian sunset was
somehow different from any other in the world and yet words
could not bring it to life on paper Pictures did no justice to the
enchanting shores of Cardigan Bay, Wales.What must it have been
like to gaze upward at the majestic splendor of the Eiffel Tower, to
hear Parisian voices like music on the streets, to sip perfectly aged
wine at a quiet French cafe?

And how bittersweet it was, gazing out the window on
the ﬂight back to Pittsburgh.Was it possible to be homesick for
"O" fries and yet already miss ﬁsh and chips? Would the streets of
Oakland glimmer differently in
the rain than those of London?
And how could one so joyously
return home and yet still leave
part of her heart abroad?

Semester at Sea

ecoming accustomed to the mores of a foreign country in four

days, just in time to leave, wasn’t an easy task. It wasn't just that

miso soup and palak paneer tasted different, or the roadside

stalls in Malaysia with the whole chickens, skinned and raw, that
swayed inside. It was also visiting Japan, trading the formalities of hello,
how are you, thank you and konichiwa, sayoncira, neither person knowing
the other’s language, but both gleeful to test their words. In Vietnam, it
was the cramped, claustrophobic tunnels in Cu Chi adorned with startled
bats, in which soldiers lived for months on end, their ears continually alert
for the cry of planes in the sky outside.

Even in coffee shops the complexity of when to pay and where
to sit became almost overwhelming. But the Semester at Sea program
was nevertheless an enlightening opportunity to see ten countries in a
hundred days, to learn about non—Western countries both in the ship's
classrooms and in the countries themselves.

And after all this, arriving home in late December, with the
Pittsburgh sky gray and the trees bare, the well known winter sidewalks
were both familiar and foreign. Gone from the ship and from its
passengers, it was difﬁcult to decipher whether the past four months had
been an elaborate daydream, an astounding movie seen idly, unassumingly.
But the experience imparted a permanent sense of de'ja vu.

horizos.Just a few blocks beyond North

Oakland,Walnut Street in Shadyside presented
students with a new array of shopping adven-

tures. Banana Republic, Gap and Express dis-

played the latest seasonal trends in their front
windows. Strawberry pancakes at Pame|a’s made
waking up on a Saturday morning worthwhile.
And Max and Erma's provided a pleasant atmos-

phere for parents’ visits or birthday dinners.

The large trees that lined the narrow
streets in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill were older

than the beautiful, huge houses they hovered

over Families and students lived side—by—side in
Squirrel l-lill's charming homes. Murray Avenue

hummed with activity as patrons shopped in

lthough Fuel and Fuddle and the $9.99
Stocl<room seemed like attractive food
and clothing options as freshmen, the
time eventually came to expand our

kosher delis or browsed the magazine section at
Barnes and Nobles. Coffee at the 6 l C Café assisted
in late night study sessions, and bagels baked fresh
from Panera made for a quick brea|<fast the next
morning. At night, the miniature lights adorning
Forbes Avenue lit the sidewalk as students made their
way home after an evening at the Squirrel Hill Cafe.
At the Waterfront in Homestead, students

purchased essentials at Giant Eagle and Target.They
shared laughs over pool tables and shuffleboard at
Dave and Buster’s and played skee ball and video
games. And sometimes, deciding which movie to see
at Lowe’s Theatre was almost harder than a pop quiz.
The choices were endless; all you needed was a bus
schedule or a car, and Pittsburgh’s diverse cultures
and history were at your fingertips.

students alternate shopping options from the
everyday humdrum of CVS and Eckerd.

Fresh, cheap produce and newly picked
ﬂowers spilled out of baskets and stands on Saturday
morning at the Strip District marl<ets.While bars
such as Tequila Willy’s and Banana Joe's provided
nightlife for the younger crowds, these quaint
markets really gave the Strip its distinct personality.

Perhaps one of the greatest problems to
plague Pitt students was their reluctance to venture
beyond the streets of Oakland. However, with a free
bus ride no more than a few blocks away, there was
no excuse to miss out on the world of food, fun and
culture that could be found right in the
neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.

section, where cheers and chants of seasons
past still ring true, all the way up to the 500

roar of the crowd was deafening — there really
wasn't a bad seat in the house.

It was a house the Panthers made
home. Banners, posters and paraphernalia
announced to visitors and opposing teams that
they had entered Panther country. And they'd
better watch out too — the |2lll Man was alive,
dynamic, and settling quite well into the glorious

he Fitzgerald Field House was alive and pulsating those
nights.Vivacious cheerleaders and the band, on hand with
their strapping voices, pom—poms and a variety of
instruments, provided encouragement for these
heightened ball—handlers. Not to mention all the cat whistles and
shouts of the crowd.With delicate ease, these Pitt women glided up
and down the court, passing back and forth, fal<ing left, then right,
ending with an astonishing jump shot.The scoreboard under the
Home side rose two more points, and it would keep climbing
throughout the night. Players on the bench jumped up in unison to
cheer on their fellow teammates on the court while coaches,
perched on chairs to see above all of the si><—foot beauties,
screamed words of support over the deafening roar of the fans.
These basl<etbal| players came equipped with sports bras
and ponytalls instead of jock straps and Adams apples.Two years
ago, these women made the biggest one-year turn around in the
program's history and earned a berth in the Women's National
Invitational Tournament.

MADNESS

The new Petersen Events Center.

Men’s Basketball

ibrant blue and glistening gold radiated everwvhere

in the Fitzgerald Field House from the wide—eyed

child waving a set of complimentary pom—poms to

the shimmering costumes of the exuberant dance
team to the glare that penetrated off the trombone, as its
owner united with the other band members to belt out Pitt's
ﬁght song. Cheerleaders, equipped with endless smiles and
fake tattoos of blue paw prints, pumped up the packed house
with synchronized moves and cheers. It was Friday night and,
instead of being out perusing Oakland for hopes of a good
party, hoards of Pitt students, alumni and family in town for
Homecoming weekend were lined up bleacher style, whistling
and shouting.The Pitt men's and women’s basketball season
had tipped—off again.

Beginning in 2002, this event will be held in the new
Petersen Events Center. Besides housing a private state—of—
the—art basketball complex, this center will boast a unique
restaurant row, retail stores and a full—service ticket
operations counterThe Petersen Center will host graduation
ceremonies for years to come as well as keep our student
body ﬁt and healthy with modern recreation and ﬁtness
facilities. And with such amenities as courtside suites and the
finest club lounge in college basketball, our Pitt team will feel
as if they are in the NBA, not West Oakland.

As yet another Midnight Madness drew to a close,
fans left the Field House more excited than when they
entered, especially those who took part in shooting contests
and challenges and won various prizes, including official
Panther gear as well as season tickets. It was a start to
another exhilarating season of college basketball and
whether or not you were the starting center or a student or
an alumnus, you all had one thought in mind: Let's go Pitt!

On the way to the NCAA...

KES and Valleys

Women’s Volleyball

er muscular arm reached above her head

as her feet leapt from the ﬂoor She swung

her arm through the air and her ﬁrm hand

slapped the white ball, sending it spinning
over the net.The other team scrambled at the net to
block the ball, but it slipped through their arms, and it
plummeted towards the floor. An opposing player
reached for the ball, but it slipped over her glistening
arm and smacked the blue and gold paint on the floor
panels.The volleyball women jumped up and down,
their ponytails whirling around their smiling faces, and
they patted each other on the back. The ball was
rolled back over to the Pitt side and the fans stomped
their feet and clapped their hands in the stands. Shouts
of praise ﬂoated to our team as they took their
positions for the next serve.

It was all ladies out there on the court at the
Fitzgerald Field l-louse.They stomped, they cheered,
they screamed, and they |<icl<ed some butt. Prior to this
year, volleyball was the only University of Pittsburgh
sport that women had all to themselves.This team was
not only competitive; the players were conﬁdent, and
not just as individuals.Their confidence existed in the
ability and talent of the team.The result was amazing
