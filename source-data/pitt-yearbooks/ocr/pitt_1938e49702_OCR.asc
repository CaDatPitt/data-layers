IT HAS often been said that the
greatest reward a man can receive in life,
is the sincere gratitude and respect of his
fellow—Inen. Fortunate indeed, then, is
the youth entering the Medical profession.‘
In this field of health service, he is offered

an opportunity to devote a lifetime for the ,

beneﬁt of humanity; and through a career
of unselﬁsh work he will be ever inspired
by the plaudits of a grateful nation.

School of Medicine

MEDICAL SCHOOL
ATTAINS HIGH
STANDARDS

Headed by one of the most capable
groups of instructors ever gathered to-
gether, and with ample facilities for lead-
ing students into the latest word and deed
of medical science, the University Medical
School holds an enviable position as a pro-
fessional institution. Located on the cam-
pus of the University, the school prepares
University men for the practice of scientiﬁc
medicine; teaches him medical ethics and

history so that he may fulfill his duty to
the people and understand his obligations
to his fellow practitioners; and leads him
to an understanding of his responsibility
in the support of proper standards and
ideals of medicine. High on the hill in
Pennsylvania Hall, the medical student re-
ceives his first two years of instruction.
Added to this is a well known University
Medical Center which has grown in the
past year by completion of the new Presby-
terian Hospital, by addition of a new wing
to the general University Hospital for use
of the Medical School, and by the erection
of a new Psychiatric Hospital‘ by the State
under special grant on University owned
ground with the agreement that the hos-
pital will be used for teaching purposes.
Further accommodation for the physicians-
to—be is being made ready for next term in
the rejuvenation of the old Mellon In-
stitute.

To these campus facilities are added the
unexcelled quarters of the many Pittsburgh
hospitals,iMercy, St. Francis, Allegheny
General, Magee, Eye and Ear, Children's
and the Tuberculosis League Hospital.
Here the clinical teachings of the third and
DR. CHARLES ZIEGLER, fourth years are carried out with the last

Profextor of 0/zxtetrics word in medical equipment.

IN MEMORIAM

1870 ~ 1938

DR. RALEIGH RUSSELL HUGGINS

DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE

The medical profession has had none more illustrious and de-
voted to service than Dr. Raleigh Russell Huggins. Throughout his
professional life Pittsburgh has been provided with his leadership
as general practitioner, surgeon, medical educator and civic leader.
His guidance as Medical Director and Chief of Gynecological
Service has done much to carry the Elizabeth Steel Magee Memorial
Hospital to the front rank among institutions of its kind in this
country. He was a member of Alpha Omega Alpha, Sigma Xi, the
American Association of Gynecologists, the American Medical As-
sociation, the American College of Surgeons, and the American
Association of Obstetricians, Gynecologists, and Abdominal
Surgeons.

Since his appointment as Dean in 1919, the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine has grown in the courage and persistence
of his leadership so that there is now nearing completion on the
campus a Medical Center the value and importance of which is
beyond computation, the fruition of his hopes and visions. But
another monument equally beﬁtting his generous nature is the deep
respect universally accorded him by his professional colleagues and
the warm, abiding affection of his students.

“Exclusive." That's the shortest, yet Since the founding of the ﬁrst chapter by

most accurate adjective descriptive of this
group. For Alpha Omega Alpha is the
only honorary medical society of its kind
in the United States and Canada. The
standards and aims of the fraternity are
high, and its members are selected from the
higher part of the classes. The purposes of
the society are, the promotion of high edu-
cational standards and research in medical
schools, the encouragement of a ﬁne stand-
ard of character and conduct among medi-
cal students and graduates, and the recog-
nition of outstanding attainment and
achievement in scholarship and medical
practice. Membership is based entirely
upon scholarship and character.

Dr. William Webster Root at the College
of Medicine of the University of Illinois in
1902, the fraternity has grown rapidly un-
til today it has chapters in forty medical
schools of the highest rank throughout the
United States and Canada. The University
chapter, Gamma, was established in 1916,
largely through the efforts of Dr. C. C.
Guthrie. Numbered among the members
of the chapter are many of the most promi-
nent physicians of Pittsburgh and its en-
virons. The group's annual social function
is a banquet which is attended by many
alumni and at which an address is given by
an outstanding member of the medical
profession.

Phi Delta Epsilon, a national medical
fraternity, had its beginning at the
Medical School of Cornell University in
1904. Eight years later, a small group of
active students established Nu chapter at
the University of Pittsburgh. Since then,

to the devotion of the members.

Nu chapter, besides adhering closely to
the high ideals of the national organiza-

give her members every advantage possible
in their professional life. Clinical discus-

ZETA PHI

One of the most active and best known
honorary organizations at the University
is Zeta Phi, national medical fraternity for
women. In Theta chapter, all women in
the School of Medicine ﬁnd ample oppor-
tunity for association both with their
sisters in the school, and with their many
noted alumnae members in the Pittsburgh
District. The fraternity meets about eight
times a year with Dr. Alice Schmitz
Gularski, their alumnae advisor, and with
other alumnae members to hear speakers
and to discuss issues pertinent to the medi-
cal profession. Theta chapter also boasts
of several outstanding women in the medi-
cal profession as honorary members of
Zeta Phi in Dr. Florence Kline, Dr. Susan
R. Offutt, Dr. Ellen]. Patterson and Dr.
Maud L. Menten, who also serves as
faculty advisot.

Outstanding among the many program

116

features of this past year was the second
annual banquet held on October 19 at the
Twentieth Century Club. At this meeting
Dr. Alice Hamilton noted for her work in
the ﬁeld of Industrial Medicine addressed
the group. On the same date, members of
Zeta Phi, cooperating with the Women’s
Medical Association, presented Dr. Hamil-
ton to the Allegheny County Medical As-
sociation. Earlier in the semester, the
doctors-to-be held a tea at the College
Club to bid welcome to incoming freshman
women.

To provide for a few minutes comfort
and relaxation from the rigorous routine
of the medical school, the fraternity also
maintains a room for members at Penn-
sylvania Hall. There can be no doubt that
members of Theta chapter are deserving of
the recognition accorded them as one of
the most active chapters of Zeta Phi.

The future doctors at the University
realize that business can be mixed with
pleasure. They have banded together into
a group known as the Student Medical
Society, whose purpose it is to promote
cooperation among the members of the
different classes of the School of Medicine
and to add to this cooperation, social
activities. Frequent meetings are held dur-
ing the school year, at which various guest
speakers are presented to the group.
Through contact with these speakers, who
are usually men active in the medical pro-
fession, the students are brought in closer
touch with the outside world, and by get-
ting the viewpoints and ideas of the

117

speakers can better understand what they
must be prepared to face after graduation.
The list of speakers this year included Dr.
W. S. McElroy and Dr. Davenport Hooker
who spoke at the Freshman Reception, and
Dr. A. H. Colwell who discussed Socialized
Medicine. In addition to these meetings,
a Medical School Ball is sponsored each
year by the group. The proﬁts from this
dance are put into a loan fund for students
in need of temporary ﬁnancial assistance.
Through its activities the Student Medical
Society has become well known on the
campus, and has made a distinct contribu-
tion to the social and scholastic life of the
entire student body.

IN THE far off lands of primitive
races, scientists have uncovered traces of
crude drugs that heralded the advent of
our modern Pharmaceutical institutions.
History has been richly endowed with the
creations of these scientists, who keep
eternal vigil endeavoring to preach the
cloud of pain and suffering which shrouds
the human race. Every nation pays hum-
ble tribute to the men whose Work is the
merciful alleviation of pain and the com-
pounding of nature’s remedies.

School of Pharmacy

PHARMACY SCHOOL PREPARES STUDENTS
FOR PROFESSIONAL SKILL

The little red schoolhouse of story book
tales still exists, and indeed is even a part
of our own University. For it is in such a
building located on the Blvd. of the Allies
at Pride Street in which the School of
Pharmacy is housed. Here the students are
young men and women working, experi-
menting, and perfecting their knowledge
of remedial solvents. They are people be-
ing equipped with the proper background
for successful careers in the profession of
Pharmacy. In this building there are lab-
oratories for practical training and first-
hand research; a library of about 3,875
volumes, which contain worthwhile and
instructional material of special interest to
Pharmacists; here, too, they have an asso-
ciation that brings them in contact with
the problems of the Pharmacist in the out-
side world, as well as in closer contact with
each other. Yet, there is a similarity to
the red brick schoolhouse for this one has
a garden, but no ﬂowers are raised here.
Instead, a great many species of medicinal

plants are grown, and the students are af-
forded an opportunity to study oﬂicial
drugs from the primary source to the medi-
cinal remedy. And, as in books, the stu-
dents have their play as well as their work.
The American Pharmaceutical Association
has a local student branch, directed entire-
ly by students, which carries out a broad
program of study and entertainment. Dur-
ing the past year the association presented
a series of lectures by outstanding men in
the ﬁeld of Pharmacy, several social affairs,
and a most enjoyable dance at the Pines.
Other social affairs sponsored by the so-
rority and two fraternities of the school
helped to relieve the burden of long hours
of intensive study and laboratory work.

Led by Dean C. Leonard O'Connell, the
school has had a highly successful year.
and climaxed its activities by taking an
active part in the annual Pharmacy Con-
ference which was held in Pittsburgh this
year.

“Boston or else" has been the past year's
motto for the girls of Lambda Kappa
Sigma, women's pharmaceutical fraternity,
because this summer their national conven-
tion, which meets biennially, will take
place in Boston. With Eva Rosenberg as
the promoter, they have planned for a con-
vention excursion and, through raffles,
candy sales, and general economizing, have
saved to make this goal a reality.

Last fall, the Lambda Kappa Sigmas
wasting no time in starting their years
program, had a picnic in North Park on
Registration Day. Later they celebrated
their founder's day at a "Fall Frolic” in
the Hotel Schenley. This, the Delta chap-
ter of Lambda Kappa Sigma, was founded

126

at the University in 1918 by ﬁfteen
students.

Five pledges were formally initiated on
February the tvventy—eighth at a banquet
in the club dining-room of the East Liberty
YWCA. Favors for this affair were minia-
ture dolls dressed in pastel shades.

The group observed Hygeia Day in
March by giving a tea. A medical mission-
ary from China was the guest speaker.

Junior and senior members of the soror-
ity took a trip to Detroit this spring to
visit the laboratories of the Parke Davis
Company. Before closing their program
for the school year, Lambda Kappa Sigma
held two annual affairs, their Spring Swing
in April and the traditional banquet for
seniors late in May.

Among the many other good things that
suffered from the depression were the
members of Kappa Psi fraternity who were
forced to give up their house and publica-
tion of their monthly magazine, Tlae Mark.
But that was way back when, and these
pharmacy students haven’t been idle.
Their first step toward reorganization is
the reviving of The Mark, because they
know that this will bring the alumni into
step with the strong active chapter in
remedying their “houseless" condition.

The boys still ﬁnd time away from their
work and studies to have regular meetings
and to remember their neophytes, pledged
only from the upper third of each class, at
the end of the first freshman semester.
Their initiation week culminates in a
rough initiation at South Park, and the

127

formal initiation banquets are held at
Child's private dining room downtown.

The local chapter, Beta Kappa of Kappa
Psi, also leads in the lighter vein of school
life and has several ﬁne dances on their
social calendar. Their fall dance was held
at Bill Greens and even now the members
are debating whether that club or a country
club should be used for their Spring
Formal. The local chapter is one of fifty-
one chapters established at accredited
pharmacy schools throughout the country.
When, in 1925 the pharmacy and medical
interests parted company, the fraternity
suffered a serious blow. Now, in the 59th
year of Kappa Psi, the graduate and active
chapters are engaged in a unified effort to
reestablish the brothers of scarlet and
cadet gray into a firm, national organiza-
tion.

THE EQUAL opportunity for
education has long been a cherished pre-
cept in our land. In endeavoring to give
a fuller meaning to this ideal, a most sig-
niﬁcant step has been the extension of
higher learning through evening schools.
As a result, the intellectual glories and
practical benefits of a University training
have been placed within the reach of those
who otherwise would be unable to enjoy
them.

EVENING DIVISION EXPANDS
ACADEMIC PROGRAM

 

Miss Frances Beard
Xecretdﬁy af tbe Evening Divixian

Thirty-ﬁve hundred students, men and
women, some specializing in subjects re-
lated to their vocations, others coming to
satisfy avocational interests, all part time
students have found increasing satisfaction
in the program of the evening session.
During the academic year more than two-
hundred and ﬁfty courses were included in
the Division's program, with ﬁve univer-
sity schools, the College, Graduate school,
Business Administration, Engineering and

133

Mines, and Education participating. Fre-
quently electives have been included in
these courses that were not available in the
day session. The excellent facilities of the
day school were also made available to the
members of the Evening Session, giving
Pittsburgh students an unusual opportuni-
ty for doing part time university work on
an accredited basis. Coupled with the at-
tractive schedule is a ﬁrm belief that a stu-
dent has no right to feel that because he is
unable to go to college by the full-time day
route, he must miss the glamor of the extra-
curricular life at college. Therefore the
Evening Division has included a social pro-
gram designed to reach the varied interests
of the entire student body. Beside the
many organizations and fraternities, the
Evening Students’ Association fostered
many features for the whole student body.
The Commons Room aided greatly in the
spirit of fellowship and unity, ﬁrst as a
setting for the Open House during the first
few weeks of the school year, and again for
the traditional carol singing at Christmas.
Throughout the year members were at-
tracted to the seasonal dances by cleverly
entitled “Harvest Festival", “Snow Flake
Hop", “Lion and Lamb Frolic", and
“Spring Prom." The friendships engen-
dered by this program add much to the
attractive schedule of the Evening Students
Division.

Only members in the American Institute
of Banking can register for the AIB courses
offered as a separate division in the School
of Business Administration. Although
AIB is predominantly an educational or-
ganization, it has listed on its schedule
forums, touts, a public relations program,
a separate women’s club, and a social

rogram.

All of the forums were held at dinner
meetings in the William Penn Hotel. Ad-
dressing the ﬁrst of the year's ﬁve forums,
Mr. C. F. Zimmerman, secretary of the
Pennsylvania Banker's Association, dis-
cussed the 44 hour bill and its effect on
banking. The next dinner-forum meeting
featured a talk given by Mr. Philip A.
Benson, first vice president of the American
Bankers Association, in whose honor the
dinner was given. Other outstanding
speakers to address the AIB forum group

135

were: Honorable M. S. Szymczak, member
of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System; Montefort Jones, assistant
dean of the School of Business Administra-
tion; and Lewis E. Pierson, chairman of the
Board of Regents of the Graduate School
of Banking.

AIB carried on an extensive public rela-
tions program by sending speakers out in
the ﬁeld to churches, clubs, and high
schools, to educate the people on the func-
tions of banking.

Outstanding on the social calender was
their formal dinner-dance held in the
William Penn Hotel attracting members of
AIB from all over the state. In addition,
the AIB held four dances for the members
and their families. The Women's Commit-
tee had their own calendar made up of
bridge parties, a spring style show, and a
picnic to close the year.

ALPHA KAPPA PSI

Alpha Kappa Psi, professional commerce
fraternity in the Evening Division, was the
only outside group ever to see the Jones
and Laughlin technicolor ﬁlm on “The
Process of Steel Manufacturing."

This has only been one of the many
interesting trips and speakers which have
been scheduled by Kappa Alpha Psi this
year. One of the members, who is working
in the business under consideration, at-
ranges these trips, not as sight—seeing tours,
but for their informative value. Last year,
trips were taken through Connelley Trade
School, Carnegie-Illinois‘ new strip mill,
and the Commonwealth Trust Co.

Among the outstanding speakers to
address the Alpha Kappa Psi's were Mr.
Clinton S. Golden, regional director of the
Steel Workers’ Organizing Committee, on
“Leadership in Labor Unions"; and John

136

B. Nicklas, discussing “The Judiciary
System."

Featuring the Alpha Kappa Psi social
program was the weekly Wednesday
luncheon held in the downtown Y.M.C.A.
At these affairs topics of the day were dis-
cussed, the conversation being led by an
unrevealed speaker, who conducted these
discussion-lecture forums.

Other social affairs on the program
included a Men's Night with a buffet
supper, ﬂoor show, and bridge at the
Schenley Hotel, and a rushing party held
in the lounge. Mr. john B. Nicklas,
district councilor of Alpha Kappa Psi,
was the principal speaker. This year's
activity was brought to a close by two
banquets, the first held in honor of Mr. C.
C. Shepard, a founder of the local chapter,
and his wife.

After several years of striving toward a
degree in the Evening School, some incen-
tive is needed to encourage the students
toward their far away goal. It is Delta
Mu Delta’s purpose to supply this drive to
the high ranking sophomore students with
a scholastic average of at least 2.0 in the
Evening Division of the school of Business
Administration.

While the honor bestowed upon the
sophomore does not carry much social
activity with it, the Delta Mu Delta fra-
ternity sponsors numerous educational and
professional programs. Meetings were
held in the Cathedral and subjects for dis-

cussion mainly centered around preparing

137

freshmen for membership in the organiza-
tion. Letters were sent to the outstanding
freshmen, who had not yet met the re-
quirements entitling them to membership.
These brought their attention to the
purposes and high aims of the society in
the hope that they would become eligible
for membership in their sophomore year.

In March, the fraternity met at a down-
town restaurant in pursuance of its policy
of choosing an outstanding local business
executive to become an honorary member
in Delta Mu Delta. This was followed by
the annual banquet and initiation held at
the Schenley Hotel at which the newly
inducted members delivered a talk relating
to their daily occupations.

PHI CHI THETA

To promote the cause of higher business
education and training for all women, to
foster high ideals for women in business
careers, and to encourage fraternity and
cooperation among women preparing for
such careers, has been the purpose and aim
of Phi Chi Theta, international commerce
fraternity for women.

All women in the school of Business
Administration are invited to membership.
This year, as in the past, a key was awarded
to the woman in the school who excelled in
scholarship and extra—curricular activities.

This year's program of activity was
headed by the annual National Convention
held for four days in June at the Schenley

Hotel. The social season was opened in
October with a tea held in the Women's
City Club at which the women in the
school of Business Administration were
entertained by Edna Hazlett, a Chartered
Life Underwriter, who spoke on “Woman's
Opportunity in the Insurance Field.”
Before the year ended Phi Chi Theta was
hostess to the women students at two
more teas and at a Monte Carlo Whistwill.

Other social activities of the Phi Chi
Thetas included a Christmas party at one
of the members’ home, a Spring luncheon,
and the Spring Ramble. The most out-
standing of these dinner affairs was the
Founders Day Dinner held at Graystone
Manor.

Women in Evening Session who wish to
enjoy the fuller campus life belong to the
Pitt Women’s Club. This organization is
social in character, its main purpose being
to bring together the women attending
evening classes, and is open to all evening
women students.

Most prominent of the Pitt Women's
Club activities is the lunch service that it
sponsors, the proceeds of which are added
to a scholarship fund. Two scholarships
are offered each semester to two women in
the club who have a high scholarship
average and who are outstanding in school
activities.

This year, Pitt Women's Club, with the
largest membership in its history, spon-
sored many novel affairs. The social pro-

139

gram started in October with a Welcome
Tea and was highlighted each successive
month through June by an unusual affair.
In November the club held a Thanksgiving
party featuring table games and was fol-
lowed in January by a Twelfth Night
Party, held at the Schenley Hotel. Other
outstanding social activities included a
musical featuring the baritone voice of Mr.
Lloyd Mahony, director of the Evening
School, an April Fool’s party, an annual
banquet at the College Club, and a Spring
bridge held on the terrace garden of the
Schenley Hotel. The activities for the year
were concluded with a business meeting
followed by a picnic and the induction of
new oﬂicers.

“EXTRA-CURRICULAR WORK" is the
official title for this section; dance chairmen and
their committee members, the staffs of the publica-
tion, dramatic, and musical groups are all part of
the “key” men in the University.

STUDENT PROJECTS FULFILLED BY SFA

By far the largest and most active organi-
zation on campus, and the one whose poli-
cies have had the greatest effect on student
life is the Student Faculty Association.
This group provides an opportunity for
students and faculty members to work to-
gether on common problems concerning
the life of the student at the University.
The assembly is composed of thirty stu-
dents and ten faculty members, who deter-
mine the policies for the campus, while
several committees of interested and capa-
ble students carry out the issues in many
campus projects.

This year the Association guided by a
highly capable Executive Committee com-
pleted one of the broadest programs since
its inception in 1934. The weekly meet-
ings of the Committee became indispensa-
ble in acting upon the issues laid down by
the Assembly in its monthly meeting, be-
side making ﬁnal selection of chairmen of
the various student functions from the
names recommended by the Appointments
Committee.

Early in the academic year, the organi-
zation concerned itself with the many
problems involved in moving the classes
into the Cathedral of Learning. As a result
of the efforts of the Parking and Trafﬁc
Committee chairmanned by Albert Kairys,
Ruskin Field and the Schenley Plaza were
opened to University students for parking.
Again in regard to lunch room facilities,
the Lounge and Lunchroom Committee
came to a partial solution of the problem
by securing the University Tuck Shop for

students.

143

Added to the many solutions of student
needs were the programs fostered by the
Assembly. Included in the SFA sponsored
programs were the student pep-assembly
prior to the Pitt-Nebraska game, a student
assembly in February when Chancellor
Bowman addressed the group, the Demon-
stration Block where one thousand stu-
dents added greatly to the glamor of a suc-
cessful football year. Regular semi-weekly
meetings sponsored by the SFA Concert
Hours Committee and SFA Forum Com-
mittee brought such celebrities as john
Jacob Niles to the campus providing un-
excelled opportunities for personal and
cultural growth in the form of musicales
and lectures.

MEN’S COUNCIL LEADS THE WAY

Controlling most of the services taken
for granted by University men, Men’s
Council, a comparatively new organiza-
tion, leads the way toward improved
methods of student control.

Among the duties of Men's Council is
the administration of Men's Customs. The
thirteen councilmen assisted by many
campus leaders meet each freshman class
at registration, and start them on a ten
week program of counselors, orientation
groups, and freshman meetings, so that
they may orient the beginners in their new
life. Senior tribunal with its digniﬁed
court ritual is the Men's Council way of
ending the training period. Here one
hundred outstanding freshmen are awarded
special placques for particular progress
made during their training.

A second feature of the Men’s Council
program is the Transfer Student's Smoker
held at the beginning of each semester.
Here upperclassmen, coming from other
schools, are given a chance to make new
friends and become acquainted with Pitt
ways immediately.

The Student Book Exchange is a new—
and one of the best—projects under Men's
Council direction. Until such work was
begun, the lack of a central clearing point
for used student texts was slow and
expensive.

145

As a matter of interest, Men's Council
is a unique organization particularly in its
election methods. At the end of each year,
the members themselves select half the
junior and sophomore men to Council for
the following term. Their claim is that
such a system insures a continuation of
policy, which cannot radically be changed
by the appointment of other members at
the regulation elections in May.

WSGA SUPERVISES

The Women's Self Government Associa-
tion, as general supervisor of all women's
activities at the University, has made Pitt
famous for its competent organization.
Once a month, the doors of Heinz House
close for a WSGA Commission meeting, at
which representatives of every organiza-
tion in which women participate here on
campus, meet and discuss activities prob-
lems.

Welcoming Freshmen into Pitt's campus
life, WSGA sponsors “Mixer Dances" as
one means of aiding the Freshman’s debut
into social activities. Through Customs
Committee, WSGA tests the Frosh‘s
knowledge of University traditions in the
Customs exams. After passing these tests,
proud Freshies discard green armbands for
jaunty blue and gold ones. The Unit
Advisory Council of WSGA includes ten
Freshman units and their upperclass ad-
visors, while WSGA's Housing Board
helps out of town Pittites ﬁnd comfortable
rooming facilities, and provides oppor-
tunities for the newcomers to make friends

with their fellow strangers under the same
roof.

Women's Day Assembly is sponsored by
WSGA in commemoration of the first
women to enroll at the University of Pitts-
burgh in 1895. This year's forty-third
anniversary found the ﬁrst two women
graduates of Pitt, the Misses Margaret and
Stella Stein present at the unveiling of
their pictures, done in charcoal by a later
graduate, Miss Esther Williams. WSGA's
Scholar's Day Tea provides the oppor-
tunity for the lucky tappees to honoraries
and recipients of scholastic awards, to be
congratulated by their fellow students in
the Commons Room of the Cathedral. But
Leader’s Institute winds up a heavy year of
activities for WSGA. Gathered together
in Heinz House, campus leaders chosen for
the following year's activity oﬂices, meet
together for guidance and valuable sug-
gestions from their predecessors. Then
WSGA closes house for the year, leaving a
clean slate for next year’s activity leaders.

CA DANCES ADD TO STUDENT LOAN FUND

Organized for the purpose of providing
funds for student loans, the College Asso-
Ciation permits a student to obtain finan-
cial aid without mortgaging his future.
By means of dances held during the year,
a large Student Loan Fund is maintained
to aid in the payment of tuitions. The
Loan Fund is added to after each dance,
for the proﬁts from them make up the
Fund. Staging one formal and two infor-
mal dances this season, the Association
sets the admission low enough to allow
even those with shoe-string pleasure budg-
ets enjoy campus dances for no more than
a dollar and a half. The CA is noted for
its advertising originality. Stand-out in
evoking enthusiasm for the year was its
publicity for the annual Thanksgiving
dance, paraphrasing a popular song, CA

147

cleverly advertised "Twilight and Tur-
key", offering live gobblers as door prizes.

Leaders of this year's dances were Ted
Whitaker and Ray Light, president and
vice-president respectively. Along with
the twenty other members of the CA, all
drawn from the College proper and equally
representing each class, Whitaker and
Light met several times each month to
debate questions relating to the College.
Not ﬁnding time to include the regular stu-
dent assemblies usually sponsored by the
CA, they worked with that excess energy
on ticket sales for their dances, enlarging
the Fund no little.

Members of the College Association are
elected at regular student elections each
Spring, along with members of SFA and
Men’s Council.

RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS PLANNED BY YWCA

The Young Women's Christian Associa-
tion of the University of Pittsburgh makes
practical application of their principles of
fellowship and the creation of the spirit of
friendship among its members. In the new
Y.W. office on the ground ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, presided over by new executive
secretary, Mrs. Emmet C. Barr, Y members
can be found any hour of the day, planning
conferences and chatting about social
events of the group. Starting out the year's
activities at the Y.W. Hearth Ceremony
held in Heinz House, freshman received
their ﬁrst introduction to the round of ac-
tivities, which characterizes the Univer-
sity’s Y.W. Grouped around Heinz
House's open ﬁreplace, frosh and upper-
class women renew old and new acquaint-
enship and start new ones, in the friendly
give and take of informal conversation.
This ceremony, patterned after a similar
custom of ancient Rome, is the Y.W.'s way
of including the newcomers in the Y pro-
gram, thus making them feel at home, and
at the same time, feel a part of the organ-
ization itself. A Fall Friendship Fry, held
in Schenley Park, further spreads this feel-
ing of informality and participation in the

148

University’s activities. The Upperclass
Clubs really form the nucleus of the Y.W.
These mixed groups meet twice a month
for supper meetings, discussing subjects
ranging from "Marriage Preparation," to
the “Japanese Boycott," their essential
purpose being to further Y comradeships,
and provide social opportunities for its
members to enjoy good times together. In-
quiry Forum, held every Monday noon of
the year, encourages individual participa-
tion in discussions of campus problems and
national affairs, under the leadership of
such speakers as Lieutenant Colonel W. E.
B. Covell, Robert Kleeb, Howard Keater,
and Lyman Hoover. Similarly, the Insti-
tute of Public Affairs discuss local and na-
tional affairs of public interest. Delegates
to the various Intercollegiate Conferences
such as the Middle Atlantic Regional Con-
ference at Eagles Mere, bring back new
ideas and suggestions from other campi to
spur interest in Y members. The annual
picnic in June, held this year at South
Park, winds up Y.W.C.A.'s activities for
the year, and Y members start out for vari-
ous conferences from which to derive in-
spiration for next year’s program.

YMCA WIDENS SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES

In keeping with its traditional policy of
fostering fellowship and spiritual growth
of men on campus, the Young Men's Chris-
tian Organization this year enlarged an
already well-ﬁlled program. The activities
centered around a ﬁve point emphasis that
included within it the major parts of the
Association program. Committees on
Public Affairs, Personal and Cultural
Growth, Religious Emphasis, Social Ac-
tivities, and Community Service organized
within each of the upperclass clubs, were
coordinated in a campus wide program.
Under the guidance of these groups, the
campus played host to many nationally
known personalities. Early in the year
Grace Loucks Elliot, reknowned lecturer
on personal relationships addressed the
members in two seminars. A religious em-
phasis week in February was lead by Dr.
Douglas Horton of Chicago University
and other local leaders in a three day pro-
gram on campus, looking to a renewal of
the basic Christian concepts.

Added to the outstanding programs pre-

149

sented by these committees, were the many
features of the Y program that have be-
come an integral part of campus life. In-
quiry Forum continued its weekly forum
meetings with authorities on dpublic ques-
tions while the regular holi ay worship
services were supplemented with ﬁve ex-
ceptionally ﬁne Lenten Services in the new
Stephen Foster Memorial. The tradition-
ally successful Freshman Camp provided
almost two hundred freshmen and upper-
classmen with a never-to-be-forgotten
experience. Included in the many other
off-campus retreats, conferences and study
groups was the National Student Assembly
at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in
which eight of the Y members joined with
students from all over the world in estab-
lishing the policies for Student Christian
Organizations. The broad social program
that found activity ﬁlling every week of
the school year was completed with a
picnic at South Park, but not before these
energetic students had laid the tracks for
next year's train of events.

Despite the short time since their intro-
duction to Pitt's campus life, the Women's
Debating Association has made an Inter-
collegiate name for itself, among univer-
sities, high schools, and women's clubs.
Through debating and formal discussions,
the Women's Debating team has carried
topics of social and economic interest from
Pitt to other college campi. At Leetsdale,
Schenley and Allderdice High Schools, Pitt
coeds held extension debates, discussing
subjects of high school interest. Discuss-
ing the “National Labor Relations Board,"
the Women's Debating team could be found
this year holding extension debates at Ava-
lon High School, North Side League of
Women Voters, Women's Club of Turtle
Creek, and the Bloomﬁeld and Rodgers
Parent-Teacher Association.

Proving their ability not only on campus
and in neighboring vicinities, the team
toured such campi as Seton Hill, Gettys-
burg, Bucknell, Ohio Wesleyan and A1-

TO DEBATE OR NOT TO DEBATE: THAT IS THE QUESTION

legheny. Up on the last word in debating
tactics, the Debating team broadcast over
a local radio station in February, when
they challenged Penn States’ Women's De-
bating team. Any girl interested in the
Women's Debating group may have a fair
chance to prove her ability. Different girls
are chosen for each debate, thus providing
an opportunity for each girl to debate sev-
eral times a year. But Women's Debating
Association has not only given the campus
a worthy reputation to boast of, but has
been of real service to campus activity lead
ers as well, by publishing a pamphlet
known as “Pitt Pointers on Parliamentary
Procedures." After its first appearance in
activity circles, that booklet was destined
to become an authority, present at all for-
mal meetings, and considered the last word
on meeting procedure. These ambitious
debaters have not only beneﬁted them-
selves but have answered the prayer of
every assembly chairman on campus!

A collective audience of approximately
fifteen thousand people saw the Men's De-
bating Association rise to glory through
clearly reasoned points and eloquent pres-
entation this year. Hitting a new high
in the number of debates given, the terri-
tory covered, and the schools met, the
Freshman and Varsity teams debated four
widely—i-anged subjects; compulsory arbi-
tration for labor, unicameral legislature,
industrial unionism, and an American
League of Nations. Representative of the
prominent schools met this past season are
Southern California, Missouri, Stanford,
North Carolina, Penn State, and Puerto
Rico.

The combined Freshmen and varsity men
took part in seventy-seven debates, the
University being fortiﬁed by the largest
squad in years. The Debating Association
employs all three types of debate~Stand-
ard, Oregon, and Informal Discussion—
and has so impressed judges and listeners
that some of their arguments have been in-

DEBATERS APPEAR BEFORE 15,000 PEOPLE DURING PAST YEAR

cluded in nationally circulated debate
handbooks. The team also succeeded in
garnering for itself two choice invitations
for radio debating. One debate took place
over a local station; the other was at the
special invitation of Doctor Bernard C.
Clausen, and was aired over the well-
known "Town Meeting of the Air."

Debate audiences this year have included
groups ranging from women's clubs and
high school assemblies to business men's
clubs and unemployed citizens’ leagues.
Always seeking to better themselves by
discovering faults in delivery and tech-
nique, the debaters ask candid, anonymous
criticism of their efforts.

This season is generally conceded to have
been the most successful in years. Not
pursuing favorable decisions primarily, the
Men's Debating Association has been re-
warded by kindly audience reception, ex-
cellent recommendations from recognized
debate authorities.

VARIED SPORTS SCHEDULED BY WAA

“Whether it’s cold or whether it’s hot,
we're going to have sports whether or not"
puns the Women’s Athletic Association,
and the new membership campaign started
with a fall outing held at South Park, at
which hot dogs, baked beans, and cookies
were served as refreshments. Later in the
winter, outings were held at Laurel Ridge,
where W.A.A. members and Board went
horseback riding, skiing, and held snow-
ball ﬁghts. Evenings were spent grouped
around the open ﬁreplace, making plans
for the coming year.

Back to school, with the members of
W.A.A. horseback riding, swimming,
dancing, and playing most any game——
basketball, hockey, archery, golf, tennis,
or soccer, while the women's tennis team
of the University of Pittsburgh fared very
well in com eting against Tech, Duquesne,
P.C.W., an Mt. Mercy this year and now
look for new ﬁelds to conquer.

Sponsoring a coed—prom for the Fresh-
man women in October, at the University
Club, the president of W.A.A., Louise
Baughman, furnished the freshmen with a
Clever ﬂoor show, all school talent provid-
ing the entertainment during the inter-
mission. W.A.A. invited every woman on

152

campus to attend a regular Cabaret held at
Heinz House, with the cabaret given in
regular style~candles stuck in beer bottles,
favors as paper hats and whistles, a special
ﬂoor show composed of W.A.A. talent,
and dancing to orchestra recordings.

The traditional Christmas dinner, the
Yuletide Feast, was served in true English
Yuletide fashion—no forks, only candle
light, pork and baked beans, and English
pudding. Dinner began with the tradi-
tional bringing in of the boat's head, fol-
lowed by the carrying in of the yule log
and a dance around the log. Page Roberta
Webb and two cavorting clowns, Betty
Murphy and Grace Bour, provided a
hilarious costume dance for the feasters.

W.A.A. play day for all women of the
University was chairmanned by Mary A.
Weidle, a swimming champ. Members of
the association gave demonstrations in
diving and swimming forms, followed by
novelty races and recreational water games,
in which all the bystanders participated.

Closing their social program for the
year, W.A.A. sponsored their annual
Senior dinner, at which gifts were pre-
sented to the most outstanding Senior
members of the Class of '38.

“A MODERN UNIVERSITY,” ANNOUNCEMENT THEME

Although the new University seal has
been used since September it will be for-
mally introduced in the Senior Class An-
nouncement for 1938. The seal is centered
on the cover of the twenty-seven page an-
nouncement. Embossed in blue and gold
the seal is drawn on a background of either
white roan leather or bound cardboard.
A blue leather thong binds the leather
covered booklet and a blue tassel cord
holds together the cardboard booklet. At
the bottom of the cover, below the seal,
burnished in gold leaf in old English type
are the words, "The Class of 1938. " When
the announcements appear they will verify
chairman Bob Gerrity's report that it was
to be one of the most attractive covers ever
designed by a senior class. In its effort to
edit a booklet that is truly different the

153

committee centered the announcement
around the theme “A Modern University."
Scattered throughout the booklet are four-
teen illustrations of campus life. It was
through the courtesy of the OWL that the
most recent pictures of the Cathedral's
arches, students lolling on the steps of
Stephen Foster Memorial, or the walls of
Lilly Court, or strolling across the cut to
Heinz Chapel were shown in this year's
announcements. The opening page bears
an engraving of the Cathedral of Learning.
Then comes a listing of Senior Week
Events, Senior Committees, Olﬁcers of Ad-
ministration, and candidates for gradua-
tion. Engraved on the last page is the
Alma Mater with an underprint of the
Foster Memorial.

Dressed in their reversible blue and gold
capes and caps, Pitt students appeared for
the first time in a coérdinated formation at
the Duquesne football game. Displaying
colors corresponding to those painted upon
thumb tacks stuck in each seat, and respond-
ing to commands from the ﬁeld transmitted

by a public address system, they formed a
huge gold “P" on a blue background.

rooters contented themselves with a single
letter formation and with cheering the
team on to another victory.

Season ticket holders ﬁnally got a clear
idea of what was happening in Section 17,
however, when Pitt layed Carnegie Tech.
The standard “P" aded into a Carnegie
"C," then back into a “P" of reversed
colors; a grinning Panther face appeared,
then became a Scotty dog; and then a
golden “P" on a blue background.

The striking effects and variety of effects
possible for this SFA brainchild were even
more clearly demonstrated at the Nebraska
game. At half time, thousands of inter-
ested spectators neglected even the famous
band maneuvers to watch the formation of
“P's" and "N's" that ﬂashed from blue to
gold in a twinkling, and then slowly
rolled back to their original color. Seem-
ingly black magic produced an outline of
the state of Pennsylvania, the Cathedral of
Learning, spelled “P-I-T-T,"'and then, as
a grand ﬁnale, drew a golden ear of corn
nestled in its green husk.

To SFA, responsible for the cheering
block project; to Mr. Biddle, to the cheer-
leaders and the section leaders and ﬁnally,
to every one of the seven hundred students
whose coéperation helped build the color
and spirit of the new football cheering
block . . . orchids.

THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT A SOLDIER

Combining military proﬁciency with a
broad program of activities Pitt Riﬂes,
honorary military organization has en-
joyed a highly successful year. Military
excellence, regularity of attendance, and
high scholastic standing demanded of all
members, secure only the more capable men
for the organization. Long hours of close
order drill mark the performances with
snap and precision. The Riﬂemen ably
demonstrated their ability in a parade of
eighty well-trained men before the crowd-
ed stands at the Nebraska football game.
Again at the annual Spring Festival Pa-
rade, the Riﬂemen executed their platoon
movements and silent drill in praiseworthy
fashion.

Although Pitt Riﬂes foster efficiency in
military maneuvers primarily, their pro-
gram for the past year has been well round-
ed with social events. Early in December,
one hundred and forty couples made their
way to the annual military formal at the

155

Twentieth Century Club where in an in-
spiring ritual, retiring Captain jack With-
um and coed captain Irene Maroney turned
over their responsibilities to Captain and
President Albert Kairys and coed captain
Mary Ruth Goodwin. On February 17th
members of the organization spent the eve-
ning at a formal banquet and initiation at
Cathedral Mansions where thirty—four
pledges were taken into the honorary.
Louis Bearer, a Pitt Riﬂes alumnus, acted
as toastmaster with Colonel John Lee
Holcombe, Mr. Endicott A. Batchelder
and Mr. Theodore A. Seidle as featured
speakers. Throughout the year the uni-
formed Riﬂemen were seen carrying out
their duties as oﬂicial ushers at the many
events in the new Stephen Foster Memo-
rial. In May, the strain of annual inspec-
tion was relieved by a picnic and dance for
the new tappees. Such a program of train-
ing and fellowship adds much to University
life.

MAY or September, what difference, it's the time
for making new friends and for keeping the old.
There’s no better place than the Heinz Chapel
walks with their lamp posts and maple trees.

OIL AND GAS GROUP GUIDES ENGINEERS

Guided by a desire to bring the students
of the Oil and Gas department into closer
contact with each other and with the lead-
ers in industry, the Oil and Gas Associa-
tion adds much to the life of men in that
department. The Association, affiliated
with the American Institute of Metallurgi-
cal Mining Engineers, is composed of all
the members of the Petroleum Engineering
and Petroleum Geology divisions which
comprise the Oil and Gas Department. At
its weekly meetings, the organization pre-
sents guest speakers who discuss problems
of importance to the student of mining.
Such subjects as the election of courses,
placement of graduates, and the current
activities of the world affecting the present
and future of the Petroleum Industry are
of chief interest.

During the past year many prominent
men of the Oil and Gas Industry have
spoken to the group. Among these were

Dr. L. C. Nettleton, Geophysicist of Gulf
Research Corporation, who presented sev-
eral interesting phases of geophysical ros-
peering, and Mr. Crockett, head of? the
Personnel and Education Department of
Jones 8: Laughlin Steel Corporation, who
in a series of illustrated lectures, discussed
“What Kind of Men Industry Wants".
Several discussions were led by students
who presented their own experiences in the
oil ﬁelds.

Recognizing a need for better fellowship
among the students of the department, the
Association presented several social activi-
ties during the year, outstanding of which
was a smoker held at the Edgewood Com-
munity Club.

Under capable, intelligent leadership,
the Oil and Gas Association has grown to
a prominent place in the lives of the stu-
dents of Petroleum Engineering.

SPRING COMES TO PITT

For a hilarious four or five days, Pitt
Eds and Coeds throw seriousness to the
wind, stack textbooks in musty corners,
and enter into the gala spirit of the da_v—
Spring Festival week. Opening the affair
with plenty of noise, the band lustily de-
clared their approval of the whole thing
at their band concert in Carnegie Hall.
jammed in shoulder to shoulder, Pittites
whooped up "Hail to Pitt” in concluding
the aﬁair, and collecting both dates and
their doo-dads, headed for the nearest exit
~and food. Next afternoon, slacks and
sport jackets, surrounded snappy skirts and
pert blouses, at the Spring Festival Sport
Dance. Truly jam session in aspect, stags
mobbed fair coeds, and snitched their
‘‘brothers' best gal with the utmost of
glee—and had the time of their lives in the
amazing good humor of Spring Festival
spirit. Carnival Night—the height of
riotous foolishness, the hum of constant
chatter and nonsense exchanged, while
couples drifted from booth to booth, spend-
ing pennies and collecting gay souvenirs.
Purple balloon clutched in one hand, kew-
pie doll and bag of peanuts in the other,

158

we watched the turtle races, screaming
encouragement to our pet—ten cent bet in
the ofﬁng—as it ambled in the opposite
direction from the winning spot. We lost,
as expected, but gaiety unaffected, we
moved on to the next event. Thursday’s
track meet found track men and their fems
all headed for the stadium, steaming up
the hill in the highest of spirits, each con-
ﬁdent that his house would win. Solemn
“tapping ceremony" on Friday morning,
R.O.T.C. Parade immediately afterwards,
then Pittites thronged the streets for the
Women's Fraternity Float Parade~f0l—
lowed by the Men's Sweepstake races.
Spring Festival Ball, Chairmanned by Steve
Rooney, proved the most successful event
of the week's festivities, novel decorations
burlesquing the great loves of history-—
and campus romances. Hats off to co-
chairman, D. C. Schultz and June Greene,
in charge of the events for men and women
—and a very special “hip, hip horray" for
head man of the week, chairman, john
Cheffey—for a week with more amp/9 than
any other in Spring Festival traditions.

E PITT PANTHER
 

  
   

Twelve months of conscientious plan-
ning and working have resulted in this the
1938 OwL. In this period an honest effort
has been made to include within its pages a
true portrayal of the student at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh,~what he sees, what
he does, and in general, those things which
make his four years at Pitt a vital experi-
ence many years after.

To tell this story in the most effective
manner, Editor Idella R. Rome, adapted
a photographic theme With the greatest
number of pictures ever included in an
OWL. Scattered among the various pages
of the book, illustrations of cameras, lenses,
student photographers, and ﬁlm form a
continuous background for photos of cam-
pus life. In this, the 1938 OWL is unique,
the first to use an illustrated theme
throughout the book.

162

THE 1938 OWL

Candid Camera, Eh?

Articles written in an informal and per-
sonal style add to the interest of the book.
Little attempt has been made to delve into
the historic background of fraternities or
the long traditions behind student activi-
ties, but every effort has been expended to
bring out these factors as exempliﬁed in
present student activity. The OwL this
year has also been privileged to include
within its senior section the 1938 graduates
of all professional schools at the Univer-
sity, as well as the many organizations
functioning within the schools.

Added to the many new layouts and
descriptive phrases is a color scheme that
provides a harmony symbolic of the pleas-
ant connotations of University life in-
cluded in the illustrations. Indeed every
effort has been made to provide a true
“Pictorial Record” of the University dur-
ing 1937-38.-

Under Tom Smith, this year's editor,
the Pzmtlver has been ranked among the
leading college publications of the coun-
try. Smith has been responsible for the
predominance of satire and cartoons which
caused the Panther’; ascent to honors. In
recognition of this, Hammer and Coﬂin,
national honorary humor society, has in-

vited the magazine to establish a Pcmt/aer

Chapter at the University.

Through its twenty—five years the Pan-
t/Jer has acquired an intelligent, informed,
critical attitude toward student life and
has based its humor and its information
with this in sight.

The year's issues have introduced new
ideas and new departments, the most popu-

June Greene, fashion editor, selected stu-

in the various issues. The clothes were
generously offered by a downtown depart-

The issues included a Big Apple number
which carried out this idea on the cover.
The Christmas issue included a clever Santa

candy. A special Cap and Gown number,
including scores from the show “Pickets
Please," served the double purpose of a
humor publication and the theatre pro-
gram.

PERHAPS Heinz Chapel as a background provides
the inspiration for these two studious coeds,
as they read Chaucer, or catch up in Econom-
ics, for, although the library is meant for
studying, these steps serve the purpose just as
well when the weather is warm and interest

lags.

With its expressed policy of “providing
a medium for student expression at the Uni-
versity," the News, official student tri-
weekly publication, began the 1937-38
volume with innovations in the form of
the column “Headlines,” “behind the
scenes" news reporting, and a number of
campaigns which have since been adopted
on other college campi. The most out-
standing campaign of the year was the
Wasserman test drive. In addition, the
News made an issue of the use of Foster
Memorial for student functions; probed
the new Hagan athletic plan; supported
S.F.A. in its request to the faculty for a
course in Marriage and Home Making;
challenged a long term leave of absence
given to Dr. Brynjolf Hovde, associate pro-
fessor of history; urged S.F.A. to grant a
charter to the American Student Union;
and helped to sponsor a tuberculin test
campaign.

Four O'clock Deadline!

Deﬁnite proof of student support in such
activities was seen in the results of the
Wasserman test, in which approximately
2,000 students applied to the Student
Health Service for the free tests.

Among current problems raised and
viewed by the News were the approval of
Peace Council’s Anti-Japanese Boycott,
and the inauguration of a series of campus
polls on such subjects as athletic subsidiza-
tion, government policy, unionism, and
special carfare rates for students.

N0 record of the history of the 1937
News would be complete without mention-
ing Editor Leo Koeberlein and his staff.
When a columnists analysis of the Mellon
charitable trust fund was censored, the stu-
dent staffs resigned. The story is only fur-
ther proof of the News desire to print
without censorship or interference, how-
ever, and is as high a compliment to its
integrity as can be found.

Proud indeed are the Senior women who don the stately
cap and gown of Mortar Board, in recognition of their
outstanding leadership and contribution to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh activities life. After three years of
faithful service, worthy Seniors are tapped to this honor-
ary, and during their last year at Pitt, serve as an inspir-
ation to their aspiring undergraduate sisters. Serving as
Senior Mentors to new freshman and with their experience
to guide them, these upperclass women try to impart some
of their enthusiasm to these newcomers, to help them
orient themselves to campus activities, and to the general
“newness" of university life. Mortar Board sponsors
freshman scholarship, ﬁrst by presenting an award to the
freshman woman with the highest scholastic average,
then by reading the freshmen women’s honor roll at
Scholar’s Day. Giving practical application of the ideal
business woman, Mortar Board presented a skit with
members characterizing the various types of undergrads
who usually apply for a job, in comparison with the
perfect business type, as represented by Janet Wilson.
Then campus was sprinkled with Mortar Board members,
equipped with needle and thread, making the white col-
lars used by women on their gowns at graduation. When
honorary aides were needed for the Chancellor's Recep-
tion, Mortar Board members were chosen because of their
poise and graciousness. In November, Mortar Board held
a rummage sale, coming through quite successfully, while
Xmas vacation found them browsing together at a Slum-
ber Party given by their president. With the aid of their
advisors, Miss Rush, Miss McLaughlin, and Dr. Jamison,
Pitt's Mortar Board do much toward integrating the work
of women's activities at the University of Pittsburgh.

Perhaps the greatest honor bestowed upon a college
man is membership in Omicron Delta Kappa, national
honorary activities fraternity. Membership in Omicron
Delta Kappa is open to outstanding Junior and Senior
men who have attained special distinction in at least one
of the following fields: scholarship, publications, ath-
letic prowess, forsenic activities, and general campus
leadership and inﬂuence.

The active program of the campus O.D.K. circle is as
distinctive in nature as the members who participate in
it. The informal atmosphere of luncheons held every
second week affords a splendid opportunity for intimate
and friendly contact between twenty—one active members
and four regularly attending members of the faculty.

First on the O.D.K. list of events was the general tap-
ping held in November. A novel system of tapping was
employed whereby names of the new tappees were posted
on a large O.D.K. key placed at the Fifth Avenue entrance
to the Cathedral. December 8 marked the formal O.D.K.
banquet held at the Faculty Club for the initiation of new
members. All those attending wore blue buttonieres, a
novel custom of long-standing popularity.

This organization is planning to give to the University
Library twenty—ﬁve dollars with which to buy books of
interest to both faculty and students. Each year O.D.K.
nominates a faculty committee to collaborate with the
Dean of Men for the purpose of selecting the outstanding
Senior of the year. A placque designating their selection
is presented to him during Spring Festival Tap Day.
Plans are being formulated to honor those University
graduates who have won the Senior Award by carving
their names in stone along the senior walk.

Cwens, proud of their Anglo-Saxon traditions which name them
the Queens of the University, have gained this heritage through
their qualities of ﬁne leadership, willing service and high scholar-
ship. Distinguished on campus by their colors of silver and garnet,
and by their symbols, the crown and the scepter, Cwens try to pro-
mote their standards among freshman and the other women of the
University, and to be in every way, worthy of their name.

It has become an annual custom for each group of Cwens to pub-
lish a woman's directory and this year was no exception. A few
weeks before Christmas, their little red book again appeared on
campus, and a Cwen with her arms full of red books was a familiar
sight. Publishing the directory was a tedious task, but by that
time, the twenty-nine girls, who were tapped last May, had learned
that being a Cwen meant being a worker. Their work began when
they served as ushers at the Coronation breakfast last spring, since
that time, they have served at the High Tea for Freshman women,
the Chancellor's Reception, a Mortar Board dinner and an Alumnae
luncheon.

The Cwen-Druid Tea Dance this year held at Webster Hall is an
annual project sponsored by both Cwens and Druids (Sophomore
honorary fraternity for men). In December, Pitt Cwens were enter-
tained by their sisters from Tech; and in March they in turn enter-
tained the Tech girls. _

Tap Day found worthy freshmen women receiving Carnations
fastened to a necklace of silver and garnet; then Cwens bid farewell
to their active members at the Cwen formal banquet at which the
tappees became the active Cwens of '39.

Versatility seems to be the watchword of Druids, hon-
orary activities fraternity for Sophomore men. Fostering
leadership, scholarship, and character in extra-curricular
activities and academic studies, the Druids have become
a popular group on our campus. Paramount among quali-
ﬁcations for membership are outstanding work in two or

more major activities and a quality point average of at
least 1.25. 

First among the Druid social events was the annual
smoker held September 22 in the Logan Armory. Here,
Freshmen men were introduced into campus activities
and soon learned the importance of a well-rounded col-
lege career. Among the notable speakers of the evening
were Dr. “jock" Sutherland, Druid alumnus, Dr. Vincent
Lanfear, Dean of Men, and Carl B. Cass, who gave his
ever popular version of “Casey at the Bat". During the Prg J~,',1m; _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ , _ _ _ . _ JACK HOEVELER

ﬁeld by virtue of their tea dances. During the intermis-
sion at the tea dance held February ninth, a single under-
graduate, Albert Lasday, was tapped; also tapped as
honorary members were Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty, Pro-
fessor of Economics, and Dr. Charles G. King, Professor
of Chemistry.

Plans have been made for a general tapping of approxi-
mately ﬁfteen men to Druids in the spring when the pres-
ent sophomore members Will become alumni. Following
the general tapping, a formal initiation and dinner dance
have also been planned.

Where there are a great many pre-legal students on a
campus, it is quite natural that they should organize.

Such was the case in 1921 when the lawyers-to-be were

quick to recognize the beneﬁts that might be derived from 

an active organization that would bring them together

with their mutual problems, and would give them a 
glimpse into their chosen profession. Thus John Marshall

Club was organized under the name of that famous justice  

who made legal history on the bench of the United States
Supreme Court. I

The John Marshall Club started off the past year with
a smoker at the “Y" Club Rooms early in November.
Amid the smoke and the congenial atmosphere, three
new members were tapped into the organization, and H.
Warren Van Kirk addressed the group. This was the
ﬁrst in a series of interesting and valuable meetings held
throughout the year. Professor B. Blackburn of the
University Law School and faculty advisor to the Club
spoke to them on the subject of “Law School,” giving ,%,
the members a taste of what they might expect in that
institution. Following this Leonard Boreman painted a
picture of the “Problems of the Young Lawyer" and
Daniel B. Dixon, a student in the Law School added
“The Student's Idea of the Law School."

All Cap and Gowners, from the ticket sellers and
wardrobe men up to the “girls" and the managers aspire
to this honorary organization, and after two years of
meritorious work, they may be fortunate enough to be

tapped.

Aside from the production itself, the most important
activity of the year was the Halloween Masquerade
Ball held at the Twentieth Century Club on October 29.

The club entertained the entire ’38 production at a
smoker during March where a movie of last year’s show,
“Trailer Hol", was reeled off.

As is the tradition, the Undergraduate Club held a
mammoth banquet after the curtain went down on the
last show of “Pickets Please." Members of the Cap and
Gown Graduate Club were the guests at this joint
banquet.

From the ranks of the club come the prominent con-
tributors to the success of the Cap and Gown shows: the
men who paint scenery, place properties, and apply
make—up; the fellows who spend weeks in erfecting
dance routines and in struggling with the act 0 behaving
like ladies; and the composers of the annual hit lyrics
and tunes.

Tapping of deserving Pitt showmen was held three
times this year. The club’s roster was strengthened at
the Masquerade Ball, before the current show, and on
Spring Tap Day. From this group, eligibles are selected
for membership into the Graduate Club.

Kappa Alpha Phi took the ﬁnal step in the transition
from a professional in commerce to a widely known
active and up and coming social fraternity on the Pitt
campus this past year. It has already made its mark
along with larger activity chapters at the University.

With a social calendar second to none, Kappa Alpha
Phi entertained some twenty times throughout the year.
Tea cups were lifted in tribute to mothers and fathers as
they were entertained by their sons. A very swank for-
mal closed each semester.

In mid year rushing, Kappa Alpha Phi outrushed every
fraternity on the campus with a total of eight pledges.
Her basketball team swept everything before it to ascend
the Intercollegiate-Interfraternity throne and placed high
in the Intramural Tourney. Cap and Gown also selected
outstanding Kappa Alpha Phi men for its production and
cast members.

In spite of an active social program, Kappa Alpha Phi
still maintained its traditionally high scholastic rating.
Kappa Alpha Phi was founded at Georgetown University
in 1920 and the Gamma cha ter was installed here in
1924. The purposes as a pro essional fraternity in com-
merce have been to perpetuate an association among stu-
dents primarily interested in some ﬁeld in commerce, and
to maintain for the beneﬁt of such students a closer rela-
tionship that will better fit them for their chosen
vocations.

One of the greatest honors attainable for students of
the mining school at the University is the Sigma Gamma
Epsilon Senior award. Scholarship and campus activities
together are the bases on which the award is made; it
carries with it the highest commendation for outstanding

work during the past four years, recognized by a national A
professional honorary.

Just as widely sought as its Senior Award is member- 
ship in the fraternity itself. Membership implies not 

only recognition as an outstanding mining man, but also
insures participation and actual beneﬁts in the form of
practical lectures in the ﬁeld of engineering which are
given at their regular meetings. Miners eligible for
admission into Sigma Gamma Epsilon are tapped twice
yearly, at the end of the ﬁrst semester and at Spring Tap

Day. They are formally initiated at a yearly dance at the P"‘~”d””’ - - - - - - - - ‘ - - - - - - -THOMAS MALLOY

With a brief but progressive history of eight colorful
years behind it, Psi chapter of Sigma Tau national hon-
orary engineering fraternity continues to play a vital
part in the lives of university engineers and in the na-
tional organization.

Members are selected from the highest men scholasti-
cally in the junior and senior classes of the two schools
with the qualities of practicality and sociability rating
as top qualiﬁcations.

Sigma Tau was elected on March 2, 1930, to full mem-
bership in the association of College Honor Societies,
thus becoming the seventh member of this association,
and the first Honor Society to be admitted to member-
ship since the organization of the association in 1925.
The members of this association consider scholarship as
the outstanding qualiﬁcation and recognize that other
factors must also be considered. The members of the
organization are: Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Phi Kappa
Phi, Alpha Omega Alpha, Order of the Caif, Tau Beta
Pi, Sigma Tau, and Omicron Delta Kappa. Sigma Tau
is therefore recognized as one of the most important
honor societies in the United States.

Early each year, Sigma Tau awards medals to two
sophomore engineering or mining students who have
attained scholastic excellence during their ﬁrst semester.

Such occasions, as well as tapping ceremonies at the
close of each semester and on Spring Tap Day, are high-
lights in the lives of the engineers, for Sigma Tau rates
as one of the first engineering honoraries.

Holding an enviable position among campus honoraries
is Scabbard and Blade, national military fraternity.
Organized to spread intelligent and authoritative infor-
mation concerning the military requirements of our
country, this organization has become a campus power
through its membership which includes the leaders of
over ﬁve hundred R.O.T.C. men. Most of the ranking
officers are included in its roster, which is made up of
outstanding men in the advanced corps of the R.O.T.C.
at the University.

Aside from its military activity, Scabbard and Blade's
social affairs are well known. Three formal dances a year
are held: one in the fall, one in January, and the last in
the spring. Official tapping ceremonies are conducted at
the first two dances as well as at Tap Day Assembly. The
ﬁnal spring formal is reserved for election and installation
of new oﬂicers.

After each tapping, initiation of the new members
begins. No story of Scabbard and Blade is complete
without mention of this famous WeCk—the inspections,
the drills, the guard details and the final “rough initia-
tion" at South Park which must precede formal initia-
tion.

For the quality of its membership, its high position in
campus affairs, and the acknowledged spirit of friendship
and cooperation which it encourages, Scabbard and Blade
deserves particular commendation.

The highest honor for a Bizad student is to make Beta
Gamma Sigma, honorary business administration fra-
ternity. Activities of this organization are limited to
four dinner meetings a year celebrating the election and
initiation of eligible candidates. Their yearly activity
schedule is rather unique, a senior election early in the
first semester and a junior election during the second
semester, each election meeting preceded by a luncheon
at the Schenley Hotel.

Following the formal acceptance by the senior tap-
pees, an initiation consisting only of the reading of the
ritual and the presentation of keys and certiﬁcates is
held. However, the year’s fun comes in after the junior
initiation at a banquet given for the new members of
both semesters. At this banquet assemble all the district
alumni and the Bizad profs. Each initiate has to deliver
a short speech on a subject relevant to ﬁnance, business,
or the like; all speeches subject to the elders’ criticism.

Perhaps the most noteworthy activity of Beta Gamma
Sigma. is the awarding of a certificate of distinction to the
highest ranking member of the Freshman class.

Membership in this honorary is limited to those rank-
ing highest scholastically among the first ten per cent
of the senior class and to those among the first two per
cent of the junior class.

Three actives who do not appear in the group picture

are: William P. Dietz, David B. Hussey, and Charles W.

One of the most outstanding honoraries in the College,
Pi Tau Phi, recognizes students for high scholastic
achievement and also for participation in student activi-
ties. Quite in keeping with their high requirements, they
planned monthly programs this year, which would in-
clude lectures given by faculty members of the various
departments in the College. Dr. B.  Hovde, of the
History department, spoke on “Social History," while

Dr. Samuel William explained to the group his concep- I
tion of the term “culture." Dr. P. F. Jones, of the P
English department chose "Languages” as his subject, 
and stressed the advantages of everyday application of

clear, concise speech. Working with graduate students 

who aided him in the discovery of Vitamin C, Dr. C. G.
King was well prepared to discuss Vitamins and their
importance in our daily menu. By way of diversion from
serious subjects, Dr. Johnson vividly described his own
archaeological excavations while in Montana. Notwith-

One of the most interesting stories of any fraternity
lies behind the organization of Delta Delta Lambda.

Not for its members were old Greek mottos. Instead, the 

letters forming its name were gotten from the initials of A

the name of their faculty advisor, D. D. Lessenberry. A
The Cathedral chapter was officially recognized by the

University in 1935. It was organized to encourage and  

recognize scholarship among undergraduates in the
ﬁeld of commmercial education, to promote closer rela-
tionships between the faculty, the student body, and
teachers in schools in the Pittsburgh district, as well as
foster a social spirit among its members. Since it was
named the "Cathedral" chapter, the pins have distinctive
silhouettes of the Cathedral of Learning as guards.

This organization taps biennually in the fall and in the
spring, with a 1.7 quality point average required as the
minimum for entrance consideration.

During the past year, the fraternity had Bishop Brown,

 

head of the Retail Training Bureau, as guest speaker at a
I R s - I

Sigma Kappa Phi, honorary foreign language fra-
ternity, swung into campus activities early in December
under their new prexy, Hazel Ehrler. Monthly dinner
meetings draw this group together and part of the
program is devoted to hearing a lecture on some topic of
common interest. Choosing their speakers from the
University faculty, and other prominent speakers in the
vicinity, Sigma Kappa Phi members selected Dr. W. H.
Shelton, head of modern language department, as the
leader for the first meeting. He entertained the group
with a novel account of the Nationality Rooms in the
Cathedral, elaborating on the French Room in particular.
November found Reverend Barry of Carnegie, describing
to envious Sigma Kappas a glorious account of his trip
to Europe. Dr. J. F. L. Raschen, of the modern language
department, was featured speaker of the December meet-
ing, and the group learned of the great German writer,
Goethe, from Dr. Raschen’s illustrated lecture. January
initiation presented the Sigma Kappas with seven new
members chosen for their outstanding abilities in French,
German, Latin or Spanish. Then William Coover enter-
tained the entire membership with a delightful program
of vocal selections in various languages. Dr. Johnson of
the Classics Department contributed his share of the
year's unusual program by discussing the Ancient non
Indo-European languages of Asia Minor. April's warm
weather found the Sigma Kappas heading an Open House
at Heinz House, where each nationality group presented
a skit. Each year on Scholars Day, Sigma Kappa Phi
awards four scholarships to the four most outstanding
seniors with foreign language majors; then again in
spring, the fraternity taps outstanding foreign language
students to their membership.

Carrying on the spirit of its founders, Chi Rho Nu,
honorary pre-medical fraternity has made the past year
an exceptionally active one in celebration of the ﬁfteenth
anniversary of its founding. Since 1923 when the Chiron
Club was first established on campus, this organization

has attempted to sustain the ﬁrst enthusiasm of the pre-

 medical student and to acquaint him with the various
 phases of medical training and professional life.

Throughout the year a series of luncheons were given

NU by prominent physicians. Among the outstanding speak-

ers were Doctor Metzgar, head of the State Medical
Board of Examiners, Doctor Chalfant and others. Led
by President George E. Spencer and an active executive
board, the group, realizing the greater beneﬁts to be
derived from personal contact with the medical environ-
ment, planned several trips. The members were permitted
to visit and inspect the Mayview Sanitarium, the new
Allegheny General, and other hospitals. Special privi-

As the Cathedral of Learning has inﬂuenced the
growth of the University, so has Kappa Phi Kappa in—
ﬂuenced the course of education. Kappa Phi Kappa is a
professional education fraternity, the purpose of which
is to promote the cause of education by encouraging men
of sound moral character and recognized ability to en-
gage in the study of its principles and problems. The
fraternity is professional as well as honorary in scope——
professional because it invites to membership only men
interested in education, and honorary because it chooses
men who stand high scholastically.

The national fraternity, consisting at present of forty-
seven chapters throughout the nation, was founded in
1922. Tau Chapter at the University was established
May 21, 1926, through the efforts of eighteen under-
graduates and six members of the faculty. Admission
into Kappa Phi Kappa is open only to men of good char-
acter in the School of Education, who have met deﬁnite
scholarship requirements.

This year, as in other years, before the Spring and Fall
initiations, a smoker was held to acquaint the neophytes
with the members of the fraternity. Shortly after the
smoker the organization held the initiation banquet-
the most important affair of the year. Quite often during
the year, guest speakers were invited to dinners and
luncheons. These gatherings created among the broth-
ers of the fraternity, the desire for social contact, scho-
lastic achievement, and professional attainment. Plans
have been fulﬁlled to hold an annual spring dance in
May at which time, the newly elected oﬂicers are to be
inducted into the chapter offices.

Through the efforts of its members, Tau Chapter, like
the Cathedral of Learning, is endeavoring to contribute
to the growth of the University and to education in
general.

Quite the “intelligentsia” of Pitt's literary circles,
Quill Club has acquired quite a reputation for knowing
the “ins and outs” of the writing game. Evidence of
their writing skill can be found in the original manu-
scripts which each member submits for criticism at their

monthly meetings. The group then argues the pro's and 
cons of its literary value, while its author sits by in
silence. Any student of the University may attend these 

meetings, and join with the rest of the members in the
fun. This year's Quill Club members set a precedent in
publishing the faurneymmz, a literary magazine, twice a
year, instead of once a year as previously presented.
Poems, short stories, feature articles—any literary con-
tribution submitted by any University student, is con-
sidered for this publication. This year's first semester ‘ 
journeyman even included a series of photographic selec-

tions by Philip C. Elliott, of the Fine Arts Department.
Occasionally some campus or outside speaker addresses
Quill Club members on a subject of literary interest.

Representatives from high school publications through-
out Pittsburgh attended an assembly planned especially
for them by members of Xylon, honorary journalism
fraternity for women, from the staffs of University pub-
lications, the OWL, Panther, or Pitt News. Each high
school represented submitted a copy of their paper. For
the best publication, a cup was awarded at the assembly
which was held on Xylon Day, May the thirteenth.

Each year, Xylon sponsors several forums which any
woman working on University publications or interested
in journalism may attend. This year two forums were
held; the first in November, featuring Miss Maxine
Christensen, who spoke on the subject of "Women’s
Place in University Publications." Miss Christensen, as
a Pitt graduate, is secretary to Robert X. Graham, head
of the University News Service, and served on publica-
tions while a student at the University.

At the same forum, four new members were tapped-
Miss Christensen (to honorary membership), Marion
Conn, Dorothy Davis, and Charlotte Levy. These tap-
pees were initiated later in the month at a supper meeting
held at Heinz House, with graduate, Irene Matveak, as
guest speaker.

Former Pitt students now working in department store
advertising, Misses Marjorie and Gertrude Reich, were
the speakers for the second forum~the former a Xylon
alumnae.

All of the former prexics attended an alumnae home-
coming banquet on March the ninth at which. a Xylon
bulletin was distributed.

After the Tap Day exercises, new tappees were intro-
duced to the active members of the fraternity at an
initiation banquet late in May, which concluded Xylon's
activities for the year.

Originating in 1919 from a series of biology seminars,
Quax today is an organization which combines true in-
terest with research for women science majors. It is a
far cry from the day when Thaw Hall served as the meet-
ing place for Dr. Griffen’s lectures to the present meeting
rooms of Quax in the Cathedral of Learning; so, too, has
there been a great change in the prestige and reputation
of this organization. On Scholar’s Day, when the presi-
dent announces: "For Quax, women’s honorary science
fraternity, I enter these names into the Book of Scholars,"
the new tappees feel that a real honor has been bestowed
upon them. Membership in Quax is extended only to
those who have a genuine interest in one of the sciences.

This organization is unique in combining both the
active and alumnae groups so that all members may con-
tinually be informed. Too, the annual “project" of
Quax is an extraordinary undertaking for an honorary.
Each year, some subject—skin dermatology, this year——
is thoroughly studied. The work is not only interesting,
but useful as well. It gives valuable information to the
members, which they may find useful in applying for a
job through the bureau started by the Alumnae—another
worthwhile custom of the members of Quax.

Although Pi Lambda Theta is an honorary educational
fraternity for women in the University, who have fin-
ished or are completing their practice teaching, they are
not prevented from having some of the outstanding social
events of the year. For their monthly dinner meetings
all the members of Pi Lambda Theta show up, teachers
from all over the county and embryo teachers still in
school. Speakers such as Mr. Stanley Goldman and Dr.
James Rule were guests at these meetings. Traditionally,

during the Christmas holidays, Pi Lambda Theta enter-

preceding years this Christmas they gave a play and party
at the University Club and entertained about one hundred
girls. Then, for active members they had a luncheon
and musical program at teacher's institute. Twice a
year, in June and January, Pi Lambda Theta, taps women
who have proved outstanding scholastically and whom
they feel they would like to have represent the teaching
profession. Following the tapping comes tea and pledg-
ing at the College Club. In May they combined with
Phi Delta Kappa, men’s honorary educational fraternity,
for an affair in Webster Hall. Approximately one hun-
dred teachers throughout the Pittsburgh district are
members of Pi Lambda Theta, and they have all upheld
the aims of maintaining high standards of training and
fellowship in the teaching profession.

DRAMATISTS COMPLETE
HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL
SEASON

When the Pitt Players moved into
their new ofﬁces in Room 1617 it didn't
take the future Hepburns and Gables long
to find them, for Mr. Carl Cass had “Fresh
Fields" ready for a November showing.
This gave the Players an early chance to
try out the new little theater of Stephen
Foster Memorial. Then, even before ﬁnal
production of “Fresh Fields", Mr. Buell
Whitehill, the new assistant director from
West Virginia, had try outs for the familiar
play “Ceiling Zero”. The technical staff
furnished one of the best sets that has ever

Oh, To Be a Leading Man!

193

been used for a school play. From the
Pittsburgh airlines were borrowed helmets,
suits, uniforms, parachutes, radio receiver,
and transmitters. Everything on the stage
was the “real thing", even to the air
hostess’ caps. Perhaps it was the play,
perhaps the leading lady, the set, or the
matinee performance but anyway, “Ceil-
ing Zero" had one of the best crowds in
years. Not to let other organizations on
campus get ahead of them, Pitt Players had
a tea dance at the Schenley in March, and
in true players fashion they entertained
with their own talent, trios, piano solos,
and impersonations. A new field was en-
tered when a group of the players went
down to KDKA and auditioned “The Two
Orphans", and an old fashioned “melo-
dramer". There weren’t any immediate
results, but who knows=~Pitt Players may
yet be giving a series of radio plays! As
a climax to a successful season, the last
production of Pitt Players was the popular
“Accent on Youth", again given in Foster
Memorial.

“CEILING ZERO” ZOOMS TO SUCCESS

Pitt Players’ second show, a drama of
airplanes and airways by Frank Wood,
marked a particularly noteworthy advance-
ment, produced under the direction of Buell
Whitehill, English instructor and new
assistant director of the Players. It also
had one of the most realistic stage settings
used at the University.

By the use of borrowed equipment the
“Ceiling Zero” set became the operations
office of a transcontinental airline ﬁrm.
Flying suits, goggles, parachutes, tele-
phones and switchboards, teletype ma-
chines and radio equipment were all used
to copy exactly the ofﬁce of the Newark,
New Jersey airport. The Army Flying
Contingent or the County Airport, the
Pennsylvania Central Airlines, the Trans-
continental and Western Airlines and the
Bell Telephone Company all cooperated
with Properties Manager, Ione Williams,
in producing a realistic background for a
well—eXecuted show.

Peggy McGee and August Hoffman were
the romantic leads, and Earl Riley played

the part of Dizzy Davis in this play which
was so successful on the screen. jack
Withum and Austin Hay, as Jack Lee and
“Texas" Clark, gave a ﬁne interpretation
of the characters of the hardboiled, quick-
thinking airport superintendent and the
easy going southerner they respectively
portrayed.

“FRESH F IELDS” PRESENTED
BY THE PLAYERS

Besides being the first English comedy
presented by the Pitt Players in a good
many years, Frey/9 Field; by Ivor Novello
had the double distinction of being the
Players’ ﬁrst show of the year, and also of
being the first University dramatic pro—
duction to be given in the theater of the
Stephen Foster Memorial.

Written in a light, airy style, Frey/9 Fieldx
is the story of a rich Australian family of
low social standing, and a poor London
family whose social rating is excellent.
The clashing contrast of good and bad
manners and the ridiculous situations aris-
ing when a sophisticate and an average
commonplace person meet, make Fresb
Fields an adequate piece of writing.

From the standpoint of good acting
under skillful direction, Frexb Field; proved
an equal success. Ione Williams and Helen
Akerman were very effective as the English
sisters, Lady Lilian and Lady Mary.
William Hoeveler was well-cast in the
other starring role as young Tim.

The casting and coaching work was done
by Carl Cass, assistant professor of English,
who rates high commendation for the
smooth job he performed in producing
Frerb Field: for the audiences crowding
Foster Memorial November 3 and 4, 1937.

How About Looking This Way, Babushka (Babe)?

CAP AND GOWNERS PRESENT “PICKETS, PLEASE!”

 

The Little King Is Stopped

Times are bad in the little kingdom of
Asphixia. Dictator Bellini and his Min-
ister of Propaganda, Billy Snirk have found
that the Treasury can no longer support the
undeclared war-for-proﬁt which they are
waging against the neighboring kingdom,
Holstein. Their only resource is to force
the handsome prince Rodney to marry the
old maid Queen of Holstein. Switched
brides, strikes of the army, and the navy,
international spies, women cabinet mem-
bers, munitions plots and useless League of
Nations meetings are all part of the plot
which dodges through the six scenes to
eventually circumvent the villian and
smooth the way to a “and—they-lived-
happily-ever-after-ending’ '.

Julianne and Her Prince
Charming

Picket; Plmxe is the production of two
members of the class of 1938 Robert Saffron
and Nick Spanos, their second major con-
tribution to Cap and Gown. Past audi-
ences will remember the show produced
from their 1936 librette Out for The Count.

Responsibility for the last four shows
has been delegated to Gene Kelly. Since
1933, when he ﬁgured as one of the princi-
pals, he has been intimately connected
with Cap and Gown. Since moving from

the cast to the director’s box, he has super-
vised Out far The Count, In the Soup, Trailer
Ho, and the present Picket: Plum.’ He is
incidentally, a member of the Chicago As-
sociation of Dancing Masters, the Ameri-
can Society of Dancing Teachers, and the
American Federation of Actors, for in addi-
tion to his work on Cap and Gown he has
his own dancing studios in Squirrel Hill
and in Johnstown.

OPENS AT NIXON

For the second time in as many years,
Carl B. Cass, assistant professor of English
has been selected as cast director. The
popular instructor of “Casey at the
Bat" fame ﬁrst played in stock companies
in Minneapolis and St. Paul, then played
character roles for the Goodman Theatre
of Chicago. For a time, he was the direc-
tor of radio programs for a St. Paul broad-
casting studio——then Pitt, where he has
earned his reputation as a maker of char-
acter actors, from the hundred and one

different people in his Pitt Player shows
to Bellini, the roaring Dictator of Pit/my
Plezm. Some of the best of his choices
were Dante Dalle-Tezze, the varsity foot-
ball star who became Bellini, the brazen-
voiced dictator; Earl Riley as Sullivan, the
man who could unionize even a group of
professors; Bill and Jack Hoeveler as the
chorus girl-publicity director combination
and William Murray and Sidney Shore,
who became the Twaddle Twins the clever-
est spies in the secret service.

The hands of the director are gracefully
raised; suddenly they swing downward,
and seventy well-trained, male voices re-
spond. Through melody after melody they
follow these hands and as the program is
ended the thrilled audience shouts a tre-
mendous approval. Encore after encore is
called, and then another concert of the
Men's Glee Club is over.

Reknowned as the oldest non-athletic
activity on campus, the Glee Club has com-
pleted its forty-eighth year of musical
achievement at Pitt. In this time the in-
creased acclaim rendered to the group each
year has been justified by an increase in
variety and quality of the organization's
programs. Early in the year the formally
attired songsters provided the musical
background at the Chancellor's Reception.
Then, during the week prior to the Christ-
mas holidays, the grou appeared in the
Commons Room to lea the student body
in Caroling. Later, in the rich surround-
ings of the new Foster Memorial, the Club
presented its Annual Home Concert which
aroused so much favorable comment from
those who heard it. And, as its ﬁnal ac-
tivity, the group made its annual tour of
the Eastern United States. Each program,
better than the preceding one, the Glee
Club is always striving for improvement,
as much for the pleasure of it as for the pur-
pose of holding concerts. Ranking among
the ten leading college Glee clubs of the
country, the Men's Glee club is definitely
an attribute to the University.

Sweet as a Song

WOMEN’S CHORAL

“We’re singing our way through col-
lege” might well be the theme song of the
University Women’s Choral. For every
Monday and Wednesday afternoons, the
girls of this organization meet with their
directoress, Mrs. Fred Lissfelt to practice
for public appearances. Doing their share
of making the Freshman feel at home, early
in the fall, Women’s Choral combined with
Women’s Debating Association and pro-
vided a studio party, the Beaux Arts, to
entertain the Frosh. Supplying the Univer-
sity with music for all occasions Women's
Choral sang at YWCA service, and on
Easter and Thanksgiving programs, be-
sides participating in Religious Emphasis
Week. At Xmas time, they helped put the
Yuletide spirit into the Commons Room,
by Caroling there, together with the Men’s
Glee Club. All year the girls worked hard
and practiced long, tedious hours in prep-
aration for their annual Spring Concert on

But it's not all work and no play with
these chorusters. Besides practices, they
sing together at private dinner parties held
several times during the semester. The
first dinner at which they bid farewell to
their former directoress, Mrs. Robert
Ayars, was distinctly autumnal in atmos-
phere, decorations and favors. At another,
they tossed ﬂulfy white snowballs about at
a Snowball Party, while on Washington’s
Birthday, red hatchets predominated as
the decorations. Then on May 18,
Women’s Choral members donned spring
formals and attended their Spring Banquet,
in celebration of the completion of a busy
but successful year.

UNIVERSITY CI-IIMES

Mr. Russell Wickman,
Univemity Organist

 

Chimes Mark the Close of
Class Hours

As much a part of the Cathedral as the Gothic arches, our chimes
mark the end of each class hour with digniﬁed, subdued music-
Installed during September, 1936, they have since become symbolic
of the Cathedral—at once reﬁned and quiet, yet as alive and insistent
as the spirit of the students.

Each of the chimes is made of ﬁve piano steel wires, whose vibra-
tions when sounded are picked up electrically and then broadcast
through R.C.A. speakers installed in each classroom. Class periods,
all ending on the half hour, are closed by chimes in a combination
of eight notes~the exactly reproduced tones of Westminster Cathed-
ral's half hour chimes.

Flooding the Commons Room with melody, the Cathedral organ,
played by Russell Wickman, blends with the notes of the chimes
twice daily. Fifteen minutes before the morning and the afternoon
classes, Mr. Wickman, a composer in his own right, and the organist
of Shadyside Presbyterian Church, begins a program of hymns which
continues until classes convene.

If you prefer organ music to swing music, make a point of waiting
for Mr. Wickman. His place is at the console of the Hammond
electric on the second ﬂoor directly above the main entrance, and
the “music" comes out here “through the speakers in the elevator
lobby on the third ﬂoor.

UNIVERSITY ORCHESTRA

Recognized for its outstanding perform-
ances rather than for its position as a cam-
pus activity, the University Symphony
Orchestra provides University men and
women with a rare opportunity for train-
ing and recreation. Through the untiring
efforts of Mr. Theodore Finney and the
faithful, conscientious work of the ﬁfty
members, a group of students with varied
musical backgrounds have been molded
into an orchestra whose efforts have been
well received on many occasions.

During the year, the group has found
many occasions to move from its regular
Thursday evening meetings into concert
halls throughout Western Pennsylvania.
In their many trips, they made concert ap-
pearances at the Stowe Township High
School Auditorium and before a large au-
dience in Uniontown. On April 13, the
University Symphony moved into the

Stephen Foster Memorial for the annual I

home concert. Soloists on this program

 

205

were Harry Goldby who played the
Mozart Pianoforte Concerto in D Minor,
and Mildred Gardner who received wide
acclaim for her rendition of the Beethoven
“Romanza" for violin and orchestra.

The University Trio composed of Bob
Brown, Harry Goldby, and Mildred Gard-
ner, through their numerous appearances,
have become an integral part of student
activity at the University. Beside many
off-campus performances the medodies of
the trio were part of numerous assemblies
in the Foster Memorial.

The numerous behind-the-scenes tasks
were faithfully executed this year by Stan-
ley Ambrose and Clyde Courtwright man-
ager and assistant manager, while Bob
Flocken carried the responsibilities of or-
chestra librarian.

Thus ﬁfty students found both pleasure
and profitable training in working with
the University Symphony Orchestra.

We live in deeds, not years;
in thoughts, not breaths;

In feelings, not in figures on a dial.

Life is but a means unto an end; that end,

Beginning, mean, and end to all things——God.

150 STRONG——THE BAND

Big Apple or William Tell Overture—it
makes no difference to the Pitt band.
During the past year this versatile aggre-
gation of musicians has added many fea-
tures to an already long list of accomplish-
ment.

The novelty and variety of their per-
formances has been the talk of many
thousands who have been fortunate enough
to witness them. Starting with the sea-
son's first football game, these one hundred
and twenty men sent out a hearty “Hello”
that was re-echoed throughout the season.
Their intricate maneuvers were carried to
New York for the Fordham game and to
Morgantown, West Virginia, where ap-
preciative audiences were lavish with their
acclaim. Next, a classic rendition of the
Big Apple brought the fans to their feet at
the Pitt—Nebraska game, and, at the last
home game, the marching season was
climaxed with the appearance of one
hundred and ﬁfty uniformed bandsmen, the
largest marching band ever placed in the
field.

206

Not content to rest on its laurels from
the football season, this organization went
on to new conquests, carrying its spirited
music to the Pitt—Penn State basketball
game, and adding to the thrills of past
performance by appearing on ice skates at
the Pitt-Tech hockey game. The concert
band of about ﬁfty talented musicians
received wide acclaim for its many splen-
did performances both in the high schools
of Allegheny County vicinity and on its
annual tour from Erie north to Buffalo and
back to the Annual Home Concert in
Pittsburgh.

The perfection displayed in executing
the most complicated maneuvers and in
earning their musical reputation attests
not only to the ability of Major K. P.
Flagg as drill coach, and of Mr. Theodore
Finney as musical director, but also to the
spirit with which the Pitt men have
entered into the long hours of drill and
practice necessary to such performances.
Our hats are off to the Band~one of the
outstanding representatives of life at Pitt.

PANI-IEL COUNCIL PILOTS WOMEN’S FRATERNITIES
THROUGH SUCCESSFUL YEAR

As friendly rivals, representative upperclassmen from
every woman's fraternity on campus comprise Panhellenic
Council, and iron out all the perplexities of rushing and
other fraternity problems. Since the first women’s fraternity
was established on this campus, thirty years ago, fraternal-
ism has grown until the men are hard put to keep up with
the higher standards women have set for them.

Welcomed to the traditional Panhellenic Freshman
Reception, the frosh made their debut into the friendly
atmosphere of the women's fraternity world. Dressed in
formal attire, upperclasswomen made them feel at home,
then whisked them through the receiving line, introducing
them to Betty Neubrand, Panhel prexy; Vivien Roberts,
social chairman; and renewed their acquaintanceship with
Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, Dean of Women, Miss Helen P.
Rush and Miss Mary Frances McLaughlin, assistant deans
of women. Panhel's fall rushing calendar permits one day
of entertainment, so a tea usually beckons the rushee, where
Corsages, group singing, and refreshments are in order.

December witnesses the Interfraternity Sing, when each
fraternity presents a “skit" in competition for the loving
cup. Amidst a bewildering selection of Indian camp scenes,
negro spiritualists, and art schools, Zeta Tau Alpha won for
the second consecutive year.

One of the Panhellenic mass meetings for fraternity

210

women featured a song contest, with the winning one to
become the oﬂicial Panhellenic song.

Extending hospitality to the transfers, Panhel sponsored
an informal tea for them in the fall, thus helping them to
make friends with the fraternity women of Pitt. In prepara-
tion for spring rushing, which is an important period under
the University’s policy of deferred rushing, Panhel, through
its fraternity representatives explained the “ins and outs"
of fraternity life to the frosh, in an effort to make their
choices easier. Then rushing started, a three day round of
formal banquets, kid parties, teas, and what not, when
eligible rushees made their ﬁrst appearance at women’s
fraternity houses.

Signs of Spring, brought signs of fraternity women giv-
ing the campus “smoothies" some worried moments until
they were asked to the annual Panhel Ball at the William
Penn Hotel. With Vivien Roberts and her ﬁance leading
the grand march, the others stepped in line to the usual
“Hail to Pitt" chorus. Last year's calendar of Panhel
events, was climaxed by the Interfraternity Float Parade.
With comic strip titles as their theme, Little Abner, Tarzan,
and the Katzenjammer Kids balanced on borrowed
trucks, as they precariously passed by the judges’ stand and
completed Panhel activities for the year.

ALPHA DELTA PI

Quite the hustlers, these ADPi's, who are kept bustling from place to place starting
new chapters. Dashing off to the University of Akron, ﬁve Pitt ADPi's attended the
installation of the new chapter Beta Tau, at Akron. Spending a glorious three days
there, entertained at luncheons, teas and dinners by their new sisters, they also had the
honor of meeting their national oﬂicers from the Pacific Coast. The other new chapter
ADPi established at University of Macon, Mercer, Georgia, makes a total of fifty-
seven chapters now in existence. More than one ADPi got “all stuck up" at the
Taffy Pull given the actives by the pledges, in February, but that only added to the
general gaiety and fun of the party. Another party, this time at Betty A1ston’s
home, barely gave the ADPi's time to exclaim “the best time ever" before they were
busy entertaining Mrs. Stanard, editor of the Adelphezm, the ADPi quarterly magazine.
But the ADPi’s didn’t run any risks of being caught in the Xmas rush of dances and
parties, by choosing early December for their dance at Legion Hall. Outstanding in
fall rushing activities, the ADPi's received the largest number of pledges of any group
on campus, adding six girls to their group. Numbering Choral's Vice-President, Helen
Kulik, among their sisters, the ADPi’s boast another outstanding soror in Margie

ALPHA EPSILON PHI

The AEPhi's seem to be thinking in terms of orange blossoms this year, since
Selma Horowitz, a sophomore, surprised them with her marriage during Xmas
vacation. Ruth Ruben, also a sophomore, (the sophomores seem to have a monopoly)
took her marriage vows, then honeymooned in Florida, while Muriel Lowy announced
her engagement in February. Opening the year's activities with a rummage sale in
the East End district, the AEPhi's had a riotous time indeed with several of their
customers. The most amusing was a junk dealer who was haggling for an old suit of
clothes. The girls wouldn't go down a dime and he wouldn’t go up! But you have
guessed it, his persistence ﬁnally won the day, and the price went down to his original
offer——but it was fun! During January, the active and alumnae chapters gave a tea
at the William Penn Hotel, in honor of the national honorary members, Mrs. Friend
and Mrs. Hannah G. Solomon, while Mrs. Maroin one of the charter members of
AEPhi from Barnard College, was also a guest of honor. Leah Hirsch, not only repre-
senting the AEPhi’s in Panhel Council, and treasurer of that group, can also be found
interviewing applicants for dance chairmanships on SFA appointments committee.
AEPhi is also represented on the Pitt New! by Dorothy Davis as society editor and
a member of Xylon. In November the AEPhi's gave a bridge at the Schenley Hotel
to raise funds for the National AEPhi’s scholarship fund—used to help deserving
refugee women get an American College education—and raised one hundred dollars.
Xmas vacation found the AEPhi's “winter formal” at the William Penn Hotel. A
cocktail before the dance was accompanied by an Escort Index for each couple,
patterned on the Panther student Index, which caused a lot of razzing and good
natured banter.

BETA PHI ALPHA

The Beta Phi's are “right up there" in National Panhellenic affairs, and this
year as Chairman of the National Panhellenic Convention, Beta Phi played hostess
to the other representatives of the fraternity world, who collected from all over the
country. All this happened in October, and Eta chapter was further honored by a
visit from National Alumnae Secretary, Mrs. Vera Wolford, who stopped off at Pitt,
while on her way home from the Convention. A rummage sale in November, proved
something new and different to the Beta Phi’s, where they Certainly had some new
experiences and showed surprising talent, for amateurs, in merchandising and selling.
Busily collecting money for the Mary Gordon Holway Scholarship Fund, Beta Phi
actives joined the Alumnae in sponsoring a benefit bridge, with great success reward-
ing their efforts. The wintry months soon rolled around to the annual Christmas
dance in December, this year held at the Dormont, New Century Club. Mary Quinn,
chairman of the affair, soon set the right pace, by introducing “the Big Apple,"
which soon proved the main attraction of the evening. Fraternity activities finally
winding up, spring weather caused Convention plans to occupy most of the Beta
Phi’s thoughts, so prexy, jean Slack, and vice-president, Mary Quinn, collected their
belongings and started out for Blue Ridge, North Carolina. They were particularly
thrilled, for this year, they would not only renew acquaintances with other “sisters"
from all parts of the United States, but they also would meet some of the 1909 co—eds
who founded Beta Phi Alpha at the University of California in Berkeley.

BETA SIGMA OMICRON

“They're really in the know” about fraternity affairs, these Beta Sigs, who boast
the president of Panhellenic Council, Betty Neubrand, among their sisters. Home
rushing rules, restrictions, and Panhel news are no mysteries to these representatives
of the Pitt fraternity world. Much to their disgust, the Beta Sigs had to use artiﬁcial
snow, and cotton snow balls as stage effects for their Christmas party, since Pittsburgh
just didn't come through with the real thing—all this in honor of Beta Sig's redhead,
Maryetta MacKenzie, who celebrated her twentieth birthday on Christmas Day.
With the ass word, "Big Shots Only," muttered to a pledge (whose head suddenly
appeared mm a package chute), actives entered the side door into a miniature Monte
Carlo for their Valentine party this year. Receipts were raked in with a back scratch-
er, and while worrying about the next bet, Beta Sigs sipped punch from frosty cock-
tail glasses. By the end of the evening, all but three Beta Sigs clutched large I.O.U. 's,
but Doris Bauer walked off with the evening’s prize—an Atlas Bank! Having worked
up quite an appetite from this exhaustive betting, the Beta Sig gamblers then retired
to easy chairs, and were served sundaes, tea, and cunning heart and diamond shaped
cookies. Cheated all winter long of their sleigh party, because of the absence of
snow, disappointed Beta Sigs still mourn the unexplored hills of New Kensington.
But Beta Sigs haven't lost out on chocolates, since Ruth Belle Strothers presented
them with the traditional ﬁve pounds, when announcing her engagement to Robert
Fearon of Texas. Theater partying at the Nixon during the reign of Victarm Regina,
starring Helen Hayes, the Beta Sigs then enjoyed themselves at the post-exam dance
the Alumnae gave for them, that they're still hunting for another. Perhaps they’ll
get another too~next year!

CHI OMEGA

“Quality not quantity,” emphasizes the Chi Omega's at Pitt, and needless to say,
that is what they get. No longer homeless, the Chi O’s are the happy possessors of
a lovely apartment at 510 Neville Street, and most any day ﬁnds several Chi O's
headed for that street, there to putter around, thrilled to pieces with their new home.
Their fully equipped kitchen is still quite a novelty to them, and ever so often a Chi
Omega turns up with a shiny new tea pot or a bright red coffee strainerﬂjust for the
fun of it. Monday afternoon ﬁnds many a Chi Omega pouring over a cook book and
turning out a perfect salad or a delicious batch of spaghetti. Cooking seems only a
minor accomplishment compared with the other Chi Omega projects. Conforming
to a national policy, local chapter, Phi Beta, each year awards a prize to the most
deserving sociology student, selected by Dr. M. Elmer, head of the Sociology depart-
ment. Further applauding Pitt students to greater efforts, the group also awards
an economic prize to the student recommended by Dr. M. McKay of the Economics
department. The Chi Omega’s carry on another national activity by presenting a
gold medal every year to the woman in the United States who has contributed most
to her ﬁeld of work. Chi Omega has thus honored such outstanding personages as
Frances Perkins, Dr. Alice Hamilton, and Katherine Cornell. But never be it said
that the Chi Omega’s neglect their social calendar; first the Penn State Chi O’s were
royally entertained in November following the Penn State game. Then celebrating
the housewarming of their new apartment, Chi Omega's toasted marshmallows and
popped corn, but there were more surprises in store for them as they drew toy autos,
tool sets, and "cutie" dolls from the grab bag at their Xmas party. Chi Omega's
lastly entertained Helen Gordon, Chi Omega from Knoxville, Tennessee, for a week,
before closing the beloved apartment for the summer vacation.

DELTA DELTA DELTA

What with the nearest house on the campus, and a nice supply of campus favorites,
it's no wonder the Tri-Delts are well known at Pitt. Then, too, we ﬁnd them “doub-
lin' up" with PiKA’s—the prexies of both houses always seen together. Celebrating
their ﬁftieth anniversary on Thanksgiving Eve, the Tri-Delts had plenty to be thank-
ful for, and quite took the College Club over in their merry-making. Hallowe'en
found them out “spooﬁn’ the spooks" at a hilarious masquerade party at their house.
One couple really took the cake—Marion Conn dressed as a timid little ROTC lad~
her six-foot escort providing a hefty co-ed captain! Snow and blistering winds blew
in the annual Tri-Delr otphan's party of December, with Sally Brunson doing the
honors as old St. Nick—red suit, beard, sleigh bells and all—a jolly Santa indeed,
who delighted twelve wistful youngsters with his marvelous gifts. But the William
Penn was the background for the Winter Formal. Here, the girls’ shimmering satins
and suave velvets, mingled with the black and white attire of their escorts under the
soft lights of the Italian Room. Victrola dances at the house with buffet suppers
served~luncheon for members twice a month—and occasional Sunday evening spreads
at which some outside speaker usually presides furnish many opportunities for the
Tri-Delts to have glorious times together. June will ﬁnd the Tri-Delr Spring Formal
held at the Shannopin Country Club, while the National Convention this year will
be in Boston, birthplace of Delta Delta Delta.

DELTA PHI EPSILON

Victory parties after every football game, started the D Phi E’s off on this year's
social round with a bang, and they've had parties ever since, at least twice a month.
Prexy, Marion Mehlman, entertained the chapter with several weekend parties at
her home where the D Phi E sisters had some glorious times together. Winter nights
found the D Phi E's theater bound, the Loew's Penn proving the main attraction
and there, seated together with their escorts, exchanging wisecracks on the picture's
deﬁciencies, the sorors spent many hilarious evenings of fun. Bill Green’s featured
the D Phi E’s winter formal in December, the much publicized “surprise" favors
turning out to be boxes of tiny multi-colored hard candies. St. Valentine’s day found
them playing charades at their apartment, in true party spirit. These D Phi E's
certainly get around, boasting four weddings and two blessed events in the past
semester, while last year's Regina, Minerva Reiter, is engaged to be married. Funny
how these fraternity girls go for the professional men—Florence Siegel with a secret
passion for the medical profession, while Helen Ruth Gladstone has developed a
sudden interest in dentistry. The D Phi E's have their share of the “intellegentia,"
with Florence Hiller as active comptroller for the '38 OWL. A “P. J. " party in October
revealed the D Phi E's sauntering around their apartment in various states of attire,
exchanging last minute gossip, and taking life easy, in the friendly atmosphere of
sisterly banter. Honoring their senior graduates at a formal luncheon, D Phi E's
presented them with lovely compacts, crested with the fraternity seal. National
Convention time~and D Phi E's brushed up on their chapter's accomplishments
before setting out for New York, to impress their out-of-town sisters.

DELTA ZETA

A social step ahead of the other frats, the Delta Zetas opened their social program
in August, with an informal dance at Bill Green’s. September's meeting found prexy,
Lucille Uptegraff, announcing a tea for Delta Zeta mothers at the apartment, followed
soon by a Founder's Day Banquet, at which Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant Dean of
Women at Pitt and an alumna Delta Zeta, spoke to the fraternity in the Blue Room
of the William Penn. A visit from National Field Counsellor, Miss Augusta Piatte
of Alabama, resulted in a series of dinners, luncheons, and teas to entertain that
charming lady with the Southern drawl. Then Delta Zeta Mothers and Dads met
and discussed “daughter and her problems” over the bridge tables at WilmaJackson's
in December, while said daughters were enjoying Wednesday night "dates." Stand-
ard meetings found each Delta Zeta checking up on her good and bad points, and
asking sisterly advice in correcting the latter. The Delta Zeta Christmas party differed
from the other frat celebrations, in that the Christmas exchange included gifts for
Vest, Kentucky mountain social service project. Quite ingenious these Delta Zetas,
who continued their policy of doing things differently, by holding their Christmas
formal in an entirely new setting—the Jackson Hotel. January's first meeting found
the Delta Zeta's selecting their resolutions for the New Yearﬁamong them a promise
to aid the Mothers with their dessert bridge held at the apartment in February.
Having won honorable mention for their skit, “Love is Enough" in the Interfraternity
Sing Contest, the Delta Zeta's are aiming even higher for next year, intent on making
their lamp burn brighter than ever.

KAPPA ALPHA THETA

Quite the Pitt socialites, the Thetas came through with a real debutante this year,
when Helen Mar Stevenson made her debut at the University Club. Tapped Co-ed
Colonel of the ROTC, Thrysa Agness Amos also heads W.S.G.A. and rules campus
activities with an iron hand. Entertained by the SAE's at a supper dance, the Theta’s
worked 03 their social obligations by inviting them to a tea dance, their new radio-
Victrola “subbing" for a swing band. Crawling through a window into the spooky
cellar of the Theta house, visitors to the Hallowe'en party, screamed in terror as
ghostly ﬁgures ﬂitted by them, cold hands grasped their clothes, and clammy ropes
brushed their faces, before they could gain the safety of the ﬁrst ﬂoor. An alumnae
party in November found the Thetas having their fortunes told by a young seer
strangely resembling Judy George, while others of their group played bingo and
bowling games. Christmas vacation brought more social affairs; first, a chapter party
with Theta sisters exchanging ﬁfty—cent gifts, and then the Mothers’ Club entertained
their daughters, who again received presents—this time from Santa's huge red sock.
A surprise visit from Grand Treasurer, Mrs. Athern, would have stumped most
fraternities, but the Thetas carried off the situation very nicely by entertaining their
visitor at a charming tea. Pajamas of every color, shape, and size smuggled into the
Theta house announced the Slumber party in January with a bull session lasting all
night, and several bridge games in process left the Theta’s with little time to sleep
that night. The Senior luncheon winds up Theta activities for the year, and Theta
delegates jaunt off to Convention, proud of their chapter's record for the year.

KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA

Engagements are in the air of the Kappa house, wedding refrains fairly haunt the
place while Mary Jane Beachler and Esther Conlin think of their Lehigh ﬁances, and
Vivien Roberts dreams of her Princeton graduate. Marjory Watson foxed them all
by marrying a New Yorker, and now posts her address from sunny Florida. October
found tiny navy and light blue ribbons decorating gold Kappa keys, celebrating
Founder's Day, while visitors to the pledge dance in November received quite a
welcome as each couple was announced over the P. A. systems, accompanied by
choice bits of identiﬁcation. Xmas vacation brought another party, with Yuletide
spirit ﬁlling the house with the spicy fragrance of pine and holly, topping it all with
a lovely tree. Grouped around the tree in the candlelight, Kappa sisters exchanged
gifts and crazy verses amid shouts of laughter, razzing and good natured quibbling.
Then the Kappas caught the “Mothers’ Club Bug" ﬂoating around the campus in
the best of fraternity circles, and giving a tea for their Mothers, urged organization
for the “good of all concerned." It was most successful, and the Mothers gave a
Beneﬁt Bridge in March as their first project—and congrats for its success. Promoting
good old Panhel spirit, the Kappas attended a dance given them by friendly Thetas——
then a sudden visit from Kappa’s National Field Secretary Marion Handy, put them
all on their mettle. Came May, and talk centered about the Spring Formal held at
the Field Club, 'til a busy year ended, and Kappa delegates packed their bags and
dashed off to National Convention at Hot Springs, Virginia.

PHI MU

Saturdays are just Saturdays to most of us, but they're red letter days to the Phi
Mu’s with celebrations after every football game. The day Duquesne bowed the knee
to the Panthers, the Phi Mu's gathered at Ann McAfee's and had an informal spread;
the next week found them dining formally at June Shaffer's. After the Notre Dame
game, the King Edward was the setting for a Phi Mu party, while the next Saturday
found them dancing at another soror's home. An Alumnae Bridge at which the actives
served as aides, broke the Saturday monopoly temporarily, but the following week
found a Phi Mu buffet supper dance, with several ﬁrst string football heroes present
to add atmosphere. Home for Christmas vacation, several Duke sisters and alumnae
were entertained at a luncheon, where comparisons of schools fell fast and thick,
each group loyal to their own, and no casualties reported. Webster Hall housed the
Winter Formal, where Phi Mu’s and their sweethearts danced in the newly decorated
Blue Room of the Hotel. February brought a Valentine party at the home of Dorothy
Marshﬁeld. Here a treasure hunt, limited to the boundaries of the house, started a
riotous search for clues, until after the treasure was found, the weary searchers settled
in easy chairs and played “Woo-Woo"—a new game which claims as the winner, the
man who makes the best public proposal after three tries. Entertained at a dinner by
Phi Mu patrons, Mr. and Mrs. Engelder, and a visit from National Rushing chairman,
Miss Emma Bald Reed, put them on their toes for national inspection. Pledging over,
the Phi Mu's tore the last sheet from the social calendar for the year, and closed the
books {or three months of glorious vacation.

PHI SIGMA SIGMA

Delighted with their new home in the King Edward Apartments, the Phi Sigs held
their first ribbon services there in January. Receiving honorable mention for their
“Cleopatra" skit in the Interfrat Sing Contest, the Phi Sigs adopted the idea from
Emil Ludwig's book T/ae Nile; in keeping with the Sphinx head of their pin and the
pyramid background of Egypt. February issue of their magazine T/ac Sphinx, scooped
the OwL, featuring Phi Sig Idella Rome, editor of Pitt’s '38 OwL. Fall rushing cen-
tered around a beautiful formal tea at the home of Phi Sig patroness, Mrs. Benjamin
Neiman. All decorations were in Phi Sig colors, gold and blue, with candle light
heightening the general effect of subdued color and soft shadows. The Alumnae
Bridge was held in the Hotel Schenley Patio and Conservatory, with the actives
serving as aides, and luscious baskets of fruit were distributed as prizes by Mollie
Levy, chairman of the affair. Xmas week found the Phi Sigs and their heart throbs
dancing to the smooth rhythm of Dick Stabile and his band at the Italian Terrace,
celebrating the Phi Sig’s annual formal dinner dance. Spring rushing brought the
traditional Sphinx Banquet, observed by chapters all over the country, and Iota
chapter true to tradition, held theirs at the Concordia Club. Risking their necks at
a skating party, the Phi Sigs offered the Lexington crowd plenty of laughs, as they
staggered around the ﬂoor, many of them on skates for the first time since grade school
days, but good naturedly taking the laughs, and throwing dignity to the winds.
Spring Convention plans are in mid-air, the Phi Sigs undecided whether to celebrate
their Silver Anniversary at Atlantic City or New York/our guess~is that May
will ﬁnd them lolling on the white sands of the seashore.

THETA PHI ALPHA

Away ahead of the other fraternities, the TPA’s Started out their years activities
with a picnic at Mary Jane Morgan's cottage in Ligonier%a ﬁnal summer outing
before dashing back to registration. Moving into their lovely new house on the
corner of Devonshire and Center Avenue, the TPA's entertained their Mothers’ Club
at a tea, and together mothers and actives worked out plans for the coming year.
Winter snows suggested the Winter Formal, held at the Italian Terrace the Monday
before Xmas*everyone still in suspense as to gifts, wondering what the boyfriend
had brought them, and half sorry they hadn't exchanged so and so’s present. Then
Xmas day an active Alumnae party was held at the house, everyone showing off
their Xmas finery and exchanging 10 cent presents. During vacation TPA actives
met in town to window shop and have lunch—see a show——meanwhile exchanging
the latest tidbits of gossip and planning for the next social event. This turned out to
be a party featuring Mr. Reizenstein, a glass blower, who entertained the group with
demonstrations and explanations about his work, much to their interest and admira-
tion. President of the Senior Class, TPA, Irene Maroney led the Heart Hop to success
—a charming dance, a charming band, and—a charming girl. Friendly pals with Phi
Kaps, most every dance ﬁnds members of the two frats “twosoming,” particularly
during men’s rushing period. The Spring Formal in May wound up the TPA social
calendar for the year, and set them packing shorts and swimming suits for summer

camping at Ligonier.

ZETA TAU ALPHA

Proud possessors of last year's Senior Queen, the ZTA's have acquired campus fame
for their many activities at Pitt. Excited Zetas crowded Stephen Foster thcatcr this
winter to watch their prexy star, Ione Williams, shine in Pitt Players’ production
“Fresh Fields." Adding this year's Interfraternity Sing Cup to its twin one last year,
the Zeta mantel boasts quite a collection. In return for a dinner given the Thetas,
ZTA's were entertained by the Kite wearers at a Kid Party, where both frat groups
munched hot dogs and ice cream cones, while “big appling" to the sweet strains of
the Theta's radio—victrola. Hallowe’en found the Zetas, shivering past clanking
skeletons in dark corners, stumbling over a bloody corpse sprawled in the doorway
and peering at each other through the dim candlelit rooms of their house. On a
starlit night in November, ZTA's and their sweethearts bumped along highways on
hay wagons, well bundled in blankets against the crisp night breezes, harmonizing
Zeta songs, and finally winding up at a farmhouse where a chicken dinner and "every-
thing that goes with it,” was served to the famished hayriders. Drawing closer the
ties between active and alumnae Zetas, the Alumnae entertained their younger sisters
at various teas and parties, while both chapters turned out “en masse" for the gala
Winter Formal at the Churchill Valley Country Club. Bidding adieu to Senior
graduates at their traditional Senior luncheon at the College Club, ZTA’s presented
their departing sisters with quaint ZTA book-ends, then delved into plans for summer
camp. The Spring Formal held at the Pittsburgh Field Club, climaxed the ZTA's
social activities for the year. Then helping convention trotters on their way, the
Zetas closed house for the summer, and departed, bound for vacation haunts.

FRATERNITIES COMPETE FOR ALL—POINTS CUP

The strongest fraternal group on campus
doesn’t have its own house, has only
twenty-six members, and meets only once
a month, but nevertheless guides the des-
tinies of the other thirteen social fraterni-
ties. It is Interfraternity Council.

Two representatives from each of the
“thirteen” under the supervision of Robert
R. Corley, Assistant to the Dean of Men,
form this coordinating body.

This year, fraternities entered IF com-
petition with renewed vigor. Each wanted
to be the ﬁrst to win the giant bronze ALL-
Points Cup and have their name inscribed
on the first of its ten shields. Beginning
this year, the trophy is awarded annually
to the house amassing the highest number
of points in interfraternity athletic and
scholarship competition.

With only half of the program com-
pleted, no fraternity has won more than
one first place. Helping to keep the Kappa
Sigs near the front was their victory in the
volleyball tourney. The Lambda Chis left
the Delts holding the second place touch
football cup, when they annexed the ﬁrst
place trophy for themselves. The Pi Lams
came back in their old style to win the
first semester scholarship race with a 1.68

226

average, and incidentally, more points to-
ward the grand total.

The last competitive cup awarded dur-
ing the first semester went to the SAES for
winning the Sing, which was held in con-
junction with the very successful IF Yule-
tide Dance, chairmanned by jack Sigmon.

Highlighting the interfraternity social
season, the IF Ball ﬂew higher than ever
on the tails of the thirteen fraternity—col-
ored kites decorating the William Penn
ballroom. Chairman Ray Nordstrom im-
ported Paul Pendarvis' swaying rhythm,
with gold pendant favors.

IF Council expressed the opinion of the
whole student body when it presented the
Pitt Band with a cup in appreciation of its
“loyalty and outstanding service to the
University."

Another progressive innovation was
made by Interfraternity Council when it
arranged for the fraternities to subscribe
to the leading educational and topical fra-
ternity magazines.

Even more successful than in former
years, the coordinating body of Interfra-
ternity Council closes its 1937-1938, secure
in the knowledge that this has been one
of its most successful years.

It was early registration for the Delts last summer, when they signed up for their
biennial convention quartered at the William Penn. The August weather was perfect
for their summer night formals, stags, smokers, and down-river boat rides. The local
"Delta Shelter" is the headquarters for the largest trophy collection on campus. Even
so, there is still a favorable “Delt" market for more cups; but they will have to build
an annex to their old cup case to house the newly won runner-up IF football and sing
cups. Drinking glasses and cups were discarded for the good old pop bottle, when the
Delts and Deltesses masqueraded for the “Bowery Ball," in February. This dance
lacked the formality that made the Delt’s Spring Formal THE dance on the calendar.
Private collections in the Delt house include two ODK keys swinging respectively
from Johnny Glasser's and Sam Wer1inich's watch chains. Johnny earned his as
prexy of Men’s Council and two years Bus Manager of Pitt's humor mag; while
Sam works behind an old oak in the office across the way, as business exec of the OWL.
Bill Kunkel, in addition to attending SFA meetings, helps Sam by signing up organi-
zations for the OwL. The Delts have another Pzmtber plugger in circulation manager
John Downie. The Pitt Band's strutting drum major, john Chelfey, is the Delt's
high stepping prexy. During the Spring, John keeps his legs moving as a chorister
in Cap and Gown. Another fast moving Delt, Ernie Holmok, is the OwL’s literary
editor, while Naric and Holt, varsity pigskinners, join Bob Schrader, varsity swim-
mer, and ROTC's Major John Tredennick in helping to set the Delts’ pace.

The Kappa Sig house is the campus incubator for Pitt football coaches. Both
Johnny Michelosen and Don Hensley will be hitting the line as Jock Sutherland's
coaching assistants next year. As an undergraduate, Bulgy Michelosen was varsity
quarterback for three years and this year was elected honorary captain of the country's
number one team. In the fall his companion, Hensley, will be coaching the new crop
of understudies at center. Andy Moffatt, otherwise known as the Kappa Sig Horatio
Alger ran up the oﬂicial fraternity ladder from social chairman, to secretary, and then
reigned as president of his Dithridge St. house. On Campus “Mousetrap" Moffatt
is known as treasurer of IF Council, bus manager of the IF Ball, Cap and Gowner, and
SFA social committeeman. The Kappa Sigs have as a brother the loveliest “lady"
in C 8: G, Bill Hoevelet. Bill has completed his third year of footlight basking. Off
season, Bill is an active Pitt Player, member of IF Council, Men’s Council, and does
a bit of he—man’s work on the Pitt wrestling team. Most of the fellows thumbed their
way to Penn State for their Annual District Conclave. In the inevitable conclave bull
session the local boys told their distant brothers of how they copped the IF volleyball
and basketball titles and how they won the runnerup cup in outdoor track. While the
Conclave was a climax to the Kappa Sigs local Winter Formal, it was only a prelimi-
nary to their biggest dance of all, the Spring Formal, a veddy veddy exclusive affair.
The mothers of Kappa Sig have a fraternal order of their own and were instrumental
in having the kitchen re-equipped and redecorated.

The Lambda Chis are still very much in the midst of campus life even though their
house is way up on the hill. Ralph Dorand, as house prexy, divides his time and
rhythm between swinging on his clarinet in the band and swinging at the other
man in the ring. The house's enthusiasm for the mitt sport was shown when Jack
Schricker, Pitt boxing coach, was made an honorary member. Jimmy Watson exhibits
some of the same rhythm beating a drum in the band. The boys got away to a good
start by taking ﬁrst place in touch football. Jerry Mann stood out as the best man
on the ﬁeld and ended up an All-Fraternity halfback. The social season of the hill
toppers included two important dates—the Spring Formal, at Churchill Valley
Country Club and the wedding of "Lil Abner” Daniell, last year's All—American
brother. In the white collar activities we ﬁnd Fred McCamic on the News staff with
Clyde Haslet, forming the Lambda Chi delegation to IF Council. Haslet also repre-
sented the fraternity at their National convention in Toronto, last summer. Among
the Lambda Chi Alphas are John Thomas, a member of Sigma Tau and Sigma Gamma
Epsilon, and Alex Willson, SFA, Druid, and upperclass councillor. Every meeting of
Kappa Phi Kappa ﬁnds fraters Bob Cook and Ed Hefner answering roll call. The
Lambda Chis are quite proud of the initiation into their secrets of John Sargent, the
son of the Grand High Zeta of the fraternity.

While Curly Stebbins was running wild on the Pitt gridiron, his Phi Delt fra-
ternity brothers were doing a bit of scampering themselves, around other sectors of
the Pitt campus. Chuck Wright was the prexy of fraternity presidents as head of
IF Council. In addition, Chuck was “dictator” of his own house for a year. In
February, when Ted Lyons took over the Phi Delt gavel, they were in the thick of
IF competition. To make room on top of the bookcase for the newly annexed Scholar-
ship and Indoor Track cups, Ted had to ﬁnd another place for the runner-up trophy
in Interfrat volley ball and the award they won last May in outdoor track. Letterman
Bob Dannies, who starts the ball rolling brother Curly's way on the gridiron, helps
to keep the Phi Delt ball rolling on campus. Beside being hailed as a brother in
ODK, he is Vice-President and organizer of Men’s Council. Bernie Cashdollar, the
proverbial campus smoothie, wears keys for membership on the Panther editorial
board, representative in IF Council, and assemblyman in SFA. Other Phi Delt
footballers in addition to Curly Stebbins, Pitt's crooning halfback, and “Fumbler"
Dannies, are Chuck Fleming, Congo Fullerton, and Johnny Dickinson. Pitt’s one
man dating bureau, Bill  Herbert" Angel, who was the spark of Phi Delt's rushing
season, did a little sparkling of his own in the Glee Club. In December, the Iota
brothers were hosts for the annual Phi Delt Tri-Province convention, the guest of
honor being Dean Hoffman, president over the national roster of 47,000 Phi Delts,
the largest group of fraters in the country.

Running the gamut from the Stadium greensward to the William Penn Ballroom's
polished ﬂoor, the Phi Ep fraters led a full campus life this year. When the Panthers
played football in Pittsburgh, the Phi Eps turned out en masse to sit with a thrilled-
full stadium and get an extra thrill as frater Marshall Goldberg, undisputed All-
American halfback, led Pitt to the national gridiron title. When the Panthers stalked
in out-of-town ﬁelds, Lester Hamburg, who headed the house and also sat in on the
SFA exec committee, packed the boys into his high powered Buick and followed the
team, but travelling closest to Biggie on all these football trips was Harold Klein,
outstanding sophomore guard. The Phi Eps also had a personal interest in another
campus activity. That was frater Bud Mayer's very successful Junior Prom, whose
Flower Ball theme gave Goldberg gardenias in January instead of the much discussed
roses. Upholding the Phi Ep colors most effectively on the Cathedral's eighth ﬂoor
was Herbie Rackoff, managing editor of the New: and the Voice of Pitt, broadcasting
over radio station KQV. Rackoff handed over news copy to Al Lasday, who helped
write the heads. One of the most vigorous workers around the refurnished Neville
St. house was Jack Kotler, who found time to chairman IF athletics. Banqueted to
the gills, Biggie Goldberg's most savory dinner taste came when Phi Epsilon Pi
honored him at a huge Hotel Schenley testimonial banquet, to which leading sports
enthusiasts were invited.

The Phi Gam house has been dressed up in real Bachelors’ Club style. Their
Wallingford Street mansion is luxuriously furnished with leather furniture from top
to bottom and the den is really conducive to a fraternity round table. The Fijis
certainly have covered ground this year, especially Dick Mason, captain of the track
team, who, under the ﬁne managership of Carl Ulrey, won the 100 and 220 yard
IC4A track championships. Managing is a Phi Gam specialty—Bill Stirling “rates"
as both the Fiji house overseer and manager of the swimming team. He takes a
fraternal interest in the accomplishments of the water splashers' ace diver, Steve
Rodnok. The man commuting bareheaded between the Cathedral and Foster Me-
morial trying to get the official permish to hold dances in the latter building is another
Phi Gam manager, Jim Davis business exec of Pitt's thespians. And as a Sophomore,
Homer McClintock, the campus fashion plate, was a business manager, too, in charge
of the ducats for the most successful Soph Hop. High pressured wrestlers Roofner and
Ray Dimit make it safe for brother Chuck Dimit to carry the chapter funds around
with him. For a while, when he was bus manager, Chuck needed their help in guard-
ing the IF informal money. During the remainder of the year he carried on in IF
Council as Vice—Prexy. Four big Fijis standing in a row are Glee Clubbers Ray
Bender, Bob Aschom, John Danton, and John Werry, who was also in Cap and Gown
as the masculine lead. The outstanding Fiji bachelor, ODKer Paul Jennings, looks
after the incoming freshmen men as chairman of Men's Customs.

Following the Phi Kaps on campus is the same as taking a sight-seeing trip around
Pitt. Al Barr, who was the Phi Kap prexy for two years, has been a campus leader
for just as long. Besides being the varsity football manager, “Spanky" was a two
year gavel wielder of ODK, Vice-Prex of SFA, and for the fourth season Al’s chubby
personality highlighted the Cap and Gown show. The Phi Kaps have two more
ODK men, a fraternity high, in Jack Withum and Bill McKenna. A Lieutenant-
Colonel in ROTC, Jack is also a Scabbard and Blader, a member of Pitt Players and
Cap and Gown. Bill is active as manager of Doc Carlson's basketeers, a varsity tennis
star, and an SFAer, in addition to wearing a Scabbard and Blade pin. Early in the fall
the Phi Kaps redecorated their house. The new red and green leather living room
furniture exemplifying the happy holiday spirit which exists in their fraternity.
Among the Phi Kap actives there are thirteen varsity lettermen. Heading the list
are footballers All-American Frank Souchak, also captain of the golf team, Dante
Dalle Tezze, John Urban, and Pitt's sensational Sophomore halfback, Dandy Dick
Cassiano. Pat Cusick was king for a night as chairman of the Soph Hop; while
Dalle Tezze was Dictator for a week in "Pickers Please.” This year's Cap and Gown
business manager was a Phi Kap too—Steve Rooney. But, the big apple of them all
was Walt “Susie-que" Cavalier, a perennial shiner in Cap and Gown and Chairman
of Pitt's truckingest Cap and Gown dance. With all of these ace dancers it is little
wonder that the Phi Kap's Shannopin Country Club spring formal was the tops.

Around campus, the PiKAs are known to be even smoother than their house's
newly sanded ﬂoors. Leading the PiKA smoothies on campus and in the house is
their prexy, Wes Thompson. Naturally the new ﬂoors made dancing in the house
nicer than ever. With the soft dim light from the new indirect lighting ﬁxtures cast
on the recently papered blue and cream—colored walls, the frat took on the air of the
Rainbow Room. One of the bright Lights in the PiKA house is Ray, who was vice-
prexy of CA and inherited the position of production manager of Cap and Gown from
his frater jack Spear, who resigned in favor of the footlights in the C 8; G chorus.
The last evening of school before the Yuletide recess found the PiKAs gathered around
a colored lighted Xmas tree, after a belt straining banquet, to exchange gifts and
Mary Livingston poems. The brothers coming back after New Years were pleasantly
surprised with a dance thrown by the PiKAlets (pledges) to the tunes of Benny
Goodman and Hal Kemp, by courtesy of their new phonograph amplifying system.
Chairman of more school dances last year than any other Pittite was CA's prexy
Ted Whitaker. When Ted was not leading the destinies of the CA, he had his hands
full directing Pitt’s 150 piece band. In the band following the beat of Ted's baton
was frater and ODK man Frank Engel. In the PiKA house, though, the tables were
turned; the house was Engel's castle, and he was “king." Welcoming the band
when it gave an intermission exhibition at one of the hockey games was Taylor
Brittain, the hockey teams ace puckster.

CHANCELLOR JOHN G. BOWMAN

CHANCELLOR JOHN GABBERT BOWMAN

The Class of 1938 cherishes among the fondest remembrances
of its college life, an appreciation of the personality as well as
the ideals of Chancellor John G. Bowman. We have been for-
tunate indeed in being better able to sense the warm friendli-
ness he radiates, while continuing to reap the beneﬁts of his
idealistic achievements. For, it is from those ideals that have
sprung, not only our magniﬁcent Cathedral, but a philosophy
of life and education that has been to us the true goal of all
learning.

But what has served to endear. him more, to University
students, have been intimate glimpses into his private life and
carefree youth. How realistically every boy lived over again
with him, the pranks of his college days which he told so de-
lightfully at Assembly meetings. Groups of rabid candid cam-
era “addicts" have found in him an enthusiastic associate, for
among his prized possessions is a “dark" room, where he has
spent many happy hours developing his own prints. He laugh-
ingly admits to being, particularly, a “bug" on nature photog-
raphy. There is something appealing about a man who will
sit for hours, eagerly awaiting an opportunity to snap the pic-
ture of a tiny ﬁeld mouse, poking his timid nose out into the
bright sunshine.

Such heart warming anecdotes have brought Chancellor
Bowman closer to every student where his sincerity and friend-
ship may be fully appreciated.

Deﬁnition of 1937-38 Pi Lambda Phi: A handsomely redecorated house with a
host of activities leaders. The now famous Pi Lam Blue and Silver Room together
with other extensive innovations made their debut at an early November house
warming, invites going only to faculty and student biggies. The year's most distin-
guished Pi Lam guest was the country's leading labor lawyer and Nation Award
winner, Arthur Garﬁeld Hays, who was tendered a testimonial dinner by his Pi Lam
brothers. According to the “Gamma Stigma," annual Pi Lam raz rag printed for
their Westmoreland Country Club Spring Formal, the Pi Lams have some campus
who’s who. Co-editors of the raz rag Dave Grossman, and Jack Sigmon contributed
their share to the Pi Lam glory as varsity football manager and chairman of the
Yuletide Festival, respectively. The Dithridge Street frat has a houseful of campus
treasurers—Milt Hansburg of Men's Council, Harry Bash in CA, and Sammy White-
man in Druids. Leading the Pi Lams isjay Reich who is bus mgr. of Pitt's tri-weekly.

take over the gavel as Rex. On the editorial board of the same pub, Lenny Levison,

football game. Another Pi Lam Len, Lenny Broido, organized Pitt's very successful
hockey team. On the OwL, Fady Frankel is in charge of circulation and Dan Lichten-
stein is an editorial board member. Among other Pi Lams who went places this year

The happy tunes that won the Interfraternity Sing cup for the SAE's turned into
a lamentoso melody last January, when the cup was stolen from their trophy mantel.
By March, the boys were again singing a merry crescendo. Not only was the cup
returned, but the lion-guarded house was quaking in its foundation after a whole
week of silver anniversary celebration, featuring a banquet-dance. Yet the women's
fraternities know the SAE's best for their excellent house dances. On eight different
occasions the SAE's played host in honor of one of the campus sororities. At these
affairs Ray Nordstrom was the all-round man, who later lead the IF ball and headed
the SFA Appointments Committee. In addition, he is wearing keys from ODK,
Sigma Tau, and Sigma Gamma Epsilon, and a varsity letter for his work as a Pitt
harrier. The SAE’s have more lettermen including Frank Patrick, Henry Adams, and
Al Lezouski. With the coming of winter Patrick and Adams changed their football
togs for basketball shorts and played on the Senior Football Players team. At the
beginning of the second semester thirty-four actives elected Tom Roberts as the new
SAE president and Don joy as keeper of the treasury. Don, who is a dapper dresser,
was a cartoonist for the Pam‘/oer and wrote song script during the last two years for
Cap and Gown. At the close of this year the SAE's had 112 chapters, the largest
number in any national fraternity.

In September, the SAMs added the ﬁnishing touches to their modernly furnished
house when they brightened up the front porch with a coat of yellow paint. But
this has only been one of the many SAM accomplishments. The earnestness of their
desire to win the IF Scholarship Cup was shown when they ﬁnished the ﬁrst semester
with a topping 1.66 average. The SAMs aren't quite satisﬁed; their goal is setting
the all—time IF scholarship mark. While the Sammies spend a lot of time leaﬁng
texts, they still do many things to keep them in the campus eye. It isn't very hard to
keep sight of Cap and Gowner and Sammie prex Jerry Black, whose (earth)quaking
personality has also been a familiar ﬁgure around the shot-put pit and IF Council.
Milt Hoffman, playing the queen in “Pickers Please," was another easy to see Cap
and Gowner. Mirror surface is in abundance around the SAM house, especially with
the addition of the bright surface runner-up Ping-Pong and Mushball Cups. Pitt's
most similar twins, Vic and Joe Reiter, were largely responsible for the annexation
of both cups. And mainly through the eﬂorts of Vic, Pitt now can boast of a very
competent table—tennis team. In a house of scholars, social activity found a very

‘ prominent place. Many of the innovations at the Sammies June evening country
club Spring Formal were Cleveland born; imported from the very novel and fast step-
ping tea dances and formals on the crowded SAM's National Convention calendar.

maple furniture, and their old lively fraternity spirit. From appearances, no one would
ever know that the Sigma Chis are the oldest national fraternity on campus; since
the house resembles a furniture stores model room. The Sigma Chis claim that their
novel study room arrangement is responsible for their fast climb up the fraternity
scholarship ladder. Another bit of Sigma Chi ﬂash was displayed one Saturday
morning when brothers Cliff Allen and Bob Grant made the famed Dithridge St.
dash to determine who was the house Mercury. But the real speedster was the nation's
number one junior outboard motorboat star, Bob Heap. Pitt’s Astaire and Rogers
duo, Larry Orr, another motorboat champ, and Joan Young highlighted last New
Year's Eve ﬂoor show at the Schenley with a big "Big Apple." Other thespianic
Sigma Chis include Pitt Players’ high ﬂying lead in “Ceiling Zero," Earl Riley, and
his co-pilot, Austin Hay. Student stadium goers know Earl as Pitt's head cheer
leader; while, Sleepy Austin, far from a socialslite, stood out as the Glee Club’s
leading warbler. The Sigma Chis displayed their “never say die" spirit by electing
Republican Hoover to be president. Of course, his first name is not Herbert, but
George. Among the fraters is George Clifton, who is a pole Vaulter in his own right
on the varsity track team. Like Robinson Crusoe, the Sigma Chis have their man
Friday, a varsity Panther puckster. The passionate glint in the Sigma Chis’ eyes when
they sing their sweetheart song is inspired by their Sigma Chi sweetheart, Sonja
Henie.

Shining out from one of the ﬁve houses that make Dithridge
Street “fraternity row," a red neon sign welcomes the brothers in
Theta Chi. That same red sign might mark many of the fraternity
contributions to the campus, too. For years the “High C" in Glee
Club has worn a Theta Chi pin, and this year was no exception, for
Tom Bricker, house prexy, carried on tradition by wielding the
gavel as Glee Club president. Working with Bricker was Bill Wolfe,
the Glee Club's manager and secretary of Theta Chi. Two members
of this house are well-known to football fans: Bill Daddio, one the
nation's finest football ends, and good-natured Johnny (Chick)
Chickerneo, who has earned his varsity post as quarterback against
the stiffest kind of opposition. Varsity backﬁelder Larry Peace also
signed in as a pledge at the Dithridge Street house this year.

Varsity “P" wearer, too, is Pete Bennett, Coach Carlson's ace
high-jumper. I. C. 4A indoor champion in his sophomore year,
Bennett will again be after the title this spring.

This spring will ﬁnd the entire house ready to defend a champion-
ship, too. The coveted trophy for the sweepstakes, biggest event
for fraternities in Spring Festival, went to that house in 1937, and,
according to the Theta Chis, there’s an empty place on the mantel
waiting the 1938 first place cup.

ATHLETES

 

ATHLETICS
AT THE
UNIVERSITY

 

James Hagan
Director of Athletics

With the winning of eight titles by five of its
teams, with the establishment of a new “simon
pure” athletic code, and with the outbreak of sev-
eral rumors in the football and basketball depart-
ments, the University of Pittsburgh's 1937-38 ath-
letic year can safely be called successful, dramatic,
and spicy.

Of the championship winning teams, Jock Suth-
erland's footballers can be given ﬁrst place, with
three crowns. john McSorley’s ﬁrst year hockey-
ites come next with two honors, followed by the
boxing, swimming and basketball squads of Jack
Schricker, Pat Corr, and Dr. H. C. Carlson respec-
tively, with one championship apiece. The Blue
and Gold's football season was outstanding, not
only to Pittsburgh fans, but to the entire United
States as well. The leading papers in the country
proclaimed the undefeated Sutherlanders “the most
powerful bulk of football machinery during 1937"
and then followed through by naming them mythi-
cal National Champions. As branches of this Na-
tional Championship, the Eastern Championship
and City of Pittsburgh Championship were also
granted the Panthers. Marshall Goldberg, junior
left halfback from Elkins, W. Va., was named the
champions’ champion, or in other words, almost
country-wide unanimous selection for All-American
rating. Displacing basketball as the second rank-
ing sport to football, the hockey team defeated its
league opponents, Tech and Duquesne, enough
times to win the City and Eastern Championships.
This year was the first that Pitt has been represented

244

on the hockey ice. Keeping up the traditional Pitt
habit of winning championships, the swimmers
captured the Eastern Championship, the boxers
easily pointed their way to the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Title, and the basketballers, despite a poor
season in general, managed to just win the City of
Pittsburgh Championship.

All of this was rather usual. But when, early in
February, the Board of Trustees handed down a
“code for the conduct of athletics at the University
of Pittsburgh," Pitt had something new. Brieﬂy,
the new program does two things. It codiﬁes the
eligibility rulings and, secondly, it sets up a new
administrative body for the enforcement of that
code. Under the first division, there are clauses
which taboo all forms of recruiting, restrict prac-
tice sessions to two hours daily, eliminate all direct
subsidization, discourage any alumni help, and re-
quire advancement in class by each athlete. Sev-
eral regular members of the football squad were
banned from spring training this year due to one
or two of the above clauses. Administration of
these rules has been put into the hands of a new
governing agency, known as the Faculty Commit-
tee on Athletic Policy, which replaces the old
Council. If one were to tabulate the rumors re-
garding Pitt Athletics for 1937-38, he’d probably
have to set up a Series A, B, etc. and numerous
subdivisions and then he might not have them all.

Sports at Pitt this year were indeed successful,
dramatic and spicy.

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 

THYRSA WEALTHEOW AMOS

DEAN or WOMEN

Since 1919 women's activities at Pitt have been
under the capable and considerate direction of Dean
Thyrsa W. Amos; and the University rejoices in the
continuation of her splendid services. Energetic in
the pursuit of her ideals, yet so genuinely coopera-
tive in her relations with women students, she has
truly been a guiding light, in the advancement of
coeducational opportunities here at Pitt.

Dean Amos has been ﬁttingly prepared for her
profession with a background rich in elements
necessary to administrative education. She received
her early degrees at the University of Kansas and
it was at Columbia University where her extensive
talents in the ﬁeld of student direction came to the
fore. At Pitt she has continued her invaluable
assistance to University women down through the
years.

VINCENT WESLEY LANFEAR

DEAN or MEN

The personality of Dean Vincent W. Lanfear has
become a tradition among Pitt students. His
friendly guidance, accompanying warm smile and
drawling voice, has been of immeasurable aid to
boys confused by the intricacies of college life.
His heartfelt interest and sympathy in student
activity have given Pitt men a close personal con-
tact with their University. Dean Lanfear was born
and educated in Texas, but came to Columbia for
his Ph.D. After brief stays at Columbia and Yale,
Dr. Lanfear came to Pitt in 1925 as a professor in
finance. He assumed the task of director of the
Evening Division, and retained this post until his
appointment as Dean of Men in 1933.

’37 PANTHER GRIDIRON
SEASON TOPS

HE triple-threat stars of 1937 are the Pitt Panthers.

Picked almost unanimously as the foremost grid

machine of the United States during the past season,
Dr. jock Sutherland’s squad lived up to pre-season pre-
dictions and accomplished what few championship-
bound elevens have done in the past: won nine and tied
one, during a ten game schedule representing the best in
all parts of the country, over opponents, in each case,
“shooting the works" to upset what they considered
their toughest and most eminent foe of the year. As
tokens of its ratings, the squad received the City of
Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce
trophies for the city title; the Lambert Trophy, for the
second successive year, in honor of the sectional title;
and the Dickinson trophy, presented by the Four Horse-
men, for the mythical national championship. At the
Conclusion of the pigskin term, the squad rejected a
“feeler,” which was believed by many to be an intro-
ductory ﬂourish, to a second consecutive Rose Bowl bid
for the Panthers. In addition, as a result of the fine
season, Coach Sutherland's all-time grid record in his
fourteen years at the University was brought up to 103
victories, 18 losses, and 11 ties. Furthermore, many
individual stars of this aggregation placed on numerous
“all" teams, chief of which was the naming of Tony
Matisi, of Endicott, New York, and Marshall Goldberg,
of Elkins, West Virginia, on the All—American Board's
All—American eleven.

PITTSBURGH 59, OHIO WESLEYAN O

In their usual opening-game spree on September 25,
the University of Pittsburgh footballers soaked Ohio
Wesleyan with a dripping ﬁfty-nine to nothing defeat.
An unknown quantity previous to the first contest,
because of the abandonment of the annual football
camp, Dr. Sutherland's Panthers announced their
intentions to football writers all over the country by
counting nine touchdowns and ﬁve conversions with
surprising dispatch for an early season test. First press
notices of the year headlined “Dandy" Dick Cassiano,
sophomore, who ran touchdowns four times on suc-
cessive dashes of forty-eight, twenty-one, sixty—six,
and forty-six yards, in addition to throwing completed
passes twice in three attempts. Others who each
tallied six-pointers included Stapulis, Goldberg, Peace,
Patrick, and Dickinson. Merkovsky place-kicked
extra points twice, while Daddio, Souchak, and
Farkas each registered one conversion. The Blue and
Golders ran “power plays” for four hundred and one

247

 

yards to their opponents four yards through scrim-
magc.

PITTSBURGH 20, WEST VIRGINIA O

In contrast to their touchdown party the previous
week, the Pitt Panthers were held to six points for
three quarters before they were able to unload two
Two placement
kicks by Elmer Mercovsky, a touchdown by johnny
Urban, and two by Curly Stebbins made the twenty-
point total for the winners.

quick fourth period touchdowns.

Battling against what was reputedly the strongest
team to represent W. V. U. in the last decade, Pitt
went scoreless until late in the second half, when
Urban cut back of left tackle to begin a thirty yard
touchdown dash. Prodded by determined Mountain-
eer offense, Pitt was forced to increase its lead. Result:
two more touchdowns and another victory.

PITTSBURGH 6, DUQUESNE O

The Pitt footballers cut themselves a sweet piece of
revenge pie on October 9. In a game which brought
more satisfaction to the team, officials, and student
body than any other contest during the season, Dr.
Sutherland's gridders scored a great team victory over
Duquesne, six to nothing, before sixty thousand
divided rooters. Won under miserable, rainy condi-
tions, the victory marked the first step toward the
city title, and the return of some pride lost to the
Hilltoppers last fall.

Boasting the pre-game cry, “We'll stop Goldbergl",
the Duquesne rooters and team were bewildered and
likewise embarrassed when, carrying the ball for the
first time, “Biggie” tore through right tackle, and
sped 77 yards for the lone score of the game. Fumbling
and faulty Center work, probably due to the unusual
weather, slowed up both teams. Oddly enough, the
game exactly duplicated weather and playing condi-
tions of the year before, with the Pitt team winning
by the same score by which it had once lost.

PITTSBURGH 0, FORDHAM O

Newsreel houses and photographic sections of news-
papers had a great time following the Pitt-Fordham
“doughnut-center” contest showing how Pitt scored
but didn't make a touchdown against the Gotham
Granite. With thirty seconds remaining in the first
half, Stebbins on the Ram five yard line, reversed to
Goldberg, who ran off right tackle untouched for
what the jammed Polo Ground assembly thought was
the first score in three years of Smoky City and Forty-
Second Street football. The referee ruled that Matisi
was holding on the play; the score was nulliﬁed; the
Sutherlands were penalized ﬁfteen yards; and football
experts throughout the country have had something
to talk about ever since.

A Fordham offensive which began early in the first
quarter ended on the Pitt forty—three, but a fumble in
the second period allowed Captain Druze to attempt
a ﬁeld goal from the twenty-ﬁve. It was low. The
third quarter brought three more unsuccessful three-
point attempts, two by Fordham from the ten and
eight yard stripes respectively, and one by Bill Daddio
from the Fordham twent_v—four. The Pitts ended with
twice as many stick-movers as the Rose-Hillers, but
no score in their only tie of the season.

PITTSBURGH 21, WISCONSIN 0

Newspapers again used their “GOLDBERG STARS,"
twenty-point type on October 23 when the “Mad"
Marshall twisted and drove for one hundred and
twenty-ﬁve yards and two touchdowns through
Harry Stuhldreher's Wisconsin team, as the Panthers
won easily, twenty to nothing. The game marked the
completion of the ﬁrst half of the Pittites’ schedule,
with Dr. Sutherland's boys still unscored upon.

A Blue and Goldberg march of seventy—nine yards
in the first period brought the initial touchdown, With
“Biggie” getting loose on consecutive gains of one,
six, ﬁve, twenty—nine, and a payoff tackle gallop of
six yards. On the second play of the next half Marshall
was off again by route of Wisconsin’s left tackle to the
goal line sixty-four yards away. Late in this same
period, Dick Cassiano, Goldberg's replacement, took
a lateral pass from Frank Patrick and sprinted seventy-
three yards through an open field for the third score.
Daddio placekicked the three conversions.

Pitt’s superiority was demonstrated in the ﬁnal
statistics showing three hundred and ﬁfty-two yards
from scrimmage against thirteen for the Badgers, with
fourteen ﬁrst downs to three.

Just Another Saturday

2-19

PITTSBURGH Z5, CARNEGIE TECH 14

Winning for the nineteenth time in twenty—four
tries, Pitt also annexed the city championship for 1937
by defeating Tech. The big Plaid team, however, was
the first to score against Pitt in the current schedule

. secondary proof, at least, showing that the
brand of football they played was in line with the
best traditions of the Pitt—Tech football feud.

Frank Patrick plunged two yards for the ﬁrst six
points after Lezouski's block of Lee’s punt which
Delich recovered, shortly after the opening kickoff.
But a Scotty touchdown, result of a 21 yard aerial
from Moroz to Kopcsak, and Kopcsak’s place kick
conversion, gave the Techites a 7-6 advantage until
15 seconds remained in the half. At this point, Frank
Souchak toed a perfect placement kick ﬁeld goal from
the 25, and all the Panther rooters were able to enjoy
their hot dogs and coffee during intermission time
because their favorite warriors were ahead, 9-7.
Seven minutes after the third quarter kickoff, Patrick,
Cassiano, and Stebbins had ploughed 80 yards for
another six points, with Pat again receiving the point
honors. Lee fell on a bad center pass back of his own
goal line for a Pitt safety, and johnny Urban shot a
long, hard one down the center to Ed Spotovich for
another touchdown and the end of Blue and Gold
scoring for the day. Tech tallied again in the closing
minutes of play on two passes to Rosenthal for gains
of 50 and 4 yards.

PITTSBURGH 21, NOTRE DAME 6

The Notre Dame and Pittsburgh football series
ended with this game, but Notre Dame probably
wishes now that the contract had terminated last fall.
Elmer Layden’s Irish were just unfortunate enough to
be the battleﬁeld on which the Panther bombshell
exploded this year, ﬁring away 21 points in 11 minutes
of the ﬁnal period, after allowing the heirs of Rockne
to enjoy themselves with a six-point lead.

After a scoreless ﬁrst half, Jack McCarthy caught
the Pittsburghers off balance with a high heave down
the center to Andy Pupulis, who pulled in the oval on
the Pitt 30 and scarnpered off to the ﬁrst touchdown.
This was the button that turned on the Sutherland
power plant, and what followed is being remembered
by many as the greatest exhibition of football momen-
tum ever generated in Pitt history. A pass, Goldberg
to Hoffman, the longest complete pass that “Biggie”
had ever thrown, set the stage for a Patrick line buck
for a touchdown. The Pitt team moved 67 yards in
seven line plays, with Stebbins reversing 26 yards for
the second touchdown. After a Pitt kickoff, Stebbins
intercepted a Notre Dame pass. In two plays, Gold-
berg and Patrick drove 42 yards for the ﬁnal touch-
down. Souchak converted after each touchdown.

PITTSBURGH 13, NEBRASKA 7

It was a Pittie. That is, it must have been for the
Cornhuskers who came all the way from Lincoln,
Nebraska, with no defeats and high aspirations for a
national title, but who, nevertheless, went the way
of all teams who had scored on Pitt ﬁrst this fall. An
overﬂow crowd of 71,000, necessitating ﬁeld bleachers,
watched the Golden Cat on one of its best days.

Two great lines clawed at each other throughout
the ﬁrst half, with the Pitt forwards giving probably
their outstanding performance of the year. A Pitt
punt set the stage for some Nebraska razzle-dazzle and
then touchdown. Stapulis booted from his own 14 to
the enemy 40 where Harris Andrews caught it, ran
towards the north sidelines, and slipped the ball to
Jack Dodd, who was running the opposite direction.
Dodd kept running for 60 yards and, after English
converted, the Nebraskans went wild with champion-
ship visions. But again, as in the previous week, this
was merely a signal for the Pitt Juggernaut to roll.
Frank Patrick bucked over the last yard for an 80 yard
march, during which there were no passes. Souchak's
conversion attempt hit the upright and the Blue and
Gold had ten minutes left to get ahead. Aided by a
Nebraska fumble, Stebbins, Cassiano, and Stapulis
went 33 yards in three plays for a Pitt victory, with
Stapulis scoring.

 

PITTSBURGH 28, PENN STATE 7

The Pitt Powerhouse, deciding it would go easy on
the nerves of its coach and the student body, went out
and steamrollcred two ﬁrst quarter touchdowns and
two extra points, and then coasted through to a 28-7
victory over the finest Penn State team to visit the
Stadium in a decade. In contrast to the previous three
weeks of thrill touchdowns for victories, the Suther-
landers sent Curly Stebbins over for a score early in
the ﬁrst quarter on the tail of a 55 yard march, and
not many minutes later Marshall Goldberg scored
after another 55 yard tear and wear. The second team
in the next period for Cassiano to execute the nearest
play of the contest, a 79 yard run for another touch-
down, and the Pittites left the ﬁeld at half time 20
points to the good. West Virginia Marshall scored
once more in the fourth period after Sidney Alter had
taken a pass for State's only points in the third frame.

PITTSBURGH 10, DUKE O

The 1937 Pittsburgh Panthers closed one of the out-
standing grid chapters in the University’s history by
converting two ﬁrst-half fumbles into as many scores
to win over Wallace Wade's Duke Blue Devils, 10-0,
in a muddy, rain-drenched contest.

Held out of Duke territory by Tipton's long-
distance, bouncing punts, Pitt was repeatedly forced
to run two or three plays and then send Frank Patrick
back to boot. On the fourth of this rather monoto-
nous series of punt exchanges, Honey Hackney fum-
bled a Patrick punt on his own 20 yard line and
Souchak recovered. Souchak, with Goldberg holding
the ball, connected with a perfect three—point place-
ment from the 23 yard line to give the Northerners a
ﬁrst quarter advantage. In an almost similar setup in
the next period, but staged this time by the second
team, Hackney, once more the victim, fumbled Bill
Stapulis' kick on the Duke 14 and Ed Spotovich
recovered for Pitt. Dandy Dick Cassiano cut through
left tackle on the next play for the six-pointer and
Souchak returned to the game to kick the goal.

BASKETBALL QUINTET CAP

Pitt's 1937-38 basketball campaign, which was
chieﬂy engineered by five seniors, was, in a relative
way, lukewarm.

There are no seasons within contemporary recol-
lection that the Pittmen favored the debit column.
In twenty—one contests, fourteen of them on foreign
ﬂoors, the Blue and Gold hoopsters bowed twelve
times and played to only nine happy endings.

The only bright colors in this comparatively dis-
mal picture of the court sport, which finds its ﬁnal
resting place in Coach Dr. H. Clifford Carlson's
office in Falk Clinic, are the City League Chamipon—
ship and the tie for third place, with Georgetown,
in the Eastern Conference.

Pitt played wobbly ball in their struggle to retain
the City cup. Dr. Carlson, having had his famous
“Win ’em all" ultimatum deﬂated during the early
season Western jaunt, did away with his “ﬁgure-
eight" ﬂoor style and inaugurated the “Elimina-
tion Offense.” The new system never matured.

CITY CHAMPIONSHIP

Duquesne's ﬁve opened the City series at the
Stadium and displayed plenty of ﬁght, but fell
before the true basket shooting of Myles Zeleznik,
who was the Panther spark all season, 35-28.
Tech's classy young cagers, favored to win the
local title, gave the Oakland veterans a nervous and
strenuous evening, but ﬁnally had to yield to the
Pitt players’ better hoop eyes, 36 to 30.

In the second half of the Pittsburgh race the
Panthers were surprised by a much smoother click-
ing Duquesne club than they had encountered
earlier in the campaign. The quint from the Boule-
vard of the Allies stormed the Pitt buckets for 39
points, while the Panthers were able to draw only
within two marks of the Hilltoppers. This game
was a scorcher all the way, reminiscent of the
uncomfortably close tilts waged by these natural
enemies in past years.

Duke's win over Pitt threatened to shift the City

League into a triple tie, since Carnegie was counted

BASKETBALL TEAM SCORES NINE VICTORIES

on to humble the Cathedral courtmen in their
scheduled meeting a few days later. But the un-
expected happened in the Carnegie clash. The
Panther basketeers, led by Captain Bob Johnson
and Eddie Spotovich, played the smart, snappy
type of ball Pitt teams are widely known for.
Their spirited guarding and ambitious follow~up of
every shot netted them a decisive victory over the
Plaid, and, more important, the City crown.

Considering the Pitt schedule, twenty-one games,
fourteen of them away; and what went with it, one
hard stretch coming during the mid-semester
examinations, the installation of an undeveloped
new system, and a scarcity of relief material, Dr.
Carlson’s veterans did a good enough job.

The Oakland athletes can sit back and enjoy some
measure of satisfaction from non-league skirmishes,
even though they did lose the majority of their

254

matches. They were at their best the nights they
topped Syracuse and Northwestern, two of the
nation’s leading quints, and only Notre Dame’s
great court club set the Blue and Gold warriors
back hard. In most of their defeats the Pitts missed
the favored side of the score by only one, two, three
and four points.

CHARLES S. TIPPETTS

DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF

BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

Although he has only been associated with the
University since 1935, Dean Charles S. Tippetts has
reached a place in the heart of his students that is an
enviable one. This man with the ready smile and
a cheery word combines those rare qualities of ex-
ceptional ability and human understanding that
has lent a touch of inspiration to his teaching and
administrative career.

Dean Tippett’s extensive experience has been
gained from many sources. He took his A.B. de-
gree at Princeton in 1916, served in an official ca-
pacity overseas in 1918, and has held a professor-
ship in economics at the University of Washington,
Iowa, and Buffalo. Since his stay here he has been
actively aligned with the Chamber of Commerce
and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.

DEAN OF THE COLLEGE

Dean Stanton C. Crawford embodies in his own
personality and background, the very elements and
purposes to be found in the school of which he is
head. His interests and hobbies are ﬂung widely
into divergent ﬁelds. Academically he continues
to pursue his studies in biology and zoology, and
his literary contributions in these sciences command
nationwide attention. But he endeavors to find
time for his interesting, if irreconcilable, hobbies
of Walking and ocean cruising. After receiving his
Ph.D. at Pitt in 1926 he was appointed head of the
Johnstown Center. In 1933 Dr. Crawford came to
the University to serve as director of High School
Relations and in 1936 took up his duties as Dean
of the College.

TRACK TEAM SETS NEW RECORD

Coach Carl Olson started his sixth year
as track coach at Pitt with the outdoor
IC4A championship to defend, sans some
excellent graduate trackmen, and with
Johnny Woodtuﬁ’, Pitt's greatest track
star, back to race for new world records.

With a very tough indoor schedule
through which to wade, Panther track
prospects looked bleak. However, the
rapid development of a group of sopho-
more track stars, during the months of
January and February, turned the track
house and track training quarters into a
brighter place.

Second year men Frank Ohl, Al McKee,
Al Ferrara,Johnny Bazyk, and Bud Hafer
appeared to score points and ease the situa-
tion. Ohl, McKee, and Ferrara teamed up
with striding Johnny Woodruff to form a
mile relay team, which is one of the best in
the country and a constant threat to the
world record. This quartet ran off with
the four indoor mile relay titles; the IC4A,
the Central Intetcollegiates, the Butler
Relays, and the West Virginia Relays. In
collecting these titles, the mile relayers
had to beat the other top-notch quartets
of the East, West, and Far Western uni-
Versities.

236

Sophomores Johnny Bazyk and Bud
Hafer handled the shot putt events. Hafer
didn't compete in many indoor events, but
Bazyk traveled with the team to capture
a second place in the Butler Relays and a
third at South Bend in the Central Inter-
collegiate competition. In both instances
Bazyk stacked up against world cham-
pions.

Frank Ohl and Al McKee left the mile
quartet long enough to score points in
other events. McKee is a quarter miler of
great promise, and during the IC4A meet
ran the 600 meters within 2 seconds of
world record time. Ohl is the best broad
jumper on the squad and doubles up to
enter and usually place in the dash events.
During the Central Intercollegiates, Butler
Relays, and West Virginia Relays, Ohl cap-
tured the broad jump event and placed in
the clashes,

Striding Johnny Woodruﬁ’ met trouble
during January and February. His first
time out, during the Millrose games,
Johnny trailed home sixth in the half mile
run, and track critics concluded that Wood-
ruﬁ‘ was not suited for indoor running.
Johnny was not in top condition and spent
the rest of January and all of February an-

choring the relay team and keeping out of
all other competition. However, in the
Central Intercollegiates, the Connellsville
ﬂyer again toed the line and dashed off
with the quarter and half mile runs, and
repeated his half mile victory in the West
Virginia Relay.

Ken Ryden, ace high and low hurdler,
wrenched a leg muscle and spent most of
the indoor season on the sidelines waiting
for the coming of spring and the outdoor
season. And Pete Bennet, high jumper,
spent the earlier part of the indoor season
waiting for an injury to heal. Bennet re-
entered competition with a win of the high
jump during the Central Intercollegiates,
was third in skimming over the bar in the
Butler Relays, and again headed the class
in the West Virginia Relays.

Captain Edgar “Dick" Mason, Sprinter,
found indoor running not to his liking.
Mason shows to better advantage outdoors
and spent most of the time working out the
leg kinks for the outdoor season. Dick

entered the West Virginia Relay and
dashed away to a second place. Ed Routch,
Frank Kristl, broad jumpers and dash men,
George Clifton and George Dines, pole
Vaulters, all were point getters and handy
men in the meets.

during the Indoor season for the Millrose
games, N.Y.A.C. games, and IC4A, and

started to hit a winning stride at the Cen-

from a ﬁeld of ﬁfteen strong western track
teams. The following week Pitt again in-

and ﬁnished ﬁfth beating out powerful
squads from the Big Ten and surrounding
territories. A second place in the West

tivities, and the Panther track team faced

A much improved Pitt boxing squad scored an
easy knockout as it won the Eastern Intercollegiate
Boxing Conference without registering an oﬁcial
point.

In the elimination heats on the day before the
championship ﬁnals at West Virginia on March 19,
the Pitt punchers won places for six representatives
in the eight bouts to be staged the next day. As-
sured of eighteen points by merely placing the men
in the official bouts, and since no other squad had
secured enough places to assure itself of over ﬁfteen
markers, the University of Pittsburgh was declared
oﬂicial champions before the ﬁghts even started.
But the Panthers did more than merely go through
the motions the next day. Jed Curtzi and Ray
Bombe boxed their way to point decisions, thereby
annexing individual titles in the 145 and 155-pound
classes, at the same time raising their teams total
to twenty-two points. West Virginia, Bucknell,
and Temple ﬁnished in a three-way tie for runner-
up honors, each with thirteen points. Washington
andjefferson College, the only other member school
represented, was last with three points. Ralph
Durand, Pitt's defending bantamweight champ,
was eased out of his title in the elimination round

by “Red” Glenn, of Temple.

At an oﬂicial meeting held prior to the staging
of the ﬁnals, Pitt's jimmy Hagan, director of ath-
letics, was elected president of the Conference for
the next year.

In dual meet competition this year, the Panthers
won three and lost four. Johnny Wargo, 135-pound
beltet, won all seven bouts in his division, but lost
his ﬁrst contest to Stevie Stefanou, of Bucknell, in
the championship ﬁnals.

Now Take it Easy

If the third time is the charm, then Pitt's
wrestling team must be immune to it! In
other words, for the third consecutive year,
the Pitt Panther gets off his wrestling mat
without having a Victory to show for his
efforts. After coming up second best in
dual meets for two years, Coach Ed
Mazeski's gruntmen, captained by Rudy
Tomarelli, were expecting to win at least
one match this season. But the 1937-38
record shows losses to Franklin and
Marshall, 32-O; Case, 19-9; Temple, 23-11;
Kent State, Ohio, 28-O; Waynesburg, 24-8;
and West Virginia, 34%-11/2.

However, if one is looking for consola-
tion, he ﬁnds it in comparing this year’s
point scoring record and last year's. The
Panthers totaled 29% points to their
opponents’ 150% in six matches this sea-
son, while their predecessors pointed only
28 to their foes’ 144 inﬁue meets last season.

In addition to Tomarelli and Harry
Roofner, Frank Kristufek, a sophomore,
who is Senior A.M.A. champion, started
for the matmen.

PACE FOR SWIMMING
TEAM

Pat Corr’s swimming team recorded an
Outstanding tank record for the 1937-38
season, although it scored only one point
in the National Intercollegiate champion-
ships. Prior to this meet at New Bruns-
wick, the water Panthers had annexed the
Eastern Intercollegiate title, in addition to
running up a dual meet record of ﬁve wins
and one loss.

The Pittmen's toughest dual meet of the
season came as the last one, after ﬁve suc-
cessive victories, against National Inter-
collegiate runnerup, Ohio State. Although
score books record the meet as a lop-sided
60-15 Walkaway for the Ohioers, actually,
competition in the individual contests was
close. In most of the events, the boys had
the judges scratching their heads to deter-
mine a winner. Milt Lederstein, Pitt's
chief hope for first places, failed to appear
for competition, reporting a heavy cold
and an injured foot.

Pitt became Eastern Champions at the
annual meet of the Eastern Intercollegiate
Swimming Association in the Metropoli-
tan Club pool on March 13. The Panthers

scored forty points, followed by Rutgers,
the pre-meet favorite, 25 points; Franklin
and Marshall, 24; Western Reserve, 17;
and Lehigh, N.Y.U., C.C.N.Y., and Car-
negie Tech, each with a few points.

The tankers’ dual meet record this year
is deﬁnitely better than last season's, when
the swimmers tallied a ﬁve-victory, three-
loss rating. Corr's men's most convincing
win this year came in the ﬁrst meet, on
January 29, against Slippery Rock, 54-O.

HOCKEY HERE TO STAY

The newest athletic team at the University
adjusted itself to an old Pitt custom in its ﬁrst year
of competition here. The Blue and Gold hockey
squad, giving Pitt a representative in the ice-skat-
ing sport for the first time in this 1937-38 season,
joined the veteran football, basketball, boxing, and
swimming teams in the habit of winning a cham-
pionship or two per year. The hockeyites became
1938 champions of the city of Pittsburgh and of the
Eastern Division of the Ohio-Pennsylvania Inter-
collegiate League. John McSorley, Notre Dame,
coached the twelve-man squad, which played all
its home games on the Duquesne Garden ice.

After winning nine, losing three, and tying one
in league and extra-league competition, the Blue
and Golders qualiﬁed to meet Duquesne for the city
and eastern title. Playing under the regulation that
the team totaling the greater number of points in a
two-game series would be declared winner, the
Panthers lost the initial game to the Dukes, 1-0,
but led by Captain Bob Schooley, who registered
_ V all the tallies, came back to convincingly beat the
Indoor Tennis Hilltoppers, 3-O.

Hockey Match

READY, AIM, FIRE

Pitt's crack Riﬂe Team, attracting little attention
from the average student, other than the noise it
made while practicing at the Stadium, turned in a
top-notch performance for the second consecutive
year, under the direction of Captain D. M. Mitchell.

Displaying their shooting ability in eleven meets
from December 4 to March 26, the gunmen gained
first places many times, over such competition as
Lehigh, St. johns, johns Hopkins, Drexel, Penn-
sylvania, Penn State, and other large universities
and colleges.

Last season the Panther riﬂemen tied Carnegie
Tech and Cornell for first places in the Allegheny
Intercollegiate League, won second place in a
national riﬂe tournament conducted by a newspaper
chain, and tied the University of California for
fourth place in the shoulder-to—shoulder matches
run off at Annapolis.

A WORLD OF SPORTS

The ping of tennis rackets as white balls
sail across tennis courts—the swish of bas-
ketballs through hoops~the dull thud of
stick against ball in a hockey game, char-
acterize women's activities in the ﬁeld of
sports at Pitt. Athletics for women are
optional; but if a student decides that she
wishes to include sports in her activities,
there are many opportunities available for
her to do so.

The Women's Athletic Association
makes sports available for women students
who want athletics as an extra-curricular
activity. This year, in addition to its regu-
lar meetings, this organization sponsored
play-days at the gym and week-end out-
ings at Laurel Ridge where the girls did
everything from horse-back riding and hik-
ing to ﬁghting snowball battles, their
choice of fun depending upon the season
of the year.

Bull /5 Eye

Because they are not allowed to enter
activities until their sophomore year,
freshman women are not permitted to be-
come members of the W.A.A. Sponsored
for freshmen as a substitute for this asso-
ciation is the sports unit whose activities
are very similar to those of the W.A.A.
This year as previously, the unit met at
the Trees Gymnasium on Friday afternoons
during the activities hour; and the girls
played ping-pong, badminton, basketball,
and volleyball. During the winter, a swim-
ming party to which all the other units
were invited was held at the gym. In
May, the unit sponsored a play-day for all
the units.

— AND WOMEN

For the girl who wishes to make physi-
cal education part of her regular curricu-
lum, the University has offered for many
years an excellent course in this ﬁeld. This
course requires four years of sports. In
her freshman year, the would-be phys. ed.
takes the regular course in physical educa-
tion offered to all freshman women so that
she may become acquainted with the fun-
damental rules of all sports.

Games are discontinued during the soph-
omore year while swimming, calisthenics,
stunts, and social dancing are practiced for
grace and poise. The women's and men’s
classes are combined. It is not unusual to
see a tall, burly football man and a slim
young sophomore playing “London
Bridges Falling Down.” The learning of
such games is required so that these phys.
eds. may know how to teach such games
to children in elementary schools.

 

Setting Up Exercises

The girls are ready for special techniques
and rules in all sports when they have
reached their junior year. Both tap and
social dancing become a part of their class
work. By this time, they have learned
how to swim and are passing their junior
and senior life—saving tests. During their
ﬁnal year, physical education students
spend part of their time practice teaching
and the remainder in reviewing all sports,
dances, games, calisthenics, and life-
saving.

At the end of her senior year, each phys.
ed. possesses such grace and poise as to set
an example of what clean living, exercise,
and good health can accomplish and leaves
school a far different girl from the awk-
ward, young freshman who climbed the
hill to the gym four years before.

DEAN 017 THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION

The School of Education boasts a man possessing
the vigor of youth and the experience of a matured
educator in Dean Charles E. Prall. Dignity and
conﬁdence mark him as the capable administrator,
and a vivid sense of humor has made him a genuine
friend to those who seek his counsel. His interests
range from an appreciation of symphonic music to
admiration of Eddy Duchin's music.

Dean Prall's career in the ﬁeld of education has
been a wide and thorough one. From 1912 to 1927
he served as Superintendent of four different school
systems in Iowa. Before coming to the University
in 1934 he was successively Professor of Educational DEAN CHARLES E. PRALL
Research at the University of Arkansas and Dean
of Education at Arkansas State University. A com-
plete knowledge of his field has prompted him to
contribute frequent treatises to educational journals
dealing with problems of research and technique.

 LLOYD MAHONY

  J. LLOYD MAHONY

DIRECTOR 017 THE EVENING DIVISION

Since 1934, when Mr.  Lloyd Mahony was ap-
pointed Director, the Evening Division has added
immeasureably to its original practical purposes.
No small art of credit is, of course, due to the
transfer 0 the location of evening classes to the
quiet, inspiring surroundings of the Cathedral in
April 1936. But more important has been the per-
sonality and ideals of Mr. Mahony. He has striven
continuously to create an atmosphere and a back-
ground of appreciation that will create for his stu-
dents a newer, fresher view of the world that a
University should afford.

Mr. Mahony studied at New York University,
graduating from the School of Commerce in June
1923. After a brief stay as Research Fellow at the
Guaranty Trust Company in New York. He came
to the University as an instructor in Finance. For
nine years, he served in the School of Business Ad-
ministration. Then in 1934 he succeeded Dean
Lanfear as the Director of the Evening Division,
and has since fulﬁlled that duty with great success
and distinction.

EVER UPWARD

The Cathedral from an odd angle.

PROGRESS OF THE UNIVERSITY

“Ever upward . . . until education ex-
pands above the clouds into the light of
culture,” has been the object and trend of
the University. During the past year Pitt
has progressed educationally, adminis-
tratively, and physically, in its endeavor
to spread the light of the "candle" . . .
scholarship . . . to its students and com-
munity.

Laying of the cornerstone marked the
beginning of the interior completion of the
Cathedral. The Commons Room, exempli-
fying inspiration, acquired its full dignity
with the addition of its mood——expressive
furnishings, the wrought-iron grill work
and chandeliers, and the Hammond organ.
Flagstones forming the floor have been
smoothed and treated to bring out and
preserve their natural color.

The inspiration of the Commons Room
carries over into the Nationality class-
roon:s with an appreciation of man's
cultural contributions as they have devel-
oped through the ages. In June, four of
the rooms, the Swedish, Scottish, German,
and Russian, representing national cultures
from four different sections of the world,
will be dedicated. The general atmosphere
arising from the individual rooms shows
that the appreciation of art is world—wide.

266

The Swedish Room was dedicated as Pi tts-
burgh's part in the three-hundredth anni-
versary of the landing of the Swedes in
North America. With its painted walls
and ceilings this classroom will tell the
students of the dignity, gaity, reverence,

dents ﬁnd opportunity for

and humor, that lie in the depth of the
Swedish character. Rugged individualism
is expressed by the furnishings in the
Scottish Room. Dignity and culture are
shown by the carved coats of arms and
inscribed quotations of Germany's greatest
authors on the walnut panelled walls in
the German Room. The spirit of youth
going forth to ﬁght evil is the message
symbolized in the embroidered “vishivka"
of St. George and the Dragon in the
Russian Room.

Continuing the idea of the nationality
rooms is the Early American Room,
opened last Spring on the third ﬂoor. Its
low beamed Ceiling, with the secret bed-
room chamber above, contrasted with the
Gothic height of the Commons Room, fits
in with the attempt to show the expansion
of culture and learning through the ages.

Unﬁnished classrooms surrounding the
Commons Room on the first three ﬂoors,
characterized by “Pompeiian red" brick,
asbestos covered steam pipes, and galvan-
ized iron ventilators, were prematurely put
into active use. But these trivial hardships
gave way to the realization that the stu-
dents who only a few years ago sat in class
with their overcoats on, shivering over
their texts with the hope that some day
Pitt would be a great University, are now
close to realizing their dreams.

An understanding of the true feeling of
being educated “above the clouds," is
found in the first lecture hall to be com-
pleted in the Cathedral, Room 132. Its
bright spaciousness creates a feeling of
expansion and freedom, eliminating the
cloistered sensation of conventionally ap-
pointed classrooms. In this room education

finds its true aesthetic environment.

NEW QUARTERS IN

Another graphic interpretation of how
the Cathedral will look when it is com-
pleted is found in the seventh and nine-
teenth ﬂoors, ﬁnished this year. The calm,
cool. serenity of the indirectly lighted blue-
gray halls and corridors of the Fine Arts
Department give a feeling of educational
security. It is a great change to the swift
moving atmosphere of the nineteenth ﬂoor
where the blue, orange, and yellow decora-
tions radiate the professional eﬂiciency of
the new oﬁices of the Research Bureau of
Retail Training.

Although unﬁnished, the twelfth ﬂoor
is being occupied by the Dean of Women’s
oﬂices, the women’s lounge, and the wom-
en’s lunch room. The Dean's oﬂice was
moved this year from Heinz House, the
wooden structure which has been the
center of women's activities since the
World War.

A general exodus of other departments
and classes to the Cathedral took place.
Alumni Hall, former classroom building,
was completely vacated and remodeled to
accommodate Pitt's expanding chemistry
department. Some Business Administra-

THE CATHEDRAL

tion offices which had been in State Hall
were transferred to the eighteenth ﬂoor of
the Cathedral. The vacancies made by
these two departments were ﬁlled by one
of the University's most progressive
schools, the School of Engineering. To
complete the centralization of all of Pitt’s
branches, the oﬂlces of the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research, the only organization of its
kind in Western Pennsylvania and one of
the outstanding business bureaus in the
country, were removed from the cramped
environs of the old brick house next to
Falk Clinic into new spacious quarters in
the Cathedral.

This year the University’s great Medical
Center, including Pittsburgh’s largest hos-
pitals, research laboratories, and clinics, is
being enlarged by the addition of the new
Western Pennsylvania Psychiatric Hos-
pital. The land for the hospital was pre-
sented by the University to the state. As
the old Y Hut stood on this ground it was
necessary to raze it. Almost overnight, the
Hut was dismantled and the foundation
for the new hospital completed. The con-
tractors plan to have the building open for
use by the turn of the decade.

PLANS FOR CULTURAL CENTER MADE

When the Hut was torn down, the Ath-
letic oﬂices, which were quartered there,
had to be removed to the main pavilion of
the Stadium. To complete the Medical
Center's progress for the current year, the
old Bureau of Business Research Building
was converted into a home for the Falk
Clinic nurses.

Stephen Collins Foster Memorial was
dedicated and opened to the general public
and the student body for plays, concerts,
and social gatherings. Fitting a surprising
amount into such a small building, the
Foster Memorial contains a large audi-
torium, stage, and the Foster Shrine and
museum, oﬂices of the Tuesday Musical
Club, and a large ballroom.

The Old Mellon Institute building,
emptied by the removal of the Institute to
its world famous new granite structure
opposite the Cathedral, has been remod-
eled and will be shared jointly by the
Schools of Dentistry and Medicine.

To provide more conveniences for the
students on campus, a Tuck Shop was
opened on the ground ﬂoor. With the two
lounges, the men's on the eighth ﬂoor and
the women’s on the twelfth, the Tuck
Shop provides three eating places for the

students in the Cathedral. The Evening
School lounge in Room 144 offers a lunch
counter and smoking room for the evening
students. Another student service has been
installed this year with the opening of the
immense locker room on the ground ﬂoor.

Continuing the Cathedral campus’ meta-
morphosis, this year saw the completion
of Heinz Chapel, with the installation of
the stained glass windows. Pointing up-
ward to a height equivalent to half the
Cathedral, the spire of the Chapel was
strengthened before these sixty foot win-
dows, the world's tallest stained glass
windows to be made in one frame were
installed.

Materially aiding in the upward climb
by the development of the physical plant,
Pitt has administratively moved forward
by the addition of a new officer to the
University, Provost Rufus Fitzgerald, who
came here from the University of Iowa.
The Provost acts in the capacity of a
coordinating oﬂicer between the different
schools of the University.

H. EDMUND FRIESELL
DEAN or THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY

The growth of professional schools in the Uni-
versity has been studded with the names of many
brilliant men, among the foremost of whom is
Dean H. Edmund Friesell. There is probably no
other name that is so closely linked with an insti-
tution's progress as Dr. Friesellls is with the school
of, Dentistry. From the moment he assumed his
duties of dean in 1904, the Dental school has grown
in size and eminence, being recognized annually as
a “Class A” institution by the Dental Educational
Council of America, since that body began its rat-
ings in 1918.

Dean Friesell has long been a national ﬁgure
among dental authorities. He founded the Ameri-
can College of Dentists in 1920 and has served on
numerous state, national and international com-
mittees on dental research. He has found time to
contribute widely to dental literature. His per- DEAN H- EDMUND FRIESELL
sonal library contains a great number of almost
priceless volumes, some of which were exhibited
at the Century of Progress in 1933-34 by the Ameri-
can Dental Association.

Dean Friesell received his D.D.S. from the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania in 1895, but returned to
Pittsburgh to take his B.S. here at the University
in 1913. He was honored by Marquette University
with an L.L.D. in 1920 and by the University of
Pittsburgh in 1930 with a Sc.D. degree.

UNIVERSITY DEANS

ELMER ALLEN HOLBROOK

DEAN ELMER ALLEN HOLBROOK DEAN OF THE SCHOOLS OF
ENGINEERING AND MINES

To all engineers and miners at Pitt, Dr. Elmer A.
Holbrook is not only a capable clean, but a “real
guy" as well. In him his students have found the
sympathy and insight of a character mellowed by
many years of academic and technical experience.
Born of hardy New England stock, he began his
studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and received his degree in 1904. He began his teach-
ing career at Nova Scotia Technical College; he
moved to the University of Illinois in 1913 and con-
tinued there until the outbreak of the World War.

Dean Holbrook served as mine superintendent in
Montana and British Columbia, and in 1933 he
acted as technical advisor on coal for the N.R.A.
Despite his many duties as dean, Dr. Holbrook has
found time to write more than one hundred articles
on mining subjects and engineering education.

FROSH ENTER SOCIAL WHIRL

The Freshman Dance~Frosh debut into Pitt
social life—to the tune of Tom Gentry and His
Royal Ambassadors. With Leonard Edge as their
chairman, the committee got off to a good start by
booking the William Penn Hotel for the night of
December third. Perhaps that super publicity-
sponsoring auditions for frosh talent did it. The
fact remains, the Freshies’ dance drew the biggest
crowd of the year. Even the Freshmen in all their
conﬁdence were surprised as they collected stubs,
stubs, and more stubs at the door. Bucknell charm
was imported for the occasion with Miss Virginia
Strawn on Chairman Edge’s arm, as the leading
couple on the ﬂoor.

Intermission,~then the Frosh Entertainment.
First, Jerry Eisner, No. 1 campus crooner proved
his reputation, then Adele Yorio came through
with an interpretation of Ezveryéoa/fy Sing that would
have made Judy Garland look to her laurels if she
had been present. Bill Vaughen concluded the pro-
gram,—and we'll let you draw the conclusions
when we say he now has the lead for Pitt's Cap
and Gown Show!

December still found “The Big Apple” leading
all dances and true to tradition, some tireless Frosh
shouted “In the middle," and the war was on.
They peeled and quartered, trucked to and fro,
Suzy-Qued in the corners, kicked high and low.
Seniors sagged into armchairs, Juniors headed for
the seats, even Sophomores gave upwbut the Frosh
still continued their “Truck on down"! But even
the Freshmen go to bed sometime, and still fresh
as a daisy, they rushed the elevator, and grabbed
hats and coats, cracked upper-classmen on the
shoulders—conﬁdent in the knowledge of their
dance's great success.

SWINGIN’ AND SWAYIN’ AT
THE SOPH l-lOP

Nothing can dam en the spirits of the Sopho-
mores~at least the ownpour on the night of their
big dance had no such effect. Dripping umbrellas
shielding dainty feminine attire dashed madly into
the William Penn lobby, their masculine owners
then joining the damp procession to the already
jammed checkroom. White ties straightened and
small noses powdered, Soph Hop couples then
headed for the main ballroom. Chairman Pat Cusick
and attractive Betty Fagan greeted each dancer and
presented him with a program-his fair partner,
with the silver bracelet favor, crested with the Uni-
versity’s new seal. Latecomers then joined the
other dancers gliding around the ﬂoor to the
smoothness of Charles Pallos’ music. Followed
tangoes, waltzes, and rhumbas, but even Big Apple
enthusiasts hastened to gather round the mike when
Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians dropped in for
a few minutes between performances at the Stanley,
to harmonize on “We’re Working Our Way
Through College". Then for about a half hour the
dance became a “pep” rally for the Nebraska-Pitt
game the next day. First Fred Waring, then Suth-
erland and Goldberg, were cheered by the hilarious
dancers, (much to the disgust of the bonfire enthu-
siasts on Ruskin ﬁeld whose excitement, along with
the fire had been put out by the rain D. Lights dim-
med again—while dancers swayed tirelessly to the
band's sweet rhythm, murmuring comments on the
band's smoothness, Fred Waring’s surprise per-
formance and of the great success of the dance in
general. All too soon, one o’clock rolled around,
most couples slowly circling the ﬂoor, humming
“Good Night, Sweetheart“,—the last dance of the

night. But a few wise dancers slipped from the
crowd and sought the checkroom~snuggled into
their wraps and were on their way to Childs, be-
fore the mob charged the checkrooms. Seated com-
fortably, they had the laugh on the other prom
trotters who came dashing in later, vainly searching
for tables; yet all unanimously agreed that the
first formal of the year had proved one great big
success.

DEAN C. LEONARD O'CoNNELL

C. LEONARD O’CONNELL
DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY

In Dean C. Leonard O'Connell, an inquisitive
and idealistic mind has sought expression in many
complex endeavors. His whole life has been per-
meated with an altruistic desire to help others. It
is not strange that he interests himself studying in
the ﬁeld of scholastic philosophy. His idealism
has fostered a sense of civic pride and justice, that
has prompted him to assume the chairmanship of
the Board of Managers of the juvenile Detention
Home.

His pharmaceutical vocation is never neglected,
however, he frequently contributes articles to pro-
fessional and trade publications and acted as co-
author of “Pharmaceutical ]uris—prudence," a re-
cently published work.

Dean O'ConneIl's background is particularly ap-
pealing since he is a Pittsburgh boy, receiving his
Ph.G., A.B., Phar.D. from the University of Pitts-
burgh in 1912, 1916, and 1929 respectively. He
served as president of the Pittsburgh Pharmaceuti-
cal Association from 1929-1931 and is an active
member of several groups in his profession.

"Say, Bud, what's this I hear about the Junior
Prom going traditionalxthe Flower Ball, or some
such thing?” “You said it, Homer—the Flower
Ball it is—big name band and everything”, said
Bud Mayer, chairman of the Prom, strolled away,
leaving a visibly impressed Freshman to spread the
glad news. Posters appeared on bulletin boards,
stories crept into the News, and 'twas rumored a
Tech gal had made the grade and would lead the
dance. All rumors—no such thing, for January
14th found the “annual" Flower Ball in full swing.
Corsages of every color, type and description, were
there—fro1n which each of the fair sex was to make
her choice. Then ball favors of silver corsage pins
bearing the Pitt seal topped each one—quite the
tops,—oh, but just Flower Ball style. Unique pro-
grams, small minatures of “Life" magazine, en-
titled "Life goes to the Prom”, were handed each
couple. The ﬁrst pages featured single cuts or
Chairman Bud Mayer and his Tech ﬂame Hilda
Boreman, the cuts of Business Manager Bob Dan-
nies, and his partner Bobbie O’Donnell. Through-
out the program ran stories and pictures of the
various Prom committees, making it truly different
from the usual type. But the main ball room proved
a triumph in decorations. Delighted dancers found
the walls covered with smilax and wax and crepe
paper roses in crimson and gold, rich chrysanthe-
mums in bronze, lemon yellow and russet. The
gleaming satins and the lush velvets of the feminine

dancers contrasting with the smart black and white
of their escorts attire, the faint scent of the decora-
tions, proved a worthy background for Bob Cros-
by’s swing band. The success of the dance exceeded
even the committees expectations for they ran out
of both favors and programs by the middle of the
evening. Bob Crosby was probably glad of the
shortage, for he was kept busy signing programs
all evening. Long before the evening was over it
was quite evident that Pitt's “traditional Flower
Ball" was here to stay.

SORORS STAGE TRADITIONAL
PANHEL BALL

Fraternity women continued their “rep” for
putting on Pitt’s smoothest dances, at the Panhel
Ball this year. Once again Pitt's beauty brought
forth the most popular of Pitt “eds" to make
their dance the tops. Chairman, Vivien Roberts,
produced her ﬁance, Dick Bell (graduate of Prince-
ton) to lead the Ball with her and swing along to
the melodious accompaniment of the band. All
the campus “big-shots" and activity leaders were
present—wherher in tux or formal—to help make
the evening an extra special one in fraternity tradi-
tions. Lucky Pitt males not only enjoyed a dance
without ﬂattening the old pocket book, but strolled
the campus with wide open coats for the next week
~better able to sport the good looking silver tie
clasps created with the Panhel seal, even Esquire
might envy. With self—satisﬁed smirks on their
faces, they took pity on their less fortunate broth-
ers, who hadn't rated a Ball bid, and spun many a
yarn of the splendiferous eveningebeautiful gals
and swell-elegant favors. Again Pitt “fems"
brought forth off-campus escorts, as sweet a collec-

tion of male handsomeness as any feminine heart
could desire—causing many a Pitt male to brush up
on his accomplishments, and look to his laurels.
Loitering in the corners, while waiting for fair
partners to powder pert noses, and arrange dishev-
eled locks, Ball escorts unanimously decided those
weeks of playing stooge had been well worth their
while, and made solemn resolutions for next year's
behavior!

“HIGH FLYERS,” THESE GREEKS

"Greeks to ﬂy ﬂowered Kites at IF Formal"
headlined the Pitt New; in advertising the affair——
and IF dancers found just that. Thirteen kites rep-
resenting the fraternities in IF Council greeted frat
men and their gals as they entered the ballroom of
the William Penn. Decorated with spring ﬂowers
and sporting the various Greek symbols, the kites
were apparently supported by march winds, at
least we couldn’t see what held them up! Cleverly
(and invisibly) joined together, they were all at-
tached to the all-point silver trophy,——subtle indi-
cation of each fraternity’s do or die race for the
coveted trophy. The spring-like atmosphere was
further accentuated by the soft glow of the indirect
lighting~spraying the pastel gowns of IF sweet-
hearts with rose, turquoise, and golden lights, as
they swung along to Paul Pendarvis’ “absolutely
the tops” band, featuring Eddie Scope as violinist.
Ray N ordstrom receives our vote for the ideal ch air-
man; perfect setting, superb music, beautiful girl
(Elaine Fitzwilson), and there was actually room to
dance! No foolin', we were only stepped on five
times during the evening—in fact, toward the end
of the evening, we actually found ourselves sneak-
ing up on people to jar them—just to reassure our-
selves we were at a Pitt dance! As for that orchestra

judge for yourself; soft music found the dancers so
enthralled they even passed up old friends as they

enjoying. Then fast music—and believe it or not-
the seats looked absolutely forlorn they were so
deserted; you could actually dance to the fast music,
and swing those IF'ers certainly did. Around each
feminine neck glittered a dainty gold necklace, the
seal so cut that it caught the light in little sparkles
as it moved—IF favors. jammed into the elevators
after the dance, a representative of each of the 13
houses, held his precious kite under his arm-
(much to the other occupants’ discomfort)—souve-

WAYNE KING “THE WALTZ
KING,” PLAYS FOR THE
MILITARY BALL

Course WC believe that saying, “There's some-
thing about a uniform," but how would you ex-
plain the fact that 1,000 males bought tickets to
the Military Ball? You’Ve guessed it—Wayne King
was the super attraction, with Val Garvin to help
him out. We chiseled our ticket from a ROTC frat
brother like everyone else, and together with most
of Pitt’s student body (at least it seemed that many)
charged the William Penn “en masse.” The at-
tendants gave one look at the approaching forma-
tion and ran for cover—eVen the elevator boys hid
in their cages. We didn’t blame themfit would
really take courage to face a mob composed of hun-
dreds, each with a determined gleam in his eye,

wait for the “fair fem”, while her escort battled
his way down the line to deposit (20 cents, please)
their wraps. An extra peek in her Vanity, a casual
smoothing of his hair, and they joined the stream
headed for the main ball room and Wayne King.
Greeted at the door by Chairman Joseph Sobkoviak
and the charming Betty Teal, each couple re-
ceived a gold and white program and an object
mysteriously wrapped in white tissue paper—the
favor. Of course we couldn’t wait to open ours, so
held up the rest of the line While we investigated,
and found—a dainty white oblong compact crested
with the military department's golden seal. Tuck-
ing it safely away in their escort's pockets, eager
dancers pressed into the main ballroom and looked
with dismay at the jam session milling about the
ﬂoor. No one could dance, so we joined the others
in shifting from one foot to the other, while ab-

sorbing Wayne King's specialties. For a breathing
spell, we wiggled our way to the door, thinking
Val Garvin’s room would at least permit us to
draw a breath—but vain hope, the same mob scene
met us at the door. Discouraged, we joined a mil-
lion or two others in the balconies, where we could
really appreciate the band's smoothness. Heading
the year's dance list for possessing the biggest name
band, the Military Ball undoubtedly was a big
success. But please next year's chairman—how
about two floors, instead of just the entire seven-
teenth ﬂoor to accommodate that crowd?

COEDS IMPORT DATES FOR
HEART HOP

Plenty of Pitt males were "burned up” when
Pitt co-eds imported dates for the Heart H0p—but
remember that boys when you're date hunting for
the next ball! Our congrats to Pat Elmer for the
best decorations in Heart Hop traditions. Fluted
crimson and white streamers criss-crossed the
Schenley Ball Room, meeting in the center to form
a huge red heart. Red hearts dotted the huge mir-
rors on the wall, which reﬂected the rosy pink and
sapphire blue lights from the corners. A peppy
cupid poised for action on the white background
of the orchestra drop, with multitudinous hearts
covering the orchestra stands. Dainty co-eds in
ﬂuttering chiffons and nets ﬂitting by on strong
masculine arms, to the tune of Len Mahlvern's mel-
odies. Couples sauntering through the hotel lobby,
others resting in the armchairs of the Lounge dur-
ing intermissions—waiting only for the first strains
of the orchestra before ﬂocking back to the dance
ﬂoor. Typical scenes of the traditional Heart Hop
—Pitt's opportunity for female beauties to do the
asking—typical too for its astonishing number of
handsome males, not usually decorating Pitt's
dances!

DEPARTMENTAL HEADS

Acting as a corporate whole,
the University of Pittsburgh is
nevertheless dependent upon the
activities of its various parts for
its successful functioning. Rang-
ing down through the adminis-
trative management from the
Chancellor and the Provost
through the schools, activities
ﬁnally center in the departments,
each of which represents a par-
ticular ﬁeld of study. The depart-
ments, however, are not the
deﬁnite division of knowledge in-
to speciﬁc ﬁelds, for many depart-
ments are inter~dependent, and
many are in turn subdivided in
interest and activity.

As a result, certain departments
fall into natural groupings, and
these groupings provide the fun-
damental divisions of knowledge;
the social sciences, the natural
sciences, and the humanities, are
all represented in the average
course required for graduation.

“SPRING SWING” COMBINES
SENIOR BALL AND
FESTIVAL DANCE

And so the Senior Ball and Spring Festival Dance
were combined to bring about one of the smoothest
dances on the social calendar of Pittites. Everyone
including the newest of new Cwens to the oldest
of old O.D.K.'s were swingin' and posin’ at Steve
Rooney's "spring swing". The Continental Room
of the Hotel Schenley was the scene of the Spring
Festival festivities and gay red, blue, and green
lanterns lighted the outdoor terrace for dancers.
Convenient dark nooks and corners on the Schen-
ley lawn added to the attractions for the socialites.
In the shadow of the Cathedral, tappees celebrated
the climax of the week's activities by offering con-
gratulations to each other and receiving them from
other BM&WOC, big men and women on campus.

All the Phi Kaps were there in best bib and tucker
to help Brother Steve put the affair over and you
can be sure they did. Lovely Rita Catherman
reigned as queen of the evening with Chairman
Rooney as king for the night. Romance was in the
air and Spring Festival enthusiasts took advantage
of their one and only’s weak moments. This was
“the" evening for the coeds to show off their
Easter bonnets and spring frocks, while the male

l\Iay I Help You With Your Coat, Rita?
(Must Be Spring Fever, Rooney)

element managed to look like models from the
fashion plates of E.rqui1‘e. Bright nosegays added
that certain something to the coeds’ outﬁts with
violets predominating as the favorite posies.

Committee members worked feverishly arrang-
ing the decorations so that everything would be
"spring festivalish" and a real spring atmosphere
was achieved.

DEPARTMENTAL HEADS

The first major group of depart-
ments includes the natural sci-
ences, Chemistry, Physics, Biolo-
gy and Mathematics, which work
in close cooperation with the
Mellon Institute in the develop-
ment of new technological process-
es and products. Pittsburgh's
department of Chemistry has long
been internationally famous for
the noted research men on its
staff. Doctor Charles G. King has
done much food research work and
was the first to isolate Vitamin C.
Doctor Alexander Silverman, head
of the department, is widely
known as a glass expert. Doctor
Alexander Lowy's work in the
ﬁeld of organic chemistry has won
him widespread acclaim, as has
Doctor Abraham Robinson's work
in the ion-electron theory of
chemical combination. Doctor
Otto E. Jennings, head of the bi-
ology department, is well-known
for his ﬁne work, as is Doctor

Samuel H. Williams. The physics
department, under the direction of
Doctor Oswald Blackwood, and
the mathematics department, un-
der the fine leadership of Mr. K. D.
Swartzel, have been doing more
than their share in keeping Pitt
at the top in all the sciences.
Seldom recognized as such, but
also a part of the University's
natural science department, the
Allegheny Observatory is among
the foremost astronomical re-
search institutions. Under the
leadership of Doctors Frank jot-
dan and Keivin Burns, the Ob-
servatory is constantly mapping
more of the sky with its thirty-
inch photographic refractor, the
largest of its type in the world.
In the ﬁeld of languages, Pitt's
English department under Mr.
Percival Hunt, has earned the
reputation of having one of the

28

best Freshman English courses to
be found in the country. The
Modern Language Department,
under Doctor Whitford H. Shel-
ton, includes French, German,
Spanish and Italian.

Lately installed in lavish stu-
dios on the seventh ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, the Fine Arts Depart-
ment does work which is entirely
in keeping with its physical en-
vironment. Mr. Walter Hovey
has been doing laudable work as
acting head of this department.

The work of the music depart-
ment, under Mr. Theodore Finney
has been given generous praise and
encouragement by music critics.
Recitals, concerts and music at
University gatherings is the best
evidence of the proficiency and
popularity of the Glee Club, the
band and the orchestra.

a light bulb

worth pennies
0 0 0  
apparatus

TO MAKE a thing as it is 111ade just now, and to keep on making
it the same way, is not specially difficult. But no matter what you
buy—a light bulb worth pennies or x-ray apparatus—you expect
it to be just a little better each year, to get a little more for your
money, greater value. We are not standing still. If we did, we'd
die of dry-rot. 0 But there are always cross-roads and detours,
particularly in a fairly new science where every step is an explo-
ration. To get back each time on the road heading forward takes
experience, resources, courage. Which is the reason why Westing-
house makes x-ray equipment. 0 Having those essential qualiﬁca-
tions, it would not be true to the conﬁdence you place in it, if
Westinghouse did not put them to work to ﬁnd ways of making
x-ray apparatus better each year, which gives you more for your
money, greater value. And in doing so, to help you serve the sick
better, to be of greater value to your community and to contribute
more to the health of America. Westinghouse X-liay Company, Inc.,

“Is THIS PRODUCT COUNCIL-ACCEPTED”

This is the first question many physicians ask
the detail man, when a new product is presented

It the detail man answers, “No," the doctor saves time by saying, “Come around again when the
Council accepts your product.” -

If the detail man answers, “Yes," the doctor knows that the composition of the product has been
carefully verified, and that members of the Council have scrutinized the label, weighed the evidence,
checked the claims, and agreed that the product merits the confidence of the physician. The doctor
can ask his own questions, and make his own decision about using the product, but not only has he
saved himself a vast amount of time but he has derived the benefit of a fearless, expert, fact-finding
body whose sole purpose is to protect him and his patient.

No one physician, even if he were qualified, could afford to devote so much time and study to every
new product. His Council renders this service for him, freely. Nowhere else in the world is there a
group that performs the functions so ably served by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry and the
Council on Foods.

Mead Johnson & Company cooperates with both Councils, not because we have to but because! we
want to. Our detail men can always answer you, “Yes, this Mead Product is Council-Accepted."

Dextri-Maltose, Pablum, Oleum Percomorphum and
 all other Mead Products are Council-Accepted.

THE I938 FORD V-8
plays the leading role in

THE LOW PRICE FIELD

MAYBE We should say “leading -roles.” For, although there is only one Ford standard of
value, there are two Ford V-8 cars this year.

The DeLuxe and the Standard diﬁer in appearance, appointments and price. The DeLuxe
emphasizes luxury, the Standard economy. But both cars bring you the same basic Ford
advantagesﬁboth are a real advance over the 1937 Ford V-8, which won the enthusiastic
approval of American motorists for economy and performance.

It’s easy to own a 1938 Ford V-8—and you’ll be proud to drive The Quality Car in the

OMMENCEMENT DAY will be one of the proudest moments in your life. For on this day you will stand on

the threshold of a new career and dedicate your life’s work to a noble and humanitarian cause . . . the
practice of dentistry.

Another proud moment will be when you open your ﬁrst office and welcome your ﬁrst patients. And here
is the moment when your professional reputation will be established.

Even before you have an opportunity to say, “Open wide, please,” these “ﬁrst” patients will be forming
deﬁnite opinions about you . . . opinions that will be based on two things . . . First, the appearance of your
oﬁice and secondly, your Personality and outward expression of faith in your chosen Profession.

With 87% of “ﬁrst impressions” being lasting ones, it is important therefore that you give careful considera-
tion to your oﬂice surroundings, especially your operating room equipment. Patients expect and demand
modern dentistry in clean, modern surroundings today, and most of them will seek out dentists who can
measure up to these requirements.

So, don't run the risk of condemning your practice to mediocrity or failure when it is so easy to “set the
stage” for a successful career with the equipment that
has helped so many young dentists off to a successful
start.

WEBER Equipment is modernly designed and built to
give lifetime service and satisfaction, yet priced so as to be
within the limits of even the most modest equipment
budget. There is a Weber Equipment assembly to meet
every Purse and Purpose.

WEBER Equipment is sold, guaranteed and serviced by
selected, “ﬁrst-line” dealers everywhere. If you are not
acquainted with the WEBER Dealer in your locality, write

Heading a list of departments
known collectively as the Hu-
manities is Sociology. This divi-
sion of the University, under the
direction of Doctor M. C. Elmer,
has been of great service to the
community by frequently working
in conjunction with the Pitts-
burgh Chamber of Commerce
when any sort of census or other
ofhcial survey was made. The
graduate courses in Sociology
work go hand in hand with the
Buhl Foundation, for the better-
ment of Pittsburgh life. Another
highly important section of the
Humanities are the courses in Psy-
chology. Experimental work
done here by the advanced stu-

dents under Doctors Florence Tea-
garden and William Root in the
study of reactions of children to
various stimuli has achieved na-
tional recognition. The depart-
ment conducts Psychology Forums
for all those taking the courses.
The History Department under
the direction of Doctor John
Geise, has been making rapid prog-
ress during the past year, in keep-
ing with the general trend in all
divisions of the University. The
ﬁelds of Economics and Political
science are highly important be-
cause of their investigation of the
various governmental changes
taking place the world over.
Sponsoring the bureau of Business
Research, at the University are
the departments of Accounting,
Commercial Education, and Busi-
ness Law. The bureau is constant-
ly watching the business level and
trading activity in this locality
in an attempt to assist the business
houses with their problems.

Achieving wider recognition
than the University of which they
are a part, the members of our
faculty have earned not only the
respect of noted educators in simi-
lar ﬁelds all over the nation, but
the high regard of their own stu-
dents as well. Their character,
integrity and high ideals are as
much a part of their reputation to
us as their greatest academic
achievements.

Nearly all colleges and universities en-
courage the development of active alumni
organizations, for they know the value of
alumni good will and support. The need
for close and understanding co-operation
between an educational institution and its
graduates has been demonstrated so often
and in so many ways that, viewed objec-
tively, the cultivation of effective alumni
relations is just good business. It is good
business, too, for the alumni because they
beneﬁt accordingly if their constructive ef-
forts contribute to the development of the
school and increase its prestige. A college
degree is no better than the institution that
grants that degree.

organization—and the only organization—
that represents more than 20,000 graduates
of the various schools of the University.
The object of the Association, as stated in
its constitution, is “to promote the welfare
and interests of the University of Pitts-
burgh and its alumni, to foster close co-
operation between alumni and the Univer-
sity, and to support and advance the cause
of higher education.

The Association keeps its members in-
formed about University and alumni af-
fairs; it promotes the friendships and asso-
ciations of student days; it seeks to protect
the interests of the University and of its
faculty, students, and alumni. The Asso-
ciation, with more than 4,000 members,

has become a powerful, constructive civic
force.

Members of the General Alumni Asso-
ciation automatically become members of
the Constituent alumni association repre-
senting the school from which they were
graduated. There are nine such constituent
associations—Alumnae, Business Adminis-
tration, The College, Dentistry, Education
and Graduate, Engineering and Mines,
Law, Medicine, and Pharmacy.

The governing body of the General
Alumni Association is Alumni Council.
The Council consists of three elected dele-
gates from each of the constituent associa-
tions, elected delegates from qualiﬁed Pitt
Clubs, and the elected oﬁicers of the Gen-
eral Alumni Association. Members of the
Alumni Council are appointed to one or
more of the following committees: Ways
and means, ﬁnance, alumni publications,
program, relations with undergraduates,
alumni education, membership, publicity,
alumni fund, executive, constitution and
by-laws, alumni headquarters, relations
with constituent associations andclubs,
and alumni homecoming.

In populous centers Pitt Clubs are char-
tered by Alumni Council to hold regular
meetings and to work in the interest of the
University. The oldest of these Clubs was
formed in 1914. Clubs are now active or
are in the process of organization in Beaver
County, Blair County, Chicago, Connells—
ville, Erie, Harrisburg, Indiana County,
Lackawanna County, Lehigh Valley, Mc-
Kean County, McKeesport, Mercer, New
jersey, New York, Philadelphia, Southern
California, Westmoreland County, and
Youngstown.

The Association sponsors a number of
social events, including the Homecoming
Smoker, the Charter Day Ball, and the
Alumni Day program during Commence-
ment Week. The constituent school asso-
ciations have their own programs and meet
frequently during the year.

The oﬂﬁcal publication of the General
Alumni Association, the Alumni Review, an
illustrated news magazine, is published
nine times a year.

The Men’s Placement Bureau co-operates
with the Alumni Association in placing
alumni in touch with prospective em-
ployers.

At the Banquet Beginning the Alumni Membership Campaign

Miss McLaughlin and Miss Rush, assistant deans of
women, chatting in the Commons Room.

Perched high on Alumni hillside, for eighteen
years, Heinz House has been the center of all
women's activities at Pitt. The attractive offices
of the Dean of Women were formerly found here,
together with a spacious kitchen and reception
room, ruled over by the much beloved Mrs. Foster.
In 1938 the offices of the Dean of Women moved
to the twelfth floor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. Yet Heinz House still represents the real
atmosphere of Pitt to the daughters of the Uni-
versity, for here, grouped around the huge ﬁreplace
—sipping tea and munching cookies—true friend-
ships are made and conﬁdences exchanged.

Dean Thyrsa W. Amos successfully personalizes
education for every woman of the University—
from the bewildered freshman to the distinctive
senior/by providing opportunities for each girl to
develop her personality through a variety of new
experiences. Miss Amos was the ﬁrst to introduce
the freshman mentor system now adopted by many
other colleges, which orients the freshman girl to
the “newness” of Pitt. Under the guidance of a
senior woman's personal knowledge and experience
the newcomer learns to acquire poise and dignity.
Dean Amos shares the responsibility and work of
the department with her competent assistants, Miss
Helen Pool Rush and Miss Mary Frances McLaugh-
lin. Miss Rush supervises the extra-curricular
activities for women, while Miss McLaughlin deals
largely with part time employment and housing.

OFFICE
OF THE

DEAN or WOMEN

Seated in front of the Heinz House ﬁreplace are
Miss Scott and Miss Quill, receptionists of the
office of the Dean of Women.

Welcoming all students to Heinz House, staff aides,
Miss Jane Scott and Miss Grace Quil, arrange all
appointments with staff members and are in charge
of the secretarial work of the office.

The entire staﬂ” strives to round out the education
of each woman of the University so that, as each
graduate receives her degree, she may set out upon
her career, serene in the knowledge that she is

new ambitions, and is ever ready to give advice to

his students. His assistants, Mr. Theodore Biddle

and Mr. Robert Corley, may be found early and

 late guiding the student activities with certain and
untiring hands. Mr. Biddle’s time is taken in super-

vising the work of the OwL, Cap and Gown,

Men's Glee Club, Demonstration Block, and other

campus activities. Meanwhile, Mr. Corley looks

after men’s housing and the destinies of the thirteen

Greek fraternities. The Men's Customs Program,

supervision, is a well-rounded method of orienting
Freshmen men to their new University environment.

DEAN OF MEN Recently added to 8095 staff, Mr. E. B. Williams
occupies an important place as the director of the
Student Placement Bureau. Through this ofﬁce,
engineers, bizads, and students of the college meet
prospective employers and make excellent contacts
for positions after graduation. Behind the scenes
of the Dean of Men’s oﬂice, Miss Alice Beatty, Mrs.
Cubbison and Miss Thelma Harrison continue to
dispose of the routine work. Their cordial greeting
makes all newcomers welcome, and has established
the office as a source of friendly cooperation to the
University.

Miss Harrison, Miss Beatty, and Mrs. Cubbison
are the ideal secretaries in the oﬂice of
the Dean of Men.

Pitt men never hesitate at the door marked "809
Oﬂice of the Dean of Men,” for here they have

Planning and coordinating the many functions

Notwithstanding the demands of his own heavy
schedule, Dean Vincent W. Lanfear makes himself
available to Pitt men. He is anxious to hear their

Just Frosh

Dazed by the confusion of their first few
months at Pitt, two frosh of the class of '38
got off in a corner one day and began to com-
pare notes. Freshman Jack proudly exhibited
his bronze panther pin, proof that he had
passed his orientation exam. In turn, Fresh-
man Jill flaunted her gold and blue armband,
having ﬁnally discarded the green one. Eager-
ly explaining the mysteries of freshman camp,
the boy went on to describe the banquet given
the freshman men. Not to be outdone, the
freshman girl vividly described her experience
of being introduced to Pitt’s campus by Pa
Pitt at the Lantern Night ceremony. Classes
changed—so hastily exchanging goodbyes,
they raced off to different classes. Through-
out the year, Jack and Jill met and compared
notes until one day, they sought the usual
corner, and noting each others pledge pins,
were soon in the midst of a hilarious exchange
of rushing experiences. Snickering at the
remembrance, Jack described his astonish-
ment at the sudden transformation of superior
upperclassmen into all around good fellows
who slapped one on the back and urged ac-
ceptance of their invitation to lunch at the
house. Jill recalled her rushing, four hectic
days of fun—then carelessly reminded the boy
that hers was the first freshman class to walk
off with the much coveted interclass sing cup.
Hastily changing the subject, Jack reminded
her that they would soon be answering the
roll call as nonchalant sophomores.

Tapped to Cwens, sophomore honorary, Jill
attended the tea dances with Jack, now proud
wearer of the Druid skull and dagger. An aide for
the Cwen High Tea for freshman women, Jill found
herself wondering if she had ever been as naive, but
forgot this, completely absorbed in inveigling Jack
into trusting her with his tux for the Co-ed Prom.
Safely pinned into her borrowed male attire, Jill
escorted her freshman “date" to the affair with all
the usual masculine ﬂourishes. Meanwhile Jack
struggled with his ROTC uniform, managed to pass
drill, and actually was tapped to Pitt Riﬂes—at
last able to supply Jill with those fascinating gold
Pitt pins for which she was continually hinting.
Jack and Jill dabbled in all three publications—
the Owl, the Pin‘ Newt, and the Pam‘/aer—and thus
managed to get in on the Publications Banquet,
there receiving their full share of puns and wise
cracks. Participating in the political jam session
preceding spring elections, Jack and Jill were both
elected to SFA and found themselves on the
Appointments Committee.

As light hearted Juniors, gaily parked behind
booth counters during Carnival Night, Jack and
Jill entered into the Spring Festival spirit. On Play
Day, ﬁrst Jill screamed encouragement from the
sidelines while Jack pedalled madly down the hill
in the sweepstakes—then he in turn applauded Jill
as her exhibit passed in the fraternity ﬂoat parade.
In charge of the traditional Emerald Luncheon for
Junior women, Jill bustled busily about preparing
for a capacity crowd, all the time mentally gloating
over Jack that her class was the first to boast a
woman cloairmaa of the Junior Prom. A few weeks
before summer vacation, squeezed in beside Jack
at Spring Tapping Ceremony, Jill sat shivering with

Active Juniors

excitement as she watched the awarding of the
Junior Spoon. But the real thrill came when Jack
was tapped ODK while Jill was chosen Mortar
Board. As Jack and Jill started for home, a ﬁnal
glimpse of the Cathedral reminded them that next
fall they would be digniﬁed Seniors.

Back from Engineers Camp, Jack collected Jill
and started for Senior registration and their last
year at Pitt. Strange to say, neither felt a bit more
serious than they had as giddy Freshmen, but well
concealed this under Senior sophistication. Activi-
ties now left no time for brooding;Jack was chosen
Captain of his Battery, with Jill smartly swinging
her blue and gold cape as she marched beside him
at drill, his Co-ed Captain. Semester exams over,
Jack and Jill watched the ceremony of crowning
the Senior Queen, then tramped down to the
Cathedral to collect their OwL, debating who had
made Hall of Fame. Seizing the book eagerly, they
exclaimed in delight for there they Were, the
pictured images of Jack and Jill smiling at each
other from opposite pages. Graduation——clutching
close her own diploma, Jill swallowed furiously at
the lump in her throat as she watched Jack receive
his; yet a few minutes later, cap and gowns jauntily
disarranged, they breezed down Stadium Hill, the
Jacks and Jills of the class of ’38.

AS A BOY stands on the threshold
of his college career, the choice of a voca-
tion may be the most important decision
of his life. In his endeavor to make both
a stimulating and a proﬁtable selection,
the Dental profession offers abundant op-
portunities. The gratiﬁcation that will be
his, by serving mankind, will be an un-
limited source of happiness, the impor-
tance of which he will only appreciate in
later life. The field of dental care is bound-
less, and every conscientious student will
surely find a secure and honored position
in its service.

School of Dentistry

DENTAL SCHOOL BOASTS HIGHLY
ORGANIZED STUDENT BODY

“Here they come down the hill!" Yes,
it's the Dents, attending the football rally
in one huge mass. Or it's the famous Dent
chant booming across the Assembly Hall,
giving yet another evidence of the school
best known in the University for its
aggressive school spirit. Despite their
work and the heaviest schedule in the Uni-
versity—fr0m eight to ﬁve olclock six days
a week—the Dents seem always ready for DR- WALTER H- WRIGHT:

Campus aCtiVitiCS_ A.r.racznte Pmfumr 
C/znmzl Pins!/9951;

 

DR. JOHN S. ASHBROOK,

Profermr of Dental Anatomy
and Denml Medicine

For all their funmaking, they are out-
standing academically too. Under the
direction of Dean H. Edmund Friesell and
a faculty of sixty members, the School of
Dentistry is rated as a Class A organiza-
tion, and its graduates have an unexcelled
State Board rating.

Much of the real work of the school is
done at the Inﬁrmary, which is devoted
entirely to practical work for Juniors and
Seniors. In the upper Dental building are
laboratories for Anatomy, Physiology,
Histology, Bacteriology, Pathology, Basic
Technology, Dental Anatomy, Operative
and Prosthetic Dentistry, Biochemistry
and Pharmacology. Additional teaching
facilities are maintained at Falk Clinic,
Children's Hospital, Monteﬁore Hospital,
Magee Hospital and the Skin and Cancer
Clinic.

Well known for their participation in
local politics, the Dents have their own
government—a Student Council composed
of delegates from each class and repre-
sentatives from the faculty~and their own
publication, Dental R4311.

DENTAL STUDENT COUNCIL

In the School of Dentistry, the dictates
of student government are handed down
by the Dental Student Council. While its
rulings are dictatorial, its membership and
powers are derived democratically. The
body is made up of five men from each of
the four classes. All matters which deal
with dental student policy, or otherwise
concern the students as a body, are ruled
upon by the Dental Student Council.

Last year’s Dental Student Council edu-
cational program was featured by an ad-
dress delivered by Dr. Frank, noted exo--
donist, and movies presented by Dr. W.
H. Archer on “General Anesthesia and
Oral Surgery."

If any one event in 1937 is to be remem-
bered by the University student as char-

acteristic of the well known Dent spirit
it will probably be the Dental Student
Council sponsored and University backed
pre-Pitt-Nebraska football game pep rally
held on Ruskin Field. The main purpose
of this affair was to extend a personal trib-
ute from the School of Dentistry to one of
its most outstanding graduates, Dr. John
B. Sutherland.

When the senior dental students march
up to the platform on graduation day to
receive their diplomas, they will be attired
for the first time in Pitt graduation history
in doctors’ caps and gowns and hoods.
This represents one of the many outstand-
ing achievements of Dental Student Coun-
cil during the current school year.

The “Dents" have always been known
as the most uniﬁed and loyal school on
campus, and this enviable reputation is due
in great part to the lnterfraternity Coun-
cil. The group is composed of six members
representing the three Dental fraternities
~Psi Omega, Delta Sigma Delta, and
Alpha Omega. The Council meets at regu-
lar intervals to further amiable relations
among the three organizations, and par-
ticularly to set up rushing rules which
functioned to everyone’s satisfaction this
year.

The Council sponsored the ﬁrst dance of
the year just before Christmas vacation.
Fred Archer, John Harkins and Simpson
Schechter served as co-chairman of the
affair which was held at the William Penn

73

Hotel with Len Mahlvern supplying the
music. It was a typical Dental success,
highlighted by the rare experience of hav-
ing some engineers in the crowd.

The customary spirited tournaments on
the basketball court and bowling allies,
held sway throughout the year.

The practice started last year of honor-
ing a member of the faculty, when Dr. T.
F. McBride was chosen, will be continued
this year when the annual banquet is held
in May.

Those men who received keys this year
were: Simpson Schechter—Alpha Omega;
Fred Archer—Delta Sigma Delta; Oren
Mo0re~Delta Sigma Delta; William Ra-
towsky—Alpha Omega; and Ralph Berk-
heimer~—Psi Omega.

DENTAL RAYS

The students, past and present, of the
School of Dentistry have developed their
ofﬁcial publication, Dental Rd}/J, into a
literary bond between undergraduates and
Alumni. The old grads derive a great deal
of enjoyment from the enthusiasm of the
young “Dents" while the students them-
selves can beneﬁt from the advice and expe-
rience of the alumni. The student editor
for the past year was E. Ernest Rose, Jr.,
who also fulﬁlls the duties of President of
S.F.A.

The publication is helpful not only in
fostering an optimistic outlook in the
Dental profession, but in serving as an
educational medium for the latest develop-
ments and discoveries in the ﬁeld of Dental
Research. Dental Ray; provides a common
meeting ground for scattered graduates and Members included in P,-Cmrc arc:

oughly for the beneﬁt and education of all
its readers.

Banqueting seems to be the favorite
Alpha Omega activity, judging from the
number of times these Dents donned bibs
and tuckers and made the headlines.

Prominent men honored at banquets this
year by the fraternity were Dr. Isadore
Hirshﬁeld and Dr. Sidney Sorriss. Both,
members of Alpha Omega, gave clinics to
the Dental Society and have achieved repu-
tations as philanthropists.

Early in October, the local group was
host to the Supreme National Council of
Alpha Omega. The affair, a banquet and
meeting, was held at the William Penn
Hotel.

According to Simpson Schecter, presi-
dent of the local AO's, his trip as repre-

75

sentative to the National Convention in
Chicago, was indeed worthwhile.

Closing the AO social season was the
annual Spring Formal at the William Penn
Hotel. Dr. Issac Schower of Chicago made
the trip East to be guest speaker at this
affair held during May.

The Omicron Chapter of Alpha Omega
was established on the campus eighteen
years ago by a group of local dentists
headed by Dr. Albert 1. Wise, present
Praetor of the chapter.

The aims of the Alpha Omegas are to
foster social recreation, to sponsor profes-
sional and intellectual achievement, and
to make college dental training a signiﬁ-
cant force in the lives of graduates.

Not to be outdone by the other fraterni-
ties from Dent Hill, the Delta Sigs are plan-
ning a mammoth Spring Formal, to be held
early in June at a Pittsburgh Country Club.

Perhaps their most important event of
the last year was the Alumni Banquet held
last December. Delta Sig alumni from
miles around tacked up their “out to
lunch" signs and hurried to Hotel Roose-
velt where their actives were hosts for the
evening.

Athletics take a large part of the Delta
Sig's time during the year. Under the
sponsorship of the Dental I-F Council,
volleyball, basketball, football, and bowl-
ing come and go with the seasons.

76

Delta Sigma Delta, a national profes-
sional dental fraternity, dates back to 1882
where the ﬁrst chapter, Alpha, was found-
ed at the University of Michigan. The
local chapter, Sigma, settled on campus in
1903 with twelve charter members. Today
Delta Sigma Delta has risen to the top in
the dental world. The aim of the frater-
nity is to hold high the standards of den-
tistry by inculcating in the minds of dental
students and of dental practitioners a spirit
of fraternal cooperation towards scientiﬁc,
ethical, and professional progress. A poli-
cy of the local group is to provide personal
relationships with practising dentists of
Western Pennsylvania, thus providing
valuable practical contacts for the future.

PSI OMEGA

The Dents are noted for their activity
and liveliness and the Psi Omega boys, by
no means, lack these qualities.

Although a national professional dental
fraternity, Psi Omega ranks its Spring
Formal as the top place in the year’s
activity list. Usually held at a Pittsburgh
country club, the fellows throw off their
white coats and lay aside their drills en
masse when the month of May comes
around.

Leading the trek to the Formal this year
is John Harkins, Grand Master of the
fraternity. Harkins, a member of the
Dental Student Council, will, according to
his dent brothers, import a girl from
Washington.

Perhaps the most prominent Psi Omega
is Ernie Rose, S.F.A. prexy and O.D.K.
man, who was trying all year to make his
girl a dance queen, or so his fraters claim.

Secretly suspected of being a married
man is Bob Gerrety, pole Vaulter deluxe
and chairman of Senior Announcements
committee.

Holding down a couple more presi-
dencies for the house is Charles Davis,
senior class head and Dental Student Coun-
cil prexy.

Psi Omega, which aims to promote the
social qualities and abilities of its members
as well as to contribute to the general
advancement of the dental profession, has
the distinction of being the oldest of the
dental fraternities on the campus.
