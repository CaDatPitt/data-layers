Pitt Program Council is one of the largest
organizations on campus. It plans many social,
cultural, informational, educational, and enter-
taining events for Pitt students which is their
purpose. They have achieved their purpose

, L with ﬂying colors starting off with the second
 annual “Let’s get fired up” bonfire and Pep
Rally. Their agenda also included the
Homecoming Cruise on the Gateway Clipper where students could go in formal attire and
dance the night away.

Most entertaining programs on campus are courtesy of the Pitt Program Council.
They are just one of the many organizations that makes Pitt just that much more fun. In
November, Pitt Program Council sponsored a table tennis tournament and a Twister tour-
nament where winners received a cash prize. There are also many trips the council spon-
sors including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame trip in November and many trips to Grove A
City for a day of shopping with friends.

Months of hard work and planning go into these events. Among the larger events,
there are weekly movies being shown in the William Pitt Union at a discounted admission
for Pitt students. In the spring, members of MTV’s Real World stopped by to chat with
students of what a “real world” experience is like. Pitt Program Council always knows
how to go out with a bang. Bigelow Bash is the end of the year event. There were many
vendors from face painters to a flight simulator that made it seem as though you were ﬂy-
ing through space and time.

There are many people to be recog-
nized for their leadership and determination in
making Pitt a place where students enjoy
themselves. Directors included Kelly Hiatt,
Film: Rachel Noone, Lecture: Delmar
Wright, Leisure Learning: Moran Elitsur,
Publicity: Allison Pauli, Recreation: Ethel Uy
(fall) Katie Fischer (interim director for spring,

When deciding on what college to
attend, one concern is the size of the school.
With a school as populous as the University of
Pittsburgh, one can not help but wonder about
the representation of the student body. At Pitt,
the Student Government Board represents the
students Very well. SGB promotes the inter-
ests, welfare and needs of the undergraduate
student population. With George Mongell (at

of Pittsburgh has renewed hope and

WPTS-FM is an education-
al, non-commercial FM station
owned by the University of
Pittsburgh and operated by its stu-
dents. Located at a frequency of
92.1 on the FM dial, they have a
radiating power of 17 Watts. The
broadcast radius averages about 30
miles.

WPTS evolved from
WPGH, an AM carrier—current sta-
tion which broadcasts to the Pitt
Student Union and dormitories.
WPGH began in the fall of 1957,
when 12 students formed the
Student Broadcasting Association
with the intent of starting a college
radio station for the University.

The group was lead by
Adrian Cronauer, whose experi-
ences during the Vietnam conﬂict
are the basis of the movie Good
Morning Vietnam,starring Robin
Williams.

WPTS requested a space on
the commercial FM band, and
entered the Pittsburgh FM market
on August 26, 1984. This August
will be the 15th anniversary of the
FM format. The station will feature
a huge campus--wide party in
October to celebrate.

WPTS also sets up at the
base of the Student Union porch to
play live music after hours.

WPTS coverage of all
University sports teams is second

In the end of our fun filled years here at
Pitt, we have to look
back at the main
reason we came to
this University—its academic program.
 From general education requirements
to the most advanced level of our stud-
ies we find the patience to step back
and focus on the most important
aspects. For some, academics are the
hardest aspects of the college experi-
   ence. For others, it isthe mostdifficult.
   As students now and after college, we

at  haveto takewhatwe have learned and
 apply it to our everyday lifestyles.
Hopefully, what we have gained here
stays first in our minds.

books for five different classes. It always seems that each
book they are looking for is in a separate corner of the room.
Running from one end to the other can be extremely frus-
trating especially when there are hundreds of other stu-
dents that are doing the same thing.

Possibly the most frustrating thing of all is when
your class is cross-listed in another department. In this case
the student has to check at least two different spots to find
one book. The book could be in both spots or in neither,

pending the availability of the book.
All in all, a successful book search will start a stu-
dent's semester off on the right foot.

- though cancelled classes may seem to be a bless-

may become disgruntled because of the hassle of waking
up at seven o'clock, just after going to sleep a mere three

when the class is at eight and the trek is from Towers to

because one class was cancelled perhaps it is not worth
getting up for any other ones.

On the other hand, cancelled classes are generally
blessings in disguise. Many times the cancelled class
comes when a student, least expects it and usually puts a
smile on most students faces.

does not realize this at first, and so they just keep putting off
the work until they can get to it. The books keep piling up
and finally one Sunday night the freshmen goes to do his or

books that has continued to grow in front of them. The
thought of doing all that work is overwhelming. The fresh-
men learn the hard way, what sophomores, juniors and
seniors learned in their freshman year ...they must
STUDY!!!! And studying is what they do, whether it's in the
dorms or the library, or if it is on the Cathedral lawn on a

: University of Pittsburgh is unique to many other uni-
that it does not have a physical education requirement
education credit. However, many students still feel the
ways to stay in shape. Sometimes going to the gym just
h motivation to workout. In order to accomodate the
o feel that going to the gym is just a waste of time, the
ffers a number of physical education courses for credit
to . éents. These courses range from the common aerobics and
basketball to classes such as basketball officiating and kickboxing.
No matter which course the student decides to take, they will be
assured of a physically challenging class.

Since there are several different classes to choose from, stu-
dents are certain to find something to fit their needs. There is no
need for the student to worry about not finding a class because of
their skill level. The fitness classes offered by the university range
from introductory courses for the student who just wants to try
something new to the high level fitness classes for the All-American
athelete. If there is a desire to take a physical education course then
there is no reason not to try it.

ps and Internships are one of the biggest con-
y student's mind. After all, what company is
hire someone who has no experience in the
~ orld? Students are nervous going into these
, but they always come out with a positive
‘ » what they are going to do in their future.

. University of Pittsburgh offers a number of
4 grams, and many times a year the university
has an internship fair where students can meet employers
and ask not only what they can expect to do there, but
what is expected of the student. At Pitt, the most well
known co-op program is through the School of
Engineering. In this program the student will school for
a semester and then go off and work with a company for
a semester. This may result in a summer course, but the
job experience is well worth the effort. Most of the intern-
ships are done by students over the summer. The main
difference between an internship and a co-op is that in an
internship, if the correct paper work is filled out, the stu-
dent will receive credit hours for his or her work.

Cultural Anthropology to Africana and Urban Studies.
These classes are available to students of any major, and
they can even be used to fulfill general education require-
ments. Because of the wide array of classes, students are
able to learn about different cultures, ideas, and beliefs of
various peoples. Many students find out for the first time
that diverse life does indeed exist outside the boundaries of
their homes.

Diversity makes the University of Pittsburgh a
unique place and contributes to its academic experience
considerably. There are many things that a student can
learn in this type of environment.

Sometimes during the spring term finals, the weather is nice
enough so that students can at least study in the sunshine.

Coffee shops double their profits during finals’ week
because students are pulling all—nighters and need the extra caffeine
boost to keep them going. The lines in the cafeteria to grab your
food and go increase by a mile as students rush downstairs to grab
something to soothe their stomachs before they cram some more
chemistry into their head. Most will agree that finals are not the
best part of getting a college education, but once the week is over,
it is a relief to all.

             Off to the
IREAL WORLD
                           By Corrine Rushkowski
      SMany people have told us about
                  the REAL WORLD.
1 Seniors         We talked about it,
                  we might have even
  S    ventured into it, but only for a visit.
       Now it is time for our graduating
       seniors to go out and face this REAL
       WORLD thatour parents havetold
       us so much about. It is time to make
       idecisions about our careers,
       lifestyles and more that have
     inever crossed our minds in the
     g past. It is a crazy world out there.
     i  ur seniors now get the chance to
      put all the experience and knowl S-    edqe qained here at Pitt to the test.

There comes a time in
almost every student's
life when you just have to
leave those dorms and
venture out into the
unknown world of
off—campus apartments!'

 

  
 

Welcome to the
  real world  time
  to be responsible
for your own
cooking, cleaning,
and monthly
bills!!!

    In only a few years, we are well on

                  us are grateful

    some, our entire career here. So,

    come back. This city will be ready

Id be complete without a
devoted to the most
widely documented scandal in the ecade? In 1992,
Democrat William Jefferson Clinton, then Governor of
Arkansas, was elected as our 42nd Dresicent. The
Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, as most peo- e -now it, is definitely someting that everyone has an opinion on. I will
attempt to impart the facts to you m _ie most unbiased way
I can so that -'uture generations can re lect as we do on this
ridiculous situation and understand w ien their grandparents
begin, "Let me tell you the story of what the president was like back when I was in college..."
       The question now is: Where to begin? Most of this affair occurred during Clinton's second term as president, but its real beginnings are back in 1994. Paula Jones filed a lawsuit against the President, alleging that he
sexually harassed her in a Little Roc, hotel room while he was still Governor of Arkansas. It wasn't until 1997
that things began to heat up. If it weren't for the U.S. Supreme Court's cecision not to delay Jones' suit until after
Clinton was out of office, I wou d iave two more pages to fill in this yearbook
       On December 5, 1997 Monica Lewinsky, an intern at the White House. appeared on Jones witness list.
She was subpoenaed on December 9 to produce gifts given to ier by Presicen. Clinton. In ea y 1998,
Indepencent Council Kenneth Starr was called into investigate tie -ewinsky matter.
       Asked about Monica Lewinsky,?resident Clinton deniec having any relations with her 5Iree times: at a
deposition for the Jones case on January 17, publicly on January 2, and in a news conference on January 26. On
April 1, the sexual harassment case filec by Paula Jones was dismissed.
       A turning point in this matter was on July 28 when Monica agreed to give testimony against Clinton in
return for immunity from prosecution. On July 29, Clinton agreed to give a video-taped deposition about his relationship with Lewinsky. It wasn't until August 17, eight months after ie denied having a relationship with Monica

of 1997. There were several sexual encounters according to
Lewinsky.
       October 8 began the last leg of the investigation. An
impeachment investigation was approved by the House of
Representatives. The Judiciary Committee supported the
charges, so they went to the full House. Originally, there were
four articles of impeachment. The House approved two of
those four, Article I: Perjury, and Article III: Obstruction of
Justice. This December 19, 1998 the House ruling officially
impeached Clinton. Next was a Senate trial.
       Clinton was only the second President ever to be tried
for impeachment. The other was Andrew Johnson, 131 years
ago. It was decided Johnson not be removed from office by
one vote after a two month trial.
       Clinton's trial began on January 7, 1999. It was the
Senate's job to try the President on the articles of impeachment approved by the House of Representatives. The trial
lasted roughly a month, ending on February 12, 1999. In
order to remove the President from office, he must be convicted by a two-thirds majority vote of the Senators. This would
require 67 votes.
       President William Jefferson Clinton, 42nd President of
the United States of America, was acquitted of two counts of
impeachment on February 12, 1999. On the count of perjury,
the vote was 55-45 against. In addition to the 45 Democrats,
10 Republicans joined in the vote of not guilty. Only five
Republicans concurred with the Democrats on the second
charge of obstruction of justice, making the vote 50-50, and
thus ending the trial of the decade in a mere 45 minutes.
               Aren Syecter
In one of the more surprising and widely controversial actions
  of the impeachment trial, Arlen Specter, Republican from
  Pennsylvania, voted to acquit the President on both counts.
  He is one of only five Senators who voted to acquit on both
     charges and his actions upset many of the voters in
                     Pennsylvania.
 Senator Specter, however, did not want to vote "not guilty."
    Rather, he wanted to vote "not proven." Chief Justice
  Rehnquist ruled that it wasn't permitted by Senate law, so
                Specter voted "not guilty."
In a press release on February 10, Sen. Specter had this to say:
    "That is my verdict: not proven. The
President has dodged perjury by calculated
        evasion and poor interrogation.
   Obstruction fails by gaps in the proof."

       This year, Senator
John   Glenn  (Democrat
from Ohio) became the
oldest active astronaut, at
the age of 77. His flight
hopes to provide research
about aging in space. The
flight which took off on
October 29, 1998 had
many experiments planned
for the duration of the flight.
       In attempts to more
fully understand protein

experiments    for   the
University of Pittsburgh
Department of Biological

                                          in Colorado
       April 20, 1999. The school
day started like any other. But by
11:30, ir was o -vious that it would
end in ragecy. Two Seniors, Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold entered
the par ng lot.us: before noon and
began shooting. Many of the students at Columbine High School, in
Littleton, Colorado did not realize
what was going on. Many thought
the sound of gunfire must have been
fireworks, a Dractical joke. People
began to fee when they realized that
it was no: a joke. Students were
dying. The shooters came in through
the ca-eteria and -argeted at iletes
and minority stueens. Tiey worked
their way upsairs to:he library
where muca of the killing occured.
Many were injured from bombs anc
shrapnel, in addition to the gunfire o
handguns and rifles.
       Survivors say that ttese two
boys were members of a group called
the'Trenclicoat Mafia.~ They are a
grou- who wore ande leng,h Alack
trenchcoats and sunglasses a t ie
time; they claimed taey didn'ttIt m.
However, many Trenchcoa- Mafia
members claim that the shooters
were only fringe members. On April
20, that ensemble was complimented
by army fatigues and ski masks. The
pair moved calmly through the building laughing as they went, shooting
people   cowering   under desks.
Bullets ricocheted off lockers and
into students.
       Some students had to hide in
classrooms for hours fearing for their
lives while the killers roamed the
halls. The students who did manage
to leave the building were frisked by
police on their way out. While at
least 23 were hospitalized from
injuries (10 in serious or critical condition), most of the killing took place
upstairs, in the library. In all, there
were 15 dead, including the two
killers. Eleven boys, including a
male teacher, and four girls had their
lives needlessly snuffed out in the
hate-filled suicide mission of two
outcasts.
       Those bodies were unable to
be removed, and had to stay in the
school overnight, as police tried to
diffuse the bombs which boobytrapped the school. Frantic parents
were sent to a nearby elementary
school to wait for their children to
come out of the school. Some of
tiem never came out. In an agonizing night, the families of the fifteen
cead had to wait.
       In all, there were over thirty
bombs found on the premises. They
included )ipe bombs, car bombs, and
various other incendiary devices.
Some were timed. There were also
numerous hand guns and shotguns.
On April 22, two arge 35 lb bombs,
mace of propane tanks were found in
the dtchen of the school, suggesting
that the killers also meant to blow the
school up. The killers themselves
were found dead, shot in the head, in
the library, wired with explosives.
       In efforts to uncover motives
police found a hate-filled website
allegedly posted by Harris. On it
were the lyrics to KMFDM's song
"Son of a Gun," released on April
20th. Articles on how to build and
use pipe bombs, and morbid pictures
depicting death were also found
there. The website also had ties to
Adolf Hitler. The attack occured on
the 110th anniversary of Hitler's
birth. A quote on Harris's AOL pro        COLORADO        7_
file read, "Kill em all!"
       School     students   were
shocked that this could ever happen
at their school. Only weeks away
from graduation, the terrible event
had a s iocking impact on everyone.
While taie school remains closed, it's
lawns have become a living memorial to those who died, and flags were
at half mast in all of Colorado. The
school wil remain closed the rest of
the school year, with students finishing out their year at other schools.
       In this, the eighth school
shooting in two years, one must wonder what -he motivation is behind
these events. Only last year, 42 people died in school related shootings.
Andrew    Golden    and   Mitchell
Johnson opened fire on classmates in
Jonesboro, AK. Two months later, a
15-year-old killed two classmates
and   wounded     26   others   in
Springfield, OR.
       As students and families try
to move on from this horrible
tragedy, many schools are contemplating how to deal with the issue of
school safety, so that this never happens again.
The University of Pittsburgh would
like to extend its deepest and most
heartfelt sympathies to the students
and families in Littleton, Colorado.

       The Academy Awards nominees this year were a surprise to
many.   They included, for Best
Movie, three WWII movies (Life Is
Beautiful, Saving Private Ryan, and
The Thin Red Line) and two Elizabethan
era movies (Shakepeare In Love and
Elizabeth). Shakepeare in Love won the

      This year has certainly been an amazing year in sports as well. The Denver
Broncos won the Superbowl this year, again. The team, lead by quarterback John
Elway won their second Superbowl in a row. The Broncos beat the Atlanta Falcons
in Superbowl XXXIII on January 31 with a score of 34-19. The Broncos beat the
Greenbay Packers last year with a score of 31-24. What is remarkable about this
Superbowl set of wins is that this is the first time that an American Football
Conference (AFC) team has repeated as champions since the Steelers won twice in
1978-1979.
       Baseball has come upon hard times in the past. This past year, however, due
to the actions of Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, and Cincinnatti Cardinals' Mark
McGuire, baseball has made a comback. This year, the two were neck and neck trying to break the record for most homeruns in a single season, (67). McGuire broke
the record and holds the new record with 70 homeruns.
      Hockey great Wayne Gretzky retired this year. He is widely accepted as the
greatest hockey player ever. He announced his retirement on April 16. Gretzky
played for more than one team in his career, including the Edmonton Oilers, LA
Kings, St. Louis Blues, and the NY Rangers. He scored 2856 goals, more than 1000
goals more that his runner-up and idol. Gordie Howe. His last game was played
against the Pittsburgh Penguins.

        CriSS in COSOVO Operation Allied Force
                   NATO's attempt to create peace in the Balkans
              Civil unrest in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, has been a problem for much longer than any of us can remember. In
       fact, the war has been going on since the 1800's. While Kosovo is inhabitated by ethnic Albanians, the land is con       sidered sacred to the Serbs. The independent province of Kosovo used to be part of Serbia. But Serbia lost the land
       to the Turks in a battle. According to an old Serbian Proverb, "Wherever a drop of Serbian blood has been shed.
       there lies Serbia." In 1878, Serbia regained the land, including Kosovo. For almost 100 years, the two provinces
       were a part of Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia broke apart a few years ago, Serbia claimed succession and took com       plete control of Kosovo.
              The land is occupied now by Albanians, most of whom are descendent of the Muslims from long ago. They
       want independence. Serbia, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, wants them out of the land. This is where the
       current crisis begins. The Muslims have formed their own army, the Kosovar Liberation Army (KLA).
       Unfortunately, they are no match for the Serbian paramilitaries. On March 24, 1999, NATO began a massive sus       tained air strike against Serbia in an attempt to damage Serbia's ability to pursue war with Kosovars. One thing that
       they are hoping is that Milosevic will realize war is more expensive to pursue than peace. NATO objectives include
       striking military targets in Serbia, including their capital, Belgrade. The first half of this offensive was to attack mil       itary facilities in Serbia. More recently, in the second phase, targets have been in Kosovo, in an attempt to deter the
                                      Serbian offensive.
                                        This struggle has lead to many casualties of war. Some victims unable to
                   ~4- n  -escape their captive villages were massacred in their attempts to flee. Many vil        i' OLY,,  (IT Y''  lages are being looted by the Serbian paramilitaries. Men are being killed and

  our experience, not only at the University of Pittsburgh but in Pittsburgh as a city. Going to school here helps each of us?
  become more cultured. Capturing the diverse cultures in photos and articles is our job here at Panther Prints. With hard
  work and determination we pushed to 110% to complete the University's only official yearbook. We sincerely hope you
  enjoy our work. It is with utmost pleasure that I present to you the 1999 Panther Prints Yearbook.
        Professionally, I have to thank groups of people as well as individuals for helping us finish this book and feel a
  sense of pride in doing it. The Publications Board made every effort to make sure that the yearbook continues after my
  time here. I appreciate their work in continuing one of the only historical documents at Pitt.
        Our advisors, Terry Lucas and Sandy Watt are outstanding in what they do. My staff and I always felt comfortable
  asking questions or seeking advice. We wouldn't know how to use a computer if it weren't for Sandy's help. There were
  so many times I was lost and looked for help. Without Terry we wouldn't have the computers to work on. THANK YOU,  
  TERRY, for everything. Without the help of these two people I would be gray at 19.
        I have to thank Bruce Sullivan for his laughter. No matter what I asked, Bruce got it finished with a smile. It is

       The Pitt News made my job, as well as my staff's, more productive. To them I say thank you for making me and
my staff's work just that much more enjoyable. Their help with photos and articles was outstanding. I hope their staff
enjoys this volume and the many volumes to come.
       Personally, I need to thank my parents and my two sisters, Terry and Jackie. There were times at 2 A.M. that I needed a push and they were there for me. I am lucky to have their positive qualities. Along with them, I have to thank my
extended family. There are so many of us, yet I know each of you individually. I am very fortunate to be brought into a
family that has so many individual characteristics, yet works as a whole. The person who keeps my family running is my
grandfather. He is the strongest man I know. I hope one day to emulate his strength. All the members of my family helped
me to grow as a person. I would like to thank each of them individually, as well as a whole, for all the good times and their
strength in the bad.
       I also have five best friends that I have to thank. Sometimes you just need to laugh. Jacki, Robyn, Melanie, Nancy,
and Kristina helped me to keep my sanity through laughter. Everyone at 3602 has also helped me to laugh no matter what
the time called for. I have to be the luckiest person on earth to have friends like these. My friends and family are the ones
into a yearbook cannot be measured. The long hours, stressful times, and trying situations helped me as a person to grow.
I can finish this year and be genuine in saying I'd do it all again. I dedicate my work on this year's book to the memory
of my grandmother, Jenny Paddock. She was a woman of great spirit that lives inside me and my family everyday. Her
spirit pushes me to take the extra step. Thank you, Grandma, for making me see what I can accomplish.
      This book is a collection of what we see in Pittsburgh. We sincerely hope that you enjoy our work.

It's not all bat!!!
YOU  Wan‘? *0 000

Back when the
William Pitt Union
was still the Hotel
Schenley, many the-
atrical performances
were held there. A
ballerina that was sup-
posed to be in the
show was very tired
. and fell asleep in the
i ..... .. red room. She sup-
posedly slept through
her show and killed
herself because she
was so upset by it.
Now that the Red
Room is often used by
commuters as a place
to pass time between
i  classes, her spirit still
3: V ‘ * t __  .~ ~ occupies it and wakes
- ,.  .4!‘ .. .~ ‘ r’ up the students in time
for their classes. She
doesn’t want others to
suffer her fate.

  

  

/Now demolished, Pennsylvania Hall, was once a home
for what some said were ghosts. Late at night, while
the janitors thought they were alone, elevators would

go up and down and cigar smoke could be smelled and

seen passing many doorways, among of course, the ABOVE: Students studying diligently in the Red Room of the William Pitt
standard unexplained noises and movement. Union‘

LEFT: The home plate from
the original Forbes Field
where the Pittsburgh Pirates
used to play is built into the
floor of our Forbes Quad.
Many say that “sliding
home” brings good luck in
that building.

* RIGHT: If you are really in
i need of some good luck,

A tossing a penny into the
Cathedral of Learning’s

g Fountain can’t hurt either.

result of the bad weather; collections at
weekend blood drives and community
donor centers were much lower than

anticipated. the loss of weekend dona~ 7

(Pitt Stadium...

 The Stadium

(Tfiefolfowing is an exceijat ancfyfiotograjyﬁfrom the 1926 _Q_w__[Year6ooE)
 In the summer of 1923 it was officially announced that the University was to build a stadium on the property bound-
‘ed by Terrace. Lothrop, and Aliquippa streets. This gigantic structure would house in superb fashion all of Pitt’s athletic
organizations. Enthusiasm was spontaneous, and immediate steps were taken to make the project a reality.

The first steam shovel bit into the hill on the stadium site, August 7, 1924, and it was not long until two thousand
cubic feet of earth were being moved daily to Trees Field, where it was used to establish a new level. By the middle of

longer than the stadium, a special starting tunnel with a center span of fifteen feet was bored under Trees Field 

feet in width. Its area is more than nine
acres. The field itself covers 3.63 acres,
extending 563 feet in length, and 343
feet in width 

 It not only provides a football
field, but also a baseball diamond, a
grass court for tennis, one of the finest
quarter—mile tracks in the country, and a
basketball pavilion that will hold 4,000
spectators. Commencements, pageants,
and large public meetings can also be
held in the bowl 

 Finances were provided
through a bond issue. Under the direc-
tion of Carleton G. Ketchum, ‘ 16, the
sale opened November 10, 1924. The
goal was to be $2,100,000 before the
end of the year, but within fourteen days -1 l
the issue was oversubscribed by
$400,000. ,.
W.S. Hindman, who was design— 
ing engineer for the Ohio State 
University stadium, designed the struc-
ture and supervised its construction.
Stone and Webster of Boston were con-
sulting engineers. The excavation and
preliminary work was done by the John
F. Casey Company of Pittsburgh, and
the new England Foundation Company
sent the concrete on which the
McClintic—Marshall Company of
Pittsburgh, erected the steel structural
work. The Turner Construction
Company of New York completed the
stadium.

...With a seating capacity of 70,()()0, the stadium measures 791 feet from end to end, almost three city blocks, and 617

In a historic move some have compared to the Cathedral of Learning’s construction, Pitt’s Board of Trustees has given
the administration its blessing to demolish the 75-year-old Pitt Stadium.
"I‘m probably going to have to change my will because it now reads that when I die, I want my ashes spread over Pitt-
Stadium.“ said trustee Martha Munch. V 7
Munch and l8 other trustees voted unanimously last Thursday to bring the stadium down and construct the new
(‘onvocation Center and student housing on its site. Even alumni trustees with powerful connections to Pitt athletics, such as

Months and Fifty-
Nine Games Later 
the news in hockey was filled with
the financial downfall of the Pittsburgh
Penguins in mid—October of 1998. The
financially strapped hockey team had been
facing financial problems for awhile because of
the team’s inability to extract lease settlements
with the agency that owns the Civic Arena and the
private company that manages it. The team's bank-
ruptcy attorney, Robert G. Sable, has negotiated a
payment plan with the City of Pittsburgh, so the
team hopes to get back on its feet soon. The big
questions remain, though. Who will own the
franchise after all the paperwork has been
cleared away? Fortunately, Mario Lemieux
and Roger Marino are expected to hand in
competing financial reorganization
plans to the US. Bankruptcy
Court for the decision in
the near future.

/ i A Seen from afar as a ”crystal
palace,” the beautiful Phipps
Conservatory and Botanical Gard pg
is just a short trip from the Univer ‘ J
of Pittsburgh! Open year round, it's
free to Pitt students during the 
and Spring terms as a quiet place log
study or relax. Phipps features 3
year round exhibits and three seaso:n-
al ﬂower shows, so it's also a perféfct
place to take the family when the?
come to visit! A

The Carnegie Museum of Art located in Oakland has become a
distinguished representation of historical and contemporary art. Open
year round it presents an impressive collection of American and
European art from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. A
highlight of the Museum is Heinz Architectural Center that opened in
1993. It's here that many Pitt students come to study and relax after a

strenous day at classes. «

The unique Heinz Chapel, a
famous landmark in Pittsburgh, is a
non-denominational church. 
Amazingly, over two-hundred ‘:3
weddings are held here each year for
any individuals connected to the 
University of Pittsburgh system. 1
Chapel also boasts of its beautifu
