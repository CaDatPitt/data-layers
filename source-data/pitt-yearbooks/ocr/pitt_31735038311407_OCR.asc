tanding in line for books for class~
es is one of the most agonizing
events in everyone’s academic
career. Well, maybe it's not that gruel-
ing, but it is something most everyone
dreads to do. Standing in line is
inevitable when itﬂstime to purchase
books. We not easy to keep traffic
moving when 30,000 people need
their books at the same time,
Somehow, smooth traffic patterns are
maintained.
However, visiting the Book Center is

much more enjoyable during the off~
season. The Book Center has the most
extensive supply of calendars in the
Pittsburgh area. Almost everyone’s
supply needs are fulfilled at the Book
Center. There's even a Pitt jersey shop
on the bottom floor.

The center, managed by Mary
Banach, maintains a hefty crowd
throughout the year, although she act-
mits that the tall and winter students
really keep them going.

Many students find themselves
here if they need to ﬁnd out what
book a Course calls for.

There is a huge selection of books.

tudying at home is an op-
portunity most people take
for granted. However, Ex-
ternal Study students are studying
by a self—paced method. For
example, completion dates for
assignments are not manditory,
there are only suggested. But the
biggest problem becomes one is
natural procrastination.
Three-hour workshops are
scheduled each term so that the
professor and students can come
together and discuss course ma-
terial and personal learning exper-
iences. However, that is really the

only structured part of the
program. Even exams and assign-
ments are completed when the
student feels prepared to under-
take them.

his past year has been a

year of increased

membership and renewed
pride in the ROTC programs here
at the University of Pittsburgh.
Ever since the anti-military views
of the young in the 1960's and
1970's, the ROTC is once again
gaining strength and credibility.
The decade of the 80's has been
one of growth all over the
country for ROTC programs.
Where not too long ago it was
not competitive to join ROTC
and receive Active Duty
Commission, there are now more
than enough skilled applicants to
fill the positions needed. The
ROTC (Reserve Officer Training
Corps) will commission
approximately 5000 Second Lieu-
tenants across the country.

The membership in the Army
ROTC program has been on the
rise for several years. This past
year the total number of cadets
has risen by some 30 individuals
to bring the total number of ca-
dets to 160. The Army instructors
consist of six officers and three
non commissioned officers
(NCO’s). The Air Force Cadet
Corps consists of 110 cadets. The
instructors consist of four officers
and two NCO’s. Both programs
have a Nursing program. These
programs are similar, with the ex-
ception of the type of camps that
must be attended during the
summer months.

The Army ROTC program has
taken on the responsibility of.
raising and lowering the Official
American flag at the rear of the
Cathedral of Learning. The Air
Force takes on the same respon-
sibility on Wednesdays. This is a
responsibility that dates back to
the 40's, 50's, and early 605 here
at the University. During the later
60's and 70's this act was halted

because of a lack of involvement
on campus and in the program,
but it was started up this year
and will continue as long as we
have strong ROTC programs.

The Armed Forces are dug in
deep when it comes to tradition
and ceremony. ROTC programs
prepare cadets for the formal
and traditional events that take
place when on Active Duty. Both
the Army and Air Force programs
have an annual Military Ball and a
Dining in Ceremony. These
events are like the ringing in of
the new year and the closing out
of the old. Both events are for-
mal events with a guest speaker
who is usually a General. The
cost of the events is quite high,
so the ROTC programs have vi-
gorous fund raising events to off-
set the cost of these and other
costs.

The ROTC programs are also
actively involved in community
benefiting programs. Both take
part in blood drives for the
Pittsburgh Blood Bank and in the
March of Dimes Charity drives.
The Cadet Corps participated in
the Pittsburgh Great Race along
with the Pitt Program Council's
10k race.

Both programs have class two
times a week. The Army's classes
consist of land navigation, tactics,
drill and ceremony and basic in-
formation about the military. Dur-
ing a cadet’s senior year, the
classes take a different approach
called Ethics and Professionalism.
The Air Force program’s classes
consist of air maneuver and air
support, with their senior year
structured in the same manner.

The Army has several
weekend Field Training Exercises.
These exercises allow the cadets
to put into practice the things
they learned in class. They run
through land navigation courses,
conduct tactile maneuvers, repel
off of cliffs, cross rivers with
ropes, set up bivouc sites and
more. These weekend exercises

are fun and they give some valu-
able experience as to what is go-
ing to be expected of them in
their summer advanced camp.

For those cadets who join the
ROTC program after their sopho-
more year, there is a basic course
that they must attend and pass.
The Army basic course lasts six
weeks and the Air Force camp
lasts four weeks. This basic
course jams into a couple of
weeks what the freshmen and
sophomore cadets learned during
their first two years. Cadets are
also required to attend an Ad-
vanced Course in between their
junior and senior year. This
course is to examine the cadets
and rank them on a list of best to
worst across the country. This
ranking determines the career
choices one is able to make. A
cadet who ranks in the top 10%
will have a lot to say as to what
branch he will get, where he will
be assigned, and whether or not
he gets active duty.

The Army cadets have four
physical training tests each term
where they must meet certain
standards. They also have phys-
ical training 1-3 times a week.
The Air Force requires their ca-

_dets to take physical training

twice a term. Being physically fit
is one of the military’s stressed
points. These days, if an indivi-
dual is not in good shape, he or
she will not be in the military for
long. Whenever possible, the ca-
dets get together and play either
intramural sports or they play just
for fun. The Army cadets played
the Air Force cadets in a football
game during the fall term.
Nothing was settled, with a score
of 28-28. Both the Army and Air
Force have intramural volleyball
teams who play against other
intramural teams in the.
recreational league in Trees Hall.
The Army cadets and the Army
Cadre (instructors) had what they
called the “K-CUP” competition.
The “K-CUP", the cadets won,
receiving the trophy, and having

 

    
   
 

a lot of fun too.

There are a couple ways in 
which a student can join an 

ROTC program. The first is simply

enrolling in the program and reg- A

istering for the classes. By your

junior year you must sign a con- ,
tract that obligates you to a ‘
commitment after college. There A

are also several scholarships avail-
able. The Army has 2,3 and 4

year scholarships, while the Air 2

Force has 2, 2‘/2, 3, 31/2 and 4
year scholarships. These scholar-
ships can be applied for in high
school and in college. Scholar-
ships can also be won at the Ba-
sic Courses.

During their junior year, cadets
receive $100.00 a month while in
school. Scholarship recipients also
receive a |ump"sum for books
and supplies every term.

When a cadet signs a contract
or accepts a scholarship, he or
she also has an obligation to
serve in the Armed Forces, either
on Active Duty or in the Reserves
or National Guard. The obligation
varies depending on the type of
the scholarship, and whether or
not the cadet attended the
Navigators or Pilots school. Nor-
mally the obligation is 3 years on
active duty, 4 years duty for
scholarship winners, 7 years for
navigator school graduates, and 8
years for pilot school graduates.

The whole point of ROTC is to
become a Commissioned 2nd
Lieutenant. The road to becom-
ing one is tough, but it is also a
lot of fun. And when the
program is completed, the cadet
has something to show for it, and
something to be proud of.

he difference between being
hired and being rejected for a
job can often be attributed to
work experience. A college degree is
untested, it shows that its holder has
mastered the academic end of a cho-
sen field. But, that person’s perfor-
mance on the job has not yet been
proven.
An internship can provide the link
between academics and actual work
training. Pitt offers internships in a wide

Imagine sailing to Japan, Korea,
Taiwan, Hong King, Sri Lanka, In-
dia, Egypt, Turkey, Greece, and
Spain! Donna Green, a senior at
Pitt, does not have to imagine any
of this because it is exactly what
she did last year. Donna was one
of about 500 students from col-
leges and universities throughout
the country to participate in what
is known as the Semester at Sea
program. Academically sponsored
by the University of Pittsburgh, it is
administered through the Institute
for Shipboard Education and the
Center for International Studies.

“It is an introduction to the
world that we live in,” said John
Tymitz, the executive director for
the Institute for Shipboard Educa-
tion. “There is no substitute. It is
more than just another semester. It
is a global semester which com-
bines a superior academic experi-
ence with a unique sea-going
shared community and unparal-
leled traveling opportunities
around the world.”

Fifty percent of the voyage is
spent ashore while 50 percent is
spent at sea, with port calls ranging
from three to seven days. The cur-
riculum consists of about 50
courses geared to the ship's port

of call. The courses are all listed in
Pitt’s college of Arts and Sciences’
program.

While at sea, the students are
forced to deal with an enclosed
world, but the ship offers a lot to
keep the students busy. There is a
student union, a library, a swim-
ming pool, a theater, a volleyball
court, and a bar.

President Wesley Posvar speaks
favorably of the program. “Semes-
ter at Sea is an academic experi-
ence without paral-
lel in the world. Its
beneficiaries are in-
deed students in the
most ideal sense:
beyond the superb

curriculum, they encounter the
voyage to unfamiliar landscapes
and cultures, by its very nature,
and utterly profound stimulus to
imagination and personal growth.
The University of Pittsburgh is
proud to be the academic sponsor
of this enterprize.”

It is undoubtably students like
Donna Green that benefit from
the program most. ‘‘I feel that the
experience has changed me,” said
Miss Green. “I have a greater un-
derstanding of the political and so-
cial problems that are occuring in
the world today. It has put me in
touch with wanting to know.”

An essay was read by Dubois
Milliones, son of Pitt professor Jake
Milliones, about Black history. The
essay was a winning entry in a BAS-

L sponsored contest for the Pittsburgh

middle schools. L

All of these elements contribute
to the spirit of Black History Month.
It is an opportunity for Black stu-

dents to take pride in their heritage

and enlighten other members of the

“student body about Black history,

The poiht seeimsyto be that if

genough people become} educated
"about Black history the spirit of

Blatk Month should spreadxover

into a Blacktawarenessiwhich exists
in every month of the year.

he tradition of Homecoming
began in 1923, but the activit-
ies and even the purpose have
changed. An event that once
lasted only a weekend included a parade,
a pep rally with a bon fire on Friday night,
and a dance held in the Comman’s Room
of the Cathedral of Learning on Saturday
evening following the afternoon game.
Through the years, Homecoming has ex-
panded to include a beef roast, bar and
pizza night,/a carnival, keg roll and occa-
sionally a concert instead of a dance.
Homecoming was originally for the
alumni of Pitt, who would return to see
old friends and spend a few exciting days
at the alma mater. Homecoming has since
become an activity for the students,
though may alumni still return for the

game.

One tradition that has lasted is the se-
lecting of a Homecoming Queen. Begin-
ning in 1977, students could also vote for

Homecoming
STUDENT LIFE

a king as well as a queen. There were
postors and painted sheets hanging from
dorm windows as well as in the Tower's
Lobby trying to influence voters.

Our Kind of Town, this year's theme,
was kicked off on Monday morning with
students voting for their choice of King
and Queen. This year's winners were loe
Muscatello and Janine DiSanti, who were
radiant as Pitt’s Homecoming royalty.

Originally held on Friday, the day be-
fore the game, the Homecoming Parade is
now held on Thursday night. Colorfully
decorated floats, designed by the various
student organizations, were built accord-
ing to certain standards, and judged on
presentation, construction, originality,
theme, design, and color coordination.
The streets were alive with music as the
Pitt Marching Band and bands from area
high schools celebrated the tradition of
Homecoming.

hen mentor Phil Uher
was asked what the
most satisfying aspect
about being a mentor was, he repti-
ed, “Seeing a student I had in one
o my groups when he was a fresh
man and having him recognize me,
and seeing how they’ve_changed
and adjusted. But the best thing that
could happen is if that freshman
decided to become a mentor
because he or she was so inspired
by’ me, iike I was by? mine." i’
But mentors do more than just
sh w the freshmen aroundthe Uni«
versity. They also sponsor Provost
Day when h‘gh school students
come to Pitt and compete for scho-
larship “We do what the

MORTAR BOARD

Mortar Board is a prestigious national senior honor society. It was
founded on February 16, 1918 by a cooperative effort between Ohio
State University, Swathmore College, The University of Michigan and
Cornell University. Their symbol, the mortar board, is a more com-
monly known as the type of cap worn during graduation ceremonies.
Today, Mortar Board has grown to nearly 200 chapters with over
100,000 active and alumni members. The University of Pittsburgh
chapter was formed in the early 1920’s.

Each year students of junior standing or equivalence are eligible to
apply to the honor society. Each of the applicants is reviewed for their
individual accomplishments in the areas of LEADERSHIP, SCHOLAR-
SHIP, and SERVICE. Mortar Board is unique in that it recognizes past
accomplishments in addition to present ones when evaluating a
particular applicant. Interestingly, the new members are selected by
the student members themselves and only about 25 are chosen each
year.

As a service organization, a principal interest is community service.
Last year the Pittsburgh chapter started an organ donor program. The
program was so successful that it was later adopted as a national
program by the National Chapter. This is only one example of the
many service activities of this highly respected honorary society.

he Placement.Service is one of
the many services offered by the

;,...-i‘la‘V"Cen'l€m University of Pittsburgh to. help
 'ce':ﬂ.,,»«.-re’ students find jobs. Although this is the
53“ ‘W . A main job of the Placement Service, it
-~*"""'M does a lot more than this. The other

services that the Placement Service of-
fers are: The Placement Counseling,
Resume Referals, On Campus
Recruiting, Job Postings, Vacancy
Listing, Credential Service, Recruiter
Mail, Workshops, and Employer
Library. Pitt's Placement Service has
counseling which allows an individual
to develop the best resume during the
discussions with the counselor assigned
to the student’s major. The Resume
Referal is another service that Pitt of-
fers. In the Resume Referal, counselors
send students resumes year round to
employers listing job openings. They
send more than 48,000 resumes a
year. On Campus Recruiting assists stu-
dents with interviews for over 500
companies which visit our campus.
They have assigned approximately 9,
    3,, 000 interviews per year.

” “ Bulletin boards list job openings ac-
cording to respective fields for student
V review. The monthly direct mail ser-
  1 vice, called Vacancy Listings, sends a
listing of job vacancies in education.
The credential service has a file
consisting of the students references,
resume, transcripts and certification.
Another service offered is the Recruiter
Mail, which is a direct mail service to
the recruiters visiting the University
campus. The Workshops are group
sessions to discuss job search topics,
and the Employer Library is a collection
of business directories, corporate
literature and previous job listings.

  

Asking for more details on a
specific job.

Friendly, pleasant faces help
make the search more
bearable.

The 1985 Pitt Panther football season
was another year of ups and downs.
The season began with expectations of
good things toycome but finished on a

The first “of the season;

against the Purdue Boilermakers, a night

game, the first in Pitt history. For a while,
it seemed like it would be Purdue who
would be the frustrated team in the
match. The Panthers came out of the

lockerroom likeawhirlwind, as the o.f~
fensive line ga

Purdue a lessonijielycin
pass and run blocking. The Panthers
pounded out 121 yards rushing in the
first half, and wound up with 234 yards
on the ground when final gun marked

  

the end of the game.

When the offensive line was not

sizable comeback led by Quarterback,

n a gloomy Monday
morning, November
25 to be precise, the
era of head football coach
Foge Fazio came to an end. It
was announced during a press
conference at Pitt Stadium by
Dr. Edwrd Bozik, director of
Pitt athletics, that Fazio would
not return as head coach next
season because “it was not in
the long term interest of the
football program.”

Foge Fazio took over the
reigns as head coach almost
four years ago when former
Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill, who
had a 33-3 record in his last
three seasons, resigned sud-
denly to become the new
leader of the Texas A&M foot-
ball program. The Pitt Athletic
Department named Sherrill’s
defensive coordinator,
Serafino Dante Fazio as head
coach in order to maintain a
football program that pros-
pered under both Sherrill and
his predecessor before him
Johnny Majors and had risen
to national prominence as a
major power in college foot-
ball. From Sherill, Fazio inherit-
ed a talent laden team led by
Oakland's own Dan “the
man” Marino that went 11-1,
winning the Sugar Bowl on
New Year's Day. All of the
sports writers chose the Pitt
team to be the number #1 in
the country for the upcoming

-season. It seemed as if Fazio

had walked into a perfect situ-
ation. However Fazio’s first
season as head coach did not
go quite as well as everyone
had expected. Fazio led the
Sherill-built team to a 9-3
record that year and a berth in
the Cotton Bowl, but that was
not satisfactory to either the
fans or the media.

“We beat North Carolina 7-
6 in my first -game, but that
wasn't good enough,” Fazio
told the Pitt News. “We won
the game, but everybody
acted like we lost. lt was just

 

  
  

terrible. I don’t think you need
to subject anybody especially
college kids, to that kind of
abuse. The kids were so hap-
py and elated after they won
the game, then the next
morning, they read about how
lousy they are, what a bad
team they are, what a bad
coach they have, and the neg-
ativisms just started right from
the beginning.”

The critics attacked Fazio
both during and after that sea-
son but he soon silenced them
the next year by leading a

”l was a victim of over
anticipation and over-
expectation (by the media
and the fans)!’

 
young inexperienced team to
an 8-3-1 record. This caused
the fans and media to have
great expectations for the
coming year; however, the
Panthers failed miserably end-
ing the season with a 3-7-1
record. The media called for
Fazio’s resignation but Pitt

  

  

 

stuck behind him allowing him
a chance to silence his critics
by remaining head coach. At
the completion of this past
season, one which saw the
Panthers go 5-5-1, losing their
last game to their arch rival
Penn State 31-0, Fazio was
fired. Fazio said at his final
press conference as head
coach, “I was a victim of over
anticipation and over expecta-
tion (by the media and the
fans).” All in all, Serafino Dante
“Foge” Fazio went out with
class and style. He has been
succeeded at Pitt by new head
coach Mike Gottfried (former-
ly of Kansas), a strict discipli-
narian who hopes to lead the
Panthers back to greatness.
Fazio is now the defensive co-
ordinator at the University of
Notre Dame.

LATE NIGHT WITH PITT
FOOTBALL

on an evening in late

August, more befitting an
October afternoon, a crisp
cool breeze circulated in
Panther country. Students
were returning from summer
vacations, greeting old friends
or making new ones.
Excitement ran high and a
feeling of anticipation filled
the air. 4

On this night, August 31,
1985, Pitt football history was
being made. Not only was
this the date of the 1985 foot-
ball season opener, it was
more importantly the first
night game ever played at Pitt
stadium.

As various trucks outside
the stadium illuminated the

field, it appeared as if the
night had been turned into a
late summer afternoon, the
lights acting as an artificial sun.
The field appeared bright and

clear before the fans who
eagerly awaited the 7:45 kick-
off time that would begin the
action. The Pitt Panthers
charged from the locker
room in a blaze of blue and
gold, ready for a game that
would not easily be forgotten.
The team was ready for a
new season under head
coach Foge Fazio, prepared
to start anew, and the
innovation of lights just added
to the enthusiasm. The
Purdue Boilermakers had trav-
elled all the way from Indiana
to play the Panthers on this
nationally televised game by
ESPN only to go down in de-
feat under the lights 31-30. A
crowd of fifty thousand peo-
ple were on hand to witness
the Panther’s victory, up from
the forty thousand at the
home opener the previous
year. As the fans cheered
wildly for each feat of great-

ness pertormeo by the Pitt
football players during the
game it became quite clear:
the first night game was an
overwhelming success.

With the success of this
first night game, it was
decided late in the football
season that the game against
the Panther’s biggest rival, the
Penn State Nittany Lions
would be played on a Satur-
day evening as well. The Pan-
thers, coming off a victory
over Temple, appeared to be
well prepared for Penn State.
However, after a good start
in the game by the defense,
things went down hill when
the Nittany Lions recovered a
John Congemi fumble in the
endzone. The Panthers were
never the same team after
that and went on to lose the
contest, 31-0.

Whether or not night
games will be seen frequently

in the future of Pitt football
still remains a question. While
a night-time schedule is rare in
small town college towns,
such metropolitan colleges as
Tulane in New Orleans and
San Diego State play com-
plete night schedules. Al-
though Pitt is far from a small
college town, the cost of
installing lights in the stadium
is high and may not be
affordable.

But whether or not night
games become a reality in the
future, the fact remains that
on both August 31 and No-
vember 23 of 1985, the Pitt
stadium was lit with history.

THE PANTHERS HAVE HEART

The 1986 Pitt Panther basketball
team, a team of destiny; destined to go
to the NCAA tournament perhaps the fi-
nal four never fully realized their poten-
tial. This team played with grit and de-
termination, battling back from adversity
many times during the year. This was
proven when within a six day period,
the Panthers collided with an old rival,
the Georgetown Hoyas (Pitt had beaten
them in the first game of the season, 80-
76). After losing badly to the Hoyas in
the last game of the season, 93-62 on
Ceorgetown’s home court, the Panthers
took their act to Madison Square Car-
den and the Big East Championship
where they would once again meet
Georgetown. Pitt showed no signs of in-
timidation as Charles “the Prince” Smith
helped clear the boards along with
freshman sensation Jerome Lane grab-
bing every loose ball that hit the floor.

Lane's hustle and guts charged up the
team and for the majority of the game,
the Panthers were the dominant team.
Unfortunately, the Panthers came up
one point short at the end.

The Panthers finished with a surprising
6-11 record in the Big East in that they
were predicted by several basketball
experts to finish in the top four of the
conference. Despite their Big East finish,
the Panthers garnered 15 wins overall
and accepted a bid to the NIT. They
were paired against the South Western
Missouri State Bears (22-7), a small but
quick team. The Panthers tried their best
but costly turnovers caused them to
come up short, 59-52, ending the Roy
Chipman era.

This season was marked by several
players making significant gains which
outdistanced the team's disappoint-
ments. In the backcourt, two players
were quite evident. Demetrius Gore,

who led the team in scoring (16.1) and
was third in assists with 78 played with
amazing skill and creativity, making some
unbelievable shots. His counterpart, Cur-
tis Aiken improved his shooting touch to
be the third highest on the team (13.1)
as well as second in assists only to Joey
David with 105.

Between the two of them, they
helped dish the ball to players who
were in position to score. One such
player was the “Prince” of Pitt basket-
ball, Charles Smith. By receiving the feed
from his guards, Charles was able to fin-
ish second in scoring with 461 points
(15.9) and used his leaping ability and
long arms to block over 80 shots, not to
mention the shots he altered.

This year “what could have been”
was heard during the season. After

convincing wins over Westminster, St. Francis,
IUP, and Lafayette, the Panthers stumbled
against both West Virginia and Xavier. They
made up for this by winning the Sugar Bowl
Tournament over South Western Louisiana, 77-
52. During the Big East season, the Panthers
scored major slayings of Boston College,
Villanova and Georgetown at home but were
unable to win on the road. The Panthers also
came extremely close to beating St. John’s and
Syracuse, putting both teams on the ropes only
to lose by decision.

This year was good despite ending in losses.
The Panthers have learned from their mistakes.
Next season under the leadership of new coach
Paul Evans, the team is expected to do well.

I \s the commander of the

USS Pittsburgh fleet, Dr. Roy
Chipman began his sixth sea-
son at the head of a basketball
program quickly gaining

onored status as one that is
climbing up the ladder on the
national scene. So why did this
coach, who has enjoyed so
much success as Pitt basketball
coach (first leading them to
two Eastern Eight
Championships as well as
three appearances in the
NCAA tournament (1981,
1982, 1985) and on appear-
ance in the NIT (1984) and
throughout his entire coaching
career resign when he had a
team with such great poten-
tial? Chipman said at his early
morning press conference that
a number of factors led to his
“sudden” decision to resign at
the end of the season. One of
those factors was that coach
Chipman was just tired of

coaching, which he has been
doing for 17 years.

“I've asked myself for the
last two years, ‘Do I want to
be a basketball coach when
I'm 55?’ The answer was no. I
don't want to be on the road
the rest of my life looking for
young kids who just hap en
to qualify to play basketbal at
the University of Pittsburgh. I
want to be a one thousand
dollar donor to the Golden
Panthers and sit in the stands
and say, ‘What the hell is that
(coach) guy doing?!!’ "

The announcement of
Chipman’s resignation came at
an unfortunate point in the
Panthers’ season. It came sev-
en game into the 1985-1986
season with the earning a
record of 5-2 losing two of
their past three games to Xavi-
er and to West Virginia. With
the Big East Conference sched-
uled to get underway at the
beginning of lanuary with the

Panthers playing host to the
Georgetown Hoyas, the timing
couldn't have been worse. But
Chipman said that it was the
proper time to announce his
intentions to the public.

“Maybe it doesn't make any
sense," Chipman told re ort-
ers. “But in my mind the ong-
er I procrastinated, the easier it
would have been to say, “l’l|
hang on another year, pick up
a paycheck. But when you
start doing that, you’re (only)
fooling yourself. If I did it now,
there was no way I could back
out. (I feel) I'm done with
basketball.”

Chipman had a career col-
lege record of 319-144 and is
92-64 at Pitt in his sixth season.
His current team is the most
talent-laden that Pitt has had in
quite some time and was
picked to finish third in the Big
East. But Chipman’s lack of
timing led to the overall down-
fall of the team. He was no

longer the “boss” of the team,
he was just someone who was
there to oversee the players. It
wasn't that the players lost
respect for him but it was the
fact that they didn't have a
strong leader to lead them to
victory. The Panthers finished
the season with a record of
15-14 overall and 6-11 in the
Big East. Roy Chipman had left
and had been replaced by for-
mer Navy head coach Paul Ev-
ans who recently led his team
to the final eight of the NCAA
tournament before losing to
Duke in the Eastern regional.

Coach Chipman expresses his dis-
pleasure at the referees call.

STUDENT LIFE

s Diving Team does an excellent job to
ng in, yet, another win.

EN MAKE A BIG SPLASH

he Panthers headed into the season
with high hopes due to the abundance of
talent on the squad. The top returning
swimmers include Martin Durkin, Jim
Emore, Rick James, Charles Lersch and
Donald Martin.

Durkin was undefeated in distance
events and finished first in the 1,650-me-
ter freestyle in the Big East last season.
Emore was the Panthers’ fastest butterfly
performer, and Lersch was the top return-
ing freestyle swimmer. Martin, the only
senior in the group, took second in three
Big East events last year and was a mem-
ber of Pitt's winning 400- and 800-meter
freestyle relay teams.

All of these swimmers are very talented
but the best swimmer is junior Rick James.
He was last season’s Big East and Eastern



Inter-collegiate Outstanding Swimmer of
the Year. James won the 100- and 200-
meter backstroke events and 200-meter
individual medley in the Big East.

The Panthers’ talent gives head coach
Fred Lewis reason to be pleased, but he
realizes that there is another vital element
by which to measure the team's success.
“You have to count on your seniors to
lead the way,” he said. “The seniors have
to perform well for the team to do well.”
The seniors who carried the load this year
were Ed Bergan, Rich Lush, Michael Simon
and Martin.

The strength of the senior class is with
the divers. According to Lewis, the divers
are the backbone of Pitt’s team. The Pan-
thers’ top divers included seniors Mike
McCal|ey, Mark McCormick and Todd

Mulzet and junior Jack Shuten.

The Pitt men's swimming team
was 8-2 during the 1985-86 season.
But that wasn’t the best part of their
very successful season.

The height of this year's campaign
was the victory that took place in
Trees Hall Pool February 19 through
the 22nd—the Big East
Championships. The Pitt men won
convincingly and Rick James was
named Outstanding swimmer.

‘‘I think it was a very successful
season for us this year,” Lewis said.
‘‘It was a rebuilding year, but we
were able to have a successful sea-
son mainly because the freshman
performed like seasoned veterans.”

Tired after a strenuous swim, two rivals meet at
the ropes to congratulate each other.

World-class swimmer, Marian Cassidy has

CASSIDY AN
UNEXPECTED FIND

Success isn’t always measured by
how fast you can run or how big you
can jump. The University of Pittsurgh
women's swimming team is full of
success stories. The team is riding a 20-
meet winning streak dating back to last
season. Sue Hickman is striving to be-
come the fifth Lady Panther ever to
reach All-American status four straight
years. Marian Cassidy may not be an
All—American, but she is one of the
biggest success stories on the team.

Cassidy, a sophomore from
Wilmington, Del, was discovered by
head coach Dave Belowich at a Junior
National meet.

“I was down visiting a friend who
coached the Wilmington Aquatic Club”
said Belowich. ‘‘I was watching his
team compete in a relay. It was late in
the morning and it was the last heat. It
wasn't anything of real consequence. I
saw this girl who anchored the free re-
lay for them. I didn't know who she
was but, boy, did she move. It was a
tremendous performance in what was
not an exceptional relay. I asked my
friend Steve after the meet who that
girl was. He got puffed up, and replied
by saying that was his sister.”

Belowich continued to monitor
Cassidy’s progress throughout her ju-
nior and senior years at Ursuline
Academy. Her hard-working attitude
and physical tools convinced Belowich
to recruit her. At first Cassidy wasn’t
too impressed with the University of
Pittsburgh.

“Coach Belowich was the main
reason I visited,” said Cassidy. ‘‘I really
didn’t know anything about the school,
So he invited me up for a visit and I

FOR PITT

said, ‘Pittsburgh, oh yuckl’ But he did
have a genuine interest in me, so I
figured I might as well give it a shot.
When I came up here for my recruiting
weekend, it was completely opposite
of what I had pictured. I liked the
school, swimming program, and the
girls on the team.”

Cassidy is an outstanding freestyler,
according to Belowich, and placed in
several events at last year's Big East
Championships. She not only has great
athletic ability but she is also a team
leader. “Marian is a very giving kind of
individual,” Belowich added. “That’s
part of our team concept. Like in many
other years, the energy level of the
team is greater than the sum of all its
parts. She accepts challenges very well.
She trains hard. She gets along with the
other members of the team. Marian is
what you want and a real good person
to build a team around.”

Not only did Belowich land a talent-
ed swimmer when he signed Cassidy,
but he also got an exceptional student.
Cassidy never received a grade lower
than “B” in high school which helped
her earn a provost scholarship. The
scholarship is maintained if the student
can carry over a 3.0 grade point
average or better. She is majoring in bi-
ology and plans to continue her educa-
tion upon graduation.

Belowich recalls a time when Marian
needed an “A" on calculus and a “B
plus” in English writing to retain her
scholarship. On the first day of her
English writing class, her instructor
advised the students that she had nev-
er given out an “A” before. At the
conclusion of the Spring semester,

Cassidy hunted down and
telephoned Belowich at swimming
camp in Virginia with the good
news. She had gotten an “A” in
both courses.

The coach and his student share a
special relationship. “We get along
very we||,”‘said Cassidy. “He has a
lot of the same interests as I do. I
appreciate his school related con-
cerns that he puts forth to me and
the rest of the team. It means a lot
to me to have a coach that is con-
cerned about that.”

The Lady Panthers are ranked No.
1 in the East. Cassidy believes that
much of the team's success is
attributed to teamwork.

“Were doing a great job this
year,” Cassidy pointed out. “It's
really neat how close we can all get
when we come to the meet.
Against Penn State, it was an
incredible experience for the whole
team. Everybody gave it everything
they had. Whether you're scoring
or not, everyone was cheering and
pulling for each other. Beating Penn
State was one of the most memora-
ble moments of my career.”

If Cassidy doesn't make A||-Ameri-
can it won't bother her. She is a
team person all the way. As long as
she gives 100 percent and the team
keeps winning that will suit her fine.
You can be sure of one thing: If
Cassidy is giving 100 percent, the
team will be winning and Coach
Belowich will be very pleased.

PITT WRESTLERS: GRAPPLING

Indeed with a 9-3-2 record, a final
ranked in the nation's top 20, and two
All-Americans and co-coach of the year
honors, it was a good year.

Head coach Rande Stott|emyer’s
squad finished with a better record than
other teams in the last decade. The Pan-
thers got off to an impressive start
downing Waynesburg 43-0. Then Pitt
traveled to Morgantown to take on the
tough Eastern Wrestling League oppo-
nent West Virginia. The Mountaineers
were no match for the fired up Panther
squad as Pitt picked up its second victo-
ry of the year downing the Mountain-
eers, 25-13. Eric Wertz scored a key pin
to spark the Panthers to a victory.

The team then faced an even bigger
challenge in the ninth-ranked Lehigh. Pitt
tied the Engineers (21-21) and opened
the eyes of the wrestling world. Kyle
Nellis, Doug Haines and Eric Wertz
scored key victories in the match. For his

Wrestling
SPORTS

last two performances, Eric Wertz re-
ceived the Eastern Wrestling League's
“Wrestler of the Week” honors.

The Panthers continued to wrestle
well. Pitt chalked up wins over Lock Ha-
ven, Ashland, Kent State, Navy, William
& Mary and tied Cleveland State to run
its record to an impressive 7-0-2 record.
Good enough to be ranked 19th and
20th respectively by the Amateur Wres-
tling News and the National Mat News.

A very tough schedule awaited Pitt in
Penn State, Bloomsburg and Clarion. All
three opponents were ranked in the top
10 in the country. Against Penn State
and Bloomsburg, Pitt was simply over-
whelmed losing 34-5 and 30-12. The
Panthers had lost two big EWL contests
and looked to the Clarion match for a
chance to rebound.

It was billed as the biggest collegiate
wrestling event of the year in Pittsburgh.
Pitt took its show to Shaler High School

to take on national power Clarion. It
was also a homecoming for Kyle and
Ken Nellis (Clarion) who each earned the
title of Pennsylvanian Champions at that
same school. Kyle won his match to give
Pitt an early lead which it could not hold
on to as the Golden Eagles came from
behind to edge the panthers

After losing three matches in a row,
pride was at stake when Franklin & Mar-
shall and Millersville invaded Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse. Stott|emyer’s troops were
unbeatable that day as the victory-
hungry Panthers easily defeated their
opponents 36-10 and 31-3. John Hnath,
Kyle Nellis, superfrosh Pat Santoro, Joe
Band, Doug Haines, Eric Wertz and Cur-
tis Conner all scored double victories.
The Pitt fans also bid farewell to seniors
Nellis, Haines, Hnath and Bond.

It was now time to go to the Eastern
Wrestling Championships. No one won
from Pitt but Pat Santoro and Kyle
Nellis qualified for a trip to Iowa and
the National Championship.

A great season was capped off as
Santoro finished in sixth place among
the 142 pounders place at 134 pounds.
Both finishes were good enough to
earn All—American status.

Nellis also reached another milestone
earlier in the year. He shattered Jeff
Jeli’s all-time win record of 68 victories.
Nellin erased Jeli’s magic number of 68
and replaced it with an unheard of 33
matches as a freshman.

The final good news came at the
season when Stottlemyer, along with
Bob Bubb of Clarion, was named the
EWL’s co-coaches of the year by their
peers. The Panthers also were ranked
17th in the country by the National

“Over the years we have taken some

lumps in the EWL. Now we have the

These days wrestling is big
business and is rated in the top
five as the most attended
sport. So why do they come
to see wrestling? Why does
wrestling draw 20,000 a night
at Byrne Arena in New Jersey,
15,000 at the Civic Arena here
in Pittsburgh and millions more
around the country and the
world? Why are four wrestling
shows among cable TV’s top
10 sports presentations? I'll tell
you why. People love
spectacles, and that's why
they love pro wrestling. It is
danger, violence, high drama,
and comic-book characters all
brought together in one per-
fectly perverse package.

The guiding force behind

 
“People say wrestling is
phony and fixed. If it's so

phony, why is everyone so
worried about injuries.”

many of today's wrestlers is a
manager. Whether they are
male or female, they are
shrewd negotiators for their
men and some help them in
the ring as well by interfering
on their behalf in many differ-
ent ways like hitting an oppo-
nent with a cane or throwing
salt in the opponent's eyes.
Some of the best managers of
today are Paul Ellering (Road
Warriors), Captain Lou Albano
(British Bulldogs), “Classy”
Freddy Blassie (Iron Sheik &
Nikolai Volkoff), Sheik Adnan
Al-Kaisse (Barbarian, Mongoli-
an Stomper) and Bobby “the
Brain” Heenan (King Kong
Bundy).

Remember that wrestling is
a big business. Well in order to
keep the fans attention each
promoter creates the best
possible cards with his stable
of wrestlers which top the last
card presented by his compet-
itor. For example, Vince
McMahon of the WWF had

had two straight years of great
cards called Wrestlemania 1
and 2 using such superstars as
Cyndi Lauper and Mr. T. Jim
Crocket Promotions, headed
by Jim Crocket Jr., however,
topped this with Starcade '85
and the Great American Bash
last year and with the Jim
Crocket Senior Memorial Tag
Team Tournament, presenting
the best wrestlers of the
NWA.

Many people think that
wrestling is fake and is all
staged but in order to do what
they do in the ring they must
be athletes first. Like Jim
Neidhart, a former football
player for the Oakland
Raiders. He wonders why it is
that everyone was worried

about the safety of the foot-
ball players who participated
in Wrestlemania 2. “People
say wrestling is phony and
fixed. If it's so phony, why is
everyone worried about injur-
ies,” Neidhart told the
Pittsburgh Press. Whatever the
case, pro wrestling is an exper-
ience you won’t want to miss.

      J       he Greeks at the Univer              sity of Pittsburgh have a

              Of the twenty-one, na              tional fraternities and
fifteen national sororities on the Pitt
campus, many of them have been here
since the early twentieth century. Many
of these began as locals that can trace
their ex stence back even further.
There are presen-ly no local fraternities
or sororities at Pi:t.
  The Greeks p-ovide leadership on
campus; they can be found on the executive boards of many campus organizations, including Student Government
Board, Black Act on Society, Pitt Students for Life anc many others. G-eeks
are also active in the Pitt Band deerleading, and in va-ious varsity s3orts.
  Every spring tie Greeks s3onsor
Greek Week, a week of contests, fun
and charitable enceavors. The contests
include Greek S ng, Chariot Races,
Blood Drives, Darce Marathon, Talent
Night, and Chari.y. Since 1980, the
Greeks have donated nearly a quarter
of a million dollars to such charities as
The Arthritis Foundation, Eye and Ear
Hospital, The Family House, and The
American Heart Association.

\ \ 0 Creek!” is the
rallying cry of the 21
fraternities and 15

sororities at the University of
Pittsburgh every September,
marking the beginning of fall rush
and another year of activities that
include parties, formals, commu-
nity service, athletics, and con-
tests of many natures.

Fraternity rush is run for the
first two and a half to three
weeks in the fall and winter se-
mesters. The first week is open
rush and any registered rushee
can come to the parties, and no
alcohol is served. After the first
week, closed rush begins, the
parties are by invitation only, and
alcohol can be served. This poli-
cy, however, will be changed
next year when rush becomes
completely dry.

Sorority rush is also run for the
first two and a half to three
weeks in the fall semester. Their
rush is done in rounds and no
alcohol is served at all. In the first
rounds, girls visit every sorority.
After that they are invited back if
the interest is mutual. An informal
rush is then conducted after the
formal rush and in the winter
term. They are invitation-only
parties.

After rush is completed the so-
cial season begins. The social sea-
son is marked by a variety of
theme parties. Some of the
notable ones are Phi De|ta’s Doc-

tor Party, Pika’s Purple Passion
Punch Party, Sigma Alpha
Epsi|on’s Paddy Murphy Party, Phi
Gamma Delta's Fiji Island, and
Delta Sigma Phi’s G.A.S. Party.
Some, like the GAS. Party and
the Purple Passion Punch Party
are named for the drink that is
served, while others like Fiji Island
and the Doctor Party are named
for the theme.

The Greeks here at Pitt also en-
gage in a variety of charitable en-
deavors both individually and
collectively. Examples of indivi-
dual charity efforts are Sigma
Chi’s Derby Days and Phi Delta
Theta’s Cameathon.

The collective charity effort is
during Greek Week every year.

‘Each year a charity is selected to

receive the proceeds of that
year’s charity drive. Recent
recipients have been the Family
House, Helping Hand, the Arthritis
Foundation, and Eye and Ear Hos-
pital.

The Greeks also further athletic
competition in the sports of foot-
ball, soccer, softball, wrestling,

track and field, swimming, bask-I

etball and volleyball. Trophies are
awarded for the winners of each
sport and then the house with
the most points wins the sports
overall trophy. However, varsity
athletes are not eligible for
Fraternity League sports.

All in all, the greek system at
Pitt provides many activities and
divisions, but best of all, friend-
ships that last for life.

  

 

The culmination of Greek Week is
the Greek Week Formal, held this
year at the Pittsburgh Hilton. Here all
the hard work is finally recognized.

The night begins with food, mu-
sic, and everyone milling around
greeting friends and acquaintances.
A feeling of expectation is in the air,
as everyone awaits the announce-
ment of the winners in the various
categories.

As the evening begins to progress
the dance floor fills and in come the

fashionably late. By 10:00 most ev-
eryone is here and a festive mood is
well underway. Many people now
crowd the dance floor and every-
one seems to be dancing with ev-
eryone else within the confines of
the groups represented. Other
groups who are less inclined to
respond to the call of the music sit
drinking and chatting around the ta-
bles. Every mode of dress is repre-
sented, from tails and sequins to
feathers and leather.

Just before 11:00 the call finally
came, “Please clear the dance floor
and return to your tables.” The time
everyone has been waiting for has
arrived, or at least the preliminary
round. Before the trophies are
awarded there is accolades for
those responsible for the success of
the year's Greek Week. But finally
one by one the awards are all
given. For some victory, for some
apathy, and for others, “wait till
next year.”

Greek Sing has a long tradition
of close competition among the
Greeks at Pitt. Year after year, it
proves to be the most popular
event. This year a sellout crowd
was treated to everything from
slap stick to song and dance. We
saw men in grass skirts, the Blues
Brothers, and Greasers. Also, we
heard classics such as Fiddler On
the Roof. Once again, it was an
entertaining evening.

This years Greek God and Goddess Competition was some-

there was a toga competition, and also a talent portion of the
evening. Spirits were high all evening as contestants strove for
the much wanted olive wreaths. Afterwards, Greeks flooded the
Oakland bars for Bar Night. Bar Night provides an evening for
brothers and sisters of fraternities to relax and enjoy themselves.
Greeks practice year round for this event and in the end, every-

gives each Creek Organization a chance to exhibit their
perserverance and determination by dancing for 24 hours.
In both of these competitions neither the thrill of victory

One day a year, a section of Bigelow Boulevard
becomes the Appian Way, and Pitt's Greeks borrow a
bit from the Romans during the Chariot Race. Groups of
two or three sororities are teamed with two or three
fraternities into match groups.

Each group then designs, builds, and races a chariot.
Points are awarded for the outcome of the race, ap-
pearance of the chariot, and the appearance of the
driver. Each chariot must conform to certain standards
of safety and appearance. The chariots are inspected
twice before the race time to insure safety. Also each
driver must wear gloves, goggles, and a helmet.

The chariots are then run two at a time over a course
of about 200
yards. The
chariot with

   
 
  

the best time down and back wins the race. These
points are then averaged in with chariot and driver ap-
pearance to determine the winner of the event.

Another event with Roman roots is the Greek Gorge.
The Romans were famous gluttons and in this spirit the
Greek Gorge is carried out.

Each fraternity and sorority selects a team of three
members each of whom must consume a quantity of
roast beef sandwiches. For the second year in a row
Roy Rogers was the sponsor of the Greek Gorge, which
was held at the Roy Rogers in the ground floor of the
Cathedral.

The Omega Chapter of Delta Sigma
Phi was founded in 1916, and has been
going strong ever since. Living at the
house they own on Dithridge street,
the brothers have a lot to be happy
about this year. In the last year, with an
unequaled showing of their brother-
hoods’ bond, the Delta Sigs had an
outstanding performance in this years
Greek Week. They donated over 80
pints of blood to win First place in the
Blood Drive, they raised 81 dollars/
brother to win Second place in Charity,
and 20% of their house finished the
dance marathon to tie them for First
place with SAMs and Phi Gamma Delta
Combined with Third Place in Chariot
Race and First Place Team in Fun-n-

enough points to squeak by Phi Gam-
ma Delta and take Second Place
Overall. Early in the year, the Delta Sigs
had set a goal to win Second Place
after winning Third Place in the 1985
Greek Week Competition. The broth-
erhood finished out the year with its
annual picnic in North Park. Brothers,
Alumni and Little Sisters attended the
picnic where the Delta Sigs ended the
year in style.

Next year, the Delta Sigs are plan-
ning to hold on to their Second Place in
Greek Week. Although some of the
brothers are graduating, the new

The idea of Meet the Greeks came
about when several fraternities moved
onto ‘the hill.’ Off—campus fraternities
were at a disadvantage, and this also
gave the smaller on—campus fraternities
the same chance of getting the rushees
interested in in pledging their house.
Meet the Creek is increasing its
popouarity among both the fraternities
and the freshmen. The ease at which
freshmen can learn about indivdual
houses, the Greek system, and pledg-
ing in general is an attractive force.
Since this has been so successful in the
past two years, it is likely that this tradi-
tion will continue for years to come.

The brotherhood of Phi Kappa Theta

The brothers of Phi Kappa Theta
have begun a new lifestyle this year
after leaving the house they owned on
Bayard Ave. After moving into the
complex built and maintained by the
University, they have begun to make it
into their home. Many changes have
been made in all aspects to improve,
especially in the social area. The broth-
ers are trying to triumph over the im-
age of being like all the other fraterni-
ties on the hill.

Juggling pool balls takes more coordination than
Dave Wessel anticipated at a Talent Night com-
petition.

340 

At the end of the end of the winter
term, when most members of fraterni-
ties and sororities make the annual mi-
gration home, there is left behind a
small portion of the membership of
each house. These Greeks stay behind
for a number of reasons. Many are
staying at Pitt for the summer to take
classes to get ahead for the fall or
improve some grades from their last
academic year. Another common
reason that they remain in the area is
for jobs. Some fall and winter jobs can
be lost if the person left for the sum-
mer, others remain just for what they
can do here at Pitt.

Laying—out on Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial “beach” or the Cathedral’s
lawn are popular activities. And what
Greek could pass up an evening
intermural softball league? Going to
any of the pools in the area and then a
party at night are part of the many
diversions of summer.

What ever the reason, the remaining
members here don’t give the Greek

system a rest. The summer is also the
best time to do the repairs and renova-
tions that they can't do when there are
more people around. Painting and
panelling the walls, retiling and carpet-
ing floors and major house cleaning
projects are much easier when traffic
in and out of the houses is at a
minimum.

Summer is actually the beginning of
rush for the fall term. The major activ-
ity is the mailing of rush letters. This
year the list of incoming freshmen, that
each of the fraternities sent letters to
totalled over 1300. Folding, stapling,
and envelope stuffing can become a
major task.

In the summer the Greeks at Pitt
don't sit around doing nothing. There's
always something to do when you
spend it with a good friend like a
fraternity brother or sorority sister.

Dry Rush

ln recent years their has been a
renewed awareness of the dangers in
alcohol abuse. The greeks at Pitt have
recognized their responsibility in this
matter. To aid in this endeavor, the
rush in the fall of 1986 will not include
any alcohol by any fraternity or soror-
ity. The reasoning behind this decision
fell into two categories. One being the
legality of serving alcohol to minors
and the other being of the values that
this promotes.

The legality of this matter is very ba-
sic. In Pennsylvania the legal drinking
age is 21 years of age. The average
age of a rushee is 18 or 19. By serving
alcohol to minors the fraternities leave
themselves open to legal actions by
the state for violations of the Liquor
Control Laws.

Another concern with this issue is
the types of values this promotes. The
fraternities are no longer like the “Ani-
mal House” of a few years ago.
Greeks are involved in all aspects of
campus life.

While fraternity rushing has in-
creased in the past few years, the
number of students actually pledging
has decreased.

 

- Two PiKA brothers talk about their pool strategy.
- A brothers job is to talk to the rushees.
- Ron Theis dips his glass into the Jungle Juice at a rush party.

Your first sight of downtown Pittsburgh catches you off guard.
And no matter how often you see it again, the view of the city 1S
always somehow unexpected, and somehow thrilling.

It could be because of the way the city proud y asserts
its place between the rivers. Or because its presentation is without
introduction. City, rivers, factories, trees, hills, stadium, fountain,
bridges, all at once. Pittsburgh does not hide.

But Pittsburgh is an unexpected city in many ways. A city
built on steel, yet growing into the future with tomorrow’s tech-
nologies. A city that is still the nation’s third-largest center for corpo-
rate headquarters. A city where industry, education and govem-
ment have together created a Renaissance. Again.

And another surprise about Pittsburgh is Ketchum. A home-
grown giant of an advertising agency, getting results for Pittsburgh’s
major corporations for many years.

The on-going surprise of this city is part of its unique char-
acter. Part of its towering strength. Part of why Ketchum Advertising
is so proud to be here.

n 11 BC, people thought Halley’s

Comet foretold the death of the

Roman ruler Agrippa. In 451 AD,

the comet presaged the defeat of
Attila, the Hun. In 1066, it supposedly herald~
ed the Norman conquest of England.

Even at its last Apparition in 1910, hysteria
was the order of the clay. Americans sealed
their doors and windows, bought gas masks,
and gulped “comet pills” to protect them
from deadly gases as a portion of the com—
et’s tail swept across the Earth.

The story is quite different today. The
1985-1986 appariation of Halley’s Comet
was the most talked-about, read~about,
probed, photographed, and viewed appear
ance ever.

Unfortunately the 1986 return of Halley’s
comet was not as spectacular as its past vis-
its. Earth's orbital position and the comet’s
path around the sun combine to make this
one of the most dimly visible passages in
2,000 years, and Pittsburgh was not one of
the choice spots to view the comet. Because
light polutions make it difficult to see the
true sky, any large American city had
difficulty viewing the comet. The best place
to view the comet was about 30 degrees
south of the Equator and in the countries of
Peru and New Zealand. Many cruise vaca-
tions were planned by enthusiasts and by
those who probably whould never see the
comet's next arrival.

The comet’s most recent apparition began
in October 1982, when it was sighted by a
200 inch telescope in Mount Paloma,
California.

Abbie Hoffman's face during
his heyday in the 19605 is a lit-
tle thinner and a little grayer now. And
the 42 arrests, 7 years of life on the run as
a fugitive from the law, and time spent in
prison in the early 1980s have all taken
their toll on Hoffman's face.

The face-the round intense eyes and
prominent nose that helped inspire a
generationwnow has more lines than the
New Jersey turnpike. Hoffman is the
Yippie. His one-time friend and comrade-
in-protest Jerry Rubin is the Yuppie.

Back in the 19605 Hoffman and Rubin
were no.’s 1 and 2 on the Hit Parade of
counterculture heroes. Hoffman and
Rubin organized the Youth lnternational
Party-— acronym YlP, later Yippie.
Hoffman and Rubin participated in sit—ins
at Berkley, took over buildings at Colum-
bia and caused many of the often violent
protests at the 1968 Democratic Conven-
tion in Chicago.

Hoffman and Rubin--It would always
be this way, or so it seemed.

But a funny thing happened to the pair
as they reached the age of the Material
Girl and Volvos. Hoffman and Rubin no
longer shared the vision of a better
society. In fact they no longer shared There was a time, not long ago,
much of anything. “Jerry and I don't trav- when college students in America had

left - lerry Rubin

right - Abby Hoffman

bottom - The show was very popular, many stu-
dents lined up to see it.

Today, Hoffman is quick to point out
that not everybody in the 19605 was so
radical. “What you have to remember is
that student life has traditionally been
very conservative. The '60s were a fluke.
The majority of students were not in-
volved with the protests. In a poll taken in
1968, which is probably thought of as the 1
year the whole movement was at its
peak, Richard Nixon and John Wayne
were the. two most popular men on
campus."

To underscore his point he added, ‘‘It
was never our generation that did
everything, but a few leaders who cared
enough to do something.”

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  

  
 

Jerry Rubin is not one to deny the
ever-passing parade of years and the
effect that time can have on even the
most die-hard radical. Currently on a
debate tour with Abbie Hoffman,
Rubin has become a full-fledged mem-
ber of the establishment he fought so
hard against in
the 19605. Along
with dropping
the idealistic lan-
guage of the
1960s, he has
also dropped
from his list of
friends one-time
ally Abbie Hoffman.

Rubin’ came to the attention of the
public during the mid—1960s when he
began organizing anti-Vietnam War
rallies. Before that, he was a student,
businessman and a reporter for a
newspaper in Cincinnati.

      
 

“All people
who are active
today are in-
fluenced by the
’60s, knowing
that authority
can be chal-
lenged success-
fully. Little peo-
ple, poor people
know they can win the lottery, but that's
bullshit. They don’t think they can win
against Philadelphia Electric, against banks,
against DOW Chemical. I know they can
win,” Hoffman said.

By Bob Travers, The Pitt News

“l believed in the ‘never trust
anyone over 30’ ideal because I
was a participant in the using of
the culture.”

The volunteers had to attend an educa- e

now includes over 400 children as well as
a great number of volunteers, facilitators,

planning by ambitious Pitt students went
into this year’s festival. A few of the
booths included Theta Beta’s Penny Pitch,

PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE

r. Roger Benjamin became
Provost at the University of
Pittsburgh in 1983. He is a P0-
litical Scientist and has written widely
on subjects of comparative political
economy, public policy, and the poli-
tics of postindustrial society—The
United States, Japan and Britain.
Benjamin studied written docu-
ments and met with numerous peo-
ple. He finds his job of setting aca-
demic priorities to be challenging. Dr.
Benjamin has committed himself to
establishing academic priorities as
long as he feels they are moving in
the right direction. By moving into

Provost
ACADEMICS

new areas and building up some
areas that are seen as having high
merit, the University can make sub-
stantial progress in the next few
years.

The planning brings about a better
sense of what the institution is all
about. The fundamental reason why
the institution exists is to teach so the
quality of the undergraduate program
must to raised.

The Provost admits that the plan in
not without its faults. The
concentration of the program was in
evaluating research and scholarship.
In the future, Dr. Benjamin sees

another planning cycle that will con-
centrate on teaching related issues. By
increasing the quality of the programs
at Pitt, students also increase the val-
ue of the only true resource they
have—their minds. Dr. Benjamin
wishes upon new Pitt graduates the
sense of self-confidence that they
“can be competitive in any arena of
life.”

Nationally Reputed—Pitt’s

School of Engineering

he Schooi of Engineering has played

an important role in the University,

with the first engineering degree being
conferred in 3846. The study of chemical en-
gineering was initiated as .a part» of the De—
partment of Chemistry and became a de-
partment ing the School of Engineering in
1919. The first~Ph.D was awarded by the
Department of Chemical Engineering in’
1929. i

The school is heavily research oriented. it
offers abreadth of engineering programs in
six departments: Chemical and Petroleum,
Civil’, Electrical, industrial, .Materiais Science,
and Mechanical Engineering. Many of these
departments’ have strong national reputa-

, tions. _

Theschool has 110 fuli~tirne facuity. Many
faculty have had industrial experience and
continue to participate in industrial, educa~
tional, and governmenmi consulting activities.

The student bodyconsists of 300 full~rirne
and 650 part-time graduate ‘students’ and
2,200 undergraduate.‘ “ ' ;

Some notabie _ school alumni are:
iohn Marous, president of Western.
Electric and lnternatienal; Charles Perry,
chairman of the board, Alcoa; and Ed-
ward Slack, president, PPG industries.‘ ‘

For students majoring in Engineering,
their identity with the school is high.‘
This is especially evident during engi-
neering week. Many students partici-
pate in this competitive but furvfilled
week where knowledge acquired in
the classroom is demonstrated in

’ events that combine learning, creativity
and originality.
The Skyscraper Engineer magazine
-published quarterly is another way for
student engineers to work together
outside of lectures. The pubiication
uses articles, puzzles, photographs and tie
tional stories to capture what it is like to be a
Pitt Engineer. »

Attracting people all along the Ohio
Valley, the annual Three Rivers
Regatta at Point State Park is one of
the major summer events in
Pittsburgh.

hat comes to

your mind

when you
think of the typical nurse?/
A matronly woman in
white with glasses and her
hair pulled tightly into a
bun, ordering patients to
take their medicine? May-
be you think of a pretty
blond who dimwhittedly
follows doctor's orders?
These days, in both cases,
you would probably be
wrong. Nursing has
changed over the years
and still is a profession in
metamorphisis.

Graduates of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh's
School of Nursing follow
a very structured program
over four years. In addi-
tion to required nursing

courses, nursing students
are required to study soci-
ology, psychology, philos-
ophy, chemistry, anatomy
and more.

Nursing courses offer
more today than instruc-
tion in how to give a shot
and administer care to the
sick. The nursing profes-
sion is concerned about
prevention of illness. This
involves teaching patients
healthy habits.

Nursing is also caring
for the people. This is
probably the most impor-
tant part of nursing. This is
a quality that makes nurs-
ing a special part of medi-
cine.

Faculty perform important research in a wide variety

P of fields. For instance, the federal government recently i

In the medical chemistry area, new drugs are being
