Volleyball
by Matt Grove

This season, the Pitt Panther volleyball
team looked to maintain its dominance in
the Big East and win its eighth straight con-
ference title, but they were greeted by the
addition of perennial power Notre Dame to
tﬁe conference. Things changed for the Pan-
t ers.

The Panthers got off to a shaky start,
losing seven of their ﬁrst twelve matches.
However, after a close loss to Texas Tech in
which they were defeated 3-2, Pitt managed
to get their act together, going on a tear and
winning 13 of their next 14 games. The
Fighting Irish ended Pitt’s reign in Novem-
ber when they downed the Panthers in four
games. In the Big East Championship the

Panthers were again foiled by Notre Dame,
losing in the ﬁnal match 3-1.

Despite losing the last ﬁve matches of the
season, the team still managed to ﬁnish 19-
15 on the year. The Panthers also failed to
make the NCAA Tournament for the ﬁrst
time in six years, a major disappointment
for the team. Despite these setbacks, Head
Coach Cindy Alvear thought that the season
went exceptionally well. “Fifty percent of
the squad were freshman, and we still ﬁn-
ished well on the year.”

Alvear will also be losing three seniors in
Sarah Mikla, Sara Mitchel, and Alyssa
Yanik. “They did a really good job helping
the freshman along,” she said of her de-
parting seniors.

1995-96 PITT CROSS COUNTRY

Stephanie Ellsworth limbers up before a meet

Cross Country
by Geoff Moak

From the rolling hills and drizzle of Miami Uni-
versity in September to the mud of Boston’s Frank-
lin Park in November, the men’s and women’s
cross country teams had their days in the sun this
season, even if the sun didn’t shine on most of their
meets. Things looked bright for the Panthers at the
Malone Invitational, where virtually the whole
team showed vast improvement from the previous
season. The women overcame some tough com-
petition to win the meet by eight points over de-
fending champion Youngstown State.

The shining moment for the men’s squad came
at the Saint Francis Invitational, where Pitt runners
filled the top eight positions, with the top four
ﬁnishers crossing the line at the same time. The
women were equally dominant in the meet, placing
seven runners in the top ten.

The Panthers held their own in the new, ex-
panded Big East championships. They ﬁnished

ninth, which when considering that three new
teams were added, was roughly equivalent to their
sixth place finish a year ago.

“The athletes had some sense of success, but also
a sense of disappointment that they didn’t do
more,” said coach David Sobal of his runners.

The men were led by a pair of seniors, co-
captains Frank Nesko and Dennis Kuntz, whose
talents, along with those of another senior, Mike
Bufalini, will be missed next season. A group of
younger runners, including Julio Ortiz, Matt Sam-
uel, and Ed Adamson, will try to improve on their
impressive seasons and lead the pack next year.

The relatively young women’s squad will lose
Melanie Ishman and Natashia Van Reil, but a
strong core including Stacey Anderson, Stephanie
Ellsworth, Amy Francy, Anna Kohler, and Angie
Martin will return. “With the individuals we have,
we can have a better season this year than last year
with a good amount of hard work,” said Sobal of
the team’s prospects for next year.

TRACK AND FIELD

Alison Baker displays the intensity that made her one of the tennis team’s top players. The teams had one of its best records in years, with wins over long-ti
rivals such as Duquesne and St. Bonaventure, and a “payback” win over Villanova, the team that defeated it in last year’s Big East championships.

GYMNASTICS

Gymnastics
by Nichole Gantshar

“You’re going to see records broken this year,”
Head Coach Debbie Yohman said in February. She
was right.

It was impossible to keep record books updated
this year for Pitt’s gymnastics team. As soon as the
team set a record, they’d break it the next meet.
Each week they surpassed the team high score until
they ﬁnished off the regular season by breaking the
190 point mark with 190.575 at Maryland and then
again with 191.925 in the season’s ﬁnal home meet,
which also marked an undefeated season at home.

Seniors Brenda Stevens and Michaelene Meyers
fought their way back from injuries and into the
line-up to have banner seasons. This included Ste-
vens’ name as Pitt’s ﬁrst EAGL gymnast of the
week and Myers breaking records on the beam with
her score of 9.8 she earned at a meet against Cor-
nell. Stevens continued to push herself throughout
the season, adding new elements to her uneven bars
and adding an extra double back to her ﬁnal ﬂoor
routine. Also adding to her accomplishments, Ste-
vens set an all time personal high in the all-around,
38.25 at the EAGL Championships and a personal
high of 9.8 on the bars, tying Lisa Shirk’s school
record set in 1981. Freshman Janet Highhill also
tied the score.

“We show the talent and skill we’re developing,”
said Yohman after one meet. “Janet Highhill is
capable of breaking the school record that has been
set in stone for 15 years.”

Highhill was just one member of a team that had
a depth of talent at all levels. This year was also the
debut of other promising freshmen, Erika Flamer
and Sara-Claire Campesino. Flamer set many per-
sonal bests this year, including a school record of
38.725 in the all-around competition, and ﬁnished
off the season by placing ninth in the all-around at
the NCAA Regionals.

Other gymnasts set personal bests as well. Soph-
omore Tracey Brown set a personal best of 9.45 on
the vault, while Lori Buck and Joy McElhinney set
personal bests on the beam. And Junior Robyn
Senior broke a ﬂoor record with her performance of
9.875 at a dual meet against Rutgers.

A team record of 47.95 was set on the bars, as
well as the ﬂoor at 48.8 at the season’s ﬁnal home
meet and 48.325 on vault at the EAGL conference
championships.

Tears greeted senior Brenda Stevens after her
dismount from the team’s ﬁnal uneven bars routine
at Regionals.

WRESTLING

The Pitt wrestling team began the 1995-96 season looking
to crack the top ten in the nation. They fell short of that goal,
but kept alive the long line of Pitt wrestling success.

The Panthers were ranked No. 18 in the nation in the
preseason, but spent most of the season at No. 21, where they
ended up at the end of the dual meet season. Individually, J .J .
Fasnacht, Mark Bodo, and Pat Wiltanger were ranked in the
top ten at their respective weight classes all season long, and
several others cracked the top ten at times during the season.

Pitt went 8-2 in its ﬁrst ten dual meets, with the losses
coming to two of the nation’s top three teams. Hard times
then came, in the form of injuries. Pitt went 5-6-1 in the
remaining dual meets, with four of the six losses coming to
top-ten ranked teams.

In a tournament that couldn’t have been much closer, Pitt
ﬁnished fourth at the Eastern Wrestling League Champi-
onship, with only 11.5 points separating the Panthers from
ﬁrst-place West Virginia.

Pitt tied a school record by qualifying six wrestlers for the
NCAA tournament. Two of them, Bodo and Wiltanger,
earned A11-American honors at the tournament, and Fasnacht

*Was one point away from making it three All-Americans,

leading Pitt to a 24th place ﬁnish.

Pitt’s seniors will be sorely missed. Among them, they have
won three EWL championships (and six second-place ﬁn-
ishes) and in their collective 11 trips to nationals, came away
with two All-American awards. Fasnacht, Wiltanger, Brett
Gould, and John Richey will graduate with a combined rec-
ord of 321-165-1. Fasnacht and Wiltanger are third and
fourth on Pitt’s all-time victories list, with 114 and 92, re-
spectively.

Just as Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer likes it, the seniors
led this squad. Next year, there will be some talented un-
derclassmen ready to try to step into the large shoes of the
seniors.

Junior Bryan Matusic qualified for his third national tour-
nament in three tries and will be the leader of the pack next
year for Pitt. Redshirt freshman Jacob Schaus also made the
trip to nationals this year. Sophomore Bodo ﬁnished sixth at
190 points at the national championships. Freshman Mike
Ziska was a very pleasant surprise this season for the coaching
staff. All of them will try to keep Pitt’s strong tradition alive
next season.

Coach Larry Anderson.

The Lady Panthers deﬁned “rebuilding season”
this year, ﬁnishing with a 6-24 overall record and a
promising appearance in the Big East Tournament
semifinals. The two tournament wins tied the
team’s longest win streak of a disappointing regular
season.

“We had very high expectations and only min-
imal results,” said head coach Kirk Bruce of his
squad’s performance —— the worst in the team’s 21
year history.

Departing on this sour note are seniors Julie
Fomadel, Tressa Bolfert and Stephanie Petho, who
along with Bruce spent most of this year developing
the talents of the team’s four freshmen and four
sophomores. Sophomore Latia Howard earned
Player of the Week honors and led the team in
scoring, while freshman guard/forward Gina
Montesano showed durability and versatility, play-
ing three positions and starting every contest.
These young players showed their promise in the
year-end tournament, pulling off two upsets before
falling to the tournament-winning Connecticut
Huskies.

“We think we set the tone for the following year
by winning in the Big East tournament,” said
Bruce. This ﬁnal performance showed the team
promise that coach Bruce hopes to turn into a
winning program in the immediate future.

TITLE IX

Before most undergrads were even born a law was written that
would dramatically change athletics at Pitt. Congress crafted Title IX
as part of a series of education-related amendments to the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. It took Congress until 1972 to pass the legislation. The
law, originally written to create gender equity for women in college
athletics. Yet according to the Women’s Sports Foundation, uni-
versities around the country have developed a pattern of cutting men’s
teams in order to create opportunities for women.

Under Title IX, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil
Rights (OCR) had been investigating the university, and on May 2,
1995, Pitt’s Athletic Department told athletes on men’s gymnastics
and tennis that their teams were being cut due to NCAA regulations
and Title IX. Also as a response to the OCR investigation, the athletic
department announced plans to add a women’s varsity soccer team.

The athletes who had come to Pitt with promises of scholarships
and opportunities to compete in their sport saw the second part of that
opportunity taken away. The athletes will continue to receive their
scholarships but will no longer compete. Notification about the de-
cision was sent in May and arrived too late for athletes to transfer.
There were grumblings about law suits but perhaps with the knowl-
edge that no law suit could bring back their own opportunity to
compete, the athletes stepped aside so Pitt could prepare to form
women’s soccer.

In January, Pitt announced that the Athletic Department had hired
Roland Sturk to coach the new women’s soccer team. Sturk was the
head coach at Regis University, a division II school in Denver, Co.,
since 1989. He was named the National Soccer Coaches’ Association’s
regional coach of the year in 1994 after guiding the Rangers to a
second place finish at the NCAA division II championships. Sturk was
Regis’ coach through its inaugural season, and built the team into a
contender in six seasons.

Hockey _
by Connie Nigro

Despite being the reigning champs from the previous season,
the 1995-96 University of Pittsburgh’s hockey club got off to a
rocky start. Four games into the season, the Panthers were 2-2
overall, and 2-1 in division play.

Pitt ﬁnally got back into their winning ways with a 8-3 victory
over Allegheny. the team continued on a hot streak from there,
using that same winning fashion to bring their overall record to 6-
2 and 5-1 in division play.

With a month left in the season, the Panthers were back on
track for a repeat championship performance. However, the road
to a championship is never easy.

Injuries knocked key players Shawn Goldstein and Ken An-
derson out of the line-up for part of the season, yet team captain
Mark White remained optimistic about the team’s outlook.

However, after the team thought their troubles were behind
them, scoring sensation Bill Elliot’s knee was injured in a game
against Duquesne, taking him out for the rest of the game, and
indefinitely for the rest of the season. With several players out
due to injury, the Panthers were forced to regroup heading into
the ﬁnal stretch of the regular season before the playoffs.

Despite their setbacks, the team ﬁnished with an impressive
10-1-1 record in division play, placing second to Carnegie Mel-
lon. In the playoffs, Pitt put together a gutsy run but lost in the
semi-finals to eventual champion Penn State.

Overall, White feels that the team did very well, “We just had
a lot of problems with injuries to key guys. If we had been
healthy, we could have won (the Division title) again.”

White attribute’s a lot of the team’s success to the coaching,
“We really had an excellent coach,” he said of second-year coach
Dick Rizzo. “That makes a big difference.”

The team will lose many experienced players such as Kenny
Anderson, Steve Fischer, and Steve Wrightman but White is
hopeful that current team members will step up to the challenge.
“Its as much of a team sport as an individual one. We’ve got a
good defense coming back, and some great goalies too.” Next
year’s team should also expect a healthy Bill Elliot back in the
line-up, who spent much of the off season rehabing his knee.

Lacrosse
by Matt Townsend

For men’s lacrosse head coach Gary Neff, this year was his
most difﬁcult coaching job because of the youthfulness of his
team — for the first time since he has been at Pitt, he had
freshman start. Most of the players on this year’s squad didn’t get
many minutes last year., and the team make-up consisted of few
veteran players supported by a majority of freshmen and new-
comers.

In going 10-5 this season, Neff set an individual goal of 100
wins for his career total. His overall record is 106-30 in eight
seasons at Pitt.

This year’s team showed its youth throughout the season by
having up and down periods of play. Pitt started the season out
on ﬁre, going 4-0 and beating their opponents by a combined
score of 50-7. Then Pitt suffered its first loss of the season to
West Virginia Wesleyan College 9-8. The team showed savvy in
this game by coming all the way back from a 9-4 fourth quarter
deﬁcit to almost tie the score in the closing minutes of the game.

Pitt hosted the Pittsburgh Shootout again this year. There were
14 teams in the tourney from surrounding states. In their first
game, Pitt knocked off Penn State for the ninth time in a row, 5-
2. It was Pitt’s best game of the year as they rode on the emotion
of playing the cross-state rival.

In the next three games of the tourney the Panthers went 1-2,
setting up a rematch with Penn State for the consolation cham-
pionship. The game looked like a blowout from the start as the
Lions jumped out to a 7-1 lead heading into the fourth quarter.
Pitt woke up and scored ﬁve unanswered goals in the ﬁnal
quarter, only to come up short 7-6.

Going into their ﬁnal game against West Virginia University,
Pitt had just gotten knocked out of the playoffs with a loss to
Grove City College. There was seemingly nothing to play for, but
the team regrouped and refocused before the game and played
their best lacrosse of the year. They excelled in every facet of the
game, squeaking out a 9-8 win. It was Pitt’s first win against the
Mountaineers in ﬁve years.

Although the team did not make the playoffs, the young
players gained valuable experience that will only help the club in
the future.

Three gold medals at the Jack Speakmon Regatta in Co-
lumbus, Ohio was only a small part of the dramatic comeback
of Pitt Crew. Last year three-quarters of the team’s boats were
damaged in a trailer accident and the team lost valuable
training time. The Speakmon Regatta was one of the first
actual races the team had won since the accident.

It was an impressive start for a club that requires its
members to come to practice six mornings a week from 5:30
to 8:00 a.m. It was also a great year for recruiting and many
freshman took the challenge and joined the novice team.

1995 was also the year of the first annual alumni dinner at
the Head of the Ohio in October, which the club hopes to
make a tradition each year. Peter Alprin and Richard
Zahrobsky, who helped found the club in 1987, were on hand
for the race. Both were excited to see how much the sport of
rowing had grown — only 20 teams had competed in the first

Head of the Ohio.

Pitt was victorious in the annual Carnegie Mellon-
Desquene-Pitt race, which was held indoors. The year was
also full of events that did not take place on the water. Off the
race course, the team lost several coaches but the biggest
event around the rivers was not a race, it was a ﬂood.

Over ten feet of water prompted Mike Lambert, the Ex-
ecutive Director of the Three Rivers Boating Association, to
drill holes in the bottom of the Pitt boats so the trapped water
could move around once the ﬂooding began. The ﬂood left
huge chunks of ice all over the parking lot in front of the boat
house’s bay doors and deposited over eight inches of mud
throughout the boat house, with clean up taking several days.

In the Spring, the team traveled to Florida over Spring
Break to prepare for the competitive season.

“Dear Mom and
Dad, Pfease
Send. . .”

Seniors Reveal the Truth About What
They Want From Mom and Dad

When students come to a new environment, they often feel
disoriented, so they turn to the people who have always
helped them. Through the years, students continue to turn to
these people again and again because they know that is where
they can get the help they need.

Who are the people these students turn to? Their parents.
What was usually the help they needed? Most seniors said it
was cold, hard cash.

“I most often have asked my parents to send me money.
Yeah, definitely money,” senior Nate Feduska said. “But
when I asked them for money to go on Spring Break, they
said no,” he sighs.

If they did not ask for money, seniors asked for moral
support or advice.

“I was 26 when I started college and I was working two jobs
at the time, so, in the beginning, I really didn’t ask for much
other than moral support,” senior Ralph A. Malioni

imparted. “I asked for a lot of moral support because college
was difficult for me. Because it was such a major adjustment,
and because it was just hard.”

Some seniors, like Laura Martello, said they asked for a
variety of things, and their parents usually complied.

“I asked for a variety of things, not just money, and my
parents always sent me what I asked for. It’s not that I’m
spoiled, because I know it sounds that way, but they just
wanted to help me out,” she reported.

Feduska said the most “varied” item that he ever asked for
was an item that he needed often.

“White socks. I asked for white socks because my old ones
were full of holes, and I couldn’t buy new ones here, so I
asked my parents to send me some,” he said.

No matter what they needed, moral support, money, or
socks, seniors knew they could count on their parents for help
throughout their college careers.

Pleading to Mom and Dad
for money is usually
necessary. Let’s hope they
come through.

Where Did That

Came From?

Students Wonder at All the Changes Since Freshman Year

You can no longer eat at Syl’s in Lothrop Hall. The C-
side of Tower’s won’t seat as many people as it did in the
past. You’ll have to make other plans if you want to do
some shoe shopping at the Footlocker. There is no longer a
Burger King across the street from Public Health. You
can’t even swing by Zelda’s Greenhouse after a tough
exam for a beer or two. What happened to everything?
Where did it all go?

While large changes such as these are noticed by
everyone, Pitt senior Leila Moses noted a few that many
people may not have realized. “We now have cable and
carpet in Tower B!” she said joyfully. Senior Nate Feduska
was not very pleased with a change that he noticed: “No
more quarter draft’s at Zelda’s Greenhouse,” he said
morosely.

On a more serious note, senior Adam Butera discussed a

experience that wasn’t
available for incoming

freshmen four years ago.

change in the overall attitude about campus safety. Butera,
a close friend of Kevin Cecil’s (a Pitt student who was
paralyzed by a gunshot last summer outside of Webster
Hall), commented that he had “noticed that campus
awareness for violent crimes has gone up. My friends help
watch out for each other and make sure that everyone
always gets home safely.”

These were just a few of the more noticeable changes at
Pitt in recent years. You might not be able to eat at
Lothrop, the C—side, or Burger King, but now you can
work out; visit Eddie’s which is the new Towers food
court; or take a stroll in the park that is planned for the old
Burger King lot. Don’t count on that park for too long
though, because soon enough, another change will occur.
The university plans to build a new residence hall there in
a few years.

Luckily, this year’s Make way Burger King - Pitt
graduating class turned students will be strolling
twenty one before Zelda’s through the park in this Very
closed. spot within the year.

Seniors Reminisce About the ‘Good Old Days’ When They
Were Freshmen

Memory. It could be a game by Milton Bradley; a song
from the musical “Cats;” a definition in Webster’s
dictionary; or it could be a cherished piece of time left over
from a college student’s years at school. Using the latter
description, seniors at Pitt said their memories ran the
spectrum from excruciatingly embarrassing to really
educational.

“The most embarrassing moment of my freshman year
happened during a chemistry lab when I fainted,” senior
Erika Newcomer said. “I told my TA that I didn’t feel good,
but he said to finish the lab. When I went back to my table,
my partner told me that I didn’t look too good, and I just
fainted right onto the lab table.”

While embarrassing moments, which later became
memories, might have occurred during classes, they could
also have occurred while with a group of people.

“When the band went to Canada, a bunch of us were
outside my hotel room talking in the hall and my roommates
were in the room sleeping,” recalled senior Christine Wagner.
“The mascot decided that he would have some fun by putting

Hmmm. Have you ever won-
dered where those ‘freshman-
ﬁfteen’ come from? Fries and
pizza from the ‘O’ were hard to
resist during a late night of study-
mg.

on his head and going in and waking up my roommates.
Well, they weren’t too happy about it because he scared them
pretty badly, so they dead bolted the door, locking me out. It
was pretty embarrassing because it took me several hours
before I could get them to open the door.”

Although some freshman year memories may have been
embarrassing, some memories became learning experiences.
Senior Kelly Kane said that his most educational memory
occurred because of living in the Litchfield Towers during his
freshman year.

“I learned that you have to be more outgoing than you
were in high school, and I learned how to... get along with so
many people,” he explained.

Although freshman year may have provided memories that
contained both embarrassment and enlightenment, all seniors
had to survive their first years to get to “seniordom.” Who
knows? Ten years down the line, those seniors may look back
at those days and say, “Memory. All alone in the moonlight. I
can smile at the old days...”

There is not a freshman on
campus who has not had
some sort of adventure in the
Towers.

Do you remember going to
Zelda’s on the weekend when
you were a freshman?
Probably not.

...1eadership,

“We’re Outta Here!”

On April 28, 1996 at 1:00 PM at the
Civic Arena, Pitt held its 1996 grad-
uation. Fourth year and ﬁfth year seni-
ors alike matriculated with diplomas
in their various majors and from their
various schools. For some seniors this
will be a day of bittersweetness.

“I am a little scared, but I will also
be sad because I had great time here,
and I know life will never be the
same,” senior Sarah Caldwell said.

For senior Celia Ruiz, graduation
will be a day of achievement.

“I am pretty proud to be graduating
because I am the first person in my
family to go to college, so it is a pretty
big deal for me and my family,” she
explained.

But what about Pitt? Would you
stay an extra year if you could?

Ruiz said, “Yes, I would stay an
extra year. I can think of a lot of classes
that I did not get to take that I wanted
to take.”

Caldwell answered, “No, I would
not stay an extra year for undergrad-
uate school  especially because I
will be here for graduate school.”

No matter what they will feel on
April 28, seniors will be graduating,
and that is a goal long awaited.

Seniors wonder what will happen when

That fateful, long-awaited day has finally come. The day that you have dreamed about for years. The day that you will walk
n front of hundreds of people and .. no, not get married, not sing some rock song, GRADUATE! School is over for you. You
never have to stop foot in another classroom for the rest of your life. for all intents and purposes, you , the college graduate,
are completely, utterly, blissfully finished with that horrible thing called school.

As a college graduate, the world lies at your feet. Windows of opportunity lie ahead of you. What do you plan to do with
your future? Do you have that job lined up? Are you already enrolled in graduate school? Suddenly, you realize you are pretty
nervous about leaving the nice secure nest that college offers.

While many students are thrilled with the idea of finishing college, they have expressed their fears with what lies ahead.
Senior Stephanie Schwartz hopes to attend Pitt’s graduate program for elementary education. When asked about if she is

Gu[p..

“reality” hits.

nervous, Schwartz said “I’m not nervous, I’m not getting my hopes up about finding a job. Right now I’m nervous about

getting into grad school.”

As some students worry about grad school, others worry about entering the job market right away. Senior Stefan Mash, a
chemical engineering major, will “hopefully be working in a chemical company, but is not really sure.”

Senior Kelly Ruebel, who wants to work in advertising and sales, wishes to find a job “before I graduate. I’ll be interviewing ,
for about one and a half months before that so hopefully I’ll get a job.” ‘

Although seniors have their fears about what the future holds for them, all are definitely excited about the idea of moving

on and beginning their careers.

wﬁat’s Next

So, do you have a job yet?!?

College is over, and now it is time for you to enter the real world. The ultimate goal is to find that well-paying job with the
Company car and the six-figure paycheck. That may happen someday, but let’s be realistic. Many seniors hoped to find that
one perfect job right after graduation, but they realize that it will take some time to build up to what they really want.

Senior Michele Wood commented that while she would “like to be an account executive for an advertising firm.”

Christine Butczynski, a senior majoring in Biology, hopes to work in a sports medicine or rehabilitation clinic after graduate

school.
“It’s something I decided I wanted to do. It took a lot of research and volunteer work and it was something I decided to go

for.” Butczynski stated, on the difficulty of her major.
Seniors understand what their ultimate goals are. Unfortunately, they also understand the hard work it will take to reach

them.

Wood says that she “will probably find a low entry job in public relations. Getting into advertising and public relations
firms is hard and everyone I’ve talked to has done secretary work or been an assistant to an assistant.”

Senior Matthew Sataloff has already seen his career take off. He is currently working in a hospital as a physical therapist
aide. He calls his job his “backup plan until graduate school.” Sataloff commented that he is “basically  a physical therapist
without a degree until graduate school.”

The road to the ultimate job might be long and hard, but seniors will realize that it is all worth it when they get the job they
love. Sataloff sums it up when he says that “no matter how bad my day or night’s been, I will know that when I wake up
everyday I will look forward to being with the people I work with and I will count my blessings.”

For all engineering students, regardless of department of study, the freshman year
curricula in the School of Engineering, located in Benedum Hall, were the same. These
curricula included the freshman seminar program and the choosing of the department of
study by the end of that year.

The school, headed by dean H.K. Chang, also offered other programs that linked it to
the rest of the University. One of these programs was the five year Dual Degree Program

with CAS, which allowed a student to spend his/her first three years in engineering, and

his/her last two years in CAS.

“It’s Goocffor My
Resume.”

All through life, we are taught that we will have to support ourselves someday. This is one of the reasons that we go to
college, so that we can better ourselves so that we can earn more money at work. The problem is that on the way to this better
paying job, we find ourselves doing a variety of jobs that can only be described as hodgepodge, i.e., some good jobs, some bad
jobs. Some seniors found that their hodgepodge grew during their college years.

“The worst job that I ever had was the summer after my freshman year,” senior Melissa Mikula said. “I worked at Cedar
Point in Ohio in foods. I had to make cotton candy and every night I would get sugar stuck in my hair, or it would be 90
degrees outside and I’d be with the hot fryers to make elephant ears. It was also too monotonous, although, I think I would’ve
liked it better if I could have run a ride.”

While Mikula had her worst job during college, senior Linda Wiesnewski found her best job. “My internship at WPXI that I
got this summer has turned out to be my best job because they hired me ‘for real’ before my internship was over, so now I’ll
have a job after I graduate,” she explained.

Some students said that their jobs were neither worst nor best, but were just weird. “The weirdest job that I had was when I
workedas a receptionist at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital,” senior Brian Hearn recalled. “Whenever anyone called
or picked up the phone for the receptionist, the expected to hear a woman’s voice, but it was me.”

Mikula said that she had a weird job also. “This summer I worked with Nestea giving out free samples of Nestea for $50 a
day, and even if I only worked two hours a day, I got the $50. Not that I’m complaining,” she added.

Complaints could usually be heard if students had bad jobs, but most students knew that sometimes they had to be done.
After all, they were in college to learn and bad jobs, good jobs or weird jobs were all learning experiences.

Did I Te[[ You?

Oh, the excuses we can find to get us out of
most any situation!

“...and then, when I was walking to class, this homeless guy, the one that hangs out in front of the 7-1 1, you know the one,

right? Well, he comes up to me, and he’s like, hey help me out, and I didn’t know what to do, so I gave him my backpack, and

my paper was in there, so...”

Doesn’t this sound familiar? Ahhh, the stories a senior could tell. By the time you reach that point where you are finally
finished with school, most of us can rightfully claim to be masters of weaseling our way out of sticky situations. What
happened to that pesky term paper you wrote, where you were last Saturday night, where the missing phone number on a
napkin must have disappeared to. Of course, you have a reasonable explanation.

We all have a few tall tales in our closets, although few of us are willing to go public with them. Several seniors volunteered

their efforts, but they shall remain anonymous.
Senior One recalls a sociology paper that she just never got around to writing. “I told the professor that I couldn’t finish my

paper because I had to catch a bus to Philadelphia, but I wasn’t even going to Philly!”
While that was one of the more creative excuses listed to escape an assignment, Senior Two recalls pulling out all of the

stops to get out of things.

“I used all of the classic reasons: My ribbon ran out, the computer jammed, my roommate accidentally threw out my paper,
he thought it was garbage. Once I even told the professor that I gave him the paper and that he must have lost it. It was great,
I offered to redo the paper and he said don’t worry about it, it was his fault,” Senior Two remembers gleefully.

Explaining whereabouts to parents also generated some good stories among the seniors. Senior One mentioned that back in
high school she “went to a concert, but told her parents that she was spending the night at a friend’s house.”

Senior Stephanie Schwartz, a brave soul, once told her parents that she had gone to Zelda’s the night before. “My father
asked who Zelda was, not realizing that it was a bar. I told him that it was a club for people under twenty-one.”

Whatever the situation, a senior always finds a way to worm out of a sticky situation.

Education

Located in the Forbes Quad, the School of Education offered graduate and
undergraduate programs. Although the school, under dean Kenneth F. Metz, did indeed
offer both types of program, the only program that offered an undergraduate degree was
the Health, Physical, and Recreation Education Program. This program required
admission at the junior level of college following the “completion of appropriate
prerequisite courses,” and an additional two terms of post baccalaureate level work.

The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) was the University of Pittsburgh’s answer to the
traditional liberal arts college. It offered 50 majors and joint majors for undergraduate
and graduate students in the fields of Arts and Sciences, not including the “make it
yourself"/Interdisciplinary Studies major.

Within a major, CAS allowed a student to choose from a Variety of grading options,
including “Pass/Fail” (a.k.a. Satisfactory/audit) and auditing. The Dean of CAS was Mary
Louise Brisco.

Wﬂo’s Running the
SGB Now?

Pitt politics at its finest.

Pitt gets involved in its politics as much as any other campus. From the current Student Government Board race to the type
of cafeteria food and meal plan that students get, everyone has their opinion on what should be done. As president Julie
Crowell steps down, and Andrew Wuertele goes into office, a few Pitt seniors offer their tips on what the SGB should be
doing.

Senior Anthony Eidelman feels that the purpose behind the SGB is to “make decisions in the best interest of the students. It I

is a mouth piece for the student body. The SGB tells the university what the students want.”

Many seniors would like to see the SGB address the problem of safety on the Pitt campus. Senior Erica Barson would “like
to see them improve the safety in buildings because anyone could walk in to them without an ID” she mentioned.

Eidelman would like to see the SGB communicate more with the students. “I think SGB politics need to communicate
better as far as school politics. I think that they have too may hidden ways to make money with tuition.” he commented.

Barson’s comments on politics at Pitt spread farther than the extent of the SGB. “I think Pitt’s concerned with its image:
That they think they have something to prove. I think it’s good they are concerned with image, but to that extent I did not
agree with Chancellor O’Connor’s political agenda.” Barson stated.

If given the opportunity to take over as SGB president for a day, Barson commented again about the need for better

communication among the SGB and the students.
“I’d try to find a consensus of what students needed me to do for them,” she said.

Eidelman, when given the same option, offered to “improve the food and cafeterias. Also, improve the quality, or change, the

block system.”

In the years to come, the SGB will continue to evolve and work to make Pitt a better university, with the help of their

constituents, the students.

National Political Thoughts

When a person goes to college, he finds that often he is cut off from the “real world,” especially the world of politics.
Sometimes, however there are some exceptions to the rule, and some seniors who do know what is happening, and, even more
astonishing, have an opinion about it. They have opinions about everything from political parties to the way that government
should be run.

“I think that all the petty partisan politics is damaging the way that our government functions,” senior Gordon Sheaffer said.
“I think that compromises between the parties are necessary for our system to work.”

Some seniors said that they had a problem with Congress taking time off from its job.

“I do not like the fact that the government is taking that time off from Congress just because they can not agree on a
budget,” senior Erin Coffield said. “I think if they are getting paid by the people, they should be representing the people, not

taking time off.”
“They also felt that if they could be President of the United States for one day, they would change some things in this

country.

’m a Fifth Year
Senior. . .

These days it is getting harder and harder to
graduate in the traditional four years.

These days it is getting harder and harder to graduate on time. Students are waiting for those classes they just can not get
into, applying to the academic program that only takes so many, or just can not decide what they want to major in right away.
Certain majors take more than four years to complete and transferring schools holds you back , credit Wise. Or, you could just
prefer to be a professional student all of your life. These facts and more is what makes a fifth year senior.

I Just Signed My
Life Away!
Today’s college students are often

burdened with tremendous loan bills
after graduation.

Some people have experienced terror at the hands of movie directors, some at the hands of reckless drives, and still others at the hands
of themselves. Yes, those poor helpless people who find, in order to stay at this institute of learning, they must use their hands to do the

dirtiest, scariest deed of all...signing promissory notes.
For many seniors, financial aid was not necessary, however, for those for whom it was necessary, loans often comprised part of the

financial aid package.
“I have financial aid,” senior Bobbie Searfoss said. “I have loans and grants.”
The worst part of having the loans, seniors said, was the signing of the promissory notes which, in essence, said that they would be in

debt for many years.
“I feel like I’m signing my life away when I see how much the loan is worth,” senior Joyce Roethke explained. “It makes me nervous

when I realize that I will have to pay the loans off and I probably will not have a job.”
Seniors anticipated that paying off the loans will take some time. Searfoss said that “unless I win the lottery, it will probably take me

ten years.”
Even though they felt they were signing their lives away with each promissory note they signed, seniors said that it was worth it.

“I think that it is worth it because if I did not take these loans, I would not be here, and I wouldn’t have experienced college life,”
Roethke said.

           "Job! What's That?"
               Senior year is only exciting... it can often be
                     unpredicatable as seniors begin putting
                              themselves on the job market.
              Pitt has been touted a~ a University full of diversity, and when it caine to its sen ors and their searches for jobs, it was no
            difFei~ent. Miiny ~eiiiors' ~earches, however, did have at least ont coniih6n th~ad. They W~htedjdbs tli~t wonid hel~them in
          ~~~the future.
              ~'~~~ant iiijob that wili five n~ie go6dopp~6nuniti~s andexperi&amp;nce betause Iwould like ~ retur~1 to school for my MBA, and
              on sometimes need job experience for grad school," senior Susan Cespuglio said.
          ~ Opportui~uties that gave exptrience, niight be overlook~d if seniors did notLknowwheretofmdthem. They look, therefore,
              a variety of places.
              ~ law enforcement fraternity offers job fairs, so I will go to job fair and talk to the various agencies," senior
            Kevin Kat~ynickelab&amp;P~ited. ~ I wil1t~.ke aj~b an~her~that Ivan ~tone.
              The willingness to take a job anywhere could come in handy for seniors; could move them to any place and could get them
              iredquic~r, but~ome ~eniors despite ady~jve otherwise reallydid n~t want to be that tThxibte~,
              "I would like to stay iii the Pittsbw'gh ar~," Ce~pugli6 said2'The Placement Ceifter says that I have to be flexible, but I
              ouki take an offer for less if it kept me in Pittsburgh."
              The one ffiing Uiat seni6rs skid did Aot haSte flexibilitywas their perdeptioiis of the peff'~t job~
              "My idea of a perfect job would be a job in advertising or sales where I could be there for 12 hours and it would not faze
              e beL~ause1 wo4d reaUy enjoy my jciW" senior Kelly Reubel explaihed.
              The idea of searching for a job fazed may seniors at Pitt, but no matter wli~.t ha~5j,ens, they will keep searching, until one
              ay, they find tbejob oheir~jreams~

You're looking in the most extraordinary guarantee ever
put together by a copier company. In at nutshell. it says
that ifyou're not satisﬁed during the first three years.
we‘ll replace Lhc machine. No questions asked.

Obviously, we wouldn't make this promise unless we
made copiers that could live up to rt.

For durability, reliability and quality, nothing compares
to a small Xerox. That's why we have the highest brand
loyalty raung tn the business. It's our customers that keep
coming back. Not our copiers.

Above all. when you compare full cost ofownership.
Xerox copiers can actually cost less than the competition.

— it may mean books, homework,
ying, and exams, or it may mean
arties, hanging out, friends, and fun. Most
likely, school is a mixture of both, but it
may not be a perfect balance.

Being a student means making choices and
decisions. Not just choosing between going out or
writing a paper, but decisions that will affect the
rest of your life. You are now free to make your
own decisions, which means that you also have
to stand by them and take responsibility for your
actions. Some of these decisions are life-altering;
some are not. Sometimes you will make the right
decision; sometimes you will not. Although it
may be a little disheartening to not always make
the right choice, or to have events not work out
as planned, it is a necessary part of your
education. You have to make mistakes in order
to learn from them, and in the process, you begin
to trust yourself and your decisions, and you also
gain more self-

confidence along with
the experience.
Whatever your

future plans, you will

experiences with you.

They are a part of
e  your life at Pitt, and
they will always be a

part of your life. They

you, but their origins

inﬂuence of the
knowledge and
experiences you’ve

their victory.

The 1995
Homecoming

Court.

 

All Hail
the King
and

Queen
 —95 a/9{ug&c§otcce55/

y just walking through the Cathedral of Learning, everyone

was able to predict what event was soon to come. As you

walked down the stairwells and through the halls, each

corner you turned was met by a new face on a poster.

Each face was accompanied with the slogan, “Vote for me

for Homecoming King or Queen!” It seemed each day
brought a new face and a new name. As voting day drew closer, the
faces became more familiar, and you decided who you were going to
vote for as king and queen. The ballots were cast and the votes
counted, which left the entire campus buzzing.

On October 21, the curiosity would be laid to rest. The candidates
were Annie Ferry, Eric Hibbs, Holly Killian, Creighton Moorhead,
Keily Younkins, Anil Mehta, Keyne Johnson, Patrick Huey, Wendi
Wiley, and Brian Reimer. It was a very respectable group of
outstanding students, that made it hard to only pick one winner, yet
Holly Killian and Anil Mehta came out victorious.

This year’s Homecoming will be tough to forget. Pitt played the ever
powerful Miami Hurricanes and almost pulled off an upset, only
losing by one point, 17-16. Also, who could ever forget the creative
signs Anil Mehta created. Overall, Homecoming -95 was a huge

success!

Dollars

and Sense

Although the rally
was mostly peaceful,
there was a number
of protesters.

t is not an everyday occurrence when the Vice President of the
United States visits Pitt. What brought Vice President Al Gore
here was a rally to save student aid. Student leaders from area
colleges and universities spoke, while many other schools were
represented. In response to proposed cuts in student aid,
student leaders from Chatham, Duquesne, Pitt, Carlow,
Carnegie Mellon, and the Community College of Allegheny
County joined together to form the Pittsburgh Area Student
Action Coalition, raising awareness of the precarious state of
students’ ﬁnancial aid, and organizing this rally.

Gore accused opposition in Congress as being the instigator of the
proposed cuts, and rallied for bi-partisan support of the efforts to save
student aid saying, “It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a
Republican or an Independant or where you come from. This is a record
that benefits students of all ages and supports life-long learning.”

Both the Clinton administration and several Republican politicians
have vowed to fight for student aid. Gore emphasized that students have
the power to inﬂuence change.

The rally was big news when it hit, but little has been heard about
student aid since. Only time will tell whether these efforts produce any
effects. Hopefully, when the issue is next addressed, support, both from
students and the general population, will not diminish.

 

On Monday,
September 11,
1995, Vice
President Al
Gore spoke to
students about
financial aid on
the Cathedral
Lawn.

As peppy music blasted from an enormous sound system that echoed between two landmark buildings,
thousands of people gathered to see a human landmark and to voice their concerns about the possible cuts
of student financial aid. The Cathedral Lawn was the site for this event — and Vice President Al Gore was
the key—note speaker. Three miles" of yellow rope could be seen for city blocks in every direction, and
guarding every yard of it were police officers, who were the bain of motorists trying to get somewhere,
anywhere! Nearer to the eye of the storm, swarms of stoic “suits” with shades, ear plugs, and fiercely

A solemn demeanors controlled the show.

The yellow rope caused headaches for pedestrians too — Pitt students had to trek an extra mile to get
anywhere near the Cathedral. One wondered what kind of mayhem could occur elsewhere in the metropolis
when all the city’s police and ambulances seemed to be surrounding the Cathedral. Police patrolling every
walkway, inside and outside of the Cathedral, and at least one manning every roof level on the building
itself. (The cops on the roof tops brought visions of chimney sweeps to my mind until I realized that they
were the sniper patrol.) And try to get somewhere in the midst of all this “security.” I know I’d have felt a
lot safer had I not seen over a dozen people get by the yellow rope. Once the crowd started to form, the
main security concern seemed to be making people come and go through the right channels of rope, rather
than watching where they were going. Not to mention the fact that no one knew where anything was. If the
security doesn’t knowthe area they are trying to secure, how safe is anyone?

As chaotic as all this was, only when you heard the Chatham students chanting and picketing and a
mime trying to get a “wave” going did you begin to realize that something unique was occurring. Who’s
paying the mime, you wonder. You realize with trepidation that it is still hours until the event begins, and
notice that the sun is already threatening to melt your vertebrae through the back of your shirt.

Yes, I had a press pass that enabled me to get up front, but instead I opted for a midtlle ground with a
greater perspective ‘and more importantly, a place to set my seat. I wondered if I would \keep my pass as a
souvenir. I wondered, also, if I could use it to excuse my absences from all my classes today.

Great — one of the ear plug guys just chose a tree to lean against, and his bike—cop buddy just joined
him, effectively blocking the rest of my view.

More entertaining that the mime’s actual performance is watching him mime responses to the suit who’s
going through his case of goodies. He even suggests that the suit try his hand at juggling. The suit appears
to be less than amused.

At last! A reprieve from the music. Unfortunately, a cacophony of walky—talky jabber from the suits,

gcops, bike-cops, and media personnel has replaced it.

The audacity! Penn State students have announced their presence. They’ll be lucky if they don’t get

‘lynched, being on Pitt territory. The Chatham chanters have started up again — as if that doesn’t get old

quick. Ah —— a little more inventive than “Save Student Aid” is “Don’t let Newt give us the boot.”
The opening volley of the band included the time honored P-E-N—N St. SUCKS anthem. That ought to

put a few people into their places!
The channel eleven news guy and cameraman are not even 20 paces to my right. Channel two is roughly

the same distance to my left, and channel four is directly in front of me.
Get a hold of a press pass, and you can go wherever you want if you look like you know what you’re

doing and have every right to be there. It’s a scary thought.

BR()KE!! ’ ’ snzzrsﬁiis

Not only is park-

(3 leak t%@ ing difficult to

 md )9/zen/ses cam :75  find in Oakm
it is difficult to
pay for.

ow many times have you gone to the MAC machine to discover that your
funds were alarmingly low? Once, twice, every time? Two things that you
realized during school (if you hadn’t before) were: (1) weekends are always too
short; and (2) it’s almost impossible to have money and not spend it. But
where did it all go? Before checking all your pockets for holes, think about a
regular weekend and what you do.

For example, if you went to any bars, there was probably a cover charge, and if not,
you’d more than make up for it buying drinks all night. After the bar, there might have
been a late night snack stop at Primanti’s or McDonald’s.

Okay. If you didn’t go out, but decided to stay in and watch movies. You’d first have to
rent some (or burn them off someone), and then you’d order a large pizza with everything
and a couple of bottles of soda.

Then, there were just the everyday “necessities” such as clothes from mail-order
catalogs, trips to the mall, the latest CD5, and pit stops at 7-1 1.

Another occurrence that could have seriously depleted your funds could have been dates.
Taking someone out takes a considerable amount of cash. Dinner and a movie could easily
exceed $50 depending on where you went. But even if you opted for McDonald’s Extra
Value Meals, the movie tickets would still run about $15.

Also, since Pittsburgh is home to three extremely good professional sport teams,
attending any of the sports events could cut deep into your budget. The tickets alone would
be expensive, but once you add in the over-priced vendor items, the total goes up
considerably.

As if all the above were not enough, one mustn’t forget about habitual items such as
gum, chocolate, and tobacco products, to name a few.

All the big and little things add up quickly, and if you didn’t pay attention, you were
broke before you could say, “And a pack of Marlboros please.”

Jazz Ensemble

The University of Pittsburgh Jazz Ensemble started during 1969 with only seven members. Now it
consists of twenty-two instrumentalists, from the students who are music and non-music majors. The
ensemble goes on tour every year and has traveled to New Orleans, Alabama, Switzerland, Canada, and
Jamaica.

The ensemble is under the direction of Dr. Nathan Davis along with help from Mr. James Alston (sax),
Mr. Kenny Powell (sax), and Mr. Wesley Ward (trumpet). The ensemble plays varieties of jazz music, but
mostly from the big band era and student composers.

The ensemble meets twice a week for a total of three to four hours. This year, the ensemble will start to ‘
perform at the local schools to introduce jazz music to young audiences. The ensemble will also perform
on campus during the conjunction with the seminar, and the spring concert with the featured guests. Also,
the ensemble is hoping to take a trip to Jamaica during May next summer.

Pitt Pathfinders

Pitt Pathﬁnders have continued to become a more important part of the student recruitment process at
the University of Pittsburgh. In the six years that this organization has existed on campus, they have
grown from 20 members to their current number of 77 and have increased in their responsibilities to
tours, telemarketing, interviewing, and recruitment programs. Although they are sponsored by the Ofﬁce
of Admissions and Financial Aid, they remain a student run organization whose members are hand
selected based on level of maturity, public speaking ability, and enthusiasm for Pitt.

Campus tours are their main responsibility. They give three tours a day, Monday through Friday, and
each Pathﬁnder is responsible for one or two tours per week. Telemarketing has only been implemented
in the last two years. Their aim for this year is to talk to every student who applies to Pitt. Of those who
apply, the Pathﬁnders are also going to track a few students to determine what affects their college
selection process. The Pathﬁnder organization receives most of its publicity from its recruitment
programs. These programs include both on —— and off-campus programs attended by prospective students
and their parents, including hotel programs, high school visits, and large programs held in the Union.
Pathﬁnders are there not only to give tours, but also to answer to questions from a current student’s point
of view. '

As a Pathﬁnder, every student involved has the chance to make a real difference —— for both the
University of Pittsburgh and the high school students they talk to and meet. In many cases, students
choose their college based on the experience they have when visiting campus, and many students choose
Pitt because of the impact the Pathﬁnders have.

Several changes have occurred for Pathﬁnders during 1995-1996 school year. Nan Sninsky and
Suzanne Harper were appointed as the new advisors during the summer before classes started. They have
worked very hard to make this year the best year yet for Pathﬁnders and have done a good job at making
the adjustment for returning members very smooth. The leadership structure was changed to include one
president and ﬁve vice presidents, each in charge of a different aspect of the organization. Brent
Dunworth, a four-year Pathﬁnder, took over as president, with Carrie Anderson, Ann Marie Augustyn,
Kate Freed, Jed Silberg, and Leigh Ann Yant serving as vice presidents.

In the beginning of October the second annual Pathﬁnder Retreat was held. This year the Pathﬁnders
traveled to Camp Spencer in Fombell, PA for a weekend of bonding, training, and relaxation. This
weekend served as a great time away from Oakland to learn about the campus, the Pathﬁnder
organization, and each other. Bi-weekly meetings serve as time for additional training, program sign-ups,
general information, and committee meetings. This year the F undraising and Historian Committees were
formed to raise money for and keep a record of the organization. A buddy System was also set up to pair
an old Pathﬁnder with a new one, and hopefully make the new members feel like a true part of the
organization right from the start.

Pathﬁnders have the potential to make a huge impact on students’ lives. Even though every individual
member is different, they all have one major thing in common — the pride they feel from being a part of
the University of Pittsburgh. This pride is what they convey to prospective students to make them see that
Pitt is the right school for them and is also what makes the Pathﬁnders such a successful student
organization.

Phi Sigma Pi

Phi Sigma Phi is a Co-ed National Honor Fraternity that prides itself on three fundamental concepts:
scholarship, leadership, and fellowship. The Alpha Omega Chapter here at the University of Pittsburgh
was established in September of 1992. The advisor is Dr. Max Brandt. They currently have 50 active
members and 30 initiates soon to become brothers. Through fall and spring rushes, the members
continually expand their brotherhood. All members have completed at least one semester as a full student
and maintained a 3.0 QPA. The brothers come from diverse ﬁelds of study, yet they all come together to
uphold the fratemity’s standing tradition of brotherhood.

As a group, the member strive to make a difference in the community by carrying out a variety of
service projects. Phi Sigma Pi service projects include anything from the Hand-In-Hand Festival to
adopting streams. During the fall semester of 1996, they cleaned litter from our adopted highway, dressed
up in costumes to aid the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the North Hills, had a food drive, and helped clean
up Oakland in the “Pitt”sburgh Project, to name just a few. In November and December, we intend to
have a clothing drive, go caroling at Independence Court and trim trees for the School for the Blind.
While all these projects are quite social, they have other events set aside for fellowship alone.

Each year Pitt’s chapter of Phi Sigma Pi attends its National Convention, which is in Norfolk, Virginia
this year. The convention allows them to socialize with brothers from other chapters. They also do many
other activities with their individual chapter. These activities range from all-night bowling, coffee at the
Beehive, and ice skating to theme parties, semi-formals and the annual formal. They even participate in
university sponsored social activities, such as the Homecoming Race. In the past two years, they have
sponsored both King and Queen candidates and one each year has made the Homecoming Court. They
enjoy showing our pride and leadership on campus through being active. Whether performing service
Projects, organizing fundraisers, or enjoying social events, Phi Sigma Pi’s take great pride in what they are
doing and hope others will follow the example set forth. All of these events, whether social or service,
bring all of the brothers closer together and help them to maintain our balance of scholarship, leadership,

and fellowship.

Heinz Chapel Choir

)

The Heinz Chapel Choir was founded in 1939. Simply because as much of a landmark as the Heinz §
Chapel was to the community, it needed a choir. Originally the choir performed for most of the chapel
services, but now performs its own concerts there.

Theodore “Pop” Finney was the very ﬁrst director of the choir. Pop Finney began several traditions in 
the choir, one of them still going today is the fall choir camp. Back in its origins, the choir would go to visit
Pop Finney’s farm for a week, and rehearse their music. That tradition is still alive today, but 9
unfortunately the fall choir camp is only one weekend away from school, and is held at a local camp.

The Heinz Chapel Choir is best known throughout the city of Pittsburgh for its Christmas concerts.
every year. The Heinz Chapel is beautifully decorated for the holiday season, and the choir will perform
three concerts on the ﬁrst weekend in December, and an additional concert for the Chancellor, the Heinz 1
family, and their distinguished guests. The chapel itself is packed, with standing room only crowds.

Another thing the choir is known for today is its travel abroad. In recent years, the choir has traveled
Eastern Europe, including Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. This past May, the Choir toured Italy
and Greece for two weeks, and performed ﬁve concerts during the tour. Currently the Choir is planning
another trip abroad, this time to Spain and France in the summer of 1998.

So what kind of students make up the Heinz Chapel Choir? Of the 51 members this year, just a few are
music majors. It might sound surprising for a musical group to have only a few music majors, but having‘
students from different areas of study makes being a part of the Choir that much more fun and interesting. ,
Each member is unique, has their own interests, and different and attractive personalities. Then there is 3
that one thing that we all have in common, and that we all share — the gift of music. It has been that way
since the first edition of the Heinz Chapel Choir in 1939. After over 50 years of existence, the choir has
continued, dropped, and added traditions and hopes to continue to be strong in future years.

Some of God’s
Children

Some of God’s Children, the gospel choir here at the University of Pittsburgh, was founded in 1973 in
the residence lounge of Lothrop Hall, when a group of determined, young college students gathered
around to sing praises to the Lord. These students led the way and were the original founders. Their
purpose was to sing the Gospel and render Christian services to the glory of God. They started out with a
small amount of members, however, those few worked hard and did the will of the Lord.

Since then, Some of God’s Children has participated in televised programs, traveled to various states
on the east coast and performed at the 1989 ACUI, while also placing in a 1990 choir competition.

In the past, Some of God’s Children has held annual charitable activities to support the community.
Some include our Bible Studies on every other Friday night; our annual trip to a correctional facility; a
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter basket to local churches; many fundraisers, as well as other
volunteer services.

The choir itself is all about the ministry of Christianity through music. There are many different
musical ways to express your feelings about the Lord. There are spirituals, hymns, contemporary gospel,
acapella, jazz, and Caribbean sounds of gospel music. Some of God’s Children incorporates many of these
types in their ministry to try to reach all walks of life.

Today, Some of God’s Children has grown. They are blessed to now have over 80 members, both
graduate and undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh. The choir is a nondenominational, sup-
portive, and understanding gospel organization that performs locally throughout Pittsburgh and its
surrounding areas. They are proud to boast that their members are in all manners of professions. Some
are in Pre-Med, Pre-Law, Chemistry, Engineering, and Social Work. They all manage to take the time out
and get together once a week for rehearsal. They are appreciated for taking the time out and giving it to
the Lord.

educofion:

tudying, it’s an endless cycle for the college student. One exam, then
another . . . then another. How does one cope with this endless cycle
of studying?
One way to deal with the never-ending study cycle is to not study
at all. This is a very effective method for those who wish to fail out
of college. Seeing as most people are here to get a degree, this method is not a
wide-spread one.

Another way to deal with the seemingly endless amount of work is to pull
an all nighter the night prior to an exam or due date for a major project. This
method works for several college students, but it is not recommended because
it messes up the sleep schedule.

The best way to get through the study blues is to work hard during the week
and then make the
weekends count. Study

for exams well in
advance and work on . .
projects early.

“Do what you have to (
make the grade,” is the

studying philosophy of

‘one freshman, Kristen
3Moore.
There are several an‘ M
prime locations on 0

Campus for studying.
Students frequent
\Hillman Library and the

Commons Room in the Cathedral, and can also be found in other libraries on
Campus where they can get away from the normal hustle and bustle. Many
students go to their rooms as a haven for studying.
Whatever the method, studying can not be avoided. Each student needs to

decide what method of studying works best and do what he can in order to
make the grade.

With its 2,529 windows and 738 steps, the Cathedral has a unique
beginning. It was the inspiration of the university’s tenth chancellor, Dr. John
Gabbert Bowman. He contracted Gothic architect Charles Kauder to design
and build it. Seventeen years of planning, fundraising, and construction were
expended before the Cathedral’s completion in 1937. Due to community

resistance to the cost of
building this imposing
structure, it was decided
that after the Cathedral’s
frame was built,
construction would begin
on the fifth ﬂoor and
move upward. This

ensured that the building’s design would be
realized and completed according to the blueprints.

Bowman knew that the people of Pittsburgh would
not let the structure stand with the first ﬁve ﬂoors
unfinished, and therefore, useless.

The Cathedral of Learning now serves as the
center for academic life at Pitt. The lawn is a
popular place to find students when the weather is
nice and is a great place for students to enjoy the
winter weather as well. But, a fact that is probably
of more interest to students about the Cathedral is
that it can hold 28,247,848.54 twinkies.

kes a lot to build a winning athlete
team. Muscles, reﬂexes, and talent
re only part of the whole package.
Facilities are also necessary. This year,

football players at Pitt used new locker rooms
in Pitt Stadium, and many await new locker
rooms and facilities for other teams including
swimming and basketball.

Old teams were torn down and plans to
build new ones were made. Due to a law
known as “Title IX,” men’s and women’s
sports teams must have equal representation.
Because the men’s teams outnumbered the
women’s, men’s tennis and gymnastics were
cut. Blueprints for women’s soccer to join the
many varsity teams at Pitt in 1996 are being

drawn.

Several teams reached heights never
reached before in our school’s history, while

fter struggling through back—to-back 3-8 campaigns, the Panthers looked

as if they could bounce back and contend in the Big East. But any dreams

ofa bowl bid vanished as Pitt suffered an injury-plagued season that left

them with a dismal 2-9 record overall, including 0-7 in the conference.

The 1995 season started out bright for the Panthers as they hosted
Washington State in the season opener. Quarterback John Ryan led Pitt
on a late fourth—quarter drive en route to a 17-13 win.
Eastern Michigan invaded Pitt Stadium the following week and the

Eagles’ Steve Clay brought Pitt fans back down from the previous week’s
high with a 93-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown. Pitt responded in strong
fashion and ran away with a convincing 66-30 win to go to 2-0. Pitt won the game, but lost
running back Billy West to injury. This was the debut for freshman running back Demetrius
Harris who dazzled the crowd with his quick moves and finished the game with 149 rushing
yards and three touchdowns. That would not be the last time Pitt fans would hear Harris’
name.

At that point, many people would have thought you were crazy if you said the Panthers
wouldn’t win another game all year, but they were wrong.

Pitt traveled to Texas and outplayed the Longhorns, but turnovers plagued the Panthers as
they fell 38-27 in front of 62,875 fans at Memorial Stadium.

The Panthers came back to the ’burgh to face John Cooper and his Ohio State Buckeyes.
They kept the game close in the first half and went into the locker room at the break trailing
only 20-14. But the Buckeyes’ trio of Eddie George, Bobby Hoying, and Terry Glenn shell-
shocked the Panthers in the second half and notched a 54-14 win. Pitt fell to 2-2 with the
loss and next hosted Big East foe Virginia Tech the following week, this time with Billy West
back from the injured list.

Once again the Panthers played well enough to win, but were hurt by mistakes. Two
fourth—quarter blocked punts paved the way for the Hokies to steal a 26-16 conference win.

Boston College greeted the Panthers the following week and sent Pitt packing with a 17-0
whitewash leaving the Panthers with a 2-4 record coming into what was sure to be an
upcoming win at Temple.

The Temple Owls battled the wind and rain for their first ever conference win 29-27 in
front of 4,968 drenched fans at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia

Majors and Co. tried to break out of the slump as the equally—struggling Hurricanes of the
University of Miami came to town. Pitt led 16-10 late in the fourth quarter and it looked as
if it would be a day to remember for Pitt faithful, but Miami’s Ryan Collins engineered a
game-winning drive that put the ‘Canes ahead for good, 17-16.

The 2-6 Panthers dropped the final three games of the season by a combined score of 95-
34. Rutgers and Syracuse each notched 42 points against a struggling Panther defense while
the offense managed only 24 points versus the Scarlet Knights and 10 points against the
Orangemen.

The final game of the year was the ’95 Backyard Brawl when Pitt traveled down to face
West Virginia on ESPN. This was another snoozer as Don Nehlen’s squad humbled the
Panthers 21-0.

This was the season that Pitt would say goodbye to some seniors that have left their mark
on the entire program. Wide receiver Dietrich Jells finished his career as the all—time leader
in receptions. Despite injuries, Linebacker Torn Tumulty capped off a great career with 75
tackles in ’95 and a spot in the Blue/Gray Game with Anthony Dorsett and the Senior Bowl
along with Jells.

The future looks bright for some Panthers, freshman place kicker Chris Ferencik was a
finalist for the Lou Groza Award given to the nation’s best kicker. Ferencik finished the year
with a perfect 1 1-1 1 mark in field goals and 12-13 on points after a touchdown.

Demetrius Harris finished the year with 610 yards on 137 carries and five touchdowns.
Together with Billy West in 1996, the Panthers may be climbing out of the Big East cellar
and surfacing back at the top.

he 1995-96 soccer season has been by far one
of the Panther’s best.

Pitt, competing all year to make the Big
East Championships, had a season of
overtime victories, major upsets, hard losses,
and new records.

Probably one of the most underrated
teams in the Big East, Pitt began their season
just as everyone expected, losing. They

dropped their first game to Robert Morris 4-0. Then, in
their second game against St. Francis, Pitt did the
unexpected, they started winning. At the end of the season,
Pitt compiled an overall record of 14-6-1 and 8-3 in the Big
East, earning them a spot in the Big East Tournament.

Despite making it to the Big East Championships, Pitt
had some more obstacles to overcome. First, just playing in
the competitive Big East can be a problem when facing
teams like Syracuse, Notre Dame, Villanova, and Rutgers.
Second, the departure of several seniors from last year’s
squad required that some of the positions be filled with
freshman players. These freshmen, however, more than rose
to the occasion.

Stepping up to fill the voids were key players such as Jeff
Porter, Todd Graf, and freshmen Travis Kruse, Phil Matilla
and Drew Kopp, who led the team in points with 15.

Although there were obstacles for the Panthers, they
didn’t fail to make the season exciting. The Panthers had
their share of dramatics pulling off a major upset against
ranked Rutgers during the regular season. In the Big East
Tournament, Pitt went into double over—time with Seton
Hall, and the game came down to penalty shots. Pitt
triumphed, advancing in the tournament.

In this fun-filled, exciting season, a little history was also
made. The Panthers set a new record for most conference
wins in a season with eight, and goalie Adam Spitzer also
got into the action by posting a record high of seven
shutouts this season.

The Panthers took their season down to the wire as they
lost in the Championships to St. John’s 2-0.

Although the Panthers saw their season end in defeat,
they accomplished more than many Pitt soccer teams that
came before them, which was not all that bad for the
underdog team of the 1995-96 soccer season.
