Centuries of KNOWLEDGE

With all of the modern facilities, new
buildings, and new construction, the proud
history of the University of Pittsburgh is not
immediately apparent. The University that
today is recognized as an international
research university was started in 1787 by
Hugh Henry Brackenridge in a one—room
log cabin. Then known as the Pittsburgh
Academy, it was renamed the Western
University of Pennsylvania in 1819.

Pitt is steeped in history. Thomas Mellon,
an 1837 graduate, founded Mellon Bank;
aviation pioneer Samuel Langley became
director of the Allegheny Observatory and
professor in 1887; and in 1955, Jonas Salk
and his team developed the polio vaccine
that saved lives, to name just a few notable
Pitt individuals.

After calling a number of Pittsburgh locations
home, the University purchased 43 acres

of land in Oakland, which has been its home
since 1908. While practically everything
about Pitt has changed since 1787, a log
cabin sits beside the Cathedral of Learning
as a proud symbol of Pitt's frontier beginnings.

Nights on the TOWN

After a long day of studying, University of
Pittsburgh students are ready to kick back and
have a good time. Pittsburgh offers good food,
entertainment, and shopping to offset the busy
days students have.

Most Pitt students will name the Strip District,
Station Square, Shadyside, the South Side, and
the Waterfront as the area’s hot spots. Home
to the original Primanti Bros., the Strip District
is known for its ethnic food and nightclubs.
On the South Side, students can try one of
nearly 50 cheesecakes and desserts at the
Cheesecake Factory, explore the funky shops
lining East Carson Street, or enjoy an evening
at a club. The Waterfront in Homestead
offers some of the area’s best shopping at
both department and chain stores and an
unforgettable movie experience at the AMC

On the weekend, there
are numerous activities for
students, such as Friday 
Night Improv, left, and the
Oakland Tea House, right.

Loews Waterfront theater. The Monongahela
lncline——which offers one of the best views

of the city——lets riders out near Station Square
restaurants like the Hard Rock Cafe. For a more
upscale shopping experience, students can take
a trip to Shadyside and browse stores such as
the Apple Store, Coach, and J. Crew.

When the studying is done and it’s time to play,
Pitt students have hundreds of options for a fun

night out, so there’s no excuse for being bored.

in the William Pitt Union with

a ribbon—cutting ceremony.

New and IMPROVED

After nearly 20 years without a renovation,
the student recreation center on the lower level
of the William Pitt Union received a much-
needed makeover in the fall of 2007.

The Division of Student Affairs and the Office
of Student Life created a place centered on relax-
ation and entertainment with four areas: a snack
shop, a nonalcoholic bar, a commuter student
lounge, and a gaming center.

From Nintendo Wiis, Xbox 3605, and
PlayStations to five computers and a new Dance
Dance Revolution arcade game, the gaming
center is filled with high—end technology.

The snack shop is the place to go for items like
pretzels, cookies, chips, and drinks. Commuter
students can catch up on homework, nap in
one of the comfortable seating areas, or catch
a show on the flat—screen TV.

The new lounge offers
everything from a
computer room for
gaming to refreshments.

104

Another new student destination is Market
Central, opened in 2007 in the lower level

of the Litchfield Towers. It offers a wide range
of choices for a variety of tastes. Market Central
offers a lively atmosphere for eat—in dining

but also helps on—the—go students with

a selection of snacks and quick takeout meals.

With a variety of activities, amenities, and
dining choices, the new William Pitt Union
lounge and Market Central make great places
for students to relax, unwind, or refuel.

Smooth JAZZ

In front of a sold—out Carnegie Music Hall,
10 jazz musicians from around the country
and beyond concluded the four—day 37th
annual University of Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar
and Concert in November 2007.

Founded in 1970 by Pitt’s own Nathan Davis,
director of jazz studies in the Department

of Music, the Pitt Jazz Seminar is the longest-
running event of its kind in the United States.
In addition to a high—profile closing—night
concert, the seminar also offers the public
free lectures, films, and demonstrations.

When this event is over, Pitt offers many
ways for students to experience the history

of jazz throughout the year. The Sonny Rollins
International Jazz Archives at Hillman Library
houses instruments and other items generously
donated by musicians. The William Pitt Union
is home to the International Academy of Jazz
Hall of Fame, which inducts one living and
one deceased musician each year.

Pitt’s inventive celebrations of jazz bring

Rhythm and MOVEMENT

To dance means to move one’s feet and body
rhythmically in a pattern of steps to the
accompaniment of music. It's a common
action at the University of Pittsburgh, which
boasts many clubs and teams for all those
students who are serious about dance.

One such group is the Ballet Club, which holds
weekly ballet classes, choreographs traditional
pieces, and takes its members to professional
performances downtown. The Panther Tango
Club and the Black Dance Workshop also
invite students to enjoy workshops and
performances on campus and around
Pittsburgh. The Dance Ensemble has more
than 80 dancers and choreographers who
meet up to six times a week.

The Pitt Dance Team is one of the most
commonly seen dance groups around campus.
This team requires tryouts and rigorous training
in order to perform at football and basketball
games. Theresa Nuzzo directs the dance team,
leading it to many national competitions.

While dance clubs are abundant, many of Pitt’s
other groups also offer performances centered
on dance, such as the Hindu Students Council's

annual Diwali show.

Whether dance is something you like to watch
or to do, Pitt offers several outlets to enjoy.

The business of everyday life—the tests, papers,
and classes—has to get done, but University
of Pittsburgh students like to play as hard as
they work. Fortunately, the University campus
and surrounding areas provide excellent ways
for Pitt students to spend their downtime.

Students living in the dorms can watch movies
in the comfort of the common lounge. For those
seeking something active, there always seems
to be an informal soccer, football, or ultimate
Frisbee game in progress on the Cathedral of
Learning lawn.

Because of its central location, the William Pitt
Union is a popular hangout zone. There you
will find students eating, enjoying a game of
pool, or even playing the piano for others.

The William Pitt Union
offers numerous activities,
from shooting some 

pool on the concourse level
or relaxing between classes.

Many students take
a break for a cup of
coffee between classes.

”Here is eternal spring for you the
very stars of heaven are new. ”
—Robert Bridges

Common GROUNDS

Covering more than 22,000 square feet and
towering four stories high, the Commons
Room is the heart and soul of the Cathedral
of Learning. During the day, students pass
through on their way to class, often stopping
to study or talk with friends. Packed with
heavy wooden chairs and long wooden desks,
the Commons Room is the perfect meeting
place for students and faculty alike.

At night, books and faces are illuminated by
the hanging chandeliers, which, like the rest

of the Cathedral, are inspired by Gothic design.

The Commons Room is reflective of old

European academic traditions, complete with
elaborate carvings, limestone walls, and green
slate floors.

The Commons Room contains
many intriguing architectural
features that are evident from the
ceiling vau/ts to the benches’ arms.
Far Right: Students use the
Commons Room as a refuge for
studying /ate at night.

10

Inscribed at the top of the Commons Room’s
iron gate are words to inspire all who enter:
”Here is eternal spring for you the very stars
of heaven are new.”

Congratulations, Class of 2008!

It is hard to believe that only four years ago
we started at the University of Pittsburgh as
freshmen. It is wonderful to see the growth
each of us has made in our pursuit to achieve
our lifetime goals. My hope is that you have
embraced the lessons you have learned inside
and outside the classroom. I have faith that you
will become successful University of Pittsburgh
graduates who will make a substantial impact
on society. Follow your dreams. The best is
yet to come in our future.

Over the past few years, you have seen
developments in the University that have led
to Pitt’s rise in rankings regarding academics,
athletics, and research. I am proud to be a Pitt
student and honored to have served as your
2007 Student Government Board (SGB)
president. If our accomplishments are indicative
of the future, then I am extremely excited for
the years ahead.

SGB has served as an effective representative
body. We are committed to making the college
experience the best time of one’s life by
working to enhance the quality of education.
SGB has been successful in implementing

SGB
President’s Letter

new projects throughout the past four years,
such as lobbying Congress on Capitol Hill;
extending the hours of Hillman Library to

24 hours the week before finals; developing
the incoming freshmen mentorship program;
and instituting a new Pitt event, painting the
panther statues, among other things.

This is an exciting time in our lives. No matter
what adventures await you outside of this
University, I hope you will reflect on your
memories of Pitt and feel proud to be a Panther.
We all have dreamed of college graduation,

so take some time to celebrate this magnificent
feat. Next, go forth and become the leaders
of tomorrow.

Hail to Pitt!
President, 2007 Student Government Board

The Armenian Classroom was
inspired by a monastery /ibrary.

Spanning the GLOBE

Among the hundreds of rooms in the 42-story
Cathedral of Learning, there are 26 that are
unique: the Nationality Rooms.

Surrounding the Cathedral’s Commons Room,
these active classrooms bring materials from
around the world to recreate historical settings
such as a palace hall in Beijing’s Forbidden
City, a Japanese minka house, and London's
House of Commons.

The idea of former Chancellor John Bowman,
the rooms are overseen by nationality
committees that plan the construction of the
classrooms and look to promote the cultural
heritage of their respective countries. The first
four Nationality Rooms—the German, Russian,

The Indian Room
resembles an ancient
monastic university.

Far Right: Brittany Binder
and Nicole McDermott
discover that the Chinese
Room is a great place to
hold a review session.

Scottish, and Swedish——were finished in 1938.
Plans for new Nationality Rooms, including Latin
American, Finnish, and Turkish rooms, are being
developed for this world—renowned collection.

Beauty and GRACE

Across the lawn from the Cathedral of
Learning sits Heinz Memorial Chapel with
its neo-Gothic architecture and 23 amazing
stained glass windows. The chapel was built
with a donation from Henry John Heinz,
founder of H.J. Heinz Co. Construction began
in 1933, and the building was dedicated to
Heinz and his mother, Anna, in 1938.

The chapel’s 23 windows are the work

of Western Pennsylvania native Charles

J. Connick’s Boston studio. They total
approximately 4,000 square feet and
contain nearly 250,000 pieces of glass.
There are 391 identifiable figures in the
windows, a large supporting cast of
anonymous individuals, and an extensive
variety of flora and fauna. The iconography
combines traditional religious figures and
symbols with historic and cultural figures
that extend from biblical times through the
Middle Ages to the late 19th century.

Today, the nondenominational chapel

is used for about 1,500 events—such as
weddings, concerts, and tours—each year.
The honor of being married in Heinz Chapel
is reserved for University of Pittsburgh
students, alumni, faculty, staff, and board
members, as well as for employees of
H.J. Heinz Co. and the immediate family
members of these groups. When it is
unoccupied, however, the chapel’s doors
are open to the public, enabling them

to experience its elegant charm.

Emily Schuppert

From the exterior to the interior, the neo—Cothic architectural
elements of Heinz Memorial Chapel contribute to the beauty
of the University’s campus.

The intricate doorway of Heinz Memorial Chapel greets visitors as they enter
this historic landmark.

Spirit of OAKLAND

While the Cathedral of Learning is arguably the
University of Pittsburgh’s most notable landmark,
students quickly find their own places—both on
and off campus~—to hold dear to their hearts.

On campus is David Lawrence Hall, known
by virtually all for containing the only computer
lab open 24 hours a day. When the weather
warms up, Soldiers and Sailors Military
Museum and Memorial is known for its
fantastic lawn by anyone looking for a place
to tan or play Frisbee. In the center of Pitt’s
residence halls is Schenley Quadrangle.

In addition to being a popular meeting place,
the ”quad” also provides access to the Book
Center and PNC Bank.

Within a few blocks of campus lie many more
student—identified landmarks. The Original Hot

Forbes Avenue in Oakland

has everything from symphonies
at Carnegie Music Hall to fast
food restaurants.

A Smooth TRANSITION

Coming to college for the first time at the
University of Pittsburgh gives new students
an opportunity to experience life in a large
academic environment. Along with this
life—changing move usually comes a wide
array of emotions: anxiety, fear, excitement—
and that’s just from the parents! Before the
soon—to—be freshmen can even start their lives
as Pitt Panthers, however, they must tackle
their first task: moving in to their dorm rooms.

This is where the Arrival Survival team steps in.

This group of upperclassman volunteers keeps
overwhelmed new students under control by
organizing a move—in schedule and offering
assistance to anyone in need. Trained in giving
directions and armed with free cookies and
bottled water, Arrival Survival volunteers help
Pitt’s incoming students navigate a maze of
blue and yellow carts.

Organizations on campus set up
booths in the quad to help
acclimate students to

the University.

Far Right: Anna Rasshivkina and

With buses shuttling the new arrivals to Target

make the transition from nervous high school
graduate to confident college freshman.

Passing the TORCH

As one of the oldest traditions at the University
of Pittsburgh, Lantern Night welcomes female
freshmen and first—year transfer students to
campus at the beginning of the fall semester.
Started in 1920, this ceremony brings incom-
ing female students together to celebrate their
initiation into a new chapter of their lives.

After receiving their lanterns in the Cathedral
of Learning’s Commons Room, the participants
proceed across the lawn to Heinz Memorial
Chapel. Following a series of inspirational
speeches, female Pitt alumni light the lanterns
of the eager freshmen. This lighting symbolizes
the passing of truth and knowledge as these
freshmen begin a new journey at the University.

Sponsored by the Alumnae Council of the
Pitt Alumni Association and Pitt’s Division
of Student Affairs, Lantern Night is a time-
honored tradition and a special moment
for new students and alumni alike.

Dedicated community involvement, benefit fundrais/ng, member recruiting,
and 5oC/'a/ events are part of Greek life.

Many Creek organizations
use their talents to put on

a performance at the annual
Creek Sing.

It’s All Greek to ME

Although less than 10 percent of the under—
graduate student body is involved in the Greek
system, the impact that Pitt Creek organizations
have on campus life is enormous. If they choose
to get involved, students can elect to join one
of 38 organization chapters, all of which belong
to one of three main governing bodies: the
lnterfraternity Council, Pan—Hellenic Council,
and National Pan—Hellenic Council (NPHC).

With activities ranging from community service
events to mixers, Greek life at Pitt introduces
students to the importance of both giving back
to the community and having good old—fash—
ioned fun. In the past, the Greek community
has sponsored such events as the Pitt Dance
Marathon, a 3K/SK run, Creek Sing, and the
NPHC Step Show.

Fraternities and sororities
host many philanthropic
activities, such as raising
money for cancer research.

Although Creek organizations provide students
with the chance to get involved, they also help
members develop important personal skills.
The educational programs that Greek organi-
zations sponsor help their members establish
important leadership and academic abilities.
With a reputation for excellence, the Greek
system helps to shape its members into model
students and productive members of society.

intermediary, SGB brings the students’ needs
and concerns to the attention of the University
of Pittsburgh administration.

One of the most active committees is allocations,
which annually distributes more than $2 million
to student organizations for activities such as
the homecoming fireworks/laser show, the Black
Action Society fashion show, and Engineering
Week. In 2004, SGB started Light Up Night,
offering activities to showcase the diverse
religious celebrations observed during winter.
SGB also sponsors Panther Pride Campus Wide,

Pitt pride during homecoming week.

A Breath of Fresh AIR

State—of—the—art gym facilities help students
at the University of Pittsburgh stay active.
But the Pitt Outdoors Club offers a great way
to infuse a little nature into bustling city life.

Founded as Robin Hood’s Merry Band in the
late 1960s by a group of outdoor adventure
lovers, the club originally offered caving as its
main activity. Today it offers a diverse range
of activities, such as climbing, caving, white-
water rafting, hiking, skydiving, camping, and
paintball. In addition, the group offers a spring
break trip and two trips to Seneca Rocks, W.Va.,
each year.

Whether socializing on a weekend
or rock climbing in West Virginia,
the Pitt Outdoors C/ub offers an
escape from the city.

No experience is necessary, as seasoned
instructors provide guidance on every trip,
making the club a favorite among students
and faculty who want to experience the best
of the outdoors.

The Student Volunteer Outreach offers an annual fair for students interested in community
volunteer work.

Lending a Helping HAND

The Student Volunteer Outreach (SVO)
provides students with service learning and
community service opportunities by hosting
projects throughout the year.

As part of its program, SVO sends its members

a monthly bulletin that lists the different
service projects available. For extremely busy
students, the organization offers short-term
activities like the annual SVO Orientation Blood
Drive or the Pitt Project Oakland, a campus
cleanup event. Students who choose to be more
involved can take part in yearlong commitments
such as Jumpstart Pittsburgh, a preschool literacy
program, or America Reads Challenge @ Pitt,

a reading tutoring program for grades K-3.

The Alternative Break program is a great way
for students to volunteer during their spring
breaks. Students travel together at low cost
to parts of the United States or Mexico to
participate in service projects sponsored by
local community agencies. Past projects have
included building houses, constructing trails,
and restoring homes for the elderly and
low—income families.

SVO gives students the opportunity to take time
out of their schedules and make a difference for
others, both on and off campus.

Volunteering can range from fixing

a house through the Alternative Break

Black Action SOCIETY

The Black Action Society (BAS) is a student
group that aims to make the Black experience
at the University of Pittsburgh as fulfilling as
possible. The organization is open to students
of all religions, cultures, and races, and its goals
are to advance cultural, social, and political
pursuits and to foster a sense of community
among Black students.

On campus, the members host guest speakers,
tutoring sessions, and events to foster awareness
of important issues. In 2005, BAS sponsored

a visit by Paul Rusesabagina, the heroic hotel
manager whose story inspired Hotel Rwanda.

In 2007, the organization hosted llyasah Shabazz,
daughter of civil rights leader Malcolm X, during
its lndaba ceremony. BAS also organizes
activities, forums, and events and produces

the monthly publication B/acl<Line.

BA5 provides members with
opportunities to voice their
opinions of current events and  
political campaigns. M

Far Right: BA5 Casino Night  
was an anticipated event
during homecoming.

BAS also mentors younger students outside
the University. It connected with the larger
community by attending the 10th anniversary
of the Million Man March in 2005. Through
all its activities, BAS strives to provide a
positive environment for all Black students

at the University.

Meet the PRESS

Creative types with an affinity for media can
turn their ideas into reality on the fourth floor
of the William Pitt Union. The Pitt News,
UPTV, and WPTS FM provide students with
numerous ways to express themselves and
gain experience producing television, radio,
and print media.

The Pitt News is a student—run newspaper with
a daily circulation of 14,000. The newspaper
offers reports on current campus news; editorials;
sports; the opinions of regular columnists; and

a student favorite, the crossword puzzle.

UPTV broadcasts 24 hours a day and features
student—made productions. Students have the
opportunity to turn their ideas into television
shows and films, and in the process, many
students get the chance to work on the
productions’ casts and crews.

The staff of The Original meets
to discuss the upcoming edition
of the magazine.

Far Right: Michael Haley and
Nicole Rosato, members of the
business division of The Pitt
News, manage finances and

UPTV members film their
productions around campus.

92.1 FM, Pitt’s radio station, can be heard
anywhere within 30 miles of campus. Run by
students, the station features a mix of music
from independent labels as well as a morning '
show and an afternoon news and sports show.

Whether your talents lie in writing or producing,
or if you just have that ”radio voice,” you can
find your creative niche somewhere within Pitt's
media hub.

In the SCRUM

Some rugby teams tell their rookies that rugby
is more than a sport—it’s a disease that you
catch. The passion for the game is evident in
the University of Pittsburgh club rugby teams.
As school gets under way each fall, Pitt’s rugby
teams are practicing on either the Cathedral of
Learning lawn or at the Charles L. Cost Sports
Center, preparing for their next matches.

The men’s team begins practicing in August,
and its season runs through October. Although
the fall season is short, the competition

is fierce. Led by Head Coach Dan Talbert,
the Panthers take on teams such as West
Virginia and Slippery Rock universities.

When the weather warms up in the spring
semester, the team takes the field yet again
for a lighter—but still enjoyable-—spring
season. Though the spring season is important
in terms of competition, its main purpose

is to prepare for the following fall season.

While the men’s rugby team has been around
for a while, the women’s team was started
in 2003; since then, the number of players
has climbed from four to 70.

Both teams have quickly become popular
for players who aren't afraid to take a cleat
to the face and enthusiastic fans who enjoy
the games.

  STUDENT LIFE

 

Moving away from home entails
picking up extra responsibilities,
including doing laundry.

Home Away from HOME

Moving out of their parents’ house and into

a building full of strangers is just one rite of
passage most freshmen experience when they
are assigned their first dorm room. Dormitory
life can provide a student with the means

of living in a learning environment that teaches
them both academically and socially.

Living with new people can be daunting

at first but can provide students with some of
the best experiences of their lives. All freshmen
admitted through the Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid are guaranteed a dorm room on
campus. The University of Pittsburgh offers
five housing options with space for more than
4,000 freshmen. The largest housing facility
is Litchfield Towers.

Sutherland Hall, located on 
upper campus, has its own
fitness center, computer lab,
and dining facility.
Far Right: A student signs in to
Holland Hall, the only a//-female
residence hall on campus.

48

Dorm life gives students an opportunity
to interact and grow. Friendships made in a
student’s freshman year frequently carry on
through senior year and beyond.

On Your OWN

While living on campus is convenient, many
students choose to live off campus in an apart-
ment or house after their freshman year at the
University of Pittsburgh. Living off campus
provides intangibles that dorm life usually does
not. Privacy, a strong sense of ownership, and
your own bathroom are just a few of the perks
a student will find living off campus.

Living in an apartment or house demands a
new level of responsibility not needed in dorm
life. Suddenly, rent is due every month, as are
the cable, electric, and gas bills.

However, these aspects of off—campus living

help to build character while molding students
into well—rounded adults. Somewhere between
paying the bills, washing the dishes, and

her belongings as she unpacks

South Oak/and.

scrubbing the bathroom sink, students gain a
certain respect for money and property and
find that a well-maintained apartment can
serve as a viable home away from home.
And along the way, students take the next step
into life after college.

l From Here to THERE

All college students face their share of

challenges, whether it's pulling an a|l—nighter
or getting stuck with a nightmare of a room-
mate. But commuter students face other
challenges on a daily basis: Will the bus be
on time? Will there be parking?

Armed with a Pitt ID, students can ride any
Port Authority bus in Allegheny County for
free, leaving the commuter student to worry
only about the bus schedule and the effects
Pittsburgh weather can have on it. While snow
and ice may still be a problem, the commuter
with a car can throw that bus schedule away
as long as he or she has a handful of quarters
and time to hunt for a parking space—no easy
task around campus, where parking spaces
are rare and garages can be expensive.
Occasionally, the excitement of finding

a broken meter eases the pain of parking

in Oakland.

With no dorm room to retreat to, commuters
might find simple tasks like studying, eating
lunch, or just relaxing between classes daunt-
ing. Luckily for Pitt commuters, the fall 2007
semester marked the opening of a new lounge
designed just for them. The goal is to give
commuter students a home away from home
by providing them with a microwave, coffee
maker, big-screen TVs, and a study area.

While living off campus does provide luxuries
not found in a cramped dorm room, one might
consider a surprise trigonometry test less of

a hassle than commuting.

/Odi Temyer if A  if    

Riding a bicycle is one way to avoid feeding a parking
meter or getting an expensive ticket.

Students may opt for work—study
opportunities such as jobs in the
University mail room.

All in a Day’s WORK

Landing a job, whether on campus or off, is
probably one of the most rewarding experiences
a college student can have. While balancing
school and part—time employment may not be

the easiest task in the world, it has many benefits.

Working part time while in college boosts your
resume by showing off good time management
skills and a strong work ethic, and employers
often make great references in the future. An
obvious perk to a job is, of course, the money,
which may be used to pay bills or just for fun.

University of Pittsburgh students can find em-
ployment at school, through either the work—study
program or the student employment center in
the William Pitt Union. For fall 2007, the work-
study program alone employed more than
1,200 Pitt students in jobs all over Pittsburgh.

By using FutureLinks, Career Servicesfcareer
management system, Pitt students can search
for employment opportunities such as being

a tour guide, a peer tutor, or an office assistant.

Whether you are waiting tables, folding
clothes, or filing paperwork, there is no better
preparation for the real world than having a job
during college.

Being a Pitt Panther means something different
for each student. Maybe you feel most like a
Pitt Panther when you step inside the Cathedral
of Learning for the first time each semester

or see it towering in the skyline. Certain
students might ﬁnd being a Pitt Panther is
stepping into a crowded Heinz Field, packed
with cheering Pitt football fans.

Being a Pitt Panther could mean knowing
that you have a world of knowledge at your
ﬁngertips through our library system and
world-renowned faculty. Or it could mean
feeling connected to more than 250,000
alumni worldwide who always will be part
ofthe Pitt family.

For many, being a Pitt Panther means being
part ofa community, one that is larger than
Oakland,]ohnstown, Bradford, Greensburg,
and Titusville combined. It’s bigger than

the city of Pittsburgh or even the United States.
Being a Pitt Panther means representing your
alma mater on a global scale and knowing that
you have the tools to succeed in life.

lives. With eight committees, PPC makes sure
students never have a dull moment on campus. PPC also serves as the students’ travel agent.

The organization sponsors trips to destinations

PPC organizes activities such as bonfires, pep
rallies, and spelling bees during the academic
year. Lifehouse, Relient K, and Nas are just a
few of the musical acts PPC has brought to
campus in recent years. Annual events,

like Canada, Las Vegas, and Cancun to ensure

A Diverse PERSPECTIVE

Created in 1997, PITT ARTS aims to introduce
students to the different fine and performing
arts Pittsburgh has to offer. Students can be
certain to find an activity that interests them
with events such as operas, symphonies,
ballets, concerts, plays, and art exhibitions.

PITT ARTS organizes programs that provide
students with free tickets, transportation, food,
and one—on—one sessions with entertainers
after a performance. To celebrate its 10th
anniversary in 2007, PITT ARTS partnered
with the Office of Student Life to bring free
lunchtime performances every Wednesday to
the Lower Lounge of the William Pitt Union.

With their Pitt IDs, students gain free admission
to Phipps Conservatory and Botanical
Gardens; the Mattress Factory; the Carnegie

Museums of Art and Natural History; the Andy

Warhol Museum; and, a new addition for
the 2007-08 academic year, the Senator John

Take a BREAK

Every year, University of Pittsburgh students
look forward to that one week that marks
half of a semester completed and a chance
to celebrate it: spring break. Though the
weather in Pittsburgh is usually still close to
freezing and it seems like the snow will never
end, Pitt students always find a way to make
the best of those seven days.

For some students, it means a week of
home—cooked meals and free laundry back
home. Some find their way to Cancun,
Mexico, or one of Florida's beaches, while
other students choose an alternative spring
break. The Student Volunteer Outreach links
students with volunteer projects, such as
building houses, that help those in need.

No matter how students spend the time off,
there is still half a semester to finish, and
classes pick up where they left off. But coming
back to school seems so much easier to do
with a spring break tan.

Whether they choose to participate in an alternative break
program or hit the beach, students have many opportunities
to get away during spring break.

before the start of the semester
with an off—campus retreat.

Above and BEYOND

Headquartered on the 35th and 36th floors of
the Cathedral of Learning, the University Honors
College (UHC) was founded in 1986 to benefit
the University of Pittsburgh's exceptionally
motivated and talented students.

UHC opens the door to any academically
motivated student who wants a challenge.

In addition to rigorous courses in many subject
areas, there are opportunities such as the
Mongolia and Yellowstone Field Studies programs
and the Brackenridge Undergraduate Fellowships,
which offer Pitt students the chance to conduct
research on a project of their own choosing
during the summer instead of working the
typical summer job at a local burger joint.

Honors students still find time in their busy
schedules to participate in some of the many
social activities hosted by the Student Honors

UHC sponsors events

such as a semiformal dance
on the Gateway Clipper and

undergraduate research fairs. c

Activity Council, including the annual Gateway
Clipper semiformal dance, the Pizza and Prose

Real-world Building BLOCKS

An internship can be the key to the professional
world for students studying almost any discipline.
Internships provide real—world experience,

an important mark on one’s résumé. The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh helps students find internships
in many different ways.

There are numerous resources to aid the student
seeking an internship. Pitt’s Career Services
offers PantherTRACS, a database through which
students can search for opportunities specific

to their fields of study. Students searching for an
internship also will find the Office of Experiential ,
Learning to be a valuable resource.

Pitt academic programs, help to place students
whose interests match the programs’ work and
mission. The Institute of Politics helps place
students with elected officials in the Pittsburgh
area, while through the School of Arts and
Sciences, students can apply for the Anthony
and Concetta Ambrosio Internship Award,

an internship at CBS Corp. in New York City.

Backed with a degree from Pitt and internship
experience, any graduate is armed with the tools

to take on the real world.

A World of INFORMATION

During their time at the University of Pittsburgh,
students will undoubtedly find themselves in
one of Pitt's many libraries. Hillman Library,
located in the heart of campus, is the flagship
facility of the University Library System (ULS).

In addition to the resources at Hillman Library,
several academic departments at Pitt have

their own libraries. Armed with the resources
of ULS—which includes access to 3.9 million
volumes, more than 25,000 electronic

journal titles, and more than 170,000 electronic
books—a Pitt student will never lack information
to complete even the most rigorous of assign-
ments or research projects.

Hi//man Library is a popular
study location where study ' -

the hustle and bustle of
students’ busy lives.

the outstanding academic accomplishments
of its students.

In addition, Pitt undergraduates are recognized
nationally for their academic achievements,
leadership roles, and community service.

The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, Rhodes

just a few of the many prestigious awards Pitt
students have received.

Pitt’s own Brackenridge Undergraduate
Fellowship gives students the opportunity
to conduct independent research in the
summer and participate in discussions in the
humanities and sciences. The University
Honors College also provides academic
opportunities, including the Chancellor's
Undergraduate Teaching and Research
fellowships, in which students work with
faculty members inside and outside the
classroom. The University also offers
Nationality Rooms scholarships that help
alleviate the costs of studying abroad

in the summer.

With the growing number of scholarships
and opportunities for research, students
continue to receive recognition for their
dedication to academia.

team successful.

Set Up for SUCCESS

Led by Head Coach Chris Beerman, the
University of Pittsburgh women’s volleyball
team is taking the college volleyball scene by
storm. For. the past several years, the team has
worked hard to become a dominating force on
the court, and it has found great success.

Since Beerman was hired in 2000, he has
coached his team to 100 wins and back—to—
back NCAA Tournament runs. In 2003, the
Panthers won their 11th Big East championship
with a victory over the University of Notre
Dame——an exceptional achievement because
this was the first time the Fighting Irish had suf-
fered a Big East loss on their home court.

Aided by the leadership of the 2004 Big East
Rookie of the Year, Diana Andreyko, the team
celebrated another successful season in 2006.
Pitt finished the regular season with a win over
DePaul University, bringing the Big East season
record to 10-4. With a team as strong as ever,
the Panthers aim for another winning season.

Brittany Tha/er

The women’s volleyball team steadily
works toward becoming a dominating
force. In its final record for the 2007
season, the squad shut out eight teams.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH 0 2008 91

 

The Pitt swim team continues
to be one of the most successful
Panther athletic teams.

Different ST ROKES

The 2007—O8 swimming and diving teams at
the University of Pittsburgh recruited a strong
group of six new athletes. Led by Head Coach
Chuck Knoles, who is in his 18th year coaching
the men's program and sixth coaching the
women at Pitt, both teams are pursuing
recognition as one of the top teams in the east
in Division I athletics.

In 2007, Adam Plutecki broke a record for both
Trees Pool and Pitt in the 200 meter breaststroke
with a time of 1:58.98. Plutecki continued that
season to set two more school records, one in
the 100 meter breaststroke and another in the
200 meter individual medley.

While undergraduate students are setting
new standards in Trees Pool, alumni are

Both men’s and women’s
teams started the 2007 
season with three
consecutive wins.

making headlines as well. Recent graduate
Kristin Brown, who formerly was on Pitt’s swim-
ming and diving team, qualified for the 2008
Olympic trials.

The team's immediate past has been impressive.
Pitt men have won 11 swimming and diving
Big East titles under Knoles, and the women's
team was the conference runner—up in 2005,
making for a bright future.

In recent years, the University of Pittsburgh

strong competitor at both the team and
individual levels, and now it has a new home
in the recently renovated gymnasium in
Trees Hall.

In 2004, Head Coach Debbie Yohman led the
Panthers to beat their biggest rival, Pennsylvania
State University, for the first time in more than
20 years. Throughout the past two seasons,
the gymnastics team has earned a variety of
achievements. During the 2004-05 season,
Leila Tait qualified for the NCAA Gymnastics
Championships. Last season, the team
advanced to the NCAA Regional Champion-
ships in Michigan.

A combination of a stellar coaching staff and
a competitive group of women has led the
team to receive nationwide attention. As a
result of the team's hard work during previous
seasons and in the off-season, the 2007-08
Panther gymnasts surely will prove to be one
of the best teams yet.
