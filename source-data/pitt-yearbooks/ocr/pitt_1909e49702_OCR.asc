ROSS CHESTER MOHLER.

The fellow with the lovely curly hair. Deposed
Sunday School superintendent. Eats only one meal
per day (all day). Motor boat specialist, but not of
Gillette type. \Vaited for a certain train and was ill
for a week after (lady in the case). Noted basket-
ball performer, especially at Sharpsburg. Shark on
air coinpressors. Does not like fudge.

EDWIN BAXTER MCKEE.

“Juml)o”' is the only real ladies’ man in his sec-
tion—red hair preferred. Mountain climber several
nights a week. Gets to school on time sometimes.
Is working up “Gas Producers” for his thesis because
he feels particularly ﬁtted for such work. Tallest man
in class. Never stole a pie at a church social.

CHARLES MELCHOR ROUTH.

"Pete" holds all the municipal offices in Munhall
from burgess up to “white wing,” and intends run-
ning for President on the “Anti—Tobacco ticket."
Runs to Gayety shows and noisy ties. Very clever at
watch repairing and specialist on lunches. Another
"Gas Producer” man.

ELECTRICAL

J. EDGAR KNOTT.

It has been maliciously reported that Edgar oc-
casionally studies, but the faculty indignantly denies
the rumor. Co—eds and the Courant lead him a merry
chase, but the pace is never too hot. Can soak up
more fun to the square inch than anyone in school.
Owns a heart, but it is never at home. Has to wear
reversible linen since running the Courant.

CLARENCE A. BODDIE.

llas broken into more power plants than the rest
of the cla.ss ever saw. He glories in his knowledge of
machinery. A crank on mathematics. Sometimes
called 3.1416 (pi). A friend of the chancellor( ?). He
wears a family necktie and a shirt which he picked
himself. Has contradicted all the authors of stand-
ard electrical works. He’s great. Everybody ought
to know him. '

CHARLES LEE INGLEFIELD.

“Ink” is a fellow with that indeﬁnable air of the
cool sort of fellow who never seems to be working
just now, but is always ready when it comes to the
Finish. He sits i11 the library with all the girls smiling
upon him and never notices or gets excited. He just
passes his hand back over the haircut which he says
the Civic Improvement Club of his native town gave
him and, c—a—l-m—like, cracks a joke on Price; but
never, or rather seldom, rarely, scarcely ever, if at
all. does he address a lady directly. Yet he is a ladies’
favorite, class favorite, president of the Electrical
Club, president of the class of ’08, and “dark horse”
in the race for the future position of “our greatest
man."

DAVID RALPH PRICE.

Doesn't grow far from the ground, but is highly
concentrated. \Valkecl to Conneaut Lake last sum—
mer, and is getting rested now. One of the few elect
who enjoy a perfect understanding with the librarian.
Known from Soho to Beaver Falls as the teller of
doubtful tales. Sometimes troubled with a rush of
thought to the head, but is otherwise healthy.

K. MCCURDY SMITH.

Smith has a natural bend for machinery which
he acquired while handling the plow back on the farm.
This accounts also for that look of culture which
illuminates his countenance (we mean agriculture).
He learned the ways of a large city very easily (moved
three times last year). Claims to have a scheme to
lighten man's burden——by letting the women do the
work, we think. He's been with us for three years,
but we know only two things about him——he belongs

to the class of ’OS, and lives on a farinsomewhere in
Pennsylvania.

CHARLES ALEXANDER TURNER.

Vv’e can’t get Turner into the Courant room be
cause he can’t ﬁnd room for his feet. He claims that
wireless telephony can be made successful if the
speakers are less than ten feet apart. (Marconi and
others take notice.) Has applied all the tests known
to electrical science to Berger’s choir and has decided
that no harmonics are present. Charles knows a few
things, all right, but he doesn’t want to tell.

CIVIL ENGINEERING

ROBERT BRECKENRIDGE BLACKBURN.

One of the good boys of the class, who always makes it a point to be on
hand at chapel promptly at 10:15. Takes such a serious View of life that he only
smiles annually. Is a great lover of mathematics, especially Calculus.

NORMAN MACLOUD BROWN.

“l}uster" is what he is called, and he usually occupies that role when the
fair sex are within a radius of a hundred miles. Is also an expert at “busting”
ﬁvers, especially when there is a good show at the Gayety. Sporty chap, ﬁne
fellow, and good at handling the racket. VV ill be heard from some day, but it is
hard to say just how.

JOHN TITREVILLE CAMPBELL.

A shark in every sense of the word. One who swallows up every bit of
knowledge in sight, and, like our old friend, Ollie Twist, asks for more. Although
hardly what you would call a handsome fellow, he becomes so when you get to
know him. A chap who always has time to lend a helping hand to a less brilliant
classmate. Goes after the hard things in the right way and comes up smiling.

ALBERT SMITH FRAZIER.

Has a great advantage over the other members of the class in that he lives
right opposite the school, and therefore has twice as much time for study. All
this time is taken up by him, and it is said he at times will not leave his books
even for his meals. Has been known to go without sleep for a week before a
Calculus lesson.

96

WILLIAM ELMSLIE MILLAR.

Named after “Bob” Emslie, the baseball umpire, but later had another “l”
inserted so you coldn’t tell it. Has the distinction of being the only man to pass
the re—exam in Analytics. ls a poor bluffer and usually gives himself away to the
profs. by an inquisitive look in their direction when he isn’t positive. VVill get
wiser, doubtless, in a few years.

JAMES MILNOR ROBERTS.

Stubby, but there with the goods. Bears the reputation of being a good scout,
and is the chief asset of the Sophs in athletic events. Although he bears the very
honorable position of treasurer of the class, was never known to steal more than
a thousand dollars of its funds at a time. Got his position on account of his
ability to “bone” for band money on football days. Believes in making the Fresh
show proper respect to their superiors at all times.

ROBERT ENGLISH NEELD.

Took so much compassion on the class on account of its rapidly diminishing
size that he decided to cast in his fortunes with it. “Bob” has at last decided to
get down to hard work and has made a good record this year. Bears a natural
hatred towards the Fresh (probably because he ﬂunked so many studies when he
was one of them), and is always open for a chance to torment the poor things.

JOHN FARRIS, A.B.

A big, brainy fellow, who came to us from the University of \7Visconsin.
Said he had been having a good time all his life and wanted to get down to hard
work. Can be depended on to deliver the goods under all circumstances.

DARRELL BLACK.

We lost Libby, but look who we have to ﬁll his shoes. He has all the quali-
ﬁcations of our former leader—-—love for study, ability to get exempted, inability
to ﬂunk, etc. Had his hair cut “hatchet style” and looks like a convict. Travels
back and forward every (lay past Marshalsea, but so far has escaped the notice of
the keepers. Loves to play footbal1—fro1n the side lines. VVon his athletic
initials at VV. &  Academy—-no one knows how, but probably on account of
his ability to keep quiet when such action means bliss.

FRANK MURRAY CRUM.

A welcome addition to the class this year, who can work the hard ones with
the best of them. A good—natured_ chap, who has seen some of the actual ﬁght and
knows how to apply the knowledge he gained while dodging the bullets. Doesn't
know what “quit” means.

CARL E. DAVIS.

He is the \V11p edition of the Pittsburg Press, President of the Soph Class,
Athletic Editor on the Courant, and all ’round utility man. Very obliging and
always looking out for the interests of the alma mater. So modest that he
wouldn’t write up himself for this column, although he performed that ofﬁce for
his classmates.

EDGAR HARPER SINGER.

A good, hard student, whose name usually appears on the exempt list. Has
the knack of sticking at a thing, no matter how hard it is at first, and can be
counted on to die ﬁghting.

ALLEN ROBERT TAYLOR.

One of the real good students of the class and a very decent sort of a fellow.

Possessed such good judgment that he came clear from Washington to enter
VVup.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

ROBERT WEDDELL BRICKER.

A shark at everything but his studies. Prefers pool to calculus and a good
meal to both of them. A good fellow, who is inclined to worry about his studies
at times and grow pessimistic, although the white lights usually cheer him up and
he forgets his troubles. The girls say he is handsome; and they, of course, are the
judges. \/Von the title and his letters in tennis, and in consequence sports a nice
sweater. Takes graft for Barney Dreyfuss at the ball park in the summer.

RICHARD w. FISHER, JR.

A boy who early in life resolved to never trouble trouble, and in consequence
has been living in blissful ignorance of the worries which beset the rest of the
Sophs. “Poor Richard" absolutely refuses to worry, even if it rains a little and
has a healing inﬂuence over Bricker during some of the dark days of the latter's
existence. Is a shark at bowling, if not at anything else, and the “Fresh” will do
well to steer clear of him.

98

WILLIAM WALTER KNOTTS.

“The sunshine of Paradise Alley.” The continual smile which spreads itself
continually over the countenance of this lad is enough to start “Gloomy Gus”
roaring. Has more wit than Eli Perkins ever dreamed of and has Mark Twain
skinned a mile. Handed out the goods in track work and one of the best distance
men in this end of the State. Kids his opponents so that they can’t run,——that’s
how he wins. Is also able to tie plenty of knots in the chain of reasoning; and
“That will do, Ur. Knotts” is a common expression after he gets through shoot~
ing the hot air at the profs.

SAMUEL ROBBINS.

His mother calls him “Sammy,” his father calls him “Sam”; but he says his
name is “S—a—m—u—e—l,” with a special noise on the last three letters. Gained a
great reputation during his Freshman year on account of his ability to run the
hundred in 16 seconds, although he has since parted with some of the fuzz off his
pedals, and with the reduction in friction is said to be able to do it in 15.99999
plus. Laying all joking aside, though, “Sammy” isn’t half bad and has shown
some of the wise ones that he has a good-sized package of the goods.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING

EUGENE CLARE FERREE.

Pronounced by everyone the ﬁnest fellow in the class. Doesn’t have to bluff
to get through. Only ﬂunk is in public speaking. Bashful as a kitten, but at
times gets up enough nerve to speak to Miss P when the fellows aren't
looking. When he sees this, though, he will cut it out. Now see if he doesn't.

CHARLES WESLEY KINCAID.

If “Charlie” Wesley knew that he has such a namesake, he would certainly
wake up for a few minutes and view his massive form. Is so tall that when he
eats hot soup from a spoon it cools on the way up. On this account he has had a
special law passed by the Etiquette Society of VVup so that he may drink it from
the bowl. Takes a shoe-maker two years making his shoes, and his tailor has been
working on his graduation suit since the day he entered school. Dean Swift is
said to have seen him before writing Gulliver’s Travels. Has the habit of making
a noise like an automobile—evidently because he is afraid of tramping on some
average—sized person. Studies are so easy for him that he never gives them any
thought. His mind is taken up with larger things.

99

HAROLD APPO HAYNES.

A nice dispositioned little fellow, who,’according to Prof. Davis, possesses the
most melodious voice in the class. Like Taylor, he decided to eat smoke for four
years and let Teddy Roosevelt run \Vashington as he pleased.

HARRY SAMUEL REIZENSTEIN.

A splendid fellow, who has lost considerable time on account of ill health
this year. \’Ve hope to see him out next spring in good shape for hard work.

ROBERT WILLIAM RICHARDS.

The Hercules of the Sophomore class, “Tex, The Boy \7Vonder,” The pride
of Perrysville Avenue, etc., etc.,—in fact, anything nice you can say about him.
Showed his nerve by playing football under Morehead and soon rose from the
“dub” ranks. \Vatch for him on the ’Varsity next year. Good student, although
he persists in calling that favorite study of the Sophs "Cakulus.” Has thrown
away the old blue shirt he wore during his Freshman year, and now sports a nice
clean high standin’ every morning. Said to have a girl on the string, which
accounts for it.

ARTHUR VINCENT WYNNE.

A nice, easy—going fellow, who makes it a point not to bother his gray matter
about anything. Strong points,—German and P. 5. As he is a member of
Berger’s specially selected “What—is—it,” Dutch comes natural to him. Although
no one has ever heard him sing, is said to have a good voice. V\/as never known
to get mad, and has a disposition as sweet as milk.

MINING ENGINEERING

REED MORRISON LEWIS.

So windy that all class rooms in which he recites l1ave to be equipped with
double strength window glass to prevent its blowing out when once he gets
started. Literally eats ’em alive. heads and all, when it comes to study; and we
take off our hats to him when we note how he made up the two months’ work
which he missed at the start of the term through sickness. He also lost his hair
in the melee, but, judging from the way he waded into matters on his return to
school, the effect wasn’t the same as with our mutual friend, Samson. There are
lots of worse fellows than “\7Vi11(ly,” and he will surely shine some day, even if
it does take some rubbing to produce the star—like effect.

We’re hunting a word to rhyme with Bash.

Hash, lash, mash, rash, sash, smash,

Slash, trash, brash.

0, say, can you see through the dust in the gym,
The vision of glory in darkness so dym?

It sheds all around it a glorious light-

’Tis “Si” in his suit of the Gold and the "White.

I-IANS WEBER.

Do you think there is another

Who can crack those jokes? Not much!
In this land there is no other

Who can “spring burn gags” like Dutch.

JAMES THOMPSON MCLEOD.

Wilkinsburg, poor Wilkinsburg!
Jim McLeod’s from Wilkinsburg.
O! that is hard on Wilkinsburg,
It’s pretty hard on Wilkinsburg.
Wilkinsburg, poor Wilkinsburg!
Awful tough for Wilkinsburg.

Class 1908.
CLARENCE SAMUEL ALLISON.

“He who throws and runs away
Shall live to throw another day.”

“Sam” has developed into quite a student this
year, since he has left the mill. Aside from his being
a typical medical student, “Sam” is a pretty good fel-
low. ’

 

JAMES METHENY BARR.
“He could, if he would, but he won’t.”

This is Jim, the joker and poet and general favor-
ite of the class. He has been guilty of writing several
songs since becoming a student, among which was “My
Bonnie Has Tuberculosis,” etc., etc. Member of Glee
Club and Y. M. C. A. quartet. Chairman of com-
mittee which was to write up the boys for the "Owl”
-—bnt was afraid and backed down.

 

I08

FRANKLIN EMERY BEERS.
“My life is one darned horrid grind."

A genuine plugger is Beers. He started a little
behind and has since Chosen “Proctology” for his spe-
cialty. Has “batched it” for four years, but antici-
pates matrimony soon. Beers, we wish you success.

JOHN BUCHANAN BOOZ.
“Never say that Fate’s against you.”

Came to us for his fourth year from North \\='est-
ern University with a good reputation. A bad name,
but a good fe1low—:1 Ma/1.

FRANCIS CHARLES BOUCEK.
“In speaking of him they called him. the stiff.”

Here’s one of the Allegheny Dutch; isn’t a
butcher, either. He is Sell’s right hand bower. In»
terne in Reineman Hospital and Assistant in Depart-
ment oi Nose and Throat in College Dispensary.

I09

CHARLES LEON BOWMAN.

“A kind of man who was tolerated, generally laughed
at, and seldom hated.”

“Chai-lie’s" motto is “Always look before you
leap,” which isn't half bad at that. A good student;

hard to ﬁnd a more consscientious fellow. He will
make good.

‘WILLIAM SCHULER BROADHURST.

“They don't make them any better.”

A good all around scout; fat and chubby. Not
anemic. Has been married to Farquhar for two years.
“15ill" has come in strong on the last lap.

FRANCIS M. CALDWELL.

“Old, but not too tough.”

He is following in the footsteps of “Gray” and
swears by Lazarus-llarlow. Frank is a Grand Old
Man; comes to school when there is nothing doing in
politics i11 his ward. Does not believe in race suicide.

IIO

WILL JAMES CAVANAGH.

“Behold! See what his tailor hath made him.”

“Reh” is no han(l—me-(lown; he’s there with the
rags. lnterne Reineman Hospital and Physiological
Chemist of College Dispensary. \\7hat more can one
say?

JAMES WOOLSLAYER CLARK.
“For every inch that is not ﬂesh is rogue.”
./'\ fair student. If his gray matter is in propor-
tion to his personal esteem. he will make great strides
in Medicine.

JOHN MOORE CONWAY.

“Cou1dn’t jump out of a boat and hit the water.”

"]ack” has been vaccinated 47 times at the Fest
Ilouse and still believes in the virus. He is immune
to all known diseases. Has been lnterne at the Mn-
nicipal Hospital for three years and expects to make
“Diagnosis” his lcmg suit.

III

RALPH EMERSON CUMMINGS.
‘‘All I am here for is a parchment.”
Has been orderly at St. _]ohn’s Hospital for some
time; is no longer a regular student, just a visitor.
Belongs to the “runt gang.”

JOHN CLARENCE DIXON.
“Silent as the Sphinx, but stronger yet is he.”
This is our ]ohn—a little, but mighty man. “_Iacl<”
is our class historian, which office he has ﬁlled most
awfully (well). Doesn't talk——only thinks.

JOSEPH CALVIN EDGAR.
“A handsome wretch.”
“Joe” is our “1nop—stick” from Illinois. A valued
past member of Foot Ball Squad and Basket Ball

Team. An all round nian. Reports to the family the
orders of the class. “]oe" will win out.

II2

DANIEL MATTHEW EVANS.

“Troubled with an atrophied conscience, due to lack
of use.”

Here are “Dan” and his little red beard. Has de-
veloped quite an extensive obstetrical practice. Side
partner to “N an” in all exams.

JOHN WILLIAM FARQUHAR.
“His face long enough to eat oats out of a churn.”
J-")hn is developing slowly, but surely, both men-
tally and physically. He is quite proﬁcient in diseases
of the chest. Nothing real bad about John.

JOHN EDWARD FERRINGER.
“A face that never smiles is never good.”
Here is “Baldy’s” likeness, but his crown of glory
is covered by his “mortar.” ’Twere better so, for
John thinks that a bald-headed man takes a horrible

picture. Rolled pills for one summer. A great favor-
ite of Dr. Riggs.

I13

 
 

WILLIAM COLVIN FROST.
“Looks as though he had a perpetual toothache.”

“Braggo” is a cold proposition. A lawyer, soldier,
whisky gauger, physician, and knocker. "]ack”' is
feay'fu.l‘.y and wonderfully made. Incompatible with
all known therapeutical agents and to all ideas not
originated within himself. Verily, l1e is a student. In
CO1’1_]11I‘1C‘[i01‘i with his Drug Store we anticipate a great
future for him—“go it, Jack!” He was our ﬁrst
President. Nuf Ced.

HARRISON HORTON FISHER.
“Not the fault of nature, simply a mistake.”
Dry weather prophet. A regular IO 0’cloci<

scholar. Expects to take a “post” in Germany on
Diseases of Children. O, “nipples!”

N. ARTHUR FISCHER.
“He is too great a fool to know better.”

Champion note taker of class—what he di(lr;’t get
from the Profs, he gets from Martin, Interne Reine-
inan Hospital and assistant in Departinent of Surgery
at College 1‘.>ispensary. ‘He is bright, in front rank
(semi) in class a “shiny i11 deed.”

II4

RALPH DANA GOODWIN.
“What an immense delusion this stuﬁ is.”

His motto—-—“I think we had better wait awhile.”
“Nat” is a top-notcher, although he is in the K. C.
insanity Expert. Assistant to Diseases of Heart and
Lungs, and Mental and Nervous Chair. Internc at
lxeinenian Hospital. Has a wheel out himself.

JACOB A. GREK‘IN.
“To have and to hold.”

The sage of the class. The supreme court: no
grafter. A hard student; you can depend 011 “Jake.”

CLARENCE ALEXANDER HAMEL.
“A specialist on the skin and its contents.”
“Ham” is a typical Medical Student—no bad
habits, except to spend money lavishly on a certain

fair one. Con ratulations “Ham”; we know 0111'
I .
finish.

I15

  

PERCY KAUFMAN HELLER.
“G. U., but I feel tough! I feel quite injected.”

He carries an awful name, but is a good fellow.
A disciple of Neisser. Assistant in Genito-Urinary
Diseases, and Interne at Reineman Hospital. Percy is
a genuine “Heller.”

JAMES I-IODGKISS.
“What more could he do than for us he hath done?”

President of our class, a real student, and a friend
of all the boys. “Jim” hails from the mountain top,
and will always stand high.

WILLIAM JOHNS.

“An innocent, guileless child of nature.”

Quiet, but there with the go0ds—that's John “in
a nut-shell.” He will pass the State Board ; he took
Glynn’s Quiz.

II6

CHESTER BEMIS JOHNSON.
“His very looks are prayers.”

“Sam” has had his share of physical ailments
since beginning Medicine. Fell by the wayside three
infectious times, but still stands in front rank of class.
Interne Reineman Hospital and Assistant to Chair of
Pediatrics in College Dispensary.

CHARLES BARTON KEEBLER.
“Put on your hat,—you’re half naked.”
“Short” on hair, but “long” on knowledge. “Keb”
comes from a good family, but you wouldn’t think it.

After all, you have to go some to head off “Keb.” He
looks “professional.”

DAVID DICKEY KENNEDY.
“A modern Longfellow, but not a dead one.”
A man’s legs should be long enough to reach the
ground——“Dave’s" are. A piece of ﬁne workmanship.
‘‘Judge'’ is Chief Medicine Man in the College Dis-

pensary and Interne at Reineman Hospital. Hold back
the head, “Dave.”

117

RICHARD ANDREW KING.
“Solemn as an owl and empty as a cask.”

“Skinny” won’t set the world on ﬁre unless he
uses that strong baseball arm of his. Formerly roomed
with Bowman. Interne at Reineman Hospital and as-
sistant in Diseases of Skin :11" College Dispensary. How
did you pull it?

CLARENCE EUGENE KING.
“He was a good singer before Time came into fashion.”
Look who’s here! VVhy, it’s “Rowdy House
Gene,” side kicker of Ram’s. You always know he is
around when he twists your ear. Leader of Y. M.

C. A. quartet. Always happy, although “his bonnie
has only one lung.” Come on, Remorse!

MARTIN EDWARD KOHN.
“This wondrous head carries many a bump.”
“A thing of beauty is a joy forever.” This has
nothing to do with him, however. Martin has labored

under many difﬁculties, but has mastered the art. Look
out for “Diabetes Mart.”

118

JOHN KUBUS, M.D.
“What’s in a name? He’s a doctor, just the same.”
Attended Chicago National Medical University
and the American College of Medicine and Surgery.
Speaks all languages. Is now taking a “post” at

W. U. 13., although he has traveled ’way ’round the
world.

SYLVESTER JACOB LACKEY.
T‘A close proposition as a husband.”

“Lack” is leading the double lifc—two ﬁne girls,
too.‘ His evolution into a real good student was a
most pleasing change. Loves his Meerschaum pipe.
Authority on baseball. “Pass the Egg-O—See." “Lack”
will prove worthy of his calling.

NAN MAY LATIMER.
“She has a face like a benediction.”
Here is “Fighting B0b’s” rear admiral. Behold!
the hair upon my head is turning gray. What “Nan”

knows, she can tell; therefore, the boys all love her on
exam. day.

II9

HACKETT J. LYNCH.
“So crooked he could hide behind a cork-screw.”
“Mike” will always make his “bi—mamials” with
his right l1ar1(l. A nice fellow and a good student.

FRANKE EARL MAGEE.
“What man dare, I dare.”
“Well! Well! Well! \7Vell, now, I tell you, the
ﬁrst thing I would do would be to wash out his stom-
ach." "Frankie” is a good fellow-student and well

thought of. He expects to locate at Gravel Creek,
where he has four friends.

THOMAS HENRY MANLEY, JR.

“A vile fellow he, yet we like him."

Take a good look at Mrs. Rossiter No. 2. An-
other mcmber of the “runts”; irregular student; king-

bee-story teller of the class. A ﬁne bluffer in recita-
tions.

I20

ORRIE LESTER MARKS.

“A solemn youth, with sober phiz,
- Who eats his grub and minds his bizz.”

Our athletic representative. Partner in all graft.
Has been so unfortunate this year as to make the ac-
quaintance of typhoid and measles. But he won out
and we trust he will do so here and hereafter.

CALVIN CLIFFORD MARSHALL.

“They never taste who always drink;
They always talk who never think.”

Here is “Chesty,” the Bean Eater. Captain of
’Varsity Foot Ball Team, ’o7, and a water dog of some
repute—this has nothing to do with a “water-wagon.”
“Cal” is a big man, with a good big heart, and a big
right arm for snowballs and potatoes. Formerly served
as a life guard in the Atlantic, but has now decided to
try it on dry land. We know you will make good,
too; its such a “blessing" to hear you, “B. S.”

OMAR HUGO MEHL.

“But how he lives, or where or when,
It matters not to other men.”

“Fanny” really comes from Kansas, but is afraid
to blow about it. One of the “best ever” i11 our foot
ball team. A very good worker and one of our lead-
ers. We hate to see him leave, but the “Call of the
Wild” (West) is too much for “Fan.”

I21

VINCENT JOHN MULVEHILL.

“Long and lanky, tall and slim,

Fun by the bushel stored within.”
Our Ex-President. A quiet drone, until he is
stirred up. Then look out or you will be stung.
".\lulvey” has a long way to go, but he will get there.

 

ARTHUR THOMAS MURRAY.
“At last I dwell in solitude alone.”

Came to us from O. M. U. for his fourth year.
Doesn’t make friends readily, but is always a ready
friend. He is quiet, and he comes clean.

 

ARTHUR CLIFTON McKINLEY.
“O, bicarbonate of soda! What profanity!”

One of the Presidents of the class when we were
Freshmen, but hasn't had the nerve to enter politics
since. He thought VVest Penn was a theological semi-
nary when he ﬁrst came here. If “Mac” is late to
school, you know that the postman has failed to bring
him his daily missive from the heart. A good fellow,
although he said “darn” once.

 

I22

JOHN NARKIEWICZ.
“A bold, bad man.”

Entered West Penn for his fourth year. Attend-
ed Michigan College of Medicine and Surgery, and the
Temple College, of Philadelphia, Pa. “Nark"' will
make his mark, if he has to fall in the mud to do it.
Pass the “snuff,” “Nark.”

MALCOLM HAY PHILLIPS.
“He came, he saw, he conquered.”
Used to come to school at ten o’clock, but can’t
possibly make it now till about eleven. He uses a big

pencil, therefore, he ought to make his mark also. We
wish you the best of luck, Malcolm. '

MRS. LYDE HARDIN PLUMMER.

“The chief of a thousand for grace
Her step is music, her voice is song.”

Here is a valuable picture of a genuine good “fel-
low.” Mrs. Plummer has a true friend in every one
of the boys, even Narkiewicz. Attended VVon1an’s
Medical, of Philadelphia, for three years; came with
us to ﬁnish, and likes our school and class. V.Ve all
feel better in that she has been one of us.

 

123

  

WUNIBALD JOHN PROBST.
“My! what an awful doctor bill.”

“Bill,” or “VVinnie,” is a good fellow from A to
Z; has had lots of practical experience. Don’t forget
to report the babies, “Bill.” Belongs to Volunteer Fire
Department of the amphitheater. Was never known
to throw anything. A perfect saint (?).

DONALD JOHN RAFFERTY.

“O, wad some power the giftie gie us
To see oursels as ithers see us.”

Here is the chief council to the Dean. Assistant
to X. 0. Werder at K. C. Chief janitor at Dispensary,
and Dr. Miller’s “candy kid.” Interne at Reineman
Hospital. “Bring in a pan, ‘Raff,’ quick! or else hold
out your hand.” He looks good (dressed), and may
make a good doctor if he doesn’t advertise.

BYAN LOWE RAMSEY.
“A fatted calf.”

“Babe” is a nice child, so awfully cute, and doing
well, too, since he has changed to Reick’s milk. Tips
the scales at 275 pounds (live). Every hand he plays
holds a "king.” Has devloped into a real student, and
no doubt at all he will “set up” soon.

:24

FRANK SAYLOR ROSSITER.
“Speak gently, ’tis a little thing.”

Here we present the “King of the Runts,” But
outside of that he is a good, pure boy. Has been called
a “South Side grafter.” VVhen he isn’t at school, he
generally bribes some poor, weak, unsuspecting Fresh-
ma11 to cover his number. Now we must say again
that Frank’s an A-1 fellow.

ALBERT THEODORE SCHMIDT.

“Small, but well inﬂated,
Fat, ragged, and saucy.”

“Down with the Dutch!” VVell,' now, this is a
pretty hard thing to do to “Jud,” for he is hard to
down, as a student, a true sport, or a bluffer. “Jud”
is a model youth—when he’s asleep. Member of Foot
Ball Squad of great and lasting fame. He expects to
be an assistant to Dr. Ingram some day.

MILTON SYLVESTER SELL,
“Let another praise thee and not thine own mouth.”

“Doubting Sell” won’t believe it unless he ca11
thrust in his hand. Looks to be much better fed this
year. The (leaf may hear, the blind may see, when he
gets out to practice. Interne at Reineman Hospital and
assistant in Diseases of Eye and Ear.

125

EBERT TAYLOR SIMPSON.

“As he knew not what to say, he swore.”

President during the war of "06. Has a grand
head of curly hair and a curly temper too, neither of
which show‘ in the picture. “Sim” spends most of his
time at the sink in K. C. and the rest of the time he
serves on the ﬁre brigade. “Sim’s” a dandy fellow
and certainly a student. He will blaze his way all
right.

AUGUSTUS IRA SLAGLE.

“ ’Twixt optimist and pessimist
The dilference is droll;

The optimist the doughnut sees‘,
The pessimist the hole.’’

The boys call him “Peep—hole Gus.” He is quite a
student of anatomy and is always looking out for a
foramen. VVe hope you ﬁnd it, Gussie. O, for a head-
mirror! “Gus” has the goods and knows how to de-
liver them, too. VVe don’t think him choicy enough of
his associates.

LA MONIER SMITH.

“‘Mora1 law dominates man, whether he respects or
deﬁes it.”

Smith is our model young man: he neither chews,
smokes, or drinks. A full sister of “Squeaky” Stew-
art. A ﬁr1e—looking giant; he ought to make good.

126

xi

ARTHUR B. SPIEGLEGLASS.
“There was a laughing devil in his sneer.”
“Spiegle” just dropped in from Philadelphia and
has made a great mark among the boys for paper and
snow of all sizes.

WILLIAM JOHN STEWART.
“Unthinking, idle, wild and young."
A follower of Osler. \Ve thought we would lose
him last year, as his “team” got away from him (in
the Big Room), and he escaped with a “c1‘acked—pot”

voice.

JOHN MURDOCK STEWART.
“What strange things will blow in.”
Chief rooter for season of ’o7. A good scout
every way. He takes things as they come, and many
things come his way. C0ul(ln’t make him mad with a

syringe full of rabies. Hope you win out in ﬁne style,
“Red.”

127

KARL JOHANN SWENSON.

“I would this world were over; I am tired.”

Everybody take a look at our honored quarter-
back of the ’o7 squad, for this is “Kacie,” the “Ter-
rible Swede.” Karl will reach the goal all O. K.
Quite a kicker, too.

BYRON PORTER WALKER.
“His mien was lofty/; his demeanor, grand.”

“Soap” has been called a gentleman——you clon’t
know him. Class information bureau on “shows,” a
regular critic of art, and a close friend of Harry Davis
and “]in1"’ Barr. “Soap” will make a good doctor, for
he is well up in the profession (six feet two).

LEWIS ALFRED WHITAKER.

“College bred, is not a four years’ loaf.”

Here is “Laughing Liz.” He is a ﬁne auburn
topped youth. VVe anticipate his becoming an otolo-
gist, as he carried an ear syringe around with him all
fall. A nice fellow and a good student. It won’t be
long until “Red” will be going to market for the fam-
ily supplies.

128

WILLIAM THOMAS WOOD.
“Though vanquished, he could argue still.”

“And last of all came \\"ood.” His name has been
at the tail end of the class for four years but in roll
call only, for as a student “Bill" is a top—notche1'. He
sees deep into things—but he wears glasses. He still
carries weapons for the man who shot that egg. Let
the egg drop, “Bill,” 'twas only a message from the
dead.

CLASS HISTORY.

Looking back tonight over the last three years that/have come and gone, it
seems but a very short time since I belonged to the army of Freshmen; and we, as
a class, labored and fought, gradually disentangling ourselves from that net from
whicli every college or university man must emerge before he has attained that
height from which he can look back over the year an(l feel (as we today feel)
proud of the cuts, knocks, and threats which he received during his infancy as
a student.

Our class made much the same appearance as any other class—al1 shapes,
sizes, ages, and co1ors—when assembled in the class—room. On the opening day,
we numbered, approximately, one hundred and thirty-ﬁve men and women, the
majority coming from good old Pennsylvania or her neighboring states, and a few
from the Golden VV est.

Our Co—eds (a fair quartet they were) were true representatives of their sex,
strong, healthy looking maidens, tactful, talented and debonnaire, with plenty of
grit and a sufficient quantity of nerve. One was married, who, no doubt, when
she saw man's pitiable condition an(l his vain attempts at providing for a family,
came to the conclusion that he needed assistance, and forthwith grasped the golden
opportunity to aid suffering mankind.

Nothing of extraordinary importance occurred during our Freshman year
(must tell no tales out of school). Charles H. Smith was chosen President and
serxed the class‘ faithfully and well. After getting better acquainted, we prepared
to do damage to the Sophs, providing they attempted in any way to molest our
moments of quietude and study (which they did later on) ; and we proved beyond
the shadow of a doubt that, although Freshmen looked green and sickly, they
possessed a sufﬁcient quantity of those qualities which make a man.

As a class, we worked hard and faithfully, forgetting that too much work and
too much energy kill a man just as effectively as some of the remedies applied by
the amateur physican, and many times our faces plainly showed that discourage-
men1 in no limited portion was our lot. How often we felt that everything was
going in one ear and out the other, leaving not the slightest trace of its presence!
I fear we should have given up in despair and hit the ties for home before the end
of the term had it not been for the kindness of Dr. Ingram, who, wandering for a
brief time from the subject, told us “It is not the intention of the faculty or

134

professors (especially is it true of myself) to keep anyone from entering the
Soph. C'lass;~we don't want to pluck anyone”: but he ended by saying, “You
must produce the goods; you have seen ﬂowers drooping with the heat of the sun
and how, after a cool, refreshing shower, they opened their eyes and smiled.”
(The lesson applied to us and we did likewise.) VVe left for our homes after the
ﬁnal exams, feeling rather uncertain, but conﬁdent that we had labored to the best
of our ability.

On returning to school the following fall, I was delighted to greet the
majority of my classmates again. Some had left for other schools; some few had
given up the work, and a very few had gone, stating no reason (which was
probably due to forgetfulness). As Sophs., we selected Mr. Bliss as our President.
He followed the footsteps of his predecessor and proved a worthy successor. The
Sophomore year at any medical school is conﬁned principally to hard work, and, as
no one likes to be reminded of anything that sounds like work, I shall obligingly
omit. 1 will, however, mention a little incident which happened in the Anatomical
Laboratory. It seems some Freshman or men stole fourheads from the Labora-
tory. Although every effort was made by Dr. Lange and our class, we failed to
locate the culprits, and, rather than have the Freshman pay for the loss them:
selves, we stood our equal share, remembering that we were Freshmen last year.
“If you see your brother in need. give him a helping hand,” said “Bob” Russell.

Having passed another summer, today we are Juniors and proud of our class.
Although we have but ﬁfty-eight men, we are quite certain of that number grad-
uating next spring. Charles K. Shanor is our President, and he is very active in
trying to make us conduct ourselves properly, which is sometimes entirely out of
the question. We assisted diligently in the Junior Prom., which was held the
latter part of February, and was a grand success. VVe are always ready to do our
part on the athletic ﬁeld and have proved our ability in baseball, basketball, etc.

Our class was called upon to mourn during the last year by the death of
“Sam” Morrow. \V e greatly appreciated “Sam” and regret very much his sad and
untimely demise.

For the publication of the Owl we have a good representative and trust the
Medical Department will not be lacking in interest or substance.

In closing, I cannot say anything more appropriate than to wish the boys and
girls a successful year, and that when another year has rolled by all will graduate,
pass the State Board, and become successful practicians of medicine, true to the
profession, true to their Alma Mater, and ever true to their class of 1909. May
you. as you climb the ladder of success and attain your highest ideal, never meet
any of your classmates coming down, but ever greet them on the highest rung 011
which it is possible to stand, remembering that “The heights of great men reached
and kept,” etc.

H. E. HELLING, ’o9.

31111111 Alfrph Eraahear, ﬁizﬂ, ifﬁﬁiﬂ.

To most of those into whose hands this publication will come, a baldly sta--
tistical sketch of the life of Dr. John Alfred Brashear will be as remote from
the living man of our acquaintance as is the juiceless specimen in a herbarium
from the ﬂower of the ﬁeld. It has been our good fortune to enjoy his faithful,
interested service as a trustee for many years; as acting Chancellor for a shorter
period he was an every—day companion; and on many an occasion his magnetic
personality, as he has talked to the student body of the wonders and beauties of
the heavens, has charmed in a manner never to be forgotten. Our best knowledge
of the man is embalmed in our memories of him.

A neighboring county gave him to Pittsburg; he was born in Brownsville,
in 1840. Here he had most of his formal education in the public schools of the
town. To his own ambitious efforts and steady persistence must be credited the
acquisition of those great stores of knowledge in his particular ﬁeld and in gen-
eral that are now his. He was a grocer’s clerk for some time and a thoroughly
good one, according to the testimony of his employer given to the writer some
years ago.

The boys on the “hill” will not forget his genuine affection for the com-
panion of his life, who, through all changing fortunes, has for loyal helpfulness
received a royal devotion. They were married in 1862 in Pittsburg.

His adopted trade, that of a machinist, could not command his entire
allegiance. The dusky shop might claim his days, but the nights were his in
which to live among the stars; as he lived with them he aspired to know them
as well as they could be known, and sought with the labor of his own hands to
provide the necessary instruments, putting into them the honesty of workmanship
which both his skill as a mechanician and the love of truth in his heart compelled
him to put into his work, thus from the simple satisfaction of his own needs, he

L. HOWARD SEATON.

Related, so he says, to the author. Has that look of sympathy for animals in

storm—center.

Freshman Class—Medical Department

grew little by little into the position he_now so rightfully holds as a manufacturer
of astronomical instruments, second to none.

Honors have ﬂown in upon him steadily in recognition of his knowledge
and skill. This University has honored itself in bestowing upon him the Degree
of Doctor of Science and at \7\7ashington and Jefferson as well as at VVooster he
has been made Doctor of Laws. The number of astronomical societies of which
he is a member both at home and abroad is too large to be quoted in full in a
brief sketch, but the naming of them would disclose their eminent distinction.
At home he has been frequently called upon for conspicuous service in the as--
sociations of which he is a member and elsewhere. He has been president of the
Eiigiiieers’ Society of V\/estern Pennsylvania and of the Academy of Science and
Arts, Pittsburg; acting director of the Allegheny Observatory and, as previously
mentioned, acting Chancellor of this University.

As was said of Sir Christopher VV1‘enn:
“si monumentum requiris, circumspice.”

Crowning the hill, at the highest point in Riverview Park, rises the mag-
niﬁcent new Observatory, visible from almost any direction for miles around.
To it he gave long years of thoughtful planning and anticipation. When at
length its cornerstone was laid, he untiringly sought friends and necessary
financial support until to—day it stands in measureable fulﬁllment of his aspira-
tions, starting out upon that career of further conquest of the heavens which
shall honorably perpetuate the name and fame begun for the old Observatory
by Langley and Keeler. And at some day-——may it be far distant—there ought
to be inscribed among the names of the illustrious astronomers dead, which may
now be read upon its walls, another; and that name is Brashear.

ROBERT AYRES.

“Bobbie,” as he is familiarly known, comes from
Mt. V\'ashington and’ is a bosom friend of Hoffman.
Is quite strong among the ladies, and this, far from
being a detriment to his reputation, insures for him a
bright future. Is quite noisy in class, but will settle
down as he becomes older.

JOHN QUINCY BANBURY.

“Little Ban” comes from Kansas. He is one of
\\'up’s greatest football players, and one of the fastest
men on the gridiron. He is prominent in all athletics
and was elected Captain of Football Team for ’08.
He is quiet, studious, and determined in his ways.
“Dan” is also Captain of Track and Field Athletics
for "08.

DAVID RICHARD BIDDLE.

“Loved by all, hated by none,” “Dave” always
has a smile for every one he meets. This trait will
insure for him that success which he well deserves.
“Stump” is quite a buck and wing dancer, although
a little stiff in the off wheel.

 

WALTER FURMAN CANNON.

Hails from the County called “Greene:” is better
known as “Big Gun.” He is Carp’s right hand man.
His ability as a dentist is second to none save that of
Abdulcassius, althougli practising in more modern
times. Always industrious and married.

JAMES HARRISON CARPENTER.

Is aboriginal to the metropolis of Lawrence
County, viz.—New Castle. ls suffering from bald-
ness caused by overwork (?). Is very quiet, has lit-
tle to say (when asleep). He is married, but no one
would ever suspect that he would study dentistry.

 

153

HARRY JULIUS ERICKSON.

Joined our class this year, after an absence of
two years. He waited until the class caught up with
him. Attends school irregularly; also has quite a tal-
ent for music.

 

JAY MILLARD FRYE.
“Pepper,” who hails from Carnegie, is quite a
friend of Hans Wagner. He is ﬁrst assistant to Dr.
Haslett in extracting a plug. VVas a member of the

Football Squad ’05—‘o6—’o7, and when started was hard
to stop.

MAURICE GOODMAN.

Joined us last year, having taken his ﬁrst year
in the “Emerald Isle” (P). Wore a mustache, but
had it removed by his classmates. He is in class, but
not often. Sole agent for the rubber apron trust.

154

EDWARD SAMUEL HAWKINS.

“Anesthesia Edward” is McCurdy’s orderly and
performs operations remarkably well considering the
short time he has been in service. Has a wide repu-
tation as a “Dentist.” VVas a member of the ’06—’o7

Baseball Team. Hails from North Side and is strong
on debate.

HENRY WILLIAM HECKEL.

“Heck” comes from the "North Side.” Will take
the opposite in an argument on any subject. Is an
authority on drugs and the metric system. He is a
lightning operator, but has a close second in “Billy.”
Laying all jokes aside, “Heck” is a good, square
fellow.

FRANK HOMER HOFFMAN.

“Doggy” came to us from Jeannette. He is “Bob-
bie’s” main pillar of support. His ability as a tenor
is equal to that of Caruso. His chief difficulty is
reaching the floor with his feet when operating. Has

had many offers to join grand opera, but refuses to
leave his chosen profession.

155

 

 

ORVILLE MCCORMICK HOWARD.

:\rrived over the l}. & 0. from Smithﬁeld, Pa.. to
solve the problem of Dental Art. President of ’OS
class. A hard working student and one who is not
afraid to say what he thinks. Our hopes were about
blasted regarding‘ this young man, but since he is un-
der the care of King there need be no fear of the out-
come.

BERTRAM BRIGHT JOHNSTON.

“Dippy,” a native of Butler, who ranks high
among the tobacco ﬁends. is a lion among the ladies.
Uses oil of cloves as a restorative when any of his
patients faint. Has the degree of D.V.S. Wears a
smile which illuminates his countenance like the June
sun.

CLAUDE WILLIAM JONES.

Came from the town made famous by Piso
(\Varren). A fair—haired youth who works Little
(Bill) and talks less. He is a good-hearted soul for
a’ that. Takes well with the ladies on account of his
winning ways and winsome smile.

156

JOSEPH W. KAMINSKI.

“_loe" hails from the South Side—~or somewltere.
llis name is deceptive. He now has the degree of
PR. (Pill Roller); and this, added to D.D.S., will
make one mistake him for a count. He has an idio-
syncrasy for nitrous oxide. He is somewhat of :1
sport and his correspondence with the opposite sex is
unlimited.

GEORGE PORTER KENSLEY.

“Port” was recruited from Beaver Falls. His
ability as Department Editor for the Courant is be-
yond reproach. \Ve fear he has matrimonial inclina-
tions. May he therefore have success as a dentist, for
two meal tickets cost more than one. His favorite
song is “ ‘Beulah’ land.”

ALBERT EVERLY KING.

Better known as “Old Hickory.” His home is
Kughutown, Greene County. Holds the record as
heavyweight champion of “Frat House.” As an
operator he l1as few equals. Quite a lady’s man. He
is Howard’s roommate and always under his care.
Has little to say, but is a deep thinker.

157

 

.¢o...=:omAO .?u:wo=< 3oZ

 

FREDERICK KLAWUHN.

“Fritz” anchored his ship in W. U. P., having
come direct from Ridgway. Has a football record
that is hard to beat, having been a member of the
squad of ’o5—’o6—’o7. Quite a favorite with the gentler
set. He is quiet and studious and a favorite with all.
VVe hear he is contemplating matrimony.

RUDOLPH KLICKA.

The joy of himself and the pest of all. Came to
our ranks from Bohemia. He takes well in a large
crowd. Conspicuous for his nerve; but for all this
he is bound to win out in the end.

JAMES FRANK KYLE.

“Baldy” is from Belle Vernon, a small town up
the “Manon.” He received his early training in In-
diana S. N. S. Gets mad occasionally, but positively
refuses to ﬁght under any circumstances. He has
trouble in knowing how far to \vasl1 his face, as the
line of <lemarcation is not distinct. Takes well in
society.

I58

BERNARD WILLIAM LITTLE.

“Barney,” better known as “Big Little,” is a resi-
dent of Loretto. He is spiritual adviser and a very
present aid to Marcus in time of need. His hair is
turning gray, but he says it is from early piety. His
ability as a man, a dentist, and an actor is beyond
criticism.

WILLIAM ARTHUR LITTLE.

Known as “Little Little,” came to us from Cres-
son with the desire to become a Dentist. Was for-
merly a pedagogue. He is very positive in his man-
ners, but has a failing of telling jokes. VVe all hope
his dream will be realized.

CLARA ETH EL MARCUS.

She stands alone as Coed of ’OS. Clara is an en-
terprising girl. She is of a jovial disposition—some—
times. It is rumored that she and one of our class-
mates will be married soon. Here’s success to you.

159

 
 
 

 
 

BERNARD TANNEHILL MILLER.

“llarney” came to us from Normalville. He is a
good-hearted, whole—soule(l cl1ap. A general disturber
of the peace and quite a friend of the gentler sex,
having no fears of society. Authority on shows and
all kinds of sports. He is getting quite thin looking
after Kyle.

WILLIAM HARRY MINIUM.

“Pap” emanated from Meadville and talks con-
tinuously. Great at telling his exploits. Miller’s
roommate says it takes most of his time looking after
him. Specialist on Orthodontia, but aside from this is
a good fellow. '

RICHARD J. MORONEY.

He is not a “Volunteer ;” was drafted to our class.
He attends shows regularly, school sometimes. He
being a new member, we are unable to say much of
his ancient history.

160

NORMAN LEE MORROW.

He walked in from Rodi, Pa., to get acquainted
with dentistry. Graduate of V\/estminster, the place
of purity, where the ban is on the “frats.” He is a
good student with a big heart. Has little to say (?).
Almost always found entertaining the girls in the of»
ﬁces. Ask Howard.

THOMAS CHARLES McCL1 NTOCK.

“Mac” is from Dravosburg. He is quite a steady
fellow, having Hoffman and Ayers in his charge. \Vill
quarrel a little, but we don't think he will ﬁght. Wle
hear he does not believe in single blessedness.

GEORGE ANDREW MCCLELLAND.

“Little Mac” comes from Murraysville to engage
in the war upon caries. He has a “bad disposition”
and little ambition. Enjoys the hospitality of the
smoking room. Always starting trouble, but not a
bad fellow.

I6I

 
 
 

CLAUDE WILLIAM PUHL.

“\Vindy” sailed in from Allegheny. He is the
best operator in the class—in his estimation. He is an
expert at roller skating and push ball. “Is a killer
among the ladies,” but a pretty good fellow.

 

SAMUEL BERYL RALSTON.

“Sam,” the Avalon boy, was formerly a member
of the Football Squad, but the game was too strenuous
for him and he quit. A ﬁne looking fellow who says

he will not practise in “Africa.” Captain of Baseball
Team ’o8. '

 

MATTH EW LEVAINE REED.

“Hat” descended in a canoe from Coal Valley.
He is an author as well as a dentist. Quiet, reserved,
and a perfect gentleman in his manners. He has CL
warm place in his heart for the gentler sex.

 

I62

ARTHUR GARFIELD RINARD.

A native of Breezewood, Pa. Was married at
the beginning of this year and seems to be as happy as
a “sun—ﬂower.” A man of his own mind. Has never
been troubled with obesity. Thinks much and says
but little.

JOHN JOSEPH SEVERIN.

J. I. first saw the light of day in Carrolltown. He
is a man of himself, by himself, and to himself, at
tending strictly to his own business and seeming to
enjoy his own company. He is often termed the “One
‘Man Band.” If he has any faults we don’t know about
them, as he keeps them quiet (not a bad habit).

JOHN ANTHONY STERN.

The “Barber Dentist” from Allison Park got his
training at the chair. He is the king of good fellows,
liked by everybody. \Vears a smile that won't come
off. He holds the medal for long walks, since he walks
from Allison Park to school.

163

 
 
 

JAMES GLENN STURGEON.

“Big Fish” swims in from Oakdale every day. He
is a personal friend of Esculapius. He is of a good
disposition; never known to have been angry but once,
and “will stand for no foolishness.” After spending
three years in the city, he will now stand without
hitching.

JOHN CUMMING SULLIVAN.

“Coming,” but is not here yet. He attends school
spasmodically, is never in a hurry, will talk on any
subject, and has a poetic air that is hard to beat.
Smokes some, but chews more.

FRANK WILLIAM WALDRON.

“Pat,” the comedian from Butler, the soap min-
ing district. He works the lantern for Dr. Flint be-
cause of the experience which he gained last summer
while working in a nickelodeon. He enjoys working
at dentistry, but likes to dispense “hot air” better.

“Here,” formerly spelle(T“]t111g," is a general dis-
turber of the peace. Doesn't know the date and place
of his birth, but he stays 011 the South Side. He is

always guilty, but never caught. He demonstrates the
chair in the plaster room.

--A --
SENIOR’ Q

 

JOHN BAYHA VALENTINE.

Blew in from the county seat to learn the art of
mixing dope. We don't know his birthday; but if
appearance counts it is a safe bet that he was born
February 14th. Val is a good classmate.

ERLE HOMER MECKLEM.

The fellow with the real nice, soft and easy from
names, tumbled in from a “tumbler town" down the
river where they learn to make, ﬁll, and empty glasses
of all sizes. Meek is a dandy sort of fellow.

172

AUSTIN EARL DOUGLAS.

.\ young pillist from the seat of Lawrence
County. \\’as evidently named after a cigar made in
the capital of Texas. It takes a long time to start
Earl to talking; but when properly started he never
knows when to stop. A reasonable sort of Earl.

JAMES ELLSWORTH GROSS.

“Tall Jim” is as long as a Kentucky search war-
rant. Afraid to speak. Named after 12 dozen, but
is not so many. Gross is a good scout.

WILLIAM FRANK SCHOLZ.

A regular ladies’ man. Had an idea that most
all the girls would propose to him. but nay! nay‘. Now
he wears glasses to look for the girls. A nice fellow
and no room for improvements.

173

WILLIAM LATOU.

Got started at College and forgot that it was
school days; then he got a girl that liked his last
name; he stole her, they were married, and now there
is not enough of him to make a meal for a humming
bird. A good fellow an(l we all wish him well.

CHARLES EDWARD BIEDENBACH.

From the City of Nails and Tobies. The man
with an Irish name. Got tired of V\/est Virginia and
came here to get acquainted with civilization. The
chances are he will remain in Pennsylvania, for his
state  known as a great place for haw—eate1's and
snakes.

FRANK HERBERT MILLER.

Our heavyweight, as big as the biggest. So fat
that the chambermaid has to scatter ashes“ in the bed
to keep him from sliding out. Only weighs 284 in
his stocking feet. If he walks into a section of the
laboratory he has to back out——no room for him to
turn around. He is a dandy student.

174

JOHN DORSEY CRAMPTON.

A compatriot of Booker T. \Vashington. Draws
his breath in VVylie avenue, and is quite popular with
his classmates.

 

FRANCIS CARLTON CASE.

A “case” in general, and not a11 egg case. This
case has a case on a girl and has it so bad that he al«
most forgets school. It is supposed that after school

he will hook on to the young lady and make it two
cases.

 

JOSEPH CLEMENT MEADOWS.

Means ﬁelds after the hay is cut, or, in other
words, a jvastztrc for the cattle. He looks so differ-

ent since he got twenty—ﬁVe Cents worth cut off the
top.

 

175

 

CLARENCE ALFRED STITT.

As red as an Indian and wears an Elk pin. Has
a face as long as a mop handle and always looks as if
he was mad. Good brother.

WILLIAM JOHN SCHRECK.
A stout, strong, husky fellow and very tame.

THOMAS GADDESS.

Used to be agent for the “Derrick;” later he
learned to kill rattle—snakes and distill the oil, and
ﬁnally drifted into the drug business. He is a ﬁne
and dandy fellow, but has the ladies on the brain.

I76

JOHN LEE ALLEN.

By the name Lee you would suppose he was con
nected with a Chinese restaurant; but no, he keeps
books in a Chink Laundry.

FRANK MERVIS.

“Curly Merv.” Goes to school on his nerve. A1~
‘ways in an argument and never knows what he is
talking about.

LEO ADOLPH MOSES.

Spends lots of 1noney—with himself. He uses
rouge.

I77

 

              4
kt
LOUIS EDWARD PIPER.

Piper is ofﬁcial in the U. S. P. About as tall as
the average Cretan. Has green eyes.

 

THOMAS HARRISON THOMAS.

Sore at the profs, don't like the quiz masters, and
has it in for the Fraternity; in fact, he doesn’t like
himself. Makes more noise than an explosion, but
is not so attractive.

HARRY OLIVER NEWTON EVANS.

One of our classmates who has his own store. It
will take the front of a building to hold his full name
in print. “Alphabet Harry.”

 

I78

JOHN ALBERT FEICHT.

No, he is not a German. He lives on sauerkraut
and limberger. Needs something to fatten him up,
being as thin as two fellows. That’s all.

 

CHARLES HESS WERNER.

Mother's pride. “Fessie” or “Florence.” He is
the limit. Very innocent—yes, you don’t know him.
Take Peruna; Charles, and have your picture put in
the paper.

 

MARK C. HANN.

Not a senator, though he imitated the name of
our late senator from Ohio. Mark is a good scout.
Always in a good humor and greets everybody with
a smile. He is not a politician, but he has often voted.
\\"ould make a good orator; prefers the drug business,
however.

 

179

 

JOHN FRANKLIN TANNEHILL.

A man who kept a store

Once wrote upon his door,

“Oh, I can make a pill

That will cure every ill.

.I keep all kinds of plasters

Sure to cure all disasters,

Also several brands of ointment
Made to soothe the disappointment.”

\’Vhen customers applied

This model drnggist cried:

“Now, ‘Patience’ is the pill

That eases ev’ry ill;

And ‘Take Care’ is the plaster

VV hicl1 circumvents disaster;

VVhile ‘Good Humor’ is a11 ointment
Soothing every disappointment.”

He is the man that exposed us in the Courant.
but always forgot to sign his name. VVell, he could
be roasted. but the ink is worth more. How to you

like this, Tanny?

IRA A. BLACK.

W/as a chauffeur on a hay wagon out i11 the wilds
of Sorrow Hollow. He got tired chasing katy—dids
a11d grasshoppers and quit the farm to learn the art
of mixing horse and cattle powders for his neigh-
bors. He is not a member of the Black Hand, but is

a handy Black.

 

JESSE KILE SNAVELY.

So thin that he could dance a jig in a gun barrel.

He has to stand twice in the same place to make a
shadow.

180

ELMER ELLSWORTH SANDBACK.

Found back in the sand. Not a sand bath. A
Butlerite? Answer: No, a Reuben. Used to raise
potatoes in that well known county.

WALTER FREEMAN SCI-IEIBLER.

\\'alter never acts as a free man: something
seems to worry him. He hates to be away from his
ma. Stay with us, Scheib; you will not get lost.

CHARLES EDWIN PRICE.

Reduced to 65 cents. “8x8:88—take it along
for 65.” This price (loesn’t come high. Can be seen
at all bargain counters. Has red hair and belongs to
the onion family.

I81

CHARLES RUTH MURRAY.

Mamma’s boy, maybe girl: we can’t say, as Ruth
doesn’t sound good to us. Never spent Ioc for a
shave—nothing to shave. Said he was a man, but it
is doubted. Pretty? Yes, O yes! Mercy! Fudge!
Joy and Cold Cream!

 

LOU EDWARD GIBBS.

A coke oven operator. A pleasant fellow from
Mount Pleasant. So thin that he had to sit twice to
l1ave his picture taken.

LAWRENCE ALOYISUS HAECKLER.

Got his middle name from a literary society.
Uses most every letter in the alphabet to spell his
name,_and then he says that he is from Pittsburg. If
he were a duke the name would sound better.

 

182

WILLIAM WEBB HAYFORD.
Have heard of hay forks and hay sheds, but can't
account for the \Vebb. Says he knows a young man
named Cobb who married a girl named Webb and he

got struck on her as soon as he spider (spied her).
For further information see Bill.

CHARLES NEWTON MINTON.

Charles, we gather mint—on the hills and we
know of the Mint on Spring Garden St., Philadel-
phia, but you are a l\lint—on-us.

FRED REIF.
Slow Fred.

He gently knelt before the maid
And kissed her ﬁnger tips.

But he lost out—another man
Came by and kissed her lips.

I83

 
 
 

 

 

THOMAS ELVERN ALLEN.

The manufacturer of foot ease. To hear him
walk on the school ﬂoor you would think he needed
foot ease and rubber heels.

JOSEPH GEIR.

“\\'hat is the (lose of honey?” Always late. In~
(lulges profusely in tobacco. Joseph should keep
books for a shooting gallery and save both time and
expense. ‘

GROVER CLEVELAND GARBER.

The ﬁrst part of his name will never get him any-
thing. Such a nice fellow tohave a name like he has!
We know he was not named by a Republican. Have
your name changed and then see how you feel, Garb.

184

FLOYD B. WICK.
I7lo_\'cl is a Lizzie name. Mr. \Vick is a bright
light for a while and then gets turned down. Burns

with a smoky ﬂame. A good student who pays strict
attention to lectures.

 

CHARLES BURNETT KREY.

Charles is not a brunet, but a real. live man:
Pinch him and see—if he speaks. he is alive. Should
do well in his chosen work.

 

HARRY ANDREW FOWLER.

. One of our classmates from the Avenue of
\.\'ylie. Paid for a seat up front and is seldom heard
of. Always pays strict attention in class. His back
name was gotten from a bicycle.

 

PAUL EDWARD HOMAN.
A pool shark with a better future. The name

Paul should have Jones after it; but as it is he is well
liked.

RALPH COPPAGE KNISELY.

The candy kid. His ﬁrst name sounds good at
a fudge party, but not at school. If he was at the
head of the class we would call him Cabbage, since it
comes in a head. Be that as it may, Ralph is a nice
fellow.

SAUL SEEGMAN.

Saul drifted from the wringer “biz” to the drug
store and then had his name put on the W. U. P. reg-
ister. A good student of a very quiet disposition.

I86

PAUL THOMAS SQUITIERI.

Talk about Scoparia or Broom top! this 1nan"s
name is the limit. He could be arrested on suspicion
for owning that name. Brace up! you can't help it.
lf you were like your sister you could have it changed.

JACOB SPERLING BOWMAN.

Halts at every signal. A pretty boy—/ze thinks.
If he had air brake connections he would be a winner.

ALBERT L. BERG.

Hail to the king! Always to the front with a
new yell. And if we don't like it, well-

187

 
 
 

UNIVERSITY
OF PITTSBURGH

LIBRARIES

 

ALFRED JOHN FORST.

Looks like a katy-did on a pump handle. Can be
seen every Lab morning in the smoking room. He is

an albino.

LEO JOHN FAESSEL.

Formerly a bookkeeper for a scissors—grin(ler..

LEWIS ABRAM BANDY.

Belongs to the poultry family. Could give a lec-
ture in Microscopy and knows all about Poly-morpho
Neucelar Leucocytes. About as large as a banty
rooster. A good scout at that.

188

HOMER JOHN PAAR.

Lean, long, and lanky, with a swing like a bar‘
room door. He is a good—looking young man of at-
tractive appearance, although he has no medals that
we know of.

MARK BATE CARTW RIGHT.

A cart is right after a mule. He would be a good
fellow to go ﬁshing with: you would have bate handy.
Never owned a pocket knife and always wanted to
know the time.

ALFRED WILLIAM BRITTON.

The class president and a good one at that. He
blew in from a jerk—water town that has a P. 0., a
general store, an undertaker, and the drug shop in
which he got his start. You could buy a grind—stone
or a plowshare from him as well as a bottle of cough
syrup.

189

JOHN FRANCIS WESSEL.

This gentleman hails from the smoky city, but
his habitat should be “Seldom Seen.”

MAX JOHN WICARIUS.

“Big Max” looks like the Indian in front of the
cigar store. A few feathers, brother, then get on your
perch.

THOMAS LEO MORGAN.

Blew in from Snakeland. Used to cultivate to-
bacco. Came to Pittsburg to learn the art of com-
pounding. He is 21 wise owl.

 

190

ANDREW FREDERICK LANG.

Had an idea that he knew it all, but soon found
his knowledge was limited. A great ladies’ man—hc
thinks. W'ould make a good ticket agent at a side
show.

MILTON L. TIFFANY.
A ring setting, not a prize ring. “Tiff” is a great
scout. VVould look well operating a street piano or
barking at a carnival.

WILLIAM BERNA RD VOLLBRECHT.

“Gum-band Bill” is always shooting paper wads.
Has a good aim and always hits the spot. He should
be patching awnings instead of wasting his time in the
drug business.

191

 
 

HOWARD SYLVESTER BOSSART.

The real pretty young man with the black hair
and boyish face. When he was a child the people
came miles to see him. He is a good fellow, but is
rather stuck on himself. Sits in No. 19 so he can be
seen by all.

 

ROY HERBERT HUTZLER.

From the wilds of the Butler Cou11t_v seat. Used
to work as chief engineer on a plow. Belongs to the
bucl<wheat family.

 

JAMES CLOTHIER s1Ms.

“Thin Tim.” Not enough fat on him to grease
the hinges on a pair of spectacles. Jim is a quiet boy
who understands his business.

192

EDM_UND JOSEPH KENT.

A small, blacl<—hea(led athlete ; football, basket-
ball. baseball, and even marbles. A regular sport——
took lessons from that Bronze Indian in front of the

HE great event of the year whose record this issue of THE OWL is
intended to preserve is the acquisition of the new site for the Univer-
sity and the adoption of plans for the new buildings to be con-
structed thereon.

The University is now in the one hundred and twentieth year of

its history, and for the first time has come into possession of a tract
of ground large enough for its needs. The Academy building and later the College
building was situated on the south side of Third Street, between Smithﬁeld Street
and Cherry Alley, and was destroyed in the great ﬁre of 184.5. The second build-

ing was erected on Duquesne V\/lay and was likewise destroyed by ﬁre in 1840.

The third building, completed in 1855, was erected on a new site at the corner of

Ross an(l Diamond Streets. This building was sold to the county after the burn-

ing of the Court House in 1882, where it still remains as the home of the Pitts-

burg Academy and the Law Department of the University. None of these
locations was large enough for the erection of other buildings.

In 1819 the Legislature of Pennsylvania granted to the University a portion
of what is now the Allegheny Park system. Title to this grant could not be made
good, and the grant therefore failed. Had it not been for this doubtless the Uni-
versity would at this time be in possession of a large number of buildings and a
very much larger body of students than we now have. The location was ideal.

Forced to move in 1882 and possessing the grounds of the Allegheny Observ-
atory—about ten acres in extent—-—it was an easy solution of the problem to con~
struct buildings for the College and Engineering Departments upon this command-
ing site. N 0 one could then foresee the movement of population, but even had the
location proven the best, the acreage would not have been sufﬁciently large to
accommodate any considerable number of buildings. The subsequent addition
between 1892 and 1896 of the professional departments made it obvious that ulti-
mately a new location must be secured in some more eligible location, and large

GEORGE BINGHAM DISTLER.

The human spirit level; would be useful around
a new building. He could be used as a solvent for
resins, gums, and oils.

MAX HOECHSTETTER.

“Hocl<ey,‘" as he is called, has the appearance of a
skater (not saying what kind). Is a great business
man and should make good.

J01-IN BRATTON PARKS.

As attractive as Highland or Schenley. Hails
from a small town up the Allegheny river, has to pass
the work house and never stops off. If we were all
as good as John we could safely pass all those institu-
tions.

GEORGE OSCAR STECH, JR.

He is the author of these write-ups and that is
why he looks so solenn1——-expects to be mobed, you
see.

He is a good fellow though—for a bum relief
clerk.

PHILLIP SHERIDAN KEFOVER.

From the seat of Fayette County, where they ob-
serve the Sabbath day. You can’t get a drink of well
water in this old town and all the smoke you get on
Sunday is from the coke ovens. Phil is too nice a
fellow to tell the people he is from Uniontown.

 

FRANK ELTEN HULME.

Hank the Orator has a line of talk like Sis Hop-
kins. Draws salary in Turtle Creek. He reminds
you of a grasshopper with a broken wing. Always ll-.
a good humor and has a good word for everybody.
Every time he speaks it means something.

HARRY LEE WHITE.

Quiet? Yes, but when he gets out on the grid-
iron—O golly how the mud do ﬂy!

enough to accommodate all the departments of an institution which was now
becoming a University in fact, as it had long been in name. This matter was
discussed again and again, and the Chancellor and the Board of Trustees diligently
sought to ﬁnd theproper solution.

In 1904, when the present Chancellor was chosen, the call was accompanied
by the deﬁnite assurance that a new site would be purchased as soon as it could
possibly be done. From that time until action was ﬁnally taken on December 13,
1907, the Chancellor and Trustees, led by a Committee especially chosen for the
purpose, gave themselves unceasingly to the problem of a site which should be
suitable for the purpose. Quite a number of these were from time to time under
consideration between Oakland and Vl/ilkinsburg, and some of these had many
desirable features. The choice was not an easy one to make. Financial consider-
ations were a necessary element. The professional schools, as well as the College,
had to be considered. At the time when the choice was narrowing down to two
or three and a selection of one of these was to be made, a ﬁerce ﬁnancial panic
seized the nation and caused the trustees to hesitate and consider very seriously
whether or not the whole matter must go over to the future. The situation was,
however, urgent and the board ﬁnally, at a session which will forever remain
notable in the history of the University, decided to purchase thirty-one acres ot
the Schenley Farms with twelve acres adjoining, making forty—three acres in all.

This decision was reached on November 29th, and was concluded on
December 13th, 1907.

Without question the site chosen is one of the most commanding in all
America. The buildings, when completed, will form a splendid group looking
down upon the University Club, the new Soldiers’ Memorial Building, the
Schenley Hotel, the superb Carnegie Institute building, the Technical Schools,
the Phipps Conservatory, the splendid Sclienley Park, the Cathedral, and other
church buildings, and will thus form a part of the great institutional center, not
alone of Pittsburg, but of VVestern Pennsylvania. '

Immediately after the selection of the site the Executive Committee,
instructed by the board, undertook a competition of architects for the propei
development of the new site, and for the erection of the ﬁrst building. This com-
petition was brought to a happy conclusion on the I 3th of April by the selection
of the plan known as No. 40, which was found to be the work of Palmer 8:
Hornbostel, who have been so signally successful in a number of other competi-
tions. The style of architecture is Grecian. This ﬁrm not only adapted the style
of architecture and the grouping of the buildings to the peculiar topography of
the ground, but so located the groups of buildings as to take advantage of the
natural features and cause the institution, when it shall come into being, to seem
to grow up as a part of the surroundings instead of something put upon it. The
effect will be little short of magniﬁcent.

The development of this plan will require many years. In thus securing the

the ﬁrst time in the history of the University an opportunity is really given to the
people of Pittsburg to provide for the enlargement and growth of the institution
which has been in their midst for one hundred and twenty years. With the single
exception of Berkeley, the site for the new University is perhaps the most striking
and beautiful in all America. The construction of the ﬁrst building will begin in
June. The construction of other buildings will begin and continue as rapidly as
the means are put into the hands of the trustees for the purpose. Only one thing
can be predicted with certainty, and that is whetlier it takes ten years or ﬁfty
years the plan in its essential features will be carried out and Pittsburgh will have
a University worthy of her greatness. It is ﬁtting that Pittsburgh, whose name is
famed throughout the world, should have among her cherished possessions an
institution of learning which shall be worthy of the limitless resources of the
great region; and it is equally ﬁtting that Pittsburgh’s University should crown
with classic beauty one of the multitude of her little hills and thus bring together
into an indissoluble union beauty and utility, education and its application to
pmc-tical uses, science and its manifestation in hundreds of valuable forms, thus

typifying the character of the great community of which Pittsburgh is the
vital center.

FRANCIS CLIFFORD PHILLIPS, A.M., Ph.D.,

University of Pennsylvania, 1878. Chair of
Chemistry and Mineralogy.

“\Vooley,” the man who wore the path across the
campus. Dr. Phillips is our oldest professor in term
of service and is still one of the best. He is noted fol
his scholarly absorption and his gift of story telling.
He has two hobbies. chemistry and faculty dinners.
Knows his subject from “turret to foundation stone,"
and could give Dame Nature points on chemistry.
“Ump! ump! gentlemen, ump! ump! Very interest-
ing, very interesting, indeed!"

ALBERT ELLIS FROST, A.M., Sc.D.,
Dartmouth College, I872. Chair of Physics.

“\Vl1at is home without a Mot/201'?" You must
know him to get in and also to get out. Registrar to
the University at large and friend to every one in par-
ticular. Anthony Comstock of the Collegiate and
Engineering Departments, but very popular none the
less. You can't appreciate him fully until you have
been out of college several years; then he looms up
big. Runs a little “\Velfare Mission” of his own and
shields the Coeds with his motherly wing. A gentle--
man and scholar of the old school. Bless him!

REID THOMAS STEWART, Ph.M., C.E.,

Western University of Pennsylvania, 1884.
Chair of Mechanical Engineering. 
Inventor of the famous method of measuring
tubes. and yet a very modest man. I! Ego! Ich! ]’el
Knows all there is to be known about gas en-
gines, including the student’ variety, and is consult-
ing engineer to many large corporations. A stately
gentleman far removed from the mad throng of ordi-
nary mortals, but a great man when you get to know
him. V\7e can’t imagine the \Vup Engineering Depart
ment without Professor Stewart.

HENRY SAYRE SCRIBNER, A.M.,

Princeton University, 1881. Chair of Greek
Language and Literature.

“Scribbie” should have lived in the days of
Pericles or Homer; he would have been at home in
that atmosphere. A classical enthusiast who believes
that a student’s only aim in life should be to learn the
tongue of Hellas. He lends an air of stately dignity
to the pie foundry, where he eats. Only member of
the faculty who knows what goes on in the faculty
meetings———you see he is the secretary. Never known
to dismiss a class before the end of the period, but one
of the most obliging men on earth. He is a perfect
type of the old classical school. The OWL ought to
please him, for it is “very condensed a11d contains pic-
tures.”

COLBERT MOUSSEAU DES ISLETS, A.M., Ph.D.,

Princeton University, 1869. Chair of Latin and
French. '

“Daddy Dits” is the philosopher of the College
and holds the unofficial chair of General Knowledge.
\\’e have yet to ﬁnd the person who does not like Pro-
fessor Des Islets. One of the most popular men on
the faculty and an accomplished story teller. “Good
point that, per sc.” Patient and long suffering as Job.
His favorite occupations are telling stories and play-
ing the violin. Expects to go to Mars when he dies.
Faculty sponsor for the Y. M. C. A.

JOHN HAMMOND SMITH, E.E.,

Western University of Pennsylvania, 1898.
Assistant to the Chair of Mathematics and
Drawing.

No one ever heard him laugh, but his smile is
ever present. Known to students as “the square prof.”
That's just it, strict, but square. Inventor of all sorts
of things, but too modest to take out a patent even for
his new drawing table. Quiet, but enthusiastic. If
you don't believe this watch him at a football game.

EDMUND BURKE HUEY, A.B., Ph.D.,

Lafayette, 1895. Chair of Psychology and
Education.

The philosopher under the eaves. Doesn’t keep
abreast of his subject; prefers being ahead of it.
“Have you read my new book .3” Oh no, he didn’t say
that; he is too modest. The critics couldn’t ﬁnd any-
thing wrong with the book, and said so. Edmund B.
just looked shy and “smily-like.” Professor in the
Graduate School and a Greater University enthusiast.
It takes brains to know about brains; and “Hooey”
knows. The student who fails to take some branch
of “Hooeyology” misses some great things.

ALEXANDER WELLINGTON CRAWFORD,
A.M., Ph.D.,

University of Toronto, 1895. Chair of English.

His common or garden name is Shakespeare, and
he looks the part. Believes that the future of the race
depends on the morality of English Literature and the
efforts of Professor Corson, of Cornell. Advance
agent for Ben Greet a11d darling of the women’s
clubs. As Shakespeare said, “Have I told you about
Mrs. Crawford when we were in Europe?” In two
brief years he has revolutionized the English depart-
ment and greatly increased the number of courses in
that branch.

JOHN COLVIN FETTERMANN, Ph.M.,

Western University of Pennsylvania, 1896.
Chair of Biology and Zoology.

“Judge” or “Fett” is noted for his loyalty to \V.
U. P. and his milk tests. Gives an exam on a sub-
ject one day and lectures on it the next. Likes to go
on ﬁeld expeditions and uses even longer words than
does Davis. A popular fellow with colleagues and
students. A Greater University “boomer.”

FERDINAND BERGER, A.M._.
Chair of German Language and Literature.

Hoch der Herr Professor! Commander—in—chiei
of the “\Vhatever—you-callems,” otherwise known as
the choir. Lord high knocker on tl1e chapel piano and
oﬁicial guardian of the same. \Vell liked because he
is so polite and Beau Brummelich. His idea of a
patriotic song is “How Can I Bear to Leave Thee?”
For he is a jolly good fellow. Kaiser Wilhelm and
Grover Cleveland are his heroes. Hurrah, Hoch!

GEORGE ALEXANDER MCKALLIP DYESS,
A.M., Ph.D.,

Chair of History.

As Lord Acton says, “The ‘Pope’ he leads a jolly
life," and so say we all. A big man with a heart and
brain in proportion. “Now what happened in 1066.
and how did I characterize it ?” Iionder of dates than
an Arab. Female-Co1legc—pink-tea—speaker. Warning:
never cut a class in the Vatican. “There is not a Mrs.
Dyess” (as yet). Gives a test when he forgets his
note book. Can make you come to like history. He
is very much interested in the Greater University and
in all the students. Here's to the “Pope!” Long may
he reign! "

SAMUEL NEWTON TAYLOR, Ph.D.,

Wesleyan University, 1887. Chair of Elec-
trical Engineering.

Don't forget your note book. Taylor and his
note book—-Damon and Pythias. “Nevertl1eless, there-
fore, however, as I was going to say.” The man with
the long—tailed coat, the bewitching mustache, and a
pile of note books under his arm. He is exceedingly
nervous, especially when he ﬁnds his desk taking
wings to itself. Prof. Taylor believes in a good social
time for the students, and the Greater University is
one of his fondest hopes.

ALEXANDER SILVERMAN, Ph.B., A.B.,

Western University, 1902. Assistant to Chair
of Chemistry.

“Q\lecl<" is the manager of our foot ball team,
secretary of the Alumni Association. and a general all-
around son of tlie University. He is soon to be mar-
ried. Alas! poor Aleck. “As we (lid at Cornell."
Professor Silverman is very quiet. but he (loes the
work. \\'hat would the Athletic Association (lo with-
out Silverman?

IDEN FOSTER RICHARDSON,

Purdue University, 1905. Assistant to Chair
of Mechanical Engineering.

“Ric.h" is the hot air dispenser of the faculty this
year. Delights in telling stories and giving written
tests. Like Bankson, he is a ladies' man. Slow but
sure, A genial, goocl—nature(l fellow and popular with
the boys.

ELLIS EDWIN BANKSON, B.S.,
Assistant to Chair of Civil Engineering.

“I am not a literary man: I am an engineer.” A
mathematical prophet who has taken on Slifer‘s man-
tle and wears it well. Invites conﬁdence in every one
he meets. Like an lngersoll watch, he has an open
face—“so1newl1atly." He and Richardson are the
holy twins. A society man, “he can (lance and he
can sing.” Always in touch with the L'niversity, for
he lives near by. He stands well with the girls.

ALLAN DAVIS, A.B.,
Harvard, 1907. Assistant to Chair of English.

“He d7'a‘zc'c2‘/2 out the t/zrmd of his 'Z'(’7‘l)0Sff_\' ﬁner
tlzan the staple of his argztzI1c7zt."~—L0t'c'.v Labor Lost,
vsi. “Creampuff” is his title, which was earned by
hard gastronomic efforts. Angel of the Promt-book
(kind of angel not speciﬁed). Beloved of Coeds and
Senior English class? Instructor in the art of howl-
ing and usurper of Dr. Crawford's position as nasal
director. Harvard (caught in the accent) and a man
of the world, you know. Positively refuses to use
any word under seventeen syllables. Very social and
friendly; and his favorite terms are “dear heart” and
“perturbed spirit.” Davis is in love and we are all
sorry for him.

A. B. WALLGREN, M.D.,
Director of Physical Culture.

“Doc” is the man who has renovated the “Gym”
aifcl reformed the athletic system on the hill. Spends
most of his time in coaxing students to come out for
his numerous pet teams. A University boomer of the
ﬁrst water and always looking out for new students.
The only trouble with “Doc” is his modesty, but that
can’t be helped. He is popular with the students and
can get more work out of them than any man who has
ever held down his position.

HENRY RALPH RIES,
Superintendent of Shops.

.Ries' weak point is his fondness for the ladies.
ls greatly interested in the fair ones of the Stroudsv-
burg State Normal. Always ready to give sugges-
tions, and is never troubled by the fact that they are
seldom of any use. Thinks a borax solution will in
crease the power of an electric are. “I like to run a
motor boat, especially where there is water.” Likes
to Visit the library.

A small ‘contribution to the hilarity of

nations, planted, cultivated, and har-

are solemnly declared to be true and

faithful records of actual events. Read

Cﬂurnvh white in at Night
Rig 1112 (ﬁirl ﬁe Clan’: illnrgvt

I often wondered as I looked into his sad blue eyes and passed my ﬁngers
through his crinkled, whitened, golden hair, what terrible secret tale of suffering
lay locked in his bosom. And others also, as they admiringly watched him excel
on gridiron, baseball diamond, class room and banquet hall, often were heard to
exclaim:

“But why such hair ?”

Even McA(lams’ stereotyped and time—warped phrase “Lily-white” offered
no consoling balm to scores of troubled minds.

One dark and dreary morning he was sitting in the Amphitheater, bent for-
ward, (lespitefully using his chin by crushing it in a clamp formed by his two
hands, and wearing a look of far away romance in his eyes. V\/hen I chanced to
pass by, I saw him thus. Silently turning, I came back and slipped into the seat
beside him He took my hands in his, and, after caressing them a few moments,
turned abruptly toward me with oh! such a delicious mellow look on his face and
asked:

“We are alone?”

“Yes," said I.

He then began with a tear in his eye. “Some years ago my hair was dark
and beautiful as ‘Our Miss Sloan’s.’ Great waves of ebony locks beat proudly
on my royal neck. I was a cynosure for the eyes of every beautiful lass with a
heart to break.

“One evening I was late getting home. I had promised to meet her——the
dearest girl in the land—at eight o’clock sharp; it was then seven forty-ﬁve. I
succeeded in getting inside my ‘rags’ by seven f1fty—three. Nothing remained but
to anoint my beautiful raven locks with a little Ed. Pinaud’s ; so, grabbing one of
the two bottles which always adorned my dresser (the other being Hydrogen
Peroxide for my teeth), I doused a plentiful supply on my famous locks, think-
ing only of waiting Bess.”

“After a few deft manipulations of my military brush I grabbed my hat and
rushed to meet my darling girl.

“I rea.ched the house just as the clock struck eight. Familiarity permitted
me to enter without knocking. She was waiting in the parlor. I rushed to em-
brace her i.n one long love-clasp, when, uttering an awful ear splitting shriek, she
threw up both hands and screamed:

“ ‘Why, John Mackrell, what have you done?’

“Then she fell dead in a swoon. I turned to the mirror, and behold’! my
hair was like unto the ﬂeece on Mary’s beloved lamb. The truth flashedupon
me: I had put Peroxide on my hair instead of Ed. Pinaud’s Eau de Quinine. I
carried my fallen rose to the kitchen, placed her head beneath the spigot, turned
on the water, and left the house.

“Last night I met her for the ﬁrst time since. She has forgiven me and has
promised to be my wife when I have secured my M.D. But best of all was when
she whispered in my ear, ‘John, your crown of glorious sunshine excels in beauty
21 thousand times those murky strands of yore.’

“My friend, I have told you all; I am happy now.”

1-Javing landed in Pittsburg, straight from the farm, on a bright sunny after-
noon in October, 1906, I asked a “cop” to direct me to the Dental College. He
told me as much as he knew, being a little in doubt himself as to its exact location,
but started me out Forbes Street.

I wandered promiscuously between Forbes and Bluff Streets until I came to
Pride Street.

Here I met a bunch of fellows who looked about as much out of place as I
felt. Judging from their appearance that I must belong to the same class, I fol-
lowed them. VV e at last came to the Inﬁrmary door and I asked a fellow who
I later learned was “Dippy” Johnson if “this was the Dental College."

“You are Freshies,” said he; “go to the back door." And for the back dooi
we started.

As we passed a bunch of Juniors we heard “ Baldy" Kyle say:

“They look like a ock of ‘cucumbers.’ " lieing from the farm, we knew
what cucumbers looked like; and it then began to dawn upon us just how green
we really were. When we reached the entrance on Bluff Street we came upon
about forty more fellows of our own kind, and, alas! this was the “gang” des-
tined to compose the invincible class of 1909.

Not being willing to enter the Students’ room, which was ﬁlled with those
whom we supposed to be Juniors, but who later proved to be “harmless” Seniors,
we (lecided to look for the lecture room. “Pigeon” Erwin approached oui
janitor, Harry, and asked him to direct us to the lecture room. Harry, not hav-
ing very good hearing apparatus, must have misunderstood “Pigeon,” for he
sent us up to the fourth ﬂoor. After wending our way up several ﬂights of stairs,
we at last found ourselves in a dingy little room which, to our dismay, we soon
learned was the “soldering room,” and in which we spent many a weary hour
wielding the horn mallet. Here a good—hearted Senior rightly directed us to the
lecture room. Down again we went and lined up on either side of the hall.
watched the Juniors ﬁle in, and listening to such remarks as “Hello, Fresh!"
“\Vhen (lid you blow in P” etc. Then I really began to wish I was back in the
land of “Brer. Groundhog,” where the sun never ceases to shine.

Presently all had arrived at ’03 Hall, where we were to listen to the ﬁrst
lecture of the year from our esteemed Dean. VVe assumed a more conﬁdent air
and ventured in. Scarcely had we crossed the threshold when we heard the cry
of “Freshy up!” and soon a couple of our number were on their way up. Here
is where “VVild Bill” Donaldson and the irate Rumbaugh rebelled; and the rest,
following their example, turned in and we had quite an interesting combat.

Just as it began to look disastrous for the Juniors, the Dean made his ap
pearance and, of course, that ended all.

The Dean demanded silence and instructed us freshmen to occupy the higher
branches (I mean seats“). After a painful silence he began:

“Ah, fellows,”—Then came a lecture never to be forgotten——kindly advice
to those ﬁrst coming to a great city, precaution against sleeping four in a bed,
staying up later than ten o’clock, loaﬁng at Newell’s, quick-lunch counters, etc.
He also reminded us of the daily bath, even if it be only in a tin cup. That ﬁrst

313

lecture doubtless has saved many a student from ruin, and also the city the
trouble of hauling many of us to the free bath in the “hurry up” wagon.

Coming from this lecture we separated only to face a more serious problem.
Up to this time it had not occurred to me that it would be necessary for me to
secure a place to sleep. Now, suddenly realizing it, I started in search of a tem~~
porary abode. I walked several miles without meeting any successj at last.
however, I was fortunate enough to persuade a kind old lady to keep me, at
least, for a short time. Having settled myself comfortably in my new quarters
I sat down to write to the “old folks at home” and tell them of my ﬁrst day’s
experiences, as I had promised to do before leaving.

Thus began my career as a student at the Dental Department of the VVestern
University of Pennsylvania.

0 reader kind, be ye stern or fair,

\\"itl1 critics in justice, please forbear.

For I suffer not from “Poetitis”

Nor from the dread “Encepl1alitis.”

llut i11 this effort called a rhyme

I am not trying to kill time,

hit to commemorate the name

Of 1908, the Class that’s “game.”

It's tried and true and ﬁne as gold,

\\«’e"ve lived as one through four short years,
Joined in our joys and mixed our tears;
V\'e’ve shared alike our common lot,

Have reached our goal; but we shall not
Forget the ties of friendship true

Nor those dear colors, “Gold and Blue,"
And countless joys and blessings here
\\'ill always cling as mem’ries dear.

Now as we leave these scenes of strife
\\'ith Sciences of Death and Life,

To enter each his chosen ﬁeld,

VVe trust that then the soil will yield

To ALL a just and happy, recompense.

May this be the common FATE

Of every member of the LATE

And GREATEST CLASS OF 1908.

A FEW IMPORTANT ITEMS WHICH ARE
NOT IN THE OFFICIAL PUBLICATION

lﬂniherzitg Ahhaniagva

 

The city is the natural home of a university. Allegheny is a city——no, it is
only half a city—therefore an ideal location. The cars pass tl1e University
twice every twenty—four hours, one in the day and one in the night. The stu-
dents catch the night car. The day car is generally going to the barns. The
air is ﬁne. Come, jump in, and if you don't get covered with soot it is not the
atmospheres fault. J

The social advantages are many; every janitor gives an inaugural recep-
tion, very often we have four receptions, for we get that many janitors per
year.

Pittsburg offers unusual facilities for a university. In thus connection we
should not omit to mention another and quite different aspect of Pittsburg's
contribution to university students, namely, its music and art. At \Vest Newton
we have Baughman’s Orchestra, and Berger gives concerts each morning in
chapel between verses of the hymns. The Liberty Street Opera House and the
Gayety offer unusual advantages to the students for the study of the classical
drama.

Students can live here cheaper than at any other university in the country,
for the “Five and Ten" is just a few minutes’ ride from the school.

“T he student lives in an atmosphere which stimulates him constantly to the
highest attainments”—yes; for the faculty is at all times ready to give him a
boost—out.

We might mention a thousand and one other advantages—the Family
Theater, the clear rivers. the “Expo,” the Pie Foundry, the Smith Cabinet, the
spacious Courant room, the Coeds’ Dairy Lunch Room, the ]anitor’s office, and
the Seniors’ study room.

JOSEPH ALBERT BECK, B.S.,

University of Pennsylvania. Chair of Eco-
IIOITIICS.

“l)iagrammaticus” looks like Sherlock Holmes
and talks like George Ade. Makes possible the Con-
gressional Library and gives pink tea lectures on
Economics. Jovial and friendly, but given to discon-
certing frankness in the class room. Very popular,
just the same. We take it that it may well be that his
well worked phrases need a rest. Slumbers over exam
papers. \’Varns all Coeds, on first meeting, that he is
married.

SAM’L BLACK LINHART, AM., D.D.,
University of Wooster, 1895.,
Secretary of the University
and Professor of Biblical

Literature.

Dr. Linhart is a quiet gentleman
with a remarkable ability to get things
done. \\~'orks as if every one else has
quit and he alone is left to ﬁnish tl1e
task. He has a chronic case of
Greater University Fever and a dis-
position to pass the germs around.
Some people think him cold and dis—-
tant, but they are mistaken, for he is
one of the best natured and social
men living. He has a fund of dry
humor with just enough ironic lime
juice to give it ta11g and edge. He is
the inventor of the “Old King Brady”
hair cut. which bears his name (gar-
den variety); and also of the famous
“Nonrecitative Recitation,” in which
he does all the work and the the stu«
dent answers yes or no, according to
the inflection of the inquisitor’s voice.
Long live Sammie Black the Second‘.

FRANK THOMAS WYMAN, B.S.,
Assistant to Chair of Electrical Engineering.

Professor Vvyman, otherwise known as “Lariat
Bill,” is Taylor’s assistant. lie is very fond of danc-
ing, which no doubt accounts for his graceful (P)
walk and movements. Just take notice to the big
dimple in his chin. \Vyman would go several miles
out of his way to accommodate you. The boys all
like “Bill.”

ATHLETICS

Meet held Jan. 21st in Courant Room. Track, fair; weather, muddy.

lligh Dive for Lunches—Won by Reece.

Bill Baughman broke the international record for talking; he did a mile of l1ot
air in two seconds and a half.

As the track was in good condition the mile race was called off.

In the tug of war the Courant Board defeated the Electrical Club, and then
challenged the coeds.

Reece was excluded from the eating race because he was a professional. Con-
testants for this race were Walter Renton, Ralph Price, Edgar Knott, Miss Mar-
shall, Miss Schreiner, Roy VVillock, and George Baird. “Rink” Martin was given a
handicap of six lunches, but won out in spite of it. V

We take pleasure in recording the following recent discoveries and inventions of
our professors and students:

Non-Communicative Telephone System—D. R. Price, ’o8.

This system was devised by one of our students. Mr. D. R. Price, ’08. Its
principle is that of the well known “bunc transniitter_." now in use in all institu-
tions for the deaf and dumb. Mr. Price’s system has been installed at Wup, and
has received the commendation of Prof. Stewart and Miss Barber.

Note Book Safe—Professor Taylor.

Prof. S‘. N. Taylor has lately devised a safe for the preservation of his
voluminous notes, which already total about nine tons. It is 2o’x4o’x10’, and is
built of 2’ Harvey plates, lined with reinforced concrete. The safe is intended
to bear a maximum load of 23 tons. For technical data 011 this device see “En-
gineering VV0rld.” Page 13, Vol. xxxv.

Super-heated Steam App1iance—J. D. Harley, ’o8.

Mr. Harley has nst applied for a patent on his device for making super-
heated steam more cheaply. \Ne cannot give the details of this invention with-
out violating a conﬁdence. other than to say that the fuel used is radium.

New Methods of Iron Welding—Prof. Ries.

Prof. Ries has made the startling discovery that the action of the electric
arc in iron welding is greatly strengthened when the metal is immersed in a solu—
tion of borax. Mr. Ries has made a present of his discovery to the engineering
profession.

Tubca1cumeter—Prof. Stewart. .

This is a kind of mechanical brain to be used in calculating the strength of
seamless tubes. It has been fully examined by our Chancellor and pronounced
good. The device has been purchased by a large stocking manufacturer and will
be used to test hose.

BOOK REVIEVVS.

These books are recoininended to the pro-
fession at large, and may be obtained
through the '09 Owl.

A book all men should read—“My Experi-
ences with a Snake (‘harmer/."’ by J. E.
Shick, ’10.

Trials and Troubles of a Country Physi-
cian. written by Dr. (‘has. L. Bowman. is
the newest book offered to the profession.
Tells in detail how to treat anything without
medicine, a thing learned only by experience
such as that of our author.

Are looks deceiving? Conway. '05’, while
passing through the insane ward of one of
our local hospitals, was stopped by an in-
male and addressed thus:

“0. Mr. Andrew Carnegie. give me half
your money and I’ll have tl1e devil bound
hand and foot by to-morrow.” '

Consider, though, the poor fellow was in-
sane.

Local option is a topic of n1ucl1 discussion
lately. and the activity of our local option
friends has compelled Rankin. ’]O. Sharon’s
political leader, to openly declare it shall
never be as long as he can help it.

Dr. Snively (to Junior (,‘lass)—“And the
patient jumped overboard into the ocean.
and forever afterwards suffered from a ﬂoat-

The History of this Big
Store in a few Lines

It started in I849, as a trimming store.

It started in one room on Market street.

It was not very long until dry goods were
added, and then it was only a natural step to
introduce departments of ready~made cloth-
ing, and when that was done branches began
to form and spread out in all directions, until
today this store has pretty much everything
that the person requires, as well as the home.

Of course it was necessary to expand the
building and a few years back the present
large store was erected, which contains seven
acres of selling space, not enough now, by
long odds, so in the near future an addition
will be built which will give us selling space
of I2 acres.

Every little while we publish some pretty
good literature, besides our catalog which
comes out twice a year. We would like to
have your name and address so we can send
you some of the good stuff.

JULIUS ARNOLD KC)CH., Ph.D.,
Pharm.D., Dean
Pittsburg College of Pharmacy, 1884.
Professor of Physics and Inor-
ganic Chemistry.

Dr. Koch is a German by birth and
holds strongly to the good old principles
of education which he imbibed in the
Fatherland. Strong on discipline, but by
no means a martinet. Always ready to
go more than half way to help the boys
out, and a great man when you get to
know him. His unofﬁcial titles are “Old
Koch" and “Main Squeeze.”

THOMAS STEPHEN BROWN., A.M.,

Washington and Jefferson College, 1877.
Lecturer on Pharmaceutical Law and Juris-
prudence.

Attorney Brown is the man whose efforts are
given to the instruction of future druggists with a
View toward keeping them out of jail. Knows his
subject well and gets down to the point at once. Stu-
dents would do well to follow his advice.

 

FREDERICK THEODORE ASCHMAN., Ph.B.,
Pharm.D.,
Columbia, 1881.

Professor of Chemistry.

This scholarly-looking gentleman with the pro-
fessional set of whiskers is the person who injects In-

vocal accomplishments and his chemical lectures.

ADOLPH KOENIG., M.D., Pharm.D.,

Bellevue Hospital Medical College, 1879.

56

JAMES HARTLEY BEAL., Sc.D., Pharm.D.,
Scio College, 1880.

Professor of Applied Pharmacy.

“Jimmie” is one of the most popular men in the
department. \\''as absent part of last term on account
of ill health, and the fine carpet in the “Smoking—room”
was ruined by the tears of the students. Dr. Beal has
a wide range of knowledge, including Constitutional
Law, Pill Rolling, College Founding, Chemistry, and
Sciences too numerous to mention. Has the faculty
of calling you down in such a way as to make you
want to apply your boot to your own coat tails.

LOUIS SAALBACH., Ph.G.,

Professor of Pharmacy and Director of the
Pharmaceutical Laboratories.

This poetic looking young man with the ﬂuffy
coiffure is our Chief of Police and official guardian of
the labs. He could give Sherlock Holmes and M.
Dupin points in the sleuth _business. His method is to
analyze the noise in a lecture room and ﬁnd out its
creator by chemical reactions. In spite of all this “Old
.\[othballs” is a favorite with the students.

PETER GRANT WALTER, Pharm.G.,
Instructor in Pharmaceutical Latin.

This classical young man has the difﬁcult job of
adapting the tongue of the Caesars to the gentle art of
dope mixing, but performs it well. “Pete” is well
liked by the fellows because he doesn’t use “shotgun
methods" of teaching.

WILLIAM JAMES McADAMS., M.D., Pharm.D.,‘
Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy, W. U. P., 1896.

West Penn Medical College, W. U. P., 1901.
Professor of Microscopy and Pharmacognosy.

“Vac” is the jovial, fussy gentleman wl1o ex—
plains the difference between a one—sixtl1 objective and
a cover glass to his awe—inspired students. Would
rather examine bacteria than eat. Noted for his
liumorous stories and winning manners.

LEASURE KLEIN DARBAKER., Ph.G.,

Assistant Professor of Pharmacognosy and
Bacteriology.

VVl1at is this wise looking young man gazing at?
Oh, he has just discovered a new bacillas and is wait-
ing to see what it will do to a “Welsl1—rabbit.” “Darb”
is happy only when he has a few culture tubes and
water baths about him, and a nice new germ baking
on a slide. He is now working on a hair restorer, the
base of which is a serum made from the tails of
guinea pigs.

HERMAN STANISLAUS KOSSLER., Pharm.D.,
Instructor in Pharmaceutical Arithmetic.

“Old Koss” is past master in the art of dope cal—
culating, and his curliy pate is ﬁlled with a wonderful
store of knowledge which he insists on giving to his
students in large doses. Students like him, but some-
how rlelight in cutting his classes.

FREDERICK JOHN BLUMENSCHEIN., Pharm.D.,
Assistant Professor of Materia Medica.

“Bluiney” is the most talked of man of the
Pharmacy faculty and shines in every issue of the
Courant. Knows all about Materia Medica and wants
every one else to share his knowledge. Denies that
he is an Irishman.

THE COLLEE

CLASSICAL

PERCY EARLE BURTT.

Burtt is a jolly fellow, though he refuses to let
anyone else “jolly” him any further; but it makes a
lot of people feel big to call him “Percy.” His smile
could not be equaled even by the use of Rising Sun
Stove Polish; for this kind cometh only from success
\vith ladies and from a Methodist heart. His walk

beﬁts the head of the procession and his step rings .

true and heavy-like. But the sine qztibus 71011 of P. E.
B.’s existence are his cheerfulness and earnestness—-
an(l his valise. If things are dull or gloomy when he
is around, he isn’t there. Think your life is "not worth
living? Then let me introduce you to “llurtt, of ours."
\\’hen our class leaves these dear old bare halls, you
will see through \\'up"s smoked—glass windows that the
sun is in eclipse.

GEORGE SLATER COLEMAN.

He’s little, but he’s wise,
He’s a terror for his size,
And he doesn’t advertise.

Yes, that’s ricrht. A assin<r lance mi ht ive :1
a P a g g g

‘ false impression, because Strength (with a capital S)

is his predominant characteristic——mental Strength,
moral Strength, physical, Strength——any or all of them
will ﬁt the case. This man is the Jewel of the class.
The Owl ’08 would never have materialized without
his untiring devotion. The Literary Society would be
a non--entity at least, if not sunk into the depths of
oblivion [say, what will happen next year?]. Girls,
steer clear! \\'el1, yes, you had better. No; this
doesn't mean that he won't talk to you—but he al-
ways has this air: “Now I don"t mind this for once,

but I don’t intend to make a practice of this sort of’

thing.” And yet he said, “The girls here are pretty
nice.” No hopes, however, because he added, “The
R. P. girls are the best.”

62

SARA ELINOR DONALDSON.

She is tall and straight and looks sternly serene.
Some say the girl is “colc ;” others, “reserved,” and
others still (Stung, stungl), “disdainful.” The key to
her heart is this: Rashful, to begin with, she is further
bound by scrupulous sincerity. On impulse, seeking
friendship, she comes half way only to beat pre-
cipitous retreat, as who should say, “1 should be
charmed indeed; but (hastily) don’t think that I am.”
\Vhen you do not toe the line which her ideals mark,
she looks such withering, uncompromising scorn that
some would say such scorning is her forte and compli-

AMBLER FITZSIMONS.

\\"ith a serious book and preoccupied look she
sits in some quiet sequestered nook, a small cozy cor-—
ner, good “setting” for Ambler FitzSimons. This
Miss (who always makes a hit) is the shadow of the
class, always (not the class) in the background—till
needed. Her strongest epithet is, “you wretch!” and
she doesn’t half mean that. Everybody is sure that
when she leaves this University she will ﬁnd a11d ﬁt
herself into another corner, small and cozy like the
girl. P. S.——Someti1nes she gets awfully gay and
reckless, positively wicked—and superlatively red.

HARRIET ELIZABETH KELLY.

Known to have been compared to a dandelion, but
more like the daisy (day's eye). Always unassum-
ing, always sunny, energetic, steady, decided, but un-
prejudiced (Irony). Of a literary turn of mind. A
good friend. There are some, like Harriet, so abso—
lutely truthful and withal so perspicacious as often
to be thought cynical and sarcastic. P. S. “A froth
of \vit and a well of sense.”

ANNA VIOLA MARSHALL.

Coeducated to beat the band! Say it Frenehy
manner with the emphasis everywhere and all very
intense, co-o (long and soft, not quite “coo,” though
near it) educated (to a dazzling height). She has
red hair and, 0'! looks like the bright side of life;
smiles and giggles and laughs, gets convulsed, just
shriel«:s with delight sometimes. Mademoiselle always
pleases the boys, always, just like a box of candy—she
tafﬁes ’em. In short, she is nice, very nice, nice as—--
as a boy, but still a girl, somehow; but words fail, you
must see and hear a boy describing her. She is a star
at working calculus——and engineers. \’Vhieh reminds
me, I almost forgot (everybody does), she is smart.
Yes, and girls like her. P. S. ller tongue is healthy
for it has been seen (and heard).

words, she has a bright, happy appearance in general
and, in particular, golden hair, a pervasive smile, in-
digo blue dresses, and four dimples, one in each cheek
and one in each elbow, always in evidence a11d quite
fetching. For still further particulars see any one of
several youngsters who are following the injunction,
“W'l1atsoever things are lovely, etc., think on these
things." P. S.—-She delights in giving “digs”—the

honey bee stings.

 

MRS. HARRISON HORTON FISHER.

\’Vooed and married and a’ before she came near
us, and the reason is plain; no, it is very pretty. She
“cuts," comes at the wrong end of the hours, recites
intermittently, and yet the professors smile: she smiles
ﬁrst. “Pretty” expresses that which is pleasing to a
reﬁned taste in objects comparatively small, slight, and
dainty. According to our tastes, Mrs. Fisher is
“pretty,” too pretty for everyday life, but just out of
perversity she has proved herself a manager of any-
thing from parliamentary practice and professors to
getting married or playing mother confessor to the
lovelorn maids. Many a one has sighed for a single
one of (with) these faculties. P. S.—A delightful
bluffer; has been “called” just once.

SIDNEY ISAAC KORNHAUSER.

Sidney, where art thou? The frogs are croak-
ing, the Freshmen are in straits, the developing bac-
teria feel chilled, and the test tubes waste their sweet-
ness all unsmelled. \Vhere is the student assistant
of bug~land? “Si" loves learning (our librarian says
he is “the most scholarly man among us,”_) and this
year about (unlucky number!) thirteen joys—forever
entered this institution of learning and began to
teach; “Si" loved to learn and then “Sigh” learned to
enjoy lunch hour without his lunch. No, he isn't
daffy, yet: but he supplies the Coed room with any-
thing from Thoreau's “Essay on li‘riendship" to
Elbert ltlubbards “l’l1ilistine.” "l’resi(le11tial timber"
for all sorts of societies (3. walking club is the latest
of this “hobby,” Rough Rider), prize orations, and
scholarships to Cold Harbor! 0, say, can you see
what next? For this “youngest” to the old folks at
home, this “scientist” to all the professors in class,
this “general favorite,” his classmates have one word,
“Go it, ‘Si,’ you’re a big humbug (humming bird).”
But man, man! do eat your dinner!

ALBERT ADOLPH MULHEIM.

This is a ladies’ man, but we have yet to hear
that he is a lady’s man. His only real delight (l) 15
in social settlement work, interviews with weeping
widows a specialty. He visited Dutchtown once in
white corduroys and Dutchtown rose to the occasion.
I\lulheim sees the happy side of life: he lives near
ljeaver College (Female Seminary); enjoys seminar
work. He has the courage to ﬁx up and come to \V.
L'. P. at the same time. The sight of his smile doeth
good like Peruna (so he really is ﬁtted to be a physi-
cian, as he intends); for that gleam reigns over all
from sideburn to sideburn while Albert Adolph rolls
another “smoke.”

ANNA MARY RENTSCH.

Dear me! She only asks that this won’t be too
hard on her: she means, “Don’t tease,” for she must
know that nobody has a hard thing to say about her,
except one or two (you should hear Prof. Berger
make her blush!); but we were not referring to the
professors. No one has yet succeeded in analyzing
how she is nice, but she might (could, would (?)
should) tell us the customary ways of expressing (in
language) how nice she is. These sympathetic girls
are easily hurt and pleased. The mischief loves to
tease, but blushes at the ﬁrst return. P. S.—Now she
is sitting on the stairs—’tis chitchat; some time——-
“School Days.”

CHEMICAL

HOWARD ALEXANDER KOCH.

Koch is making a specialty of the study of the
effects of light clothes and a red necktie upon the
Coeds. He was seen inside chapel once, and from in--
side another time. Higher education in this case has
resulted in a certain insight into the mysteries of “af-
ﬁnity” and a passing acquaintance with “Hunters
Ethics.” Any day you may see him in the chemical
laboratory shaking up something in a bottle.

WILLIAM SCOTT MCGINNESS.

No, Fresh! that gay chap in chapel was not a
visitor; that was McGinness, one of “Wooly Horse's
colts,” He hasn’t smiled in upon the library very
often, either, since the advent of the “new regime."
\’Ve may hope that some (lay “Heinie” will publish
“Pops and Fizzes in a Chemical Lab ;” up to date,
however, his jokes have appeared only in the Courant.
Hiscoming is always hailed with audible smiles,
references to his a-la—King Brady haircut, and some

' words from the ladies. ’

CLASSICAL

ROBERT BROWN CARNAHAN.

“Pendulum"' is a lad whose hair forgot to grow in close proximity in the
front. giving him a very wise and digniﬁed air. I-lis chief object in life is to love
and be loved. It is claimed by those who have 1nade a special study of his case.
that he has “her" on the brain 999/ of the time consumed in sleep, the other 1%
being taken up with the “other one." Is so careful of his health that he refuses
to break it down with study. Fond of telling stale jokes, but a good man to have
a stand i11 with, as he usually carries a season's “comp.” to the Nixon or some
other gallery of art.

JULIU S SPATZ.

Probably the most scholarly looking fellow in the class, and one of the most
sedate and well behaved ones, at that. VVas never known to allow his footsteps
to deviate from the narrow path. So far, turns a deaf ear to the silent pleadings
of our beautiful co—eds, but is sure to come around in time. Others have gone
before; why shouldn’t he follow?

LATIN SCIENTIFIC

CHARLES HENRY BODE.

Thank goodness! we have one of them left, anyway. He and his famous
brother gave the lireshman class a pair of Siamese twins, but “My brother"
decided to take up a profession where he would be better able to reduce the
population of the city, so he went to the Medical Department. Not being so
bl0od—thirsty, “Charlie” remained, so there you are. A blushing, bashful, innocent
little fellow, whom you can’t help but like. Has a perpetual smile, which was
frozen on in early childhood by means of liquid air.

Sophomore Class-Collegiate and Engineering Departments

SAMUEL HARDEN CHURCH, JR.

Ah, here we are at last! The bewitching one now appears for dissection.
One of those really handsome fellows that the girls cannot keep from admiring,'——
an olive green complexion that reminds one of the far off shores of Sicily, or the
dreamy land of tropical Mexico.

Eyes that the heart of many a girl has smashed,
Or started it fluttering at an unusual pace.

Should have been a snake charmer, as his two “piercers” would bring any-
thing to earth. “Such a ﬁne pair of eyes,” one admiring damsel remarked; and
that appears to be common talk among all of them. Leaving the question of eyes,
however, “Sam” is a fine chap, who worries little, eats heartily and studies
"some." Can use more big words to the square inch in an English composition
than a village squire would use in a four hour Independence Day address.

CHANDLER CARTER CLARK.

A model youth and a ﬁne student, who burns plenty of midnight oil over his
books. The only man in German that Berger can safely call on all occasions.
Never known to have his “Soll und Haben" marked, but somewhat manages to
get it about right. The only way we can ﬁgure it out is that he has some Dutch
girl that he goes to see on the sly.

COEDS.

The bashful Sophomore reporter was afraid to say anything about his
beauteous classmates, but refers the reader to a dictionary for the synonyms of
beautiful, wise, lovable, great, jolly, etc., which are to be applied to the following
young ladies:

Mary Emma McKean.

Florence Ann Eaton.
Jean Hamilton.

SCIENTIFIC CHEMICAL

FREDERICK DANNENBERG HAWKINS.

Hawkins is seldom seen these (lays, but the word has gone around that he is
working on a special formula to neutralize that common element, “ﬂunk.” As he
has had considerable experience with it, the work is very practical with him. Has
a good scientiﬁc mind and isn’t afraid to work when he once gets the notion.

THOMAS EARL WILLIAMS.

“Granny” has developed wonderfully since he linked interests with the Blue,
and Gold, thanks to his associations with Koch, McGinnis, et al. and can really
be trusted out at night after the village clock strikes eight. Is also inclined to show
a slight trace of sporting blood this year and isn’t a bad looking sort of a fellow
when you look him over carefully. If he doesn‘t blow himself up while testing
for a hidden element in water, he will doubtless be a great man some day.

APOLOGY.

Dear reader, kindly bear with us,
W'hile for a moment we discuss

The merits of each lad and lass,

The members of the Freshmen class.
Perhaps at places in this verse,

The sense may wander for a time;
"mt never mind. it might be worse,
\7Ve sacriﬁced it for the rhyme.

Or else, perhaps, the meter’s wrong,
Although the thought may be immense.
But never mind the meter, folks,

\Ve sacriﬁced it for the sense.
VVhate'er we have to say for you

That cuts, although it may be true,

G0 tell the Ed.; he'll make it right,
He’ll have to take the blame from you.
But if to you we offer fame,

If over you we make a fuss,

Don’t see the Ed.: he takes the blame.
But come, say pretty things to us.

CIVIL

HENRY HUGH BATES.

“Hughie,” as his friends all call him, is pretty good
stuff; in fact, the “exhibition” man of the Civils. In
the midst of the work of smiling on all his friends
he is fairly steady in his affection, and he is very
steady in the class’ affections. Bates has attempted
to perform all his duties here well, from boxes of
candy as a lower class man to Junior Prom activity
as a Junior and a digniﬁed, but still genial, attitude as
a Senior. He about ﬁts the ordinary idea—of girls———
of what a college man should be: they say his danc-
ing is divine. But the strange thing is that he is also
the professors’ reliance and his fellow-students’ pride,
a genial gentleman and good engineer.

RICHARD HARVEY JAMISON.

Awarded an arc-light halo as the jester, rymster,
and impersonator of the class. “Harv” is always
light at heart and willing to tell a tale to ﬁt the cir-
cumstances at any time you call on his good graces.
He likes to see the “keen dames” and chatter in their
midst. As he is a “civil” you cannot expect to hear
him quote a psalm, although he does know some
biblical phrases. Those “ﬁve brothers” who are evei
present at the time of need are acquaintances of his
and have stood by him in his troubles. Prominent in
ﬁeld athletics, he has held a place on the relay team
through his whole course. A stranger to fear, he has
never been trodden on by those who scare the Fresh-
men. VV. U. P. will some day thank its united soul
that this C. E. has been one of us.

82

JOHN LEO DESCH.

Desch is one of the few students who can mix
athletics and studies in correct proportions. He
doesn’t make much noise, but is “there” just the same.
Isn’t much inclined to delight in society functions and
cannot be said to be frivolous, but rather exhibits
those staid qualities essential for an engineer, a great
engineer.

WILLIAM CLANEY EDGAR.

“Pap,” to his equals, and “Honey, to his in-
feriors. He has a tired and sleepy look, but a “nerve”
that would put a steeple—jack to shame. This “civi1"
is very particular about his appearance; his hair espe-
cially is always highly groomed, his shoes well black-
ed, and his trousers well creased. It is claimed that
this neatness is the result of an “eye for musical tal-
ent.” He is noted for his great strength shown in
such deeds as putting “ﬁve brothers” to ﬂight or deal-
ing with “polar bear” when not in his usual angelic
mood. A good scholar, strong supporter of coeduca-
tion, often called on to keep the flies out of the library,
a man of dry wit and common sense, neat about the
house, gentle as a lamb, and “just. the thing” for a
lady to drive.

!!

REAM DELOSS ESHELMAN.

As R. D. is a C. E., you know his faults; but
where are there any better men? "‘A midget blonde
will suit, but if necessary I will take another chair
and take the heavier.” No woman will ever break his
heart, for, now weatherbeaten, this once vulnerable
orga11 has gained a leathery toughness. He cannot get
along with librarians, as they wish to know his real
name. He feels heavenly when playing the mandolin
on the stage or ﬁrst base on the ﬁeld. His shotgun
and ﬁshing rod show that his is a sport of the highest
type—-when he is not hard after engineering subjects.
“Eat pork and get fat and you will be up to the dress
qualiﬁcations.”

83

WALTER GEORGE KANHOFER.

A fellow—towns1nan of “Kiss,” you would expect
him to be a ladies’ favorite; and so he is, but instead
of playing forward, like his colleague, he plays back
with these results: “Oh, He’s grand!” “Isn’t he noble
looking?” “Oh, I like him!” “He’s so appreciative!"
“A perfect gentleman!” They hardly know him, but
claim, contrary to common opinion, that girls do have
a proper appreciation for a good fellow when they see
him. The boys, however, know him, and can back up
the coed intuitions with observation. Kanhofer, be-
sides being a good engineer, stars in basketball and is
a wonder at throwing fouls, but doesn’t make many
himself. It is said that the young ladies are safe in
their compliments, some one out i11 the cold, cold
world having thrown him a “life” line.

ALBERT WERNERBERG KEENAN.

Our society representative. He knows everybody
from city constable down to U. S. Senator. It is said
that he once dined with King Edward. “Al” is al-
ways on hand and generally knows a few things and
has some fun telling them. He has been to more
social functions than the President (of the Anti-Sa-
loon League) and is known as the originator of the
“King Brady” haircut. VVatch “VVh0’s Who” for the
next few years.

GEORGE BUFFINGTON KISSINGER.

“Buﬁ‘.” will be remembered among the fellows
as an advocate of the “square deal.” He has never
been known to hold a grudge and thinks that every-
body is doing his best. Troubled sometimes by in-
visible planes passing at various angles through his
brain, “Kiss” yet has the quality of sticking to a
thing and of keeping quiet until he has something to
say. The class of ’OS will remember “Brother George"
as the big, good—natured “Civil;” the girls (believing,
as they do, in reciprocity) will remember him, each
acc Jrding to her own happy experiences.

84

ROY CHALMERS SALKELD.

If you see a skirt moving not faster than an exe-
press, keep your eye on the grand old boy, very popu~
lar among the ladies because of a pleasing gift of gab
a11d a white collar. Salkeld has a habit of making a
noise with his face varying from an argument to a
warm blaze of bygone deeds. He holds the pro-
fcssors at his mercy, as he can corner almost any
director in his own argument provided the class does
not stop the warbling or the professor wake up. He
has missed his calling, for had he followed his bent he
would end up as a prominent lawyer, though as an
engineer he can hold his own with credit.

GEORGE EDWARD SHERBON.

His characteristics are puzzling to the naturalist.
since he betrays that whiclf crowns both the godly
and the ungodly. Place him among lambs and he is a
lion; among lions and, lo! a lamb. He is as capable of
leading a Y. M. C A. meeting as he is of breaking
one up. His power of hypnotism has been illustrated
upon a ruling minority as well as upon a fair subject
in Elizabeth. Indeed, report says the P. & S. E. R. R.
is about to sue him for damages to the ties between
Elizabeth and Pittsburgh. In this connection we
might mention his prominence in track athletics. He
has abundance of higher English and has done much
to raise the standard of that subject among “civils."

KARL HENRY SCH RIVER.

Karl is hard to please; but when he is pleased he
is very much tickled indeed. He cannot be bossed or
taken advantage of. He is of Missouri blood and
takes nothing for granted. He must have an interest
in the Pollock Stogie Co., judging from the amount of
that ﬁrm’s product he consumes. He deserves his C.
E. both for his work and for his class loyalty. A
good sport who will not be bluffed.

SAMUEL EDWARD VANDIRVO RT.

“Sammy” is an exception to all rules of “Civil”
etiquette; we would not dare to tell you why, for his
civil brethren might be embarrassed. If you want to
be sadly fooled, look into Sammy's face: you cannot
ﬁnd any sign of a rough house artist; then follow him
into the gym and watch him hang a few human be—
ings on the wall just to exercise himself a bit, 21
twinkle growing in his eye as the fury increases. He
has a warm heart for the fair ones and the fair ones
for him; indeed, can be found many times in the halls
absorbing the smiles of some Coed. Sammy is handy
to have around, as he can go where his classmates
dare not even glance. You never ﬁnd him unpre-
pared to deal with any arithmetic that falls to his
hands. \\’ait till Sammy gets into the game!

MINING

HARRY ALFRED BLACKBURN.

Blackburn is our only miner, but he is a good one
and there is a large amount of him. As he is very
quiet with his “rocks” and is not proclaiming his
achievements, we might mention for him that he has
already made himself a great local reputation by dis-
covering, with the aid of the “sensitive instruments
and delicate balances of,the laboratory,” a trace of
gold in the Senior class pen. Moreover, he is ru-«
mored to have located a treasure in Oakmont, which
probably accounts for his happy and contented dis-
position. i

MECHANICAL

PHILIP ERSKINE ANGLE.

“Phil” is a designer of dangerous pipe systems.
A mark for all Stewart's questions on turbines. Only
man in the class whose clothes are good enough to
steal [where went the hat and coat?]. Highest
minded man in the class, but a noted lady—killer.

GRANT CURRY.

J. P. Morgan Curry, our millionaire, author of
“Curry"s Notes on Stewart’s Lectures.” Member of
Stewart's “Tube Brigade” and Harley’s assistant.
Noted as a conductor of coed automobile trips.
Thinks the street car company needs books worse than
himself. “O, darn the expense!”

JOHN DILWORTH HARLEY.

Harley is a noted authority on super—heated steam
and “hypothetical diagrams.” Delights in entertain-
ing class with songs which he hears at the Gayety. He
is a steel mill specialist and a bunch of nerves. Only
thing he doesn’t know is what becomes of X when you
cancel in an equation.

HARRY DENNY MAGAW.

“Maggie” is another Gayety specialist and eke a
member of the Tube Brigade. Smiles only on one side
of her face, likes to have her picture taken (P), has an
iron constitution and an oxidized dome. Professional
juggler of “seamless tubes” and a noted dancing mas-
ter. Very quiet and afraid of girls.
