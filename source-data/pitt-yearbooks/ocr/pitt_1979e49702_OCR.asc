Pitt’s 1978 football season per-
haps better off forgotten, un-

doubtly will be the subject of V

laggard memories — memories
if a most erratic and tu-

:ultuous season.

Pitt, of course, needed a de-

nt, if not above-average, sea-

- just to reach Orlando, F 1a.,
its fourth straight bowl
.. The Panthers responded
an 8-3 regular season
I — no cause for spiking a
ll, but good enough to
he attention of the Tan-
Bowl people.
1978 season began fa-
enough: four straight
lamed at times for not
up to their potential
“ f".‘i;elatively weaker teams,
the Panthers posted the victories
nonetheless.

They first traveled to New Or-
leans for a taste of Bourbon
Street, a feel for jazz, and a
sense of easy victory on the foot-
ball ﬁeld. Tulane’s Green Wave
did its best to survive the Pan-
thers’ tidal force, but Pitt had its
ﬁrst victory of the season, 24-6.

The Temple Owls, remember-
ing Pitt’s 76-0 routing in the Vet
the year before, visited Pitt Sta-
dium with nothing less than
their prides at stake. Pitt having
trouble getting the ball to
“Skilled People” (especially All-
American receiver Gordon
Jones), fell behind at halftime, 6-
3, but managed a 20-12 victory.

The Panthers then hosted
highly regarded North Carolina
and were forced to play catchup
once again. Needing a last-min-
ute drive (engineered by soph-
omore quarterback Rick Tro-
cano and his ﬂeet of receivers),
Pitt escaped with a narrow 20-
16 Win.

103

The Panthers posted their
next win at Boston College, 3?
15, boosting their mark to 4.
and obtaining a 9th rank in
nation.

Pitt’s honeymoon was S00!
end. Notre Dame made sur
that. Playing three quarte'
persistent football, Pitt
quished a 10-point lea('
allowed the Irish to set‘)
points in the ﬁnal 14 Ir
The Panthers left Soutl
26-17 losers.

A rugged Florida Sta
then visited Pittsburgh
though it never rea~
Panther endzone, for
drive killing Pitt fuml
second-quarter touch
enough to squeek out a 7?3"v"\7i?1'.

The Panthers reached their
season low in Annapolis the fol-

lowing week. A surprisingly su-
perior Navy team embarrassed

the Panthers, 21-11, in the
“most frustrating game” of
Head Coach jackie Sherrill’s ca-
reer. A game, in which Pitt’s
rushing attack backpeddled for
minus 28 yards against a nation-
ally competitive Midshipmen de-
fense the Panthers barely cling-
ing to a 19th national ranking.

The second half of Pitt’s 1978
season began with Sherrill dis-
carding his customary sweatsuit
and donning a sportcoat and tie
along the sidelines. Exactly
what spurred the change of at-
tire or what impact it had is
uncertain, but Pitt won three of
its last four games and received
a bid to play in the Tangerine
Bowl.

The team’s good fortunes re-
turned at Syracuse, where Pitt
was puzzled by a 1-7 Orange
team ﬁnally pulled it together
with a second half drive. It was
another come-from-behind nar-
row victory, 18-17.

After their 52-7 dismantling of
arch-rival West Virginia, the
Panthers bombed the Army, 35-
17, but, not without difﬁculty.
Army took an early 7-0 lead and
was on the brink of another
touchdown when Pitt’s senior
safety Jeff Delaney recovered a
Cadet fumble on his own 1-yard
line. Thirteen seconds and 99
yards later, Delaney had scored
the third longest touchdown in
his school’s history, and the
game was tied at 7. The Army
never regained their footing.

Rated No. 13 in the Nation,
Pitt was ready for a con-
frontation with No. 1 Penn
State, the cross state rival of
Pitt. The Panthers entered the
game as two-touchdown under-
dogs and were given nothing
more than a prayer against the

undefeated Nittany Lions.
113

Pitt lead throughout much of L
the second half, before ﬁnally Vi.
succumbing to the Sugar Bowl    "
bound Lions, 17-10. If there _.‘ 1%,
ever was justification for optim- P
ism after a loss, Pitt had it after
this game. The Panthers main-
tained their No. 13 ranking as
well as their conﬁdence, seemed
fully recovered from their mid-
season slump, and appeared
ready for the bowl matchup
with North Carolina.

Disney World, swimming
pools and 80 degree weather
awaited the Panthers in Or-
lando, site of the 33rd annual
Tangerine Bowl. Eight Decem-
ber days of fun and games was
had by the Panther squad who,
Sherrill said, deserved such re-
ward.

All good times ceased the
night of the game. The sun-
tanned Panthers were dis-
membered, 30-17, by a North
Carolina State team playing not
as an unranked and seven-point
underdog team.

Thus endth the 1978 Panther
football season. The going was
not always smooth, but the Pitt
team was a young, in-
experienced squad. The Pan-
thers’ strive for improvement
during the ’78 season gives hope
for a brighter 1979.

This years water polo team ended up
with a 12 and 11 season record. This
was indeed an accomplishment after
the team lost its goalie early in the
season. The captain of the team, Mike
Schoﬁeld, who had never before played
goalie ended up in the nets for the rest
of the season. Schoﬁeld ﬁnished the
season as the M.V.P. of the team. Other
outstanding seniors on the team includ-
ed Butch Silva, Dave Plocki, and Eric
Brader. The other captain for the ’78
season was Jorge Machicote.

Coach ]ay F isette feels conﬁdent
about the upcoming 1979 year. “We
are all looking forward to a good sea-
son. Most of the players are returning
and the recruiting went well,” said
Fisette. The water polo team is looking
forward to post season play next year.

This years Pantherette volleyball team was
the first squad to bring home an Eastern
Championship. At the EAIAW Champion-
ships, they won 13 consecutive games to
clinch the title for Pitt.

This victory qualified the team for the Na-
tionals held at the University of Alabama.
Here the girls went 2-3 overall to place 13th
in the nation.

Under coach Mike Hebert, sophomores Cin-
dy Chambers and Ingrid Mueller.and fresh-
man Paula Olsen were all members of the U.S.

The Pantherette ﬁeld hockey team
ended its season with a 3 and 5 won-
loss record. Two Pantherette ﬁeld hock-
ey players were sited as outstanding
athletes. These players were sophomore
Linda Eby and freshman DeeDee Kan-
ter. They played at the AIAW National
Championships in Ellensburg, Washing-
ton.

This was the first year at Pitt for
Coach Audrey Davison. “Our athletes
here at Pitt are enthusiastic and skilled,
said Davison. Next season the Pan-
therettes will have an expanded sched-
ule and host a ﬁeld hockey invitational.

The 1978 season found the Pitt Soccer team
ending up with a 5-7-1 won-loss record. The
season was described as an up and down affair
by coach Leo Bemis. The team lost 3 of its
starters and had to play with other various in-
juries. The best game of the season came against
Penn State. At the time the Lions were ranked
8th in the nation. Pitt’s upset of P.S.U. was one
of the few highlights of the season.

Senior captain of the team Mark Nigh has
already been drafted by the Pennsylvania Stoner
professional Soccer team. Other outstanding sen-
iors on this years squad were captain Irwin
Seigel, Tim Pearson, Jedd Zaring, Craig Con-
nely, and Marty Moyer.

Coach Bemis is looking to have a better season
in 1979. Recruiting has gone well and all the
booters are ready for hard work and success.

WOMEN’S TRACK

Sprinter and team MVP Gwen Murray
lead the Pantherettes to their best
track season ever. The Pitt women
placed third out of 68 teams at the
Eastern Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (EAIAW) out-
door championships; they ﬁnished ﬁfth
at the indoor meet.

Murray, Leslie Palmer, Cissy Wil-
born, and Linda Mitchell combined to
win the EAIAW championship in the
800-meter relay, setting a new meet
record in the process. Murray was a
second-place ﬁnisher in the open 400
meters, while the four placed third in
the 400-meter relay.

Palmer was a silver medalist in the
hurdles, while teammates Karen
Krickho, high jump, Carman Scherich,
]avelin, and Peri ]ede Radecic, Shot
put and discus, were also top-six ﬁnish-
ers.

Krichko set a new Pitt record of 5-
91/4, while Radecic also broke team
records in her events. Both placed at
the Penn Relays, as did Marie Ribik, a
fourth—place ﬁnisher at the EAIAW
meet.

Murray placed ninth at the AIAW
nationals, in the 400, the relay team
eighth, Krichko, fourteenth and Radec-
ic was thirteenth in the Shot put.

Other records were set this year by
the two-mile relay of Jane Strause,
Brenda Chorpening, Maria Scillo and
Karen Bradley, The 400-meter relay,
Wilborn in the long jump and the
indoor 880-yard relay team.

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Women’s Cross Country

The women’s cross-country team
completed its third season with a 2-2
dual-meet record, despite the loss
freshman Melanie Nickerson early in
the season. Nickerson, out with stress
fractures, later returned to the squad
and competed during the indoor and
outdoor track seasons.

Key runners for the Pantherettes
were Brenda Chorpenning and Margie
Lee. Lee, a freshman, was named Most
Valuable Performer by the coaches and
began the season with a second-place
finish at the California State
Invitational.

Besides hosting their own
invitational in November, the
Pantherettes competed in meets at
Penn State, Bucknell, Indiana of Pa.,
but the athletic department chose not
to send the team to regional
championships in Vermont. Due to
budgetary problems, Pitt most likely
will not field a womens cross-country
team in inter-colligiate competition
next year.

ALPHA EPSILON PI

This year has been a foundation-building year for the
brothers of AEPi. We have united ten brothers who know the
true meaning of fraternalism. Our family-sized group
encourages the cooperation through the establishment of
common goals. Although we are receptive of new members,
we never wish to become so big that the fraternal bonds are
lost. Our events this year included a Halloween party with a
raffle. The grand prize was a basket of cheer. We participated
in Homecoming and Greek Week and succeeded, (with the
help from Fiji and Tri-Delt), to win the chugging contest. We
won an American Cancer Society plaque for our fund-raising
efforts. We also achieved one-hundred percent participation in
the Central Blood Bank drive. Our diverse activities plainly
demonstrate our relatively smaller size does not prohibit AEPi
from being an active part of the Greek system. In addition to
our activities, our brothers remember their individual goals.
Included in our membership are engineers and pre-
professionals. Participation does not take the place of studies,
it is complimentary. Next year is AEPi’s tenth anniversary at
Pitt. Our goal for this historical first decade is to welcome new
brothers into our fraternity and share with them our good
times.

. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. had an active year at Pitt.
In sports, the fraternity advanced to the championships in
intramural football and captured second place. During the
winter term, the brothers qualiﬁed for the basketball playoffs.
As always, the brothers were busy with philanthropic and
community projects. In the fall we held a rafﬂe for the United
Negro College Fund that proﬁtted a sizeable return for this
charity. Our fall community project was a day spent helping
the handicapped children of Youth City. During the winter
term, the brothers acted as Big Brothers for the under-
privileged children of Homewood. Socially, we held a
Halloween party in the Student Union ballroom and awarded
a trophy for the best costume. We also won everyone’s heart
with a Valentine party in February. The most extravaganza
event of the year is our annual Black and Gold Ball held at
the end of the year. Brothers come from around the world for
this exciting event. We wish to thank the University which
donated ad-space in our booklet that is published before the
ball. This summary of Alpha Phi Alpha exempliﬁes the ways
the fraternity continues to show progress to the people and

university community.

Gamma Sigma Sigma National Service Sorority was founded on Drexel University in 1952,
where a unique idea became a reality. A sorority founded on the ideals of service, friendship, and
equality was established.

Preserving these ideals throughout its history has been a challenge, but Gamma Sigma Sigma
has continually expanded its organization, developed policy and encouraged change that stren-
thened and retained the ideals in responsive forms.

The purpose of Gamma Sigma Sigma is to assemble college and university women in the spirit
of service of humanity. The purpose is lived by members who work in co-operation with others,
enjoy the feeling of accomplishment that a successful service program promotes, and understand

that differences in people are strenghts in any organization that welcomes differences and allows
members to use them.

DELTA SIGMA CHI

The Delta Sigma Chi fraternity was founded on january 23, 1963 in Johnstown, Pa. At that
time UP] was only a two year school so many of the fraters transferred to Oakland. They began
to organize and in 1969 received recognition from the university. The school year 1978-79 was
truly an impressive one. We began in the fall by winning the intramural softball and soccer
championships. We also placed third in intramural football. During the fall term, we added ﬁfteen
beautiful little sisters and eight new fraters. One of our brothers became Internal Vice-President
of IF C. Our second term surpassed the fall term when we grabbed seven Greek Week trophies
and broke two all-time records. We collected $10,323.55 for the American Cancer Society. This
total was over a third the amount collected by the entire Greek community. We also donated 51
pints of blood which gave us a winning 160 percentage. Three of our members were active in the
planning of the weeks activities through their membership on the Greek Week Committee. We
are trying to change the fraternity stereotype by becoming involved in community activities. We
believe our activities demonstrate that Delta Sigma Chi is number one at Pitt.

On October 8, 1978, with the help of our national
director of expansion, we formed a Lambda Chi Alpha
colony on Pitt’s campus. During the course of the fall term,
26 associate members joined their efforts to build a close
group. On December 8, 1978, thirteen of the associate
members were initiated as brothers. During the winter term,
seven more young men became associate members. We have
all been working together during this building year to
establish a chapter at Pitt. We hope to reach our goal and
become a full-ﬂedged chapter in the coming year. Lambda
Chi Alpha participated actively in the Greek Week events
and we hope to be an even stronger participant in the
future. The colony extends sincere thanks for all the support
it has received from Pitt’s Greek community. Through the
work of our brothers and associate members, Lambda Chi
Alpha plans to become an active part of both the Greek
system and the university community.

Epsilon Kﬁzpa chapter of
Phi Beta Sig a Fraternity,
Inc. had a very successful
1978-79 year. During the
homecoming activities in the
fall, our president was elected
campus “Homecoming King”.
Also, one of our sweethearts
became a member of the King
& Queen Court. Naturally,
the brothers of the blue and
white took pride in their
individual accomplishments.
As a group, the fraternity was
active in charities, sports, and
social activities. Late in the
first term our brothers
participated in several service
projects both on campus and
in the community. Our
sweethearts participated in
the Hand-in-Hand project
where they brightened a day
for retarded children. Our
athletic abilities enabled us to
capture the coveted IFC
basketball crown and also
place third in intramural
track. Socially, we held a very
successful Coronation
Cabaret. During the year we
welcomed eight new brothers
into the fraternity and
coronated thirteen sisters as

‘Phi Gamma ‘Delta

Pitt’s Panther F iji’s came back to school with their house in
the middle of a remodeling project. By mid-October, however,
things were shaping up, thanks to the help of industrious
brothers. It was another active year on the social service
calendar, which was highlighted by many activities, such as
rush functions at the Western Pennsylvania School for Blind
Children. A new social service endeavor was held at the house
— a Cardio-Pulmonary Resusitation Course — for the beneﬁt of Founded: April 22, 1848

our neighbors. Naturally, the year’s activities included a Estab. at Pitt: 1864 and
complete social calendar. The annual Fiji Island Party is Feb. 3, 1917

always the high point of the social year. The usual parties and Officers:

mixers were held along with other special events including: Pres. John Clark

the Black Diamond Ball, a ski trip to Seven Springs, Greek Treas. William Wallander
Week and the 62nd Annual Norris Pig Dinner. And, as always, Rec. Sec. Kevin Conner

This year being our ﬁrst here at Pitt, was a grow-
ing year. During Homecoming we won the banner
competition. In November six new brothers were
initiated. We also sent a chartering team to W.V.U.
to re-charter their chapter. On Dec. 8 we held our
Founders day banquet at Del’s Restaurant. Greek
week was very exciting for us this year. We com-
bined our efforts with Chi Omega and Sigma Chi to
get a first place in talent night, second place in fun
night, and two third places in chariot and chugging.
Two of our brothers, Clark Louden and Mike
McFarland were initiated into Order of Omega.
During the winter term we initiated 2 others into our
brotherhood. On March 31, we held our annual Rose
Ball, at Crossgates Inn. The Rose Court consisted of
Michelle Frey, Jeanne Cetchow, Marianne Rowe,
and Debbie York.

PI LAMBDA PHI

Pi Lambda Phi welcomed 18 new brothers into our
brotherhood making us the largest fraternity on
Q campus with 55 members. “The house that leads”
received a loan that enabled the brothers to add a
w U lighted dance ﬂoor and rennovated pool room to an
already impressive house. The year’s activities ranged
from sports, to philanthropy and social. In the fall the
brothers qualiﬁed for the intramural football playoffs.
a m a During Greek Week we had 100 percent
participation in the blood drive and received an
Outstanding Participation trophy — an award

. cherished by all the brothers. Our social events were
U highlighted by a special formal on the Gateway
Clipper. Fortunately, no one went for an unexpected

swim during the evening cruise on the three rivers.
The brothers felt special pride in certain individuals
efforts that merited exceptional honors including
special prosecutor for the IFC judicial board, K.M.H.

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

Pitt’s Chi-Omicron chapter maintained
their reputation on campus as being one
of the finer social fraternities. The themes
for our functions ranged from baseball to
costumes and were well received by the
University community. The 1979 year
also marked a successful year for SAE in
terms of Greek standing. High ﬁnishes in
both Homecoming and Greek Week
festivities, as well as a respectable finish
in the ﬁnal IF C athletic standings, are
indications to this brotherhood of greater
things to come for us at Pitt.

PI'IT IS GREEK TO ME

The fraternities and sororities of the University of Pittsburgh are now, and have been for a
long time, an intergal part of the campus scene. There are over 1500 Greeks in 22 fraternities
and 15 sororities. This system provides the student participants with the opportunity to live
in a fraternal environment, to participate in community service activities, and to be involved
in organized social affairs.

The Greek system produces many student leaders around campus. Among other activities
there are many “BROTHERS and SISTERS” involved with Student Government Board, The
Pitt News, the OWL, WPGH, ODK, and the list continues. There are many authority
positions to be held right within each fraternity or sorority and on IFC and PANHEL
committees.

The “GREEKS” are very high on scholastic academic standing. Each fraternity and
sorority tries to provide its members with the proper atmosphere necessary to attain this goal.
The system schedules its activities to ﬁt in with the diverse schedules of its individual
members. This lets the “GREEK” develop to his or full academic potential.

Each year in March the annual Greek Week is held. During this time of “CELEBRA-
TION”, there are many activities to be associated within charity, competition, and social
events. Last year the “CREEKS” pet charity was the AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY.
Through the prize-winning efforts of Delta Sigma Chi, the phenomenal amount of $30,000.00
was raised. Competition events are held in Greek Sing, Talent Night, Fun Night, and the
Chariot Races. Along the social lines there are “HAPPY HOURS”, ALL-GREEK MIXERS,
and the ﬁnale of the festivities, the GREEK FORMAL.

The Greek system at Pitt is alive, well, and thriving. There is great opportunity for
individual and group development for the ones who join a fraternity or sorority on campus.
That is why we say

“PI'IT IS GREEK TO ME.”

Chi Omegas come in all different shapes and sizes. We
have our Baby Ellens, Tall Laures and Mama Piehutas.
Just as their looks differ, so do their activities — some are
busy teaching, some engineering, some nursing, some
social working or psychology or economic studying and
some still deciding. Their extra curricular activities also
differ — some are busy studying some mixing socially,
some get in early in the evening, some just get in very
very early. Some like to go on nightly walks, others prefer
to take a taxi. Chi Omegas are always striving to be the
best person they can be — constantly working to better
their skills. Athletically some excell in swimming and field
hockey, while some sisters try to improve their throwing
arms by aiming small objects at a given target. Some try
to improve their theatrical arts by singing out windows
for all those in the quad to appreciate. Some take their
skills at dancing, whether marathoning it or on stage.

1979 was another special year for Chi Omega. The
memories of rush, the pledges, the informal and formal,
the Christmas party and Senior Night are all too
numerous to mention but all of us have our own unique
memories that will stay with us throughout the years.

Once I was one . . . now I am many.
Once we were many . . . now we are one.
Am I a leader or a follower? Am I the
one who works to implement the ideas or
do I come up with the ideas? Am I the
one who has a smile when the going’s
rough? Can I rise to the challenges life
thrusts my way? How can I use the God-
given talents I have? VVhat are my goals
in life? Alone, I’ll never know. But with
Tri-Delta, I’ll never be alone. Oh, my
sisters won’t always be ﬂocking around
me. And they’ll never force me to be
someone I’m not. But they will challenge
me to be all that I am. Life in Tri-Delta
is growth. A growth that comes from
sharing, laughing, crying, creating,
cooperating, criticizing, accomplishing,
failing, thinking, feeling, caring, living,
loving.

In September we knew we

had a lot of work ahead of us.
But, we managed to have a
successful rush which included
many unique rush parties.
Included were a fashion show, a
sundae party, and a fondue
party.

In the fall we had a visit from
our national delegate Sara
Zaban, we participated in
Homecoming and won first in
banner, and for some fun we
crashed a few fraternity parties
in Halloween costumes.

In the winter term we started
off with Fraternity Tasting
Night. Thanks to all the
fraternities and sororities who
participated, the night was
successful.

In Greek Week 1979, we

were successful in winning first
in Chariot. We also showed that
we had some talent when Janet
and Mary participated in
“Saturday Night Live.”
Congratulations to ]anet for
being elected Panhellenic

DELTA ZETA

Delta Zeta is kind of

unique for a sorority. A major
reason for that is we stress
individuality. VVhen we say,
“It takes all kinds”, we’re not
just talking Carbonza beans.
VVhat other group can boast
of a hobbit, 4 Samurai chefs,
an untemperamental artist,
Tuck me Twins, a waz, 52
coneheads, a Martian and a
Planet, a dictator, a popcorn
queen, a Star, a submarine
woman, one person with a
latex body and another with a
latex brain. VVhy, we even
have a Ralph, an Emelia, an
Irving and pelicans under the
wallpaper. Just about the only
thing we don’t have is a
Linda, so whenever anything
goes wrong we blame it on
her. (Linda has become close
to getting arrested a number
of times for sunbathing on the
ledge).

We just love selling

hoagies, and since our favorite
food is leftover — we can’t
lose either way.

But what really separates us
from all the rest is that we
don’t need the elevator.

In Oct. Sigma Chi held its annual Derby Days competition. Tri-Sigs did well, taking ﬁrst place
in charity for the second year straight. Overall we took second place. “Pitt Through the Looking-
Glass” was the theme for home-coming and in keeping with this we chose to build a float hailing
Pitt football through the years. We were involved in social service projects, holding a party for
children from Pa. Assoc. for the Blind with Delta Sigma Phi fraternity, and holding a Christmas
party for children from an area school. The Christmas party was held with Phi Kappa Theta, and
was complete with food, tree, and elves. The new year began about the same time as work on
Greek Week. We donated 100% blood, and raised over $800 for the American Cancer Society.
The other activities were enjoyed by everyone. We won a second place trophy in Talent Night for
a comedy sketch, and took ﬁrst place in the chariot competition. We won an outstanding
participation trophy to ﬁnish off a good Greek Week. On April 6, we held our annual spring 237
formal at the Marriott, with everyone enjoying a good time.

The Resident Student Asso-
ciation serves as the united
voice of the University of
Pittsburgh students living
in the resident halls. The
RSA provides formal input
to the Housing Office and
the Office of Residence Life
and its primary concern is
to promote and protect the
welfare of these students.
Along with serving as the
main liason between resi-
dent students and Univer-
sity administration, the
RSA provides numerous
programming activities for
the resident students. These
programming activities cul-
minate each year with the
annual RSA WEEK, which
is a week filled with special
activities in which the resi-
dent students can partici-
pate. Because every resi-
dent student is a member of
the RSA we are one of the
largest organizations on
campus with a full member-
ship of over 4,000 students.

. . . IN SUMMARY . . .

. . . The theme of this years book was PUZZLES! Just as the theme it
was indeed PUZZLING at times in these offices. Many days as I
overlooked the happenings from my perch, I wondered if this book
would ever make it to the Herff Jones Publishing Co. Finally, 13
months from its beginings, it was ready . . . late but ready none the
less.

. . . I’d like to thank a few people for their long hours of labor (ones of
love naturally). To Bill, Sharon, Chris, Melinda, Diane, Lori, Mich-
elle, ]ean, Anne, and any other who answered the phones and made
up those ever lovable triplicate forms, I thank-you. To George, C.T.,
and the Herff ]ones Company for their patience with our missed
(very missed) deadlines and whatever else may have gone wrong. To
Lucy, Tony, ]ean, Ken, Lois, Lisa, and those loyal 1979 staffers who
did their part to make the book. To the 1980 staff who took upon
their shoulders to finish the book. And last but not least to Larry
Lunsford, our fearless adviser. Thanks Larry for standing behind us all
the way and giving the moral support needed at the most trying
times.

. .. To the patrons of the book, thank-you for purchasing the 1979
edition and patiently waiting to receive your copy. To Ron Davidson
who took care of business matters, cometimes. And to Lance Chap-
man who gave us his guidance for awhile as the 1979 Editor-in-Chief.
Also a large thank-you is extended to the Stevens Studios for their
senior photography coverage.

 In closing I hope each and every person will remember and
cherish the 1979 OWL in his or her own way. I sincerely hope that,
though a bit “PUZZLED”, all the pieces will ﬁt together.

here's to WhOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ???,
here’s to YOUUUUUUUUUUUU !!!,

THE OWL

Homecoming 1978 — It was a full week
of explosive activities, great music, mouth-
watering food, fantastic entertainment and
a victorious football team.

It was a view of “Pitt Through the Look-
ing Glass”, a recollection of Pitt in the past,
the excitement of the present and the
dreams of the future.

The Week brought with it, cold weather
and midterms, but fun and laughter reigned
over the celebration.

Chuck Mangione dazzled the ears of a
sellout crowd to start off the week with an
outstanding success. Students made dona-
tions of their life-giving gift of blood at the
ﬁrst annual Campus-wide Homecoming
Blood Drive. Magic, music, mime, and art,
entertained those who feasted at the out-
door cafe, while colorful banners flew,
frisbee throwing champions showed their
style, and dummies were made ready to
burn in effigy at the bonﬁre. King, queen
and Court were announced at the Variety
‘Amateur Hour’ Show, and reigned over the
activities of the week. Student leaders were
honored for their efforts, while all Night
Movies provided a great opportunity for
stud -time relaxation. Mid-week excitement
let oose to the tune of the “Steel City
Stompers”, at as wild and crazy bimboss
night and the dice rolled while the money
ﬂowed at Monte Carlo Night.

FOR THOSE WHO DARE
TO DATE AN ENGINEER

Verily, I say to thee, love not an engineer, for an
engineer is a strange being, possessed of many
devils:

Yea, he speaketh eternally in parables, which he
calleth, “formulae,”

And he hath but one Bible — a handbook.

He talketh always of stresses and strains, and
without end of Thermo.

He showeth always a serious aspect and seemeth
not to know how to smile;

And he picketh his seat in the car by the springs
therein and not by the damsel beside him;

Neither does he know the waterfall except for its
power, not the sunset, but for her speciﬁc heat.

Always he carrieth his books with him, and en-
tertaineth his maiden with steam tables;

Verily, though his damsel expecteth chcolates,
when he calls he opens a package to disclose
samples of iron.

Yea, he holdeth his damsel’s hand, but only to
measure friction, and he kisses but to test
viscosity.

For in his eyes shineth a far—away look which is
neither love nor longing —

But a vain attempt to remember a formula.

There is but one key to his heart, and that is the
Tau Beta Pi key;

And when to his maiden he writeth of love and
signeth with crosses,

Mistake not the symbols for kisses, but for un-
known Quantities.

Even as a young lad he pulleth a girl’s hair to test
elasticity,

But as a man, he discovereth different devices;

For he would count the vibrations of her heart-
strings and reckon her strength-of-materials;

For he seeketh ever to pursue scientiﬁc in-
vestigation,

To inscribe his passions in a formula

And his affection in simultaneous equations in-
volving two unknowns.

His subjective and objective natures; their conﬂict
yielding diverse answers.

Reprinted from the February 14, 1979
issue of The Engineering Bulletin
