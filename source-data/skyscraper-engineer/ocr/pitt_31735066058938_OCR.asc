Heat Seekers

BY JOHN MANTON

In recent years infrared has changed from a labora-
tory curiosity to an increasingly important tool for
military uses such as search and track systems for hot
sources and missile guidance. This extensive use has re—_
sultcd primarily because infrared can supplement radar
in some applications and replace it in ‘others. The chief
advantage of infrared over radar is that it is passive;
that is, the target to be detected is its own source of
radiation. This occurs because all objects above zero
degrees K. radiate energy, the hotter the body, the
more radiation. The passive nature of infrared is such
that no transmitter is required, as in radar, and recep-
tion is virtually jam-proof.

Infrared (IR) systems have been employed by the
military in air—to-air, air—to-ground, ground-to-ground,
and ground-to-air applications. Such equipment can
search, detect, warn, identify, track, and guide.

Tracking takes over from radar at close range to
provide very high resolution results. The Navy “Side-
winder” is an example of an IR guided air-to-air missile
that can detect an enemy aircraft at a distance of
seven miles, track it down at twice the speed of sound,
and make a direct hit.

IR provides much better definition than radar. The
resolving power of a radar antenna or IR optical
system increases as its diameter is made larger. Since
useful IR wavelengths are on the order of 1000. times
shorter than those of the latest radars, IR systems pro-
vide detail that is unobtainable with radar. For example,
a microwave radar operating at 8 millimeter wavelength
and with an antenna 12 inches in diameter cannot
identify targets at a 5 mile range as being separated
unless they are laterally separated by more than %;
mile. On the other hand, an IR system with a 4 inch

mirror can easily identify the individual engines on a

plane at the same distances.

Some of the properties of IR have disadvantages.
Because it is passive, range information is difficult to
obtain. Purely optical methods for determining range
are very limited and are applicable for relatively short
ranges.

The shorter wavelength character of IR also intro-
duces. a disadvantage because IR lies at the frequencies
that are strongly absorbed by the constituents of the
atmosphere. In addition, strong scattering of the radia-
tion may occur from particles of about the same size

glengths through the atmosphere.

Generally IR system design has two major require-
ments:

(1) The system must be able to determine angular
location and other characteristics of targets
of interest accurately and reliable even though
other sources of IR radiation, not of interest
to the system, may be present.

(2) The data. received by the system must be in a
form to be acted on instantaneously automa-
tically, or after interpretation.

Infrared devices use optical, electronic, and photo-
electric methods to obtain information. Since they
operate chiefly in the wavelength region of the spectrum
between 1 and 15 microns, angular resolution limits
clue to diffraction effects are relatively-minor.

THE RED-EYE MISSILE contains propellant, electronic
guidance, and high-explosive warhead, and was designed
for use against low strafing and bombing aircraft.

The trend in current system design is primarily to-.
ward the use of the 3-5 micron region of the spectrum.
The absorption in this region limits to some extent the
tracking of hot bodies as jet engines or rocket engines,
since most of the radiation appears at these wave-
lengths. In somewhat longer wavelengths a good window
exists in the 8-14 micron region through which radia-
tion from objects only slightly higher in temperature
than the background can be transmittedquite easily.

Infrared engineers have recognized for some time
not only that many types of military targets radiate
profusely at wavelengths above 3 microns, but also
that the background problem is less severe than in the
1-3 micron region. However, a great deal of interest
follows the discrimination techniques against unwanted
background by applying spectral filtering with special
interference filters and space filtering through reticles
in the image plane. I

Image forming devices, such as infrared reconnais-
sance systems are benefiting from the rapid response
characteristics of new detectors. Such detectors as
indium antimonide give a more detailed picture at
high scanning speeds than the slower detectors.

Design problems involving sensitivity, discrimination,
look angle, and multiple-target capability are being
tackled with new optical and mechanical methods.

Some of the major infrared components are still
beingideveloped. Perhaps the most critical of these is
the detector or censor.

The most advanced detectors, in terms of sensitivity
response time, and spectral response, are diffused junc-
tion indium antimonide, lead selenide, p—type germa-
mium, and lead telluride. In their most sensitive forms,
these elements must be operated well below ambient
temperatures. ’

For adequate sensitivity, diffused junction indium
antimonide, germanium, and lead telluride must be
at temperatures approaching that of liquid nitrogen.
Some detectors, such as lead selenide, PEM (Photo-
electromagnetic) indium antimonide, and photoconduc-
tive indium antimonide can be operated at room or
solid carbon dioxide temperatures.

The low temperature operating requirements of the
3-5 micron detectors pose the problem of a practical
cooling method. Since detectors and optics are gene-
rally small, the cooling system also must be small.
Several approaches to getting a‘ cooling device produc-
ing --196 degrees C and below are underway. Liquid
nitrogen refrigeration using miniature Joule-Thompson
expansion looks promising. Of great interest are devices
based on “Peltier Effect” cooling of detectors.

Optical materials are widely sought. The substances
receiving the most attention include germanium, silicon,
arsenic trisulfide, calcium aluminat-e glass, and several
in the crystalline group (synthetic sapphire, magnesium

similar satelites will be used for highly accurate maps.

oxide, and alkali halides). As they have a high index
of refraction, low reflectance surface coatings have
been developed for optical elements.

Electronic processing circuitry, an important part
of the infrared device, is receiving considerable atten-
tion. Basically it accepts the signal generated bythe
detector and processes it to a form acceptable by the
presentation system. Engineers are looking for new
techniques to obtain optimum signal/noise character-
istics. Electronic filtering is being tried to get maximum
use of the signal while reducing the unwanted noise back-
ground.

Since it has to meet a variety of operating environ-
ments, the processing circuitry is usually custom-de-
signed. To meet the need for small size and low power
consumption, transistorized circuits are being developed.

At the output end of the most current infrared sys-
ems is some means of presenting the data for reorienting
their optics. However, in search, surveillance and recon
systems, the output information is presented visually.
Typical of the special presentation devices that are
becoming more popular are storage type cathode ray
tubes and two dimensional indicating tubes.

At the same time there are new techniques for re-
cording the output of scanning spot devices on film.
Magnetic tapes continue strongly as a useful medium
for recording data.

It is believed that there will be a continuing growth
and expansion of infrared for military use. The trend
of aero-military systems is toward more powerful en-
gines operating at higher speeds and altitudes. This will
contribute to the target becoming a better infrared
source or allow more radiaion to reach the detector.
Finally, the fact that infrared systems can be made
fairly light for use in satellites and other space vehicles
has the advantage for early detection of intercontinental
ballistic missiles. Q

Given native ability, years of experience—and time—the
craftsmen of grandfather’s day could work miracles of pre-
cision in wood and metal, using simple hand tools.

But craftsmen like that were too few——and too costly—to
ﬁll the demands of a rapidly growing nation wanting more of
everything fast, at prices most people could afford.

So engineering minds looked for ways to build craftsman-
like precision and skill into machines that could be used by
less skilled workers to build the many things America needed.
This is how the ﬁrst Delta Power Tool came into being, almost
forty years ago. It was a simple scroll saw, but with it even a
child could cut intricate patterns in wood.

Today there are 62 different Delta woodworking and metal-
working tools, ranging from a very modern scroll saw to pre-
cision metal lathes, and including a new radial drill that does
things impossible with any other drill press. Engineering, of
course, was vital in developing every one of these tools, and
it is engineers who keep the world’s most complete line of
power tools also the most modern in the world.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like
to work for, buy from and invest in.

pete internationally and give a good showing under the
Federation International de I’Automobile (F.I.A.) rules
and classes. This organization controls international
racing policy, while U. S. policy is largely governed by
the Sports Car Club of America. At present the 12
hour Sebring Florida race is the only race that counts
for F.I.A. points.

The highly publicized defeat of the Europeans at
Monza in 1957 was misleading. This race was to be
competitive for both continents, but favored the U. S.
The Americans brought large sprint cars of the Indian-
apolis type. These cars were designed to make left hand
turns at high speeds on an oval. The Europeans had only
cars suited for road racing. To be competitive they
would have had to design cars specifically for this race,
thus most manufacturers decided against entering.
Jimmy Bryan won with an average of l60..01 mph, a
speed allegedly too high for European tires. He was fol-
lowed by two other Americans, and three D Jaguars.

On the oval it must be conceeded that the Americans
are superior, but this type of racing is popular in the
U. S. while the Europeans have placed emphasis on
Grand Prix and sport car racing. In the U. S., racin-g
cars-are built by individuals and small companies. In
Europe, manufacturers have special divisions devoted
solely to the development of a racing car, but so far no
American manufacturer has shown interest in racing
even though a reputation may be had by building a
winning car. Mercedes Benz spends little money on ad-
vertising, they rely on their reputation for sales. This
name and others such as Ferrai and Maserati are famil-
iar to the newspaper-reading man of any country.

Many cars have been built in the U. S. to compete
internationally. The most notable of these at present
is the Formula I Scarab. This car formerly housed a
modified Chevrolet or Offenhauser engine. These en-
gines do not have the stamina required for long dis-
tance racing even though they produce competitive
brake horsepower and do well in the shorter SCCA
events. A new engine is now being built for the Formula
I G.P. car. It is hoped that this car will be completed
this year and if expectations are fulfilled might well be a
firm foothold for the U. S.

Another car well worth mentioning is the Corvette
SS. This car has the solid financial backing and engin-
eering of Chevrolet. It is designed like the best com-
petition cars with tubular space frame, magnesium
body, 4 speed transmission, and de-dion rear suspension.
But like the Scarab it lacks the bhp per cu. in. neces-

" MiAYiltel96O

   
 
 

sary for class racing under F.I.A.

A possible answer to the need for an engine is the
Tyce-Taylor. This engine is a water cooled in-line 4.
It is constructed by welding steel stampings together.
The parts are assembled on a jig and copper foil placed
between the joints. The assembly is placed in a furnace,
at 2000 degrees and a capillary action closes the joints
in a strong bond. The result is an engine weighing 175
lb., very light compared to similar European engines.

This engine has a bore of 3.5 in. and uses different
strokes depending on the displacement desired. The
largest version, with a displacement of 2.2 liters, pro-
duced 175 bhp at 6,000 rpm, or 1.3 h.p. per cu. in. This
engine would be well suited for the new 1.5 liter Formula
I displacement limit proposed for 1961.

Many racing engines are 4 cylinder and have a long
stroke to obtain 2.5 liters for G.P. racing. These engines
will probably be more successful with a shorter stroke
now possible under the new displacement limit. This
is an important factor. Piston speeds of 4,000 ft. per
min. are near maximum because of the stress limits of
present material and bearings. The higher rpm limit
of V-l2’s is a contributing factor to their generally high-
er output.

During a race maximum rpm should be exceeded to
take full advantage of the power available for accelera-
tion. As rpm increases bhp increases, reaches a peak,
then begins to decline. Maximum bhp rpm may be at
7,000 rpm, and torque declining after 5,000 rpm. By
shifting prematurely, torque will be higher at the fly-
wheel but lower at the rear axle because a lower ratio
gear has been engaged. The shifting rpm should be such
that the bhp before shifting is approximately the same
as after_shifting.

Ideally, the rpm should be kept at maximum bhp rpm
for maximum acceleration. By employing a 4-, or 5 ratio
transmission it is possible to stay closer to this rpm. Also
at high engine speeds the change in rpm when shifting
is greater than at low engine speeds. The smaller differ-
ence between gear ratios is more important for the high
rpm engine than for the low.

( I drive an MC which has 4 ratios, and very often
I am asked, “Is first gear like low-low in a truck, or is
fourth gear like overdrive.” It amuses me that I am
given a choice between two answers, neither -correct.
Because the foregoing explanation is usually useless, I
am forced to reply, “Neither, second and third are in-
between gears”)

H.p. peaks are generally over 7,000 rpm. To take ad-

vantage of the power available, the engine must be able
to withstand 8,000 rpm at frequent intervals; therefore
a stroke greater than 2 in. places demandin-g strains
on engine parts. Even so, the English for the most part,
continue to use a long stroke. Vanwall has a piston
speed of 4,070 ft. per min., and the_ Covetry Climax
engine 3930 fpm. The latter is very popular for racing
and powered the Formula I Cooper ear to the manu-
facturers championship for 1959.

Mercedes Benz was very successful with both the
G.P. car and the 300 SLR car, before retiring from rac-
ing in 1955. Basic engine design is the same for both
cars, the major difference is displacement. It is the com-
bination of unique designs that make it an engineering
masterpiece. The fuel injection and valve systems are
the most outstanding features. The most unorthodox
features are the in-line 8 instead of the common V, and
the crankshaft arrangement it necessitated.

Some earlier versions were welded, but later Mer-
cedes Benz used the more conventional aluminum-silicon
alloy casting. The block and head are one unit -of 4-
cylinders. Two of these units are bolted to a single
crankcase resulting in_ an_ir§.-line 8.

The long crankshaft would ordinarily be subject to
excessive torsional vibration, which could cause it to
break if the frequency of forces were sympathetic. To
eliminate this possibility, a power take-off gear between
the two center journals is used. This gear transmits
the power to a shaft running parallel to the crankshaft
and back to the flywheel. By splitting the crankshaft
this way, and using two vibration dampers, one at each
end, the possibility of breaking from torsional‘ vibration

RAM TUBES, like these used on Mercedes Benz engines, boost hp. a
small but insignificant amount. Many small performance boosters like
this account for the high output of this engine.

IN THE DESMODRONIC VALVE SYSTEM used in Mercedes Benz racing
engines, valves are actuated mechanically without the aid of springs.
This allows an increase in volumetric efficiency, and maximum rpm
is limited only in the strength of the parts.

was eliminated.

One of the factors contributing most to the high out-
put of this engine, is the desmodromie valve system.
This type of system is completely mechanical and uses
no valve springs. Two cam lobes are used for each valve.
The lobe that opens the valve drives the tappet di-
rectly. Closin-g is accomplished by a two finger rocker
pivoted on a shaft. One finger follows the closing lobe
profile. The other finger is forked and engages two
notches on the sides of the valve stem, just below the
top. A slot in the side of the tappet allows the finger to
pass through to the stem, this also prevents the tappet
from turning. Because the valve acceleration is not de-
pendent upon spring pressure, an acceleration two or
three times greater is used, and any possibility of valve
float was eliminated.

Another factor contributing to high power output is
fuel injection. The nozzles and pump are by German
Bosh and are the most elaborate of the various types.
The pump contains eight cam operated plungers, one
for each cylinder. These plungers meter the fuel exactly
as dictated by engine rpm, air temperature, and mani-
fold pressure. The fuel is pumped to each nozzle through
steel tubes of equal length. The nozzles are located in
the top of the cylinder walls and are covered by the
pistons when they reach top center. This reduces
clogging and high temperatures in the nozzle. The spray
is directed across the incoming air stream towards the
exhaust valve to help cool it. The complete arrange-
ment is more complicated than others but much more
precise.

In contrast to the desmodromic valve system, most

increase with rpm.

ly, light finger type cam followers are used with hairpin valve springs. Wet

builders prefer overhead camshafts with finger type
followers. In this arrangement a finger is pivoted at one
end on a shaft while the other end oscillates between
the cam lobe and the top of the valve stem. Borgward
goes so far as to use four valves per cylinder.

Most American racing engines are modified Detroit
products. These engines are not built with racing in
mind and lack the many finer points of those in Europe.
Valves are overhead, but the camshaft is located in
the block and actuates the valve through a heavy push-
rod and rocker arm. The additional weight of the valve
train necessitates high spring pressures, but this does not
erase the problem of valve float and bounce at high rpm.
Even with a desmodromic valve kit now available in the
U. S., breathing would be restricted by the long and
bendy port and manifold passages.

On some of these engines fuel injection is used,
usually Hillborn or Rochester. In both of these systems
the fuel is sprayed into the air stream just before enter-
ing the port. These systems lack the precise metering
of Bosh, in fact, in the Hillborn injector system the quan-
tity of fuel pumped is governed solely by rpm.

Because the fuel is injected constantly, a rich char-ge
is accumulated in the p-ort during the time the intake
valve is closed, or about 60% of the time between
firings. Before the valve opens the air is not moving past
the nozzle. When the valve opens the poorly vaporized
rich mixture contained in the port is drawn into the
cylinder. The remaining displacement is then filled with
a lean mixture. This effect becomes less as rpm in-
creases, but there is little if any power increase over
carburators.

MAY I960

In fact, the Europeans have had more success with
carburators. Almost all builders have tried fuel injection
at one time or another without success. The common
practice is to use Solex or Weber carburators. Both
have two throats and in effect work seperately as an
individual carburator for each cylinder. These are bolted
directly to the head over each intake port, and provide
a straight passage for the air stream. The slight restric-
tion of the venturis is evidently a small price to pay for
the relative simplicity of metering when compared with
fuel injection.

With this type of arrangement, tuned induction can
be used. This takes advantage of the fact that resonance
is created in the passages by the periodic intake stroke.
By extending each passage with a ram tube the funda-
mental frequency is changed. When the intake valve
opens, a negative pressure pulse travels out to the end
of the tube, then back as a positive pressure pulse just
before the valve closes. By varying the length of the
ram tubes, the period of the pulse can be made to coin-
cide with the valve open duration at maximum rpm.

»This gives a free supercharging effect, raising peak hp.

This same principle is often employed on the exhaust
system to scavenge the residual combustion gases.

There are many other fine points of European engine
designs, but the cost of employing them in a G.P. or
sports car is prohibitive for the individual or small com-
pany. Many years of costly research are necessary, and
experience at international races is also a requisite. Per-
haps with the -growing interest in sports car racing,
enough demand will warrant their production by a
large automobile manufacturer in this country.‘

SIIICC the technical wniter’s main intention is always
to give information, his entire discourse can be viewed
as a series of answers to a series of questions arranged
in some meaningful order. The tools of organization are
the ways of ordering the answers. Even when the lan-
guage is obscure or tortured, or explanatory details are
missin-g, even then strong organization gives us at least
the form of the information and leads us to intelligent
guesswork about the exact meaning. Many of us have
learned our basic lessons in physics and chemistry from
strongly organized, but obscurely written textbooks.

Now one of the first questions asked about anything
is simply, “What is it?” The answer to this question
clearly establishes the subject or problem and allows the
writer to proceed to the “aboutness,” that is, what he
has to say about the subject. The question is answered
with the technique of definition.

To define a word, we fence it in. We set limits or
boundaries for the meaning of the word. Often, a defi-
nition cannot give enough information to satisfy the
reader’s understanding. In order to fully understand
“What is it?” the reader may need to think through a
complicated set of relations and discover the answers to
such questions as “How does it‘ work? What are its
parts? Its qualities? Capacities?” Answering such ques-
tions results in expanded definitions which are usually
systems of paragraphs. When the term being defined also
represents the subject of the report or paper, full sec-
tions, or whole papers can be developed by means of ex-
panded definition.

The core of investigative reports—-statements of
problem——can always be handled as definitions. The
writer places the subject of the problem in a class of
problems and distinguishes it from all other members of
the class. For example:

The purpose of this test was to determine the

effectiveness of the computer in receiving range

input data and transmitting correct elevation

to the gun.

Communicating

Ideas

BY PROF. D. MARDER

The purpose of the test is actually the problem, and the
subject is the computer. The class of the problem is
determination of effectiveness, and the rest of the state-
ment isolates the particular problem from all other de-
terminations of effectiveness for this particular com-
puter.

The definition is then expanded to answer the other
introductory questions. The background tells the
reader why the problem exists. The limits of the prob-
lem tells the reader to what extent the problem will be
pursued, and the plan of the report tells the reader how
the problem will be attacked.

The technique of expanding definition, however, is
not confined to investigative reports, nor to introductory
sections. It can be used, similarly, in all papers and in
some, as a major system for organizing the entire work.

TO DEFINE a word, we fence it in.

Comparison and contrast, another method of ex-
panding definition, is really a special type of illustration
in which the unfamiliar is compared with the familiar
and the likenesses and differences are pointed out. Com-
paring a radar set-up with a radio-transmitter set-up
might very well bring out the essential meaning of ra-
dar.

One type of comparison——the analogy—renders
understanding by focusing attention on the similar
qualities of things which are not essentially alike. Sleep
can be explained by analogy to death though it is a part
of life; the sound barrier is analogous to a wall, in that
it physically resists penetration.

ANALYSIS CAN BE USED to tell what steps comprise
a process, what ‘Functional parts make up a device, or
what constituents con.pr-ise. a substance.

2‘ ., - s 

-. .}/a_

One method of expanding definition is explication.
This is the application of more definition to explain the
unfamiliar terms used in the formal definition. For in-
stance, this definition for a dynatron——“a multielectrode
vacuum tube in which the secondary emission of elec-
trons from the plate result in a decrease in the plate
current as the plate voltage increases”— could be ex-
panded by explication of the terms, secondary emission,
plate, plate current, voltage increase. For completeness
and clarity, however, we need to know the whole process
of its working, its essence. Why does the secondary emis-
sion from the plate result in decreased plate current as
the plate voltage increases? To answer this question, the
writer might need to analyse the whole.

A second method of expanding definition, then, is
analysis—the process of dividing the whole, whether
concept, procedure or object, into its parts, then ex-
plaining or describing each part and showing its re-
lationship to the whole. Analysis can be used to tell what
steps comprise a process, what functional parts make up
a device, or what constituents comprise a substance.

We see that description, a third tool for expanding
definition, usually accompanies anaylsis. It helps to show
the relations of part to part and part to whole by an-
-swering such questions as “What are its qualities, what
does it look like, feel like, what capacity does it have?”
In the definition of a missile for example, or a problem
concerning the missile, analysis would provide a break-
down into the essential parts and then description would
be employed in giving each part and of the assembled
vehicle.

Illustration, a fourth means of expanding definition,
can aid the description. It brings an abstraction down to
a firm foundation quicker than any other method. Used
in combination with other techniques, it gives an ex-
ample of the thing being defined. Good descriptions
can often be composed about an illustration, either ver-

bal or graphic.

MAY I960

IN A COMPARISON of compiicated things, the reader is
not expected to carry in his mind all the details of the
first item and then apply them when the same details
are analyzed in the second item.

Elimination—another method—expands actually
by confining. It tells what something is not before telling
what it is. The writer clears the air of misconceptions at
the outset and eases the following burden of positive
definition.

Some concepts can only be indirectly defined by
explaining~ their causes and effects, especially those
about which we know little, i. e. cancer, cosmic rays,
gravity. The structure for such expanded definitions
would be an analysis in which causes would be parts of
a certain effect, or effects would be parts of a certain
cause. The definition of a problem, can be expanded
into its background. by showing why the problem exists
—that is, analysing its causes.

A final method is derivation, which helps define by
explaining the original meanings of roots.

19

An expanded definition may proceed from the for-
mal definition, which would be a -general statement of
"meaning, and then it might explicate analyse, describe,
illustrate, compare. This "procedure would correspond
to deductive reasoning. The procedure can be reversed.
Beginning with an illustration,, comparision, analogy,
orpsome other method of expansion, the writer can build
the particulars together and then conclude his section, or
paper with a generalization which is the formal defi-
nition. This procedure corresponds to inductive reason-
ing.

Though whole papers can be developed with ex-
panded definition, it is most useful in the organization of
the beginning. In developing and ending parts of the
report, or paper, some of the techniques used in expand-
ed definition are employed as the major tools of argani-
zation. The most useful organization patterns for the
middle and end parts are classification and analysis.
“Science,” according to one definition, “is the branch of
study concerned with the observation. and classification
of facts.” Even if this definition is true only in part, an
ability to classify appears to be as indispensable to the
technical writer as the ability to observe. Classification
is one kind of work performed on the observations. More
specifically, it is the method of arranging any collection
of objects, concepts or processes into groups to make
clear their similarities and differences.

In the process of definition, we saw that the term is
first classified, then differentiated. In classification,

groups rather than individual members are differenti-'

ated. Instead of isolating one compound for example, the

‘ classifier places it in its proper group of compounds ac-

cording to some common characteristic, such as size, use,
or special effect. This is a process of generalization.

Classification is a way of thinking systematically,
like expanded definition, can often give the over-all form
to an expository paper. A part of scientific research con-
sists of classifying experimental results and accumulated?
data, then relating the groups according to some charac-
teristic, and finally arriving at an over-all generalization,
or theory. Classification may be the heart of a technical‘
paper or it may form only some small section or even
a paragraph. Almost always it is combined with other
techniques.

The process of analysis is often confused with that
of classification. In many respects they are opposites.
Analysis‘ is the organizational tool for resolving a subject
into its component parts. Anything that has parts there-
fore can be analyzed, whether physical, such as a clock,
or conceptual, such as an organization. On paper, all
analysis is, of course, conceptual.

A bomb hitting a building would probably break the
whole into its parts, but we would not call that action
analysis, either physical or conceptual. Since analysis is
a method, it takes place according to design, or principle.
Objects, concepts and processes cannot be taken apart
according to a principle if they have been assembled ac-
cording to one. Only things which have structure can be

20

assembled according to one. Only things which have
structure can be analyzed and a thinghas structure
when its parts are assembled, not at random, but in some
organized fashion so that the parts bear some relation-
ship to each other. The pile of debris that the bombing
aircraft left in its wake was not a structure. A human
being, a truck, a religion, a textbook, a technical report
all have structures. They can all be analyzed because in
each of them some principle can be found to explain the
relationship of the parts. The pile of debris would first
have to be classified according to some criterion before
analysis could take place.

Analysis is a way of explaining the thing analyzed;
it answers the questions, “How is it put together? How
does it work?” It does so in combination with other tech-
niques, particularly description and narration. To ex-

»plain how a mechanism is put together, the writer

describes the mechanism within the framework of
analysis, that is, as a whole, then part by part. To ex-
plain how something works, the writer analyzes its
function in a time sequence and, therefore, narration as
well as description is used to render the breakdown, step
by step. To explain how one thing differs from another,
the writer uses the techniques of comparison where each
structure is divided into parts or steps in a parallel fash-
ion. Then, description and narration are employed to
4 compare them. Analysis, then can be regarded as a
framework for description and narration. O

Dick Ernsdorff studies a microwave site-layout chart atop a moun-
tain near Orting, in western Washington state. On assignments like
this, he often carries $25,000 worth of equipment with him.

 

Here, Dick checks line-of-sight with a distant repeater station by
mirror-ﬂashing and conﬁrms reception by portable radio. Using this
technique, reflections of the sun’s rays can be seen as far as 50 miles.

He wears two kinds of work tags

For engineer Richard A. Ernsdorﬁ", the “uniform of the
day” changes frequently. A Monday might ﬁnd him in a
checkered wool shirt on a Washington or Idaho mountain
top. Wednesday could be a collar-and-tie day.

Dick is a transmission engineer with the Paciﬁc Tele-
phone and Telegraph Company in Seattle, Washington. He
joined the company in June, 1956, after getting his B.S.E.E.
degree from Washington State University. “I wanted to
work in Washington,” he says, “with an established, grow-
ing company where I could ﬁnd a variety of engineering op-
portunities and could use some imagination in my work.”

Dick spent 21/3 years in rotational, on-the-job training,
doing power and equipment engineering and “learning the
business.” Since April, 1959, he has worked with micro-
wave radio relay systems in the Washington-Idaho area.

When Dick breaks out his checkered shirt, he’s headed

for the mountains. He makes ﬁeld studies involving micro-

problem that arises. He also engineers “radar remoting”
facilities which provide a vital communications link be-
tween radar sites and Air Force Operations.

A current assignment is a new 11,000 mc radio route
from central Washington into Canada, utilizing reﬂectors
on mountains and repeaters (ampliﬁers) in valleys. It’s a
million-dollar-plus project.

“I don’t know where an engineer could ﬁnd more inter-
esting work,” says Dick.

TIROS satellite orbiting towards ground station in Eastern United States.

RCA—BUILT “T|ROS" SATELLITE REPORTS
WORLD’S WEATHER FROM OUTER SPACE

As you read these lines, the most remarkable
“weather reporter” the world has ever known
hurtles around our globe many times a day,
hundreds of miles up in outer space.

The TIROS satellite is an orbiting television system.
Its mission is to televise cloud formations within a belt
several thousand miles wide around the earth and trans-
mit a series of pictures back to special ground stations.
Weather forecasters can then locate storms in the making

. to help make tomorrow’s weather forecast more
accurate than ever.

The success of experimental Project TIROS opens the
door to a new era in weather forecasting—with beneﬁts to
people of all lands. This experiment may lead to advanced
weather satellites which can provide weathermen with hour-
by-hour reports of cloud cover prevailing over the entire
world. Weather forecasts, based on these observations, may
then give ample time to prepare for ﬂoods, hurricanes,
tornadoes, typhoons and bl2'.z.zards—tz'me which can be used
to minimize damage and save lives.

Many extremely “sophisticated” techniques and de-
vices were required to make Project TIROS a success—
two lightweight satellite television cameras, an infra-red

22

horizon-locating system, complex receiving and trans-
mitting equipment, and a solar power supply that collects
its energy from the sun itself. In addition to the design
and development of the actual satellite, scientists and
engineers at RCA’s “Space Center” were responsible
for the development and construction of a vast array
of equipment for the earth-based data processing and
command stations.

Project TIROS was sponsored by the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration. The satellite pay-
load and ground station equipment were developed and
built by the Astro-Electronic Products’ Division of RCA,
under the technical direction of the U. S. Army Signal
Research and Development Laboratory.

The same electronic skills which made possible the
success of man’s most advanced weather satellite are em-
bodied in all RCA products—RCA Victor black 8? white
and color television sets, radio and high-ﬁdelity systems
enjoyed in millions of American homes.

How Inco Nickel is helping develop

the new gas turbine car of tomorrow

It will be power-packed: the gas turbine
engine in your dream car of the future
and tomorrow’s trucks and buses.
Only one spark plug-
runs on kerosene

This new engine is much lighter, smaller.
It has far fewer parts. No pistons. No water
system. Only one spark plug. Runs on
lower-grade fuels.

Not yet in production!
Before the car is a showroom reality, engi-
neers face a number of problems.

One problem—-the one Inco is helping with
——is metals. Strong and economical metals
to resist heat and corrosion.

Gas turbines operate at up to 1600°F. These
temperatures step up corrosion of metals,
promote troublesome distortions. So the
job is to develop practical alloys able to
carry the load—alloys that can, at the same
time, offset the corrosives, resist the distort-
ing forces found at jet-high temperatures.

How far has Inco research gone

in its search for practical alloys?
Difficult as they are, the problems of metal
performance at high temperature are a

dealt with them for years. And come up
with solutions in the gas turbine and in
many other ﬁelds. In conventional, atomic,

In heat treating. In jet aviation. In mis-
silry. Even in Hollywood's 8000°F carbon-
arc “suns.”

ning horizontal rotor, which holds the craft aloft in flight,
will allow the craft to be lowered gently to the ground.

When the operator moves on the ground, the rotor
remains motionless in a position parallel to the direction
of travel. The small propeller behind the drivers seat pro-
vides enough thrust for forward speeds of up to 30 miles
per hour. In the air, the Gyrocopter cruises at 50 miles-
per hour with a top speed of 80 miles per hour.

LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT

The gas turbine has a high power to weight ratio that has
proved practical in, among other things, portable fire
pump assemblies and auxiliary power units for aircraft.

Important to the overall operation of lightweight gas
turbine'engines are forged rotors. Inside the turbine, hot
gases are directed at the rotor, which converts this energy
into shaft power to perform work. Since the operation of
these engines becomes more efficient as temperatures are
increased, component materials must have high strength
at high temperatures.

Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation has developed
such a material for its complex-shaped high temperature
superalloy called A-286. This alloy is strengthened by an
aging treatment known as precipitation hardening. It de-
velops its best properties in the temperature range of 1200
to 1500 degrees farenheit.

MODEL OF JUNGHANS-ROSSI CON-
TINUOUS CASTING MACHINE.

Casting

BY WILLIAM HOSICK, MET E ’63

Continuous casting, the producing of semi—finished
products directly from liquid metal, has been of great
interest to engineers and metallurgists for at least a
century. Although several continuous casting techniques
have been patented and have proven workable, one of
the most successful was developed during the early
l930’s in Germany. This Junghans-Rossi process was
originally applied to the brass industry and soon spread
to most of the non-ferrous industries where it proved
itself on a wide commercial scale. However, higher
temperatures, lower thermal conductivity, and slower
solidification rates make steel much more difficult to
continuously cast than the non-ferrous metals. It was not
until 1949 that the first successful attempts were made
to apply the process to the casting of steel, and only in
the last few years has continuous casting of steel on a
wide commercial scale neared reality.

Several types of continuous casting machines are
presently in use, differing essentially in mold design and
mounting. Most of the continuous casting plants that
are operating on a commercial scale, however, are using
the Junghans-Rossi type machine. The steel is tapped
from the furnaces into conventional refractory-lined
ladles which have been preheated to approximately 1400
degress farenheit. The ladles are then transported to the
base of the continuous casting machine by electrically
driven cars and hoisted by cranes into pouring position
at the top of the machine, 31 feet above floor level.
Normal elapsed time from the furnace to casting
position is ten minutes.

The molten metal is poured into a tundish which has
been preheated to 2500 degress farenheit. This tundish
is a two~compartment refractory lined box which has
been especially designed to deliver a slag-free, low

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

+~_ ..“~ '\T

velocity, precisely positioned stream to the mold below.
The rear compartment of the tundish receives the
molten metal and a dam holds back any slag or foreign
material. The front compartment of the tundish con-
tains a nozzle through which a uniform flow of metal is

directed into the mold.
The mold, cast from a solid block of oxygen-free,

high conductivity copper, is designed with a number of
internal water-cooling passages that are connected by
rubber hoses to the water source and to the plant sewer
system. This high velocity water flow permits maximum
heat transfer at the mold faces. The inside face of the
mold is carefully polished prior to each use to prevent
seizure of the metal during casting. The mold has small
outlets around its entire top surface through which
regulated quantities of rapeseed oil are passed during
casting. The oil runs down the walls of the mold and act
as a lubricant for the solidifying casting shell as it moves
down through the mold.

In preparation for casting, a dummy bar extending
from the lower set of pinch rolls up into the bottom of
the mold is insert-ed in the machine. To prevent metal
leakage, asbestos rope is packed into the space between
the mold walls and the dummy bar. The flow of coolant
water and lubricant oil are started when the metal be-
gins to flow into the mold. An atmosphere of propane
gas is maintained at all times around the molten metal
leaving the tundish and around the metal in the mold.
This minimizes oxidation of the metal.

When the mold is filled to within three inches of the
top, the pinch rolls are activated to withdraw the par-
tially solidified casting. At the same time the mold as-
sembly begins a synchronized oscillation of about 3/4
inch. It moves downward at the same speed of the billet
that is being cast, but returns at a speed of three times
its downward motion. The pinch roll speed and mold
oscillation are controlled by an operator and can vary
from 1 inch to 178 inches per minute.

The billet passes through a spray chamber located
immediately below the operating floor. In this chamber
the billet passes through 29 banks of nozzles which spray
water around its entire periphery and effect substantial-
ly complete solidification. All of the spray equipment is
housed in a watertight enclosure with a vapor exhause
system and discharge ducts for water.

The billet then passes through the pinch rolls to -the
cutting chamber. Here two oxyacatylene torches,
mounted on a hydraulically operated carriage, move
downward with the casting and cut the continuously
cast billet to the required length. The torches then
return to their original position to begin the next cut.
After a length is severed, it is cradled and lowered into
a discharge pit, then removed by conveyor table to be
weighed and piled.

Continuous casting has both economical and metal-

lurgical advantages over ingot casting. There is

definitely a savings in metal-. In ingot casting it is neces-
sary to crop the top and bottom of each ingot, while
continuous casting allows a considerable reduction in
this waste, for a piece must be cropped only at the

An economy is realized in the elimination of many of
the pouring pit costs and elimination of some ingot
processing operations to arrive at a similar sized product.

Reduced labor is another advantage, since surprising-
ly few men are required to operate the machine. A mini-
mum of three men per turn are required to operate the
machine: one furnace operator, one machine operator,
and one torch operator for cutting off the casting to
desired lengths.

If the initial expense of the mill is considered, a tre-
mendous financial benefit can be realized. A convention-
al plant with a million tons per year capacity would
require soaking pit and blooming mill facilities costing
$16,000,000 or about $16.00 per yearly ton. Compara-
tively, a continuous casting plant capable of producing
115,000 tons per year has been placed in operation with
an investment of $750,000 or about $6.50 per yearly
ton.

Metallurgically, casting into relatively small cross
sections gives the advantage of solidification at the
fastest possible rate. This minimizes many present-day
difficulties, such as grain size control, segregation and
lack of uniformity. Continuously cast steels also have
good cleanliness and such non-metallic inclusions as are
encountered are more evenly distributed than in ingot
cast steels. Also, central porosity is negligible, and sur-
faces are good.

Apart from the economical and metallurgical aspects,
a further advantage is decentralization of industry. In
wartime, this would certainly be of great importance to
national defense.

There are, however, several disadvantages of con-
tinuous casting of steel. The major disadvantage is that
the continuous casting machine cannot handle the
large heat sizes produced by modern open-hearth
furnaces. By the Junghans-Rossi process, casting speeds
of 30 tons per hour are possible when casting slabs with
a cross-section of .150 square inches or larger. This cast-
ing rate is adequate for the casting of high alloys, but
certainly not for carbon steel produced by open—hearth
furnaces with capacities of 275 tons. It is not a reason-

28

FINISHED SLAB IS DEPOSITED on table equipped with
drag chain which slides slab to a pickup cradle.

able solution to have a series of casting machines running
only for short periods of time, because the best utiliza-
tion of continuous casting is to run continuously on a
24-hour basis.

A distinct metallurgical disadvantage occuring with
all grades of steel cast, is the presence of small sub-
surface gas holes, presumed to be from hydrogen. They
are most troublesome with austenitic stainless steels,
necessitating additional grinding and reducing yields.
Their precise source has not been ascertained.
Another disadvantage is the continuous research that
must be undertaken in order to cast different types of
steel. For continuous casting processes are not such that
it is possible to obtain facts concerning one type of steel
and apply them to other types. It is necessary to experi-
ment with each different type and variations within
that type. Thus it is very costly, difficult and time-
consuming to establish standards and train personnel.

Presently, there are over 30 continuous steel casting
machines in operation in England, Europe, Russia,
Japan, Canada, and the United States, and at least 20
of these are operating on a commercial basis. The
quality of this steel is good, but the tonnage leaves
much to be desired. In the not too distant future, con-
tinuous casting may entirely replace conventional ingot
casting in works with outputs up to 300,000 tons per
year, with considerable savings in investment and op-
erational costs. Undoubtedly, continuous casting will
soon be used in existing mills where the primary mill
cannot handle the increasing output from the melting
shop. Continuous casting can easily surmount this diffi-
culty by casting a portion of the production directly into
semi-finished products. Continuous casting may never
completely replace ingot casting in the steel industry
but it certainly has proven itself feasible for small scale
commercial production and on this basis, is here to stay.

SATURN;

BY MICHAEL RAY, AE ’62

The obj-ective of PROJECT SATURN is to provide
by 1963-1964 an efficient and reliable system for lifting
multi-ton loads into high orbit around the earth and
into deep space. The SATURN research vehicle, boosted
upward by the most powerful rocket engine package
ever assembled in America, and carrying the heaviest
instrumented payload ever attempted, will be launched
from Cap-e Canaveral, Florida. The SATURN PRO-
JECT is being carried out for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA).

The SATURN PROJECT was initiated in August,
1958. The first booster flights, with dummy upper
stages, are scheduled for the 1961-62 period. The
SATURN orbiting or escape payload capability, which
will require a three or four stage vehicle, will be avail-
able in 1963-64. One possible configuration, using a
modified Glenn L. Martin Co. “Titan” first stage and
a modified Convair-Pratt & Whitney, “Centaur” rocket
as second and third stages respectively, would weigh
approximately 580 tons at liftoff, of which about 500
tons would be propellant fuels and oxidizers. It would
stand about 200 feet tall, nearly one-half as high as the
Washington Monument. Later considerations have re-
sulted in many other possible configurations. Final se-

lection of the configuration of the upper stages has not
been determined.

The vehicles will use an all-inertial guidance system.
This system will automatically give corrective signals
necessary to compensate for deviation resulting from
loss of thrust should one of the first stage booster en-
gines fail to function.

A special system employing parachutes and retro-
rockets is being developed to enable recovery of the
first stage booster for post-flight inspection and possible
further use.

The SATURN system will answer the nation’s need
for a relatively inexpensive, extremely high-thrust
booster capable of lifting into satellite orbit or outward
to space journeys a multi-ton load of instrumentation.

The SATURN vehicle will have a super-booster with
1,500,000 pounds of thrust, plus upper stages. The
booster uses a grouping of eight H-.1 liquid propellant
engines, an improved version of the “Jupiter” and
“Thor’ ’engines. Each engine has a thrust of 188,000
pounds. Total thrust of the clustered engines will be
equivalent to 30,000,000 horsepower. Rocketdyne
Division of North American Aviation is supplying the
basic H-1 engines. The cluster concept was chosen

MAY I960

because of the proven reliability of the existing engine.
Dr. Wernher Von Braun, as director of the Development
operations division and Robert Lindstrom, project en-
gineer for the SATURN, have guided the activity that
will give America its mightiest booster.

SATURN will come as a giant among rocket re-
search vehicles. With upper stages, it will be more than
twice the height of the Army “Jupiter C”, which sent
the “Explorer” satellite aloft, and the “Juno II” which
sent the “Pioneer IV” probe into orbit around the sun.
The thrust of the booster alone will be more than four
times that of the “Atlas.”

MOCK-UP OF THE TAIL SECTION of the Saturn booster
illustrates the relative size of the complete booster.

The SATURN engines are profiting by the ten-year
development period on the “Redstone,” “Jupiter,”
“Thor,” and “Atlas,” engines. Continual analysis of the
static test firing reports of these engines have permitted
design of the H-1 to eliminate possible trouble spots and
improvement of other components.

Each of the eight H-1 engines comprising the
SATURN cluster operates independently with its own
gas generator and turbopump. The propellant tankage
supplying liquid oxygen and RP-1 fuel is a common
source for all eight engines.

Directional stability of the entire missile will be main-
tained by swiveling the four outer engines of the cluster.
These engines will be mounted on gimbals, which is a
part of their assembly, and will be moved by struts
actuated by the guidance equipment of the space vehicle.

The H-1 engine is considerably more compact than
companion “Jupiter” and “Thor” engines. Modification
of existing “Thor” and “Jupiter” engines to provide the
new H-1 engine for use in the SATURN space vehicle
consisted primarily of repackaging components to

31

achi-eve a compact grouping within the booster frame.
For example, the turbopump is now slung side-saddle
on the thrust chamber as contrasted with its former
position atop the chamber.

Safety devices have been built into the engine—an
added fac-tor in manned flight. One of the safety factors
is the asurance that all eight engines of the cluster
must be functioning normally before the missile can be
released. Hypergolic ignition (self-igniting) will further
increase the reliability of the H-1.

The individual H-1 engine used in the propulsion
system develop thrust from the propulsive gases created
by the combustion of liquid oxygen and RP-1, a hydro-
carbon fuel similar to that used in turbo-jet engines.
Combustion within the thrust chamber occurs at tem-
peratures above 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The walls of
the thrust chambers are form-ed of thin, light weight
metal through which fuel is forced at high speed. The
fuel flow acting in the same manner as liquid within a
pot on an oven burner, prevents the metal from melting
under the extremely high temperatures encountered.

AERIAL VIEW OF 175-FOOT STATIC TEST STAND at
ABAMA, Redstone Arsenal, which is now being modified
to accomodate the Saturn program. A Jupiter IRBM is
resting on the left side of the test srtand.

“Jupiter” and other ballistic missiles, are utilized in the
H-1 engine to draw the propellants from the storage
tanks and force them at high flow rates into the com-
bustion chamber.

In its first voyage, SATURN will not seek out new
seas. It will journey in voids already penetrated by the
“Explorers,” the “Discoverers,” the “Vanguards,” and

32

the “Pioneers.” The difference will be the increased
payload-capabilities of SATURN. Previous assaults on
space have been lonely, isolated ventures, seeking in-
formation hurriedly, then retreating to earth or vanish-
ing forever. SATURN, in comparasion, will be a gigan-
tic expedition, one made possible by its booster package,
the most powerful unit of controlled energy ever brought
to flight status.

Success will mark a new peak in rocket engine tech-
nology, and the first movement of the booster package
from the Arsenal down to the launch site at the Atlantic
Missile Range, Cape Canaveral, Florida. Several means
of transporting the gigantic booster are being considered.
In one of these, the booster may move by water along
the Tennessee River, which forms one boundary of the
Arsenal, down to the Mississippi River and then to the
Gulf of Mexico. It would travel southward along the
western coast of Florida, around the southern tip of
the peninsula and then head northward along the
eastern coast to the man-made harbor at Cape Canaver-
al where the booster would mate with its upper stages.

SATURN will be able to put up heavy low-level
satellites, high-level communication satellites, and deep
space probes. A satellite, with a multi-ton payload, could
be placed 22,000 miles over the equator, moving east-
ward in orbit, so that, as viewed from earth it would
appear to be stationary. The satellite would have in
view 38.2% of the earth’s surface, an area of approxi-
mately seventy-five million square miles.

Eleven ton satellites placed in 300-mile orbits about
the earth could scan cloud formations and open up an
entirely new spectrum in weather prediction; the same
satellite could provide the basis for all-weather, long-
term navigational systems. It is not inconceivable that
a satellite could someday supplant the North Star in
navigational favor, offering day-and-night service as
contrasted with the night-only of the North Star. A
satellite, filled to capacity with the instrumentation
payload permitted by the gigantic SATURN booster,
could bring about a new era in geodesy, realigning the
grid marks of the world, perhaps inching Europe closer
to America, or dropping Africa to a new position on the
globe. The moon could also be an object of a SATURN
boosted exploration. The SATURN booster would be
able to send about a ton to the surface of the moon,
several hundred pounds of which could make a return
trip to earth, if desired.

Venus, 26,000,000 miles from earth, and Mars,
34,600,000 miles away, could be explored by an un-
manned satellite weighing nearly one thousand pounds,
shoved outward by the SATURN booster. If a landing
is desired, a package could streak through the dense
clouds of_ Venus and instrumentation be deposited.

The weight-lifting capability of a 1,500,000 pound
thrust booster such as SATURN would permit a myriad
of electrical systems. If one or two of the systems fail,
others would continue to function, overcoming the
heartbreaking disappointments encountered in earlier
space missions where the failure of a small component
wiped out the entire effort. Q

E. l. DISBROW
Tri-Stale College, Angola, Ind. '51

ED DISBROW exempliﬁes the opportunity to grow with a young,
growing company. Now District Manager of the Dunham-Bush Minne-
apolis oﬂice, he supervises widespread engineering activities of a group
of sales engineers representing a multi-product technical line.

Engineering degree in hand, Ed went to work for Heat-X (a Dunham-
Bush subsidiary) as an Application Engineer. Successive steps in the
Dunham-Bush main oﬂice and as Sales Engineer in the New York
territory brought him to his present managerial capacity.

A member of Belle Aire Yacht Club, Ed leads a pleasant life aﬂoat
and ashore with his wife and two boys.

Equally satisfying is Ed’s job. In directing calls on consulting engi-
neers, architects, plant engineers, wholesalers, contractors and building
owners, he knows he’s backed by the extensive facilities of Dunham-
Bush laboratories. You can see him pictured above on a typical call,
inspecting a Minnesota shopping center Dunham-Bush air conditioning
installation.

Ed’s success pattern is enhanced by the wide range of products he
represents. For Dunham-Bush refrigeration products run from com-
pressors to complete systems; the range of air conditioning products
extends from motel room conditioners to a hospital’s entire air condi-
tioning plant. The heating line is equally complete: from a radiator
valve to zone heating control for "an entire apartment housing project.
The Dunham-Bush product family even includes highly specialized heat
transfer products applicable to missile use.

Photography
at Work

with you.

From the time a scientist’s mind ﬁrst
sparks an idea for exploring space,
photography gets to work with him. It
saves countless hours in the drafting
stage by reproducing engineers’ plans
a-nd drawings. It probes the content
and structure of metals needed by
photomicrography, photospectrography
or x-ray diffraction. It checks the opera-
tion of swift-moving parts with high-
speed movies—records the ﬂight of the
device itself—and ﬁnally, pictures what
it is in space the scientist went after in
the ﬁrst place.

There’s hardly a ﬁeld on which you
can set your sights where photography
does not play a part in producing a
better product or in simplifying work
and routine. It saves time and costs in
research, in production, in sales and
in office routine.

So in whatever you plan to do,
take full advantage of all of the ways
photography can help.

CAREERS WITH KODAK:
With photography and photographic proc-
esses becoming increasingly important in the
business and industry of tomorrow, there
are new and challenging opportunities at
Kodak in research, engineering, electronics,
design, sales, and production.

opportunity, write for information about

Several surveys indicate that salary is
not the primary contributor to job
satisfaction. Nevertheless, salary con-
siderations will certainly play a big
part in your evaluation of career op-
portunities. Perhaps an insight into the
salary policies of a large employer of
engineers like General Electric will
help you focus your personal salary
objectives. '

Salary——a most individual and per-
sonal aspect of your job—is difﬁcult to
discuss in general terms. While recog-
nizing this, Mr. Case has tried answering
as directly as possible some of your
questions concerning salary:

G Mr. Case, what starting salary does
your company pay graduate engineers?

A Well, you know as well as I that
graduates’ starting salaries are greatly
inﬂuenced by the current demand for
engineering talent. This demand es-
tablishes a range of “going rates” for
engineering graduates which is no doubt
widely known on your campus. Be-
cause General Electric seeks outstand-
ing men, G-E starting salaries for these
candidates lie in the upper part of the
range of “going rates.” And within
General Electric’s range of starting sal-
aries, each candidate’s ability and
potential are carefully evaluated to de-
termine his individual starting salary.

Q How do you go about evaluating
my ability and potential value to your
company?

A We evaluate each individual in the
light of information available to us:
type of degree; demonstrated scholar-
ship; extra-curricular contributions; work
experience; and personal qualities as
appraised by interviewers and faculty
members. These considerations deter-
mine where within G.E.’s current sal-
ary range the engineer’s starting salary
will be established.

One of a series

Interview with

General Electric’s Byron  Case
Manager_Employee Compensation Service

Your Salary

at General Electric

Q When could I expect my first salary
increase from General Electric and how
much would it be?

A Whether a man is recruited for a
speciﬁc job or for one of the principal
training programs for engineers——the
Engineering and Science Program, the
Manufacturing Training Program, or
the Technical Marketing Program—his
individual performance and salary are
reviewed at least once a year.

For engineers one year out of col-
lege, our recent experience indicates a
ﬁrst-year salary increase between 6 and
15 percent. This percentage spread re-
ﬂects the individual’s job performance
and his demonstrated capacity to do
more difﬁcult work. So you see, salary
adjustments reflect individual perform-
ance even at the earliest stages of
professional development. And this
emphasis on performance increases
as experience and general competence
increase.

Q How much can I expect to be making
after five years with General Electric?

A As I just mentioned, ability has a
sharply increasing inﬂuence on your
salary, so you have a great deal of per-
sonal control over the answer to your
question.

It may be helpful to look at the cur-
rent salaries of all General Electric
technical-college graduates who re-
ceived their bachelor’s degrees in 1954
(and now have ﬁve years’ experience).
Their current median salary, reﬂect-
ing both merit and economic changes,
is about 70 percent above the 1954
median starting rate. Current salaries
for outstanding engineers from this

class are more than double the 1954
median starting rates and, in some
cases, are three or four times as great.

Q What kinds of benefit programs
does your company offer, Mr. Case?

A Since I must be brief, I shall merely
outline the many General Electric em-
ployee beneﬁt programs. These include
a liberal pension plan, insurance plans,
an emergency aid plan, employee dis-
counts, and educational assistance pro-
grams.

The General Electric Insurance Plan
has been widely hailed as a “pace
setter” in American industry. In addi-
tion to helping employees and their
families meet ordinary medical expen-
ses, the Plan also affords protection
against the expenses of “catastrophic”
accidents and illnesses which can wipe
out personal savings and put a family
deeply in debt. Additional coverages in-
clude life insurance, accidental death

 All AROUND YOU!

The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
But there is quite another kind of “space” close at hand, a kind that will always
challenge the genius of man.

This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
distance between them . . . the kind of space found between mainland and off-
shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply
base, between the site of a mountain crash and a waiting ambulance—above all,
. _-_ - Sikorsky is concerned with the precious “spaceway” that currently exists be-
tween all earthbound places.

Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
aircraft conﬁgurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-
hicles that can prove to be tomorrow’s most versatile means of transportation.

Here, then, is a space age challenge to be met with the ﬁnest and most practical
engineering talent. Here, perhaps, is the kind of challenge you can meet.

Outstanding performers never go unnoticed

F YOU have real ability, the coach or team manager will
I recognize it because they are constantly on the lookout
for potential star performers.

And so it goes at Koppers. Let’s say we hire you. We
give you an assignment and a chance to show your stuff.
We watch you. We evaluate your ability, your potential.
But we don’t judge you solely on one job. We move you
around.

You ﬁnd the work stimulating, challenging, interesting.
In time, you show us how versatile you are.

And what happens? You move up. Up in prestige, up in
responsibility, up in compensation.

If you’re young—so much the better. The seniority of
others won’t hold you back. If you have ability, we’ll know
it. And you’ll know we know it!

Are you an engineer? How would you like to do research
in plastics, ﬁne chemicals, jet engine sound .control——or

MAY I960

perhaps work with vat dyes, antioxidants, electro-static
precipitators, or—well you can almost name your subject.
We’re that diversiﬁed.

Maybe your forte is administration, product develop-
ment, marketing or sales. Whatever it is, you’ll ﬁnd it at
Koppers. But ﬁrst, you’ve got to let us know about you.
Why not write to the Manager of Manpower Planning,
Koppers Company, Inc., Pittsburgh 19, Pennsylvania. Or,
see your College Placement Director and arrange an ap-
pointment with a Koppers representative _for the next re-
cruiting visit. ’

A Message
From fhe Dean

THE GAP

For many years to come, the engineers will find it necessary to explain
and, in some cases, defend their educational background. The reason for this
is that a great many people who were educated in the Liberal Arts tradition did
not come in contact with the sciences and thus do not understand either the
objectives of the scientist or engineer. As a matter of fact, a great many scientists
do not fully understand the relationship between the sciences to engineering.

All of this leads to the assumption on the part of the Liberal Arts (and
often the Science) major that the engineer‘ is some sort of a. second-grade citizen
in educational circles. Unfortunately, the engineer is considered by many who
are completely ignorant of his education to be one who is skilled mainly in the
vocational arts. Even a fleeting glance at the engineering curriculum will prove
the fallacy of this concept.

All of this is a poor reward for those who have been required to take
some twenty per cent more credits for his B. S. degree than any other student
on the campus. It does little good to state to those persons in the “other” culture
that the engineer is a scientist -- that he has taken math. through calculus and
differential equations, chemistry, through organic and physics (in the case of the
chemical engineer) and three courses in physics. Mention of the engineering
sciences, such as Statics, Dynamics, Kinematics, Fluid and Mass Transfer, Thermo-
dynamics, Metallography, etc. just adds to the confusion. Little good it does to
indicate that many of these were once in the area of the fundamental or “pure”
sciences but were largely dropped by the scientists in their pursuit of sub-Inicro-
scopic phenomena. The engineer has carried on in the development of the sciences
of the macroscopic or the behavior of materials en masse.

Sir Charles P. Snow, formerly in charge of war-time scientific recruit-
ment in England and simultaneously one of Britains best known authors, points
out the gap that exists between scientists and engineers in his book “The Two
Cultures” and “The Scientific Revolution.” He indicates that in Britain the
scientists “wouldn’t recognize that many of the engineering problems were as
intellectually exacting as their own pure problems and that many of the solutions
were as satisfying and beautiful. Their instinct-perhaps sharpened in this country

By Dr. G. R. Fitterer

(England) by the passion to find a new snobbism whenever possible, and to
invent one if it didn’t exist - was to take it for granted that applied science
was an occupation for second-rate minds. We (the scientists) prided ourselves
that the science we were doing could not, in any conceivable circumstances have
any practical use. The more one could make that claim, the more superior one
felt.”

Snow goes on to pointl out that it is time that the Western World recog-
nize the tremendous importance of the engineer in the Scientific Revolution which
has started all over the world. He pleads with the scientist and liberal arts grad-
uates as well, to become better acquainted with the engineering profession be-
cause complete cooperation is necessary to win the international race ahead.

Meanwhile it remains for the engineer to not make the same mistake
in reverse. All through his life he should continually keep in touch with the
development of science and to learn as much as pozsible about the development
in the Liberal Arts and Humanities. Is it not possible that the developments
of some of the social studies into true sciences might be the surprise of the
last half of this century.’

NOTI:'S

D uring the past year, SKY-
SCRAPER ENGINEER has pre-
sented articles on a wide variety of
subjects. Highly technical articles
such as “Supersonic Thunder”
“Melting Metals in Space”, and
“The Big Dish” have been inter-
spersed with articles of a more li-
beral nature. “Engineers as Ad-
ministrators”, Engineers and Econo-
mists”, and “First Job Jitters” are
examples of this later type article.

In this issue, the last one for this
school year SKYSCRAPER EN-
GINEER again presents an interest-
ing variety of articles.

Few pieces of machinery can take
on the air of beauty, speed and de-
pendability that can the sports car.
These cars and the sport they repre-
sent have been primarily designed
and raced by Europeans. Joe Seifried
presents his views on why the Ameri-
cans have not entered into sports car
competition to any great extent and
exactly what makes the European
cars the outstanding machines they
are. Joe drives his own MG and is
an officer in one of the local sports
car clubs. His broad knowledge in
the realm of sports cars can be seen
in his article “Designs For Power”.

Scientific discoveries have often
resulted in large scale industrial
growth. Such is. the case with infra-
red where recent military applica-
tions of this phenomenon have re-
sulted in a new million dollar in-

MAY I960

Prof. Marder

dustry. John Manton, director of
Flame Research, Inc., explains the
phenomenon and tells of some of
the applications of infra-red “Heat
Seekers”.

Venus and Mars will be the tar-
gets for new space probes powered
by the SATURN engines. SATURN
consists of a cluster of eight engines,
which develop over one million
pounds of thrust. Michael Ray dis-
cusses the design and manufacture
of this cluster of engines in “Saturn;
Booster into Space.”

Recently many innovations have
been-made in the steel industry in
an effort to speed-up the produc-
tion of steel. One of the more imagi-
native of these innovations has been
the development of continuous cast-
in-g processes. Bill Hosick describes
the process and explains the metal-
lurgical differences between steel
made by this process and the con-
ventional type processes in “Con-
tinuous Casting.”

The ability to express one’s
thoughts on paper is an attribute es-
sential to the successful engineer.
Professor Daniel Marder, head of
the University’s Technical Writing
Course provides Pitt’s engineers with
the essentials necessary to develop
the ability of technical expression.
In his article he supplements the
knowledge and ability gained in the
technical writing course by providing

interesting additional thoughts on,
“Communicating Technical Ideas.”
