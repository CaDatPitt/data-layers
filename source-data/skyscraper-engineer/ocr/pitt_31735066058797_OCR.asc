environment and our needs for improved quality of the
environment now and in the future. Of the one thousand
billion miles of travel on our highways every year, fully a third
are in pursuit of leisure-time activities. And for many, the
quality of these activities depends very heavily upon proper
environments and proper properties of those environments.
What people want to do is often in conflict. One cannot very
well take a leisurely stroll through the woods where hunters
are shotting deer. I would not advise it at any rate. Motor
boating stirs up the bottom sediments of our streams and does
little for the tranquility of the fisherman.

While no one can object to our stopping the flow of
oxides of sulphur into the atmosphere, let us not confuse each
an activity with the total problem. The broader problem
includes finding out something about human needs for quality
of the environment and devising engineering and other systems
that contribute to meeting those needs.

This is the kind of thinking upon which the
Environmental Systems Engineering Program rests. At the
same time that we take steps to meet immediate needs, we
need to improve our ability to define what the problems are,
we want to develop the kinds of systems capabilities that are
needed to help define the problems and to define alternative
solutions to the problems.

We want to be able to design alternative solutions, we
want to be able to evaluate alternative solutions, and we want
to be able to transfer the technology represented by such
problem solutions into use by society.

=l< * * >l< >l<

We have some resources and we lack some important
resources. Among the resources that we have are the interest
of and problem solving orientation of students and faculty,
systems engineering methodologies and techniques, traditional
interest in environmental questions in fields such as Civil, and
important knowledge in all fields of engineering. But we lack
three critical attributes.

For one thing, who is the client for problem solutions? All
of nature, which includes all of mankind, is a client, but this is
a bit general. One could starve to death looking for the place
where the pay checks are made out. Generally, we have either
failed to develop or only partially developed institutions in our
society which are sponsors for systems solutions to
improvements in our environment. We have many fragmented
institutions concerned with our environment and for many of
them concern is very limited. Let’s take a case by way of
illustration. We may attack the problem of providing suitable
environments for work, living, and recreation at the pressure
point of providing transportation systems that will make
variety of sites accessable. But transportation policy and
action programs are scattered among numberous government
agencies and private sector actors, and it would be difficult to
transfer a probelm solution from the drawing board to a
community.

So instead of "having, as most engineering fields do,
well-defined clients external to the school in which it can
relate, the Environmental Systems Engineering Program will
have to work to develop such clients, and it will have to wait a
while. But there is no logical reason why as we begin to see a
few things that we might be doing that they can’t be sold.

It might be mentioned that lack of a client for new
development is hardly limited to this subject area. Anything
new in an old field has to be sold to its existing clients or new
clients have to be found.

Apoint thatl shall mention brieﬂy is that conflict res-
olution looms large in the transfer of this kind of technology.
A system change is certain to help some folks more than

others, and it may even gore the oxes of some. So there is a
problem of getting conflicting groups to agree. When some are
helped and some are hurt, it is not always clear what we mean
by a desirable solution to a problem. This is a real problem,
experience may help us find solutions.

If we are to deal with large environmental systems, then it
is necessary that we have a capability for students to
manipulate systems, try out ideas, and be surprised by what
will happen if one changes one element of the system. To solve
this problem, we are developing a laboratory replete with the
proper kinds of information systems for working out
environmental systems problems and with the computer
support so that large systems may be manipulated. This kind
of laboratory development breaks new ground, but there is no
reason why it can’t be done and it is necessary.

>l‘- * * * *

These remarks give us a sense of priority for the
Environmental Systems Engineering Program and it suggests
what has to be done in order to develop an intellectually
exciting and useful program. Again, priority has to be given to
broad understandings of the environment so that individual
problems may be treated in the proper context. Priority has to
be given to the search for appropriate problem definitions and
the development of appropriate analysis tools for devising
solutions to those problems. Priority has to be given for
finding ways to transfer those problem solutions into practice.
At the same time that general capabilities are given priority, it
has to be recognized that crisis after crisis will have to be met.
So as we develop the broad capabilities, we must treat
individual problems as best we can and with the broadest
information that can be developed.

In addition, we must develop special capabilities to
transfer problem solutions to practice, and we must develop
special laboratory capabilities. '

The discussion to this point has been very general. To
narrow it, let me ask and answer seven questions that
succinctly summarize the What, Why, Where, and When of the
Program:

What subjects will be treated in the Program?

There will be: (1) a small core of courses dealing with
definition, design and modification of environmental systems,
including urban systems and (2) work in specialized areas
including: (a) environmental design and planning, (b)
transportation systems analysis, (c) water systems planning,
(d) urban and regional information systems, and (e) others as
rapidly as they can be evolved.

How will the Program affect students, undergraduate and
graduate?

The courses will be available to undergraduates and
graduates. Our first step — 1970-71 — will be opportunity for
specialization by Civil Engineering undergrads.

What is the objective of the Program?

To respond to needs for better definition of and improved
solutions for environmental systems problems; to involve such
problems in the education of students.

In what way is this an engineering program?

It is an extension of classical engineering to new problems.
Design of a bridge is an example of a classical engineering
problem. While it remains a challenging structural engineering
problem, today a bridge must be studied in the context of the
transportation system, urban and regional development, and of
its relations to the environment generally.

What intra- and extra-University relationships will the
Program have?

We have sought cooperation throughout the University.
There will be a laboratory which will have as one of its

And there are other functions of the laboratory?

The laboratory will also serve as an information and
documentation center. Effective work by students will require
that aids be available in the form of accessible information,
computer programs (for simulation of regional development,
for example), and documentation. The laboratory will provide
these basic services so that each student can work effectively
without having to start from scratch.

When will the Program be in full swing?

One course is being offered during 1969-70.
Undergraduate courses will be available during 1970-71, as will
the beginnings of the graduate programs.

91¢ * * >i= *

What does this mean for the student who wants to involve
himself in systems engineering work? While from the
standpoint of empire building it would be great to have many
students demanding many courses in this area, that would not
be wise either for the student or for the Program. The Program
will be a strong program only if it learns to use the resources in
the School of Engineering and in the University. It will be a
strong program only if it very carefully tailors its work in this
vast field. It must be based upon insights that cut through
complex technical, design, and systems issues and that provide
a basis for true professional work.

It would not be fair to the students to train them in a
field where truly productive employment is not now available,
but we would be derelict in our responsibilities to students if
we did not encourage their period of professional education.

The firms and other institutions within which graduating
students will find productive employment are changing and
will change over the years. Professionals must be prepared for
change and the lifelong learning that it requires.

So we will provide opportunities for students to work in
the environmental area in addition to the work that they do in
the regular departments. This will help prepare them for
change and new professional opportunities. Also, it will assist
in their roles as informed and responsible citizens. More and
more work will become available as time goes by and
opportunities for productive employment of students are
certain to increase.

An interesting aspect of the Environmental Systems
Engineering Program is that its development is somewhat
different from the development of traditional fields within the
University, and the Program may suggest some implications for
change in universities. The method of intellectual inquiry at
universities has emphasized reductionism as opposed to
synthesis. Remarkable progress has been made by dividing
problems and subject matter into smaller and smaller parts and
study of these parts through appropriate theories and
measurement techniques. Intellectual progress has been rapid
in those areas permissive of reductionism and permissive of
productive inquiry once reductionism was begun. Systems,
such as environmental systems, in which individual parts have
little meaning when treated alone have not lent themselves to
this type of study; resources were not allocated to them, and
they occupy minor niches in the totality of effort and of
knowledge.

A second point, intertwined with that above, is that
universities may be described as having grown somewhat more
than they have developed. Faculties of moral philosophy and
theology were subdivided as their parts could be recognized as
elements for fruitful inquiry anddialogue. The appropriate
descriptive is growth by division, with subdivision being guided
by whether or not inquiry was productive.

An additional element in growth was that of response to
societal conditions, particularly where societal conditions
shaped strong client—sponsors — e.g., the agriculturalization of
society created sets of university activities as did
industrialization, the expansion of governments, and health
needs. Numerous professional schools at the universities —
engineering, architecture, agriculture, social work, business,
law, and so forth — are university responses to these external
demands; universities, of course, havy played important roles
in shaping those external demands. It is important to note that
these units of the university have adopted styles of operation
similar to the styles of the faculties of moral philosophy and
theology, they have grown by subdividing and specializing.

Current perceptions of broad societal needs, together with
resultant needs to explore new kinds of knowledge, require
that the universities consider the reorganization of existing
modes of inquiry and teaching so that the emphasis upon
reductionism-analysis is complemented by emphases upon
broad systems analysis and synthesis.

This is one feature of our Program; our Program is one
test of the extent to which it can be done.

* * * * *

Our challenge is to broaden he capabilities of engineering
to respond to societal needs. We can do it, we will do it, and it
will be fun.

2) “Before” — the air-car in 1967.

3) “After” — the air-car in 1969.

 

The Rise and Fall

by Ed Saxman
Two and a half years ago, the M.E. department approached the
Student Branch of the Society of Automotive Engineers and
asked us if we had any interest in restoring an old air-car which

. was lying around taking up space in the M. E. Power Lab in

Thaw Hall. It had been literally in pieces since the last time
students had worked on it several years before. The
department was going to junk it if we "didn’t want it, so we
took a crack at its restoration.

The term “air-car” is a misnomer; more proper terms are
ground-effects machine, air-cushion vehicle, or hovercraft. The
principle is simple: air is pressurized into the space between
the machine and the ground, which exerts a force on the
underside of the machine. If the pressure is sufficient to lift it,
air leaks out under the bottom, and equilibrium is reached
between the incoming air and escaping air. You then have a
device ﬂoating on a cushion of air —- a “frictionless” surface.
This device may conceivably transport passengers or freight
and has certain very useful applications.

We found out the Pitt air-car was built in 1958 by Charles
Rhodes, an entepreneur from Irwin. As the story goes, he built
several of them with the intention of selling them to the Army

. . . but they didn’t want them. Neither did amusement parks,
so Mr. Rhodes finally gave this one to some technical school
who later gave it to Pitt. When Pitt got it in 1963, it had an
electric motor in the pressure duct, which limited the
machine’s range to the fifteen feet of the extension cord. This
electric motor was later traded to the original builder, Mr.
Rhodes, for a gasoline engine. But apparently the students
then working on it ran into some problems, lost interest, and
left it in pieces.

As we started to rebuild the air-car, we found out the
gasoline motor we “inherited” was a 1963 250 cc 2-stroke
Yamaha motorcycle engine, originally rated at 21 horsepower
at 7000 rpm. To adapt this engine to the air-car, it would have
to be turned on its side, with the lift propellor running directly
off the crankshaft in a horizontal plane. Several modifications
had already been made for us, most notably that of the
cylinder head finning. On a motorcycle, cooling air comes
from the front, and the head finning must be axially directed.
If this engine were to spin a propellor, air would be drawn
across the side, and the head fins would have to be
perpendicular to their original direction. Apparently Mr.
Rhodes, the original builder, cast his own aluminum cylinder
heads for these engines with this change, and he did such a
good job we didn’t notice the heads weren’t stock for weeks.
Also, an electric starter from a Honda had been grafted onto
the Yamaha, and the crankshaft had been splined to accept the
propellor.

The sideways mounting of the Yamaha engine required
the machining _of n<_ew_i_r1take manifold at 90° to the original, so
the ﬂoat mechanisms in the carburetors would work. It was
after we mounted the engine in the duct that we found out
what had deterred the previous group of students. The engine
rotates clockwise, and if the propellor were to rotate
clockwise, it would draw air upward. The machine wouldn’t
fly at all, though it might become the world’s largest suction
cup. Since the pitch of the propellor was fixed, we decided to
reverse the rotation of the engine. This may seem impossible,
but we managed it. With the kind cooperation of the E.E.

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER_APRlL. 1970

./V

II

of the SAE Aircar

department, the electric starter was re-wired to spin the motor
the other way. Since this is a two-stroke engine, intake and
exhaust valving is controlled by piston-exposed ports, on
which the direction of rotation of the crankshaft has no effect.
The ignition system was the next step: the centrifugal advance
was removed completely, since running backward would make
this a centrifugal retard. Then the points were timed to fire
slightly before the piston reached top dead center. Amazingly,
the engine fired on the first try, backwards, and can be run at
full throttle for as long as wanted without even fouling a plug.

For its size, an unmufﬂed two-stroke is easily the loudest
of all internal combustion engines, and the Yamaha was no
exception. Mufflers were necessary if we ever wanted to fly
this machine in a public place. A student donated two mufflers
from a BSA motorcycle, and with quite a bit of geometry we
managed to attach them to the engine down in the air duct.
Fuel and electrical systems were fabricated, and the rest of the
machine was assembled. We were now ready to fly the air-car.
Strap yourself in and we’ll go for a test ﬂight.

Open up the Yamaha, and you’ll find the machine lifts to
a steady-state height of about three inches. Balance yourself
carefully, or the air-car will lean or drag to one side. Now,
throttle up the reat thrust engine, and watch the whiplash: the
air-car will accelerate to a top speed of 10 mph in maybe 20 or
30 seconds. This phenomenal performance is traceable to the
lawnmower thrust engine in the rear, which puts out all of 11/2
hp.

Now, at speed, pull the rudder stick hard to one side, and
prepare for surprise number two: though the air-car changes
angles, it keeps ﬂoating along in the original direction. You
have to get it turned about 135° before one component of the
thrust begins to oppose your original direction while the other
starts to push you in your intended direction. In a style similar
to the four-wheel drift (or broadslide) of a car, you can make a
10 mph U-turn, though it takes nearly the full width of Pitt
stadium to do it.

On the other hand, if you are stopped, the machine can
pivot on its center axis. Braking is an all-or-none proposition:
throttle back on the thrust motor and you coast along forever;
throttle back the Yamaha lift engine and you grind to a stop
on the proverbial dime.

Street driving presents other problems: it will run away
down hills, crash into the curb on crowned roads, and due to
its limited thrust, won’t climb the slightest grade.

The SAE air-car’s big moment in history was the 1969
Engineer’s Week Parade, when it was entered as the M.E.
department’s “float.” All went well until it got to Fifth
Avenue, when it conked out right in front of the judges. Later
it was discovered that sediment had plugged up a carburetor.

Several modifications have been made in the past year,
including a fuel-line filter (after the fact). An 8 hp Honda S-9-
engine has been acquired to eventually replace the rear thrust
motor.

The air-car has been an interesting and worthwhile
engineering exercise for all concerned; it is hoped that it will
remain a part of the-M.E. department in the years to come. It
seems every year some new students “discover” the air-car,
become intrigued with it, and try to improve on its design,
before tiring of it and returning to their studies . . .

”Wanting more food from the

”Extracting food from the ocean in

”And most important, special

SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING GRADUAIINIE SENIORS

December 1, 1969

by

Morton Corn, Ph.D.

The intensity of national concern for the quality of our
environment has been increasing during the last few years.
There is no sign of deceleration in the near future. The
Congress has passed a Clean Water Act (1966) and an Air
Quality Act (1967); a Mine Safety Act will be passed by the
Congress during 1969. Hearings were held during November,
1969 on the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1969,
proposed legislation which will determine the physical
environment of in-plant facilities for the approximately 80
million work force in this Country. At the present time, there
is a host of proposed additional legislation to establish
standards for the environment in which we live and work.

I have been asked to speak to you today under the
directive of “introducing you to a new field of endeavor for
engineers.” I would like to attack this task by first speaking
about the traditional role of the engineer and the education he
receives to fulfill his role. Then let us look at future
educational requirements for engineers if the manpower needs
associated with engineering the environment are to be met.
Finally, I would like to brieﬂy look at current practice for
meeting engineering manpower needs in the areas of air and
water pollution abatement. How are engineers who have not
had the benefit of specialized education in environmental
engineering dealing with immediate problems?

The engineering education which I received and to a very

large extent, that which you received, was very pointedly

focussed on a kit of tools for solving problems in specific
industries. I think you have benefitted from a stronger
mathematical and science education than I received in high
school and as an undergraduate. However, engineering
education is still focussed on tools.

There has been a trend for at least ten years for very
complex industries to take upon themselves the training of
new engineers. Can the recent graduate of an engineering
program deal with air and water pollution problems, or for
that matter, with other problems of the environment, namely
urban problems or inplant problems, where a disastrous toll is
extracted every year in terms of the health and safety of the
working force? In my opinion, the answer to this question is
“No,” the engineer cannot handle these problems and I and
others who serve as consultants to industry, have more
problems brought to our attention than we can possibly
handle in these days of stringent legislative requirements for
the quality of the environment. The engineers who are doing
this work are learning the field very rapidly, but often do not
have a balanced picture of the problems. I would be the last to
suggest that engineering education at the undergraduate level
be altered to suit the needs of the environmental fields. There
is too much to be packed into the four year undergraduate
curriculum without adding additional courses needed to
orientate the student to the environment. However, I would
urge that a year of Master‘s training for practitioners in this
field be adopted, or that a five year engineering curriculum be
started which would give the students these additional
orientations.

20

What would be the subject matter of this year? The
engineer is not attuned to the broad factors which come into
play when he tries to utilize his tools on environmental
problems. When I was at Graduate School at Harvard, I had
only one “drag-out” fight with my principal advisor, Professor
Leslie Silverman. He insisted that I enroll in the business
school and take a personnel administration course taught by
the case study method. At that time Ihad little sympathy for
courses which were not strictly technical and was so angered
by this suggestion that I appealed to the Head of the
Department, Professor Philip Drinker, who, without hesitation
endorsed the idea.

At the first session an industrial case was presented to our
class of twelve and we were asked to analyze the situation. It
looked very simple and I submitted a solution after spending a
couple of hours on the problem. I was amazed to find that the
others in the class had also thought the problem simy‘e, but
that they each analyzed it in a different way. They brohfht to
the problem their own individual backgrounds. My point fiere
is that the engineer is not used to analyzing factors that are
involved in environmental problems. His solution of
environmental problems will have implications for the future
health of the community, as well as the present and future
social interactions and economic health of the community. In
addition to orientation with respect to the technical inputs in
the fields of, say, air and water pollution, this man must
understand urban planning in its broadest sense, inter-personal
relations (which includes some framework of sociology and
psychology), and the effects of the environment on the health
of the community. In the areas we are discussing the technical
solution is only the first step towards a solution of the
problem.

The faculties of some schools have been discussing
environmental studies and it has been interesting to watch the
Various educational approaches initiated on different
campuses. There has been a very active dialogue here at the
University of Pittsburgh and Dr. Garrison has joined the
engineering faculty to start graduate studies in environmental
problems with primary emphasis, as I understand it, on a
systems approach that would include many of the factors cited
above. There is very little financing for this type of
educational effort. The coming years will demonstrate just
how successful universities can be in changing traditional
programs in engineering to incorporate what is probably our
fastest growing field requiring not only traditional and new
engineering knowhow, but subject matter which is
untraditional in the engineering scheme of education.

Engineers have always worked with other engineers on
projects. In the fields that we are discussing, engineers work
with those trained in many other disciplines. In our courses at
the Graduate School of Public Health we try to restrict our
study of the environment to those with backgrounds in
physical and biological sciences or engineering. But we have,
on occasion, admitted biologists, economists, and there are
always physicians interested in these areas. One must learn to

work with these people, to appreciate their contributions, and
to give them proper weight in the solution ofthe problem. In
the “real” world representatives of these disciplines will have
to work together to solve environmental problems. I submit
that engineers are just not used to thinking this way.

One of the saddest manifestations of the transitional
period that we are in is the failure of the practicing engineer to
appreciate the revolution that is occurring in the field of the
environment. The October 17, 1969 issue of the NEW YORK
TIMES contained an article which described the transition of the
preeminent Instrumentation Laboratory of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology from a Federally supported laboratory
for radar and inertial guidance research, a laboratory that made
its name during the Second World War, to a laboratory which
will be guided into problems of the environment under the

administrative wing of the Department of Civil Engineering. A
very outstanding engineer, Charles Stark Draper, after
forty-seven years on the faculty of MIT, and after many years
as Director of this laboratory, which has an annual budget of
some 54 million dollars, expressed concern at the new
direction and generally opposed the reorganization of the
laboratory. He felt that the people in the laboratory could not
make the transition to the new area of work and that funding
could not be acquired for the new works. Again, I submit that
it is incumbent upon us to make this transition. I will not
dwell here on the long-term effects of not making this
transition. We are in a post-technical society. We have
over-u/tilized many of our resources, including air and water.
Those of us actively engaged in the environmental engineering
field do not think that this transition of effort is a question of
oice; it is a necessity. We look upon the lamentations of
Professor Draper and cannot appreciate his viewpoint.

Finally, let me give you some insight into what is being -

done in industry today. At a meeting of the staff of a large
industrial firm two weeks ago I spent the entire day lecturing
to sixteen engineers, men who were selected one from each
plant of a Division of the Company to become their
environmental engineers. These men were being submitted to
intensive orientation sessions to start them in this field. The
Vice President of Engineering of the Company indicated that
the Company had no alternative -- they simply could not
locate and hire men with appropriate engineering education to
fill their needs. I do not believe that this is a short-term. There

will be a large future demand for people equipped to deal-with
environmental problems. It has been estimated that
somewhere between 50,000-75,000 practitioners of the
engineering arts will be needed by the year 1975 in the areas
of air and water polution. The situation is the same in other
areas of environmental engineering.

In summary, I would say that this is an optimum time for
considering careers in environmental engineering. It means a
broadening of an engineer’s disciplinary base. It means that
one must make forays into areas of sociology, medicine, law,
and become acquainted with life in the community as it is,
because many factors not usually associated with the success
of engineering implementation will determine the success of
implementation of environmental programs. There are some
schools presently involved in this type of education. They are
limited in terms of number and in terms of scope, but the
younger engineer today can go on to advanced education at
these institutions.

In future years, it is a certainty that in Chemical
Engineering layouts there will no longer be arrows from
processing labelled “To Waste.” We will be thinking in terms
of utilization of all waste products in the environment and
there is an entire new area of engineering to formulate as many
solutions as possible in our processing industries. As you
know, the entire field of mass transportation in this courltry is
almost at a standstill and requires new engineering input. I
could continue to cite individual areas associated to a greater
or lesser extent with each of the major disciplinary vases of
engineering in order to indicate where the needs are.

I will conclude with a quotation from Rene Dubos, as
published in the November 14, 1969 issue of SCIENCE. In the
fourth paragraph of the editorial entitled “The Social Design
for Science,” Dr. Dubos indicates that:

“So far universities and research institutes have largely
remained aloof from the problems that the world will face in
an acute form before this Century is over. But the pressure of
public opinion will soon force scientists out of this aloofness.
Scientists will have to redirect their thoughts and skill away
from problems in which they are now interested toward
problems of larger social significance. Rapid and profound
shifts in areas of emphasis will therefore occur with regard to
theoretical science and to technology.”

I have spoken to you today about one of these shifts. We
are on the threshold of environmental management.

prepared to draw something on the blackboard that had been
the cause of excitement in the homes during the previous
week. One by one the pupils came forward and sketched such
items as report cards, television sets, mothers’ new hats, and
the like.

When it came time for Johnny, the class cutup, to comply
with the assignment, however, he walked to the board and
simply made two white chalk dots before returning to his seat.

Suspecting that he was up to one of his usual pranks, the
teacher advised John that he had better be able to explain
why those two dots were exciting if he didn’t want to be kept
after school.

“Well,” said Johnny, “the other day you told us that
those dots are also called periods . . . ”

“That’s correct, the teacher interrupted.

“But what could possibly be exciting about two periods?”

“Beats me,” replied Johnny, “But that’s how many my
sister in high school says she’s missed, and they’re causing an
awful lot of excitement around our house!”

Verily I say unto you, marry not an engineer; for the
engineer is a strange being possessed by many devices; yea, he
speaketh in parables which he calleth formulae, and he
wieldeth a big stick which he calleth a slide rule; he hath but
one Bible — a handbook.

He talketh away of stresses and strains and of no end of
thermodynamics; he showeth always a serious aspect and
seemeth not to know how to smile; and he picketh his seat on
the car by the number of springs therein and not by the
damsel thereon. Neither does he know a waterfall except for
its power, not the sunset but for its specific heat.

Always he carrieth books with him, and he entertaineth
his maiden with steam tables. Verily, though the damsel
expecteth chocolates when he calleth, he opens the package to
reveal samples of his new alloy.

Yea, he holdeth a damsel’s hand, but only to measure the
friction, and he kisseth only to test viscosity. For in his eye
shineth a faraway look which is neither love nor longing, but a
vain attempt to remember an equation.

Even as a little boy, he pulleth a girl’s hair, but to test its
elasticity, and as a man he discovereth different devices, for he
would hold a maiden to his bosom only to count the
palitations of her heart, and to reckon the strength of her
materials.

Alas! his marriage is a simultaneous equation, involving
two unknowns and yielding a periodic function.

I hear
yourse think,
it’ time to think
about noise.

Noise won’t kill you. But before it leaves you deaf,
it may drive you crazy.

Noise is pollution. And noise pollution is approaching
dangerous levels in our cities today.

People are tired of living in the din of car horns and
j ackhammers. They’re starting to scream about noise. ‘

Screaming won’t help matters any. But technology will.
Technology and the engineers who can make it work.

Engineers at General Electric are already working
to take some of the noise out of our environment. One area
where they’re making real progress is jet-aircraft engines.

Until our engineers went to work on the problem,
cutting down on engine noise always meant cutting
down on power. But no more.

GE has built a jet engine for airliners that’s quieter than
any other you’ve ever heard. A high-bypass turbofan. It’s
quieter, even though it’s twice as powerful as the engines
on the passenger planes of the Sixties.

And NASA has chosen General Electric to ﬁnd ways of
cutting engine noise even further.

It may take an engineer years of work before he can
work out the solution to a problem like noise in jet engines.
And it may be years before his solution has any impact
on the environment.

But if you’re the kind of engineer who’s anxious
to get started on problems like these and willing to give them
the time they take, General Electric needs you.

Think about it in a quiet moment,

Or, better yet, a noisy one.

In every lake or river or stream are tiny
little microorganisms that eat pollution.

That’ s all they do. Eat and get fat and
sink to the bottom. Where they won’t
bug you.

But sometimes the water gets too pol-
luted. And the little bugs start starving
for air. And stop reproducing and eating.

That’ s the problem Union Carbide’s
Linde Division took on.

We’ve just come up with a system
that gives these little bugs a straight shot
of pure oxygen. It makes them eat and
eat and eat. And reproduce more rapidly.
So even more little bugs start eating.

Already we’ve used this oxygen aera-
tion idea to save a sick river in Louisiana.
And we think it can revolutionize waste
water treatment.

B e thislake clean.

Hungry bugs isn’t the only idea we’ve
had to clean up water pollution. We’ve
had a lot of good people working on de-
tergents that chemically break down and
don’t spoil the water. And new instru-
ments to constantly watch the water that
goes into rivers and the like.

Back to bugs...

You should see the way they stuff
themselves once you whet their appetites.

 at Pitt

by Dr. W. L. Garrison

   

Much of knowledge is knowledge of the enirvoifi-men 
physical processes, attributes of matter,_,an,_c1:-,=§;i_t_,.eElike 
when we apply it through engineering__1-iiwle ch" ge-=' the
environment.  ’  " '   ’

So what is new about 
Systems Engineering? M     "

What is obviously"n'ew7 is thatwe  not usually consider
our task as one of,"_cor1,sc’iously, the environment. We
usually set out to “make a new’-sot better product, to introduce
efficiency into a proce‘ssg,_’ta?ﬁdf/or to perform a task in a new or
better way. A key ’°*.fe'ature of the Environmental Systems
Engineering Program is that it will consider environmental
questions in a systematic fashion. Another is that it will
complement many existing programs.

This. point of complementing must be emphasized because
it is one of the important features of the Program. All of the
work in the School is relevant to environmental questions, yet
there are important differences of degree and in kind.
Different engineering traditions go in different ways; in some

 
   

 

 -' raises questions only implici_tly-fgvvith respect to broad social

goals and with respect  liernative systems that might be
developed in supp0_tt.,_=,_offithese goals. We simply solve the
problem of fixing cost of the fixes go on and on — we
are still paying faifme:'rs not to plant cotton.

Take  problem of the automobile where we are making

  

_  -— ixes. We are busy fixing the emissions problem —
eva:pr5era’tion of fuel, crankcase blowby, oxides of lead, carbon
monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. We are making it safer for
the second collision — the way driversvjaridz passengers collide
with the inside of the car after‘;_t_héi-:'?t;ar’7h‘as collided with
something else. We are fixing,,up‘i:“3:t;hé:T’ roads and streets the
automobile travels upon; oﬁe_  elis saved every year for every
five miles of expres_sw';ay—.fthat we build. We are said to be
improving driver, and licensing.

What about the way the highway transportation system fits

.,iIIto.=,our;..national needs? Are we evolving movement systems

environmental questions are relatively minor, while in others. 

they are important. 
So the Program is another specialized
kaleidoscope of engineering activities.    
Let’s discuss the Program, but before d_,oing---so, let us get
some ideas in mind about envirnorr_1er1=ta‘l, questions.
Automobiles are polluting’: t-l_1_e"f=' air, air compressors are
noisy, oxides of sulphur ;jare"v"pouring out of electric power
generation and heatifIg:‘3"’—pl'ai'1ts, and partly-treated sewage is
contaminating our rivers. We recognize these problems and are
putting fixes on them — we seem to be recognizing and fixing
a lot of them just now. This kind of problem solution may be
called a reaction to crisis syndrome, and it is hardly unique to
the environment area. In the 1930’s we recognized a crisis of
too much production capability, and we tried to fix it by
providing employment in other than production industries, by

holding down production, expecially of farm products, an_d_by‘

artifically improving prices. There are law and order,-.prolii
for which we have recently recognized a,..c '  A 
money is devoted for providing law and orc7l_,,_., . _ ':n7ce°rn about
the safety of the automobile has:i%jreach_'e"é1i a crisis, and money is
spend to improve dfr-iver—- ~‘l111tréti'°r1ii"igl, to change vehicle
characteristics, and_ to "Inal<e"1"spot improvements of highways.

What i's"for soléietyiserious about this pattern of decision
making is that ‘it ignores system inter-relationships; also, it

 the money that is being spent to fix up the existing system be

used to evolve new systems with better properties?

Because the transportation system has so much impact
upon the environment, and because so much leverage may be
brought upon the environment through changes in the
transportation system, we usually consider within it the
environmental problem area. But perhaps some examples from
areas that are closer to traditional environmental questions
might help make this point.

There is much concern right now with putting a fix on
noise pollution (i.e., the pollution of quiet by noise), air
pollution, and water pollution. What are we doing? For one
thing, we are fixing the more blatant of the problems. So we
are improving jet ai_rcraft engines so that the trail of black
smoke disappears, {a'nd in the process we are probably
increasing_ the of oxides of nitrogen. We are reducing
c’e_rtaii€_:i_‘emissi‘ons from stacks near the surface of the earth. At
 safne time we are ignoring the vapor trails from high ﬂying
_] it aircraft as well as the contaminants being spilled into the
higher atmosphere by those aircraft.

This kind of action of reaction to things that are blatantly
objectionable may mean we are putting our resources to the
wrong ends. Who knows?

More importantly, while these fixes are made to improve
the quality of the environment, plans and action are not set
within understandings of desirable attributes of the
