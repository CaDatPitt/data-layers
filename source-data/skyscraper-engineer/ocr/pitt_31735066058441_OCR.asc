terminal as he tried to make sense of the cryptic computer
output.


    Captain Miller was thinking about their trip. The
insignificant amount of work that had to be performed was
easily being handled by John and Stu. When they return,
particularly if successful, they will all be hailed as astronauts.
In point of fact, they were really only oil field workers. During
the three months of their voyage, they have had almost
nothing to do. Everything about the navigation was automatic
and computer controlled. The same thing will be true of their
three and a half month return trip. During their entire nine
month voyage the only ti me they will be busy will be when they
are working the fields of Arabia-North. In fact they spent most
of the last three months reviewing some of the trickier
construction tasks that they will have to perform. That relaxed
period was over and their hard work was just about to begin.
Their computers had already begun sending telemetering
data to Earth in preparation for the final navigational
correction.
    "Hey Stu, turn on the graphics display so that we can all
see the image of the landing site," shouted John. The
computer officer obliged by punching in the appropriate
program and in seconds the half formed image appeared on
the screen.
    "As soon as the picture is completed, stored in the
computer, and processed, the final navigational correction
will be made," intoned the Captain. They were all staring
intently at the rapidly forming image. Captain Miller noted the
randomly scattered dark spots. He recalled that the original
image sent back by Voyager 29 had similar spots. Perhaps
when the picture is processed and the features enhanced he
will see the spots more clearly. He watched as the picture was
completely formed and then instantly small changes were
apparent as the image processor automatically began
working. Barely noticeable features suddenly became very
clear. Fuzzy portions were being miraculously focused. The


noise spots were eliminated. Captain Miller was enthralled by
the sparkling clear image that appeared.
    As the men continued watching the screen, they saw a
small cross in the middle of the very flat region which was the
indicated landing site. They also noticed a small circle roughly
three and a half miles to the left of the cross which was the
computers projection of where they would land if there were
no corrections. As the men stared, they saw the circle move
gradually towards the cross. They did not feel anything
because at this distance the corrections were so minute.
Within minutes the circle enclosed the cross and the
corrections ceased. This part of the flight was finished, and the
ship was right on target. All three men strapped themselves in
and waited for the landing.


    It was just moments before the landing. Captain Miller
flipped on the camera that was pointing to the landing site.
This image was digitized for the computer but merely
displayed instantly for the astronauts. They were headed dead
on towards the target. Only Captain Miller realized with shock
that he was not looking at a target marker but an impossible
feature of the terrain.
    "This is ridiculous. How did that thing get there?" cried
Miller. He could see two, or was that a third one in the corner.
But the one that they were headed straight towards demanded
his attention. It appeared to be cylindrical, less than a foot in
diameter, made of some hard shiny metal, and about twenty
feet high pointing straight out of the ground.
    "This is impossible! How could randomly placed spikes be
sticking out of an uninhabited flat planet? How could they get
there?"
    In the midst of his turmoil and shock, Captain Miller
suddenly realized that the computers would be programmed
to know that such things are impossible. The spikes would
naturally be thought of as spots of noise and removed from the
images. He and his men were about to be impailed on a spike
of noise.

        The silicon chip.

Its replacing the scalpel.


His doctors suspect a mass in the
right lung. Exploratory surgery is per-
formed-but without the surgery.
     This is made possible because of a major ad-
vance in radiology called the CT Scan (short for
computed tomography),
                           The CT Scan provides
                      thousands of digitized X-ray
                      readings of a patient's body.
                        Then, using a com-
                        puter, it synthesizes the
                          data into a series of cross-
                          sectional or tomo-
  ".                       graphic images-all
                           within seconds.
                                The detail is incred-
ible. Often a diagnosis can be arrived at immediately
-so the patient is spared the knife.
     But it's the heart of the computer that's the real
miracle. The silicon chip,
     The silicon chip is responsible for a new wave
in microelectronics and a remarkable revolution in
medical diagnostics.
     It's created the digital ultrasound imager, That
helps doctors visualize the womb of a pregnant wom-
an with sound waves to monitor fetal development.


              It's created digital fluorography. That
      can detect a narrowing in the carotid artery-
without hospitalizing the patient for an angiogram.
     General Electric is committed to finding new
ways to make the computer chip serve. In medicine.
And in other industries,
     For instance, we're investing loo million dollars
in our new GE Microelectronics Center.
     We've acquired INTERSIL, one of the leading
designers of specialized computer chips. We've also
acquired CALMA, a company which is using CAD/
CAM technology to revitalize the American factory,
     GE is even exploring new uses for microelectron-
ics in satellite communications, radar and robotics.
     Microelectronics is where the future is. A future
that will need talent, Engineering talent,

Luis Castellanos mines copper

with software.


  Most copper is found deep under-
ground. But the Bell System's 995
million miles of copper cable have
tons of it above and below ground.
That copper provides vital circuit
paths to transmit customer voice,
data and video signals for today's
Information Age needs.
  And Luis Castellanos, seven
years out of undergraduate school,
supervises one of the groups that
helps Bell System companies "mine"
all that copper. He works with one of
the largest computer hardware and
software systems in the world-the
Trunks Integrated Record Keeping
System (TIR KS). Every day it
"mines" the vast Bell network for
available circuits and equipment. As
a result of efficient use of network
facilities, the Bell System saves
millions by eliminating the need for
certain capital expenditures.


  Plus, there's more to TIRKS than
"mining copper." It also configures
circuits and assigns components
needed for each circuit path. That
allows Bell companies to respond
faster to customer requests for com-
plex services like video and data
transmission. Employees are more
productive too, because TIR KS
helps them set up circuits and fore-
cast facility needs.
  Before TIR KS was available,
keeping track of communications
circuits and facilities required enor-
mous amounts of paperwork and
manual calculation. Every day, the
average Bell System company
handles orders involving 1500
circuits and up to 7500 individual
components associated with them.
Each detail has to be specified
and accounted for.
  Now, thanks to people like Luis,
TIRKS keeps track of all that infor-
mation instantaneously using com-
puters. Information is up-to-date. It's
instantly available. And it's more
accurate.
  According to computer scientists
like Luis, the benefits from TIRKS


are just beginning. He believes that,
as more computer hardware and
software systems like TIRKS
interact, new benefits for customers
may be possible, as well as
additional productivity increases
for employees.
  Luis joined Bell Labs with a B.S.
in computer science from Pratt In-
stitute. Under a company-spon-
sored graduate study program, he
attended Stevens Institute of Tech-
nology for his M.S. in computer
science. At the same time, he
worked part-time assuming respon-
sibility for a large piece of TIRKS
software. Working with design
teams, he gained valuable insight
from experienced members. Now,
his technical performance has
earned him a promotion to
supervisor.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER


   Ten to fiteen years ago, Skyscraper Engineerwas winning
awards for student engineering journalism. Five years ago it
became defunct due to apathy and lack of support. Today,
hopefully, you are holding another quality publication. but
this issue has been put together with the work of just a few
people. That is not what this magazine should be.
   This magazine is intended for all. It should be a means of
communication from student to dean, student to professor, or
from department to department.
    I want to invite anyone who wishes to contribute to The
Skyscraper to do so. We welcome articles from professors and
students alike. Articles may be submitted to the staff in room
125 Benedum Hall. Writing submitted need not be technical,
just interesting. For their support and  cooperation  in
publishing this issue, I would like to thank: Dean William
Rudoy, Mr. Charles Aveni, Dr. Charles Beroes, Dr. Ronald G.
Hoelzeman, Dr. Albert G. Holzman, and Dr. Morton Kanefsky.
And of course, I would also like to thank my staff.
    See you next issue.

COGLAC: Taking Stock in Tommorrow's
Energy Initiative -Coal
By Annunciata E. Marino
Writer, Skyscraper Engineering
November 18, 1981


Introduction:
If you have ever thought about saving for the future by investing in
gold, real estate, or an individual retirement plan, now is the time to
join an increasing number of people from around the world who are
investing in a most revolutionary new energy source, coal.


    A relatively little publicized event, the International
Symposium  on Coal Gasification, Liquefaction and
Conversion to Electricity (COGLAC), is attracting a lot of
attention these days, perhaps as much as OPEC.
Representatives from Germany, the United Kingdom, South
Africa, Japan, Australia, and Canada, to name a few, visit
Pittsburgh annually to attend one of the most popular and
important energy symposiums in the world. The reason, coal
has reemerged one as of the most economically viable energy
resources available today. As the price of oil increases almost
daily, this valuable resource, long thought "priced out of the
ball park" due to environmental regulation, is being "pulled
from the bench".
    In 1972, students at the University of Pittsburgh
expressed a need and interest in a continuing forum in the
area of coal conversion. In response, the first COGLAC
symposium  was held in 1973. What appeared an
overwhelming response at the time, came from 75
applications postmarked from around the world. COGLAC's
members consist of the energy intensive (production)
industry, governmental agencies, those who sell processing
equipment, researchers, and others who have a vested interest
in energy production. There are also members who have
strategic and economic interest in the conference who must
have energy to sustain industry and economic growth and
development in their countries. When participants leave the
symposium, they are "up-to-the-minute" on all aspects of the
commercialization of coal conversion: the financial, technical,
environmental, etc.
     Dr. Charles S. Beroes, Professor of Chemical Engineering
 at Pitt and Chairman of COGLAC, graciously agreed to speak
 on behalf of COGLAC's efforts and to answer some questions
 (in italics) on coal conversion technology.
     Professor Beroes was born on a Pennsylvania farm that
 was situated on top of three veins of recoverable coal. As a
 child he worked in the coal mines, and by the time he began
 college, he became concerned about the nation's energy
 problems, particularly the lack of a secure energy resource.
     Beroes claims that the U.S. is the Saudia Arabia of coal.
 He says that recent projections show that we have 300 to 500
 years of coal. "The Russians have quite a bit of coal, the
 Chinese, the English and the Australians. Japan has some
 coal, too, but we have the greatest coal deposits in the world."
     What is the gasification of coal? Millions of years ago
 when coal was being formed from its original plant material,
 the vegetable matter began to coalify, that is, gases began to
 form. However, one gas, hydrogen, was removed in this
 process. Today, gasification means adding the hydrogen
 produced from steam, to the gases produced by the burning of
 coal.
     The actualization of this process, however, is not a simple


matter. Burning coal produces toxic gases (SO2) that destroy
the function of alveoli in our lungs. Sulpher removal is of
tremendous importance to protect our lungs. Each person is
born with approximately 6 million alveoli, much more than we
need. Nevertheless, we want to preserve them so that we're
healthy when we get older. If we reduce the lungs ability to
take in oxygen, we put a greater strain on the heart and the
body will fail somewhere else.
     Describe some of the important processes that have
recently been developed in this area? One of the problems
with the gasification of coal is the lack of a simple proven
process. Over the years, roughly ten processes have been
developed and researched. But, there has been no existing
commercial operation utilizing any gasification technique that
serves as a prototype.
    However, there have been exciting developments in the
processed removal of sulpher and toxic gases from that gas
produced from coal. It is called Flue Gas Desulfurization
(FGD). Presently, there are about 140to 160 designs available.
The largest model ever built is the Bruce-Mansfield operation
located in Shippingport, Pennsylvania. It uses over 2500 tons
of coal per day and generates over 2,000 megawatts of
electricity per day.
    The costliest item on the list of coal expenditures is
transportation. As much as 25% of the coal is lost through the
combintation of transport, refining, and industrial use.
    Is the idea of slurrying coal a response to this expense?
 Recent technology is looking into the possibility of slurrying
 the coal. Through the use of water, as much as one part water
 to one part coal, the transportation costs are minimal
 compared to other methods, ie., rail, barge, ocean liner. One
 disadvantage is that now you have a great amount of water
 that would need to be removed from the coal. But, this is a
 technological challenge. In fact, the whole energy scene is full
 of technological challenges, one on top of the other.
     Describe the in-situ process. The in-situ method of
 producing gas from coal is another of these challenges. This
 process involves drilling into the coal bed, producing
 fractures with explosives, then pumping air in controlled
 amounts through one pipe while collecting the gas produced
 through another pipe. However, the hydrogen-carbon ratio
 (BTU value) is much greater through the previously
 mentioned refining of coal (FGD) than the present method of
 in-situ processing.
     Would the production of synfuels from coal affect the
 amount of C02 presently being released into the atmosphere?
 Anytime a fossil fuel is being burned, it will release CO2.
 Furthermore, from careful measurement on various places on
 the earth, it has been determined that an increasing amount of
 CO2 has been released into the atmosphere. But, as long as we
 have the oceans, they will continue to remove CO2, and this




question really addresses the issue of energy demand versus
energy supply.
    In addition to the removal of certain toxic substances in
coal, as well as the removal of CO2, another exciting
conversion process is the production of methanol from coal
for use in automobiles. The combusion engine, after minor
adjustments are made, can operate on methanol. the
production of ethanol from grain is not as feasible as the
production of methanol. If we plant every arable acre in the
U.S., we could not produce enough grain to run our
automobiles. In a recent competition, a sizeable amount of
money was offered to the maker of an automobile that uses an
alternative fuel.
    What were the results? It was found that an automobile
can be made to run on just about anything, for example, sewer
gas or wood.
    If the U. S. increased its production of coal, do you see the
likelihood of an increased exportation of coal to be in conflict
with the national goal of a secure source of energy? Coal
exports have increased in the past and will continue to
increase. Because coal is much cheaper than oil, coal will
replace oil. An increase in the use and export of coal will
contribute to the continuation of this nation's standard of
living.
    Professor Beroes has been dating major oil finds on a wall
map of the world that he keeps in his office.He tells me that
there have been no major oil finds of any commercial value for
the past five years, and that coal conversion processes provide
an optimistic energy future. "At present this country produces
only about 45% of the total amount of oil it needs and imports
oil at a cost over $94 billion per year. So the future of coal
refining is just as great as ever. Burning oil in a power plant at
$35 per barrel is equivalent to $5.38 per million BTU. Burning


coal in the same power plant at $13.89 per ton is equivalent to
$2.12 per million BTU. The bottom line is simple economics,
burning oil is two and one half times as much as coal."
    Beroes predicts that the mining and purifying of coal will
produce more jobs than any industry we now have. "The
production of clean fuels from coal will be one of the major
industries in this country and in the world. Presently, this
country is not in a negotiating position because we must have
foreign oil," he continues, "a push toward the use of coal will
give us a strong negotiating position."
    In addition to the environmental, social and political
aspects of coal conversion, a wide range of technological
advances and "challenges" are covered at the COGLAC
symposium. In order to educate the novice in this fast growing
field, a basic course on coal gasification, liquefaction and
refining has been developed. This course was offered by Pitt
last August and was conducted by Charles S. Beroes and Alan
J. Brainard, Professor of Chemical Engineering, and James T.
Cobb, Professor of Chemical Engineering and Director of the
Master of Energy Resources Program.
    The next COGLAC Symposium is scheduled for August
3-5, 1982. Papers presented at the symposium are by invitation
only; however, registration is open to all interested persons.
    The scope of COGLAC covers a wide range of
opportunities available to resolve the complex energy
problem facing the world today. Maximization of these
opportunities is encouraging global cooperation and
development, particularly by those countries who presently
consume more oil than they produce. But, it has been the
association between energy use and the GNP that has
enlightened the energy consciousness of the world and has
created the rising interest in the economic potentiality of coal
conversion processes.

KILLER ROBOT SOUGHT


THE NA TIONAL STAR INQUISITOR
Dec. 10, 1981 - NSI, Tokyo
    Tragedy struck last night at the
Quasimoto Car Company of Japan. A
repairman working the night shift was
attacked by a killer robot as he
attempted to perform   a routine
adjustment. Witnesses at the scene
reported that the robot had been
drinking heavily before the incident.
A physician's report stated that
repairman Isao Nikon was recovering
from   multiple stab wounds,
apparently inflicted with a
switchblade. It is still not known why
the robot was allowed to carry a
concealed weapon. At last report, the
killer robot was seen driving from the
company parking lot in a Datsun
B210, headed toward Tokyo.


    Maybe it won't be so bad, muttered Burk. After all, I am in
on what may be the biggest story of all time. perhaps his
mounting enthusiasm was just a consequence of all the
impressive electronic monitoring equipment and the nervous
chatter of the technicians. Houston control is an exciting
place to be just before an extraterrestrial landing, let alone this
one. His job was only to interview the project director,
whomever elese he could talk to and then write the story for
The Sentinel. Interviewing engineers with all their inevitable
technical jargon could be very tedious indeed. He must pay
attention if he expected to get the facts of the story straight.
    Burk need hardly be reminded that the purpose of this
flight was oil. It seemed that everything one did these days was
dictated by the need to conserve every drop of it. Didn't he
have to take the commuter two hours early because there
wasn't enough fuel for more than two runs a day? He
remembered vividly being packed in like a sardine in near
darkness. At least they let him wander around and observe the
excitement while waiting to see Dr. Sanders. He marveled at
the relative coolness of the air inside Houston Control.
Evidently, its vast array of solar cells supplies sufficient energy


that a small amount of air conditioning was possible. What
luxury! It has been years since Burk experienced the pleasure
of cooled air.
    The fuel shortage was so acute that extraterrestrial
exploration, even for fuel itself, was thought to be out of the
question. No one could justify burning thousands of gallons of
fuel for any reason, no matter how important. In fact, Burk
remembered all of the bitter arguments when two years ago,
Voyager 29, a small unmanned spaceship and the last one
before this one, was sent out to examine the newly discovered
moon of Jupitor. Even though the scientists were sure that this
moon was loaded with oil, burning fuel for space exploration
was nearly impossible then and totally impossible now. And
yet, Captain Miller and his crew were out there, thanks to all
that was learned from Voyager 29.
    Voyager 29 proved conclusively that Arabia-North, as it
became known, contains veritable oceans of oil just below its
surface. Even so, no further exploration was permitted until
Dr. Sanders proposed Operation Tanker. He argued that it was
possible to send out an oil burning ship this fall, when the
relative locations of Earth and Jupitor were favorable, and

have it return with even more fuel than it had when it left. While
no one expects that the additional fuel will amount to more
than one and a half liters, what a marvelous breakthrough!
What shattering possibilities for the future. Best of all, who
could argue with Operation Tanker no matter how much it
cost. It won't use any oil, if Dr. Sanders is right.
    Regardless of the enormous potential, if Operation
Tanker fails, Dr. Sanders won't get a second chance. However,
when Captain Miller's ship returns with at least the same fuel it
left with, that if it only breaks even, we will have entered a new
era.
    "Good to see you, Mr. Burkowski", bellowed Dr. Sander's
as he pumped Burk's hand. "What do you want to talk about?"
    "First I want to make sure that I fully understand the
technical aspects of this flight. For one thing, was the design
of the prefabricated oil refinery the trickiest engineering
problem?"
    "It was certainly one of the hardest problems", answered
Dr. Sanders. "As you may know, there are two crucial
constraints. In the first place, Captain Miller and his crew have
only two and a half months to complete the entire task of
drilling, constructing the refinery, and refining the oil. If it
takes longer, the positions of Jupitor and Earth become
rapidly unfavorable and the ship may not be able to return to
Earth for years. They use up every drop of fuel when they land
and cannot return unless they are able to find and refine the
oil; so the two and a half time constraint is crucial. The other
constraint is a problem for all aspects of this flight and that is
weight efficiency. The lighter the refinery, even though it
remains on Arabia-North, the less fuel we need for take-off
and landing."
    "In fact, the most complex aspect of the flight was the
need to husband every last drop of fuel, to save every last
ounce of weight, to add small efficiencies to every part of the
ship. There were many ingenius fuel savings, and without any
one of them, this flight would not have had a chance to break
even or with luck bring back a little extra fuel."
    "Could you give me an example of one of these novel fuel
savings, Dr. Sanders?"
    "Of course! You can see one of them by just looking at the
image on that screen of the landing site." All that Burk could
see was a scene of desolation and a total absence of plant life.
"If you were a trained geol, Mr. Burkowski, that scene would
shout 'oil', but that is not the aspect I want you to examine. For
an area of 20 square miles surrounding the landing site, the
ground is almost completely flat and level. Our cameras can
observe the details down to less than a foot, even though this
picture was taken at an altitude of 50,000feet. The landing site
is as flat as it looks in the picture. When we saw that image, we
realized that we could simplify the landing procedure. If the
ship is coming down in the middle of that area, there is no need
for horizontal corrections. The on-board computer need only
use fuel, with perfect efficiency to slow the ship down.
Eliminating any reserve fuel that would be necessary for
horizontal correction was the saving that put over the top. We
will repeat the saving on the return flight landing on the
Nevada salt flats."
    "But how can you guarantee that the ship will land in just
the right place?"
    "Ten minutes from now, when the ship is still outside the
gravitational pull of Arabia-North, a final navigational
correction will be made. At this point the energy needed for
correction is so slight, that it can be entirely supplied by the
ship's solar cells. We are confident that the accuracy will be
much better than one mile which will place the ship safely n


the flat area."
     Burk was suitably impressed with the fact that they were
 saving as much fuel as possible. He was also impressed with
 the remarkable quality of the image of the landing site. "I know
 about the quality of your cameras, but how could you transmit
 so faithfully over such a long distance? I understand the power
 of your transmitters was only around 10 watts.
     "That's a good question", responded Sanders with only a
 touch of condescention. "Since the beginning of space
 exploration, images have been transmitted via discrete
 communication techniques. The image is first discretized by
 sampling it 40,000 times and then quantizing each a sample
 into 64 levels. This discrete image is then divided into 240,000
 binary pulses. These pulses are transmitted slowly to Earth,
 taking a few hours for the entire image, where a receiver picks
 out the long, if very weak, pulses from the noise and decides if
 they are positive or negative. The code is then reformed into
 the image. Of course the receiver still makes a number of
 mistakes. To cut these errors way down, additional pulses are
 added which enable our ground computers to correct many of
 these errors. In spite of this, a few errors are still made.
 Actually our biggest problem is not the errors made during
 transmission but various kinds of noise at the source. The
 principle source of this noise is the distortion caused by the
 weak atmosphere of the moon and interfering dust-like
 particles."
    "Here, let me show you what I'm talking about Mr.
Burkowski. The original image of the landing site is still in our
computers." Saying this, Dr. Sanders moved quickly to one of
the terminals and pushed a number of buttons. Buck saw the
image appearing on the screen. It looked very similar to the
image he had seen previously but with some differences. This
image was not as clear as the final version.
    "You may notice many differences Mr. Burkowski. For
one thing, there is a weak snow-like noise over part of the
original image. This noise is caused by the transmission errors
that our decoders could not correct. Some parts of this
picture, particularly here in the lower left corner, are fuzzy.
This was caused by atmoshperic conditions. There is another
form of noise that appears as randomly scattered dark spots.
We presume that these are dust particles. Whether they were
actually on the camera's lens or are some sort of dust cloud, is
very hard to tell. Inspite of these noises, the terrain is clearly
visible and your eye can separate the image from the noise."
    "That's very interesting, Dr. Sanders, but how were these
distortions removed from the picture?"
    "Oh, that is done by image processing techniques. The
basic idea of these procedures was developed in the seventies.
Since then we have refined things to the point where we can
remove the noise without affecting the image in the slightest.
Actually our image processing not only removes the noise, but
it enhances certain kinds of terrain features. Observe this
rather faint line in the original picture. In the processed picture
we clearly see that this line is in reality the edge of a nine foot
drop. Such a drop would be very dangerous in the landing
zone, but as you can see it is eight miles from the targeted
landing spot. So you see our image processing techniques are
responsible for the high quality of our image."
    "Excuse me for a little while Mr. Burkowski, but the ship is
nearing its last navigational correction point and the tele
metering has started to come in. I want to make sure that
everything is okay."
    "Sure Dr. Sanders, I'll just stay out of the way and watch."
    Even as he was saying this, Burk realized that Dr. Sanders
was not listening. His attention was fully concentrated on the
