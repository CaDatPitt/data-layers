~ UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH —— SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER — FEBRUARY

 

Opinion . . .

ARE ENGINEERS APATHETIC?

 

 
 
 
  

 

It is ironical that the university, a place where young
people come to learn about society in the most general sense,
is also a shelter from society. For four years we are locked
away on our campus — secure, with food provided, bed pro-
vided, responsible to no one but our individual selves. How
few of us have the self respect to make ourselves worthy of
our own self respect? Am I a good supervisor over myself?
Evidently not, or why does apathy exist? Tomorrow, when
I am tempted to sleep through my nine o’clock class, will
I stop and think that the non-university population has been
awake for three hours already and that they are passing me
by? No; I am secure; I do not care; I am in college; I know
the world is not passing me by. When I graduate, I will
have passed by the rest of the world. I know about the
world, though we have been separated. For the past four
years the world has told me via radio, newspapers, television
about itself, all that I need to know.

How can apathy not exist in such a haven as a college?
During most weeks, the most crucial questions we answer
are: Have I worked enough to get by, why should I do
more than necessary? or, what can I do to keep from study-
ing? Should I go home this weekend? There I will be a
guest and can surely shirk unpleasant responsibilities.

What can we do to appear as insurgents? Since we are,
along with other people our age, separated from society, a
messed up society which we did not create nor mess up, bL1t
must some day inherit and suffer in, we will do what society
does not do and vice versa. Then we will call ourselves in-
dividuals exercising our right to be individuals, though we
are lying. I hope that we respect ourselves enough to realize
that we are actually as unindividualistic as a housing de-
velopment. I also hope that the experience of college will
enable us to ﬁnd ourselves. -

In answer to the question Are engineers apathetic? any
CAS student would say that engineers are apathetic, ultra-
conservative, intelligent students who do not care about any-
thing except their slide rules. I will not say more.

PERCEPTION AT LEN

Recent inventions extend man’s senses.

lnfroducﬁon

Man, endowed with ﬁve senses that enable him to per-
ceived the world around him, has what can probably be
described as fair ability in each. Many animals have one,
perhaps two of their senses far superior to man’s. Man
invents, however. Beginning with his hand cupped behind
his ear, he has invented a myriad of instruments and tech-
niques to increase his perception.

Three of the ﬁve main senses we can use in remote
sensing. This remote sensing is simply the process of
getting information about an object without touching it
i.e., at a distance. Taste and touch are not, of course remote
senses, but sight, hearing and smell let us perceive at some
ﬁnite distance however large or small.

Use of Waves

Instruments classiﬁed as remote sensers make use of the
electromagnetic spectrum including light, radio, radar and
heat waves, X rays as well as sound, magnetism and laser
beams. Beginning at the high energy end of the spectrum
we have gamma rays used as counters for radioactive mate-
dials. Next, X rays aid medical men. In the narrow visible
range, man can use his own eyes as well as his invented
eyes called cameras. On the infrared side, infrared scanning
devices locate forest ﬁres, volcanoes and even crop diseases.

"by Joseph Andrews

Radar currently locates geologic formations. Radiometers
can detect icebergs and rain clouds. And, ﬁnally, radio
telescopes gather information in the form of energy from
stars and deep space. These instruments cover the entire
range of the spectrum.

I nfrared

Infrared or heat radiation is emitted by every physician
object at a rate proportional to its temperature. The oscil-
lating atoms and molecules of every building, plant, person,
animal, etc. give off these heat waves. (Note that a light
bulb is simply a special case in which the temperature is
sufﬁcient to emit radiation in the visible range).

Since infrared scanners detect heat given off by objects,
obviously one of their most important uses appears to be
and is detection of forest ﬁres. In the United States, infrared
detectors have been used to spot forest ﬁres since 1965. They
could ﬁnd heat giving ﬁres that look—outs never were able
to spot. Not limited to ﬁres, these scanners can locate
volcanic activity before it becomes evident on the surface.
In two such surveys made by the U. S. Geological Survey of
the volcano Kilauea in Hawaii and the recently emerged
‘island off the coast of Iceland called Surtsey, they discovered
lava channels beneath the earth’s surface though no trace
was evident above ground. The weather satellite Nimbus II
in August of 1966 contained infrared scanning equipment
which recorded activity of the volcano which created Surtsey.

Infrared devices serve other purposes including these:

0 They can locate hot springs. In the U. S. presently, some
geathermal springs are running generators that produce
electricity.

9 They can locate subterranean fresh water.

9 Heat pictures of the body can reveal abnormally warm
or cool areas of the body.

° Use of the scanner can be made in the study of rivers and
streams to detect pollution by industrial wastes in particular
when the dumping of wastes into the waters is carried out
secretly (and illegally) at night. Pollution in streams raises
the temperature of the water.

3 In the same vein, they can detect pollutants from auto-
mobiles and chimneys that are poisoning the air.

9 They can detect bodies of air of different temperature,
invisible to the e e, which ma be turbulent.

0 They can detect on runways planes that have taken off

scanners, one that is under intense development and study
is the ability of the devices to identify objects, in particular,
minerals and plants at relatively large distances. One such
instrument is the infrared spectrometer which is a television
camera—like machine that can record patterns of heat radia-
tion of minerals and rocks. By aiming the device at a
mineral such as granite, and cooling the detector to about
7° K, a curve will be traced on an oscilloscope screen (it is a
voltage curve) and the vital information is recorded on tape,
the information to be fed into computers.

The S.pectrometer

As yet the infrared spectrometer has not been put into a
spacecraft. However, when detectors are placed in such
craft, it will enable scientists to read rock formations any-
where on the earth and moon. The information provided
will be fed into computers which will compare the data with
the spectral patterns stored within itself and will print out
the mineral constituents and make—up of the rock under
observation. This same task can also be accomplished by
trained readers comparing photographs, a process much
more time consuming and much less efficient than the com-
puters’ comparisons of numerical data rather than pictures.

Analysis of plants is carried out by means of a device
called a spectrophotometer. It measures chieﬂy the infrared
rays of the sun that are transmitted through the leaves.
Perhaps one of its most important uses is the detection
(indirectly) of the salt content‘ of the soil in which the plants
are grown. Too much salt will cause unhealthy plants. It
may be interesting to point out that irrigation projects in the
past have failed because of the build up of salt in the soil.
Irrigation water contains more minerals including salt than
rain water. During the present day, with the use of the
spectrophotometer, this problem is directed toward elimina-
tron.

With the spectrometer, scientists can “map” out ﬁelds
as to which crops they contain. By training a spectrometer
on a ﬁeld of crops from a seventy foot crane, the spectral
“signature” of each type of plant can be recorded. The
spectra “signature” is a pattern of radiation peculiar to each
type. When the information from the spectrometer is fed
into a computer and coded, the computer can be made to
print out a map showing precisely the distribution of the
crops in the ﬁeld. Probably equally important, the spectro-
meter—computer combination can be used to make aerial
surveys over forests, water, etc.

Photographs taken with ﬁlm sensitive to infrared light
show plant infection. The diseases, if present in the plants,
will appear on the ﬁlm even though no visible sign of the
infection is present. The great signiﬁcance of this fact is
that the disease can be caught and proper measures taken to
destroy it before the plants are seriously damaged. On the
photographs, infected plants will appear darker than healthy
plants. It is important that insect infestation as well as
disease can be detected by infrared techniques. Sick trees
tend to be ﬁve to ﬁfteen degrees (Farenheit) higher than
normal trees and this temperature difference enables sick
trees to be spotted by infrared scanners.

Use of O1-her Wavelengihs

The use of these remote sensing instruments is not
limited to infrared light. Geologists currently use a device
called a seismometer which can detect earth vibrations.
This device is helping earth scientists to augment their
understanding of movements in the earth’s crust and it is
enabling them to make better predictions as to when earth-
quakes will occur and the extent to which they will occur.
To give some indication of the ability of this seismometer,
it picks up about 10,000 tremors in a day’s time.

There is another device which has been in use for a
relatively long time and it is called the magnetometer. Its
main uses have been submarine detection and exploration
for ores and petroleum. Salt domes and petroleum may
also be found with a gravity meter.

Microwaves

Microwave devices have their most important usage in
dealing with weather and related conditions. Because of
the fact that ice radiates the short waves in the radio region
of the spectrum more than water does, microwave scanners
and receivers can pickup this radiation from icebergs and
thereby spot them readily. The U. S. Coast Guard has
highly efficient microwave receivers which they use to de-
tect icebergs particularly in the North Atlantic where a.re
located the shipping lanes. Concerning weather, microwaves
can be used to locate rain bearing clouds and thermal in-
versions. The former is obviously used to predict the rain-
fall to fall in an area. The latter, thermal inversions, can
be used to predict when smog and dangerous levels of air
pollution will exist over the land. Microwaves have hydro-
logical and agricultural uses, also. They are currently used
to study soil moisture distribution and water locations.

Gamma Rays. Cosmic Rays

Extremely sensitive Geiger counters called gamma ray
scintillometers can detect radioactivity‘ in the earth’s soil and
rocks. Cosmic rays, when they strike the atmosphere, re-

sult in emission of secondary particles called muons. The
passage of those muons can be monitored and this technique
serves as a sophisticated X ray.

Sound

As far as sound waves are concerned, sonar devices have
been in use for a few years. It has been that sonar devices
could give the location of an object but not its features.
Currently, research is being carried out where a camera,
scanning microscope, and a laser can be operated and
coordinated to provide a rather good visual picture of the
object considered to be the target of investigation.

Side-looking Radar

One of the most useful techniques, whose secrets have
only recently been released by the federal government, is
side-looking radar. The use of SLR has been mostly for
aerial reconnaissance. It is not affected by weather and
can be used to reconstruct a detailed picture of the earth.
Areas of the earth which have deﬁed aerial photography
for years because of thick cloud covers have been mapped
with outstanding clarity.

Conclusion

In the present day, man is accomplishing amazing things
with these remote sensing devices. They are being used on
land and in aircraft, but as yet these devices have not been
placed in spacecraft. Some of the plans to put‘ sensing
devices in orbit around the earth have been hindered by
the recent cutback in federal funds to the space program.
With the tremendous success of Apollo 8, it is hoped that
a new ﬁre will be lighted under the government leaders
who are responsible for appropriating money to the space
program and that adequate progress will be made toward
taking advantage of these sensers by developing orbital
earth surveys.

Metallography . . .

The Study of Structure

PART I OF THE MISCROSCOPIC STUDY OF METAL.

Introduction

When one is confronted with an unknown material, a
metal in particular, there are several techniques which can
be used to obtain a partial, if not total, identiﬁcation of it.
In this article, I have attempted to relate one of these
techniques — metallography.

MOUNTING

When conducting a metallographic investigation, it is
very essential to have a sample that is easy to handle. The
ideal__ size of a sample is about one—half inch across the sur-

1“~"\ faceiiand approximately one—quarter inch high. A method

1'“!

i“\t_h'.1t lowers the degree of difficulty in polishing a sample is

i) mount it. Mounting may be accomplished in a variety
-of ways; several of which are fusible mounts, synthetic
plastics, and mechanical mounts. The most popular of these
methods is the synthetic plastic technique which can be
either thermo—setting, such as bakelite, or thermo—plastic.

The thermo—setting resins have many distinct advantages;
they are available in a variety of colors which provide an
easy means of cataloging samples; they are resistant to
attack by most of the etching reagents used; this type of
mount also becomes more stable after molding due to a
chemical change; also, they become quite hard upon curing
and do not clog the emery paper used in polishing. These
thermo—setting resins, however, do have some decided dis—
advantages. Since they are thermo—setting, they must be
cured in a mold at both high temperature and pressure ——
135 — 150° C and 2500 — 3500 psi. Because of this the
mounting of certain metals and alloys, such as tin and lead
which would deform due to the pressure, or hardened alloys,
whose structure would change because of the temperature,
is not feasible. These resins also prohibit the use of some
strong alkalies and concentrated oxidizing agents. Another
distinct disadvantage is that the edges of the cured resins
may become excessively rounded off during the grinding
and polishing thereby, resulting in a rounded ﬁeld which
is unsuitable for photography. This shortcoming, however,
can be overcome by using rivets at the periphery of the
mount; the rivets tend to equalize the hardness of the

edges and center and help to provide a Hat ﬁeld.

The thermo-plastics used, such as lucite, also have some
properties of interest. The most outstanding of the ad-
vantages is their transparency which becomes convenient in
identifying the sample or viewing it cross—sectionally. One
of the decided drawbacks of the plastics is their tendancy to
become gummy during rough grinding. Since there is no
chemical change at molding temperature, the mount‘ will
not be really hard causing the gumminess with a tempera-
ture rise. In processing a thermo—plastic mount heat and
pressure of 140 — 165° C and 2500 — 3000 psi are needed. This
would cause the thermo—plastic to have the same dis-
advantages as the thermo—setting mounts with respect to
soft metals and alloys.

POLISHING

After the mounting has been completed, the next step
in a metallographic study is to subsequently grind and
polish the sample to a mirror—like ﬁnish. Initially, the sample
is rough-ground on a water cooled and cleaned belt grinder.
It is important that the water How be continuous to prevent
disturbed metal due to an increase in temperature from the
grinding operation which involves much heat producing
friction. If disturbed metal is present, a truly representative
sample surface will not result.

When the desired ﬂatness has been attained and all rough
marks, e.g. those caused by cutting the sample, have been
removed, the polishing then proceeds to the series, usually

four, of varying grit emery papers whose grit sizes are 240,

Engineer.

320, 400, and 600 respectively. The sample is passed across
the papers in one direction only, not back and forth. It is
also common practice to follow a deﬁnite pattern when using
grit papers; this is usually to polish perpendicular to the
previous grain produced. This is illustrated as follows:

325“<:>77

240

400 eoo

It is important that the ‘scratches’ are uniform and cover
the entire surface. When the four papers have been used,
the sample is ready for ﬁne polishing.

16

Usually employed for ﬁne polishing art wheel or lap
grinders which are either brass or bronze of about 8 — 10
inches in diameter and covered with a polishing cloth. An
abrasive suspended in a liquid is used; then, the sample is
polished until all scratches have been removed and a mirror-
like ﬁnish attained. In most cases two wheels are used in
ﬁne polishing with different size abrasives. The abrasives
that are used can be diamond dust, magnesium odixe, and
alundum, to mention a few. The latter is the one that was
employed in our case.

This abrasive, alundum — A1203 — is available in three
crystallographic forms known as alpha, beta, and gamma
with the former and latter being used. Used on the first
wheel was alpha alundum with a particle size of 1.0 micron
and hexagonal structure. The gamma type which was used
on the second wheel has a particle size of 0.05 micron and a
cubic structure.

In ﬁne olishin it is im ortant to rotate the sam“
P 8 P i_
opposite the direction of the wheel’s direction. If this prcg

cedure is not followed, “comet tails” tend to form behind‘_
the non-metallic inclusions and leave a rough surface. It is 1

important to retain all inclusions to give a representative
microstructure for study. If the inclusions are not retained,
gouges or pits will result in the surface.

Also important in the surface of the sample is the absence
of disturbed metal flow. Disturbed material is usually
caused by the abrasive used or the pressure that is applied
during the polishing; distrubed metal can be removed by
alternately repolishing and re—etching. Akin to disturbed
metal are scratches which signify sloppy technique. The
scratches should be removed to the greatest degree.

When the polishing is completed, the sample should be
wiped lightly with water—wet cotton to remove any excess
abrasive, stains, or ﬁngerprints. After the sample has been
washed, the surface should be flooded with alcohol or xylene
and dried under a blast of hot air. The samples should
then be stored in a desiccator, with some moisture absorbent
material inside such as silica gel, to await etching.

It is imperative during the entire grinding and polishing
operation, that the sample and the hands be washed after
each successive step. This is done to prevent contamination
of the next ﬁner grit paper or wheel.

ETCHING

For the etching of the sample, a number of etchants
composed of organic and non—organic acids, akalies of var-
ious kinds of other complex substances in solution with
water, alcohol, glycerin, or other solvents are available; used
in our studies were picral, nital, and Vilella’s reagent. The
gross result of etching is the ability of a reagent to pre-
ferentially attack a certain phase in the specimen. The de-
gree of attack depends upon phase composition, grain orien-
tation, and surface free energy. For example, one phase may
be more electropositive than another which will cause a
faster solution rate thereby leaving a depression in the sur-
face which appears darker due to the lesser degree of re-
flected light. As a further example picral etchant is used to
show the lamallae of pearlite in steel and to differentiate
“free” ferrite from pearlite areas. The primary lamallae,
being soft and ductile, are more electropositive than the
others and are reacted upon more vigorously thereby form-
ing sharply deﬁned valleys, especially along the ferrite-
carbide. The carbide then has a valley on each side of its
lammallae, which appear darked. When the carbide lamallae
are relatively thick, however, the depressions are separated
enough to be resolved by the microscope and appear bright
and lustrous. If the etching process is allowed to continue
past the “phase diffenentitation time,” the component which
was previously being dissolved forms an anodic coating
over itself and becomes ennobled. This phase then becomes
electronegative, and the other harder phase dissolves more
readily causing poor deﬁnition.

To provide a distinction between the grains of a sample
of a pure alloy or one of a single phase, a reagent which
emphasizes grain boundaries is used. In the case of ferrite,
the reagent used is nital. The nital attacks the grain bound-
aries where there is a higher free energy and results in a
depression; since this depression is out of the surface plane,
it appears dark under the microscope. In this manner the
grains of ferrite are distinguishable. The grains of pure
metal and single phase alloys, such as stainless steel, are
also distinguishable by oriented grain lusters with the use of
Vilella’s reagent and oblique lighting. Vilella’s reagent —
three glycerine, two HCl and one I-INO3 — will show the
structure of single phase materials such as austenitic

stainless steels.

 

When photography of a specimen is intended, the etch-
ing time should decrease with ascending powers of magni-
ﬁcation and should be slightly less than the time required to
produce maximum contrast for visual observation. Since
the structure is being photographed, it is better to achieve
contrast during developing and printing rather than over
etching to produce contrast. At low magniﬁcation there is
just as much error in under etching as there is in over etch-
ing. If under etching is present, characteristics such as grain
boundaries will not be seen. And consequently, if the sam-
ple is over etched the ﬁneness of detail will be ruined. In
the case of over etching, the ﬁnal polishing step must be
used and the sample re—etched.

The proper method for etching is to submerse the sam-
ple surface at a slight angle and employ a “swishing” motion
for the desired etch time. Stopping the etching action is
accomplished by flooding the surface with water; the sample
is then washed with alcohol and dried in hot air to prevent
any stains. The sample can then be photographed or stored
without the need for re—polishing or re-etching. If the sam-
ple is to be stored for a long period, it should be stored in a
tight dessicator or covered with a coating of Vaseline or
lacquer.

Non-engineering

lniroducﬁon

When I first began this task, it was hard for me to
visualize how episodes from my non—engineering career
mi ht be of interest to ou.

8 Y

I want to tell you a little about a career that has known
engineering — but neved intimately; that has worked closely
with engineers — but never as an engineer; a career whose
base is a Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering at Pitt,
but whose goal has always been “Commercial.”

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER — FEB. I969

by William J. Veenis

Engineering Training and the Non-Engineering Career

First of all, it helps in all dealings with trained and prac-
ticing engineers.

Originally, my work centered in Field Sales Engineering,
at job that calls for close association with many types of
professionals. The plant maintenance electrical engineer is
the proverbial jack—of—all—trades in the electrical ﬁeld. He
must know a fair amount about motors, generators, trans-
formers, condensers, electronics in both industrial and com-
munication areas, and, now, a few things about computers.
It is a job for the specialist — hence, it is the expected thing
for the cable specialist to provide him with specialized
answers in several areas:

9 Cable Design Work — with consideration of conduc-
tor size, insulation material and thickness, shielding,
jacketing, terminations, voltage regulation, protective
devices — all must be incorporated in adequate cable
design for plants of Jones and Laughlin Steel, Armco
at Ambridge, Pittsburgh Steel at Allenport.

0 Transmission and distribution trouble—shooting is an-
other area of contact. I recall where the vague
memory of Dr. Hovey’s famous circle diagram trans-
mission line design, and a knowledge of charging
current phenomena, saved a major chemical company
and my company considerable trouble and cost.

0 With the intense electrification of coal mining today,
the cable specialist has great reason to deal with the
mine electrical and mechanical engineer: proper de—
sign and handling of portable cables can save con-
siderable cost not only in’ cable life, but also in
needless down—time and lost coal production.

Electric utility engineers represent another area of con-
tact. Here, we are dealing with the “Specialist” in the cable
field. He must be kept informed of the “New,” and the
“Why” a new item should be incorporated in his system.
The transmission and distribution engineer and the station
engineer at such utilities as Duquesne Light, West Penn
Power, and Pennsylvania Electric at Iohnstown demand and
receive sound technical information from a Field Sales
Engineer.

Equipment Design Engineers — materials or speciﬁca-
tion engineers — are the bridge between purchasing and
production in such companies as Allis—Chalmers, Westing-
house, McGraw-Edison. Whatever his original technical
background, the design man spends a large portion of his
time seeking reliable information on the characteristics of
potential constituents of his product. He must know how
a new item will react to other parts in his manufacturing
process; how it will perform in the “system” under adverse
conditions of heat, cold, chemical attack, electrical stress,
even radiation bombardment; he must have fair knowledge
of how long it will last. Temporing the sales pitch to this
man, with technically credible facts, demanded all of the

engineering background I could muster.

On the sales side, the development of adequately directed
proposals to purchasing people can be helped measurably
through a technical background. Perhaps the ﬁrst rule in
selling to an individual buyer is “Don’t leap—frog the P.A.”;
get him to sell it for you. A detailed, accurate presentation
with individually developed supporting data — in the case
of conductors, current carrying capacities, fault current
characteristics, voltage drop curves, and more — will force
the Purchasing Agent to carry your story to others in his
company. He becomes your “salesman.” Incidentally, more
and more Purchasing Agents have engineering backgrounds,
lLOO.

An additional area where the technical background helps
in dealing with trained and practicing engineers centers on
grasping the validity and significance of an engineering pro-
posal. Let’s call it Socrate’s “gadfly” function: ﬁnding the
technical holes in the argument. As a New Product Manager,
I had to assess the practicality of many development pro—
gram proposals (from a technical standpoint) — from
extra high temperature irisulations to unorthodox conductor
shapes; the feasibility of production equipment in accom—
plishing technical as well as economic goals — will it dupli-
cate the pilot plant result? At what ﬁnal cost: In similar
fashion, what is the true signiﬁcance of adopting random
testing vs. 100% testing in quality control and inspection
programs.

My engineering background has saved my skin many
times in these past twenty years of dealing with trained and
practicing engineers.

Engineering Training and Ofher Professions

The second major area where I have found the Engineer—
ing Degree to help me is in my dealings with men in other
professions.

The engineering background has helped me to serve as
liaison between the engineering idea and management, an
interpretive job, a translation of mechanical jargon into
potential return. As New Product Manager, it became my
job to explain to sales, ﬁnancial, and legal people just how
a product and process worked.

In the development of company orientation and of ﬁeld
sales training programs, the engineering background helps
considerably in acquainting non—technical people with the
“hard facts” of their work. Technical rules (as simple as
Ohm’s Law) were required “teaching” — and called for

34

the use of original visual aids, memory devices, and just
plain drill. The structure of my own education at Pitt
helped here.

The engineering background has helped, too, in the
development: of accurately oriented marketing literature —
telling the technical story in a word and picture to both a
non—technical as well as a technical audience. Will it have
enough “guts” to appeal to the engineer who reads it?
Will it be too technical (hence, lack impact) for the non-
technical mind? Technical editing applies to advertising,
catalogs, technical data sheets, as well as technical articles.

Basically, I suppose it is appropriate to call my own
engineering training as the communication bridge in deal-
ings with men in other professions.

Engineering Training on the Personal Side

There is another, and ﬁnal, general area where the engi-
neering background has provided much assistance — on
the personal side.

There is a measure of respect that goes with your Degree.
Your job in school has been tough and your counterparts in
other ﬁelds know this — and they respect your accomplish-
ment. It has been a constant source of surprise to me how
that respect on the other side of the desk grows when the
training was revealed —- even when the man across the
desk was, himself, an engineer.

The background has served, too, in understanding other
technologies than my own specialty. Those ﬁrst two years
—— calculus, inorganic chemistry, physics, strength of mate-
rials, even engineering drawing — help in visualizing the
“other guy’s” problem. They’ve helped me gain some
measure of breadth.

The greatest personal value, though, has been the de—
velopment of a mode of thinking. The scientiﬁc discipline,

the knowledge of “where to ﬁnd it,” the accumulated basicxf
facts that are a part of our mental processes provide a goo)"

base for the pyramid of structured problem solution. It 1 ~_

a constant effort to organize and categorize the welter of
unrelated facts met in a day’s work; it is the engineering

thinking process we've gained that tells us where to place
the data. It tells us, too, where there are holes — where to
delegate fact ﬁnding — how much time we should need
for that solution.

Engineering discipline is, truly, the great organizer.

Let me recount. Engineering training has helped me
deal with the practicing engineer and his problems: It has
helped me use the proper channels (the Purchasing Agent):
It has made me a technical “gadfly” on the hindquarters of
internal technical proposals.

Engineering helps in liaison between engineering ideas
and commercial thinking; in training non—technical people

in semi-technical work; in communication via advertising
and product literature.

Personally it has opened doors for me, helped me to
understand other technical ﬁelds than my own. Most of
all, it has helped me become better organized.

Above all, whatever your branch of engineering, what-
ever your direction when you leave Pitt —- I sincerely hope
your career brings the satisfaction that mine has to me.

“I never feel like a rookie”

“Sure I’m new at B&W, but l’ve been too busy to
think about that. I’ve been working in my ﬁeld all
along, and the training sort of blends right in.”

If Randy Trost sounds like a B&W booster, you
should hear what his supervisor says about him.

We're looking for aggressive, talented young engi-
neers like Randy. We want you if you want signiﬁcant
responsibility from the start. In fact, we need more
engineers than ever before. That’s because we’re grow-
ing faster. Sales were $625 million in 1967. Up almost
12 per cent.

That’s how it's been from the beginning. We started

Randy Trost,

out making steam generation equipment. That led to
atomic power stations, nuclear marine propulsion
equipment, refractories, specialty steel, machine tools,
computers, and closed-circuit TV. (And we still make
the best boiler in America.)

If you’d like to talk with Randy Trost about B&W,
call him collect at our facility in Lynchburg, Virginia,
AC 703 846-7361.

In the meantime, be on the lookout for the B&W
recruiter when he visits your campus.

Get the facts on structural design
of Full-Depth {'3 Deep-Strength®AsphaIt
pavements for highways and streets.

A new and modern pavement design system that incor-
porates solutions made from extensive computer analy-
sis, The Asphalt Institute’s method uses data from the
AASHO Road Test, the WASHO Road Test, British road
tests and the in-use experience of several states.

Today. as more states. counties and cities turn to new Full-
Depth @ Asphalt pavement* for all their road needs, there
is a growing demand for engineers with a solid background
in the fundamentals of Asphalt pavement design, technology
and construction.

Start now to prepare yourself.for this challenging future.
Get the latest information on the Thickness Design Method
developed by The Asphalt Institute. This modern method of
structural design is based on extensive evaluations with the
IBM 1620 and the mammoth IBM 7090 computers. How to
use this method is explained in The Asphalt Institute’s Thick-
ness Design Manual (MS-1). This helpful manual and much
other valuable information are included in the free student
library on Asphalt construction and technology now offered.
Write us today.

‘Full-Depth Asphalt pavement is an Asphalt pavement in which asphalt mixtures
are employed for all courses above the subgrade or improved subgrade. Full-Depth
Asphalt pavement is laid directly on the prepared subgrade. TA—a mathematical

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER — FEB. I96‘?

Try your skills at solving these puz-
zles. The ﬁrst person who submits a
list of all the correct answers to these
problems to the oﬂice of the Skyscraper
Engineer, 408 Schenley Hall will re-
ceive ﬁve dollars. All entries must be
on the official entry blank to be con-
sidered. Be sure to have a member of
the staff mark the time your entry was
submitted. In case of duplicate answers,
the earliest time will be considered the
winner. In the event no correct solution
is received, an additional ﬁve dollars
will be added to the prize for the next
issue. Use extra 8‘/2 x 11 paper if neces-
sary for your answers.

09

THIS MONTH’S PUZZLES

1. The Geomeirical Orchard

Show ﬁve ways to plant ten trees in ﬁve rows of four

each.

2. Inexpensive Trick

Place three pennies with two heads on one side of a
line and two tails on the other side of the line.

3. Card Conundrum

Three playing cards, removed from an ordinary bridge
deck, lie face down in a horizontal row. To the right of a
king, there is a queen or two. To the left of a queen there
is a queen or two. To the left of a heart, there is a spade
or two. To the right of a spade, there is a spade or two.
Name the three cards.

4. The Oil Well

An oil well being drilled on a Hat prairie, struck pay
sand at an underground spot exactly 21,000 feet from the
corner of a rectangular plot of farmland 18,000 feet from
the opposite corner and 6,000 feet from a third corner. How
far is the underground spot from the fourth corner?

44

5. Two Triangles

What is the smallest number of matches needed to form
simultaneously, on a plane, two different (noncongruent)
Pythagorean triangles? The matches represent units of
length and must not be broken or split in any way. Show
your solution.

6. The Geomefrical Suifcase

Packing for a trip, you ﬁnd that you have a suitcase
which is cubical, one foot on a side. You also have a package
which is a tetrahedron and you ﬁnd that it exactly ﬁts into
the suitcase. This tetrahedron is, therefore, the largest one
that can be placed into the cube. What is the length of a
side of the tetrahedron?

Since no completely correct solutions were submitted to
December’s Skycapers, the solutions to the six puzzles above
are worth $15. It may be wise to brush up on your geometry
before attempting to solve them.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER — FEB. I969

ANSWERS TO DECEMBER’S PUZZLES

1. 5/12. The probability that both will throw the same
number is 1/16. The probability that one will throw
higher than the other is 5/6 or 10/12. This is halved to
give the probability that Will will get a higher number
than Bill.

2. ONE WORD.

3. 1,000 feet. The ﬁsh makes a right angle turn. A right
‘ angle with its vertex on the circumference of a circle
$ * _ . ' intersects the circumference at the end points of 21 dia—
ﬂ meter and is thus the hypotenuse of a right triangle with
* ‘\' A . sides of 600 and 800 feet.
4. “Everyone” included babies and children.
5. 8 feet.
6. 1 gallon must be drunk leaving 9 to be divided into

X thirds. Since the vessels measured only integral
P, ':  amounts, the beer to be divided into thirds must be a

0’ multiple of three, six or nine gallons. The first two
amounts can be eliminated because in both cases a
third of the amount is less than the capacity of each
vessel. (After any pouring operation, at least one vessel
may be either empty or full.) Neither situation would
QQ occur if each vessel contained less than its capacity. One

gallon must be drunk leaving nine to be divided into
ej thirds.

PAPER TIGERS

Thanks, but they're just not our type.
Young engineers who join us are expected
to move in on some rather formidable
programs. . . with alacrity and lots of
gusto. And a willingness to assume early
responsibilities on demanding assign-
ments is an attribute which we welcome
warmly. it's the kind of engineering ag-
gressiveness that has brought Sikorsky
Aircraft to dominant stature in a new
world of advanced VTOL aircraft systems.

If our criteria parallel your outlook, you'll
find an excellent career environment with
us. You would enjoy working (with a
select group) on exciting, full-spectrum
systems development. And you can watch
your talent and imagination assume
reality in such diverse forms as Heavy-
Lift Skycranes—Tilt Rotor Transports-
High-Speed VTOL Commercial Trans-
ports—and much more for tomorrow.

6%.//,2:/r///,,,, ,

NEED NOT APPLY.

Does this responsibility stir your imagina-
tion? Then you probably should be with
us. There's ample opportunity for innova-
tion in: aerodynamics 0 human factors
engineering o automatic controls o
structures engineering o weight predic-
tion a systems analysis 0 operations
research 0 reliability/maintainability
engineering o autonavigation systems

 FAILURE 

You'll never get anywhere without it.

Nothing helps a young engineer's
career like being given a challenge.
Which is another way of saying a chance
to fail now and then. To make his own
mistakes.

At Western Electric we give our newly
recruited engineers responsibility almost
immediately. They make their own de-
cisions. Learn from their own errors.

Don't get us wrong. We keep our

demands reasonable enough so that our
recruits can make their decisions at their
own pace. But our thinking is, a man
feels awfully good about even a small
decision when it's his.

If you're the type who'd like the chance
to make your own moves, see our recruiter
or write College Relations, 222 Broad-
way, New York, N. Y. 10038.

A lot of hard work never hurt anyone.

The good reverend was making calls. Parking at a down-
town parking meter, he realized he-didn’t have the suitable
change for the meter. Stepping through the nearest door,
he found himself in a topless go—go restaurant.

The topless waitress, trying to cover herself, exclaimed,
“Honest reverend, if I knew you were coming in here I
would have put something on!”

“Think nothing of it,” assured the Reverend. “That’s
your profession and your livelihood. I’m not criticizing.
I just came in to get some parking meter change. Have
you got a pair of nickcls for a dime?”

The mother was cross—examining her lovely daughter.
“Well you went out with another one of those wild Pitt
engineers last night,” she began. “I hope you kept your

class and go for a drive around the town. After lunch,
they reported to their professor that they had a flat tire
on the way to school that morning.
Much to their relief, the prof. smiled understandingly and
said: “You fellows missed a quiz this morning. Please

Seems ridiculous. Maybe it is. But so far we
have found that the official label guides us to
those who have shown they can discern a goal
and not lose their way towards it.

In general, however, the label does not
guarantee a uniform product. That’s good.

It is worn by some who have never dipped
below the ﬁve percentile academically, who
enjoyed doing a paper on the psychodynamic
roots of Buddhist theology almost as much as
they enjoyed constructing ﬁve different ther-
modynamic models of the pulsar phenome-
non. That kind of mind can ﬁnd comparable
fulﬁllment in some problems ultimately in-

(likewise for chemical engineers, electrical engineers, and industrial engineers)

volving our photographic systems, plastics, oz
ﬁbers. Hard to believe but true.

The label is also worn by some who had to
struggle for it because their minds don’t work
the way a professor’s mind works. They are
not unhorsed, however, to learn that some-
times a remark passed casually in a washroom
can accomplish more than a l 17—page techni-
cal report with 50 references in the bibliog-
raphy.

Hope you will drop us a note telling what
kind of mind you have. A wrong answer will
not be held against you.

Dan Johnson has a flair
for making things.

Just ask a certain family in Marrakeck, Morocco.

A solar cooker he helped develop is now making life
a little easier for them—in an area where electricity is
practically unheard of.

The project was part of Dan’s work with VITA
(Volunteers for International Technical Assistance)
which he helped found.

Dan’s ideas have not always been so practical. Like
the candlepowered boat he built at age 10.

But when Dan graduated as an electrical engineer
from Cornell in 1955, it wasn’t the future of candle-
powered boats that brought him to General Electric.
It was the Variety of opportunity. He saw opportunities
in more than 130 “small businesses” that make up Gen-
eral Electric. Together they make more than 200,000
different products.

At GE, Dan is working on the design for a remote
control system for gas turbine powerplants. Some day
it may enable his Moroccan friends to scrap their solar
cooker.

Like Dan Johnson, you’ll find opportunities at Gen-
eral Electric in R&D, design, production and technical
marketing that match your qualiﬁcations and interests.
Talk to our man when he visits your campus. Or write
for career information to: General Electric Company,
Room 80lZ, 570 Lexington Avenue, New York, N. Y.

“There
are lots of

big companies.
What’s so good  
about yours?”

Here’s what: at IH you won’t have to stand
in line waiting for responsibility. You’ll get it.

Right from the start.

And you won’t be pushed into a job
that leads to nowhere.

You’ll move up on your merits. The sooner you can
cut it, the quicker you’ll move.

You see, we’re looking for the thinker. The innovator.
The type of guy who has lots of imagination

and plenty of guts. (It takes guts to make decisions
and stand up for your ideas.)

You’ll have to be on the ball all right. But we’ll
give you plenty in return.

For one thing, we’re diversiﬁed. You’ll ﬁnd all kinds
of action in steelmaking, motor trucks,

construction or farm equipment. And lots of things in
research and development. (We’ve got some far-out
ideas on laser beam construction equipment,

solar energy and nuclear power.)

In other words, we’re working on things that should
shape the future. Yours and ours.

So talk to your campus placement ofﬁcer
about us. He’ll give you the word on the jobs we have
in engineering, accounting, production
management and sales.

Sure, we’re a big company. But we’re big in
a lot more ways than just size.
