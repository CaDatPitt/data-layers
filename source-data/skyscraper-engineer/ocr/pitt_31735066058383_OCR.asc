Science Article

by Maurice Rickard

This is a generic science article. A/though quality and
consistency may vary, this article is suitable for normal use.

Like the improvement of the calculator over the slide
rule, like that of the washing machine over the washboard,
like houses over draughty little lean-to’s in the great out-
doors, comes the improvement of a revolutionary new
development over its predecessor. Indeed, this revolu-
tionary development is considered to rank alongside the
latest revolutionary developments in the fields of lobster
dentures and retina implants.

This revolutionary development has been in the works
for some time now, but has only recently attracted national
attention as it nears its mass distribution. As a member
of the staff of this magazine, I was privileged to find out
more about this project, known in scientific circles as “the
project.”

This revolutionary development is based upon the Smith
Principle, which was discovered during the late '70s dur-
ing the correlation of data from and extensive battery of
atom probe tests. The Smith Principle (so named because
Professor J. Smith was a scientist who-recognized the cor-
relation known as the Smith Principle) pushes back the
limits of current theories of the composition of matter, the
nature and conservation of energy, fluid behavior, or
gravitation.

Before this project, there was a limit to what one could
do. It could take weeks, even months to complete things.
Now one can do them much more accurately and have
the results in a few hours. With certain applications, one
can do, for example, five times as much in twice the time.

Now, Professor Smith, working closely with this univer-
sity, has opened up a whole new field embracing
technological developments from such diverse fields as
automation, artificial intelligence, thermodynamics, quan-
tum physics, and dental hygiene. Claims Prof. Smith,
“We’ve opened up a whole new field.” Although it is unof-
ficial yet, it will probably be visible from an elevation of
approximately ten degrees above the Southern horizon
some time next year.

Funding, of course, was a problem. The team had to
sell equipment from a neighborhood laboratory, doubtless-
ly sending that field’s research back a number of years.
“We couldn’t have done it without a tremendous amount
of volunteer work,” claims Prof. Smith. The next step in-
volved developing computer simulations of rats, testing
various hypotheses until they found the one that worked.
“Of course,” Prof. Smith said, “we wouldn’t dream of per-
forming the experiment on humans. The risk factor is cur-
rently just to high.” Using a computer, he was able to
falsify documents to the extent that the above statement
appears true.

This revolutionary development may have been widely
implemented by the Aztecs before Cortez. This revolu-
tionary development was predicted in a short story
published by Isaac Asimov/Arthur C. Clarke in the early
'50s.

Although many such devices are just too costly and im-
practicle for widespread use, Professor Smith’s team has

tried to keep this device from continuing this trend. Its

measurements are approximately 35.27x93.501x6.8. It
weighs nearly 12,000 when empty, and a little over 4 when
full. This development makes relatively heavy use of the
Dieter und Michael Corporation’s 1-bit nondirectional shift
registers, the data sheet for which is featured elsewhere
in this magazine.

I talked to a prominent member of the academic com-
munity, who said that it was too early to tell, but word has
it that there are a number of personal, non-industrial areas
in which this could be used. Scientists postulate that within
ten to fifteen years, everyone will own one, or at least be
able to watch them being used over their flat-screen TVs.

The implications for industry are staggering.

The implications for the military are staggering.

Scientists speculate that 3x + 7°/o of all implications of
this project are staggering, resulting in the approximate
graph in figure 4.3.

Naturally, given a certain set of other conditions that
could conceivably cause the x values to increase, we
would expect to see the graph shift to the right, as
depicted in figure 1.7.

One major feature of the project is its incorporation of
the often-overlooked Chang multiplier, e " +1, into the
n-1 functions bank. With this feature, (6x + 22 + * )°/o
of all equations entered in this bank will be automatically
multiplied by the Chang multiplier, its seventh root, or its
cube. Before this project, these values could only be ob-
tained by radiotelegraph relay from a small weather sta-
tion inside the Arctic Circle. Clearly, this is not only a boon
to the user, it is also a boon to Chang, who is said to be
getting rather tired of answering the phone and giving out
the same multiplier upwards of 4nc., times a day.

‘‘It is entirely possible that it would be reasonably unlike-
ly that there is a partially unvarying level of certainty per-
taining to the material that may be processed by the pro-
ject over a relatively certain indefinite period of time.”

Scientists speculate that eventually, it will be simplified
to the point that almost anyone could use it without leav-
ing their beds. In fact, it has been postulated by in-
vestigators working for the Jones Foundation that the pro-
ject might be ideally suited to bed usage, which was clear-
ly shown by an experiment I was able to witness.

As all engineers know, data sets such as that for the
flux of negatively aligned anisotropic recombinant
electron-hole pairs are incredibly difficult to calculate,
much less plot and find appropriate uses for. The experi-
ment, conducted by Prof. Smith and Doctor P. Johnson,
consisted of the project itself, 7 sets of auxiliary equip-
ment believed to have cost in excess of 3.6, a smattering
of faceless, nameless members of the academic com-
munity who asked not to be identified, and a number of
mattresses. The mattresses were distributed evenly about
the room, which measured 9 by 3,762. The faceless,
nameless members of the academic community and a
proportion of rhesus monkeys were outfitted with tables
of raw data pertaining to the flux of negatively aligned
anisotropic recombinant electron-hole pairs and told to
raise their arms, slide their wallets across the floor, and
back away slowly. This was accomplished in 2.78, a fear-
some accomplishment by any means. The subjects were
then told to lie on the mattresses face down and scream
muffled data and instructions in hope that these would be
sorted out by the time the central processor got hold of
them.

accuracy of the results of the experiment taken against
a control of firemen, gradeschool children, and, surpris-
ingly, the researchers themselves.

The probability of this occurring is found by calculating
the following integral and graphing the result over a cylin-
drical coordinate system, then dividing the result by the
average wavelength of light (in Angstroms) of the even-
ing sky from one month to another. Prof. Smith believes
this is an exercise best left to the academically inclined,
the curious, the pathologically insane.

Another useful experiment was performed to test the
effect of temperature on the relative coefficient of bifur-
cation in a controlled system in which the project was an
inherent part. In this experiment, the inherent bifurcation
of the delayed interactive feedback system between units
defined as “users” and a series of radioactive pastry
dishes was read and plotted at an interpretive level using
the project to calculate the point of maximum extension,
which is often seen as the fulcrum of such a system. By
feeding consumption and infrared and background radia-
tion levels into the project through the RS232 ports, it was
possible to arrange the data into the easily-interpreted
graph in figure 11.001.

Given examples like these, it is clear that there is a pro-
found need for this development in the scientific, in-
dustrial, and educational communities. It is for this reason
that Prof. Smith firmly believes that with the proper fun-
ding, this project could become a sizeable expenditure
for the free world, citing the fact that the Soviets have
spent at least five hundred billion on theirs.

Perhaps the most important part of this project is its
potential for future growth. Asked about possible
developments from the project in the future, Prof. Smith
says, “Some day, we’d like to find out. Right now, no one
knows.” Those of us at this magazine know how wise
these words are. Clearly, this is a project that will be
remembered for all time.

Thump, thumpa-whap! Thump, thumpa-whappa-whappa!
You’re sitting with your date at a local club — but not for

long. The five-member band has just walked up on the stage,
the white lights go down as the colored lights sparkle on,
and a sharp, syncopated drum beat begins thundering out
of two banks of speakers. You soon join others moving__=_
toward the dance floor and start stepping and spinning 
the fast-paced music. The musicians are all busily creafinﬁ
their art —— a bassist, a guitarist, a vocalist, a saxophor;

player, a keyboard player and a  a  hmm, they certainly 

have their drummer well hidden. impossibly well hidden, it
seems. Then your wandering eyes spot a small black box
with the words “drum computer” emblazoned on it in silver
letters.

But this simply can’t be! A computer — that static, imper-
sonal machine that achieves unending delight in frustrating
engineering students — is drumming? As you puzzle over
this perplexing (and rather discomforting) thought, the
pitched percussive tones of a xylophone begin a rapid arpeg-
gio — but the notes are sounding as the keyboardist’s fingers
tap the keys of the instrument-before him. Then there’s a
rather peculiar sound that is something like a trumpet, only
it appears that it's being produced by the guitarist. Next, the
keyboardist sets three fingers down on a second keyboard,
and it begins to sing!

Ruling out magic of some sort, it appears that these
machines are wielding some rather sophisticated technology
in the production of their art.

Music today is an art increasingly making use of and be-
ing influenced by technology, particularly electronic and com-
puter technology. This is found in many areas — in the crea-
tion of music, its performance and the manner by which it
reaches its audience. Consider the impact that radio and
audio recording have had. Of all the music you have heard
in your lifetime, how much of it has passed directly from an
acoustic instrument to your ears? Unless you play an
acoustic instrument (or happen to live near someone who
does), probably the vast majority of the music you have heard
has been produced by a speaker cone or the membrane of
a headphone. This is almost certainly the case even if your
musical tastes lie exclusively in the area of classical music
or acoustic folk music. Electronics has continued the mar-
riage of sound and recording engineering begun by Thomas
Edison in 1877, and has allowed an incredible variety of
music to reach a worldwide audience.

The focus of this article, however, is not on means of sound
reproduction and transmission, rich though these topics are,
but rather on sound production by electronic means — elec-
tronic music synthesis. It is here that is found perhaps the
most musically creative and directly artistic union of music
and technology.

The Sound of Music

Why create music electronically? Let’s first take a look at
what sound production of any sort entails, and then it should
become clearer why electrical engineering and music have
come to be on such friendly terms.

Sound is a longitudinal pressure wave in a substance
( most familiarly, air), but, naturally, if you have diligently

characteristics of their strument 

per second. Only air pressure variat 
be perceived by humans as sound. "  _
This process of air being moved arouno‘r;v- 
oscillator is far from simple, simply because 
most musically interesting mechanical oscillators is quite
complex. When a sound is produced by mechanical means,
the result is virtually never a pure sine waveform. (A tuning
fork is one example of a mechanical oscillator that does pro-
duce nearly a pure sinusoidal sound wave.) A string
stretched between two points and set into motion, as when
a bow is dragged across a violin string, actually can be
regarded as vibrating at a number of different frequencies
simultaneously — its total motion, which can be very com-
plicated, is the sum of these simpler modes of vibration.
Similarly, the non-sine wave pressure waves produced by
striking middle C on a piano contain a series of sine wave
components. These individual components of the sound are
called partials, and include a set of frequencies, the lowest
of which is called the fundamental or first partial, the others
are called overtones or upper partials. (Overtones are
tones of higher frequency than the fundamental.) If the fre-
quencies of the overtones are integral multiples of the fun-
damental, as they often are, they are then called harmonics.
The fundamental frequency is then called the first harmonic;
the component with twice the fundamental frequency is the
second harmonic, and so on. It is the frequency of the fun-
damental that we associate with the pitch of the note being
played — the fundamental tells us whether the note is a C
or a G or a D. It is the strengths of the upper partials or har-
monics that provide each instrument with its unique sound
or timbre. Suppose a trumpet and a clarinet both play the
same steady note with the same loudness. We still perceive
that the sounds — timbres — are different, due to the dif-
ferent levels of overtones produced by each instrument.

The above discussion should sound hauntingly familiar to
those who know something about Jean Baptiste Joseph
Fourier and his work. Fourier was an early nineteenth cen-
tury mathematician who showed that any regularly repeating
function can be represented as a sum of sine waves (possibly
an infinite number of them) whose frequencies are integral
multiples of the lowest frequency present. It just so happens
that many musical instruments produce complex but fairly
repeating sound waves; hence, these waves can be
mathematically represented by a group of sine waves with
frequencies at integral multiples of the lowest frequency. This
is not just mathematical slight-of-hand; it is musically signifi-
cant because the ear performs just this sort of Fourier
analysis. A complex sound waveform is separated into its
individual frequency components in the cochlea. Thus dif-
ferent nerve fibers in the cochlea are stimulated by different
frequencies of sound.

A simple example should help to clarify these concepts.
Figure 1a shows that familiar friend, Ye Olde Sine Wave. This
particular sine wave has a frequency of 440 hertz (cycles per
second) and an amplitude of one. If this wave represented
variations in air pressure, it would have a sound similar to
that produced by a tuning fork — an example of a mechanical
oscillator that, unlike most musical instruments, produces
a nearly pure fundamental tone with no overtones. In this
case, we would find the pitch of the tone to be the A above
middle C.

Figure 1.

Figure 1b shows a sine wave at double the frequency of
the first one (880 Hz), with an amplitude of 0.5. If we were
to listen to this waveform by itself, it would sound like a
somewhat quieter tuning fork with a pitch one octave above
the one discussed above. (Any note one octave higher than
another has a fundamental frequency double that of the lower
note.) But suppose we mix the waveforms of Figures 1a and
1b together. The resulting waveform is shown in Figure 1c.
if we were to listen to this waveform, we would say it had
the pitch of the A above middle C — the pitch of the lower
component — but it would sound decidedly different than
our A — above-midd|e—C tuning fork because of the presence
of the 880 Hz overtone — the timbre of the tone is now dif-
ferent. We could now mix in a second overtone with a fre-
quency of 1320 Hz (three times the fundamental frequency
of 440 Hz) and an amplitude of, say, 0.7. This component
is shown in Figure 1d; the result of mixing all three com-
ponents (partials) together is shown in Figure 1e. Once again,
this sound would have a pitch of A above middle C, but its
timbre would be different from either 1a or 1c.

In a typical musical instrument, the mixture of fundamen-
tal frequency and overtones can be extremely complex. The
relative amplitudes of the overtones for the lowest G of a
piano is shown in Figure 2. Each of the vertical bars in this
graph represents the amplitude of one sine wave component
of the piano’s total waveform. Here, the loudest component
of the sound is not the fundamental, but the third partial. (In
a piano, we must use the more general term “partial” rather
than “harmonic”, since the overtones are not exact integral
multiples of the fundamental frequency, especially for the
higher overtones. This phenomenon has its physical basis
in the stiffness of the wires used in the piano.) To complicate
matters still more, Figure 2 is simply a graph of the maximum
loudness each partial reaches over the course of a note. But
all the partials do not rise and fall in the same manner. As
a hammer in a piano strikes the strings, the overall sound
quickly reaches a maximum intensity, then gradually dies
away. Each partial, however, is continually varying in
loudness during the time that a note is sounded, as shown

logarithmic measure of amplitude: if one tone is 10

measured as a value down from zero.

more than just the five shown in Figure 3) of sine waves at
the proper frequencies with each of their amplitudes vary-
ing in the proper way would give us a sound very much like
a piano note. The more partials we included in the sum, the
closer we’d come to the sound of the piano. All of this com-
plexity helps to explain why musical instruments typically
have such a rich and pleasing sound, and therefore why peo-
ple generally would rather listen to pianos than to tuning
forks.

Often, a large part of an instrument is devoted to “shap-
ing” the overtones in order to create a certain sound. The
body of a violin, cello or guitar takes complex vibrations from
a string and emphasizes certain harmonics (a phenomenon
known as resonance) while suppressing others. It then
transmits these modified vibrations to the air as sounds
recognizable as violin sounds, cello sounds or guitar sounds.

The importance of overtones to the quality of sounds is
dramatically demonstrated any time one has a common cold
with a stuffy nose. Unless your vocal cords are also affected,
they still vibrate just as they would if you didn’t have a cold.
Yet you sound “nasal.” Normally, the sinuses (hollow spaces

in the bones of the face) act to alter the air vibrations pro-
duced by the vocal cords — emphasizing or diminishing cer-
tain frequencies in a manner analogous to the effect of a
guitar body. If the sinuses are blocked, properties change
— the resultant mix of overtones you produce is different,
and your friend on the other end of the phone knows you
have a cold. Similarly, if you stuff a towel into a guitar, it will
sound different, too, since its resonances (and hence its over-
tones) will have been altered.

One other aspect of musical sound has been alluded to
but deserves particular mention — amplitude. We are typical-
ly aware of the overall amplitude of the music we hear,
perhaps even regulating it by turning a volume control up
or down. But each individual note produced by an instrument
must go from silence to audibility and back to silence in some
way. The piano, as mentioned above, has hammers which
strike strings. The piano note thus rises quickly to a peak
amplitude, then decays away more slowly. As described
above, each component of an instrument’s sound rises and
falls somewhat differently from the others, but we can draw
a graph of the amplitude of the resulting complex sound wave
produced when all the components are added together.
Figure 4a shows a rough graph of a clarinet waveform from
the moment the note is sounded. Figure 4b shows the
amplitude of this waveform over the same time interval. This
graph is known as the amplitude envelope, since it outlines
or envelopes the actual waveform.

Benedum at Night

text and photos by Lisa Rodriguez

Everyone knows what goes on in Benedum Hall during
the day: classes, tests, seminars, studying. But does
anyone really know what goes on late at night?

Anyone who has been in engineering for any length of
time knows that “late at night” does not mean “from 10
p.m. ’ti| midnight.” The phrase translates into something
closer to “early the next morning”, or “somewhere around
two or four a.m.”

Not everything that happens at this hour is what can
be considered normal Benedum behavior. Yes, there is
still a lot of studying going on, but as the hours drag on,
even the most dedicated students can get frustrated. They
start pulling out their hair, or hiding, or acting weird, or
falling asleep. Yet, as long as that engineering work needs
to be done, they will not go home. They will stay and stay,
and stay...

If you would like to become one of the late night die-
hard studiers, here is an approximate time table for B.E.H.
after hours. You wouldn't want to miss any of the exciting
parts.

Die-hard studiers start showing up and competing for
classrooms and lounges. Normal average students go

People studying in B.E.H. call people studying in

Return from snack and/or drink, continue work.

Students turn lights back on, using main switchboxes

Anytime here is time to take a break, get some pop

skateboard around the halls, go see who else is
here, take a nap, throw your book across the room,
get a (nother) drink, or start a fight as to whose
answer is right, scream, or just go home.

For some unexplained reason, all of the exhaust fans
turn off and the entire building becomes quiet as a
tomb.

For some equally unexplained reason, all of the ex-
haust fans turn back on. The maintenance and clean-
ing people show up to start maintaining and cleaning.
Professors and students start showing up.

Classes start again. The die-hard studiers who have
not gone home already either go to the class or go
home to sleep through their classes. When the sun
goes down, they will return.

Cooks You May

Have Missed

Winner’s

For those of you who have got the cafeteria blues and
are tired of the plain burgers, the cold soggy french fries,
and cardboard pizza, I have a new restaurant for you to
try. Winner’s is a new oriental restaurant opened last
September. It is located under Sheetz on Forbes Ave., and
is open from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday through
Wednesday, 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Thursday through
Saturday, and 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Sunday.

At first, I thought, ‘what kind of restaurant would be
located in the basement of Sheetz?’ To my surprise it is
a very clean and cozy location for a restaurant. It seems
to be a nice place tp take a date if you want to get away
from the crowd and just be alone for a while to talk.

I know what you are thinking now, ‘What do they serve
and for how much?’ Well, lets take that question
backwards. The prices vary from $1.00 to around $4.00
for the main dishes. This is very competitive with many
other fast food places in the area.

In the way of what they serve, Winner’s lets you experi-
ment, by offering dishes from yakimandoo (fried oriental
dumplings) to some more common ones like sushi, and
won ton soup. Most of the dishes are cooked with orien-
tal vegetables and served with rice. You always have a
choice between white or fried rice.

The two most popular dishes are the bulgogi, and the
chop chae. The bulgogi, which is what I had, is a large
portion of sliced pieces of steak cooked on the grill, and
served with vegetables, and rice. It can also come with
spicy vegetables that are extremely hot. The other popular
dish, the chop chae, is a combination of cellophane
noodles, vegetables, and strips of beef cooked together,
and, of course, rice.

And for you busy people that cannot take time out to
go to a restaurant, Winner’s offers a carry out, so that you
can carry on with your busy life without interrupting it. For
just these types of people who may happen to be domestic
beer drinkers, Winner’s has a cooler stocked with most
of the major domestic brands of beer. Winner’s, unlike
the “O” where you will have to wait to even get close
enough to the bar to get beer to go, offers fast service,
and small, if any, lines. They also advertise the “lowest
price beer.” For those of you who would prefer a pop, in
the true native Pittsburgh dialect, or soda to the rest of
you, they carry most of the major brands of these items
also.

So I recommend that you stop in at Winner’s. Find out
what the place is like. Maybe you will be as pleasantly sur-
prised as I was with the place.

Winner’s offers a wide selection of domestic beers as

well as its fine Chinese dishes.

welcome to the

by Sanjfv Gupta

Step aboard the complex plane, ladies and gentlemen. Allow
the stewardess to show you to your seat. We ’ll be leaving the
time domain shortly, so fasten your seatbelts.

The phasor domain.

lt’s a mysterious region, not part of the real world, where
electrical engineers play.

Those EEs are a pretty strange lot. I know; I’m one of
them. Let me explain.

We’ve got to take a course called EE41, in which we
learn boatloads of exciting things like, for example, why
EE31 was a complete waste of time. lt’s comforting to
know that there’s always an easier way to do something,
I just wish they’d tell me about it sooner. ln EE41 we
discover that the skull-thickening tedium of EE31 wasn’t
necessary because, under certain conditions (all of the
important ones, it so happens) there is an easier way to
do what we were doing. Nevertheless, I was glad to hear
that a simpler method exists.

But, of course, there’s a catch.

The “simple” method involves complex numbers. For
the uninitiated (i.e. -- the lucky few), this is not a com-

plex number: if

The harmless looking beastie is:
4+3i

If that stupid  wasn’t there, this particular number
would be seven. I like that. I can count to seven, have
seven pencils, or kill seven small rabbits and turn them
inside out. But the  is there, so I guess we’ll have to
deal with it. I could, perhaps, erase it, but this is not the
generally accepted solution, at least not for mathemati-
cians, engineers and other people who enjoy making life
more complex than it really is.

The horrifying truth is that  stands for the square root
of negative one: ‘

i: ( _ 1)/2

14

Phosor Domoin

This is quite disturbing, to say the least.

Incidentally, before I go on I should point out that EEs
like to call it  This is done because the concept of the
square root of negative one wasn’t confusing enough for
them, so they decided to muck things up even further by
going against everyone else’s convention. The official ex-
cuse is that i is reserved for current, but this is clearly
nonsense since they could just as easily have changed
current toj and confused a lot less people since no one
but EEs care about current. It makes no difference
anyway, because we are dealing with the name of
something that can’t possibly exist in the first place.

Ordinary people are not in the habit of giving names
to things that don’t exist. Electrical engineers do this sort
of thing frequently.

Returning to our subject, i. Since, by definition, i2 is
negative one, a person should be able to draw a square
of length i on each side, measure the area and find it to
be minus one. So far, I have been largely unsuccessful
at accomplishing this particular task. In fact, it doesn’t take
much effort to realize that the whole concept is nonsen-
sical. You can’t put anything in a box of volume — i (length
i on each side), so what good is it?

Complex numbers were okay back in the days when
nobody talked about them except old, bald mathemati-
cians behind closed doors. Old, bald mathematicians talk
about all sorts of insane things behind closed doors, and
nobody pays much attention because they don’t hurt
anyone (except, maybe, themselves).

I don’t know how the EEs found out about i, but things
have sure never been the same since. After promptly
renaming this non-entity  they proceeded to search
for a way to apply it to the real world. Most of us would
have simply thrown it out the window. After all, it doesn’t
do the wash, it doesn’t descramble HBO, it doesn’t slice,
it doesn’t dice and it doesn’t chop. In fact, it doesn’t do
anything at all except sit there and be impossible.

After considerable effort, and undoubtedly a few hard
drinks, someone concluded that EE31 could be rendered
useless by judicious application of j. EE31 is still taught,
of course, because the EE department wants students to
take them seriously before introducing j.

Naturally, it couldn’t be printed up in books until they
thought of a name for this new branch of EE involving
complex numbers. Tradition dictates that the name has
absolutely nothing to do with the subject matter, so one
day, while watching a “Star Trek” episode, an EE hit upon
the idea of using j in something called the “phasor do-
main.”

I won’t attempt to explain phasors in detail; you wouldn’t
want me to. If for some reason you really care, take EE
41 or dress up as a Klingon and stroll nonchalantly into
Star Fleet Headquarters. Crudely, though, phasors are a
way of removing the difficult and confusing time depen-
dent integro-differential equations from the solution pro-
cedures of certain circuits and replacing them by even
more difficult and confusing complex numbers. These
complex numbers are called phasors, because EEs can’t
call them complex numbers like everyone else does.

Removing time dependency from the solution is really
helpful (“it just drops out,” as we are repeatedly told)
because it makes it perfectly clear that the solution isn’t
obvious at all.

It looks neat, too. I like impressing non-EEs with big
equations like this one:

vi : -’iLI_r 4+_j—4L—U 2 it
‘*2 4-:;iw:~2+8~=iiu—vr~+8 2  *2

I haven't the slightest idea of what it means (nobody
else does, either), but it sure looks like it ought to do
something impressive. Notice that it’s got a lot of those
big square brackets in it that usually signify that some
dreadfully complicated math follows.

This is the sort of thing that goes on all the time in the
phasor domain; it’s what EEs thrive on. By now you pro-
bably think that electrical engineers are a bunch of mess-
ed up specimens. I strongly suspect that you’re right, but
who am I to say?

We are now in the complex phasor domain. You may
have noticed that the hands of your watch have been
replaced by a pair of rotating vectors, one of which lags
the other by 90°. Don’t be alarmed, this is perfectly
abnormal.

Enter Electrical Engineering

By now it should be pretty clear that the sound produced
by musical instruments is very complex. This imposes a dif-
ficult task on an instrument designer, since he or she is
faced with such a large number of qualities of sound which
must be precisely controlled. It is quite difficult, for exam-
ple, to build a mechanical oscillator with a specified set of
overtones. Antonio Stradivari was an early eighteenth cen-
tury violin maker who used combinations of materials that
produced such a wonderfully sounding instrument that for
200 years instrument makers have been studying his tech-
niques. Yet another difficulty is that mechanical sound pro-
ducers must be physically altered in order to change the
sound produced. A large change of timbre thus requires a
change in the size or shape of the instrument, or the material
out of which it is constructed. Wouldn't it be nice to have
a relatively simple way to generate and control any sound
wave imaginable?

Well, the past six decades of electrical engineering have
been largely devoted to discovering how to precisely con-
trol electrical signals. The loudspeaker and other elec-
tromechanical energy converters allow electrical signals to
produce air pressure variations (sound waves). Put the last
two sentences together and — Bingo! — you’ve got elec-
tronic synthesis of music.

The world of electrical signals is divided into two main com-
ponents: analog and digital. Analog signals vary continuously
over a given range and convey information through their in-
stantaneous values. Digital signals typically can take on on-
ly two functional values, such as +5 volts or 0 volts. They
communicate information not continually through their instan-

taneous values, but rather through the pattern of values they
take on over time — the sequence of voltages + 5, + 5, 0,
+ 5 might represent the binary number 1101 (in decimal, 13);
it is this number, 13, that is significant, not the exact value
of 5.00 volts. Beyond being types of signals, these two terms
encompass two distinct but related fields of electrical
engineering, each with its own techniques of analysis and
design. Today, digital signals and the circuits which generate
and regulate them are the foundation of computers and
microprocessors. Historically, however, analog things
generally preceeded digital, so let's look at analog ap-
proaches to music synthesis first.

Analog Audio

Let’s begin synthesizing music, or some semblance
thereof. First, we’ll need an oscillator. Since we’ve moved
from the world of plucked strings to the realm of silicon
charge carriers, we employ a transistor and a few resistors
and capacitors to build an audio oscillator. Assume the par-
ticular one we’ve constructed has as an output a 440 Hz sine
wave. Let’s also include a switch (perhaps disguised as a
key on a keyboard) that allows us to turn the oscillator on
and off. The output of the oscillator is then connected to an
audio amplifier and speaker. What we now have is shown
in the block diagram of Figure 6a.

Figure 6. Ultimately basic analog music synthesizer with
associated waveforms. When the switch is closed, a 440
Hz sine wave of arbitrary amplitude 1.0 is produced.

Voila! An analog music synthesizer. Unfortunately, the
music produced by this system would sound like Morse code
on A — we only have one note, one timbre (a tuning fork
sine wave), and simple on-off control of the amplitude. The
output waveform and amplitude envelope of this simple cir-
cuit are shown in Figures 6b and 6c.

The first improvement that comes to mind is to provide
more notes. In a standard equal-tempered musical scale, the
fundamental frequency of any note is 2"‘? times the fun-
damental frequency of the note immediately below it. Mid-
dle C has a frequency of 261.6 Hz, thus C sharp has a fre-
quency of 261.6x2"‘2, which is 277.2 Hz. Likewise, D has a
frequency of 277.2x2"‘? or 293.7 Hz. If you keep doing this
a few more times, you'll get a value of exactly 440 Hz for
the A above middle C (an international standard.) A few more
multiplications by 2"‘? and you’ll find that the fundamental
frequency of the C an octave above middle C is 523.3 Hz,

16

twice the frequency of middle C. (We mentioned before that
an octave represents a doubling of frequency. If you’re
familiar with the musical scale, you know that a note an oc-
tave above another is twelve notes above the lower note.
Therefore to get the frequency of the higher note, one
multiplies the frequency of the lower note twelve times by
2"”, which is the same as multiplying by two.)

Those of you that are astute mathematicians realize now
that the increase in frequency as we move up the scale is
exponential in nature. Suppose we design our sine wave
oscillator circuit so that its frequency can be controlled by
an applied voltage; specifically, we make the output frequen-
cy an exponential function of the control voltage. This now
gives us tremendous power — we can now directly regulate
a sound parameter (frequency) with electrical engineering’s
favorite servant, the voltage signal. What’s more, the ex-
ponential frequency-voltage relationship implies that in order
to generate a series of frequencies related by a common
multiplicative factor (21/12), we need to generate a series of
evenly spaced control voltages. This is really easy to do:
Figure 7a shows a simple way to go about it using a fixed
voltage source and a voltage divider circuit. The voltage from
each branch of the divider is now fed to a different key-switch.
Pressing a key on our keyboard — say, the A above middle
C — now applies a voltage to the voltage controlled oscillator
(VCO), which is adjusted so as to produce the correct fre-
quency for this note, 440 Hz. Thanks to the exponential fre-
quency relationship, the value of the resistors in our voltage
divider can be chosen so that pressing any other key on our
keyboard results in the correct frequency for that note, too.

Figure 7. (a) shows a resistive voltage divider that pro-
duces n output voltages spaced 1/n volts apart. At (b),
each of the outputs from a voltage divider made up of
41 resistors (not shown) is fed to one of 41 key-switches
on a three and one-half octave keyboard. The other sides
of all 41 switches are connected together. This common
line conducts a control voltage (chosen by depressing
a key on the keyboard) to the control voltage input of the
VCO, which has an exponential frequency-voltage rela-
tionship. (In the frequency equation of the VCO, f is the
VCO’s output frequency, Vc is the control votage, and
A and B are constants chosen so as to set the frequen-
cy range of the keyboard and to produce a standard
equal-tempered musical scale with a frequency ratio of
2"” between successive notes.)

Our improved analog synthesizer is shown in Figure 7b. This
simple circuit can actually make music, of sorts, and might
sound something like a toy organ. One major drawback is
that only one note can be played at a time — our instrument
is monophonic. (An instrument such as a piano that can
sound more than one note at a time is termed polyphonic).
We’ll forego discussing how to make a polyphonic instrument
until we look at digital synthesis. Another limitation is that
only simple on-off control of the note amplitude is possible:
when a key is pressed, the note immediately reaches max-
imum loudness, and when the key is released the note
abruptly stops. As shown in Figures 4b and 5, musical in-
struments produce varied patterns of amplitude attack and
decay. Let’s now provide the same capability for our system.

As mentioned previously, electrical engineering can readily
manipulate simple voltage signals. It is a fairly easy task to
generate voltages that look pretty much like the graphs in
Figures 4b and 5. The circuit that does this is termed an
envelope generator. What is now needed is a way to use
these voltage signals to control the amplitude of the sine
waves generated by the VCO, and this is provided by a
voltage controlled amplifier (VCA). Just as the VCO uses a
voltage to control its frequency, the VCA uses a voltage to
control its degree of amplification. Apply a small voltage to
the VCA’s control voltage input and its gain (degree of
amplification) is very small; apply a large control voltage and
its gain will be high. The net result is shown in Figure 8. The
VCA multiplies the signal from the VCO by the amplitude
envelope voltage waveform, and we get as output a sine
wave whose amplitude varies with time. Setting the envelope
generator (Figure 8) for a fast attack time and slow decay
time results in a sound very much like that produced when
a tuning fork is struck.

We’ve left the most complicated area for last — how do
we now generate timbres other than a simple sine wave. Two
approaches are possible. One technique is to add more sine
waves in order to directly add overtones. This method is
called additive synthesis. The other technique is to start with
a waveform that has many overtones and selectively remove
or reduce overtones until we achieve the sound we’re after.
This approach is called subtractive synthesis and, although
it might at first appear to be a more complicated approach
to the problem than additive synthesis, it is the method that
is most widely employed in analog synthesis.

17

Let’s examine additive synthesis first. First, take another
look at Figure 3. The simple synthesizer depicted ‘in Figure
8 could at best produce only one of these five partials. To
do this we'd need to generate, say, the graph shown in
Figure 3a with our envelope generator. We would now have
our first partial — simply a sine wave that rises and falls as
shown in Figure 3a for each key on our keyboard. Now we
add a second circuit just like Figure 8, but this circuit has
its VCO adjusted so as to have exactly twice the output fre-
quency for each note as the first circuit. We make the
envelope generator of this second circuit produce a voltage
that looks like Figure 3b, and we now have generated our
second partial. This process must be repeated for each par-
tial we wish to add; referring to Figure 2, it's clear that lots
and lots of circuits like Figure 8 are going to be required
(Figure 9). Furthermore, if we want a really general method
of synthesis, we need a way to vary each partia|’s amplitude
envelope depending on what key is pressed. You’ll notice
that Figure 3 shows the amplitude variations of the first five
partials only for the lowest C on the piano. Other notes will
have slightly different variations in their partials.

Figure 9. Circuit to create the first three partials of a
piano’s lowest C (Figure 3). VCO 2 is set so as to always
produce approximately twice the frequency of VCO 1;
VCO 3 is set at about three times VCO 1’s frequency. For
low C, the frequencies of VCO’s 1, 2 and 3 are approx-
imately 32.7, 65.4 and 98.1 Hz respectively. The envelope
generators are set to create the amplitude functions
given in Figures 3a, 3b and 3c. The mixer sums all the
outputs of the VCAs: the result is an approximation to
a piano tone. For a more accurate piano sound, more
VCO-VCA-envelope generator combinations would have
to be added to generate additional partials. Furthermore,
the envelope generator functions will be different for
notes other than low C.

We now have a situation where many things must be con-
trolled simultaneously — this can get complicated for analog
systems, but is precisely what digital computers are
marvelously adept at doing. We’ll therefore examine additive
synthesis further when we look at digital systems.

Subtractive synthesis depends on the generation of
waveforms with lots of harmonics that can then be shaped
as we wish. Plenty of simple waveforms can be decomposed
into large numbers of sine waves (harmonics). Two often
used harmonically rich waveforms which are relatively sim-
ple to generate with electronic circuitry are the square wave
and the sawtooth wave. Figure 10 shows these waveforms
and the strengths of their harmonics. |t’s interesting to note
that the square wave has only odd partials. Square waves
typically sound “reedy.” Clarinets, for example, produce
much stronger odd harmonics than even harmonics. We now
design our VCO so that it can produce these waveforms in

Whatever the output, the same exponential frequency-
versus-control voltage relationship is maintained.

The other element needed for subtractive synthesis a way
to control the strengths of these harmonics. A filter ac-
complishes this. The filter is a circuit that alters the strengths
of signals passing through it depending on their frequencies.
Probably the most familiar examples of filters are the base
and treble controls on a stereo. By adjusting these controls
we can let greater amounts of low-frequency signals flow to
the amplifier (by turning up the bass) or increase the level
of high-frequency signals (by turning up the treble). An even
more sophisticated filter is the graphic equalizer — those

stereo components with ten or twelve slide controls that allow
the listener to increase or decrease the levels of narrow
bands of frequencies. Some of these devices even have bars
of lights that light up like a bar graph in order to indicate the
amount of signals of certain frequencies passing through the
system.

A filter’s properties are characterized by a graph that
shows its gain as a function of frequency. (For those who
have studied Bode plots of transfer functions this should be
a familiar concept. A Bode magnitude plot is a relatively quick
way of sketching the gain-versus-frequency response of a
system such as a filter). One simply multiplies the amplitude
of the input signal to the filter times the gain at the input fre-
quency in order to get the amplitude of the output. This, of
course, only holds true for sine waves, since any other signal
is not at one pure frequency, but actually contains a mixture
of sine wave components of different frequencies. A typical
filter characteristic curve is shown in Figure 12. As shown
on the graph, if we were to feed a 5 volt, 100 Hz sine wave
into the filter, we’d get the same waveform back out — the
gain of the filter is equal to 1.0 at 100 Hz. If we put a 5 volt,
200 Hz sine wave in, we get a 4 volt, 200 Hz sine wave out:
the gain of the filter at 200 Hz is 0.8, so we mulitply 5 times
0.8 to get the output amplitude of 4. (Note that a filter at-
fects only the amplitude of the signal, not the frequency).
Finally, a 5 volt, 500 Hz sine wave wouldn’t get through at
all — the gain at 500 Hz is zero. Since our filter lets low fre-
quencies through but attenuates high frequencies, we term
this a low-pass filter.

waves at 100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 500 Hz.

Now suppose we take the hypothetical mixture of har-
monics shown in Figure 13a and apply it to our filter. Since
each harmonic has the same amplitude (3 volts), we need
only “shape” the harmonics with the filter gain curve, as
shown in Figure 13b. We’ve just multiplied each harmonic’s
amplitude (which in this case is always 3) times the filter gain
at each harmonic’s frequency. The result is shown in Figure
13c. The signal resulting from adding together these har-

monics would sound very different from the original signal
(Figure 13a) but it would still have the same pitch: the fun-

damental frequency is still 50 Hz. (The pitch would be just '

above the lowest G on the piano, which has a fundamental
frequency of about 49 Hz.) The signal of Figure 13c would
sound more mellow than the original signal, as if we’d turned
down our treble control, since we’ve reduced or eliminated
many of the higher frequency partials.

It should be clear that if we take harmonically rich signals
like our sawtooth wave or square wave and feed them into
a filter, we could theoretically produce nearly any mixture
of harmonics, and therefore nearly any waveform desired.
The problem is that the more complex we make our filter’s
gain characteristic, the more components we need to make
the necessary circuit. But even simple filters like our low-
pass filter can be made more interesting by_ controlling the
frequency at which they begin attenuating the signal. This
is essentially what a bass or treble control does as it is
turned. For a filter with ‘a frequency response like that shown
in Figure 12, the frequency at which the filter’s gain is .707
is called the cutoff frequency. By increasing or decreasing
the cutoff frequency, we change the filter’s response as
shown in Figures 14a and 14b.

We could change the cutoff frequency by turning a knob,
but what if we wanted to change the filter’s characteristics
very quickly and predictably each time a note is played? We
relied on voltage control to allow precise control of frequen-
cy and amplitude, so let’s do the same here — by introduc-
ing a voltage controlled filter (VCF) to our system. The VCF
is a filter whose cutoff is ‘controlled by an applied voltage
signal — just as the VCA’s amplitude was controlled by a
voltage. We can now add a second function generator to pro-
duce the VCF’s control voltage. Our whole system is now
shown in Figure 15.

Very dramatic effects can be produced by sweeping a
VCF’s cutoff frequency up or down. The effect is much more
dramatic than can be obtained by adjusting a tone control
on a stereo, and can be done over a period of just a few
milliseconds. The effect produced can have a “wah-wah”
or “wooshing” or “meow” sound (words are really inade-
quate here — the English language has yet to suitably
describe a swept-filter sound). Many modern songs use this
technique to create a funky synthesized bass line.

The basic elements we’ve discussed so far — VCO, VCA
and VCF — form the core components of analog synthesis.
Robert Moog, an electrical engineer, was one of the first to
put all these parts together in the now-famous Moog syn-
thesizer in the 1960s. One of the best examples of the
capabilities of this instrument is Switched-On Bach, by Walter
Carlos, first released in the late sixties. Carlos took a vari-
ety of Bach’s more popular works and performed them on
the Moog synthesizer using a great variety of sounds. The
result is astonishing — many of the timbres produced are
reminiscent of such conventional sounds as reed or string
instruments, others are utterly unique. One of the most
adventurous passages is the second movement of the third
Brandenburg Concerto. New sounds seem to leep out with
every measure, such as notes sounding something like
strings being plucked underwater or a dramatic sweep of
noise like escaping steam. This passage leads into the live-
ly and cheerful third movement, with a variety of instrument
sounds weaving in and out of each of the parts, creating a
complex yet crystalline-clear texture of sound. As one listens
to this album it is difficult to imagine one instrument produc-
ing this vast assortment of sounds. A second release by
Carlos, The Wel/-Tempered Synthesizer, offered additional
realizations of material by Bach, Monteverdi, Scarlatti and
Handel.

Analog synthesis soon found widespread use in popular
music. The synthesizer provided bands with a ready source
of new sounds, all available from a conventional control
system such as a keyboard. Additionally, a singer's voice
or sounds from instruments such as the guitar can be pro-
cessed by a synthesizer to provide new tone colors for the
musician's palette.

Enter the Computer

We’ve seen some of the exciting possibilities provided by
analog electronic music synthesis — the ability to precisely
generate and control sound waves, allowing the emulation
of natural instruments (by imitating their partial structures
and their amplitude variations) or, more importantly from an
artistic standpoint, the ability to create distinctly new timbres.
Returning to the band of musicians who took to the stage
at the start of this article, we can now see that the xylophone
sound being produced by the keyboard player could be
created by setting our VCO to produce a harmonically rich
waveform such as a sawtooth wave, adjusting our filter to
simulate the pattern of harmonics produced by the
xylophone, and setting our VCA’s function generator to pro-
duce relatively fast attack and decay times — similar to the
fast attacks and decays produced when percussive in-
struments are struck. Similarly, we could conceivably run the
guitar's signal into the synthesizer and filter it so as to change

20

the harmonic structure to resemble more closely that of a
trumpet. In this case the processing needed is becoming
more complex, since while the harmonic spectrum of a
sawtooth wave is always the same and can be predictably
altered (as above), the spectrum of the guitar is itself a com-
plex and changing signal. The raw material we are using for
our processing is thus much trickier to work with. Trying to
make a keyboard sing is a still more difficult task. Walter
Carlos made an attempt at this on his realization of Montever-
di’s “Domine Ad Adjuvandum.” The sounds produced do
indeed have some vocal qualities, but to produce them re-
quired “a careful tuning of nearly every module on the syn-
thesizer and were performed by a practiced coordination of
hands and feet to select pitch, vibrato, loudness, portamen-
to and two vowel-producing resonances, each of which was
adjusted for maximum expressivity on the six vocal parts 
” (Walter Carlos, jacket notes on The Well Tempered
Synthesizer).

The situation we’ve reached is the same dilemma en-
countered with additive synthesis — the need to quickly and
accurately control lots of things going on at the same time.
Computers do this very well, and in Part II of this article
(which will appear in the April issue) the applications of com-
puters and digital technology to music synthesis will be ex-
plored. We’ll see then how an even more realistic xylophone
or trumpet sound can be produced. But traditional in-
struments already produce beautiful sounds, sounds which
in the hands of a skilled player can be so subtly controlled
that it would be exceedingly difficult, if even possible, for elec-
tronic synthesis to imitate them precisely. So we’ll not simp-
ly try to duplicate these sounds, but also examine ways of
creating exciting new sounds, such as our guitar-trumpet
hybrid. Electronic synthesis can in this manner open up new
possibilities for players of traditional instruments, giving a
trumpet or saxophone player new ways of shaping their in-
strument’s timbres, or adding striking new percussive sounds
to a drummers drum kit. One of the greatest powers digital
synthesis gives us is the ability to specify sounds literally as
easily as drawing their waveforms or graphs of their partial
structures. We’ll also see that digital synthesizers can take
a voice or any other natural sound and create a keyboard
that plays that sound or an altered version of it. Computer
technology can also allow a composer to program entire
pieces containing many instrumental parts, thus enabling the
direct creation of entire electronically synthesized pieces, or
enabling the composer to “preview” works intended for
eventual performance by ensembles of traditional in-
struments, such as an orchestra. These and other exciting
developments will be described in the next installment.

News from Benedum Hall

Plans Set for National ESC

Last year at the national convention for Engineering Stu-
dent Cabinets, Purdue proposed that there should be a
National Engineering Student Cabinet. The students at
the convention decided that this was too much too soon,
but they did decide to set up a communications network
between the student cabinets.

This year at the national convention they decided to go
ahead and form the National ESC. They set up a task force
of six members by using the six geographical regions
established by the NSBE. Each region then selected a
regional director who was to serve on the task force. The
directors are to meet during the year to come up with the
proposals for the National ESC.

The task force had their first meeting in Washington
D.C. over the Christmas break. They decided to readjust
the regional boundaries, so that each region has from
40-45 accredited engineering schools in its region. They
also made up a structure and rough draft for the constitu-
tion and bylaws. To become a national organization they
have to incorporate, and they are checking into doing this
now.

Their next meeting will be in Chicago, but they are go-
ing to have an informal meeting at the leadership con-
ference at Penn State before then.

Pittsburgh is in region two of the organization and our
regional director is Mark Cairns from our own University
of Pittsburgh. Besides being a regional director, Mark is
also in charge of the regional communications newsletter.

Region one didn’t choose a director, so a member of
Penn State, a region two school, is the regional director
for region one. The other four regional directors are from
the University of Florida at Gainsville, the University of Col-
orado, the University of Illinois, and the University of Texas
at San Antonio.

At this time the National ESC is looking for corporate
support. If anyone knows of a corporation willing to sup-
port this organization, you may contact Mark Cairns at 125
BEH, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 or
call (412) 624-5260.
