FIGURING OUT A CAREER?

Selecting a career can be puzzling, too.
Here’s how Bob Pike found the solution to
his career problem—at IBM:

“I became interested in computers and
transistors at college,” Bob Pike recalls.
“Upon graduation, I naturally turned to the
computer ﬁeld. IBM, as a leader in the
ﬁeld, looked like a good place for me.” After
a training period, he joined the Semi-
Conductor Device Development Group in
Research. Promoted to Associate Physicist
soon afterward, his present assignment is
leading a group of technicians in fabricating
high—frequency, high-power PNP drift
transistors. “These will be used as core

drivers in a high-speed memory array,” he
says. His future? At the rate IBM and the
electronic computer ﬁeld are expanding,
Bob Pike foresees excellent opportunity for
advancement in the area of his choice.

There are many excellent opportunities for
well-qualiﬁed engineers, physicists and
mathematicians in IBM Research, Develop-
ment and Manufacturing Engineering. Why

Recently AiResearch engineers were
called upon to develop an accessory
power motor for aircraft and mis-
siles which would operate at
+1000°F. . . . a temperature area
where present-day hydraulic and
electrical devices fail.

Their answer was this cam piston
air motor, pictured above in a spe-
cially built transparent shell. Operat-
ing on hot air or gas, its efficiency
actually increases as temperatures
rise.

This problem and its solution are

 

typical of many encountered at
AiResearch in aircraft, missile,
nuclear and electronic ﬁelds. Specif-
ically, you’ll find them in system
electronics; computers and flight
instruments; gas turbine engines and
turbine motors; cryogenic and
nuclear systems; pneumatic valves;
servo control units and air motors;
industrial turbochargers; air condi-
tioning and pressurization; and heat
transfer.

Upon your employment, in addi-
tion to direct assignments, a 9-month

orientation program is available to
aid you in selecting your field of
interest. This permits you to survey
the project, laboratory and adminis-
trative aspects of engineering at
Garrett. Also, with company ﬁnan-
cial assistance, you can continue
your education at outstanding uni-
versities located nearby.

Project work is conducted by small

a message from the dean

THE ENGINEERING SCIENCES

Tlhe l'aunch.ing of the Rulssian Sputnik I on Ooto-
ber 4 of last year caused :a wave of hysteria to sweep
over this country. Never before had -the average Ameri-
can -and his representatives in -Congress lost their con-
ﬁd-ence in the superiority of our science  technology
—~not even in war time.

Yet all this concern has already subsid-ed -since «the
successful llaun-ching of our own sateili-tes. We are al-
ready -conlﬁdent that we will precede the Ru.ssians -to the
moon in spite oi the 'fa»ot that Sputnik II weighed
1,120 pounds and had a launching thrust of 395,000
pounds compared to our Explorer I which weighed
30.8 pounds and had an 83,000 pound thrust. Noth-
ing has -ever beiovre Inade Americans so interested in
the development and edu-oation of our scienrti-sts and
engineers, but like many other factors in American
life, we tire of head.l:ines on -any -sulbsject acflter -a few
days and look for a new -in'te-rest.

Nevertheless, during the brief period of concern
over the status of our ltechnoltogy, consideralble funds
were «appropriated by our government for science and
engineering research and developments. These are to
be “distributed by various agencies iargely to such
non-proﬁt research laboratories as colleges. However,
it was only a short time after the approupriations. were
made that the term “enuginee-ri;ng” began -to disappear
from the listings. Apparenltly, a decision has been
made to support the so-called “pure” science-s to the
exclusion of the engineering sciences. The irony of it
is that ‘satellites are engineerinug developments and not
pure science in the usual sen-se of the word.

A cli~che has apparently developed in Washington,
not ‘without pressure from the “pure” scientists, to
support any “pure” or “ubasic” scientiﬁc projeot as long
as it does not have any apparent application; while,
at the same -time, assuming that because of its “purity,”
it will eventu=ally be responsible for -a major technological
“break-through.”

M-eanwhi-le, support has been withheld from engi-
neering research projects because these often have
irnmedi-ate or clearly stated applications. However, the
tragedy which is occurring is -that with all the support
of “pure” science, it is not realized «that. the engineer is
a scientist. In additio-n to the physical sciences, he has
also been skilled in certain basic engineering sciences,
some of which are just as “pure” or “basic” as any of

the natural or physical sciences. As examples, descrip-
-ttive geometry, theoretical and) applied -mechanics,
‘strength of material-‘s, el«ec:tronics, aerodsynamics, ﬂuid
ﬂow, thermodyn-amios, heat transier, metallography,
etc., to name a few, are now enngineering sciences re-
gardless of their origin -and are “basic” sciences with-
out which many technollnog‘-ica.\l “break-:throughs” are
impossible. Yet, the engine-ering sciences apparently
are not to receive government support commensurate
with the “pure” sciences.

When erng-ine-ering colleges. submit proposals to
federal agencies for research, they are frankly told that
all staternenrts regarding the u.sefu.lness or apupl-ieations
of the work shoullld «be dele-ted ‘because «the .project would
be rejected on this basis. Thousands might be appro-
p-riéated for a study of -alillergies of house ﬂies, but not
one cent would be allowed for the use of this know-
l-edge in their extermination».

One svh0'uil'd have only the 'highest regard for the
“pure” -soie-nti-st whose discorveries are based -on the pur-
suit of knowledge for its sake alone. Yet many tech-
nological ‘break-tlhroughs would never ocour without
the co-mbintation of several bits of knowledge gleaned
from v-ari-ous sources by one who has a burning desire
to ’S0?l.'V—€ some p-robllem for useful purposes. In making
the comibination, he also often makes a contribution
of his ow-n in “basic” engineering research.

The la-ck of support of engineering research by
government agencies has caused many of -our best re-
search engineers to leave the colleges and- to enter
more remunerative indust»ri'a'=l work. Some o=f their po-
tential conttributions have been l-ost forever. Unfortun-
ately, the engineer is, himself, partially to blame for
some of the trouble because he sees so many needed
appllication-s of the sciences all round him that he of-
ten forgets the ‘funda.rnen;ta.l -nlatuure. of his training. He
‘thus does not rise to his full statu-re in creating as many
of -the break-uthroughsv as he could if he applied him-
self -to more basic s'tudie's.

Perhaps, if the Russians are successful -in “shoot-
ing” the moon -ahead of the Americans, some people
will awaken to -the lack of support of the engineering
sciences and do something about it. It would be better,
of oourse, if ‘the situation were corrected now so that
we would -not lose this race, and many others, which
might be more important I

HOW WILL WE GET TO

OUTER SPACE?

BY RICHARD L. DENEZZA, EE ’60

A look at the proposals
for man’s mastery of
interplanetary travel.

Wh-at comes after the sate.llites of tocliay? W'h'at
means of propulslion will the first men to travel through-
out the solar system use? Onuee considered remote,
these questions must now be «a'nls'were:d, for man’s great-
eM;chaHenge E begunnng to unfokL—¢he conquem;of
space.

In order to predict what the future will hold, let’s
take alook at when we havetDday.'The bade pﬁn-
cqﬂe of nocket propulnon is die devekunnent of suf-
ficient power, c'a¢l»led thrust, to overcome the pull off

the problem to ﬁnding a source of power which can be
COI’]ltI‘O‘lll€d to act at a desired magnitude and for a
long time.

A good start-inlg place for a sol-utiotn to this prob-
lem is la-Uomic energy. Here only very small amou-n.ts of
fuel are -necesslaury. This in itself does not produce
thrust. Heat provided by this energy converts water
to steam. This steam, when ejected from the rear of
the rocket propels the ship. Other liqxuids as well as
salt water -can he used.

This idea of a steam p-ropellatnlt has two main
drawbalc-ks. What happens is Itlhlalt when the steam
leaves the reactor, it is so ho-t that no means has yet
been d'eve.lop-ed to oontain these extremely high temp-
eratures. Another disadvlanstag is the huge water re-
quirement for co<n:t.inwu~e:d thrust.

Now -avnovther more lfeasi~b-le source of thrust is
nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the fusing t'ogether of
two dei1>teriu'm atoms to florm an atom of helium. This
evolves a great a'moru-nt of heat. Temperautu-res as
high as those at the center of the sun can be produced
by nuclear fusion. The resrul.-tinvg energy from fusion
could be us-ed in a s-econd type of rocket, called a
Iphotlon-ic rocket.

In a photonic rocket there would be a small f1.llSlllOlﬂ
revaictor which would produce a s-trea.m of very min-
ute light pa;rt«ic~.lles, called photons. A plLOUO1’Ll'C rocket
would receive its thrust from billions of these -photons
escaping at unbelieva-bly high speeds. This vast flow
of photons would replace the exhause gases men:ti3oned
in the previous .type of rocket.

The originator of the photonic rocket cozncept, Dr.
Eugen Sanger, ‘has designed the most l'1’1’lp'O-’I“.t'3.tI’Lt con.-
cepts of such a ‘rocket. Two ferant-ures which Dr. Sang-
er prescrilbes is the source of photons and a reﬂec=tor to
focus the pho-tons into one main beam. This principle
was used -by Dr. Sanger i-n hi-s “nuclveasr lamp”. Theore-

tically, the space ship which osperartes on. this principle
could reach speeds approaching that of light.

A third type of p~rorpru.lsion system is simi-l-atr to
that of the photonic rocket. It was suggested -by Dr.
Ernst Situhlinger, missile enlgineer at Redst-one Arsenal,
H=un:t:sville, Alabama. Dr. Stuhli-nlge-r proposes an elec-
trical propuision system which expells ions and elec-
trons as -a source of thruls-t.

Two things are necessary for -this type of rocket.
They are a source of ions and power to accelerate
them. Dr. Stuhl.in.ger suggests two elements, cesium
and rubidium, as an ionic source. A turbo electric gen-
erator powered by a nuclearr ‘reactor would serve as
the ion acce'l-eratolr. Cesium and irulbid-ium are feasi-
ble because of their high ‘avtomic mass. Here the prin.-
ciple applies that the greater the mass of -the exharust
gas fo-r a given velocity, the higher the -ro-cket’s for-
ward speed.

Now if the cesium and rubidium are i:n-t:roduced-
insto a ceram-ic propulsion chamber where they would
strike a grid of rplantlinvurr. plates, the outer electrons
Olf the tw-0 elernenxts would be absorrbed by the plat-inum,
and positively charged ions would remain. These io-ns
would then pass in a thrust chamber. Here the ions
would -be acce‘le.rated t-o very high velocities by nega-
tively charged elle-ctrodes -placed around the nozzles of
the chamlber. The ions would then pass out the ex-
'ha~u.st as an electricaul jet.

A space ship of the electrical jet design would be
capable of making a round trip from Earth to Mars
in two years. The ship would have an initial take-o-ff
mass of 750 tons and could carry a pay-load of 150
tons.

The three types of 'p=rop~ulsion systems which
have been described refer ‘back «to the basic problem
menvtioned a.t -the beg>inning—thrus-t to overcome the
earth’s gravit«at.io'nal ‘p-ulll. Three possible new systems

considered were the liquid exh.aujsit,, the photolnic
rocket, and the clec-tirical jet. Ainiotiher type of propul-
sion system which does not depend at all on thrust
is‘-an antigravity mechanism, srtillvl using ato-mic power
but not rocket propelled.

Gravity, as everyone knows, ho-lds eve-ryvthing on
this earth. Now if a sys-tem coiuild be developed to
counteract the earit-h’s gravity, a space ship couilid
cruise the sola-r system as ears-ily as an airplane ﬁys
today. The graviitational -phenolmenion has in.trigued
~s~cien»tits.ts for cenituries, and they rank it as great a
mystery as life int~se.~lf. Universities, aircraft companies,
and the government have lautnsched an all-out attack
on this problem.

An approach -to the‘ gravitationail theory is to
state that gravity acts on -every particle of the human

body runiifovrmly. Irf, thereifo-re, t‘he force of gravity
would vary, -the body would a.cceiliera-te or deceilerate
wiithouut feeling a change in the f-oroe. This principle
solves the p-rolbtlem of making sharp tulr-n«s in space,
but a -spaceship must istill be -designed to counteract
gravity.

What will make up the ﬁrst ainiti-gravity, or
anti-g propelled ship as it is called? A good guess is
that it w-ou-lid be «disk-shaipeid. Inside wouid be an
atomic reacitor, -a turbine, and a generator. This equip-
ment su-pplies electric ourrenit to two coil—shaped elec-
tro—magnets placed in parallel plra-nes. The upper of
the -two coils repireisenuts the earth while the lower one
would b-e the ship. When the pilot reverses the polarity
of the poles, the ship would hrurtll-e into. ‘Sp'a.'C€.

The anitii-g p.ro»pel‘le-d ship has several advantages.
This type of ship alllevviwaited «the ‘problem of friction
beitwe-een the ship and the air. This i-s aoco-rnzplished as
the space ship gnazeis «the -outer layers of the atmosphere,
the air particles near -the ship are affected by the
g-ﬁeld and, .c-onsequenrtly, move along with the ship.

Anothe-r advantage of the g-ship is that it would
tiraveil with a ‘min-imiuim of sound Clll:S12L1‘I‘.bIa.;I1lC€. Some
sciieinti-sts believe that there '-woruild 'be -ai-r —turbule:nuce
at the edge of the g-ﬁeld which would cause a noise.
This is probably i.nco.rrec>t since the air pa.rtic.le.s on the
edge of the ﬁeld would have a smaller velocity and,
‘therefore, 1C'L1S'l'l£lOl[1 the noise.

The ~ah-tigraviity propelled space ship is theoreti-
cally exc-ellieint, but actual pracit-i-c.a'liJty is still at a dis-
tance. W7heIt;he'r the s-pace rocket Olf the future be

DIAMONDS — MAN MADE

After many unsuccessful attempts,

synthetic production of diamond

 

In «times past, the -diamond has been vallrued mostly
as a gem. lit has been «prized -for ages ‘by men -foartunate
enough to posse-ss it. Men have «studied them, stolen
't1h-em, stmuggvled them, fought -b-at-tl-es over them, and
invented legends about them. Tlorday, however, -the
diamond is highly val:ued for its use in industry in the
ouittiing, grinding, and polishing of hard rnajterialls.
Modern technology could hardiy do without it.

The hardest substance known to man, diamonds
are mined at the -ralte of about two and one-half tons
yearly. The United States: imports approxirnately nine-
ty percent of this iﬂornnvage. Oil the di~amonid's oi indus-
trial grade, some are stockpi-led for defense purposes,
but Iﬂhe mtaj-otr portion «goes iin-‘tio tools -that saw, .C’l1It,
or polish other hard mat-erials. The United. States pays
more tihiarn $50,000,000 a year for i.ndiu'stri-all diamonds.

The late, renowned G. F. Henbert Srnith, always
an -eager student, as well as a di‘stinguished authority in
ﬁeld rninerailuogy, advannces the =th:re-e moist p»ro‘boa'ble the-
ories ﬁor the crystallization of diamond.

1. The volcanic material had Ibrougiht up and dis-
solved the deep seated rock in which the diamond was
oninginally formed.

2. The deep seated -carbonaceous mvaiterial had
been dislsoilved -by volcanic rock and had erystialized
as d'i!amond~ under high pressure and ~te~mpemature.

3. The diamond was an oirig~i1n.atl cronstiztu-enrt of the
‘blue ground, «which 'I‘€'1’1’1lal'I1id‘ unlailtered -by the change in
the other material due to the action of steam. All of the
lines of evidence point to tihe third of these theories
as being the correct one. ,

In 1894-, Henri Moissan, a F rrench ‘scientist, at-
temped synthesis of diamond by dlissoliving carbon in
molten iron and then quenidhinig the substance in water.
As iron solildiﬁes it increases in volume, and this in-
crease in volume led Moissan to believe that -this pres-
S'lll_I'8 would ﬁerce the carbon atoms into the crystal

stnuloture of diamond. The resuiat.-inig hwaird mass of iron
‘was dissolved «by acids, «and from -it tiny crystals were
obtained. These were a rniul-limeter or less in diameter
and weighed only about .05 of a carat. Moissan and
onhie-rs believed these to be diamonldis, but absollutely
reliable 'piro-otf, such as is. afforded by more recent de-
velopments in optical rnineralogy, could not be secur-
ed at that time.

Sir Willli-am Cirookes, interested in Moissaonis ex-
periments, worked along these same ‘lines. By suddenly
cooling a «batch oi molten ‘iron. in which carbon was
added, he -too oubtained smailnl stones which he thought
to be diamonds. R. H. McKee of Columbia Univer-
sity melted iron fernoi-siilircon, ferro-phos.phorus_, and
crude carbon, and poured the molten solution into a
hiolllow steel ball. This was allowed -to «cool slowly, -and
the mass was then .treated with acids to recover ery-
sitrails. McKee stalted t'hat the largest out his stlones was

The head of a pin would appear about 47 feet wide if ex-

microanalyzer—the ﬁrst to be used industrially in this
country. U. S. Steel research teams use it to get a better
look at the microstructure of new types of steel. In this
way, they gather more information about the factors affect-

J. W. Hershey of McPherson College in Kansas,
announced the production of diamonds by another
varia-tilon of the same molten iron process. Shrouds of
douiblt prevailed where Hershey ‘submitted some of
his stones to the Gernoltogical Institu-te of America for
testing. ‘One proved to be natural diamond, later ad-
mited, by Hers-hey himseltf, to be a natural dni'amond.
Two others were quartz. One might possibly ‘be syn-
thetic diamond though in the -‘light of this experiment-
er’s somewhat questionab'le me-thod of handling the
entire matter, the origin of this stone may be doubted.

A -recently attempt -in West Germany to produce
diamond synthetically in a carbon are, by a new method,
was released in February 1957. D-r. M-eincke and thirty
West German scientists worked in a guarded labora-
tory on the synthesis. Graphite “mushrooms” were

temperature of about 6,000 degrees Kelvin. in a special
prressure cha-rnber. The “m-u'shroorns” consisted of pure
graphite crystals which are stransparen.-t and-’, although
not positively identiﬁed, are not silicon carbide. The
product reported was 20 stones of 2.8 mg. each. They
were represented as synthetic diamonds but of 'b!ort
(ocomntercial) quality.

in turn produces a blowing force or mag-netirc ﬁeld.

On February 15, 1957, General Electric Corpor-
ation’s Kn-olls Research Laboratory at Sch-enectady,
New York, reported the suxoces-sful synthesis of dia-
m-ond. The produuot is identical to natural diamond,
in hardiness and atomic s~tru=cture, and it weighs about
one hundnredith to one tenth carat. The largest stone to
date produoed has been approximately one sixteenth
inch (long axis.)

Scientists at General Electric placed a carbonace-
ous material H1 a metal pressure cn-amber and subjeoted
it to 1.5 milllio-n pou-nds per square inch pr-essure and
5,000 degrees Farenheit for varying amounts of time.
The diameter of the chamber is reported to be approx-
imately 0.03 cubic centimeters in d-iameter and de-
signed from a spe-ciallly deveioped metal t-o withstand
high pressure and temperature. It took 16 hours to
produce the one sixteenth inch -crystal. Aocordfnzg to the
report, the pressure and temperature used in equivalent
to 'that pressure and temperature 240 miles beneath the
surface of the earth.

General Elect-ric’s synlthetic diamond according
to Dr. Gey Suilts, Director of Research, was subjected
to suxstaine-d press-u-re and temp=erature during the syn-
ﬁhesis, As soon as the diamond was made, several other
teams of soi'entists repeated the same experiment with
sruooess. The pressure and temperature is esti'mat.ed by
interpolating from known phase changes in various
crystal stru.oture that takes plaoe at speciﬁc tempera.-
tures in other minerals. Bismuth, for instance, changes
phase at 360,000 pounds and 397,000 pounds per square
inch. Electrioal resistivity changes indicate the phase
ohange. Professor Bridgernan of Harvard, Departrnenrt
of Metallurgy, is responsible for the basic technique
used by General Electric to synthesize the diamond.

The prosces-s of syn'»t.~hesi's, of course, involved some
adljustrnent and perfection of the app-aratus used by
Professor Bridzgern-an in his experiments. His failure
-to produce diamond hirnself was due; ‘basically to failure
of his pressure -chamber to withstand i‘ncreased pres-

does not. Graphite with free electrons collects light
and appears rblalck while bfoiron tra-n-smits light and
looks white.

Boron 1'1ll'tI‘iCl‘€ will use up its free electrons to bind
closer together its sheets of atoms in the space lattice
while graphite is loosely bound togieither with its sheets
of atoms. The sheets of atoms slide past each other,
and, there-fore, the graphite is sorft instead of hard as
is ‘boron-. X-ray diﬂraotuion will easily identify boron
nitirride from graphite. It is reported that ‘this new
maitrezriiatl ‘has atoms packed almost as closeily as those
in diairnloind. So far General Electric has only produc-
ed a few -grams of this material. Indtiviidual c~rysta*ls

Natural industrial diamonds sell for ap.piroximate-
l~y $2.85 per carat. The synthetic diamond produced by
General Electric will be availvable in quantity at about
$4.25 ‘per carat in the future, in a ooimparable grade to
natural |l1’LCl‘uSit‘I‘lal diamonds.

Dr. Suits has made it clear that any conclusion
that G.E. is about to make diamonids of a size and
quality suitable for gem use is decidedly premature. If
the present high cost of making diamonds by the G.E.
process can be reduced, the primary application of
man-made diamonds will up-rope-rly and pro-baly be in
inidustriavl itlOlO1lS for c~utti-ng and polishing. Through con-
ztinsued research more land more aip:p|l»ic.a:t.ionis will be

GATEWAY TO THE FUTURE

An authoritative summary of progress —
past, present, and future.

Tihe years behind have ‘been exuciting and chal-
lenging ones——years in which -the Pittsbwrgh commun-
ity has been put to -the ‘test in: conquering smoke, in rip-
ping out its slhaarmefusll cormrmercial and nesixdenrtial slums,
in protecting itself against the calamity of ravaging
ﬂoods, in meeting many ~dr.iffiou'lt problems which can
tih-reaten -the ‘health and sezcurrity of our whole urban life.

No_ one would have been -so oprtimilstic or so bold
twelve years ago to predict vrth-at P-Ltltsbulrgh, or any
other American com-munity, ooruld have done so much
in so little time.

In August of 1946, George Sessions Perry wrote
an 'a1I‘tllJCl'8 va|bou1t PiItt.s‘b.u'rgh in the Saturday Evening
Post, as a part of a series that magazine was carrryijnxg
about A.merioa’s ci-ties. Th-e picture he painted was not
a bright one. Even the phjoltograph of -the Golden Tri-
angle was drab and depressing, showing a jungle of
oornmencial svltums -art the Point, and a murky haze
hung close -to the City’s unchanging skyline.

The P‘i~t:ts4buvrgih of 1946, Mr. Perry wrote pic-
uiresq-uely was “-a fruuitfu-l, ﬁllthy monster,” a city whose
gnime was legendary, whose polilusted rivers had a tend-
ency to «rise up and wash out the town, whose indus-

tries were moving ‘away, and whose housing was his-
torically and notoriously bad. In faot, there was -very
lriittle good to say about the place other th-an its bust-
lcinag past and the rather whirnsi-oal  that things
Illfllglhlt somehow, get ‘better.

There were plans, the Host said, -to get rid of
smoke, to «clear the slum-s and build more housing, to
flood-proof and purify the rivers, to build a mid-town
park and a -civic auidxiitoriurm. There was «talk about
parking gama.-ges and a new freeway system, and about
pilra-.nti.ng tre-es along Duquesne Way.

That was in 1946—alm-ost twelve years ago.

Much of Pitltstbvurglh’-s hopes and -many of its plans
have been :cIonver.be-d into concrete achievements in
the inatervenring years. Smoke-ﬁlled skies are no longer
a «b-lort on human life in Pittsburgh, although -there is
sti"ll much work to do before it can honestly be said
ﬂhat the pnoblem is fully solved. The network of ﬂood
dontvnol dams is being carried forward with last year’s
Congre-ssion'a'l approval of the initial appropriation for
the Kinzua Dam.

The sewage treatment system is mid-way toward

function-ail» actuality. Contiraotosrs wilil begin work on
the audit.ori~um this summer and the trees have been
planted -along what is n.ow called Font Duquesne Boule-
yard.

Pittsburgh has made a brave beg-inning in recon-
stirucition. It cannot afford the luxury of -relaxinig, of
taking things easy, of sitting back and ‘basking in the
light of achievements.

Instead-, -it II1-1.1Sit gain new detenmination, new
boldness, new vigcr to meet the chrallenages an.d the op-
portunitie-s that are ahead. It is increasinigly evident
that the urban 1"‘€!d€V€lOlp'1'1’l€.'I'1!t and renewal process
provide the technique and ‘the in«s'tru.men:t for almost
every phase lotf physical rebuilding of -the American
ci'tii'es- of today.

dream, there were some ske:p'tic:s in Pint-tsbu=rg1h who
oliaimed it could never be, because the city already h-ad
a surplus of office space in its existing bui-ldings. The
years that have passed show how wrong, how short-
S'i¢gll'1't€’Cl they really we-re.

By the end Of 1957, all -but 18 of almost a thou-
sand parcels of prop-e-rty in this disutmict had been ac-
quired by the Redeveloprrnen.-t Auitholriety. Seventy per
cent of l'..‘l'1€ area I as already ibeen clared, with the
wreckers bal»l crusihing out one of the worst slum areas
anywhere in America.

The people who lived in -the Lower Hill, 1743
f8.TI'1Ellli€!S, are being moved into safe and decent hous-
ing. Appunox-i-rniately 60 percent of these families already
have been rellocate-d, with over half of -them being
accoimmodated in public housing.

If ever there was an example of the niecessirty of
public hoursing and redev»elo»p‘me.nt, it is -‘provided by the
Lower Hinll Project. Work started last year on t-he new
Cen.ter-W-yilie ‘Avenue, a Six ‘lane hinghway, which is
sche-duled for comiple-tiiorn on June 15. Also in June,
earth SlhlO!Lll|Cl begin ﬂying, at last, on the long-awaited
atrena-auditoariurn, which will be the center piece of the
enitire Lower Hill area and, indeed, on of «Pittsib-u~ng1h’s
most ouitstanuding atrtractions fo rall the world to see.

The-re have been many obstacles to overcome in
getting -the auditorium projec.t underway, volimaxed !by
nilsin-g construction costs with which the Authority
members have been faced during the past year. Both
the City and County governimenuts have pledged addi-
tional furnds to the Authority to assure construction of

21

the auditorium with its most unique feature, the re-
trac~ﬁa'blIe roof. No other community in the world will
have a 'f1aci1li.ty to comrpare with the autdi-torium when it
is -domepleted late in 1960.

Sur-rounded by landscaped grounds and parking

for music-al shows under the stams in -the summertime
and for boxing and bas'k=e~tball under roof during the
colder months. During rthis year, other redeve-lopers for
the Lower Hill, invterested in its residential an.d com-
mercial qualities, will probably be signed up. Already,

By the end of 1958, pal-ans for complete development
in the Lower Hill should be advancing close to the cor.-
s=tructi'on stage.

The Authority plans to get un.derway on another
pmojec-t this year, by asking Washington’s approval for
redrevelloping the Bluff Street section, where Duquesne
University would b-e the principial d.eveloper. Extending
from Mercy H'O|S[[3l'tall to Duquesne’s camprus, -and from
the Boulevard of the Allies to Wa-tson Street, this 44-
acre tract would, in a sense, be an extension of the
Lower Hill project.

Duquesne University already is moving ahead
with its expansion program, as i-ts new Law and Busi-
ness Adminristrat-ilon Building rises at Forbes Avenue
near the Liberty Bridge approach. To successfully
carry forward its plans, it is ne-‘cessary to employ the
redevelopment process just as -the Unive-rsiilty of Pitts-
burgh i:s doin-g.

Prog-ress in- the Oakland project has been steady
and visible. Steel is going up for Children’s Hospi|tal’s

vent infantile paralysis. Now, Dr. Salk will canry on
his research work in the hospital, ﬁnding there a per-
manent home for his continuing efforts to search out
new kniowledge to overcome the ravages of other dis-
eases.

All of -this, of c.ou.:rse, is but one phase of the edu-
cational progress in Pittsburgh. Pitt, under its dynamic
new Chancellor, has undergone other changes in its
search for a new dimension in learning. Its facilities are
being expanded, with the Schenley Hlotel having been
opened last year for drormitory and office. uses. Its phy-
sioal education. facil-ities are being increased, with land
acquisition for the Morgan Street i'eclevelopmen~t pro-
jeot now at its halfway point. New -schools, such as the
Graduate School for Public Administration, have been
estalblished and the faculty has been s.trengthened and
enlarged.

This emphasis on educalti-onal progress, which re-
cerntly has attrac-ted such great national interest, ex-
tends -throughout Pi~tt:sIburg~h’s unban c-ol'le.ges an-d uni-
verisities. Carnegie Tech has embarkeld on a thought-

only scientists but to educate tod.ay’s yoiutlh broadly and

theirs to have.

The major highway project in -the Pittsburgh area,
of course, is the Penn-Lincoln Parkway. Last year, the
State let ﬁve additional oonitrarots for this highway a.t
a cost of almost $34,000,000. The progress is e-asily
apparent in various parts of the downtown area. This
year, ‘work will begin on comp-letinrg the inbound por-
tion. of the highway which inoludes th-e widenin-g of
the Boulevard of the Allies. Additional ~c~o-n-struction
will start on the interchange at the Po-init annd s'truc.tu:ra:l
Slt€'Cl will ‘be erected on the piens of the Fort Pitt Bridge,
across the Monongahela. This structure, which will
have -two decks, is sche-duled for compilation in the
summer of 1959.

Pittsburgh resildents have seen the busy activity of
the work crews now cutting through the Mt. Washing-
ton hillside for the Fort Pitt txunnels, which will link
the Parkway West with the ~dJo«wntow1n. This mammoth
job, which got sta«r«t~e-d’ ‘last year, is moving ahead right
on schedule, and ‘by Iseprinlg of 1960, -the tunnels will be
open to traffic, which should be good news for traffic-
snnarleld Soru.-th Hills residents.

Other highway projects are being planned which
will have a vital eﬂ"eot upon the ecaonlomy and growth
of the whole Pintstsrburgvh region. A highway link be-
-tween the port of Erie and Pititsfburgh is one of these,
while rot-hers wil-l connect the city more closely with the
upper Alllegheny c-orrrmunitlies and with the «booming

imp-ortanst -to Pittsburgh as the Penn-Li-nconl-n Parkway
and the Cro-ss'tow.n Thoroughfaire because they bring
closer together this vast region of which Pittsbu.righ is
the «logical center, the economic and ooammercival capi-
tal.

While this new co-nts-truction is important, it is
equally nuecessairy that existing sutreextvs anld roadwavys
be kept i-n good repair. As a pant of its caxpitta-l improve-
ment prougrarn, the City will spend a record am-ou-n.t
of -money this year reconstruct-.i.ng and resurfacing
streets.

Taken in retrospect, it seems clear that the recent
past was a busy» productive year, a year of progress
and iniiti-atlive.

It must be the City’s -pwrploise to keep up the pace,
especially in this year when Pittsburgh be-gins the
-observance of its 100th anniversaury, This Bicentennial

A SEARCH F OR RECOGNITION

Engineers strive for professionalism.

Since society recognizes engineerinig a.s a profession,
it demands of t'he engineer a great responsilbility. This
responsinbiiity extends no-t only to the public, but also
to nﬂhie pnofession, to em-plvoyers, as well as to fellow en-
gineers.

The safe application of atomic energy for peaceful
p<u-rpo-ses an-d ‘the design and consrtr-uietion of new high-
ways to service rthe great migration to suburbia are
typical 0»bIliIg‘atti|0ns to the publisc. But society looks to
engineering for the answers to many other problems
as well, and it must effecat the srolutions.

The engineer is obliged to constantly strive to im-
prove his profession. To estvaiblish the requirements that
a practicing engineer must meet for pnorfessional sutautus,
the engineering profession is an ideal group. Establish-
ment of st-and-airds is not suffici'en~t. On-cue standards

have been esttabllvished, a system must be devised for
their enforcement. ‘Some help toward this end ca-n 'be
realized by legislative action.

Engineers must act in the best interests of their
olienits or emp-loyers provided these interests do not
require ‘unethical practices. T-hese duties imply that an
engineer must ex"-pilralin -his position before aceepting
any engi-neerinig work, and must d‘-iscllose any «outside
interests which milght affect his decisions. Keeping
abrrea.-st of new developments i-n his ﬁeld is also expected
01f an engineer so that he might better serve his employ-
er our clien«t.

Among his duties to fellow engineers are inc'lu-ded

those who do not conform -to ethical practices are also
oolnsidered -c-on:trary to the -expected conduct toward
other engineers.

In order to deﬁne these obaligations, the National
Society of Pro-fessi-onlal Engineers had adopted a canon
of ethics. Every licensed enngirneer agrees to abide by
these -rules of conduct, «but -it rermains the duty of the
entire profession to do i'ts own polli-cinig. This, of course,
is an individual prolblrem.

The ﬁact that a man c-an give a oorrec.t answer
to a question on ethics does not assure -that when faced
with a decision- regarding ethical practices h-e would do
what is right and avoid that which is , wrong. U-niless a
man. -lives by a strict moral code, it is not certain that
he -will always choose right from wrong.

Recent -scienitiﬁc developments have focused purblic
atterution on en:gi-n-eerinxg. The effect of this ‘vill as-
sist engineers in making great strid-es ;to‘w-and pu'b1lic
acceptance of enlginee-riunxg as a true profession. To-
ward this goal of improvement, the ensg~in.eer must
never relent.

It i-s -the duty of those in the ﬁeld o=f engi-neering
eduoation to c-onsvtanutrly strive to instill a professional
attit-uvde into their classes. By proper example they can
develop in students a spirit of 'in<teg'ri»try and a strong
motivation for eth-.ica»l conducnt. It is true that «the pur-
pose -of ~en:gineeri=ng education is technological devel-
opment, but this must be focused on the social obliga-
tions to be fully app-reci'ated..

At the November meeting of the f'acuI]Jty of the
School of Engineering and Mines, -the members, by ap-
provin-g the orga-n.i'zati'on of the ﬁrst student branch
of the Pennsylvania So-ciety of Professional Engineers,
demonsutrated agia-in their sincere inxterest in the ad-
VaJI‘1}C‘€:1’I1'C-l’1:t of the profession. This branch of the Uni-
versity faculty is one of the leaders in Pennsylvania in
the cpercentag-e of staff who are licensed enugiineers. This
interest in p-rofessional development is .not aooid-erntal;
rnJaT1'y of the faculty are active as members of -the Pro-
fessional Society. One is p.resi:den!t of a local chapter of
P'SPE ‘while many others are members of committees at
the state and local level.

The members of the enngineering profession must
work together in order to accomplish the many tasks
ahead. A uniﬁed eﬁlolrt is the best means by which
this -can be done. The un.iﬁc:ati=o.n of the various engi-
neering societies into a well organized team has often
been proposed but as yet is not a reality.

The latest plan was proposed last June by Dr. M.
S. Coover, president of the AIEE. He proposed that
the aotiivities of -the several established organizatio-ns
be divided such that:

1. Engineers Joint Council (EJC) would provide
the medium fo-r ooopervation and coordi-nation of tech-
nological matters.

2. Engineers Council for Professional Develop-
ment (ECPD) would provide the medium for guid-

3. The National Society of Professional Engineers

MAY 1958

(NSPE) would provide the medium for the general
promotion of the pr-ovfessionval aspects of engineering in
the eyes of the pu-bli-c, and be instrumental in the con-
sequent enhancement of the eco-nom-ic status of engi-
n-eers.

The principal duties of NSPE would be:

1. Police the members o-f the profession.

2. Protect the profession against outside facrtions
suoh as u=nio-ns.

3. Alert the profession to legislation, bo-th helpful
and «hair-mcful.

4. Voice the opinions of its members.

5. Guide the law making bodies in writing new
legisvlatilon.

This divisio-n of resp‘onsibi:l'i'tie.s would eliminate
the extensive overlapaping of the aotiviaties of numerous
en.-gineerintg societies. An indication of this can be seen
in the recent annual report of the EJIC in which it
was stated that one-txhitrd of the committees of the
Council «duplicate efforts performed -by N«SP'E. Un-iﬁ-

cation of the engineering societies would eliminate this

dual coverage with the resuit that more could -be ac-
-complished -economicaﬂrly.

The various groups affected by -this p-rolpo-sed
unity plan have been asked to di=scuss- it and submit
their opinions pro and -con. By such discussions a lot
of the hidden. problems -and beneﬁts can be -brou-ght
into View .With a truly proufessional approach to such
a complex p|I‘=OIb'l€!m a umi3ﬁcat'io»n pla.n can evolve which
will then be adop-ted. _

Voicing of objections alone will not develop the
necessary sollution. Butt objections supplanted by sug-
gestion-s for making improvemenrts for the beneﬁt of
all is the only hope of uniting the entire profession.
Eve~nitu'a'l»ly some method of -complete organiza-tioln in
the ﬁeld of enginee.ri'rsg must be adopted to make a
strong profession that can fulfill all of its obiligations.

In order !for any proposed unity plan to s-u-c-ceed,
nuimerous societies m-uszt relinquish some of their dut-
ies to others. This is possibly where the real mission
work is to ‘be done. The resistance of some must give
way to one of “give and take” for the good of all. It
seems, as -always, that it is easier said than done. It
is, however, the duty of all engineeers to work for a
uniﬁed as well as a better profession. I

of PSPE, reports on the organization’s statewide projects.

HALF WAY UP THE HILL

PITT INITIATES SOCIETY

At a mee-tsirng on March 1], the Uintivexrsity orl
Rit'tsbung‘h Student Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sno-
~c‘i'e-ty for Professional Engineers adopted a formal con-
stitution. Tlhnis marked the -beginininig of the first student
chapter of the society in the state of Pennssylvlania. The
Pitt «group has applied for a charter from the state
society, and, after a one year p1"0Iba:ti0n'a.1‘y peri-od,
hopes to »a.Hi'li«ate with the NaJt«iona.l Society of Pro-
fessionial Enxgineers.

In order to assist this ﬁnsrt student chapter, the
state solctiesty has appointed -a Student B-ranch Com-
mittee. This committee wvill work closely with the
PSPE faculty advisors to help insure the success of the
organization. The local chiatpter of the Pennsylvania
Society of Professional Engineers is also 'cooperatin.g
to help the student chapter.

The newly adopted con:stiIturti'on orf the Pitt chap-
ter states in part that th.e pnimarry purpose of forming
a SllZ‘L1lCl’CfI1lt bvnanch is “to stitnurlarte professional thiniking

attenition the responsibilities of the pvro-fessionall engi-
neer to the vp-notesision, to c~lien«t's and employers, and to
other engineers.” '

Mr. William Lee, mechanical  instruc-
tor and one of the faculty advi-slonrs to the stuident
chapter, has stated that there has long been a need for
an orguanizaltion with such a rpunpose, both on -the Pitt
campus and at enzgineening c-al-lreages na-.tioana.«l«l"y. This
stud-ent bvralnvch has set for itself, therefore, the goal
of -procmottineg the est'ah»li'shment of is-trusdent branches
-of the PSPE at the nine other avcoredi-ted schools of
engineering in the state of P—ennJsy1vrarnia.

Chemistry stands
at the threshold of
a new age of discovery

It has been said that more signiﬁcant scientiﬁc advances
have taken place in the last ﬁfty years than in all the
centuries that have gone before. One fact is indisputably
clear. The use of applied science in American Industry
today is progressing at a rate so fantastic it staggers
the imagination of the boldest visionary!

This is particularly evident in the vast, highly diversi-
ﬂed ﬁeld of industrial chemistry. Here, products, ma-
terials and processes that were unknown a few years
ago are in wholesale use today. The accomplishments
of chemical research are being felt in every area of
human endeavor. The prospect of further advancement
in the immediate future appears limited only by man’s
imagination and his desire for improvement.

Our society stands at the threshold of a new age of
discovery that oﬁers an infinitely better way of life as
its reward. A host of courageous, creative industrial
chemists will help lead the way.

. . . and you, too, can help 
shape the future  T

WORLD TIME CLOCK

A “world time clock” -which mealsuires the exact
moment of any event, anywhere on earth, «to the near-
est thoulsianudth of a seco-n=d, was developed priimarily to
help deterrnine the exact world time of mic-lea.-r detona-
tions, but many other "useful applications for it have
been ﬁoneseen.

Time si-g-n-a'ls are taken from WWV, the radio
station operated by the U. S. Bureau of Standards.
These (signals are extremely aiccurate. at their point
of origin, but in traiveling great distances around the
earth, they develop inherent errors due to many vari-
ables: the speed oi radio waves, atzmospheric condi-
tions wlhicih vary that speed, the so-called “bounce”
of ereﬂection between earth and s'ky and certain other
«conditions. The world time -clock may be set -so as to
compen-saite for these via-riatirons and obtain an “ap-
-proxi-aite” time, correct to w«i=thin a few lhiun-dredtlhs
of a second. Then comes the task of setting the time
exactly, to split-second.

This is done by means of a differenrtia-1 gear and
precision geasr train, used in conjunnotion with a -.s:tr0b|0r-
scopic device. The dial -has the usual hour lhranvd, min-
ute hand, and sweep second hand; but in 'aJddi'tion it

has a hand -that registe-rs tenths of a useconnd and a milli-
second hand. This latter hanrd records -thousan-d-th-s of
-a second, by virtue of rortaitilon at a speed of ten re-
volutions per second around a dial divided into one
hundred parts.

Obviously, no human ‘being czoultd possi'bly follow
such a motion with the eye. For that reason, there is
-a stro=bos»cope which creates the familiar opticanl illu-
sion of making ‘moving objects appear to stand still.
This is a special strobe, however. By means of special
circuitry, its pulse which is at one-seoontd intervals can
be changed so as to be ‘brought into coincidence with
the tiime-ticks from WWV in such a manner that the
instrument can be set precisely. Thereafter it acts sim-
-ply as a super-‘accurate stioprwat-ch in -timing phenom-
ena.

The hole that couldn’t be made will be 20 miles long

HE Philadelphia Electric

Company set out to build a
revolutionary new power plant
that would squeeze more energy
out of fuel than ever before. This
meant harnessing the highest
combination of pressure and
steam temperature ever achieved
in a central station—5,000 psi.
and 1,200° F.

The boiler superheater tubes
that carry this steel will glow red
hot 24 hours a day, year in, year

customarily used, the tube walls
would have to be so thick that no

ruinous to boiler efficiency. A
super alloy steel was needed, but
no one had ever succeeded in
piercing such steel into tubes
without developing internal
ﬂaws.

Combustion Engineering Co.,
designers and builders of the
boiler, gave the problem to
Timken Company metallurgists.
The problem was to make the
steel with all the alloys in just
the right balance to produce
piercing quality steel.

Tltru metallurgical research,
they achieved the proper balance
of alloy elements that made it
possible to pierce 20 miles of

   

seamless superheater tubes of
the size shown above. It’s another
example of how Timken Com-
pany metallurgists solve tough
steel problems.

START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW

By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock & Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&W stands poised at a new era of expansion and

development.

Here’s an indication of what’s going on at B&W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world’s
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the ﬁrst refractory concrete that will

withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the ABC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world’s ﬁrst nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.

These are but a few of the projects—not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.

How is the company doing right now? Let’s look at one
line from the Annual Stockholders’ Report.

Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer

At Vought, the engineer doesn’t often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it’s no wonder.

For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects —— among
them the record-breaking Crusader
ﬁghter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-p1us-
mph ﬁghter, details of which are still
classiﬁed.

The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.

Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation

investigation of advanced propulsion
methods

Mach 5 conﬁgurations

Vought’s excellent R&D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new ﬁelds
while advancing in his own.

The development engineer

who exercised his option

When it comes to end products, Bill Crowder
never ﬁnishes what he starts.

While Bill’s colleagues were bringing to comple-
tion a missile that he initiated, Bill helped launch
eight other major projects and some minor studies.
A restless record. But that’s his privilege in Chance
Vought’s Development Section.

Bill’s department analyzes requirements for new
weapons. Specs come from the military, or from
Vought’s own Advanced Development Planning
Group. They outline an approaching. void or short-
coming in our defense structure. It’s up to Bill and
from three to thirty project teammates to produce
an idea that will ﬁll the vacancy.

From Development’s desks and bull sessions
come new conﬁgurations. Some are radically dif-
ferent; others, close to conventional. The best are
projected, electronically, into the environments they
must dominate.

For example, Bill can forecast a proposed mis-
sile’s ﬂight behavior by studying analog traces and
columns of IBM tabulations. Electronically, he can
observe minute performance details such as gust
effects on a recoverable missile’s landing approach.

Tests like these reﬁne from Bill’s own offerings
and those of others the conﬁguration that best

1958

answers the problem. Once this pattern is “ball-
parked” for approximate actual size, it’s ready for
detail design . . . likely to become a full—scale project.

Time now for Bill to exercise an option all
Vought development engineers enjoy. He may fol-
low the project he’s begun the full route to comple-
tion. Or he may remain in Development and accept
a new assignment.

To himself, Bill justiﬁes his choice something like
this: “Changing assignments gives me a chance to
shift gears . . . to change my approach . . . to broaden
myself.”

To project engineers, anxious for him to follow
a promising project out of Development, Bill’s “no
thank you” is practically a matter of course.

They know he’s already cleared his desk for the
next new challenge.

At Chance Vought the Development Engineer explores
a unique variety of configurations and operational
environments. He may limit his analyses of land- and
sea-based weapons to preliminary design studies, or he
may accompany his project, through the complete
development cycle.

Commencement literally means a beginning—although
it marks the end of your undergraduate days.

Perhaps one of your classmates— or you, yourself —
has decided to start a career with General Motors.
lt’s a wise choice for many reasons but particularly
for this one:

Engineering is a profession at GM. And the engineers
who work on our hundreds of products are respected
as professional men.

. To a young engineer that fact is a key consideration.

For professional recognition carries with it many bene-
fits. The freedom to give your imagination free rein.
The opportunity to pioneer signiﬁcant developments
in the engineering art. The chance to become a key
executive in a great corporation.

The fact that more than 179 of our engineers and
scientists received more than 164 patents in a recent
four-month period is one measure of the intellectual
freedom engineers have at GM.

And the fact that 14 of our 33 Vice-Presidents—23 of
our 42 Division General Managers—are engineers is an
indication of the advancement opportunities for engi-
neering graduates at GM.

General Motors is made up of 35 Divisions with 126
plants in 71 cities and 19 states. Many of the young
men who join us today will hold top positions with those
Divisions and plants 10 to 15 years from now. One of
those men could well be your classmate—or you.

The ORGANIZATION and RETRIEVAL
of INFORMATION

The organization and retrieval of large volumes of
diverse types of information is rapidly becoming one
of today’s more serious problems. Major areas where
the problem exists include business and industry, the
military, the government, and the scientiﬁc and engi-
neering community itself.

In its simpler forms, the problem may involve, for
example, the automatic handling and analysis of busi-
ness data such as payrolls, sales and manufacturing
ﬁgures, insurance premiums, and other essentially sta-
tistical data. At the other extreme are certain complex
military situations which require the concurrent inter-
pretation, analysis, and integration on a very short time
scale of data from a wide variety of sources, including
ﬁeld reports, photographs, news reports, estimates of
industrial activity, and the like. In many of these situa-
tions, there is the additional requirement to translate
the information from a foreign language into English.

The development in recent years of electronic data
handling equipment is now making possible the
practical solution of many of these problems. Such
equipment has the capability to perform arithmetic
operations, make decisions among alternatives, store

and retrieve large quantities of information, and at
high speed automatically perform long, complex
sequences of operations.

At Ramo-Wooldridge, work is in progress on advanced
information handling systems that are characterized
by large volume and widely different forms of infor-
mation, short time scales, and a variety of uses and
users. The scope of the work includes the planning of
systems and procedures, programming various types of
data handling equipment, and formulation of require-
ments for new equipment. Research is also under way
on the machine translation of foreign languages into
English.

ing ﬁelds are invited to explore the wide range of open-
ings now available:

Q. Mr. Hill, what can I do to get the
most out of my iob interviews?

A. You know, we have the same
question. I would recommend that
you have some information on what
the company does and why you be-
lieve you have a contribution to
make. Looking over company in-
formation in your placement office
is helpful. Have in mind some of the
things you would like to ask and try
to anticipate questions that may

' refer to your speciﬁc interests.

Q. What information do you try to get
during your interviews?

A. This is where we must ﬁll in be-
tween the lines of the personnel
forms. I try to ﬁnd out why partic-
ular study programs have been fol-
lowed, in order to learn basic motiva-
tions. I also try to ﬁnd particular
abilities in ﬁelds of science, or math-
ematics, or alternatively in the more
practical courses, since these might
not be apparent from personnel rec-
ords. Throughout the interview we
try to judge clarity of thinking since
this also gives us some indication of
ability and ultimate progress. One
good way to judge a person, I ﬁnd,
is to ask myself: Would he be easy
to work with and would I like to
have him as my close associate?

Q. What part do first impressions play
in your evaluation of people?

A. I think we all form a ﬁrst im-
pression when we meet anyone.
Therefore, if a generally neat ap-
pearance is presented, I think it
helps. It would indicate that you
considered this important to your-
self and had some pride in the way
the interviewer might size you up.

Q. With only academic training as a
background, how long will it be before
I'll be handling responsible work?

cENEnAL.ELEcrnIc

Interview with General Electric’s

W. Scott Hill

Manager — Engineering Recruiting

Qualities I Look For

When Recruiting Engineers

A. Not long at all. If a man joins a
training program, or is placed direct-
ly on an operating job, he gets
assignments which let him work up
to more responsible jobs. We are
hiring people with deﬁnite consider-
ation for their potential in either
technical work or the management
ﬁeld, but their initial jobs will be
important and responsible.

Q. How will the fact that I've had to
work hard in my engineering studies,
with no time for a lot of outside activi-
ties, affect my employment possibilities?

A. You’re concerned, I’d guess, with
all the talk of the quest for “well-
rounded men.” We do look for this
characteristic, but being president
of the student council isn’t the only
indication of this trait. Through
talking with your professors, for
example, we can determine who
takes the active role in group proj-
ects and gets along well with other
students in the class. This can be
equally important in our judgment.

Q. How important are high scholastic
grades in your decision to hire a man?

A. At G.E. we must have men who
are technically competent. Your
grades give us a pretty good indica-
tion of this and are also a measure
of the way you have applied your-
self. When we ﬁnd someone whose
grades are lower than might be ex-
pected from his other characteristics,
we look into it to ﬁnd out if there
are circumstances which may have
contributed.

Q. What consideration do you give work
experience gained prior to graduation?

A. Often a man with summer work
experience in his chosen academic

ﬁeld has a much better idea of what
he wants to do. This helps us decide
where he would be most likely to
succeed or where he should start his
career. Many students have had to
work hard during college or sum-
mers, to support themselves. These
men obviously have a motivating
desire to become engineers that we
ﬁnd highly desirable.

Q. Do you feel that a man must know
exactly what he wants to do when he is
being interviewed?

A. No, I don’t. It is helpful if he
has thought enough about his in-
terests to be able to discuss some
general directions he is considering.
For example, he might know whether
he wants product engineering work,
or the marketing of technical prod-
ucts, or the engineering associated
with manufacturing. On G-E train-
ing programs, rotating assignments
are designed to help men ﬁnd out
more about their true interests be-
fore they make their ﬁnal choice.

Q. How do military commitments affect
your recruiting?

A. Many young men today have
military commitments when they
graduate. We feel it is to their ad-
vantage and ours to accept employ-
ment after graduation and then ful-
ﬁll their obligations. We have a
limited number of copies of a De-
partment of Defense booklet de-
scribing, in detail, the many ways in
which the latter can be done. Just

quite a few projects, important projects that some
day may mean a great deal to this country. They
sure meant a lot to me. And I wasn’t standing still,‘
either. My salary and my responsibilities have in?
creased with each promotion. That means lots of--,_A 
challenges, new and tough problems that we have to
solve, but that’s the way I like it. So, if you want ._
some advice from this "old grad,” choose the aircraft . 
industry. It’s the wisest choice, I’m in the busineszf-r. 

 

and I know.” 

robably no other industry in America has grow I I
P so fast and advanced so far in a short time as has
the aircraft industry. And yet there is no limit to _
how far man's inventiveness and imagination can  

ush the boundaries. Radical new concepts that- "
would have been unthought of just a few years ago
are the drawing-board problems of today.
Truly aviation is still in the pioneering stage, and
one of the leaders is Northrop Aircraft, which has
been making successful contributions to our 
nation"s defense for over 18 years. Projects such as \, "xx 
the Snark SM-62, world's first intercontinental ll‘ \ 
guided missile, have identiﬁed Northrop as a suc-
cessful pioneer. And new aircraft such as the super=.....«~~..«
sonic, twin—jet T-38 advanced trainer are maintain-
ing this reputation.
Let us tell you more about what Northrop can
offer you. Write now, regardless of your class, to

“But scientists believe that there is a hierarchy of facts.
and that we may make a judicious choice among them.
They are right, for otherwise there would he no science,
and science does exist. One has only to open one’s eyes
to see that the triumphs of industry, which have enriched
so many practical men, would never have seen the light

MORE ON EMITT

Sir:

It cert-ainlly is -a -bright idea -Uo
senvd undergraduates on ‘trips like
the EMITT program, as it is so
very iimportant that people of -the
free W'OI"lllCl get an opportunity to
know each other. America and the
American way of life are so di'ﬁ"er-
en-t that is not always so easy for
you to understand t'he way we live
and ‘behave.

It has, -tlherefore, also been of
great use that so .mJany European
stuideinits have had an opportunity
to visit the United S«t:ates af-ter the
war. It 'h'el:pns -to mutual un'ders~tIand-
ing.

Adams B. Dendix, President
United Paper Mills Lltd.
Copenlhagen, Denmark

Sir:

It was interestinvg to read -tlh-e ar-
ticle on the EMITT .p»rogra.m. I
ﬁnd it a very good idea ‘that usoime
American stuidfensts are able to go
to Europe in the summer, while
oitlhe-rs lnave summer jobs in the
United. States.

When I was a stuidenut of the Roy-
al Technical College of Denmark,
we too had opportunities to travel
abroad on exohanlge basis in our
summer holidays. I have unfortun-
ately never made siuldh a trip be-
cause I «could not afford the money
for the journey, arid we had -to pay
all expenvsesourselves.

Tlherefore, I -think it a ﬁne thing
for the ~awamdee.s to get $500 to trav-
el for, but it that enough? I under-
stand from the article that all the
expenses are estimated at $1,000 per
studenst. What if the studenrt chosen
has not utthe rest of -the money? It

would be bad lu.ck who have to re-
fuse the rawardl.

Perhaps it will be possible to
have more 'Sll'Ju~Cl'BI'l!US travelllilnxg to
Europe, giainuinlg, as you write at «the
end of your article, a broader edu-
cation from miinigling with other
people. You will discover -tlnart it
is possible to live ﬁne wi'thoIu't ‘tele-
vision sets and refrigerators.

ll These letters, sent to Don Wise, a
19 57 EMITT awardee, are indicative
of the good will promoted by the
EMITT program. Perhaps if industry
were to support the program more
generously, the awardees would be
more financially independent through-
out their trip. Also more students.
could take advantage of the. offer.

SE-GREGATION AT PITT

S-irs:

I would -like to congratulate the
SKYSCRAPER on the excellent ar-
-ticle in the last issue concerning
“Tealhouise of tlhe Au-g1u:s.t Moon."
Not only was it a very well hand-led
preview, but it was also a good
start to the soluti-on of one of the
big problems on campus.

In the last few years there has
been a deﬁnite trend toward the
segregation of the students of the
College 'aJI1Jd the Sohools of Engi-

neering and Mines. This has re-
sulted from a comubiniation of stu-
dent altmitudie and -administrative
policy. If SKYISCRAPER woulld
follow through Wllitlh a series of arti-
cles such as (Down in the Valley)
pu'bli'Ci'zi-ng events on lower oamprus
and PITT NEWS would rec-ipro-
cate with a similar isuemies (Up on
«the Hill), it would tend to in-tegrate
the rtwo oamupruses.

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR

Sir:

I would like to congratulate the
SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER for
its series entitled “Pittsburgh’s Pro-
gress.” The series has been an out-
standing aid in stimulating interest
and pride in our city which is of ut-
most importance if Pittsburgh is to
continue its rapid pace of redevel-
opment.

Thank you for helping to make
more people aware of the progress
which our ﬁne city is making.

David L. Lawrence, Mayor
City of Pittsburgh

DISPARITY
Sir:

Please permit me to quote out
of context (for my own pu‘rp=oses)
-the -abstract of an article of the
March '.lSlSU.’CI “Make your scienti-
ﬁc knowledi-ge available to others

MAY 1958

 

I 11 our first five issues this year,

we have presented a series called
“Pittsburgh’s progress.” We feel that
in this series we have featured the
five most important points of this
city’s gigantic renaissance program.

Beginning the series, Ray Sierka’s
coverage of the new water clarifier
plant showed how recent discoveries
in the science of water treatment
are incorporated into this new
clarifier plant.

In December, Ken Rothert dis-
cussed the need for and the sub-
sequent development of the Fort
Pitt Tunnel. The Shippingport
story followed with Warren Duff’s
explanation of how this nuclear-
powered electric generating station

is now serving the Pittsburgh area.
Our February issue highlighted

Mayor David L. Lawrence reviews the

“Pittsburgh Progress” series in SKY-
SCR.APER ENGINEER. Standing

/V0101

the new Allegheny County sewage
disposal system and plant. Dave
Schachter outlined this project that
will insure cleaner rivers and
streams for Allegheny County. Russ
MaXwell’s “Auditorium of the
Future” in our March issue told of
the dome-topped stadium which
will be the main feature of Pitts-
burgh’s‘ new cultural center.

As an “end of the year” special
for the series, a summary of Pitts-
burgh’s entire renaissance program
is presented in this issue.

David L. Lawrence, mayor of
the City of Pittsburgh, is the
author of this month’s article,
“Gateway to the Future.”

The result is an interesting and
comprehensive report of Pittsburgh
—past, present, and future. .
