Of course, you are. . . and should be. But don’t
overlook the fact that “thinking big” really applies
to your own personal growth and achievement-
and not necessarily to the physical size of an
organization. And that’s an important reason for
investigating the opportunities here at Sikorsky
Aircraft.

We believe that our company offers just the
“right-sized” environment for young engineers
seeking strong personal identiﬁcation and stature
opportunities. The technical talent we require can
enjoy diversiﬁed activities in a ﬁeld that permits
full expression of engineering imagination and
professional competence.

your career choice?

At Sikorsky, we pioneered helicopters. Our
continuing objective is to further advance V /STOL
(vertical /short take-off and landing) aircraft.

The engineering programs are stimulating and
far-ranging. Assignments could include joining an
electronic team of twenty to thirty associates——or—
working with a highly selective group of four or
ﬁve on sophisticated problems of antenna radiation,
instrumentation, automatic pilot, automatic stabi-
lization—to name a few.

Your opportunity for personal growth could be
here . . . now. Can we help you “think big” towards
that goal?

A Message From the Dean

By Dr. G. R. Fitterer

I n the United States we are living in the greatest indus-
trial nation in the world at the highest standard of living.
Because of this, we often fail to realize that there are
some people in less fortunate areas of the earth who are
a mere ten or twenty years away from the “discovery of
the wheel.”

To a large extent, the high industrial economy in which
we ﬁnd ourselves is due to the work of engineers. Around
the turn of the century, at a period when our schools were
beginning to graduate an appreciable number of engi-
neers, the economic development of this country “took
off” at an accelerating rate which has never been retarded.
Now we are entering a second industrial revolution com-
plete with automatic control systems, computers, etc. But
what about the undeveloped countries of the world?

In his book, the “Stages of Economic Growth,” W. W.
Rostow (currently an advisor to the President), shows
that in order for a country to develop into a stable self-
sustaining economy, it must first reach a point at which
its apparent savings and investment rates have risen to
over 10% of the net national product. Once this point is
passed, the country “takes-off” at an accelerating pace to
become a modern state.

Today, there are a bare 20% of the countries which
have reached this “take-off” point. These are the countries
incidentally which have some engineering colleges.

In South America, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
and Venezuela are approaching the “take-off” stage, yet
the passage through this barrier is slow and this is
partly because their production of engineers is lagging
materially. The other countries in South America are far
from the “take-off” stage.

In the United States we are currently graduating about
200 engineeers for each million population each year.
The annual needs for engineers in various countries in
South America on this basis would be:

Engineering
Population Graduates
Country (Millions) needed/ year

Argentina ................ .. 20 4,000
Bolivia ...................... . . 3 600
Brazil ....................... .. 62 12,400
Chile ........................ . . 8 1,600
Colombia ................ .. 13 2,600
Ecuador .................... . . 4 800
Paraguay .................. . . 2 400
Peru .......................... . . 10 2,000
Uraguay .................. . . 3 600
Venezuela ................ .. 6 1,200

Total ................ .. 131 26,200

DECEMBER I961

These are the needs, yet Brazil, which has about one-
third the population of the United States, graduates only
about 400 engineers a year. It is true that some of their
students receive degrees in other countries but the num-
bers are not signiﬁcant. Brazil is developing only three per
cent of the engineers it really needs; Chile is producing
about ten per cent; etc.

This, then, poses a major problem for these countries.
If they do not have the engineers to open up the raw
materials, through mines, to build roads, railroads, and
factories of various types, they will never reach maturity
as modern economic states. No amount of social work by
a Peace Corps, or other type of ﬁnancial aid, will per-
manently solve the problem. Engineers are needed all
over the world and if we in the United States do not de-
velop them, the Russians will.

The fastest method to ‘develop engineers for all these
countries would be to establish 3-2 programs between
Liberal Arts colleges in these respective countries and
our engineering schools. In this plan, which Pitt already
has established with the University of the Andes, in
Bogota, Colombia, the student spends three years at the
Liberal Arts College in his own country then comes to
Pitt for the last two years in engineering. A quick estimate
of the possibilities of this plan indicates that at least
10,000 foreign engineers could be graduated per year
from our engineering colleges. This would hasten these
countries toward maturity and frustrate the anti-Ameri-
can agitators who would, nevertheless, welcome the Rus-
sian engineers with open arms.

In days of yore, men feared not only their
mortal enemies, but the elements too. It was
the medieval armorer's task to protect his
chief against foemen, but weather-protection
was a more diﬁﬁcult matter. Thus many a
knight was spent in rusty armor.

Engineers and scientists at Ford Motor
Company, engaged in both pure and applied
research, are coping even today with the
problem of body protection (car bodies, that
is). Through greater understanding of the
chemistry of surfaces, they have developed
new paint primers and undercoatings, new
rustprooﬁng methods, and special sealers
that guard entire car bodies against nature's
corrosive forces—all of which add armor-like
protection to Ford-built cars.

From other scientiﬁc inquiries will undoubt-
edly come new materials with protective
properties vastly superior to those of today.
This is another example of Ford's leadership
through scientific research and engineering.

A Numerical Control is an electronic device designed to
control a machine by use of a punched tape. By control-
ling machines, these production giants enable industry to
reap all the beneﬁts of automated mass production on a
small lot basis. Some of these advantages are: reduced
labor costs, greater machine versatility, greater precision,
better parts quality, and shorter tooling time.

To really understand the importance of this device, let
us compare the techniques used in standard machining
with that of numerical control. In standard machining
the operator is aided by process sheets, jigs, and ﬁxtures,
but still the functions necessary to produce the part are
many and complex.

Numerical control utilizes a system of numbers and let-
ters punched into a tape to completely describe the ma-
chine motions necessary to produce this part.

All data preparation is done by the process engineer
with the help of computers. This eliminates all compu-
tations done by the standard machinist and the time re-
quired to make these computations. Thus, numerical con-
trol takes responsibility out of the machinists hands and
puts it in a much better environment. This eliminates
misjudgment. The machine can then be operated at
peak eﬁiciency with a minimum amount of error.

Numerical Controls are divided into two main groups.
The ﬁrst is known as a “numerical positioning control”
(NPC).

Let’s consider a simple drilling operation to describe
this system. The object is to drill a large number of holes
in a piece of sheet metal. The actual positioning path is
not necessarily impo_rtant as long as it's fast and accurate.
For NPC a movable table set to move in two directions
is installed on the drill press and this table is controlled
by feed screws and servo drives. The drill is set to start
automatically once the table is properly positioned. This
system of positioning can also be used in other machine
functions in more complex machines, such as milling ma-
chines, ﬂame cutters, or vertical turret lathes.

NUMERICAL CONTROLS

By KENNETH WEBER

and ROBERT LISCO

The second type of system regulates the complete posi-
tioning path of the cutter or tool. It’s known as a “con-
tinuous path” or “numerical contouring control” (NCC).
A typical use might be the milling of an intricate groove
in a rocket motor ﬂange. With NCC a computer is used
to calculate all points in increments of 0.0001 inch along
this groove. It also calculates the maximum error, tooling
time needed, and the circle’s center and radius.

With either system many types of data storage are pos-
sible. Each type has good and bad points for particular
jobs. However, it is usually necessary for a plant or com-
pany to choose one form of programming. This eliminates
the need for more than one type of programming equip-
ment and also eliminates the necessity of having special
personnel for programming. Most manufacturers at this

 

KENNETH E. VVEBER, a freshman E.E. with his ﬁrst
article in this issue, became interested in numerical con-
trols after working in the Specialty Control Department of
the General Electric Company as an engineering design
technician. Born in Hogate, Ohio, Ken was graduated by
the Radio Electronic Television Schools, and holds a ﬁrst
class radio-telephone operator’s license. Besides being a

EIGHT CHANNEL TAPE, coded with various data, can be made from
plastic, paper, or other material.

time are trying to standardize both the 8 channel punched
tape and the code, but users will still be able to use the
tape and code most convenient to them.

The code and rules for manipulating it are known as
the language of the system. For drilling in simple point
to point systems, dimensions can be used directly, al-
though they must never be ambiguous. This is the reason
for using a binary number system for more complex jobs.
In this system the symbols “0” and “l” are used and they
can represent “off” and “on” respectively.

Other necessary elements in the system include a
method of converting numerical processing data to cards
or tape; a readout unit on the machine control; a memory
bank to store data until the machine is ready for it; and
built-in precision devices to check and correct the servo
drives if they have acted inaccurately. This gaging sys-
tem gives a ﬂow of data to the correcting units. This re-
adjusts or halts the operation if data is incorrect or ma-
chine response is faulty.

Why are numerical positioning and contouring con-
trols creating vast industries? The answer to this ques-
tion is time savings and tooling cost reduction.

Numerical control can reduce the total production time
by over 75% in many cases. A typical example of this
would be the production by NPC of a booster pump
mounting ﬂange. Lead time for the ﬂange has been re-
duced by 92.67% and tooling time by 98.89%. The actual
machining time has been reduced by 28.50%. Tremen-
dous savings are realized in this reduction in time. Cal-
culated on the basis of toolings costs and manual produc-
tion direct labor vs. NPC programming and production

direct labor for 100 parts, the cost of this part have now.

been reduced to 31/2% of its original cost.

How can reductions of this size be accomplished? Let’s
ﬁrst consider what must be done to this ﬂange. The ﬂange
itself must be milled from east alumnium. It must
contain twenty-one center drilled holes which are drilled
to a certain depth. Of these, four holes must be counter-
bored. By using NPC, jigs are eliminated and the part to
be machined is held in place by general purpose clamps.

DECEMBER I96!

CONTINUOUS CUT using NCC is typical of machining which can
be performed.

Machining time is reduced considerably by a positioning
rate of 150 inches per minute. Even at this speed the re-
peatable accuracy is :0.0005 inch. By using this auto-
matic operation, the machine operator merely loads the
machine, inserts the tape, and presses the start button.
He is then free to run another machine thereby reducing
direct labor costs.

Now consider the savings on some other parts. A steel
casting with 28 holes requiring 13 different operations (13
different tools) including drilling, tapping, reaming, bor-
ing, counterboring, and end milling originally cost $20.50
to machine. Numerical control reduces the cost to $.85.

The production of a stainless steel valve body requiring
59 separate operations such as drilling, counter-boring
and reaming originaly cost $6.25 to machine. Numerical
control reduced the cost to $1.25 and boosted the produc-

tion rate by 440%.

A steel barrel cam, requiring milling of up to 600 sep-
arate points along the length of the cam, originally took
35 hours to mill. Numerical contro.l reduced this time to
61/; hours and cut labor cost by 80%. The nominal ma-
chine accuracies for this barrel cam are 1/ l00,000th of a
circle (13 sec.) for index centers; :0.000l in over a 10
inch range for the table.

Until 1959, most controls consisted of a number of re-
lays and stepping switches to perform all logic functions.
In the last two years, a completely new concept for these
logic functions has been introduced for numerical control.
An example of this is General Electric’s Mark Century
Numerical Contouring and Positioning Control.

The Mark Century Numerical Contouring and Posi-
tioning Control make use of solid-state logic circuits in a
continuous-path, high-resolution system. It is designed to
control precision contouring such as drilling, turning,
grinding, and ﬂame cutting operations.

The equipment operation can best be understood if the
system is broken into functions. These functions do not
constitute the control in its entirety, but serve to give a
better understanding of the operational functions of it.

The continuous-path system utilizes storage units and
counters for an almost uninterrupted ﬂow of command
information to the machine. The tape reader conveys the
coded tape information to the data-input logic circuits.
Here this information is decoded and sent to the proper
storage units. The storage units empty the information
into counters which feed the control director. As the ma-
chine is being controlled by this block of information,
new information is fed to the storage units. As soon as
the machine exhausts the existing counter information,
the storage units empty their new information into the
counters. This transfer of information requires only a few
micro—seconds. Thus, for all practical. purposes, the ma-
chine is receiving a constant ﬂow of command infor-
mation.

The control director transforms input data into posi-
tion command information which directs the machine
motion along a speciﬁed path. Function generators in the
director incorporate Digital Differential Analyzer com-
puting techniques to determine the path the cutter will
take during countouring operations. The function gener-
ators continuously produce digital position commands for
all controlled axes. These commands are in increments of
magnitude of either .0001 or .000Ol of an inch.

Position feedback units monitor each motion. The
monitored signal is compared with the command signal,
and any difference is fed back as an error in position.
This error is then applied to the servo drive.

The servo drive converts the error signal into machine
motion, thus synchronizing the position of the machine
member with the command signal.

Four different types of servo drives are available: ampli-
tlyne generator controlled d-c motors, special Thymotrol
controlled d-c motors, electro-hydraulic valve-controlled
hydraulic motors, and elcctro-hydraulic valve—controlled
pistons. The application usually determines the type of

OPERATOR’S CONTROL PANEL shows all standard and some auxili-
ary functions. Note tape reader below manual control panel,

servo supplied.

Manual data input is supplied with each control. The
operator of the machine and control by use of manual
data input, can perform all functions that the tape can
command. If power is lost during contouring operations,
synchronism is lost, also. However, when power is re-
stored, the machine can resume operations without error.
The operator simply returns the machine to the Machine
Zero Position, backs up the tape one block of information
and, by means of the manuscript of the tape information,
restores the machine to the position described by that
block of tape. He then depressed the Data Read—in but-
ton, and the machine continues forming the desired
product.

With a Feed Rate Override function, the operator can
override any programmed feed rate with a sixteen posi-
tion switch. An override rate of 0% to 150% of the pro-
grammed rate can be manually controlled in increments
of 10%. This allows the operator to change the pro-
grammed feed rate to suit his needs at any time. Usually

this is done only for the prototype part. In this way, any
mistakes in the program tape can be detected and cor-
rected without harm to the machine.

A Feed Hold Function is part of the basic equipment.
Depressing this button during contouring operations
brings the feed rate to zero and causes all motion to come
to rest in synchronization. Releasing this button causes
contouring operations to proceed as if uninterrupted.

Since all tape information consists of an odd number
of holes, a Reading Error or Parity Check protection is
provided. \/Vhen an odd number of holes is not read, the
tape reader is stopped and the Reading Error indicator
light is illuminated. V\/hen data in the active command is

exhausted, the motion comes to rest at the last command.
The operator can then check the tape manuscript for this
block of information and insert the needed information
by means of the Manual Data Input function. Depressing
this Data Read—in button will resume tape operations with
no error. However, if a new copy of this tape is readily
available, the new tape can be inserted in place of the
faulty tape. The new tape is positioned to read this block
of information next, and operations can be resumed by
depressing the Data Read-in button.

manual inspection is eliminated. Any accidental holes in
the tape are detected, and new tape can be obtained be-
fore harm to the machine or the work piece can occur.

A mirror—image countouring function can produce a
symmetrical product with only 1A—in some cases, 1/g~—of
the complete tape program for the part. If the part is
symmetrical about any two axes, a program for these two
axes in the positive direction is all that is required to pro-
duce the part. The machine tool is positioned at the axis
of symmetry and the tape is run. When these operations
are complete, the image portion opposite the axis of sym-
metry can be run with the same tape by ﬂicking the
Mirror-Image switch. This transforms all commands for
positive directions from these axes into negative com-
mands. The control then commands the machine to per-
form these operations again, but on the negative side of
the symmetry axis.

An Out of Synchronism function keeps a constant check
on the machine motion. It compares machine motion with

the input data. If a difference is detected which exceeds
a ﬁxed amount, all motion is brought to rest, and an in-
dication light is illuminated. This function maximizes
accuracy, and protects the machine when an unusual tool
or work condition exists.

Auxiliary functions, such as Tool Change, Collant ON
and OFF, Spindle Speed Changes, etc., may be controlled
by means of tape where desired. Position Indication, Cut-
ter Compensation, Thread Cutting, and Controlled Accel-
eration and Deceleration are available as modiﬁcations.

Since 1947, General Electric alone has installed over
500 controls on over 50 different machine tool manufac-
turer’s products. These numerically-controlled machine
tools are operating in every major metalworking ﬁeld.

Many numerical control manufacturers have backlogs
for orders through 1964 and some as far ahead as 1968.
Why should there be such a great demand? The answer
lies in the performance of existing controls. High accur-
acy, savings in time and money, repeatability, and more
complex products are the four keys to this answer. Only
numerical control has all four keys in one unit, and is
still priced within the range most machine tool manufac-
turers can afford.

A second sun: made in U. S.A.

The sun produces energy through nuclear fusion—a gigantic
hydrogen explosion that has been going on for more than 500
million years. We may duplicate it. Scientists at Princeton
University are experimenting with a Stellerator to attain con-
trolled nuclear fusion that will produce endless energy from the
hydrogen in sea water. The Stellerator is supported by 17 USS
Quality Forgings that could be made from only one material
—a new, non-magnetic Stainless Steel called Tenelon, devel-
oped by United States Steel.

Although the Stellerator is strictly experimental, there would
be no nuclear programs of any type without steel. The very
heart of an atomic generating plant—the reactor vessel—must
be steel, whether it's the power plant of a nuclear submarine
or a commercial generating station. In addition to the reactor,
the power station literally bristles with tons of special steels
developed in the laboratories and produced in the mills of
United States Steel. If nuclear power is the door to America's
future, the key is steel. America Grows With Steel.

FLUOROCARBONS

Bearings so frictionless they never need lubrication,
improved water repellants, piping that resists fuming red
nitric acid, and startling improvements in electrical equip-
ment are all possible because of the discovery of an amaz-
ing new family of chemicals, the ﬂuorocarbons.

Fluorocarbons, as the name suggests, are formed from
ﬂuorine, the most active of the elements, and carbon, the
element whose atoms most easily unite with each other to
build chain molecules. It is the long, straight-chained
ﬂuorocarbon molecules, closely packed, with a strong bond
between the carbon and ﬂuorine atoms, which make these
compounds the most stable known.

Fluorocarbons are inert to almost every chemical. Be-

compounds. Even some of the disadvantages of ﬂuoro-
carbons, inherent in their family, have been overcome
since their introduction to the market right after the be-
ginning of World War II.

The discovery of ﬂuorocarbons can be traced to the
Freon series of halogenated hydrocarbon refrigerants
which had already gained wide acceptance by the time
World War II began. Investigation of the Freons led to
the discovery of polytetraﬂuoroethylene, abbreviated TFE,
and commonly known by the trade name Teﬂon.

Teﬂon has been manufactured for commercial purposes
by E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company since semi-
plant production began in 1941. The chemical process
involved in making Teﬂon may be divided into four main
reactions. In the ﬁrst, ﬂuorspar and sulfuric acid are re-
acted to produce hydrogen ﬂuoride and calcium ﬂuoride.
The hydrogen ﬂuoride is then combined with chloroform
to form chlorodiﬂuoromethane and hydrogen chloride.
The third reaction consists of heating the chlorodiﬂuoro-
methane, which then decomposes into tetraﬂuoroethylene
and hydrogen chloride. In the ﬁnal reaction, the tetra-
ﬂuoroethylene monomer is subjected to high temperatures
and pressures to convert it to the polymer, Teﬂon.

Another ﬂuorocarbon material, discovered shortly after
Teﬂon, is Kel-F, manufacturer by the M. W. Kellog Com-
pany. Triﬂuorochloroethylene, as it is technically named,
was developed to withstand the extremely corrosive con-
ditions encountered in making the atomic bomb. Colorless
and chemically inert, this plastic has zero moisture ab-
sorption.

Fluorocarbons have various applications in many indus-
tries. The electrical industry, for example, was quick to
capitalize on the many unique properties of these ma-
terials. With wide usable temperature ranges, low mois-
ture absorption, high mechanical stability, and good di-
electric constants, ﬂuorocarbon electrical parts have found
many diverse applications. These parts are usually easy
to manufacture, for ﬂuorocarbons can be molded into odd
shapes, or, they can be made into sheet or tape form.

Fluorosint, one of the new materials recently introduced
to the electrical industry, is made from TF E plus several
other materials designed to remove some of TFE’s unde-

sirable properties. Speciﬁcally, Fluorosint has improved
mechanical and thermal properties, yet retained TFE’s
desirable chemical and electrical properties. The thermal
expansion of this material is practically the same as that
of aluminum, and it has a dissipation factor varying be-
tween 0.0005 and 0.001. Fluorosint has a usable frequency
range of up to 10,000 me, and is much easier to manufac-
ture than TF E.

Because ﬂuorocarbon solids resist the action of corrosive
chemicals, fuels, and hydraulic ﬂuids, they are used to
make gaskets and piping to handle these materials.

The Armstrong Cork Company has developed a new
method of making ﬂuorocarbon gaskets specially designed
for use at high temperatures. In this process, asbestos or
organic ﬁbers are coated with ﬂuorocarbon resins. An al-

high temperatures in acids and other corrosive fluids. Teflon bearings
are known for their low coefficient of friction.

most unbelieveable temperature range of ——425°F to
—}—500°F, with excellent torque retention, may be en-
dured by these materials. Inert to most chemicals over
wide temperature ranges, the ﬂuorocarbon coated ﬁbers
have good dielectric properties.

The potential uses for these materials, besides gaskets
for fuel and hydraulic systems, are as construction mate-
rial for baffles and ﬁre walls. They can also be made into
components for cyrogenic systems, dry transformers, con-
verters, circuit breakers, motors, and switches.

Still another use of ﬂuorocarbon chemicals lies in the
ﬁeld of water repellants. Through research, it was dis-
covered that surface wettability is in direct proportion to
the surface energy. In other words, the lower the surface
energy, the lower the tendency for a fabric to get wet. It
was also found that the carbon triﬂuoride radical pro-
duces surfaces with extremely low surface energies, mainly
because of its low electron density. This results in the
close packing of the molecules.

DECEMBER I961

A MAGNETIC CLUTCH, with terminals able to withstand 500 volts,
operates continuously at temperatures of 400°F. The terminals are
made from Teflon.

One of the biggest drawbacks to using ﬂuorocarbon
chemicals as water repellants on cotton fabrics, for more
than specialty applications, was the high cost of the ﬂuoro-
chemicals. One of those tested, FC-208, produced by Min-
nesota Mining and Manufacturing Co., costs over $5.00
a pound. Further research was carried on to determine
the most efficient method of applying the chemicals,
hoping to reduce the thickness of the coating, and thereby
the cost. As a result of this research, the cost of the water
repellant was reduced from 50¢ to 28¢ per pound of cot-
ton, a savings of 44%. It was found that best results could
be» achieved by combining the various ﬂuorocarbons tested
with other water repellants. These combinations are vir-
tually unalfected by laundering or dry cleaning, and are
quite resistant to short periods of watering. Also, certain
combinations cause almost no yellowing to fabrics being
treated. Even exposure to abrasion showed little or no
reduction in properties.

Fluorocarbon ﬂuids have also found many industrial
applications, especially where conditions. of extreme cor-
rosion and high thermal stress exist. F luorocarbon liquids,
like their relatives in the chemical family, the ﬂuorocar-

bon solids, remain non-reactive with most chemicals over
a wide range of temperatures. They retain their ability
to ﬂow freely at low temperatures and have a high density.

There are two major types of ﬂuorocarbon liquids,
bromotriﬂuoroethylene (BFE) and chlorotriﬂuorethylene
(CFE), the latter being the most popular because of its
lower price, $10 to $12 per pound. BFE, which has a high-
er density than CFE, is custom synthesized to meet cus-
tomer’s need. The cost ranges anywhere from $150 to
$200 per pound or higher.

Sometimes used as lubricants and hydraulic ﬂuids,
ﬂuorocarbon liquids, because of their high density, may
also be used as ﬂotation and damping ﬂuids. With a
density more than twice that of water, and a low tempera-
ture viscosity, these ﬂuids do not form cracks when cooled
as lows as —65°F. Viscosity of the BFE type of ﬂuoro-
carbon oil varies from 1.84 cs (light oils) to 5619 cs (heavy
oils) for temperatures between l45°F to 190°F.

In electrical applications, these ﬂuids may be used as
liquid dielectrics or Coolants. Already they have proved
their worth when used for liquid transformer insulation,
permanent lubrication for instruments such as clocks, and
as low temperature Coolants for high power transmitting
tubes.

Naturally the chemical industry has observed the de-
velopment of ﬂuorocarbon materials with considerable
interest. It may turn out that the chemical industry will
become its own best customer for these materials. The
reason for this is that ﬂuorocarbons, because of their rela-
tive chemical inertness, lend themselves to equipment
where extreme corrosion resistance is the main criteria.
For this type of job they are unsurpassed in performance
as piping or gaskets. Among the materials these com-
pounds are completely resistant to may be included bro-
mine, chlorine, fuming sulfuric acid, fuming red nitric

TEFLON PRINTED CIRCUT PADS enable manufacturers to use an
"oven technique" for soldering. Wires are stuck through the holes
in the pads, and rings of solder are slipped onto the wires. As the
assembly passes through an infrared oven, the solder melts and the
connection is made.

acid, aqua regia, thionylchloride, and a host of organic
solvents.

Although the chemical inertness of the ﬂuorocarbons
represents their most unique property, there are really
six main advantages of using ﬂuorocarbon materials.

(1) LENGTH OF SERVICE. Unless destroyed by me-
chanical means, ﬂuorocarbons will last forever in
most applications.

(2) INERTNESS. Except for liquid alkali metals and
ﬂuorine gas, few chemicals have any effect whatso-
ever.

(3) LOW COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION. Fluoro-
carbon parts usually have no need for lubrication.

(4) GOOD DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES. Unaffected
by temeprature variations from —-160°]? to 500°F,
Teﬂon, for example, has a ﬂat frequency response
out to 90,000 me.

(5) EASE OF APPLICATION TO OTHER MATE-
RIALS. Fluorocarbons may be applied as paints,
lacquers, baked-type coatings, or bonded to vari-
ous metals with industrial adhesives.

(6) LIGHT WEIGHT. In parts designed for rockets
and missiles, this requirement can be of critical
value.

As the demand for materials able to withstand extreme
conditions of corrosion and temperature change continues
to grow, the market for ﬂuorocarbon products will un-
doubtedly expand even more rapidly than it has in the
past few years. One of the biggest drawbacks now con-
fronting users of ﬂuorocarbon materials is their high cost.
As markets increase, and mass production methods are
improved, substantial price drops may be expected. The
Teﬂon series, for example, had an average price in 1940
of $18 per pound. By last year, the post had been reduced
to only $3.60 per pound. With similar reductions in price
of other ﬂuorocarbon chemicals, undoubtedly more manu-
facturers will ﬁnd themselves able to take advantage of
the remarkable properties of the ﬂuorocarbon family.

Build with the carefree beauty of stainless steel

 

DECEMBER I96!

Handsome appliances and gleaming counter tops that stay
bright and are so easy to wipe clean. . .even the kitchen sink be-
comes a thing of beauty when it is made of shining stainless steel
—the useful metal that was developed after years of research.

Whether you’re building or remodeling, stainless steel gives
a lifetime of value . . . saves many dollars in upkeep. You can
now have gutters and downspouts that are almost indestructible
because they won’t rust or rot. And the strength of stainless
makes possible door and window screening so ﬁne you hardly
know it’s there.

The secret of stainless steel lies in chromium—one of many
indispensable alloying metals developed by Union Carbide. They
are typical of the hundreds of basic materials created through
research by the people of Union Carbide in metals, as well as
carbons, chemicals, gases, plastics and nuclear energy.

THIS IS EMITT

The achievement of a “total education” has for years
been the goal of most engineering students. The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh’s trimester system, with its rigorous
schedule and few breathing spells, has made it difficult
for many students to fulﬁll this goal. However, Pitt offers
an outstanding program to engineering students that has
a primary purpose of furthering this concept.

The Engineering and Mines International Travel and
Training program is designed to give an engineer the op-
portunity to broaden his interests, ideas, and opinions by
travelling and working in a foreign country during the
summer months. Sponsored by the Engineering and Mines
Cabinet, the EMITT award is a grant of $500 for a Pitt
Engineer, between his Junior and Senior year, to travel
abroad. To understand the program, it is necessary to
have background information about the IAESTE pro-

gram.

U.5. STUDENTS LEAVE their KLM chartered flight for a summer of

A program that offers you
an opportunity to travel and
Work in a foreign country.

IAESTE, formally known as the International Associa-
tion for Exchange of Students for Technical Experience,
is a nonproﬁt organization which helps students of engi-
neering and sciences to obtain summer on-the-job train-
ing with an industrial company in a foreign country. The
various member organizations also arrange programs of
entertainment and travel for the students with the sup-
port of industries, universities, student organizations, and
other organizations related to the IAESTE in the coun-
tries where the students are employed.

Administered by leading educators in member coun-
tries, IAESTE has the dual purpose of training advanced
undergraduate students of the sciences and technology in
the industrial techniques of other nations and of build-
ing a foundation for international understanding and
good will between potential leaders and host companies.
The students spend a minimum of eight weeks in on—the—
job training, after which they may tour various countries.
The employers pay the students sufﬁciently to enable them
at least to cover their living expenses during the train-
ing period.

IAESTE meets once a year to receive and place the stu-
dents from the member countries. In addition to placing
students, the annual conference works on such problems
as membership, exemptions from income tax, funds to
assist necessitous students, improving training programs,
publicity, and other problems. The conference alone is a
stimulating cooperation for international harmony. Al-
though IAESTE gets the student a job, the individual
campus program must be handled by the school and uni-
versities.

Development of the EMITT program at Pitt began
in June 1955. At that time a group of engineering stu-
dents who were stall‘ members of the SKYSCRAPER EN-
GINEER became aware of the IAESTE program by read-

man, Bill Hosick, review this year's EMITT program.

ing the PURDUE ENGINEER, the student magazine of
Purdue University. Inquiries were made by these students
concerning the IAESTE program and in September 1955,
the program was discussed before the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet. A chairman was appointed to fully in-
vestigate the program and to determine how the engineer-
ing students at Pitt could participate in the IAESTE pro-
gram. This was done, and in December, three students
completed applications for employment the following
summer. In February 1956, the ﬁrst of the applicants was
given employment in Scotland; later the second was placed
in Germany. The third received word in May of place-
ment in Sweden.

The February placement notiﬁcations brought the im-
mediate problem of ﬁnances to hand. The E 8c M Cabinet,
realizing the necessity of making sure that at least one
man participated in the program, set up a fund of $500
to be awarded to a deserving student at the discretion of
a committe of four faculty and three student leaders. This
money came from the E 8c M treasury, which earned its
funds from student dances and refreshment machines in
the student lounge. At the same time, the committee sug-
gested that local industries and civic organizations might
be interested in helping such a program. The committee
also agreed that the success of the initial program would
determine if it would be continued in years to follow.

The committee then proceeded to choose an awardee
on the basis of scholarship, previous industrial experi-
ence, interest in the program, and university and com-
munity activities. The award was named the Engineering
and Mines International Travel and Training award,
better known as EMITT.

The solving of one problem led to the formation of
others. How would the EMITT awardee react to opinions
of Americans in foreign nations? What about his budget?
His passage tickets? What should he wear? Whom could
he meet who would give him a better insight on the na-
tions, industries, and communities that he would visit?
In short, how could he get the most from his weeks
abroad? These problems were handled by the directors
of the Nationality Rooms Program, who, with their asso-
ciations and contacts abroad, were well versed in inter-

DECEMBER I96!

national travel. In addition conferences led by professors
from the University faculty, as well as prominent educa-
tors and civic leaders from abroad, were held with other
Pitt scholars who were planning to travel abroad that
summer.

Upon the return of the 1956 EMITT awardee, the
EMITT committee, the administration, and the E 8c M
Cabinet realized the great value of the IAESTE program.
The committee immediately decided to sponsor a candi-
date in 1957 and elected Paul Thomas, the 1956 awardee,
student chairman of the EMITT committee.

The ﬁrst task was the formation of a year round pro-
gram. Interest in the program had to be stimulated and
publicity had to be increased. The PITT NEWS, local
newspapers, and the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER were
used. The most thorough method was speaking before
the students. Seminar talks and dinner speeches before
civic and student groups were arranged. The publicity of
the program proved to be a job more of explanation than
one of selling.

With this concrete program established by the A1957
committee, the EMITT-IAESTE program continued
through the years at Pitt. In 1957, through the efforts of
Dr. G. R. Fitterer, Dean of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines, the Alumni Association pledged $700, allow-
ing a second award to be made. Thus in the summer of
1957, two Pitt engineering students, Donald Hoover, Met
E ’58 and Donald Wise, Chem E ’58, were sent abroad
through the EMITT-IAESTE program. The program was
again expanded in 1958 to three awards: Michael Com-
panion, PE ’59, Joseph Fitzharris, Chem E ’59, and James
Terrill, Met E ’59. In 1959 there were again two awards:
William Blankenstein, EE ’60, worked and travelled in
Germany, while Hamilton Sterling, PE ’60, spent the
summer working in Turkey. Robert Zeigler, EE ’6l, re-
ceived the 1960 EMITT award and was placed in Eind-
hoven, Holland. William Hosick, Met E '62, the recipient
of the 1961 EMITT award, chose England for his sum-
mer's work.

Since the beginning of the fall trimester, the EMITT
committee, with William Hosick as chairman, has been
working to expand the program again to more than one
award. The committee is now preparing to review the
applications for the 1962 award. To be eligible a student
must have a minimum of one trimester and a maximum
of three trimesters remaining upon his return to Pitt
in the fall of 1962. The award will be made on the basis
of scholarship, previous industrial experience, university
and community activities, and above all a sincere desire
to share experiences obtained abroad with other engi-
neering students, the University, and the community.

Engineering juniors, here is your opportunity to broad-
en your interest, ideas and opinions by travelling and
working in a foreign country. Don’t pass up this oppor-
tunity because of a lack of industrial experience or an
unimpressive academic or activities record, for a sincere
interest in the program will deﬁnitely be a deciding factor.
The dealine for EMITT applications is only a few days
away. By June you may be on your way to Europe as a
1962 EMITT awardee.

Westinghouse puts the future in your hands

A ‘ROCKET ENGINE’ MAY GENER-
ATE TOMORROW/‘S ELECTRICITY

   

   

Today's electricity is produced in some of the biggest, most ingenious and precise equipment ever built. One part. . . the turbine . . . is as
big as a locomotive, revolves at the speed of sound, is so hot it glows a cherry red, and its parts fit together like a fine watch. That's today's
best method, and it's gone about as far as it can go. And so Westinghouse, which builds this equipment, is experimenting with completely
new methods of producing electricity. Some of them are rather exotic. One method produces electricity by shooting a stream of gas between
a set of magnets. Sounds simple, but this is like handling the roaring exhaust of a rocket. The gas travels 2,000 miles an hour at 5,000
degrees F. This method is magnetohydrodynamics. Called MHD for short. It is a jawbreaker of a problem. But Westinghouse and other
companies are nearing a solution. A Westinghouse MHD generator has produced electricity for 52_ minutes. That's five times as long as
any other has ever run. If MHD “works,'7 we will be in a new world of electric power. Problems like this and other problems face talented
scientists and engineers at Westinghouse. For information about a career with Westinghouse, an equal opportunity employer, see our

To create on a universal basis requires intelligence to
an inconceivable degree. IT, a quantity of energy so g_i—
gantic as to dwarf the power output of a nova sun, has
this intelligence, stored in each particle of energy like a
massive computer. IT is unique in what we call a basic
four dimensional space, traversing from the “beginning
to the endward of the durational dimension. Since, IT
is in this dimension, there is no length, width, height———
only a knowledge of this thing's ability to create and ex-
pand. IT’s presence will always be felt, even though it
has long since created this part of the universe, and has
passed fatheri along. How far? To what extent?

I stand on rails of steel and gaze southward. In the dis-
tance the rails converge. I turn to the north and still the
rails exist, only to close the gap and form a point in the
distance. I see a point. Only a speck, and yet I know that
if I were to remove myself and stand alongside of that
point, I would see still another point, and another, and
another. How can I be certain that there is no more rail,
unless I reach a point where I no longer see a converg-
ence. Then I have reached the end. The end, no, for I
see someone driving track, and suddenly there is another
point in the distance.

IT creates, and after IT creates, there is a rest, a few
time cycles while the wasted energy surges back into the
sea of particles constituting the Ma-ss, and then it con-
tinues the endless journey.

Spring’s warmth saturates the earth, and at a far off place

ﬂowers and a forest of trees die. The once sun-baked soil
is hard and crusty with ice, and the denizens of the land

The universe is a balance of life and death. For each
green ﬂower a brown decaying one. For each particle of
matter that is created another is dissipated. The eternal
cycle of creation and destruction. So, the thing which we
call IT creates and moves through the tides of duration.

Ah! Look, in the sky, amidst the myriad of stars, a new
light. Another star has been created. A new sun to warm
a new planet. A new civilization will be born. Now . . .
One must die.

Edward H. Sussenguth, Jr. (B.A., Harvard '54; M.S. in E.E.,
MIT '59) has investigated the theoretical requirements of
an automated design system for advanced cryotron-circuit
computers.

HE WORKS WITH A NEW DIMENSION
IN COMPUTER DESIGN

Thin film cryotrons may make possible computers of small
size and truly prodigious speeds.

The speeds of today's computers are limited mainly by
device switchingtimes. Speeds of cryotron computers would
be limited mainly by signal propagation times between
devices.

Automation of Logical Circuits. Edward Sussenguth has
studied methods of design which will reduce the distance
between devices to a minimum. He hopes that these will
contribute to a completely automatic design system.

Ultimately, then, the systems designer would specify his
needs in terms of Boolean equations and feed them into a
computer. The computer would (a) design the logical cir-
cuits specified by the equations, (b) translate the logical
circuits into statements describing the interconnections,
(c) from the interconnections, position the devices in an
optimal fashion, (cl) from this configuration, print out the
masks to be used in the evaporation process by which
these circuits are made.

This is a big order, but Edward Sussenguth and his col-
leagues have already made significant progress. Their work
may well have a profound effect on computer systems in
the coming years.

Orientation: the future. One of the exciting things about
computer development is this orientation towards the
future. If a man wants to match his personal growth with
the growth of computer systems, his future can be virtually
unlimited. This is true of all the fields associated with com-
puter systems— research, development, manufacturing,
programming, marketing. The IBM representative will be
glad to discuss any one of these fields with you. Your place-
ment office can make an appointment. All qualified appli-

SUMMER IN EUROPE 

M y trip to Europe this summer actually began in early
January, for it was then that my wife and I began our
months of planning and anticipation that were as much
a part of the trip to us as the actual ﬂight across the
ocean. Not only was this the first trip to Europe for both
of us, but also our honeymoon, for we were married only
two weeks before our plane departed from New York.
The IAESTE charter ﬂight to Amsterdam on a KLM
Royal Dutch super constellation was very smooth and un-
eventful, but painfully slow. The seventy other students
aboard the ﬂight were as anxious as my wife and I to
begin our summer in Europe, and the air was tense with
excitement and anticipation.

Upon our arrival in Amsterdam, we travelled by train to
Hook-van-Holland, and then by boat across a very rough
channel to England. Although there is a housing short-
age in England, we were quite fortunate to be provided
very nice living acommodations. We boarded with a fam-
ily of four in Westbury—on-Trym, a small community
located midway between Avonmouth and Bristol. Our
home for these two months was a modestly furnished two
story duplex, as were most houses in the community. It
was surrounded with a small, well kept lawn and several
beautiful ﬂower beds. I call it our home because from
the ﬁrst day, the Carey’s treated us as part of the family
rather than as boarders. We ate all our meals with the
family, including an evening tea. On several occasions we
spent weekends with them at the beach. They even took
us on an English style picnic, which was identical to our
picnics with the exception that we played cricket and
soccer rather than baseball and football.

My job for the summer at the Imperial Smelting Cor-
poration in Avonmouth proved to be as interesting as I
had anticipated. Imperial’s Avonmouth works is primarily
a zinc smelting plant which produces both zinc and lead,
as well as sulfuric acid as an important by-product.

I was assigned to the plant’s Roasting Development
Section. The roasting process is a vital part of both the

30

new zinc blast furnace developed by the Imperial Sme.lt-
ing Corporation and the vertical retort operation, as well
as the source of sulfur dioxide for the sulfuric acid plant.
There are three sintering machines in operation at this
plant, two downdraft strands to produce soft sinter fines
for the vertical retort bricketting process, and one updraft
strand to produce a hard sinter for the blast furnace.
Sintering is a process in which the zinc ores along with
a ﬂux and a fuel, if necessary, are placed on a long moving
grate, ignited and blown with air until agglomerated into
a pasty mass. This agglomerate is water cooled to a
solid state. The resulting clinkers resemble somewhat the
larger clinkers taken out of a coal furnace.

THE INVINCIBLE EDINBURGH CASTLE overlooks a park paralleling
the main street of Edinburgh.

Our section was primarily interested in developing a
hard sinter from a variety of ores that would satisfy all
necessary metal and flux conditions and still maintain
sufficient mechanical properties to support a high column
of burden in the blast furnace without crushing. This was
no small order, for I worked with another metallurgist
and several technicians for seven weeks on different varia-
tions of one set of ores. The ﬁrst step was determining
the correct proportions of each ore and ﬂux so that the
ﬁnal sinter would contain the correct‘ chemical composi-
tion. To do this, a set of ﬁve simultaneous equations con-
taining the ﬁve unknown concentrations had to be set up
and solved on a computer developed speciﬁcally for this
task by the Instrumentation Section at Avonmouth. Once
this dry mix was determined, the water content of each
constituent had to be determined and an initial mix was
established. Then the constituents were weighed, mixed
together, and sintered on a small static pallet. Three ther-
mocouples were placed at diPfere°nt height intervals in the
mix when sintering, and an accurate record of tempera-
tures was made by an automatic recorder. The ﬁnal
sinter cake was cooled, crushed, and sized to plus 1/2”
minus 2", then subjected to a rattle test developed by the
Roasting Section to determine the ability of the sinter
to withstand crushing in the furnace.

Although this program was composed essentially of

DECEMBER I96!

mechanical operations that required no metallurgical
background, I feel that I gained a great deal of technical
experience. This may be attributed mainly to my boss,
Colon Harris, and my co—workers who took the time to
explain in detail the reactions taking place and the re-
lationship between the standards we were using on our
small static pallet and the ﬁnal product of the large
sintering machine. In addition, they explained the oper-
ation of the many other processes in the plant, including
the new crushing house, the sulfuric acid plant, the ver-
tical retort plant and the new zinc blast furnace. This
technical experience certainly provided a valuable sup-
plement to my curricula at Pitt.

After I completed my work at Avonmouth, my wife and
I rented an auto and motored through northern England
and Scotland. The trip through Scotland was one of the
most scenic trips of our entire journey. For hours we
drove along the banks of the famous Lochs of Scotland
and through secluded valleys with beautiful mountains
rising sharply on both sides. This memorable drive ended
in Edinburgh, the most picturesque city of Britain. Over-
looking this city and dominating the terrain for miles is
Edinburgh Castle. It is one of the largest and most in-
vincible fortresses in Great Britain and Europe. Parallel-
ing the cities main street several thousand feet directly
beneath the castle walls, is a beautiful park, with lush
green lawns, countless ﬂower beds, and a bandstand where
free concerts may be enjoyed several times a week. From
Edinburgh we traveled to Dover and set sail for the con-
tinent. Our last view of this island kingdom that had been
our home for two months, was the magniﬁcent white cliffs
of Dover which rose sharply out of the sea and remained
on the horizon for almost the entire trip.

A TYPICAL ENGLISH DOUBLE-DECKER BUS unloads its passengers
at the city centre of Bristol.

Once on the continent we headed directly for Paris. In
our short stay at Paris, we could visit only a few of the
many famous sights of this fabulous city. We climbed to
the top of the Eiffel Tower and strolled down the Champs
Elysees from the Arc de Triomphe. We spent almost a
full day wandering through the galleries of the Louvre,
admiring the priceless masterpieces we had often read
about. From Paris, we traveled by rail to Barcelona, Spain.
On this trip we experienced European holiday train travel
at its peak. There is no limit to the number of tickets
sold for any particular train, so it is possible and quite
probable on summer weekends that all seats have been
reserved for weeks ahead on a train. We were very for-
tunate indeed to ﬁnd two unreserved 2nd Class seats for
this 18 hour journey. The train departed a full ten min-
utes ahead of schedule simply because there wasn’t room
left for single person to even stand in the aisles. These
people rode in the aisles for 18 hours without a com-
plaint. They were happy that they were on their way and
had a place to stand.

We arrived in Barcelonaearly Saturday afternoon and
found the city almost as crowded as the train. It took a
Spanish speaking tourist guide almost ﬁve hours of tele-
phoning and bargaining to ﬁnd us accommodations with-
in our budget. I am sure that on our own, we would still
be looking for a place to sleep in that crowded city. The
following day we attended a bull ﬁght at one of the city’s
several bull rings. Although by our standards the ﬁght
seemed unnecessarily brutal, this magniﬁcent spectacle
made the long trip worthwhile. We had the unique op-
portunity of seeing one of the city’s best young matadors
lose the seat of his pants on the horn of a huge charging
bull. The matador was not hurt, except probably his
pride, for on the next pass he killed the bull with one
well placed thrust of his sword. Judging from the crowds’
wild applause, the matadors’ courage and determination
far outweighed his slight misjudgment.

From Barcelona we traveled to Nice and the French
Riviera. Here we spent two days soaking up the sun and

32

 

enjoying the refreshing blue Mediterranean Sea. We
found the pebble beach as rough and uncomfortable, and
the bikinis as prevelant and scant, as all reports had indi-
cated they would be. From Nice we traveled by train
along the beautiful Mediterranean coast to Pisa.

Many times on this trip, I discovered that ﬁrst impres-
sions were grossly misleading. A good example of this oc-
curred on this trip from Nice to Pisa. I have a keen in-
terest in European cars, and as our train rolled through
southern France I noticed that there were very few autos
on the highways. VVithin a few hours we crossed into
Italy. As the train continued to Pisa I noticed that there
were cars and trucks waiting at every railroad crossing,
and that the closer we approached Pisa, the more vehicles
were lined up waiting. From this brief observation, I got
the impression that northern Italy was well mobilized
and that Pisa must be a major center of industrial trafﬁc.
A day or so later I mentioned this to a friend of mine
who lives in Pisa. At ﬁrst he was puzzled and then he
burst into laughter. He explained to me that several years
ago the Italians had a series of bad accidents at major
unguarded railroad crossings. They placed guards at al-
most every railroad crossing to prevent this. They neg-
lected, however, to install any sort of automatic signaling
devices to warn the guards of approaching trains. Instead
they simply give them the train schedules, and the guards
stop all vehicles and pedestrian trafﬁc a few minutes be-
fore the train is scheduled to arrive. Since Italian trains
are very often behind schedule, it is not uncommon for
people to wait ten to thirty minutes at a crossing before
the train arrives. If the train is ahead of schedule, one
little accident will put it back behind schedule. Of course
I never connected the fact that our train was twenty-ﬁve
minutes late with the long lines of waiting vehicles, but
it was a good lesson in logic for me.

Our stay in Pisa was short. We found that after a day
of walking, we had seen most of the city, including the

Leaning Tower, St. Mark’s cathedral and several beauti-
ful marble bridges. In direct contrast, we spent the next
two days wandering through the streets and shops of
Florence and felt we had seen only a small part of the
fabulous sights available in this extremely old and beau-
tiful city of art.

From Florence we traveled to Venice, the city of canals,
gondolas, glassware, and tourists by the thousands. We
spent most of one day in Venice just wandering through
the small shops admiring the beautiful delicate hand-
blown glassware. The next day we took a boat to the
island of l\/Iurano and watched the skilled craftsmen form-
ing these beautiful pieces of glass with the same crude
implements that have been used for centuries by glass-
blowers. We were so impressed with the work of these
artisans that we bought two sets of delicate glasses, and
spent the next two weeks guarding them with our lives
against pushing crowds and jolting trains. The bustling,
crowded shops of Venice, however, are not its main attrac-
tion. At night, when the shops are closed and the major-
ity of the tourists are off the streets, the real beauty of
Venice, the canals, the gondolas, and hundreds of multi-
colored lights and reﬂections can be enjoyed. Viewed
from a high vantage point, such as the Rialto Bridge,
these beautiful canals reﬂect, every light in the city. Their
continuous traffic of gondolas and boats of every descrip-
tion, each with its own lights, adds to the sparkling
splendor.

We departed from Venice on a typical hot and humid
Italian summer day. Within a few hours, however, our
train had wound its way high into the Austrian Alps,
and we were dragging out our suitcases for some warm
sweaters and coats. Our only stop in Austria was the lovely
little city of Innsbruck. Here we got our ﬁrst taste of
Bavaria with its beautiful rugged mountains, its cable-
cars and ski lifts, its delightful cool summer climate, its
hearty music and delicious plentiful meals. For the next
two weeks in Austria, southern Germany, and Switzerland
we rode trams and cablecars to the very tops of these

beautiful Alps and gazed down through the blue haze of
clouds at the cities far below us. We swam in ice cold
mountain lakes which were still being fed by melting
snow from the peaks of mountains far above us. We ate
tremendous meals of roasts, schnitzels, potato dumplings,
sauerkraut, and numerous other delicious dishes. We
hoisted out beer steins, sang, and danced with a wonder-
ful German crowd in the boisterous Hoffbrauhaus. These
are but a few of the many pleasant memories we brought
back from this beautiful section of Europe.

We had truly saved the best part of Europe for the end
of our journey, for from here we returned directly to
Amsterdam for our return ﬂight home. Although our ﬂight
home was long, we had many experiences to exchange
with fellow students, and many pleasant memories to re-
collect that will never be put into words but appear only
as a smile when we are reminded of some warm experi-
ence from this truly wonderful summer.

George called his home to talk to
his wife. The phone rang and rang—
and ﬁnally the little woman answered
it. “Oh, dear,” she moaned, “you got
me out of the tub. Please call back in
20‘ minutes. I’m dripping wet, and ‘I
didn't even have a chance to grab a
towel, trying to get to the phone.”

George said okay, and hung up.
Then he redialed his phone number,
hurriedly whispering instructions to
one of his pals in the office.

The pal took the phone. Again the
wife—who couldn’t have had time to
get back to the tub—answered with
a rather annoyed, “Yes?”

The pal said, “Is George ho— . . .
oh, look at you! and all wet, too!”

A loud scream at the other end of
the line was cut off by an equally
loud click.

“Darling, I have a confession to

their ﬁrst breakfast. “It isn’t a big

you before that I suffer from asthma.”

“Thanks heavens,” said the groom.
“Last night I thought you were hiss-
ing me.”

After eight daughters, the lucky
couple was ﬁnally blessed with a boy.
The happy father went out and cele-
brated for two weeks. Finally some-
one asked him, “Does the baby look
like you or your wife?”

“I don’t know,” answered the still
joyous papa. “We haven’t looked at

his face yet.”

A farmer wanted to increase the

size of his livestock. So, he placed his
sow in a truck and drove over to his
neighbor’s farm where he placed her
in the pen with a boar. Returning
her to her own pen, he waited the
prescribed time. When no new addi-
tions appeared, he placed her in the
truck again and repeated the proce-
dure. After several more tries, the
farmer one day asked his wife if she
had noticed any of the signs they were
looking for. “No,” she replied, “but
she's climbed into the truck again.”

The l0ng—winded lecturer had been
holding forth for over an hour, except
for brief pauses from time to time to

during one such intermission, an old

Both beakers contain the same quantity
of applesauce. The picture should inter-
est the millions who face the problem
of avoiding more calories than their
doctors say are good for them while
enjoying the delight of good eating.

The one on the right contains only
two additional ingredients: 1% of a cer-
tain type of monoglyceride fat we distill
for the food industry and 1000% of air.
Both added ingredients are harmless as
applesauce itself.

One adds the monoglyceride, warms,
and whips. If the result is a bit too airy
for the common taste, one can either
use more strongly ﬂavored applesauce,
freeze while mixing (as in making ice
cream), or both.

It doesn’t have to be applesauce. We
have made the idea workjust as well
with bananas, tomato juice, etc.

Mind you, expect no applesauce from
us. We offer no foods in family-sized
quantities. We work closely, however,
with companies that do.

ADVANCED PAPER-MAKING

(random notes)

THIS paper

“My husband sells oscillograph paper.
Competition is fierce. He comes home
beat every night.”

Few overhearing her would know
what the poor soul is talking about, yet
she speaks the truth. Oscillographs
probably outnumber pickle barrels in
this country at present. Oscillographers
are correspondingly numerous. Methods
that one sect of oscillographers prefers
above all else another sect can’t see for
dirt. One sect prefers automatic oscillo-
gram processors. Paper manufacturers
like us ﬁnd their favor worth competing
for. Therefore we announce a new
advance in media for their use.

An advance in the old art of paper-
making came first. Then new emulsions
were devised to work properly with the
new base. Then proper processing
chemicals were devised for the new
emulsions. Then the combination was
extensively proved out under practical
conditions of use by parties interested
only in end-results and hardly at all in
the how and why.

They found that THIS paper dries
thoroughly at high processor speeds
without creases, doesn’t crack or dis-
tort, isn’t fussy about how long it sits
around before use, and gives trace lines
that stand out black as the ace of spades.

“THIS” won’t do for a trademark.
We call it Kodak Ektaline Paper. Kodak
Ektaline Chemicals come as liquids.
The stabilization principle used in the
automatic oscillogram processors came
from Kodak, too.

Smart hardware

Alarm prevails over the nation’s bill for
research unwittingly repeated. We have
an answer. Even the hardware is all
built. It uses little chips of ﬁlm 16mm
by 32mm, which are never touched by
human hands.

Each of the millions of chips carries
both a) language the machines can use
in classifying information to almost any
depth of detail and b) microreproduc-
tion of documents, photographs, manu-
scripts, drawings, or whatever for the
human user to examine with his natural-
born eyes as soon as the machine has
“remembered” it and restored it to size.

The machines search very fast. They
further save searching time because of
the incredible information-packing den-
sity and copying speed of photography.
It is practical for the machinery to
duplicate each complete chip for every
pertinent sub-classiﬁcation. The sub-
classiﬁcations can therefore be made so
ﬁne that each contains relatively few
chips for the machinery to zip through.

This is called the Minicard System.
It can occupy legions upon legions of
creative minds with very sharply rele-
vant information from the whole recorded
past while the stroke of genius is
patiently awaited.

Note = Whether you work for us or not,
photography in some form will prob-
ably have a part in your work as years
go on. Now or later, feel free to ask for
Kodak literature or help on anything
photographic.

Interview with General EIeetric’s Dr. J. H. Hollomon
Manager—GeneraI Engineering Laboratory

Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?

A. There are four signiﬁcant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.

1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
andadequate water resources.

2. The shift in our economy from agri-
culture and manufacturing to “serv-
ices”: today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,
and recreation are new needs. They
require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.

3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.

4«. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the “haves” of our society must
provide the industry and’ the tools for the
“have-nots” of the new countries if they
are to share the. advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
capable of furnishing the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.

We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric’s future growth
and contribution.

Q. Could you give us some examples?

A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for

One of a series . . .

Society Has New Needs
and Wants.-Plan Your
Career Ac.c3:ordingIy

DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric’s centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adjunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Dr. Hollomon’s opinions.

example, new methods of purifying
salt water and speciﬁc techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa, South America, and
Southern Asia.

We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve
their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-
ing and retrieving information, or
handling it in computers. We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing
the cost of medical treatment. We can
design new devices for more efficient
“paper handling” in the service
industries.

Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?

A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men, the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
——how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.

For scientists, look to those new fields
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world
in which we live.

But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored b
the company for which you work. 

Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?

A. General Electric is a large diver-
siﬁed company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

...they collaborated across the centuries
to make life better today

In ancient China they “piped” water through hollow bamboo
sections, but they couldn’t shut it off. One day a workman
with an engineering mind bored a hole in a plug and ﬁtted
it into holes in the pipe. This was the ﬁrst plug valve.

Centuries later, the brilliant young mathematician and
scientist, Blaise Pascal, worked out the principle of hydraulics
for which he is famous: “A unit pressure applied to a liquid
contained in a sealed vessel is transmitted to every part of the
liquid with undiminished force.”

In 1914, Sven Nordstrom, a young mining engineer, had
trouble with sticking, leaking valves on the acid lines at a
silver mine. By combining the plug cock idea of the ancient
Chinese with Pascal’s principle of hydraulics, he created a
new idea in ﬂow control: the lubricated plug valve.

Today, the Rockwell-Nordstrom lubricated plug valve is
widely used in the petroleum and natural gas industries, in
chemical processing, and in general manufacturing. Its effi-
ciency helps cut the cost of many of the things you use every
day. And thanks to hundreds of engineering advances, the
original lubricated plug valve is still the most modern.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like
to work for, buy from, and invest in.

o One in a series of messages
on how to plan your career

make steel?

The answer is mechanical engineers,
chemical engineers, electrical engineers,
mining engineers, industrial engineers,
civil engineers, and, of course, metal-
lurgical engineers. There are others,
too, but our listing covers the ones
most frequently encountered.

It's a common misconception that
college-trained metallurgists dominate
the steel industry. Not so. Every major
engineering degree is represented with-
in the management ranks of a steel
company.

It makes sense. The mining and
processing of minerals obviously sug-
gests the need for Mining Engineers.
Then come the chemical processes of
coke-making, smelting, reﬁning. Fuels
are consumed, valuable by-products
are made. Is it any wonder steelmaking
calls for Chemical Engineers?

And how about the machinery, the
mills, the furnaces, the instrumenta-
tion that make up a modern steel plant?
Mechanical Engineers design them,
and frequently supervise installation.
Civil Engineers design and put up the
buildings to house them, and the feed
lines to keep them supplied.

Power? Steel is the biggest industrial
consumer of electric power. You can-
not conceive of a greater concentration
of electrical equipment than in a
modern steel mill. And many steel
plants generate electric power, too.
Electrical Engineers are busy fellows
in the steel industry.

Steelmaking calls for volume pro-
duction, complex and scientiﬁc, often
highly automated. Steel companies
make numerous ﬁnished products, too,
from nuts and bolts to nuclear-powered
cruisers. The Industrial Engineer ﬁnds

 

 

plenty to do around steel.

What's more, the above comments
fail to make perhaps the most im-
portant point—interchangeability. We
have found that there are endless op-
portunities for men with any one of
the engineering degrees we have men-
tioned to handle jobs entailing great
responsibility. The supervisor of a huge
open-hearth department, or a giant
rolling mill, might well be an M.E., a
Ch. E., a Met. E., an I.E., or C.E.

Sales Engz'neers——Because of the na-
ture of our products, Bethlehem sales-
men are best equipped when they, too,
are engineers. For a man with a tech-
nical background and a "sales person-
ality,” there are splendid opportunities
with Bethlehem Steel.

S/Jz'pbuz'ldz'ng—As the world's largest
privately owned shipbuilding and ship
repair organization, Bethlehem offers
careers to Marine Engineers and Naval
Architects, as well as to engineers in
many other categories.

The Loop C0urse—This program was
established some 40 years ago, to select
and train well-qualiﬁed college gradu-
ates for careers in the Bethlehem or-

ganization. It was so named because of
an observational circuit (or "loop”) of
a steel plant. After a ﬁve weeks’
basic training period, which is held
once a year at company headquarters,
in Bethlehem, Pa., loopers receive
their ﬁrst assignments, which call for
specialized training that may last for
a few weeks or for as long as a year.
Next comes on-the-job training, and
the looper is on his way.

Big and Dz'12erszﬁed—Because of its
size and diversity, Bethlehem Steel
offers unlimited opportunities to “get
ahead.” One of the nation's largest
industrial corporations, with over
140,000 employees, we are engaged in
raw materials mining and processing;
basic steelmaking and the production
of a wide range of steel products;
manufacturing; structural-steel fabri-
cating and erecting; and shipbuilding
and ship repair. A new centralized
research facility, the Bethlehem Steel
Company-Homer Research Laborator-
ies, costing in excess of $25 million,
located in Bethlehem, Pa., rivals the
ﬁnest in any industry.

Read our Boo,élet—The eligibility re-
quirements for the Loop Course, as
well as a description of the way it
operates, are more fully covered in our
booklet, “Careers with Bethlehem Steel
and the Loop Course.” It will answer
most of your questions. Copies are
available in most college placement
offices, or may be obtained by writing
to Manager of Personnel, Bethlehem
Steel Company, Bethlehem, Pa.
