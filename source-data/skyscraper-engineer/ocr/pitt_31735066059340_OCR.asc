8 THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Have you ever wondered where most of the en-
gineering students go after graduation? Last June
157 engineering students were graduated from the
University of Pittsburgh. They, along with thousands
of other engineering graduates from colleges and uni-
versities in the United States will finally do every-
thing from teaching school to sitting leisurely behind
a desk as the president of a large firm. Actually, as
shown by statistics published by the Engineer's Coun-
cil for Professional Development, about 30% of all
engineers work in administrative and supervisory posi-
tions where they direct the work of other people.
About 40% of all the industrial executives today are
engineers. These engineers are not only concerned
with technical problems, but must also handle per-
sonnel problems and make business decisions.

About 20% of all engineers are engaged in plan-
ning and design. M/ith his technical knowledge, the
engineer draws up the plans and specifications for new
machines or systems. While making the plans, the
engineer must keep a careful watch on the costs of
building and of operating and maintaining the new
machine or system. This new machine or system must
be an economical investment for whoever is going
to use it.

Closely related to the engineers working in plan-
ning and design are those l8% working in research
and development. These men discover and develop
new ideas before they reach the designing stage.

After a structure, machine or system is designed,
construction or installation engineers take the plans
and specifications and turn them into reality. About

JANUARY. I956

Editorial

7% of all engineers are engaged in this activity. They
are responsible for the purchase of materials and the
organization of construction or installation crews.

Another 7% of all engineers work in production
and operations. These men organize operating crews
and materials for running their particular factory,
power station or communications system. They are
continuously looking for ways of reducing costs and
improving their service or product.

With all of our new inventions and develop-
ments of products and machines , engineers are need-
ed to sell these to the customers, who are, many times,
engineers themselves. Not only must these engineers
understand what the customer needs and be able to
make recommendations, l)ut he must also know how
to get along with all sorts of people to sell his product.
About 4% of all engineers work as salesmen, while
over 5°/, work as consulting engineers, who sell their
services and experiences instead of products.

Less than 3% of engineers work as teachers, and
many of these are engaged in research or consulting
activities in addition to their teaching.

It is also interesting to note that a number of
engineering graduates from the University of Pitts-
burg continue their education in law or medical
school.

The above statements show the possibilities in
the profession. The engineering student has a wide
choice. Today it is possible for every student to pro-
vide his own answer to the question, “What shall I
do after graduation?"

ALUMIN UM INDUSTRY
WAS BORN ON
SMALLMAN V In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company-

located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of
 Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.

The men of this company had real engineering abilities and
viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers . . .

leaders . . . men of vision.

A lot has happened since 1888. The country . . . the
company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new
territories have become states, for one thing. The total
industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people-
and the little outﬁt on Smallman Street? Well, it’s a lot
bigger, too——and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
ALUMINUM COMPANY or AMERICA . . . but it’s still the
leader—still the place for engineering “firsts”.

As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a
dynamic company like Alcoa—for real job stability
and pleasant working conditions—where good

men move up fast through their association with

the recognized leaders in the aluminum industry.

AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING DESIGN

are indeed is the airport terminal building, built
Rbefore World War II, which is now adequately

serving its community’s needs for todays air transpor-
tation. Unfortunately many terminals built immedi-
ately after the war, like their predecessors, failed to
function in the best interest of the traveler, the owner,
the airlines and the concessionaire — the needs of
all we will discuss later. By no means does it suggest
neglect on the part of the architects and the engineers
who designed these terminal buildings. Each was do-
ing his best to provide suitable facilities for the air
transportation of that day. Unfortunately the industry
was not sufficiently stabilized to set up a criteria for
the design of terminal buildings. Most of us have
observed the chaotic past of airport terminal design
and a community witnessing the antiquation of a pub-
lic facility in less than a decade has a bitter pill to
swallow.

In the early part of 1950 the Civil Aeronautics
Administration’s Office of Airports, set about devel-
opment of criteria for the layout and design of air-
port terminal buildings. They conducted an intensive
study of the space requirements of consistent occu-
pants of airport terminal buildings. At the same time
they were studying passenger, visitor and peak hour
relationships developed from time and motion counts
at a representative group of airports throughout the
United States. Evaluation of data and information
submitted by airlines, concessionaires and airport man-
agement indicated that each had special interests and
that each often tended to be intolerant of the needs
and requirements of the others. Thus they were faced
with the problem of who should get the “break” in
space allocation and location. The problem is still
unanswered, but it resolves itself to this: An airport
terminal building is primarily the service center for
the transfer of passengers and their property between
surface vehicles and aircraft. Therefore, it was their
contention that the number one consideration should
be to help make the passengers transition as easy as
possible. Secondly, the break should go to the air-
line on whom the passenger is dependent for quick
processing through the terminal. Next in line is the
concessionaire who foots many of the bills for the
operation of the terminal and provides essential ser-
vices for the traveler and visitor. Lastly, they con-
sidered accommodating the visitors who often exceed
the passengers in number. You will notice, that the
break due the airport owner has not been mentioned.
Naturally an architect or engineer owes his first al-
legiance to his client. So in developing the scheme for
a terminal building, it is probably the owner who gets
the number one break on the design of the facility.
It is his lot to operate the buildings to the satisfaction
of all and if possible, at a profit. This he will do
provided the users of the building get their breaks as

JANUARY. 1956

by V. W. Pretka

they should.

At practically every major airport the dollar in-
vestment in building construction, that is all build-
ings -on the airport, will exceed the investment in the
construction of the landing facilities. This is a point
which serves to emphasize the importance of care-
fully considering all the factors of building area site
selection and layout to achieve a solution of maxi-
mum utility. Failure to take these factors into ac-
count in the initial planning of an airport or any of
its facilities, leads to future financial pitfalls resulting
from cramped and poorly planned building areas.
The operational aspects of a building area poorly
planned often result in dollar penalties that are econ-
omically unbearable to the airport owner and the
user alike. Safe and direct circulation for pedestrians,
vehicles and aircraft is the keynote of building area

PRIOR TO FINAL DESIGN. AT HUGHES.
SYSTEMS FOR INTERCEPTORS ARE FIRST
TESTED IN “FLYING LABORATORIES" IN
WHICH l'HE EQUIPMENT IS READILY
ACCESSIBLE TO SYSTEMS TEST ENGINEERS

One interesting problem recently confront-
ing Hughes engineers was that of evaluating
the requirements imposed upon the pilot of
a high-speed one-man interceptor. This arose
in the development of a new integrated elec-
tronic system to control several phases of an
alI—wcather interceptor’s ﬂight. Because of
the great importance of providing the pilot
with the optimum design and arrangement
of displays and controls, it became necessary
to determine accurately the pilot’s work load
during ﬂight, and the human factors that
affect his ability to carry out his task.

The solution was to install a complete
mock—up of the actual interceptor cockpit in
a large T-29 aircraft in which a breadboard
model of the system was being tested. From
this cockpit a test pilot can simultaneously
operate the electronic system and ﬂy the
T-29, performing all the functions of an in-
terceptor pilot. Systems test engineers and
psychologists analyze his problems and his
performance, and adapt the cockpit design
to the natural abilities of the human pilot.
The result will be a much better “fit” of pilot
and electronic system prior to ﬁnal ﬂight
testing in the tactical interceptor.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Engineering is a separate branch of science it is
DYNAMICS. The very word explains the impact

of engineering upon civilization.

It has been erroneously thought for many years
that the engineer is an applied scientist whose educa-
tion has consisted of a combination of vocational train-
ing and the elementary physical sciences such as chem-
istry, mathematics, and physics.

A thorough analysis of the situation reveals in-
stead, that the engineer takes no vocational courses.
He is educated not only in the elementary sciences
but often there are more engineers than physical sci-
ence students in the advanced physical science courses.

Elementary science is only the beginning of the
engineer's training. He is next required to take cours-
es in the Engineering Sciences. Here he is introduced
to the Science of Dynamics or Engineering.

The difference between the branches of the phy-
sical sciences and the Science of Dynamics or Engin-
eering might best be described by example.

Pure science establishes the laws of nature. These
establish the limitations beyond which man cannot
penetrate. The engineer often merely applies these
laws in order to develop a new product for mankind.
This is the popular conception of his function. More
often, however, he applies his principles of Dynamics
to work around or within the laws.

A “pure” chemist, for example, might spend his
efforts in determining the equilibrium constant for
a chemical reaction. Equilibrium is a statics state and
does not interest the chemical engineer except to
know where it is. The chemical engineer will then
take the same reaction recording just the conditions.
He will start from non-equilibrium conditions and
permit the reaction to approach equilibrium often
with explosive violence, but meanwhile a useful pro-
duct is made from the reaction.

The civil engineer is greatly interested in the law

JANUARY. I956

of Physics known as statics so as to design a bridge.
However, he must determine the dynamic forces oper-
ating on the bridge such as wind, water and traffic
before he can specify the design of a structurally safe
bridge.

The mechanical engineer designs moving parts
of automobiles and airplanes. These parts have en-
tirely different designs than would be used if the
auto and plane were never in motion. However, the
niechancial engineer must know the Dynamics of im-
pact, fatigue, and vibration. in order to properly de-
sign these parts.

The physical chemist or physicist might perform
an excellent investigation and establish the equili-
brium or phase diagram between two alloying metals.
The metallurgical engineer then knows the limita-
tions established by equilibrium and proceeds by dy-
namic means (heat treatment) to throw the alloy off
equilibrium and thus make a useful product. Gener-
ally speaking, alloys which have been permitted to
approach equilibrium are so-ft and ductile, but by
dynamic (non-equilibrium) treatment the alloy can
be made hard or tough.

There are hundreds of examples for each branch
of engineering. Wherever one finds an engineer,
there is action or movement.

Fluid Flow, Heat Transfer, Electrical" Circuits,
Heat-treatment, Metallography, Fuels, Combustion,
Thermo-dynamics, Nuclear Energy, Soil Mechanics,
Material Handling and many others are Engineering
Sciences.

They are all Sciences of Dynamics.

This may explain why the “pure” physical sci-
ences and the engineering sciences operate best as a
team. The engineer uses the limitations established
by the pure scientist, applies his own principles of
Dynamics and something useful results. One thing is
certain; something moves.

ESSO ENGINEERS DESIGN OIL REF INERIES

by E. D. Hooper '5] and W. H. llupp '50

A recent stock holder’s meeting of the Standard Oil
Company (New Jersey) held in refinery shops at

Linden, N.]., aroused a great deal of interest in oil
refinery design. An exhibit laid out in a redecorated
blacksmith shop carried out the theme “Leadership
Through Research”. One phase of the exhibit dealt
with creating, planning, and building the oil refin-
ery of the company based on experimental data.

In the belief that people interested in engineer-
ing might like to know how one company organizes
and executes design wo-rk, this article was written.
The engineers discussed here are a part of the Esso
Research and Engineering Company technical affil-

iate of the “Jersey Company”

Oz‘/zer People

In the forefront of the work of Esso Engineers
are dealings with people from many walks of life
both within and without the company. Figure 1
showing cooperative efforts with other people might
better illustrate this point.

Since Jersey operates on the committee system,
the results obtained represent the collective effort of
many individuals beamed to a common goal. In com-
mon with present industrial trends, an engineer no
longer can curl up in a corner and work by himself.
We deal with all sorts of people ranging from engi-

standing graduating engineer and chemical engineer. After
graduating with high hon.ors in 7957, he was employed by
Standard Oil at Linden, New Jersey.

His activities at ESS-O have included plant tests in crude
oil desalting, thermal and catalytic cracking and air pollution
abatement. Mr. Hooper has also worked on the adaptation
of an electronic computer for the solution of engineering
problems.

WALTER H. RUPP

Walter H. Rupp graduated
from the University of Pitts-
burgh in 7930 with high hon-
ors in chemical engineering.
‘He was President of the hon-
orary engineering fraternity,
Apha, Omicron, and a charter
member of Sigma Tau.

~' He was affiliated with the
Jersey Company from 1930 to 7936. He was then transferred
to ESSO Research and Engineering Company, where he con-
tinued refinery process planning until the end of World
War ll. Mr. Rupp was the Supervising En-gineer o-f the Engi-
neering Research Divis-ion for five years and since 7947 has
been interviewing engineering graduates for employment with
Jersey. He recently became Technical Advisor to the Director
of the Economics Division. Mr. Rupp holds about 30 U.S. pat-
ents on various oil refining practices and is the co-author of an
air pollution control handbook soon to be published. He

from nationally known businessmen to specialists in
algae growth control. Each person both teaches and
learns if he is completely successful.

Travel

The operations of the Jersey -Co-mpany are world
wide. As the accompanying Figure 2 shows, 45 refin-
eries manufacture oil products familiar to people on
every continent.

Sixteen percent of the world's crude oil is re-
fined by Jersey. Esso Engineers have been assigned
the responsibility of getting “more refining capacity
and quality for less money”. In special cases, consult-
ing studies covering crude oil production, pipeline,
shipping, marketing and manpower problems, are
undertaken also.

A timely example of a recent end-result is the
Fawley Refinery in England. When the following
article was written, Fawley was the biggest, newest,
most complete refinery ever built at one time. Today
it refines 25% of England's petroleum. TIME Maga-
zine — March 22, 1954 issue —— had this to say:

Edward J. Stolic, class of ’48

speaks from experience when he says . . .

“With U. S. Steel, my futureholds interest,
challenge and reward.”

From his graduation in 1948 with a
B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineer-
ing, until November of that year,
Edward Stolic worked as an operat-
ing trainee in the Irvin Works of
United States Steel. Following his
discharge from the Army in 1950,
he returned to work at U.S. Steel. In
just 18 months, Mr. Stolic reached a
management position as Engineer-
Lubrication.

By mid-year 1953, Mr. Stolic was
promoted to Foreman-Instrument
Repair and Sub-Station. In a recent
interview he said: “Opportunities
for rapid advancement are almost
limitless in U.S. Steel.” At 27, Mr.
Stolic is supervising a force of 30
men in mechanical and electrical
tests as well as instrument repair and
maintenance of gas generators, com-

pressors and water puriﬁcation units.
He feels that, “The engineer ﬁnds
many places to apply the knowledge
he garnered in school.” The men un-
der Edward Stolic are called on to
trouble shoot in any part of the mill.
This calls for a wide variety of tal-
ents and leads Mr. Stolic to say:
“The steel industry has expanded
greatly, and with it the need for good

Boeing engineers are insiders on top-secret work

Engineers are doing vital work on sig-
niﬁcant new developments at Boeing.
For example, the Boeing BOl\/IARC
Il\/I-99 pilotless interceptor. Its prede-
cessor, the Boeing GAPA, is shown here,
because photographs of BOMARC
are highly classiﬁed. BOMARC is a
supersonic long-range missile that
spearheads an entirely new weapons
system. It is a key weapon in America’s
defense planning.

BOMARC, as well as other “years

goal is to design structures and com-
ponents that will “weigh nothing and
take no space,” yet withstand extreme
velocities and altitudes.

The prestige of Boeing engineers is
second to none. They have created such
recent aviation milestones as the B-52
global jet bomber, the 707 jet transport,
and the B-47. There are superb facili-
ties at Boeing: the multi-million-dollar
new Flight Test Center, the world's
most versatile privately-owned wind
tunnel, the latest electronic computers,
and much more.

Boeing engineers enjoy exceptional
opportunities for career stability and

growth. There are more than twice as
many engineers with the ﬁrm now as
at the peak of World War II. Living
is pleasant in the progressive, comfort-
able-size communities of Seattle and
VVichita.

There is room for top engineering
talent on Boeing research, design and
production teams. If you feel that you
belong with aviation’s leader, it will pay

2'2 THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

With this issue, the SKYSCRAPER revives “The
Faculty Speaks.”
Blaine Leidy presents a thorough discussion of a con-

troversial topic.

SHOULD WE ADOPT A 5-YEAR PROGRAM
OR REORGANIZE THE 4-YEAR CURRICULUM?

Contrary to the idealistic dream of the young high
school graduate just entering the engineering
field, completion of the standard undergraduate cur-
riculum of even the best engineering school will not
automatically make make him an engineer. In fact,
it will merely bring to a close the “basic training” of
his career. “Advanced training” at the graduate level,
if properly channeled will bring him closer to the
goal; but his. complete development as an engineer
will require a lifetime of practice.

In our efforts to keep the undergraduate cur-
riculum in step with current demands, we are con-
stantly faced with several fundamental problems, not
the least of which is the problem of time restriction.
We have only two possible solutions of this time
problem. We can either increase the program to a
5-year period or replace parts of the present curric-
ulum to make room for proposed new courses. I/Ve
cannot avoid the issue. We must compile the facts
for and against each proposal and analyze and in-
terpret them before reaching a satisfactory decision.

0éj'ecz‘z"ve.r oftbe U726/ergmc/zzczte

Program _

The first step in solving the problem is a new
evaluation of the objectives of the undergraduate pro-
gram. The over-all objective should be to give the
student the best possible preparation for his chosen
engineering field.

To analyze this broad objective, we must break
it down into subdivisions of a more tangible nature.
This can be done by answering such questions as:

(1) Where should we draw the line between
undergraduate and graduate programs? Should we
leave all specialization to the graduate school and
industry? Should we attempt to keep abreast of cur-
rent industrial practices?

(2) What social-humanistic studies should we
include, and to what extent should we expect the
student to participate in such a liberalized program?
Are engineers too one—sided?

(3) Are we teaching courses which were at one
time very practical, but which should now be re-
placed by more progressive fundamental courses?

(4) Should we steer the engineering approach
to problems away from the “factor of safety” tech-
nique and toward a more exact mathematical and
scientific procedure?

The answer to these questions vary from school
to school (even our top educators do not agree), but
the prevailing opinions seem to be these:

(1) We should leave the major emphasis on
specialization and current practices to the graduate

school and industry, including as required courses
in the undergraduate program only the very mini-
mum of special applications necessary to aid the
the student in determining his preferences. The stu-
dent should receive encouragement and guidance,
however, toward selection of optional courses in spe-
cialized fields if he so desires.

(2) We should include all social-humanistic
studies necessary to train the future engineer to take
an active and intelligent part in protecting his own
interests and in co-operating with experts in solving
our social, political and economic problems.

(3) In general, we do have some dead -wood
courses in our undergraduate programs which might
profitably be replaced by more progressive courses.
\Vith the advent of the atomic age and all the radical
changes that it is sure to bring, our training pro-
grams must advance along with it.

(4) We should develop a more exact mathe-
matical and scientific approach to engineering prob-
lems, at the same time avoiding the illusion that
every practical problem will have only one correct sol-
ution. Unfortunately, many problems in standard
textbooks tend to give clearly defined data to the
extent that the student needs only to substitute values
in ready-made formulas.This precludes the need for
independent analysis by the student and leads to a
lack of emphasis on the hard fact that real engineer-
ing practice often requires compromises between exact
mathematical solutions and those not so exact. The
problem at hand after the above objectives have been
clearly defined reduces to deciding which of the two

proposals, reorganization of the 4-year program or ac-
ceptance of a 5-year plan, will best fulfill these ob-
iectives.

T/ze Five Year Plan

The 5-year plan already exists in several schools.
Some of these new programs consists of cooperative
agreements between the College and the School of
Engineering. Others are more correctly classified as
either extensions of the pure engineering curriculum
or as cooperative agreenments with industry. In all
cases, the actual form has been influenced mainly by
the objectives of the individual school concerned.

The primary objective of the combined college
and engineering curricula is to augment the engineer-
ing education with more of the liberal arts than has
previously been possible. The plan was, of course,
developed by those educators who felt that over spe-
cialization in the engineering program has limited
the student’s interests to too small a sphere of human
endeavor. They maintain that he will always be an
individual first of all, and secondarily an engineer;
therefore, his interests cannot be separated from the
interests of other groups.

The University of Pittsburgh has adopted an
optional plan of this type leading to a Bachelor of
Science degree from the School of Engineering at the
end of the fifth year. The student spends his first
three years in the college and the last two in the engi-
neering field of his choice. The plan allows at best for
slight extension of the pure engineering curriculum.
Its merits lie in the two-degree reward and in the
broadened education of the engineering student in
other fields’.

Many schools have introduced an extended en-
gineering curriculum. The goal of this approach is
the addition of engineerng courses which are forced
out of the standard curricula by “more important”
technical subjects. Proponents of the plan cite the
longer periods of preparation spent in such profes-
sional schools as Medicine and Law as the eventual
status of the engineering school if engineering is to
maintain its professional stature.

Educators backing this plan believe that a fifth
year is desirable to provide a transition from non-
specialized course work to the specialized work of in-
dustry.

The Institute of Technology, University of Min-
nesota, provides a modified plan of this type, which
not only extends the engineering curriculum but also
gives considerable emphasis on specialized work, in-
cluding a total of thirteen credits in engineering spec-
ialites, such as heat, power or management, a mini-
mum of six in engineering design, six in advanced
technical communications, and a one-credit course
in professional problems.

Another five year plan, the cooperative work-
study program, provides both theoretical and practical
training in engineering work by interspersing the
classroom work with regular periods of industrial em-
ployment. Awarding of the degree at the end of the
fifth year requires satisfactory completion or regular
university work in addition to a specified amount

of supervised work in industry. This plan is the most .

difficult of the three to establish because it requires

24

close cooperation between the university and industry
in determining a program satisfactory to both.

The Technological Institute, Northwestern Uni-
versity, is one of the schools following the work-study
plan. The Various engineering curricula cover a 5-
year period and provide approximately eighteen
months of practical work experience under the sup-
ervision of the Institute. The freshman year and
two quarters of the sophomore year are spent entire-
ly in school. The students then begin a program of
quarterly alteration between industry and college.

A Department of Industrial Relations in respon-
sible for administering the cooperative program. *By
establishing relation between the University and In-
dustry, it secures agreements not only with companies
in the Chicago area but also with industries in a
student’s home town or elsewhere. Employers are
periodically asked to rate the students, and periodic
personal calls by faculty members are made to discuss
the student’s abilities, attitudes, and progress on the
job. In general, students are paid on the same scale
as regular employees doing the same type of work,
and most students in the upper three years are self-
supporting.

Dzsadvaﬁtages oft/2e Five Year Plan

The chief advantage, from the educator’s point
of view, of either of the first two plans mentioned is
the additional time available for classroom work, the
two plans merely placing different emphasis on the
added year. Unfortunately, this extra year has very
definite disadvantages from the student’s point of
view.

‘ The first of these is the increased cost of acquir-
ing the basic engineering education. It is a well
known fact this scholastic ability and capacity are
not restricted to those able to pay the monetary price.
The student who must dependlon part-time jobs for
subsistence will need an added measure of will power
to venture on a 5-year course and a greater ‘amount
of stamina to complete it.

An objective of perhaps equal significance re-
sults from the natural impatience of the young stu-
dent to terminate an already lengthy period of formal
education. Unless he has an even stronger incentive
toward becoming an engineer than has been neces-
sary in the past, he may forsake his goal for one more
quickly obtained.

The combined engineering and industrial ex-
pericnce program also has its deficiencies. Although
the problem of financing the edcuation and of bore-
dom in the classroom may be lessened by this plan,
a conflict may arise in the student’s mind because of
differences in classroom and industrial methods un-
less the plan is very carefully organized. Although
it is true that this conflict must ultimately be faced
when the student enters full-time industrial employ-
ment, it is then somewhat reduced because the in-
dustrial method may be accepted without a continual
conflict existing.

C0716/zmm

In my‘ own opinion the conclusions on the ques-
tion are: ‘

(1) The‘ 4-year undergraduate program, can con-
tinue to prove quite satisfactory for some time if we
eliminate obsolete courses in favor of progressive new
courses and restrict the curriculum to engineering
fundamentals and necessary basic humanistic-social

PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS OF

by Elwyn I. Unger E. E.

The cathode—ray tube is one of the essential units in
television, radar, oscilloscopes and other types of

testing devices. Together with the proper equipment,
the cathode-ray tube can be used to produce an exact
trace of voltages and impulses. Television would be
very impractical without the use of such a tube.

When a tube is exhausted, the character of the
discharge changes completely. The glow which would
normally be present nearly disappears from the gas
in the tube, and certain invisible radiations called
cathode-rays begin to be emitted by the cathode.
These rays manifest themselves in three ways: first,
by the brilliant fluorescent effects which they project
in the glass walls of the tube, or in other substances
within the tube upon which they fall; second, by
powerful heating effects; and third, by the sharp
shadows which they cast. The nature of cathode-rays
was a subject of much dispute between the years 1875
and 1898. The most remarkable result of the experi-
ments upon cathode-rays in the conclusion that the
rapidly moving particles o-f which they consist are
not ordiniary atoms or molecules, but are bodies
whose mass is only about one/two thousandth the
mass of the lightest atom known, namely the atom
hydrogen. The velocity with which these particles

project sometimes reaches 60,000 miles per second,
one third the velocity of light.

I/Villiam Crooks believed cathode-rays to be an
ultra gaseous state of matter, but since then, it has
been found that they are really electrons. The first
important discovery concerning the nature of cathode-
rays was that they travel in straight lines. In the rel-
atively free space of a highly evacuated tube, the
cathode particles, torn- loose from the atoms of the
cathode, stream down the length of the tube, seldom
colliding with a gas molecule until they hit the glass
walls. When the rays strike the walls of the tube, the
glass floresces green. A tube of special design was used
in 1780 to demonstrate that cathode-rays have momen-
tum and energy. Leaving" the cathode and requiring
a high speed on their way toward the anode, the rays
strike the mica vanes of a small pinwheel and exert
a force causing it to turn and thus roll along a track
toward the anode. When it reaches the end of the
track, a reversal of the potential, making a right
hand electrode the cathode, will send it rolling back
toward the anode, which is now at the left. From
this experiment Crooks concluded that cathode parti-
cles have monetum.

That cathode-rays are negatively charged par-
ticles was first discovered in Paris in 1895 by Jean
Perrin. A beam of cathode-rays was narrowed down
to a thin pencil or ribbon of rays by a narrow split
near the cathode. The path of the rays is made visible
by allowing the rays to strike a long strip of metal
painted with zinc sulphide, a fluorescent paint. By
placing a horseshoe magnet over the outside of the
tube, the cathode-rays are bent down. If the polarity
of the magnet is reversed, the rays are bent in an up-
ward direction.

William Crooks, the first to study the electrical
dicharge in tubes to a high degree of exhaustion,
found that as more and more of the molecules of air
were removed the speed of the electrons increased,
while the glow gradually disappeared. As a result,
many beautiful experiments were performed with
cathode-rays, such as, deflecting the path of the elec-
tron beam in such a manner that patterns and shapes

CATHODE RAY TUBES

were produced.

The modern cathode-ray tube is a tube which
makes use of the principles of the cathode-rays. This
tube is device for generating an electron beam dir-
ecting the course of the beam by means of an elec-
trostatic or a magnetic field. The grid is negatively
charged and therefore repels any electrons that at-
tempt to escape from the central beam. The anodes
are positively charged and therefore attract the elec-
trons and accelerate their movement. The attraction
is greatest in the Outer part of the beam so that the
outer electrons tend to travel faster than those in the
center. The effect is the focusing of the beam of
electrons, much as a convex lens focuses a beam of
light.

The cathode-ray tube has eliminated the mechan-
ical scanning discs that were once used in the tele-
vision system. The television signals are applied to
the electrodes on the tube in the proper manner so
as to cause the correct movement and variation in
the brilliance of the spot of light which traces out
the images to be received. The size of the image is
limited by the actual dimensions of the luminous
surface in the tube, although the image may be mag-
nified. Another obstacle to be overcome is the fact
that present forms of the cathode-ray tubes require
rather high plate voltage to produce satisfactory oper-
ation. The general form of a cathode-ray tube used
for oscillographs and in the cathode-ray television
system, contains three essential parts; a thin stream
or pencil of electrons traveling at a high velocity, a
fluorescent target, and some mechanism for deflect-
ing the path of the electron stream in any direction.
The unit consists of an elongated glass tube with a
flat end from which all the air has been pumped. At
one end is a heated filament, or cathode, of coated
tungsten which emits a liberal stream of electrons.
Near this cathode is a metal plate which is main-
tained at a positive potential with respect to the
cathode so that it will strongly attract the emitted
electrons toward it at high velocity. In the center of
this plate is a fine hole. Many of these electrons mov-
ing at a very high velocity toward the plate will pass
right through this fine opening and continue on their

JANUARY. 1956

way as a thin pencil of electrons moving at a high
velocity down the entire length of the tube. This may
be compared with a ray of sunshine entering a room
through a small hole in a window shutter.

At the inside of the flattened end of the tube,
is a screen or target of fluorescent material, usually
zinc silicate in the form of the powdered mineral wil-
lemite, sometimes in combination with calcium tung-
state which shines brightly at the point where the
cathode-ray or stream of electrons strikes it.

The stream of electrons can be deflected from its
straight path by either an electrostatic field or a _mag-
netic field. If the former method is to be employed
another pair of electrodes in the form of two plates
is introduced into the neck of the tube so that the
stream of electrons passes through the space between
them. Any voltage or difference of potential applied
between the plates, will make a negatively charged
electron be drawn toward the positive plate during
the passage between the plates.

The cathode-ray tube finds use in television, in
radar sets, and in the electron microscope. It is also
useful in analyzing the wave form of varying currents,
as, for example, the alterating current.‘

In television, the system operates by analyzing
the original scene in a photo—electric camera tube,
amplifying the resulting video signals, transmittilig
these signals along with synchronizing control signals,
and finally utilizing these signals at the receiver to
convert the electric signals back into a picture upon
a cathode-ray tube. At the cathode-ray tube the beam
of electrons strikes fluorescent screen and causes the
material on the screen to give a greater or a lesser
amount of light. In many modern television receivers
the picture which appears as a result of the scanning
of the fluorescent screen is reflected in a mirror on
top of the set.

The illustration shown is a typical example of an
electronstatic—deflected cathode-raye tube. A magnetic
deflected tube is similar to the illustrated tube, ex-
cept that the deflection plates inside the tube are
ommited. Instead, two pairs of coils comprise a de-
flecting yoke, which is p-laced around the neck of the
tube. Usually the cathode-ray tube will have a smaller
diameter, thus yeilding a high deflection sensitively

The electrostatic-deflection type of tube is usu-
ally employed where the actual telev1s1on wave forms

A Campus-to-Career Case History

‘‘I’m working with top names and top talent"

That’s one of Richard P. Abraham’s comments
about his career with Bell Telephone Laboratories
in Murray Hill, N. J. “In 1954, after I’d received
my M.S. from Stanford,” Dick continues, “I was
interviewed by a number of companies. Of these
I liked the Bell Labs interview best—the interviewer
knew what he was talking about, and the Labs
seemed a high-caliber place.

“The Labs have a professional atmosphere, and
I’m really impressed by my working associates.
As for my work, l’ve been on rotating assignments
-—working with transistor networks and their meas-
urement techniques, studying magnetic drum cir-

cuitry, and doing classiﬁed work on Nike. This
experience is tremendous.

“In addition to the job, I attend Lab-conducted
classes on a graduate level several times a week.
Besides that, the Labs are helping me get a Ph.D. at
Columbia by giving me time off to get to late after-
noon classes. That’s the kind of co-operation you
really appreciate from your company.

“What are important to me are the opportuni-
ties offered by the job and the work itself. My wife
and I own a house near Murray Hill, and we’ve
found a lot of friends through the Labs. All in all,
I think I’m in the right kind of place.”

Dick Abraham is typical of the many young men
who are ﬁnding their careers in the Bell System.

Similar career opportunities exist in the Bell
Telephone Companies, Western Electric and
Sandia Corporation. Your placement oﬂ‘icer has

ROOSEVELT DINNER
B R A I N B U S T E R

Testator drew up a will which
stipulated that his fortune should
be distributed among his children
in the following way:

The eldest should get $1,000 and
one third of the remaining estate,
the second should receive $2,000
and again one third of the remaind-
er, and so on down to the youngest
child. At the last no remainder
should be left for the youngest
child, only the outright sum. It is
obvious that he had more than two
children, but just how many is not
revealed. After a number of years,
when his fortune had considerably
increased and, more over, he had
acquired two more children, he
drew up a new will with exactly
the same stipulations. What was
the size of the estate in both cases
and how many children had the

testator? The fortune consisted of '

a full amount of dollars and no
cents.

Rohrer and Geiger were awarded barbed-wire clusters
in recognition of having won the shafts in previous
years. The program took the form of a quiz program.
The honorables, Lopardo, Geiger, Conturo, Darrel,
Rohrer, and of course, Erdlac, were contestants. Some
wonderful prizes were awarded. Professor Lopardo
didn't answer any questions correctly, but he was a-

of Missouri who initiated the cele-
bration in 1903. It, was not until
two years later that the patron saint
of-engineers was recognized when
a enlightened administration (most
likely the result of an apparition)
permitted the celebration. The
Doctrine of “Erin Go Bragh,” uni-
versally translated “St. Patrick was
an engineer,” became from that
date a watchword with engineering
students.

In general, the western schools
celebrate a week of events which
include float parades, laboratory
exhibits, special church services,
open houses, barbecues, and par-
ties. The list could continue indef-
initely.

The big occasion, except perhaps
for the Engineers’ Shamrock Ball
is the arrival of St. Pat, robed in
green and gold sporting a magnifi-
cent flowering beard. His arrival is
unique, unusual, and usually spec-
tular. He has arrived on campuses
by steam shovel, railroad, handcar,
and even by airplane.

Fhe movement of St. Patrick a.
bout the campus is planned by an
honor guard of Knights. These
Knights are obliged to protect the
person of the venerable Saint and
to assist in the preparation, and in-
sure the success of, the Engineers
VVeek.

Knights are selected for their in-
dividual contribution to the Week.
This may involve extensive work

AIR TERMINAL DESIGN

planning, bearing in mind that airports are built
in stages to meet an anticipated aeronautical require-
ment. This suggests a master plan layout depicting the
various stages from the initial through to the ultimate
development. The master plan layout of the entire
airport and particularly the building area must allow
for expansion of any facility in addition to being
inherently flexible to permit accomodation of the
continually changing pattern of airport facilites.

Now to the design of the terminal building itself.
One of the designer’s problems is the development
of a simple and direct circulatory scheme for enplain-
ing and deplaning passengers and their baggage be-
tween the vehicular loading platform on one side
and the aircraft loading positions on the other side
of the building. (See Figure I.) To achieve this
there have been several operational systems devel-
oped. It appears that often in the past the choice
of an operational system, resulted from the designer’s
desire to experiment. While in many cases these ex-
periments proved to be a burden on the traveling
public, they did pave the way for an evaluation of
their good and bad points to permit a more scientific
determination of the proper system to employ. Gen-
erally speaking, the centralized system wherein the
ticketing and baggage facilities of all airlines are
housed in the same building has proved to be the
one affording the greatest number of breaks to all
concerned. The unit or decentralized system wherein
each airline is housed in a separate, or elongated
building and has its own facilities for processing pas-
sengers, baggage, cargo and accomodating visitors,
has generally fallen into disfavor with the industry.

Because of the complexity of circulation within and
about airport terminal buildings and the dangers of
cross-circulation, it is necessary to afford a separation
of these various types of traffic. At airports of rel-
atively low passenger volume, a horizontal diversion
of these opposite types of traffic will usually suffice.
As the volume increases to somewhere in the vincinity
of half million annual enplaning and deplaning pas-
sengers, it becomes necessary to report to a vertical
separation of traffic, hence the two-level system. The
mere cataloging of these operational systems repre-
sents little in the way of new development; however,
determining at what annual passenger volume to con-
sider provision of a two-level scheme re wresents a
stride in the right direction in the development of
terminal building design criteria. 

In conjunction with studying the space ahd lo-
cation requirements of the public airlines and con-
cessionaires a diagram of terminal building space re-
lationships was developed. (See Figure II) Facility
relationships incorporated in the diagram hold wheth-
er the building be a one level or two level system or
whether it be a centralized or a consolidated system.
The diagram makes no attempt to relate the size of
one space with respect to the others. It depicts an

orderly arrangement of facilities permitting an easy .

and direct form of passengers, baggage and visitors
by locating facilities in their proper places for the
function they must perform. The space relationship
diagram was develped because of an early established
premise to avoid standard plans. A situation where
the designer’s hands would be tied is not wanted.
He must be free of the stigma of standards and be
able to retain this freedom to develop an individual-

INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT

OIL...FLUID ENERGY FOR
AN ENERGETIG PEOPLE

Crude oil spouting from the earth is the
fabulous fountain that has put this nation
on wheels and wings. Oil has made mil-
lions of homes and buildings more com-
fortable and, through the “magic” of
petro-chemistry, hundreds of new products
have been created, ranging from fabrics
to formaldehyde.

Modern, advanced reﬁning methods are
producing the most powerful gasolines
ever offered, to fuel America’s 47 million
cars. The airlines’ planes and the rail-
roads’ diesels depend on the same petro-
leum for their tremendous power.

The rocketing importance of oil to so
many major segments of the nation's

economy makes ﬁnding new reserves to
be tapped an unending, expensive job.
And it is to the industry’s credit that it
is reinvesting—year after year—so much
of its own money in exploration, research
and expansion—determined to be ready
to meet a market for petroleum fuels
that is expected to climb to an awesome
$32 billion annually by 1975.

The petroleum industry always has de-
pended on steam for power, heating and
processing. And steam’s versatility was
most recently demonstrated when several
major reﬁneries contracted with B&W to
build special Carbon Monoxide boilers to
convert waste gases into useful power.

B&W, working cooperatively with the oil
companies, is providing efficient, econom-
ical steam throughout the petroleum in-
dustry—as it does throughout all U. S.
industry. The Babcock & Wilcox Com-

ized scheme for a particular site and community. The
number and kind of spaces which should be included
in any terminal building must, of necessity, be deter-
mined on the basis of such factors as present and
forecasted airline traffic, system of terminal building
operation, local conditions of visitors volume, and
restaurant cuisine prevailing in the community. Gen-
erally a new terminal building should be built suf-
ficiently large in the first stage of construction to
accomodate the activities anticipated at the end of
a 10 year period. Space thus provided may not be
fully utilized at the ouset, but this condition is com-

_pensated for by the advantage gained through ac-

comodating traffic increases with no interruptions in

service, and causing frequent and costly additions to
the building. The original construction should be
considered as a stage of the final development, rather
than the final development.

A study of activities at a representative group of
airports revealed the existence of relationships be-
tween the number of annual passengers and the num-
ber of typically—busy or peak-hour passengers and the
number of visitors, concession customers, and occu-
pants of public areas. The observed peak relation-
ships varied with annual passenger volume, but for
locations of like passenger volume, the peak relation-
ships fell within a sufficiently narrow range to permit
use of them for planning purposes. Because of the
existence of these relationships and the development
of methods for forecasting or estimating future pas-
senger volume, the number of typical peak-hour pass-
engers was selected as the basis for area determin-
ationships. To arrive at an estimate of the number
of typical peak—hour passengers at the end of the pro-
jection period to which the building is to be sized,
it is necessary to: (1) Make a forcast of annual pass-
enger volume at the end of the projection period;
and (2) analyze current passenger activity at the air-
port. A survey and analysis of current activity at the
airport when the data are gathered on several typical-
ly busy days, will yield the typical peak-hour passen-
ger volume (average number of passengers enplaning
during the busiest hours.) It is desirable that at least
one weeks traffic, if possible several weeks, be anal-
yzed to obtain typical peak—hour activity. The individ-
ual airlines maintain accurate records of the number
of passengers processed through the airport, thus they

REMOTE CONTROL
TV SYSTEM

For the first time, closed-circuit
TV installations can be remote con-
_trolled, to provide operator safety
in hazardous locations.

Called the “285-A Servo System,”
it includes a inulti-lens TV camera
which is entirely directed by a sep-
arate monitor-console. Lenses on
the camera are changed, focusing is
set, and the camera is directed up
or down, right or left, all by remote
control.

A built-in memory in the control
console also makes it possible to
automatically point the camera in
up to three different “pre-set” dir-
ections simply by pushing a button.
These “pre-set” positions, which
may be readily changed to meet
varying observational tasks, greatly
facilitate repeated viewing of more
than one area or operation.

WRITES HOT NEWS

Temperature-talking typewriters
are one of science’s newest tools in
taming the atom. They have been
adapted to record temperatures of
variousparts of huge reactors used
to produce plutonium for atomic
bombs. A constant check on heat
conditions within the atomic piles
must be kept to insure that pile
structures are not damaged by ex-
cessive temperatures.

To make a temperature chart of

‘a pile, the thermocouples inside

the reactors are automatically con-
nected one by one to the typewriter.
Complex equipment translates each
incoming impulse. into a code sig-
nal, each indentifying a different
centigrade degree. These signals
then trigger typewriter keys so they
print the proper temperature on a
chart of thermocouple locations.

studies. We must not, however, hestitate to accept
the 5-year plan in spite of the difficulties mentioned,
if and when its need is evident. In the meantime
students showing exceptional interest and ability in
certain specialized branches of their chosen field
should be encouraged to continue along these lines
in graduate work.

(2) Of the 5-year undergraduate. plans, the co-
operative work—study plan appears to me to have the
most merit for consideration as a required 5-year pro-
gram. It not only relieves the financial burden of the
engineering education but also bridges the gaps be-
tween theoretical and practical training if it is care-
fully planned.

(3) The other 5-year plans discussed should be
provided as optional courses in those schools having
sufficient demand for them. I do not, however urge
their universal adoption as undergraduate programs
at this time.

Finally, the reader might well extend this in-

as on progressive revisions of the 4-year curricula
before he reaches a personal decision on the issue.

would be able to supply you with data on passenger
activity, the total number of passengers enplaning and
deplaning during the 12 month period preceding the
date of the survey, must be obtained. When the data
has been gathered, an estimate can be made of the
future number of typical peak-hour passengers on
which the size of the facilities should be based. To
aid in making this estimate a graph should be devel-
oped from studies of observed typical peak—hour pas-
senger data, and plotted with reference to corres-
ponding annual passenger volume. (See Figure III.)
Thus the curve represents an average of the number
of passengers accomodated during a typical peak-hour
for annual passenger volumes shown. It is “normal”
to be employed only for the purpose of comparing
a particular airport’s passenger activity with nation-
wide averages of passenger activity. This comparison
can be used as an aid in estimating typical peak-hour
activity for the forecasted annual volume. Once the
target date and number of passengers and visitors to
accomodate has been determined, the sizing of the
various facilities can be reduced to a simple arith-
metical calculation allowing unit areas per passenger,
per visitor, or per customer as the case may be.

As for the future, the growing, quickly changing
aviation industry presents many problems. Jet trans-
ports which are fast approaching the point of daily
schedules, not to mention atomic powered engines,
which appear feasible within the foreseeable future,
will present further problems. The uncertainity of
the unknown or unfamiliar, however, should not in-
fluence us to the point of burying our heads in the
sand, and doing nothing now or at best erecting make-
shift terminal buildings in the form of barn-like
hangers.

In closing I would like to say that in the design

of an Airport Terminal Building, allot the “breaks”

wisely, bearing in mind that economic practicability,
amortization potentialities and functional efficiency
should be the prime considerations in the allocation
of space. Expansibility and flexibility should be the
prime considerations of design and construction of
terminal buildings. .

Engineers generally desire challenging problems
somewhat more practical than their scholastic ones.
Perhaps some recent commercial problems would be
of interest to indicate their scope. Selected at random,
here are a few:

Distill 900-1200017 boiling range without thermal
cracking . . .

Use radioactive tracer to test reactor flow pat-
tern . . .

Estimate results of improved technology on cap-
tital investment costs . . .

Design fluid coke reactor and burner . . .

Develop and carry out program to study brittle
fracture failure in steel plate . . .

Perhaps specifications, analyze bids, recommend
purchase of equipment for modern refining
units . . .

Re-cover sulfur from fluid coke . .

Analyze thermal stresses and design suitable ex-
pansion facilities for fluid hydroformer . . .

Develop plant controller detecting moisture
changes of 1 part per million in gas . . .

Predict financial effects of improved technology
on refiners’ profit margin . . .

Develop theory for rationalizing superior frac-
tionator performance .

Esso Engineers working on these and similar prob-
lems are usually formed into groups of three to six
technical men. Supervisors “know the ropes” because
they have met similar problems just a few years be-
fore. The supervisory staff is selected from company
personnel having a talent for helping other men to
grow in ability. Figure 3 shows a typical group of
engineers discussing a specific, day-to-day problem
together.

There are many ways to “skin a cat” and to carry

out crude oil refining. Alternative processes and com-
bination of processes must be studied to arrive at an
economic optimum. Consideration of processes li-
censed by our company as well as licensed processes
developed by competitive oil companies are evaulated
at an early stage.

The Venezuelan fluid hydroformer now under
construction is a typical example of a new plant re-
quiring many new engineering solutions. When the
engineers shown in Figure 5 study this model, they
think of the many forks in the road where research
(ranging in scale from test tube to semi-commercial
plant) pointed to a sound and economical route to
follow in the final design.

A most important phase of any design is the struc-
tural and layout effort. All new plants using

new processes are care-fully studied by design engi-
neers to insure that past experience is used as the
sound foundation for new ideas.

Erection of the plant itself is usually trusted to
an outside construction company. While this company
is proceeding with its plans, we work in close cooper-
ation with the construction forces in the field. From
the time ground is broken at the plant site, our en-
gineers are on hand to observe the progress of con-
struction and provide liaison between tte plant and
the home office.

Refining plants generally require from 1 to 3
years to design and build. On startup day, a group

of our designers assists the permanently assigned oper-
ators and technical men at the refinery to attain sat-
isfactory performance. Following this, the designers
return to the home office for other assignments.

Even when the plant is meeting design capacity
and product quality, there remains much work to be
done. Often there are few features of the plant which
must be studied. “The new fractionator tray works
fine in a 350 pounds per square inch pressure frac-
tionating tower at 5200 barrels per day feed capacity,
but is it good enough for a new application requiring
tower operation at 10 pounds per square inch pres-
sure and feeding 45,000 barrels per day?” This ques-
tion brings other engineers into the picture. An econ-
omic evaluation is made to establish the breadth of
commercial application and financial rewards envis-
ioned from the new use. An engineering evaluation
and design extrapolates firm data to the conditions
of the new application. A research program is planned
and data obtained from the new commercial-trial in-
stallation in cooperation with refinery and laboratory
personnel. Thus, another milestone is reached to pro-
vide new data for other refinery designs.

Recogmtzorz

Two lines of advancement are open: Supervisory
and Consulting. Our engineers working on similar
problems are usually formed into small groups headed
by a supervisor. Perhaps an engineer prefers to de-
velop along strictly technical lines to- a position of
advisory consultant. Many engineers do. The highly
skilled Esso Engineer can pursue hischosen interests,
publish his results and enjoy recognition and re-
wards comparable to the administrator. Our Engin-
eers a1so.act as consultants on processes licensed to
other oil companies. This gives us the opportunity
to meet and deal with people having different view-
points.

The satisfaction from having his “brain child”
materialize in a completed commercial form is an
exhilaratng feeling to any type of designer, whether
he is designing airplanes or oil refineries. The en-
gineer has ample opportunity for this and other forms
of satisfaction. Through the frequent informal meet-
ings required for coordinating the efforts for other

technical men, our engineers present their ideas to
a wide audience of fellow engineers, chemists, manu-

Fig. 7. Meeting of the technical committee

facturing people and management. Figure 7 shows
a typical company Technical Committee Meeting
with an engineer speaking to such an audience.

Further opportunity is provided by articles and
reports written by the engineer which describe the
progress and results of his major projects. Through
the wide distribution of these reports, the engineer’s
contributions are known throughout the company.
Various books, articles and reports are also written
for the public press by Esso Engineers.

Tbe Organzzatzon

There are about 630 people in the Esso Engineers
group at the present time, including non-technical
employees. Graduate engineers comprise about 350
men from schools widely distributed over the U.S.A.
Company technical people carry out interviews each
year at about 80 colleges and universities. Thus, con-
tact with campus life and thought is preserved.

Accurate records are not available on the number
of Pitt men employed by the parent Standard Oil Co.
(New Jersey.) The figure probably would exceed fifty.
In Esso Engineering, there are about ten Pitt engi-
neering graduates in the various divisions. Most of
‘these men are located at the Linden Office although
several work in a materials inspection and expedit-
ing office in Pittsburgh.

A consideration of design groups was carried out
in 1936 to form what is now Esso Engineering. There
were 180 people assigned to design at that time. De-
mand for our services increased the size to 550 people
in 1950. Expansion will continue in the future.

The home office is located at Linden, New jersey,
about 20 miles form New York City. Most of the Esso
Engineers live in nearby New Jersey towns, within
5-10 miles of the office and within easy driving dis-
tance of seashore and mountain lakes.

A sister organization —— the Esso Laboratories
carries out research and development at Linden, N. J.,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and in England. Laboratory
data, plus data from commercial company plants and
general literature, provide the building blocks for the
Esso Engineers to use in modernizing existing plants
and in creating new refineries.

CATHODE RAY TUBES

Continued from page 29
must be analyzed in detail.

Cathode-ray tubes operate with accelerating volt-
ages of about 1,000 volts for smaller tubes. These tubes
are generally employed for observing patterns of lim-
ited writing length where the patterns are recurrent.
On larger tubes, used for picture reproduction, the
accelerating voltage may be as high as 20,000 volts,
yielding increased brightness and generally better
focus. The electron beam current may vary any-
where from five micro amperes to several hundred
micro amperes, depending upon the type of tube.

The cathode—ray tube screen is a combination of
chemicals blended to produce bluish-white light for
television reception purposes. This blend usually con-
sists of a blue component and a yellow component.

For wave form observation, a willemite screen is
often used. This screen produces green light where
the electron beam strikes it. The luminous efficiency
of the green phosphor accounts for its widespread use
for oscillograph purposes. Where photographic re-
cords are desired, a fluorescent screen producing blue
light is best.

The following illustration will give a better ex-
planation of the proceeding material.

A heater element mounted within a cathode sleeve
operates to heat the oxide coating on the end of this
sleeve and causes electron emission. The elecric field
produced by the control electrode, or grid, and the
focusing electrode acts to draw the electrons emmit-
ted from the cathode into a narrow beam. The beam
then passes through the region between the focusing

electrode and the accelerating electrode where the
field set up by these electrodes causes the beam to
converge so that it reaches the fluorescent screen in a
small spot. This action is analogous to the action of
an optical lens on light.

The control electrode is ordinary operated at a
negative potential with respect to the cathode and
the beam curren, and therefore the brightness of the
spot is varied by varying this briaw potential. This
potential difference is approximately one hundred
volts maximum. The focusing electrode usually oper-
ates at a lower voltage than the accelerating electrode,
and it is by variation of this focusing electrode vol-
tage, in the vicinity of 500 volts for 2,000 volts ac-
celerating potential, that the spot is properly focused
on the screen. The entire beam-forming structure is
known as the “electron gun”.

In the cathode-ray tube described, focusing and
deflection of the beam are accomplished by electro-
static fields. It is also possible to use electro-magnetic
fields for either focusing or deflection or both, such
as in done in modern television receivers.

The intensifier electrode is operated at a higher
voltage than the accelerating electrode. This intensi-
fier electrode serves to accelerate the beam further
subsequent to deflection. The sensitivity of the beam
to electrostatic deflection varies inversely with the
potential applied to the accelerating electrode. This
potential, measured from the cathode, determines
the velocity of the electrons in the deflection plate
region. However, the brilliance of the trace caused
by the electron beam increases with increase in ac-
celerating potential. A compromise is greatly reduced,
since the beam may be deflected at a low accelerating
electrode potential and then further accelerated after
deflection by a higher potential applied to the in-
tensifier electrode.

Perhaps in the near future the cathode-ray tube
will be improved so that the high voltages that are
now necessary may be reduced, thereby minimizing
ths risk that is now taken in servicing television sets,
Oscilloscopes and other equipment. The cathode-ray
tube has come a long way from the time when it was
nothing more than a fantastic plaything, and cannot
at this point end its career. It is quite probable that
the tube will find new and varied applications to
that it may better serve mankind, not only for enter-
tainment, but also for educational purposes.

After due deliberation a young
engineer became convinced he
should go to a doctor for a com-
plete physical examination. The
following day he departed for the
doctor's office after first fortifying
himself against possible shock in
several local bars. When the check-
up was finally finished, he braced
himself in the waiting room eagerly
awaiting the medical report.

The door opened and the doctor
announced to the weaving gentle-
man, “After a thorough analysis,
I have come to the conclusion that
there is a small amount of blood

“Could you spare a poor hungry

The tramp knocked again. As the
woman opened the door he asked:
“Could I have a few words with
George?”

"Shay can you tell me where to

“\A7hy? Do you want to join?"

“No, I want to resign."

on one of the planning committees
or development of the departmen-
tal exhibits. The knighting cere-
mony is performed on the evening
of the Shamrock Ball.

Pitt, although a newcomer, is not
lagging in promotion of the event.
The week of activity is intro-
duced by the sale of a special
edition of the SKYSCRAPER EN-
GINEER. Last year a nurses-engi-
neers mixer dance was initiated and
will be held again on the Monday
evening of the Week. Tuesday
marks the arrival of St. Pat preced-
ed by the chapel service under the
supervision of University Chaplain
Luccock. St. Pat was driven in by
truck on his first visit to Pitt but
in 1955 a surprised student body
witnessed his descent by helicop-
ter on the front lawn of the Cathe-
dral. St. Pat on this occasion show-
ered the spectators with real sham-
rocks flown in from Ireland by
TWA and then presented the Pitt
chancellor and the Dean of Engi-
neering with shillelaghs. Tuesday
evening is reserved for department-
al functions. By Thursday all work
on the exhibits has been completed
and several thousand students,
friends, and families attend the
open house. A general seminar is
held in the morning and a prom-
inent speaker is presented on the
program.

The colorful Shamrock Ball is
the height of festivities and takes
place Friday evening. St. Patricia,
chosen by the engineering student ,
is crowned by St. Pat and the Sham-
rock Award is presented for the
best departmental display.

This past history brings us to
Engineers \A7eek 1956, and you.
VVe of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s School of Engineering and
Mines have been accused in the
past of indifference, of lack of
school spirit. In 1955 we proved
without a doubt, by the unques-
tionable successes of the Week, the
spirit of the student body. \’Ve dem-
onstrated to the University, the
people of Pittsburgh and the en-
gineers of other schools that Pitt
engineers are leaders. But as alway ,
it will necessitate your cooperation.
Contact your seminar leaders or
your advisor and offer your ser-
vices. Don’t just be a spectator, and
above all remember “Erin Go
Bragh" means “St. Patrick was an
Engineer!”

fa C i I  e S  e e [I c a  e  Engineers in Lockheed’s Structures Division are

supported by unmatched research and testing
facilities in their constant effort to increase strength

of Lockheed Engineers 

Among those facilities are the Lockheed-designed
500,000 Lb. Force Fatigue Machine, ﬁrst of

its size; Shimmy Tower, only one in private industry;
and Drop Test Tower, largest in the nation.

Facilities such as these give engineers a major
advantage in making technical advances — and thus
advancing their careers. Moreover, the large
number of projects always in motion at Lockheed
mean continuing opportunity for promotion

as well as job security.

Why Lockheed needs Engineers
with Structures training:

1. “Fail-Safe" Structures —Lockheed has begun an extensive
pioneering effort in the new concept of “fail-safe"
structures. Studies are being applied to virtually all
phases of Lockheed’s diversiﬁed development program-
already the largest in the company’s history.

2. New studies in_; Effect of high temperatures on
structures; optimization of thin-wing designs and other
aero-elastic problems; new materials such as ultra-high
heat treat steel; panel instability at extremely high speeds.

Clicker die steel is furnished to the die maker in either
single or double edged form in one of several standard
shapes. The die maker ﬁrst shapes the die by bending
the die steel to a pattern that provides the desired con-
ﬁguration, and then welds the two ends at a corner. He
ﬁnishes the die by grinding a bevel on the outside of the
cutting edge and ﬁling the inside edge. Before the ﬁn-
ished die is hardened and tempered, the die maker
forms identiﬁcation marks — combinations of circles
and squares — in the cutting edge so that the material
cut from it may be easily identiﬁed as to its size and
style.

In the cutting operation, the leather or other material
is placed on an oak block in the bed of the clicker
machine. Then the die is placed by hand on the material
which is cut as the aluminum faced head of the machine
presses the die through it. The clicking sound which
the head makes as it strikes the die is where the term
“clicker machine” derived its name.

what it is composed of

Clicker die steel as produced by the Crucible Steel
Company of America is a controlled electric steel in
which the combination of carbon and alloy is designed
for maximum toughness and proper hardness after heat
treatment.

Experience has proved that cold ﬁnished clicker die
steel is superior to hot rolled material for sizes ap-
proximately 34 inch and narrower because of its lower
degree of surface decarburization which permits the
use of slightly thinner sections. Cold ﬁnished material
also has a better surface ﬁnish with closer width and
thickness tolerances and thinner edges that require
less grinding and ﬁling to complete the die.

l.'lllll.'lBLE'S engineering service

As with clicker die steel, the Crucible Steel Company of
America is the leading producer of special purpose
steels. If you have a problem in specialty steels, our staff
of ﬁeld metallurgists with over 50 years experience in
ﬁne steel making is available to help you solve it.

PHOTOGRAPHY AT WORK—No. 18 in a Kodak series

What's their credit rating?

With Photography and Air Mail
working together, the Credit
Clearing House of Dun &
Bradstreet, Inc., speeds vast
quantities of information across
the country overnight.

 
 

Even if Dun & Bradstreet reporters photographed every
business they investigate, it would not be among the
biggest uses of photography this famous credit organi-
zation employs.

One most important way makes last-minute credit in-
formation in the apparel trades available thoughout the
country overnight. Current data and analysts’ opinions
on more than 150,000 apparel retailers are microﬁlmed,
transferred to micro—cards and ﬂown daily to Credit
Clearing oﬂices.

It’s another example of photography and Recordak
microﬁlming saving time and money. They are working
for railroads, banks, oil companies and countless other
businesses and industries both large and small.

Behind the many photographic products becoming in-
creasingly valuable today and those being planned for
tomorrow lie intriguing and challenging opportunities at
Kodak in research, development, design and production.

If you are interested in these opportunities in science
and engineering—whether you are a recent graduate or
a qualified returning serviceman, write to the Business
and Technical Personnel Department.

Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester 4, NY.

A Southern wholesale confectioner had re-
ceived an order for $10.00 worth of candy
bars from the Horsie Hollow Candy Shop. It
was a first order, and when the credit manager
didn’t ﬁnd the name listed in the Reference
Book, he phoned the Dun & Bradstreet office
for a report on the venture.

The reporter assigned to the case located
the concern on a dirt road, and he took a snap-
shot of the premises and its busy proprietors
which inspired this illustration. He inter-
viewed the owners and wrote a report which
was forwarded to the wholesaler.

It informed him that the enterprise was
operated as a partnership by two neighbors
who were both “eleven years of age and un-
married”—also that “although the owners are
men of limited means, they have a high stand-
ing in their community.” The ﬁnancial state-
ment indicated assets of $13.25 in merchandise
and cash, with a valuation of $35.00 for the
building consisting of a remodeled turkey coop.

The partners were reported as experienced
with a five-year record of selling lemonade
and cookies with their home pantries as the
principal sources of supply. There was no in-
debtedness as their mothers’ terms were
strictly C.O.D. The wholesaler took a more
liberal attitude and shipped on regular terms.
The bill was paid in ten days,
and the wholesaler opened
an account in his ledger
for the “Horsie Hollow
Candy Shop.”
