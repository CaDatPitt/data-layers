Mud pies and oil wells have one thing in
common-mud.

If Suzy tries to bake her pic, it either gets hard
or crumbles. The same thing can happen to drill-
ing muds which are used to lubricate bits and to
carry away rock cuttings.

The deeper you drill, the hotter it ' gets, the
greater the pressure. Three to four miles down
into the earth, temperatures often exceed 400°
—twice that of "boiling water. In such heat,
drilling muds used to break down, solidify.
Drilling stopped—wells had to be abandoned.

Mobil scientists worked years on the problem
—part of the company’s $1.5 million-a-month
research program. Now the answer—a mud that
stays muddy at higher temperatures and greater
pressures than ever before.

This Mobil Recipe for Mud made it possible

Volatile constituents evolve when the temperature of an Asphaltic product
rises sufficiently. The temperature at which they “flash" or temporarily
ignite when a small ﬂame is passed through them, during heating of the
product, is its ﬂash point. This temperature is usually well below the
fire point or the temperature which will support burning.

Volatile content is determined by gradually heating to (380°F, a measured

Relative amounts of volatile materials evaporating at different tempera-
tures and of residual Asphalt are thus determined. Further tests are
usually run on Asphalt residue to determine its characteristics.

Tests on Asphaltic Materials

The suitulnnty ‘ul an Asphaltic material for
highway or other use depends upon charac-
teristics which can be determined by a series
of tests. Four of the principal tests are:

PENETRATION TEST (Fig. 1)

Asphalt cements are classiﬁed into grades.
Those paving grades now recommended by
The Asphalt Institute are:

At Los Alamos . . . the challenge of controlled thermonuclear energy

 

The controlled release of fusion energy in a practical thermonuclear reactor will be an important
milestone in the nuclear age. This scientific achievement is the object of PROJECT SHERWOOD . ..
one of the interesting scientific investigations now under way at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.

Pictured above is “Columbus 1,” an early experimental device developed by Los Alamos
scientists to further this study. The bright line along the axis of the tube was produced by a dis-
charge in heated and highly conducting argon gas. This discharge was “pinched” down to a
small fraction of the tube diameter by the mutual attraction of its own currents. The temperature
was roughly equal to that of the sun’s photosphere. When deuterium was substituted for argon,
intense bursts of neutrons appeared at time A on the voltage time signatures of the pinch (above,
left), providing an interesting puzzle as to their origin. The similar signatures of successive
discharges-indicate the degree of reproducibility that has been achieved. Detailed studies of such
reproducible behavior have led to considerable advances in understanding both the dynamics and
the means for stable containment of heated plasmas.

At Los Alamos, in the cool mountain environment of northern New Mexico, you will find research
challenges worthy of your abilities. College graduates in the Physical Sciences or Engineering are
invited to write for information about the Laboratory, the attractive employee benefits, and the
family living and recreational facilities of the Los Alamos area. Write to:

HOW DO YOU WANT

ENGINEERS’ WEEK?

Thlrough the joint effort of Dean Fitterer and
the E<SUlVI .Cabinet, major changes in the Engineers’
Week celebration have been proposed. These changes
were evaluated by Cabinet during two summer meet-
ings. You, the engineering student, will be affected
by these proposals whether you do, or do not, partici-
pate in the Week.

Let us look at two of the most important suggested
changes and evaluate their effect on Engineers’ Week.
Cabinet and Dean Fitterer have proposed:

(1) that emphasis be placed on individual
participation in the area of displays, rather
than on departmental’ activity.

(2) that the period of time over which the
engineering celebration is held be increased
from one week to a maximum of three weeks.

Details telling why these suggested changes were pro-
posed for Engineers’ Week -can be found on pages 44
and 45. This column m-ust limit itself to an analysis
of the changes, seeing if they are in the best interests
of the Week and of the student body.

_Let us consider t-he first proposal, in-dividual
participation in displays. It is- thought that students
will spend their free ti-me developing new processes and
products and conducting research in various aspects
of their particular engineering field. Of course this
concept of individual participation is a good one, and
one which any University would prefer to foster and
develop. B-ut what will individual participation do to
Engineers’ Week?

It would decrease the number of students actively
participating in the celebration. Already burdened with
more work than any other undergra-duate, the engineer
does not have time for product development or basic
research. In most cases student engineers are not
equipped to do such work. We must also consider that,
in past weeks, more than two hundred engineers
labored in building departmental displays. Under the
new system, only a handful of participants could be
ex-pected.

Individual participatio-n would destroy two of the
elementary aims of the Week: introducing high school
students to various phases o-f engineering, and instilling
in them a desire to attend Pitt’s Engineering School.
Since high school students do not have the background
to understand new engineering developments, com-
plicated displays would not be of interest to them. Of

course a person will no-t pursue a course of study which
he feels he cannot master. In short, the idea of in-
dividual participation would introduce a technicality
to the display area of Engineers’ Week that would
make Open House a failure.

Now let us analyze the proposal fo-r lengthening
the Week to a two o-r three week celebration. The
arguments set forth in favor of this extension are, on
the surface, concrete and well meaning. Proponents
of a longer celebration claim there will be less time lost
from the classroom and that more students will attend
the traditional events.

Is this what will happen? Realistically the opposite
will occur. Although loss of classroom and study time
was apparent in last yea-r’s Week, the los.s during a
three week clelebration would be tremendous. With
an extended Week more time would be available for
planning and development-——time which would be
taken from school work. And any active planning
committee would probably add additional events to
the Week to supplement the traditional ones.

Another result of a longer celebration would be
the loss o-f enthusiasm among the student body. No
one can expect that a planning committee will be able
to "sustain, over a three week period, the high interest
that was apparent during this past Engineers’ Week.
Wearing of the traditional green derbies would stop,
since few would care to sport the toppers for three
weeks. -

These arguments against the concepts of individual
participation and extension of the Week are presented
here so that you are aware of the effect they will
have on your traditional celebration. If you agree
that the new proposals will harm Engineers’ Week,
you must speak up now before Cabinet adopts them.
How can you do this?

Talk with your E&M Cabinet representative.
Write to the SKYSCRAJPER ENGINEER and the
E&~M Bulletin. Speak out in your seminar and tell
your seminar officers that you oppose the changes
in Engineers’ Week. Remember, its your Week. How
do you want it?I

progress depends greatly on our engineers.
They have a key role in the production of some
50,000 types of apparatus and component parts
that Western Electric makes in a given year.

0 To our engineers falls the monumental task
of developing manufacturing operations and of
planning the installation of telephone central
oflice equipment across the nation. They devise
the new machines, tools and methods needed
to do our job. They also shoulder the major
responsibilities in carrying out the defense con-
tracts the government has asked us to take over
— major projects like the Nike guided missile
system and SAGE, the continental defense
system.

Q In the course of their technical work, engi-
neers participate in such broad managerial-
functions as production, merchandising, instal-
lation, and many others. What’s more, we have
a record of promotions from within. It’s not
surprising, therefore, that fifty-five percent of
the college graduates in our upper levels of
management have engineering degrees.

courage and speed the professional develop-
ment of our engineers. Just recently, for
example, we inaugurated a full-time off—the-job
Graduate Engineering Training Program at
special training centers, a program with few
parallels in American industry.

0 The new engineer moves into the ﬁrst phase
of this program, Introduction to Western Elec-
tric Engineering, four to six months after he
joins us and devotes nine weeks of study to
such technical subjects as communications sys-
tems, military electronic systems, product de-
sign principles. He takes part in the second
phase, General Development, after the first
year on the job. In this phase he devotes nine
weeks to courses in human relations, semantics,
engineering statistics, electronics, measure-
ments and instrumentation, systems circuit anal-
ysis. The third phase, Advanced Development
(4 weeks per year), is available to selected
engineers and is geared to the individual to
help develop his creative engineering abilities;
goes deeply into such subjects as magnetics,
computer applications, electronic switching,
radar fundamentals, feedback control systems

0 Besides this company-wide program, a
number of our divisions offer individual engi-
neering courses in their own specialties. We
also sponsor a Tuition Refund Plan for out-of-
hours study at nearby colleges. Open to all
employees, this plan helps our engineers study
for advanced degrees at Company expense.

PROFESSIONAL

DEVELOPMENT 

Evnlgin-eering as a profession is enterin-g one 0-f the most challenging decades
in its history. You, who are engineering students, will begin. your engineering em-
ployment in a period of unlimited oipuportuntities. If you take t-his as merely an
occasion for high earn-ings and neglect to develop professio-nallvy, your engineering
career will soon lose much of its isignzivﬁ-cance. A high salary and the possession of
material things are essential and desi-ra-ble, but these -alone are not sufficient for a
happy satisfying career.

Your contributions- to the ﬁeld as a p-racvti-cing engineer must of necessity,
be delayed until your undergraduate stu-dies are completed. There is, however, -no
need for delaying the formation of a sound personal philosophy of professional con-
duct. Professionalism i-n engineering is not guaranteed as .a fringe beneﬁt incident
to earning a bacvhelor -of science degree from an accredited school. It is, instead,
a life-long effort devoted to t-he establishment of attitudes, ideas, and obligations
relative to your place in industry an-d society as an engineer and a citizen.

Engineering pro-fess'ors exert a strong and lasting inﬂuence in the forma-
tion of a student’s professional perspective. In the selection of faculty, we have en-
deavored to em-ploy professors with sound -professional ideals in addition to their
teaching ability and knowledge of engineering.

Professors a-nd counselons in the expanding counseling -program at the U-ni-
versity of Pittsbuargh can -give guidance in professional development. Acceptance and
utilization of their advice is your responsibility. -A fnank discussion with faculty and
other graduate engineers about professional development is ~recormmen~ded for all
students. Registration is .a minimum essential for professional recognition and is
indicative of techntioal competence. It is the beginning of professional development,
not the end.

One of the be=s-t methods of professional development is the continuation
through life of study and read-ing habits established as a student. These will help
maintain technical competence, and -the more extensive your -reading, the greater your
social and cultural development. Technical society membership activities of college

Nothing could be further from the facts when it's

ELECTRICAL WORLD Magazine, can quickly tell
you that. He’s anything but a desk man-. . . covers

“In 1956, I made eight major ﬁeld trips, covered
close to 24,000 miles. I was underground in a trans-
former vault in Los Angeles, inside a diversion tun-
nel in Idaho, atop a steel transmission tower in
northern California. _Projects visited included The

the Republican National Convention. But none of
them can touch the “Operation CUE” A-Bomb test
I covered a year ago!

“My chance to witness the detonation of a nuclear
device came when the Federal Civil Defense Admin-
istration and the A.E.C. decided to test non-military
effects of the blast. I reported on what happened to
electrical utility lines and equipment.”

(Frank wouldn’t say so, but his story set a record . . .
from explosion to editorial pages in four days! The
pictures at right were part of his original coverage of
this fast-breaking—“hot”—news story for his maga-
zine.)

McGraw-Hill As ‘A Place to Work

Frank can tell you about this, too:

“My ﬁrst editorial job——with the Purdue Expo-
nent in college—didn’t use my engineering training,
but it showed me the way to communicate what’s
new in engineering . . . to report and interpret the
work of engineers for the beneﬁt of other engineers.

“When I got my B.S. in E.E. I started with
ELECTRICAL WORLD in New York. Within a year
I was promoted to Assistant Editor and made re-
sponsible for a department of the magazine. Before
the big jump to San Francisco as Western Editor in
’54 I served brieﬂy as assistant to the managing
editor. ‘

“As Western Editor my search for news takes me
into all important phases of the electric utility indus-
try—and into association with top management and
engineering men. Working with them is a constant
reminder that the choice of an engineering-editorial
career was the right one for me.”

DRAGSTERS

About seven years ago the ﬁrst drag strip opened
in Cialiforn-i'a. This marked the start of a new and still
rapidly growing type of auto racing. Today there are
over 130 s-trips in operation throughout the country.
Along with this new sport, a new type of racing car
evolved, the d-ragster.

Dragsters are de-sign-ed to start from rest and ac-
celerate as fast as possible to the ﬁn-ish line a quarter
mile away. But how fast is “as fast as possible?” What
limits the acceleration of a drag-ster?

One limitation that is placed on the dragster is that
it must be driven through its wheels. This eliminates

rocket or jet propelled ve‘h-icles. By New.ton’s law the
acceleration of the car is equal to the force divided by
the-mass. Thereﬁo-re the car must have a maximum of
-power with a -minimum of weight.

‘On a wheel driven vehicle t-he force for accelera-
tion is provided by the whee-l as it contacts the ground.
The maximum force the wheel can deliver is equal to
the weight pressing down on -it times its coefficient of
friction. Text book values of this ooefficient for rubber
tires on asphalt (most strips are asphalt) are be-
tween 0.75 and 0.9 when the car is driven through
the rear wheel-s only, the maximum force can only be

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

produced if the ent-ire car weight is on those wheels.
If a car is designed to have all of its ‘weight on the
driving wheels, «the maximum acceleration should be
equa-l to 0.9g.

But a vehicle of this type: would not have rotation-
al equilibrium aibout its rear axle when accelerating.
The front wheels would leave the ground and steer-
-ing would be impossible if the car had not al-ready
turned over. ‘To get '-the maximum from a car -with a
rear-Wheel drive and keep the front end-on the ground,
the rotation forces must be considered.

The inertia weigh-t shift should be ﬁgured ~ﬁrst.
It is dependent "on the weight of the car, the height
of the cen-ter of gravity, the wheel base of the car, and
the rate of —acceleration. An example may help to clari-
fy the problem. Assume the total‘ weight of a drag-ster
-to be 1500 pound-s. I-ts coefficient of friction will b‘e 0.9,

while the center of gravity will be one-foot from the
ground and two-feet in front of the rear axle. The
wheel base is to be 120 inches.

C-alculiations show -the =acceleration to be 0.72g.
With this information the weight shift moment is found
to be 1970 foot-‘pounds. This -gives a value for weight
shift of 108 pounds, or 7.2% of the total weight is
tran-s.ferre.d by "this inertia force.

Another force which tends to lift the front end up
is -the axle -torque reaction. This force is equal and
opposite to the torque supplied -to the rear whee-ls. In
this example 118 pounds or 7Q9% of the total weight
shifted. The total weight shift is 226 pounds, or 15.1%
of the total weight. From an original value of 300
pounds, only 74 pounds contin-ued to act on the front
wheels. Although the s-ta-tic weight distribution was
80% rear and 20% fron-t, this example shows that under
maximum acceleration the weight distribution became
95.1% rear and 4.9% front. This is considered to be
the practical‘ maximum weigh-t distribution for a car

OCTOBER

with twio--wheel drive. It is not the best solution for
maximum acceleration, ‘however, since 4.9% of the
weight is not being used for increased traction and
-acceleration.

The best solution would be a four-wheel drive with
all of the ‘wheels havirng equal weight and all adding
to the forward force. The weight should be distributed
equally un-der acceleration; that is, the static weight
distribution will have 15% mo-re weight on the front
-wheels of a vehicle with four-wheel drive.

Knowing that the dfagster can accelerate at a
constant 0.9g with sufficient power, it is possible to cal-
culate the ﬁnal velocity and.‘ time required to travel the
quarter mile. Calculations show -that the elapsed time
would be 9.55 seconds and the ﬁnal speed would be
189 -miles per hour. Th-eoretically then these ﬁgures
represent the maximum possible perfonrrnance of the
ultimate dragster. Bu-t ‘a study of the actual perform-
ance of the dragster must he made before the ultimate
can be -achieved. .

The official record for the quiariter-mile is held,
as of June 1957, -by the ‘Cooik-Bedwell s-pecial, a two-
wheel drive, -Chrysler powered ca-r from Southern
-C‘al-i-fornia wi-th;~~a speed of 168.85 miles per hour and an
elasped time of 8.89 seconds. Notice that the elasped
time is well below the ultimate. The acceleration rate
for an 8.89 second quarter--mile is 33.4 feet per second
per second which is faster than gravity. This is also as-
suming a constant acceler-a-tion rate, -but recent tests
have proven that the accelera'ti.on is greatest at the
start and drops oﬂ consideraibly at the end of the strip
(‘See graph). This variable acceleration is the reason
the ﬁnal speed is not near -the theoretical ultimate.
Based on the ﬁnal speed alone, the average aocele-ra-

Dispﬁlaying showmanship at drag races, the Starter
gives the “G0” signal to two competition dragsters.

23

tion is only 23.2 feet per second per second. As t-hese
tests have shown, t'he acceleration rate may ‘be as high
as 2g s a-t the start. If this rate could be maintained, the
ﬁnal velocity would be 281 miles per hour. In view
of these facts what will be the ultimate speed and elaps-
ed time, and why doesn’t it agree with the :c-alc-ula-ted
values?

For part of the quarter-mile the acceleration ex-
ceeds grav-ity. In order for this to happen one of two
thngs or a combination of both must be taking place:
(1) The coeff~icien't of friction between tire and road
must be above 1.0 and/or  the .force acting down on
the rear tires is greater than the entire weight of the
car.

There are no actual test -ﬁgures for the coefficient
of frictio-n of the tires used on dragsters. Most authori-
ties say it is probably over 1.0 and possibly close to 2.0.

These high values are obtained because the tire
called an asphalt sliok, h-as about an eighut-inch wide,
ﬂat, thi-ck, soft irubber tread completely free of any
groovepattern and inﬂated anywhere from 6 to 30 psi.
This soft tire is believed to ﬁll all of the small irregular-
-ities in the road and act like a rack and pinion arrange-
ment.

The situation where the force acting on the rea-r

tires becomes greater than the car weight could only
happen for an instant. When the car leaves the start-
ing l-ine, the weight shift caused by inertia and axle

‘tor ue m-a take lace uick enou h to create a size-
(1 Y P q 8'

able momentum force which in turn may transmit a
force greater than the car weight to the rear wheels.
But thi's force would on-ly last for a small fraction of a
se'c'onc’l. Once -the weight shift has taken place, the
car would be back in its normal inertia and axle torque
weigh-t shift condition.

Of these two conditions -the increased coefficient of
friction seems to be the mos-t inﬂuential factor. The
actual ulntivmate speed and el-asped time cannot be ﬁgur-

24

ed since the true coefficient of friction is not known.
Since cars have exceeded an acceleration of 2g’s for
short distances, perhaps, with smaller weight to power
ratios and streamlined bodies, this rate could be,main-
tained longer and elapsed time could drop to nearly
7.0 second-s with speeds over 200 miles per hour.

Most of the outstanding cars today, including the
record holder, are of the slingsh.-ot design. This design
places the driver behind the rear axle and eliminate-s
the driveshaft by connecting the transmission directly
to the differential in order that the engine ‘weight may
be concentrated more on the rear wheels. The differ-
ential action of the rear axle is usually eliminated so
both wheels will be driving at all times.

For increased steering con-trol the rear tread
width is reduced to about three feet. This triangular
appearan-ce caused by wide tread in front, narrow
tread at the rear, and the driver in the back is the
‘reason for the term slingshot design. It was found that
a wide, rear tread width was undesirable because of
the ﬁshtail effect. If one wheel started to lose traction
because of dirt on the strip or small surface irregular-
ities, -th-e wheel with traction would tend to move in an
arc using the lost traction wheel as a pivot point. With
very little weight on the “front wheels steering was al-
most impossible. By moving the wheels closer together
the drags-te-r approached a three-wheel design which
eliminated all pivoting tendencies. Stability was fur-
ther increased by changing front axle caster settings
from the usual 2 degrees to 15 degrees, thus making it
harder for the wheels to deviate from a straight line.

The engines used in the fastest dra-gsters a-re fuel

to 100% nitromet-hane for fuel. The only exception is

the record holder, Cook-Bedwell car, which uses six
unblo-wn -carburetors on a Chrysler V-8. Chevrolet,
Oldsmobile, and Cadillac are also popular engines. The
horsepower of some of the big 400 cubic inch Chryslers
with blower and 100% nitro is over 600 horsepower at
7,000 revolutions per minute. Ability to get the max-
imum horsepower per cubic inch, because of the hemis-
pherical combustion chamber, is the reason for the
popularity of the Chrysler. Non-e of the cars use radia-
tors, starters, batteries, or generators since they are
not needed and add considerable weight. The engines
never heat up since they are only run for about 30
seconds. They are push startedand have magneto igni-
tions.

All dragsters have two-wheel brakes on the rear.
None are used on the front because of the light weight
condition which would cause front wheel lock-up and
loss of control.

Since traction is such a problem even with asphalt
slicks, many cars run in high gear only; some start in
second gear and shift into high after several hundred
feet. In working toward the solution of this problem
and others similar to it, the production‘ of the ultimate‘
dragster becomes inevitable. The ultimate dragster will
retain many of the current features in its design, but
it will also have many entirely new ideas. In the future
the dragsters will have a four wheel design making use
of all of the weight for tractive force. The engine will
have to produce greater horsepower for its weight. Pro-
bably the gas turbine driving through a torque. con-

'verter is the solution to this problem.

The narrow rear axle will not be retained since
all four wheels will be driving and the weight on the
front wheels will be great enough to maintain control.
The suspension will differ since it will be of independent
design rather than the present solid, one—piece type.

OCTOBJ:.n

These independently sprung axles will increase the
sprung to unsprung weight ratio, thus allowing the
wheels to follow more closely the irregularities of the
pavement and maintain maximum traction. No differ-
ential action will be used on either set.

The body, which up until recently was thought to
be only excess weight, will be a key factor in maintain-
ing a high acceleration rate over the last part of the
strip. It must be as free from air resistance as passible.
This means fully enclosed wheels and driver cockpits
as well as a small frontal area. When air drag is reduc-
ed considerably, the brakes will have to do a bigger
job. If the braking distance is not increased on the
present drag strips, the ultimate dragster will have
to brake at 2g’s. To accomplish this it will take heavy
duty spot brakes and a small parachute similar to that
used on jet planes. Co that the dragster will be as
light as possible, a special chassis and body will be
needed. A stressed, skin-type frame and body would
be good, but the ultimate would be a single integral
unit cast from a super light-weight alloy.

One other factor that limits high" ﬁnal speeds,
though it reduces the elapsed time, is the asphalt slick
which has a large rolling resistance at high speed. A
new tire design has been suggested that may help both
elapsed time and top speed. The tire casing would be

thin and ﬂexible, inﬂated to a low pressure, and would

resemble the asphalt slick at rest and low speeds. The
tire would be designed so that at high speeds the cen-
trifugal force would cause the center of the tread to
expand outward and the car would ride on a thin rib-
bon of rubber instead of the wide, ﬂat section that
they run on presently.

The dragsters of today are fast in regard to elapsed
time, but as for final speed there is much room for
improvement before the ultimate dragster is achieved.

Every time critics of television, and their more

vocal non-wplrofessi-oznal colleagues, cry out against the
inadequacies of TV reproduction, the plaint touches a
sensitive spot in -the heart of the TV industry. For lack
of agood reproduction a rating may be lost, so upset
is the p-ublic -by a low-ﬁ kinesoope or an inept ﬁlm.

The latest and most successful move toward a cure
for these affliction-s is an invention known as Tele-Cam.
-Light weight and streamlined, the device ena-bles a
standard television un-it to act simultaneously as a
motion picture camera.

Using a common lens turret, Tele-Cam easily con-
vert-s a TV camera into a maker of clear 16mm -ﬁlm,
either color or black and white. The transformation
can be accomplished in less th-an 20 minutes without
any drastic adaptation of the TV camera. The end
product is a high-quality reproduction, completed in a
fraction of the time'usually required and at a cost con-
sideralbly lowe-r than that of ordinary ﬁlm production
methods.

Tele-Cam was developed in June 1956. .A working
model of Tele-Cam was constructed three months after
the original drawings were completed. A month later,
the Tele-Cam units were in full-time operation at
WQED, .Pit'ts‘burgh’~s pioneering educational TV outlet.

Basically, Tele-Cam‘ works on a sp-lit-beam princi-

ple -with apepro-ximately 15 per cent of the light utilized
in utrarn'smiIss~ion of the live image and up no 80 per cent
passing" into the ﬁlm camera. These percentages can «be
varied to ac-oomo-date different ﬁlms and conditions.
The most obvious advantage is that the process clears
the 525-line barrier imposed by kinescope and tape.
The ﬁlm is sharp an-d clear, without -the distortion and
fuzziness that plague even the best kinescopes.

The heart of the Tele-Cam is the optical system
which consists of a common len-s turret through which
the light pas-se«s for -both the ﬁlm and the television
camera. Behind the lens -t-urret the beam splitter passes
a portion of the lig-ht through it to. the television pickup
tu-be while the rest of the light is reflected onto a
aﬁeld l-ens where an -image is -formed. This image is re-
layed -through the Tele-Cam optical system onto a
16mm -motion pictu-re ﬁlm. In this system, the ﬁlm
camera al-ways sees exactly what the television camera
does and is in focus when the TV pictuure is in focus.
Focusing is accomplished by moving the whole lens
turret toward or away from the beam splitter assembly.

Tele--Cam’s optical system, designed in co-operation
with Pittsburg-h’s B-uhl Optical —Co., automatically in-
su'res a “live” look-in-g reproduction. Since the ﬁlm cam-
era has a depth of focus greater than that of the TV
camera, even a reasonably ‘well-focused TV picture

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

gua-rantees a ﬁlm picture in good focus.

With Tele-C-am, the -more precise television view-
ﬁnder selects the pictures, and the -problems of focus
and parallax that dog ordinary miorvie-making disap-
pear. Even when the program is not ‘to be telecast, t-he
director and cameraman know that what they see on
monitor and viewﬁnder is precisely what they will see
on the ﬁl-m.

Tele-Cam -technique has effects that reach beyond
the TV screen. Because Tele-Cam can produce superior
16mm ﬁlm more quickly and more economically, it can
supply the growing demand, not only of TV, but of
schools, -clubs, and civic groups for educational mater-
ial. The Encyclopaedia Britannica organization is an ex-
ample of this demand. Tele-Cam has made colror repro-
ducution-s of a series of physics lectu-res telecast by
WQED for 'B‘ri-tann-ica. The 165 ﬁlms made are in use
in a num!ber of C-hicago h-igh schools and in other school
systems throughout the country. This use of Tele-Cam
in the widening educational ﬁeld is one of the device’s
most important -applications.

“Adapta‘bility” is a key word in the Tele-Cam
story. The original model, designed for use with RCA
equipment, has a trim, modern look and is much
lighter than other devices of a similar nature.

A newer model, presently in production, is 50

pounds lighter than the original one due to exclusive
use of aluminum castings‘ for all major parts of the
assembly and a completely redesigned, more compact
construction. The new model is extremely versatile in
that it can be used with R-GA, General Electric, and
DuIMon-.t television camera systems. It can also be
adapted for use with various vidicon cameras.

The addition of Tele-Cam to the television a'ppa~ra-
tus «poses only one problem for the cameraman. He h-as
to push the Tele-Cam button to “On.”

Neither the TV nor the ﬁlm camera need be modi-
ﬁed. Tele-Cam includes everything ne-cessa-ry for the
conversion: base plate, focusing turret mounting plate,
beam-splitter, optical system, and Auricon 1200@
16mm ﬁlm c~amera—all i-n proper alignment.

An integrated Tele-Cam unit is no-w under devel-«

opment which is a complete television and ﬁlm unit
in one camera. It will not he an adaptor. The televi-
sion portion has a vidi-con A-piokup tube and a 7-inch
viewﬁnder for ease of focusing. The ﬁlm transport
uses an Auricon movement which has been modiﬁed to
suit the unit. The ﬁlm trans-po-rt, vidiucon pickup tube,
View-ﬁn-der, and ﬁlm magazine are in one unit approxi-
mately the size of -a DuMont image orthicon television

camera. Total weight of the integrated unit will be

albout 90 pounds which is 30 pounds lighter than a
standard studio. televisinon camera.

With the -perfection of Tele-Cam, come the prob-
lems of distribution. The current plan is to distribute
Tele-Cam on a lease basis. As distribution tbecomes
general, it’s likely that viewers will have to wait until
the end o-f the program before they realize that “This
has been a ﬁlm presentation.” I

Once the Tele-Qam is used for a television broadcast, films
of the programlare kept on file.

The Light
With no Third Dimension

A new source of light is nearing
practicality. Called electrolumines-
cence, it comes from a ﬂat surface.
By the twist of a knob, you can
change the brightness, or even the
color, of a room.

Since electric lighting ﬁrst became
practical, only three basically dif-
ferent light sources have achieved
widespread use—incandescent, ﬂuo-
rescent, and gas-discharge lamps.
Now a fourth basic type——electro-
lurninescence—is nearing practical-
ity. With fewer theoretical limita-
tions than any of its predecessors,
it promises to revolutionize lighting

and become a practical light source
of the future.

In an incandescent lamp, light
comes from a single point. In a
fluorescent lamp (form of gas-
discharge), light comes from a
straight line. In electroluminescence,
light comes from an area or ﬂat sur-
face. Electroluminescence is light
emission from phosphor powders em-
bedded in an insulator, excited by
an a-c ﬁeld.

Westinghouse engineers gave the
ﬁrst practical demonstration of this
new light source. They lighted an
entire room with ﬂat electrolumi-

Court-

nescent panels on the ceiling and
three walls. These panels were one-
foot-square ﬂat glass plates about
as thick as a window pane and coated
with a plastic containing the phos-
phor. They were topped off by an
aluminum conducting coating.
Hooked up to a source of power,
these plates had a brightness of 100
foot lamberts in their present stage
of development.

Since some phosphors have more
than one emission band, the ‘color
and brightness of electroluminescent
lighting can be changed by varying
the frequency. It is possible to con-
trol the color of a room, and bright-
ness too, simply by twisting a knob.
Besides supplying ordinary light,
this new light source has other fas-
cinating possibilities. Just one is
“picture framing” television. An
electroluminescent cell might replace
the conventional cathode-ray tube
in such a set.

treatment are incorporated in this clarifier.

In May of 1957, Pittsburgh Mayor David L. Law-
rence broke ground for a new water cl-arinfying plant
near t-he Aspinwall Pumping Station as part of a water
department ‘modernization program. The new clariﬁer,
designed by th.e Swindell--Dressler Corporation, is slat-
ed for completion sometime i.n 1959. According to en-
gineers, tihis innova'ti'ori will not only give better water,
but will save the taxpayers as much as $200,000 yearly.
To re-alize the value o-f the new clarifying system, it
-is necessary to understand how the present system
operates.

Water that Pittsb-urghers drink today is obtained
from the Allegheny River. At the Ross Pumping Sta-
tion in Aspinvwall, raw river ‘water -is pumped through
a 96-in-c-h steel, concrevte-encased -conduit about 2000
feet in length, to the nearby ﬁltration plant. Th-is ﬁltra-
tion plant contains a ﬁfteen and one-half million gallon"

ﬁlters. As the -water pases through the receiving basin,
a large part of the suspended matter is deposited. Parti-
al-ly puriﬁed, the water leaves the receiving basin
through eight, 48-incih outlets to enter the two settling

28

‘basins on either side of the large receiving ‘basin. The
settling basins each cover an area of about twelve
acres, a depth -of rﬁvfteen feet, and h-ave a capacity of
57,000,000 million gallons. As the -water ﬂows through
these basins, it loses more suspended matter and ﬁnally
passes out at the ends =funt=hest away from the central
receiving *b-a-sin into a 96-inch con-crete conduit. This
-conc-rete pipeline is the source of the settled water for
the forty-«six slow s-and filters.

These forty-six ﬁlters are arranged in four groups
called galleries. These galleries, underground work-
rooms, are 31 by 1,000 feet and house valves, piping,
entrance doors to individual ﬁlters, regulating and
measuring devices, sand washing machinery, and other
necessary equi-pment. Each ﬁlter is an underg-round con-
crete room 12 feet highland one acre in area. On -the
ﬂoor of each ﬁlter are open-joinlted, tile pipe lines, used

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

to collect the ﬁltered water and convey it to resevoir
pipelines.

These tile collecting pipes are covered with one
foot of gravel and three feet of graded sand. The ﬁl-
tration process consists of ﬁlling a ﬁlter with approx-
imately six feet of water and allowing the water to sift
through the sand and gravel to the collecting pipes.
The rate of ﬁltering depends on the amount of impuri-
ties present in the ﬁlter. Three and one-half million
gallons of ﬁltered water, per acre, per day is the max-
imum output of a ﬁlter.

The water from the ﬁlter is then collected and goes
through a 124--inch concrete conduit which leads to the
clear water resevoir. As the water enters the 50,000,000
gallon resevoir, chlorine is added to completely rid the
water of any bacterial or organic contamination. Com-
pletely puriﬁed, the water is now distributed to the con-
sumer.

Although this system for water puriﬁcation pro-
duces excellent water, the method is slow and expen-
sive. To overcome these problems, the decision was
made to construct a new clariﬁer plant which would
operate ahead of the slow sand ﬁlters and remove much
of the impurities chemically rather than through ﬁltra-
tion.

The new clariﬁer, which will be located a short dis-
tance downstream from the Ross Pumping Station, will
be 586 by 150 feet and will have a water depth of 20
feet. It will have an eleven million gallon capacity
with design flow conditions based on a daily capacity

of between 100 and 125 million gallons.

As in the present system, the raw water sourc
will be the Allegheny River. The water will be pumpex
directly into the new clariﬁer by the Ross Pumpin
Station. Once in the clariﬁer the water will have
total detention period of about two hours and fort
minutes. This will include two minutes in the rapi
mixing chambers and 17. minutes in the sixteen ﬂoccu

‘ation chambers.

Prior to the waters entrance in the mixing cha 1-
ber, its ﬁrst stop on its journey through the plant
chlorine will be applied to the 72-inch raw water main.
This pre-chlorination is necessary for the oxidation of
organic matter prior to the potassium permanganate
treatment. The chlorine residual will be held between
0.3 and 0.5 parts per million when the temperature of
the water is below 60 degrees F. and between 1.0 and
3.0 parts per million when the temperature of the water
is above 80 degrees F.

The water will then enter the mixing chamber
where lime and alum will be added. Adding alum will
create a gelatinous substance called ﬂoc which will trap
the turbidity or impurities and quickly settle them.
Lime will control the pH of the water, which is an im-
portant factor in ﬂoc formation and settling. During
periods of low temperature and low turbidity, provision
has been made for sludge recirculation. The addition of
sludge to the high speed mixing chamber will be used
to seed low turbidity water and greatly reduce the need
for additional slum and other ﬂocculant aid require-

ments. Provision has also been made for the addition of
activated carbon for the taste and odor control of the
water when necessary.

It has -also been proposed, that potassium perman-
ganate be added to the «raw water in the mixing cham-
bers for the removal of iron and manganese. The aver-
age amount of potassium permanganate to be used will
be three parts per million. The manganese content of
the water of the Allegheny River varies from zero to
6.8 parts per million. It has been proposed to discontin-
ue the potassium permanganate treatment when the
ma-nganese content of the raw water exceeds 1.5 parts
per mi-llion, and to suvbstitute with a so-called high
pH treatment. This consists ‘of increasing the lime

’ dosage until the pH of the water ex-ceeds 8.5. At this

pH, the manganese will -precipata-te in the clariﬁer. The
mixing will be accomplished by rapid mechanical mix-
ers in a.-pproxima-tely two minutes.

After the water -has been chemically treated and
allowed to remain seventeen minutes in the ﬂocculation
chamber, ‘it will ﬂow into the upﬂow basins and then
into 76 weir troughs, which contain weirs or walls.
These troughs will produce a weir edge overﬂow of 7.6
gallons per I-inear foot on a total spill edge of 9120
linear feet. Velocities in the raw water and clear water
ﬂumes are expected to be one foot per second and 1.35
feet per second respectively. As the water ﬂows. over
these troughs, the ﬂoc has settled out into the deeper
part of the 20-foot deep basins. About two hours and

30

forty minutes after raw water -has entered the clariﬁer,
it will ﬂow into the 96-inch main which leads to the
receiving basin in the ﬁltrationp-lant. To maintain the
pre-chlorine residual present when the water entered
the mixing chamber, additional Chlorine can -be added
in this receiving basin.

F-rom -the receiving basin the water w-ill pass out
into the settling basin. The total detention time of the
water in the receiving and settling basin will be eight
h-ours. This additional time before the water enters the
ﬁlters will be useful in -the settling of sodium, calcium
sulphate, and any remaining ﬂoc from the initial stages
of the clarinﬁer operation-. A

The settled water will then be transported to the
ﬁlters. It is here that the full value of the clariﬁcation
process will be seen. Since most of the impurities will
have been removed chemically in the clariﬁer, tlhe ﬁl-
tration rate will increase from the present 3.5 million
gallons per acre, per day to a rate of about 7 or 8
million gallons per acre, per day. Therefore, the ﬁltra-
tion plant will be able to operate with half as many
ﬁlters now in service and with.a consequent reduction in
the labor force. It is believed that the sand ﬁlters may
be in constant use for 6 to 8 weeks without having to
-be shut-down for cleaning and repairs. Present average
for constant usage is 16 days. It is interesting to note
that, at present, it is not unusual -for the ﬁlters to clog
up after only 3 or 4 days during periods of excessively
-high turbidity of the river.

The water from the ﬁlters will -then be collected
and go through a -concrete conduit, 124 inches in diame-
ter, to the ﬁltered water reservoir or clear well. Once
the water has entered the clear well or reservoir, it will
receive its ﬁnal chemical treatment before distribution
to the consumer. A ﬁnal dose of chlorine will kill any
existing bacteria and sterilize the water. Addition of
ﬂuorine -will occur at this point in the operation.. It
"has been proposed that this ﬂuorine in the form of
hydroﬂuosilicic acid be purchased in tank car lots,
stored in rubber-lined steel tanks in the chemical stor-
age house, and pumped to the inﬂuent ﬂume of the
clear well by means of proportioning pumps.

This brief View of the overall operation of the new
clarifying plant indicates that the system will have a
ﬂexibility of treatment to handle all variations in raw
water conditions. It can also take advantage of any
new -developments in science. The clari-ﬁer is designed
in such a man-ner that the clariﬁed water might go
directly to a -rapid sand (ﬁltration plant, which the ci-ty
‘hopes to constru-ct in the near ‘future. The clariﬁer is
-constructed in such -a way, that with the future addi-
tion of a mode-rn rapid sand ﬁlter plant, no changes
are necessary.

The new cla-ri-ﬁer is the ﬁ-rst initial step for the
city of Pittsburgh to eventually have an up-to-date
an-d very modern water plant‘ incorporating the latest
devices in the science of water treatment for municipal
and industrial con-sumpt-ion.fI

GAS PARTITION CHROMOTOGRAPHY

A simple, inexpensive technique for the analysis of gas mixtures. V

Gas—liquid or p-artition chromatography is a newly
developed process for the separation of the components
of a gaseous mixture, the identiﬁcation of each of the
components, and a measuring of the relative quantity of
these constituents. Hailed as the greatest advance of
gas and vaporizable liquid analysis since the spectro-
scope, new applications of gas-liquid partition chrom-
atography are continually being discovered.

Many applications of partition chromatography
are in the petroleum, petrochemical, natural gas, plas-
tics, synthetic ﬁbers, explosives, paint and lacquer, phar-
maceutical, and compressed gas industries. It is being
used in cancer studies, studies of combustion products,
oil research, jet fuel synthesis, food additives, silicones,
toilet goods, and aromatics, because sensitivity of a few
parts per million is obtainable. This technique can
be useful in air pollution studies also. Analytical dis-
tillations which formerly required several-hours time
and a liter of l.iquid sample can now be obviated by
partition chromatography which takes a few minutes
and a fraction of a milliliter of liquid sample. Further-
more, partition chromatography, will separate azeo-
tropes and components having nearly identical boiling
points and other physical properties without apparent
difficulty. At the present time, gas-liquid or partition
chromatography is limited to gases and vapors of
liquid mixtures boiling below 400 degrees Centigrade.

The chromatographic process principle was first
discovered by M. S. Tswett at the University of War-
saw in 1906. He used an elution technique in the separ-
ation of plant pigments and becauuse of the resulting
color bonds produced in this columns, named the pro-
cess chromatography. Various types om chromatography,
including paper chromatography, were developed and
used but it was not until 35 years later, in 1941, that

Martin and Synge developed a partition chromato-
graphy in which the stationary phase was a liquid on
an inert granular support. In spite of the fact that
Martin predicted this method could be applied to

the separation of gas mixtures, this ﬁeld lay idle Eleven
years later in England, in 1952, James and Martin
pioneered the first successful vapor-liquid chromato-
graphic separations. Practically the whole of the devel-
opment has come from England over the past 5 years.
Currently, there is a vertiab-le tidal wave of research
in this country, primarily to extend the applications
of this technique. Instrument manufacturers are com-
petitively racing to develop better automatic apparatus.
Consequently, very little basic research is now being
done.

Most leading instrument manufacturers have in-
struments available at a cost ranging from one to sever-
al thousand dollars. The basic components are the
chromatographic column, a detector cell, and an auto-
matic recorder.

The partition chromatographic column (Figure 1)
consists of a copper or glass tube usually about 6 mm.
in diameter and from 2 to 20 feet long. The tube is
ﬁlled with a granular inert support of high surface
area coated several molecular layers deep with a prac-
tically non-volatile liquid called the partitioning agent.
The eluent, a carrier or washing gas, continuously
sweeps through the column. Each component or molec-
ular type of the mixture undergoing analysis has its
own solubility or affinity for the partitioning agent or
liquid coating. Gas or vapor molecules are absorbed in
the liquid or stationary phase and then return in-to
the ‘mobile carrier gas phase repeatedly. The residence
time of molecular types while on or in the liquid phase
will vary, being slightly longer for more “soluble”
types. Thus a less soluble type will emerge from the
column before a more soluble type. This simple fact
is the opera-ting principle of partition chromatography.

The mechanism of the process is easily depicted
(Figure 2). Consider a single gas molecule being swept
through the chromatographic column by the eluent
gas. Next consider a strip of liquid coating pulled off
from an inert solid granule and stretched out in the

31

direction of the carrier gas ﬂow. As the gas molecule is
swept along by the eluent, it may craslh head on
through the stagnant gas ﬁlm over the liquid coating
if the angle, alpha, is 90 degrees. When the an-gle of
incidence is less than 90 degrees, the molecule will be
required to partially diffuse through the stagnant gas
«ﬁlm into the liquid coating. Once a molecule reaches
the liquid surface, it is momentarily absorbed ._until
the concentr-ation of gas molecules at or near the
liquid coating gas interface ‘becomes s_uf‘l"ic-iently high to
cause a reversal of diffusion back into the lea-ned-out
gas phase. Finally the gas molecule is washed up again
into the eluent stream and the process is repeated. A
combination of two different molecules results in a dif-
ference in retention time on the liquid phase. This
causes the molecule to -progress at different rates but to
emerge separately from the column. Only the basic
simplicity of this -proces-s -permits such easy visuvalizaitiion
of it.

Once the constituents of a mixtu-re have been sep-

tion causes a drop in thermal conductivity. This drop
is proportional to the weight fraction of diluent. The
bridge is adjusted so as -to give a straight base line at
a constant eluent ﬂow rate on one side of the recorder
chart. When a component of a mixture emerges from
the column and passes through the cell, a line resemb-
ling a normal curve is traced by the recorder pen. The
peak of this curve indicates th-e highest concentration in
the carrier gas of the sepa-rated component. Thermal
connductivity1 is indicated by the ﬁlament resisitanice. The
ﬁlament resistance is a function of ﬁllament temperature
which at conditions of steady energy rat input is a
function of the ability of the carrier gas and its dilu-
ent to transfer away heat energy. These detector cells
-give lonig trouble-free service and are remarkably sensi-
tive.

A density balance detector is -being tried which
-measures differences in eluent density and diluted elu-
ent density. At the presen-t this cell is oversensit-ive for
general service. Another type of cell is based on the
d-iﬁlerence in heat of combustion between inlet and
‘outlet carrier gas. This detector is quite suitable for
many types of analyses.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses are both re-
corded simultaneously. The simplest method of calibra-
tion -for qualitative analyses, other than running stand-
ards of known composition, is to measure column resi-
dence times of expected constituents. Ina given column,

retention time previously determined. Light hydrocar-
bons emerge from the column in the order.of increasing
boiling -points. Quanti-ta.'tive an-alyses are made directly
from the chromatograms (Figure 3). Each component
is indicated by -an individual peak and normal curve-
type slopes on either side of this peak. The area under
each -curve is proportional to -the weight fraction of
its component. The weight conscentrat-ion is obtained
by the ratio of the area for a particular component
divided by the total area, which i-s the sum of each area
representing each component. This weight con'cen-t-ra-
tion is usually mul-tixplied by a correction factor deter-
mined by calibration with a known stand-ard. A few
instruments  automatic integrators are now avail-
able so that p-recise quantative results -are available im-
mediately.

No scientist ever feels he unders-tands a process
until he recognizes the major independant variables and
gains some factual knowledge of their iﬂuence.

Of -the independent variables, the choice of par-
titioning liquid is the most crit-i-cal single -factor in parti-
tion chromatography. No separation will be accom-
plish-ed unless the partiti-oning agent is exactly suitable.
Tlhis liquid must have low volatility so as not to vapor-
ize off an-d cause reference line drift on the chromato-
gram. Most important of all, each component of the
mixture to «be -analyzed must be soluble in the station-
ary liquid coating. In some instances two or more col-
umns are used to analyze complex mixtures with each
-column separating families of components. The suit-
ability of many agents for speciﬁc analyses has already
-been determined and is available in literature, but

more need to be found. One way is to prepare and
test columns treated with new agents. A more suitalble
way is to measure -constituent solubility in new liquids
using a gas burette system.

Various eluent gas-es such as hydrogen, nitrogen,
helium, dry air an-d others are used in the partition
chroma-tograp'hy process. The eluent -rate is usually 20
to 80 rnilli-liters per minu-te. Increasing -the eluent rate
sharply cuts down analysis time -bu-t at a loss of resolu-
tion. Adjustment to an oprtirmum eluent rate is left
to the skill and experience of the instrument operator.

The column length can be arbi-tra-ry; two meter
columns are suitable and -most generally used. If the
-column is too -long, extra analysis time will be consum-
ed. Adjustment of eluent rate, column temperature, and
sample size is readily made for any column of ﬁx-ed
length.

Temperature effects are proportional to the change
of constituent solubility in the partitioning liquid. An
increase in temperature decreases gas solubility which
results in decreased retention time. When analysis time
extends beyond 15 minutes, column temperature should
be increased accordingly. T

ers to gain useful thermodynamic data such as heat ef-

PROGRAMMING THE 650

An electronic d-a'ta-processing machine, t-he IBM
650 Digit Compute-r, can not only perform advanced
calcu-luls, but also second grade addition, su-‘bstraction,
multiplication, and division. Performing basic arith-
metic with almost unbelievable speed and accuracy, the

computer ca-n add two ten-digit numbers i-n less than
0.0005 seconds. Like a human being the machine has
a memory. The computer has within i-t a revolving
drum on which information can be magnetically record-
ed and “played back,” much as on a tape recorder. To
operate the electronic wonder, a coded: system is used.
The machine receives its instructions in the form

of a ten-d-igit number with a sign. These instructions

are stored on the drum previous to starting the p-ro-

tblem.,When p-laced in operation the computer refers to
the drum for its instructions a-nd performs them one
after another at very high speeds. The instruction num-
number is subdivided by the computer in-to three sep-
arate numbers. The ﬁrst two digits act as a code which
tells the computer what to do. Specifying the address
of the data with which the computer is to work is the
job of the next -four digits. The last four digits specify
the address to which the computer is t-o refer for its
next instruction. The sign of the instru-ction is ignored
in the usual problem. Another ten-digi-t number in-
struction will cause the machine to perform the next
operation and then refer to a t-h-ird address for the next
instruction.

Thus a program of instructions for solving a p-rob-
lem, whether long or short, can be given to t-he com-
puter, and the operations will be performed one by one
until the ﬁnal answer is reached. Programming, as pre-
paring these ins-tructions is called, is not a difficult
game, but it is one which has many rules. To under-
stand programming, however, a knowledge of the me-
chanical operations of the com-p-uter must be possessed.

The 650 computer is composed of six basic de-
vices; a drum, a read unit, -a_ punch un-it, entry switch-
es, a distributor, and an accumulator. The drum is a
storage area of 2000 cells with addresses ranging -from
0000 to 1999. Whenever a number is -stored in a cell,
the previous contents of the cell are automatically
erased. When a number is read out of a cell, the con-
tents of the cell remain unaltered. In-formation can

enter the drum only from the distributor or the read
unit.

The distributor is a temporary storage device that
will hold a single ten-digit number with a sign. Because
of the location of the distributor, information which is
passed between the drum and the accumulator must
enter the distributor, replacing the previous contents.

All arithmetical operations are performed in the
accumulator. It is divided into two sections, upper ac-
cumulator and lower accumulator. Each half will add
and subtract independently of the other except that car-
ries from the lower accumulator will be added into the
upper accumulator and change of sign in the upper
will complement the lower. The entire accumulator has
one common sign, which will be the result of the last
operation performed. Multiplication and division em-
ploy both halves of the accumulator as one unit.

On the console of the computer are the entry
switches, a set of switches from which a single ten-digit
number with a sign can be entered into the machine.
Until eh-anvged by the operator the number remains in
the switches and cannot be altered by the computer
itself.

Almost all information which enters or leaves the
computer does so through the read unit and punch
unit in the form of punched cards. Information can be
entered manually through the entry switches and can
be read out through li-ghts on the console of the comput-
er, but this method is slow and awkward. A punched
card is divided into eighty columns, each of which can
contain a single digit from zero through nine. Over a
number in a particular column a hole is punched in

OCTOBER

the card to specify a particular digit. It is possible for
eight ten-digit numbers with their respective signs to
enter or leave the computer on one card. The ﬁrst
word is placed in columns one through ten, the second
in columns eleven through twenty, etc. Placed above
the right hand digit of the word is another punch
which is the sign of each word. The machine will not
confuse the issue of two punches in one column, but
will read each as a separate piece of information. For

An instruction card for use in an IBM machine. Third vilordiis 0001600276.

example, the third word in the card shown is
0001600276.

The read unit reads the punches on a punched card
directly into storage on the drum. There are only cer-
tain cells, however, into which cards can be read.

These are:

0001 to 0010
0051 to 0060
0101 to 01 10
015 1 to 0160
and down ‘through
1951 to 1960

Reading the rﬁrst word int-o cell XXXI (XXX -refers to
a-ny one of the read bands speciﬁed above), the second
word into cell XXX2, the third word into cell XXX3,
etc. is done by the -Standard 650 Wiring Board. Cells
XXX9 a-nd XX10 a-re automatically ﬁlled in with zeros.
If a column on a "card is l-eft blank, a blank will be
entered in the corresponding digit in the cell, n-ot a
zero.

The punch unit will punch the contents of certain
punch cells on the output cards. They are:

0027 to 0034
0077 to 0084
0127 to 0134
0177 to 0184
and d-own through
1977 to 1984

Con-tents of cell XXX7 will be punched in columns
one through ten, with the sign in column ten, while
-contents of cell XXX8 will -be puvnzched i-n columns
-eleven th-ro-ugh t-wen-ty with the sign in column twenty.
Neither the read unit nor the punch unit can be ad-
dressed; however, the reading and punching of cards
-can be acco-mplished iby mean-s of operation codes.

The IBM 650 computer does not «take decimal
points into account. Shift operations are used to align
the data so that correct arithmetic can be done. As the
punoh-ed card also shows no decimval point, the coun-
pu-ter operator must specify the locat-ion of the decimal

"You would need a computer to ﬁgure out how many
phases of engineering and science go into the making
of one type of airplane or missile. Aerodynamics, ther-

uncovered so many areas for further study that young
men are urgently needed to solve these problems. Long
a pioneer in new facets of aviation, Northrop is one of
the companies that wants such aggressive young men.

At Northrop you can put your training to work on
the Snark SM-62, the world's first intercontinental
guided missile. And new projects like the twin jet,
supersonic trainer, the USAF-Northrop T-38, and
others of top priority are moving ahead steadily.

Products are only as good as the engineers behind
them and good engineers require good surroundings.
In line with this thinking, Northrop has built a multi-

The Dean, E & M Cabinet, and the faculty consider

A NEW PROGRAM F OR

-or the past four years Pitt engineers have honor-
ed St. Patrick during Engineers’ Week. Coupling at
effective high school open house with a strong social
program, Engineers’ Week has become one of the most
successful -celebrations hel-d at Pitt. After this p-ast
year’s observance, however, many students an-d faculty
‘members realized that the week needed an evaluation to
strengthen its tradition-s.

Dean Fitterer began this evaluation d-uring this
past spring. He drew up plans for changes in the Week
—changes designed ‘to make the week of greater value
to the University. So that immediate action could -be
taken to_ adopt these plans or initiate new proposals for
changes in the Week, Dean Fitterer called two special
meetings of the Engineering and Mines Cabinet during
this past summer. '

At t-he ﬁrst meeting, Dean Fitterer explained to
the group the major disadvantages of ‘Engineers’ Week
and the Saint Patrick tradition. According to him, En-
gineers’ Week occurs so early in the spring semester
that it interferes with serious study. Also, a carnival
spirit develops and the original idea of the week is lost.
The Dean! stated that the overall theme of Saint Patrick
has become common. ’

A new theme featuring Leonardo da Vinci was‘
suggested by Dean Fitterer and presented to ‘Cabinet
in-a detailed re-port. Several facets of the program were
the replacement of departmental dis-plays by individual
-projects, the widening of the so-cial and athletic pro-
gram through year-long competition, and a moderation
of the carnival spirit.

Following t-he Dean’s proposal, the Cabinet mem-
bers delved into the various aspects of an overall revi-
-sion of the Week. It soon became apparent that mem-
bers were either in -favor of retaining Saint Patrick or
adopting daVinci’as a symbol for -the week. A compro-
mise between proponents of the da Vinci and Saint
Patrick relationship was suggested. I:t permitted re-
taining of the carnival nature of Saint Patrick and al-
lowed the academic influence of da Vinci to dominate
the week by having Saint Patrick honor da Vinci

4!4 '

throughout Engineers’ Week. I-t was deﬁnitely decided
by Cabinet at the second meeting that the overall idea
for this coming Engineers’ Week will be the honoring
of ‘Leonardo da. Vinci by Saint Patrick.

-Other major points discussed at both meetings
were the length of the engineering celebration and the
time it should be held. The question was whethe-r En-
gineers’ Week should coincide with National Engin-
eers’ Week in February or with Saint Pa-trick’s Day in
March and over what period of time the week should
be spread to relieve the pressure of lost classroom time.
At the second meeting Caibinet voted to allow Engin--
eers’ Week to ‘be held over a maximum of three weeks
with the third week coinciding with Saint Pat’s Day.
The‘ ‘Central Planning Committee will determine the
actual length of the week, the n-umber of events, and
the program for the week.

Major changes were also made in -the make-up of
the Central Planning -Committee. Cabinet decided that
a faculty advisor should be appointed to the Committee
to give it more stalbility. The chairman of the ‘Central
Planning Committee will be selected as in previous
years; Cabinet would make the selectionfrom applica-
tions. All committee members must also apply for

positions. These members will -be selected by the chair-

man., |

Dean Fitterer
proposes . . .

Dr. G. R. Fitterer

The -institution of St. Pats Week has drawn our students and faculty to-
gether in a manner‘ which does not exist elsewhere on this campus or in many en-
gineering schools. I am happy to say that this -affair -has :been conducted by our
students with considerable rest'raint and dignity. The somewhat baseless nature
of _the tradition, however, tends to develop a carnival spirit which may ultimate-
ly ‘lead to some unh-appy e-vents.

I suggest, therefore, that we institute a new t-radition in the «honoring of
Leonardo da Vinci as the ﬁrst engineer. This great, Italian was a painter, sculptor,
architect, musician, mechaunfician, natural philospher, and engineer. A review of
his life reveals -that like many engineers he reduced various ants to sc-iences.

Many people who are unfamiliar with the engineering profession glibly
state that engineering -is simply applied science without the realization that there
are engineering sciences which are just as “-pure” as the so-called “pure” sciences.
Many of the engineering sciences originated from the arts and da Vinci was prob-
ably the ﬁrst real link between the arts and the -engineering sciences.

I suggest that if we s'hould change to the celebration o-f da Vi-nci, that some
of the aspects of the week be changed as follows:

1. E~m.p‘h-asis should be placed on the individual. Individuals could ‘volunteer

and develop an exhibit or project which could be started at any ti-me as -desired.

by the individual, even a year in advance.
2. Each department should give an individual prize which would represent

.the departmental student--faculty opinion, that it best depicts the reduction of

an art or engineering science into an engineering principle appl-icalble to that
department.

3. The students in each depantment would also prepare one project which
best illustrates the departvme-n.tal «ﬁeld. A first, second, and third prize should be
added to the score -for the intra-departmenutal award. ‘Otherwise, as «many of the
regular laboratories‘ .should be left in normal operating condition for the ‘tour.

‘ The above changes in Engineers’ Week are just a few of my ideas for a da
Vin-ci Week. I am sure that these suggestions will create many new ideas. This
program would be unique and might spread to other colleges.

E & M Cabinet,

Dr. E. B. Stuart

OCTOBER

 

Dean Fitterer suggests that we honor Leonardo da Vinci during the forth-
coming Engineers’ Week. This idea is excellent in the respect that it reveres a man
known for his free flow of inventive idea's.

Perhaps if the individual displays were based on the theme “'Da Vinci’s
Ideas If He Were Here Today,” they would allow some of the students to ﬂex

By promoting new ideas without restrict-ions on their technical complete-

excellent in the future. V

We could still have some activities in which we can show others that engin-
eers are adept in the arts, athletics, and -the social graces. These -affairs are a
means of comm-unnication which are supposed to tell the public about engineering
at Pitt. In past years the week has been a bit misguided here because these sec-
ondary affairs were used just to let down our social hair so to speak. At these
secondary functions we relaxed our social inhizbitions.

‘I think that if we are to have an Engineers’ Week at all, we should
emphasize the ingenious part of the Week. We should keep our social inhibitions
in their proper place, and we should release the technical -inh-ibitions.

WHAT IS HIGH FIDELITY?

BY FRED M. HORN, EE ‘59

Hi-Fi, a new catch phrase, has swept the nation!
There are Hi-Fi lipsticks an-d Hi-Fi paints; everything
from electronics to cosmetics has made use of this
phrase. Hi-Fi and high ﬁdelity are no longer synono-
mous terms. The former, a misused abbreviation, has
become a commercial fad. The latter literally means
faithfulness. In audio, high ﬁdelity is the ultimate re-
production o-f sound in such a manner as to give the
closest proximity to the actual source.

By its very n-ature sound has various qualities
which are audible to the human ear. In its reproduction
we must retain the wide dynamic range of the source.
Basically this means the precise reclamation of the
most subdued hush to the most powerful passage of the
orchestra. Wide frequency range, from the deepest
bass to the shrillest treble, is vital for high ﬁdelity. For
reamlism sound must have presence-—a feeling that the
source is nearby and not behind a closed door. Fine
deﬁnition is essential—the sounds of the instruments
must remain true to themselves.

To achieve this purpose much work has been done

Gaining popularity as a recording medium is tape recording.
Recorders such as this provide a stereophonic playback.

48

You know that high fidelity

means better sound. But how

is this new sound reproduced?

in the past decade to improve high ﬁdelity reproduc-
tion. Advances in new an-d more modern recording tech-
niques and equipment are being made annually. To-
day’s high ﬁdelity ampliﬁer has reached near perfection.
Tremendous strides have been made to improve the
tape recorder. Binaural and stereophonic sound techni-
ques have opened new vistas of home entertainment.

To understand the value of high ﬁdelity a know-
ledge of present recording methods is needed. In use
today are two major methods of recording, disc and
tape. Both are relatively complex in nature. The most
familiar of the recording methods is that of sound re-
production by discs or records.

On disc recordings, as sound passes into a micro-
phone, the sound waves are transformed into tiny pul-
sations of electric current. These pulses of electric cur-
rent, however, are entirely too weak to drive a record-
ing stylus (needle). They must, therefore, ﬁrst pass
through an ampliﬁer. After ampliﬁcation the signal is
then fed to the recording cartridge where the electrical
impulses are converted into mechanical vibrations
which cut grooves into a disc.

Because low frequencies require more power, their
electrical impulses are greater. When the mechanical
vibrations drive the stylus, it moves a maximum dis-
tance for bass frequencies. For this reason the frequen-
cies at the low end of the audible spectrum will cause
such a wide deflection of the stylus that it may overcut
into the next groove. To prevent ths overcutting, the
low frequency output of -the ampliﬁer is attenuated
before it is fed to the cartridge. On the other hand, im-
pulses of high frequencies cause so little deﬁection that
a cut is scarcely made into the disc. To correct this
problem the ampliﬁer output is boosted before its en-
trance to the cartridge.

The frequency at which the bass notes taper off is
called the turnover frequency and that of the treble,
the roll-oﬂ‘ frequency. Each manufacturer formerly
set his own value for the turnover and roll-off points.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

These variations in recording characterictics caused
many complications when the ﬁnal record was played
back. In the last fe-w years, however, most manufac-
turers have adopted deﬁnite standards for the roll-off
and turnover frequencies.

Tape ‘recording is -t'he second major form of record-
ing techniques. It is now going through a period of
remarkable irrnprovemenzts in ﬁdelity and performance.

The recording tape in use today is a quarter-inch
cellulose acetate ribbon coated on one -side with red iron
oxide. The tape recorder uvtilizing th-is ribbon consists
of an electronic section and a mechanical section. The
function of the electronic section is to amplify and
alter, to a desired degree, the signal fed to it. Output
signals from the electronic section are sent to the elec-
tro-magnetic recording head which contacts the tape.
Since the mechanical section of the machine is moving
the tape past this head at a constant rate of speed,
d-ifferen-t sections of the tape become magnetized to
varying degrees. This function of the ma-chine is term-
ed recording.

In playing back the tape the machine is again
-moving the tape at the same constant rate of s-peed, but
now the -recorded magnetic ﬂuc-tua-tions of t-he tape are
affecting what is -termed the pilayback head. The func-
tion of .this he-ad is to transform the magnetic variation-s
on the tape into minute electrical impulses. These im-
p-ulses are then sent to a second section of the electronic
assembly where they are ampliﬁed.

In addition to being used in the home for 
ﬁdelity purposes, tape recording is almost unanimously
accepted as the initial recording medium for the pro-
duction of commercial -phonograph record-s.

When -the studio-erc-orded, high ﬁdelity disc are
played back, the equipment used must be able to repro-
-du-ce the same so-unds that ﬁlled the discs. New equip-
ment has been developed for this expert reproduction.
The rep-roduc-tion chain is surprisingly similar to the
record-ing process. The recorded signal must ﬁxrst be

changed from mechanic-al energy into electrical energy.
In a phonograph this is accomplished by means of a
turntable and a pickup.

Principally the pickup consists of a stylus, cart-
ridge, and a tone arm. There are three main types of
styli used in ‘high ﬁdelity systems: osmium ,sapphire, and
diamond. While osmium will last app-roxi-mately eight
hours and sapphire will las-t ﬁfty, the diamond gives the
best performance, la-sting ﬁve hundred hours. The move-
ment of the stylus against the crystal cartridge gener-
ates a small voltage. The crystal -cartridge has a limited
frequency response, however, and -is already affected
by changes in temperature. Ceramic cartridges,‘ on the
other hand, are unaffected by ch-anges in temperature
and have a wider frequency range. P-robalbnly the most
used in -high ﬁdelity systems are magnetic cartridges
whihoperate by «the motion of a coil in a magnetic field.
By its very nature the magnetic -cartridge requires play-
back compensation whereas the crystal and ceramic
types are internally compensated. The cartridge is led

The various combinations of basic components of a system

are dependent on individual ta-ste and intended installations.

0.5%. Its amplification range is 20-20,000 cps.

This loudspeaker is a concentrically-mounted woofer-

types are internally compensated. The cartridge is led
across the disc by the tone ar-rn.

Turn-tavbles are available in many sizes and speeds.
Their operations differ considera-bly. Although the
changer type offers continruou". playing, the manual
type‘ provides better ﬁdelity results and exerts less wear
on the records. Turntable selection should sui-t the in-
dividu'a'l’s taste and needs.

T-he recorded sources, be they tape or disc, b-asi-
cally go through similar stages of reproduction. The
source signal is very weak, and it must be electronically

amplirﬁed so it will have adequate power to drive a.

loudspeaker. There are several ways to accomp-lish this.
If the signal originates from a magnetic cartridge, it
mustﬁrszt be preampliiﬁed since this cartridge delivers
.001 to\.01 volts, which is not sufficient to drive most
power ampliﬁers. Of extreme importance is «the need
to m-atch the impedance rating of the preamp with
the rating of the source output.’ That is, a phono pick-
up arm with 4000 ohm impedance must be connected
to a 4000 ohm -termianail on the prearrnrp-liﬁer. Otherwise
distortion will result, and the preamp will be over-driv-
en. The preamp basically employs the following con-
trols: volume control, separate bass and treble con-trols,
input selector. ' '

After perampliﬁcation the signal next moves to the
power ampliﬁer. Ampliﬁers range in power from ﬁve

to 100 watts, with twenty watts being most common.’

‘Distortion is inherent in all amipliﬁers, but if high ﬁdel-
ity is to be maintained the distortionmust -be minimiz-
ed. For this reason distortion should not exceed three
percent. T-he frequency response should be linear from
twenty to 20,000 cycles per second. Hum should be
inaudible.

Now that the signal has been pre-ampliﬁed, com-
pensated, and ampliﬁed, it is now ready to go to the
loudspeaker where the signal is converted into audible
sound waves. Since the most important feature of a
loudspeaker is its ability to reproduce sound n-aturally
and clearly without col-oration, certain requirements
have been established to which a speaker must conform.
At present speakers a-re not as reﬁned as arnpl-iﬁers
and their response curves show aecenituation and at-
tenuation of different frequencies.’ Just as impor-tan-t is
the clearness of sound reproduction. This clea-mess
depends largely on the distortion introduced by the
speaker when it is overloaded. A loudspeaker has a cer-
tain power capacity. When the power supplied exceeds
-this limit, distortion is created. S-peakersare rated with
a normal impedance which should ‘be properly match-
ed with the outp-ut transformer on the ampliﬁer. This
is similar to the matching of “the source with its amplify-
ing unit.

The ideal speaker would be an exponential (ﬂare-
shaped) horn which has a relat-ively smooth frequency
response and high efficiency. This type of speaker,
however, -must increase greatly in size to reproduce the
bass frequencies. These speakers, known as -tweeters,
are mainly used -for high frequency horns. The ordin-

SKYSGRAPER ENGINEER

ary cone-type speaker, used to reproduce the lower
frequencies, are effective bunt not efficient. These are
sometimes called woofers. Twelve and ﬁfteen inch
speakers are used primarily -for this purpose. Ex-tended
range speakers are simply woofers which have t-he
center part of the cone hardened to emit higher fre-
quencies. Their response is usually li-rnited, covering
from ﬁfty to 13,000 cycles per second. Mounted con-
centrically, a coaxial speaker, a woofer, and a tnweeiter
widen the frequency ran-ge con»side.raibly. This combi-
nation g-ives ‘better results because the woofer is re-
quired to reproduce only the -lower frequencies while
the tweeter reproduces only the treble. A high pass
‘ﬁlter eliminates ‘the frequencies directed to the tweet-
er Ibelow speciﬁed limits, for a tweeter must not be re-
quired to reproduce frequencies «below the poin-t where
its efficien-cy ifa:lls off.

All of these loudspeakers have the featuure of point
source sound, not eviden.t in ‘three or four way sys-
tems which uti-lize a separate speaker in a different
place for each range. Each speaker handles a s-pec-izﬁc
audio range. This is accomplished by a c»ros~so_ver net-
work -which separates the frequencies and sends them
to different speakers.

A speaker’s ba-ss response is extended with a proper
enclosure. Since the function of an ‘enclosureis to con-
trol the ;bass response -of the loudspeaker, one of proper
design with a particular speaker will extend that speak-
er’s frequency from ﬁfty to vtwen-ty--ﬁve cycles per sec-
ond-—a substantial increase in range. An eight-inch
speaker, properly enclosed, will out-perform a ﬁfteen-
inch speaker improperly enclosed. Most enclosures
work on the principle of using the rear bass waves to
reinforce -the front bass waves. This is accom'plis’hed
by many different enclosure designs including «bass re-
ﬂex, Karlson, folded horn, accoustical labyrinth, air
coupler, and others. The common method is «to h-ave the
-bass sound waves travel a path which delays them in-
side the enclosure long enough to bring t=hem forward

TALLEST HEAT TREATING FURNACE

The nation’s tallest heat treating -furnace, higher
than a 10-story building, is in operation at the Harvey
Aluminum plant in Torrance, California.

'One hundred an dten feet high and seven feet in
diameter, the vertical electric furnace was designed
and constructed by the industrial heating division of
Westinghouse Electric Corporation to heat treat ex-
truded aluminum alloy shapes. The furnace provides
con-trolled temperatures to multiply several times the
strength of precision aluminum for -aircraft, construc-
tion, ‘and other uses.

Aluminum pieces -up to 80 fee-t long are suspend-
ed in the furnace and heat treated at temperatures
up through 800 degrees Fahrenheit. At t'he end of the
heating cycle, a door at bottom of the furnace is open-
ed and the aluminum parts are plunged into an under-
ground quenching tank 110 feet deep and 18 feet in
diameter. After a ‘ﬁnishing process called “stretching,”
-the aluminum is ready for shipment to customers.

At Harvey Aluminum’s California plant is the nation's
tallest heat treating ‘furnace. It stands’ 110 feet high.

This simplified symbolic diagram illustrates the operation
of a carrier-current receiver.

system is particularly suited -for use with receivers
equipped with power tuning and electronic automatic
ﬁne tuning.

Carrier current has several advantages as a signal «

transmitting medium: the power required to operate
the transmitter is easily sunppliied by plugging into any-
115-volnt a-c convenience outlet, and a path for the
carrier-current signal is simultaneously provided. This
direct path for the signal -results in relatively low at-
tenuation, so that a low-power transmitter and relative-

The two functions of the -control system, channel
selection an-d ‘sound muting, are accomplished with two
types of carrier signals. A continuous wave of the re-
quired -duration activates both the channel-selecting re-

lay andrthe sound-muting relay so that the television
receiver can be turned through program channels wi-th-

out sound ‘blasting (picture muting is also provided to
prevent annoying ﬂashes). A modulated wave ac-tivates
only the sound-mu-ting relay.

The vie-wer selects channels, or mutes sound by
moving a two-position switch to either the “select”
or “mute” position. When the select switch is moved
to the “select” position, a d-c voltage is ap-pl-ied to the
oscillator plate circuit and the continuous wave signal
is produced; when the switch is in the “mute” position,
60-cyc-le voltage is applied to the os.cillator and the
modulated carrier signals results. The switch will latch
in t-he “mute” position to provide continuous muting.

RUBBER BRIDGE BEARINGS

Until the advent of a. ne wnatural rubber ?bearing
that has just ‘been introduced‘ in England, bridge en-
ggineers were restricted to. the traditional nests of rollers
or sliding plates for bridge ex-p-ansion bearings. The
problem with these was maintenance. Rollers tend to
wear ﬂat after a period of time, and both rollers and
pl-ates are subject to rust. Now ‘a new nautral ru=bber
"bearing fulﬁlls all requirements of longitudinal move-n
ment, -with the added beneﬁt of long life with no main-
-tenance whatsoever.

Bea-rings are~now available wi-th nominal capacities
of 50 and 100 rton-s. In appearance, the bearings are
merely large blocks of rubber. Actually, however, the
rubber is in-terlayered with steel plates. These -plates
have a minimum cover of M inch of natural rubber
about their edges and are therefore unaffected by the
elements.

The shear ratings of the -bearings are the same in
any direction in the horizontal plane. The compression
rating of the two be-arin-gs is such that for most bridge
work the bearing can be regarded as a pinned suapnport.

Bearings with greater capacity and different pro-
perties are now being developed. Work is being p'ar-t.i-
cularly concentrated ‘on be-arin-gs with vee’d plates
which provide! lateral stiffness with the same longitudin-
al rating and also with domed -bearings which ‘have
high lateral stiffness in all directions but low rotation-al
stiffness.

SR-4 LOAD CELL

The accurate weighing of detergent slurries is
essential to the ultimate household detergent. The de-
tergents, which contain a deﬁnite combination of foam-
ing agents and foaming stabilizers, must be weighed
to an accuracy of 0.02% to produce a standard cleans-
ing and foaming quality. To weigh a batch .«as large
as 27,000 pounds of this precise degree, B. T. Babit Inc.
uses a Baldwin SR-4 load cell weigliing system.

The Baldwin S\R-4 load cell is a simple, effective
and accurate unit. There are no moving parts, and -the
device is completely enclosed. T-he core of the unit is
an SR-4 bonded wire st-rain gage. A matched set of

four gages is bonded to a high strength steel column
_machined to close tolerances. The four gages are con-
nected electri-cally in the form of a Wheatstone bridge,
initially balanced. Temperature compensating resistors
a-re added to the circuit to maintain t-he accuracy of the
bridge over a -wide range of temperatures.

Any weight placed on the steel column distorts the
column and the S'R-4 strain gages bonded to it and
creates a change in resistance which unbalances the
circuit. The resulting variation in -the voltage output is
immediately interpreted by the dial indicator.

EVAPOROGRAPH

Blast furnaces, open hearths, coke ovens, and other
steelmaking facilities appear in all the colors of the
rainbow through the lenses of an “evaporograph,” a
new type of camera now in use for the ﬁrst time in the
steel industry at U. S. Steel’s F airless Works in Fair-
less Hills, Pennsylvania.

Developed by Baird-Atomic, Incorporated, Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, as a direct thermal-imaging de-
vice, the new instrument functions as efficiently in ab-
solute darkness as in daylight, requiring no source of
external illumination. Instead, it forms a colored, two-
dimensional image by ‘utilizing the long-wavelength, in-
frared radiation emitted from the object or area being
photographed. The image is made visible by a light
source inside the instrument. Sensitivity of the device is
such that differences of as little as one-degree Centi-
grade can be detected in the target temperatures. It
will function so long as the target temperature is above
absolute zero and there is a temperature difference
existent in the ﬁeld of view. Objects as distant as three
miles or more will register accurately in the evaporo-
graph.

Test observations and color photographs made
with the instrument throughout the mill area have
shown that temperature differences on the exterior
surface of high-temperature operating units make pos-
sible the study of interior wall conditions in such in-
stallations as open hearths and blast furnaces. Thus,
the evaporograph answers a long-time need of opera-
tion and maintenance departments in steel mills. It
shows promise also as a detector of hot-spots or worn
areas in machinery, steam lines, and other auxiliary
mill equipment where temperature is a measure of in-
terior conditions.

A technician focuses an Evaporagraph on a roll of a cold-
reduction mill to study the condition of bearings.

National Supply products are extensively used in offshore drilling for oil. Here, one of our

large drilling rigs is working on the first floating platform for offshore drilling in the Pacific.

IN A CHALLENGING, FAST-MOVING BUSINESS . . .

an unusual training program for just 25 exceptional men

' National Supply is a complex company.

Ten thousand employees, six plants mak-
ing products for the oil ﬁelds and general
industry, a network of 129 stores on two
continents, a world-wide business.

It is a fast-moving company. In the
oil ﬁelds, our main market, emergencies
happen, and when they do they’re big.
We have to be ready to meet them over-
night——and we have done it many times.

It is a fast growing company. We are
branching out into new ﬁelds.

It is a decentralized company. That
means more opportunities for young
men to gain responsibilities faster.

We have young men managing
million-dollar-volume stores—acting as
combination salesmen-diplomats in for-

eign countries—helping to design ma-
chines worth a quarter of a million
dollars——young men in positions of re-
sponsibility throughout the company.

This means we need good young men.
So we have a 9-month training program
designed to attract them. It is limited to
25 men. For six months it takes the man
to all of our plants from Pennsylvania to
California. For two months it puts him
in the oil ﬁelds. It brings him to head-
quarters for a month, to meet and work
with top management.

The selection of the man’s job is made
after the program is completed. We try
to assign him to the job and location he
wants. It is costly, but it gets results—to
judge by the steady progress in the

company that our trainees have made.
Think you might qualify? Ask the
Placement Officer to arrange an inter-
view for you when the National Supply

START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW

By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock& Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.

Here’s an indication of what's going on at B&W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world’s
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the ABC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world’s first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.-

These are but a few of the projects-—not in the plan-
mng stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.

How is the company doing right now? Let's look at one
line. from the Annual Stockholders’ Report.

Why Vought Projects

Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer

At Vought, the engineer doesn’t often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it’s no wonder

For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record—breaking Crusader
ﬁghter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
mph ﬁghter, details of which are still
classiﬁed.

The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.

Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:

electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation

investigation of advanced propulsion
methods

Mach 5 conﬁgurations

Vought’s excellent R&D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new ﬁelds
while advancing in his own.

ONE OF A SERIES

The propulsion

During the Vought Crusader’s N.A.A. record-
breaking ﬂight across the continent, fuel management
was a vital factor. But it wasn’t the constant worry it
might have been. Fred Alvis had seen to that, beginning
four years ago.

When the Crusader project was formed, Fred was
just a few years out of Alabama Poly. His was still a
new face. Mighty new, Fred would have agreed when
he was tapped to develop the functional design of the
Crusader fuel system.

Navy specs told Fred his system should be reliable
and very lightweight. Pilots, too, gave him a special
request. In the ready room near the ﬂight line they
described the constant in-ﬂight attention required by
complex fuel systems. “Can you ﬁx it so we can forget
fuel for a minute?” they asked the young designer. “Can
you cut down on those switches?”

Fred went all-out for simplicity, plunging into a
three-month whirl of schematics. He was encouraged by
close design group assistance in studies and layouts.
Soon he was making procurement selections and writing
functional reports. Then, with the fuel system mockup,
Fred unveiled what he’d done.

It was a showpiece of simplicity. Absent was the
usual complex CG control system. Fred had bypassed

engineer who
was allergic to switches

the problem entirely by canny choosing of fuel cell loca-
tions and fuel line sizings. Absent, too, was an emergency
system-——together with the need for it! There was a
unique air transfer system for moving fuel from the
Crusader wing tank to the main sump, plus some freshly
conceived lesser features.

As mockup and ﬂight tests proved, Fred’s ideas
more than met weight and reliability requirements. And,’
as pilots were shown, all simpliﬁcation features led
directly to the cockpit. There Fred had won his war
against switches.

Only one had survived.

At Vought, the invitation to find a fresh
approach is extended to every engineer. ‘:4?
Here, in groups that coordinate for 3 th
mutual progress, and in test facilities -,3
that can evaluate the most advanced pro- :9
posals, ideas receive the attention they
deserve.

"The story of Honeywell, as I know it, is a story of
growth—from a thermostat to over 12,000 products;
from a handful of employees to more than 30,000;
from a basementpin Minneapolis to a world-wide
organization. For Honeywell, world leader in auto-
matic controls, has expanded as rapidly as this excit-
ing ﬁeld. And employment, sales and income have
increased steadily year after year.

"The future is even more challenging. Planned .
diversiﬁcation puts Honeywell in suchunew ﬁelds as I
office and factory automation, process control, plas-

tics, atomic energy, electronics, missiles and satel-

lites. Whole new areas of opportunity are waiting

for today's engineering graduates in each of Honey-

well’s divisions. Here are some division representa- i
tives to tell you about them."

and engineers conduct basic research
into areas such as Heat Transfer, Met-
allurgy, Thermodynamics, Solar En-
ergy, Radioactivity, Electronics, etc.
This research supplements other re-
search carried on by Honeywell's sep-

Q How to lick

a mixing
problem

N designing the bearing
mounting for the drum axle
of this heavy-duty mixer, the
engineers had to consider the
punishing radial and thrust
loads as the drum rotates at an ;
angle. And heavy shock loads L,  . .   ..
from the impact of driving on
rough roads had to be con-
sidered, too. To handle these
loads simultaneously, keep
the drum shaft aligned, the
engineers speciﬁed Timken®
tapered roller bearings. Result
—free rolling, longer life, less
maintenance.

Tapered design lets Timken® bearings take both radial
and thrust loads

  
  
   
   
  
   
 

The taper enables Timken bearings to take radial and thrust
loads in any combination. And full line contact between
their rollers and races gives Timken bearings extra capacity
for the_ toughest loads.

Six Years in Review
Sir:

At the beginning of your seventh
year of publication, you and the
staff are continuing work honorably

begun and well-carried out since
1950.

It is with a great deal of pleasure .

that I remember my associations
with past staffs, and I confess that
i-t seems no time at all since Lou
Swickley, Jim Robinson, Bill Zeha-
la, and all their friends were laying
the groundwork for the magazine.
With all the problems which our
current staffs face, I still believe
that the ﬁrst staff probably had
more troubles than the others. They
had to do a real selling job with
Dean Fitterer and the Publications
Board before they could start publi-
cation. The ﬁrst issue was a real tri-
umph. _
By the time Gene Cowie, Bill
Vogt and Art Hershkowitz were
ready to take over, the initial trials
were over, but those editors made
constant improvements in the mag-
azine. Jim Fallon and Paul Weiner
made a good working team, and in
the year that followed, Bill Rimrnel,

Nick Sirianni, and Paul Thomas

carried through the traditions of
their predecessors. Sirianni made
the change successfully from the
business staff to the editorial chair,
and Don Rooney handled the books
in 1955-56.

Last year the magazine grew in
size and scope under the direction
of Mitch Kozikowski and Rich Jack-

son, and now, under the present
staff, new plans for expansion are
being made.
Please accept my best wishes for
a successful year.

tions.

Congratulations
Sir:

I am happy that you have started
a “Letters to the Editor” column
because this allows me the oppor-
tunity to congratulate you, your
staff, and all previous editorial staffs
on the beginning of the seventh year
of publication.

Those of us who sat in on the
ﬁrst meetings of the ﬁrst staff, and
who have seen the SKYSCRAPER
grow to its present status as one
of the very best engineering maga-
zines in the country, are proud that

 

we have been associated with such
accomplished young men. The ex-
cellent job being done in this publi-
cation is an indication of what can
be expected of our engineering grad-
uates in the future.
Congratulations!

Sex-Cease
Sir:

I’m not an engineer, but I feel
sufficiently sympathetic with their

' plight to write this letter. The parti-

cular plight I’m speaking of is the
SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.

Engineering text-books are, in the
main, dry, unenthusiastic, and re-
dundant. So is your cartoon section.
Most of your so-called “jokes” re-
volve about a highly interesting sub-
ject, sex, and manage to make of it
a very dull subject. Sex is only one
of many ﬁelds of human ( and ani-
mal) endeavor, and cannot for long
make anything humorous. This in-
cludes your magazine. Why not look
around?

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

The United States is now doubling its use
of electrical energy every eight years.
In order to maintain its position as the
leading manufacturer in this fast-growing
electrical industry, General Electric is
vitally interested in the development of
young engineers. Here, Mr. Lewis answers
some questions concerning your personal
development.

G. Mr. Lewis, do you think, on entering
industry, it's best to specialize immedi-
ately, or get broad experience first?

A. Let me give you somewhat of a
double-barreled answer. We at Gen-
eral Electric think it’s best to get
broad experience in a specialized
ﬁeld. By that, I mean our training
programs allow you to select the
special kind of work which meets
your interests—manufacturing, en-
gineering, or technical marketing—
and then rotate assignments to give
you broad experience within that
area.

Q. Are training assignments of a pre-
determined length and type or does the
individual have some influence in deter-
mining them?

A. Training programs, by virtue of
being programs, have outlined as-
signments but still provide real op-
portunities for self-development. We
try our best to tailor assignments to
the individual’s desires and demon-
strated abilities.

Q. Do you mean, then, that I could iust
stay on a iob if I like it?

A. That’s right. Our programs are
both to train you and help you ﬁnd
your place. If you ﬁnd it somewhere
along the way, to your satisfaction
and ours, ﬁne.

Interview with General Electric’s

Frank T. Lewis

Mgr., Manufacturing Personnel Development

The Next Four Years:
Your Most Important

Q. What types of study courses are in-
cluded in the training programs and
when are the courses taken?

A. Each of our programs has
graduate—level courses conducted by
experienced G-E engineers. These
courses supplement your college
training and tie it in with required
industrial techniques. Some are
taken on Company time, some on
your own.

0. What kind of help do you offer em-
ployees in getting graduate schooling?

A. G.E.’s two principal programs
of graduate study aid are the Honors
Program and the Tuition Refund
Program. If accepted on the Honors
Program you can obtain a mas-
ter’s degree, tuition free, in 18 months
while earning up to 75% of full-time
salary. The Tuition Refund Program
offers you up to 100% refund of
tuition and related fees when you
complete graduate courses approved
by your department manager. These
courses are taken outside normal
working hours and must be related
to your ﬁeld of work.

Q. What are the benefits of ioining a
company first, then going into military
service if necessary.

A. We work it this way. If you are
hired and are only with the Company
a week before reporting to military
service, you are considered to be
performing continuous service while
you are away and you will have your
job when you return. In determining
your starting salary again, due con-
sideration is given experience you’ve

gained and changes in salary struct-
ure made in your absence. In addi-
tion, you accrue pension and paid-
vacation rights.

Q. Do you advise getting a professional
engineer's license?What's itworth to me?

A. There are only a few cases where
a license is required at G.E., but
we certainly encourage all engineers
to strive for one. At present, nearly
a quarter of our engineers are li-
censed and the percentage is con-
stantly increasing. What’s it worth?
A license gives you professional
status and the recognition and pres-
tige that go with it. You may ﬁnd,
in years to come, that a license will
be required in more and more in-
stances. Now, while your studies are
fresh in your mind, is the best time
to undertake the requirements.

Your next four years are most impor-
tant. During that period you'll undoubt--
edly make your important career de-
cisions, select and complete training
programs to supplement your academic
training, and pursue graduate schooling,
if you choose. These are the years for
personal development— for shaping
yourself to the needs of the future. If
you have questions still unanswered,
write to me at Section 959-6, General
Electric Co., Schenectady 5, N. Y.

OCTOBER

 

In a series of meetings last spring,
the executive board of the 1957-58
SKYSCRAPER established broad
policies and initiated several new
features. To serve as a more up-to-
-date means of communication, we
decided to publish six issues of the
SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER this

year, rather than the customary,‘

four issues. They will be published
in the months of October, Decem-
ber, January, February, March, and
May.

This year we are sporting a new
look with a tendency toward in-
formality. More timely features are
being offered with this new look.
Letters to the Editor, Halfway Up
the Hill, and a series on Pittsburgh’s
progress are the newest features.

The first subject in the Pittsburgh
series describes the new Aspinwall
water clariﬁcation system. We feel
that this is one of the highlights of
this issue inasmuch as it tells for the
ﬁrst time many of the features of
this new clariﬁcation plant. Ray
Sierka, ChemE ’60, tackled his ﬁrst

/I/ate:

assignment. Since this is a new story,
Ray obtained his information ﬁrst-
hand by visiting the construction
site and interviewing the people in-
volved in the program.

While retaining our status as a
technical publication, we felt that
we should also serve as a source of
campus news. For this reason we
established a new department, Half-
way Up the Hill. In this column we
are publishing current campus in-
formation and citing outstanding
engineers for their accomplishments-

The biggest news on campus to-
day is the proposed changes in En-
gineers’ Week. To this story we have
given special coverage so that every
engineer will be well informed.

Looking ahead to the next issue,
we will look into the problem of the
buckling of steel structures with an
article by Dr. Sonnemann of the
Mechanical Engineering Depart-
ment. Also in store for our readers
is a story on powdered metallurgy
and a special section on the EMITT
award. I
