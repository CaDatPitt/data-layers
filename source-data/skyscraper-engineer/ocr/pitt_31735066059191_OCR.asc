"POWER OFF!" Test operations are directed from this central control room, where
special measuring instruments greatly speed up the collection of pump performance
data. That’s one way Worthington products are made more reliable by using . . .

...the world's most versatile hydraulic proving ground

When you make pumping equipment that‘has to stand up and
deliver year after year anywhere in the world, you’ve got to be sure
it will perform as speciﬁed.

That’s why we built one of the world’s largest hydraulic test
stands at our plant in Harrison, New Jersey. Here, over a half-
acre “lake,” we can check the performance of anything from a
fractional horsepower unit to pumps handling over 100,000 gallons
a minute. When you realize there are thousands of sizes and types
of centrifugal pumps alone, you get an idea of the versatility we
had to build into our proving-ground.

Naturally, our new test equipment is a big help to our research
engineers, as well as our customers. Now they get performance
data on products quickly and accurately. Using it, we can save
months, even years, in developing new Worthington ﬂuid and air-
handling devices—equipment for which this company has been
famous for over a century. For the complete story of how you can

Another engineering firsf—the Boeing iet

The KC—l35, shown on the production
lines of Boeing's Transport Division, is
America’s first jet transport—tanker. It
gives the Air Force a refueling craft that
matches the performance of today’s jet-
age ﬁghters and bombers. In its transport
role, the KC—135 becomes our defense
forces’ first personnel and critical—cargo
carrier geared to the speed and altitude
demands of jet—age operations.

Boeing production engineers—who
helped turn out 888 piston—driven tankers
in this same Transport Division plant —
are now working full time on jet—powered
aircraft. Boeing’s big and growing back-
log of orders for both commercial and
military aircraft creates constantly ex-
panding opportunities for production en-
gineers of all types —civil, mechanical,
electrical, aeronautical, industrial.

OCTOBER 1956

At Boeing, production engineers find
the kind of challenge that helps them
grow in professional stature. They en-
joy the satisfaction of working on such
nationally important projects as the B-52
eight—jet intercontinental bomber, the
707, America’s ﬁrst jet airliner. Guided
missiles, supersonic and nuclear—powered
aircraft are other Boeing projects with a
long—range, exciting future.

Here’s some measure of your advance-
ment potential at Boeing: during the last
10 years, the number of Boeing engineers
has increased 400%. With that kind of
growth, there are always opportunities for
advancement. They could be your op-
portunities, for Boeing promotes from
within. Every six months a merit review
gives you an occasion for recognition,
advancement, increased income.

At Boeing, you live in progressive,
young-spirited communities, with good
housing and recreational activities. You
work with men outstanding in the world
of engineering, on projects of tremendous
importance to your country. You look
forward to one of the most liberal retire-
ment plans in the industry. There’s job
stability, and a limitless future, at Boeing

Because we are sensitive to the needs

of engineering students, the article, “How.

to Hire Your Employer,” is included in
this issue. You’ll find some sure-fire hints
that, if followed, will surely influence any
prospective employer. Being enterprising
Pitt engineers, though, you’ll probably
find many, many more handy hints like
these with just a little thought.

Interested in getting better and more
meaningful results from experimental
data? The article on statistics in this issue
outlines a method of obtaining good ex-
perimental values. This method is im-
practical for student use, too much work,
but you could “wow” your boss with it
after graduation.

Will automation create or destroy jobs?
Top labor officials say that jobs will be
created. Even though machines will be
operating machines and men will be used
only to make repairs and watch control
dials, they stick to their ideas that jobs
will be created. This was the same prob-
lem that confronted the world when the
first industrial revolution was starting.
The common laborer was frantic and
panick-y. He went as far as ‘wrecking and
burning new machines that were installed
in plants. The age of automation will not
have such a devestating beginning.

Your editor had an easy time writing
the editorial this issue. In discussing a
subject that troubles every one of us at
one time or another, electives, he lists
definite courses which have been proven
as valuable to prospective engineers. The
thoughts there are primarily answers by
faculty members to the question, “Which
subjects do you recommend as electives?”
Our thanks for the thoughts to Associate
Dean Turkes, Clyde Darrall, John F.
Calvert, and Dr. Donald E. Swarts.

in the next issue

Because of the ever-increasing role that
research plays in modern industry, a good
part of the next issue will be devoted to
research and industrial research labs.
Many pages will be devoted to photos
and descriptions of the facilities and areas
around the labs of some large corpora-
tions. A story on the role that engineer-
ing assumes in research will be the high-
light of the issue.

The young engineer’s opportunities

with General Motors

FEW MONTHS AGO——after nearly 11 years in the
.A planning and c0nstruction—General Motors
Officially opened its vast new Technical Center on
the outskirts of Detroit.

Here,iOn 330 acres of beautifully landscaped
campus, stand twenty-ﬁve superb air-conditioned
buildings, replete with all the new wonder instru-
ments of modern science and engineering.

It is the world’s largest institution devoted to the
industrial arts and sciences. It houses more than
four thousand engineers, scientists, stylists and tech-
nicians delving into the unknown in search of new
materials, new forces, new techniques.

Its huge resources and research facilities are at the
beck and call of GM engineers in any of GM’s 126

plants in 68 American cities.

Between the engineers at the Center, and those with
any of GM’s 34 decentralized manufacturing divi-
sions, there exists a two-way flow of stimulating
ideas and mutual assistance.

For young engineers now faced with the problem
of building their careers, this new Technical Center

is a monumental symbol of the importance that GM
attaches to engineering and research.

It is a living 8.H'l1‘I’I13.tlOIl of GM’s faith in the future
that modern technology will create.

It is a multimillion-dollar investment in what
General Motors President Harlow H. Curtice has
termed “the inquiring mind.”

Andfabove all——-if you are a senior engineering
student who can measure up to the challenge—it is
further proof that you will ﬁnd at all General
Motors divisions a creative climate for building a
rewarding career in your chosen profession.

Y0 UR FUTURE -
Research and Kojypers?

If yours is the inquiring mind . . .
the mind that never rests until it has
an answer to every “why” . . . then
perhaps research is your future.

There are many types of research,
but whatever your choice it will be
a future of challenge.

For example, more than a century
ago a synthetic chemical, styrene
monomer, was discovered by some
curious research chemists. But not
until 1937 did research engineers
ﬁnd a way to produce it commer-
cially. It has been made in large
quantity only since 1944, when it be-
came the principal ingredient of
synthetic rubber for tires, hose, belts
and other products.

Ordinary men would have stopped
and rested at this point . . . but not

research men. Thanks to their re-
search, styrene monomer has become
basic in today’s improved paints,

plastics, paper and a host of other '

products. Its volume has more than
doubled in the past ten years. And
there are more uses to come!

In addition to styrene monomer,
other chemicals and plastics, Kop-
pers is a leading producer of tar
products, metal products, pressure-
treated wood. It designs and builds
coke, steel and chemical plants.

about a future in chemistry or engi-
neering at Koppers, contact your

ASPHALT is a durable and powerful
bituminous adhesive used in surfacing
more than 80% of the nation’s streets
and highways.

With it, engineers build strong, endur-
ing pavements that are smooth and ﬂex-
ible. What’s more, Asphalt construction
is fast, simple and low-in-cost.

Asphalt is a natural constituent of
most crude petroleums. From them, it is
separated by various distillation proc-
esses that also yield gasoline, lubricat-
ing oil and other refinery products.
Asphalt is a petroleum product and is
not to be confused with tar, a black
substance commonly derived from the
destructive distillation of coal.

The chart shows grades of Asphalt
produced by distillation, blending and
oxidation. These range from watery
liquids to hard, brittle solids.

The semi-solid form, known as Asphalt
cement, is ‘the basic paving material. It
is used in hot-mix Asphaltic pavements
for roads, airfields, sidewalks, parking
areas, dam facings, swimming pools,
industrial ﬂoors and other structures
that require paving.

It’s the basis for membrane linings of
irrigation canals and reservoirs, protec-
tive coating on pipe lines, and structural
waterprooﬁng. In fact, Asphalt cements
are “tailor-made” for literally thousands
of applications, including such every-day
items as tires, battery cases, rooﬁngs,
paints, wall boards, electrical insulating
tape and the like.

Liquid Asphaltic materials are like-
wise used extensively. In the form of
road oils and cutback Asphalts they meet
a variety of demands for both paving
and industrial applications. Road con-

struction and specialty applications also
call for ever-increasing quantities of
emulsiﬁed Asphalts . . . minute globules
of Asphalt suspended in chemically

The engineering advances that Asphalt
makes practical warrant your study of
the art and science of using this durable,

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Some thoughts on electives . . .

Every student engineer must at some time consider
the problem of filling his elective requirements. These
requirements vary for each department, with veterans
and non-veterans, and ROTC and non-ROTC stu-
dents. Elective credits are included in the curriculum
to broaden the students’ knowledge beyond pure tech-
nical subjects and allow more planning of one’s edu-
cation to fit his particular needs.

Many engineering students are thoroughly confused
when it comes time to select an elective subject or
group of subjects. Many feel that they are not getting
any personal benefit from their elective subjects, and
this is true in many cases. Sometimes subjects are
chosen without much forethought and it’s obvious that
when a student enrolls for a course with nothing in
mind except gaining a few credits, he will certainly
profit nothing from the course. The influence of fellow
students in the selection of these courses is often un-
desirable. Many engineers select the same electives as a
friend so that they may have the same or similar
schedules and “stay with the block”.

The major difficulty, it seems, is to have suitable
subjects available at hours that fit into the heavy en-
gineering schedules. But students must be cautioned
against selecting elective courses which conveniently fit
their schedules rather than elective courses which may
be of real value in their education programs. If a real
importance is attached to these subjects, sacrifices in
convenience must be made. This means schedule ar-
ranging and rearranging, and often results in a student
taking courses in the evening or on Saturdays.

So how do we start picking elective subjects? Our
Schools of Engineering and Mines are a part of a large
University and because of this every one of us has the
opportunity of selecting subjects in a great many fields.
Some engineering schools which are closely integrated
have selected a few limited courses as elective subjects
which have been developed into a humanities program.
These have received a great deal of recognition in re-
cent years, probably out of proportion to their actual
value.

Probably the broadest and most popular field of
elective study can be defined generally as the field of
communication. We would include here courses in
speech, English, literature, and report writing. These
courses are valuable and necessary for a successful en-
gineer. The engineer who cannot accurately and intel-
ligently express his ideas in speech and writing will
probably never attain a high position. This is based

from former graduates. Some courses that fit here are:

An increasing number of engineers is entering the
field of management and find the need for management
and business training. Courses in industrial engineering,
labor relations, and related management engineering
courses are suggested electives to fill this need.

The engineer must learn to deal with other people,
and he must be- able to get along with them. A few
courses in psychology and philosophy help the engineer
to understand how others think and how to best deal
with them.

Elective Credits

Psychology 3—Introductory Psychology .................. ..3

Psychology 17——Introduction to Applied Psychology 3

Philosophy 1——Introduction to Philosophy .............. ..3

Philosophy l0——Logic and Scientific Method ........ ..3

Did you notice that these courses have been listed
in groups? It’s a good idea to select elective courses in
a field or area rather than by taking two or three
elective credits in each of three or four areas. The
reason for this is that a two or three credit course in
an area that is completely foreign to a student frequent-
ly has no practical value.

By no means have we discussed a majority of all the
possible elective courses. There are courses in the
languages, fine arts, music, history, political science,
other physical sciences, and courses in the engineering
departments other than your own. Each subject has its
advantages. The student should analyze his own needs
and shortcomings, then set out to correct them with
a proper choice of his elective courses. mck

Career with
A Future

TODAY, the graduate of an engineer-
ing or technical school can make
no more promising choice of careers
than the modern petroleum industry
. . . with its amazing new offspring,
petrochemicals. This is truly the
“industry of the future.”

Phillips Petroleum Company is one
of America’s great integrated oil com-
panies, engaged in exploration, pro-
duction, manufacturing and distribu-
tion of many types of petroleum
products; and Phillips leads in the
fast-growing petrochemical ﬁeld. The
company is a major factor in the ﬁelds
of synthetic rubber, carbon black,
chemical fertilizers, plastics, rocket

A Message From The Dean

Dean G. R. Fitterer

Of all people, the engineers should not arbitrarily
resist changes, yet, one often encounters an engineer
who has become set in his ways and insists on main-
taining “status quo” on matters within his jurisdiction.
The engineer is ‘so often in the center of a changing
mode of life that such reluctance to change can only
be attributed to one whose professional development
has ceased. I

At the present time, there are so many scientific and
engineering “break-throughs” of the knowledge barrier
occurring that they cannot be enumerated. One which
is very exciting is the recent announcement of the re-
cording of video images in color as well as of sound on
the same magnetic tape. Thus, the sound effect as
well as the pictures of home movies may be recorded
on tape and played back on one’s own television set
in color. The complete audio and video recording of a
television program can be recorded on tape and be
played back at a later date.

The impact -of such “break-throughs” as this one on
the photographic and electronic industries and our

‘mode of life are tremendous. The engineer must be
willing to not only accept these changes, but be pre-
pared to contribute to their development. He must also
be prepared to recognize a knowledge “break-through”
where it occurs and this requires him to keep up with
the developments in his field throughout his professional
career.I

Automation, while frequently encountered in our
daily reading, is a word which is still undefined in
most dictionaries. Specifically, the word “automation”
was originated by D. S. Harder, executive vice presi-
dent of the Ford Motor Company, to describe a system
for the automatic handling of parts between progressive
production processes. The R.E.T.M.A. Staff Commit-
tee on Automation recently formulated a comprehen-
sive definition of automation. “Automation is the tech-
nique of improving human productivity in the process-
ing of materials, energy, and information by utilizing,
in various degrees, elements of self-control and of auto-
matically executed product programming.” The in-
dustrial revolution placed machines under control of
men. Automation, woven into such spectacular de-
velopments as electronics and assembly lines, is steadily
placing machines under control of themselves.

Nothing has wrought greater changes in modern life
than the growth of factories. Until 1760 people earned
their daily bread by working their land and by making
articles in the home for local consumption. Since the
early 19th century, the domestic or home craft system
has given way to the factory, or the making of articles
in large establishments. The advantages of the factory
system include increased productiveness resulting from
the division of labor, greater mechanical accuracy, and
lesser cost of production.

The latter half of the eighteenth century inaugurated
a period which historians have called the Industrial
Revolution. It was characterized by the emergence
of the modern world of machinery and engineering. A
major contribution to the successful growth of manu-
facturing was the complex machinery upon which
factory operation was based. Most significant were
the automatic machines which function throughout

§:§A UTOMA TION   

BY LUCIAN A. SPRIGGS E. E. ’57

their cycle of operations without the intervention of ‘hu-
man effort. Special types are used in many industries
for two main purposes:

1. To reduce the necessity for manual labor.

2. To secure uniformity of product. A quantity of
machines placed in line to perform a sequence of
related operations would constitute an auto-
matic assembly line.

In a sense automation can be called revolutionary.
As the first Industrial Revolution gave men radically
new forms and application of energy and power, this
so-called second Industrial Revolution promises to pro-
vide them with radically new methods for exercising
control over processes and operations. Automation is a

generalized form of technological change; it consists of
a new way of thinking about the total process of pro-

duction.

The philosophy which underlies “automatization”
considers the operation of a factory or process as con-
sisting of a continual comparing of the actual per-
formance with a set of standards, and the modification
of the process behavior so as to eliminate errors or de-
partures from the standard. Once this philosophy is
understood, much of the monitoring can be handed
over to machines, which have finer discrimination than
human beings and which can act more quickly.

Automation is a family of several quite different
technical developments. Three fundamental develop-
ments are:

1. Feedback technology.

2. Continuous automatic production or integration.

3. Computer technology.

These concepts may -be applied in all possible com-
binations or used singly.

A common example of the feed-back chain in which

no human element intervenes is the ordinary thermo-
stat by which we regulate the heating of a house. The
thermostat receives from a thermometer the informa-
tion as to whether the temperature is above or below
the desired temperature at which the thermostat is set.
If above, an electric contact activates a power circuit
which shuts off the furnace. If below, another contact
activates a power circuit which turns it up. This whole
process represents a feedback of information. The
furnace, by changing the air temperature, feeds in-
formation into the thermostat, and the thermostat feeds
back into the furnace the command as to what must
be done.

Let us now consider continuous automatic produc-
tion or intergration. The process of assembling an
automobile illustrates the wonders of mechanics and
efficiency. Since the assembly line process is continual,
different large units must be assembled one at a time.
Endless platforms carrying each unit move down the
shop. One car every five minutes has been the record
of a large factory. The Ford Company made a record
of'receiving at the River Rouge docks, Michigan, the
ore on Monday, and a finished car was made from the
material and delive-red to the customer on Thursday
of the same weeek with total elapsed time of only 52
hours. Ford Motor Company has a new engine plant
at Cleveland with an automated assembly line. Giant
honing machines at the end put the finishing touches
on the cylinder bores in the Ford V-8 engine blocks.
Over one-quarter of the new machines bought by the
automobile makers this year will be automated equip-
ment.

Computer technology, with revolutionary new means
of processing and storing information in the form of
numbers, has made its greatest advancement in the
fields of scheduling, invoicing, and accounting. The
author’s firsthand experience at designing Remote
-Control and Digital Data Handling Systems has pro-
vided a valuable insight into the requirements for
“automating” an industry.

The implications of automation are threefold:

1. Technological advances made possible by the
present state of the art will give more flexible
operation and provide a greater range of in-
creased efficiency with previously available fa-
cilities.

2. Economic considerations, including a reduction
in the required number of operating personnel,
result in a “pay off” with short term capital
gains which permits amortizing the original in-
vestment in less than five years.

3. Closer quality control of the manufacturing
process so that the end product can be expected
to consistently meet higher standards. This is
a direct result of the better testing and in-
specting techniques applicable to assembly line
production.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

The completely automatic factory will come slowly
for several reasons:

1. It awaits more consolidations;

2. It requires large capital expenditures;

3. It applies only to standard goods which can be

used in large quantities.

The automatic factory is in the best interests of all
groups—customers, suppliers, share owners, the public,
and employees. It will upgrade labor and encourage
efficiency and quality. Like every other important
technological innovation, automation will create a num-
ber of jobs —— far more than it couly possibly
displace. The constantly increasing standard "of living
in this country is possible by obtaining more production
from each hour of the worker’s effort. Automatic con-
trol extends man’s capabilities in all directions.

'l'oclay’s industry is in an era of unprecedented en-
gineering thought and research. The advance of tech-
nology is a process now commonplace to most Ameri-
cans. A revolution in technology was the core of the
process which transformed the middle ages into the
modern world. New technological developments will
have considerable effect upon the economics and social
structures of those nations which are industrialized.
Most far-reaching is the rapid trend toward automa-
tization of industrial production.

According to theory, only scarce resources have an
economic value. A good resource can be either scarce or
abundant only in relation to the demand for it. Time
should be added to the land, labor, and capital as a
basic category of scarce resources in the United States.
As the output per man-hour increases, because of
greater operating efficiency, the standard of living
will continue to improve. Part of the gain will be
taken, not in the form of increased wages, but in
shorter working hours. Time and goods, like energy
and matter, are ultimately interchangeable. Additional

Machining of aluminum pistons at Ford Motor Com-
pany’s Cleveland Engine Plant requires 25 machines so tied
together with automation equipment that the work is
completely automatic.
leisure time in the future can be devoted to child
care, recreation, adult education, and active home pur-
suits. It appears now that the saving in man-hours,
made possible by increasing use of machines in the
past, is infinitisimal compared to the saving we shall
have in the decades ahead as automatic tools of pro-
duction come into general use.

Automation is not new. It merely provides another
means for increasing the efficiency of production. Au-
tomation actually has been with us in various forms
for many years; the extension of its principles, how-
ever, makes new applications practical. The growth of
automated operations will no doubt be slow, reducing
the occasion for mass labor displacement and per-
mitting the integration of new operating philosophies
into the current scheme, of operation. Just as other
new methods of manufacture were born in radical ideas
of the past, automation will ultimately find its place
in our vast industry. I

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

of experimental data

BY TOM TAROLLI I. E. ’57

The lack of a statistical attitude toward experimental
data is very obvious in the laboratories of industries as
well as in the student engineering labs. When experi-
mental results differ from predetermined or precon-
ceived values, the experimentor is told that had he
used proper care his results would have closely approxi-
mated the correct values. Actually, experimental data
is never precise. Variable results are the rule rather
than the exception. This variability is introduced into
the experiment in two ways: First, in the errors in
measurement. Second, in the lack of reproducing the
conditions which will give the correct results. Since
there is a variability in experimental results, it would
be very foolish to make important decisions from only
one treatment or test. The only way to arrive at a cor-
rect result would be to repeat (replicate) the experi-
ment. A statistical analysis of the data resulting from
this repeating of the experiment can tell the worker how
seriously he may take his results. To this worker sta-
tistics is a tool which will help him arrive at a correct
result regardless of any preconceived notion.

‘Once the worker has repeated the experiment or
treatment and collected the data, he must use every
point, observation, or reading in calculating the arith-
metic average. No observation should be tossed out by
inspection alone, but a calculation of the standard
deviation, a measurement of the dispersion of the
readings should be made. With this standard deviation
one can determine the confidence that he can place
in each of the observations, and intelligently evaluate
each reading and toss out the “out of line” values.
The following example will further explain in detail
how such a calculation should be made.

A certain steel company would like to determine
the hardness of a new grade of steel. The metallurgy

22

 

laboratory takes random samples of this product and
conducts tests to determine the degree of hardness.
The results of the tests, hardness numbers, K1 2X39 X37
X.,.,---)(,, are added and divided by the number of
tests_ )'_'Z;, X;/)2 ' to get the arithmetic average,
X, or mean hardness number. The next step is to cal-
culate the standard deviation. The standard deviation
is the root mean square deviation of the observed num-
bers from their average. Expressed in algebraic terms,
this is 0-’ = . By definition 68 per cent of
the observed values should fall within the range
7:/0" , 95 per cent within 7 -"5 20' , and 99.7
per cent within 7 I 36' , when dispersion is
caused only by factors inherent in the process. By plot-
ing each of the hardness numbers on a grid showing
the arithmeticaverage and 7130' lines the
experimenter can see a picture of the relationship of
his values to his mean value (See fig. 1).

If 99.7 per cent of the observed hardness numbers
should fall between 7130- , the question should
be asked why do some of the values fall outside these

limits. These are obviously out of control points. They
might be the result of faulty measurement practices

at the beginning of the experiment or may be caused
by a piece of defective material. These values are now
pin—pointed as meaningless, and no confidence can be
placed in them. These observations should be recog-
nized as out of control points which were caused by
something other than the normal properties of the
metal. These values can now be discarded with no
guess ‘work involved. A new process average and a
new standard deviation is now calculated using only
the remaining in control points. By plotting the new
process average and 99.7 per cent confidence limits
on a large grid (See fig. 2) the experimenter has a
quality control chart which he can use to check if the
production is in control and if the metal is meeting
the hardness quality.

In order to make this quality check the eexperi-

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

menter, inspector, or metallurgical engineer should
take a random sample of the product and determine
its hardness number. After plotting this value on the
grid, (See fig. 2) the quality control man can see the
hardness of any sample relative to the calculated true
hardness number and the 99.7 per cent confidence
limits. As the number of quality control samples be-
comes greater an analysis of the hardness of the pro-
duct can be made. Trends to either increase or de-
crease the mean hardness and/or standard deviation,
can be detected.

An interesting example in Grant’s Statistical Quality
Control shows how one analysis was made concerning
hardness of a steel casting. Random hardness tests
used in conjunction with a quality control chart showed
control at a satisfactory level for many weeks, but
very suddenly points went out of control. (See fig. 2.)
The production department was sure that they had
made no changes in operations. Regardless, samples
from following heats when plotted fell out of control.
Production said that the met. lab. must be wrong.
Samples were then sent out to a private testing labora-
tory. Their results substantiated that the hardness
quality was out of control. Supervisors put pressure
on the operating personnel, but the hardness quality
of the casting continued to remain low. Finally it was
observed that the source of quench water had been
changed just before the first points fell out of control.
As a last resort the original source of quench water
was restored. Immediately the hardness test showed
points in control. (See fig. 2.) The process has con-
tinued in control at a satisfactory level.

In this example the met. lab. was right, but it should
be emphasized that control chart analysis is applied to
a set of numbers. Anything that affects the numbers
affects the control chart. The numbers are influenced
by variations in measurement as well as in the quality

being measured. The control chart in this example
furnished a study of the trends, a means for investiga-
tion, and a tool for maintaining control.

These methods of large sample statistics depend upon
the determination of the true standard deviation. In
order to obtain this true standard deviation, a large
number of repeated measurements had to be collected.
This type of statistics is, therefore, very appropriate
to production line problems, where samples are easy
to get.

Small sample statistics, developed by R. A. Fisher in
England, is ideal for the the research laboratory; it
does not depend on the accuracy of the standard devi-
ation, but only on the fluctuating estimates available
from small samples, and, therefore, is applicable where
only a small amount of data is available. This is usu-
ally the case in a research lab. where expense and in-
convenience are to be considered. Through the appli-
cation of small sample statistics the research worker
learns to what degree of probability his conclusions
are correct.

The basis of small sample statistics is the t distribu-

tion. Much useful information is obtainable by apply-
ing the t test to experimental data. VVhen an industrial
firm makes a change in the manufacturing process of
a certain product, a change in the quality of the pro-
duct is expected. Having already established that in
the normal course of testing, variability of results will
occur, it might be difficult to tell if a significant change
in quality has occurred. The t test, after only a few
observations have been taken, will tell the analyist if
an improvement has been made in the quality of the
product.

The t test is applicable only when one wishes to test
the difference between two values associated with one
treatment. It can be used whenever there is a difference
between two means, between a single value and a mean,
or between a mean and a postulated value. The sta-
tistic t is the difference betweeen the means divided
by the small sample estimate of the standard deviation
divided by the square root of the number of obs_erva-
t 
An example of how the t test works will serve to fur-
ther explain the use of this test.

In order to be consistent, let hardness again be the
quality with which the experimentor is concerned. A
certain type of steel sheet had a mean hardness number
of 65 Rockwell, a value which was gotten by applying
the procedures of large sample statistics. Fabricators
who were using this steel were very satisfied with this

tion taken. Expressed in a formula, this is

hardness property, but the steel was much too brittle.
After a few consultations it was decided that by sac-
rificing hardness the brittleness would disappear, and
the final product would not lose any of its fine qual-
ities. After changing the processing, tests were made to
determine if the hardness of the steel sheet, had chang-
ed. In this determination speed was important, for the
customer would not accept steel with the high hardness
number. Therefore, there was no market if the sheet
still had its original properties. The material and all
the labor cost applied to it would be lost. Twelve
sample pieces were tested for hardness, and the follow-
ing hardness number were the results of the tests: 55,
62, 54, 58, 65, 64, 60, 62, 59, 67, 62, 61. Remembering
that 65 Rockwell was the old hardness number, it would
be impossible to state confidently that the hardness of
the steel had been decreased. The following steps were
taken in calculating, through the use of the t test if
a change had occurred:

a. Hypothesis: New hardness No. is 65.

A rejection of this hypothesis would be an acceptance
that a change in the hardness of the steel had occurred.

b. We assume this statistic had a t distribution with

11 degrees of freedom.

The term degrees of freedom has mathematical im-
plication of the number of independent variables in-
volvcd. For the purpose of this article it will only tell
where to look in tabled numbers.

c. Reject hypothesis if t > 2.20 or if t(—2.20.

These values came from tables of value of t. Knowing

24

only the degree of freedom, one less than the number
of samples taken, and how much accuracy desired, the
experimenter can easily pick out these limiting values
for t.

cl. Calculation of t:

73 =_%}% =  (6a75-65):-383

X is the arithmetic average of the twelve observations,
and s is the standard deviation of those same twelve
values.

e. The hypothesis that the new mean hardness
equals 65 is rejected for t, —3.83, is less than
—2.20.

Therefore, operations may continue, assured that
the hardness quality of the steel has been changed, and
quality control charts can now be designed through
the use of large sample statistics to insure a continued
check on that quality.

Two necessary conditions in the design of experi-
ments which will be analyized statistically are repli-
cation and randomization. Their purpose of replication
is twofold. First, it serves to average out different
sources of error. Second, it supplies an estimate of
error. Without this error estimate it is impossible to
evaluate the significance of any effects on the treat-
ments. The amount of replication of an experiment
is a matter of economic balance. The cost of repeating
the experiment may be great. On the other hand is
the risk of loss if a possibly important cause of vari-
ation is overlooked. If the cost of replication is not
great the proper course is to repeat the experiment.
Duplication of the possible source of variability gives
infinitely more information than no duplication at all.
Randomization, the second necessity of experimental
design, introduces the laws of chance into the experi-
mental data. An engineer is familiar with order ar
systematic procedures and naturally, does his work in
an orderly way. Statistically, he is loading the dice in
favor of some trend which could be associated with
carrying out the experiment in that order. In order to
avoid system in collecting data, uncontrolable factors
should determine when an observation should be taken.
Possibly every time the telephone rings a sample should
be taken from the production line. This type of plan
would install randomization into the data. Another
method of getting random data would be through the
use of random number tables. These tables are merely
lists of random numbers.

It should be emphasized that experiments must be
designed to take advantage of statistical analysis. The
design should have a place for replication and randomi-
zation. If these two factors are present the experi-
menter can get’ great results from statistic analysis
of the data he has collected. He can arrive at a -true
value through the use of large sample statistics, or he
can determine, quickly, by applying the test to his
data, if a significant change in his mean value has

occurred. I

PROFESSIONAL

REGISTRATION

FOR ENGINEERS

BY PROF. R. C. GORHAM E. E.

28

The National Society of Professional Engineers is an
association of legally-qualified engineers and surveyors.
Its purpose is to serve all engineers, regardless of e'm-
ployment or classification, in the realm of their non-
technical activities. The Society functions at three
levels: local community, state, and national. The local’
and state groups make up the national organization
which maintains its offices in a new building. The
building, at 2029 K Street, N.W., Washington 6, D. C.,
is becoming known as the “Crossroads of Professional-
ism”.

Purposes

Some of the objectives of the Society are:

1. Safeguarding of life, health, and property.

2. Advancing the welfare of the engineering and
surveying professions.

3. Placing the control of engineering projects within
the scope of proper laws and acts. (This is done
by sponsoring the creation and enforcement of
adequate licensing laws.)

4-. Focusing public attention upon functions and
accomplishments of engineers.

5. Sponsoring and promoting honorable procedures
tending toward recognition commensurate with
the dignities and responsibilities of the engineer-
ing.

History

It is difficult to separate the history of the Society of
Professional Engineers from that of the history of
registration and/or l-icensing of engineers and surveyors,
since the Society’s membership consists only of legally
registered or licensed professional engineers and sur-
veyors _

In 1907, people in Wyoming began to reason that if
the public, when they engaged the services of a doctor
or an attorney, had the right to know that they had
obtained a professional man who was well-qualified
to look after their welfare, they should have the same
knowledge when employing an engineer. To accomplish
this the first Engineers’ Registration Act was passed in
the state of Wyoming in the year 1907. It provided that
engineers offering their services where life, property and

welfare were involved must prove their qualifications
to the state.

The Wyoming Law was just the beginning. Penn-syl-
vania passed its first Engineering Registration Act in
1921, and by 1950 all 48 states, Alaska, the Philippines
and the District of Columbia had passed similar laws
protecting the public from incompetent engineering
practitioners.

By 1933 there were a few engineering societies or-
ganized in some of the states having Engineering Regis-
tration Laws. It "was on April 2nd, 1934 that a Penn-
sylvania "Chapter was granted a charter by the Court
of Common Pleas in Philadelphia County. The Pitts-
burgh Chapter was formed on July 24th, 1935. Others
followed rapidly and the idea for -a National Society
of Engineers was first discussed and studied by 28
prominent engineers, beginning May 25th, 1934 in

..New York City. Later, on September 3rd, the Na-

tional Society was chartered. Today the N.S.P.E. is
twenty-two years old, a relatively young professional
group, with headquarters in the $400,000. building
in Washington. The Society serves 38,000 members
over the nation. Potentially there are approximately
200,000 registered engineers and surveyors eligible for
membership in the N.S.P.E. This is about fifty per
cent of the total number of engineers in the United
States.

Qualifications for Registration

Pennsylvania law No. 367, which has been in opera-
tion since 1946, requires that only men having Bache-
lor of Science degrees from engineering schools of rec-
ognized standing plus four years of engineering ex-
perience in any or all of the well known classifications
may apply for.the final written examination in his
chosen field of engineering. These written examinations
are given in January and June of each year. Section A
of the Professional Engineering Examination includes
two questions on ethics. Each candidate is required to
answer one. Section B includes two questions on en-
gineering economy, of which each candidate is also
required to answer one. Section C: is the engineering
practice in the field or a classification which the can-
didate chooses. This section usually includes 12 ques-
tions covering the field chosen and the candidate is
required to answer six of them completely. Thus a to-
tal of eight questions is required, each having equal
weight of 12% per cent, and minimum grade of 70 per
cent is required to pass the examination. This informa-
tion applies to Pennsylvania, but many other state laws
have similar requirements.

Pennsylvania is one of three states which requires no
written examination on the fundamentals acquired by
Bachelor of Science engineering students during their
four training periods. However,‘ since thirty other
states do have laws which require a full-day examina-
tion on fundamentals, the Pennsylvania Board has been
willing to give examinations in fundamentals to the

OCTOBER 1956

Bachelor of Science degree men. This provides the op-
portunity for graduating seniors in engineering to try
for a passing mark on the fundamental Engineer-in-
training examination ‘while they are still in school so
that. they may be accepted by “endorsement” in any
of the other states if they leave Pennsylvania to -practice
engineering elsewhere. This adds up to one eight-hour-
day of written examinations covering the subjects of
Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, and Elec-
trical Problems in Part 1, which is given from 8 A.M.
to 12 noon. After a one hour lunch period, Part II is
given from 1 to 5 P.M. It includes Statics, Kinetics,
Strength of Materials, Heat Power and Fluid Mech-
anics. Each part has two questions on each subject.
One question on each of four subjects is required, the
fifth question may be chosen from any of the five sub-
jects in each Part I and II. A grade of 70 per cent is
required here for passing.

After four years of practice the engineer with a
Bachelor of‘ Science degree, and having taken the En-
gineer-in-Training examination, is now ready to apply
for the final Professional Engineer’s exam. The exam-
ination lasts for a full nine-hour day and covers en-
gineering practice. One meeting the requirements of
citizenship, and listing five good references who are
thoroughly acquainted with the candidate’s work rec-
ord and can recom-mend him the candidate may be
finally registered.

Law No. 367 also provides for registration of people
who have no formal training. If they have a total of 12
years’ experience, are well recommended by five refer-
ences, they may pay the same fee of $25 and apply
for both examinations. In these cases the law requires
the candidates to pass Engineer-in-Training in lieu of
the fundamentals and also the final in the field of
practice, each with a passing grade of 70 per cent.
Procedure for Students

Senior students may obtain application forms from
R.  Nickles, Department of Public Instruction, Box
911, Harrisburg, Pa. The fee for E.I.T. fundamentals
examination is $10, which will later be deducted from
the $25 fee when the final P.E. examination is applied
for. Announcements of the time and place will appear
on bulletin boards in the ten engineering schools of the
State of Pennsylvania.

Advantages of Becoming Registered _

The advantages of becoming registered may be tabu-
lated here briefly.

l. A registered engineer or surveyor receives author-
ity to practice his profession and receive recog-
nition commensurate with the dignities and re-
sponsibilities of his profession.

2. He ‘becomes established in his profession on the
basis of legal requirements,_ and may proceed to
practice with no inferiority complexes.

The matter of professional registration is a serious note
that all graduating seniors should consider.I

BY CHARLES MCMINN M. E. ’55

A pound of coal buried in the depth of the earth
contains as much heat as a pound of coal in a fuel bin-
but the unmined coal is unavailable whereas the fuel
in the bin possesses immediate usefulness. Few people
consider that in purchasing coal the price paid is al-
most entirely for its immediate availability rather than
its heat. If a home owner were offered a limitless sup-
ply of fuel located at the North Pole he would hesi-
tate before purchasing, regardless of how low the price
may be, because he ‘would think in terms of trans-
porting the fuel for use in his home. Free coal in t?
North Pole would doubtless be more expensive tha.
coal purchased in his neighborhood.

In statements advertising heat pumps it has frequent-
ly been said that in place of using fuel, the heat pump
utilizes free heat from the earth, air, or water. Such
a statement is true in the same sense if coal were given
away unmined in the North Pole. Although the coal
were free, the cost of digging and transporting would
make it expensive. In the same way, the cost of ther-
mally digging free heat from the earth, air, or water,
and transporting it is equally expensive. A heat pump
is, in effect, a thermal shovel for digging from a low
temperature mine and delivering it to a sufficiently
high temperature for use in space heating.

Progress and Difficulties in Installation.

All heating systems are made up of certain basic
processes:

1. Transformation of energy, as from the chemical
energy stored in a fuel to the heat energy re-
leased in a furnace.

2. Transportation of energy from the place of
transformation to the place of use, as by steam,
water, or air ducts.

30

3. Liberation of energy to the heated space, as from
convectors, radiators, heating panels or warm
air grills.

4. Distribution of energy uniformly through the
heated space by carefully sizing and locating the
energy liberating units.

Each of these processes is equally important in deter-

mining the effectiveness of the system and failure of
any process would certainly destroy the system as would

the failure of a link in a chain. In a correct technical
sense, the heat pump is not a complete system but only

one method in carrying out the first of these four major
processes. As a furnace serves to transform chemical
energy stored in coal, oil, gas, or wood into heat energy,

so does a heat pump serve to transform thermal energy.

stored in the earth, air, or water into heat energy.
Specifically, a heat pump is a device to replace a
furnace as one element of the system, but no more
than this. The heat pump arose from a laboratory
curiosity not too many years ago and has progressed
through various stages of experimental applications un-
til it now appears in dealers’ showrooms, ready for in-
stallation in your home. The difficulties experienced in
converting to peacetime operation after V—_] Day, and
the subsequent boom in conventional air conditioning
equipment, combined with the lack of research in the
electric utility industry, were resulting factors which
(liscouragcd the consideration of this new product.
The progress of the pump in actual installation dur-
ing the past nine years is disappointing when judged by
the relatively small number of existing installations,
but the progress of experimentations and testing makes
the situation less discouraging. By the end of 1948 five
new experimental installations had been applied in
newly constructed residences. These packaged units
heated and cooled the houses satisfactorily, although
the electrical energy consumption was 20 to 30 per cent
greater than expected. These systems experienced con-
siderable difficulties with compressor belt breakage,

four-way valve failure, loss of refrigerant charge, and
erratic defrosting operation. Since that time, belt dif-
ficulties were eliminated by heavy duty belts and a larg-
er diameter sheave; a different material and seat design
corrected the four-way valve failure; loss of refrigerent
was reduced by silver soldering all pipe joints to with-
stand high operating pressures; and a more sensitive
switch solved the defrosting difficulties.

Principles of the Heat Pump.

The heat pump is based on basic laws as old as life

itself:

1. Heat exists in air, water, and earth at all tem-
peratures, below freezing as well as above, all
the way down to absolute zero (—Zl5O degrees 

2. Heat always tends to flow from a high temper-
ature source to a low temperature source. Most
manufacturers’ versions of the heat pump are the
air-to-air type, extracting heat from the outside
air. This is possible because of the temperature

difference existing between the outdoor air at
20 degrees and the liquid from under pressure
in the coils at about —10 degrees F. Under these
conditions, a temperature range of 30 degrees
is available at any given time from which heat
may be extracted and used in raising the.- heat
level inside the house.

Heat pumps are fully automatic, using only air,
electricity and a refrigerant. The refrigerant, liquid
freon at —l0 degrees F, is pumped through coils to the
outside where it picks up heat from the warmer air and
evaporates. A pump compresses the freon, which is now

OCTOBER 1956

a vapor, raising its temperature to 190 degrees F. It
then passes to the indoor coils where it gives up its
heat to ‘warm the room. A control valve then removes
the pressure from the refrigerant so it can condense at
a low temperature, becoming cold and ready for use
again. This is, of course, the exact opposite of the re-
frigeration cycle, so for summer cooling the control
valves of the heat pump are reversed and the compres-
sor pumps the refrigerant (freon) in the opposite di-
rection to pull the warm air from the inside of the
house, thus cooling it off.

The heat pump is compact, flexible in operation, can
be readily applied to any air conditioning distribution
system, and can be safely located as a central plant or
as a number of self-contained packaged units. It is
also capable of furnishing both heating and cooling to
different areas simultaneously, as well as to cycle daily
or even hourly between heating and cooling, during
mild weather. There has been no basic change in the

Sources for Heat Pump.

The earth as a heat source offers interesting possi-
bilities, particularly for the residential heat pump, even
though few installations have been made to date. The
high.installation cost caused by difficulty of embedding
the earth’s surface and the large amount of piping
needed for a typical size residence is causing the pro-
spective buyer to lose interest in this type pump.

Well water is the most attractive heat source from the
stand point of obtaining high operating efficiency. The

difficulty in obtaining water whic-h requires neither
exclusive treatment nor use of expensive metal, and
the cost of pump maintenance, drilling and sewage dis-
posal detract from the use of well water in many areas.
There are about 50 per cent more heat pump installa-
tions of the type using water instead of air as a heat
source, and, in contrast, relatively few systems employ
the earth as a heat source and sink.

It is believed that air with a supplementary heat
source ‘will become the most practical heat source and
sink for most heat pumps in the United States.

The main design difficulty here is the fact that the heat
source temperature is at a minimum during periods
of greatest heat requirements. Auxiliary solar heat or
thermal storage may offer a solution to this problem,
but further research is needed before practical designs
can be expected.

Practical Performance.

For maximum coefficient of performance during the
heating cycle it is necessary for the compressor to op-
erate at relatively high suction pressures and at low
condensing pressures. This means obtaining as high a
suction pressure as possible with the available heat
source and using t-he lowest permissable delivery tern-
perature to the conditioned space. The minimum per-
missable delivery temperature when using air as a
medium depends on the circulation rate which can be
used without causing objectionable drafts. Improve-
ments have been made in the design of outlets which
permit higher discharge velocities and greater circu-
lation. Closely connected with this distribution is the
reduction of heat loss by use of insulation, double win-
(lows, and other heat saving devices. Less heat loss per
volume permits smaller air quantities, and, consequent-
ly, lower supply temperatures can be used without af-
fecting the comfort of the occupants.

At least six manufacturers are now making self-
packaged units in sizes ranging from 2 to 20 horse-
power. These units were primarily designed for resi-
dential and small commercial installations, but the use
of multiple units is finding favor in the larger instal-
lations. Cost ‘wise, the manufacturers say, heat pumps
compare favorably with conventional air conditioning
systems, although no extensive operating cost figures
are available yet. Westinghouse has released the average
monthly electricity bill during the first year’s heating
and cooling operation of three experimental installa-
tions in private homes. In Lynchburg, Virginia, the
cost of heating and cooling an eight room house was
$33.10 per month at a rate of l%c kilowatt hour rate.
In Fort Worth, Texas, the figure was about $40.00 per
month for a five room ranch type house at 2c per
kilowatt hour. In Miami, Florida, monthly costs for a
five room bungalow averaged $10.50 per month at a
1%c kilowatt hour rate. In the current state of develop-
ment the heat pump is best adapted for use in the
southern and pacific coast regions where the low temper-
ature range is neither extreme nor long lasting.I

the students speak . . .

What’s Wrong With Engineers’ Week?

In accordance with an English 39 assignment, Pitt
Engineers have ‘written articles which reflect their
thoughts, comments, criticisms, and recommendations
concerning Engineers’ Week at the University of Pitts-
burgh. The ideas highlighted in these articles show
that, through experience, the students have begun to
recognize some of the shortcomings as well as the great
benefits of a celebration honoring all Engineers, but
specifically Engineers at Pitt. Some of the comments
from these assigned articles are reprinted here.

“Engineers’ Week is a special week celebrated at the
University of Pittsburgh Schools of Engineering and
l\4ines to show that engineers have capacities of organ-
ization, spirit, and practicality as well as technicality,”
wrote Bob Steffy, ’57. \/Vith this definition Bob went on
to laud the accomplishments of Engineers’ Week. He
praised the events, spirit, and purpose of the “Week”.
Some of the engineers ‘were not as praise-giving in their
criticisms. Many found places where improvements
could be made. The Open House of the Week was the
object of much of the criticism. Jacques. Hill, ’57, said,
“Although rules have been set up as to the amount of
time that the tours may spend in each department, it
has been found that this rule was not followed. By the
time the students arrive at the last displays their in-
terest is not as keen as it was at first . . . waning in-
terest makes the departments last on the program feel
that their displays do not get the fresh interest of any
of the students on the tour.” Scott Johnson, ’57, a guide
during the open house observed, “Traffic jams .
were caused by three things, namely: the indiscriminate
placing of misleading advertising signs, students going
ahead because of lack of interest in one or more par-
ticular exhibits, and students by-passing bottlenecks
without their guides. These wandering students added

OCTOBER 1956

to any already confused situations.” The confusion
seemed so great during the Open House to Sam Ku-
blanow, ’58, that he suggested, “The open house should
be extended to include an extra day.”

As every engineer knows, the judges also toured the
displays during the Wednesday Open House. ‘Of all
the papers which were read, some 75, only a very small
minority commented on the judging for the Shamrock
Award. Jacques Hill was a little vague when he wrote,
“Various changes have been made in the point system
in the past, but there is some feeling that more changes
should be made in the future, especially in the grading
system used on displays. I think high school students
are not capable judges of the displays and are prone
to -choose the spectacular display rather than consider
all the displays from an engineering standpoint.” Donald
May, ’57, wanted to revert to last year’s judging
methods. He wrote, “The judges should allot the points
to the department after they have seen all the displays.
They may allot the full amount of -points for one aspect
of the displays of one department and then find an-
other department that is better than the first.” The
fact that these were the only criticisms of the judging
shows that a great improvement was made over past
Engineers’ Weeks, and most of the students had an-
ticipated the results as they were announced.

The building of displays for the public to view and
for points toward the Shamrock Award received many
comments from the English 39 students. One of the
more general comments made by Terence Cousins, ’57,
in discussing the lack of Freshman participation in dis-
play building was, “Complicated projects add to this
problem as greater technical knowledge is needed to
make them. Because of the know-how required, these

33

jobs usually fall to the upper classmen who have al-
ready gone through a classroom thinning out procedure.”
Possibly Ish McLaughlin, ’57, had the same problem
in mind when he stated, “Lower classmen should not
be permitted to run for departmental chairman. There
should be some means to make the job more attractive
so that more qualified men will take an interest.” Fred
Reginella, ’57, also was upset about the display building
problem, “Another point that needs to be improved is
the lack of assistance -by some faculty members to the
students. Once a group of students commences to work
on a certain display, they are on their own. They re-
ceive little or no assistance or advice. There are very
few facilities which the students might employ in the
process of erecting the displays . . . It is true that En-
gineers’ Week is primarily a student affair, but then
what constitutes a complete sc-hool if not the faculty
as well as the students?” It was understood by every-
one that in order to win the Shamrock Award displays
must be good, and for the displays to be good, time
and hard work is necessary.

“This time and work are often given at the expense
of studies,” observed Fred Nlooney, ‘57. Fred went on
to say, “Many students by-pass their assignments com-
pletely and never do regain this lost time.” Fred Regin-
ella was very much in agreement with Mooney for he
wrote, “A great deal of the lack of participation is
evident. The chief reason for this lies in the fact that
if they (student engineers) were to take an active part
in the setting up of displays, undoubtedly they would
be compelled to neglect some of their school work. As
a result, those that-do participate actively encounter
an excessive amount of work which they are unable to
do, without neglecting their school work . . . The other
alternative would be to dedicate only one’s spare time
to the displays, but in such a case the department has
very little to exhibit during the . . . Week.” “A happy
medium is the answer to this problem,_” wrote Don May.
A state must be reached where a balancing of the work
load would enable everyone to keep up in class and still
have everyone work on displays. Then this would not be

a problem.

The recognizing and solving of problems concerning
Engineers’ Week was not the only accomplishment of
the English 39 papers. Many original ideas were also
set forth. “Individual Awards,” wrote Sam Kublanow,
“should be given to the student who has done the most

to further his department’s bid for the Shamrock
Award.” rSam thought that this would promote a great
deal of competition between the students and therefore
enliven the “Week”. P. Sontheimer, ’57, had a similar
idea but directed it toward improving displays. “Upon
the completion of any specialized course, highways, hy-
draulics, or structures, the student would present a pa-
per giving his idea on how he would set up a working
model to illustrate any phase of the course he so
chooses. A contest could be devised and a-wards given
for the best suggestion.” Sontheimer went on to say
that t-hese papers could serve a dual purpose; one, in
building displays, two, in revising a course of study. In
order to get better coverage at the events scheduled
during Engineers’ Week, Don May suggested, “A poll
should be made among the engineering students to de-
termine the best time for events . . . this can be seen
by the poor attendance at some events that financially
were cheaper than other events which had better tum-
outs.” Some of the ideas set forth were good, and some
were bad. The preceding were some of the better sug-
gestions submitted. They and many others had much
merit.

Many intangibles were recognized as the most im-
portant result of Engineers’ Week. “It helps teach
people to get along together, and it creates a feeling of
accomplishment by working as a group,” stated Ronald
Frank, ’57. “Committee members both of intra-depart-
mental and inter-departmental scales developed many
skills in planning and organizing . . . A feeling of pride
was aroused in every participant of Engineers’ Week . . .
a feeling of accomplishment and prestige remained at
its finish.” These were the closing observations of Ger-
ald Fisher, ’57. Robert Steffy finished by saying, “En-
gineers’ Week should become and remain a tradition
at the University of Pittsburgh . . . It benefits both
the University and the engineer.”

The invaluable experience derived in presenting and
planning Engineers’ Week is recognized by all students.
These English 39 papers are a proof of this fact. The
realization that Engineers’ Week is not only a time
for fun, but a time to show the world that Engineers at
Pitt have great technical training, and the understand
ing and ability to get along with people must certainly
be heartening to the Dean of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines, the University, and Engineers throughout
the world.I

THE OUTSTANDING SEMINAR
AWARD

One of the top annual awards presented at the
spring semester’s joint seminar of the Pitt Schools of
Engineering and Mines is the “Outstanding Seminar
Award”. Presented by the Junior ‘Class Officers of the
Sc-hools of Engineering and Mines with the support of
the Engineering and Mines Cabinet, this award recog-
nizes the student seminar that has presented the most
outstanding overall program during the school year.

The judging of the student seminars has varied
almost every year that the award was presented, but the
method of evaluation used -by last year’s Junior Class
Officers is similar to methods used in the past. Many
points are covered here regarding just what makes a
good seminar program. These could serve as a guide
for any groups who want to win the award next spring.
They may then plan to improve their particular pro-
gram and attempt to gain the coveted award. Student
opinions on the judging system as a result of reading
this can go far in attaching more prestige to the award.

Each departmental seminar was required to submit
a report of its activities for the past school year. A
point system was set up and the reports were judged by
a student committee consisting of the Junior Class Of-
ficers of the Schools of Engineering and Mines. These
officers were Danny O’Connell, President; Bob Muzik,
Vice President; and Bill Gannon, Secretary. The point
system used by this committee eliminated most of the
reports on the first round and enabled a main com-

36

mittee, consisting of both student and faculty members,
to consider only the top two seminars. This main com-
mittee included the students mentioned and two fac-
ulty members: Dr. Donald E. Swarts, Director of Stu-
dent Publications and Mr. Jack Hardman, Assistant
to the Dean of Men.

Four distinct categories were included in the point
system. The first of these, activities of the seminar,
was divided into three groups: social, educational, and
athletic. Points were awarded on the basis of the num-
ber of events held in the social and educational groups
and on the number of different sports in which the
seminar as a group participated.

The second consideration in the evaluation of the
seminars was the quality of the Thursday morning
seminar programs themselves. The seminar program
at Pitt is designed to serve as a medium where stu-
dents can learn of the latest developments in their field,
in the engineering field as a whole, and some important,
related non-engineering fields such as economics and
human relations. As a result this aspect was included
in the evaluation using the weights of 15 per cent for
general‘ engineering, 15 per cent for non-engineering
but in related fields, and 70 per cent for specific field
of study in engineering as their consideration. The per-
centage of the year’s programs that should be devoted
to these particular areas of study were ideally chosen
as equal to these percentages.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

The third category in which the seminar programs
were evaluated was student -participation in the four
specific areas. Student participation in the social events,
educational events, and athletic activities was judged
on the basis of percentage of students attending the
events. Individual student participation in the seminar
programs, something which the committee found was
lacking in the reports, was the fourth field of evalu-
ation. Here consideration was given to the number of
times students presented or participated in the day’s
program.

Final consideration in the point system was a special
category that was installed to provide credit for ac-
tivities or accomplishments of the seminar which were
not included in the previous three categories. This cate-
gory gave special consideration for any outstanding
contributions to the student body of the Schools of En-
gineering and l\/Iines or to the entire University.

From the two seminars which had the largest point
total in the initial judging, the winner of the Out-
standing Seminar Award was chosen by the student-
faculty committee. The only instruction given to this
committee was the following, contained in the letter
sent to all judges: “In the overall evaluation you should
determine ‘which seminar has presented the best pro-
gram for the development of a well-rounded individu-
al.” The main committee then chose the outstanding
group, and the results were announced at the joint

seminar last May 24.

For the second consecutive year the Industrial En-
gineering Seminar, the student chapter of the A.I.I.E.,
won the Outstanding Seminar Award. The name of
their grc.up and the year were engraved on the per-

|E’s pose with their seminar advisor, Harry Wolfarth, and
the outstanding seminar plaque which was awarded them.

OCTOBER 1956'

 

manent plaque of which they received possession for
one year. Nosing out the ‘Chemical Engineers, A.I.Ch.E.,
in the balloting, the IE"s led the Chem E’s by a single
point in the initial judging and a single vote in the
final judging. There were many features of the two
groups’ programs that earned them the top two ratings
among the seminar groups. These are worthwhile fea-
tures that other seminars could incorporate into their
programs this year.

The IE’s had a strong social program last year with
four social events being held throughou-t the year.
Two spaghetti dinners, a picnic, and a dance made up
the IE social calendar. Their Thursday morning pro-
grams were a good balance of general engineering,
non-engineering, and specific interest programs per-
taining to their specific field of Industrial Engineering.
This balanced program was considered the best pre-
sented by any group last year. Their report of the
year’s activities, submitted to the Outstanding Seminar
judging committee, "was well prepared. Presented in
outline form "with a detailed listing of all programs
and activities held during the year, the report en-
abled the committee eto easily find the information
needed to judge the seminar.

Several features of the Shem E seminar were also
outstanding. Their “welcome freshmen” seminar where
coffee and donuts were served to all Chem E5 was a
great program. Designed to make the freshmen feel at
home and have them become acquainted with the up-
perclassmen, the program undoubtedly aided the new
freshmen. This freshman welcoming seminar was prob-
ably one of the main causes of the activities of the
Chem E freshmen during Engineers’ Week. Another
strong feature of the Chem E program was the seminar
newsletter. A two page newsletter, it presented various
student views on many subjects. Another feature of
the -Chem E program was its seminar program on “How
to Study”. This particular program featured a panel
of the top students in the department giving their
ideas on best methods for study. Student participation
seminars such as these go a long way toward developing
well rounded individuals who are capable of delivering
a talk or carrying on an intelligent discussion before
a group.

Several other seminar groups used individual speakers
from the student ranks. In particular, the Petroleum
Engineering Seminar and the Institute of the Aero-
nautical Sciences used student speakers and reported
excellent results.

As the students are drawn closer to the core of the
seminar program, the entire program will take on ad-
ditional value to all concerned. As the seminar pro-
grams continue to grow in scope and depth, the use-
fullness to the student will increase. Soon it may be
said that the seminar program at Pitt is a deciding
factor in the development of the professional engineer.
This should be the aim of all seminars, and as com-
petition for the Outstanding Seminar Award becomes
more intense, this goal will be achieved.I

...in the field of INSTRUMENTATION

 

Among the many engineering problems relative to
designing and developing today’s tremendously
powerful aircraft engines is the matter of accumu-
lating data — much of it obtained from within the
engines themselves -- and recording it precisely.
Such is the continuing assignment of those at Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft who are working in the highly
complex ﬁeld of instrumentation.

Pressure, temperature, air and fuel ﬂow, vibra-
tion -— these factors must be accurately measured
at many signiﬁcant points. In some cases, the meas-
uring device employed must be associated with
special data-recording equipment capable of con-
verting readings to digital values which can, in turn,
be stored on punch cards or magnetic tape for data
processing.

Responsible for assembling this wealth of infor-
mation so vital to the entire engineering team at

Pratt & Whitney Aircraft is a special group of elec-
tronic, mechanical and aeronautical engineers and
physicists. Projects embrace the entire ﬁeld of
instrumentation. Often involved is the need for
providing unique measuring devices, transducers,
recorders or data-handling equipment. Hot-wire
anemometry plays an important role in the drama
of instrumentation, as do various types of sonic
oriﬁce probes, high temperature strain gages, tran-
sistor ampliﬁers, and miniaturized tape recording
equipment.

Instrumentation, of course, is only one part of a
broadly diversiﬁed engineering program at Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft. That program —- with other
far-reaching activities. in the ﬁelds of combustion,
materials problems, mechanical design and aero-
dynamics -— spells out a gratifying future for many
of today’s engineering students.

TO THE FINE, YOUNG ENGINEERING MIND

HOW TO HIRE YOUR EMPLOYER

Engineer, get that high-paying job ! ! !

I’m sure that we are agreed that the first interview
with a prospective employer is most important. It gives
you a chance to look him over and ascertain if his or-
ganization fits into your way of doing things.

Foremost among the things to look for in a prospec-
tive employer are these: trustworthiness‘——can he be
depended on to stay out of your hair and not bother
,you with silly questions, not just occasionally, but all
of the time; loyalty——does your boss smoke the same
brand as you, for there’s no sense scrounging cigarettes
that you don’t like; dependability-—are the Coke,
candy and coffee machines always well stocked? These
are, of course, only suggested as the major character-
istics to look for in an employer—others will undoubt-
edly occur to you.

Mention should be made here as to the proper at-
tire to be worn to the interview. Avoid flashy clothes!
A simple plaid sport coat, conservatively pegged trous-
ers (tunnel loops and pistol pocket flaps optional), tat-
tersall vest, and tee shirt are recommended attire. Much
thought should be given to the question of clothing and,
while studiously avoiding loud clothing. it is well not to
dress too conservatively. For in some quarters wearing
shoes is regarded as evidence of stereotyped thinking
and the prospective employer might well decide that
the applicant lacks imagination.

Prior to, or immediately after the interview proper,
it is well to conduct supplementary interviews of pro-
spective fellow employees. With male employees it is
advisable to determine beforehand how far they’ll go
in lending money. Do not forget to interview any girls
‘walking around. Here congeniality is the watchword!
These interviews may go a long way toward influencing
your decision of how much money for which to ask.

On to the interview proper!—as soon as the intro-

ductions are over, tell him to get to the money. This
gambit will immediately impress him with the fact that
you are no timewaster, but one who gets right to the
heart of the matter. You will impress him as a man of
action. He will appreciate this.

The next point is very important and cannot be
stressed too earnestly. TURN DOWN THE FIRST
OFFER! (The one exception to this rule is the un-
likely event that you are offered. a drink). To do this
properly you should recoil slightly in horror, wrinkle
the nose as when passing a smouldering dump, and
shout in a hoarse voice, “Are you crazy?” For a minute
he’ll think he is. This is your cue to switch‘ the trend
of the conversation to a consideration of “working con-
ditions”—a definite misnomer.

This bit of strategy tends to keep the employer on
the defensive, while at the same time letting him think
that you are really interested and he is getting through
to you. Since employers dearly l-ove to brag about work-
ing conditions, you’ll have to be on your toes to keep
him off balance. In 72 per cent of the cases reviewed
by the panel, little posers like these proved effective:
(1) “How long for lunch?” (Hint: when he answers,
say, “Humph”). (2) “Air conditioning?” (If he ans-
wers no, shake head slowly; if yes, say “O-oh, colds”).
(3) “What time do we start work?” (No matter what
he says, murrner softly, “That’s pretty early”).

It is always well to have on hand newspaper or, bet-
ter yet, magazine clippings alleging a shortage of en-
gineers. This will be appreciated as evidence that you
are on your toes and have a comprehensive knowledge
of the problems of industry at your fingertips.

In concluding the interview, endeavor to leave the
impression that you’re interested but not quite sold
on the job. 'Offer to call back in “a few weeks.”

A parting word: See ya at Fort Meade! I

Q!

More than $36 million has been earmarked by the
University of Pitts-burgh since 1951 for a building de-
velopment program that may be without parallel in edu-
cational history.

Much of the construction is now complete or well
underway. In the early planning stages, engineers
stressed the importance of using long-lasting materials
—'with a minimum of future maintenance cost.

In addition, features of the structures are permanent-
type, flexibility and economy of space. .

Two buildings typical of the development program
are the Schools of the Health Professions and George
Hubbard Clapp Hall, in both of which wrought iron
pipe is employed for a wide variety of uses.

Wrought iron was chosen because of its high resis-
tance to corrosion and resulting long life.

A total of 21.3 tons of the special metallic piping,
produced by A. M. Byers Company, Pittsburgh, has
been installed in the $15 million Schools of the Health
Professions building. Wrought iron soil, waste and vent   I  N
lines, under three inches O.D. were installed by a Pitts-
burgh plumber, while a Pittsburgh heating contractor,
installed wrought iron steam condensate and pump  
discharge lines in the 13-story building. It will house
the Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry and
Nursing and connects directily to Presbyterian, Wo-
men’s,' and Eye and Ear Hospitals—three of eight
hospitals affiliated with the University’s medical pro-
gram.

In the $2.5 million George Hubbard Clapp Hall,
which will house natural science facilities, 22.4 tons
of wrought iron were installed. The Byers iron was used ' P ' b ° ld °
for soil and waste lines, two and one-half inches and    
under, as well as vents, downspouts and steam conden-
sate lines.

The Hall is named for one of the founders of the
Aluminum Company of America. Mr. Clapp was chair-
man of the school’s board of trustees for 42 years.

Schmidt, -Garden and Erikson, Chicago, is the archi-
tectural firm for the Schools of the Health Professions
Building while Trautwein and Howard, Philadelphia, More than 22 tons of wrought iron

is serving in a similar capacity on Clapp Hall con- have been installed in the $35 mu.

In addition to these uses, wrought iron is also being 1»; -- »  .
considered for a proposed snow melting system under A
the 12 x 370-foot sidewalk which fronts the Schools
of the Health Professions Building.

Buildings already constructed and occupied since
the University development program began are the $1.5
million 'M61T1OI‘lal Field House, $4.5 million Residence
for Nurses and $1.5 million Engineering Hall.

Both the Schools of the Health Professions building
and Clapp Hall are scheduled for completion this year.
Another structure, the $5 million Graduate School of

Meet Dick Foster

Pﬁastern Electric development engineer

 

Dick Foster joined Western Electric, the manufacturing and supply unit of the
Bell System, in February 1952, shortly after earning his B. S. in mechanical
engineering at the University of Illinois. As a development engineer on a
new automation process Dick first worked at the Hawthorne Works in
Chicago. Later, he moved to the Montgomery plant at Aurora, Illinois
where he is pictured above driving into the parking area.

 

Here Dick and a set-up man check over the automatic production line used to man-
ufacture a wire spring relay part for complex telephone switching equipment. This
automatic line carries a component of the relay on a reciprocating conveyor
through as many as nine diﬁerent and very precise operations—such as percussive
welding in which small block contacts of palladium are attached to the tips of

wires to within a tolerance of i .002”.

 

Dlck ﬁnds time for many Western Electric employee activities. Here he is
scoring up a spare while tuning up for the engineers’ bowling league. He is
active also in the golf club, camera club, and a professional engineering so-
ciety. Dick, an Army veteran, keeps bachelor quarters in suburban Chicago
where he is able to enjoy the outdoor life as well as the advantages of the city.

  

Dick’s day may begin in one of several ways: an informal oﬁice chat
with his boss, a department “brain session” to tackle a particularly
tough engineering problem (above); working with skilled machine
builders in the mechanical development laboratory; or “on the line”
(below) where he checks performance and quality and looks for new
ways to do things.

Examining the plastic molded “comb” components of the wire
spring relay Dick recalls his early work when he was involved
in working-up forming and coining tools for the pilot model of
the automation line for fabrication of wire spring sub-assemblies
for relays. At present he is associated with the expansion of
these automation lines at the Montgomery Plant.

Western Electric offers a variety of interesting and
important career opportunities for engineers in all
ﬁelds of specialization in both our day-to-day job as
the manufacturing and supply unit of the Bell System
and in our Armed Forces job.

If you’d like to know more about us, we’ll be glad to

ENGINEERS AT F RESHMAN CAMP

On the week end of September 14-16, over 200 in-
coming freshmen attended the 25th annual Freshman
Camp at Camp Kon-O-Kwee near Zelionople. It was
a week end most of them will always remember.
years at Pitt.

About ninety of these freshmen were engineering
students. Therefore, it was necessary to divide these
boys into two groups, Engineering Blue and Engineer-
ing Gold. These two groups competed with similar-
sized groups from the School of Business Administration,
the College, and the Pre-Meds for the Freshman Camp
Cup.

Every moment of the week end was packed with

competition between the groups in athletics, songs,
and skits. When the smoke of the three days settled
at the award dinner on Sunday, the cup was presented
to the Bus-Ads. To be truthful, the engineering groups
finished fourth and fifth, respectively.

But winning wasn’t the important thing. No one
played, cheered, or fought harder than the engineers.
Every engineering freshman who attended knew that
he really benefited from this great experience.

The upperclass counsellors leading the Engineering
Gold were: head counsellor Tom Tarolli ’57, Ed Hayes
’57, Cal Jobe ’59, Ron Neumar ’59, Jack Schubert ’57,
John Tyler ’57, and Wayne Thompson ’59.

Engineering Blue was led by head counsellor Mitch
Kozikowski ’57, Ron Puntil ’57, Don Madzin ’57, Don
McDonald ’57, Joe Fitzharris ’59, Ken Speckhals ’59,
and Dick Reutzel ’59.

All the freshman form the friendship circle as camp closes.

« Regardless of the final standings the engineers did
have some bright moments. Ron Rush, an Engineering
Blue freshman, was the tennis champ of the camp. En-
gineering Gold was the volleyball team champ and
, placed in the finals in basketball and softball. Joe Bat-
I taglia, a freshman engineer, was the best diver of the

day in the swimming meet. The Engineering Blues won
first place in the skit competition on Saturday night.
All in all, each of the boys who attended really put
forth his best to win that cup.

The faculty advisor of freshman camp this year was
Mr. Vince Lopardo of the ME department. Blaine
Leidy ME, Harry Wolfarth I-E, and A. C. Ackenheil
ti CE, were engineering faculty advisors at camp. Nick
Sirianni ’56, the Outstanding Graduating Senior of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines last semester and
former “'Mr. Pitt” attended camp as a guest of the
'_< engineers and spoke to the freshmen at the campfires
on _Friday night.

Soviet

Educational

System

for Engineers

The Soviet educational system has trained a small
but elite corps of aeronautical scientists who are second
to none, according to a pioneering Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology study of Soviet education in aero-
nautics.

“These top scientists,” says the M.I.T. report, which
was prepared by Dr. Leon Trilling, assistant professor
of aeronautical engineering at M.I.T., “acting as small
flexible task forces, have solved a number of theoretical
questions selected to keep Soviet aeronautical
science abreast of any competitor.”

-“The full cross section of engineers in the Soviet
Union,” says Dr. Trilling, “have apparently not yet
acquired that degree of engineering ‘feeling’ which only
broad familiarity with machinery can bring.”

The study was prepared by M.I.T.’s Center for Inter-
national Studies and is part of a broad examination of
the qualitative aspects of Soviet technical education
being conducted by the Center under —a government
contract and a grant from the Carnegie Corporation
of New York.

The M.I.T. project on Soviet education is under the
general direction of Alexander G. Korol, who was born
in Russia and who was in the midst of securing an en-
gineering education there when the Revolution broke
out. The study is the first major part of the project to

be completed.
“On the basis of the evidence,” says the report “it

is our conclusion that there exists in the Soviet Union
a group of talented people with drive and ambition
who are generally permitted to reach the top, some-
times quite rapidly, and that their number has in-
creased as a direct result of Soviet educational policy.”

There can be little doubt that the ability and know-
ledge of this key nucleus is on a par with that of the
best men in similar positions anywhere, but that at the
present time these men do not have adequate support,
that is, the technical support of a well-balanced body
of engineers and technicians.

50

The study is termed the Trilling study and is the
first to examine in Close detail the qualitative aspects
of a single segment of Soviet technical raining. It is
the first to base its conclusions on the pattern of “ver-
tical integration” which is typical of technical training
in Russia.

Vertical integration means that in general the seg-
ments of Soviet professional programs are defined by
the indust'rial monopolies.

This is the opposite of the familar “horizontal” pat-
tern of subject matter divisions found in the United
States.

In this country, for instance, a man trained as an

electrical engineering has a wide range of employment
opportunities.

He may seek a job with a firm manufacturing elec-
trical appliances, or with a telephone company to im-
prove the efficiency of communication networks, or
with an airplane builder to design automatic control or
radio equipment.

This is the horizontal approach to engineering edu-
cation. It stresses versatility and fundamentals. This
l1or_izo11t2.1l approacli requires institutions which are in-
dependent of productive facilties.

In the Soviet Union the situation is altogether dif-
ferent. Responsibility for he productive activity of the
nation is divided among a small number of powerful
ministries, each of which has full charge of a definite
segment of the industrial economy.

 

Each ministry is responsible for many services and
much auxiliary equipment needed in its main task:
housing in newly developed areas, factory construc-
tion, light and specialized tooling, control equipment,
safety equipment.

In particular, each ministry trains in its own institutes
the skilled personnel—engineers, economists, and others
—necessary for its operations. This is vertical integra-
tion.

'Dr. Trilling analyzes this vertical integration in his
study of ‘Soviet education in aeronautics.

He discusses the undergraduate training of engineers
generally and of aeronautical engineers in particular.
He considers graduate training and research in aero-
nautics. He analyzes the contributions of research in

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

basic science to the development of aeronautics.

Dr. Trilling finds that one of the chief weaknesses
of the Soviet system is its inevitable duplication.

A mechanical engineer of the Ministry of Aircraft
Production, for example, may be trained to design the
same values and piping as one in the Oil Production
Ministry without any interchange of information be-
tween the two.

Yet the system also permits a flexible use of top
technical people within any given ministry. Key men
carry a variety of responsibilities. They lecture at the
university, supervise research at the aeronautical in-
stitute, serve as consultants to the industry itself.

This “multiple hat” system, as Dr. Trilling calls it,
works with apparent effectiveness. The system also
permits concentrated and integrated attack on any
given problem.

In spite of the Soviet strength in science and applied
science, says Dr. Trilling, their situation appears less
favorable in engineering.

“In the sciences,” he notes, “there existed a solid
pre-Revolution base which required only to be broad-
ened. In engineering the Soviet system started almost
from scratch.

“Moreover, the Soviet regime undertook the task
of training a large engineering force while at the same
time enormously expanding the national industrial
machine. Appreciable progress has been made in both
directions, but much remains to be done to create

a technical base comparable in engineering instinct to
the American or German base.”

The number of graduate students at Soviet technical
schools is also uniformly low, ranging from two per cent
of the student body at Bauman Technical School in
Moscow down to zero at many of the outlying insti-
tutions. This contrasts to thirty-eight per cent at t-he
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and an average
of twelve per cent in American technical schools gen-
erally.

“The Soviet situation,” says Dr. Trilling, “may be
the result of a deliberate policy which aims to get en-
gineers into the industrial stream as quickly as possible
and to enable the senior professors to educate the best
graduates as carefully and thoroughly as possible.”

But it also appears, he adds, that insufficient contact
with mature creative teaching personnel and a strong
emphasis on factual knowledge useful for immediate
applications in design and manufacture have limited
the number of young people who give promise of or-
iginality and show an interest in research by taking an

advanced degree.
“Although a long-range Soviet policy of industrial

expansion in the future and the training of additional
teachers should provide an increasing supply of en-
gineers,” concludes the M.I.T. study, “it is doubtful
whether they will generate sufficient self-reliance in
technical matters without extensive changes in the en-
tire Soviet approach to the problem of edupation.” I

INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT

STEEL...
WHEREVER YOU TURN

 

Abundant, durable, versatile and compara-
tively cheap, steel in its many carbon, al-
loy and stainless forms is the most useful
of all the metals at man’s disposal. Un-
known in nature, steel had to be created
by man’s ingenuity, from iron ore and
other available natural materials.

Today, an estimated 1V2 billion tons.-of
steel are in use in this country. With- a,
capacity of about 125 million net tons a
year, American steel mills can produce
close to half the world's annual total. Used
for everything from buildings to pins, the
total applications of steel are almost count-
less; it is virtually impossible to ﬁnd a
product that does not depend on steel for
its production or distribution, or both.

Steel's steady growth reflects the impor-
tance of its contributions to America's

OCTOBER 1956

greatness. Much credit must go to the in-
dustry itself, which did not hesitate to exe-
cute a bold post-war capacity expansion
program of more than 28 million net tons
at a cost of nearly 6 billion dollars. The
steel companies are carrying on an inten-
sive two-fold program to develop new
sources of ore. While spending hundreds
of millions of dollars to open ﬁelds in
Labrador and elsewhere, they are also in-
vesting heavily in engineering develop-
ments that will make it possible to use
domestic low-grade ores such as taconite.

Interwoven with the history and progress
of steel is the development of steam gen-
eration for power, processing and heat.
B&W, through the applications of steam,
has long been a partner in the vital, steel
industry—-has brought to it boiler building

experience covering almost a century, built
on the results of a continuing, intensive
program of research and engineering de-
velopment. In steel as in all industry,
improvements in steam generation will
continue to make genuine contributions
.toward still better products and services.

Most of the engineering students are already aware
that the entire seventh floor of the New Engineering
Building was made into the George M. Bevier Mem-
orial Library. Probably someone is wondering just how
all this came about, and how Pitt came to acquire this
special technical library.

George M. Bevier was born in Brookville, Pennsylvan-
ia. He began his engineering at Carnegie Tech and
trans-ferred to the University of Pittsburgh in 1911. In
1913 he received his degree from the School of Mines.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and several oil
companies employed his as a geologist. He soon became
a Texas oil man and the new library is the result of
his $35,000 grant to Pitt.

Then there is always a pleasant, helpful librarian.

'I'he rifle harrel steel that makes hunting more fun

A .30/06 riﬂe can get heavier toward nightfall!
That’s why a prominent gunsmith never gave up
looking for a new steel—one that would be lighter,
would machine readily, and yet would take the
enormous ﬁring stresses of even heavier calibers.

Steels normally used for lightweight barrels gave
all kinds of trouble to the gunsmith: distortion,
poor ﬁnish, high tool costs, trouble with drilling,
reaming, riﬂing. They took this problem to Timken
Company metallurgists—and got the perfect
solution.

This 1'lMKEN® rifle
harrel steel is free
from internal stresses

Developed by the Timken Company, this new steel
(center barrel, in picture) made possible a riﬂe
barrel 6 ” shorter, 2 lbs. lighter than the previous
barrel of the same caliber (left). It withstands the
wear of thousands of rounds of ﬁring. Machines
to highest accuracy—and to high ﬁnish beauty.

Who gets the most
exciting assignments‘

in electronics?

The answer is young engineers at IBM-.-—1ong a leader
in computer engineering.

Perhaps you, too, would ﬁnd it challenging to
solve problems similar to these typical and
recent IBM problems:

Design and development. Develop a magnetic core
memory using transistor drive circuits. This
involved a study of the characteristics of cores

as a load, of the arithmetic portions of the
machine as a source of information to control

' the core driving circuits, and of the pulse

characteristics of transistors.

Manufacturing. In magnetic core storage units,

three or more wires must be woven through every

t_ core in the array, each a tiny doughnut less than

1/10 of an inch in diameter. This weaving process
‘was a tedious, painstaking hand—operation——a far
from desirable method. The development of a rapid _
automatic assembly method was necessary to attain
economic V volume production.

Field Engineering. Assume responsibility for
performance and maintenance of an entire computer
system (composed primarily of electronic equipment)
in one of today’s most vital defense projects.

In addition to exciting assignments, young engineers
at IBM ﬁnd the kind of advanced facilities,
stimulating associates, and climate which encourage
personal progress and achievement. If your
abilities thrive on challenge, IBM offers you
unlimited opportunity to make important and
rewarding contributions.

taken orders running into the hun-
dreds of thousands over the phone.
The stores operate in every active oil

world, with men or agents in 24
countries on six continents.

Room to Grow in All Directions—l

Besides its store system, National
Supply has six plants, in Pennsyl-
vania. Ohio, Texas and California.
The equipment these plants make is
drilling wells or handling "produc-
tion” in every oil ﬁeld this side of the
iron curtain. National Supply is not
a "'narrow” company—its products
go to a wide range of industries. It
is big enough to offer you leg room-
over a quarter-billion i11 sales last
year—-but not big enough for a good
man to get lost.

National Supply conducts a search
for twenty-ﬁve exceptional college

graduates. Accountants, industrial
management majors, salesmen and
engineers—men who want responsi-
bility, who prefer to move up rather
than vegetate. For those interested in
a general business career there is a
broad nine months training program
which includes indoctrination lec-
tures. ﬁeld assignments and plant
visitations. For the engineer who
seeks the challenge of product design
there is a longer-range development
program embracing indoctrination.
plant and ﬁeld experience. In either
case, they will be men who are
attracted by National Supply’s growth
possibilities.

The first source, which contained 1540 curies of r‘

cesium-137, was completed in 1954 and is now in use
for medical research at the Oak Ridge Institute of
Nuclear Studies. The second source will be used in a
fission-product utilization program at the University
of Michigan.

Cesium-137 is the most important long-lived (about
30 years) gamma ray-emitting isotope found in the
by-products of nuclear fission. It is expected that, in
addition to the well-known medical applications, mil-
lions of curies will be used by industry in the future for
radiography, pasteurization of foods and drugs, and
catalyzing chemical reactions.

The radioactive cesium used in this source was chem-
ically recovered‘ from wastes resulting from the process-
ing of reactor fuels and converted into dry cesium
chloride powder. The powder was pressed at 20,000‘
pounds per square inch to form compact pellets. Threef
of the pellets were combined to make the final radia-
tion source by placing them in a double-walled, stain-
less steel container which was double-sealed to produce
a leak-tight capsule.

WAMOSCOPE

A radically new type of cathode-ray tube for radar,
television, and other electronic display applications has
been developed by Sylvania Electric Products Inc. in
cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory.
Eliminating many of the tubes and components re-
quired by conventional receivers, the new cathode-ray
tube combines most of the essential functions of a
microwave receiving set in a single tube envelope.

In a radar receiver utilizing the “Wamoscope,” mi-
crowave signals go directly from the antenna into the
tube, where, in a single envelope, the signals are am-
plified, detected, and displayed on the tube’s fluores-
cent screen. Compared with a conventional radar re-
ceiver, this means that the local oscillator, mixer, inter-
mediate frequency amplifier, detector, video amplifier,
and their associated circuitry are eliminated.

An important feature of the new tube is the wide
selection of channels possible in the “Wamoscope,”
which operates over a microwave frequency band of
2,000 to 4,000 megacycles.

ELECTRONIC A0 READER

A Film-:1-record Electronic AO Reader designed to
accomodate either 16 or 35mm microfilm, was recently
introduced by Remington Rand. Electronically oper-
ated, it features finger-tip control from high speed to
slow creep and stop, thus meeting all reference require-
ments. Its 11/2” square screen shows images in greater
perspective and brilliancy. Built-in interchangeable
lenses permit an instant switch from 23 to 1 to 40 to 1
magnification. Mounted on rubberized casters, it can
easily be used in any department.

LARGEST 115-KV CIRCUIT BREAKERS

This three-pole 115-kv, 10,000-mva power circuit
breaker being loaded for shipment at the East Pitts-
burgh works of Westinghouse Electric Corporation is
the first of its rating ever built. Previous maximum
rating was 115-kv, 5,000-mva.

The breaker is the first of nine identical units built
by Westinghouse for delivery this summer to a large
midwestern utility.

The three-pole units are shipped completely assemb-

‘ on a unit base mounting ready for installation.

LIQUID METAL PUMP

A mechanical liquid metal pump built by the West-
inghouse Atomic Equipment Department has just com-
pleted a successful 500-hour performance test run at
more than 100 degrees F—the highest temperature at
which a pump of this type has ever operated for an
extended period. It is rated 150 gpm at a 285-foot head.

The new mechanical (centrifugal) pump has a her-
metically-sealed “canned-rotor” which contains pump
and motor rotor in one integral unit. This isolates the
pumped fluid and all rotating parts from the field
windings and outer atmosphere.

Production models of the pump will opera-te at temp-
eratures up to 1600 degrees F, and will be applied‘ to
nuclear power plants, chemical process lines, and other
applications requiring high-temperature heat-transfer
mediums.

Naturally, the reason for hiring any
man at Columbia-Southern is that we
believe he is qualiﬁed to ﬁll one of
the initial assignments available.

But what we want most are men for
whom the ﬁrst job is merely a starting
point. We expect Columbia-Southern
to keep up its impressive growth record
and we want men who can not only
grow with the company, but who can
help make that growth possible.

Ultimate advancement at Columbia-
Southern does not depend on any
particular type of specialized training.
Because the company's operations are
centered chieﬂy around chemical pro-
duction and research, more chemists
and chemical engineers seek employ-
ment than people with other kinds of
training, and more are hired for initial
assignments. But numerous other abili-

ties in a wide variety of ﬁelds are needed
——and in consideration for advance-
ment, the important thing is not what
kind of degree a man has but how
much responsibility he can handle.

It is not unusual for a college man
to be uncertain as to just what type of
work he will ﬁnd most interesting.
That's why our new employees are
given “on the job” training. It affords
new employees the opportunity to
perform various assignments so that
the employee, as well as the company,
will discover the job in which he will
be happiest and for which he is best
suited.

Columbia-Southern oﬁ’ers qualiﬁed
graduates a liberal starting salary. More
important, each employee's progress is
reviewed periodically to insure that
salary level keeps pace with demon-

 

strated professional growth and
responsibilities.

Columbia-Southern has a need for
promising young graduates now. If you

A LOOK

 AT FUTURE

DESIGN

How to prepare for it

EEDS for even more efficient ma-
chinery are daily presenting new
demands on the ingenuity of machine
designers. In the same way, products
themselves must incorporate even
greater economies in materials and in
manufacture to help keep pace with
the pressures of growing competition.
This trend in design thinking, there-
fore, poses a promising challenge to
the student engineer.

Rapid strides in the use of welded
steel construction point the way to a
brilliant opportunity to pioneer new
concepts in the ﬁeld of product design
engineering. Fundamentally, steel it-
self is the most economical material
for many products, based on steel’s
inherently high strength, rigidity and
low cost. The challenge, of course, is
how to utilize the steel to its maximum
advantage.

Here welding holds the answer to
new savings in cost of manufacture.
New welding electrodes, new welding
techniques being introduced almost
daily offer new avenues to obsolete
production methods of long standing.
Typical savings through the use of
welded steel are shown in the follow-
ing example.

 

All-welded headstock for power drive
is made from 16 gauge sheet. Esti-
mated to be 20% more rigid, weigh
28% less, cost 44% less than cast iron
design. Photo courtesy Oster Manu-
facturing Company, Cleveland, Ohio.

niques. You can start with helpful

The girl was through with her

husband happened to return home
at this time and entered through
the back door. -Seeing what his wife
was doing as he passed the bath-
room door, he exclaimed, “Well,

Without turning her head, she
replied, “I’ll take 50 pounds today
and don’t you dare pinch me with

Once upon a time a beautiful
girl was walking through the woods
when she came upon a poor little
frog who spoke as follows:

“Lovely princess, once upon a

a big witch turned me into a frog.”

“Oh, that’s terrible,” said the
beautiful girl. “Is there anything I
can do to help you?”

“Yes indeed,” replied the frog.
“If you will take me home with
you and put me on your pillow, I
will be saved.”

So the beautiful girl took the
poor little frog home with her, and
the next morning when she awoke
there beside her was a handsome
young prince. And, do you know,
to this day her mother still doesn’t
believe her story.

A young man contemplating ma-

CURTA CALCULATOR

The simplicity of a new calculating machine devel-
oped by the Utility Supply Company was demonstrated
at a meeting of the Office Machine Dealers of Chicago.
Two children, Nancy and Michael Wolfe, ages 9 and
11 respectively, put on an amazing display of calcu-
lating feats.

From numbers called from the audience, including
problems in multiplication o-f large numbers running
into the billions, short-cut multiplication, squares, cubes,
percentages, division of large numbers, square roots
and the solving of equations, the children quickly pre-
sented the answers.

The uniqueness of the Curta Calculator lies in the
fact that it performs calculations in much the same
manner as large desk calculators, yet is small enough
to be carried in one’s pocket or brief case.

SUPERSONIC TEST VEHICLE, THE X-7

A supersonic Lockheed test vehicle is playing a major
role in the development of powerful new engines for
Air Research and Development Command ramjet mis-
siles. It is the X-7, designed and built by Lockheed’s
Missile Systems division.

In the ramjet development program the X-7 is used
as a high speed test bed to get test and design informa-
tion in actual flight. Through this research and testing
program, successful ramjets for operational use are
being developed.

Ramjets, considered the ultimate in ducted-jet en-
gines for guided missles, are comparatively simple de-
vices that give tremendous power at high speeds. Un-
like conventional jet engines the “flying stovepipes”
have no compressors or other moving parts and depend
upon their own high speed to compress their air in-
take. Generally speaking, the faster they go the better

they operate~—without the limiting factors, such as
compressor speeds and heat, that limit conventional jets.

In operation the X-7 is taken aloft by a B-29 and
then launched. A rocket booster drives it up to the speed
where the ramjet operates efficiently and takes over
to accelerate the vehicle. The supersonic vehicles are
recovered by parachute and are used again for future
test flights.

Inco Nickel Progress Report

How Inco’s more-from-the-ore
research program is expanding
North America’s natural resources

Once the iron in Nickel-containing
pyrrhotite went to slag heaps.

Now this high-grade iron .ore—'product of Inco research— goes to
steel mills. Here you see it being fed into open hearth furnaces.

Now Inco saves iron in Nickel ore from the slag heap

There's iron in Nickel ore.

But for years, this iron was of
no commercial value. No one could
ﬁnd a way to recover it.

Recently, after years of re-
search, International Nickel pio-
neered a new extraction process.
Scrwes iine iron-

Nickel is recovered, too!

This new Inco process not only
recovers iron ore from pyrrhotite
economically; it is the highest
grade iron ore (68% iron) now
produced in quantity in North
America. It also recovers the
Nickel in the ore.

For its pioneering new process,

ALSO RECOVERS NICKEL

International Nickel has built a
$19,000,000 recovery plant. Mod-
ern and streamlined, this plant is
only the ﬁrst unit of the new Inco
Iron Ore operation. It is expected
to add hundreds of thousands of
tons a year to this continent’s
high—grade iron resources.

More from the ore

That’s*one of the prime objec-
tives of International Nickel’s ex-
pansion program. As in the case of

A

iron ore, this has enabled Inco to
expand the free world’s natural
resources. Today, International
Nickel gets fourteen different ele-
ments from its Nickel ores.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL The above
curve shows the growth in Ramo-Wooldridge personnel
which has taken place since our Progress Report one year
ago. A signiﬁcant aspect of this growth is the increase in
our professional staff which today is made up of 150
Ph.DIs, 240 M.SZs and 310 B.SZs or B.AZs. Members of the
staff average approximately ten years’ experience.

I-'AcILITIEs Within the past few months, construction has
been completed at our Arbor Vitae complex, which now
consists of eight modern buildings of 350,000 square feet,
four of which are illustrated at the bottom of the page.
Nearby is the R-W ﬂight test facility, including hangar,
shop, and laboratories, located on a 7-acre plot at Inter-
national Airport.

To provide additional space for our continuing growth,
construction has been started on an entirely new 40-acre
Research and Development Center, located three miles
from the Arbor Vitae buildings. The photograph above is
of a model of the Center, which we believe will be one of
the ﬁnest research and development facilities in the coun-
try. The ﬁrst three buildings, now under construction, will
total 250,000 square feet.

A second major construction program is underway on a
manufacturing plant for quantity production of electronic

systems. The initial unit of the plant, locatedin a 640-acre
site in suburban Denver, Colorado, will be completed next
spring and will contain approximately 150,000 square feet.

PROJECTS Our current military contracts support a broad
range of advanced work in the ﬁelds of modern commu-
nications, digital computing and data-processing, ﬁre con-
trol and navigation systems, instrumentation and test equip-
ment. In the guided missile ﬁeld, Ramo-Wooldridge has
technical direction and systems engineering responsibility
for the Air Force Intercontinental and Intermediate Range
Ballistic Missiles. Our commercial contracts are in the ﬁelds
of operations research, automation, and data processing.
All this development work is strengthened by a supporting

program of basic electronic and aeronautical research.

THE FUTURE As we look back on our ﬁrst three years of
corporate history, we ﬁnd much to be grateful for. A wide
variety of technically challenging contracts have come to
us from the military services and from business and indus-
try. We have been fortunate in the men and women who
have chosen to join us in the adventure of building a com-
pany. We are especially happy about the seven hundred’
scientists and engineers who have associated themselves
with R-W. Their talents constitute the really essential ingre-
dient of our operations. We plan to keep firmly in mind the
fact that the continued success of The Ramo- Wooldridge
Corporation depends on our maintaining an organizational
pattern, a professional environment, and methods of oper-
ating the company that are unusually well suited to the
special needs of the professional scientist and engineer.

, None of the exciting technical promises for the future can come true without
parallel developments in many ﬁelds. And the ﬁeld of special steels is especially
~ important—for almost everything that’s made is either made of or made by
a special steel.
Crucible is the nation’s foremost producer of special steels, including tool
and high speed, alloy and stainless, magnet and spring, and many, many others.
Also, through its aﬂiliates, Crucible produces titanium products and vacuum-

_, melted alloys—products whose modern applications have only scratched the
surface.
