To say that our first Engineers Week
didn’t surpass all expectations would be a gross understatement
and could come only from someone who was away from the
Pitt campus for that week.

Much of the credit goes to the students and rightly so; for it
was they who made it the success it was. It was the students who
took part in the Week, added the needed spirit and livened
things up to a point where the entire University and all Oak-
land knew that the Pitt Engineers were celebrating.

Congratulations to all of you; it was a fine job. The engineers
have received a lot of deserved credit from the rest of the Uni-
versity (including the Administration) because the week was
constructive, not destructive. This fact was especially true of
the parade on March 17. That demonstration could have been
very destructive, but wasn’t. It was a change to see a group as
large as ours having a little fun without tearing things down.

I’m sure we all agree that Engineers Week should be a tra-
ditional affair at Pitt as it is in many other schools. That raises
the question of what’s going to happen at the same time next
year. Certainly the students made the week what it was but it
took a considerable amount of planning and organizing on the
part of a few men to get it started and to give the students the
opportunity to do what they did. And what’s going to happen
next year? Bob Dickenson, this year’s Chairman and the person
most responsible for the success, will be back next year as will
a few others on the committees. Most certainly we will not let
the week drop out of sight as it very easily could. You can bet
that “A” in seminar that there will be an Engineers Week again
next year.

But how about the year after that, and the year after that?
Maybe there will be a few people willing to give the time to
organize the celebration and maybe not. It will be too bad if
the week fades out in a few years when it should be getting
better all the time-.

The only way to insure the tradition is to put the week in the
hands of some organization that has proven themselves capable
of planning it, or, to create a new organization for the specific
purpose of continuing the tradition.

Creating a new organization, or at least a good one, is not
easy and takes time. But it can be done.

Giving the responsibility to the E & M Association would
be the best solution but until now this organization has been
incompetent due to its election system. Too many representa-
tives have been elected and have never attended the meetings
or accepted the responsibility that goes with the position. True,
there have been some good men elected, but there have also
been others chosen against their will or even as a joke. It is no
wonder that this organization has little responsibility given to
it or doesn’t even try for more when the burden is all on a
few men. '

The E & M Cabinet is now in the process of changing their
election system to require a petition by every representative
running for election. This change should insure a Cabinet of
men who are interested in doing something for the Engineering
and Mines Schools, and not just in getting a title for themselves.
It could also solve the problem of organizing Engineers Week.

By this time petitions should be in and the voting over. It is
the sincere hope of this editor that an improvement has been
made and that the Cabinet has men capable of handling En-
gineers Week. Otherwise a new organization will have to be
created or next year might be the last Engineers Week at Pitt.
Good luck to the Cabinet!

The end of each semester always brings the receiving of di-
plomas and a parting of old friends. And so it is with five staff
members of the Skyscraper Engineer, Paul Weiner, Bud Spang-
ler, Bill McKenna, Bob Varga and Don Rohaus will receive their
sheep skins this _]une. We hope that you have all profited from
your relationships with the Skyscraper and thanks a million for
your help.

a Technical Graduate

 

The broader the diversiﬁcation of an oil company, the greater
is the need for specialized technical talent. Which explains why
Phillips Petroleum Company has well over 2,700 technical grad-
uates among its more than 22,000 employees.

Some of these scientists and engineers work constantly to pro-
duce and improve our automotive fuels and lubricants. Others
are engaged in the development and manufacture of such widely
diversiﬁed products as carbon black, butadiene, chemical fertili-
zers, synthetic rubber, sulfur compounds and chemicals used in
synthetic ﬁbers.

With this technical talent constantly studying the world's
most versatile raw materials——crude oil and natural gas—pros-
pects are good for the still further diversiﬁcation of Phillips oper-
ations and markets.

On THE ENGINEER IN PUBLIC SERVICE

by Dr. G. R. Fitterer

Periodically one hears the statement that because
of their training, engineers are materialistic and not
concerned about the effects of their technological
developments on society. New machines and new
processes, for many years, have been blamed for un-
employment particularly during the depression years
in the early 1930’s. It was said that by means of new
machines and other labor—saving devices, we were
producing ourselves out of employment. The attitude
of the public has changed in the past few years to the
extent that even labor unions today realize that the
development of new machines creates new industries
in which many jobs are made available.

The materialistic label which has been given en-
gineers has also been attributed as the cause of all
world conflicts and difficulties in which we currently
find ourselves. It might be worthwhile to review the
individuals who have been responsible for wars and
many of our socialistic upheavals. In no case can one
name a scientist or engineer who was the head of an
aggressor nation. Certainly this was not the profession
of Hitler, Mussolini or Stalin. On the other hand, en-
gineers should be proud to emulate the accomplish-
ments of one of the greatest statesman who ever lived;
namely, ex-President Herbert Hoover. The accom-
plishments of Hoover should be reviewed by every
engineer.

It will be recalled that Hoover was a mining-metal-
lurgical engineer and that for eighteen years, prior
to 1913, he spent most of his time out of the United
States—in Mexico, Canada, Australia, Italy, Great
Britain, South Africa, India, China, and Russia. During
his campaign for presidency his opponents gave his
long absence from this country as a reason for his not
being fit for the position.

Today, nearly everyone will agree that this was an

sylvania Railroad by the Dravo Corporation is this

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER MAY, I954

excellent background for the president of the United
States. Hoover knew many people in foreign lands
as well as their problems, inasmuch as he had worked
with them in developing their industry.

As a public servant, Herbert Hoover served his
country in many other ways besides being President.
To name a few: he was chairman of the Commission
for Relief in Belgium, 1915-19; U.S. Food Adminis-
trator for Europe, 1817-19; chairman o-f the U.S. Grain
Corporation; the U.S. Sugar Equalization Board; In-
terallied Food Council; European Coal Council; chair-
man of American Relief Administration; chairman of
President Wilson’s Industrial Conference. He was
Secretary of Commerce under Harding and Coolidge;
chairman of Colorado River Commission; chairman
of President’s Conference on Unemployment; and
many other activities. At the request of President
Truman, he undertook the coordination of world food
supplies of 38 countries; also he developed a plan for
the reorganization of the Federal Government. He
made a study of the economic situation in Germany
and Austria; member of Advisory Board, World Bank
Reconstruction and Development after World War
II.

Certainly these activities can not be called mater-
ialistic unless feeding of people dislocated by one of
the greatest world conflicts can be considered as such.
It is most fortunate that Hoover has lived to see his
works gain the respect and understanding of the
American people, which he so thoroughly deserves.

The engineering student should be conscious of his
responsibility to society and there is no better example
than the public service of Herbert Hoover. More en-
gineers should be interested and be placed in govern-
mental work at the level where their engineering
training can be felt.

When it is evident that a product may cause unem-
ployment in some locality, the engineer should help
establish employment and training in the new field
in order to reduce the impact of the change on the
people involved.

Editors Note: This article is an excerpt from a talk
given by William P. Snyder Ill, president of the Alle-
gheny Conference on Community Development, at the
Engineering and Mines assembly in Soldiers and Sail-
ors Memorial Hall on March 17. It is an outline of the
Pittsburgh redevelopment story.

Without the knowledge of modern engineering
principles and the competent, trained engineers to
apply them, the tremendous physical changes that
have taken place, and are still in progress here in
Pittsburgh, could not be carried out.

The Pittsburgh district with its Vast industries is

still today the world’s greatest center of heavy indus—_

try, and this fact alone makes this area an extremely
favorable place for the engineer to locate. While
Pittsburgh has always been a good place to make a
living, in the past it was not a very good place to
live and raise a family.

An organization was needed to provide the vehicle
to study the various problems the city faced and
develop a program. We had to have an agency that
would be private and non-partisan in character—that
could work with private enterprise and with the
Republicans and Democrats, and the state, and the
county and the city.

The Allegheny Conference on Community Devel-
opment was established to perform this role. The
conference realized from the first that the age-old
problem of smoke had to be solved, if Pittsburgh was
to maintain its position as headquarters of some of the
nation’s leading corporations, hold its industrial rank,
and attract new business and industry.

A fully effective smoke control program is in effect
in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. The results
s eak for themselves. Pittsburgh is unquestionably
t e nation’s cleanest industrial community. Official
figures of the U.S. Weather Bureau show that today
the city is 69 per cent cleaner than it was before smoke
control. Industry in Allegheny county has spent over
$200,000,000 in advancing the program.

It is in the field of urban redevelopment that Pitts-
burgh has gained nation-wide recognition. This pro-
gram begins in the Point area—in the 60 acres at the
very heart of the city where it was founded almost
200 years ago. Two projects are underway here.

The first is Point Park———a state financed project
which will restore the beauty and perpetuate the
historical significance of this renowned “Gateway to
the West.” The park covers an area of 86 acres and
will have recreational and cultural facilities that will
make it a natural attraction.

An elaborate interchange will be built to connect
the two existing river boulevards with the new street
pattern in the lower triangle. Two new double—deck

ridges will be constructed across the river. Con-
struction work began early in March on the substruc-
ture for the new Fort Pitt Bridge on the Monongahela.

In the 23 acres adjacent to Point Park is Gateway
Center—the new business development built by the
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. Follow-
ing the fire of 1946 when the main facilities of the
Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railroad were destroy-
ed, a group from the Executive Committee of the Al-
legheny Conference interested the Equitable Life in

building this modern business district. The problem
of acquiring this 23 acre tract which was held by
many different owners and often in small parcels,
was met by establishing the Urban Redevelopment
Authority. _

Pittsburgh’s Urban Redevelopment Authority ac-
quired the property for Equitable Life. There are no
public funds or subsidies in this project. Equitable
Life paid the full cost for the land, which amounted
to about $11,000,000. The company has invested $32,
000,000 in the three buildings that have been con-
structed to date. Additional structures will be built
in Gateway in the future.

The State of Pennsylvania has authorized the con-
struction of a State office building in the Gateway
area, across from the Pittsburgh Press. This building
will centralize the State’s operations in Western Penn-
sylvania. There is also the possibility that a new hotel

will be built in Gateway. Perhaps an Engineering

Building to house the headquarters of the parent en-

gineering societies will be erected here——if they

should vote to come to Pittsburgh.

As you know, the four founder societies,—the AIEE,
ASCE, ASME and AIME,—and other leading techni-
cal groups are looking for a new location. A million

' dollars—perhaps more—-is waiting for the Societies if
they will select Pittsburgh for their site. This money
would be available in cash and could be used to

cover a portion of the cost of the new building.
The redevelopment of the lower triangle gave im-
petus to the revitalization of the Upper Triangle. And
since 1948 the 41 story U.S. Steel Mellon Bank Build-
ing and the Alcoa skyscrapers were built—anchoring
the headquarters of two of the nation’s largest corpo-
rations in Pittsburgh for years to come. Two modern
hotels were constructed, the first modern downtown
dwelling units—the Carlton House and the Bigelow.
And now Kaufmann’s deparrnent store is building a

12 story addition to its Fifth Avenue store at a cost

of $12,000,000.

You may wonder why so much emphasis has been
placed on the Triangle. Pittsburgh’s Triangle is the
financial, business and retail center of the whole Tri-
State district and one of the nation’s principal central
business districts. It is the economic heart of the re-

gion. Like a human organism, unless the heart is
healthy and sound the rest of the body is drastically
affected. Today the Triangle is thriving—thanks to
redevelopment. ‘

Civil engineers and traffic technicians -from all parts
of the United States and abroad have visited Pitts-
burgh in the last several years to inspect and study the
construction work on the Penn-Lincoln Parkway. The
U.S. Bureau of Roads has said that it is the most com-
plex urban expressway ever constructed. As you
know, it is being built by the State Highway Depart-
ment to carry routes N o. 22 and N o. 30 into and
through Pittsburgh.

With the eastern and western sections open to traf-
fic, the downtown interchange from Bates Street to
the Point is well in construction. It will take several
years to complete because it involves the relocation of
the Baltimore and Ohio railroad tracks, relocating
Second Avenue and other major construction prob-
ems.

The Parkway connects with existing Fort Pitt
Boulevard along the Monongahela River, where the
present B. & 0. station stands. That station, the train
shed and warehouse will be razed and those facilities
will be rebuilt in the plot near the Post-Gazette.

Another set of tunnels similar to the Squirrel Hill
tubes will be constructed under Mt. Washington by
the Pennsylvania Tunnel Commission.

It would be hard to overestimate the importance
of the Parkway to Pittsburgh. It affords direct access
to the Pennsylvania Turnpike via routes No. 22 and
No. 30 in the east and also provides a direct connec-
tion with the new Greater Pittsburgh Airport, making

it one of the most accessible airports to a central .

business district in this country. This $33,000,000 air-
port is one of the world’s largest and another major
accomplishment in Pittsburgh’s renaissance.

Speaking of highways, I also want to mention the
importance of the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the eco-
nomic growth of Pittsburgh and the whole state.
More and more goods and products are being shipped
by motor freight, and studies indicate that the trend
will continue. Because of the advantages the Turn-
pike offe-rs, new industries and enterprises have
moved into the Keystone State at an impressive rate.

For example, the new central research laboratory
of Westinghouse Electric is being built on a 70 acre
site in Churchill Borough, within easy access of the
Parkway and Turnpike. United States Steel and Pitts-
burgh Plate Glass Company are both building re-
search laboratories in the eastern part of the state.

The Allegheny Conference has mapped a $150,000,
000 highway program for this area during the next
seven to ten years. This includes such vital projects
as the Pittsburgh extension of the Ohio River Boule-
vard. The widening of this main artery in the vicinity
of Glenfield is now well underway. The relocation of
routes No. 8 and No. 28 form Blawknox to Etna is
another big project. This job will get started this
Spring.

A Crosstown Thorofare from the Liberty Bridge
to Fort Duquesne Boulevard at Eleventh Street is
planned, and the first phase to Bigelow Boulevard
is scheduled to begin next year in connection with
the Grant Street interchange of the Parkway and the
Lower Hill development. Ulitmately a high level
bridge will be constructed across the Allegheny River
and East Street will be improved to the point where
it joins McKnight Road.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER MAY, 1954

McKnight Road has now been extended north to

connect with the Perry Highway. The plan is to build
a north-south route through Allegheny County—just
as the Penn Lincoln Parkway is an east-west highway.

From this sketchy outline of the future highway pro-
gram, it is quite obvious that there will be a great
deal of work for the civil engineers in this area.

Perhaps the most challenging project for tomorrow
is the rebuilding of the Lower Hill. This 105 acre
tract lying to the east of the Triangle is strategically
situated between the central business district and the
Oakland Cultural Center. ‘

The Allegheny Conference prepared a compre-
hensive land use plan for this area which includes a
site for a combined auditorium to house the civic
light opera, a sports arena and convention hall. There
are also sites for a symphony grand opera hall, other
cultural institutions, and park apartment homes.

Probably the first structure to be built there will be

the combined public auditorium. It will be unique.
A retractable roof will give it multiple usage. In the
summer time with the roof folded back it will be an
amphitheatre for the operettas. In the fall and winter
with the roof closed it can be usedas a sports arena
or convention hall. A stage and ice rink on an eleva-
tor-type structure will permit them to be raised and
lowered as needed.
_ As an all—weather, allpurpose auditorium, we be-
lieve it can pay for itself and will not be a “white
elephant” on the taxpayers as so many elaborate con-
vention halls are.

A Municipal Auditorium Authority has been crea-
ted to build and operate this unique building. Mr.
Edgar ]. Kaufmann has already pledged one million
dollars toward it, and Ge-neral Somervell heads the
Authority and will endeavor to raise another two
million dollars from private sources. The city and
County are expected to contribute a total of three
million dollars. That makes six million dollars. The
additional two million that will be required will be
financed by revenue bonds issued by the Authority.

It is very possible that the area will be cleared
and this new structure will be in operation in time
for the Bi-Centennial Celebration in 1958.

The Pittsburgh Story is much more than just stone
and steel and cement. A cultural and educational
development is going on hand in hand with the phys-
ical rebuilding.

Here at the University of Pittsburgh a new engi-
neering building is underway, as you well know.
Ground will be broken for a new science hall this
spring. The plans for the further_development of the
University Health Center will make Pittsburgh a
wor d leader in the medical field. Through the work
of r. Salk and other medical research physicians,
the University has achieved world renown.

Across the way at Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology the new Graduate School of Industrial Ad-
ministration is opening up new job opportunities for
engineers and college graduates.

Duquesne University will use the vehicle of the
Urban Redevelopment Authority to enlarge its cam-
pus on The Bluff and carry out a $12,000,000 expan-
sion program.

Property across from the Children’s Hospital will
be acquired in the same way for the new Graduate
School of Public Health, the Pitt campus expansion
of athletic facilities will also be acquired through Ur-

Editors Note: This is the fifth of a series of articles on
some of the industrial giants of Pittsburgh, pointing
out to students the opportunities for engineers in
Pittsburgh, —the future engineering center of the
world.

The location of the main plant, shipyard, and
office of the Dravo Corporation, on Neville Island in
the Ohio River near Pittsburgh, is significant for the
company’s operations. Many of the company’s activ-
ities are for, on, and along the waterways of the coun-
try.

Dravo Corporation is the largest inland shipbuilder
in the United States. One of its subsidiaries—Union
Barge Line Corporation-—operates river fleets on the
entire Mississippi river system and Gulf intra-coastal
waterways. The Contracting Division builds locks,
dams, docks, bridge substructures, and similar proj-
ects in and along the inland waters. The companys
Keystone Division dredges and markets sand and
gravel from the river bottom and uses it also for ready-
mixed concrete

The Engineering Works Division, in addition to its
shipbuilding and repair operations, constructs cranes
and giant unloading e uipment, such as bridges and
towers for handling bu k materials, which are widely
used on river, lake and ocean docks and by various
industries.

Only the company’s Machinery Division, with head-
quarters in the Dravo Building, Pittsburgh, operates

mainly on dry i-arid. The division builds among other
things, large air conditioning and space-heating in-
stallations as well as generating, pumping and gas
compressor stations. It markets and erects a great
variety of equipment made by other manufacturers,
including ash and dust handling equipment, condens-
ers and cooling towers, conveyor equipment, indus-
trial stokers, turbines, and water and waste disposal
equipment.

Other activities of the four main divisions and the
five subsidiaries include sale and rental of construc-
tion equipment, digging tunnels, fabrication and in-
stallation of piping systems, manufacture of large
steel containers for ocean shipment of piece goods,
and the operation of a toll bridge.

Variety is not only the spice, but the backbone
of this Corporation. The company rests firmly on the
diversity and ingenuity of its engineering skill. It
attracts engineers who look for variety rather than
specialization, and for a happy combination of prac-
tical and theoretical work.

For its manifold activities, it hires graduates of
every field of engineering, including naval architects
and mechanical, civil and electrical engineers. The
company has a very thorough recruiting program. In
addition to a special recruiting officer, an executive
of the operating division that needs new personnel
will frequently take part in the interviews. Company
officials consider the selection of new engineering
personnel one of their most important functions. They
avoid a half-hearted employer-employee relationship
that is neither bad enough to terminate nor good
enough to make both parties happy.

After a brief orientation on the overall activities
of the company, a young engineer is usually succes-
sively assigned for a few months each to some of the
more important projects. He will do practical work
on an actual job under the supervision and instruction
of an experienced senior engineer. Of the two schools
of thought—theoretical training programs versus prac-
tical learning—Dravo stands firmly on the side of the
practical doers. Company officials believe that the
type of engineer they need does not wish to continue
a classroom routine after having followed one for
many years. They feel there is no better way to ac-
quire skill, achievement and overall knowledge than
by doing diverse jobs at least once.

There is no set pattern for the periods of training
time that a young engineer spends on each project.
Very much depends on his own demonstration of
ability, on the rate of his progress and on the op-
portunities that open within the company. There is
the extreme case of a young engineer who, after two
months with the company, became project engineer
on the construction of a flood control dam. The general
rule is an extensive all-around training before a man
is assigned to an independent, responsible position.

It is a great satisfaction to its engineers that, in con-
trast to assembly-line production, their creative work
is usually non-repetitious and remains as a durable
and familiar feature or landmark. Most of the many
river craft that pass Neville Island every day either
have been built at their shipyards or repaired on their
marine ways, which rate among the most modern
of the country. The new four-lane bridge across the
back—channel of the Ohio River, which will give better
access to Dravo headquarters on Neville Island, will
be supported by a Dravo-built substructure. Pitts-
burgh’s improvement program includes many of the
companies works, among them the new Gateway Cen-
ter river wall and wharf at the apex of the Golden Tri-
angle. A number of locks and dams on the Mononga-
hela River, “the busiest little river in the world,” are
Dravo-built. The new Elrama Power Station of the
Duquesne Light Company is a witness for industrial
beauty as well as for achievement.

Modern industrial design and latest engineering features are com-
bined in the Elrama Power Station. The plant as well as the river
clock and coal unloading facilities were built by Dravo.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER l MAY, 1954

The Elrama Power Station is also typical of the kind
of “package contract” that the versatile and compre-
hensive engineering organization of the company is
able to undertake. The company not only built the
power station itself—a complex installation of boilers,
turbines, piping instruments and other equipment—
but it also constructed the river side dock and the un-
loading facilities which include an unloading tower,
a barge-hauling system, coal stackers, conveyors, trav-
eling trippers and automatic weighing equipment.

Another multi—million dollar package contract
which made headlines recently and is now in process,
was received from McLouth Steel Corporation for its
Trenton, Michigan mills. Dravo is furnishing and
building a new river dock, two 12-ton ore—handling
bridges, and complete facilities for new boilers and
turbo-blowers. The work includes design, fabrication
and erection of all plant piping; furnishing and instal-
lation of switch gear for handling primary voltages;
and furnishing erecting pumps for the main mill water
supply and for a 4000-KW-generator unit.

Such package contracts require good team work by
the main divisions of the company. For the McLouth
contract, for instance, a great part of the equipment is
prefabricated and assembled in the fabricating and
machine shops of the Engineering Works Division.
Dravo was the first company to fully weld the main
structural members of giant ore bridges, such as the
bridge legs, trucks and operating trolleys. All founda-
tion and dock work at the McLouth installation will
be performed by the Contracting Division, while pip-
ing and pumping equipment will be furnished and
installed by the Machinery Division.

An outstanding indoor job of the Machinery Divis-
ion is the installation of the unique panel heating and
cooling system in the new Alcoa building in Pitts‘-
burgh. This system requires no radiators or conven-
tional air conditioning units around the walls and has
saved space equivalent to one and a half floors in the
Alcoa building. On each floor, aluminum ceiling pan-
els are attached to half-inch aluminum pipe grids sus-
pended from turnbuckles. Hot water is circulated
through the pipes in winter and cooling water in
summer. Primary air fans are installed in the base-
ment, on the 14th floor and in a roof penthouse to

supply ventilated, cool air. comimnd an mm "9.

Dravo air conditioning, ventilating and “Counter-
flo” heating systems have found many important in-
dustrial uses. Air conditioning has been installed in
crane cabs of steel mills to provide cooling in summer,
heating in winter and a removal of dust, gas fumes
and odors from the cab. “Counterflo” space heaters
provide a more even winter temperature in large steel
mills. Heating and ventilating systems, by speeding
up drying processes, have doubled the output of pot-
teries producing vitreous china plumbing fixtures.

Ingeunity and engineering progress are essential to
the survival and continued growth of any engineering
company. Among the ‘many “firsts” introduced by the
Dravo Corporation is the integrated coal barge fleet,
a new conception in river towing. The river barges
are built with one rake, or formed end and one square,
box-like end. A number of them fit together to form
one solid towing unit. The arrangement lessens tow-
ing resistance and provides more space for cargo.

The company’s Keystone Division introduced the
first commercial production of river gravel by a new
“heavy media” process that removes objectionable
particles, such as “soft” gravel, porous stones and for-
eign matter, and improves the quality of the gravel
used for making concrete.

A view of Dravo’s machine shop located on Neville Island near
Pittsburgh.

The Corporation constructed carriage assemblies
for the Army’s new atomic cannon. The engineering
details were so complex that 2200 different bluebrints
and 86 military and industrial specifications were in-
volved. Army services also included building the first
towboat with vertical axis propellers. They consist
of vertical blades fitted on a flat rotor. They make a
rudder superfluous and can turn a boat “on the spot,”
by delivering maximum thrust in any of the 360 de-
grees of a circle.

Twenty-two giant floating cranes recently built for
the Navy, continue a long harmonious relationship
with this service branch. During World War II, ship-
building represented 70% of Dravo’s total war pro-
duction. The company’s production methods for per-
sonnel carriers, based on previous experience with
mass production methods for inland river craft, were

used for the basic production plan by which most of
the NaVy’s total LST fleet was built.

Two brothers, Francis Rouaud and Ralph Marshall
Dravo, were the founders of the original F. R. Dravo
and Company in 1891. They were joined by Thomas
E. Doyle, whose name is carried on in the Dravo-
Doyle Company, a subsidiary of the resent corpora-
tion. Beginning only with the sale of eavy industrial
machinery, the three partners soon found that build-
ing foundations would be an asset to their business.
Foundation work led to more extensive construction
work. When the Keystone Sand and Supply Company
was organized to produce sand and gravel for the con-
struction activities, and machine shop facilities were
added, the organization of the company became ba-
sically that of the present corporation. In 1937 the
Corporation was re-organized as an operating com-
pany with four major divisions and several subsidia-
ries. Disregarding the exceptional war years, the cor-
poration’s activities have shown a steady increase, and
billings in 1953 were more than three times higher
than in 1946.

Dravo Corporation is optimistic about its future.
Two branches of its activities serve rapidly expanding
markets: river transportation and air conditioning.
With improved waterways, an increasing number of
new industries are growing up along the rivers of the

-nation. Especially for bulk cargoes, water is the

cheapest medium of transportation. Chemicals, steel,
petroleum, fertilizers, ores, coal and grain are largely
carried on inland and intra-costal waterways. Many
of these cargoes need special barges, for which the
Dravo Corporation is the leading shipyard. Increased
river activities also require new docks, locks, dams
and bridges. In short, the field is wide open.

Industrial air—conditioning, ventilating and space-
heating, on the other hand, have long been regarded
as much more than a mere convenience. Being among
the leaders, Dravo should offer a wide scope and a
bright future to its engineers working in this field.
The variety of the company’s other activities is just
as promising.

“It’s a rugged business, at times,” an old-time Dravo
engineer remarked, “often full of sweat and tears-
but never without satisfaction.”

After having spent three years in Engineering
School at Pitt I can now look back on my.ideas as a
high school student regarding an engineering educa-
tion and answer some questions I might have asked.

One of the biggest surprises to me was how much
different college education is from high school. I

feund that a student in college is almost entirely on

his own. He has a different schedule every day and
is required to take only about 25 hours of classes and
laboratories each week. The rest of the time is his
own, but since there are no study periods as in the
high schools, he must devise his own schedule for

study. There are no report cards, home rooms or ab- .

scence excuse slips. What the college student does is
his own responsibility and his success depends on his

habits.

Upon entering college I became acquainted with
a new technique in learning. I was expected to read
the textbooks, but in addition, the teacher often lec-
tured from his personal experiences, and from other
books and technical papers to add to the information.
Lectures and discussion in college are equally as im-
portant as the textbooks, and the emphasis is placed
on logical thinking. The students are encouraged to
combine facts with theory in order to later design
equipment and develop processes.

I also found that not all my courses were technical.
Such courses as English, including report writing
and speech, are bound to be useful to me in the future
and will enable me to write and deliver technical
papers. I have also taken courses in economics and
business administration and have been allowed to
schedule almost a semester’s work in courses of my
own choosing.

I was pleased to see that nearly all the classes were
small and informal. In engineering subjects classes
usually have less than 25 students and give the indi-
vidual an opportunity to ask questions and take part
in discussions. Enrollment in laboratories is even
smaller and often the entire class works together in
performing an experiment. These courses help him to
solve problems and correct any misunderstandings
through working with actual engineering equipment.

Because grades are issued only at the end of the
semester, I had to determine for myself how well I

was doing in my classes. Each usually has three or
four tests and numerous quizzes each semester which
serve as good indicators. But when there is any doubt,
the instructor can always be consulted.

I learned that many prospective engineering stu-
dents could not be admitted to engineering school be-
cause they did not take the right subjects in high
school. As early as possible the high school student
should become acquainted with the entrance require-
ments of engineering schools to make sure he is taking
the required subjects.

When I first entered school I still wasn’t quite sure
which engineering field to take. It was a big help to
find that since all students take the same schedule the
first year, I still had a year to make my final decision.

Many find it necessary or desirable to get part-time
work to help support them in college, and I was no
exception. My job turned out to be profitable in an
educational way, as it offered practical engineering
experience, too. These jobs can be found in Pitts-
burgh more easily than in most college centers. Some
students work right on the campus but many others
are employed in industry. Particularly during the
summer months most engineering students find full
time employment with an industrial concern where
they get valuable experience while replacing regular
engineers who are on vacation.

Naturally no one works and studies all of the time,
nor even most of the time. I found that activities are
an important part of a well rounded education, as well
as a lot of fun, and that the college provides the place
and opportunity for them. At Pitt there are more than
100 organizations. There are clubs devoted to pho-
tography, dramatics, skiing, square dancing, and al-
most anything that might appeal to a number of stu-
dents. Fraternities and sororities are prime movers in
college social life, and there are many such social,
professional, and honorary organizations on the cam-
pus.

In addition there are the animal events such as En-
gineer’s Week, with its engineering displays and
social. affairs honoring Saint Patrick, patron saint of
engineers; and the week-long Spring Carnival, with
dozens of shows and games in true carnival style.
Both are produced by the college students and pro-
vide plenty of entertainment for everyone.

I’m enjoying my four years of engineering school.
It’s giving me a great experience as well as the means
for earning a living. I hope you’ll try it too.

The engineer is first of all a scientist and, as such,
he receives considerable training in chemistry, mathe-
matics and physics. In addition, he learns the art of
making those sciences of some use to mankind
through courses which teach him methods of reducing
science to practice. Some of these courses are applied
mechanics, strength of materials, machine design,
plant layout, applied electricity, and power plant en-
gineering. These are sometimes called the engineer-
ing sciences and distinguish the engineer from any
other type of technically-trained personnel. These

courses enable him to take a new scientific idea or‘

theory, make a first model or pilot plant and then pro-
duce the'material or product for the benefit of the
public.

Besides the natural science courses and the engi-
neering sciences mentioned above, the engineer today
also receives appreciable training in the social scien-
ces, humanities, and liberal arts. These courses broad-
en his outlook and make him aware of his responsi-
bility in relationship to the public. Combined with
the science and engineering courses, this educational
program is responsible for the development of engi-
neers into positions as superintendents, managers, and
other top executives of industrial companies.

Today engineering is rapidly approaching the full

   
   
  

  

 

status of a profession. Practically all states of the
Union now require the engineer to be registered like
the doctor or the lawyer. it is essential to license the
professional engineer in order to guard against un-
qualified persons who might construct bridges, auto-

mobiles, airplanes, and many other public convey-

ances, only to have them collapse due to faulty design
or materials. The engineer has become the guardian
of public safety.

The training of a scientist has different aims and ob-
jectives than that of the engineer. The scientist is
trained to observe natural phenomena with the ob-
jectives of reaching conclusions as to their expected
behavior. He is not concerned with the practical
applications of his discovery nor is he held responsi-

ble for the safety of the public in this connection.

The technician who is trainedxin some of the ap-
plied sciences, knows the “how” of the processes he
controls but not necessarily the “why.” This distin-
guishes the technician from the engineer, who is fa-
miliar with both the “how” and the “why,” as well as

the best way in which the process can be accom-
plished.

The engineer must take the findings of the scientist,
design equipment for its use, and teach the technician
how to make it.

N engineering senior can hardly be blamed for feel-
A ing rambunctious now that the years of hard
study are nearly over and the sheepskin’s in view.

But the sheepskin comes at Commencement. Commence-
ment means you’re set to start on your career. And that’s
certainly worth some serious thought.

To help you decide which job to pick, you’d do well to
weigh the many reasons for choosing an engineering

0 At GM, an engineer has a real chance to follow his
natural bent and work in the field of his choice. That’s
because GM produces a variety of products — automo-
biles, trucks, Diesel engines, refrigerators, bombsights,
just to mention a few.

0 At GM, you get the chance to work closely with top
engineers, sharing their knowledge and experience.
That’s owing to GM’s decentralization: 34 manufactur-
ing divisions, 117 plants in 57 towns and cities. Yet
each division draws upon GM’s vast central research
laboratories.

0 At GM, there’s a congenial climate for the personal
and professional advancement of engineers. We respect

the original “Department of Engineering” from which
the first students graduated in 1846.

For more than one hundred years Pitt’s Civil en-

of buildings, bridges, roads, railways, dams, tunnels,
water and sewage systems.

Tubes and wires,

Motors and pliers,

That’s what Electrical

Engineers are made of.

You may ask: What is Electrical Engineering?
Electrical Engineering is particularly concerned with
the apparatus and processes by which energy is taken
from various sources, such as falling water and the
burning of coal, and through the medium of electrici-
ty ‘is made to reappear as light, heat, sound or motion.

The question which gave rise to the whole field of
electrical engineering could possibly have been: Is it
possible to have every home lighted economically by
means of electric power? Is it possible for human
speech to be transmitted from place to place without
the benefit of wires? If the two previous questions can
be answered how can man control and regulate the
available power? In the solutions to these problems
the early experimenters and men of science have laid
the groundwork for modern electrical wonders.

The first phase, power engineering, considers the
generation, transmission and distribution of electrical
power. Upon it rests all other phases of electrical
engineering. _

The electronic or vacuum tube was the answer t
the second question. It is a marvelous device, through
which man has been able to circle the globe with his
voice and with television extend the range of his al-
ready marvelous eyesight. It makes possible the per-
forming of other amazing operations with a precision
and certainty that are astounding. _

Control, the third phase of electrical engineering
had its start when electricity itself was discovered.
From the very beginning a means was provided for
the starting and stopping of the flow of electricity.
Today in the home a large amount of electrical power
is controlled by merely snapping a switch. Control
circuits properly designed use small amounts of power
to regulate much larger amounts. Considering todays
gigantic machines and processes it would be i1npossi—
ble indeed for any one man to perform the physical
tasks involved within the limitations of his own
strength. Therefore through the use of electronic
circuits, mechanical devices and very frequenly a
combination of the two, only a trifling amount of en-
ergy is required to control ships, locomotives, power
plants, mills, presses and machines of all types.

These three concepts: power, electronics, and con-
trol are studied in electrical engineering.

The fundamental concepts and laws that govern the
functions of the even yet undiscovered, are taught so
that the electrical engineer will be able to devise and
design new electrical wonders of the world.

OIL SAMPL|NG——Samples of oil producing sands are taken when a
well is drilled into the oil reservoir. These samples must be brought
to the laboratory for measurements which will permit an estimation
of how much oil the well should produce. David C. Jodie, McKees-
port High '50, is shown extracting the oil and water from oil bearing
sandstone by means of the Soxhlet extractor in preparation for
measurement of the pore volumn of the sample.

 

SUMMER WORK—It is essential that engineers be able to apply the
theory which they learn in the classrooms to practical field problems.
One of the requirements for graduation from this department is the
completion of a summer of work in an oil or gas producing field.
William Leach, Oliver High '49, Pitt '53, obtained his summer field
experience by working for a maior oil company in Wyoming. The
picture shows him in front of a deep well pump.

The Petroleum Engineering Department at Pitt
was the first to be established in the United States.
The first courses in oil and gas production were
taught here in 1910 and the first petroleum engineer-
ing degrees were conferred in 1914. At the present
time there are but sixteen accredited petroleum en-
gineering departments in the entire country. The
undergraduate enrollment in the department has al-
ways been held to about 125 students, thus giving
opportunity for close personal contact between the
departmental faculty and the students.

Because of wide distribution of oil operations, the
graduates of this department are perhaps more widely
scattered than those of any other engineering depart-
ments in the University. More than 700 alumni are
scattered through twenty-seven oil producing states
and eight foreign countries. Over a dozen are now
Presidents or Operating Vice Presidents of Oil Com-
panies.

OPERATION PLANNlNG—ln planning the operation of an oil field, it
is highly important to know how the oil will move through the pores
of the reservoir rock into the well. Delicate and complex apparatus
is necessary to make these measurements. John D. McSteen, Mt. Leb-
anon High '50, and Martin L. Roberts, Peabody High '51, are making
relative permeability measurements on an oil reservoir rock.

was established in 1940. The curriculum of this de-
partment contains the fundamentals of engineering
with the emphasis on Geology. For the first two years
the program is the same as -that of the Petroleum En-
gineering Department after which it branches to its
own field. There are at the present time fourteen ac-
credited Geological Engineering Departments in the
United States of which Pitt is the only accredited one
in Pennsylvania and one of two in the Eastern United
States. Most of the Graduates find employment in the
oil and gas industries, although some are engaged in
mining and highway construction work. The depart-
ment is under the administration of the Petroleum
Engineering Staff.

 

FLUID PROPERTIES—Modern oil wells are drilled to depths of over
three miles into the earth. This drilling process involves the appli-
cation of several branches of engineering. The successful drilling
of these deep wells is frequently dependent upon the properties ol
the special drilling fluids used to carry the rock cuttings out of the
hole. In this view, Regis J. Ritchie, North Catholic High '44, Donald
J. Pfau, North Huntington Township High '51 and Paul W. Schaub,
Penn High '51, are measuring one of the important properties of

PITTSBURGH

UNIVERSITY OF

Industrial engineering, as a recognized division 0-f
the engineering profession, is relatively young. About
the time of World War 1, industry and engineering
schools recognized the need for specialized study in
this field. To meet this need the University of Pitts-
burgh, in 1921, organized a department with a course
of study leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in
Industrial Engineering. This Department of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh is one of thirty accredited in the
United States.

Industrial engineering is an appealing and chal-
lenging profession for young men with interests in
engineering and scientific studies, and with the desire
to work in the field of industrial management. The
industrial engineer uses proven techniques in his work
of seeking the best way to manufacture more and bet-
ter products at a lower cost. This objective is gained
by examining the influence of product design on the
manufacturing process. Methods engineering, which
is a means of establishing a standard precedure for
the best means of producing a product, assists in at-
taining the goal. New and improved plant layouts
expedite the flow and handling of the materials and
products in industry. After a product is designed, a
method of manufacture devised, the plant and
equipment located, the production workers hired and
the method and rate of pay established, there still ex-
ists the problem of scheduling men, machines, and
materials to obtain the desired product at the right
time in the right quantity and quality. Production
planning, production control, and employee pay sys-
tem based on production standards coupled with
quality control techniques are used by the industrial
engineer as management controls.

A career in industrial engineering will lead into
many different areas, all-closely related and depend-
ent upon each other in the quest for solutions to the
basic problem of better design, more effective use of
equipment and man power to manufacture more and
better products at a lower cost.

In order to qualify for work of this type, the indus-
trial engineer is well grounded in basic engineering
subjects with additional studies in statistics, cost_ ac-
counting, economics, business law, and specialized
courses in industrial engineering.

Since the founding of the Industrial Engineering
Department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1921,
approximately 1,000 students with this type“ of train-
ing have been graduated with the degree of Bachelor
of Science in Industrial Engineering.” These students
have found employment in the industries of Western
Pennsylvania and surrounding states and many of
them have advanced to managerial positions.

O Cort Kegley received his Masters Degree in
Physics from Connecticut Wesleyan in 195 1.

When the above picture was taken he had
been on the job less than a month, and was one
of a group of young graduates then in training
at Allison.

Much of the experimental and test equipment
at Allison is entirely different from any other.
And, Cort—like other new engineers on the job
—must ﬁrst learn about these various facilities
which he will be using in instrumentation and
testing. ‘

He is pictured here getting acquainted, so to
speak, with some of the equipment used in
vibration and shock qualiﬁcation testing. One
of the many electronic accessory units used with
the Allison jet engines is here undergoing a
“shake test” on the large MB vibration exciter
shown in the foreground.

A turbo-propeller governor is bolted to the
shake table of the exciter, which is controlled
from the panel at the left, to determine if simu-
lated engine vibration will cause the unit to
malfunction. The large MB exciter has the ca-
pacity to exert a vibratory force of 2 500 pounds,
with a frequency range up to 500 CPS. A smaller
MB exciter, shown on the bench in the back-
ground, is rated at 50 pounds peak force avail-
able to 2000 CPS.

Mechanical Engineers design products and super-
vise the maintenance and operation of many kinds of
industrial plants. When power is generated or a ma-
chine or mechanism is designed and tested, the abili—
ties of the Mechanical Engineer are required. De—
pending upon the field which he chooses, his work
may range from the design and development of a
latching mechanism for securing refrigerator doors to
the determination of the forces acting upon the red
hot blades of a gas turbine. His background often
provides an excellent foundation for a career in ad-
ministrative and executive positions in industry.

The Mechanical Engineering curriculum teaches
the basic fundamentals in the early phases of study.
The advanced courses concerning the Principal Sub-

Valuable minerals and fuels are rarely found in the
form and purity necessary for consumer use. The
mineral preparation engineer must treat the extracted
ore to increase its usefulness. He must have a thor-
ough knowledge of the physical and chemical theo-
ries involved and the magnitude of the ranges and
safety factors that must be used in applying them to
the design and operation of mineral processing plants.

raw materials and fuels. Mining involves the appli-
cation of many engineering principles in the extract-
ing of various minerals and coal from the earth. A
mining engineer may become a mine operator or a

machinery. He also may become expert in the hand-

Because Pittsburgh is located in a great mining
area, graduate mining engineers from the University
of Pittsburgh have found employment right at

very great in the rest of the country and throughout
the world, particularly in South America.

Mining engineers are among the highest paid in
the engineering profession. .

There are many advantages in the Engineeri
Mines Schools at Pitt. Some of these may be well

worth recounting. In the first place these schools are »

a part of a great university. This is a distinct advant-
age in that it permits the students of the Schools of

‘Engineering and Mines to take elective courses from

many other branches of the University such as in The
College and the School of Business Administration.
This is not enioyed by engineering schools which are
not associated with a university and its many divi-
sions.

Another advantage of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines at Pitt is its location. Here in the heart of

PLACE IN E

In the early schools of engineering the courses were
usually of short duration and were established to up-
grade the trades. The first formal education in mining
engineering was established at F reiberg, Germany, in
1765, and probably the first engineering school was
established in France as Ecole des Ponte et Chausses
in 1775. Twelve years later a college called the Pitts-
burgh Academy, the nucleus for the University of
Pittsburgh, was established in the American wilder-
ness.

Engineering education in Great Britain did not start
formally until the establishment of a civil engineering
chair at the University of Glasgow in 1840. A govern-
ment School of Mines was later established in London
in 1851. 1

Actually, formal engineering education as we know
it today was not started in the various countries until
the latter part of the 1800’s. It was not until about
1880 that the English universities were willing to ac-
cept this newer branch of learning. -

In this country, West Point began to develop formal
instruction in military engineering as early as 1817.
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, New York,
introduced studies of an engineering character in
1825, although a regular curriculum in civil engi-
neering was not developed before 1839.

The Western University of Pennsylvania (now The
University of Pittsburgh) graduated two civil engi-
neers in 1846. Dartmouth College in 1851 established
the Chandler Scientific School intended to be a school
of the industrial vocations. Schools like Harvard and
Yale did not introduce engineering courses until about
1852, and the first engineers were graduated from
Harvard in 1854. The first American School of Mines
was established at Columbia in 1864 and Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology was established in 1868.

In the early eighteen hundreds, certain changes
took place in the Pittsburgh Academy which changed
its name to Western University of Pennsylvania. En-
gineering courses were started and in 1846 two men
were graduated as civil engineers. In 1865 a chair of
engineering was established in this University, and

one of ‘the reatest engineering centers of th world:
the University of Pittsburgh has the excellent associa-
tion and cooperation of many of the industries in this
district.

With the city of Pittsburgh progressing as it is
today, the future of the Schools of Engineering and
Mines at Pitt will be exemplified by increasing use-
fulness to this district. A recent survey of the under-
graduate students indicated that some eighty per cent
are from the Pittsburgh area and that some sixty per
cent remain in Pittsburgh after graduation. This is
typical of the service which has been rendered by
the Schools of Engineering and Mines to the indus-
tries in this area.

  

the first professor to teach ‘mining engineeringas
appointed in 1869.

The modern development of the School of Engi-
neering at the University started when Prefesser
Daniel Carhart became the professor of civil engi-
neering in 1882. The records indicate that engineer-
ing ceased to be a department and became a school
in 1882, at which time Dr. Carhart was made the first
Dean Of Engineering.

The School of Mines was formally founded in 1895.
During the early years the two schools were separated
and each had a different dean. Since 1921, however,
the Schools of Engineering and Mines have operated
as a single school.

The interest in engineering at the University at
the turn of the century can be best exemplified by
the fact that at that time the entire University con-
sisted only of The College, the School of Engineering,
and Allegheny Observatory. At that time there were
fewer than eighty students in the University and the
majority of these were enrolled in engineering under
Professor Carhart. Some of the science and engineer-
ing pioneers in the early days at the University be-
‘came world renowned. Brashear, Langley, and F es-
senden were responsible for the first large reflecting
astronomical telescope, the first or second airplane,
and the first radio broadcast, respectively.

The first building to be constructed on the present
campus, State Hall, was built for the School of Mines
with state funds. In 1909 Thaw Hall was built for
the School of Engineering by subscriptions from the
people of Pittsburgh.

A new engineering building, which will be occu-

ied early in 1955, is currently under construction.
This building, located between Thaw Hall and Old
Mellon Institute, will be seven stories high and nearly
double the available space for the engineering school.

Even though the University of Pittsburgh was a-
mong the first six colleges in the United States to offer
instruction in the engineering sciences and probably
the first college west of the Allegheny Mountains to
foster and develop this profession, it is only in the last
few years that it has actually stood out in this field.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

 

  

There are nineteen divisions of engineering which
are recognized and accredited by the Engineers’
Council for Professional Development, the official
accrediting body. Some of these are well known to
the public but this is not true for at least half of them.

It is a good idea for the high school students to be-
come acquainted with as many of these divisions as
possible before making a selection of his life’s work.

Before deciding on a college it is wise to determine
where the desired course is offered and accredited
because although there are nineteen branches of en-
gineering. most schools only offer four of five branch-
es. Engineering courses are essentially the same
throughout the country because the standards are set
by the official accrediting body.

The accredited fields of engineering, the number of
accredited colleges and the total number of students
enrolled in 1954 are shown in the following list. In
addition, the courses offered at the University of Pitts-
burgh are shown. All are accredited.

Contrary to general belief, there are some highly
successful women engineers. There have been a few
women enrolled at Pitt each semester for years and

‘Me amagéea ecéeece cg CYROGENICS

Scientists marvel at the unsuspected characteristics

of materials at extremely low temperatures.

To someone who likes his beer cold enough to be
refreshing; but liquid enough to drink, research at
extremely l.ow temperatures may seem of little value.
Yet, men investigating this frigid zone are coming up
with more than shivers. They are learning things of
great academic and industrial promise, using ex-
perimental stunts that have the look of black magic.

For example: With a mercury hammer, a rubber
spike is driven through a two inch oak plank. It is
just that when cold enough, these materials get as
hard as steel. These things, you see, have been chilled
beyond their usual lines of behavior.

The medium in which these phenomena are created
is liquid helium, which is, perhaps the most unpre-
dictable element (at subzero temperatures) we know
of. There is a word for this experimenting at low
temperatures, it is called Cyrogenics. While most of
us consider it cold when the car windshield is frosted,
these scientists measure from absolute zero, the point
where theoretically all molecular activity ceases.

Absolute zero, or zero Kelvin, is 459.6 degrees
below zero on the Fahrenheit scale and 273.15 degrees
below zero on the Centigrade scale.

The lowest temperature ever reached, using liquid
helium but without recourse to a complex magnetic
apparatus for lining up nuclei of atoms, was 0.7
Kelvin, first achieved by Kamerlingh Onnes, a Nether-
lander. Contrast this to the lowest temperature on
record: 90 degrees below zero Fahrenheit at Verk-
hoyansk, Siberia, in February, 1892.

Some men are devoting their lives in efforts to at-
tain and measure the lowest possible temperature.
Their most recent attempts have pushed the record to
0.0015 degrees Kelvin. But this is an esoteric target

and most low temperature men concern themselves
with things that could have practical use.

Low-temperature physics began with efforts to
liquify gases, rather than to produce extreme cold.
Scientists gradually worked their way through the
roster of gases, liquifying by compressing, until they
reached some obstinate ones which finally yielded
only when cooled as well as compressed. These liqui-
fied gases are the chilly tools with which industry
builds the household refrigerator and with which
researchers probe well below the antifreeze levels.
The unusual behavior of familiar materials takes
place when thermal chaos subsides. Thermal chaos
is the helter-skelter travel of molecules in all things
of our world. This helter-skelter or state of confusion
is many times termed as the entropy of a system.
When, with heat, the molecular movement steps up,
substances change character, as in molten steel. As
heat is removed, the movement lessens and substances
change to a hard yet malleable state as in steel at
normal temperature, and to a hard brittle state as in
steel at very low temperature.

These changes are remarkable enough in them-
selves, but scientists anticipated them in theories
advanced a century ago. They knew that heat was
motion, and they could predict some of the things
that would happen to substances at various temper-
atures.

At sea level pressure helium becomes liquid at 4.2
degrees K, and bubbles actively like any boiling liquid
under these conditions. As it continues to cool, another
and more subtle change occurs, instead of freezing and
becoming solid it remains a liquid with amazing prop-
erties. This change to what scientists term a “fourth
state of matter” takes place at 2.19 degrees K.

Helium II, as it has been labeled, is colorless and
difficult to photograph but it can be seen as it collects
at the bottom of a container. However, it escapes
through the tiniest openings and must be kept in
Dewars, double walled vacuum insulated flasks.

Helium II shows still more agility when it squirts
out of a slim tube, which is open at each end and
packed with fine emery. The tube is dipped into
Helium II, and a tiny ray of light is directed on the
side of the tube. Almost at once the liquid hurtles
through the emery dust and forms a fountain above
the tube.

Apparently, Helium II feels the heat from the light
beam and rushes quickly up the tube. Once in motion
it streaks on and up, beyond the heated spot and out
of the tube.

Another demonstration begins with two containers

THE AUTHOR’

Frank Buczek is a February 1954 graduate of the
Civil Engineering Department at Pitt. He entered the
University from South High School in 1948 and was
inducted into the army in the fall of 1951. He spent
a year and a half in Georgia working with an anti—air-
craft division before returning to Pitt in the fall of
1953 to complete his course in civil engineering. Frank

Roads, roads, roads. Everyone is crying for roads, turn-
pikes, parkways and super highways that will carry heav-
ier trucks and a greater ﬂow of traffic. Roads that allow
travel from one end of the state to the other in seven or
eight hours. This side of our highway problem gets the
biggest build up. But what of the many thousands of
miles of secondary roads which are unpaved or are in
poor condition due to lack of maintenance, roads which
must be traveled to get to the super highways of our
country? How can small towns provide economical roads
which will serve moderate traffic adequately in all types
of weather? This aspect of the highway problem, while
not played up as much as the problem of our major
roads, is still receiving careful and extensive attention
from our nation’s road builders. A process which may
give them the answer has been developing since the early
1930’s, and is known as soil cement paving. Soil cement is
economical to construct, has low first cost, requires little
maintenance and can satisfactorily handle traﬂic that
does not exceed 100 commercial vehicles per day of the
sizes, weights, and types commonly occurring on second-
ary, or local trafﬁc roads. It may be the life saver of our
small towns.

Soil-cement is a mixture of soil with measured amounts
of Portland cement and water; compacted to high den-
sity. Almost all soils are suitable for soil-cement mixtures
though some may require different construction tech-
niques. The best type of soil is one which is well graded
as to grain sizes and which can be easily pulverized. If a
soil is sandy with very little silt or clay, heavy rubber-
tired equipment will not be able to pull itself through
the mixtures and hence tractors will have to be used to
pull all equipment. If the soil contains high percentages

of clay material, water will have to be added to the dry
soil to facilitate pulverization. The cement used is stan-
dard Portland cement and it acts as a binder which by
chemicalactions with the water, cements the mixture
into a hardened mass. The water must be relatively clean
so that it may adequately serve its two basic purposes,
the ﬁrst of which is to lubricate the soil grains and thus
assists in obtaining maximum compaction of the mix-
ture. The second purpose of the water is to hydrate the
cement so that the mass can be hardened. These three
elements, soil, cement, and water are all that are needed
in the construction of soil cement, but they must be pres-
ent in deﬁnite amounts relative to each other. It is the
job of the engineer to determine what these amounts
will be. Before construction begins he takes specimens of
the soil to the laboratory and determines the most econ-
omical quantity of cement to use by the A.S.T.M. wet-
ting and drying test D559-44, freezing and thawing test
D560-44, or the compaction A.A.S.H.O. tests, T135-45
and T136-45. Once he decides on the amount of cement
to use, which will vary from 7% to 16% by volume, he
then must determine the quantity of water and the de-
sired density of the ﬁnal soil cement mixture.

The water content which is used will be the one which
will allow for the maximum compaction of the soil ce-

ment mixture during construction. The maximum den-
sity of the mixture must also be known in order that the
mix may be compacted enough to give maximum
strength. Approximate values of the minimum moisture
content and the minimum density to which the mixture
must be packed are obtained simultaneously by the stan-
dard A.S.T.M. moisture density test D-558-44. In this
method soil cement is packed in three layers of equal
thickness into a 1/30 cubic foot mold with collar attach-
ment. Each layer is compacted by 25 uniformly spaced
vertical blows of a 5% pound rammer having a 2% inch
diameter striking face. The rammer slides inside a sleeve

,which controls the free fall of the rammer to exactly 12

inches. The thickness of the layers is controlled so that
the third layer extends over the top of the mold into the
collar extension, a distance of about 1/3 inch. After re-
moving the collar the soil cement is trimmed to the exact
size of the mold. The entire assembly is then weighed.
The damp weight of the compacted material at different
moisture contents is determined in this way and after
determining the moisture content of each test, the dry
weights are calculated and then plotted against moisture

. contents to form a moisture-density curve. The optimum

moisture content is that at which the greatest dry density
is obtained in the test. The density is referred to as the
maximum density and is the approximate minimum
density to use in soil-cement construction. From this test
the ‘engineer determines the quantity of water to add
during construction and the density to which the mixture
must be compacted.

Once values for proper cement content, moisture con-
tent, and density have been arrived at, construction of the
soil-cement can begin. This construction will be by either

of three methods: mixed-in-place with heavy duty ﬁeld
cultivators, gang plows, or rotary speed mixers; mixed
with a traveling type mechanical mixer; or mixed by a
stationary plant mixing process using a pug-mill mixer.
Regardless of the type of construction the ﬁnal objectives
are the same. These are the intimate mixing of the soil
with the proper cement content and proper moisture con-
tent and ﬁnally the compaction of this mixture to obtain
maximum density which will assure durability under the
wetting and drying, freezing and thawing conditions en-
countered in the ﬁeld. Since the mixed-in-place method
has been in common use, it will be described step by step.
It should be kept in mind however, that the fundamental

principles of control which are given in this description
will apply to all methods of construction.

Prior to beginning the actual construction of the soil
cement road or runway the crown and grade of the area
to be processed should be checked since the initial grade
will determine to a large extent the ﬁnal grade of the
pavement. After this check has been made, stakes are set
to control the width of pavement, the grades and the be-
ginning and end of the construction section. The ﬁrst
step of actual construction involves scariﬁcation and pul-
verization of the soil. The scarifying equipment rip_s up
the soil to a depth of approximately 5% inches and then
offset disc harrows and rotary speed mixers are used to
break up the lumps. During this operation the 3 or 4-
bottom plow is used to assist in cutting a level subgrade,
for exposing the edge of the treatment by throwing ma-
terial toward the center, and for bringing lumps up from
the bottom. When the soil is thoroughly pulverized, ce-
ment is spread uniformly across the area to be processed.
The number of bags and their placing is calculated by the
engineer in charge of construction. The bags will usually
be placed in some form of a square and when the bags
are opened the cement is spread transverse to the direc-
tion of mixing. A spike harrow or nail drag is used to
uniformly spread the cement and when it ﬁnishes the
area is ready for the “mixing train.”

The mixing train consists of 9 units ‘including heavy
duty gang plows, heavy duty cultivators, a motor grader,
rotary speed mixers, and pressure distributors to add
water. This train makes at least two round trips over the
area to dry mix the soil and cement to a uniform mix-
ture. N ear the end of this dry mix several determinations
are made of the water content. Since the desired moisture
content is known, pressure distributors are added to the
train to add the needed water to the mix. When approxi-
mately three-fourths of the water has been added tests

A CAMPUS-TO-CAREER CASE HISTORY

,/it
“~92”

Fresh out of school, Bob Wilson, ’53, was put to
work on a Transistor project at Bell Laboratories.
He explains why he never had time to be awed.

(Reading time: 39 seconds)

Bob Wilson uses a “breadboard” circuit, studying the electrical properties of a carrier system.

In some ways it was hard to believe.
I had received my B.E.E. at the University of Dela-
ware in June, 1953, and a week later I was working
in the world-famous Bell Laboratories.

“But I didn’t have time to be awed because
they put me right to work. They gave me responsi-
bility fast.

“My group was working on the experimental
application of transistors to carrier systems. My
assignment was the electrical design of a variolosser
for the compressor and for the expandor to be lo-
cated in the terminals.

“The supervision I received and the equipment
I had were tops. I quickly discovered that I had to
rely on my ingenuity as much as on the college
courses I had taken. Perhaps that’s one reason for

 

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER i MAY, 1954

the great new discoveries continually turned out by

the Labs.

“Now I’m in the Communication Development
Training Program, continuing my technical educa-
tion and learning what all the Laboratories sections
do and how their work is integrated.

“In a year I’ll be back working with the group
with which I started.”

Assuming responsibility fast is a common experi-
ence among the engineering, physical science, arts
and social science, and business administration
graduates who join the Bell System. Bob Wilson
went with Bell Laboratories. There also are job
opportunities with the operating telephone com-
panies, Western Electric and Sandia Corporation.

Compatible color television will eventually reach every TV home

The rainbow you can see in black and White!

RCA brings you compatible color TV.
Lets you see color programs in black
and while on the set you now own!

“When a modern and practical color tel-
evision system for the home is here, RCA
will have it . . .”

Echoing down through the years, these
words-—spol<en in 1946 by David Sarnoff,
Chairman of the Board of RCA—haVe a
ring of triumph today.

Behind this great development are
long years of scientiﬁc research, hard
work and ﬁnancial risk. RCA scientists
were engaged in research basically re-
lated to color television as far back as the
1920’s . . . even before black-and—white
television service was introduced.

Since then RCA has spent over
$25,000,000 to add the reality of color to
black-and-white TV, including develop-

ment of the tri—color tube.

The fruit of this great investment is the
RCA all—electronic compatible color tel-
evision system, a system that provides for
the telecasting of high-quality color pic-
tures that can be received in full color on
color receivers; and in black and white
on the set you now own.

RCA and NBC will invest an addi-
tional $15,000,000 during color TV’s
“Introductory Year”— 1954 — to establish
this new service on a solid foundation.

RCA color sets are beginning to come
off the production lines in small quanti-
ties. Although it will probably be another
year before mass production is reached,
the promise of compatible color televi-
sion is being fulﬁlled.

RCA pioneered and developed compatible
color television

ban Redevelopment processes.

Carnegie Museum has been revitalized, the famous
Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary
Painting is part of the program of Carnegie Institute’s
Department of Fine Arts, focussing world attention
on the interest this city has in cultural activities. The
Pittsburgh Playhouse is one of the finest community
theaters in the country, and the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra under William Steinberg has achieved high

rank in musical circles. At Pennsylvania College for _

Women a major building program is underway.

This district’s steel—making capacity has been ex-
panded immensely during the past decade. Through
the Urban Redevelopment Authority, ]. & L. acquired
about 40 acres of slums on the south side and replaced
the blight with a new mill that has added over one
million ingot tons to Pittsburgh’s annual output. U.S.
Steel, Crucible, Pittsburgh Steel and Superior Steel
have all spent millions of dollars in plant expansion
and modernization.

Because of this area’s immense steel production,
our local economy is pretty largely dependent on the
demand for steel. We need more fabricators in the
district—steel consumers like General Motors which
built two assembly plants here in recent years. New
light industries will balance off our economic de-
pendence on coal, steel and heavy manufacturing
and round out our economy. The Allegheny Confer-
ence and the Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce are
keenly aware of this need, and we are considering the
creation of an industrial development corporation

32

to Work in this field. This corporation would have the
responsibility for preparing planned industrial sites
and for promoting industrial growth.

I believe that you will agree that Pittsburgh is vast-
ly improved and that its furure is bright and promis-
ing. That’s because the leaders in this community are
deeply interested in the city. And they live and work
here. There is less absentee ownership and manage--
ment in Pittsburgh than in any other city.

The opportunities this district offers for every type
of engineer are unlimited. I hope that many of you
will decide to stay in Pittsburgh and make this your
home. * * *

How to hold a heavily-loaclecl
latlte spindle
in accurate alignment

This big lathe machines rolls for steel mills. The roll
is rotated by the lathe spindle and it must be machined
to very accurate dimensions. So the lathe manufac-
turer, LeBlond Machine Tool Company, mounts the
spindle on Timken® tapered roller bearings. Despite
the great weight on the spindle, the Timken bearings
hold it precisely in place—because they are made so
accurately and have such high load capacity.

Why T|MKEN® bearings have
ltlglt load capacity

This picture shows why Timken bearings have such high
capacity—the load is carried on a full line contact between the
rollers and races in the bearing. Note also the tapered con-
struction. This permits the bearing to be tightened up (pre-
loaded, we call it) to prevent chatter in rotating parts like the
machine tool spindle above.

bearings or iob opportunities?

Some of the engineering problems you’ll face after
graduation will involve bearing applications. For help

PROGRESSIONS  

GERMANIUM PURIFICATION

Germanium, the metallic sub-
stance from_ which transistors are
made, is purified in this produc-
tion apparatus, patterned after the
original laboratory model, at the
Allentown, Pa. plant of the \-‘Vest-
ern Electric Company. This pro-
cess, known as zone refining, pro-
duces germanium that is 99.99999-
95% pure—the highest degree of
purity ever attained in a manufac-
tured product. In zone refining an
ingot of germanium, which previ-
ously has been reduced from ger-
manium dioxide, is passed through
a heat zone so that a molten sec-
tion traverses the length of the bar,
carrying impurities with it and
leaving a solidified section of high-
er purity. By use of multiple heat-
ing zones in tandem, a number of
molten sections traverse the bar,
and as the germanium passes
through each heat zone its impuri-
ty content is progressively reduced.
In the apparatus shown, six induc-
tion coils are wound on a clear
quartz tube. During zone refining,
germanium is pulled through the
tube in a graphite boat.

AUTOMATIC FACTORY

The automatic factory of the fu-
ture, with batteries of machines
whose intricate operations are con-
trolled by mechanical and electri-
cal intelligence, has come a step
closer to reality.

An electronic control now being
built at Schenectady, N.Y. by the
General Electric Company will op-
erate machines by means of a tape
recorder similar to those used in
the entertainment and broadcast-
ing fields. The main difference is
that the equipment records motion
instead of sound.

When the recording is played
back through the machine on
which the control is installed, it
automatically turns out an exact
duplicate to the piece of work pro-

 

duced while the recording was be-
ing made.

The "record-playback control”
has been in development at C. E.
for five years. The first unit is
scheduled for shipment next year
to the Giddings and Lewis Ma-
chine Tool Company at Fond du
Lac, Wisconsin.

ELETCRONS TOUGHEN PLASTICS

The electron, already one of
man’s most versatile servants, now
can toughen flexible plastic con-
tainers to withstand steam and can
prevent certain plastic dishes from
wilting in the hottest automatic
dishwasher, according to the Gen-
eral Electric Company.

The new method is curing plas-
tics by bombarding them with
powerful electron beams. This cur-
ing process cross-links long, chain-
like molecules called polymers
which make up these plastics.

A few seconds’ bombardment
with electrons from a million-volt
X—ray machine makes polyethylene
bottles stand up under steam-ster-
ilization. This toughening permits
more wide-spread use of these con-
tainers for packaging and storing
pharmaceuticals and biological flu-
ids. The latter include blood plas-
ma, which formerly could be car-
ried only in bulky, easily sterilized
glass. Polyethylene bottles that are
not irradiated collapse when sub-
jected to a high-temperature treat-
ment.

It now appears that polyethy-
lene dishes exposed to electrons
will retain their shape in the hot-
test dishwashers. Exposure to the
powerful electron beam substan-
tially raises the flow temperature
of these plastics. This toughening
process also increases the resist-
ance of plastics to destructive act-
ion of many solvents. Before the
curing process was perfected,
many plastics disintegrated swift-
ly in contact with such solutions.

of Helium II, one of narrower diameter than the
other. The slimmer container is suspended above
the liquid level in the other. An invisible film of
Helium II creeps up the inside of the smaller vessel
and, uncannily, down the outside. It drips tirelessly
from the bottom of the smaller vessel until it reaches
the same level in both containers. When the smal-
ler vessel is lowered, making the liquid level lower
in it than in the surrounding container, Helium II
crawls, again in an invisible film, up the outside of
the smaller vessel, down the inside and finally restores
the level. Briefly this remarkable fluid actually flows
up hill.

A last and most phenomenal demonstration is the
balancing of a lead sphere in a magnetic field induced
by a lead ring surrounding it. To balance the ball,
researchers immerse it and two surrounding, but
unattached, lead rings in a bath of liquid helium.
They then place an electrical potential on the rings,
creating a magnetic field. The ball rests on this mag-
netic field. ~

Lead is an extremely poor conductor of electricity
and the current would not normally flow through
the rings. Even if it did, the ball wouldn’t be bal-
anced by the magnetic field. That’s where liquid
helium takes a hand.

Lead suddenly becomes a superconductor of elec-

tricity when the l'iquid helium gets cold enough.’

Metals such as copper and silver, good conductors
at normal temperatures, also lower their resistance
to current when they are super cooled, but do it
gradually with the fall in temperature until all re-
sistance ends at Absolute zero. For lead this point is
at 446 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. For the rest
of the explanation, lead and these other metals also
become magnetic shields, completely resistant to
fields of force at the same time they become super-
conductors.

So balls and rings, cooled to the magnetic tempera-
ture, work against each other in the balancing act.
When the magnets force upon the ball equals grav-
ity’s pull upon the ball, it floats in space.

Theoretically, if the temperature stayed low enough,
the ball would hang there forever because current
once started in superconducting metal will flow for-

36

ever, unassisted by battery or other power source.
But scientists must admit light to see the ball per-
form. The light warms ball and rings; the sphere falls.

If an inexpensive way could be found to keep a
metal at superconducting cold, researchers would
have something of great practical value. Much of the
cost of electric power lies in the transmitting of it;
a superconducting power line would cut the costs.

Such a use of low temperature remains a bright
hope for the future but there are some uses, partic-
ularly in research, which are possible right now. In
fact, at temperatures some what higher than that of
liquid helium, industry already makes applications
of supercooling. For example: Down at the liquid
helium temperatures electronics workers can take
advantage of the sluggish movement of molecules
to measure tiny impulses of energy, impulses which
would be overwhelmed by the chaotic motion of
surroundings at higher temperatures.

In chemistry, there may be some clues to high-tem-
peratures. Helium cooling, for instance, appears to
increase the lifetime of certain radioactive chemical
elements.

While the effects of all this work may never be
directly felt in the mundane activities of the local
whiffenpoof societies, it is quite obvious from the
relatively small amount of research already done
in the field that many more new and useful results
may be anticipated from Cyrogenics.

“ Y EXPERIENCE with machinery in

M the Navy during the war convinced
me I needed a training course. There was
so much equipment on board that was a
complete mystery to me that I became
very ‘training-course minded’.

“After investigating many training
courses, the one at Allis-Chalmers looked
best to me then-and still does.

“In my opinion, the variety of equip-
ment is what makes Allis-Chalmers such
a good training spot.

“No matter what industry you may be
interested in, Allis-Chalmers makes im-

portant, specialized equipment for that
industry. Electric power, steel, cement,
paper, rock products, and ﬂour milling
industries—to name a few, are big users
of A-C equipment.

“Before starting on the Allis-Chalmers
Graduate Training Course, I thought I
would like selling, preferably technical
selling but, as is often the case, I didn’t
know for sure. This course, together with
some personal guidance, helped me make
up my mind. That, too, is an important
advantage of the GTC program.

Facts You Should Know About the
Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training Course

‘I. It's. well established, having been
started in 1904. A large percentage of
the management group are graduates
of the course.

2. The course offers a maximum of 24
months’ training. Length and type of
training is individually planned.

3. The graduate engineer may choose
the kind of work he wants to do: design,
engineering, research, production, sales,
erection, service, etc.

4. He may choose the kind of power,
processing, specialized equipment or
industrial apparatus with which he will
work, such as: steam or hydraulic,
turbo-generators, circuit breakers, unit
substations, transformers, motors, con-
trol pumps, kilns, coolers, rod and ball

mills, c1"-ushers, vibrating screens, recti-
ﬁers, induction and dielectric heaters,
grain mills, sifters, etc.

5. He will have individual attention
and guidance in working out his train-
ing program.

6. The program has as its objective the
right job for the right man. As he gets
experience in different training loca-
tions he can alter his course of training
to match changing interests.

are made to determine the optimum moisture content.
This is the percentage which will allow for maximum
compaction of the wet mix. While these tests are being
made, water is still applied by the distributors. The engi-
neer depends on his experience to know when the correct
amount has been added should it be reached before the
tests are ﬁnished.

When the water application is completed, the compac-
tion of the mixture is begun. For most soils, sheep’s foot
rollers will be used but for sandy soils which offer little re-
sistance to these rollers, pneumatic-tired equipment must
be used. When the rollers have compacted the mix to
within 2 or 3 inches of the top, the motor grader moves
in and completes preliminary shaping. The sheep’s foot
rollers then pack the mix until there is approximately
one inch of loose mix, called mulch, at the surface. The
rollers are then removed from the section and, if neces-
sary, water may be added to replenish evaporation losses.
After the motor grader gives the section ﬁnal shape, sur-
face compaction planes are removed with a spike tooth
harrow or nail drag followed by a broom drag. When the
compaction planes are removed, pneumatic-tired rollers
are put on the section to give the mulch initial compac-
tion. This rolling is followed by the motor grader which
blades the section to grade. The nail drag then is used
lightly to remove surface compaction planes. The surface
is now ready for the smooth roller which moves onto the
section and starting from one edge moves to the center
and then begins on the opposite edge and again rolls to
the center. After two or more passes over the section with
the smooth roller, a light pneumatic-tired rolling with a
light shot of water is used to give the surface a tight tex-
ture. Field density checks are then made to see if the mix-
ture has been properly compacted. Immediately after the
ﬁnal compaction, or no later than the next morning, a
protective covering must be placed on the section to pre-
vent rapid evaporation of the moisture. If this evapora-
tion were ot occur the cement would not hydrate properly
and the soil cement would not acquire sufficient strength.
The protective covering may be 2 inches of earth or 4
pounds of hay or straw per square yard of pavement,
moistened after placing for a minimum of seven days. In
case of emergency, the road may be opened to traﬂic im-
mediately, though it is recommended that the section be
allowed to cure for at least seven days. In general, a
bituminous wearing surface of less than one inch thick-
ness will be placed over the soil-cement base, although
the road can be used for a considerable period without it.
A common type of wearing surface for roads is a single or
double “bituminous surface treatment,” while airport
runways are commonly surfaced with a 1% inch “plant
mix bituminous surface.”

Experience has shown that the equipment and proce-
dures discussed can average about 1350 linear feet of 20
foot roadway of 6 inch soil-cement per 8 hour day, while
experienced crews and well planned operations can easily
exceed these averages. Soil cement construction is also
used for road shoulders, auto parking areas, residential
streets, alleys and patching of failed areas in old granular
base roads to mention only a few applications. There has
been a great stimulation of thought on the subject of soil-
cement, and techniques are being constantly improved.
Different groups throughout the country are working on
new processes and new uses, both in the ﬁeld and in the
laboratory. Soil cement is the answer for our country’s
crying need for economical, durable, light traffic roads,

streets and airports.

Torrington Needle Bedrings

save weight and space in many designs

Because of its unique construc-
tion—a full complement of small
diameter rollers retained in a
one-piece thin drawn outer shell
—the Torrington Needle Bearing
has a small cross section. This
makes it extremely useful in
bearing applications where space
and Weight are at a premium.
For a given load capacity, the
Needle Bearing is the smallest
and most compact anti—friction
bearing available, giving the
designer many opportunities to
reduce the size and weight of sur-
rounding members without low-

ering performance.

Smaller, lighter
products

In an application like the small
gasoline engine illustrated,
Needle Bearings help keep over-
all size and weight to a minimum.
Housings can be made smaller

and lighter without sacriﬁcing

shaft stiffness and strength.
What’s more, the Needle Bear-
ing’s low coefﬁcient of starting
and running friction plus its
ability to retain lubricants re-

sults in increased power output.

Simpler designs

Since a press fit in a simple

  

straight housing bore is all that
is required to locate a Needle
Bearing, the use of complex re-
taining shoulders or rings is un-
necessary. And, since the Needle
Bearing usually runs directly on
a hardened shaft—Without an in-
ner race — additional savings in

space and Weight are gained.

PHOTOGRAPHY AT WORK——No. 7 in a Kodak Series

 

Photography
reads the meters
2500 an /70z///

Dial a call—an accurate register counts it-—
then each month photography records the total,
precisely right, ready for correct billing.

TWENTY-FOUR hours a day, hundreds of thou-
sands of dial phones Qlick their demands in
many central exchanges of the New York Telephone
Company.

Little meters keep careful tally of the calls. Then
the night before each bill is dated, photography
reads the up-to-the-minute totals in a fraction of
the time it could be done in any other way. Here is
an idea that offers businesses everywhere simpli-
ﬁcation in copying readings on meters, dials or
other recording instrumentation.

Photography ﬁts this task especially well for two
reasons. It is lightning fast. It can’t make a mistake.

This is another example of the ways photography
saves time, outs costs, reduces error, improves out-
put. In large businesses—small businesses——photog-
raphy can do big jobs. In fact, today so many new
applications of photography exist that graduates
in the physical sciences and in engineering ﬁnd
them valuable tools in their new occupations. Other
graduates—together with returning servicemen-
have been led to ﬁnd positions with the Eastman
Kodak Company.

To a young man looking for opportunities,
perhaps the most important fact about a
company is its rate of growth, present and
prospective. In a company which has become
static, advancement is largely dependent on
vacancies occurring through death or retire-
ment. In a growing company, new openings
for able men are being created constantly, and
advancement is restricted only by ability.

Since 1925 the chemical industry has grown
at an average rate of about 10% a year, com-
pared to 3% for all industry. Future growth, at
a more rapid rate than the rest of industry, is
predicted by authoritative studies.

Columbia-Southern is growing not only in
response to increasing demand for its present
products, but also as a result of the steady
development of new products. The company’s
management firmly believes in the importance
of research and development and has given
evidence of that belief by expanding research
facilities and increasing research and develop-
ment budgets.

Columbia—Southern’s growth is an open-end
process; as goals are reached, new goals are
set. Even now new products and processes
are in every stage of evolution, from nebulous

ideas in the minds of research chemists to pilot
plant operations and production plant designs.
That’s why Columbia-Southern needs men
who can grow with it.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Undoubtedly you will recognize
this application of a familiar tech-
nique for studying stresses. In this
case, it was used to develop gears
that are less than 5 inches in
diameter yet easily transmit over

1000 horsepower.

Inherently, the design and de-
velopment of aircraft engines offers
unusual opportunities for applying
basic engineering principles
learned in school. In few other
places can a technical graduate

utilize his education and abilities

Many of our engineers who had
important roles in developing the
most powerful jet engine known to
be in production — rated in the
10,000-pound thrust class — are

still in their twenties.

To those young graduates who
can see the career possibilities in
the rapidly evolving ﬁeld of air-
craft propulsion, we can offer a
real opportunity for growth and

professional development.
