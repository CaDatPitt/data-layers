    On the dark and dreary afternoon of February
23, Dean Hoelscher, at the request of the
Engineering Student Cabinet had a rap session with
the student body in the nearly completed Benedum
Hall Auditorium. Of the student body of 1600, only
27 students showed up. Those who did show up had
many   questions and   gripes to throw  Dean
Hoelscher's way. He was kept busy for two hours
answering them. The following is a rough ap-
proximation of the discussion.


Q. How can a group get the use of Benedum Hall
Auditorium?
A. Make the request through your department or
the Engineering Student Government. The
auditorium is to be used as a meeting place for
groups of engineers. It will not be used as a class
room for ES or any other courses.

Q. Engineering students attending Pitt's Johnstown
extension campus were told that the two year
curriculum at Johnstown would enable them to come
to Pitt as full-fledged Juniors, even in credit with
students who attended Pitt's Oakland Campus for
their Freshman and Sophomore years. When they
got here, they were told they were four credits short
because their core humanities and Social Science
courses were three credit hours rather than
Oakland's four credit hour core courses. We've gone
to everyone we could see and action is still pending
but we don't even know where it is pending.
A. Dean Hoelscher said that he was aware of the
problem. He and Dean Turkes meet every morning
to discuss problems in undergraduate engineering.
Students should realize that the various departments
are relatively autonomous in determining what is
acceptable for a degree; each department will have
to make its own decision. Dean Hoelscher said that it
sounds like the students have a legitimate gripe, that
they're short credits through no fault of their own
and he hopes they get a fair resolution of the
problem. Dean Turkes said that he would help to
expedite the resolution of the problem.

  Q. I took a humanities elective with the OK of
my advisor and now they tell me it isn't applicable
toward my degree. Why can't a list be distributed to
the students of acceptable electives? My advisor
didn't know the course wasn't acceptable.


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_WINTER, 1971



A. Elective acceptability is determined by each
department and the list is given to the advisors. An
advisor has no excuse for not knowing what courses
are acceptable. An advisor is an official represen-
tative of a department and if he signs your schedule,
then the courses on your schedule have been ac-
cepted as creditable toward your degree. If you have
any trouble this way then come see me. I'll see if it is
possible to get a list of acceptable electives
distributed to the students.

  Q. Why aren't there more blacks in the School of
Engineering and are we doing anything to get more
in?
A. Dean Hoelscher said that only 2 per cent of
engineers are black. We are operating on a number
of fronts to correct this situation. We provide ex-
change faculty with a number of primarily black
universities. Many of Pittsburgh city high school
graduates don't have the math background for
engineering. Those black students who do come out
of Pittsburgh   high schools with  good  math
backgrounds are highly sought after by many
Universities. We don't get many. We started a
program about four years ago which would give
twenty-two black high school graduates who didn't
have sufficient math background remedial courses
and let them start their Freshman year later. Half
way through the first semester, they and their in-
structors, came to me wanting to be entered into the


regular Freshman program. I agreed but only about 4
managed to graduate. We are starting a new program
with a three term freshman year and this time I will
not agree to let them switch programs. I hope we get
better results in this way.


Q. Our Nation      is reevaluating  its priorities,
Education, in general, is doing the same. What is the
Engineering School doing to reevaluate its priorities
and to help improve our society?
A. "A couple of hours wouldn't be enough to
completely cover that subject," stated the Dean.
"Engineers are trained to solve problems in the real
world and our real world is changing rapidly. The
most rapidly changing part of the real world is
priorities. The curriculum must change with these
priorities. Pitt's School of Engineering is a leader in
this curriculum change. Recently we. have started
three specialties: Environmental Engineering, Bio-
Engineering and an Energy resources development
and management department."

Q. Are we training engineers exclusively to in-
dustry's requirements?
A. We try to give the student the best education to
teach him to solve problems in the real world. If that
happens to prepare him for industry, then that's OK
too.

Q. You said nothing in your definition of an
Engineering education about providing the student
with an intellectual experience which will carry on
into and enrich the rest of his life.
A. Well, that should have been presupposed in
what I said.


Q. If Pitt's School of Engineering can't accept
many of the Pittsburgh high school black graduates
because their schools give them  poor math
background, why doesn't the school lessen the rigor
of its curriculum so it can accept more Pittsburgh
graduates and better serve the city it receives free
services from? Could not Pitt institute a less rigorous
engineering technology course?
A. No. If we turn out a Civil Engineer, he has to be
able to build a safe bridge or building. The same is
true with the other departments. A certain com-
petence must be maintained. We are starting a less
theoretical and mathematical curriculum on the
Johnstown campus. It has more emphasis on english
comprehension, communication and applied
engineering. It is a course equal in quality but dif-
ferent in kind with the programs on the Oakland
campus.


Q. Many people in industry and in the academic
community say that engineers are weak in writing
skills. Don't you think more English and Humanities
should be included in the engineering curriculum?
A. History majors can't write. Soc. majors can't
write. Chemistry majors can't write. I don't think
most college graduates can put together a syn-
tactically correct sentence. Don't just hang the label
on engineers. A major problem in education is how
to put together an effective and interesting course
with 300 students at a time. The idyllic situation
would be to have a one to one corespondence, one
Professor to  one student, but that is not
economically feasible. Engineering education has
the particular problem of what can be left out. There
is so much that should go into a four year course that
it's hard to decide what is necessary and what will
have to be left out. We had a five year engineering
course but five year grads did not receive em-
ployment advantage over four year graduates so the
program was dropped.

Q. Are the four credit
science courses going to

humanities and social
remain a part of the


A. Dean Hoelscher said that he hadn't seen any
proposals on changing the curriculum but that he
only has one vote as a member of the faculty in
matters of curriculum. As Dean his main concern is
how much curriculum changes will cost. Four years
ago, engineering  students had  a  choice  of
Humanities and Social Science electives in the
Freshman and Sophomore years. Also, Engineers
were fed up with the low quality of these electives
and wanted their own courses set up. Now they want
to change back to electives and they'll probably want
to change again in another four years.

Q. How is the Skyscraper funded?
A. Dick Beswick, Editor of Skyscraper Engineer,
stated that Skyscraper receives an allocation from
advertisers and forty cents per magazine from the
purchasers. The  Engineering  Student Cabinet
subscribes for 1600 issues.

Q. Why hasn't the Skyscraper Engineer responded
to the wishes of the majority of the engineering
student by including the Techni-Cutie?
A. A majority of engineering students didn't vote
to place the Techni-Cutie feature in the Skyscraper.
570 names were on the petitions and that isn't a
majority of undergraduate engineers. The feature
didn't agree with our policy of depicting all minority
and socially sensitive groups as whole individuals
rather than archaic stereotypes. As with the Pitt
News and other University student publications,
Editorial policy is determined by the student editor.
It is not controlled by the University Administration,
the University Faculty or directly by the student
body.


Q. Has the word spread that Pitt Engineering
School is improving?
A. One of the most lasting and hardest things to
change is the reputation of a school. I know of one
Chemical Engineering department at a school I
won't mention which was tops when I was in school
but today I wouldn't recommend it for a graduate
school for one of our graduates. It, however, still has
a widely held reputation of being one of the best.
Pitt Engineering School is respected coast to coast
and we are always trying to spread the word of our
improvements. We've come a long way in a short
time.

    The questions and answers came fast at the rap
session between Dean Hoelscher and the students.
The conversation was taken down by an inefficient
scribe. None of this text should be considered direct
quotes from  anyone but only a general ap-
proximation of what transpired. Apologies and /or
corrections will be gladly entered in the next issue of
Skyscraper. The conversation was rich in content
and much was lost because of slowness of pen. Good
questions were asked and clear and meaningful
answers were given. Those who missed the meeting
missed an opportunity to gain an insight into the
future, structure and purpose of the School of
Engineering.


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-WINTER, 1971


Q. When the money is divided between schools,
how does the Engineering School rate in order of
priorities?
A. Priorities run in cycles at Pitt. A long time ago
the University of Pittsburgh decided it wanted a top
medical school so it put a lot of money into it and
they have a top medical school. Later, Pitt wanted a
top Philosophy department. The money flowed and
the Philosophy School is now rated fourth in the
nation. In 1965, when I was made Dean of the School
of Engineering, I was charged with the task of
making Pitt's Engineering School one of the best in
the nation. Since then we've acquired Benedum Hall,
a fifteen million dollar building and five million
dollars of new equipment to go into it. In the five
years since I took over, out budget has tripled but
the student body has not increased significantly. The
emphasis has been on quality.

Surfing has come at last to the Arizona
desert.
The ersatz ocean is called Big Surf*. At
4 million gallons, it's believed to be the
biggest "pool" ever built: 400 feet long by
300 feet wide, and nine feet at its deepest
point.
And it makes its own waves.


Every 60 seconds, the crashing surf pro-
pels an army of Arizona's finest toward a
sandy 41/2 acre beach.
Now about the waves. They're made by
pumping water into a 160 foot by 41 foot
tank-like "reservoir." Up to 100,000 gal-
lons are released through 15 gates at the
reservoir base. The water passes over a
custom concrete "reef," and is formed into
a wave up to five feet high.
The restless sea is kept restless by three
250 hp Peerless mixed flow pumps from
FMC Corporation. They are the same
pumps that irrigate deserts in the Middle
East, provide flood control in Louisiana,
and fill city reservoirs in New York.
And FMC is the same company that makes
fibers, food machinery, railroad cars, in-
dustrial chemicals, and a whole lot of other
things you never hear about because we
work behind the scenes.
If you'd like to do something about making
waves in the desert, or fighting famine in
India, or anything else that a diversified
company does to improve life, pick up a

     Education   is a  very  exciting  endeavor.
 Classroom teaching and out of class interaction with
 students does provide me with some of my most
 satisfying university experiences. To watch an in-
 dividual student grow in knowledge and skills as he
 or she progresses through the university can be very
 rewarding.
     Education is not always a dynamic, exciting,
 intellectually satisfying experience for all students,
 however. Somehow educators have succeeded in
 quieting the ever inquisitive mind of the young child.
 We have removed the spark from many learning
 experiences. Students often approach their studies
 with something less than enthusiasm. Although
 financial rewards are present for those who complete
 college and university study, I feel that the student is
 not sufficiently encouraged to find self satisfaction in
 the use of his or her mind. The solution of a difficult
 engineering problem should afford the student a
 degree of intellectual accomplishment. I make no
 claim that this good feeling will necessarily generate
 as much excitement as a date, or success in an
 athletic endeavor, but I do feel that some degree of
 self satisfaction must be present. If it is not, the
 student should seek a career in some field other than
 engineering. As an educator, I have sought ways that
 can help the individual student develop enthusiasm
 for his chosen profession and the courses of study
 that comprise his formal education.
    In developing my courses I have tried to in-
corporate the following observations into their
structure:

a. The contemporary student has literally been
   bombarded by various means of visual com-
   munication. In particular, the impact of movies
   and television on the student's learning habits
   cannot be overlooked.
b. Conventional lecture methods are inherently
  inefficient in their use of available time.
c. By and large students are rather poor note takers.
  While serving in this secretarial role their primary
  intellectual effort is directed to reproducing the
  material that the professor writes on the black-
  board. Classes can no longer serve as the vehicle
  to transfer material from the notes of the professor
  to the notes of the student without going through
  the mind of either one.

     These considerations led me to conclude that
new approaches were needed in classroom teaching
efforts. In preparing for the core thermodynamics
course, ES-8, I tried to develop an educational at-
mosphere that would utilize rather than be frustrated
by the three observations cited above. Conventional
lecture methods do have some definite drawbacks
not the least of which is the limitation that they
impose in the amount of information that can be
transferred in a given period of time. I prepared
slides containing the basic definitions, concepts and


equations of the subject matter. These slides serve as
the skeleton of the course.
     Several requirements for the slides were ob-
 vious. The slides had to be concise, readable and
 furthermore be interesting enough in their own right
 so the viewer would not quickly become bored with
 them. The "text" material on a given slide is
 superimposed on a colorful background and a
 colored slide is prepared from them. At the very
 least these slides do make the act of staying alert and
 attentive in lecture easier.
     Just as "Man doth not live by bread alone",
 engineering students have not really mastered a
 given subject matter until they can demonstrate
 problem solving skills in the subject matter. The use
 of the slides does free some of the lecture time to
 pursue this activity. At the present time we rely more
 on the individual attention given to the student in the
 recitation portions of the course to achieve these
 skills. Recitations, like little girls, come in all
 wrappings, however. Some are very very good and
 some are horrid! Recently I have attempted to
 correct this problem by making a series of SELF
 STUDY EXAMPLES available to all students in the
 course. These SELF STUDY EXAMPLES contain a
 problem statement followed by a listing of the
 educational objectives that are appropriate for that
 problem, finally followed by a very detailed solution
 to the problem. My work in developing the SELF
 STUDY EXAMPLES is unfinished at the present
 time. I ultimately will include a series of SELF
 STUDY    EXAMPLES    that will require  some
 calculations on the student's part. Furthermore, I
 plan to prepare a series of cassette tapes that not
 only elaborate on some of the steps of the various
 problems but also ask questions that will enable the
 student to evaluate whether he or she has grasped
the appropriate concepts. Finally a series of tests will

9I0-                                                4000


be included within the SELF STUDY EXAMPLES. I
have been very encouraged with the students' initial
use of the SELF STUDY EXAMPLES. Over 50 per
cent of a class of 35 students made A grades on the
first examination this term and that is truly ex-
ceptional experience in my classes. When the
materials are all developed, I visualize their use in
the following manner. The student goes to a facility
similar to the present language lab and works with
the tapes and SELF STUDY EXAMPLES ap-
propriate for that period of study. A competent
graduate assistant and /or professor will be available
to provide additional guidance and direction. I see
no reason why a very bright or conscientious student
could not complete all SELF STUDY EXAMPLES
and internal tests before the normal end of the term.
Under these circumstances he or she could ask to
take a final exam and could complete the course by
passing that exam.
     As I review my educational procedures I am
constantly striving for means to economize on the
transfer of information. Audio-visual materials have
shown promise and I'll no doubt continue to explore
their use.
     It is important that I do not develop an
educational approach that totally divorces the
student from the professor, for that would be a grave
error. We are all members of a society whose
common good can only be improved through mutual
trust and understanding. In a sense developing this
understanding is really the number one educational
objective of any of my courses.
    Yes, we must help the student to realize that the
society he or she is about to enter is a highly complex
one and that an ability to solve academic problems in
engineering courses is only one of a number of skills
that will be vital to them. I feel that if we fail to help


the student develop an increased awareness of
himself, his fellow man and the role they will play in
guiding our planet in the immediate future that we
have educated only part of the man or woman.
    I cannot too strongly encourage any student to
avail themselves of the unique opportunities present
at this university. Perhaps at no other time of their
lives will students be able to select from such a
cosmopolitan   menu  of lectures, recitals, art
exhibitions, and the like. Equally important are the
opportunities to discover other individuals who
having come from a spectrum of ethnic backgrounds
can provide great stimulus. Question your ideals and
those of the society in which you live. Become active
in political groups and the groups such as GASP. If
you do involve yourself not only will your time spent
at the university be more satisfying to you but you
will also be laying a solid foundation for satisfaction
in your post baccalaureate careers.
     In summary, your education must be the
simultaneous development of your technical skills
and understanding of yourself and your fellow man.
In our contemporary world this last point cannot be
too strongly emphasized. These feelings were ex-
pressed by one of the true geniuses of all time, Albert
Einstein. Paul Ehrenfest, a contemporary of Ein-
stein, had written to him in one of Ehrenfest's
distressed moments complaining that he could not
do the most original physics. Einstein's answer was
the following:
"You are complaining about yourself again,
and are dissatisfied with yourself. Just think
how little difference it will make in twenty
years how one has loitered about on this earth,
just so long as one has done nothing base.

If you are a senior...


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_WINTER, 1971
















Scould be the most


important year


of your life.


            As you contemplate one of the most important decisions of your life, you will want to remember this:
            it is not just "a job" you are seeking-it should be the beginning of a career. And if it is to be
            successful, both you and your employer must need and want each other.
            To help you with your decision, we invite you to consider the opportunities at Pratt & Whitney
            Aircraft. Currently, our engineers and scientists are exploring the ever-broadening avenues of
            energy conversion for every environment... all opening up new avenues of exploration in every
            field of aerospace, marine and industrial power application. The technical staff working on these
            programs, backed by Management's determination to provide the best and most advanced facilities
            and scientific apparatus, has already given the Company a firm foothold in the current land, sea,
            air and space programs so vital to our country's future.
            We select our engineers and scientists carefully. Motivate them well. Give them the equipment
            and facilities only a leader can provide. Offer them company-paid, graduate-education
            opportunities. Encourage them to push into fields that have not been explored before. Keep them
            reaching for a little bit more responsibility than they can manage. Reward them well when they
            do manage it.
            Your degree can be a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL ENGINEERING * AERONAUTICAL
            ENGINEERING * ENGINEERING SCIENCE * ENGINEERING MECHANICS.
            If your degree is in another field, consult your college placement officer-or write Mr. Len Black,

THOSE INFAMOUS THREES...


                                          English 3, History 3, Philosophy 3, Sociology. How do the
                                          students feel about them? The sophomores are now in a
                                          l)osition to comment on all four of these courses, and
                                          recently the Skyscraper Staff visited a sociology lecture to
                                          obtain the following remarks.




                          Joseph Thoma
                               The English 3 course was good. In general, some
                          of the Humanities and Social Science courses were
                          good and some were bad but many of the Profs and
                          instructors seem to have some sort of mental block
                          against engineering students. The classes shouldn't
                          be made up of all engineers. How are you going to
                          get engineers to relate to the rest of society if we're
                          always grouped together like a herd of cattle?






          /






                                          PETE CAVALIER
                The courses require too much work for four
            credit hours. The courses are of pretty good quality.
            One bad thing is that the teaching assistants are
            usually of a different department than the course
            that's being taught.








                                        Frank Avbel
                                            The courses aren't giving us a quality humanities
                                       education. Some of the Profs have open hostility
                           i  'towards engineers, but some of them taught great
                                       courses. History 3 with Professor Hall was good.
                                       Engineers should be allowed to take courses with the
                                       rest of the University. Courses in humanities and the
                                       Social Sciences shouldn't be set up for engineers
                                       only.


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEERWINTER, 1971










                                    Mark Pavlick
    Courses are thrown together with the idea that
"Well, OK, you have to have some humanities so
let's throw something together." The courses in
general are not very good quality and some of the
Profs express hate for engineers.


I.~


Ed Klein
    To put it succinctly, the courses STINK!
Engineers competing against engineers lowers the
quality of the courses. Engineers should have a
required English composition course but then be
allowed to take electives.


                                 AHSEN YELKIN
    The core humanities and Soc. courses are
taught by very young instructors. They cannot hold
the attention of the students. It's half way through
this course and many students still don't know where
their recitation is being held. There should be
written papers required in a four credit hour course.
There is none required in this course. Many Profs
and instructors make known their dislike for
engineers. This builds tension and disrespect bet-
ween students and instructors. Petty professional
jealousy should be aired between equals. Professors
should not morally castigate the fledgeling students.

More people are deriving more benefits from our
water resources than ever before in history. But to-
day we are facing a new challenge: enhancing the
quality of life by balancing the development of our
water resources with the preservation of our natural
environment. It is a big order, and it has to be filled.
That's where you come in. The Corps of Engineers
needs engineers who are interested in the broad pic-
ture, who have a creative approach to today's prob-
lems, and who want to work with economists,
planners, landscape-architects, biologists, and others
to build a better quality of life. This is a chance for
real involvement and achievement with an agency
committed to meeting changing public needs--a
chance to make it count.
Our challenges are not concerned solely with water


resources. We are also applying all the techniques
of modern technology to the improvement of our
construction capability - systems analysis, com-
puter technology, advanced materials research, and
many more. As a Corps professional, you will face
these challenges as a member of the largest en-

       He's learning that there's more to atomic
energy than atomic bombs,


For many people, the atomic age began at
Hiroshima.
   But for thousands of kids, a new kind of
atomic age is beginning.
  Because of a Union Carbide discovery
called the Minigenerator.
   It produces atomic energy in the form of
radioisotopes.
  Recently, as part of a long research pro-
gram into the uses of atomic energy, we dis-
covered that we could make radioisotope
generators almost as small as we wanted.
  Which gave us an idea. Make. one small
enough and safe enough to be used in
schools.
   So that kids could learn for themselves
how radioisotopes are used in industry,
agriculture and medicine.
  How they can be used to detect cancer,


and how they can be used to measure the
thickness of the wall of a space capsule.
  We didn't do it for completely unselfish
reasons, though.
  We're a corporation. The Minigenerator
is only a by-product of our nuclear research
effort. And we make a small profit on it, as
we do on our other educational aids.
  But we also hope the human race will
profit, too.
  By showing some kids a power once used
to bring death.
  And teaching them how it can bring a
better life.

    "There's a little more
freedom here to direct my
own research than at
most company labs'
                         Bob Pfahl, Western Electric


    Thermal energy is his field. And since 1968,
Bob Pfahl has been doing research and develop-
ment in radiant heat transfer on the staff of Western
Electric's Engineering Research Center.
    Well-backgrounded, Bob holds three degrees
from Cornell University-a bachelor's in mechani-
cal engineering, and a
master's and doctorate
(received in 1965) in heat
transfer.
     "My job is self-moti-
vating,"said Bob."l haveto
look ahead to see where
I think research should be
done."
    And one such area
was the design of heating
equipment. Western Elec-
tric uses radiant heating in
a variety of manufacturing
processes because it's
quick and inexpensive,
and because it can be ap-
plied at a distance.
     However, because of the limitations of existing
reflectors, radiant heating has been limited to small
areas. Bob has developed a reflector shape which
uniformly distributes energy from a compact mer-
cury arc lamp over larger circular areas.


     "Many projects grow out of previous or exist-
ing work," Bob said. He explained that in order to
calculate the reflector shape, he had to first design
an instrument to measure reflectance of the reflec-
tor material.
     "But we're well supported here at Western
                       Electric," said Bob. "We
                       have very fine lab equip-
                       ment-and can obtain the
                       equipment we need."
                           So Bob designed and
                      built his "spectral bi-direc-
                      tional reflectometer." It
                      provides data for a com-
                      puter program he created
                      that calculates reflector
                      shape by numerically inte-
                      grating a set of differential
                      equations.
                           Bob is currently work-
                       ing on the development of
                       an even newer type reflec-
                       tor which will distribute
                       energy from line type fila-
ment lamps over a large rectangular area. An array
of these reflectors will allow the uniform heating of
almost any size workpiece.
     "We're free to look around for our own proj-
ects," said Bob. "I like that-that's why I'm here."

THE CONSCIENCE

     In today's technological society, the engineer is
a very important man. Our whole life style has been
formed by the inventions of the engineer. The
engineer made possible the industrial growth of the
last century, creating the economy which our society
has grown accustomed to.
    Engineers could turn this nation into a "Garden
of Eden." We could reverse and prevent further
pollution  of the   environment. By  increasing
technological application, we could reduce the
working hours of the entire labor force. We could
design adequate housing and efficient transportation
for the cities. There are an infinite number of
problems which engineers could solve to raise the
quality of life in America.
    Engineers still have a choice in these matters.
We can refuse to work on any project that we do not
approve of. One engineer who refuses to work on a


new bomb has done more to end the war than a host
of protesters.
     A precedent was established at the Nuremberg
War Crimes Trial: "Obedience to government is no
excuse for committing crimes against humanity." In
other words, the chemical engineer who creates na-
palm in Dow's factories is as guilty as the Army
general who orders a village burned.
    The conscience of the engineer who works on a
defense project which he feels is wrong, should
prevent him from working on that project. By
refusing to work on national projects which he feels
are irrelevant or detrimental to humanity, the
engineer can do his part to change the way things
are.
    Guns and bullets are designed by engineers. If
engineers would refuse to fabricate weapons, the
foot soldier could not fire them. As human beings,
our consciences should stop us from using our skills
to destroy life when we could be saving it.

KIDNEY


       By: THOMAS E. GESTRICH
                        and
               GARY D. BROWN


 INTRODUCTION
     Today, in the United States, an estimated 55,000 individuals die
 each year of kidney failure. Of these, approximately 20 per cent could
 have an extended lifetime of seven years using present dialysis
 technology at an annual cost of $12,000 /person.1 Due to this high cost,
 kidney dialysis is inaccessible to the public. The number of deaths could
 be sharply reduced by increasing the availability of dialysis equipment
 with particular emphasis on reduced cost. Also, due to the side effects of
 uremic poisoning from transient dialysis, a portable lifetime dialysis unit
 operating continuously would extend the average lifetime as well as
 being psychologically less straining on the patient.

 ABSTRACT
     The design of an ultrafiltration system to process 500 cc/min of
 plasma producing 150 cc/min of plasma water is described. The system
 is based on the Amicon Corporation UM-1 membrane which is synthetic
 and non-cellulosic. The membrane is supported on a tough polyolifin
 frame which is non-toxic to proteins and inert to blood. Five square feet
 of membrane is contained in a stack of five one foot square membranes
 contained in a 9 x 9 x 4 inch package. Provisions are made for conducting
 plasma between the membrane and collecting the filtrate. An additional
 0.4 atmosphere pressure drop across the membrane surface is made
 available by suction obtained from a specially designed filtrate pump.
 Power requirement of the system is estimated to be approximately 3
 watts. The system is overdesigned by 30 cc/ min of filtrate over the
 normal flowrate of a healthy glomerular system. The membrane
 specificity is almost identical to that of a healthy glomerulus. The flow
 rates are manually controlled.

 KIDNEY FUNCTION
    The functions the natural kidney performs and how these functions
are related to the physiology of other organs systems is important in
understanding the requirements which an artificial kidney must meet.
    In maintaining constancy of the internal environment, the kidney
performs several functions:9

             MACHINE




     1. Water balance - if an excess of water is ingested the kidney
     compensates by producing large quantities of dilute urine. If
     water intake is deficient, the kidney will attempt to compensate
     by a decrease in urine volume and an increase in urine con-
     centration. However, a minimum quantity of urine (3000400 ml
     day) must be excreted to rid the body of nitrogenous wastes.
     Thus, renal capacity for water balance must be made up by the
     mechanisms of thirst and increased intake.
     2. Electrolyte balance - the kidney regulates the con-
     centration of ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium,
     phosphate, bicarbonate and sulfate within narrow limits despite
     large variations in food intake and metabolic activity.
     3. Acid-base balance -    most of the end products of
     metabolism are acidic in nature. The kidney handles this acid
     load by the excretion of acid radicals. In addition, ammonia is
     secreted into the tubular urine, where it forms ammonium ion
     and thus removes hydrogen ions.
     4. Waste excretion -    the nitrogenous end products of
     protein metabolism, such as urea and creatinine, are excreted
     by the kidneys. In the processing of those waste products, other
     substances such as glucose and amino acids must be selectively
     reabsorbed so that they will be conserved by the body.
     5. Hormone and enzyme synthesis - the kidney appears to be
     a source for at least two hormones. Renin is an enzyme
     produced in the renal cortical juxtaglomerular cells; it exerts
     effects upon extracellular volume and  blood  pressure.
     Erythropietin is the hormone that regulates rate of red blood
     cell production by the bone marrow.

HYPERFILTRATION
    The first step in urine formation is production of an ultrafiltrate of
plasma by glomerular filtration. In ultrafiltration large molecules such as
plasma proteins and lipids are sieved out but small molecular weights are
passed. Thus, tubular urine is protein free and contains all of the


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_WINTER, 1971




crystalloids present in plasma in the same concentrations as the plasma
except for small differences due to the Donnan equilibrium.4
     The filtration process requires expenditure of energy to overcome
 the frictional resistance of the membrane and to perform the osmotic
 work of separating protein from the plasma. The relationship among the
 various pressures is shown in the following equation with approximate
 values of pressures available in man shown below.

                             Pf = Pg - (Pos + Pc)

           Pf = filtration pressure = 25 mm Hg
           Pg = glomerular pressure = 70 mm Hg
           Pos = osmotic pressure = 30 mm Hg
           Pc = Intracapsular Hydrostatic Pressure = 15 mm Hg


TUBULAR REABSORPTION
    Plasma constituents, such as glucose are known to be filterable at
the glomerulus but do not appear to any extent in excreted urine.
Therefore, reabsorption of the substances from the tubular urine must
occur.9
                          Proximal Tubule
    Reabsorption of salt and water is isomotic and occurs by the
following process:8
     1. sodium is active reabsorbed.
     2. water is passively reabsorbed by the osmotic force created by
active reabsorption of sodium ions and the passive diffusion of chloride
ions.
    3. chloride is passively reabsorbed down the electrochemical
gradient created by sodium reabsorption.
    4. four-fifth to seven-eights of the glomerular filtrate is normally
reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.
     5. essentially all glucose reabsorption and secretion occurs in the
proximal tubule.
                            Distal Tubule
     One-fifth to one-eight of the water in the glomerular filtrate is
reabsorbed here. Water permeability of the tubular epithelium is a
function of the presence of antidiuretic hormone. Variable amounts of
sodium are reabsorbed. The reabsorbed sodium is exchanged with H+
and K+ which are secreted in this zone.
                Renal Regulation of Acid-Base Balance
     Metabolism produces an excess of acid substances. The chief acid
product' is CO2 which is volatile and expelled to the lungs. Oxidation of
proteins producs large quantities of non-volatile acids such as sulfuric
and phosphoric. To maintain neutrality of the body fluids, the excess
acid is excreted in the urine.
     When excreted the acid anions must carry with them      a
stoichiometric amount of salts (Na+, K+, Ca++). The amount of base
which a milliequivalent of acid will carry with it in the urine depends
upon urine PH and the PK of the acid:


                 PH PK log (A-)
                             (HA-)

 PARAMETERS OF ULTRAFILTRATE DESIGN (12)
     I. Estimation of Pore Size of Glomerular Capillaries
     The filtration characteristics of glomerular capillary membranes are
 similar to those of porous membranes. Filtration occurs through pores in
 the capillary membrane. Most microscopic studies have not succeeded
 in defining a basis for these porelike properties or in providing any actual
 values of pore diameter.
     One approach has been to estimate an effective pore size from
 experimentally determined filtration characteristics. For laminar flow
 through N pores in parallel, Poiseville's equation states:

               G=Nir4P
                  8n x

               G = Glomerular Filtration rate, ml/min
               r = Pore Radius
               n = Viscosity of Filtrate
               AP = Pressure Drop Across Capillary Membrane
               x = Membrane Thickness


    The total cross-sectional area of the pores, Ap, is equal to Ndr2
Substituting in equation 1.


                       G= Apf24AP
                           8n    x

The permeability of the membrane may be
filtration coefficient k :


                        k= G/AP


Substituting k in the above equation:

                          Apx                (4)

Equation 4 is used to calculate the pore radius of artificial membrances.
The quantities that must be determined experimentally are k and Ap/x .
k is readily determined by dividing filtration rate by pressure drop. Ap/x
is estimated as follows:
     If the diameter of the pores is large enough in comparison to the
diameter of the titrated water molecule (H), the rate of diffusion of H
through the artificial membrane is given by Picke's law:

                    d (nH) = DhApAC           (5)
                    dt              X
               or
                    Ap = d(nh) 1              (6)
                    x    dt    Dh&C

        n = number of molecules
      AC = difference in concentration of H on sides of the membrane
      Dh = coefficient of free diffusion in water.

 Substitution of equation 6 into equation 4 permits solution for r.
     This simple method cannot be applied to the measurement of pore
 size of the glomerular capillary membrane, but a modification can be
 used. It depends on the fact that certain proteins such as myoglobin and
 egg albumin are partially filtered by the glomerulus. The low molecular
 weight protein can be introduced intravenously and the concentration of
 the protein in the plasma C, and its concentration in the glomerular
 filtrate C2 can be determined.

    The pore radius can then be calculated from the molecular sieving
equation:


C2 _ 1+D/G (8nk/r2)
CI   1+2.4a/r

     2(1-a/r)2-(1-a/r)4


+ D 8nk
  G     r2


       a = Einstein Stokes radius (radius of a similar diffusion sphere)
       D= Coefficient of free diffusion for the protein

All of the quantities in equation 7 above are either known or can be
readily measured except for k and r . If the ratio of C 2/C1 is ex-
perimentally determined for two different proteins, k and r can be
determined by simultaneous solution of the molecular sieving equation.
Typical values forC2/C1 are .75 for myoglobin and .22 for egg albumin.
    Equation 7 takes into account viscous drag in protein filtration.
    Calculations of glomerular capillary pore diameter give values of
about 70 to 100 anstroms.

II. MATERIAL OF CONSTRUCTION (3)
     The relation between composition of artificial surfaces and their
ability to initiate hemostatic processes has been under much speculation.
One fact is established, glass, the universal containing material for
mematological studies is among the more active surfaces. This activity
can be reduced by coating it with various hydropholic materials such as
thin films of silicones. A crucial factor in any attempt to access surfaces
is knowing what blood actually confronts; in all cases proteins are
quickly absorbed on artificial surfaces and the initial reactions are
complex.
     The greatest advance is the development of nonthrombogenic
surfaces in heparin, which when previously attached to surfaces in
contact with blood prevented clotting. In spite of the fact that herarin is
widely recognized as an effective anticoagulant in solution, its mode of
action in the absorbed state remains puzzling.




34


      The factors causing adhesion of platelets (clotting) are poorly
  understood. Platelet physiology is complex and difficult to study in part
  because platelets are very small cells with high environmental sensitivity.
  An ideally nonthrombogenic surface will not accumulate cells or
  coagulated proteins, shorten cell lifetimes, accelerate the turnover of
  clotting proteins or accelerate or retard normal hemostasis.
      Present artificial organs are prevented from inducing coagulation
  reactions by injecting large doses of heparin into the blood which
  prevents completion of the clotting reaction.13
      In the absence of a clear criterion for selecting materials on the
  basis of their nonthrombogenicity, the design guidelines which can be
  offered to minimize coagulation reactions in artificial kidneys pertain to
  flow conditions. Stagnation appears undesirable; blood left in contact
  with artificial surfaces for long periods even when heparinized may tend
  to clot, turbulence with substantial recirculation of the same blood,
  appears to result in the deposition of tendrils. Since emboli are serious
  threats to the patient, returning blood is passed through a filter.6
      Design practice dictates the avoidance of stagnation and the use of
 smooth non-porous materials in the construction of artificial organs.
 Surface areas exposed to blood should be no greater than required.
      Materials in contact with the blood should not leak or corrode so as
 to release foreign or toxic materials into the blood. Trace quantities of
 metal may be toxic; many plastics contain additives which can be
 released upon extended soaking in warm ionic solutions. Blood and ionic
 solutions are highly corrosive to most metals and may promote stress
 cracking of many plastics.
     In general, there is less clotting activity on the high pressure side of
 the heart. Therefore the design should include coupling to this side.

 III. CONCENTRATION POLARIZATION (11)
     When a fluid moves directly through any filter that retains dissolved
 and suspended substances an enriched layer or film accumulates on the
 surface of the filter, interferring with access bulk of the fluid to the
 actual filter surface. If this is allowed to consolidate, a secondary
 membrane is formed. This tendency to accumulate retained species at
 the membrane's surface is a phenomenon called concentration
 polarization. It will, if not counteracted, ultimately lead to formation of a
 gel layer that resist passage of the solvent and species to which the
 membrane is permeable. During fractionation of mixes macromolecules
 by membranes it is found that accumulation of the larger species on the
 membrane surface interferes with access of the smaller species, creating
 the appearance that the membrane is not permeable to the smaller
 species. This can, however, be effectively minimized by appropriate
 equipment design. The task of the designer is to maximize return of the
 concentrated macrosolute from the membrane surface to the bulk of the
 liquid. The challenge is to take fullest advantage of the extraordinary
 transport capabilities of the anisotropic membrane by keeping its surface
 as free of accumulations as possible. The simplest means of reducing the
 boundary layer is turbulent mixing by mechanical agitation of the fluid
 close to the membrane suface.11 Another effective means of managing
 the concentration polarization problem is to propel the fluid over the
 surface of the membrane in very shallow channels (o.010-0.030 inch)
 producing smooth laminar flow at relatively high velocity.

 PROPOSED ULTRAFILTRATE SYSTEM DESIGN
     The permeability and retention characteristics of the Amicon's Di
aflo UM-1 are presented in Table III. For comparison, some transport
properties of the glomerular membrane and cellophane are also in-
cluded. The UM-1 membrane is more retentive and less water permeable
than the glomerular membrane (70-100 A) of the human kidney. The
inferiority of cellophane membranes with respect to water permeability
is clearly evident.
     The clearance characteristics of the U-1 membrane are shown in
Figure C. The sharp cutoff characteristics of the UM-1 membrane are
readily visible. This data was extracted from a laboratory study
simulating blood flow.
    This membrane has been shown to be highly compatible with blood.
Proteins do not absorb on the membrane nor are they denatured by
contact with the membrane. The polyelectrolyte complex resin from
which this membrane is produced has also been shown to be non-
thrombogenic in contact with the blood in vivo. These attributes add to
the membrane's desireability for blood purification.
    The system has been designed to maintain a 400 mm  g pressure
drop across the membrane. The design value of.03 cm3/cm  should be
adequate. Values of .05 cm3/cm2min have been obtained during batch
testing, but due to concentration polarizations (mainly proteins), the flux
is generally lower.


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_WINTER, 1971




    In general, the important points to note in this area are:
    1. The ultrafiltration flux is inversely proportional to the protein
concentration.
    2. The flux is approximately proportional to the rate of mixing.
    3. The flux pressure curves are extremely non linear when
ultrafiltering protein solutions. (not shown).
    The decay in ultrafiltration flux occurs as the result of proteins
accumulating on the surface. This accumulation is due to the fact that
protein arrival by convection is greater than their rate of diffusion
away.
    A sketch of the assembled unit is shown in Figure D-F. It consists of
parallel silicone reinforced polyolifin pressure plates fitted with 5 inlet
troughs and 2 exits (one for the ultrafiltrate and one for the concentrated
blood). The membranes are sinusodally curved at angles of 600 with the
horizontal to provide maximum surface area with minimum risk of
destruction of the cell. The membranes are attached to the silicone
plates at the top of each peak as indicated. Dimensions of the unit are as
follows:

    Blood velocities across the membrane are approximately .133 cm

approximate weight of 1.3 pounds.

      Since R' = X'/cos a    = X'/cos 60 =    2X'

unit requires less membrane area than is required for hemodialysis, less
weight and is smaller in size while it more efficiently removes toxins
higher in molecular weight than urea.
     Preliminary data indicates that membrane polarization can be
controlled by this design. Laminar flow of blood in shallow channels
appears to be the most efficient means of controlling polarization.
     In general, the best design for such a unit would be one which
utilizes an internal artificial kidney. Due to the size and complexity of
such a unit, an external design is more feasible. The size of the unit is
limited by the membrane efficiency and power requirements although 3
watts is comparatively small in this case.

     Amicon's Diaflo UM-I membrane appears to be suited for the
development of a blood ultrafilter since it possesses a high clearance
capability for blood toxins, is impermeable to blood proteins and has a
high ultrafiltration rate at low operating pressures. The design using this
membrane should efficiently filter the blood for further purification. The

Vic Taylor is a corrosion specialist for International Nickel at its
testing lab in North Carolina.
"...That old ocean doesn't like us sometimes. She rusts boats, eats
away metals, destroys coatings... what we're trying to do is
come up with alloys she can live with."
Inco's Francis L. LaQue Corrosion Laboratory, at Harbor Island,
N.C., is testing materials needed for ocean engineering, desalination
plants, water and sewage treatment facilities, bridges, boats, even
houses. Testing not just nickel alloys, but 40,000 specimens of
materials from many industries. Alloys, fabrics, coatings.
"...Remember how car bumpers used to corrode? Now it's a different
story. And we're applying this knowledge to many industries. Making
pollution control equipment, for instance, stand up longer than
anyone thought possible."
Undreamed of advances are what Inco men are working for. Men
who develop alloys, test them, search the world for more nickel.
Nickel, the metal that makes other metals stronger, tougher, more
corrosion resistant. Nickel, its contribution is quality.

Xerox:

For engineers

who think

of more than

engineering.


As far as Frank Betron's concerned,
involvement isn't a responsibility that
comes with success... it's a reward.
"I'm happy. And I'm lucky. I've got a
family I love, a beautiful home, and a
job that excites me." Frank's a Senior
Mechanical Engineer with our Business
Products Group in suburban Rochester,
New York. "Things might not have turned
out so well if I hadn't gotten a little
direction and help when I needed it. So all
I'm doing now is passing that help along
to other people."
In this case, the "other people" are
juvenile offenders. As an active member
of the Webster Jaycees, Frank played a
pivotal role in organizing a Committee in
March 1970 to provide man-to-boy
counseling to youngsters on probation.
"I interview each one immediately after
sentencing. Then I get together with the
counselors. We discuss the youth and his
problems at length and decide which of
us is best suited for that particular case."
"For the most part, these kids just need a
little help through a troublesome time in
their lives. We try to provide that help by


building a little bit of trust between the
counselor and the boy."
The desire and need for involvement is a
very personal matter. It takes a sensitivity
to people as individuals. It takes
understanding. It takes a special kind of
man. Like Frank Betron.
Xerox is like that, too. If you seek an
environment where you're appreciated
for the person you are and the engineer
you are, why not talk to Xerox. Your
degree in Engineering or Science may
qualify you for openings in a variety of
advanced development, product design
and manufacturing engineering areas.
We're located in suburban Rochester,
New York. See your Placement Director for
a copy of our brochure and for the date
of our scheduled campus interviews. Or,

People going to work.


What will they do

when they get there?


Will the work be too hard to take,
or too easy to be interesting? What
will it accomplish?
  That's what "industrial engineer-
ing" is all about, even where it does
not go by that name. As a branch
of engineering, a good bit of it orig-
inated in our plants over the past 50
years. Viewpoints have been chang-
ing. The futility in thinking of a
work force as abstract units instead
of fellow humans is now well un-
derstood. This attitude is not in-


consistent with designing of jobs by
rational analysis, including mathe-
matical modeling, instead of tradi-
tion.
  Some formally educated indus-
trial engineers, as well as mechani-
cal and chemical engineers who
think this sort of work might be
worth doing (for rather decent pay
and benefits) will be invited to prac-
tice it with us after they finish on
campus at the end of the present
academic year or term.

Onyour wayup


  inengineering,


                         please take


               the world


               with yOu.
                  The best engineers are far from happy with the world
               the way it is.
                  The way it is, kids choke on polluted air. Streets are
               jammed by cars with no place to go. Lakes and rivers are a
               common dumping ground for debris of all kinds.
                  But that's not the way it has to be.
                  Air pollution can be controlled. Better transportation
               systems can be devised. There can be an almost unlimited
               supply of clean water.
                  The key is technology. Technology and the engineers
               who can make it work.
                  Engineers at General Electric are already working
               on these problems. And on other problems that need to be
               solved. Disease. Hunger in the world. Crime in the streets.
                  General Electric engineers don't look for overnight
               solutions. Because there aren't any. But with their
               training and with their imagination, they're making
               steady progress.
                  Maybe you'd like to help. Are you the kind of engineer
               who can grow in his job to make major contributions?
               The kind of engineer who can look beyond his immediate
               horizons? Who can look at what's wrong with the world
               and see ways to correct it?
                  If you are, General Electric needs you.
               The world needs you.

WE HAVE














SOLUTIONS TO

EVERYDA Y PROBLEMS.

In this instance, we've just removed a traffic-snarling casualty
from a crowded expressway. Now, we'll concede that this
might be considered a relatively modest contribution towards
improving the human environment.
But... this same Sikorsky@ helicopter could have been
effecting a rescue mission off a wallowing tanker in a North
Sea gale. It could have been airlifting food and supplies to
starving villagers in flood-ravaged Tunisia . . or transporting
equipment for on-the-spot control of off-shore oil pollution.
Obviously, what we're pointing out is the impressive record
and adaptability of our helicopters in solving important
human problems.
There's much more to come in our world of exciting, advanced
VTOL aircraft systems. For example, Heavy-Lift Skycranes@
and Tilt-Rotor Transports. And just around the corner are our
High-Speed Commercial Transports-designed to ease
short-haul mass-transportation headaches.
Does this kind of engineering attitude stir your sense of
responsibility and imagination? Then you should talk careers
with us. There's ample opportunity for innovation in:
aerodynamics * human factors engineering * automatic
controls * structures engineering * weight prediction *
systems analysis * operations research * reliability/
maintainability engineering * autonavigation systems *
computer technology... and more.
And your career advancement can be accelerated through our
corporation-financed Graduate Study Programs-available at
many outstanding schools within our area.

Technical Employment.


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEERWINTER, 1971























  The fastest changing elements of our society over
the last five to ten years have been our priorities. At
the recent meeting with the student body, Dean
Hoelscher stated that the School of Engineering
must change with the changing priorities.
  When Sputnik hurtled around the world in 1957,
the leaders of the nation decided that we must beat
the Russians to wherever they were going. If we were
to beat the Russians, we needed engineering
superiority. At that time, most of the top engineers in
each field came from about 20 top colleges in the
country. The plan was implemented to build ad-
ditional centers of excellence at existing schools.
Through many departments of the government,
money was funnelled into engineering and science
schools. From  the gleeming new   edifices of
education poured highly competent technocrats.
These graduates were highly sought and well paid
through the sixties in research, seventy per cent of
which was financed by the government. The
research supported our space program and war
effort in Southeast Asia. War machinery and space
hardware required much more engineering talent
than consumer goods and products for social im-
provement. The increased production of top quality
engineers was created and   used by the im-
plementation of the post-Sputnik priorities.
    By the end of the sixties, we began reaping the
bitter fruits produced by social neglect and in-
ternational irresponsibility. Beginning with Watts,
social convulsions of frustration spontaneously
erupted and raged in the rotting cores of our inner
cities. Our nation, sick of the war crimes we commit
daily in Asia, and the waste of American lives, now
wants out of Vietnam (73 per cent in a recent poll).
The people no longer grasp the esoteric reasons for
continuing the space program when our cities, the
nucleii of our society, are becoming more inoperable
because of their long-term low priority status.
    The priorities have changed, if only in the wants
of the people. They want out of the war in Southeast


Asia now. They want to stop wasting exorbitant
amounts of money on the space program. The
people's representatives, as usual, are hard of
hearing. We don't know from day to day what
country our President is going to have us invading
next and the statesmen representing the aerospace
industry have invented another money-disposal
system, the SST.
    How can the School of Engineering at Pitt
respond responsibly to the will of the people and to
the needs of the struggling city of Pittsburgh?
Because our Engineering School is one of the new
centers of excellence, not many of the graduates of
center city schools such as Schenley, Fifth Avenue,
and Westinghouse, are academically competent to
matriculate at the School of Engineering. We are
providing  bigger and  better things for the
academically well-groomed progeny of the great
white noose, while taking up more taxable land and
rendering it untaxable. To cease to be a leech on our
troubled  city, I suggest that the  School of
Engineering should lessen the rigor of its courses,
lower its admission requirements, and thus make
possible the admission of more center city high
school graduates.
    The creative development for the priorities of
the seventies has already been done. Prototypes
already exist for planned communities, mass transit,
pollution control, and health care. Less rigorously
trained engineering graduates would more than
suffice to produce and implement the tools for social
improvement. The School of Engineering would, at
the same time, be helping to end the cycle of poverty
in the inner city, while dispelling the aspect of a
hopeless future for many young men and women of
Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh doesn't need another Carnegie
Mellon; it needs a school to educate and serve its
residents. Our nation  doesn't need  another
engineering marvel. It needs rebuilt and restructured
communities, good mass transit, universal health
care, a cleaned-up environment and good education
for the masses.
