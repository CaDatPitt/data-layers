Converting
Refuse to

Resource with

Environmental Engineering

While many engineers are working in developing ”high
technology”, Environmental Engineers are dealing with the
daily problems due to human processes. Working in con-
junction with sewage treatment plants, they are trying to
overcome the problem of sewage sludge. Sewage sludge,
affectionately known as ”biological mess,” consists of organic
compounds like human wastes, hair, seeds, food scraps, and
bacteria from sewage treatment processes. The United States
will provide ‘seven million metric tons of sludge this year
alone. Sanitary landfill is the most economical technique for
ultimate disposal of sludge, but, unfortunately, this sludge
treatment often leads to ground water pollution due to the
production of leachate wastewater.

Dr. Yeun Wu of Pitt's Environmental Engineering Program.

by Laurie Peach and Carmen Whitson

The backbone of the movement to overcome waste is
Dr. Yeun Wu, of the Civil Engineering Department here at the
University of Pittsburgh. In cooperation with the Environ-
mental Research Laboratory, he is developing a new process
for reducing the volume of sludge, while at the same time
producing methane gas for a fuel resource.

At present, a one—stage anaerobic (non—aerated) digestion
system is being used. Within this system are three reaction
steps: 1) hydrolisis — the breaking up of high molecular
organic polymers, 2] the conversion of organic compounds to
volatile acids, and 3) the conversion of volatile acids to
methane gas.

Dr. Wu is breaking this one stage system into three steps,
in order to let each reaction do the work of one step,
eliminating interference of the three reactions. This increases
the efficiency of the process. Wu’s goal is to reduce the
volume of sludge being sent to filtration plants.

The sludge that Wu receives is generated at ALCOSAN,
the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority. At ALCOSAN, the
wastewater is sent through two different treatments to
remove both carbonaceous and nitrogeneous substances. The
primary treatment simply involves the settling out of solids by
gravity. In the secondary treatment, micro—organisms are
cultivated in an aerated tank where they are able to consume
carbon and nitrogen. A balance between the food source and
the biomass (bacteria) must be strictly maintained in this treat-
ment. For example, sludge organisms may or may not grow in
industrial wastewater because of the lack of certain nutrients.

There are three methods in use to accomplish the secon-
dary process: 1) the Activated Sludge process, 2) biofiltration
in a packed-bed reactor (the Trickling Filter process), and the
most recently used, 3) Rotating Biological Contactors (RBC)
process. The RBC process utilizes a rotating disc which
provides a large surface area for the growth of heterogeneous
bacteria. This bacteria continuously makes contact with the

wastewater and air in order to remove the organic pollutants
in the wastewater. After being treated and processed, the
sludge is sent to a filtration plant which removes close to
eighty percent of the water and buries what is left as landfill.

A large-scale pilot plant, using the three reaction steps
mentioned previously, has been constructed in Dr. Wu’s
laboratory. It utilizes anaerobic digestion, which not only
eliminates the need for oxygen, but also generates useful
methane fuel gas.

The pilot plant uses old concepts in an innovative proc-
ess sequence. Traditional anaerobic systems operate at one
temperature, typically ninety-five degree Fahrenheit. Wu’s
system will operate at two temperatures, thereby providing a
maximum cross—section of bacteria types to digest the sludge
feed. Mesophilic bacteria, obtained locally from Sandy Creek,
exists at ninety-five degrees. The Thermophilic bacteria used
in the last step exists at 122 degrees and must be imported
from Rockville Waste Treatment plant in New York City. In
order to eliminate foaming problems in the gas production
stages, a predigestion is used to break down fats, oils and
greases.

Solids, heavy metals, and pesticides remaining in the
digester effluent are chemically removed in a specialized tank
called a clarifier. The material then undergoes a treatment
called wet air oxidation. Another ten percent of sludge is
removed by the combustion of materials dissolved in water at
a high temperature and pressure [500°F and 1500 PSI). Any
toxic organic compounds, if present in the sludge solids, are
broken down by oxidation into simpler less harmful forms.
Fifty to eighty percent of the organic material is converted to
carbon dioxide and water.

Dr. Wu’s research is conducted in a laboratory located on
the ninth floor of Benedum Hall.

One of the three reaction steps in Dr. Wu’s process occurs
in this transparent chamber.

Working on the experiment with Dr. Wu are six graduate
students and a postdoctoral research associate, Dr. Susan
Landon—Arnold. Dr. Arnold, a microbiologist, was hired to
identify the species of anaerobic microorganisms used in
Wu’s process.

Besides his laboratory work, Dr. Wu is now chairing the
Wastewater Filtration Committee of the American Society of
Civil Engineers, and is responsible for organizing the European
Water Control Association. He is also chairman of the inter-
national Conference on Fixed Film Biological Processes. Next
year's conference will take place in Washington, D.C., on July
10-12, and in 1986 it will be held in Tokyo, Japan. The idea
behind the conference is to further the understanding of the
application of biofilm technology for water pollution control.

Before coming to Pitt, Dr. Wu studied in Taiwan where
he received his Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. He then
went on to Oklahoma State for his Master's and finally to the
University of Michigan for his Doctorate in Environmental
Engineering.

Since he started at Pitt eight years ago, Dr. Wu has prac-
tically built the Environmental program. Should he succeed in
his current project, he would put Pitt at the forefront of
sewage sludge disposal technology.

The authors extend their appreciation to D. C. O/mstead,
a graduate student in civil engineering who is assisting in
Dr. Wu’s research.

Major College

Sports Programs:

Are They Fair

by Mark McKrell

Most major colleges and universities have, or want to
have, highly successful athletic programs. Many reasons can
be cited for this, including student participation, but money
and visibility are large motivations. Football and basketball
are the so called major sports which are given a large amount
of television exposure. This provides the school with visibility
and money. Visibility comes from being on the television a lot,
which makes people aware of your school. Would you even
know some schools existed if you hadn’t seen their team on
television? Television networks pay out hundreds of
thousands of dollars for the right to broadcast collegiate foot-
ball and basketball games. This places a premium on success
because good teams are shown on television. The best foot-
ball teams in the country participate in bowl games when the
regular season is over, which can pay the participating schools
as much as one million dollars or more. Filling a fifty thousand
seat stadium also generates a lot of revenue; people want to
come and see a winner.

A successful team requires talented and dedicated
athletes. Many hours of preparation are required in order to
gain success in a sport. Let's take football for example: On the
average, each player spends anywhere from two to four hours
practicing each day. Many players watch films in order to
learn the tendencies of the opposing team and to see the
abilities of the players they will be competing against. Some
players lift weights during the season which requires even
more time. Even when the season is over, players still must
put a lot of time into weightlifting and keeping in shape. Other
sports require large amounts of travel time. Basketball teams
might play three or four games in a week all over the United
States.

to the Athlete?

Most people are aware of the time demands placed on
students. High level courses require large amounts of time
and effort. Some students refer to college work as a full—time
job. This creates a large problem for athletes. Can an athlete
be a success in his sport and in the classroom? The answer
depends on the individual, but for the most part it would
seem like something has to give. Extremely talented indi-
viduals might enjoy a high degree of success at both, but it is
difficult even for them. An average student would have
trouble majoring in pre—med or engineering if he lost three or
four hours a day to football practice. He would find very little
time to work on the weekends because that is when the
games take place. If he is expected to put up to forty hours a
week into his sport, can we expect him to also excel in the
classroom? This is the equivalent of working a full—time job
and taking a full course load at the same time.

Athletes face disadvantages in other areas of their life as
well. Their social life often gets cut back while trying to
balance school work with sports. The high visibility of athletes
can also be a drawback. Any offense they might commit or
small thing they may do can easily be blown out of propor-
tion. Newspapers occasionally print small offenses of athletes
which results in negative public opinion towards the athletes.

Athletes face definite disadvantages, but they have
many advantages the average student doesn't. In many
universities, they stay in better dorms and eat better food.
High visibility can be turned into an advantage by the
popularity and respect which is gained through good perform-
ance. Financial aid is a major advantage to athletes. Col-
lege scholarships can be attained for good size and speed just
as easily as they can for exceptional grades and college board

scores. Athletes with enough talent can go on to the
astronomical salaries of professional sports. The sheer enjoy-
ment of playing a sport is another plus.

The athletes can feel a great amount of pressure on
them to perform well and win. Our society puts a great em-
phasis on winning. The performance of a coach is evaluated
by his won—lost record, not by the values and the self-
discipline he teaches his players. College athletic programs
are evaluated by the money they make, so pressure to win
exists from school administrators as well. In many respects,
we are losing the ability to treat sports as just a game.
Athletics are considered fun only if you win. A famous
football coach had the following statement attributed to
him, ”Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.” While win-
ning is the goal, one must remember there is also a loser to
every game.

moment. Some athletes anticipate professional sports careers
and take classes only to stay eligible for their sport. Others
make their sport their primary concern and never really make
a responsible choice of a college major. Others take course
work they can handle in the limited time they will have
instead of tackling a tougher major which they are equally
capable of. These are the people who are affected by the
system. Many college athletes don't have the talent for
professional sports and aren't getting an education which will
help them succeed in life. These people aren't able to take
advantage of their academic abilities and end up in positions
far below their level of talent. Those who aren't academically
talented and can't play professional sports aren't really losing
anything. They get an opportunity to extend their athletic
careers and be in the public eye, but don't really lose out in
their ultimate career choices.

1'. ' Y 4..

Since societal attitudes aren't likely to change overnight,
how does this affect the athlete? The victors can expect
adulation while the losers will be asked why they didn't win.
Quarterbacks who get intercepted when the game is on the
line can expect to hear boos. Athletes who give their best
effort and are not paid for it are judged by people who may
not even understand the sport. Most athletes are willing to
face this pressure because of the stature they will achieve if
they succeed.

Athletes in many ways reflect the attitudes of society.
Youngsters often dream of being sports stars, but they usually
don't even think about being a chemist or an accountant. If
the youngster has the talent to participate in collegiate
athletics, he can get carried away and want to be treated like
a star. Many athletes anticipate stardom and big money in the
professional ranks. This is foolish because only a select few
ever play professional sports. Injury can end a career at any

11

The only answer to this problem is to release the time
burden from the athlete. If we want student—athletes, we must
allow them to be both. Somehow and in someway the partici-
pation time must be lessened if we are going to be fair to our
athletes. The coaches, the school administrators, and the
athletes themselves are qualified to decide in what areas
these cuts should take place. Another factor in solving the
problem would be the education of our high school athletes
in what to look for in choosing a school. A good balance
between sports and academics should be taught to these
future collegiate athletes. They should be well aware of the
fact that they have little chance of making the professional
sports ranks. We have a responsibility to these young athletes
which is difficult to realize but certainly attainable. Without
drastically changing the system, we can make it possible to be
a true student-athlete. If individuals are then not prepared to
face life, they will have only themselves to blame.

Are you described below?

Some time ago a thought occurred to me. I kept hearing
about the so called ”typicaI engineer.” Most of the talk was
from CAS students and concerned how socially undesirable
this creature was. Since I consider a great many of the engi-
neers that I know to be socially quite nice, I find this sort of
thing rather annoying. The thought that occurred was to find
out just what these people think a typical engineer to be.

Thus a survey was born. I consulted with a great many
people (at least three) about what kinds of questions to ask. I
added a few of my own. Once I had my questions, I mimeo
graphed about one hundred of them. These were then handed
to a few helpful friends for distribution. Within a week I had
the completed forms. End step one.

Medium rare results are in the table in this article. They
are processed to the point of being converted from ordinary
numbers to percentages of the group responding. (The table
is that thing with all the white spaces around the letters. This
makes it easy to read.)

As an overweight guru once said, ”What does it all
mean?” I went through the results and tried to find out. Start
step two.

According to the 73 people surveyed, a whopping 84%
thought that an engineering stereotype exists. This wasn't
really surprising, considering how many people had already
told me as much.

Of this 84%, the general opinion was that some or even
most of the engineers they know fit this stereotype. This
doesn't seem all that good. If that large a part of the engineer-
ing body fits a stereotype, we're looking at a major trend.

Fortunately, we do seem to be friendly people. 92% of
the people who filled out the survey have friends who are
engineers. And only 33% of those surveyed have engineers as
enemies. Not too bad, all things considered.

Question five is the one that I worked the most on. What
I was looking for was a comparison of engineers and the other
students here. The results seem to define the engineering
stereotype.

According to the answers I got, engineers as a group tend
to be very studious and serious. They have short hair and
seem to dress much like anyone else. They're very organized
compared to other people. Quiet is the norm. I don't know
how to interpret the percentage of nearsighted. I meant to ask
about needing glasses, but several people pointed out that the
question could also be about the ability to plan ahead.

CAS people tend to think of engineers as intelligent, but
feel that CAS students have more common sense. Engineer
seem to be loners compared to other students.

It seemed to follow that people tend to think that these
serious loner engineers party less than everyone else. I might
note that a good friend of mine in CAS told me that I should
have had a question asking how hard engineers party in com-
parison to other people.

12

What’s in

Conversation is a large part of how we judge people. Un-
fortunately, according to the survey, a lot of people think that
engineers tend to talk of little but engineering. That might be a
large part of the stereotype problem right there. Few engineers
would go out of their way to listen to someone speak of the
intricacies of, say, child psychology. If an engineer spends his
lunch speaking of transitors, there's a problem. CAS students
find transistors of little interest, and will regard those who
speak of such as inhabitants of the Twilight Zone.

The next most common thing listed was money. It seems
some people are out there boasting, folks. This was followed
by the other sex, sports, and politics as being common con-
versational topics. A space was left for other answers. It was
not good to see that 8% of those surveyed find that engineers
like to talk about themselves.

I wanted to get the opinions of these CAS students on
why engineers are viewed as being different. The reply I got
was that the biggest contributing factors are, in order, work
load, goals, scheduling, and electronic calculators. All work
and no play makes John E. a dull boy?

These are the specific results of the survey. Write in answers with less
than 4% of those surveyed are summed up under ”Other.”

a Major?

So there you have it. The results indicate that the CAS
people surveyed think that engineers tend to fit a certain
stereotype. This stereotype is that of a person who is serious,
quiet, and short—haired. This theoretical engineer is organized,
perhaps even overorganized, smart but a loner, and a little
lacking in common sense. Is this you?

Why the Stereotype?

It's undeniable that an engineering stereotype exists. A
stereotype rarely exists without a model. And it's true that a
lot of our friendly fellow engineers fit in this slot. Is this good
or bad?

The stereotype that I keep hearing about is that of a
studious person who's very organized but a little short on
common sense. CAS students sometimes find this kind of
engineer to be a hard person to hold long conversations with. I

think that most engineers have had to deal with this type

casting at one time or another. It’s not nice to be considered a
social detriment.

What makes people think that all engineers are this way?
Much of the problem may have to do with the visibility of the
”engineer.” Everyone know an ”engineer” who always carries
his calculator, studies constantly, and has great difficulty in
speaking coherently. One may be sitting near you now. This
individual can be spotted at distances of over one hundred
yards. It's not surprising that many engineers are typed as
being this way, even though this kind of ”engineer” is in the
small minority. I think that it's common for people to general-
ize from this very visible group.

Another thing that separates engineers is their own atti-
tudes. We have only seven engineering schools, whereas CAS
has more than fifty. Engineers Week is often viewed with great
puzzlement by people who have classes with any particular
person only once a week. This group identity is great for engi-
neers, but may keep others at a distance.

Engineers do study hard. How many of you listen in dis-
belief when a friend tells you that his thirteen credits of Psych
and Music are killing him? There are people who work as hard
engineers. I'm not trying to put down CAS students. But the
truth of the matter is that many people in this University have
lighter course loads. With lighter loads, they study less, and
think that engineers work too much.

The most important factor in my opinion, however, is
that engineers sometimes have a hard time finding things in
common with non—engineers. Most people have a hard time
talking with a person who has been thinking of moments of
inertia all day. This is a serious problem. If the only people
that an engineer had to deal with were other engineers this
might be OK. But the vast majority of people in this world
aren't engineers. It might be a real good idea for some engi-
neers to learn how to speak of other things. Take some writing
courses. Take some literature classes. Become a rounded
person. I don't think that you'll regret it.

There are reasons by engineers are considered different.
They rarely share classes with people outside their major.
Workloads are heavy. The subject matter they study, is quite
different. Engineers have to study hard. Their communication
skills aren't always up to par. These things may never change.
Not all of them are desirable. Some, like the lack of com-
munication skills, are downright detrimental. But I think
everyone should realize that the stereotype is just that. A
stereotype. The people who really fit it are few and far
between, So, the next time someone tells you that they're an
engineer, don't make assumptions based on the stereotype.
You’re quite likely wrong.

A special thanks is extended to Rebecca Marshall and
Laurel jamieson for passing out the survey, and to John
Myers for helping with the tabulation of the survey
results.

Administration Restructures
Freshman Department

Since April the Freshman Engineering Department has
been restructured. The Student Affairs office, the Engineering
Career Guidance office, and the Impact Program, previously
separate entities, have been moved to the seventh floor and
combined under the title Freshman Engineering Department.
This change was precipitated when Emil Deleo, the director of
Engineering Records, retired and Mr. Chuck Aveni left the
University. Each office has retained its original function with
Dr. McCormick serving as coordinator. Ms. Lori Shuff-Vozza
is Director of Engineering Career Guidance, Carl Lewis directs
the Impact Program, and Dr. McCormick is in charge of
Student Affairs. The departmental office is now located in
room 749.

from freshman groups will be posted on this board.

Preview Program Needs Guides

On October 29 the University will sponsor the Pitt Engi-
neering Preview (PEP) Program. High school students inter-
ested in engineering and their parents are invited to attend the
PEP program which includes a tour of the campus and seats
at the Pitt versus Syracuse football game. The program,
organized by Ms. Lori Shuff-Vozza, requires fifteen tour
guides. Anyone interested in showing prospective engineering
students around the campus should contact Lori Vozza in
room 749 or phone 624-5264.

Impact Program Proves Effective

Impact is a ten year old engineering program designed to
aid minority and disadvantaged high school students who do
not quite qualify for placement in the School of Engineering.
The student who participates in Impact spends six weeks after
high school graduation studying mathematics, science, com-
munications, and computer programming to upgrade his
skills. Impact, directed by Carl Lewis, will keep track of the
student's progress until graduation, providing tutoring, coun-
seling, financial aid, and placement services. Approximately
92% of freshman Impact students successfully complete their
first year. Upperclass Impact students provide the majority of
the tutoring services, but any qualified student may apply to
tutor. Any questions about the program should be directed to
Stewart Attwater in room 746.

(1') The crew of Ronnie the race car driver told him that
he would have to average 73 miles per hour to tie Ricky the
race car driver. However, Ronnie got his digits reversed and
only averaged 37 miles per hour the first half of the race.
Ronnie decided to speed up the second half of the race so he
could tie Ricky. What is Ronnie's intended average speed, in
miles per hour, during the second half of the race?

 

(2) A certain old man is X years old. The eldest of his Y

Books you may have missed,

by Andrew Szeri

This series of articles is dedicated to the passing on of
the discovery of a few excellent books. It is not meant to be a
rarified and academic consideration of these books, but a
discussion of the aspects of each book which make it good
reading.

In this first article, let us look at L’Assommoir by Emile
Zola. This novel was written and set in Paris in the1870’s — or
rather the poorer outskirts of Paris. It details the rise and fall
of a likeable young woman named Cervaise.

The novel begins with an argument between Gervaise
and Lantier, her livein lover. Lantier marches off in a rage,
leaving Cervaise to care for their two young sons. Cervaise
manages to keep her little family going through her work as a
laundress for the women of her neighborhood. She begins to
rise in her profession, taking on jobs requiring ever greater
skill, and, meanwhile, amassing a respectable amount of
savings.

Soon, Cervaise meets an equally hardworking and
honest man named Copeau. After they are married, Copeau
moves into Gervaise’s two room apartment. They live fru-
gally for many months, trying to save enough money from
Cervaise’s laundering and Copeau’s work as a roofer to enable
them to rent a nicer apartment. Just when they are about to
look for a new home, Copeau suffers a terrible fall on the job,
breaking his leg. His wife refuses to allow him to be taken to
the hospital. Instead, after work, she cares for him herself.
Gervaise works very hard during his recuperation, and at last
realizes her dream. She rents a small laundry shop of her own
with a larger apartment for her family behind.

As Cervaise’s shop does very well from the beginning,
Copeau delays his return to work. He becomes quite fond of
taking strolls (to strengthen his leg), of sitting around the shop
(to rest his leg), and of having a drink at a local tavern,
L’Assommoir, with his friends. Copeau slides ever faster into
the tavern-goers life — drinking up Cervaise’s profits in the
process. She tries half-heartedly to stop him but is really too
involved in her business to be insistent about his recovery.

One evening in the tavern, Copeau meets and befriends
Lantier, Cervaise’s old lover. As there is an extra room in their
apartment, Copeau invites Lantier to take the room and live
with them. Lantier promises to pay a fee for his room and
board, each month, but he never actually gets around to
handing them the money.

As well as resuming her affair with Lantier now that they
are under the same roof, Cervaise joins Copeau on his nightly
binges at L’Assommoir. She reasons that if someone must
drink up her profits, it may as well be her. Gervaise’s work
suffers because she is forever recovering from wild nights with
Lantier or from drinking with Copeau. She loses customers
rapidly and is soon unable to pay the rent. When they are
evicted from the shop and their apartment, they move to in-

18

 

ferior rooms at the top floor of a tenement house. Cervaise,
quickly becoming a physical wreck, goes back to working for
the other women of the neighborhood.

To finance their bouts of drinking, Cervaise and Copeau
pawn everything they own. When Cervaise loses even her
odd—jobs, Copeau goes insane due to his forced abstinence. In
the final, tragic scene of the book, Cervaise attempts prostitu-
tion, but is rejected by all. She meets an old acquaintance of
her younger and more vivacious days on her way home. In
comparing herself to him, she realizes the full extent of her
loss.

This sounds like a rather heavy and depressing plot, but
it is not the plot that makes this novel interesting and read-
able. Zola is known for his naturalistic description, and it is
this that holds the reader's interest. He paints fascinating
pictures of the smallest of events. In the following passage
he creates a backdrop to a dinner party. ”The two waiters
sewing them were wearing grease—stained jackets and aprons
of a rather dubious whiteness. Through the four windows
that opened onto the acacias in the courtyard, bright daylight
entered . . . The light reflected from the humid corner of trees
tinged the haze—fi|led room with green and made leaf
shadows dance on the tablecloth, from which came a vague
aroma of dampness and mildew.”

Zola’s naturalistic description is most moving, however,
when he exposes the victims of social injustice. He writes of a
carpenter too old to get work: ”Gervaise felt the most pity,
however, for old Bru in his cubbyhole under the staircase,
where he hibernated like a badger, rolling himself into a ball
to feel the cold less, lying there on some straw without
moving for days at a time. Even hunger no longer drove him
out, for there was no use taking a walk to improve the ap-
petite when no one had invited him for dinner.”

The entire novel is richly filled with scenes like those you
have read here. While no mention is made of characteriza-
tion, it, too, is an enjoyable aspect of this book. We have all
known Cervaises’ and Copeaus’ and maybe even Lantiers’.
Also there are many realistic and interesting secondary
characters to be enjoyed. But it is a few vivid, humanist scenes
that stay with you for a long time that make this a truly
memorable novel.

Create computers that
capture the mysteries
of common sense.

The brain does it naturally. It
wonders. it thinks with spon-
taneity—advantages we haven't
been able to give computers.
We’ve made them “smart',' able
to make sophisticated calcula-
tions at very fast speeds. But we
have yet to get them to act with
insight, instinct, and intuition.

But what if we could devise
ways to probe into the inner na-
ture of human thought? So com-
puters could follow the same
rationale and reach the same
conclusions a person would.‘

An equal opportunity employer

What if we could actually design
computers to capture the myster-
ies of common sense?

At GE, we've already begun to
implement advances in knowl-
edge engineering. We are cod-
ifying the knowledge, intuition
and experience of expert engi-
neers and technicians into com-
puter algorithms for diagnostic
troubleshooting. At present, we
are applying this breakthrough to
diesel electric locomotive sys-
tems to reduce the number of
engine teardowns for factory
repair as well as adapting this
technology to affect savings in
other areas of manufacturing.

We are also looking at parallel
processing, a method that
divides problems into parts
and attacks them simultaneously,
rather than sequentially, the way

the human brain might.

While extending technology
and application of computer
systems is important, the real
excitement and the challenge of
knowledge engineering is its
conception. At the heart of all
expert systems are master engi-
neers and technicians, preserv-
ing their knowledge and
experience, questioning their
logic and dissecting their
dreams. As one young employee
said, ‘At GE, we're not just shap-
ing machines and technology.
We’re shaping opportunity.”

Thinking about the possibili-
ties is the first step to making
things happen. And it all starts
with an eagerness to dream,

a willingness to dare and the
determination to make visions,
reality.

If you can dream it,
you can do it. _

On the cover

A fine day, fresh air and a serene lake to fish in; where
better could a student spend his time? Observant Pitt students
with classes above the third floor in Benedum Hall share the
secret of Benedum Lake. Located atop Benedum Auditorium,

this elusive freshwater body forms regularly after any sub-

stantial rainfall. Boating is strictly prohibited but anglers have
here any idyllic location for fishing and relaxation. For the
benefit of our readers, a map of the lake is offered below. The

lake's configuration varies from day to day, however, and in-

terested readers are advised to make a visual check from the
fourth floor of Benedum before planning an outing.

The Skyscraper staff extends its thanks to Dean William
Rudoy and Bill Renk of Benedum’s physical plant staff for
arranging our roof—top expedition. Ken Gettian served as our
guide during the ascent to the lake. Special credit is also given
to Steve Frezza, who was our peaceful fisherman, and LuAnne
Schmidt, who provided props for the photograph. Assistance
in equipment transportation and setup was rendered by Rita
Cinquegrane and Ray Balister. Our wilderness photographer
was Mike Murray.

From the editor

by Joe Samosky

This past summer, Mr. Charles Aveni ended ten years of
continuous service with Pitt's School of Engineering. Follow-
ing the retirement of Mr. Emil Deleo of the engineering
records’ office this spring, Mr. Aveni and the administration of
the engineering school could not reach agreement on the
terms of his responsibilities toward Mr. De|eo’s vacant posi-
tion. Following subsequent action by both parties, Mr. Aveni’s
contract was not continued this year. His departure from the
school is a very personal loss to those of us who worked close
ly with him.

Mr. Aveni had worked at the University of Pittsburgh
during the 1960's in the Office of Development and Alumni
Affairs. He returned to this office in June of 1973 after a
period away from the University. A year and a half later, he
entered the position of Director of Career Guidance for the
Engineering School. In 1976 he became involved with the stu-
dent affairs program and eventually found his home with the
student affairs and freshman programs. Previous to Mr.
Aveni’s involvement with these programs, academic coordi-
nating and scheduling services existed but there was no
formal advising or counseling. Mr. Aveni brought a very
personal approach to his work, and it was this personal in-
volvement which endeared him to the students of the engi-
neering school.

Chuck Aveni soon touched many aspects of student
activities at Pitt, including the Pitt Engineering Impact
Program (PEI-P), Alumni Affairs and the University Honors Pro
gram. In conjunction with Dr. Alec Stewart, Aveni served as
an informal liaison with the Sophomore Honors in Engineering
program. His background in English eventually landed him
the responsibility of reviewing and approving every master's
thesis and doctoral dissertation put through the engineering
school. These responsibilities, however, never eclipsed Mr.
Aveni’s uncompromising dedication to the freshman students.

The first year of college is an exciting, yet confusing and
occasionally frightening time. Mr. Aveni was generally among
the first administrators a freshman or prospective freshman
dealt with. His friendly manner, positive outlook and fatherly
concern were a great benefit to many students during this im-
portant transition time. Much could be said to describe
Aveni’s approach to his duties, but his attitude may be
summed up in one statement: He loved his work. In a large,
often impersonal university, Mr. Aveni employed a warm,
welcoming touch in the treatment of ”his kids.” Whether he
was lecturing to a student with a low QPA, adjusting the
schedules of hundreds of freshmen, or settling back in his
chair telling stories of ranching in Nevada, his concern and
genuine dedication to his duties impressed itself upon those
with whom he dealt.

/ _'_3_ .' l. ‘
A ‘ l v
' v

These qualities, however intangible they may seem, were
vitally important to Mr. Aveni’s success as an advisor. The
freshman year is a time of challenges, successes and failures.
For many it is a time of searching for self definition and
direction. Such matters are the crucial process of growth and
life. While the classroom provides for academic growth and
development, equally important is the development of
character, goals and a realization of one’s part in the univer-
sity and community. Counseling and guidance assist this proc-
ess, and Mr. Aveni’s door was always open to those who
sought his assistance. To Chuck Aveni, a student’s problem
was his problem. It is this uncompromising concern for the
welfare of the students that befriended so many to ’’Uncle
Chuck.”

in the past years Mr. Aveni has helped to direct the
course of hundreds of engineering students. He leaves behind
him a living legacy of his work in the lives of those whom he
has touched. I, the staff, and the members of the Engineering
Student Cabinet express our appreciation to Mr. Aveni for the
assistance he has provided to us as faculty advisor for both
the ESC and Skyscraper Engineer.

Mr. Aveni once said that there are only two types of
students: those that he could help, and those that are beyond
help. His record seems to indicate that few of his students
were beyond his help. The staff of Skyscraper extends its
sincere wish for Mr. Aveni’s continued success, happiness and
peace in the future.

The topic of alcohol use in the university community has
received special attention for the past year at the University of
Pittsburgh. This term marks the implementation of a new
campus alcohol policy and the beginning of the dry rush
system for Pitt fraternities. Last spring at a meeting of the Inter-
fraternity Council, Pitt's fraternities voted to ban the serving of
alcohol to prospective new members [rushees] during the week
of fraternity parties and activities that constitutes open rush.
Under the new system, a fraternity caught serving alcohol
during open rush may be fined up to $500 and be suspended
from inter-mura/ sports competition. Skyscraper Engineer here
presents two opposing views of the dry rush system. The issues
involved, however, extend beyond the dry rush policy to
include general considerations of alcohol use both in the Greek
system and in the entire university community.

The Dry Look Is In
by Dave Crone

”How could there be a successful rush without alcohol?”
”No one would come to the parties.” These were common
fears among fraternity members when |.F.C. proposed a dry
rush policy. Why would representatives of Pitt's fraternities
propose a rule that would surely be cause for a poor rush?
Everyone knew rushees only went to parties to drink beer. Or
did they?

The fraternities were met with a seemingly odd group of
rushees this fall. These rushees were actually interested in the
fraternity system. They asked questions, listened to the
answers, and asked more questions. Rushing seemed too easy.
The rushees were eager to hear all a brother could tell them
about the house, the brotherhood, and the advantages of join-
ing a fraternity. Surprise! Maybe dry rush wasn't such a bad
idea after all.

Could people have fun without alcohol? The answer at
this writer's house was an overwhelming ”Yes!” Granted, there
were only about half as many people at the first parties as in
previous terms. The difference, though, was in the attitude of
those who did attend. They did not attend to get drunk, but to

  
   

learn about the fraternity and about the fraternity system in
general.

The whole atmosphere was different. Instead of keeping
a watchful eye out for drunk partiers who might start a fight
or vandalize the house, it was possible to relax and really talk
to people. Isn’t that what rush is all about?

The most frequent complaints from fraternity members
were due to a lack of ideas for dry rush parties and the dread-
ful thought of talking to a stranger while sober. Dry rush
posed a challenge to the fraternities at Pitt. Something had to
be done to attract people to the parties; the more inventive
fraternities would come out ahead.

At this writer's house planning began at the end of winter
term, 1983, and continued through September. A 300—watt
sound system was rented, and special lighting effects were set
up by some of the brothers. By the beginning of rush, the main
room had been transformed into a dance hall. The planning
paid off; the number of people at the parties steadily in-
creased as rush progressed. Most people heard of the parties
through word of mouth, showing that people were having fun.

The results of rush: far less damage to the house than
usual, an above average pledge class, and a good time for all
who attended. With proper planning and a little imagination,
dry rush can work.

The Need For Alcohol
by John Gargani

It's often difficult for a non—Creek to understand the im-
portance of a fraternity to its members. Fraternal life is not
merely an activity that looks good on a resume, it is a lifelong
commitment to a set of ideals and principles. Of course, each
fraternity has a different set of values. However, each frater~
nity holds one precept in common with every other fraternity
— that of self—preservation.

Many fraternities have existed for over a hundred years.
This has been possible only through promotion of the frater-
nity to non—members in the hopes that they will join the
brotherhood. This promotion of the fraternity has become
known as rush.

Until this year, alcohol was served at most rush events.
This guaranteed that all rush events would be well~attended.
The implications of a we|l—attended rush are of great
importance.

As with any sales promotion, a consumer must first be
exposed to a product. The world's greatest mousetrap will not
sell if people do not know it exists. Once the consumer is
exposed to a product, he is expected to thoroughly examine it
before he purchases it. Not everyone who is exposed to a
product is going to give it a passing glance, however.

The same is true of rush. At every rush event, some of the
people who attend are there just to imbibe alcoholic
beverages. These people are not interested in a particular
fraternity. This does not imply that alcoholic beverages should
not be served at these events. Rush is designed to help a
fraternity select those individuals whom it would like to have
join. It also allows these individuals to decide which associa-
tion they want to join. Their interest in a fraternity is instilled
at its parties and propagated by its values and ideals. As in
industry, an advertisement catches the eye, but the product
itself is what makes the consumer reach into his wallet.
Alcohol doesn't sell your fraternity to these individuals, it
merely attracts them.

After these rushees become attracted to a fraternity, it
becomes the brothers’ obligation to allow these men to
thoroughly examine the fraternity, the product. Only after this
occurs can a rushee become a pledge, and then eventually be
initiated as a brother. Any rushee who is not willing to peruse
his chosen fraternity is not only a fool but will never be a good
Creek, an asset to his house. Similarly, any fraternity which
allows this to happen cannot hope to survive.

This year dry rush events were not very well attended for
the most part. When closed rush, which was wet, began all of
the houses attracted greater crowds. At this point, the promo-
tion of the fraternity’s ideals to the rushees began. As a result,
rush went fairly well after all.
