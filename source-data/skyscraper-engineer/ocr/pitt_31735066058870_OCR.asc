an editorial


     For the last two years, the administration of the University of Pittsburgh has
carried on an intensive program of advertisement to have the third trimester ac-
cepted as an integral part of student life. To some extent, the campaign has been
successful, especially in the Schools of Engineering and Mines.
     An article in a recent Pitt News stated that of a total of 829 students registered
for the spring trimester, 504 students were in the Schools of Engineering and
Mines. For the engineering student especially, the three trimester school year
has had some very fine advantages. Chief among these is the speeding up of
training and the earlier graduation possible.
     However, while the third trimester in theory offers many advantages over the
old two semester school year, it has in practice developed several serious faults.
The main fault has been the general curtailment of offered classes in both the
Engineering Schools and the College. What difference does it make if you can
complete a nine trimester course of study in three years if during three of those
nine trimesters some block schedule courses are unavailable and the electives
offered are scanty and presented primarily in those hours that are being used for
engineering courses?
     If engineering courses are offered only in the morning and most electives
also, a choice must be made which to attend. As a result, in some of the smaller
departments, students are finding it difficult if not impossible to graduate in
nine trimesters. If they have attended all year around, they are naturally at least
one trimester ahead of the students who have attended two trimesters per year.
Thus because they have followed the advice and encouragement of the adminis-
tration in attending all year around, they are "out of phase" with their block
and often small in number class-wise. Then these same administrators who
encouraged year-round attendance now say that there are too few students
wanting a particular subject to hold a class . . . If required classes are not avail-
able, especially during an eighth or ninth trimester of a student's study, it may
not be possible to make it up when offered for the regular two-trimester crowd.
When required courses are not completed, the student does not graduate. It
thus becomes very easy to find yourself in the position of having to attend a tenth
trimester in order to graduate.
     When this can happen, the initial and primary reason for starting the tri-
mester plan has been defeated. Besides the loss of wages for the student, there
is also an attendant loss of support for the trimester plan. If the support of
enough students is lost, the trimester plan will fail. This would be a tragedy for
Pitt because basically the trimester plan is far superior to the old two semester
program.
    The success of the trimester plan is so important that its success should not
be jeopardized by short-sightedness on the part of University administrators.
At first, perhaps there will not be enough students in a class for it to be econom-
ically justified, but when the majority of the students begin to realize the true
advantages of the spring trimester, these classes will grow in size. It is not
good policy to apply two-semester rules to third trimester attendance. The
real problem in the third trimester right now is not to save money but to in-
crease attendance.
    If a wider selection of classes could be scheduled with more variety in class
times, the spring trimester would be better received than it is now. To do this
would require an administrative policy change, but it can be done. The stu-
dents at Pitt have not minded giving a little more effort and time to make the
third trimester a success, perhaps the University's Administration can give a
little more on this matter too.

BMEWS














                    BY ROBERT ADDLEMAN



    This year the people directly responsible for the Free
World's defenses can breathe a bit more easily.
    It's not that the danger of Communist agression is
any less real, but rather that the Free World will have
a powerful new tool at its disposal-BMEWS, the Ballis-
tic Missile Early Warning System.
     BMEWS is the long-rang ultra-high-speed       radar
warning system now being built under the direction of the
U.S. Air Force, to give the North American Air Defense
Command, the Strategic Air Command, and the Civil
Defense agencies the brief but vital time necessary to take
defensive and retaliatory measures in the event of an enemy
attack on the North American Continent.
     BMEWS consists of radar bases at Thule, Greenland;
Clear, Alaska; and Gylingdales Moor in Yorkshire, Eng-


    This is the first article written for the SKYSCRAPER
by Bob Addleman. Bob, a second semester freshman in
E. E., was recently appointed Story Editor of the SKY-
SCRAPER ENGINEER. His favorite hobby, photography,
has already resulted withti his work appearing in recent
issues.


land. These sites were selected for BMEWS because they
are so situated as to provide complete detection coverage
of intercontinental ballistic missiles approaching Southern
Canada, the United States or Great Britain, from beyond
the polar regions. The system contains a comprehensive
communication system to flash warning and predicted mis-
sile impact information to NORAD headquarters at Color-
ado Springs for evaluation and action.
    Each of the forward radar sites will be a completely
self-sufficient base, with giant radars, power supply, com-
puters and all necessary facilities to support administra-
tive, operating and maintenance personnel.
     The Radio Corporation of America is under contract
with the Air Force to provide the basic system. Western
Electric has a separate contract for the communications
network which will link the system with the North Ameri-
can Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs.
     The USAF BMEWS Project Office at Hanscom Field,
Bedford, Mass., directs RCA in their management of the
program, and serves as the focal point within the Air Force
for implementing the program, The office contains ele-
ments of the Air Material Command, acting as executive
agent, and the Air Research and Development Command
to achieve proper phasing of actions pertaining to devel-
opment, procurement, production, maintenance, and sup-
ply, thereby insuring timely completion of the BMEWS
program.
     Two types of radar will be used in BMEWS. The
first is the General Elcetric AN/FPS-50. This detection
radar uses fixed antenna which are larger than a football
field turned on its side. Two fan shaped beams are reflect-
ed off the antenna at different elevation levels. The station
at Thule will contain four detection radar sets with a total
azimuth coverage of over 150 degrees while the station at
Clear, Alaska will have three detection radars with cover-
age of over 100 degrees. The second type of radar to be
used at the Fyiingdales station is the RCA Tracking Radar
AN/FPS-49. This radar can both scan and track. It is
tlexible in that it can be assigned to scan over various sec-
tors at different elevation angles. Upon detection of a
target, a designated tracking radar locks on and tracks
the target to determine whether or not it is an ICBM, and,
if so, to obtain accurate data on its trajectory, and thus
predict the launching point and the target. The stations
have been designed for easy growth by the addition of
tracking radars at Thule and Clear and detection radars
at Fylingdales. The radars will all have ranges up to 3000
nautical miles. Detecting a missile at such distances is like
observing a door floating above Los Angeles with a radar
located in New York City.
     The tracking radar, a giant concave reflector which
 weighs 12,000 pounds and turns on 108-inch bearing con-
 taining 75 balls, each 31/2 inches in diameter. The reflector
 will be housed in a 140-foot diameter radome consisting of
 1,646 pentagonal and hexagonal panels of six-inch paper
 honeycomb, faced with thin sheets of reinforced fiberglass.
 The radome will be mounted atop a three story computer
 building.
     Each base will be equipped with pair of solid state

IN ORDER TO PROVIDE COMPLETE PROTECTION three
radar stations were needed. The stations: one at Clear, Alaska;
one at Thule, Greenland; and one at Fylingdales Moor in the
United Kingdom are linked to the Zone-of-the-Interior com-
mand post at Colorado Springs.

computers. Two computers are necessary to permit one to
take over the functions of another during either scheduled
or unscheduled shutdowns, and thus assure continuous
operation. A radar signal is first fed into an electronic
"radar observer", called Detection Radar Data Take-Off
sub-system   (DRDTO), a new       three-dimensional device
which can estimate target azimuth as well as range and
radial velocity. The DRDTO analyzes radar echoes, de-
tects from these the presence of potential missiles, and
then translates the characteristics of these threats into a
form that can be assimilated by a general-purpose com-
puter for further analysis. The general-purpose computer
is called Missile Impact Predictor Set (MIPS). MIPS is
made up of two standard I.B.M. solid-state computer
systems, and special timing devices designed jointly by
Sylvania and I.B.M. The MIPS computer relies upon a
program of thousands of stored instructions operating on
thousands of computer words of stored data. The MIPS
computers accomplish the following functions.
1-Recognize, among      radar sightings reported  by the
DRDTO, those sightings which appear to resemble space
trajectories or orbits.
2-Discriminate, from     among the tracks discerned, the
ones which represent potentially hostile missile trajectories.
3-Project the potentially hostile trajectories to predict
points and times of impact.
4-Keep traffic totals to expedite decision on whether its
reported observations represent a large scale enemy attack.
5-Formulate clearly and within a few thousandths of a
second the traffic totals and points and times of impact
both for operating personal at the site and for transmission
to display facilities at Colorado Springs.

     One of the most important contributions to the
BMEWS system's reliability is the automatic checkout and
monitoring equipment. Vital points in the radar system
are monitored continuously to verify correct operation.
Any part of the system, 6r all of it, can be checked auto-
matically by means of punch cards and targets simulated


on magnetic tape, thus permitting the reliability of the
data to be accepted without question.
      krom the computers the data is sent by several dif.
 ferent communication systems to the Zone-of-the-Interior
 at Colorado Springs. The systems are separated as a
 safety measure. Where possbile the system uses commercial-
 ly available routes. Two routes are always in use between
 the radar stations and the display facilities at Colorado
 Springs. Because the data transmission is so important the
 system must not only be practically infallible but it must
 be able to detect and reject any errors it makes and also
 be able to say when and where it is making them.
     This requires a new system. Sixty three pieces of in-
 formation are accepted from the detection equipment and
 to this the transmitter adds 18 bits of information to
 each message in such a way that, when it is checked by
 the data receiver at Colorado Springs, any error introduc-
 ed during transmission will be detected. This checking
 process is known by the technical name of "triple inter-
 leaved parity."
     The transmitter sends the message simultaneously
over both routes to Colorado Springs, but temporarily
retains it in its memory.
     The signals on the two routes arrive at Colorado
 Springs almost simultaneously. The data receiver looks at
 them both and makes its check for parity. It accepts the
 first one it verifies as correct, subtracts out the extra
 "bits" added by the transmitter, and passes the original
 message to the display equipment. It also sends a signal
 back to the data transmitter saying, "I've got it-send the
 next message." The transmitter at the radar station relaxes,
 clears that message from its memory and sends the next
 one.
     If, on the other hand, the data receiver at Colorado
Springs finds the message received on both routes to be
in error, it throws them out and tells the data transmitter,
"Something wrong-send that one again." The data trans-
mitter instantaneously reaches into its memory and repeats

again on both routes. Elapsed time-practically nothing.
     In the meantime, data monitors located at 1000 mile
intervals along each route are busily checking each trans-
mission as it goes by. They don't get excited as long as
at least 6 accurate messages per second are going by. But
if it's less than this they take action.
     Local alarm bells ring and warning lights flash. An
alarm that is telemetered on one of the through BMEWS
circuits carries the news up and down the line and lights
an amber light behind the designation for the affected
station on the Monitoring Console at Colorado Springs.
If the transmission rate drops below 4 accurate messages
per second, the light turns red. With this warning,
maintenance people can start to fix things before trans-
mission on this route fails completely.
     The console consists of three layouts that are identi-
cal except for station names-one for the route to each
detection site. By pressing a button, the attendant can
switch to alternate facilities on either or both routes.
     The dual communications routes involve teletype,
 voice and data transmission equipment utilizing all modern
 transmission media such as over the horizon tropospheric
 scatter radio, submarine cable and line of sight microwave
 radio.
     At Colorado Springs, the headquarters of NOILAD,
 missile threat information is projected on a large screen.
 Threat summary data indicating detailed raid information
 is also displayed. Site equipment status is shown on a
 small console in the monitoring room. A similar display
 facility is located at Strategic Air Command Combat
 Operation Center in Omaha. On the basis of the informa-
 tion in these displays, the NORAD and SAC commanders
 will decide on the appropriate air defense and retaliatory
 operations. Automatic processing of a missile attack, from
 the moment oft recognition of a mass raid by the computer
 to the display of the threat information at Hq., NORAD,
 requires an average time of about 8 seconds. Data on in-

antennas had to be designed for certain segments of the

is as tall as an 8-story building and is designed to withstand
winds of 200 miles-per-hour.

dividual missiles will be displayed at NORAD within about
3 seconds after missile discrimination. In the event of a
failure of the automatic transmission equipment a manual
backup method is available for receiving data by phone
or teletype and mechanically inserting it into the computer
display equipment. All display equipment may be manual-
ly activated in the event the DIP computer goes out of
operation.
     The   BMEWS system, the largest undertaking in
modern military history, is a tribute to American industry
and research. The system will make the United States the
best prepared country if and when a missile war should
be started*

         MHD-


                          ITS Al
   In recent years considerable interest has developed in
the study of magnetohydrodynamics. This interest has been
spurred primarily by astro-physical problems, and by prob-
lems related to the fusion reactor.
    Magnetohydrodynamics, abbreviated  MHD, is the
branch of physics that encompasses both electromagnetic
and fluid-dynamic phenomena. Essentially, magnetohydro-
dynamics involves the study of the interaction of magnetic
fields with high temperature ionized gases.
    MHD is not a new concept. Patents dealing with the
generation of electric power using methods derived from
MHD theory date back at least 50 years. Because of an
inadequate understanding of the idea involved, i.e. a lack
of knowledge of the performance of gases at high tempera-
ture, various forms of the idea previously visualized did
not prove practical.
    Recent work, however, in the study of missile re-entry
problems has developed a good theoretical understanding
of the electrical conductivity characteristics of gases at high
temperatures. Also, advances in materials technology has
made possible the development of high temperature physics
to the point where it now appears feasible to apply MHD
theory in several areas.

    At the present state of development, magnetohydro-
dynamic theory appears to be applicable to two major
areas-electrical power generation and electrical propul-
sion systems for spacecraft. In both of these areas, applica-
tion of the MHD concept theoretically offers substantial
advantages over current methods.
     Magnetohydrodynamic power generation is a simple
process in comparison with conventional modes of power
generation. In a conventional electric power plant, a tur-
bine drives a solid coil of wire (an armature) through a
magnetic field to produce electricity. In contrast, the MHD
generator substitutes a high temperature ionized gas for the
armature and passes this gas through a magnetic field to
generate electricity. In more detail, the MHD principle
of generating electricity involves heating gases until they
become ionized (3000 to 5000 degrees F). An ionized gas
will conduct electricity. It is possible to increase the con-
ductivity of these ionized gases, however, by "seeding"
them with a small amount of cesium or potassium. When
the ionized gases pass through a magnetic field, electricity
is generated.
     In addition to its simplicity, MHD power generation
offers another advantage-higher overall thermal efficien-
cies. According to Dr. Stewart Way of Westinghouse, the
overall thermal efficiency of a plant utilizing an MHD
generator might be as high as 60 per cent, as compared
wiLli a figure of 40 to 42 per cent for the most modern
conventional power plants. Ayco-Everett Research Labora-
tories, in an analysis of the operating costs of an open cycle,
coal-fired MHD power plant, present the following com-
parison of operating costs: MHD plant-1l.78 mil per Kw
hr. (based on 6200 BTU per Kw hr.), conventional plant---
2.12 mil per Kw hr. (based on 8500 BTU per Kw hr.).


MHD    power generation, therefore, offers two distinct
advantages, greater simplicity and higher operating effici-
encies.
    Several industrial organizations are currently develop-
ing MHD devices for large scale power generation. West-
inghouse, General Electric, and Avco have built MHD
generators which   have produced kilowatts of electric
power for short time periods. Westinghouse and Avco are
conducting studies on devices using a nuclear reactor for a
heat source which will be capable of producing hundreds
of megawatts of electric power.
     The Westinghouse MHD generator, the most advanc-
ed device yet reported, has to date put out about 2.5 KW
at one-fourth maximum power rating for four minuites
continuously. It burns furnace oil and oxygen, with potas-
sium soap dissolved in the oil as a seeding element. Oxy-
gen was used instead of air merely as a convenience to
avoid building a large air preheater.
     However, there are also problems involved in MHD
power generation. All of the MHD generators developed
to date put out direct current. This necessitates the use of
a converter to produce alternating current. The capital
cost of this converter is appreciable, though not prohibi-
tive. Westinghouse is attempting to solve this problem
by developing an MHD generator capable of directly pro-
ducing alternating current.
     Other problems in MHD       generation development
are in the areas of physics, materials and engineering
technology. More laboratory work needs to be done to
obtain reliable data on the conduction of electricity in
gases, and to provide a better understanding of the basic

     sealed in a small, cone-shaped space capsule mounted atop an
Atlas missile. The missile will climb 100 miles in less than six
minutes, where the capsule will disengage and go into orbit. The
man will be alone in space.


  The vehicle for this historic voyage is already in production under

   stand high temperatures, sudden changes, and chemical
   interaction with the alkali-metal seeding materials. Al-
   though these many problems pose a challenge, they ap-
   pear to be solvable.
       Another important application of MHD theory oc-
   curs in the area of spacecraft propulsion. Usually referred
   to as plasma propulsion, the application of MHD theory
   in this area provides one of the more promising engines
   for space travel. In plasma propulsion, propellant ma-
   terial can be accelerated to large velocities by the use of
   electromagnetic forces. The principal attraction of plasma
   propulsion is the long range possibility it offers of pro-
   viding a large ratio of payload weight to initial vehicle
   weight.
       To better understand the advantages of plasma pro-
  pulsion, a comparison of the different types of engines
  available for space travel will be made. These include (1)
  chemical propulsion, (2) nuclear-chemical propulsion (3)
  ion propulsion, and (4) plasma propulsion.
       In chemical propulsion systems both the energy and
  propellant are contained in a fuel-oxidizer mixture. This
  mixture is burned in a combustion chamber to produce
  high temperature gases. The high temperature gases are
  then allowed to expand through a nozzle to convert part
  of their internal heat energy into kinetic energy of the
  exhaust. Although chemical propulsion units have been
  under development for many years and are currently
  being successfully operated, there is a limit to the pro-
  pellant velocity that can be achieved with chemical fuels.
  Even with fuel mixtures which combine the most energetic
  chemical bonds with the lightest weight atoms, it is un-
  likely that propellant exhaust velocities greater than 4
  Km per seconds can be achieved.
       By combining a nuclear heat source with a light
  chemical propellant, it is possible to achieve higher ex-
  haust velocities. The propellant is heated while passing
  through the reactor and is then expanded by expansion
  through a nozzle. Exhaust velocities are limited by the
  temperature to which the propellant can be heated. The
  temperatures are limited because of structural problems
  at high temperature. In a system with hydrogen heated
  to 20000C, a velocity of about 6 Km per second could be
  obtained.
      Ion propulsion offers the simplest means of accelerat-
  ing material by electromagnetic forces. Ions are directly
  accelerated by strong electric fields, similar to the ac-
  celeration of electrons in cathode ray tubes. Although the
  mechanics of acceleration are simple, the ion propulsion
  system suffers from several built in disadvantages. Only
  ions of one sign can be accelerated by an electric field,
  therefore, ions have to be sorted out prior to their ac-
  celeration. However, to maintain overall charge neutrality
  on the vehicle, ions of both signs have to be eliminated.
  Also, to maintain a neutral space environment in the
  vicinity of the ion engine, the positive and negative
  charges should leave the vehicle with about the same
  velocity. Because of the large magnitude of electrostatic
  forces, the ion currents that can be obtained are un-
  fortunately very small. Thus an extremely large exhaust

  means of electromagnetically accelerating materials.

  area is required to get an appreciable thrust. It is there-
  fore expected that the thrust per unit area from an ion
  engine will be small (less than 0.1 lbs. per square foot).
     In plasma propulsion units, a neutral plasma is ac-
 celerated  with the aid of electric and magnetic fields.
 The magnetic fields can be provided by currents in the
 plasma, or they can be provided independently. Propel-
 lant energy is supplied by the electric fields; however,
 the magnetic fields are required to orient the gas and to
 give it a net momentum. Operation of a plasma device
 does not require the separation of the positive and nega-
 tive charges. The plasma device can therefore handle
 larger amounts of propellant and can provide a larger
 thrust per unit area.
     There are two types of plasma propulsion devices-
 The steady-state plasma-accelerator and the pulsed plasma
 accelerator. Steady-state devices may be suitable for the
 acceleration of plasma to intermediate velocities (about
 50 Km per second). Pulsed devices can be utilized to ac-
 celerate plasmas in the velocity range of about 10 to 500
 Km per second, but are better suited for producing velo-
 cities greater than that of the steady-state device. The
 basic principles involved in these devices are the same,
 although the technical problems are quite different.
     The steady-state plasma-accelerator, often  called a
crossed electric and magnetic field accelerator, is similar
to the electromagnetic pump    presently used to pump
metal liquids. In a simple version of the crossed field de-
vice, a plasma arc-jet is used to produce a high tempera-
ture gas. Usually a small percentage (around one per-
cent) of an alkali vapor, such as cesium or potassium, is
added to the gas to increase its electrical conductivity.
The plasma gas then passes between a pair of electrical.
plates which produce a current transverse to the flow,
and a set of coils which provide a magnetic field at right
angles to both the current between the plates and the di-
rection of flow.

    The resultant interaction between the current and
the magnetic field provides the force for accelerating the
gas. In principle an operating steady-state crossed field
device should provide per-unit-area thrusts up to 100 lbs.
per square foot.
     The pulsed-plasma accelerator differs from the steady-
state device in that bursts of plasma are driven by rapidly
varying magnetic fields produced by large currents in the
plasma discharge. There are a number of different elect-
rode arrangements possible. Three arrangements generally
referred to are the collinear, coaxial, and pinch accelera-
tors. In each of these, a plasma introduced into the dis-
charge region or produced by the discharge, is accelerated
by the interaction of the current in the plasma and the
current in the fixed part of the discharge circuit. General-
S ly, the current elements in the parts of the circuit nearest
the plasma contribute the most to the acceleration.
     In the collinear electrode plasma accelerator, the
 principal force arises from the repulsion between the cur-
 rent element in the plasma and the anti-parallel current
 element in the adjacent portion of the circuit. In the
 coaxial electrode system, the acceleration is provided by
 the repulsive interaction between the disk-sheet plasma
 current and the current in the central electrode. For the
 pinch accelerator, the accelerating force arises from the
 attractive self-interaction of the axially symmetric cur-
 rent sheet. Here the radial component of the current in
 the plasma contributes directly to the thrust; the axial
 component contributes indirectly through plasma com-
 pression and heating, much as in chemical propulsion.
   Magnetohydrodynamics theory has been successfully em-
 ployed in the design of power generating equipment and
  space craft propulsion systems. To date, applications have
 been of an experimental nature. However, with the in-
 creased  knowledge    available from   these  experiments,
 development of MHD devices should proceed at a more
 accelerated pace*

Sratt & Whitney Aircraft?


Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.

Back in 1925, when Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born-a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.

That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&WA today.

The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt & Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium-air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.

Specifically, what would you do?-your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.



For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,
Engineering Department, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft,
East Hartford 8, Connecticut.


At P&WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this live mock-up
of a reactor, nuclear scientists and engineers can
determine critical mass, material reactivity coefficients,
control effectiveness and other reactor parameters.


Representative of electronic aids functioning for P&WA
engineers is this on-site data recording center which
can provide automatically recorded and computed
data simultaneously with the testing of an engine. This
equipment is capable of recording 1,200 different
values per second.


Studies of solar energy collection and liquid and vapor
power cycles typify P&WA's research in advanced
space auxiliary power systems. Analytical and Experi-
mental Engineers work together in such programs to
establish and test basic concepts.

   A phenomenon of modern America is the so-called
   "think company.' It owns no factories, manufactures
   no products and makes no shipments, but just "thinks"
   about problems--and brilliant ways to solve them.
     We have a number of "think companies" within Westinghouse.
     One is a group of scientists in the research labs near
   Pittsburgh who seek basic knowledge, like the production
   of light by solids, and the origin of magnetism.
     Other Westinghouse scientists in Baltimore apply basic knowledge
   to that most demanding of all problems... .national defense. At
    Cheswick, Pa., another group thinks about products needed in the
   American home 10 or 15 years from now.
     As a result of this kind of thinking Westinghouse scientists and
   engineers have achieved startling advances in atomic power, the
   launching system for Polaris, thermoelectric generators
4 and many other developments.
     The back-up facilities in the Westinghouse "think companies"
   help make Westinghouse the best place for talented engineers.
   For information on rewarding career opportunities write

Is your future up in the air?


As the communications needs of our nation become steadily
greater and more complex, the Bell Telephone System is
continuing its pioneer work in microwave by "taking to the
air" more and more to get the word across.
   To this end, Western Electric - the manufacturing arm
of the Bell System - has the monumental task of producing
a large part of the microwave transmission equipment that
knits our country together by shrinking thousands of miles
into mere seconds.
   In spite of its great technological strides, the science of
radio relay is a rapidly-changing one. And new break-
throughs and advances are common occurrences. A case in
point: our Bell System "TH" Microwave Radio Relay. This
newest development in long-distance telephone transmis-
sion will eventually triple the present message-carrying
capacity of existing long-haul radio relay installations. A
full-scale system of 6 working and 2 protection channels can
handle 11,000 telephone messages at the same time.
   To make microwave work takes a host of special equip-
ment and components: relay towers, antennae, waveguides,
traveling wavetubes, transistors, etc. But just as important,


it takes top-caliber people to help us broaden our horizons
into such exciting new areas as communication by satellites!
   And microwave is only part of Western Electric's oppor-
tunity story. We have-right now-hundreds of challenging
and rewarding positions in virtually all areas of telephony,
as well as in development and building of defense communi-
cations and missile guidance systems for the Government.
   So, if your future is "up in the air," you owe it to your
career to see "what's up" for you at Western Electric.
  Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil and
chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and
business majors. For more information, get your copy of "Western
Electric and Your Career" from your Placement Officer. Or write
College Relations, Room 6105, Western Electric Company, 195 Broad-

Harley A. Cloud (BSEE, Penn State '58) is a group leader
in the development of simulation testing equipment for a
new solid state airborne computer which IBM is building
for the Air Force.






















TRIPS THROUGH THE STRATOSPHERE
WITHOUT LEAVING THE GROUND

A computer will be the heart of the navigation and control
systems for future aircraft designed to operate in the
stratosphere.

Such a computer is now being built by IBM for an advanced
aircraft under development for the Air Force. Harley Cloud,
an IBM engineer, is developing simulation equipment which
will put the computer through its paces. His equipment
will simulate the systems functions encountered by the
250-ton aircraft at Mach 3, fourteen miles up, with poten-
tial adversaries in wait.

Without the airplane leaving the ground, his testing equip-
ment will simulate such inputs to the computer as accelera-
tion in the inertial system, velocity in the doppler radar, and
air pressure in the air data subsystem. These simulation
techniques will help protect lead time for the entire project.

Responsibilities Are Large. As a group leader, he is direct.
ing the design, laboratory breadboarding, electrical draft-
ing, testing and evaluation of this ingenious equipment.
It's a very responsible job for a man out of school less
than three years.

But age is no barrier to advancement in IBM. In the fast.
moving world of data systems, it is ideas and the ability
to do the job that count. And fresh new ideas and abilities
are always welcomed at IBM-whether in development, re-
search, manufacturing, or programming.

If you feel you might be interested in one of these fields
associated with data systems at IBM, you might discuss
it with the IBM representative. Your placement office can
  make an appointment. Or you may write, outlining your
  background and interests, to:
  Manager, Technical Employment
  IBM Corporation, Dept. 893

  New York 22, N. Yb
  You naturally have a better chance to grow with a growth company.












OUTSTANDING SENIORS


   Each spring trimester the Schools of Engineering and
 Mines select nine men, one from each department, who
 best exemplify the characteristics of leadership, scholar-
 ship, character and service which make them     men of
 distinction among engineers at Pitt. One of these men is
 chosen as the Outstanding Senior of the Schools of En-
 gineering and Mines. The others are considered Outstand-
 ing Seniors in their respective departments.
   This year's Outstanding Senior is Stanley A. Becker,
an Aeronautical Engineer. In his four years at the Uni-
versity, Stan has compiled a record in the areas of leader-
ship, scholarship, character, and service to the School of
Engineering and Mines that has merited him this high

HOW ENGINEERS MAKE NEW DESIGNS POSSIBLE AND PRACTICAL

Inco Nickel helps give engineers the solution

    to metal problems in new radio telescope


How do you design a precision instru-
ment that will "see" 38 billion light
years into space? This problem was
answered by the engineers working
on this revolutionary, new radio
telescope.
  But these engineers faced another
challenging problem-How do you
actually build it? How do you build
a telescope as tall as a 66-story build-
ing with a reflector so big it could
hold six football fields?
  How do you build a rotating mecha-
nism that can swing this giant up or
down, or sideways, to aim at any spot
in the Universe with pin-point accu-
racy? Just the tiniest amount of wear
or distortion in this mechanism could
throw the telescope millions of miles
off target in the far reaches of space!
  Where could they get construction


probably you, yourself, in the near
future, will be faced with problems
just as difficult. When you are, you can
count on Nickel-and the cooperation
of Inco - to help get the job done . .
and done right!

materials tough and strong enough?
Nickel gave them the answer! Nickel
in steel gave these engineers a mate-
rial tough enough to maintain pre-
cision in the rotating mechanism even
under the anticipated 20,000-ton load.
And Nickel, to be used in the steel
members, gave them the high strength
at minimum weight needed to sup-
port the giant reflector.
  The radio telescope is one of the
many developments in which Nickel
has solved important problems. Most

tensive research is being done on super-conductivity, the
reduction  of electrical resistance to zero in ultra-cold
materials. These are but a few of the many uses for
cryogenic steels today, and the need for these ultra-cold
structural materials will be much greater in the future.
     Metals intended for low temperature application must
exhibit certain desirable characteristics, the main one be-
ing toughness, the ability to deform plastically under con-
ditions of high stress concentration. A metal with a high
degree of toughness will both resist initiation of a crack at
points of high stress concentration and resist the propaga-
tion of any cracks that may be present. Under normal
conditions constructional metals will not fail without giv-
ing warning by stretching, sagging, bulging or otherwise
indicating failure plastically. But at sub-zero temperatures,
metals which are otherwise very ductile may suddenly
fail at very low levels of stress without giving any warning
by prior plastic deformation. This sudden brittle fracture
at low temperatures may result in catastrophic destruc-
tion.
     The toughness and ductility of nearly all carbon and
alloy steels decreases greatly at cryogenic temperatures.
This tendency to brittleness is further increased by any
notch effects which concentrate stress and impair toughness.
Such notch effects include nicks, scratches, weld inclusions
and geometric design interruptions. A high degree of
straining induced during cold working will also lower a
metal's ductility.
     To achieve this desired toughness and ductility, cer-
 tain metallurgical controls are necessary. Decreasing the
 carbon content of the steel raises the transition tempera-
 ture (the temperature at which the behavior changes fIom
 ductile to brittle.) Increasing the nickel content lowers the
 traisition temperature. Cryogenic steels are made by the
 open hearth or electric furnace methods depending on the
 composition limits specified. The toughness of the steel
 may be improved by fully-killing the steel through deoxi-
 dation with silicon and aluminum.

A 4340-POUND "HEADACHE         BALL," with a kinetic en-
,rgy exceeding 82,000 foot-pounds, crashes against the side of
zhe rectangular vessel filled with liquid nitrogen at -320 F.

    A number of different steels that have these desired
charactistics for low temperature application have been
produced in recent years. However, most of them require
special heat treatment during their production, and stress
relieving of the finished product after fabrication and weld-
ing. These processes are not only expensive, but the nec-
essary stress relieving limits the size of the finished vessel.
     One of the leaders in the development of cryogenic
steel was the International Nickel Company, Inc. In 1944,
Inco's research laboratory began to develop a nickel steel
that would meet all of the characteristics needed for low
temperature application. They developed a 9 percent nickel
steel that would resist brittle fracture at temperatures as
low as -320 degrees F. The International Nickel Company,
Inc. then joined in a cooperative research program with
the United States Steel Corporation and the Chicago Bridge
& Iron Company to further test their newly developed
cryogenic steel.
     Steel for the tests was produced from a single heat
melted at the Duquesne Works of United States Steel. The
plates were hot-rolled and heat-treated on the continuous
heat-treating line at the Homestead District Works. The
welding and fabrication was completed at the Chicago
plant of Chicago Bridge & Iron Company.
     A total of nine vessels were built and tested. Three
were rectangular vessels of a type which might be used in
shipboard transportation of liquefied gases. They were 8
feet square by 6 2 feet high, and made of 3'/ inch steel
plate. Six were cylindrical vessels with hemispherical heads,
simulating land-based storage tanks. The cylindrical por-
tion of the shell of these vessels, made of 8 inch plate, was
4 feet in diameter and 9 feet long, the over-all length of
the vessel being 13 feet. Each vessel was provided with a
built-in manhole, 16 inches in diameter, which was also
made of -8 inch plate. The vessels were fabricated by
manual metal-arc welding using Inco Weld "A" electrodes.
Four of these vessels were double normalized and temper-
ed, while five were quenched and tempered. The normaliz-
ing temperatures were 1650 degrees F, followed by 1450
degrees F., in accordance with    ASTM    specifications.
Tempering was carried out at a temperature of 1100 de-
grees F. For the quenching and tempering treatment, the


MARCH 1961




metal was heated to 1475 degrees F. and water quenched.
The tempering treatment, again, was 1100 degrees F.
Similar treatments were used for the forging for the vessel
fittings which were produced by Taylor Forge. In addi-
tion, six of the vessels were tested as welded, without any
heat treatment whatsoever after fabrication, while three
were stress-relieved after welding.
      A series of priliminary tests were run on seven of
 these vessels, and as a grand finale, a two-day testing pro-
 gramn called "Operation Cryogenics" was presented at
 United States Steel's Fairless Works on October 25 and
 26, 1960. Over 300 special guests from the United States
 and abroad were invited to observe the tests. These guests
 included renowned cryogenic engineers and scientists, gov-
 crnment and military officials, industrial leaders, members
 of various materials-specification   and  code-regularatory
 groups, metal fabricators and representatives of liquefied
 gas producing and shipping companies.
      On the first day of "Operation Cryogenics", a rectang-
 ular vessel, refrigerated and full of liquid nitrogen at -320
 degrees F., was subjected to a series of impact destruction
 tests both with, and without, internal pressure. A 434.0
 pound "headache ball" was lifted to varying heights and
 repeatedly swung against the side of this rectangular 9
 per cent nickel steel vessel. The kinetic energy of the heavi-
 est blows exceeded 82,000 foot pounds. Only after a series
 of crushing impact blows from the 4340 pound wrecking
 ball, did the vessel rupture. The rupture was a short duc-
 tile crack in a corner of the vessel resulting from bending
 stresses and considerable permanent deformation of the
 shell plate and stiffeners. The purpose of this test was to
 demonstrate that 9 per cent nickel steel is capable of with-
 standing shock and can undergo extensive plastic deforma-
 tion at -320 degrees F under combined internal and external
 pressure. The impact of 82,000 foot-pounds that this vessel
 withstood before fracturing is far beyond any impact that
 may be expected to occur in actual service.
     On the second day of the test, a nonstress-relieved

UNDER A VERY HIGH         INTERNAL PRESSURE OF 2160
psi, six times the designed stress, the vessel finally rips open
but does not shatter. The fragments in the air are pieces of the
insulating material, not the vessel.


  THE DUCTILE TEAR of this vessel shows the toughness
  of quenched and tempered 9% nickel steel at cryogenic temp-
  eratures.

  cylindrical vessel of quenched and tempered material was
  subjected to a internal pressure destruction test. The ves-
  sel, entirely insulated to limit the amount of heat absorbed,
  was refrigerated to -320 degrees F. and pressurized with
  liquid nitrogen by means of high pressure pumps until
  failure by bursting occurred. At the instant of failure, the
  metal was stressed to 130,000 pounds per square inch,
  which is approximately six times the design stress. The
  metal did not explode into fragments, but fractured in a
  single dutcile tear. The purpose of this test was to demon-
  strate the strength and toughness of 9 per cent nickel steel
  under biaxial stresses at very low temperatures. It revealed
  the ability of the metal to resist crack propagation under
  conditions of extremely high stored energy.
     The over-all objective of "Operation Cryogenic" was
 to demonstrate to the code regulatory bodies and to in-
 dustrial designers and users the suitability of 9 per cent
 nickel steel, quenched and tempered or doubled normaliz-
 ed and tempered, in the as-welded condition (not stress
 relieved)'for very low temperature use. Many engineers
 believe that a re-analysis of the concept of stress relieving
 is needed, and that the codes developed through previous
 experience may be unnecessary or even undesirable for
 the new types of steel. These tests proved conclusively the
 ductile behavior of 9 per cent nickel steel in the as-welded
 condition during enforced failure at low temperatures, and
 should be instrumental in a re-evaluation of the effects
 of stress relieving in pressure-vessel construction. Due to
 the excellent properties exhibited by the quenched and
 tempered vessels, these tests also showed that this less costly
 heat treating process is sufficient for low temperature appli-
 cations of 9 per cent nickel steel. This combination of
 economy and low temperature ductility may well be the
 answer to the ever growing need for an economical, re-
 liable cryogenic steel.
     "Operation Cryogenics", however, was much more
than a demonstration of a newly developed ultra-cold steel.
It was the beginning of an era of development of better
cryogenic steels and a demonstration of industry's deter-
mination to provide new and better steels to fulfill the
needs of the future*

SHIP FENDER
Looking like a big licorice stick as it moves from special
extrusion equipment at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company,
this huge piece of rubber is the world's largest dock fender.
Three inches thicker than any previous dock fender, the 24-inch
cushion will be used in the harbor at Corpus Christi, Texas.
The fender, with walls six inches thick and weighing 175
pounds per foot, will absorb up to 52,000 foot-pounds of kinetic
energy per foot of length.


UNUSUAL LAMP
A developmental alkali metallic vapor lamp is being studied
by General Electric lamp scientists. This high pressure cesium
metal vapor lamp was made possible through the use of
Lucalox, a synthetic ceramic. Experiments with this lamp are
making feasible investigation of high-pressure light sources,
development of vapor lamps that will operate in the air with
no envelope and production of excellent color quality due to
good energy distribution throughout the light spectrum.


COMPACT CALCULATOR
The Type 2 Curta caluclator is a new lightweight calculating
machine that has been introduced by the Curta Company for
people who require a precise "on-the-spot" answer for every
type of mathematical operation. Combining the accuracy and
speed of a desk calculator with the portability of a pocket
slide rule, the new calculator has a capacity of 11 digits on
the keyboard, 8 digits on the indicator dial and 15 digits in
the answer dial.

UNIQUE PUMP
A pump that operates with a squeeze action on a flexible tube
is manufacutred by the Randolph Company of Texas. The
unusual design allows handling of corrosives, abrasives, slur-
ries, sterile solutions, or gases, with the material always re-
maining within the tube where it is safe from outside con-
tamination. With this design, it is possible to put the pump
into service without breaking existing tubing connections.


RELIABLE MINIATURE
A  new all-glass enclosure for micro-transistors assures high
reliability because of its simplicity. Hermetic seals between
case and cover are obtained with ease by device manufacturers
using a glaze with a low melting point already applied to the
rim of the case. The new package is 60 mils high and 150 mils
in diameter.


GLASS SHOCK TUBE
A section of glass piping, manufactured by the Corning Glass
Works is in use as industry's most powerful shock tube. Built
by Boeing Scientific Research Laboratories, the tube creates
shock waves which begin at 300 times the speed of sound and
then collide in the tube at a "siowed" rate of 80 times the
speed of sound. The tube is being used in the development of
effective ion and plasma propulsion systems for use in space.

An ancient Chinese ...

      ... a 17th century prodigy. .

              ... and a young mining engineer...



...they collaborated across the centuries

                                       to make life better today


                           In ancient China they "piped" water through hollow bamboo
                           sections, but they couldn't shut it off. One day a workman
                           with an engineering mind bored a hole in a plug and fitted
                           it into holes in the pipe. This was the first plug valve.
                             Centuries later, the brilliant young mathematician and
                           scientist, Blaise Pascal, worked out the principle of hydraulics
                           for which he is famous: "A unit pressure applied to a liquid
                           contained in a sealed vessel is transmitted to every part of the
                           liquid with undiminished force."
                             In 1914, Sven Nordstrom, a young mining engineer, had
                           trouble with sticking, leaking valves on the acid lines at a
                           silver mine. By combining the plug cock idea of the ancient
                           Chinese with Pascal's principle of hydraulics, he created a
                           new idea in flow control: the lubricated plug valve.
                             Today, the Rockwell-Nordstrom lubricated plug valve is
                           widely used in the petroleum and natural gas industries, in
                           chemical processing, and in general manufacturing. Its effi-
                           ciency helps cut the cost of many of the things you use every
                           day. And thanks to hundreds of engineering advances, the
                           original lubricated plug valve is still the most modern.
                             Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
                           lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
                           that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
                           engineering has helped make this a company that people like
                           to work for, buy from, and invest in.

OUT OF THE LABORATORY


Forthcoming space exploration
will require exotic fuels and new concepts in
energy conversion to keep men alive and equip-
ment operating for long periods of time beyond
the earth's atmosphere. Advanced hydrogen sys-
tems recently developed by The Garrett Corpora-
tion have solved this problem of providing the
electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic power, plus
cooling and heating required aboard a satellite or
space capsule during launching, outer space flight
and re-entry.
  Besides such spacecraft and missile systems,
other product areas in which Garrett engineers
work include small gas turbine engines, flight
data systems for air and underwater use, nuclear
and solar power systems, cryogenic systems and


THE


contr6ls, and air conditioning and pressurization
systems for conventional aircraft and advanced
flight vehicles.
  Such diversity of interest not only makes work
more interesting at Garrett, but gives the engineer
an opportunity to increase his knowledge and
chances for responsibility and advancement.
  An orientation program lasting a period of
months is also available for the newly graduated
engineer, working on assignments with experi-
enced engineers in laboratory, preliminary design
and development projects. In this way his most
profitable area of interest can be found.

       FINAGLE'S

       LAWS




    .or why nothing in

      Research and Development

      happens the way it should


   Ever since the first scientific experiment, men have
 been plagued by the unceasing antagonism of Nature.
 Only his patience, adaptability and forbearance have
 permitted the scientist to learn a few minor facts about
 the operation of the universe.
   We still do not really know why this should be so.
 It's only natural that Nature should be logical and
 neat-but it isn't, and the best teacher of all, Experi-
 ence, turns out to be just the gradual acceptance of
 Nature's pigheadedness.
   Over the years a series of laws have evolved. The
 laws actually represent a distillation of experience of
 thousands of experimenters, but (until Dr. Finagle
 came along) they were never recorded for the study
 and edification of younger members of our profession
 because they had no derivation-no proof. They are
 true because they have always been true. Look into
 your own experience and see if this is not so.
   We are grateful to John W. Campbell, editor of
 Astounding Science Fiction, for bringing this work to
 our attention, and to the many readers of that maga-
 zine who collected and contributed samples so that
 others might share in their experience.
                 ON EXPERIMENTS
   The first four laws are the only ones dignified by
 number. Note the beauty and simplicity of the First
 Law. Also note that the remaining three laws refer to
 men's reactions to Nature-not to Nature itself.
 First Law: If anything can go wrong with an experi-
     ment, it will.
 Second Law: No matter what result is anticipated, there
     is always some one willing to fake it.
Third Law: No matter what the result, there is always
     someone eager to misinterpret it.
Fourth Law: No matter what occurs, there is always
     someone who believes it happened according to
     his pet theory.
The Law 'of the Too Solid Goof:
     In any collection of data, the figure that is most
     obviously correct-beyond all need of checking-
     is the mistake.
     Corollary I-No one whom you ask for help will
         see it, either.
    Corollary Il-Everyone who stops by with unsought
         advice will see it immediately.
  A further series of rules-or really advice to experi-
menters-has been formulated. They are a natural con-
sequence of the first four laws reduced to day-to-day
practice.
Experiments must be reproducible-they should all fail
in the same way.


     First draw your curves-then plot the readings.
 Experience is directly proportional to equipment
 ruined.
     A record of data is useful-it indicates you've been
     working.
 To study a subject best, understand it thoroughly be-
 fore you start.
     In case of doubt, make it sound convincing.
 Do not believe in miracles-rely on them.
     Always leave room to add an explanation when it
     doesn't work. (This open door policy is also
     known as the Rule of the Way Out.)


                  HUMAN FOIBLES
    The remaining rules outline the human problems
 that follow from the above. To some extent they repre-
 sent man's reaction to Nature and, even more aptly,
 man's reaction to man.
 Laws of Revision (Often lumped into the Now They
     Tell Us! Law)
 First Law: Information necessitating a change of design
     will be conveyed to the designer after-and only
     after-the plans are complete.
     Corollary I-In simple cases, where one obvious
         right way is opposed to one obvious wrong
         way, it is often wiser to choose the wrong way
         right off. This is one step ahead of choosing
         the right way, which turns out to be a wrong
         way, which has to become a right way.
 Second Law: The more innocuous the revision appears
     to be at first, the further its influence will extend
     and more plans will have to be redrawn.
 Third Law: If, when the completion of a design is im-
     minent, field dimensions are finally supplied as
     they actually are-instead of as they were meant to
     be-it is always simpler to start all over.
 Fourth Law: Even if it is impossible to assemble a part
     incorrectly, still a way will be found to do it
     wrong.
     Corollary I-It is usually impractical to worry be-
         forehand about interferences-if you have
         none, someone will make one for you.
The Law of the Lost Inch:
     In designing any type of construction, no over-all
     dimension can be totaled correctly after 4 p.m.
     Friday.
     Corollary I-Under the same conditions, if any
         minor dimensions are given to 1/16 of an
         inch, they cannot be totaled at all.
     Corollary II-The correct total will be self-evident
         at 9:01 Monday morning.
  Deliveries that normally take one day will take five
when you are waiting.
  When adjusting (or drawing or computing, etc.) re-
member that the eye of the chief inspector (engineer,
draftsman, etc.) is more accurate than the finest instru-
ment.
  After adding two weeks to a schedule for unexpected
delays, add two more weeks for the unexpected unex-
pected delays.
  In any problem, if you find yourself doing an unend-
ing amount of work, the answer may be obtained by
inspection.
Finagle's Creed:
  Science is Truth-don't be misled by facts.
Finagle's Motto:
  Smile-tomorrow it will be worse.

              THE FINAGLE FACTOR
  A mathematical notation of Finagle's work has also
been developed. Here, however, there seems to be some
confusion, because two other names enter the picture:.
"fudge" and "diddle" factors are also used to consider-
able advantage by scientists and engineers.
  Years ago-when the universe was relatively easy to
understand-the Finagle factor consisted of a simple
additive constant (sometimes known as a variable con-
stant) in the form:
                    x'-- K+ x
where any measured variable, x, could be made to
agree with theory, x', by simple addition of the Finagle
factor, Kf.
  Later difficulties couldn't be solved so easily and so a
fudge factor, Kb, was added.
                   x'= K, +Kbx.
  Powerful as this adjustment was, World War II
studies in servo theory indicated a need for a still
stronger influence. The diddle factor, Kd, was born and
made to multiply the quadratic term.
               x' = Kf + Kbx + ,X2.
  It is felt that, at least at present, reality can be made
to conform to mathematical theory with reasonable
agreement on the basis of these three factors.


  However, John W. Campbell feels there is a different
basic structure behind the Finagle, fudge and diddle
factors. The Finagle factor, he claims, is characterized
by changing the universe to fit an equation. The fudge
factor, on the other hand, changes the equation to fit
the universe. And finally, the diddle factor changes
things so that the equation and the universe appear to
fit, without making any real change in either.
  For example, the planet Uranus was introduced to
the universe when Newtonian laws couldn't be made to
match known planetary motions. This is a beautiful
example of the application of the Finagle factor.
  Einstein's work leading to relativity was strongly in-
fluenced by the observed facts about the orbit of Mer-
cury. Obviously a fudge factor was introduced.
  The photographer's use of a "soft-focus" lens when
taking portraits of women over 35 is an example of the
diddle factor. By blurring the results photographs are
made to appear to match the facts in a far more sktis-
factory manner.
  To our knowledge, this is the first clear enunciation
of the scientific method. All our vast sum of human
knowledge has been derived with these as the basic
tools. By having them in writing for the first time, per-
haps our children can build even better futures than
the best we envision today .

  Two patients in a hospital were
exceedingly  bored. They  found  a
stack of diagnosis cards in a corner
and began a game of poker. One
shuffled the cards and dealt. They
picked up their hands and lobked at
the cards. One bet, the other raised,
and they raised and raised again un-
til finally one of them called:
  "Looks like I win. I've got three
pneumonias and two gallstones."
   "Not so fast. Not so fast. I've got
four enemas."
   "Well, I guess you take the pot."


  Overheard in a parked car near
the campus:
  "Slow down, Columbus, you've dis-
covered enough for tonight."


  Overheard in EE lab: "Take hold
of that wire.
  "This one? Okay?"
  "Feel anything?"
  "Nope."
  "Then don't touch the other one.
It's carrying 5000 volts."


   "Oh, here's the place Mother told
me to stay away from - I thought
we'd never find it."

   A gangster rushed into a saloon
shooting right and left and yelling,
"All you dirty skunks get outta here."
   The customers fled in a hail of bul-

at the bar calmly finishing his drink.
   "Well," snapped the gangster, wav-
ing his smoking gun.
   "Well," remarked the Scot. "There
 certainly were a lot of them weren't
 there ?"

  The girl was through with her bath

to weigh herself. Her husband hap-
pened to return home at this time and
entered through the back door. Seeing
whatf his wife was doing as he passed

"Well, dear, how many pounds to-
day?"
  Without turning her head, she re-
plied, "I'll take 50 pounds today and
don't you dare pinch me with those

   Once upon a time a beautiful girl
 was walking through the woods when
 she came upon a poor little frog who
 spoke as follows: "Lovely princess,
 once upon a time I was a handsome
 prince but a big black witch turned
 me into a frog."
   "Oh, that's terrible," said the beau-
 tiful girl. "Is there anything I can do
 to help you?"
   "Yes, indeed," replied the frog. "If
you will take me home with you and
put me on your pillow, I will be saved."
  So the beautiful girl took the poor
little frog home with her, and the
next morning when she awoke there
beside her was a handsome young
prince. And, do you know, to this day
her mother still doesn't believe that
story.

  Wife: "Just look at me! My clothes
are so shabby that if anyone came to
the door they'd think I was the cook."
  Husband: "Not if they stayed for
dinner."


  A lovely coed named Loretta
  Loved wearing a very tight sweater;
    Three reasons she had:
    Keeping warm wasn't bad,
  But the other two reasons were better.

    Sleeping the sleep of the just in his
  upper berth, the gentleman was awak-
  ened by a persistent tapping from be-
  low.
    "Oh, Mr. Forsythe, are you awake?"
    "I am now," he said groggily.
    "It's frightfully cold dbwn here, Mr.
  Forsythe. I wonder if you would mind
  getting me a blanket."
    "I've a better idea, lady," he said
  "Let's pretend we are married."
    Giggly, she said, "That sounds like
  a lovely idea."
    "Good," said he, rolling over, "Now
  go get your own damn blanket."
              * * *
   He: "I can't see what keeps girls
 from freezing."
   She: "You're not supposed to."

   Famous last words: "Hell, he won't

   "Will you be free tonight?" he
 asked.
   "No, but I'll be reasonable, she
 said.

   A foursome was playing golf when
 suddenly a pretty girl with no clothes
 on ran across the fairway with four
 men in hot pursuit. The last of the

 golfers noticed he carried a pail of

   "What goes on here?" asked the
 foursome.
   The caddie said, "Oh, she is an in-

out almost every day. Those men
chasing her are the attendandts. They
have to catch her and put her back."
  "But what about the fourth man,"
they asked. "How come he carries two

-you'll find Photography at Work with you


Solving the problems of a human
being living in outer space has
become the task of scores of engi-
neers, chemists and botanists. And
serving them as a valuable working
tool is photography. It records the
growth of experimental plants and
fungi that can well become the
space voyager's food supply. Through
autoradiography it can show the
absorption of cosmic radioactive
material, trace its circulation within
the organism.
  There's hardly a field on which


you can set your sights where pho-
tography does not play a part in
advancing work and simplifying
routine. It saves time and expense
in research, on the production line,
in the engineering and sales depart-
ments, and in the office.
   So in whatever you plan to do,
take full advantage of all the ways
photography can help.

CAREERS WITH KODAK:
With photography and photographic
processes becoming increasingly


important in the business and indus-
try of tomorrow, there are new and
challenging opportunities at Kodak
in research, engineering, electronics,
design, sales, and production.

Interview with

General Electric's Byron A. Case

Manager-Employee Compensation Service


Your Salary


at General Electric


Several surveys indicate that salary is
not the primary contributor to job
satisfaction. Nevertheless, salary con-
siderations will certainly play a big
part in your evaluation of career op-
portunities. Perhaps an insight into the
salary policies of a large employer of
engineers like General Electric will
help you focus your personal salary
objectives.
   Salary-a most individual and per-
sonal aspect of your job-is difficult to
discuss in general terms. While recog-
nizing this, Mr. Case has tried answering
as directly as possible some of your
questions concerning salary:
Q Mr. Case, what starting salary does
your company pay graduate engineers?
A Well, you know as well as I that
graduates' starting salaries are greatly
influenced by the current demand for
engineering talent. This demand es-
tablishes a range of "going rates" for
engineering graduates which is no doubt
widely known on your campus. Be-
cause General Electric seeks outstand-
ing men, G-E starting salaries for these
candidates lie in the upper part of the
range of "going rates." And within
General Electric's range of starting sal-
aries, each  candidate's ability and
potential are carefully evaluated to de-
termine his individual starting salary.
Q How do you go about evaluating
my ability and potential value to your
company?
A We evaluate each individual in the
light of information available to us:
type of degree; demonstrated scholar-
ship; extra-curricular contributions; work
experience; and personal qualities as
appraised by interviewers and faculty
members. These considerations deter-
mine where within G.E.'s current sal-
ary range the engineer's starting salary
will be established.


Q   When could I expect my first salary
increase from General Electric and how
much would it be?
A Whether a man is recruited for a
specific job or for one of the principal
training programs for engineers-the
Engineering and Science Program, the
Manufacturing Training Program, or
the Technical Marketing Program-his
individual performance and salary are
reviewed at least once a year.
  For engineers one year out of col-
lege, our recent experience indicates a
first-year salary increase between 6 and
15 percent. This percentage spread re-
flects the individual's job performance
and his demonstrated capacity to do
more difficult work. So you see, salary
adjustments reflect individual perform-
ance even at the earliest stages of
professional development. And    this
emphasis   on  performance  increases
as experience and general competence
increase.
Q How much can I expect to be making
after five years with General Electric?
A As I just mentioned, ability has a
sharply increasing influence on your
salary, so you have a great deal of per-
sonal control over the answer to your
question.
   It may be helpful to look at the cur-
rent salaries of all General Electric
technical-college graduates who   re-
ceived their bachelor's degrees in 1954
(and now have over 5 years experience).
Their current median salary, reflect-
ing both merit and economic changes,
is about 70 percent above the 1954
median starting rate. Current salaries
for outstanding engineers from   this


class are more than double the 1954
median starting rates and, in some
cases, are three or four times as great.
Q    What kinds of benefit programs
does your company offer, Mr. Case?
A Since I must be brief, I shall merely
outline the many General Electric em-
ployee benefit programs. These include
a liberal pension plan, insurance plans,
an emergency aid plan, employee dis-
counts, and educational assistance pro-
grams.
   The General Electric Insurance Plan
 has been widely hailed as a "pace
 setter" in American industry. In addi-
 tion to helping employees and their
 families meet ordinary medical expen-
 ses, the Plan also affords protection
 against the expenses of "catastrophic"
 accidents and illnesses which can wipe
 out personal savings and put a family
 deeply in debt. Additional coverages in-
 clude life insurance, accidental death
 insurance, and maternity benefits.
   Our newest plan is the Savings and
Security Program which permits em-
ployees to invest up to six percent of
their earnings in U.S. Savings Bonds
or in combinations of Bonds and Gen-
eral Electric stock. These savings are
supplemented by a Company Propor-
tionate Payment equal to 50 percent
of the employee's investment, subject
to a prescribed holding period.

A Message

From the Dean


By Dr. G. R. Fitterer








   "If the scientists have the future in their bones, then
the traditional culture responds by wishing that the future
did not exist."
                              Sir Charles P. Snow



 Mankind is now entering its third major social revolu-
 tion, from which, as in the other two, there will be no
 escape. It is most important that this be recognized as
 a major revolution and it must be directed so as to bene-
 fit mankind.
 The first revolution involved the transition of man from
 being a nomad to a civilized being who lived in com-
 munities. It was really an agriculture revolution in which
 man remained in a given area to till the soil in that area
 year after year instead of wandering about with the
 seasons.
 The industrial revolution brought machine tools and
 labor-saving devices and, although we have not yet seen
 the end of this transition, we are already entering the
 third major change in man's history. Just as in the case
 of the industrial revolution, engineers will be largely
 responsible for the successful development of the third
 revolution.
 The new trend will take place at a breath-taking speed
 and will be called the "Scientific Revolution." Traditional
 social cultures are already deploring the trends, and auto-
mation, which is only one of the many aspects of the
revolution, is already being named as the major cause


of unemployment and has become the subject of many
labor-management disputes.
   Whereas automation will undoubtedly create some new
jobs, it will eliminate far more that it will create. How-
ever, the other aspects of the Scientific Revolution will
create many new occupations which are not in existence
today.
   One of the best examples of the effects of automation
is to be found in the change to dial telephones. It has
been said that if the dial system had not been invented,
that the services of every woman in the United States
would be needed to operate the telephones currently in
use. Obviously, the large number of telephones in service
have increased the number of persons in manufacturing,
servicing, and the operation of business offices.
   The third revolution involves the use of various types
of electronic equipment, including computers, and those
companies which will not employ such equipment in their
regular operations in the future will rapidly fall behind
others who do.
  Meanwhile, the scientists and engineers will continue
to discover and make use of many new devices and nothing
can reverse this trend. The time between the initial dis-
covery and its application has been reduced from a mat-
ter of years to months.
  Engineers must be trained to meet the challenge of
these changes and be trained for the developments of
the next ten years; all of which may occur tomorrow.
