What’s in

Engineers’ Week

by Dave Mahofski

In preparation for writing the following article, the author
conducted a series of interviews in order to get a feel for the
thoughts of Engineers’ Week participants. All the inter-
views are directly involved in Engineers’ Week, either on a
departmental level, or at a broader organizational level.
The author wishes to extend his sincerest appreciation to
all those interviewed for expressing their opinions.

Engineers’ Week is a time when students can put aside
their books and experience a different aspect of their col-
lege career. Throughout the week, the different depart-
ments compete in various activities including the Blood
Drive, Game Night, Gimmick, and Soapbox Derby, as well
as Parade. All throughout the competition, one might
assume that the main goal of each department is to win the
Shamrock Award. (The Shamrock Award is given to the
department with the best performance in the Engineers’
Week competitions.) Some people may be surprised to learn
that a different perspective of the competition is taken by
those directly involved with it. It seems that having fun
and the development of friendships are the most precious
qualities that one can gain through Engineers’ Week. Eve-
ryone would love to win, but just being involved in the
events is where the real enjoyment originates.

Throughout the months of February and March, many
students ponder the question, ”Should I involve myself
with Engineers’ Week?” Even with this sense of fun and
friendship, many people choose not to get involved. Many
factors must be considered by individuals before commit-
ting themselves to Engineers’ Week.

The greatest factor is one of time, or, more accurately,

for You?

the lack of it. Time, for all engineering students, is a pre-
cious commodity and cannot be wasted. With this being
true, why do people willingly give up their time and partici-
pate in Engineers’ Week? Many say that by simply reorgan-
izing their social lives, they have found the needed time to
participate. No longer do they lay around their rooms
watching TV or wasting time in Peter's Pub or at a movie.
Now they spend their time with fellow classmates in help-
ing to prepare for the upcoming events. By readjusting
your social life in this manner, you simply change your
activities in a way which helps you to diversify yourself
without losing any of your precious study time. It is also
important to note that by this reorganization of your social
life, it is very possible that your financial resources will
improve, for Engineers’ Week activities are free. (Except
for the Shamrock Ball.) When students decide to give time
to Engineers’ Week, they must be willing to work even
harder at their studies. They will no longer have as great a
quantity of time for studying; therefore it is necessary to
improve the quality of their study time instead. They will
no longer be able to waste time, for all spare time must be
divided between studies and social life. In general, everyone
interviewed felt that the time put into the events was far
exceeded by the amount of fun derived from their
involvement.

Since sacrifices must be made by everyone in order to
participate, the question arises as to how strong of a desire
to win actually exists. Is the purpose still to have fun or is it
to win? It is the opinion of most that Engineers’ Week is a
friendly competition. People strive to make their depart-
ments’ performance better and better, but the actual per-

formance is still secondary to being able to compete. A
sense of togetherness is formed inside each department
along with many friendships and the pleasure of accomp-
lishing a goal.

At present, the friendly rivalry has progressed into a
period in which extensive teasing and joking takes place.
Most departments take’ turns being insulted and insulting
the others. Still, the rivaly has a friendly atmosphere. It is
not and will not become a heated rivalry such as a Pitt—Penn
State confrontation.

Regardless of how much fun is involved, the question
must arise as to how a department can have a better perfor-
mance in Engineers’ Week. Opinions vary on this subject,
but a central point can be found which is the motivation of
most individuals. It is important to have motivated people
organizing the different events. In order to motivate peo-
ple, it is essential to talk to them. Sure, speaking in seminar
will convince some people, but this must be followed up.
The small groups and individuals must be directly
addressed by the individual organizer for each department.
If this is done, then the organizer can expect the greatly
needed supply of help. The chairman of each department
must be enthusiastic about what he or she is doing. If the
chairmen are excited, then so will be the rest of the depart-
ment, but if they come across in a dull manner, it will be
hard to convince anyone else to participate.

Another way in which to excel in Engineers’ Week is to
start preparation early. This is unlikely to happen on a large
scale, for in most cases it seems that working as the dead-
line draws closer brings more fun than if you had been
organized all along. For example, it is traditional to stay up
all night to do the final construction on the parade float. To
do away with this ritual would almost be sacrilegious.

Another technique used by those who organize Engi-
neers’ Week is to get their friends involved. Friends will
come through in a clutch. Also, the more people involved
for a department, the easier the preparation for Engineers’
Week will be.

Some special problems arise for the Freshmen in prepar-
ing for Engineers’ Week. They have never experienced this
competition before and cannot be certain what to expect.
Freshmen also lack the advantage of having known their
fellow classmates for a period of years. In order to over-
come these difficulties, freshmen must use their assets of
enthusiasm and hard work to their fullest extent.

Difficulties are more the rule than the exception during
the preparation for Engineers’ Week. However, the depart-
ments are usually able to overcome their problems and
make each Engineers’ Week memorable and rewarding for
all concerned. It is this writer's opinion that if you get
involved with Engineers’ Week, you will have a memory
that can be cherished forever.

Putting Theory into Practice

(or Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire)

by John C. Gargani and LuAnne Schmidt

Having acquired basic scientific, mathematical, and com-
puter knowledge, undergraduate engineering students are
prime candidates for technical positions in University
research groups. This article is based on interviews with
engineering undergraduates who are presently employed
by the University of Pittsburgh in technical positions.

Alan Dorundo is a senior electrical engineering student
presently working in the Chemistry Department. (No, that
wasn't a misprint, an E.E. is working in the Chemistry
Building.) This strange combination developed through a
complex set of circumstances. A1, a member of Tau Bet Pi,
had first heard John Enyart, an administrative executive in
the Chemistry Department, speak at his initiation dinner.
This passed without much notice until Triangle Fraternity
needed a speaker for its Founders’ Day banquet. Al sug-
gested Mr. Enyart, and he subsequently did speak at that
occasion. After dinner Al approached Mr. Enyart, intro-
duced himself and from there the two struck up a conversa-
tion. In the conversation, Mr. Enyart mentioned that there
were some openings in the Chemistry Department for
summer employment and that Al should bring down his
resume. The next day Mr. Enyart called and offered A1 a job
to work in his office. A] has worked there ever since.

Originally Al's duties involved administrative program-
ming, centered around menu-driven software. The pro-
grams were meant to interact with individuals who were
not necessarily familiar with computers. Most of his pro-
grams were aimed at easing the load placed upon the secre-
taries. An example of his work was a data base oriented
program which dealt with the graduate school's admission
process. The best applicants were selected with the aid of
this program. Another example was a data base process
whose purpose was to keep track of failing students and see
how they did as they progressed through Chemistry. The
major work of the summer was an accounting program
which was used to keep track of research grants.

The remarkable point to be made about Al's work is that
his programs are even now being used throughout the
Chemistry Department. Al commented on this by saying,
”It’s a great feeling to see your work being used everyday.”

Al has also learned many things from his employment.
He said, ”I like it because of the experience it's given me in
computer programming and systems development, but
because of this experience I've found computer program-
ming not to be one of my major ambitions. DO loops only
thrill you for so long."

As well as being a senior electrical engineer and a
member of Tau Beta Pi, Al is a brother of Triangle Frater-
nity and a member of Eta Kappa Nu, the electrical engineer-
ing honorary.

Currently Al is going through the rigors of a job search,
traveling the nation, looking for that perfect employer.
However, he recently did have time to travel to Atlantic
City as an official committee aide to the Society of Analyti-
cal Chemists of Pittsburgh. This is just one of the many
opportunities that have developed for Alas a result of that
complex set of circumstances.

In his work in the Chemistry Department, Al Dorundo
has written many computer programs to assist the
department’s administration.

Carmen Whitson is a junior electrical engineering stu-
dent who is employed part time as a Research Assistant in
the University of Pittsburgh Physics Department. The
position is part of the University's work study program. In
September Carmen looked over the list of work study jobs
available through the financial aid office, and she applied
for a position as a Research Assistant to Dr. J. V. Maher.
She and a few other students were then interviewed for the
position, and Carmen was given the job.

The diffusion of water into oil is the central topic of
investigation in Carmen's lab work. Her lab group is
repeating an experiment that was done previously in order
to verify the results of the first experiment and to deter-
mine if any further conclusions can be drawn. Carmen's
first assignment was to help with the construction of a
Hele-Shaw Cell. The Hele—Shaw Cell consists of two panes
of glass with 1/8" of space between them. The sides are
enclosed, and on either end there is a tube through which a
fluid flows between the panes of glass. Water enters the
I-Iele-Shaw Cell from a raised reservoir on one end, and
olive oil enters the opposite end of the cell. When the water
and the oil meet, they form an interface which is the center
of Dr. Maher's study and Carmen's work. The water moves
into the oil in finger-like projections. Pictures are taken
through the glass every 20 seconds as the interface forms
and moves. Analyzing these pictures with a computer is a
large part of Carmen's current work.

The digitizer in Forbes Quadrangle RJE Center allows
Carmen to store information about the interface in data
files. Carmen uses the light table and a computer terminal;
when she traces the outline of the interface with a special
instrument, the digitizer records points at regular intervals
along the traced path.

Carmen is also involved with writing the computer pro-
gram which will analyze the data stored by the digitizer. In
order to write the program, Carmen has needed to do
library and lab research to determine some of the constants
for the equations which are to be programmed. These
constants include the surface tension of the oil and viscosi-
ties and densities of the oil and water.

Carmen likes what she's doing and says that the time
schedule is very convenient. "I can work on my own time.
Since a lot of the work is on the computer, I can write and
enter the programs in the evening or whenever it's conve-
nient for me." Carmen works about 6 to 10 hours a week.

Dr. Maher is in Paris, France now on a sabbatical, but
since he and Dr. Briggs have taught Carmen what she
needs to know, she is now able to take initiative on her own
and continue the work that needs to be done.

Carmen believes that the lab has been a good experience.
She plans to attend graduate school for electrical engineer-
ing after she receives her Bachelor's Degree. She plans to
study a physics related topic, but it will not be fluid flow. "It
will probably be solid state physics."

Carmen Whitson’s responsibilities as a Research
Assistant for the Physics Department include a lot of
computer work.

The Legend of the Lobby

by B. Gilmer

There are few things in life that you can rely on: rain
falling from the clouds, the sun rising in the east (or is it the
west?) and at least one man will be sitting in the lobby of
Benedum Hall. No it is not Michael Benedum, it's another
famous engineer. Doubtless that in the many times that
you have passed through Benedum Lobby on your way to
wherever, you have seen one small man sitting in the
corner keeping watch over the lobby. You may have
noticed him, but do you know his name?

He is Daryl ”]ohn" Wayne McCann by name, soon to

become a Pitt legend.
Daryl came to the University some time ago (the exact date
cannot be verified; some think that the building may have
been built around him) to take up Electrical Engineering.
He has, however, become more than another EE major. He
is a virtual endless source of knowledge. Dr. Brainard fre-
quently can be seen receiving advice from Daryl on a wide
variety of topics.

Scuba diving: Daryl has been scuba diving for years. He
spent a summer working for the University of Florida
Department of Biology as a scuba diver.

Sky diving: Daryl learned to sky dive while working as a
consultant to the U.S. Army Special Forces. He has since
made over 1000 jumps. Daryl says he was 6'1" before he
started sky diving but after all those jumps he is now only
5'4".

Ski patrol: Daryl learned to ski while he was on a special
assignment for the CIA in the Swiss Alps. He was captured
by enemy forces and thrown down a mountain (luckily he
was wearing his trusty portable skis) and learned to ski the
hard way. He enjoyed it so much he perfected his skills and
now he works on the ski patrol at Seven Springs.

Martial Arts: Daryl wanted to learn the discipline of the
Ninja, but the local instructor refused to teach him so he
called Japan and made a special request to the master of the
Ninja art form. Daryl is now a proficient killer. His favorite
weapon is the toothpick. Daryl claims that he can kill a
person from forty feet with an ordinary toothpick. He
works weekends for a local firm called Hire-a-Killer.

Demolitions: When Daryl was working as a consultant
to the Army, he learned to use explosives. He is now a
certified Demolitions Expert. Once he planned to mine the
Cathedral of Learning so he would have an excuse to turn
in a term paper late.

So.viet Small Arms: As a youngster Daryl developed an
interest in guns, which became an obsession. For several
years he learned about Soviet guns from his cousin (a
mercenary). He was not content to look at the pictures, so
he slipped behind the Iron Curtain to obtain the real thing.
Daryl is the only living private citizen to own a license on an
AK—47. Daryl works for the U.S Army Special Forces as a
Soviet Small Arms Consultant.

CIA: Daryl was hired by the CIA to do something,
exactly what we may never know for sure. Some speculate
that he is a super spy of the James Bond class. (”My name is
McCann, Daryl McCann.")

Engineering: Engineering as in the other sense, driving
trains. Daryl is an accomplished train driver. He learned to
drive trains before he could drive a car. Daryl’s grandfather
taught him how to drive the Iron Horse. Daryl still cannot
drve a car, but that does not stop him from commuting to
school. Though, I wonder sometimes where he parks the
train.

Train Repair: There are not too many repair shops left in
this area but if your caboose ever gives you trouble you can
always bring it in to Benedum Lobby to have it repaired by
an expert. Daryl also restores trains to their former glory.
Daryl works at Station Square restoring locomotives.

Robotics: Daryl worked for a time at the robotics lab at
CMU. The details of his job are vague but there is a good
indication that he was being used as a model for artifical
intelligence.

Now that you are thoroughly amazed by the scope of
knowledge and experience that this man has amassed you
may still have a few questions that need to be answered
such as: Why has he been here so long? Where did he come
from? Why does he stay here? What motivates him? Is he
hiding form a sordid past? I will attempt to answer these
and many other burning questions in the following
paragraphs.

Why has he been here so long?

This is an easy question to answer. Obviously he has
been coming back to Benedum Lobby day after day because
he has not been going anywhere else. As the years toll past
the amount of time he has been here grows longer and
longer. The odd thing is not the natural passage of time but
that no one can fix the date of his arrival at Benedum Hall.

Where did he come from?

There are many theories as to the origins of Daryl. There
is the UFO theory. Many of us believe that life (Daryl) here
began somewhere out there. Which leads us to suppose
that Daryl was brought here by an alien life form as a probe
to gather data on us. This would explain why he has been
here so long, because it is his mission. Then there is the
Fourth Dimension Hypothesis. Daryl really is not there: he
just looks like he is always there. Actually he exists in a
dimension that defies time and logic, similar to those we
studied in Math 25. Therefore Daryl did not come from
anywhere. There is also the Spy Theory. Daryl may actu-
ally be a spy sent over here by an evil force. This is the most
viable theory. He could be working for the Soviets, sent
here to find out how our engineering students train. Or
perhaps CMU sent him here to study how real engineering
students behave. Then there is always the possibility that
he is working for someone on the inside. SWE, ESC, BEC or
RJE could have hired him (if they have to spell it they must
have something to hide). The theory that most of us decide
to settle on is the No Origin Theory. The theory was first
suggested by Richard Jackson and later it was agreed upon
by the BLC (Benedum Lobby Corporation) to adopt this as
the official theory. The hypothesis of the theory is that
Daryl has always been here, therefore he has no origin.
Proof of the theory came later when a group of freshmen in
1981 tried to trace back to the time of Daryl’s arrival and
were unsuccessful.

15

Why does he stay here?

If you believe that Daryl was sent here, then it is obvious
that he has to stay here until his mission has been com-
pleted or he is recalled. But if you do not accept this as the
truth, then it creates a most interesting question. Possibly
he continues to go to classes here because he wants to get a
degree like the rest of us. But that argument seems to
weaken when you learn that he has amassed over 130
credits and is still taking only sophomore level courses.
Maybe he is independently wealthy and has no better way
to spend his waking hours. The most logical reason would
be that he is needed here. Many times during the day,
people approach him to borrow his lighter, read his news-
paper, smoke his cigarettes, or ask him the time, among
other services that he provides. Daryl does keep track of all
the girls that walk through the lobby. Daryl is the one to
see of you have lost your lunch date. He can tell you after
only a short description, when she passed through his field
of vision, which way she was headed, and what books she
was carrying at the time. Come registration time, Daryl
becomes the resident expert on electives, since it seems
that he has taken them all. Without Daryl holding down the
lobby we would all be lost. This is why he stays here.

What motivates Daryl?

Daryl must have an incredible drive for such a colorful
background at such a young age. Right now he is in idle
getting ready to embark on another wild adventure. Some-
where in him is a raw source of energy which is infinite. So
how can he be content to come to school day after day?
Perhaps there is a basic good that transcends his need for
excitement. This good keeps him returning day after day.
Then again maybe his parents are after him to stay in
school and get a degree.

All in all, Daryl is still a mystery. But the core of the
matter is that he is still there. With all the changes going on
around you, you can still depend on one thing: Come
tomorrow morning, Daryl will be in Benedum lobby in his
place under the picture of Michael Benedum, holding down
the fort.

(1) The figure shown below is uncommonly referred to
as a ”Kachavud". It is formed by rolling a circle on a line and
marking the path of a point on the edge of the circle. The
swimming pool at the Skyscraper Engineer Summer Para-
dise in beautiful downtown Budapest was constructed by
Daryl McCann in the shape of a ”Kachavud" using a circle
with a diameter of ninety six feet. Daryl says a pagager is a
yard. If the pool is six feet deep, what is its volume in cubic
pagagers?

(2) Georgie, a rich old man, says he owes part of his
wealth to his childhood friend, Billie Bob. Billie Bob told
Georgie to save twenty—five cents a month and to put the
money in the bank, once a year at the end of each year. His
interest is compounded once a year. Georgie followed Billie
Bob's advice starting with January, 1917. If Georgie's bank
pays seven percent interest, how much of Georgie's wealth
was acquired by Billie Bob's method as of the end of 1983.7

(4) Craig is a great chess player. He tends to destroy his
opponents very quickly. In his most recent tournament, he
won the championship in the minimum possible number of
moves. The match was best of seven. The person who won
the previous game got to be white in the next game. Craig's
opponent, Kirk, later told us that the match was fixed
because Kirk had to hurry to Orlando to stop his wife from
having an affair with Mickey at Disney World. Because of a
coin toss, Kirk was white the first game. How many moves
did Craig make in that match?

(5) In a game of ”Benedum Poker”, each contestant is
given a positive prime number. The player with the best
poker hand wins. In one memorable game that actually
occurred in the mind of M3, the the Wildman was dealt
10099 (a pair of nines and a pair of zeros). He felt this was a
sure winner and bet everything he had, including his lovely
daughter, Lulu. Big Bull was dealt 68917 and folded. Tex
Taylor had the smallest possible number that could be a full

‘ 9 house, accepted Wildman's bet, and won the hand. What

was Tex dealt?

Last months’s Sl<ycaper's format proved to be quite pop-
ular. The solutions to the five fairly simple questions posed
in the February issue led to a telephone number. Upon
dialing this number, a contestant was given additional clues
by M3. This information pointed to a file named ”BEAUTI—

17

.FUL” stored under project programmer number
115461,154332 on Pitt's DEC—1O system. This file con-
tained four additional questions of significantly greater
difficulty than those posed in the magazine. A final file,
”WEDNES.DAY", contained the final, most challenging
question. The winner of this grueling mental battle was
Barb Marhefka. Barb captured the twenty—five dollar prize
by solving the first five questions correctly, calling M3,
accessing the files above and solving four of the second set
of five questions. Our congratulations to Barb and all the
other entrants, many of whom got as far as calling M3.

The answers to this adventure-filled Skycaper are given
below:

The sum of the answers to the five simple questions in
the last issue was 6,834,799. Upon dialing 683-4799 one
obtained the following clues:

a) uno uno cinco cuatro seis uno

b) uno cinco cuatro tres tres dos

C) beautiful

In the file BEAUTIFUL (115461,154332) were the next
four questions. The solutions to these are as follows:

1) (e) The parabola was not defined

2) (b) The odds of winning equal the odds of rolling a 7, 8,
or 9. Therefore the solution is

1/6 + 5/36 + 1/9=15/36=O.4167

3) 5.67128 or Tan (800°)

The series is Tan (O°), Tan (200°), Tan (400°), Tan (600°),...

4) 24
As shown below, the next line will be the third line of a box.

The final question was contained in the file
WEDNES.DAY:
5) 999,946

Let the number of dots equal n, (n=10). The number of
rectangles fitting the description is
(1/12)(n—2)(n-1)(3n—1)=(1/12)(8)(9)(29)=174O
1740 meters equals 2.4 ush, which, when rounded to the
nearest integer, is two. Two base ten equals two base five.
Finally, with M=3, we have:
2(3)3=2(27)=54
and
1,000,000-54=999,946

The Logical Suspect

Soot particle growth as it takes place in wood-burning fireplaces,
diesel engines, and industrial furnaces, has been attributed

to a complex set of interdependent chemical reactions.

A researcher at the General Motors Research Laboratories has
demonstrated that the decomposition of a single species is

primarily responsible.

SCOT FORMATION may be
divided into two stages.
Microscopic soot particles are gen-
erated in the “inception” stage.
They reach full size in the “growth”
stage, which accounts for more
than 95% of their ﬁnal mass. Most
scientific exploration has concen-
trated on particle inception which,
despite all the effort, remains
unexplained. Dr. Stephen J. Hanis,
a hysical chemist at the General
otors Research Laboratories,
has reversed traditional priorities.
Combining experiment with logic,
he has formulated the first quan-
titative explanation of the growth
stage in soot formation.

Dr. Harris arrived at his
mechanism through an elaborate
process of elimination. To focus
on the chemistry of soot growth,
he began by eliminating from his

investigation the complexities

introduced by turbulence and

mixing. He limited his research to

premixed, ethylene/oxygen, lami-
nar ﬂames with one-dimensional

literature told him t at two pro-
cesses take place simultaneously
during growth. Incipient particles
collide and coalesce into larger
particles, while growing at the
same time by incorporating hydro-
carbon molecules from the burned
gases.

The first process reduces
total surface area without chang-
in total mass, while the second,
ca led “surface growthﬁ’ increases
both total surface area and total
mass. Hence, the increase in the
total mass of soot can be entirely
attributed to surface growth.

Dr. Harris set out to iden-
tify the hydrocarbon molecules-
or “growth species” —responsible
for surface growth. Increasing by
increments the richness of the
ﬂame, he made the key discov-
ery that although the total mass
growth rate (gm/sec) increases
strongly when the ratio of ethyl-
ene to oxy en is increased, the
mass growt rate er unit surface
area( / cm3/ sec increases only
slight y (see Figure 1). Thus, the
controlling variable for how much
soot is formed is not the concen-
tration of growth s ecies, but the
surface area availa le for growth.

This finding led him to con-
clude that richer ﬂames roduce
more total soot because t ey gen-

The brain does it naturally. It
wonders. It thinks with spon-
taneity—advantages we haven't
been able to give computers.
We've made them “smart? able
to make sophisticated calcula-
tions at very fast speeds. But we
have yet to get them to act with
insight, instinct, and intuition.

But what if we could devise
ways to probe into the inner na-
ture of human thought? So com-
puters could follow the same
rationale and reach the same
conclusions a person would.

What if we could actually design
computers to capture the myster-
ies of common sense?

At GE, we've already begun to
implement advances in knowl-
edge engineering. We are cod-
ifying the knowledge, intuition
and experience of expert engi-
neers and technicians into com-
puter algorithms for diagnostic
troubleshooting. At present, we
are applying this breakthrough to
diesel electric locomotive sys-
tems to reduce the number of
engine teardowns for factory
repair as well as adapting this
technology to affect savings in
other areas of manufacturing.

We are also looking at parallel
processing, a method that
divides problems into parts
and attacks them simultaneously,
rather than sequentially, the way

the human brain might.

While extending technology
and application of computer
systems is important, the real
excitement and the challenge of
knowledge engineering is its
conception. At the heart of all
expert systems are master engi-
neers and technicians, preserv-
ing their knowledge and
experience, questioning their
logic and dissecting their
dreams. As one young employee
said, ‘At GE, we're not just shap-
ing machines and technology.
We're shaping opportunity."

Thinking about the possibili-

things happen. And it all starts

erate more particles in the incep-
ore incipient parti-

tion stage. _ _
cles offer greater initial surface

area for the incorporation of hydro-

carbons.
_ Since the growth rate per
unit area must depend on growth

species concentration, this con-

centration must be similar from
ﬂame to ﬂame. Dr. Harris went
on to reason that there must either
be enough growth species at the
outset to account for the total soot
growth in the richest ﬂame, or
the species must be rapidly formed
within the flame from another
hydrocarbon present in high
enough concentration.

HE NARROWED his search
to the four most abundant
classes of hydrocarbons found in
ﬂames: acetylene, polyacetylenes,
okrgiclic aromatic hydrocarbons
FP ), and methane. Methane
can be eliminated, because its
concentration does not decrease
as soot is roduced. There is not
enough P H to account for soot
formation in an ﬂame. Neither
of these two hy rocarbons can be
readily formed from the other major
species present. That left only
acetylene and the polyacetylenes.
Acetylene contains enou h

hydrogen to account for the hy 0-

gen content of soot measured in
the early stages of growth. But
among the polyacetylenes, only
diacetylene could possibly supply

enough h drogen. That left acet-

ylene an diacetylene.

There is more than enough
acetylene to account for the mass
of soot produced. There is not
enough diacetylene, and while
diacetylene can be formed from
the ab/undant supply of acetylene,
the reported rate of conversion is
too slow for diacet lene to play a
significant role. hat left only
acetylene.

Dr. Harris verified that acet-

ylene is the growth s ecies by

determining that the sligllft increase

in growth rate per unit area is

proportional to the increase in

acetylene concentration (see Fig-
ure 1). He also found that the rate

constant he measured was in

agreement with the reported rate

constant for the decom osition of

acetylene on carbon. hese find-
ings confirmed his hypothesis that

soot particles grow in ﬂames by

the incorporation and subsequent

decom osition of acetylene.

Sir:

I am a Freshman Engineering major here at Pitt. This
being my most impressionable year at college, I have a
strong desire to find a respectable role model to whom I
could devote my admiration. At last, I found M3. Indeed,
what more respectable figure could possibly exist?

Alas, even M3 has recently dealt me a brutal slashing. A
few of my friends and I began a political discussion when
we realized that we did not know who was running against
Ronald Reagan on the Republican ticket in this year's Presi-
dential primaries. Neither could we recall our current
Secretary of State. Proudly, I proclaimed that M3 could
surely answer our questions.

Upon calling our fearless hero, I was greatly distressed to
discover that he could answer neither of our questions.
Hard to believe? Sad, but true! My view of the world has
been shattered. The reign of M3 as a torch bearer for truth
and knowledge has ended. To whom am I to turn for
guidance? Without M3, I fear I am helpless.

Remorsefully,

A note from 

Dear Tim,

lfound your letter very moving, but I must take this timeto clear upa
few things. In response to yourfirst question, I told you that no one in
their right mind would run against Ronald Reagan, our President
through 1988. Also, I know that the Secretary of State is George
Schultz. I didn't answer your question because you called at one o'clock in
the morning. I'd be honored to take a fine young man like yourselfunder
my wing.

Sincerely,

m3

The Joy of Studying

by Joseph Seman

Engineering students of the world, take note! Do you
dread the very thought of studying for your exams? Do
you despise the idea of spending night after sleepless night
doing your transport problems or writing up your various
lab reports? Does you flesh crawl whenever a professor
sets the date for an exam due to the anticipation of the
studying that accompanies engineering exams? Well my
friends, cringe no more! I am about to open to you all the
gates to the true path to eternal engineering happiness —in
other words, I'm going to let you all in on the deep and
visciously guarded secrets concerning the actual enjoyment
of studying for those masochist's delights, engineering
exams. Read on, ye searchers for knowledge, and learn the
mysteries!

The first step toward enjoying the studying for and
taking of engineering exams is attaining the proper atti-
tude. This can be accomplished in many ways. A very
common method of dealing with this dilemma is to adopt
the famous ”grades don't matter to me, I'm more concerned
with what I really know," stance. This is one hell of a great
attitude. However, though his grades may not matter to
the one who has this attitude, they do, most unfortunately,
matter to the the head of a particular department, who
then takes the famous ”let’s toss his worthless carcass out
of our department” stance. Needless to say, this is not a
popular attitude among upperclassmen. The second best
alternative is to simply realize that exams and studying are
integral parts of learning, which are integral parts of get-
tin’g a degree, which is a necessary step in the pursuit of an
engineering career, which is a step toward the ultimate goal
of making exhorbitant amounts of money for phenome-
nally little actual work and effort. The third stance, which
may not be the best but is often the most effective, is the
”Oh, God, if I don't pass this exam my parents will disown
me and I'll have to join the Foreign Legion," approach. The
reasons for this approach’s effectiveness are obvious.

After attaining the proper frame of mind, one must
consider time. The proper time to start studying for an
exam is not fifteen minutes before the test. One must start
at least a full hour before an exam if a passing grade is
expected. An alternate time schedule calls for beginning
the actual studying at least a week before the exam. This
alternative gains many supporters as the term progresses
and grades plummet due to the use of the time table menti-
oned above.

With the when and why of studying taken care of, the
next important aspect to consider is where? There are of
course many places at the university that a person can
study quietly. I-Iillman Library is a popular choice, probably
due to the excellent scenery one can observe there. Bene-
dum comes to mind also, but once the computer center
closes our vigilant campus police officers make sure that
none of the suspicious engineering students try and steal

the tensil testing machine out of the basement. And as far
as excitement is concerned, it can't even begin to compete
with Hillman for pure thrills. Where else can one study
bothered only_ by a slew of non-English speaking students
and the occasional flasher? Then there is the always pres-
ent fear of falling asleep in the library. (Why should I be
afraid of falling asleep in the library?” you ask. Ever spend
the night in the library, my friend? Worse yet, have you
ever called the campus police and told them that you were
locked in the library?) These places considered, the only
good choice is a nice warm dorm room with plenty of light,
a nice comfortable desk chair, a drawer full of munchies,
good tunes on the stereo (Pink Floyd, preferably), and most
importantly of all, companionship. It is absolutely neces-
sary to study with a student of the opposite sex. This
facilitates a better understanding of the material and also
acts as a stabilizing agent, for one student can act as an
inspiration for the other. It also makes for some great study
breaks.

Having attained the proper attitude, gotten the time
frame worked out, and settled into a comfortable environ-
ment which is conducive to studying, now it is time to get
down to the actual studying. This is always an interesting
experience. First one must figure out what will be on the
test. Never study things that appear to be important, as
these will invariably not be on the test. Look for obscure,
seemingly worthless bits of information buried in the text.
Never- study from the notes that were given in class, as
these almost never agree with the book, and are soley given
for the purpose of confusing the students. Never study the
sample or homework problems, as the problems on a test
usually look like they were taken from a different class.
Most of all, never believe that what a professor tells you is
going to be on a test is going to actually be there. If at all
possible talk to about ten people who have had the course
before you. They will always tell you that all the tests were
either so hard that no one in the entire galaxy could have
passed them if they had studied for millenia, or that the
tests were so easy that their pet tarantula got an A in the
course. The best thing to do is to study everything and pray
for a good curve.

Well, there are the deep secrets for enjoying studying. If
you have taken this article seriously you are in dire need of
help. My advice to you is to transfer to Penn State—you’ll
fit in well there. If you haven't taken it seriously, I hope you
could identify with at least some of the situations that I
mentioned. If I have offended anyone I am am deeply sorry,
regardless of how thin-skinned and self important you may
be. For those of you who took this article as it was meant I
leave you with this thought: Would you have half as much
fun at school if you didn't have to spend so many hours
sweating and slaving over your books?

Books you may have missed

In this last article of the series we shall look at a very
likable and satisfying novel by Ernest Hemingway. Islands in
the Stream is an enjoyable blend of pleasant, poignant and
suspenseful episodes in the life of a strong willed man
named Thomas Hudson. In each of the three tales in this
book, the same aspects of Thomas Hudson's character sur-
face. He is very fond of his family and friends. He is closely
tied to the natural world—having a great respect for its
inhabitants and always noting the weather and the mood of
the sea. Lastly, it does not matter to him what he does but
only that he is the best at what he does. These rather
universal qualities make it very easy to identify with Tho-
mas Hudson, giving the three tales a personal meaning.

When the book begins, Thomas Hudson is living alone in
the Bimini Islands east of Florida. He is a painter and he
makes a comfortable living from the paintings that his
dealer sells for him in New York. He is happily anticipating
the arrival of his sons who are visiting him for the summer.

Thomas Hudson's amicable qualities surface imme-
diately when he thinks of his home, which is in many ways
like him. "The house was built on the highest part of the
narrow tongue of land between the harbor and the open
sea. It had lasted through three hurricanes and was built
solid as a ship. It was shaded by tall coconut palms that were
bent by the trade wind and on the ocean side you could walk
out of the door and down the bluff across the white sand
and into the Gulf Stream.” When his sons arrive, Thomas
Hudson tries hard to give them a happy summer. He also
succeeds in having a very happy summer because he spends
much of it watching his second son, Dave, grow up. In an
exciting scene that occurs when they are spearfishing Dave
is nearly taken by a shark: "Out across the blue water,
showing like a brown dinghy sail and slicing through the
water with heavy, tail-propelled, lunging thrusts, the high

triangular fin was coming in toward the hole at the edge of
the reef where the boy with the mask on his face held his
fish up out of the water." The shark is shot by another
fisherman. Later, David battles a fish for a grueling six
hours only to lose him next to the boat.

As that long happy summer draws to a close, Thomas
Hudson becomes worried about being alone again; one by
one his self—reinforcing habits have fallen away while his
sons visited. Now he does not want the summer to end:
"But the happiness of the summer began to drain out of
him as when the tide changes on the flats and the ebb
begins in the channel that opens out to sea. He watched the
sea and the line of the beach and he noticed that the tide had
changed and the shore birds were working busily well
down the slope of the new wet sand.”

The book shifts to a somewhat more subdued mood as
the second episode begins. Thomas Hudson now lives in
Cuba when he is not at sea hunting Nazi submarines. He is
alone again but now he does not paint; he waits for the call
that tells him he must go out to sea again. Thomas Hud-
son's outlook becomes bleak when he is ashore because he
feels he must always be doing something and he does not
like the waiting. "After they were all gone he lay on the
fiber matting on the floor and listened to the wind.” While
he is passing the interminable wait drinking in a bar, Tho-
mas Hudson's first wife, whom he still loves, finds him. He
must tell her that he has just heard that their son has been
killed in the war over France. He is heartbroken but he
finally brings himself to do it, and his thoughts about her
reaction show the melancholy ‘of the second book: "She
certainly took it awfully well. But then it hasn't really hit
her. I wish I could help her when it hits her. I wish I could be
some real good to her...Get it straight. Your boy you lose.
Love you lose. Honor has been gone a long time. Duty you
do."

It is with this grim determination that we find Thomas
Hudson in the third book. He is at sea with a small crew
hunting the survivors of a sunken German submarine. The
Germans are ruthlessly making their way toward Havana
and safety after massacring a small village and stealing
their boats. When at last, after a suspenseful hunt they find
the Germans , the confrontation is electric. "Then he saw a
crab come sliding out fast from the high mangrove roots
and plop in the water. He looked hard into the mangroves
but could see nothing beyond the trunks and branches.
Another crab come out very fast and went into the water.
Just then they opened up on him. He did not see the blink-
ing flash and he was hit before he heard the stutter of the
gun.” During the sad ending, we remember the sunny
carefree days that Thomas Hudson lived when his sons
visited him in Bimini and this makes the ending sadder still.

One leaves Islands in the Stream with great fondness for the
rough but friendly Thomas Hudson. We see his happiest
moments and his sad end. Mostly, we admire the integrity

with which he lived his life.
