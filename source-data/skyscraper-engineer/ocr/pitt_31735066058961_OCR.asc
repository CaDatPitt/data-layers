current-Pumped Abrupt
Junction Varactor
Power-Frequency Converters

The varactor diode has become well known
as an excellent device for low-noise ampliﬁca-
tion. Recently, however, the varactor diode
has been used in high-level frequency con-
verters as both a means of obtaining large
amounts of power, tunable over wide band-
widths, and as a means of placing FM and PM
information on a CW source, such as a
varactor multiplier. The high-level parametric
upconverter differs from a low-noise para-
metric ampliﬁer in the area of conversion
eﬂiciency.

Coaxial—Balun Push-Pull Converter

One of the problems in the large signal
solution for a varactor frequency converter
is the inﬁnite number of terms found when
attempting to evaluate the Taylor expansion
for charge as a function of voltage for an
arbitrary varactor. If one reverses this approach ,
and ﬁnds the expansion for voltage as a
function of charge, with a junction exponent,
'Y, of 1/2 (abrupt junction varactor), it is found
that the series is ﬁnite and easily utilized to
ﬁnd a more exact solution for the diode
transfer impedance.

Because of its inherent symmetry, a push-
pull application of the diodes provides a large
degree of signal isolation, as well as an in-
crease in allowable input power. This type
of circuit provides an output at the upper
sideband frequency which may be isolated
from the pump circuit, by diode balance,
without the need for lossy ﬁlters. Tunability
is readily attained using the appropriate im-
pedance matching networks without the added
complications associated with low-loss tunable
ﬁlters. A low-pass ﬁlter is necessary in the
signal port to prevent the pump power from
being dissipated in the signal circuit.

A simpliﬁed representation of a circuit using
only coaxial networks, is shown in the ﬁgure.
This particular circuit uses what might be
referred to as a section of coaxial-coax. The
diodes are pumped in series by means of a
balanced transmission line, which may be
designed using the techniques available for
constructing “balun transformers.” The signal

is introduced through a low-pass ﬁlter and
drives the diodes in the push-pull, parallel
mode. The resultant idler is generated in a
TEM mode, with the conductors acting as a
quarter-wave coaxial tuning assembly. The
output may be removed using a current probe,
coupled to the idler center conductor at the
proper impedance tap. The output cavity may
be tuned by varying the position of the rear
shorting wall (A-A), using sliding ﬁnger con-
tacts. With this approach, power levels of
several watts have been handled with a con-
version loss of 3db compared to power level
of several milliwatts with l0db conversion loss
for conventional resistive mixers.

Room Temperature GaAs
Laser Communications

Communications was among the ﬁrst appli-
cations considered after the invention of the
laser. Practical realization of the goal was
delayed by the diﬁiculties associated with
ineﬁicient energy conversion and inadequate
modulation techniques. The discovery of the
semiconductor injection laser in 1962 greatly
reduced these difficulties, but introduced the
restriction of operation under cryogenic con-
ditions. Gallium arsenide injection lasers

 

promise energy conversion efficiencies of 20-
30%, while modulation of the optical signal
can be accomplished simply by modulating
the injection current. Early in 1964, the cryo-
genic restriction was eliminated when efforts of
RCA scientists proved successful in discovering
a type of gallium arsenide diode which ex-
hibited laser action at room temperature with
threshold currents much lower han those
previously reported. This discovery permitted
the engineering of a room temperature com-
munications link and in May, 1964, such a
communications link was demonstrated for
the ﬁrst time. The system employs pulse fre-
quency modulation at a 20 kc repetition rate,
has a bandwidth of 5 kc, and can operate in
bright sunlight. Ranges up to three miles have
been obtained while operating within the atmos-
phere. Using parallel diodes, a much greater
range is feasible. The narrow linewidth of 20
angstroms permits the use of narrow band
optical ﬁlters thereby reducing background
noise. The system is free of radio frequency

15 Megacycle Tape
Bandwidth Response

RCA engineers have developed an advanced
magnetic recording system with the highest
bandwidth response reported to date. This
achievement results from integrated efforts in
all phases of magnetic recording, such as:
air bearing design, high performance servos
(50 kc response), precision mechanisms and
magnetic head circuitry.

This recent accomplishment is being used in
equipment with two 8 Mc bandwidth channels
designed for application in a precision radar
system. In this design the heads are rotated to
achieve 3200 inch-per-second head-to-tape
speed in a transverse scan mode. The unit uses
a specialized form of a frequency modulated
carrier system to achieve a response from 100
cycles per second to 8 Me. The 3200 IPS head
speed permits a wavelength of 0.32 mils at a
10 Mc FM carrier. Head gap lengths of
90 x 10-6 inches are employed to achieve
FM response to 15 Mc.

 

CIosed—loop electronically
variable delay line system

In order to effect a high reproduction ac-
curacy for radar use, ﬁve servomechanisms are
employed to insure stability of tape and head
motion. The most interesting of these is a
pure electronic servo employing the principle
of variable delay to remove time displacement
errors from the signal. This system employs a
25 to 1 loop gain at a bandwidth of 50 kc.
This closed-loop system achieves a time-base
accuracy of -_l—l0 nanoseconds. The rms value
of this error is less than 5 nanoseconds,
equivalent to less than 5 feet of radar range
error, a new standard of excellence for radar
recording accuracy.

SALINE WATER CONVERSION

A decade of research into appropriate means of
processing saline water has proved successful.
In another ten years, economically operated de-
salinization plants will have become a reality.

As one reads articles in contempo-
rary magazines, he often sees an
advertisemen-t explaining how some
city was able to solve its water
shortage problem. Or he might read
how the water crisis in the United
States will continue to rise. Is the
United States actually experiencing a
Water crisis or is it only a water
panic? It is true that many cities and
states do suffer from a water prob-
lem. Yet there are large quantities of
water which cannot be used due to
their high content o-f impurities. Much
of this water comes from the ocean;
water which has high quantities of
sodium and chloride among other
chemical compounds.

Water is not only the cheapest
commodity available in the United
States today, it is also the greatest
article in demand. And the conver-
sion of saline water to fresh water has
become both an interesting and im-
portant engineering problem. Pure
water being one of the most important
of our natural resources, the neces-
sity of insuring the future supplies
needed for our economy is very im-
portant. The belief that the supply
of water will never be a problem in
the United States is a fallacy due to
the fact that most parts of the country
have suﬁicient supplies of water to-
day, but “estimates call for anywhere
from ﬁve hundred to six hundred bil-
lion gallons pe-r day (bgd) as the
basic requirement only twenty years
from now. And between nine hundred

and a thousand (bgd) are estimated
to be needed by the year 2000.”
Today, the United States alone uses
up 300 billion gallons per day, and
this causes problems in availability of
water in many areas.

Experimental data has shown that
the total available water as rainfall on
land areas throughout the world is
sufﬁcient to supply the needs of con-
sumption. Water availability being a
function of time, place, and climate,
however, the main problem is that the
water is not uniformly distributed.
There are many inhabited areas to-
day which have water shortages, and
there are some localities that have
never before had a water problem but
which are now beginning to feel the
pinch.

What exactly can be done about the
water shortage problems in certain
areas? Many methods have been de-
vised for the transportation of water
by huge pipelines and canals, since at
present, any large city in the United
States can get fresh water from a dis-
tant river via a long aqueduct more
cheaply than the present machine can
extract it from the ocean. On the
other hand, farmers need so much
water for each acre of crops that they
cannot afford either sea—water conver-
sion by present methods or a long
adequeduct. Now sea—water conver-
sion costs are too much for practical
and large quantity use, but perhaps
in the future the desalinization of sea-
water and brackish waters will be the

By Jacki Katz

most economical Way of supplying the
needed water.

With the realization that many in-
habited areas o-f the would are faced
or will be faced with a water supply
problem, many engineers and scien-
tists have done much research and
development in converting sea water
to pure water. In response to this
growing recognition of “the acute
shortage of water in the arid areas of
the nations, and elsewhere,” the Oﬁice
of Saline Water was founded in 1952
by the enactment of Public Law 448,
whic hwas passed by the Eighty-
Second Congress. By this law the
Department of the Interior was di-
rected “to engage in a ﬁve-year pro-
gram of research and development,
through grants and contracts with
competent individuals and institu-
tions, that would create ‘practical,
low—cost means of producting from
sea—water or from other saline waters,
water of a quality suitable for agri-
cultural, industrial, municipal, and
other beneﬁcial consumptive use.’ ”
In 1958, Congress authorized the
Office of Saline Water to build and
put into operation ﬁve “demonstra-
tion plants” of types that would “test
the engineering an-d economic feasibil-
ity of ﬁve processes, and that might
provide some measure of relief in areas
of critical water shortage.” The chart
below lists the demonstration plants
and the desalinization processes.

It is noticed that some of the plants
use sea water and others use brackish

well water. In order to compare the
salt content of the brackish water to
that of the sea-water, it must be noted
that the salt content of sea-water is
35,000 parts per million (ppm) total
dissolved sal-ts. ,

Changing salt water to fresh is
nothing new by any means. _It has
been done on a small scale by distilla-
tion for many years and modern ships
cons-tantly make good use of this old
method. The Federal government,
however, is interested in large scalt,
low-cost techniques which differ
vastly from the older processes. Thus
the government is sparing little ex-
pense in authorizing multi-million dol-
lar expenditures in this ﬁeld. Numer-
ous methods are being investigated
and experimented with.

The ﬁve processes listed above plus
solar distilla-tion have been found to
be the most promising of the many
methods used to convert sea water to
pure water.

Before the major methods of de-
salinization are discussed, it might be
interesting to note what chemical
compounds are actually found in sea
water .and how much of it there is.

If one dipped up a barrel of water
from most places in the oceans of the
world, he will ﬁnd th-at the amount of
dis-solved chemicals for every hundred
pounds of sea water is very clos-e t-o
trree and a half pounds. A thousand
gallons of sea water taken into a plant
at 50° F. is found experimentally to
weight 8571 pounds. The dissolved
chemicals would total three hundred
pounds and the pure water 8271
pounds.

The mixture of chemical compounds
found in the three hundred pounds
will include not only sodium chloride
or rock salt, the most plentiful, but
also magnes-ium sulfate, potassium
magnesium sulfate, potassium chlo-
ride, potassium magnesium chloride,
magnesium chloride, and many other
compounds. In addition to the ions,
there are a few neutral molecules, the
two principle ones being the boric acid
molecule and the silica molecule.

The top ten chemical compounds
which are listed below constitute
299.8 pounds of the total weight of
three hundred pounds. Thirty-four
other compounds comprise the re-
maining two-tenths of a pound.

It is interesting for one to compare
the contents of the ocean wi-th ordi-
nary hard water from wells and rivers.
Not only does sea water contain far
more dissolved materials than well

water or river water, but it also has
greatly different proportions of the
various ions. In land waters, the
largest impurities are usually the cal-
cium, magnesium, and bicarbonate
ions, instead of the chloride, sodiums,
and sulfate of the ocean. For this
reason, most ordinary municipal
Water-softening systems are inapplica-
ble for treating sea water. The waiter-
softening system usually acts to re-
move calcium and magnesium ions,
which are the chief soap wasters, and
sometimes the bicarbonate ions, but
they do not decrease the sodium and
chloride content at all.

The most extensively used methods
of desalinization at present are the
distillation or evaporation processes.
In all distillation processes, the solu-
tion of saline water is heated causing
a water vapor to form and leaving the
salt in the solution. The vapor is then
condensed to obtain the fresh water.

In the multiple—eﬁect long—tu'be ver-
tical type of distillation, the saline
water passes through long vertical
tubes in which the temperature of the
water is raised to the boiling point by
the action of condensing water vapor
or steam on the outside of the tubes.
The feed procedes to a separation
chamber where clean vapor is
separated from the brine.

Figure 1 illustrates the prinicples
of this type of distillation. Passing
the hot vapor which has already been
distilled through some pipes in con-
tact With the cool sea-water inlet is
the most obvious way to re-use the

energy in the hot vapor issuing from
the evaporation tank. The next batch
of incoming sea water would serve to
condense the out-going vapor, and at
the same time the heat of the vapor
would ﬂow into this batch of sea
water, so that when the latter enter
the evaporating tank, it is already
hot. The condensed vapor is drawn
off and used as the desired fresh
water. The cycle is repeated through
the following effects with each effect
at a lo-wer temperature and pressure.

Since salt water can be heated
effectively only to 300° F. before ex~
cess scaling will occur, the amount of
temperature and pressure drop puts a
limiting factor on this type of process.
Therefore for an eﬂiciently operated
plant, the temperatures should be
kept below this point. Some scaling
does occur in any distillation process,
but this can be controlled by intro-
ducing ﬁne crystals of the scale form-
ing material in suspension, and the
additional scales that form due to the
distillation will cling to these sus-
pended scales rather than the heating
surface.

One distinctive advantage which
the ﬂash distillation process has over
other distillation units is that no
scales form during the process. “In the
ﬂash evaporation process-, sea water
is ﬁrst heated in tubes and then made
to evaporate in chambers in which a
pressure lower than in the heating
tubes prevails. Since the vapor simply
ﬂashes off the warm liquid, the result-
ing precipitates form in the liquid and
not on any heat transfer surfaces.”

Figure 2 explains the principles of
the ﬂash distillation process. Flash
distillation is advantageous in several
units. The salt water enters a group
of tubes in the vapor space of the
ﬂash chambers Where it is preheated.
Then it passes into the heater where
the temperature is raisd to 100° C.,
but since the pressure is greater than
one atmosphere, no boiling occurs.
The heated sea water then passes into
the ﬂash chamber, Where under re-
duced pressure, a portion of the water
evaporates. The vapor is condensed
on the outside of the tubes where the
sea water is traveling to the heater,
which preheats the sea Water. The
remaining water which is in the ﬂash
chamber flows into the next chamber

The distillation of s.alt water acts in
reverse of electrodialysis. Electrodi-
alysis removes the salt removes the
salt from the water, whereas distilla-
tion removes the water from the salt.
“This method takes advantage of the
fact that salts in water are in the
form of negatively and positively
charges ions.” The electrolysis cell
consists of a set of electrodes between
which are a large number of closely
spaced membranes made of ion ex-
change resins. The two types of mem-
branes used are of such a nature that
they will allow only anions (nega-
tively—charged ions) or only cations
(positively-charged ions) to pass

- through them. When electric current

is applied to the cell, salts are re-
moved from the saline water in alter-
nate compartments between the mem-
branes by transferring ions to adja-
cent compartments, where they are
trapped because the membrane halts
further migration of the respective
ion. The water ﬂo-Wing through the
alternate spaces between the mem-
brane, therefore, consists, respectively,
of water depleted of salt amd an en-
riched brine. (Figure 4). Once the
ions have passed through the mem-
brane, the result is that fresh water
is left behind, and the salt is trapped
around the poles.

“Since the amount of electricity
needed, and the current density are
directly proportional to the salt con-
centration, the method at present is
not considered suitable for the puriﬁ-
cation of raw sea water with its salt
content of 35,000 ppm or more.”

Another type o-f distillation process
is the vapor compression distillation
process, which uses its own steam,
after it has been compressed, as a heat
source. In this method, one effect, or
unit can provide the same energy
economy as that of ﬁfteen to twenty
effect stills as used in the multiple-
effect distillation process except that
a compressor mus-t be added. In this
process, the vapor produced in an
evaporator is compressed and thus
can be used as the heat supply to heat
the solution in the evaporator tubes.
When it is returned to the evaporator,
the compressed vapor, at its higher
temperature, condenses and thus gives
up heat in suﬂicient amount to boil
more salt water. This is an applica-

tion of the heat pump; and the energy
required for evaporation is that which
is supplied to the vapor compressor
(Figure 5). In some vapor compres-
sion apparatus a pump is included in
the system to circulate the sea water
within the system, so that it becomes
a forced-circulation vapor—compres-
sion distillation system.

There are limitations to this type of
installation. Even though the cost of
operation and construction vary in-
versely with the desired temperatures
(that is, as the temperature is raised,
the size of the compressor is reduced) ,
scaling must be considered a controll-
ing factor. Forced circulation of the
water and steam help to prevent the
scaling, thus allowing a higher than
normal temperature and increased
heat exchange.

In another desalinization process,
ice crystals generated by freezing
saline water and washed free of in-
trained salt can be melted to produce

fresh water. The ﬂash evaporation of
precooled sea water at three or four
millimeters of barometric pressure
produces an ice brine mixture from
which the brine is separated and the
ice crystals are washed counter cur-
rently to remove the occluded salt.
The water vapor is either compressed
or condensed on the ice to melt the
ice or absorbed by an absorbent, and
the heat of absorption is utilized to
melt the ice to produce water. An-
other method of freezing is that of
vaporizing an immiscible hydro-car-
bon refrigerant in direct contact with
precooled sea water to produce an
ice—brine mixture. “After washing the
ice crystals free of occluded salt, the
refrigerant vapor is compressed and
condensed on the ice to produce fresh
water. The immiscible liquid refrig-
erant is separated from the water
product be decantation, and traces of
refrigerant remaining in the water are
removed by suitable de-gassing tech-
niques (Figure 6*) .”

There are several notable advan-
tages of the freezing process. It has a
low energy requirement since it re-
quires less energy to free the water
than to boil it and the system oper-
ates at near atmospheric pressure,
wh-ich cuts down on energy require-
ments. Another advantage is that it
minimizes scale and corrision.

The extremely high cost h-as been
the major drawback since research
began on the problem of converting
saline water to fresh water. The pri-
mary objective of research and de-
velopment, therefore, h-as been to
lower the total cost of producing the
pure Water.

Many different items must be con-
sidered in an analysis of the cost to
produce desalinized water. There are
two main factors, however, which
must be considered when discussing
the total costs of a given process —
ﬁxed costs on -the investment and
energy or power costs. Since if one
tries to decrease the energy require-
mnt for a process, he will inevitably
increase the ﬁxed costs investment,
and vice versa, these two costs are

very closely related. Regardless of
which process is considered, there is
always a tendency toward a balance
of these two costs.

Through the government’s program,
the cost of fresh water puriﬁcation by
saline water conversion has dropped
to less than one—ﬁfth its 1952 price.
At present, the large million gallon
per day plants can deliver potable
water at a cost of about one dollar
per thousand gallons. When the pro-
gram reaches its expected efficiency,
it is thought that this price will be cut
in half or lower.

Table number.three illustrates the
cost of the processes described before
as compared to the cost of ordinary
fresh water.

When compared to costs between
two and ﬁve dollars ten years ago,
these values show that considerable
work has been done to reduce the cost
of desalinization. As fresh water be-
comes scarce and as more areas feel
the pinch of decreasing fresh water,
these costs can be and will be further
reduced.

It is very unlikely that one single

process will ever be developed that
will be superior to all other types of
salt water conversion at all locations.
There are many factors to be con-
sidered, such as whether the water
that is to be treated is brackish water
or sea water, the quantity of dissolved
salts present, the location of the plant,
weather conditions, waste disposal
coditions, and fuel costs. Some form
of distillation process, however, is to-

day the most widely used method, and If

it probably will be the most impor-
tant method for large scale sea water
conversion in the future.

In a speech to the American Chemi-
cal Society in 1960, the chief of the

Federal Office of Saline Water sum- '

med up the matter in this fashion:

The demonstration plant program
has captured the interest and imagi-
nation of the nation and the world,
but plant construction is not the key
to low-cost conversion. While these
plants are being constructed, the re-
search and development program will
be continued—for research is the key
to progress. One must turn to scienti-
ﬁc and technological research to de-
velop a new source of supply that can
provide an ever-growing percentage
of tomorrow's Water.

SOLDERING WITH INFRARED HEATING

by Bernard  Costello

Figure 1. Repairing soldered printed circuit connections using infrared heating.

OLDERING IS ONE or THE oldest
methods for joining metals still
in common use. There is evi-
dence that it was used by the Egyp-
tians during the period of pyramid
construction, over 5,000 years ago,
for attaching gold and copper appli-
que to sacred articles of bronze; and
more recently, 2,000 years ago, it was
used in the construction of utensils
and articles of jewelry in Pompeii.
Soldering has remained relatively
unchanged since ancient times. How-
ever, with the advent of modern elec-
tronic equipment and vastly more
stringent material and manufactur-
ing requirements, situations are now
being encountered in which tradi-
tional soldering techniques fail to sat-
isfy demands. The physical constitu-
tion of soldering materials has pre-
sented some difficulty; but functional

ABSTRACT

The application of concentrated infrared
heating systems to soldering is currently
being studied at the Western Electric Engi-
neering Research Center. In this article,
three applications, the repair of printed
circuits, the sealing of component enclosures
and the soldering of terminations to thin
ﬁlms, are discussed. In each case, infrared
heating is found to mfer advantages not
available with conventional heating meth-
ods, but certain disadvantages are also
noted. A brief description of the infrared
heating apparatus used in each application
is included in the report, as well as a dis-
cussion of the results obtained.

requirements and external controls
have posed the more difﬁcult prob-
lems.

Cleanliness and reliability are but

two areas where product speciﬁca-
tions are requiring near perfection.
Clean rooms and controlled atmos-
pheres, where impurities are speciﬁed
at less than one part per million, are
no longer unusual. Any work done
under such conditions must contrib-
ute essentially no contamination to
the environment or to the workpiece.
Soldering is no exception.

To further complicate the situation,
other considerations enter into the
picture. “Cost control,” and “yield
rate,” are common terms. A perfectly
controlled process is virtually worth-
less if it cannot compete economi-
cally. And, conversely, a cheaper
method may reduce product yield so
drastically as to be no longer cheap.
In soldering, as in all engineering
problems, a balance must be found
among many factors.

SOLDERING WITH
INFRARED HEATING

One aspect of the soldering process
that is of primary importance in the
manufacture of modern product is
the method used to apply heat. An
inexpensive, reliable, clean and read-
ily controllable method of heating is
desired. Investigations into the use of
infrared heating to satisfy these cri-
teria are currently being conducted
at the Western Electric Engineering
Research Center. Soldering is but one
phase of a program to apply infrared
heating to many types of industrial
heating problems. Three soldering
applications are of particular interest
because they illustrate not only the
advantages of infrared heating but
also the disadvantages that have been
encountered.

The ﬁrst application is concerned
with the soldering of printed circuits.
Among other desirable properties,
infrared is found to be capable of
soldering at temperatures signiﬁcant-
ly below those required by more con-
ventional heating methods. Thus,
thermal shock and the probability of
damage to thermally sensitive compo-
nents is reduced.

The second application involves
the soldering of component enclo-
sures. The particular problem deals
with the soldering of a composite
glass-metal cap at the open end of a
tubular metal capacitor can. Diﬂ’1-
culties arose with ordinary techniques
in soldering the cap without cracking
the glass insulator. Heating with in-
frared eliminated the glass cracks by
more evenly heating the cap. An ex-
cellent solder seal was the result.

The third application was devel-
oped at Bell Telephone Laboratories
utilizing equipment provided by the
Engineering Research Center. It was
concerned with the soldering of ter-
minations to thin ﬁlm circuits. The
problem not only involved simulta-
neously soldering several junctions

low soldering iron tip temperature.

but also, in some cases, required that
soldering be accomplished by heating
through the glass substrate. Excellent
results were reported with infrared
heating.

APPARATUS

Each of the three applications uses
fundamentally the same infrared heat-
ing system, with variations in the
geometry of the heat source and re-
ﬂectors} Quartz-iodine lamps, which
have been found to be very stable and
reliable over a wide range of temper-
atures are used as heat sources. The
lamps are simple to maintain and
commercially available.

The reflectors were designed at the
Engineering Research Center and
produced by a vendor. Many sizes
and shapes are available. The reﬂec—
tors are basically electroformed nick-
el, to provide strength and stability,
with electrodeposited gold on the re-
ﬂective surface. Gold is used for its
high reﬂectance in the infrared band
and also because it is sufﬁciently dur-
able to allow cleaning without dam-
age.

In general, the infrared heating
systems are simple and inexpensive.
Maintenance is normally conﬁned to
cleaning the reﬂectors or changing
burned out lamps. Line experience
indicates that the equipment will op-
erate a minimum of two weeks on a
two shift basis before maintenance is
necessary. Line operators and setup
men are easily trained and normally
attain high proﬁciency in a few hours.

1 For a more complete discussion of the infrared
heating systems developed at the Engineering
Research Center, see: B._]. COSTELLO. “Concen-
trated Radiant Energy,” The Western Electric
Engineer, VII, I (January, 1963), pp. 40-46.

HEAT TRANSFER

Radiative heat transfer is essentially
by electromagnetic waves. It is the
same type of wave motion as X—rays,
radio waves, or light waves, the only
difference being in the wave length
and energy per quanta of light. Most
of the energy available for heating is
in the infrared band. Hence, heating
by radiative transfer is commonly
called “infrared heating.”

In radiant heating, the total inci-
dent energy, I, falling on a body is
absorbed, A, reﬂected, R, or trans-
mitted, T:

I=A+R+T

0ri+£+1=1
I I I '

If, as in soldering, an opaque body is
involved,

T: 0.
And, if A and ~13 are deﬁned:
I I
A . .
T = a = absorptivity
R . .
T = p = reﬂectivity,
then
on + p = l.

Further, the energy absorbed, W,
by an opaque body at a given tem-
perature is related to the amount that
can be absorbed by a black body, WB,
at the same temperature by:

W: E WB,

where e = emissivity of the body.
But, a black body absorbs all the in-
cident energy. Therefore,

W3 = I, and by deﬁnition W= A.
Thus, it follows that:

Hence, the absorptivity, oz, which
may be thought of as an efficiency
factor in heating, can be determined
by ﬁnding either the emissivity or the
reﬂectivity of a material. However,
the emissivity is easier to determine
and is the property most often found
in the literature.

MATERIALS

In general, the emissivity of a solder-
ing material is a function of wave
length, temperature, alloy composi-
tion and surface condition. A typical
emissivity value for clean lead-tin
solders is approximately 0.08, which
is a relatively low value. However,
the low emissivity is more than offset
by the high radiant ﬂux density that
is available in concentrated infrared
and by the relatively low tempera-
tures required in soldering.

One of the most critical operating
parameters in infrared soldering, and
the one that contributes most to vari-
ations in emissivity (and therefore
process repeatability), is the surface
condition of the solder. As stated, the
emissivity of clean solder is approxi-
mately 0.08. However, emissivity may
vary from 0.18 due to a light oil ﬁlm
on the surface to as high as 0.6 for
very heavily oxidized solder. Hence,
strict control is necessary, not only
with respect to the solder preform
but also pre—tinned workpieces.

Surface uniformity is not diﬁicult
to control if a few precautions are
taken. Good uniformity is obtained
within a given lot when the solder pre-
forms are stored in a tight container
with a silica jell desicant and not al-
lowed to stand for more than 90 days
before using. Variations from lot to
lot may be compensated for by ad-

justing the heating power. In general,
if the solder appears clean and bright,
it is suitable for use in most cases. Al-
so, the components to be joined should
be as clean as the solder.

Other -preparation techniques, such
as ﬂuxing and tinning, are the same
as those used with any other heating
method, and piece part design criteria
are unchanged.

SOLDERING PRINTED CIRCUITS

An infrared heating system was de-
veloped at the Engineering Research
Center, at the request of North Caro-
lina Works engineers, to repair sol-
dered joints on printed circuits. The
apparatus is shown in Figure 1. Of
major importance in the printed cir-
cuit application is the effect of the
soldering temperature on the printed
wiring and on the component parts
that make up the circuit.

When soldering with an iron, the
tip temperature must be much higher
than the liquidus of the solder. For a
typical solder (60-40) the recom-
mended tip temperature is 360 to 370
degrees centigrade, while the liquidus
of thesolder is about 188 degrees cen-
tigrade. The large differential is nec-
essary to permit very rapid heating of
the solder without excessive cooling
in the tip. An undesirable effect of the
high tip temperature is that the cop-
per laminate on the boards and the
components may be subjected to ex-
cessive heat. In some cases the heat
may be so severe as to cause peeling
of the laminate or complete failure of
the component being soldered.

Another reason for the high tip

temperature is to prevent peaks on
the solder. If the iron is too cool, it
tends to raise a tip of metal that solid-
iﬁes before it can fall back onto the
land. A typical peak is shown in Fig-
ure 2. Peaking may cause short cir-
cuits on the board, or bridges between
boards in closely packed systems.
Infrared heating was expected to
reduce the required maximum work
temperature and also to eliminate
peaking problems. This was found to
be true in the tests at the Research
Center. With infrared heating, the
workpiece temperature is the prin-
cipal variable affecting the energy
transfer rate. But, since the source
temperature is considerably greater
than the workpiece temperature, the
effect of workpiece temperature as a
variable is negligible. Hence, the

energy transfer rate is essentially con-.

stant. By comparison, heat transfer
with a soldering iron depends on ‘tip

temperature and cross section of con-
tact, both of which vary. The tip
temperature varies with soldering
speed and operator skill, while the
cross section varies with the amount
of solder used and the wet area on
the soldering iron tip.

Temperature-time curves compar-
ing infrared heating and a typical
soldering iron are shown in Figure 3.
The lower temperature with the infra-
red system was made possible partly
by the fact that peaking is not a prob-
lem with infrared heating—nothing
touches the work—and partly due to
more precise control and more uni-
form heat transfer.

An enlarged cross section of an in-
frared solder joint is shown in Figure
4. The results shown are typical. The
joint area is well wetted, and no dam-
age to the board or residue in the
solder is apparent. The soldering op-
erations were accomplished in four

seconds at 70 per cent lamp power
with the arrangement of apparatus
shown in Figure 5.

One difﬁculty encountered with
the infrared system was a tendency of
the circuit board to burn if the center
of heat concentration was not on the
land area. Surface charring was noted
when the deviation exceeded one six-
teenth of an inch. Also, the solder
tended to run along the copper con-
ductors if the heat was applied for too
long a period. Both of these problems
were eliminated as the operator gained
proﬁciency.

An important consideration was
the relative size of the infrared unit.
Since the unit is much larger than a
soldering iron, it was decided, in this
case, to ﬁx its position and to mount
and manipulate the circuit board. As
would be expected, such a procedure
increased the time necessary for each
operation and, consequently, the cost
per operation. However, it is felt that
the cost would decrease with the de-
velopment of better work procedures.

SOLDERING ENCLOSURES

Another application investigated was

the soldering of component enclo-
sures. Electronic components, such as
capacitors and resistors, sometimes
require an hermetically sealed pack-
age to guard against the effects of
humidity in the atmosphere. The
sealed packages are often made by
soldering a plug in the end of a metal
can after inserting the component.
The soldering is usually accomplished
with radio frequency (RF) heating,
which involves a high capital invest-
ment in equipment and often involves
problems in operation. For these rea-
sons, the Engineering Research Cen-
ter was requested to study the feasi-
bility of using infrared heating to ac-
complish the task.

The enclosure selected for the study
is shown in Figure 6. The can is sol-
der plated copper (V; inch in diam-
eter x 1% inches long), and the end
seal is glass with metal overlays on
the areas to be soldered. The glass
acts as an insulator between the can
and the “feed-through” for the device
lead.

When a composite cap, such as this
one, is used, there is always a danger
of failure due to thermal stresses. The

stresses may be due to uneven heating
across the‘ part or to differential ther-
mal expansion between the materials.
With a glass-metal design, completely
uniform heating is, for practical pur-
poses, impossible. Therefore, the most
desirable approach is to heat the glass
at a slightly faster rate than the metal.
The glass will then expand against the
metal ring, placing the ring in tension
and the glass in compression, the state

thin ﬁlm circuit on glass substrate.

of stress in which each is strongest.

The opposite effect occurs with RF
heating; the metal portions are heated
by eddy currents and the glass by
conduction from the metal. Thus a
high thermal gradient is produced if
fast heating is required. This causes
the metal to expand, placing the glass
in tension and greatly increasing the
probability of glass cracks. Hot gas
and hot iron methods tend to heat
more uniformly; but, again, the en-
ergy is absorbed at the surface and
conducted to the interior.

The mechanism of infrared absorp-
tion is different. Energy absorption
occurs deep in the glass and at the
surface of the metal. Since the ther-
mal conductivity of the metal is much
higher than that of the glass, and
since the glass is simultaneously heated
from within, it would be expected
that the entire mass would heat at
nearly a uniform rate. The complete
absence of glass cracking in this case
supports such a conclusion.

The infrared heating equipment
used in the encapsulation study is
shown in Figure 7. The system uses
two semi-open reﬂectors with one 650
watt lamp in each. The workpiece is
continuously rotated to insure even
heating. The can is mounted on an
aluminum mandrel that also sup-
ports the end seal and a solder ring

  

preform. Rosin flux in alcohol is ap-
plied to the inside edge of the can and
to the end plug, and a light ﬂow of
nitrogen is directed on the heated
area to prevent excess oxidation. Heat
is applied for six seconds at 90 volts
while the spindle is rotated at 60 rev-
olutions per minute.

Several samples were sectioned to
inspect the bond. Typical results are
shown in Figure 8. The seal shows
good wetting over the entire area.
The exterior portion of the solder (see
Figure 6) shows a uniform ﬁllet and a
bright smooth surface.

The results indicate an excellent
seal. The fact that the interface angle
is small (approaching zero degrees)
and the disappearance of the tinned
surface between the solder and the
base metal indicate complete wetting.
The anchorage area is evidently ap-
proaching 100 per cent, as indicated
by the uniform solder-base metal in-
terface.

SOLDERING THIN
FILM CIRCUITRY

A soldering technique for application
to thin ﬁlms was developed at Bell
Telephone Laboratories by Mr. W.
G. Bader, using an infrared system
provided by the Engineering Re-
search Center. The objective was to
simultaneously solder twenty-nine

spring clips to a thin ﬁlm circuit on a
glass substrate. The task was accom-
plished in one operation and without
flux.

As shown in Figure 9, the area to
be soldered is a line of contact sur-
faces. The total length is about three
inches, while the contacts are approx-
imately 0.1 inch wide. The spring
clips bear on both sides of the glass
and in some cases must be soldered to
both sides.

In production, the clips are in-
serted in a base matrix (illustrated in
Figure 10. The thin ﬁlm circuits are
then inserted in sequence, starting at
one end of the matrix. Each circuit is
soldered in place before the next is
inserted, with the heating being done
in a nitrogen atmosphere.

Four heating methods were con-
sidered in preliminary investigations:
miniature soldering irons, resistance
heating, hot nitrogen, and hot liquid
rosin. All were rejected for various
reasons. Concentrated infrared was
ﬁnally chosen because it is rapid, non-
contaminating and is least likely to
damage the glass plates or compo-
nents.

One of the unique advantages of
infrared in this application is its ab-
sorption mechanism. As stated, some
of the clips must be soldered on both
sides of the substrate. After insertion
in the base insuﬂicient clearance re-
mains between boards to permit con-
venient access for heating. The clear-
ance problem is overcome with in-
frared heating because energy passing
through the glass is absorbed by the
contacts on the opposite side.

The infrared apparatus is shown in
Figure 11. The reﬂector is elliptical—
cylindrical in shape, and a 500 watt
“long line” lamp is used. The work
is held under the lamp as shown in
Figure 12. In this position the lamp
image can be placed anywhere in the
work zone without interference.

Excellent results were obtained by
Bell Telephone Laboratories in the
investigation. Further work with thin
ﬁlms is currently in progress at the
Engineering Research Center to in-
vestigate lead soldering to any area
on a thin ﬁlm.

SUMMARY

Although based on laboratory inves-
tigations, the three soldering applica-
tions clearly demonstrate the feasi-
bility of using infrared heating for
soldering operations. In general, the
experience indicates that infrared
heating is easy to mechanize, eco-
nomical with respect to initial invest-
ment and consistent in operation.
Some of the advantages noted in-
clude: complete absence of contami-
nation, negligible force exerted on
the workpiece, excellent control of
temperature, good deﬁnition of area

heated, ability to apply heat in any
atmosphere or remotely (as through
the glass substrate in the thin ﬁlm ap-
plication), and the ability to heat
glass-metal composites with mini-
mum thermal stresses. Based upon
the results, it is felt that infrared heat-
ing provides a valuable addition to
the manufacturing engineers reper-
tory of soldering techniques.

The ﬁrst publicly announced production-oriented module section of a
Water-cooled, nu'clear-{thermionic power plant has been jointly developed
and successfully demonstrated by the Babcock and Wilcox Company and
the Radio Corporation of America.

A t'hermionic converter, the “heart” of the development, was designed
and built by RCA at its Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant. It was placed in
operation in the swimming pool test reactor at the Babcock and Wilcox
Nuclear Development Center at Lynchburg, Virginia, on January 15. The
converter delivered power continuously throughout the 305—hour test.

Fission fragment heating from the fuel pellets was used to supply the
heat necessary to maintain the cesium reservoir at operating temperatures.
By t-h-is means no external electrical power was required.

A unique “spiral machining” process has been developed at Hanford ’ 
Laboratorits to produce plutonium~aluminum test reactor fuel disks. Su-ch ,, ,1;
disks are essential to the development of plutonium fuel, utilizing a mixture 
of plutonium isotopes, to achieve long, uniform power generation. V

Fabrication of some 9000 disks was accomplished by the new machining
method for approximately one—fourth the cost of conventional techniques,
resulting in an actual savings on one job of $75,000. Additionally, the new
process will hasten completion of the job by some three to six months.

The disks contain three different plutonium isotopic compositions
varying from eight to 27 percent plutonium-24:0. This high burn up pluto-
nium (resulting from long exposure in a reactor) is scarce and it was
necessary to ust a ﬂexible fuel design which would yield the most physics
data possible. The thin wafers may be used singly, in stacks, or interspaced
with moderating materials to stimulate a wide range of fuel and moderator
combinations.

A complete closed-circuit television camera system smaller than a shoe
box and employing fully transistorized circuitry is announced by Du Mont
Laboratories, division of F-airchild Camera and Instrument Corporat-ion.

Horizontal resolution of 700 lines, and high s=ignal-to—noise ratio help

to produce sharp, bright pictures at light levels as low as 10 foot-candles
scene illumination. Useful pictures can be obtained wit-h scene illumina-
tions as low as ‘1 foot. The camera system may be fed directly to a
conventional TV receiver. An additional output provides for inter-connec-
tion with -any high resolution monitor. Input power required is 117 volts,
60 CPS, 10 Watts.
1 Other outstanding features of this extremely small camera system are
' externa-1 mechanical focus adjustment, au~tom.ati-c light compensation, ran-
dom interlaced display, printed wire circuits, and beam alignment magnets.
The camera will list at $899.00.

W-hen college laboratory experiments create noise louder than that
coming from the football stadium on a Saturday afternoon, something
has to be done about it.

San Jose State College has met that problem in its Department of
3 Aeronautics where future aero engineers gain operational experience wit-h
\. engines more powerful than those of large passenger airliners today.

Just completed there is an aeronatutical test facility with cells for both
‘ jet and reciprocating engines. The cell is a prefabricated metal structure
4 « consisting of a jet cell, reciprocating engine cell, and control room. Sound
suppression in the jet engine portion of the cell begins at the intake where
 special Soundmetal panels allow air to be drawn in, but deter noise from
4,, backing out. Inside the cell, the engine is mounted on a thrust bed sus-
‘ pended from an overhead stand. Directly behind the engine exhaust, a
‘F V- Water-cooled diffuser, which breaks up the hot gases, is centered in a
V augmenter chamber which mixes fresh air with the gases.
. Beyond this are curved steel plates which further break up the gas
1"" blast and turn it upward where it exhausts through sound—a'b-sorbing panels
which allow free passage of air. Noise outside the cell is no greater than
that created by traffic on a nearby freeway.

Profile of An

Engineering Career

Over-simpliﬁed though it may be-, the graphical repre-
sentation of a successful career that is shown here will
illustrate certain elements that are common to the pat-
tern of success in any walk o-f life. Like ﬁngerprints, the
shape of the curve will never be the same for any two
individuals,but the three phases of development and the
forces and factors that inﬂuence the slopes, breakpoints,
maxima and ranges of the curve are common to all.

Phase I of the curve obviously represents the training
and internship period, which in large measure determines
the course of progress that is to follow. This includes the
academic preparation, which documents the beginning of
the professional biography that is to ensue. It also in-
cludes the early years of practice, in which habits are
formed, abilities are tested and proved, shortcomings
evaluated, and inital recognition acquired.

The signiﬁcant breakpoint that marks the onset of
Phase II represents that point in time at which the
maturing talents of the neophyte begin to be recognized.
Now new and greater responsibility is entrusted to him,
and the acceleration and ultimate height of his progress
are deﬁned by the manner in which these responsibilities
are met. Here the “men are separated from the boys,”
and the quality of the preparation made in Phase I is
measured by results.

Phase III portrays that happy season which follows
achievement of substantial advancement, where the chal-
lenge is greater and the competition keenest. The rate of
progress slows, but nevertheless continues into, and often
through, the “retirement” years. This, too, is the season

of greatest reward, both economically and in personal
satisfaction, for by now there are tangible accomplish-
ments that bring personal recognition and a sense of pride.

The tone scheme used in the chart is also signiﬁcant,

with those early drab years of study, discipline, and mun-.

dane toil eventually giving way to the fair weather days
of rapid advancement and ever-brightening future.
Phase III represents the hue seen through the rose-colored
glasses with which one might view his goals and ambi-
tions. Ironically, to the veteran looking back, those early
days of youthful struggle may usually seem to have been
the rosiest of all!

To my mind the “proﬁle of success” as charted can
apply to any vocation or profession, with the same con-

trolling factors and inﬂuences. We are concerned here,‘

however, with a profession, and it is apropos that a
fundamental deﬁnition be given at this point.

Roscoe Pound, former Dean of the Harvard Law
School, admirably deﬁnes a profession as the pursuit of a
learned art in a spirit of service. Note the two essential
elements - - - the “learned art” and the “spirit of service.”
Both are indispensable, and they must be manifest for
the entire duration of a truly professional career.

My ﬁrst intent in the development of these remarks
was to discus the importance of personal attitude to all
three phases of the successful engineering career. Upon
checking with the young men in the ASCE staﬁ’, however,
I was informed in no uncertain terms that the young
engineer is concerned with his status NOW, and not with
generalities of his future. In deference to this advice, my

discussion will be conﬁned to Phase I — - - the internship
stage — — — although there may be an occasional suggestion
that our aspiring young candidate for fame and glory
should think and glance ahead once in a while!

Getting right down to basics, there are two raw mate-
rials that must be developed in the individual to prepare
him for a useful and rewarding life. They are, ﬁrs-t, In-
herent Ability and, second, Attitude. Except to point out
that the gifts and talents with which one is naturally
bestowed can only be developed in the climate of a proper
mental attitude, I shall not allude further to the personal
abilities and capacities of the individual. Our primary
concern here is the attitude of the individual - — - and
speciﬁcally - — - the attitude that will best further “the
pursuit of a learned art in a spirit of service.”

Elements of the Professional Attitude

Were it possible to apply the techniques of the chemist
to the formulation of the pro-fessional attitude it is
suggested that the four essential elements would be
(1) Motivation, (2) Discipline,  Participation and
(4) .Enthusiasm. All of these, in their proper proportion
and relationship to each other, impart vital properties to
the ﬁnished compound.

Motivation

Deﬁnition of objectives is certainly the ﬁrst step in
planning any project. The “Progress” that is plotted as
the ordinate of the career chart is a composite of:

a) The ﬁnancial return that makes possible the com-

fort and security of our families, and even a bit of

luxury if things go well,

b) The personal satisfaction that comes with the

knowledge that one is contributing signiﬁcantly to the

world about him - — - that his life is constructively
meaningful to his fellow man, and

c) The recognition by one’s associates and others that

he is a competent artisan — - — that his works are

well-founded and well—made.

The secular rewards of ﬁnancial status and prestige
require no elucidation, for they are obviously direct
measures of successful progress. As the years pass, how-
ever, the sense of contribution to a better world will be
all the more cherished. The emphasis moves to the “spirit
of service” that is one of the two requirements in Dean
Pound’s deﬁnition of a profession.

The service motive, then, is a prime requisite to the
professional attitude. It must be accepted and given a
high order of value in the early years of the career, in
order to inspire the dedication of purpose that is always
manifest in those who have achieved real and true success
in their chosen ﬁelds.

Discihaline

It takes initiative and self—control for one to evaluate
his weaknesses and shortcomings, and it also takes deter-
mination to do something about their correction. No
matter how extensive his academic training, a young
engineer soon ﬁnds that there are great gaps in his fund
of knowledge. He learns quickly that technology is not
static, and that new developments will pass him by if he
does not keep apace through self-education.

The discipline to apply one’s time and energy to
maintain his learned art and to pursue it with diligence
and determination must be developed early in the success-
ful career. Once the discipline is acquired, effective study

Participation

More than knowledge alone, of course, is needed to
build a career. In any profession it is necessary to be
able to approach and meet associates and the public, to
communicate with them, to work harmoniously with
them, and even to manage them under the proper cir-
cumstances. It is important, then, to begin early to
establish one’s identity in his profession, and to contribute
to it Where possible. Through such contributions one will
make valuable contacts, make known his abilities, and
apprise those who might use his services of his willingness
and capacity to handle greater responsibility.

For the aspiring young civil engineer the facilities of
ASCE are invaluable as a framework for participation in
his profession. He can begin in the student chapter to
make himself known, and to give of himself for the beneﬁt
of the group. After leaving school he can make himself
available for activity in the Younger Member ‘Forum or
in the Local Section, as a prelude to service at higher
levels as he becomes known. Not only does he keep up
with advancing technology through the technical con-
ferences and publications of the Society, but also does he
contribute of his own knowledge and experience to the
progress of the art through committee activity and by
preparing papers for presentation and publication.

Participation in community functions and public
affairs is also a facet of professional life, in which most
opportunities come after the career is well launched. There
should be a readiness to accept these opportunities to
serve, whenever they may come, and humble though
they may be.

It should be noted that the kind of participation en-
couraged here is predicated more on contributing than on
receiving. Here again the service motive ﬁnds effect in
the attainment of the professional identiﬁcation, contacts
and reputation that guide the way to success.

It is a coincidence that the membership grades of
ASCE are compatible with the three stages of career
development in the chart. Associate membership covers
the preparation or proving period which leads to the grade
of Member when full professional status is achieved. The
recognition grade of Fellow is earned by superior per-
formance and noteworthy professional accomplishment
as a successful practitioner.

Enthusiasm
Some complex chemical reactions require a catalyst,
which is a substance that furthers the reaction without
itself being consumed. The catalyst in the formulation of
professional attitude is ENTHUSIASM - - - that magic
quality Without which nothing really Worth while can be
achieved. Roger Adams, a famous scientist h.as this to
say about the importance of enthusiasm for one’s job:
“There is nothing more important to a man than
to select for his life’s Work some line with which he is
entirely happy, because then, regardless of his ability

35

Progress

..: 

PROFILE OF A SUCCESSFUL CAREER

and ﬁn.al attainments, he is likely to advance further
than otherwise. Contentment with one’s vocational
activities is a foundation that enables a man to build
upon it a superstructure that may tower above original
expectations. Enjoyment in daily work should be the
main pleasure in life, and ninety per cent of a man’s
compensation. This is the most important factor in
the future happiness and success of an individual.”
If I had the power to bestow just one gift upon every
graduating civil engineering student, it would be their
inculation with a generous, wholesome enthusiasm for his
chosen career. And to the young practitioner who is not
driven to his best effort by a continuing flow of enthusi-
asm I would urge that he change his calling without delay.
There are many slogans and cliches about this miracu-
lous stimulator of human production. Just in case some
of you feel that this dissertation is somewhat too philo-
sophical, however, I will cite only the claim that “Enthu-
siasm in the yeast raises the dough” to make my point
here.
Professional Attitude Deﬁned
Professional attitude, then, might be deﬁned as a com-
bination of personal motivation, discipline and participa-
tion, activated by an enthusiastic desire to render
constructive service. It is the powerful force that brings
about the greatest possible utilization of the natural talent
and ability that is available in the individual. It con-
stitutes the difference between the engineer and the truly
“professional” engineer.

36

Some Speciﬁc Phase I Situations

One of my young consultants in the ASCE staff thought
that the students would want to know “What they should
do next?” In an effort to comply with this diﬁicult charge
I have selected several typical situations that might be
encountered in the Phase I internship period.

Selecting the First Job

To the graduating student the prospect of a steady
income becomes very attractive. The size of that pay
check is important, to be sure, but it is by no means
a.ll—important. Moreover, there are some factors other
than geographical location and fringe beneﬁts that merit
careful evaluation in the selection of that ﬁrst job. Among
these are:

1. Reputation and standing of the potential employer.

2. Character and scope of experience that can be

anticipated.

3. Range of responsibility and opportunity for

advancement.

4.«. Professional reputation and standing of one’s Work-

ing associates and superiors.

5. Availability of facilities for graduate education,

special courses, etc.

A job that will yield broad experience in the area of
specialty interest, with training under men of recognized
competence and stature, with opportunity to assume con-
tinually greater responsibility, and with convenient out-
side educational facilities could well provide a bet-ter
foundation for a career than another offering a higher

SK YSORAPER ENGINEER

‘  ”‘

\,,‘.:“"\.—.—w,=- I,\*"'~.  \.‘~"" \\“"

salary in a vacation climate.

It is relevant here to refer back to Dr. Adams’ observa-
tion that one will do best and go farthest in work that he
thoroughly enjoys. There should be no hesitancy to change
jobs, within reason, if there is real advancement as
measured by criteria other than salary and fringe beneﬁts.
And above all, the job that generates genuine pride and
enthusiasm should be prized as a treasure.

Professional Identiﬁcation

Mention has already been made of the importance of
ASCE membership as a means of professional identiﬁca-
tion and as a vehicle for participation in technical and
professional activities. The civil engineers most lkely to
succeed will be found among the 52,000 members of the
Society.

Early in the career a decision will also have to be
made as to legal registration under the state laws. Regis-
tration is not mandatory for certain kinds of practice, and
it usually requires passage of a written examination
together with several years of approved experience.

It is signiﬁcant that four of every six members of
ASCE are voluntarily registered, and another one of every
six is an Engineer-in-Training. Every embryonic civil en-
gineer today should act to become registered at the very
earliest time, both for the professional identiﬁcation that
results and to satisfy this requirement whenever it may
arise in a future assignment or engagement. The registra-
tion examinations are easiest when they are taken soon
after graduation. Do not procrastinate in this important
step!

To Moonlight or Not/to Moonlight

More than once during his Phase I internship the
young engineer will be offered the opportunity to pick up
some extra income by work outside of his regular job.
Such “moonlighting” is not ethically improper if it is
done with the knowledge and consent of the primary
employer, and if there is no conﬂict of interest. It may
even in some cases be highly education.al and broadening
in the technical experience gained.

In general, however, the temptation to earn additional
income through outside employment should be carefully
weighed. Would this same time be more beneﬁcally used
for the long haul if it were devoted to formal education
toward a graduate degree? Or toward the establishment
of professional identiﬁcation and stature by contributing
to technical committees, meetings and publications? Or
toward broadening one’s acquaintanceship and personal
contacts through professional activity?

The moonlighting job might slightly enhance the rate
of progress in Phase I of the career chart, but at the risk
of jeopardizing the full potential that might be realized
in the later stages of the career.

This desicion is an important one.

The Call of the Union

The trade unions today are striving mightily to re-
cover the losses from their ranks as a result of automa-
tion. They are directing powerful efforts toward the

exploitation of union membership among technical em-
ployees in the white collar group, including all branches
of engineering.

We have no quarrel with trade unions for the manual
crafts and skills, but their objectives, policies and methods
are just not compatible with the intent of the professional
to “pursue his learned art in a spirit of service.” Such
incompatibility is considered to exist by a rousing majority
of 76% of the members of ASCE!

Paraphrasing Dean Pound’s deﬁnition to apply to the
unionized trade or craft we might say that it is “the pur-
suit of any art for everything that one can get out of it.”
The important professional element sof learning and of
unselﬁsh service are notably absent.

Only 2.4% of ASCE members are presently affiiliated
with any collective bargaining unit, many of them unwill-
ingly. There are plenty of jobs available that do not
require such membership.

True, union membership might increase slightly the
slope of the progress line in Phase I of the career chart.
It is, however, a poor investment for the future, and the
same slope would be exjected to continue indefinitely,
inﬂuenced only seniority and by the aggressiveness of the
union leadership.

Such a dismal prospect can hardly be termed a
professional career at all!

Summaxry and Conclusion

My premise here can be summarized in Space Age
terminology. Imagine Phase I in the career chart as the
launching pad, where the rocket and its scientiﬁc payload
are carefully prepared in every possible detail that can be
anticipated. At the end of Phase I comes the blast-off,
when the missile takes off with accelerating velocity,
eventually to go into the Phase III orbit at a time and
place determined by the power of the boos-ter rocket.

Vital to the success of the ﬂight is the eﬂiciency of the
propellant fuel. I consider Professional Attitude to be the
propellant that prescribes the course of the ﬂight to Suc-
cess. If the rocket engine has been tuned to its best, the
fuel compounded of the elements of Motivation, Dis-
cipline, Participation and Enthusiasm in their proper pro-
portions, all ready and waiting for the count—down on the
day of opportunity to meet greater responsibility - - -
then, truly, the sky will be the limit!

Just one more thought, which may afford needed in-
spiration on come especially difficult day in your own
experience, when you may wonder if the end is really
worth the means to it. A young Catholic priest — - -
himself educated as an engineer - - - used these words in
his luncheon invocation at the San Francisco Annual
Meeting of ASCE in 1963. He said:

“As engineers, we take the materials and forces of

nature and study them, and shape them, and apply

them to the needs of men. This is truly sacred work!”
In all my 36 years of contact with engineers and en-
gineering I have never heard a better expression of the
Professional Attitude.

Why become an engineer at
Garrett-AiResearch? You’ll have to

work harder and use more of

your knowledge than engineers

at most other companies.

If you’re our kind of engineer,
you have some very deﬁnite ideas
about your career.

For example:

You’ve worked hard to get a
good education. Now you want to
put it to work in the best way
possible. I

You will never be satisﬁed with
run-of-the-mill assignments. You

demand exciting, ; ' _

  

challenging projects.
You not only accept
individual responsibil-
ity — you insist upon it. __
Does that sound like '
you? Then AiResearch A _
is your cup of tea. ‘
Our business is
mainly in sophisticated aerospace
systems and subsystems.
Here, research, design, and de-
velopment lead to production of

actual hardware.
That means you
have the oppor-
tunity to start with
a customer’s problem
and see it through to a
system that will get the job done.
The product lines at AiResearch,
Los Angeles Division, are environ-
mental systems, ﬂight information
 - A and controls sys-
tems, heat transfer
systems, secondary
power generator
A systems for missiles
and space, electri-
cal systems, and
specialized indus-
trial systems.
In the Phoenix Division there are
gas turbines for propulsion and
secondary power, valves and con-
trol systems, air turbine starters
and motors, solar and. nuclear
power systems.
_In each category AiResearch
employs three kinds of engineers.
Preliminary design engineers do
the analytical and theoretical
work, then write proposals.
Design engineers do the lay-
outs; turn an idea into a product.
Developmental engineers are
responsible for making hardware
out of concepts.
Whichever ﬁeld ﬁts you best, we
can guarantee you this: you can
go as far and fast as your talents

 
  
  
 
 
  

can carry you. You can make as
much money as any engineer in a
comparable spot — anywhere. And
of course, at AiResearch, you’ll
get all the plus beneﬁts a top com-
pany offers.

Our engineering staff is smaller
than comparable companies. This
spells opportunity. It gives a man
who wants to make a mark plenty
of elbow room to expand. And
while he’s doing it he’s working
with, and learning from, some of
the real pros in the ﬁeld.

If the AiResearch story sounds
like opportunity speaking to you-
don’t fail to contact AiResearch,

Want to join them?

Take the masked man on the left, for instance.
He’s actually a pharmacologist on the job in one
of our Squibb Division labs, testing out some pun-
gent material behind a sniff-proof mask. Take a
job with us doing biochemical research and you’ll
join him. You might even be him; behind those
masks, who can tell?

The man in the middle? He’s Nai Charden, a
loyal, worthy and trusty fertilizer tester for our
International Division. He works in the rice pad-
dies around Nongkam (Thailand), helping Olin
men check out the effectiveness of various grades
of Ammo-Phos® fertilizer.

And then there’s Casper. (One of our Winches-
ter boys gave him the name during the last 20
seconds of his [Casper’s] life.) Casper is (was)
on the job for Olin, too, although he wasn’t actually
on the payroll. Unwittingly, he helped an Olin team
in darkest Africa to test out the new line of sporting
arms from our Winchester-Westem Division.

Sounds interesting?

Well, there’s a hedge, of course.

We can’t promise, for example, that the minute
you’re off campus you’ll be on safari. And we’re not
saying you’ll walk out of your dorms and into
the jungle.

What we are offering is a unique chance to pick
your career out of an incredibly wide spectrum
of opportunities in specialized ﬁelds: engineering,

science, liberal arts, business administration—you
name it.

And we are deﬁnitely offering you a chance to
train and work with some of the sharpest people in
your ﬁeld (native scouts and target lions notwith-
standing). You will pick up right where you leave
off at graduation and, with crack specialists, start
probing the intricacies of your special area. Most
important, you will learn by doing. (At Olin, a guy
is always learning because he is always doing,
always looking for new ways to do new things.
Which is one way of saying theresno end of op-
portunity at Olin.)

Interesting people are on the job for Olin, all over
the world. And they’re doing interesting things.

Want to join them?

There’s no hedge on this score; no gimmick,
either.

In fact, all you have to do is get in touch with
Mr. M. H. Jacoby (he’s our College Relations
Officer) at Olin, 460 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y.
1 002 2. He’ll answer any questions you might have,
and if he can’t answer them he’ll send you to the
fellow who can. And if you’ve got a healthy curi-
osity (and what graduate worth his salt hasn’t?)
you’ll ﬁnd that’s just the beginning.

Start out talking to Mr. J acoby and there’s no
telling where you’ll wind up. (You may have shoul-
dered a .22, but we’ll give odds I‘ .
you’ve never wielded a machete.)

“The development
of management
is essential

to our goal of
great growth”

An equal opportunity employer

* \1
At the 1964 stockholders‘ meeting, Arjay Miller, J’
President of Ford Motor Company, emphasized the _”
Company's far-sighted recruitment program and its accent
on developing management talent: M’
“One aspect of our planning is crucial to the success of "-*-~

everything else we do. It engages the best thoughts and efforts of
our whole management team, from top to bottom, throughout the
world. I am speaking of the development of management. The 
immediate future of our Company depends heavily upon the abilities
of the people who are now key members of our management team.

‘‘In the longer run, our future depends on what we are doing at ’ ‘
the present time to attract and develop the people who will

be making the major decisions 10 to 20 years from now. We are
developing management competence in depth in order to attack the
problems that will confront a company of great growth—and

great growth (both in proﬁts and sales) is exactly the goal

we have established for Ford Motor Company. --~.,

“We are continuing to emphasize recruiting. Last spring, 180 of our gs-« ~
management people devoted part of their time to recruiting
outstanding graduates from colleges and universities throughout
the U.S. Last year, these efforts resulted in our hiring over .,
1,000 graduates, 220 more than the year before.

“We are seeking and we are ﬁnding young men—and young women,
too-with brains and backbone—people who have the ability and -" "‘
the desire to make room for themselves at the top. We give our

trainees challenging assignments with as much responsibility as

they can carry. We promote them as fast as they are ready. Those ‘>
who are interested in easy security soon drop out. Those who
have what we want stay with us, and move up quickly to increased
responsibility and the pay that goes with it. Thanks to the quality “ ‘
of the people we are recruiting and developing, I am ﬁrmly

convinced that our outlook is most promising."

Deﬁnition

An Engineer is one who passes as an exacting expert on
the strength of being able to turn out, with proliﬁc for-
titute strings of incomprehensible formulae calculated
with micromatic precision from extremely vague assump-
tions which are bas-ed on debatable ﬁgures acquired from
inconclusive tests and quite incomplete experiments
carried out with instruments of problematic accuracy by
persons of doubtful reliability and rather dubious
mentality.

“Let’s have a game of riddles to pass the time,’ said
the professor, “If I have a riddle that you can’t guess
you give me a dollar or vice versa.”

“All right,” replied the farmer. “But since you are
better educated than I am, do you mind if I give you
only ﬁfty cents?”

“OK,” replied the professor. “You go ﬁrst.”

“Well, who said, ‘Two spiders may be mad at each
other, but they could still step on a third spider.’ ”

“I don’t know. Here’s your dollar. What’s the

The man who created the sculpture shown above
started his career as a tool and die-maker. The
disciplines he learned in that exacting profession,
coupled with his creative imagination, give his
work the technical perfection and design vigor
that have made him one of the world’s most
sought-after architectural sculptors.

Imagination and scientific discipline, when
simultaneously applied, can yield spectacular
results. In art. In science. In careers.

This cliché can be interpreted two ways.

The literal way-“Line spread function” mathe-
matizes certain aspects of image structure in

shelter behind academic ivy long enough to get
that deep into other men’s games. If, for example,
we need mechanical engineers capable of com-
municating with our optical physicists for a
common purpose—and we have such purposes in
our little-known but heavy aerospace commit-
ments—we had better provide the right fertilizer
for ivy ourselves. So we do. Some of the more

The hard-boiled way—The nice part about
being an engineer here is that a man can ﬁnd a
level of sophistication to suit his interests even
without risking the shifting sands of internation-
al policy. We are plainly, frankly, proudly, and
gloriously commercial. We need men to whom to
teach the technical subtleties of making money
from satisfying the everyday needs of people and
of business. When done properly, it can be as
challenging to the intellect as the work of the

Advancement in a Big Company:

 

 

'C. K. Rieger

I Charles K. Rieger joined General Elec-
tric’s Technical Marketing Program after
earning a BSEE at the University of Mis-
souri in 1936. Following sales engineering
assignments in motor, defense and home
laundry operations, he became manager of
the Heating Device and Fan Division in
1947. Other Consumer-industry management
positions followed. In 1953 he was elected
a vice president, one of the youngest men
ever named a Company officer. Mr. Rieger
became Vice President, Marketing Services
in 1959 and was appointed to his present
position in 1961. He is responsible for all
the operations of some six divisions com-
posed of 23 product operations oriented
primarily toward the Electric Utility market.

Q. How can I be sure of getting the
recognition I feel I’m capable of earn-
ing in a big company like G.E.?

A. We learned long ago we couldn’t
afford to let capable people get lost.
That was one of the reasons why G.E.
was decentralized into more than a
hundred autonomous operating de-
partments. These operations develop,
engineer, manufacture and market
products much as if they were inde-

How it Works

pendent companies. Since each de-
partment is responsible for its own
success, each man’s share of author-
ity and responsibility is pinpointed.
Believe me, outstanding performance
is recognized, and rewarded.

Q. Can you tell me what the “promo-
tional ladder” is at General Electric?

A. We regard each man individually.
Whether you join us on a training
program or are placed in a specific
position opening, you’ll first have to
prove your ability to handle a job.
Once you’ve done that, you’ll be given
more responsibility, more difficult
projects—work that’s important to
the success of your organization and
your personal development. Your abil-
ity will create a “promotional ladder’’
of your own.

Q. Will my development be confined
to whatever department I start in?

A. Not at all! Here's where “big com-
pany” scope works to broaden your
career outlook. Industry, and General
Electric particularly, is constantly
changing—adapting to market the
fruits of research, reorganizing to
maintain proper alignment with our
customers, creating new operations
to handle large projects. All this rep-
resents opportunity beyond the limits
of any single department.

An Interview with General E|ectric’s C. K. Rieger,Vice President and Group Executive, Electric Utility Group

Q. Yes, but just how often do these
opportunities arise?

A. To give you some idea, 25 percent
of G-E’s gross sales last year came
from products that were unknown
only five or ten years ago. These new
products range from electric tooth
brushes and silicone rubber com-
pounds to atomic reactors and inter-
planetary space probes. This chang-
ing Company needs men with ambi-
tion and energy and talent who aren't
afraid of a big job—who welcome the
challenge of helping to start new
businesses like these. Demonstrate
your abi|ity——whether to handle com-
plex technical problems or to manage
people, and you won't have long to
wait for opportunities to fit your
needs.

Q. How does General Electric help
me prepare myself for advancement
opportunity?

A. Programs in Engineering, Manu-
facturing or Technical Marketing give
you valuable on-the-job training. We
have Company-conducted courses to
improve your professional ability no
matter whereyou begin. Under Tui-
tion Refund or Advanced Degree Pro-
grams you can continue your formal
education. Throughout your career
with General Electric you’ll receive
frequent appraisals to help your self-
development. Your advancement will
be largely up to you.
