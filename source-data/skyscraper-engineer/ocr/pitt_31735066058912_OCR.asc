            Of all the knowledge gained from the satellite era,
         the discovery of lethal belts of high energy radiation out-
         side the earth's atmosphere was the most startling. As
         a result of this discovery, plans for space exploration by
         humans have had to be re-evaluated and new schemes
         invented. The dangers inherent in traversing these belts
         are not yet fully understood, but our present knowledge
         of the Van Allen belts is infinitely greater than it was
         just five years ago.
             The existence of higher radiation levels in the upper
         atmosphere than was previously expected was first ob-
         served in 1952 and 1953. During this time, rocket ex-
         plorations were being made by members of the State
         University of Iowa in the Arctic and Hudson Bay re-
         gions. Most of the results of the flights were in accord
         with previous expectations, but two test rockets fired in
4        1953 caused a puzzle. Beginning at a height of 30 miles,
         the rockets encountered a zone of radiation that was
         much stronger than expected. Since the rockets were
         fired in the auroral zone, it was thought that the in-
         creased radiation was due to particles emanating from
         the sun and causing auroral displays. But the increased
         radiation was not found in the area of the geo-magnetic
         poles where previous hypothesis had stated the charged
         particles from the sun should be concentrated.
             A fuller investigation of the auroral radiation had
         to wait until plans were made to launch an earth satel-
         lite during the International Geophysical Year. After the
         president authorized the project, plans were made to use
         the satellite to investigate cosmic-ray intensities in the
         satellite's orbit. Suitable apparatus was designed for use
         on one of the early Vanguard satellites.
             However, after repeated failures of the Vanguard
        satellite, Explorer I was launched on January 31, 1958,
        with a simple cosmic-ray detector and a radio to report
        its readings. At first, the reports were exactly as ex-
        pected but after several weeks, some of the readings be-
        gan to show an odd reoccurrence. At high altitudes over
        the equatorial region, the counting rate was low and at
        times dropped to zero. Initially it was thought that
        either the instruments were malfunctioning or that cos-
        mic rays were not striking the upper atmosphere over
        the equator. Neither surmise was felt to be reasonable.
             The Explorer III satellite was next put into orbit
        carrying a magnetic-tape recorder to fire a burst of
        cosmic-ray readings as it passed over receiving stations.
        The counting rates confirmed the earlier data from Ex-
        plorer I. At 200 to 300 mile altitudes, the counting rate
        was low, but when the satellite went out to 500 and 600
        miles, the counting rate would increase rapidly and then
        drop to zero. Finally, a member of Van Allen's group,
        McIlwain, suggested that perhaps a very high level of
        radiation was jamming the counter and making it ap-
        pear that no radiation existed in certain areas. Further
        evaluation of the data showed that up to the jamming
        point, the counter would record radiations up to 1000
        times more powerful than previously thought to exist in
        the upper atmosphere.
            By May 1, 1958, Van Allen's group was ready to re-
        port to the Natural Academy of Science and the Ameri-


can Physical Society that Explorer I and III had dis-
covered a great intensity of radiation above altitudes of
500 miles over a range 34 degress north and south of the
equator. Furthermore, they also presented the theory
that the charged particles responsible for the radiation
had been trapped by the magnetic field of the earth.
     Norwegian Physicist Earl Stormer had suggested 50
years ago that the earth's magnetic field might act as
a trap for charged particles. Using Stormer's theoretical
discussion and the satellite observations, the idea was
evolved that when a fast-moving charged particle is in-
jected into the earth's magnetic field, it describes a cork-
screw   shaped  trajectory along a magnetic line of
force. The turns were thought to be loose over the
equator and tighter as the particles passed over the
magnetic poles. The particles are then thought to pass
over to the next hemisphere with the same spinning
trajectory. As the particles travel, they slowly drift
around the world with the electrons drifting from west
to east and the protons drifting east to west. The par-
ticles pass closer to the earth over the poles and col-
lisions with atmospheric gases eventually cause them to
lose enough energy to be caught in the lower atmos-
phere.
     To really test this theory about the high radiation
belts, new instrumentation was built which would give
accurate counts in very high radiation densities. One
counter used a smaller Geiger tube whose count was
scaled down by a large factor. Another Geiger tube was
shielded with lead to check the penetrability of the rad-
iation. A discriminating detector was built that would
only respond to electrons with an energy of 650,000
volts and to protons of more than 10,000,000 volts. A
thin cesium-iodide detector, sensitive from .1 erg to
100,000 ergs per second, was built to give a reading of
the overall energy input of the radiation rather than the
actual particle count. The Explorer IV sataellite carried
these instruments into orbit on July 26, 1958. The more
than 3600 recorded passes of the satellite confirmed the
early estimates of radiation levels and also extended the
explored region to more than 50 degrees north and south
of the equator and to a height of 1300 miles.
     From the preceding satellite observation, it was
possible to begin determining the size and extent of
the radiation belts. The shape of the belts seemed to'
follow that of the earth above the equatorial regions.
As the belts reached the northern and southern latitudes,
however, they swung inward and then outward to form a
bulge which reached close to the earth in the auroral
zones. It seemed obvious that the satellites had only
reached the lower portions of the radiation belts so radi-
ation equipment was put on the lunar probes to test the
area farther from the earth.
     The first moon-shot, Pioneer I, carried the instrum-
ents out to 70,000 miles and showed that the radiation
extended outward for many thousands of miles but
reached a peak about 10,000 miles above the earth. Pio-
neer III cut the radiation belts in two places for 65,000
miles and gave excellent data. It indicated that there
were two concentric belts, an inner belt that reaches its


JANUARY 1960




peak intensity about 2,000 miles from the earth, and an
outer belt that reaches its peak intensity level 10,000
miles from the earth. The radiation lessens after 10,000
miles and almost completely disappears after 40,000
miles.
     Most scientists believe that the source of the par-
ticles for these two belts is the sun. Some of the reasons
for this belief are that it is the outer belt which reaches
toward the earth at the poles and is responsible for the
auroras, airglows and other atmospheric disturbances.
Solar injection would account for the fact that when the
earth's magnetic poles are tilted away from the sun, the
leakage of charged particles into the lower atmosphere
to form auroras etc. occurs most often. During the sea-
sons when the earth's poles are tilted toward the sun, it
is believed that the charged particles escape very readily
from the earth's magnetic field and particle leakage into
the aurora zone ceases. This leakage is also thought to
explain why the Arctic atmosphere has (particle) tem-
peratures as high as 2000 degress Kelvin while the upper
equatorial atmosphere has much lower temperatures
ranging around 1100 degrees Kelvin.
     Another basis for the solar injection theory is the
observed fluctuation in the drag of the satellites. This
fluctuation in mean drag of the satellites puzzled many
people. And then Dr. Luigi Jacchia of Harvard Uni-
versity noticed that the fluctuations were varying with
a period of 27 days which happened to correspond with
the period of the sun's rotation. Further work showed
that the drag increased whenever there was any solar
activity that increased radiation.
     The fluctuating drag curves tied in very nicely with
the solar injection theory if explained by the electrical
drag concept. In this concept, when there is a high den-
sity of charged particles, the satellite will collide with
electrons which will give the skin a high negative charge.
This charge will repel other electrons, creating a cloud
of positive charges around the satellite. The increased
cloud area becomes the effective diameter of the satellite
and the atmospheric resistance will increase due to the
greater numbers of collisions with thermal protons.
     Thus if the drag of a satellite varies with particle
 density, and the density of the particles varies with solar
 radiation, then every time there are large solar dis-
 turbances the mean drag of the satellite should increase.
 This result is exactly what happens and, in addition,


variations in 20 centimeter radio waves from the sun
agree with the variations in the drag of our satellites.
Therefore, solar injection does seem to be the prime
supplier of the charged particles in the two Van Allen
Belts.
     However, the solar origin theory has two un-
answered objections. First of all, particle energies in the
belts are much higher than the supposed energy of sun
corpuscles. It has been determined that these corpuscles
are slow moving and therefore have low energies, but it
is possible that these corpuscles are given increased
velocities through some unknown magnetohydrodynamic
effect of the earth's magnetic field. The second objection
is that it is difficult to explain how charged particles
from the sun can get into the earth's magnetic field.
     Nicholas Christofilos, Fred R. Singer and others
have proposed a different source of the high energy
particles in the lower belt. They think that neutrons are
created by the cosmic-ray bombardment of the upper
atmosphere. It is these neutrons which are believed to
decay into highly charged electrons and protons. But
there are unanswered energy considerations which im-
pair this theory. However, the lower belt does seem to
have much higher energies than the outer belt.
     Of course, it is possible that the belts fluctuate and
that a difference in radiation intensity occurs. Perhaps
in several years there will not be two belts or perhaps
they will increase or decrease in size. If the particles
originate in the sun, these fluctuations would correspond
to solar activity and 1958 was a year of unusually violent
solar disturbances.
     As of now, the maximum radiation level of the belts
varies from 10 to 100 roentgens per hour. The danger
to space travelers is obvious when a 10 roentgen ex-
posure for two days leaves a human only a slight chance
for survival. The only solutions to this danger would be
to shield the ship or take-off through the radiation-free
zone over the poles. A manned space station would find
it necessary to orbit below 400 miles or at more than
30,000 miles.
     The future will hold many answers to problems now
confronting us in regard to the Van Allen Belts. Theories
will solidify or be rejected and knowledge of our upper
atmosphere will be gained. The Van Allen Belts are our
first real obstacle to space, and they may be the hardest
to overcome. U

ELECTRONICS IN A NUTSHELL




                                       Tiny electronic components are opening new
                                       design concepts in electronic equipment.


   Everyone wants more space. To accomplish this we
want everything more compact. This movement toward
miniaturization can be seen in the home, the plant, the
office, and most prevalently in the instrument packages
in our satillites.
    The search for miniaturization can best be seen,
in the electronics industry. In this field the dif-
ferences in size are easily apparent. Examples such as the
replacement of voluminious vacuum tubes by tiny tran-
sistors in many applications come to mind immediately.
    Just how and why did this leaning toward the mini-
ature start? A trend towards more compact electronic
circuitry started over two decades ago with the de-
velopment of special vacuum tubes for hearing aid am-
plifiers, and the introduction of the small "GT" (glass
envelope) and metal tube types as substitues for bul-
bous "G" types. This trend received a boost during
World War II as the military demanded subminiature
vacuum tubes and components. After the war, circuits
continued to shrink as more and more manufacturers
started to use printed and etched circuits for wiring and
miniature glass tubes in place of the larger and older
"GT" types.
    In recent years miniaturization has progressed
rapidly. For example, you could buy a hearing aid not'
much larger than a package of cigarettes. With the de-


SPUTTERED COMPONENTS have greatly aided in minia-
turizing printed circuits.

velopment of the transistor, electronics circuits shrank
to comparatively small sizes. Now a multistage amplifier
can be built in the space formerly required for a single
subminiature tube.
     With the invention of the junction transistor and
 the consequent rapid development of a host of solid
 state components, the stage was set for a great revolu-
 tion in microminiaturization which we are now witness-
 ing. Here are devices capable of performing all the
 functions of the versatile vacuum tube with a small frac-
 tion of its volume, power consumption, and required
 operation voltage.
     Along with this, component manufacturers found
 that they could print resistors, capacitors and other cir-
 cuit elements on ultra-small ceramic boards. Since cir-
 cuit wiring could be printed at the same time, it became
 possible to make up complete circuit modules which,
 compared to conventional miniature circuits were "real-
 ly" small. For example, a four stage transistorized ampli-
 fier can easily be put on a ceramic board measuring 1
 in. x Y3 in. x 4 in.
     These developments made possible personalized
radios, battery, portable television, and other similar
devices.
     Recently, RCA announced the pilot production of
an extensive line of micromodules: complete circuits in
packages measuring but a fraction of an inch on each
side and weighing less than a tenth of an ounce. They
are composed of tiny wafers one-hundrth of an inch
thick and a third of an inch square. Each of these wafers,
is an electronic circuit component such as a re-
sistor, capacitor, inductor, transistor and diode. The
integration of the microelement in the module is such
that a circuit function is represented and a structural
unit is obtained. Each wafer may represent the counter-
part of one or more conventional components contain,
for example, combinations of active and passive ele-
ments.
    Microelements are interconnected within a module
by 12 riser wires terminating in end wafers. These end
wafers provide circuit terminations and also serve as a
mold for the entire module assembly. The resulting
micromodule is a standardized building block approxi-
mately 0.350 by 0.350 inches high, the exact height var-
ing with circuit function.
    The micromodule gives high component density,


JANUARY 1960





reduced circuit interconnections, and compatibility with
present day production techniques-all of which are
comprised of sound electrical and mechanical design.
     The two basic approaches to the micromodule con-
cept are the integrated approach and the hybrid ap-
proach. The integrated approach accomplishes in a
single solid state microcircuit the functions of many con-
ventional components. The hybrid approach uses the sol-
id state microcircuit in combination with standard mi-
croelements. Micromodules representing RF, IF, audio
and digital circuit functions have been designed by the
hybrid approach.
     Microelements of resistance and capacitance can be
put on glass as ceramic, complete with interconnections
by using a technique known as sputtering. These micro-
elements can be used in the hybrid approach to produce
a micromodule. Each microelement can be a line as thin
as one-thousandth of an inch. In the sputtering tech-
nique, ionized gas molecules bombard a metallic cat-
hook. They dislodge atoms of metal which then re-
deposit on nearby surfaces.
     By depositing copper on a plate of glass, etching
 out the pattern wanted, sputtering on tantalum, then
 putting the plate in an etching bath produces five lines
 of tantalum which act as a resistance.
   Texas Instrument has developed an integrated micro-
 module consisting of a diode and transistor elements
 together with passive elements of resistance and capaci-
 tance as integral solid circuits about the size of a match
 head. The achievable component density of 34 million
 components per cubic foot approaches the ultimate in
 miniaturizing complex electronic circuitry and compon-
 ents.
     The basis micromodular concept has been planned
 to include future solid-state techniques both in the
 areas of advanced individual circuit components and
 in the integrated approaches. Recent component de-
 velopments, such as integrated unipolar transistors, mesa
 transistors, fully printed electronic capacitors, and neg-

THIS MULTI-TRACK RECORDING HEAD has reduced
the space required and is invaluable for recording in-
formation where compactness is essential.

ative resistance diodes, lie within the immediate scope
of the micromodule program. Additional developments
covered by this scope include microminiaturized mag-
netic memory, transfluxor, semiconductor delay line,
parametric amplifier and high voltage photovoltaic
elements.
     The adaption of most basic solid-state microcircuit
concepts, which integrate the functions of many con-
ventional ciicuits into a single solid-state device, is readi-
ly made to standard form microelement properties.
     As new solid-state devices are developed and be-
come available, their integration with microelements
may be immediately effected.
     Now that the industry has created these micro-
elements they must search for means to insure their ab-
solute dependability. Then and only then can these new
electronic midgets take their place as the space savers of
the future.0

ATOMS IN YOUR FUTURE?


  You are looking at a photograph recently
released by the Atomic Energy Commission.
It shows the Commission's heavy water plant
near the banks of the Savannah River in
South Carolina. It is but one unit of an
atomic energy project that covers more
ground than the entire city of Chicago.
  This vast installation was built by Du Pont
at government request in 1950 for cost plus
$1. Still operated by Du Pont, it stands as a
bastion of strength for the free world. Equally
important, here are being expanded horizons
of nuclear engineering which will eventually
lead to better living for all of us.
  Like hundreds of other Du Pont research
projects, probing the mysteries of the atom
has led to all kinds of new jobs. Exciting
jobs. In the laboratory. In production. In
administration. Good jobs that contribute
substantially to the growth of Du Pont and
our country's security and prosperity.
  What does all this have to do with you?
  For qualified bachelors, masters and doc-
tors, career opportunities are today greater at

   Du Pont than ever before. There is a bright
   future here for metallurgists, physicists, math-
   ematicians, electrical and mechanical engi-
   neers, and other technical specialists, as well
   as for chemists and chemical engineers.
      Perhaps you will work in the field of atomic
   research and development. But that is only a
   small part of the over-all Du Pont picture.
   Your future could lie in any of hundreds of
   areas, from the development of new fibers,
   films or plastics to the exploration of solar
   energy. Or in the sale and marketing of new
   products developed in these and many other
   areas. In any case, you will be given respon.

HUMAN


ENGINEERING



                   BY EARL SEILER






Human elements determine
the limits of machine
performance.


    One important engineering lesson to come out of
 World War II is that "Machines do not fight alone."
 The war needed and produced many novel and com-
 plicated machines, but often the contrivances did not
 do what was expected of them because they exceeded
 or did not match the capabilities of their human oper-
 ators. In general, to operate some of these devices you
 needed a man with two heads, the arms of an ape, no
 legs, and ten fingers on each hand. More specifically,
 there were the problems of equipment design, fatigue
 and monotony, unusual environments, and of "see-
 ability," "reachability," and "sitability." These are
 problems  the  layman   commonly    associates with
 "human engineering"-a branch of applied science
 aimed at matching machines and tasks with the abilities
 of their human operators.
     After World War II, human engineers turned their
 attention to the thousands of machines which surround
 us in everyday life. There they found that many of the
 same design errors which plagued the sailor, soldier, and
 airman exist in factories, tractors, trucks, automobiles,
 and even in the home. Gages which the industrial
 worker can scarcely interpret, controls which mystify
 the housewife, highway signs that confuse the motorist
 -these and thousands of similar examples are all in-
 stances of poor design. Moreover, the petty annoyances,
 the irritations, the inefficiencies, and the accidents
 caused by these design errors multiply daily as our
 civilization becomes more and more mechanized. Added
 to the vast number of factors to be kept in mind when
 equipment is designed, is the forceful reminder of the
 importance of the nebulous human factor.
     It would be ideal if the engineer could turn to
 handbooks of human data, or to textbooks of psycholo-
 gy, physiology, or anthropometry to find the informa-
 tion he needs, in about the same way that he can turn
 to the "Handbook of Chemistry and Physics," the
 "Radio Engineer's Handbook," or any of a dozen others.
 This is impossible because our storehouse of information
 about the human factors in engineering design is still too
 limited to provide more than a small percentage of the
 answers we would like to have for the evergrowing
 number of problems encountered.
    In approaching these problems the human engineer
has at his disposal two powerful tools. One is a detailed
knowledge of human behavior that has accumulated
over the 100 years during which psychological research
has been conducted. The fact that the eye can resolve
two points as close together as 44 seconds of arc, for
example, was of help in establishing the resolution of
visual displays, such as cathode ray tubes. The knowl-
edge that man can respond to light in as little as two
tenths of a second was useful in selecting the buffers
needed between a manual and a high-speed electro-
mechanical process. In addition to such established
facts, the psychologist also had at his disposal tech-
niques for conducting research on human beings. He
could perform. controlled experiments, vary a para-
meter, and measure the effect on human performance.
By wearing red goggles, man's ability to adapt to dark-

ness was tested. Data was accumulated on the ability to
withstand  extremes of temperature, pressure, and
humidity, and to make precise settings on equipment
controls. The sizes of handwheels, cranks, and foot
pedals were established, along with their locations and
the optimum forces required of the operator.
     Physical scientists often critisize human engineering
as being little more than the application of common
sense. The findings of human engineering research are
not the product of common sense, although they some-
times verify common sense. Judging if man can di-
tinguish between a tone of 900 cps and 905 cps is a
difficult task for common sense. Common sense doesn't
tell you that if you expose the eye to 50 bits of informa-
tion per second you will lose about one third of the in-
formation in transmission. Many human engineering
principles do, in fact, involve more than common sense.
The idea that seats in automobiles ought to be built to
accomodate different sized drivers is a common sense
idea. You do not need research to tell you that the
headband on a telephone operator's headset should not
be so tight that it hurts her ear. Nor is any experimen-
tation required to justify the conclusion that dials,
gages and machine controls be within the operator's
reach. Many human engineering difficulties can be
eliminated by an intelligent appraisal of the problems
that would face the machine operator.
     A most important point is that even today common
sense can lead you astray in the solution of many human
engineering problems. Nearly everyone knows that
boiler factories are very noisy and workman have diffi-
culty hearing and understanding speech because of this
noise. Does it seem sensible that you can improve the
intelligibility of speech by the use of earplugs? The
chances are very high that the answer you would get
from the average person is that this is a non-sensical
notion. Perhaps even you think so. If you do, research
proves you wrong. Workman can hear better with ear-
plugs!
     Another example is found in the cockpits of most
modern aircraft. In the conventional artificial horizon
a miniature representation of an airplane remains
stationary and a white line, traversing the indicator,
represents the horizon. During straight and level flight
the horizon line is horizontal. When the aircraft banks
to the right, the horizon line rotates counterclockwise,
i.e., to the left. When the aircraft banks to the left, the
horizon line rotates clockwise. The person who de-


signed this indicator undoubtedly relied on his common
sense for this arrangement, and there is a logical argu-
ment to support his decision. In an aircraft cockpit
when the plane banks to the right, the horizon appears
to tilt to the left. Hence, if you construct an instrument
which duplicates this picture you should have an in-
strument which is easily and readily interpreted. Seems
sensible, doesn't it? Yet the results of research show this
sort of display to be confusing, even to experienced pilots.
A much more easily interpreted indicator is one in which
the movement relations are exactly reversed. Now that
we have the results of this experiment, it is not hard to
find a common sense explanation for it. The pilot thinks
of the earth and horizon as stable references with the
plane moving around in space. An instrument which
shows these relationships directly is the more easily in-
terpreted.
     In a chemical experiment, you can reach for a
 reagent and look at the label to see what you have. The
 label will identify the reagent by name, tell you its puri-
 ty, and give you its chemical formula. In addition, for
 a large variety of chemicals, you can be sure that it will
 be the same in the afternoon as it was in the morning
 and that it will be the same tomorrow morning as it is
 today. You can say anything you want to it, and it will
 still be what the label says.
     But contrast this situation with what you get when
 you reach out into the corridor for a human "reagent."
 You literally do not know what you have. At best, you
 have a little information about the past history of your
 reagent, a rough idea about the limits of its performance,
 and only a vague notion about its stability. You know
 that it will not be the same in the afternoon as it is in
 the morning and that it will definitely change overnight.
 Finally, you can be certain that its reactions will be
 markedly determined by what you say to it. It is com-
 plications such as these that create difficulty in human
 experimentation.
     Human engineering is a young and unfamiliar field.
 It is often misunderstood and misrepresented, but the
 rewards in improved machine operability and greater
 usefulness of man-machine systems have already been
 great. The unique contributions of human engineering
 are a combination of knowledge of human behavior and
 methods for the study of unknown areas of behavior
 with appreciation for the engineering problems of sys-
 tems development. More will undoubtedly be heard
 about it in the future. n

    GRADES AT


                        A

           GLANCE







         BY JAMES BRUBAKER

     n an educational institution the size of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, the problem of collecting grades
at the end of a trimester and preparing a student's
academic record report is an enormous one. Since
the advent of the trimester at Pitt, the time between
the end of one trimester and registration for the on-
coming trimester has been reduced.
     The grades for every student are received by the
Registrar's Office at the end of each trimester. Any one
student may have taken courses in several departments
of the University. An electrical engineering student,
for example, may have taken a course from the Math-
ematics Department, a course from the English De-
partment, and a course from the Psychology Depart-
ment, along with his electrical engineering courses.
The Registrar's Office must sort and merge the grades
to prepare a grade report for each student. This grade
report, showing the courses carried and the grades
earned, is sent to the department in which the student
is registered. The faculty advisor in that department
must then collate this information with the student's


  past academic record to prepare the up dated academic
  record.
      Academic records serve many functions. They may,
  upon a student's request, be released to future em-
  ployers, they are used as an aid in presentations of
  awards, as a guide for student counseling, as informa-
  tion used   to predict future schedule requirements,
  and many other purposes. Of immediate urgency, at
  the end of each trimester the records are used to aid
  students and faculty advisors in deciding the courses
  that should be taken by students in the next trimester.
  Also, Probation and Not Permitted to Register lists
  are prepared from these records.
      One can visualize the number of man hours
 required to perform this task manually when there
 are over 2,500 students registered in the Schools of
 Engineering and Mines alone. The shorter time between
 trimesters has forced the administration to develop
 a faster method of calculation of the student's academic
 records.
      We began to attack the problem of writing a
 program for IBM 650. This program is a mathemati-
 cally logical sequence of operations in a language intel-
 ligible to the machine.
     The first step was to determine exactly what
 information  should  be contained   in  an  academic
 records report, which will give an easy evaluation of
 a student's academic progress. Also we needed      to
 know what formulas should be used to arrive at each
 bit of information. These formulas are a derivation
 of the criteria established by the administration of the
 Schools of Engineering and Minies. The following items,
 it was decided, are necessary on each grade report:
    1. The courses a student has taken and correspond-
 ing grades a student has earned.
    2. The credits, quality points, and quality point
 average earned in the most recent timester he has
 attended.
    3. The credits, quality points, and quality point
 average earned during his attendance at Pitt.
    4. The number of failing grades received to date.
    5. The number of times on N. P. R. to date.
    6. The number of times on probation to date.
    7 Courses that he has and F and G not yet removed,
and when it was received.
    8. Courses that an F or G has been removed, when
it was removed, and with what grade it was removed.
    9. Information such as: Did this student ever re-
ceive more than one "F" in any one course? Has this
student been on probation more than three times, not
necessarily in sequence? etc.
   10. The student's academic status (clear, probation,
N. P. R.) as of the end of the most recent trimester
in attendance.
   11. The reason for the academic status determined
in No. 10.
    Even though most of the above items seem to be
straight forward calculations, various complications
arose as we delved    deeper into the problem. For


JANUARY 1960


IBM 650

Diagram shows flow of data in the system


example, let's look a little closer at the calculation of
the quality point average earned since a student's at-
tendance at the University. Each credit of work car-
ried is awarded quality points which are computed
according to the following scale: Each credit of A
grade is multiplied by 4; B grade, by 3; C grade, by 2;
D grade by 1; and F grade, by 0 until removed by a
passing grade. When a course is repeated to remove
an F grade, and when a course is repeated to raise a
low passing grade, only the final grade, credits, and
quality points will be used to determine quality point
average and the student's scholastic standing. The
total number of quality points earned, divided by the
total number of credits carried (exclusive of credits
for courses for which the grades P, WX, and G are
given) shall be the quality point average.
     One may note in the above criteria that the most
recent grade received in a course replaces the credits
and quality points earned by the previous grade. If
the same course has been repeated the problem is a
minor one, but in some cases, a course substitution is
valid. To cite one situation with which most of us
are familiar, Mathematics 101 may be taken to re-
move a failing grade in Mathematics 100. In this case,
when the program logically instructs the machine to
scan the grades earned this trimester to see if an out-
standing F in Mathematics 100 has been removed it
must not only test for a passing grade in Mathematics
100, but also in Mathematics 101, if such a subsitution
is permissable in the particular department. Multiply
this one problem by many such situations and the
sequence of instructions already has evolved into a
large one.
     After a sequence of operations was developed, to
determine the first nine items needed on an academic
report (previously reviewed in this article), in a
language intelligent to the IBM 650, the academic status
as explained in item 10 and 11 must be determined.
The status is based not only on the quality point
average, but also on a complete evaluation of each
of the items already determined against the criteria
established by the administration of the Schools of


Engineering and Mines. After a program was written
to instruct the machine to make these evaluations, we
had yet to enclose this program into a closed loop
data processing system.
     The academic record of each student is punched
onto a deck of IBM cards. Merged with this deck are
the class cards containing such information as the
course taken and the grade received. This new in-
formation is then punched onto a deck of cards similar
to the one which made up part of the input deck. This
deck will be part of the input deck the following tri-
mester, thus completing the closed loop data proces-
sing system. The academic record reports, now on
cards, is then printed on highly readable forms of which
one copy is received by the student, one by the faculty
advisor. Other copies are kept on file in the Dean's
Office. At the present time only three copies are made
with one printing by the use of carbon paper. More
could easily be made if needed.
     This record report is not the only information re-
ceived as output from this process. Stored on magnetic
tape is a complete N. P. R. and Probation list, as de-
termined by the algorithm established by the program.
     It is important to stress here that the actual
 academic status of each student is determined by the
 departmental chairmen. The output of the machine
 is only the facts based on known criteria, printed on
 an easily readable form which serves as a guide to the
 departmental chairmen.
     Also easily accessible from this program is statisti-
 cal data which may be used in course analysis, future
 scheduling, and as an aid to high school teaching. The
 program can count the number of students who have
 taken any course and calculate a ratio of the number
 who have failed the course. It can also determine the
 quality point average of a department, a school, or
 the entire university.
     The computer time required to determine the
 academic record report and other supplementary in-
 formation is less than four hours for over 2,000 students
 in the Schools of Engineering and Mines. In addition
 the possibility of human error is eliminated.N

Announcing The








    Scholarship, industry and loyalty are the qualities
 which the committee of engineering faculty and students
 look for in awarding the annual Engineering and Mines
 Travel and Training Award (EMITT). Of these, schol-
 arship is of basic importance. Industry and application
 to the profession, aside from the prescribed field of
 study is of prime consideration to the committee. And
 finally, loyalty to the University and to the Schools of
 Engineering and Mines, and participation in the ac-
 tivities of 'these units are considered in presenting the
 award which sends a Pitt Engineer overseas for travel
 and industrial experience in a country of his choice.
     The EMITT program had its start at Pitt in the
 offices of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER in June
 1955. Staff members, familiar with a program known as
 IAESTE, the International Association for Exchange of
 Students for Technical Experience, through an ex-
 change magazine, the PURDUE ENGINEER, initiated
 action for a similar program at Pitt.
     In September of 1955, E&M Cabinet appointed a
 chairman to investigate the possibility of Pitt engineers
 participating in the IAESTE program. In December,
 three students completed applications foi summer
 employment. Through IAESTE, placements were quick-
 ly made in Scotland and Germany and finally in May
 the third applicant was placed in Sweden.
     To insure the success of the program, E&M Cabin-
 et pledged $500 to the awardee to help cover expenses.
 Four faculty and three student leaders then began the
 task of choosing the first awardee, and in the selection
 named the award, the Engineering and Mines Travel
 and Training Award.
     Now in its fifth year, the EMITT program has con-
 tinued to receive the support of E&M Cabinet, Dr.
 Fitterer, and the Alumni Association, who together con-
 tribute funds to help cover expenses for the awardee's
 six week trip. Local industry has also made sizeable con-
 tributions to the program. g

                                              route to a management career.
                                                  Quite a few engineering students must have this
M    ANAGEM                   ENT             goal in mind, judging from a survey made by the Pro-
                                               fessional Engineers' Conference Board for Industry in
                                               cooperation with the National Society of Professional
                                               Engineers. The Engineers surveyed were asked: "As-
                                               suming an engineer could advance just as far in strictly
             BY   JOHN    BARTHEN              engineering work as he could by moving into manage-
                                               ment, which way would you personally prefer to direct
                                               your career?" Only thirty-four per cent chose strictly

engineering work. Fifty per cent preferred management
work and sixteen percent gave qualified answers or had
no opinion.
     This preference for management has resulted in
 graduates of schools of engineering holding forty per
 cent of the executive and managerial positions of large
 firms. This figure is based on a study made by Rensse-
 laer Polytechnic Institute as long ago as 1949. Since
 management has been forced to speed up technological
 progress to offset rising costs caused by spiraling Ameri-
 can wages, more and more engineers have been hired and
 the percentage of executive positions filled by them is
 no doubt increasing.
     A careful study conducted in 1951 by the American
 Society for Engineering Education showed graduates of
 engineering have ten to twenty times the probability of
 attaining executive positions as compared to all other
 college graduates and that after an engineer has served
 his training period over half. of his duties could be con-
 sidered more of a managerial than an engineering
 nature.
     Although these facts indicate the possibility of a
 management position through engineering, they do not
 reveal the method of achieving such a goal. To go into
 engineering and expect to end up in a managerial po-
 sition with no other considerations is probably being a
 little too optimistic.
     While the engineer seems to have preferred entree
into the management profession he has several glaring
inadequacies. The urgent need for engineers and the
increasing technological knowledge that is required of
him has dictated an education that leaves no time for
the liberal arts. Yet to advance into management, the
ability to cope with the human problems is imperative.
In addition to this most important consideration, a
working knowledge of marketing, finance, manufactur-
ing, costs and cost systems, and industrial relations is
also required.
     Engineers realize after they begin working that they
need more than the technical training they have re-
ceived. When asked by NSPE, National Society of Pro-
fessional Engineers, "If your company sponsored train-
ing in all of the things on the following list, which three
do you feel would be most profitable to you?" They
answered:
      Organization  &  Planning................66%
      How to Handle People....................50%
      How   to Supervise........................41%
      Public  Speaking................. ......38%
      Letter & Report Writing..................35%
      Company   Economics.....................34%
      Advanced   Engineering...................31%
      How to Conduct Meetings................25%
      Advanced  Mathematics...................18%
      Budgeting ................................14%
      None,  no choice .......................... 5%
      You may agree that many of the above topics are
worthwhile but you may also wonder how you can de-
sign your engineering curriculum to include this ad-
ditional training. To answer this question let us examine
a field that seems to have taken into account most of the
managerial considerations but offers an engineering
background and is achieved in an undergraduate pro-


gram. This field is industrial engineering, the branch of
engineering whose number has increased more rapidly
in the post war period than any other group.
     The fact it draws upon the social as well as mathe-
 ematical and physical sciences and it works with inte-
 grated systems of men, materials, and equipment clear-
 ly indicates this could be the field for those interested
 in a management career.
     In addition to a solid engineering and basic science
 background, the IE undergraduate at the University of
 Pittsburgh is trained in production techniques through
 courses in machine tools and processes, materials hand-
 ling, production planning and control, plant layout, and
 methods engineering. He is taught how to cope with
 human problems through instruction in work measure-
 ment, wage structure analysis, wage incentives, job
 evaluation and simplification, and industrial safety en-
 gineering. These, plus courses in programming of digital
 computers, linear programming, fundamentals of statis-
 tics and quality control, manufacturing organization
 and management, cost finding and cost accounting for
 management, engineering economics and equipment
 replacement, and plant location, give him a working
 knowledge of many scientific management tools.
     This education qualifies him for positions of heavier
 responsibility than the design of a particular piece of
 equipment, process or beam. It enables him to approach
 the problems of complex industrial organizations with a
 desirable knowledge of the integration of men, machines,
 and materials. He is better able to think in the broader
 nature of the management profession. In his pursuits
 the IE is continually in close contact with management
 personnel and may readily use this experience as a
 stepping stone into management.
     However, in your pursuit of a managerial position
do not be as foolish as the inebriate who was seen
searching under a streetlight for a key he had lost. When
asked where he had lost the key he replied, "Around the
corner in an alleyway, but ish too dark to shee there."
While the general education of industrial engineering
can be extremely helpful, if you already have three or
more yeai's training in say chemical, electrical, or
mechanical engineering and plan to work for a firm in-
terested in chemical processes, or in manufacture of
electrical equipment your present training may be quite
necessary and very useful to your advancement into
management.
     Therefore your key to a management position may
nriot lie in IE but rather in combining the IE education
with your branch of engineering. Many graduate engi-
neers find themselves trying to apply the principles of
Industrial Engineering without formal training in them.
Examine the IE curriculum and see what courses would
be of value to you. This could prove to be extremely
helpful when your work assignment spans these areas.
    While an undergraduate be sure you are training
yourself most effectively for the work you intend to
perform. The initiative in this matter must be taken by
you. Do not wait too long to make your decision.0

IT'S LITERALLY

ALL AROUND YOU!


                    The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
                    But there is quite another kind of "space" close at hand, a kind that will always
                    challenge the genius of man.
                    This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
                    distance between them ... the kind of space found between mainland and off-
                    shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply
                    base, between the site of a mountain crash and a waiting ambulance-above all,
                    Sikorsky is concerned with the precious "spaceway" that currently exists be-
                    tween all earthbound places.
                    Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
                    aircraft configurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
                    versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-
                    hicles that can prove to be tomorrow's most versatile means of transportation.
                    Here, then, is a space age challenge to be met with the finest and most practical
                    engineering talent. Here, perhaps, is the kind of challenge you can meet.

JANUARY 1960






























   During     the annual British airshow    at Farn-
borough, England in 1952, spectators witnessed the
first public demonstration of a new flight phenomena
-the sonic boom. Several aircraft, including a Hawker
Hunter, a DeHavilland DH 110, and an American
Sabre Jet, were put through dive maneuvers in which
they exceeded the speed of sound. Each time this was
done, explosive like booms were heard at ground level
an instant later.
     The demonstration touched off a lively debate in
technical magazines and journals, with two schools
of thought being developed about the physical ex-
planation of the boom. One group attempted to show
that the boom was the result of an accumulation of
engine and aerodynamic noise that .would occur each
time the airplane accelerated or decelerated through
the sonic speed. The other group advanced the theory
that this was a shock wave phenomena. Subsequent
investigations have proven the latter theory to be
correct. It is now known that this shock wave noise
can be produced by aircraft in steady supersonic flight
as well as in maneuvers, and that under certain con-
ditions, the boom created will be of sufficient intensity
to be objectionable to people along the flight path.
It becomes imperative, therefore, for the aircraft de-
signer to include the sonic boom as a factor in the
design of future supersonic transports.
     The theory of shock waves has been available
 for many years. The first development of the equation
 relating pressure and density changes across a normal
 shock wave was made by Rankine in 1870, and
 Hugoniot arrived at the same expression, independently,
 in 1889. Ernest Mach, the Viennese physicist and
 philosopher, made use of the Topler Schlieren method
 to observe the supersonic flow about projectiles before
 1900; and in 1908 Meyer presented a general theory
 of shock waves. In the ensuing years, numerous in-
 vestigators have compiled a wealth of theoretical and


experimental knowledge about shock waves. However,
the "far field" problem, that is, the description of the
character of the shock waves at large distanc6s from
the source or origin of the pressure disturbance, was
practically ignored until recent years. As a result, the
intensity of the shock wave noise that could be pro-
duced at ground level by an airplane flying at altitudes
above 10,000 feet came as a complete surprise to most
engineers.
     Aircraft flying at transonic and supersonic speeds
generate local shock wave patterns in the vicinity of
the airplane that are very complex. The remarkable
fact is that this shock wave pattern coalesces into a
fairly simple wave shape at large distances from the
airplane. The pressure disturbance at the ground be-
comes a transient wave consisting of a. sudden pressure
raise, followed by a gradual reduction in pressure,
and a second sudden pressure rise a short time later.
The first pressure increase is accociated with the so
called "bow wave" and the second with the "tail
wave" of the airplane. Each sudden pressure change
produces a boom. At California Institute of Tech-
nology in 1945, DuMond and his associates, in con-
ducting experiments to determine the laws of pro-
pogation and dissipation of ballistic shock waves, re-
ferred to this type of far field pressure wave as an
N wave, as the resemblance to the letter N is very
pronounced in many cases.
     Recently the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration published the results of flight and wind
tunnel research conducted to determine the relative
importance of the many variables that are involved
in the sonic boom problem. In NASA Technical Note
D-48 Sept. 1959, Magliere, Hubbard, and Lansing re-
ported the results of a flight investigation in which
ground pressure measurements were recorded for air-
craft flying at Mach numbers to 1.4 and altitudes to
45,000 feet. The results of their tests indicate that the


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER




pressure rise at the ground is prcdictable with fair
accuracy by use of the following equation:

   P = KC     Vj Mp-            11/84


In this equation, P is the transient pressure rise,
K is a reflection constant for the terrain, C is a
body-shape factor, p is the ambient pressure at the
airplane altitude, F is the ambient pressure at the
ground, M is the mach number, L is the equivalent
length of the airplane, D is the equivalent diameter of
the airplane, and y is the distance from the ground
to the airplane measured normal to the flight path.
This equation was developed by G. B. Whitham of
the University of Manchester for a paraboloid and
some judgement is necessary to evaluate the various
coefficients and equivalent dimensions for an airplane.
If the observer is displaced laterally from the flight
track, it has been suggested that the distance y can
be taken as the slant height from observer to the air-
plane, but in this case the available test data does not
correlate with the equation.
     Of the variables in the equation, the altitude y
provides the most powerful means for alleviating the
severity of the boom. The terrain coefficient and the
ambient pressures cannot be considered readily con-
trollable by the aircraft designer, although to some

extent the ambient pressure is controllable through
selection of the flight altitude. The variables concerned
with the geometric shape of the airplane are at the
disposal of the designer but many other performance
and structural considerations will limit the freedom of
choice and range of these. The equation is only valid
for mach numbers greater than one, but above M
equals 1.1 there is only a slight increase in P as the
mach number increases.
     Several variables which are not included in the
 Whitham equation are very important in determining
 the attenuation of the shock wave noise in the atmos-
 phere. These are the temperature gradients and the


wind gradients which exist in the atmosphere, and
the lift which must be produced by the airplane.
    The usual temperature variation that exists in the
atmosphere will produce a curvature of the wave be-
cause of the variation of shock wave velocity with
temperature. The propogation velocity for a shock wave
for air as a perfect gas is approximately given by the
equation:


               v = 0. 925 a


where v is the shock wave velocity normal to the wave,
in feet per second, a is the speed of sound in the
ambient atmosphere ahead of the wave, p is the ambient
pressure in the atmosphere ahead of the wave, and Q
is the pressure immediately behind the shock wave.
This equation can be written in an alternate form
by use of thQ well known relationship for the speed
of sound as a function of the absolute temperature,
T: In this equation a is replaced by the square root of T.
     Temperatures in the atmosphere fluctuate over
wide ranges of values at all altitudes but the standard
altitude assumes a linear temperature reduction from
a sea level value of 59uF to -69.70F at 36,090 feet,
and from there to an altitude of 65,000 feet the
temperature is assumed to be constant at -69.70F. For
the standard atmosphere, the shock wave velocity at

sea level would be 15/o greater than at 36,000 feet,
assuming   a constant shock pressure ratio of 2.0.
Obviously, the attenuation of the shock wave in the
far field is also a factor in the bending of the shock
wave, but for many practical cases the temperature
effect will overbalance this. Different wind velocities
and    directions also will increase or decrease the
velocity of the wave relative to the ground observer,
thus bending the wave forward or backward. The
wind and temperature effects will be most important
at mach numbers just above one, for under this con-
dition it is possible that forward curvature of the
wave will be sufficient to make it miss the ground

completely.
     The effects of lift are more difficult to describe
but a qualitative discussion of the problem will show
why the lift of the airplane is important in establishing
the noise intensity. The weight of an airplane in flight
is supported by the lift reaction created by the flow
around the airplane wing. This reaction induces a flow
field at the ground level which produces a positive
pressure distribution over the earth's surface. Through
this mechanism, the weight of the airplane is trans-
ferred to the earth's surface. Prandtl, Busemann, and
others have shown that for low subsonic speeds this
pressure is distributed over a large circular area, and
that the maximum pressure directly under the airplane
is given by the equation:


max        211h2


W is the airplane weight, and h is the altitude. Sub-
stitution of typical aircraft weight and flight altitude
in this equation shows this maximum is a minute frac-
tion of a pound per square foot. At supersonic speeds,
however, the weight can be transferred only to an
area within an approximate hyperbola defined by the
intersection of the shock wave surface and the earth's
surface, and within this area the positive pressures exist
only over a small part close to the bow wave position.
This is born out by the shape of the wave form meas-
ured by Magliere and his associates. Thus the weight
of the airplane becomes a factor in determining the
intensity of the boom.
     It appears that operational restriction of future
supersonic transports will be necessary to keep the
sonic boom noise within acceptable limits. Several esti-
mates have been made by both industry and the NASA
to assess the effects of these restrictions. Based on the
limited data available at present, two restrictions will
be necessary. First, the cruise altitude of the aircraft
will have to be in the vicinity of 50 or 60 thousand
feet. This will not be too serious, as other considerations


SONIC   BOOM    problems will be created  by supersonic
transports. These problems will have to be solved before
commercial supersonic air transportion becomes a reality.

feet. This will not be too serious, as other considerations
will make this desirable anyway. Second, the climb
  and descent phases of the flights will have to be re-
  stricted to subsonic speeds until altitudes of 30 or 35
  thousand feet are reached. Unless this is done, people
  in the near vicinity of the airports, 50 or 60 miles
  away-supersonically speaking, will get a bang from each
  flight; but they will not enjoy it.
      For cross country flights of 2,500 miles, there ap-
 pears to be general agreement that these restrictions
 will affect the length of flight time much more than
 the economy of the flight, some 10 or 12 minutes addi-
 tional flight time being added as a result of the restric-
 tion to subsonic climb and descent. This does not seem
 to be significant until it is recalled that an airplane
 flying at a Mach number of 3 at 60,000 feet will travel
 almost 2000 miles in an hour.
     Efforts to learn more about the basic nature of
 the sonic boom are continuing, but some investigators
 hold little hope for any solution except those outlined
 above. Adolph Busemann in a paper "The Relation
 Between Minimizing Wave Drag and Noise At Super-
 sonic Speeds" published in the Proceedings of the
 Conference on High Speed Aeronautics, Polytechnique
 Institute of Brooklyn, 1955, gave his impression of the
 problem as follows--"The noise is below the pain level
 but above the level of thunderstorms, though there
 are two   distinct bangs in succession. It is about
 the same noise as if a neighbor fires a salute with two
 cannons. Occasionally it can be considered fun and
 even in the long run people may get used to it and
 sleep through; they may even wake up only when a
 scheduled airliner does not come on time and they
 may start to worry."
     Whether Busemann is correct or not remains to
be proven. However, commercial jets now in service
are flying at speeds close to Mach one. The aircraft
industry will not and cannot set this as their maximum
speed range. They must face and conquer the sonic
boom problem, either by means of a technological
breakthrough or by submission of the public to the
boom clatter. E

  day. You really have to use your engineering train-
  ing and you're always working with new develop-
  ments. Every time Bell Laboratories designs a new
  and more efficient piece of equipment, you are
  challenged to incorporate it in our system effec-
  tively and economically. For example, I have been
  working on projects utilizing a newly developed
  voice frequency amllifier. It^s a plug-in type-
  transistorized-and consumes only two watts, so it
  has lots of advantages. But I have to figure out
  where and how it can be used in our sprawling
  network to provide new and improved service.
  Technological developments like this really put
  spice in the job."



                   SAYS BURNELL:

  "Training helps, too-and you get the best.
  Through an interdepartmental training program,
  you learn how company-wide operations dovetail.
  You also get a broad background by rotation of
  assignments. I'm now working with carrier sys-
  tems, but previously worked on repeater (ampli-
  fier) projects as Dick is doing now. Most
  important, I think you always learn 'practical engi-
  neering.' You constantly search for the solution
  that will be most economical in the long run."
     There's more, of course-but you can get the
  whole story from the Bell interviewer. He'll be
  visiting your campus before long. Be sure to sit
  down and talk with him.

an atomic clock in orbit


 To test Einstein's general theory of relativity, scien-
tists at the Hughes research laboratories are devel-
oping a thirty pound atomic maser clock (see photo
at left) under contract to the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Orbiting in a satellite,
a maser clock would be compared with another
on the ground to check Einstein's proposition that
time flows faster as gravitational pull decreases.
Working from the new research center in Malibu,
California, Hughes engineers will develop a MASER
(Microwave Amplification through Stimulated
Emission of Radiation) clock so accurate that it
will neither gain nor lose a single second in 1000
years. This clock, one of three types contracted
for by NASA, will measure time directly from the
vibrations of the atoms in ammonia molecules.
Before launching, an atomic clock will be syn-
chronized with another on the ground. Each
clock would generate a highly stable current with
a frequency of billions of cycles per second. Elec-
tronic circuitry would reduce the rapid oscillations
to a slower rate in order to make precise laboratory
measurements. The time "ticks" from the orbiting
clock would then be transmitted by radio to com-
pare with the time of the clock on earth. By meas-
uring the difference, scientists will be able to check
Einstein's theories.
In other engineering activities at Hughes, research
and development work is being performed on such


projects as advanced airborne systems, advanced
data handling and display systems, global and spa-
tial communications systems, nuclear electronics,
advanced radar systems, infrared devices, ballistic
missile systems...just to name a few.
The rapid growth of Hughes reflects the continuous
advance in Hughes capabilities-providing an ideal
environment for the engineer or physicist, whatever
his field of interest.

PRACTICAL THERMOELECTRICITY





BY FRED HARM


    Is it possible to convert the heat of a nuclear re-
actor or any source of heat directly into electricity?
Why are the wasteful heat exchangers, turbines and
generators necessary? What savings could be realized if
these expensive energy converting machines were elim-
inated? Thermoelectricty, the direct conversion of heat
energy to electricity, will shortly bring these questions
to the minds of many engineers.
     It is rather interesting that the phenomenon of
thermoelectricity has received the great amount of at-
tention that it has in the last few years. Actually, the
thermoelectric effect was one of the first electrical
discoveries. In 1882 physicist Seebeck noticed that a
voltage was developed in a loop containing two dis-
similar metals, provided that the metals were at dif-
ferent temperatures. It was found that this process could
be reversed. Another physicist, Peltier, found that the
junction between two dissimilar metals could act as a
heat sink, refrigerant, or source of heat depending on the
direction of the current.
     Why, then, is there such an interest in these old
discoveries? The present resurgence in thermoelectricity
stems from the advances in solid state physics made
since World War II, and the desire to make practical
applications in this field. The difficulty that has limited
the use of thermoelectricity, other than     that for
measurement purposes, has been the low thermoelec-
tric efficiency of current materials. In the past the best
materials were only capable of a five percent efficiency
in changing heat to electricity.
     New materials had to be developed that could op-
erate at the high temperatures encountered in nuclear
reactors and in the heart of a furnace, and yet still have
a high enough thermal efficiency to be useful.
     A new category of materials with improved charac-
teristics was recently discoverd by the Westinghouse
Electric  Corporation. T h e s e  new   thermoelectric
materials are ceramics, the broad group of substances
that includes such common materials as pottery and
brick. Ceramic materials are well known for their ability
to withstand high temperatures. These are the first sub-
stances that have promising efficiencies at temperatures
in the 2000 to 3000 degree Fahrenheit range. They are
inherently stable and chemically inactive, even at high
temperatures; they can be heated indefinitely in air
with an open flame without deterioration; they do not
require an extreme degree of purity and their use
presents no problems as to high-vacuum operation, com-


plex electrical or electronic apparatus.
     These thermoelectric   materials are   chemically
classified as "mixed valence" compounds. Valence is the
amount of electric charge displayed by atoms in a
chemical compound. In      mixed-valence   compounds,
atoms of the same element have different amounts of
charge within a single molecule of the compounds.
     It must be remembered that the work on these
materials is still in its early stages, and they do not yet
exhibit the   efficiency  demanded  by    conventional
methods of power generation. However, for specialized
applications, where compactness, light weight, and sim-
plicity are more important considerations than ef-
ficiency, these  new   thermoelectric  materials offer
promise for practical applications requiring small quan-

newly discovered class of compounds converts heat di-
rectly into electricity.

tities of electric power.
     At the present time, no theoretical roadblocks have
been discovered to their expected usefulness. A great
deal of work must still be done, but the day of useful,
large-scale thermoelectric power through these and
other thermoelectric materials will soon be here.
     The transistor is another material used extensively
in thermoelectric devices, due to certain inherent quali-
ties it possesses. The basic operation of the transistor
and the physical reasons for the production of electrical
energy in a material must be studied before the appli-
cations of the transistor can be understood.
     When one end of a material is heated the electrons
 in that material tend to flow to the cold end. This will
 cause one end of the material to be negatively charged.
 This charge will limit the number of new electrons that

liversa ten watts of electric power by the direct conversion

want to move to the cool end of the material. Eventually
this leads to a condition of equilibrium. Thus we are
left with a material that has a voltage potential.
     Now, if we can use a material that has an ad-
justable number of electrons present we will be able to
achieve a higher potential difference. Transistors have
this capability. Another characteristic present in tran-
sistors is their ability to obtain a voltage difference not
by the flow of electrons but by a flow of positively
charged "holes" vacated by electrons. This results in a
positively charged cold end and a negatively charged hot
end. This is opposite to the case mentioned for normal
materials.
     We now have the theoretical basis for the transistor
as a thermoelectric device. To obtain an electric current
we join the hot end of a type "a" material (hot end
positive) to the hot end of a type "b" material (hot end
negative), close the circuit by the use of a resistive ele-
ment such as a small motor and a current will flow.
     Now let us look into the future to see how thermo-
electricity will effect technology, remembering that
there are numerous kinds of thermoelectric materials.
     The actual generation of power is the first con-
sideration in thermoelectric devices. When two methods
of power generation are compared, the maximum ef-
ficiency is usually of utmost importance, but there are
other considerations that a good engineer must take into
account before claiming one method over the other.
     First, let us consider the efficiency factor. In any
conventional method of generating electric power from
heat, the efficiency of the engine increases with its
power rating. Thus in a large central power station ther-
mal efficiencies up to 42 percent are obtained, as com-
pared to efficiencies of only 10 percent for automobiles.
Conversely, all conventional methods of conv'erting heat
into electric power become less and less efficient as the
power rating decreases. In particular, as the power rat-
ing becomes smaller and smaller, the irreversible losses
through heat conduction become more and more serious.
Thermoelectric power generation is a non-conform-
ist to these general rules. Electric power is generated
directly by heat flow. The efficiency of a thermoelectric
power generator is determined solely by the Carnot cycle
and by the index of efficiency of the thermoelectric


JANUARY 1960


material, independent of the size of the generator. In
comparing the efficiency of standard steam generators
and thermoelectric generators, a critical power rating
exists below which the thermoelectric generator is more
efficient. This critical rating is rapidly increasing with
time.
     A second factor of which the engineer is well
 aware is the capital cost. There can be little doubt that,
 once thermoelectric technology is well developed, ther-
 moelectric power generators, with their complete ab-
 sence of moving parts, can be manufactured at a lower
 cost than their conventional counterparts. Many cases
 can be sited where capital cost is the dominating factor.
 Auxiliary power units are a good example. There are
 many diverse factors that are of importance in such
 special cases.
     What can be said for thermoelectric refrigeration?
 The actual theoretical development of the refrigeration
 systems has not been fully explained, but this process
 can be considered as the reverse of the power generating
 theory that was explained.
     As in the case of power generation we cannot fully
visualize the advantages of thermorefrigeration if we
look at the efficiency standpoint alone. The ability to
refrigerate small inexpensive units will be a great ad-
vantage to us all. Conventional cooling apparatus re-
quires complicated equipment such as compressors,
motors and cooling coils. Electronic refrigeration dras-
tically reduces the size and weight of cooling mechan-
isms since it can do the job directly. This means in the
ordinary 10 cubic foot refrigerator we would gain at
least a foot and a half of useable space.
     Regardless of the direct benefits we receive from
thermoelectric materials, the response to this challenge
will give us additional materials which will find appli-
cations in nearly every field of technology. More import-
ant still, the response to this challenge will result in a
much deeper understanding of solid state physics than
we now have. This response will lead physicists and
chemists to study types of materials about which they
would otherwise have never even dreamed. There can
be little doubt that society will reap rich benefits from
such new materials, other than the thermoelectric ap-
plication for which they were originally created. 0

                    MY ISLAND
             by Roland W. Schrecongost
The weary hours of time which I endure,
Are sometimes eased by little fish from the sea,
Which feed among the coral so quick and sure,
And seem to have no dread, nor fear of me;
But this small pleasure does not last for long,
For larger fish on smaller ones prey,
This is the law of nature, weak to strong;
And so they come, and chase these friends away.
The island trees are much too few and small,
To breach the wall made by the greedy sea,
Whose every wave takes from the little shore,
A grain of sand, alas, a part of me.
How shall I face the dark and angry sea,
When it at last returns to claim its own;
And then my island will no longer be;
And I can not again abide alone?


HOLDEN'S ODE TO STRADLATER
                  By Allan Hinkel
You stand before your mirror so long,
A peacock picture of vanity,
God's gift to women, a young Adonis,
I'm beginning to doubt your sanity.
Your sex life is a masterpiece
You find no struggle ensuing
While others only sit and talk,
You find yourself out doing.
You're taking out a girl I knew
Wining, Dining and Dramas
While I sit here, writing your theme,
Misplacing all the commas.
Your personality is surpassed by none,
You've got a line of balony.
You're an accomplished whiz at everything.
But I still think you're a phony.

    Last year Prof. Daniel Marder presented an unusual
assignment to his English 40 class, a class in literature
primarily for engineers. As a take home final the class
was asked to produce verse stimulated by their thoughts
and feelings about J. D. Salinger's novel, A CATCHER
IN THE RYE. Presented here is a brief summary of the
novel and a few of the papers submitted.


    A summary of THE CATCHER IN THE RYE
                  by Robert Heeps
     THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is the story of
Holden Caulfield's search for integrity. Holden despises
life at Pency Prep, which he calls a school of "phonies."
The phonies include Ackley, an unkempt bad-smelling
neighbor, Stradlater, a big man on campus who makes
Holden write his compositions and, in turn, dates his
girl, and Mr. Spooner, Holden's well-intended but in-
effectual teacher. Unable to cope with the falseness sur-
rounding him, Holden is expelled, fights with Stradlater,
and heads for New York City. Here he encounters
people with dubious backgrounds, and a variety of
unsympathetic friends. He can find consolation only in
innocence, in Pheobe, his younger sister, and Allie, his
dead brother. His immaturity and frustration finally
lead him to a mental institution, and are reflected in his
concern for the winter whereabouts of Central Park
ducks. He thinks himself the catcher of innocents when
they fall out of the rye field and over the cliff.





                  SOUL SONG
                  by Vince Manfredi
Sand and sea
Sing softly
At sundown
When lonely wisps
Humbly advance
To make
Evening Supplication
At their earth altar.


All day
Adoration waves
Strive to reach
A strange and unknown
Way to be
But somehow slip
And slide
Again
Sea-ward

Like the waves
I strive to touch
My altar star
I strain.
And when exultantly
I stretch to touch-

And almost reach-
Its surface
I slip,
And slide
Again
Soul-ward






                  DISSIPATION
                  by John F. Held
This fellow had a juvenile brain
He acted like a soul insane.
He wandered as if he had no aim
Bodily weak, mentally lame.

He had an eye for many a dame,
One in particular, name of Jane.
Fighting for her he was maimed
And later found it was all in vain.

Sick and confused to the city he came
Seeking not fortune, seeking not fame.
On a world full of "phonies" he placed the blame
Is he different from them, or is he the same?

To solve his great problem we finally see
We must all remain children, and innocent be.


          THE CATCHER IN THE RYE
               by James Czesnakowski
The Catcher in the Rye
Is a best-selling book,
About a teen-age boy,
And opinions he took.


He believes that this world,
Is one populated
By two definite groups,
In no way related


The one sect are phonies,
Just pretending to be
Many things they aren't,
Fakes of humanity.

Half-phonies are people who
Comprise the second sect.
They're honest and sincere,
And hold their heads erect.

The half-phonies are few,
And quite far between,
While phonies are many,
And quite easily seen.

One can sit and ponder
The wisdom of this boy,
Who sees the difference
In the real and the alloy.



          MY PSYCHOANALYSIS
                  by Don Donley
I'd like to psychoanalyze myself, I really would
And if I tried I really think I could.
Some say I'm a schitz and a little manic too,
Boy, those morons slay me, I mean they really do.

I'm over sexed because I think girls are really great,
And anything in this world I particularly hate;
It's a bore
God, it's a chore
To listen to those princes chat
And just about themselves at that.

I know I don't apply myself to each and every study,
But it's simply because every stinkin' school's been
    cruddy.
As far as friends go, I mean I'm not a snob,
But those Ivy Leaguers really slay me, my God!

I'm very immature you see, that is for my age,
But I don't see any sense to engage
A psychoanalyst.
It just takes some prince with a lot of guts
To come right out and tell me I'm just God Damn nuts!!

   Two drunk engineers, after a
night out, found themselves lost
and were walking along a railway
line.
  "These are the longest stairs I've
ever climbed," said one.
  "Oh, it's the low hand-rails that's
been bothering me," replied the
other.

            * * *

  "Darling," said the wife to her
husband, who was sitting with his
local paper and pipe by the fire, "I
left my watch upstairs."
  "All right, my love, leave it there,"
said the idle man, "it'll run down in
time."


   After a rather wild date with a
 charming young lady, her escort, a
 bit worried, asked: "Do you tell
 your mother everything you do?"
   She looked up and said: "Cer-
 tainly not. Mother doesn't care. It's
 my husband who's inquisitive."

 because I forgot my watch and
 there's no clock in this hall.

   Boarder: It's  disgraceful, ma-
 dame. I'm    sure two rats were
 fighting in my bedroom last night.
   Madame: What do you expect

   The psychiatrist was testing the
 intelligence of a hopeful candidate
 for dis,charge from the asylum.
   Doc: "What would happen if I
 cut off your ear?"
   Joe: "I couldn't hear."
   Doc: "And if I cut off the other
 ear?"
   Joe: "I couldn't see."
   Doc: "Why?"
   Joe: "Because my hat would fall
 over my eyes."

             * * *

   They had a quarrel and now she
 whimpered, "You don't love me any-
 more. I'm going back to Mother."
   "Don't bother," he said, packing
his bags; "I'll go back to my wife."

  The guy was walking down the
street dressed only in a barrel when
a cop; stopped him.
  "Are you a poker player?" asked
the law.
   "Not me," replied the character,
 "but I just left a couple of guys who
 are."

   There are only two kinds of
 parking left on the campus-illegal

   Guest: "Why does your dog keep
 watching me like that."

  E. E. "Drink broke up my home."
  Chem. E. "Couldn't stop it?"

  Then there's the story about the
girl that bet the gambler he really
wouldn't marry her: he called her
bet and raised her five!



   During a fervent revival service
at the local church, a lovely young
lady seated in the balcony became
so wrought up with the spirit of the
occasion that she leaned out too far
over the rail and fell. The hem of her
dress happened to catch on the
chandelier and she was held sus-
pended in mid-air.
   The thoughtful minister cried out,
 "Any man who dares look will be
 stricken blind!"
   And a fellow in a front seat said
to his friend, "I'm going to chance
one eye."

  A mild little man returned from
his wife's funeral on a very windy
and stormy day. He had just reached
his front door when a tile was blown
from the roof and hit him on the
head.
   "Wow!" he muttered as he hur-
 ried inside the house. "She's in
 heaven already."

Interview with General Electric's

Charles F. Savage

Consultant- Engineering Professional Relations




How Professional Societies


Help Develop Young Engineers


Q. Mr. Savage, should young engineers
   join professional engineering socie-
   ties?
A. By all means. Once engineers
   have   graduated  from   college
   they are immediately "on the
   outside looking in," so to speak,
   of a new social circle to which
   they must earn their right to be-
   long. Joining a professional or
   technical society represents a
   good entree.
Q. How do these societies help young
   engineers?
A. The members of these societies
   -mature, knowledgeable men-
   have an obligation to instruct
   those who follow after them.
   Engineers and scientists-as pro-
   fessional people-are custodians
   of a specialized body or fund of
   knowledge to which they have
   three   definite responsibilities.
   The first is to generate new
   knowledge and add to this total
   fund. The second is to utilize
   this fund of knowledge in service
   to society. The third is to teach
   this knowledge to others, includ-
   ing young engineers.
Q. Specifically, what benefits accrue
    from belonging to these groups?
A. There are many. For the young
    engineer, affiliation serves the
    practical purpose of exposing his
    work to appraisal by other scien-
    tists and engineers. Most impor-
    tant, however, technical societies
    enable young engineers to learn
    of work crucial to their own.
    These organizations are a prime
    source of ideas - meeting col-
    leagues and talking with them,
    reading reports, attending meet-
    ings and lectures. And, for the
    young engineer, recognition of
    his accomplishments by asso-
    ciates and organizations gener-
    ally heads the list of his aspira-
    tions. He derives satisfaction
    from knowing that he has been
    identified in his field.


Q. What contribution is the young en-
   gineer expected to make as an ac-
   tive member of technical and pro-
   fessional societies?
A. First of all, he should become
   active in helping promote the
   objectives of a society by prepar-
   ing and presenting timely, well-
   conceived technical papers. He
   should also become active in
   organizational administration.
   This is self-development at work,
   for such efforts can enhance the
   personal stature and reputation
   of the individual. And, I might
   add that professional develop-
   ment is a continuous process,
   starting prior to entering col-
   lege  and   progressing beyond
   retirement. Professional aspira-
   tions may change but learning
   covers a person's entire life span.
   And, of course, there are dues to
   be paid. The amount is grad-
   uated in terms of professional
   stature gained and should al-
   ways be considered as a personal
   investment in his future.
Q. How do you go about joining pro-
   fessional groups?
A. While still in school, join student
    chapters of societies right on
    campus. Once an engineer is out
    working in industry, he should
    contact local chapters of techni-
    cal and professional societies, or
    find out about them from fellow
    engineers.
Q. Does General Electric encourage par-
    ticipation in technical and profes-
    sional societies?
A. It certainly does. General Elec-
    tric progress is built upon cre-
    ative ideas and innovations. The
    Company goes to great lengths
    to establish a climate and in-
    centive to yield these results.
    One way to get ideas is to en-


   courage employees to join pro-
   fessional societies. Why? Because
   General Electric shares in recog-
   nition accorded any of its indi-
   vidual employees, as well as the
   common pool of knowledge that
   these engineers build up. It can't
   help but profit by encouraging
   such association, which sparks
   and stimulates contributions.
   Right now, sizeable numbers of
   General Electric employees, at
   all levels in the Company, belong
   to engineering societies, hold re-
   sponsible offices, serve on work-
   ing committees and handle im-
   portant assignments. Many are
   recognized for their outstanding
   contributions  by   honor   and
   medal awards.
   These general observations em-
   phasize that General Electric
   does encourage participation. In
   indication of the importance of
   this view, the Company usually
   defrays a portion of the expense
   accrued by the men involved in
   supporting the activities of these
   various organizations. Remem-
   ber, our goal is to see every man
   advance to the full limit of his
   capabilities. Encouraging him to
   join Professional Societies is one
   way to help him do so.
Mr. Savage has copies of the booklet
"Your First 5 Years" published by
the Engineers' Council for Profes-
sional Development which you may

      The Failure of Finals








   The final examination "system" was the worst failure of the first trimester. A
few of the results of this not-too-welcome Christmas present were the loss of a letter
grade, a near nervous breakdown, and a week of sleepless nights for many students.
    There were many reasons for the resounding disapproval given by the students
to the final system. Since most students have the habit of sleeping, they found that
they hadn't the time to properly prepare for the scholastic "festivities" of the last
week of the trimester.
     If final examinations were the only consideration with which the students had
to concern themselves during the last week of school, there would have been no
problem involved or dissatisfaction voiced. Regardless of how well a student keeps
up with his work during the trimester, he must spend many hours going back over
the details in a course that have become hazy between the beginning and end of the
trimester. Such a job becomes quite difficult when this studying process must be
repeated for at least four other courses.
     Why, then, were the burdens of regular classes, labs, lab reports, homework and
regular trimester examinations included in a week that is difficult enough with
final examinations alone?
     It is well known that a university, in order to be fully accredited, must have
a minimum number of hours of instruction per term. The trimester has cut the
number of hours very close to the minimum. I doubt if anyone would want to see
Pitt dropped from the group of accredited universities, but I see no reason to place
undue hardships on the students.
     At the present time, there is no concrete policy for final examinations. The
individual schools and departments last trimester had the option to give or not to
give finals, as they saw fit. This was another shortcoming of the past arrangement.
Some departments inaugurated a policy of two, one hour finals on succeeding class
days, while other departments gave one hour tests on the last day that the class met,
while still others gave no finals at all. This variation in policy led to confusion on
the part of the students, and the realization that they had as many as three finals
on each of two successive days.
     I hope that this unfortunate situation is not repeated at the end of the spring
 trimester, but it will be unless the administration sets up some policy that must be
 followed by the entire school. There can be only two possibilities. We could revert
 to the old system of the final week which was devoted only to tests. In this way the
 faculty would still have the opportunity to give finals and yet, the students would
 have sufficient time to study for them. If finals had to be administered this would
 be the ideal plan, but a final week may limit the hours of instruction to a point
 below the minimum allowable for an accredited institution. The only logical plan
 left for the University would be the enforcement of a plan advocated by many prom-
 inent educators, the complete elimination of final examinations..

                     BENDIX WATCHES THE UNIVERSE

(... and offers unlimited opportunity for young scientists)


Bendix@ Radar is one of the free
world's major safeguards against
sneak attack. Night and day Bendix
radar stations are keeping constant
watch all over the globe, alert
against aggression. In radar and
other technological fields, Bendix is
doing outstanding work. And the
scope of Bendix activities provides
young engineers and scientists excep-
tional chances for advancement.
  Take the field of radar alone.
Bendix has had much to do with
the development of radar from the
earliest pioneering of systems and
equipment,.and today is a foremost
producer of many different types
S. . on land, at sea, and in the air.
Our airborne radar, for example, is
used by more commercial aircraft


than any other system. It helps
safeguard air travelers by "seeing"
storm turbulence as far as 150
miles ahead, allowing pilots to make
course corrections to avoid bad
weather.
  Another example is Bendix
Doppler Radar which for the first
time allows pilots to determine exact
position, ground and wind speeds-
without manual calculation. This
system is being placed in service by
major airlines for both domestic
and trans-oceanic flights.


  The many diversified projects in
which Bendix is engaged offer the
young college graduate an unparal-
leled opportunity to grow as Bendix
grows.., in such fields as electronics,
electromechanics, ultrasonics, com-
puters, automation, nucleonics,
combustion, navigation, hydraulics,
instrumentation, propulsion, metal-
lurgy, communications, solid state
physics, aerophysics, structures,
and, of course, radar.
  Put Bendix in your post-gradu-
ate plans. Consult your placement
director about campus interview
dates or write to Director of Uni-
versity and Scientific Relations,
Bendix Aviation Corporation, Fisher
Building, Detroit 2, Michigan. It
will be well worth your while.

                   NOTES



  ith this the first issue of the new
year and the new trimester, SKY-       Fred Harm
SCRAPER ENGINEER brings you
an array of articles designed to in-
terest both the technical and the
non-technical reader.
  On the technical side, "Barrier To
Space?" by Richard P. Johnston
treats a phenomenon encountered in
the recent rocket explorations of
space. The article tries to clarify the
question of whether radiation belts
existing in space will deter man in
his attempts at space travel. The
technical aspects of this phenomenon
are being investigated by scientists
analyzing   the  telemetered   data
from our earth satellites.
   Closer to the ground, scientists are
investigating another phenomenon
associated with travel. "Supersonic
Thunder", by Professor C. Yates,
Head of Aeronautical Engineering
Option at the University of Pitts-
burgh tells about the investigation of
Sonic Boom. Aircraft traveling at


speeds greater than sound cause a
loud thunderclap sound audible on
the ground. This nuisance is being
studied from several viewpoints to
determine its exact cause and its ef-
fect on future air travel.
  "Electronics in a Nutshell" by
Russell Krill describes the recent
trend  to  microminiaturization  of
electronic components which began
on a commercial scale with the in-
troduction of the transistor. This
trend is being accelerated by the




need for miniature components in
our space vehicles and by the need
for compact, dependable communi-
cations facilities for the   armed
forces.
  A major problem in industry to-
day is that of designing instruments
and controls for accurate control by
their human operators. Read how
this problem   is investigated and
overcome in "Human Engineering",
by Earl L. Seiler. In his article Earl
gives an intriguing insight into the
scientific and phychological aspects
of design used in the instrumentation
of every field of engineering and
science.
  A system of obtaining electricity
dlrectiy from heat is discussed in
"Practical Thermoelectricity", by
Fred Harm. Through this system it
is possible that in the future, waste-
ful heat exchangers, turbines and
generators will no longer be neces-
sary. With the requirement for more
electrical power skyrocketing each
year, a system of electric power gen-
eration much more efficient than
present methods will have to be de-
vised. Thermoelectricity may be the
long sought answer.
  It is a well known fact that many


Richard Johnston


top executives in industry have en-
gineering backgrounds. Read how
engineering can be a path for you
toward one of these management
positions. John Barthen in "Engin-
eering-A Bridge to Management"
tells how you can prepare yourself
now, in your undergraduate years
for a future concerned with direct-
ing the activities of others.
   "Grades at a Glance" by James
 Brubaker tells about a pilot project
 being carried on by the Industrial
 Engineering Department at the Uni-
 versity of Pittsburgh concerned with
 the use of a computer to calculate
 the grades, standings, quality point
 averages and other pertinent data
 concerned with record keeping of
 the registrar's office. This new sys-
 tem could be the first step in the ef-
 fort to streamline registration to the
 point where this heretofore formid-
 able experience would be reduced
 to a mere routine.
 This variety of articles, in addition
 to the regular features of SKY-
 SCRAPER ENGINEER, makes this
 the first issue of the spring trimester
interesting and informative to the
engineer and the non-engineer alike.
