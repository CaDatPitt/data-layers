Stewart has an enormous amount of respect for the student
with enough honesty to admit that he is terrified of his class.
With this knowledge, he can effectively help the student get
through the course.

The teachers’ viewpoint of what it takes to be a good
student is very revealing yet very succinct. Be honest with
yourself. Only you can judge what the limit of your abilities
is. You must be able to admit that you could have done bet-
ter when you don't give the proper effort. On the flip side,
realize that you probably won't get a 4.0 grade average. Take
satisfaction in putting forth the effort to do your best, not in
the results of that effort.

At a university the size of Pitt, a good student can be
hindered by the large class size and the lack of personal at-
tention. A student needs to have the maturity to take the
responsibility for their own education. The counsel and help
is there, but it won't come looking for you. You have to make
sure you get the maximum out of the university.

Some lectures are given to hundreds of students at the
same time in a large university. It seems unlikely that you
could have much personal interaction with the professor in
this situation. However, this problem can be overcome. Dr.
Kuhn suggests the use of the teaching assistants who are in-
volved with the course. In many cases, you will have a
teaching assistant in charge of the lab or recitation connected
with the class and there will be a small number of students
in each group. Dr. Stewart feels that you can effectively shrink
the_size of the university by making friends with people of
similar interests. Small group study can help answer your
questions and be enjoyable at the same time. Dr. Stewart
remarks, ”Seek academic advice widely: from people who
are seriously interested in education as well as in their
specialized disciplines.” The advice exists in a myriad of
places, but the student must take the initative to find it.

Most classes have reasonable lecture sizes. In these situa-
tions, the teachers are adamant in the position that the in-
structor needs feedback. The professor can greatly profit from
knowing exactly what is good and bad about the course they
are teaching. Air your concerns. Dr. Kuhn advises the
students to get answers to all their questions. Seek out the
instructor after class and make sure you understand the
material. Don't be afraid to miss your next class because you
tried to have your questions answered. Nobody really cares
whether you miss the first part of a lecture anyway. The notes
are easy to duplicate. Shyness is no excuse for not understan-
ding the material. A certain amount of aggressiveness is re-
quired for you to get the most out of your education. Every
professor is required to have office hours, so take advantage
of them.

Professors do not expect a good student to study every
minute of every day. Develop your other interests, because
you will never again have the opportunity to pursue them
so easily. Take time to explore and debate issues. Take ad-
vantage of the vast athletic facilities. Make an effort to grow
spiritually and emotionally. Dr. Stewart points out that col-
lege is surprisingly responsibility free. Students tend to get
caught up in the day to day tensions and pressures of school.
However, Dr. Stewart points out that college provides many
second chances. The beginning of each term is a chance to
start over. Nobody cares what you did before that term. This

Dr. G. Alec Stewart, director of the University Honors
Center

can add confidence and should relax the student when view-
ed in this manner because nothing has to be treated as a life
or death situation. i

The professors have demanding standards for
themselves. A good teacher has the ability to motivate
students to learn. This is a two sided issue because both the
student and the professor need to be putting forth an effort
for the educational experience to succeed. Good teaching
is not just the ability to clearly express one’s ideas. It involves
the ability to relate the relevance of the material to the stu-
dent along with the instructor’s personal enthusiasm for it.
Dr. Stewart stresses that a good class is not a blow off class
where you can get an easy A. He says, ”Take classes from
faculty with high expectations, individuals who will force
upon you the satisfaction of attainment through personal
effort.”

Dr. Stewart would like to stress the human side of the
professor. Far too often, we look upon the professor as the
person who makes a personal judgment about us. In reality,
the grade they assign to us is based on the facts of our own
performance and not any personal judgment. Be able to look
at the instructor as a person and not in any other way. Don't
be intimidated by the amount of education a professor has.
We all have faults and shortcomings. Dr. Stewart advises the
student to make friends with a few faculty members. As the
saying goes, one must first be a friend before he can have
a friend. This requires the student to take the initiative to in-
volve him socially as well as academically with an instruc-
tor. An instructor who is also your friend can advise you
much more accurately than he or she could under a purely
academic relationship. Dr. Stewart feels the instructor is flat-
tered when a student shows friendship and not insulted or
upset.

No matter what path you take through life, there will
always be hardships and difficulties. College is no excep-
tion. To overcome these problems, the instructors have sim-
ple advice to the student. Make good friends to help each
other through, be honest with yourself, and have confidence
in yourself. Everyone has to adapt to new situations, so ex-
pect it and don't worry about it. As the professors stressed,
you can only do your best. Finding that level and then achiev-
ing at that level is what makes one a success.

 

Books you may have missed

by Andrew Szeri

In the second article of the series we shall look at an
amusing character study by W. Somerset Maugham. The
book is entitled Ashenden after the main character and details
some of the adventures of a spy during the first world war.
The stories are based on Maugham’s own life, he writes in
the preface, when he was an agent of the British Govern-
ment trying to stop the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.

The cast of characters consists of Ashenden, a somewhat
self—absorbed writer/agent in search of good material; R., his
superior in the intelligence department, possessed of a
shrewd mind and dry wit; and certain very colorful characters
incidental to the particular episodes of the book. We learn
most about Ashenden when he is alone and reflective.
Maugham allows us to hear his thoughts and in this way we
gain insight into his personality. There is a hilarious scene
in which Ashenden debates whether or not to call an end
to his bath: ”Ashenden sighed, for the water was no longer
quite so hot; he could not reach the tap with his hand nor
could he turn it with his toes (as every properly regulated
tap should turn) and if he got up enough to add more hot
water he might just as well set out altogether. On the other
hand he could not pull out the plug with his foot in order
to empty the bath and so force himself to set out, nor could
he find in himself the will—power to step out of it like a man.
He had often heard people tell him that he possessed
character and he reflected that people judge hastily in the
affairs of life because they judge on insufficient evidence:
they had never seen him in a hot, but diminishingly hot,

bath.” You shall be glad to know that presently there was
a knock at Ashenden’s door that forced him to get out of his
bath. It is this type of characterization to the point of
caricature that keeps the reader's interest throughout the
book.

There are a few subtle and entertaining exchanges bet-
ween R. and Ashenden that are flavored with an underlying
spirit of friendly competition. Read how Ashenden notes one
of R.’s very few faults, R. begins: ” ’One wonders how an
able man like that can allow himself to get besotted over a
woman. It is the last thing I ever expected of him.’ Ashenden’s
eyes travelled to that bowl of beautiful roses that stood on
the table, but he said nothing. R. who missed little saw the
glance and his look suddenly darkened.” Earlier in another
conversation, R. suffers the sometimes obnoxious sarcasm
of his subordinate when he foolishly begins by asking
Ashenden if he likes macaroni. Ashenden answers: ” ’I like
all simple things, boiled eggs, oysters and caviar, truite au
bleu, grilled salmon . . . But of all simple things the only
one I can eat day in and day out, not only without disgust
but with an eagerness of appetite unimpaired by excess, is
macaroni.’ ’I am glad of that because I want you to go to
Italy.’ ” R. retorts. This kind of playful exchange is always
present when R. and Ashenden meet and provides for an in-
teresting, dynamic conversation that is enjoyable to read.

As well as R. and Ashenden, there are several exotic,
ridiculous secondary characters that appear in one or more
episodes of the book. In one story an Italian dancer named
Giulia Lazzari worked as a spy for Berlin and her Indian lover,
who happened to be brilliant saboteur. Ashenden’s task was
to force the dance; to flush the Indian from his cover and
kill him. We come in as this dramatic scene draws to a close;
Giulia Lazzari is profoundly depressed because she has been
forced to betray her lover: ”Giulia Lazzari had thrown herself
on the bed and turned her face to the wall. Her body was
shaken with hysterical sobs . . . ’One little moment’, she said.
’There is one thing I should like to ask. I think you have some
heart.’ . . . Then she said something that confounded
Ashenden. It was the last thing he expected. ’He had a
wristwatch that I gave him last Christmas. It cost twelve
pounds. Can I have it back?’ ” Throughout the book,
Ashenden seems to be besieged by such people that he does
not understand.

I have not the space to discuss Maugham’s cool, urbane
style nor to give examples of his ingenious twists of plot.
These aspects only serve to enhance an already excellent
book. Between the anguish of midterms and the terror of
finals, allow yourself a few hours of chuckling. Read W.
Somerset Maugham’s Ashenden.

On Getting a Job:

A Simple Approach

10

by John Gargani

To any loyal pragmatist the only purpose of a college
education is to help that person secure a high paying job.
Most of us do not look at our university days in this light.
Rather, I should say that most of us are merely in its shadow.

The monetary incentives of an engineering discipline
often drive many students into becoming a chemical engineer
as opposed to becoming a teacher. As a result, the quest for
a well paying job is often on the minds of all engineers.

Presently, graduating seniors are furiously typing out
resumes, sending cover letters, and sweating through
interviews. Since I am merely a sophomore, I lack the ability
to empathize with these individuals. I am, however, capable
to comprehend the underclass struggle for employment.

At the University of Pittsburgh the main tool that
underclassmen may use in their battle is the Student Employ-
ment Service located on the second floor of the recently
renovated William Pitt Union (a.k.a. Schenley Hall). The pro-
cedure involved is often obscured by the ignorance of those
individuals who are to be served by it.

The first step involved in using this agency is to set up
an appointment to speak with a counselor. To do this mere-
ly follow the triangular waveform on the adjacent map. (Only
the average value of the waveform need be followed, so as
not to stagger back and forth.) Once there, you will be given
a green card which must be filled out. Also you will make
arrangements to meet a counselor at a later date. The first
step is now complete. To leave the office retrace your
footsteps. If you forget your footsteps follow the same,
triangular waveform.

00m 200

The next step is a little more complicated. You have to
fill out that green card which you were given in step one.
The card is basically self explanatory with questions rang-
ing from name to address. While you have the typewriter
in front of you you might as well type out your resume. A
well—written resume includes such bits of information as
name, address, interests, and experience, among other useful
topics. An example of a resume can be found on page six-
teen of the University of Pittsburgh Placement Handbook
which can be picked up on the second floor of the Union.
If you are satisfied with your resume take it to any of the
numerous copying centers in Oakland and make about ten
photocopies on resume paper. Resume paper is of a higher
quality than the usual copying paper. At this point you are
prepared for your interview..

Your interview will take place in the same suite where
you set up your appointment (follow the triangle wave). It
is not necessary to stay at the office overnight. Merely arrive
at the time of your scheduled appointment. Remember to
bring the card and your resumes with you. Once there you
will meet with one of the counselors. He will describe to
you exactly what is entailed in‘ the employment service. He
will ask you if you have any questions. Don't be afraid to
ask, the counselors are extremely well mannered. You then
should leave the office, once again retracing your footsteps.

The basic process which should have been described
to you by the counselor is fairly simple. On a regular basis,

at least once a week, you should check the board on the
second floor to see if there are any interviewers coming on
campus. Little sheets of white paper are posted along the wall
describing all recent job openings. To get to this board follow
the square wave. If one of these openings interests you, write
down the number from the sheet and take it into the employ-
ment office. They will then give you an interview with that
particular company. If all interview spots are taken, you will
be placed on the waiting list for that interview.

If you get tired of waiting around biting your nails you
have a very helpful outlet for your frustration. The placement
service of the university provides a non-circulating employer
library which contains a great deal of information on a myriad
of companies. In all likelihood there will be some informa-
tion on the company with which you have your interview.
That way when your interviewer asks you why you want to
work for his company you can give a very logical reason,
whether true or otherwise. The straight line (D.C. waveform)
is the path which will lead you to this library.

Well the big day finally arrives, the day of your first in-
terview. If you have followed all of the above steps you
should have no problem. Just show up at the appointed time,
well dressed and with an optimistic attitude. The interview
should last for about thirty minutes. It will take place in the
interviewing suite which is right off of the employer library
(just follow the sine wave on the map). After that go home
and wait for those job offers to come pouring in.

Don’t Panic!

It’s only an exam . . .

by Joe Samosky and Steve F rezza

Exam tomorrow! Here it is, nine o'clock in the evening and
I still have three sections to learn for tomorrow’s test, let
alone the rest of the chapter to review. I wish I hadn’t put
this off for so long but I just have to work hard now. I notice
a slight tightness in my stomach as I work on into the night,
gradually assimilating information and trying to make sense
of it all. I catch myself rhythmically shaking my foot on
several occasions. I finally finish at about one o’clock, and
drop into bed, my mind filled with rules and equations. It
takes a little longer than usual for me to fall asleep.

”We can dance if we want to, we can leave this world
behind . . .” I quickly shut off the alarm clock and turn down
the music. I’m wide awake and out of bed in much less time
than I normally take. I’m especially careful packing my
backpack, making sure that all ofmy pencils are sharpened
and taking a few extra. I double check that I have my
calculator. These things seemed so insignificant yesterday
morning. I notice that tightness returning to my stomach.

The morning goes quickly and I head for the cafeteria
for lunch. I don't seem to be as hungry today, though, and
I don’t eat as much as usual. After lunch I read over my notes
and write up the sheet we are allowed to bring with us to
the exam. I’m really not well prepared for this test, but I'll
just try to do the best that I can.

It's about an hour before the exam and I meet with some
friends to study. Everybody has last minute questions. I find
myself moving around a lot, pacing back and forth. We will
agree that our minds are buzzing; a friend describes that he
feels as if his perceptions were moving in slow motion. My
stomach feels really tight, my heart is beating faster and my
hands feel cold. It’s time to go now.

I go to the bathroom first and then to the exam. After
sitting in my desk, I carefully arrange pencils, erasers and
caluclator on the seat next to me. I look about and see a
lot of leg shaking and finger tapping. I feel a need to make
light of the situation and I joke with my friends near me.
My hands are really cold and I can feel my heart beating
stronger and faster. The instructor enters with a stack of
exams and a hundred eyes follow him as he walks to the
front of the room. He stands surveying the class. Why doesn’t
he just get on with it? Finally, he begins passing out the test
booklets. It seems to take forever for him to reach me. I get
the book, quickly pass the rest on down the row and begin
work.

My whole attention is focused on an 8V2 by I 7 inch rec-
tangle in front of me. I’m annoyed by the announcements
the instructor begins making. A while later, I start to relax
as I successfully complete the first problem. The others look
rather familiar too, and my hands begin to warm up. My

12

heart rate has slowed down also. The exam is completed
and I hand it in, pack up my belongings and leave. I've
perspired a lot during the test and I feel very hungry. I meet
with some ofmy friends and everyone is talking about what
answers they got, which answers they didn’t get, and how
much they don't care now that the test is over. My thinking
seems to have returned more to normal, but my mind feels
blank and almost dazed. The group of us talks and laughs
and decides to set off to devour as much pizza as we can
hold.

An almost universal experience among college students
at some point in their academic lives is the physical feelings
of stress resulting from an examination. In our modern society
there are many common events which can lead to varying
degrees of stress in an individual. The pressures of a job,
financial worries, difficulties in personal relationships, public
speaking and performance in musical, theatrical or athletic
events are all situations that can be accompanied by physical
symptoms of stress. Among students, examinations are fre-
quently a cause of what can be termed ”nervous tension.”
The amount of stress generated by an exam varies greatly
from individual to individual and can vary greatly at different
time for the same person. Specific factors, such as the relative
importance of the exam to the student and the degree of the
student's preparation, can obviously affect the situation. But
what is the origin and nature of this type of physical stress?

In order to answer this question, some of the
physiological aspects of the human nervous system must be
examined. Those activities of the human body which are not
normally under conscious control are regulated by the
autonomic nervous system. These functions include
breathing, acceleration and slowing of the beating of the
heart, movement of the muscles of the stomach and
intestines, constriction of peripheral blood vessels and
regulation of the pupil of the eye. The autonomic nervous
system may be divided into two complementary parts: the
sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous
system. The action of the sympathetic nervous system affects
physiological changes commonly associated with fright or
physical injury, including increased heart rate and blood
pressure, interruption of the normal peristaltic motion of the
stomach and intestine, constriction of the blood vessels in
the extremities and a general feeling of ”nervousness.”
Physical feelings accompanying situations such as an
examination can be linked to a general increase in activity
of the sympathetic nervous system. Increased action of the
parasympathetic system, on the other hand, affects just the
reverse of the above changes, and leads to a generally more
relaxed condition.

Dr. Edward M. Stricker, a Pitt professor with appoint-
ments in Biology, Psychology and Psychiatry and also co-
director of a psychobiology research group at Pitt, offers some
insights into the above processes. As Dr. Stricker explains,
it was once believed that the sympathetic nervous system
worked only during emergencies, producing the so—called
’fight-or-flight’ response. For example, when an animal is at-
tacked, the effects of the sympathetic nervous system prepare
the animal for physical action: constriction of peripheral
blood vessels and the slowing of digestional processes allows
blood to be diverted to other organs and major muscle groups
where it is more urgently needed. Increase in heart rate and
respiration further assist the animal in quick physical
mobilization. in such situations, these physical effects are
an important, even life-saving function.

Our current understanding of the autonomic nervous
system, however, is that while it is true that the sympathetic

The arrows indicate the pathway of the sympathetic
response to psychological stress. Note the dual innervation
of most organs by the parasympathetic system as well, the
action of which opposes the stress reaction.

system works under these severe conditions, it also functions
under normal (basal) conditions. Dr. Stricker explains further,
’’It is understood today that the sympathetic nervous system
is chronically on, not simply to deal with stress, but as part
of the fine tuning of the peripheral organ systems. With this
knowledge has come an additional insight that there is a way
of turning on the sympathetic nervous system not simply with
an acute emergency or strong stimulation such as pain or
severe cold, but with an idea. The observation has been made
that a thought originating in the cerebral cortex can com-
municate down to the hypothalamus and thereby activate
the sympathetic nervous system.” The hypothalamus is a
region of the brain located near the pituitary gland which
serves many functions, among which are the synthesis of
hormones and the control of body function such as
temperature regulation and blood pressure.

This connection between conscious thought and
autonomic activity through the hypothalamus is the basis of
the sympathetic physical reaction to psychological stress. Dr.
Stricker continues, ”When you're talking about stress, you're
talking about what individuals believe about exams, rather
than something that is intrinsically stressful. There's nothing
that's intrinsically stressful about sitting down and writing
an exam, it's just that if you think that the exam is important
to your career or to your continued scholarship support or
to whether you're going to finish college — that suddenly
makes the exam much less trivial. But that's not a product
of the exam, but of the individual and his perception of the
exam. There's nothing about the exam that's akin to pain or
to a bear chasing you.”

A question that now presents itself is why physical symp-
toms of stress are precipitated by thoughts or conscious
perceptions. Why does the brain drag the body into its
problems? Such physical reactions seem to do little to help
a person's situation, and frequently are the cause of
discomfort and further anxiety. However, it must be
remembered that while nervousness is an unwelcome
response to most current human problem situations, current
human problems and human society have evolved at a much
more accelerated pace than our bodies. ”A psychological
stress may be a relatively recent development in the evolu-
tion of mammals,” states Dr. Stricker. ”You can't really argue
that the many thousands of years of evolution have prepared
us to deal with contemporary society. Contemporary society
is a very new twist to human behavior.”

”There are circumstances that you can imagine in which
the brain should prepare the body. For example, an animal
that is trapped and perceives that it is trapped is going to
have to mobilize the body's energy reserves for some kind
of defensive action. It's better if they are mobilized before
the animal has to act, in anticipation of the fight-or—f|ight,
rather than once it actually begins to act. Such circumstances
are not the common stresses of human life and society, but
we have the machinery that has evolved to deal with one
sort of problem and now we're using it to deal with other
sorts of problems which have not been ”anticipated” by
evolution, so to speak. It's a nuisance now. In fact, it's more
than a nuisance, but a problem that can lead to frank disease,
such as hypertension. Hypertension (high blood pressure)

prevalent hundreds of years ago, much less thousands of
years ago.”

So it seems that our bodies are now the bearers of a
defensive weaponry which is becoming obsolete. As the prin-
cipal problems of human life become mental rather than
physical, sympathetic response to psychological stress may
serve more to hinder the individual than to help. But physical
stress is not an unavoidable unpleasant complication of to-
day's society and college life in particular. Steps may be taken
to reduce both the psychological conce_rns that can lead to
stress, and the magnitude of physical stress when it does
occun

The physical reactions to psychological stressors are the
concerns of such individuals as Linda Thompson, R.N., a
graduate student assistant who works in Pitt's Wellness
Resource Center. Linda's work includes running stress
management seminars for student groups, and providing
personalized stress management programs.

These programs focus on teaching the individual various
ways to relax, so that they can use those techniques in
reducing the physical effects that their (psychological) stress
has upon them. Four methods are taught in the individual
course, which usually takes four or five weeks to complete.

The first is a sort of deep breathing called Diaphramatic
Breathing. Normally when one takes a deep breath, the chest
muscles are used. The idea of using abdominal breathing is
to both help the abdominal muscles to relax and to let the
individual concentrate on his/her breathing and thus not so
much upon the concerns of the external world.

The second technique that is taught is a method called
Progressive Muscle Relaxation. Here groups of muscles are
progressively tensed and relaxed. By alternating between ten-
sion and relaxation, not only does one shift one’s concen-
tration from external things, but also one can identify what
groups of muscles are most affected by one’s psychological
stress. By tensing and relaxing your neck muscles, for
instance, you could easily tell if they were tensed to begin
with. The advantage of this is that it teaches a certain amount
of ability to relax muscles when necessary. Most of the
students who learned this method found this helpful in
controlling stress.

 

The third relaxation technique that is taught is a crude
form of biofeedback entitled Autogenic Training. In
Autogenic Training, a tape recorder or an assistant is required.
First, a small thermometer is taped to the finger. Then you
lie down and slowly read through a list of sentences such
as ’’I fell quite quiet (pause 1-20 seconds) I am beginning
to feel quite relaxed (pause) My feet, my ankles, my knees,
and my hips feel heavy, relaxed and comfortable (pause)”
and so on. During these pauses, you are to concentrate upon
the statement, and allow yourself to feel what that phrase
suggests. At the end of the exercise you should be completely
relaxed and should then slowly remove yourself from this
state before resuming normal activities.

The theory behind this procedure is that physical stress
tends to cause the blood to remain mainly within the central
trunk of the body. By relaxing, this process is reversed and
the blood vessels near the skin dilate, thus raising the skin's
temperature. The thermometer can then be used as a rough
guide to measure your success.

This method seems to be almost always helpful to some
degree in managing the body's physical responses to
psychological stress. Biofeedback is a technique which can
allow a person to gain some degree of control over the
autonomic nervous system by allowing a person to con-
sciously monitor some autonomic function such as skin
temperature or heart rate. Such techniques may be used to
control high blood pressure as well, and seem to work by
increasing parasympathetic nervous stimulation. Dr. Stricker
pointed out that such techniques can be valuable since once
a person learns how to affect his autonomic nervous
responses, he can learn to bring about those changes without
the external feedback, and, for example, learn to relax in an
exam setting or elsewhere. Stricker also explains that such
techniques are not really new, ”The people who meditate
a lot, the yogis who have been practicing this for centuries,
are not surprised by statements that you can change your
metabolism, or heart rate or blood pressure. They do that
all the time. What we're now learning is, in part, some of
the things that have been practiced by humans in a different
culture for a very long time. It's new to us, but it's not new.”

Of Men, Machines

and Shower Curtains

by Kevin Ryan

While taking classes this summer I lived in a rather run-
down boarding house. One morning, while stepping out of
the shower, I noticed that the shower curtain was falling
down. Since I knew that the boarding house was to be torn
down in September, cheap repairs seemed to be in order.
I thought about it for a bit, and remembered that some elec-
trical conduit was laying around. With some screws, a
hacksaw, and a little work, I could put up a new curtain rod.

After I got dressed I went by the bathroom again, to find
that Mike, one of the other people living in the house, had
already fixed the shower curtain. All he had done was to use
some speaker wire to support the existing curtain rod, a much
simpler solution. When I mentioned this to him, Mike, a com-
puter science major, replied,

”That’s what I hate about you engineers! You never do
anything the easy way. You always take the most complicated
answer to anyting.”

Mike now had my complete attention. I decided to find
out why he thought this.

”What do you mean, the most complicated answers to
anything?”

”I mean just that. No matter what you engineers do, you
always end up with a really complicated solution. You never
take the easy answer.”

At this time Mike and I entered into a half hour discus-
sion on the subject. When we were done I could see that
he had a point.

We discussed a couple of examples, including the cur-
tain rod incident. Mike is an active fraternity member (as am
I) and has worked on a lot of Greek Week projects. Every
time something has to be built the engineers working on it
come up with some monstrosity of a design. Meanwhile the
other people on the project build something completely dif-
ferent and much simpler. I had to agree with Mike on this;
I've seen some of those designs. Schedules and plans work-
ed out by engineers are complicated, and filled with
obsessive details.

I then asked Mike if there was some difference in the
way that engineers approach problem solving. The answers
that we came up with draw a lot from artifical intelligence
work. I think these answers are of interest to any engineer.

I5

Much of A.|. deals with problem solving techniques. A.I.
researchers have managed to classify several basic algorithms
of solution finding. The first one of interest is called depth
search. A depth search works like this.

A possible method of solution is posed. This method is
then worked out as a computation until it shows itself to
either work out or dead end. If this method works as a com-
putation, it’s applied. If not, another angle of attack is tried.

The second method that seems important to this
discussion is called breadth search. In this algorithm all
possible solutions are generated to one level of complexity.
Then all of these solutions are elaborated one level of com-
plexity at a time. When a level of complexity (or number
of steps) is reached where one of the solution works, that
solution is applied.

Both of these algorithms have their problems. The depth
search probably won't give the simplest answer, while the
breadth search wastes much time with solutions that aren't
used. there are also combination algorithms, with features

of both breadth and depth search. For example:

Possible solutions are posed. As each solution is posed,
it is examined to a present level of complexity. Ifthe solution
doesn't work within that limit, another solution is tried. If
all possible solutions are generated without reaching a
workable answer, start with the first possible solution and
elaborate to a deeper level of complexity. Repeat until a
workable solution is found.

Looking at these algorithms, it seems that the depth
search would be most likely to produce complicated
solutions. A reasonable assumption might then be that the
problem solving method engineers use is a type of depth
search. The solutions that engineers find tend to be overly
complex. So are the solutions produced by a depth search
method. This is not to say that the engineering technique is
a pure depth search, but that it's closer to that algorithm than
to the others. Why should that be?

A good place to look might well be the ”engineering
method.” Engineers are supposed to be extremely
methodical, to follow carefully planned methods of attacking
each problem. This is an absolute must. Engineers are often
given extremely ”hairy” problems, with dozens of variables

The motion inside the cylinder has
two components. Mean velocity
inﬂuences the transport of mo-

cylinder-wide scale, while the tur-
bulence component inﬂuences the
same phenomena on a local basis.
The in-cylinder ﬂow ﬁeld depends
primarily on the geometry of the
cylinder and inlet port. Hence, de-
cisions made in the engine design
stage exert a controlling inﬂuence
over the ﬂow. But before questions

answered, the problem of how to
measure the ﬂow must be solved.
By applying Laser Doppler Ane-
mometry (LDA), Dr. Rodney Rask,
a researcher at the General Motors
Research Laboratories, has ob-
tained detailed measurements of
the ﬂow ﬁeld.

LDA is a technique in which
two focused laser beams pass into
the cylinder through a quartz win-
dow. In the minute measuring re-
gion where the laser beams cross,
a regular pattern of interference
fringes is created. As the 1—micron
particles. which have been added
to the engine inlet ﬂow, cross the
measurement region, they scatter
light in the bright fringes. In Dr.
Rask's LDA system, the scattered
light is collected by the same
lenses used to focus the laser

beam. and measured by a photo-
multiplier tube. The resulting sig-

nal is processed electronically to

determine the time it takes a par-

ticle to traverse a ﬁxed number of
fringes. Since the fringe spacing is
a known function of the laser
beam crossing angle, this transit
time provides a direct measure of
velocity.

During operation of the
LDA, measurements of velocity as

a function of engine rotation (crank-
angle) are made at a number of lo-
cations within the cylinder. The in-

stantaneous velocity at each point
must then be separated into mean
and turbulence components. The
simplest technique is to declare
that the mean velocities for all
cycles are identical and ensemble
average the data. However, this

approach ignores the cyclic varia-

tion in the mean velocity. Another
technique looks at individual
cycles and uses a variety of
methods, including sophisticated
ﬁltering, to split the instantaneous
velocity into its components. This

of many different kinds. The only way to solve these pro-
blems is to grind along the solution algorithm until the
answers come out. The solution to an engineering problem
is almost never seen until a lot of work has been done. Other
possible algorithms don't just pop into mind. The successful
algorithms are the result of a lot of work.

This is the best way to solve engineering problems. The
good algorithms are hard to find, and you shouldn't waste
time reinventing the wheel every time you approach a pro-
blem. But what about problems of other kinds? What about
problems without prescribed solution algorithms?

Now the complicated solutions to easy problems appear.
Engineers are trained to solve very complicated problems
with explicit techniques. But engineers are NOT trained to
look for new methods of solution. This is left to Ph.D.’s and
math majors. When an engineer is confronted with a new
problem requiring mathematical solutions it's usually possi-
ble to make almost any solution method work. It may take
a lot of fudging and rigging, but the original angle of attack
will, eventually, work out.

The outcome of this is that unless an engineer is work-
ing on a problem that has a known solution method, the
engineer's answer to the problem is quite possibly more com-
plicated than it has to be. Less complex solutions may not
even be considered. This is really not good at all.

These, then, are the conclusions drawn from the
discussions Mike and I had. The way that engineers approach

16

new problems resembles a depth search, stubbornly work-
ing on one angle of attack until it works or dead ends. This
is quite likely to lead to overly complex answers to many
problems. This method of problem solving is a result of the
structure of engineering problems and the way students are
being taught. Engineering emphasizes the use of known
algorithms to solve every problem. The development or even
the consideration of new methods is left untouched.

I think, however, that the problem can be overcome. If
engineers are aware of this tendency, they can get around
it. When a new problem is first approached, an engineer
should stop and think. Is this something I can work out with
one of my engineering algorithms? If it isn't, some time
should be spent looking at various ways of solving the pro-
blem. The first idea that pops into mind probably isn't the
best one. This goes for engineering problems as well. If the
problem is a new one, with new technologies, many possible
solutions should be checked before getting too heavily into
any particular one. This will save a lot of effort in the long run.

I feel that something should be done about this problem
in engineering education. Student engineers should receive
instruction in how to develop algorithms in addition to how
to use them. Perhaps they could be given example problems
of a simple nature, and assigned the task of finding a solution
method for that class of problem. In the process they would
be given some criteria on how to evaluate the advantages
of different methods. This would give valuable practice in
how to generate analytic and design techniques. They could
be instructed in how to avoid the pitfall of charging blindly
ahead on new problems. In general, they could learn to look
for solutions before looking for anwers. It should be stress-
ed to them that this idea should be applied to all problems,
not just engineering. A good time to teach this might be in
one of the freshman introductory courses.

Further on in the engineering curriculum, courses should
spend at least a little time on how some of the major
algorithms were developed. It's now common for students
to be presented with a bunch of equations and told that the
proofs take too long. The proofs do take a lot of time, and
I'm not advocating pure theory courses. But a more even mix
between theory and practice should be possible. If the
students don't learn at least a little theory, it's going to be
very hard for them to invent new methods. In the meantime,
they could be shown a few methods that don't work well
to remind them that a workable solution isn't always the best
solution.

To sum things up, I feel that a normal engineering educa-
tion tends to fall short when new problems, in any area, are
encountered. Engineers have a tendency to plow ahead on
any problem, whether they know the simplest method or not.
Engineering doesn't teach people to look for alternate
methods, and this carries over to all parts of life. If, however,
engineers are aware of this tendency, they should be able
to overcome it. And the best place to learn something this
general is early on, in the introductory courses.

Perhaps it's time to add something to the engineering
method.

My thanks to Michael Pasternak for being the other half
of the discussion.

The fourth and last method that Linda teaches is the
Quieting (or Six Second) Response. This method involves
pausing whenever you feel tense or wish to relax. The idea
is to smile, to suggest to yourself that ’’I can leave my body
out of this,” then to take an easy, deep breath and breathe
out, allowing the body to go totally limp.

All of the techniques that are taught at the Wellness
Resource Center, located in Schenley Quadrangle across
from Brackenridge Hall, are meant to (as Linda put it) ”not
attack the sources of stress, but to deal with the physical
stress.” She refers people to the health center counseling
service if they want to deal with the sources of stress.

The causes of psychological stress are certainly
numerous, but more often than not relate to the importance
one places upon a particular issue or problem. The
counselors can help someone deal with the sources of this
stress by helping the individual to identify these issues and
evaluate the significance of each. By recognizing these
problems, one could possibly gain new insights into how
to make them less stressful for the individual.

One of the key aspects of dealing with stress is realizing
when a problem can exist and recognizing that it can be dealt
with either personally or professionally. People experienc-
ing physical stress should be aware that they are not alone
and that techniques of stress management that have helped
others are available for them to try. Perhaps just as impor-
tant though, at a fundamental level, are one’s general outlook
toward life and the college experience. An ability to cope
successfully with the daily stresses in one’s life is a big step
toward dealing with more highly pressured situations.
Remember that taking an exam is -not the same as having
a bear chase you, and that physical stress need not be an
inevitable aspect of college life. 3;

Skyscraper extends a hearty commendation to freshman
engineering student Paul Martinchick for his winning of the
October Skycaper prize. Paul is also the first person in recent
history to have solved correctly all 5 Skycaper questions.
Congratulations to Paul and all the other valiant efforts that
were received. The solutions to the October Skycaper are
as follows:

(1) Let ”Classes For The Term” represent the total length
of the race. Ronnie covers the first (Classes For The term)/2
miles at a speed of 37 miles per hour in a time T1 = ( (Classes
For the Term /2)/3 7. Let X equal his speed in the second half
of the race. He then covers the second half in a time T2 =
( (Classes for the Term/2)/X. His average speed is the total
distance divided by'the toal time (T1 + T2) and equals 73
miles per hour. This leads to the equation:

(Classes For the Term)
(Classes for the Term/2) (Classes For the Term/2)

37 + X

=73

The classes for the term are cancelled, and solving for X we
obtain X = 2701 mph.

(2) X,Y, and Z are integers. The prime factors of 187663
are 7, 17, 19, and 83. Therefore:
Y = 7 = number of children,
Z = (17) (19) = 323 = age of tree, and
X = 83 = age of the old man.

(3) 255, 349, 423, 522, 649, E, 849, 950, 1049,
1141, 1250. These are the room numbers of the first rooms
across the hall from the maintenance elevator on each floor
above the ground floor in Benedum Hall.

(4)1S2ON + 4CO3 + 2N2 O + 1H2SO4 + 1CHN4O2
yields 1H2O + SCNO2 + 2N2SO + 1SHO4 + 202
The sum of the coefficients is 20. This can be solved with
normal freshman chemistry procedures. However, one must
be very careful to find the minimum solution. To assure this,

M3 wrote a computer program that found all of the possible
solutions and chose the mimimal one from this set.

(5) In 1984, 1985, 1986, Sunday falls on the second day
ofthe month six times, the tenth day of the month five times,
and the nineteenth day of the month five times. There are

approach is consistent with the
LDA measurements, which clearly
show that the mean velocity does
not repeat exactly from one engine
cycle to the next.

Differences in the ﬁow ﬁeld
from one cycle to the next can
seriously compromise engine
efﬁciency. Near the end of the
compression stroke, it is important
to maintain a consistent velocity at
key cylinder locations (eg, at a
spark plug). Dr. Rask’s LDA mea-
surements have identiﬁed design
features that control cyclic varia-
bilit_v.

FIGURE 1 shows mean velocity

measured at a single location
during an engine cycle. High ve-
locity exists during the intake
stroke when the inlet flow is rush-
ing through the narrow valve
opening. This jet-like flow into the
cylinder causes large velocity
differences between adjacent cyl-
inder locations and produces
strong turbulence. As the end of
the intake stroke is approached
(180 degrees in Figure 1), the levels
of both mean velocity and turbu-
lence drop rapidly. This decrease is
a result of the changing boundary
conditions for the cylinder—from
strong inﬂow to no inﬂow. During
the compression stroke the ﬂow
ﬁeld evolves, but it undergoes no
drastic changes. However, in a
high-squish chamber, where the
flow is forced into a small bowl in

the piston or cylinder head, consid-

erable turbulence is generated
near the end of the compression
stroke.

. Measurements from many
cylinder locations are necessary to
make the flow ﬁeld understand-
able. Figure 2 shows four ﬂow pat-
terns covering a period from near
the end of intake into the compres-

By experimenting with geo-
metrical variables, Dr. Rask has
gained new understanding of phe-
nomena observed in operating en-
gines. The resulting knowledge
has guided the design and develop-
ment of new engines with a mini-
mum of trial-and-error testing.The
LDA ﬁndings are also being used
to validate and calibrate engine
flow computer models under devel-
opment.

"From our measurements,”
Dr. Rask states, "we have been able
to deduce how changes in the ge-
ometry of the port and combustion
chamber modify the velocity ﬁeld.
These flow ﬁeld effects are now
being used to help designers tailor
engine combustion for optimum
performance.”

Living the College Life:

Adaptation, Growth and

This article will attempt to generalize some of the
methods of adaptation used during the transition from high
school to college life. The reason for this generalization is
that the basic concepts can be shown to be applicable to
future transitions such as entering the work force, pursuing
a graduate education, or making a commitment through
marriage. The authors feel that the students interviewed
represent a diverse sample of the present enrollment in the
School of Engineering. In order to bring out the ways in
which students have adapted to college life a series of inter-
views were made with twelve students who reflected back
on their initial transition from high school to college.

In addition, two professors who have taught freshmen
courses as well as higher level courses contributed their in-
sights into the student’s adaptation process. Dr. Howard
Kuhn, director of freshmen programs for the engineering
school, and Dr. Alec Stewart, physics professor and director
of the University Honors Program, participated in Skyscraper
interviews. Their experience brings an intriguing perspective
into the issue of a student adapting to life's changes.

Experience Talks
by Dave Mahofski

The student interviews were designed to emphasize the
ways by which students adapted to the many problems which
they encountered in college life. The major change
highlighted in the interviews was that of the transition from
high school to college. The attitudes, self-confidence and
maturity which must be utilized in making the change are
used throughout life. Some of the adaptations of lifestyle
which enabled the students to benefit the most from their
educational experience will also be discussed.

In order to discuss the transition from high school to
college, we should first put ourselves back into the place of
a high school senior. As a high school senior many questions
arise while contemplating college. The following questions

Responsibility

were selected in order to determine better the nature of the
transition from high school to college life, and also to reveal
what methods those participating in our interviews used in
adapting to their new life. Remember that the questions deal
with the perspective of an incoming freshman and the inter-
viewees were recalling how they felt at that time in their lives.

What did you expect college to be like and were your
expectations realistic?

It is important that seniors in high school have realistic
expectations of college, but it seems more often than not that
the conceptions of college by high school seniors are
misconstrued. In relating high school seniors’ expectations
of college to what college really is like, there seems to be
a division into two main categories: those seniors who have
taken college prep courses and those who have not. The
students with college prep courses as a background had
much more realistic views of college than those from a less
co||ege—oriented enrironment. A major surprise to students
seemed to be the fact that in college it is the student's respon-
sibility to learn. If a student is having trouble with material,
it is his responsibility to seek out the professor to obtain help,
for the professor will not seek out the student. Another sur-
prise to many of the freshmen is the large class sizes. In high
school it is uncommon for classes to be larger than 40
students while in college it is seldom that a class exists that
is smaller than 40 students.

Once the student has proper expectations in mind, it
is important for him to define for himself or herself what
is a good learning situation. Therefore, in what type of en-
vironment do you benefit the most in learning new
material?

The initial response from all students interviewed was
that the ideal learning situation would be for one to have
a good teacher with a clear, understandable text book and
to keep up with all of the assignments. It is necessary to
describe what is meant by a good teacher. The general con-
census was that a good teacher is one who possesses the
ability to relate well with the class and to pace the class in
a manner that helps the students to learn the most material
without moving so fast that they are unable to comprehend
the subject matter. It is important that a teacher presents ex-
amples in class tying in the material with real world applica-
tions, for this helps to motivate the students. If the student
is motivated, he will be able to pay better attention in class
and do work on his own to enhance his knowledge. The

  

Rick Vannucci

teacher should stress important materials and key concepts
and spend less time on subjects that have a lesser degree
of importance. This many times cannot be done in engineer-
ing, for most of the curriculum is necessary and little waste
exists.

How do you feel about your education at Pitt so far?

The engineering education at Pitt is very challenging and
demands hard work from those who participate in it. The
opinions of students on the quality of their education at Pitt
vary somewhat. Most commented on its high quality while
some suggested a need for improvement in certain areas.
Many of the students at Pitt who were willing to compare
their education with that of their friends from other schools
found Pitt's to be comparable if not better. The comparisons
were made with Penn State, CMU, and Miami of Florida
among others. Some students offered constructive criticism
of the engineering curriculum, stating that it might be possible
to place more material that would help in real world
engineering applications, replacing classes such as
philosophy, political science or economics. When this idea
was presented to other students, objections were raised that
an engineer could not be as well rounded if he lacked ex-
posure to this material. Other students criticized the amount
of time some professors work on research. It was expressed
that some teachers would rather work on research as opposed
to working with students. At the same time, specific examples
were given of faculty members who work for the students
and are willing to go out of their way to help students. The
most conclusive evaluation of Pitt's educational program will
be a personal judgment made when each student leaves the
University and enters his chosen profession. Then he will
be able to determine the success of the preparation he
received at Pitt.

Confidence plays an important role throughout one’s life.
Many people interviewed started college with a high level
of confidence, soon suffered an initial drop, then slowly
gained back some of their self assurance. Others did not ex-
perience this initial drop but simply were able to maintain
their confidence level. After a few years of exposure to
college life most people can say that they have gained a
clearer perspective of their limitations. They believe that they
can now better apply themselves in working situations.

How did college change your lifestyle, if at all?

The main change which applies to almost every
freshman is that the amount of studying done in college in-
creases from the high school level. Studying soon becomes
as commonplace as eating and sleeping when looking at an
engineering student's daily routine. For a freshman to cope
with the added demand on his time, (time demanded by stu-
dying) he must become more organized, for it is important
that every student has set aside some time for social activity
and growth. Freshmen will soon see that their time allotted
to social activity will decrease in order for their study time
to increase. This trend makes it seem that one would lose
part of one’s social life — but actually, many feel that they

 

Laurel lamieson

  

now have a better quality social life as opposed to one of
quantity.

In making a transition from one setting to another, it is
important to make a successful adaptation to one’s new en-
vironment. One should be willing to reorganize his daily
routine and must be able to keep a proper perspective on
what he desires from life. In college, students develop a
method of how to learn and this method will become useful
throughout their career. During college life one develops
maturity, learns how to adapt and grows as a person. These
three points are essential to cultivating a person's character
and therefore a college is important not only for its
academics, but also as the environmenrin which these at-
tributes are developed.

Views from the Other Side of the Desk

by Mark McKrell

Students face many situations which are completely new
to them as they select the college they will attend. It is one
of the most important decisions a young person can make
and in most cases a very difficult one. All the schools seem
so impressive in the literature they send you. Many factors
go into your decision, but a motivated faculty should be a
high priority. They are the people who will prepare you to
meet life's challenges and can help you overcome the dif-
ficulties that confront you while at school.

Most of us who are presently in school can attest to the
fact that our problems didn't end when we selected our
school. At the University of Pittsburgh, the Engineering
School has developed a difficult and challenging curriculum.
At the freshmen level, the student must take calculus, physics,
chemistry, and two other courses in their first term.
Philosophy and English literature are taken as well as two
engineering courses which require extensive computer use.
The university has implemented the use of microcomputers
for its freshmen engineering class. This gives the student the
ability to use computer graphics. This is an‘ extremely useful
Capabilty because of the widespread use of computer aided

design in industry. All of this sounds very impressive, but
let's face it: It's hard. Fortunately for the students, most of
the faculty recognizes the degree of difficulty. Dr. Howard
Kuhn, who teaches freshmen engineering classes, recognizes
the difficulties, but feels the benefits far outweigh the disad-
vantages. He feels that an engineer learns how to think
analytically instead of learning by rote. He considers this to
be extremely important in all areas of life including those
which are not technically oriented. This includes law,
medicine, and political science. Analytical thinking is useful
in social situations as well.

Most of us experience some type of fear as we progress
in our education. The fear of failure can be positive in that
it drives us to success. But other types of fear should be ad-
dressed. Dr. Alec Stewart, a physics professor, is aware of
the fears students feel. Many times students fear a course
because they believe their abilities do not lie in this area,
but must take the course to fulfill a requirement in‘their
chosen field of study. Dr. Stewart feels that fear is an emo-
tion too often suppressed. We should articulate our fears and
in this way take the first steps toward overcoming them. Dr.
