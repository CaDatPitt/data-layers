Summer Job Sketches

Summer experience in an engineering position is invalu-
able to a student’: training before be aeeepts permanent
employment. This past summer, Pitt engineering students
worked over 5,000 miles apart at widely-z/aried summer jobs.
Several students /zaz/e u/ritten sl{ete/zes of t/zeir interesting
jobs. We begin our travels in sunny California, and end up
back bere in Pennsylvania, by way of Holland and New
Iersey.

 

After completion of his senior year at Pitt, TOM WEBER.
a civil engineer, decided to satisfy his wonder lust for a

summer by working in California. Tom worked in down—_

town Los Angeles for the California State Department of
Water Resources, a’ state government agency, as a Junior
Civil Engineer.

Although Pennsylvania is only beginning to set up a
Department of Water Resources, California’s D.W.R. is al-
ready equivalent in size to its Highway Department or
Bridge Department. The D.W.R. is responsible for supply-
ing the people with suitable drinking water, a growing prob-
lem for all major cities.

The major project Tom worked on was a huge open
channel which will carry water by gravity flow from the
snow—covered mountains in the central part of the state over

2 a hundred miles to the arid
Los Angeles area. This canal of
trapezoidal cross—section, 16
feet deep in the middle, 16 feet
wide at the bottom, and 80 feet
wide at the top, will carry over
2000 cubic feet of water per
second when completed. Al-
though much of Tom’s time
was spent at the drawing board,
he did get some experience in-
 terpreting hydrological data
Tom Weber and designing the canal’s rein-
forced concrete walls and control structures.

Weber seemed more impressed with California than with
his job. As he put it, “The job was pretty interesting, and
the pay was good, but California is the greatest.” Tom
lived only 15 miles from Los Angeles in the heart of Santa
Monica, where most of the streets are lined with palm trees.
“The beaches of Santa Monica are about the best in the
state, and I was within walking distance of them,” he added.
Other action spots near Tom were the Hollywood Bowl,
Sunset Strip, the L. A. Coliseum, Marineland-of—the-Paciﬁc,
and Disneyland.

To sum up his summer, Tom said, “The job gave me
some good experience, but I got even more valuable experi-
ence in broadening my knowledge of people and places.”

    

Now that Tom is back at Pitt for a year of graduate
school, he is trying to convince the administration to plant a
few palm trees on campus.

 

Maybe the address “N. V. Philips Gloeilampen F abrieken,
Willemstraat 20, Eindhoven, Nederland” means little to
many engineers, but for AL NAUDA. a senior electrical,
this‘ Dutch company will be hard to forget. Al worked in
Europe through the IAESTE (International Association for
the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience), and
was located with Philips in Holland, probably better known
to Americans as Norelco.

Ofﬁcially, Philips manufac-
tures electrical ‘and mechanical
equipment and supplies, but
their production line includes
stereo equipment, color tele—
visions, light bulbs, and even
paper for packing their prod-
ucts.

Al worked as a student
trainee for a group developing
memory cores for computers.
. A  More speciﬁcally, Al helped a
AI Nauda designengineer develop power
supplies for the memory cores. “At ﬁrst I was a technician,”
Al said. “My job was building and testing the circuits my
boss designed. But later I did a little of my own design
work.” One of his designs, a protection circuit meeting
speciﬁc requirements, will be used in a memory for Tele-
funken, a well—known German company.

Nauda toured Switzerland, France, and Germany during
his stay in Europe._ He must have liked Europe, because he
did not ﬂy home until two days before. classes began. Al
concluded, “I liked my job. The Dutch are clean, hard-
working people, but they’re fun—loving too . . . It was a
completely unique experience.”

    

 

Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Iersey was
the summer home of JOE FOLK. a senior electrical engineer.
Joe was in the Systems Engineering Division, and worked
with the Mechanized Auxiliary Services Center.

Bell Laboratories is divided into three main areas: Sys-
tems, Research, and Development. The Systems Division
investigates the economic feasibility of future Bell System
innovations, and lays the groundwork on production require-
ments for the Development Division.

]oe’s speciﬁc assignment was designing a computer
memory ﬁle for the Semiautomatic Information System
(SIS). The SIS is a computerized aid to the already-over-
burdened information operator. Data on the large paper

  

directories will be stored in the SIS computer ﬁle to be easily

-accessed by each information operator. Ioe worked in con-

junction with the Development Division in Naperville,
Illinois, and the AT&T central oﬁices in New York City.

“The most impressive aspect of the Bell Labs, besides the
new building at Holmdel itself,” commented Folk, “was the
technical competence of my fellow employees. The Labs
offers an excellent graduate education plan to all its
engineers.”

Faculty members and past students also employed by Bell
Telephone Laboraries are Dr. Zvi Meiksin, Dr. Paul Bas-
sett, Mr. Gary Frey, and Mr. Ron Whitﬁeld, all of the
Electrical Engineering Department.

RICH SEADER. a senior petroleum engineering student,
spent his summer with Manufacturer’s Light and Heat
Company, a member of the Columbia Gas System, Incor-
porated. Rich worked out of their general oﬂ-ice in‘ Pitts-
burgh as a technician in the Storage Department.

Seader’s chief assignment was constructing isopach and
structure maps for the company’s storage ﬁelds. These maps
are made by correlating driller’s reports .and storage forma-
tion data in each well. The
maps give a better understand-
ing of the gas reservoir as a
whole, but they also help the
company satisfy Federal Power
Commission standards.

Rich learned of a very
unique project of his company
this summer. Columbia Gas
and the Atomic Energy Com-
mission are currently experi-
i ~'  ‘  menting with nuclear explo-

Rlcll Setlder sives for creating underground
gas storage reservoirs. Without these new storage facilities,
present gas transmission systems would have to more than
double their present size and capacity to meet customer
demands.

Of his summer Rich noted, “My work was very inter-
esting. I received a perspective of the industry that I could
not have obtained in school.” Rich particularly liked the
pleasant attitude of his co-workers in the gas and oil
business.

    

A Chemical Engineering senior, ANDY MUSKUS
worked with Sun Oil Company in Marcus Hook, Pennsyl-
vania, near Philadelphia.

Starting work on April 24 as a junior engineer, Andy
was issued a desk, a desk calculator, a secretary, and respon-
sibility for the maintenance and operation of a pilot plant
and processing its data. The pilot plant was a crude oil
adiabatic hydrocracker. It occupied no less than 25 square
feet, was 21/7_ stories high, and cost in the neighborhood of
$250,000. The data that spewed from the pilot plant in-
strumentation was rather extensive and varied, covering
temperatures, pressures, flow rates, and volumes, including
in all over 150 readings.

Andy’s job involved taking the data and working it

into a computer program that was already compiled but
not completely de-bugged. First he de—bugged the program
and made it produce useable heat and material balances.
After the results were returned, he screened them to see if
they were reasonable. Many times the results were not
reasonable so Andy had to ﬁnd out why not. He varied
recycle rates, temperatures, rows, etc., until his results were
as close to the optimum as possible.

Under excellent senior engineering supervision, he at-
tempted to put the pilot plant together each time that it
came unglued. The plant _shut down for minor repairs
three times during the summer, but considering the fact
that the plant had just been installed a few months before,
the shut downs were quite expected. After a few months,
he was given the responsibility of writing up the instruc-
tions for the unit operation.

By the end of the summer, Andy could draw the entire
process in detail from memory.

Even more important than the opportunity to work in
his ﬁeld, was the experience Andy gained from meeting
and working with the people that make an industry what
it is. This experience comes only from on-the—job practice.

Surveyor Landing Operation

A Pitt Graduate co—authors this article on his work at Hughes Aircraft

on the Surveyor explorations.

— by Robert J. Varga and M. H. Young

ABSTRACT

Among the most formidable tasks that man has prescribed
for himself is that of reaching the moon. Before man walks
on its surface, however, many questions about its structure
will have to be answered. This is the mission for Surveyor-
as the name implies—the Hughes Aircraft Company’s highly
successful soft—landing robot. Its mission is highly complex,
for it entails not only the normal diﬂiculties of a successful
launch and mid—course trajectory adjustments, but also the
relatively new science of controlled soft landing.

To accomplish this extremely difficult landing operation,
America had to develop a system that would take over com-
mand and control of the spacecraft, and guide it on its
perilous descent to the lunar surface. Such a system is the
Radar Altimeter and Doppler Velocity Sensor (RADVS)
developed by Hughes Aircraft engineering personnel.

OPERATION

For radar equipment designed to utilize the doppler
phenomenon, intrinsic problems in providing adequate test-
ing techniques have evolved. This leads to extensive research
and experimentation by the Hughes Aircraft Company to
develop a technique to evaluate the lunar landing type
doppler radar system by space dynamic simulation testing.

The RADVS measures slant range and orthogonal three-
axis velocity of the spacecraft with respect to the lunar sur-
face during the descent phase from retro—rocket burnout to
near touchdown. This data is then fed to a flight control
electronics unit for spacecraft thrust and attitude control
commands. RADVS utilizes common circuitry and com-
ponents to perform the two separate functions of altitude
and velocity determination. The radar system is comprised
of four assemblies: 1) an R—F section; 2) the Radar Altim-
eter/Velocity Antenna for beams 1 and 4; 3) the Doppler
Velocity Sensing Antenna for beams 2 and 3; and 4) a Signal

SURVEYOR III LANDING—APRIL 19,- 1967

Surveyor III landed on the Moon’s surface in the eastern
portion of the Ocean of Storms at 4:04 p.m. PST, on
April 19, 1967.

Liftoff occurred at 11:05 p.m. PST on April 16, followed
by a nominal parking orbit and subsequent injection into a
translunar trajectory. A standard midcourse maneuver was
performed at 9:00 p.m. PST on April 17. The spacecraft
landed within 1.6 miles of the planned target area, 21 hours
after lunar sunrise. Because of peculiarities of the lunar ter-
rain, the descent radar did not turn oﬁ‘ the Vernier engines
at 14 feet as planned. This caused the spacecraft to “hop”
three times before the engines were shut down. The vehicle
came to rest inside an unidentiﬁed crater at an angle of 12
degrees in an uphill eastward direction.’ The crater is esti-
mated to be about 650 feet in diameter and 50 to 60 feet
deep.

The first TV picture was transmitted approximately 59
minutes after touchdown. Fifty-four 200—line pictures were
transmitted before high power operation was initiated, pro-
viding the higher quality 600-line pictures. Surveyor III was
responsive to commands throughout the lunar day, which

ended on May 3. A total of 6315 TV pictures were taken, in-

cluding the earth, star maps, and photos of a lunar eclipse.
More than 33,000 commands were transmitted to the space-
craft during Lunar Day 1 operations.

Surface sampler operation was excellent throughout the
mission. The mechanism dug a total of four trenches, the
deepest of which was 7-1/2 inches. It successfully scooped up
and dropped lunar soil on a footpad, permitting a close ex-
amination of the material’s characteristics.

Engineering interrogations were performed into the lunar
night until temperaure cutoff levels were reached. At the
time of spacecraft shutdown,, all indications were that a re-
vival would be possible during Lunar Day 2. The solar panel
was positioned so that it will have sulﬁcient solar illumina-
tion for initial spacecraft operations on May 23, 1967, four
days and 21 hours after lunar sunrise.

Surveyor III is the third of seven spacecraft designed and
built by Hughes Aircraft Company in support of the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration program to ob-
tain lunar information needed for the first manned lunar
landing. The project is managed by NASA’s Iet Propulsion
Laboratory operated by the California Institute of Technol-
ogy in Pasadena, California.

Data Converter. The antenna assemblies contain the re-
ceiver R—F sampler, crystal mixed and preampliﬁer for each
beam. The R—F section contains two klystrons and the altim-
eter klystron modulator. The altimeter klystron operates at
a near frequency of 12.9 kmc while the velocity klystron
operates at 13.3 kmc. Waveguides connect the antennas as-
semblies to the R—F section. Figure 1 is an artist’s conception
of a Surveyor spacecraft and the correct orientations of the
four radar beams with respect to the spacecraft coordinate
system.

Radar beam 4 is parallel to the Z-axis and develops
altitude or range information. Beam 1, 2, and 3 develop the
three—axis velocity information with respect to spacecraft
coordinates. Beams 1, 2, and 3 are oriented about 25 degrees
divergent to the spacecraft Z-axis and pass through three cor-
ners of a square parallel to the X—Y plane. Beams 1 and 2
form a plane parallel to the ’X—axis. Beams 2 and 3 form a
plane parallel to the Y—axis. Slant range along the Z-axis is
determined in beam 4, whose transmitted R—F is a shift in
frequency. A sample of the transmitted frequency is
mixed with the received energy frequency and their differ-
ence extracted by" a crystal detector. This difference in fre-

quency is proportional to the R—F “round trip” time and
therefore to the range along the beam path. The range out-
put scale factory is changed by a factor of 20 to improve the
radar sensitivity when the measured slant range is less than
1000 feet. Velocity is determined by summing the frequency
shift of the reflections of two constant frequency beams with
divergent paths. The frequency summing operation will
produce a doppled “audio” typical of velocity in the plane of
the two beams. The method of summing determines whether
axial or transverse velocity is computed. By using each pair
of velocity beams, i. e., 1-2, 1—3, 2-3, the velocity along the
X, Z and Y axes, respectively is determined.

HOW THE RADAR SYSTEM WORKS

Brieﬂy the radar system installed on the Surveyor soft
lunar landing spacecraft operates in the following manner.
The radar system is turned on after the solid propellant
retro-rocket has been burning a certain period of time. The
three liquid fuel Vernier engines are also ﬁring at this time
to maintain adequate altitute control. The four trackers are
operated in the search mode in an attempt to lock—on to the
lunar surface. When the four trackers have locked—on, the
tracker Reliable Operate signals (ROD1, ROD2, ROD3, and
ROAT) establish the model Reliable Operate signals
(RODVS and PORA) for the Doppler Velocity Sensor
(DVS) and Radar Altimeter (RA) portions of the system
respectively. Hence, Vx, Vy, V2 and R2, the velocity and
range analog signals are computed. The values of VX, Vy,
Vz and R2 are preprogrammed for a particular trajectory.
If the actual signals are not the same as the preprogrammed

I5

values, the ﬂight control computer will issue commands to
vary the thrust of the three Vernier engines to alter the space-
craft ﬂight proﬁle to obtain the correct trajectory. The Signal
Data Converter analyzes the frequency spectrum of each
tracker to determine velocity information. The retro-rocket
case in the mean time has been ejected at 25,000 feet and the
Vernier engines control the descent of the spacecraft. As
previously indicated at 1000 feet above the lunar surface, the
gain states of the trackers are changed to obtain better sen-
sitivity and control. At 14 feet above the lunar surface, the
14-foot mark is generated and the vernier propulsion system
is turned off and the spacecraft drops to the lunar surface.
The approximate impact velocity is 5 fps.
TESTING

With concurrence of the ]et Propulsion Laboratory, the
Surveyor System Test Department of Hughes Aircraft Com-
pany modiﬁed the existing test program to include space
dynamic simulation testing of RADVS. A helicopter was
selected as the ﬂight vehicle since the terminal descent tra-
jectories of the actual Surveyor lunar soft landing spacecraft
could be simulated, and the aerodynamic stress restrictions
imposed to RADVS could be observed. A special ﬁxture was
designed and fabricated such that the antennas were posi-
tioned in the same orientation as when installed on the space-
craft. Separate helicopter ﬂights were performed to evaluate
the vibration and stress levels which the RADVS equipment
would be subjected to during the dynamic space simulation
tests. These levels did not exceed the design factors of the
RADVS equipment. The special test ﬁxture and its mating
interface mounting plate were designed to allow rotation of
the test‘ ﬁxture Z (roll) axis to various angles with respect to
the vertical. This allowed special trajectories to be planned

for the helicopter and ﬂown with the RADVS beams

oriented at several angles of incidence.

The primary objective of performing a dynamic simula-
tion test was to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative per-
formance of the lunar landing doppler radar system under
conditions as realistic as physically possible within the con-
straints of the helicopter test environment. Detailed test
plans were formulated which resolved parameters to be in-
vestigated, ﬂight proﬁles to be flown to obtain these param-
eters, and ﬂight test procedures for the ground crew and test
pilot. The functions tested are listed, as are the parameters
the test pilot should be ﬂying and events which he must
negotiate. The test pilot was responsible for operation of the
RADVS equipment during the ﬂight pass. Some eighteen
ﬂights consisting of 53 trajectories were ﬂown for the pur-
pose of investigating RADVS performance and accuracy,
using the ﬁve station cinetheodolite tracking instrumentation
available at White Sands Missile Range, Air Force Missile
Development Center (AFMDC), Holloman Air Force Base,
Alamogordo, New Mexico. From the cinetheodolite track-
ing stations quantitative reference data could be computed
to give helicopter height above the terrain and the helicopter
velocity vectors in a ﬁxed coordinate system at long range.
This basic optical data was used to compute the total velocity
vector, the physical velocities along each beam, the coordinate
velocities of the test ﬁxture, Vx, Vy, V2 and Slant Range,
R2. The ﬁnal net accuracies obtainable with this method
under good optical conditions were less than = 1 fps in veloc-
ity, and less than = 1 foot in Slant Range. The cinetheodo-
lite tracking capability is a keynote to the proper evaluation
of the radar system. Optical data was continually compared
to radar data for evaluation.

Analysis of the composite plots of RADVS analog out—
puts derived from on—board Wide Band FM magnetic tape
recordings, and PDM telemetry recordings and reduced
optical tracking data obtained from the five station optical
complex provided suﬂicient evidence to verify the output
accuracy of the RADVS system.

It was noted in the early stages of testing that the Radar
Altimeter accuracy was not within speciﬁcation in the low
deviation mode. A plot of Telemetry PDM range data along
with cinetheodolite height-above—terrain data vs. time is
shown in Figure 2. The error at the beginning of the pass
was in the order of 11.4 percent at 5800 ft. It was found that
the altimeter accuracy improved as a function of operating
time. This was due to altimeter klystron mode shifting as a
function of temperature. The klystron was operating on a
non—linear portion of the mode until the unit reached the
temperature at which it was initially set up.

One major problem was the overshoot in range voltage.
When changing from low to high gain states at the 1000 ft.
mark, approximately 40 percent overshoot in range voltage
analog was experienced in the radar altimeter. The fre-
quency deviation of the altimeter klystron is increased by a
factor of 10 when going from the low deviation mode to the
high deviation mode at the 1000 ft mark. At the same time,
the frequency of the altimeter tracker must be increased by
a factor of 10 so that tracking may be continuous. To ac-
complish this, a step change is programmed into the altimeter
tracker voltage control oscillator to cause a frequency in-
crease. The step change programmed into the VCO was too
great in magnitude, causing the large overshoot. However,

the desired signal frequency was still within the altimeter
tracker bandpass, and the tracker was able to shift down to
the correct frequency, producing a correct analog output in
approximately 0.9 seconds. After ﬂight 13, the Signal Data
Converter was returned for rework, where the programmed
step change to VCO was readjusted to produce the correct
scale factor change.

The examination of antenna side lobe cross coupling was
considered a necessary aspect of testing. The RADVS sys-
tem contains circuitry to detect side lobe cross coupling be-
tween the antenna feedhorns for beams 2 and 3. The criteria
established for detecting side lobe cross coupling was that
the difference between doppler frequencies in beams 2 and 3
would be less than 100 cycles, and the cross-coupled side lobe
signal received in one of the beams would be at least 30 db
less than the main lobe signal received in the other beam.
This circuitry was deemed necessary because the feedhorns
for beams 2 and 3 are contained in the dame antenna as-
sembly. As a result of flight 17, it was found that'under cer-
tain adverse conditions, cross coupling could occur among
any combinations of DVS antennas. Flight 17, which was
used for reflectivity calculations was conducted over desert
and very smooth water. It was found that when one DVS
was striking water and receiving a very weak return while
another beam was striking desert and receiving a strong
return, the strong return coupled a signal into the antenna
with the weak return which was greater in amplitude than
the desired signal. This occurred regardless of which DVS
beams were involved. "When the side lobe from the beam 3
antenna was coupling into beam 2 the difference in signal

amplitude appeared to be in the order of 30 db. When the
side lobe from beam 1 was coupled into beam 2, the average
diﬁrerence in signal level appeared to be approximately 25 db.
The absence of water on the lunar surface is obvious; how-
ever, the cross-coupling between DVS beams would present
a problem if one of the beams were pointing directly at the
surface and receiving a strong return, and another of the
beams were pointing out into space or receiving a return
which was at least 25 db below the amplitude of the strong
return, and still greater than the tracker acquisition level.
Another primary objective for using the dynamic testing
technique was to evaluate the performance of the radar sys-
tem when operating over various types of terrain_— in par-
ticular the ‘reflectivity analog measurement over desert, water,
lava beds, and sand. Eleven ﬂights consisting of 32 passes
were flown over various types of terrain including mountain-
ous regions of the White Sands Missile Range from which
reﬂectivity measurements and computations were made.

Summary

The review of radar operation data of the successful lunar-
landed Surveyor Spacecraft No. 1 appears to be the best
summary to this technical discussion. As the spacecraft ap-
proached the lunar surface the RADVS ON signal occurred,
essentially at retro—rocket ignition. The altimeter search func-
tion appeared on the analog range output during the warm-
up time. Lock—on by every velocity beam plus RODVS
appeared within one second of each other. The combination
appearing at about 30 seconds after power on and retro-

rocket ignition. From main retro—rocket characteristics, the
retro—rocket conditions at RODVS signal generation were
estimated as 55,000 feet altitude and 3280 feet per second
velocity. Maximum required velocity capability is 3000 fps
on each radar beam. The flight path angle at retro—rocket
ignition was 5.87° oPf the local lunar vertical. It appear-S

that each DVS beam locked—on as soon as the velocity de- ,_

creased to the upper acquisition limit. It also appears that 

signal strength was well above acquisition sensitivity. The 

RORA signals appeared 9.0 seconds after RODVS_or about 

39 seconds after retro—rocket ignition. From retro—rocketf

characteristics, the retro—rocket conditions at RORA were

estimated as 36,000 feet altitude and 690 fps velocity. There I_

was no evidence yet available to contradict the conclusion i.

that RADVS was operating properly in the wide band mode
during retro—rocket burning and also switched to narrow
band after burnout without loss of any beam and with no
noticeable effect on all its prime analog outputs — Vx, Vy,
V2 and R2. The relatively small lateral velocities during
deceleration tend strongly to confirm proper lock to lunar

RESEARCH AT PITT

featuring Drs. Rathbone, Mickie, uml Clriang

Often students at Pitt are not aware of the research con—
ducted by their professors in conjunction with teaching
duties. Also, a professor seldom gets a chance to explain his
research during a regular lecture period. Skyscraper would
like to present in each issue a glimpse of some faculty mem-
bers’ research projects. Here Drs. D. E. Rathbone and M. H.
Mickle of the Electrical Engineering Department and Dr.
S. H. Chiang of the Chemical Engineering Department are
featured in their respective projects.

Drs. Rathbone and Mickle are working together on a
government transportation problem called CLARAC, while
Dr. Chiang is concerned with interfacial phenomena in
nature.

SOMETHING HAPPENED
S. H. Chiang

What has happened at the “interface” when water is
evaporated from the surface of the sea, when acid is dis-
solved into a solution or when oxygen is exchanged with
carbon dioxide in the lung? There are many different things
that could have happened. Let us discuss some of them here.

First, there is the change of interfacial temperature. The
well—known “Wet—Bulb Temperature Phenomenon” is re-
sulted from the heat effect due to the evaporation of water.
In other systems, similar heat effects can also be caused by
the heat of solution or the heat of reaction. The large tem-
perature change at the interface sends a “thermal wave”
throughout the system. It is this “thermal wave” that often
causes very large alteration in the rate of mass transfer across
the interface.

The twitching action appearing on the surface of strong
wine is another interesting interfacial phenomenon — - - the
“strong wine phenomenon.” This phenomenon occurs very
commonly in liquid systems. For example, when acetic .acid
is transferred from an organic solvent into water, violent and
spontaneous “bubbling” activity can be seen at the interface.
Such activity invariably enhances the mass transfer. In fact,
the transfer rate of acetic acid in the above example has
been found to be at least a hundred times greater than the
case of similar transfer without the interfacial activity.

Very closely related to the “strong wine phenomenon”
is the “dirty water phenomenon”. The latter is derived from
the problem of supression of the evaporation rate of water
when a minute quantity of “dirt” — an impurity — is pre-
sent. The decrease in the_rate of evaporation cannot be ex-
plained by the usual theory of vapor pressure depression.

22

Dr. S. H. Chiang of The Chemical Engineering Depf.

However, the answer lies in the fact that “dirty” molecules
are often “surface-active” and they tend to accumulate at or
near the phase boundary forming a solid-like thin ﬁlm. Such
a ﬁlm suppresses the strong-wine type surface activity and
also hinders the free movement of mass across the interface.
Thus, a drastical reduction of the evaporation rate occurs.

Finally, we would like to examine the problem of re-
placing the interface with a semipermeable membrane.
Nature provides us with the most challenging example —— the
membrane of living cells. The cell membrane performs
speciﬁc biological functions via a selective transport process,
such as oxygen—carbon dioxide exchange in the lung.
It controls not only the rate but also the kind of transfer
permissible. A very crude artiﬁcial protein-lipid-protein
membrane, exhibiting some semipermeable characteristics,
has been produced in our laboratory. However, we are far

 

from achieving anything that resembles a true biological

membrane.

Indeed, it will be a day of triumph for the engineers if
we could master the art of nature in controlling these inter-
facial phenomena and producing a perfect tailor—made “in-
terface” for every mass transfer process.

CLARAC PROJECT

One of the major research activities in the Department
of Electrical Engineering is the CLARAC Project which is
supported by the Department of the Army, Washing-
ton, D. C. Drs. Donald E. Rathbone, Principal Investigator,
and Marlin H. Mickle, Co—Investigator, for the $144,000 two-
year project are shown observing some results from their
computer in Pennsylvania Hall.

The principal area of investigation for the CLARAC
team — three faculty, four graduate students and one under-
graduate — has been transportation and allocation “systems”.

For example, one particular problem is determining a method
for ﬁnding the magnitude of the minimum path and the
optimum routing between any two cities in the continental
United States where the total number of cities is assumed
to be 2500. The requirement of an extremely fast solution
time (less than 10 seconds) is necessary since the calculation
is to be made hundreds of times per day.

Another problem which the CLARAC team is investigat-
ing is an allocation problem involving munitions shipments
from various depots in the U. S. to various ports of debarka-
tion outside the continent. The shipments have a required
delivery date, must be routed through the “optimum” ports
in the United States and must meet shipping schedules, etc.

Some of the techniques which are involved in the solu-
tion of the above—type problems are digital simulation, neigh-
borhood programming, linear programming, Pontryagin’s
maximum principle, minaddition, and network theory. The
CLARAC project has its own remote computer console and
plans now are being implemented to allow the Department
of the Army in Washington to access the Pitt computer (and
thus the CLARAC programs) with their teletype unit.

For Your Listening Pleasure

Modern audio systems, both stereo and hi—fidelity, can be

tailored to individual preference with careful investment.

by Gary T. Martin

ABSTRACT

Every novice audiophile encounters certain basic prob-
lems when purchasing a hi—ﬁdelity system. Among these
problems are the choice between a monophonic or stereo-
phonic system, components or a console unit, and transistor
or vacuum tubes. To further add to the confusion, every
manufacturer furnishes lists of speciﬁcations on their units
which are often ambiguous. 'It is hoped that this article
will shed some light on these problems and help the enter-
tainment-oriented audiophile to choose a hi-ﬁ system.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst thing one must consider in purchasing a sys-
tem is whether a console or component—part hi—ﬁ is desired.
If one is interested in quality entertainment, this turns out
to be no problem since components will deﬁnitely give
better sound reproduction and better stereo separation for
the same price as a console system. In addition to this pri—
mary advantage of quality, components offer ﬂexibility not
obtainable in console systems. Components may be placed
around the home more conveniently, and individual units
can be added easily without disturbing the rest of the system.

Having decided upon a component system as opposed
to a console, one’s next decision is a choice of which com-
ponents will make up the system. In deciding, one must
consider his listening preferences — radio programs, phono—
graph records, recorded tapes, or any combinations of these.
Regardless of the source material, certain elements of a sys-
tem will be “musts.” Living in an area where several radio
stations play music you like can lessenithe need for record
playing facilities, the advantage being that one can save
money that he would otherwise spend on records; however,
the disadvantage is that the listener has no choice in the
musical selections. Therefore, most systems include facilities
for playing records even though the system may not have a
tuner to receive radio stations.

24

Within the past ten years, the tape recorder has become
more and more important as a source of program material.
The inclusion of such a machine in a system is certainly
recommended if the cost is not prohibitive.

The three common sources of program material, then, are
radio, phonograph, and tape. All of these require different
devices to implement their various functions, but every sys-
tem will have some form of ampliﬁer and some form of
loudspeaker. Let’s look at each of the above devices.

Niagara Falls, New York. He is a member of Delta Tau
Delta social fraternity, and last year co—captained the varsity
swimming team. He worked for Western Electric Com-
pany in Buffalo during the past three summers.

Gary has been interested in stereo and hi—ﬁdelity systems
for over eight years. With some penny—pinching over this
period, his sound system now includes a tuner, pre—ampliﬁer,
ampliﬁer, tape recorder, dual speaker, turntable, timer, and

The Amplifier

Since information signals from radio stations, phono-
graphs, and tapes are of the order of micro—volts to thou-
sandths of a volt, an ampliﬁer is needed to boost the power
level to the speakers. Simply, then, all the power ampliﬁer
does is amplify the received information signal. Another
type of ampliﬁer is the pre-ampliﬁer, which is either built
into the record-playing device, or is combined into a larger
separate unit with a number of controls. If the latter is the
case, the pre—amp will be followed with a power ampliﬁer
which provides more boosting, or gain, of the signal, mak—
ing the signal useable to the speaker. If one combines the
pre—amp and the power amp into one unit, the combination
is called an integrated ampliﬁer. The further addition of a
tuner to this unit again changes the name to a receiver.

Which combination is best? This is largely a choice of.
individual preference, although certain guidelines do exist.
A receiver is, of course, the most convenient type of unit,
combining pre—amp, power amp, and tuner in one “box.”
Separate units, however, provide the greatest flexibility in
placement, even though more space is required. A separate
pre—amp is also likely to offer more control flexibility than
is generally obtainable in an integrated unit. No matter
which type of system one chooses, the ampliﬁer must be
able to select a program source, amplify it, and control tone

and volume satisfactorily.

The Loudspeaker
The choice of speakers for a sound system is probably
the most critical of all decisions. The speaker is truly the
weakest link in the chain of hi—ﬁdelity. The choice of

speakers cannot be strictly a monetary decision. Although
generally speaker .quality improves with price, and one
should purchase the very best set of speakers his budget will
allow, do not hesitate to buy a less—expensive set if they
sound. good to you. Acoustically, the cabinet, or enclosure,
is critical to the speakers’ performance. A unit can have its
performance ruined by a poorly designed cabinet. Again,
the human ear is the best judge, regardless of advertising
propaganda on how good the speaker is “supposed to
sound.” The cabinet should in many instances reinforce
low frequencies (bass) but in no case should the cabinet
resonate or vibrate.

Besides differences in sound, an important speciﬁcation
is speaker “eﬂiciency.” Efficiency is really how well a speaker
performs for a given number of watts input. One speaker
may perform perfectly with a power of only ﬁve watts from
the ampliﬁer, while another speaker may require thirty
watts. Speaker speciﬁcations in the past used to give the
maximum power input the speakers could handle. More
recently, however, the trend is to specify the minimum
power requirements for satisfactory functioning of the
speaker.

Thus, in the selection of components for a system, it is
probably best to choose the speakers ﬁrst. Then, knowing
the power required, one can choose an ampliﬁer which will
furnish this power. Most.amp1iﬁers will have several out-
put connections marked in “ohms” to match the input
impedance of the speakers. Usually this impedance will
be 8 or 16 ohms, and the components must matc/2 this value.

The Tuner

If the listener desires high ﬁdelity radio programs, a
tuner is a necessary addition to the system. Although a
radio could conceivably be connected to the system, the re-

sultant quality is usually poor enough to be prohibitive. Two
modes broadcast radio signals for entertainment: AM and
FM, that is, Amplitude Modulation and Frequency Modula-
tion. Both models are functional, but FM offers higher
quality and a wider frequency response. In addition, FM
is much less susceptible to noise and static. The output of
the tuner is fed into the ampliﬁer and then through the
speakers. The cost of an AM—FM tuner is considerably more
than that of a pure FM unit. Also, most homes already
have AM radios, so this author suggests that one should
purchase an FM unit only, rather than no tuner at all, if
cost is a consideration. One’s system suffers very little with-
out AM reception.

In choosing a particular tuner, one should look for low
sensitivity speciﬁcations (less than 4 micro-volts if possible.)
Of course one needs a good antenna, since FM reception
of any quality is usually limited to less than 50 miles. Highly
directional and rotatable antennae are necessary for distances
greater than 50 miles. If there is one component that the
listener should purchase last, it should be the tuner.

The Record Player

Here one has a choice of a completely automatic turn-
table, commonly known as the record changer, of the less
versatile manual turntable. Formerly the manual table was
believed to give better reproduction than the automatic, be—
cause of speed variation and slippage resulting from stack-
ing records on the automatic table. Modern—day four—pole
motors have solved these problems to the point where argu-
ments of this kind are no longer valid to any but the one
where a preference for gadgetry may become signiﬁcant.

When buying a turntable, one should look for low
values of wow and flutter, which are names given to slow
and rapid variations in turntable speed. Also, one should
look for a low-rumble speciﬁcation.

The Tape Player

A tape machine lends versatility to the system, and in—
creases the recorded library, in addition to just being a lot
of fun. Tape machines costing less than $50 are toys, and
are not meant for hiﬁdelity reproduction. Good quality tape
decks (record and playback, but no ampliﬁcation) cost less
than $250. For one’s ﬁrst recorder, it is best to consult a
good recorder man and inform him of the intentions for the
unit, especially of the quality of sound required. Again, one
should listen to several tape units before deciding.

Transisfors or Tubes

Much has been said about transistors recently and their
superiority over vacuum tubes. Until a few years ago, tran-
sistors were less reliable than tubes, and were much more
heat sensitive. These problems seemingly have been ironed
out, and other aspects of this comparison are more decisive.
Both vacuum tubes and transistors can and do sound good.
Both, however, sound different in many cases, and individ-
ual preference would be important. Theoretically, transis-
tors should last indeﬁnitely. ‘Transistor equipment runs
cooler and is smaller and lighter, but tube units are usually
less expensive. Both types of units are well worth looking
into when purchasing a system.

Whaf is Sfereo?

Very simply, stereo in a hi—ﬁ system means that a second
channel has been added all the way from microphone to
speaker. Stereo expands the program material into an addi-
tional dimension, so that the listener perceives the physical
location of the instruments or voices. Locating the various
instruments may or may not be important, but the princi-
pal advantage of stereo is the overall spaciousness and
transparency of the sound.

In a hi-H system, sound picked up by a microphone at
the right of the orchestra is fed through the complete re-
producing and processing chain to the loudspeaker at the
right of the listener. The same is done with sound picked
up to the left of the orchestra. From performer to loud-
speaker, the two channels are kept separate. By this process,
the listener’s ears detect the acoustic conditions in the studio.
The overall eﬂect is much closer to the original sound,
which, of course, is the ultimate aim of hi-ﬁdelity.

The only problem in stereo is matching the two separate
channels all the way from microphone to speakers. Good
quality high fidelity components, however, do this very
well.

The care and patience one expends in choosing his sound
system will result in many hours of pleasurable listening.

Dean Hoelscher and Chancellor Posvar discuss '|'he Engineering Fund Campaign wi'l'h ihe press.

38

On September 21, B. R. Dorsey, President of the Gulf
Oil Corporation, announced a three-year, $3,250,000 fund
campaign for the University’s School of Engineering. Mr.
Dorsey will serve as Chairman of the Engineering Fund
Campaign Committee, which will head the effort.

In accepting the chairmanship of the drive, Dorsey said,
“The need for qualiﬁed engineers was never greater than
now, but something must be done now to avoid a far more
serious deﬁcit in the years ahead. Industry cannot meet this
need on its own, but neither can our schools of engineering
meet it without help from industry and alumni.”

The 353% million ﬁgure has been set to carry out Pitt’s
expanding and modernized engineering program. More
speciﬁcally, $2,500,000 will go toward equipment and furnish-
ings for the new Benedum Hall of Engineering, $500,000
toward faculty revelopment, and $250,000 for the move into
the new building.

Student enrollment, and correspondingly faculty num-
bers, will increase with the addition of the new engineering
building. The student body will jump from 2,000 to 2,500
by 1969, and eventually is planned to reach 3,300. The fac-
ulty will increase from 116 to about 160, and supporting staff
from 54 to 80. The new engineering building, costing more
than $512 million, has been ﬁnanced cooperatively by the state
government and private donors, Mr. Dorsey pointed out.
With the present agreement between the state and Pitt, in
which the University retains its private status, the private

donor is assured that his dollar for excellence is matched by
many additional dollars of basic support.

The fund leaders also stated that memorial gifts from
private donors would be recognized.

Engineering Alumni Associa-liion

Dean Harold Hoelscher reported on the new building’s
progress at the October 19 meeting of the Engineering
Alumni Association in the Pitt Student Union. Mr. Bernard
Koperek, Director of Development and Alumni Affairs at
Pitt, was also present, and commented favorably on the engi-
neering alumni’s activity plans for the coming months.

Frank I. Lydick presided at the meeting, and asked for
general comments on the Homecoming festivities planned
by the Association. Lively discussions followed on how the
Association is reducing alumni apathy with increased contact
to the graduates, reflecting the genuine interest the Associa-
tion has in building strong alumni support behind the ex-
panding engineering program at the University.

Although the Engineering Alumni Dinner in March is
always a big success, the committee felt that some of the
enthusiasm generated at this dinner dims by the fall and
winter months.

Ioe Folk of S/{yscraper and Laird Varzaly of the Engi—
neering Student Cabinet represented the students at the
Association meeting.

ENGINEERS & SCIENTISTS

TECNOLOGY FOR TOMORROW

Our work in advanced nuclear energy research re-
quires original thinking to’ develop technology for
the future.

Plowshare —

The use of nuclear explosives for peaceful purposes
is a typical example of one of our long range pro-
grams which requires the interaction of many engi-
neers and scientists. Practical applications include:
cratering experiments for use in harbor and canal
construction or modification; creating large under-
ground cavities for extraction and storage of fuel;
copper ore mining —fractur_ing of tons of low-grade
copper ore and its subsequent leaching and precipi-
tation as native copper.

Electronics Engineers -
Design and develop electronic systems necessary
for assessing the effects of experiments.

Mechanical Engineers —

Design, develop and install the nuclear explosives
and the diagnostics equipment to provide seismic
and shock data.

Solid State Scientists —
Investigate the structural changes brought about

by the excessive heat and pressure during a nu-
clear explosion so as to correlate the material prop-

erties with the history of the material and at the &e"’
same time obtain a better understanding of the

Depends on the giant. Actually, some giants are just regular
kinds of guys. Except bigger.

And that can be an advantage.

How? Well, take Ford Motor Company. We're a giant
in an exciting and vital business. We tackle big problems.
Needing big solutions. Better ideas. And that's where you
come in. Because it all adds up to a real opportunity for young
engineering graduates like yourself at Ford Motor Company.

Come to work for us and you'll be a member of a select
College Graduate Program. As a member of this program,
you won't be just another “trainee" playing around with
“make work" assignments.

You'll handle important projects that. you'll frequently
follow from concept to production. Projects vital to Ford.
And you'll bear a heavy degree of responsibility for their
success.

You may handle as many as 3 different assignments in
your ﬁrst two years. Tackle diverse problems. Like ﬁguring
how high a lobe on a cam should be in order to yield a certain
compression ratio. How to stop cab vibration in semirtrailer
truck_s. How to control exhaust emmission.

Soon you'll start thinking like a giant. You'll grow bigger
because you've got more going for you.

A network of computers to put confusing facts and
ﬁgures into perspective.

Complete testing facilities to prove out better ideas.

And at Ford Motor Company, your better ideas won't
get axed because of a lack of funds. (A giant doesn't carry a
midget's wallet, you know.)

Special programs. Diverse meaningful assignments. Full
responsibility. The opportunity to follow through. The best
facilities. The funds to do a job right. No wonder 87% of the
engineers who start with Ford are here 10 years later.

If you're an engineer with better ideas, and you'd like
to do your engineering with the top men in the ﬁeld, see the
man from Ford when he visits your campus. Or send your
resume to Ford Motor Company, College Recruiting De»
partment.

You and Ford can grow bigger together.

Many engineers spend a day of classes seeing little
of what they would like to see most —— a pretty girl.
A girl’s frown can be more pleasant than a professor's
smile. She brings joy to those around her, and her

many pretty girls working at the University. Séyrcmper

Solid connection.

It just makes good sense for the
graduate engineer or scientist,
contemplating the direction of his
professional career, to make sure
that he has all the information he
needs about every company he is
considering—that he has total

input information—before he makes

a connection.

If you're good. If you’re really
good. If you have learned to use
the knowledge you have acquired
as a starting point from which to
launch new ideas, you probably
know already that your talents are
in demand. There is always a
seller’s market for intellect.

But there can be more to your
future than buy and sell.
Satisfaction is a commodity that
cannot be exchanged.

When you are considering where

you will start in the complex world
of aerospace, while you are
gathering, input information, we

urge you to investigate the
opportunity for a satisfying career
here at the Pomona division of
General Dynamics.

Here are five reasons why it would

be a wise move for you now:
1. You will work side—by-side with

nationally recognized engineers

and scientists who are
pioneering advanced concepts
in missilry. Your reputation will
be balanced by association.

. Your compensation and fringe
benefits will be on a par with
the top in the industry.

ID

in an area where living is
pleasurable year ’round—one
of the top vacation areas in the
nation. Beaches, mountains,
desert, a great city nearby,
universities and colleges for

advanced study, an atmosphere

of growth and achievement.
4. Your ability will be applied to

    

. You will pursue your profession

creating universally important
products of engineering
imagination.

5. Here at the nation’s largest
facility for development and
manufacture of tactical guided
missiles, your talents will be
evaluated, recognized and
rewarded.

1. What is the smallest number of acute triangles into which
a square can be divided? (An acute triangle is a triangle
with 3 acute angles; a right angle is neither acute or obtuse).
Show the dissection.

2. In H. G. Well’s ﬁrst novel, The First Man in the M0072,
our natural satellite is found to be inhabited by intelligent
creatures who have a unit of distance called a lunar. It was
adopted because the moon’s surface area, if expressed in
square lunars, exactly equals the moon’s volume in cubic
lunars. The moon’s diameter is 2160 miles. How many miles
in a lunar?

3. (a). A square formation of army cadets, 50 feet on a side,
is marching forward at a constant pace. ‘The company
mascot, a small terrier, starts at the center of the last rank
(position A), trots forward in a straight line to the center
of the first rank (position B), and then returns to A. At
the instant he returns, the cadets have moved forward 50 feet.
Assuming the dog loses no time in turning, and he trots at
a constant pace, how many feet does he travel?

 Now that you’ve solved the cake part of this prob-
lem, suppose that the mascot trots with constant speed along
the perimeter of the square. As before, the formation has
moved 50 feet the instant the dog returns to A, the starting
point. How long is the dog’s path?

grapher who worked in the university’s office of admissions,
were lunching together.

“Isn’t it remarkable,” observed the lady, “that our last
names are Black, Brown, and White, and that one of us has
black hair, one of us has brown hair, and one of us has
white hair.”

“It is indeed,” replied the person with black hair, “and
have you noticed that not one of us has hair that matches
his or her name.”

“By golly, you’re right!” ’exclaimed Prof. White.

If the lady’s hair isn’t brown, what color is it?

makes a large circle parallel to the ground. There is no
wind. Will it complete the circle in greater, less, or the same
time if there is a wind of constant direction and speed,
assuming the plane travels with the same engine speed that

it did before?

6'. The owner of a pet shop bought a certain number of
hamsters and half that number of pairs of parakeets. "He
paid $2 each for the hamsters and $1 for each parakeet. On
every pet he placed a retail price that was an advance of 10%
over what he paid for it.

After all but seven of the greatures had been sold, the
owner found that he had taken in for them an amount of
money exactly equal to what he had originally paid for all of
them. His proﬁt, therefore, was represented by the combined
retail value of the seven remaining animals, assuming he
could sell all of them. What was this value?

*Problem 3(b) is not a requirement to win the prize,

JUN THE
IDEA GORE

Right now, hundreds of engineers, chem-
ists, and physicists are exploring their own
ideas at NCR. We encourage them because
we consider idea-people as the backbone of
technological advancement in our field of
total business system development.

And it works. Business Management maga-
zine, in its list of “emerging ideas of
1966,” credits NCR with two out of seven:
pioneering in laser technology for record-
ing data, and development of our new PCMI
microfo rm system.

Whether you're a seasoned pro, or an
ambitious self-starter, and whatever your
degree, if the excitement and satisfaction
of start-to-finish idea development appeal
to you, you'll go far with NCR. And so will
your ideas.

Here's a good idea to start with: write to

What is there left for you to discover?

Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, built a com-
munications system across his empire some
six centuries before the Christian Era. On each
of a series of towers he posted a strong-
voiced man with a megaphone. By the 17th
century, even a giant megaphone built for
England's King Charles II

could project a man's voice

no further than two miles.

This same king granted

Pennsylvania to Admiral I
:

William Penn as a reward
for developing a fast, com-
prehensive communications
system — ship-to-ship by
signal flags.

We waited for the com-
bined theories of Maxwell,
Hertz, Marconi and Morse before men could
transmit their thoughts by wireless, though
only in code. Only after Bell patented his
telephone and DeForest designed his audion
tube could men actually talk with each other
long-distance. Today nations speak face-to—face
via satellite. Laser—beam transmission is just
around the corner. Yet man still needs better

56

 
   

ways to communicate across international
boundaries.

In a world that has conquered distance,
in a world whose destiny could hinge on
seconds, man is totally dependent on the
means which carry his voice and thought. It
is this means that we in Western Electric,
indeed the entire Bell System, have worked
on together since 1882.

Our specialty at Western
Electric is the manufacture
and installation of depend-
able, low-cost communica-
tions systems for both
today and tomorrow. And to
meet tomorrow's needs, we
will need fresh new ideas.
Your ideas.There is still much
for you to discover right

If you have a professional degree in chemistry.

Frankly, we also expect a lot. But
the rewards are based on perform-

ance. Not on how old you are or
how long you’ve been with us. By
the same token, we do not have
 formal training programs. We
 do have a very deep interest
in giving you as much respon-
sibility, and in pushing you
along just as fast and far
as you can go.
If this sounds
good toyou,discuss
us with your faculty
 and placement of-
 ficer. And see our

lfyou rebel at the idea of being dropped into a pro-
fessional slot, you’re our kind of person.

We need competent, imaginative, flexible individ-
uals. Because we’re that kind of company. We
encourage our people to take risks, to find novel-
even off-beat—approaches to
technical, managerial and
marketing problems. We
believe that.only a bold,
creative staff can con-
tribute to the continued
growth of a corporation
that is already bold and
creative. V

If you get in on it, you get paid to
be part of the most exciting techno-
logical breakthroughs of all time.
You’ll become a leader, an officer
in one of America’s most vital organi--
zations...the U. 8. Air Force.

You can be part of the Aerospace
Age when things are most exciting...
at the beginning. While you serve
your country, the whole universe will
open up to you.

There's a 2-year Air Force ROTC
program-, and the 4-year program
has new attractive financial assist-
ance provisions.

Lots of men waste their working
years. But you don’t have to be one
of them.

Kodak advertises to the engineering profession

That we pay well and can afford the best is too obvious to
belabor. As an inducement to practice your profession for us,
what more can we offer than money and good working con-
ditions? We can offer choice—both at the beginning and later
on when you have learned more about yourself. Our diversi-
ﬁcation and pattern of organization make choice feasible.
Some engineers are strongest on theory. We are big enough
to need that kind. More engineers are intuitive gadgeteers,
despite a ﬁrst—class engineering education. We need more of
that kind. To illustrate a few of the different kinds of systems
among which, for example, our mechanical engineers can

move, we show here how results of the work are presented
to the public. Accompanying comments are from the boss
engineers.

Correspondence with a view to joining us should be di-
rected to Eastman Kodak Company, Business and Technical
Personnel Dept., Rochester, N.Y. 14650.

An employer that needs mechanical, chemical, and electrical en-
gineers for Rochester, N.Y., Kingsport, Tenn., Longview, Tex.,
and Columbia, S.C., and offers equal opportunity to all. A policy
of promotion from within has long been maintained.

“A ﬁlm emulsion coating ma-
chine is unique. It needs consid-
erably more delicate adjustments
than a $250 watch, but it's ﬁve
stories high and a block long.
There is no other place you can
take a course in how to build ’
them bigger and better, but big-
ger and better they are getting.”

brand of photolithographic film cuts
their costs by requiring fewer make-
overs. Why should this be so? You
might trace it all back to a mechanical
engineer using our analog computer

mechanical engineers had to put an end to hand-
dipping of x—ray film. Our idea of an m.e.’s responsi-
bility is big enough to cover not only mechanical
drive systems but also fluid mechanics (as in recir-
culation and temperature control for corrosive pho-
tographic solutions), air hydraulics (recirculation
and temperature control of heated air), industrial de-
sign (styling for a medical environment), and plenty
of interfacing with the electrical circuitry people.H

General Electric
engineers and scientists
are helping to satisfy the
needs of society...

like beautiful cities

A technical career at General Electric can put
you in the position to help beautify our cities.

Inquisitive minds in research and advance
development at G.E. are evolving many concepts

to give our cities a clean, all-electric look.

Design engineers are translating concepts into
components and systems, while manufacturing
engineers are developing the methods and machines
that bring designs into being as useful products.

Technical marketing specialists are working with
electric utilities and city planners to give
mushrooming urban landscapes like Phoenix,
Atlanta and Chicago, a bright, all-electric face.

Urban living has already begun to change as a
result of the contributions made by General

Electric engineers and scientists, contributions

like air and water purification systems, underground
power equipment to preserve nature's beauty,
all-electric heating facilities, rapid-transit

systems, and a hundred more.

You can help develop new products and concepts,
new facilities, processes, and manufacturing
systems, or new applications and markets in
your technical career with General Electric.
