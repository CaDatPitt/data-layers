SPACECRAFT
STERILIZATION

Vast new interplanetary
scientific investigations
are now possible with re-
cent advances made by
biological engineers.

For the past several years, many
scientists have been expressing an in-
creasing concern that man in his race
toward outer space, may unwittingly
be propagating biological contamina-
tion. Biologists from America, Eng-
land, France and Russia recently

united to form the Committee on
Contamination by Extraterrestial Ex-
ploration. Th-is international commit-
tee has aﬁected both the American
and Russian space programs. The

‘National Aeronautics and Space Ad-

ministration (NASA) in cooperation
with the Uni-ted States Army Chem-
ical Corps is developing several tech-
niques for sterilization of the unusual
objects involved in space travel.
Radio Moscow similarly announced
excited Russian research into this
problem.

Three questions should be justi-
fiably asked concerning the biologists
con-tention that no living organisms
be transported to the moon or planets.
First, why should objects launched
from earth be free of terrestrial life
forms? Second, granted that they
should be, would not all life forms be
au-tomatically killed in passage be-
cause of the rigors of interplanetary
space? Third, assuming the answers
to the ﬁrst and second questions in-
dicate that all objects which may in-
t-ercept extraterrestrial bodies should
be sterile prior to launching, can this
sterilization be accomplished without
crippling restrictions to the space ex-
ploration program? The answers to
these questions require some
discussion.

Biological integrity. The ﬁrst ques-
tion which concerns the desirability
of avoiding accidental con-tamination
of extraterrestrial bodies with terres-
trial forms of life, is intimately re-
lated to the unsolved question of the
origin of life itself. Resolution of the
many divergent views requires evi-
dence that might be provided by the
moon and the planets. This evidence
can be gathered only if the celestial

body’s biological integrity is main-
tained until it may be investigated.
For example, the elucidation of the
formation and replication of the com-
plex molecules which form the basis
of life may be possible. Contamina-
tion by similar molecules of terres-
trial origin obviously will complicate
this investigation.

If all the biological material carried
to the moon or planets were to remain
within a limited area around the point
of impact, the danger of contamina-
tion would be of little concern. Un-
fortunately, this is probably not the
case. Because the moon is almost
totally lacking in atmosphere, parti-
cles ejected by a hard landing would
encounter too little frictional resis-
tance for their velocity to be appre-
ciably diminished. Hence even small
particles such as bacteria, might land
anywhere on the moon’s surface, de-
pending upon their initial trajectory.
Multiplication. There is greater con-
cern over the possible contamination
of Mars and Venus. Terrestrial micro-
organisms ‘might not only survive on
these planets, but might ﬁnd nutri-
tion, thrive and multiply. Bacte-
ria did multiply when introduced into
chambers that reproduced the condi-
tions believed to prevail on Mars.
Furthermore, spectroscopic evidence
and in-formation gathered by the
Mariner ﬂights indicate that low
forms of vegetation already exist.
Their biology, and the earth’s as well,
may be changed irreparably in a com-
paratively few years unless unusual
caution is exercised.

Gran-ted that it is desirable to pre-
vent contamination, the second ques-
tion then needs to be answered. Won’t
passage of the vehi-cle through inter-
planetary space au-tomatically achieve
the required sterility? This is by no
means certain.

 

 __

Spores or other earth forms could
survive the interplanetary journey.
The penetrating X-ray-s of outer space
are not of sufficient intensity to in-
sure sterility. Ultraviolet radiation,
though in-tense, is so easily shielded
that only uncovered surface orga-
nisms would be affected. Cold, even
down to almost absolute zero, has no
lethal effect. Similarly, vacuum has
no deleterious effect on micro-orga-
nisms. As for the hazards of landing,
the momentary heat and pressure of
a high velocity landing on a hard
surface wouldn’t exceed the lev-els
achieved for fractions of a second in
explosions, which bacteria have sur-
vived. In short, only by sterilizing
space vehicles before launching can it
be assured that living forms will not
be transmitted to other celestial
bodies.

The third question now requires an

answer. Are relatively simple tech-
niques available whereby space vehi-
cles may be sterlized? The answer
appears to be yes.
Sterile Surveyor. During the early
developmental stages of the Surveyor
spacecraft, designed to soft land on
the moon, efforts were made to dis-
cover a process resulting in a com-
pletely sterile spacecraft. Techniques
chosen included heat sterilization to
achieve internal sterility (destruction
of embedded micro-organisms and
those on interior surfaces) and gas
sterilization just prior to launching
with 12% ethylene oxide — 88%
Freon 12 to achieve external sterility.
However, numerous surfaces existed
on the Surveyor which required ap-
plication of a thermal control coating
following heat sterilization. This oper-
ation would result in recontaminating
the spacecraft with embedded viable
micro-organisms. NASA experiments
demonstrate the inability of the gas
sterilant to penetrate the coating suf-
ﬁ-ciently to sterilize the surfaces.

agent in the thermal con-trol coating.

10,000,000 spores of Bacillus subtilis.

for 24 hours in slightly opened Petri
dishes. Each dried coupon was asep-
tically placed in 10 ml. sterile distilled
water and the coating removed by
ultrasonic s-crubbing. The plates then
were incubated at 37°C. for 19 days.
To determine the number of surviving
spores, colony counts were made daily
after the initial 48 hours incubation
period.

The tabulated test results demon-
strate the sterilizing properties of the
formaldehyde-paint mixrture. All via-
ble organisms were killed after ex-
posure to one of the paint-sterilant
samples when the fresh formula-tion
Wa-s used or after the formulation had
been stored up to 4 weeks. Nor were
v-i-able organisms recovered after ex-
posure to the remaining two paint-
sterilanlt mixtures which had been
stored for 1-4 weeks. Curiously, a few
spores survived when exposed to fresh
mixtures of the latter paint samples.
In these cases, however, the lethal
action was still very good with a spore
kill of nearly 100%.

To assure a valid interpretation of
the sporicidal properties of the paint-
sterilant mixture, a spore recovery
test was necessary. As in the steriliza-
tion test, coupons were innocula-ted
and painted, but now the paint formu-
lation contained no formaldehyde.
The dried ‘coupons were pl-aced in
sterile water and the paint removed
by ultra-sonic scrubbing. Dilutions,
pour plates and plate counts were
made to determine the spore recovery.

Deposits recovered. The tabulated
results (spore recovery control)‘ show
that all spores deposited on the test
specimens were recoverable. Thus all
viable micro-organisms surviving ex-
posure to the pai-nt-sterilant mixture
al-so would be recoverable. Because
none were recovered after exposure to
most of the paint-sterilanit samples,
one must conclude the mixture to be
sterilizing. This formulation of ther-
mal coating and formaldehyde has
solved a difficult engineering problem
by experimentally proving to be an
excellent self-sterilizing coati-ng for
spacecraft surfaces. NASA has ac-
cepted these results and will use this
mixture on the Surveyor and on other
future extraterrestial space probes.

To build a rectangular color TV tube with more of a picture than the
earlier round tube type, and then squeeze it into a dimensionally
attractive cabinet—-you face almost insurmountable challenges.

Just to build a conventional color tube, you must . . .

1.—with absolute precision, lay more than a million red, blue,
and green phosphor dots in a perfect triad pattern over the entire
surface of the picture screen. Why so tough? — because the light
source for the dots is a single ray coming through a pinhole. And it
must be bent by a correction lens with precise mathematical cal-
culation (different for each dot) to pass through over a third-of-
a-million pinholes and fall exactly at a given spot on the screen.

2.—Once you've figured out the phosphor dots, you must then
bend the electron beam broadcast by the TV station so that it
too passes through the third-of-a-million pinholes.

These are just some of the feats you must perform. But after
going through all this, you wind up with a tube with a neck so
long it requires a cabinet nearly a yard deep to hold it. To shorten
the neck requires mathematical calculations and engineering
techniques so demanding they fall beyond any brief description.

The complexity of the 23-inch rectangular color tube develop-
ment is considered by some of our consumer products engineers
even more of a technological challenge than designing some of
the sophisticated command systems required for space flights.

A Presented by Dean H. E. Hoelseher at Alumni Banquet, March, 1965

Throughout most of my professional
life I have been concerned with the
twin proc-esses of teaching and re-
search, having as my principal goal
the education and traini-ng of young
men in -t-he methodol-ogies, the arts,
and t-he underlying sciences and
mathematics relating to that single
ﬁeld we call chemical engineering. I
now ﬁnd myself facing a much larger
challenge. I shall necessarily be con-
cerned with engineering in a broader
sense, with engineering area-s other
than my own speciﬁc ﬁeld of technical
competence, with programs, funds for
salary an-d equipment, and also, I sup-
pose, for things like desks a-nd chairs
and contingencies which never before
have bothered me. More important, I
shall now be concerned with some-
thing often called the image of a total
organization, a diffuse collation of
people with differing backgrounds,
ideas and abilities, all of whom must
work together toward a single collec-
tion of goals. Sir Eric Ashby observed
that “the university administrator,
unlike the biological scientist, cannot
eschew teleology. He must face
squarely the fa-c-t that universities do
not exist simply for their own sakes
as daffodils and sparrows and mice do.
They have a purpose. It is one of the
occupational risks of a university ad-
min-istrator that he must reﬂect on
the purpose of a universi-ty -a-nd not
infrequently make speeches on the
subject.” As one such — very much
the tyro at present — I must now re-
ﬂect on the purpose of that portion of
this great University for which I will

assume an administrative responsibil-
ity. As Sir Eric warned, I suppose I
must even make occasional speeches
about this.

Since the end of World War II,
education has become Big Business.
The population explosion has of course
been a major cause of this develop-
ment. But equally important to those
of us in Science and Engineering has
been the sudden — in human terms
— awakening of all people to the
dividends which may be expected from
scientiﬁc research and engineering de-
velopment. This spin-oﬂ’ of results
having consequences in the daily life,
the safety, comfort and well being of
man, from expenditures of time,
money, and human -effort for goals
completely unrelated to human wel-
fare seems now capable of justifying
the mul-ti-billion d-ollar cost of oﬂ"ense/
defense capa-bil-ities. The people of
this world hav-e come to realize th-at
education is a process whereby this
spin—oﬂ’ may be accelerated and they
therefore favor and support the uni-
versity now in new and expanded
efforts. Hence, the activity ha-s grow-n
in size and scope in response to these
new demands and wi-th this new
support.

As with any rapid growth, not
every change has necessarily been an
advance, n-ot every step has been
made with sensitivity for a proper
balance between all elements of the
problem. Universities have grown like
Topsy, and yet, until recently, there
seems to have been little concern with
such questions as “What is a univer-

sity?” What should a university be
in this modern technology—oriented
society?” “What is education?” and,
of more direct concern to those of us
in engineering, “What is engineering?”
“What is it becoming?” “What is its
proper role in the further develop-
ment of our civilization?” “How do
we shape and orient the processes of
engineering education to serve the
needs of those intent on functioning
as eng-in-eers?” “What special charac-
teristics, acquired or basic to the per-
sonality and ability of our product,
are both necessary and sufficient to
insure them some reasonable degree
of success?” These and many more
are questions which mu-st be asked
and, if possible, answered.

Let us begin by asking about the
qualities we hope to ﬁnd in graduates
— the product — from this educa-
tional process with which we are con-
cerned. It might then be possible to
work backwards t-o some better under-
standing of what we mu-st do to maxi-
mize occurrence of these qualities in
sufficient measure. The late Professor
R. S. Tour, for many years wit-h the
University of Cincinnati, once said to
me that there are three common char-
acteristics of persons who succeed in
engineering. First, one notes a capac-
ity for rational and sustained thought,
an ability to think. Secondly, there
must be an ability to learn, to acquire
information, data, that upon which
thought feeds, with which analyses
proceed, from which conclusions may
be drawn. Finally such persons de-
velop to college age having a person-

13

 
 

ality permitting effective operation in
a crowded world and motivated to-
ward the tasks they set themselves or
to which they ﬁnd themselves directed.
It would be nice, admittedly, if those
who are favored with healthy por-
tions of these three were also smiled
upon by fortune, the Lady Luck. We
then mu-st hope to ﬁnd these qualities,
perhaps in embryonic form, in those
whom we admit into our educational
process and we must prepare to help
those with such qualities mature.
How can the university provide a
setting in which this process may best
and most successfully proceed? It is
ﬁrst evident that the faculty must
recognize their strengths and their
limitat-ions, since from such self-
k-nowledge may 'come a better under-
standing of what can be done. Thus,
it seems to me we cannot change
those basic pers-onality or motiva-
tional traits which studen-ts bring to
college. They were long since fixed by
early environment. It seems equally
evident that we cannot teach our stu-
dents to think. We can exemplify the
process, we can guide, we can, by
guidance and example, assist th-is
latent or existing talent to develop.
Finally, information enters the human
brain through bu-t two ports, the eyes
and ears. Since these are largely con-
trolled by the individual, professors
can but make available the sights and
sounds permitting acquisition of new
knowledge —. the student must do the

. rest. And most as-suredly, we ﬁnd our-

selves without a formula for Luck.

Education, "then, must be that pro-
cess whereby those people with a la-
tent or existing talent struggle toward
discovery and development of their
individual and unique artistic and/or
intellectual potentials. The process
may be organized or formal or com-
pletely divorced from any regimen,
but. the goal for each should be a
richer knowledge and a more complete
awareness of talents and abilities de-
veloped by the process. Such people
may then cause or guide change in
our society.

It thus appears that our primary

‘ function must be to seek out those

who may be able to utilize success-
fully those facilities provided by the
university as part of the machinery

14

whereby this educational proces-s may
occur. We then admit such students
into this community of scholars, ac-
cepting a responsibility to nuture
their progress. This is, however, not
a simple matter. Teaching is a curious
business. Professors rarely have for-
mal tea-cher training in schools de-
signed for it but many nonetheless
function with wonderful effectiveness
in the classroom. Others mistakenly
associate a repetitive parroting or
droning dictantion of pred-igested in-
formation from antiquated books and
notes with teaching — a mistake their
students n-ever make. The dictionary
equates the verb to teach with to en-
able, to empower, to give lessons, to
train, to explain or show or state by
way of instruction. None of this is
adequate. The confusion, I think,

Dr. Harold Hoelscher

arises primarily from the assumption
that to teach implies a one-to-one cor-
respondence between presentation and
reception or absorption by t-he stu-
dent. To teach may be to give, to
explain, to guide —— never to train —
but it is mostly the process of inspir-
ing someone to learn. On this deﬁn-i-
tion, the primary function of the uni-
versity professor is to teach — to in-
spire his students to learn — and to
do so he himself must be a student.
The university structure was originally
conceived as a device to facilitate the

learning and teaching functions and I

this structure conti-nues to develop
for these purposes but within the
framework of twentieth century needs
and problems. Our present task must
be to decide upon a framework for

this school —— a set of goals — com-
mensurate with the University devel-
opment so well started, and, remem-
ber-in-g that our function is to educate,
to dedicate ourselves to seek these
goals, to ﬁnd new and better ways of
reaching them, and to further goals
to come.

Consider now that which distin-
guishes science from engineering, that
which makes engineering worthy of
separate status and deserving of stat-
ure as a respected academic sibling on
the university campus. It has been
said that the “bes-t educat-ion for an
engineer is simply the best scientiﬁc
education available.” I do not agree.
The best scientiﬁc education available
is necessary for a scientist but some-
thing more is required for those who
wish to practice engineering. Engi-
neering is a profession and, as such, it
must involve more than just the ap-
plication of _results from science and
mathematics to accomplish its ends.
Indeed such analyses as are made
possible by science and mathematics
are only the begi-nvnring of an attempt
to resolve fully an engineering prob-
lem situation. Such problems as are
of concern to engineers arise in the
real world and are by their very
nature of such complexity that a ﬁnal
solution in any form is usually not
available from science alone at any
lev-el of sophisti-ea-tion.

Approximation, simpliﬁcation, as-
sumption, and modeling are necessary
in the face of often dramatic economic
penalties for failure. Exactly which
assumption, which ‘approximation and
what models are likely to prove most
successful is a matter of judgment.
Judgment derives from experience
and skill a-n-d depends mos-t particu-
larly on an ability to extrapolate, on
the educated guess. Thus decision
making from bases which are not fully
justiﬁed scientiﬁcallly and for which
no complete or entirely satisfactory
rationale is available is part of the
game. This is w-hat I call the synthe-
sis step or more simply design. Be-
cause design is d~ifﬁcult to teach, and
it most assuredly is, does ‘not mean
that we can avoid its consideration.
It is even difficult to say just what
design involves and it may be easier
to say what it is not. For example, it

does not mean setting the number of
bolts on a bolt circle, the thickness of
the walls in a pr-essure vessel, or other
such routine activities for which the
primary source material is the hand-
book. It does mean the creative ex-
ercise of those tal-ents generated from
a ﬁrm and broad understanding of the
basic sciences and mathematics for
the purpose of bringing something
new or unique into the world of man
or for t-he resolution of some problem
which besets him. It seems almost
like more than just a discipline, rather
like a way of doing. Engineering may
be broadly deﬁned as the harnessing
of nature for the service and conve-
nience of man. An engineer, thus, is a
person speciﬁcally trained and experi-
enced in planning and developing the
structures and devices and in super-
vising the processes that bring about
this objective. Engineering uses re-
sults from science and business but is
not science nor bus-iness. It differs
fro-m pure science because it is co-n-
cerned with more than the business
of pure science, which is analysis. It
differs from pure business because it
is concerned with more than just the
ﬁnancial operations of its systems but
rather with such ﬁnancial operations
as may be involved to accomplish an
end aimed at technological improve-
ment or maintenance of a given tech-
nological state. The engineer’s role is
to take the basic relationships of
science and put them to Work for the
beneﬁt of m-an.

To teach engineers then requires an
engineering faculty of h-ighest caliber.
They must themselves be excited by
the twin processes of learn-ing and of
change in our society and the prob-
lems these processes engender. Th-ey
must be caught up in the wonder of

new ideas and by the fact that such A

new ideas may provide them with
new tools for old and new problems

alike, a-nd they must be capable of.

transmitting this excitement to their
students. I It requires a faculty willing
to be personally involved in the guid-
ance of students, pers-onally respon-
sible for passing those qualiﬁed into
the degree ranks, and, sometimes a
more diﬂ‘icult‘task, personally respon-
sible for denying the degree to those
who do not or cannot prove them-

selves qualiﬁed. Degrees are earned,
not given, and unless the selection
process is infallible (a situation not
of this world) then we must exepct
some who start to fail. This responsi-
bility must be accepted with humility
and exercised with honesty -and ﬁrm-
ness in the realization th-a-t the stan-
dards promulgated by the institution
in the quality of it-s graduates consti-
tutes its most precious and most
fragile possession.

I h-ave spoken about the educa-
tional process in a university and of
engineering within this framework.
There remains the question of ‘possible
engineering and curricula. A moment
ago I said that an engineer was a per-
son speci'ﬁcally trained in “developing
the structures and devices” and in
“supervising the processes” required

Dean Speaks to Alumni
by our society. It is evident, I think,
tha-t ‘there -are two distinctly diﬂ’eren't

A kinds of activities represented here,

one characterized by the word “de-
veloping” and the other charact-eriz-ed
by the word “supervising.”

The first is that engineeringa-ctivity
leading to -t-he new things, devices,
products, markets, structures which
appear’ from -ti-me to ‘time and keep
our economy vit-al and constantly im-
prove our -standard o-f living. This
activity requires an exercise of the

V highest levels of imaginative in-telli-

gen-ce, properly educated to have the
fullest appreciation for man, the struc-
tures of h-is society, and his needs and
then trained in the use of those tools
necessary to permit effective opera-

tion. It has become evident that
those who will do this kind of engi-
neering must have more than the
formal undergraduate exposure to
engineering education, that advanced
studies through the doctorate are de-
sirable and, even, that po-st-doctoral
studies are now becoming not
uncommon.

The second, the “supervising”
activity of engineering, is that respon-
sible for the maintenance of our tech-
nology, for the running of this
machine-dominated world in which we
live, for the continued production of
those consumer goods we take for
granted in our daily lives. For such
engineers, the program terminated
formally in the Bachelor’s degree is
now and probably will remain ade-
quate if augmented during a l-ife of
growth in and with society. The char-
acter of this formal ﬁrst degree pro-
gram has and must con-tinue to
change with time and it probably
should be different in many ways
from the ﬁrst four years for those in-
tending to tread the l-onger path to-
ward other goal-s. But it must be
recognized that both are part of one
profession — engineering — and dis-
tinctions between those in one or the
other path derive from difl"erences in
motivation and ‘in interest rather than
from obvious differences in ability.
Although ideas and knowledge are
responsibilities of science, the super-
vision of our technology-derived soci-
ety a-nd its growth and change are
twin responsibilities of engineers and
both those concerned with developing
the new and those concerned with our
existing structures work as partners.

As educators it is our responsibility
to see that both receive the education
and the training" permitting fullest
exercise of that complete array of tal-
ents, drives and frus-trait-ions which is
the learning man" who, will beneﬁt to
all men and society will be an engi-
neer. Then, given a faculty of highest
quality, dedication, and purpose and
a student body who is capable, eager
to learn, and willing to pu-t forth the
effort required of them, given loyal
and interested alumni and good
friends, this School will continue‘ to
grow tow-ard those high purposes held
for the entire University.

advanced, compared to what
others are doing?

It certainly is. As a matter of fact, much
of the work being done right now in uni-
versities and industry had its beginnings
in Air Force research and development
projects. After all, when you’re involved
in the development of guidance systems
for space vehicles—a current Air Force
project in America’s space program —
you’re working on the frontiers of
knowledge.

What areas do Air Force scientists
get involved in?

Practically any you can name. Of course
the principal aim of Air Force research
is to expand our aerospace capability.
But in carrying out this general purpose,
individual projects explore an extremely
wide range of topics. “Side effects” of

Air Force research are often as impor-
tant, scientiﬁcally, as the main thrust.

How important is the work a recent
graduate can expect to do?

It’s just as important and exciting as his
own knowledge and skill can make it.
From my own experience. I can say
that right from the start I was doing
vital, absorbing research. That’s one of
the things that’s so good about an Air
Force career—it gives young people the
chance to do meaningful work in the
areas that really interest them.

What non-scientiﬁc jobs does the
Air Force offer?

Of course the Air Force has a continu-
ing need for rated ofﬁcers—pilots and
navigators. There are also many varied
and challenging administrative-manage-
rial positions. Remember, the Air Force
is a vast and complex organization. It
takes a great many different kinds of
people to keep it running. But there are
two uniform criteria: you’ve got to be
intelligent, and you’ve got to be willing
to work hard.

What sort of future do I have
in the Air Force?

Just as big as you want to make it. In
the Air Force, talent has a way of com-
ing to the top. It has to be that way, if
we’re going to have the best people in

the right places, keeping America strong
and free.

What’s the best way to start
an Air Force career?

An excellent way-—the way I started—is
through Air Force Officer Training
School. OTS is a three-month course,
given at Lackland Air Force Base, near
San Antonio, Texas. that’s open to both
men and women. You can apply when
you’re within 210 days of graduation, or
after you’ve received your degree.

How long will I be committed
to serve?

Four years from the time you graduate
from OTS and receive your commis-
sion. If you go on to pilot or navigator
training, the four years starts when
you’re awarded your wings.

Are there other ways to become
an Air Force officer?

There’s Air Force ROTC, active at
many colleges and universities, and the
Air Force Academy, where admission
is by examination and Congressional
appointment. If you’d like more infor-
mation on any Air Force program, you
can get it from the Professor of Aero-
space Studies (if there’s one on your
campus) or from an Air Force recruiter.

now helps light Milan and power Italy's industrial boom

Westinghouse has supplied the world's
biggest atomic reactor of its kind to
Societa. Elettronucleareftaliana (SELNI).
Located at Trino, near’VMi_t‘/an, this plant
makes ‘ltaly,the third ‘largest nuclear pro-

biggest in continental Europe.

The whole countryside around Milan is
in the midst of an industrial boom. The
grain-rich Po river valley is now pour-

pharmaceuticals. This enormous growth

is a strain on the power resources of the
country, because Italy has an almost total
lack of domestic fuel. Atomic power . . .
which uses nuclear fuel . . . promises an

AERONAUTICS AND

Weather conditions can make or
break a scheduled ﬂight. The natural
elements are tricky and treacherous,
and once in the air a pilot cannot
park his plane and sit out a storm.
The man in the air must have a sharp
meteorological knowledge; his safety
depends on his ability to predict the
weather and estimate the safest routes
to ﬂy in any situation.

Weather and weather services fur-
nished by trained meteorologists are a
vital part of all ﬂight operations.
Pilots receive wea-ther information in
the form of long—range,. short-range
and local forecasts, weather maps and
sequence reports. In ﬂight, immediate
broadcasts of the lates-t Weather in-
formation keep the pilot abreast of
any unexpected activity.

Weather varies with changing atmo-
spheric pressure, air motion, moisture
content, temperature and other mea-
surable conditions. A jet can pass
-through‘ some of the hottest and
coldest regions in the world in a mat-
ter of minut-es as it ﬂies from sea level
through the tropopause into the lower
stratosphere. .

The tropopause is the region most
suitable for jet ﬂights. It is in be-
tween the troposphere and the strato-
sphere and varies i-n height with day
and season. In the middle latitude it
occurs at 25,000-35,000 feet; in the
tropics at 50,000 feet, occasionally ex-
tending to 70,000 feet in the summer.
A-t -the poles the tropopause is around
the 25,000 foot level.

Jet streams are often found near
the top of the tropopause. A pilot can
“hitch a ride” that can give him a
75 to 100 knot tailwind. There are as
many jet streams i-n the winter as in
the summer, however the wind s-peed
increases in the winter. These streams
move a few degrees north of their
average latitude in the summer and

south in the winter in response to the
much greater migration of -the direct
rays -of the sun. The seasonal d-ev-ia-
tion of the winds is greater in the wi-n-
ter than in the summer.

Below t‘he tropopause is the tropo-
sphere, a region of clouds and storms.
As on-e ﬂi-es through the middle and
upper troposphere the temperature
decreases aibout 0.4° to 0.8°C. per
100 meters and the wind speed in-
creases accordingly. The tropopause
begins where the temperature ceases
to decrease with -the increased altitude.

Above th-e tropopause is the strato-
sphere, generally dry and cloudless,
with horizontally circulati-ng air. This
region is nearly isothermal as it is in a
state of radiation equilibrium.

Clouds are the major Weather factor
affecting the air line industry. Land-
ings and take—oﬂ’s are more difficult
in low cloud formations; ﬂight in mid-
dle clouds cause turbulence and re-
quire instrument ﬂight; Vertically
developed clouds -may bring severe
storms and turbulence. Clouds can be
placed into four general categories:
high, middle, low, and vertically de-
veloped. There are four basic cloud
names: cirrus (icy and ﬁbrous), cu-
mulus (wooly and billowing), stratus
(layered), and nimbus (developed in
a head).

The high clouds have their low-er
mean level at about £0,000 feet. In
this category are the feathery cirrus-
unicus, the patchy cirrocumulus, and
the thin, veil-like cirrostratus. Cirrus
clouds are formed when a break in the
tropopause allows moisture to pene-
trate the lower stratosphere. The ice
crystal composition is due t-o the very
high altitude where temperatures are
low. The updrafts form south of par-
ticular jet streams; the activity of
such streams can be predicted from
the updraft movement.

Cirrocumulus clouds, commonly
called “mackerel sky” are feathery
and layered. They indicate an ap-
proaching storm.

The cirrostratus cover the sky in a
thin ﬁlm. Because these clouds con-
tain ice crystals, halos are usually
visible around t'he sun or moon. They
are not thick enough to cast a shadow
on the ground.

The cirrusunicinus are comma-
shaped and tuf-ted at one end. White,
delicate and without shadows, they
slowly cover the sky.

cirrusunicinus

Cirrocumulus

Cirrosfrafus

Middle class clouds. The middle
clouds are found at altitudes from
6,000 to 20,000 feet, and usually are
composed of water droplets. One of
the two main types is the altostratus.
This is a bluish sheet cloud, often
ﬁbrous. It is differentiated from the
cirrostratus by its failure to produce
the halo phenom-enon around the
moon or sun. However, a corona may
develop. A thick altostratus some-
times gives a light drizzle, and is
dense enough to obscure the sun or
moon.

Altocumulus or “sheep—back” clouds
are the second major type. They con-
sist of ﬂaky or ﬂat globular masses
arranged in a layer. Larger than the 
cirrocumulus, they have deﬁnite dark Semi-'|-rcmsparen“|' Alioc-umulus
shadi-ng underneath and in the middle
of each cloud element. Only in this
type of cloud are the edges thin and
translucent enough to exhibit insa-
tions (-bright plays of color).

_ ,. ma.

.6 a

One of the many varieties of the
altocumulus is the altocumulus len-
ticularis, produced by the uplift of
air over a mountain. Often occuring
at more than one level at a time, they
bring unstable weather as they begin
to thicken. The thickened clouds are
knows as altocumulus translucidus un-
dulatos. They form semi-transparent
bands or layers. The altocumulus
transl-ucidus is mad-e of a layer or
patches of slightly ﬂattened globular
masses. Blue sky appears between
the intusices.

Aliocumulus

Low clouds are found from near the
grou-nd to 6,000 feet, below a tempera-
ture inversion. These stratus clouds
S+"°+“5 chad are thin and often several thousand
feet deep. They are called fog if the
base is lower than 50 feet. Stra~tocu-
mulus clouds are formed by a tem-
perature inversion, an increase of
temperature with elevation. These
fair weather clouds appearing as long,
parallel rolls pushed together, fre-
quently produce a drizzle. They look
soft and gray with dark spots. Strong
winds occur beneath stratocumulus
rolls —— the air is smooth above the

rolls, but bumpy below.

The nlimbostratus is a layer type of
rain cloud. Often the precipitation
doesn’t reach the ground, making the
cloud base look wet and ill-d-eﬁned.
Its shape suggests an umbrella and it
seems to be lighted from within.

 

Vertically d-eveloped clouds extend

from 15,000 to 20,000 feet. Strong
vertical convection currents, arising
wh-en warm air is displaced by sur-
rounding colder air from the cumulus
clouds characteristic of this last cate-
gory. These. clouds are white, their
distended and swollen shapes sharply
deﬁned. The cauliﬂower top is the re-
sult of the eddies of violent currents
at the edges of the cloud. Cumulus
clouds appear in fair weather and do
not produce precipitation. Rain forms
as the cauliﬂower top softens and the
cloud becomes anvil shaped, charac-
teristic of the cumulonimbus. This
transformation occurs because the
cloud has grown to the level where ice
crystals are formed. Cirrus clouds are
found preceding upwards from the
anvil; at the base of the cumulonimbus
are layers and patches of altocumulus
clouds.
Siormy wea'|'her. The cumulonimbus
indicate an oncoming thunderstorm.
Whether thunderstorms are caused by
air being heated from below (air-
massed thunderstorms) or by air be-
ing forced up an incline plane (frontal
or orographic storms) they all have
the same general characteristics. Their
basic cause is strong updrafts ahead
of the s-torm which conflict with the
downdrafts in and around the cumu-
lonimbus causing a tremendous tur-
bulence. This severe turbulence, the
greater portion occuring ahead of the
storm is known as the roll cloud.
Gusts up to 60 or 70 m.p.h. precede
the storm, pulling the roll cloud with
them.

AH'os'l-rai-us Opacus

The British Ministry of Transport
and Civil Aviation, using facts from
actual ﬂights in turbulence reports
that attempts to maintain a constant
altitude in strong drafts may cause a
pilot to lose control of his aircraft.
Upward displacement increases with
altitude, the maximum displacement
for 90% of the ﬂights being 2,000 feet.

Downdrafts are usually not as
strong as updrafts, and their velocity
diminishes towards the lower levels of
the storm. The down-draft displace-
ment was 6,000 feet at an altitude of
2,000 feet, the lowest altitude ﬂown.
The downdraf-ts subsided when the
aircraft broke clear of the clouds
underneath the storm.

Thunderstorm turbulence appears
to increase with height up to about
half the vertical extent of the cloud,

Sircﬁocumulus

and then to remain about the same
with increasing height u-ntil the top
third of the cloud is reached, where it
decreases with height.

Pilots have found that ﬂying either
over the turbulence in the strato-
sphere or under it at the lowest pos-
sible altitude is best for practical
ﬂying during a storm.

Cumulonimbus occuring in a storm
front may not always be visible be-.
cause they can be masked by other
clouds. Low—level clouds may hide the
roll cloud, the dark rain area, and the
base of the actual thunderstorm. The
anvil top is hidden from low—ﬂying
aircraft by mult-i-layer shelves of non-
violent cumulus and stratus type
clouds which often extend for miles in
front of the thunderstorm.

The atmosphere, in attempting to

establish a stable condition and bal-
ance the strong upward currents,
manufactures gusty winds. The rising
air is cooled and it expands. Moisture
becomes visible -in the form of a cloud
when the air is sufficiently cooled. As
the clouds grow up to the freezing
level some of the moisture turns to
ice crystals. The water droplets and
ice crystals suspended in the clouds
by updrafts with a velocity of about
nine meters per second form larger
particles. When they reach the critical
size (over 3.5 millimeters in diameter)
the updraf-ts can no longer sustain
them and they fa-ll out of the cloud as
precipitation. If the fall through a
temperature zone of above 32°F. it
rains.

Charged-up clouds. In addition to
moisture the cloud has a static electric
charge. Positive and negative ions of
electricity are form-ed as the large
raindrops are smashed by the strong
upward current. The larger portion
of the fragmented drop carries a posi-
tive charge and the small-er portion a
negative charge. The small negative-
charged droplets are carried upwards
by the strong convection currents
while the heavier positive charged
droplets sink. In this way the top of
the cloud accumulates a high negative
charge wh-ile the base of the cloud or
ground assumes a positive charge. The
lightninggdischvarges from the positive
part of the cloud toward the negative
part of the same or neighboring cloud
or from the ground toward the nega-
tive part of the cloud.

The most frequent lightning ﬂashes
occur a-t the most violent point of the
storm. If the storm is being ap-
proached from the rear, the majority
of visible lightning ﬂashes will be
more horizontal than vertical. Con-
versely, if the ﬂashes are more vertical
than -horizontal the storm is being ap-
proached from t-he front and there is
greater violence. The presence of only
horizontal ﬂashes indicates a mild
storm well above the earth’s surface.

It is difficult to determine where
lightning has struck an aircraft. The
ﬂash is equally bright on all sides and
accompanied by a loud explosion. The
odor of ozone is present. In addition
to damaging the aircraft lightning
may temporarily blind or deafen the
pilot, causing him to lose control of

h-is ari-craft.

Hail can damage an aircraft by
breaking all glass cockpit enclosures
and inflicting severe structural damage.
However, experience has shown that
heavy hail is not a frequent hazard;
in 87 flights in-to tropical sto-rms hail
was encountered seven times and only
on-ce was reported moderate to heavy
(British Ministry of Transport and
Civil Aviation).

The procedure to minimize the pos-
sible hazard of hail is to stay as far
below the freezing level as practicable
and to hold the original course, since
hail is usually a localized phenomenon.
A high altitude of about 25,000 feet
or more offers t-he best alternative
course.

Hail is formed in the chimney of
the thundercloud at an altitude above
the freezing level. A widely accepted
theory on the formation of hailstones
is based on the growth of the hailstone
during a long fall th-rough subfreezing
layers during which it captures super-
cooled water drops that lie in its path.
These drops freeze and coat the
original small ice pellet with addi-
tional thicknesses of ice.

The worst hail is encountered

Cumulus Thunder

around the main storm cloud and
underneath the overhang-in-g shelves,
rather than in the core of the storm.
This theory is supported by reports of
heavy hail encountered in the clear
air outside a thunderstorm.

Hailstones vary in size from that of
a pea to a tennis ball. It takes a
vertical current of a-ir of approxi-
mately 100 knots (50 m/ sec) to sus-
pend a 10 cm diameter hailstone, and
ordinarily the updrafts do not exceed
25 m/ sec (50 knots).

The life cycle of a thunderstorm
cell is from two to three hours, and
may extend from one to ﬁve miles in
diameter. Other cells form near, but
separate from, the main cell. Those
cells in the developing or peak stage
and their boundaries are the areas of
grea-tes-t turbulence. The greatest tur-
bulence should be expected before
lightning or thunder occurs. In fact,
lightning in cumulonimbus may be an
indication that the storm has passed
its peak. Visual appearance of a cloud
does not permit an estimate to be
made of the degree of turbulence
likely to be encountered and there is
no sure method of ﬁnding the safest
way through a storm area. Limited

experience with airborne radar instru-
ments indicate that it can be expected
to reveal the majority of centers of
turbulence.

The atmosphere is a hierarchy of
motion systems, ranging from great
semipermanent rivers of air that ﬂo-w
around the globe to the tiny local
eddies that are responsible for such
necessary processes as precipitation
and wind. For the aeronautical mete-
orologist, the weather must be
reckoned with continually, regardless
of time of year or geographic locat-ion
of its occurrence. The meteorologist is,
in effect, the pilot’s partner, keeping
him constantly informed of the im-
mediate and long range conditions
and helping him plan ﬂights of maxi-
mum safety and efﬁciency. However,
the ﬁnal ﬂight decisions rest with the
pilot; he knows the capabilities of his
aircraft and should be able to inter-
pret the weather forecasts accordingly.

The forecast for the future of aero-
nautics and meteorology, in view of
recent success with Tiros indicates
more complete and more accurate
weather information available for
pilots, with an according increase in
passenger comfort and safety.

responsibility

A key dimension of any job is the responsibility
involved. Graduates who join Ford Motor Com-
pany ﬁnd the opportunity to accept responsibility
early ‘in their careers. The earlier the better. How-
ever, we know the transition from the academic
world to the business world requires training.
Scholastic achievements must be complemented by
a solid understanding of the practical, day-to-day
aspects of the business. That is the most direct
route to accomplishment.

Stephen Jaeger, of the Ford Division’s Milwaukee
District Sales Office, is a good example of how it
works. His ﬁrst assignment, in January, 1963,
was in the Administrative Department where he had the opportunity to
become familiar with procedures and communications between dealerships
and the District Oﬂice. In four months he moved ahead to the Sales Plan-
ning and Analysis Department as an analyst. He studied dealerships in
terms of sales history, market penetration and potentials, and model mix.
This information was then incorporated into master plans for the District.
In March, 1964, he was promoted to Zone Manager—working‘ directly with
19 dealers as a consultant on all phases of their complex operations. This
involves such areas as sales, ﬁnance, advertising, customer relations and
business management. Responsible job? You bet it is—especially for a man
not yet 25 years old. Over one million dollars in retail sales, annually, are
involved in just one dealership Steve contacts.

Lightning Machine. The Air Force
calls it a “mobile surge ‘generator.”
To the layman, it is really an artiﬁcial
lightning machine, and the Air Force
will use it to evaluate the effects of
lightning on advanced weapons sys-
tems. The trailer, designed by Clark
Equipment, is twice the ordinary
length and weighs 15 tons. The 84 foot
trailer with its hydraulic ﬂoating sus-
pension lifts the chasis for insertion
of horizontal beams to stabilize the
unit While operating. In the travel
position, the generator rests at full
length on the trailer chasis. Raised
for operation, it towers nine stories
above ground level.

Big Wheels. -Groodyear is using a new
construction concept to build pneu~
matic tires 50 feet in diameter. The
method involves making the tire in
strips, weaving the strips together and
bolting their ends to the wheel rim.
Tubes, ﬂaps, an-d tread liners are used
to mai-nt-ain air pressure and provide
puncture protection.

A single 50 foot pneumatic tire will
support a load of 165,000 pounds.
Because -the weight is spread over a
large ground area, it will create less
ground pressure than an ordinary
autlo tlire. This low force provides the
ability to traverse sand, mud, snow
and swampy terrain without bogging
down. The tires have enough displace-
ment to ﬂoat a giant land cruiser
across rivers and lakes.

Coolness. A room temperature vul-
canizing liquid silicone-rubber com-
pound, developed by General Electric,
has been demonstrated effective as a
ﬁreproof coating. A freshly cut rose
was placed in a cardboard container
coated with the rubbery ﬁreprooﬁng
material. Following one minute at
5,000°F, the ﬂower was removed un-
harmed and unwilted. The tempera-
ture inside the container increased
from 71° F to a modest 84°F. The
silicone-rubber compound not only
provides excellent insulation but also
is lightweight and has good buoyancy
in water.

 

Capsule. An experimental submarine
escape capsule has been fabricated by
Hercules Chemical for the Navy.
Spiralloy, which forms the capsule’s
thin but extremely strong shell, «is
made by winding glass ﬁlaments to-
gether with an epoxy resin. The re-
sultant structure, lighter than alu-
minum and stronger than steel, can
withstand tremendous pressures. The
lightweight spiralloy capsules provide
the high buoyance required to reduce
the travel time to the surface.

One of the requirements which gov-
erned the design of the capsule was
that of storage. As space is at a pre-
mium in a submarine, the capsules
were designed to be stacked one ‘inside
another. The capsule has a maximum
outside diameter of 24 inches and a
length of 66 inches.

Ask Rover about the engine’s unique heat exchanger that
doubled miles per gallon of fuel. They’ll tell you it was made of
a Corning—developed glass—ceramic trademarked CERCOR@.
Noel Penny, the engine’s designer, states: “The low coeﬂi-
cient of expansion, low thermal conductivity, high speciﬁc heat
and economic feasibility of CERCOR glass—ceramic made it the
logical choice for the Rover, with a much better prospect for
future gas turbine engines than any metal counterpart.”
Today glass can do jobs that metals can’t—and more. Much

NASA TECH BRIEF

 

Heater

The problem. To prevent oil mole-
cules from reaching the work area of
a vacuum chamber by backstreaming
from an oil diffusion pump. Previous
methods employed cryogenic baffles
that were not 100% eﬂicient and these
imposed additional load on the vac-
uum pump. Even a minute amount of
oil in the work area can adversely
affect delicate electronic or optical
work.

The solution. A hea-ter placed be-
tween the pump and the vacuum
chamber breaks backstreaming oil
molecules into basic constituents, that
can be pumped away.

How i‘I"s done. The heater is formed
by -threading a continuous nichrome
wire through two high-temperature
insulating rings and positioning the
rings so that installed wires are per-
pendicular to each other, effectively
forming -a grid pattern. The heater is
placed at -the intake -to the pump in
the air stream. A current of 10 am-
peres a-t 200 volts is applied to the
heater elements bringing them to a
cherry red at a temperature of ap-
proximately 900°C.

Oil molecules coming in Contact
with this thermal barrier will decom-
pose into their basic constituents and
be rendered harmless. A -tetraphenyl—
tetra-methyltrisiloxane oil widely used
in diffusion pumping can be expected
to reduce to methane, carbon oxides,
water vapor, and silicons. These pro-
ducts can be either pumped away or
allowed to remain in the vacuum
chamber since they are all harmless
in most vacuum experiments.

This device does away wi-th the
need for cryotrapping with liquid
nitrogen, previously employed at
great expense. By interposing only a
few thin wires into the air stream, it
leaves rated pumping speeds relatively
unchanged.

34

Bonding

The problem. To develope a method
of forming high-strength joints be-
tween butting or overlapping surfaces
of thoriated nickel (a dispersion of 2%
by weight of thoria in a matrix of
nickel). Thoriated nickel combine-s
the properties -of good workability
(ductility) wi'th adequate strength
and resistance to corrosion at elevated
temperatures (up to 2,300°F). This
material cannot be satisfactorily
joined by conventional weldting meth-
ods, however, because the inert thoria
particles agglomerate in the weld area.
The ' solution. Solid-state diffusion
bondi-ng of the material in an inert-
gas atmosphere. This method elimi-
nates inert-phase agglomeration and
produces a high—strength metallic
bond.

How i-|"s done. The areas of the
specimens to be bonded are ﬁrst
cleaned with acetone and water and
then brought into contact (over-
lapped as shown in the illustration of

Insulating

Rings

.

/(fl

Elements
§

    

a laboratory setup). The contacting
specimen-s (tack—welded by capacitor
discharge at the corners of the over-
lap to maintain them in the proper
relative position) are then placed in
the bonding apparatus. Bonding is
affected by means of direct resistance
heating and application of a compres-
sive load to the overlapping areas of
the specimens. An atmosphere of
argon gas is maintained in the appa-
ratus during the bonding process in
order to prevent oxidation of the base
metal in the specimens. Compressive
load-s of 12,500 psi and 8,000 psi main-
tained for 1 minute at temperatures
of 2,000°F and 2,150°F, respectively,
produced joints capable of withstand-
ing roo-m-temperature shear stresses
of up to 52,000 psi.

The results of tests on thoriated
nickel strips bonded by this method
indicate that the joint strength is a
linear function of the bonding pres-
sure. Specimens bonded at 2,000°F,
using a bonding pressure of 8,000 .psi,
exhibited a shear strength of 52,000 psi
(approximately 93 percent of the base
metal strength).

This method, using somewhat dif-
ferent processing parameters, also
produced satisfactory bonding be-
tween thoriated nickel and a precipi-
taitiomstrengthened nickel superalloy.

QUICK DAMPING

Shock Absorber Operafes Over Wide Range

How i'|"s done. The metering system
contained within the hydraulic (oil-
ﬁlled) cylinder consists of a central
metering tube with three oriﬁces, a
metering groove, and a spring—and-
ball pressure regulator valve. Fluid
se-als are used between the outside
diameter of the piston and the cylin-
der bore, and between the inside.dia—
meter of the piston and the metering
tube to ensure oil ﬂow through the
proper channels (oriﬁces, metering
groove, or pressure regulator) when
diﬂ’eren--t energy loadings are
encountered.

When low energy rates are en-
countered, the piston rod moving into
the cylinder causes the oil to ﬂow
through oriﬁce A Only. This orfice has
a constant damping coefﬁcient, so
that the force resist-ing the motion of
the piston will vary as the square of
the piston velocity.

Maximum energy rates cause the
piston to move past oriﬁce A, forcing
the oil to ﬂow through the metering
groove. This groove is tapered to vary
the dampening coefficient as a func-
tion Of piston stroke and thus provide
an essentially constant damping force
for maximum energy absorption.

Quick dam-pin-g to absorb rotational
energy of the vehicle is provided after
the piston has moved past oriﬁces A
and B. Oil then ﬂows sequentially
through oriﬁce C, the pressure regu-
lator, and oriﬁce B. In this phase of
operation, the hydraulic force resisting
motion of the piston is constant, re-
gardless of piston velocity, and of
sufficient magnitude (controlled by
adjusting «spring compression in the
pressure regula-t-Or) to minimize the
piston displacement required to
absorb the relative angular momen-
tum of the veh-icle.

The‘ damping characteris'tics, a-nd
thus the forces generated during the
three phases of operation, can be in-
dependently varied to achieve the
desired overall action of the shock
absorber.

The general design of t=he shock
absorber may be modiﬁed in a num-
ber of ways without affecting the prin-
ciple of operation. One or more of
‘these devices may be mounted to
operate singly or jointly on a vehicle.

The problem. To develop a light-
weight apparatus -that will produce
small amounts of fresh water for
individual survival on the open sea.
The solution. An inﬂatable buoyant
apparatus th-at utilizes solar energy as
a source of heat for distilling seawater
into fresh water. The still, weighing
only 1 pound a-nd occupying a volume
of only 40 cubic inches when pack-
aged, is capable -of producing -approxi-
mately 2 pin-ts of drinking water a
day.

How i'l"s done. The materials used
in the construction of the still are
polyvinyl chloride and a black taffeta
which serves as a solar energy
absorber. The still, normally folded
into a com-pact package, is readily in-
ﬂated to form a buoyant pyramidal
structure when it is desired to make
it operational. An outer envelope of
transparen-t polyvinyl chloride serves
both as a Window for solar radi-ation
and as a condensing surface for the
fresh water evaporated from the
heated salt water container on the
absorber material on the inside base
of the still. Seawater is -admitted to
the absorber material by means of
tubing connected to a small reservoir
which is fastened to one of the sloping
faces of the transparent envelope. The
distilled water condensing on the slop-

36

ing inside surfaces of the envelope
ﬂows down to the inside base of this
envelope and thence through a tube
to a small storage bag. This bag is
weighted to keep it sub-merged be-
neath the surface of the sea to cool
the distilled water.

 

Tifanium

The problem: To promote good
wetting and ﬂow of ﬁlter metal or
brazing alloys on metal surfaces to be
joined by welding. Alloys with good
wetting and flow characteristics im-
prove metal joint -capillarity during
the brazing process and also yield a
more homogeneous weld of greater
strength.

The solufion: Improve the Wett'a-
bility and ﬂow of standard brazing
alloys by -pretreating th-e -parent metal
with a thin coating of pure titanium.
How i1"s done: Beryllium alloy sam-
ples are placed on a support in a bell
jar and a sheet of pure titanium is
placed in a holder below them. ‘The
bell jar is evacuated and a-n electron
beam of ‘three kilowatts power at
n-ium plate for about 5 minutes. This

generates suﬂicient heat to pudd-lei

and vaporize the plate and a coating
of pure titanium about two microns
thick condenses on the beryllium
alloy samples above.

The samples are then brazed by
electron beam with a standard silver/
lithium/copper brazing alloy. Metal-
lurgical microphotographs of pre-
treated and non pretreated brazed
specimens show-ed improvement by
pretreating of the wett-ing character-
istics of the brazing alloy to a
remarkable degree.

Notes: 1. The brazing process need
not immediately follow the pretreat-
ment process. Pretreated items have
been s-tored for considerable periods
and then brazed with no loss of weld
quality.

2. This process could improve the
quality of silver/copper/zinc/lithium
brazing of carbide tips to tool shanks.
It could also be used for brazing the
chromium /nickel ty-pes of stainless
steels.

3. The pretreatment could be used to
advantage in the manufacture of
aviation and aerospace components
where high strength-to-weight ratios
must be achieved.

“Well, I see all of you forgot it was your dad’s birthday,
didn’-t you?” mumbled the hunt old man.

“Gee, Dad, we’ve been so busy we just forgot all
about it.”

“I guess I should forgive you. Forgetfulness runs in our
family. I even forgot to marry your mother.”

“What! “shrieked the sons in un-ison. “You mean

take much pleasure in the recognition accorded us for
contributions in materials and technology to super-
power infrared lasers for surgery. Our laser work will
be absorbing some of the physicists, electrical engineers,
and perhaps even mechanical engineers among those
who will be joining us from the campus in a few more
months. Others of these Class of 1966 engineers we
shall soon have working in technologies that they have
never even heard of before signing on.

Great! But before he does sign, the kind of chap who
particularly interests us is sharp enough to give a
thought to 1976. So do we. We fear technological ob-
solescence too, and his 1976 is our 1976.

In due time he will be surprised to learn about some
of the businesses we expect to be in then. As a thought-
ful person, he will be pleased to see how they relate to
the genuine needs (not just the frivolities) of the living
human beings in a peace-based society. In due time he
will be phased in when the fundamental research now
in progress is ready for the engineering that will make
it practical.

Don’t expect to read all the details in an ad. Get in
touch with us. By a wise early choice of employer it is
still possible to enjoy the immediacy and the amenities
of a career in industry without a heavy price in personal
technological obsolescence.

SEMINAR’S DEATH
THROES

During the past summer, while most engineering stu-
dents were not on campus, the Administration decided
to strip down and de-emphasize the seminar program.
In light of this decision, let us review the good and bad
points of the old seminar program.

For the past twenty years, undergraduate engineers
have attended weekly seminar meetings. These gather-
ings not only fostered a strong intradepartment spirit,
but also uniﬁed the engineers into a well -integrated
student body. Because most engineers do not belong to
Greek letter societies, they turned to seminar for social
and athletic participation. Here plans were announced
for next week’s football game and arrangements
formulated for this term’s beer blast.

But more important than the student-student rela-
tionship, was that of industry and the student. Compe-
ten-t speakers with industrial experience lectured on
various technical subjects at these meetings. In these
seminars, the undergraduate engineer ﬁrst met industry
and vice Versa. In these seminars, the undergraduate
engineer ﬁrst summed up his wide spattering of -technical
knowledge into an applicable quantity. And in these
seminars, the undergraduate engineer ﬁrst oriented him-
self and planted the vital seeds of professionalism.

Unfortunately seminar’s noble goal-s were -not always
achieved. Many ‘meetings were, admittedly, complete
wastes of time. Some lecturers discussed topics far too
complex for most of their listeners to comprehend. Some
lecturers discussed topics not even remotely related to
engineering. And some lecturers With negligible back-
ground in public speaking ruined excellent topics by
putting the class to sleep.

Thus many seminar programs failed. But these fail-
ures were not inherent in the old seminar system. They
may be attributed solely to the poor planning which
frequently existed in both the departmental and joint
level. Lecturers were invited on the basis of their tech-
nical background, regardless of their topic or their public
speaking ability. The frequent lack of communication
between the speaker and his audience is a testimony to
this fact. Had topic and speaking ability been chosen
as the criterion of invitation, then all seminars would
have been successful.

When it was originally conceived, the seminar pro-
gram was healthy an-d strong. Recently it has grown
sick and weak. Rather than giving seminar medicine,

the Administration now is killing it by deleting half the
scheduled weekly meetings and substituting an “engi-
neering activities or departmental seminar”.

The results have been predictable. No professional
or honorary group is independently hold-ing meetings on
the days designated “engineering act-ivities or depart-
mental seminar”. Not even Engineering and Mines
Cabinet is using this time. One society, Omega Chi
Epsilon, the Chemical Engineering honorary fraternity,
is meeting in the seminar room designated for all Chemi-
cal Engineers. Thus a non-mem-ber Chemical Engineer
is cheated that week. Since most departments do not
require attendance at their optional seminars, it is dif-
ﬁcult to plan a good, concrete program. Not many
speakers will devote an hour talk-ing to a sparse handfull
of engineers in a near empty lecture hall.

As students, there is much we can do, for there is
little that has been done. The Administration attributed
this seminar revision to a suggestion from Engineering
and Mines Cabinet. This suggestion was never discussed
at any Cabinet meeting. Nor has any member of
Cabinet, in an official or unofficial capacity, ever dis-
cussed this matter with the Administration. Yet when
this point was brought up at a Cabinet meeting, the
represent-a'tives refused to take any stand what-so-ever.

Before Dean Hoelscher took over, the Administration
decided to strip down seminar. Since the new Dean
appears to be very pro-student i-t is hopeful he will re-
view and revise this decision. As students, we must
solicit responsible action from our Cabinet representa-
tives. We must also congratulate and su-pport those
departments which are holding effective meetings during
the periods labeled “engineering activities or depart-
mental seminar”. But most of all, we must not yield
like umbrella toting Chamberlains and watch seminar
painfully killed.

Another of your future's many facets at Monsanto

With a company growing as fast as Monsanto (annual sales quadrupled to a hefty
$1.2 billion in little more than a decade), design of new plants, equipment and
systems has never been so important. Engineers are needed to apply their skills
and knowledge . . . in known and unknown areas . . . to help us manufacture the
new and improved products that move Monsanto ahead——500 new products in the
last 10 years.

We can show you what this means in terms of increased professional opportunity
. . . how Monsanto's continuing expansion affords more and interesting growing
room for you.

See your Placement Director to arrange for an interview when we visit your campus
soon. Or write today for our brochure, “Your Future and Monsanto,” to Manager,

Does this look
like an answer

,_,,,,,,,,,.....  .. -. ...

to global problems of ignorance,
disease and physical deprivation?

Not yet. But we're getting closer.

Behind this movement is a simple statistic with startling im-
plications for all of us — If you count all the scientists and
engineers since the beginning of recorded history, ninety
percent are alive today!

We are now in the midst of the result—an incredible explo-
sion of information from every corner of the globe. And
somewhere within this explosion will be the ultimate answers
to mankind's oldest, and newest problems.

The challenges are many. First, to understand the nature
of this giant intellectual force. Then, to find the best way to

 

 

collect it, classify it, store it...and distribute it appropriately
and instantly to the people who need it.

In this light, you might consider today's Xerox products early
and primitive steps along a difficult but_ fascinating path.
You'd be right. Yet, has anyone taken these steps before us?

Your degree in Engineering, Science, Business Administration
or Liberal Arts can qualify you for some intriguing openings
at Xerox, in fundamental and applied research, engineering,
manufacturing, marketing/sales, finance and administration.

XEROX

The Xerox 914 Copier revolu-
tionized the office copying in-
_dustry when it was introduced
in 1959...and really started us
on our way.

Less than 3 years later, the 813
further extended low-cost, qual-
ity office copying. One-seventh
the volume of the 914, it does
just about everything the 914
does except copy solid, 3-dimen-
sional objects.

XEROX. 914. M3. 2400 AND LDX ARE TRADEMARKS OF XEROX CORPORATION

Another revolution. An electro-
mechanical-chemical-optical de-
vice called the 2400 because it
produces 2,400 copies per hour
directly from an original docu-
ment. No stencil or “master"
of any kind. You press a button.
