How to get the


most out of a


job Interview:

Every company that interviews col-
lege students is interested in hiring
students with high potential. But
matching the right man with the right
company is a complex assignment.
How can you know which company
you should join? You can't know for
sure, but you can get a reasonably
accurate indication if you make the
most of your campus interview. Be-
low are a few suggestions to assist you
in making such an interview with
Koppers more worthwhile and produc-
tive for you.


W   Before the interview, stop in
    your Placement Office and re-
view in some detail the literature
explaining Koppers diversified line
of products and services. Become
familiar with Koppers eight operat-
ing divisions and the particular con-
tribution each makes to industry.
O Try to determine as specifically
    as you can the type of work
that seems to interest you most.
Then question the interviewer as to
how that type of work fits into
Koppers many activities. If, like
many graduates, you find that your
interests cover many areas of work,
tell the interviewer. You'll find that
he will understand your problem


and may be of help in deciding on
the kind of "Koppers opportunity"
for which you would be best suited.
-Be prepared to outline your
    accomplishments. He will be in-
terested in your extra-curricular ac-
tivities as well as your scholastic
achievement. Point out any part-
time or summer experience which
you may have had. If you can effec-
tively communicate to the inter-
viewer your background and inter-
ests, both you and he will be better
able to decide whether or not this
is the right opportunity for you.
    Review with the interviewer
    Koppers on-the-job training
program. This program is designed


to allow you to make an immediate
and recognizable contribution. You
go to work-you don't return to the
classroom for training. You will be
working on projects that will permit
you to apply the knowledge you have
gained through your college training,
while at the same time you will be
furthering your knowledge and un-
derstanding of your field.
F   Ask the interviewer about job
    location, military policy, educa-
tional assistance policy, and any
other questions which you may have
about the Company. He will be
happy to provide any information he
can to assist you in getting the most
from your Koppers interview.


If the possibility of a career with Koppers interests you, contact your Placement Office
and arrange to see the Koppers representative on his next visit to your campus.

                          MAGIC

HOW IT ALL BEGAN
  There are many theories concerning the actual dis-
covery of glass-a caveman, extinguishing his fire, may
have noticed that the ash and silica had fused, forming
a hard, solid substance-a nomad on the desert may have
had the same experience. In Biblical times and during
the Roman era, glass beads were valued as jewels. Even
our early settlers traded valuable glass beads for land.
For centuries, men have been aware that glass could
be drawn into filaments of exceptional strength. At first
these filaments were used to beautify beads and vases.


  RALPH SMITH, a sophomore C.E., was a draftsman
for Koppers Co. for two years before deciding to go to Pitt
on a full time basis. Ralph is a native of Pittsburgh and
has spent three years in the Army Security Agency, two
of them in China. This is Ralph's first editorial contribu-
tion to appear in the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.


Then, attempts were made to weave them into fabric.
   In 1893 a glass fabric, which sold for $25.00 a yard
 when the best silks were only $1.25, was tailored into a
 dress and exhibited at the Chicago World Fair. But, it
 had more value to its designer, Edward Libbey, as a
 novelty than as a garment-the fibers were too coarse
 and inflexible to allow the wearer to sit down, and it
 could not be creased or folded.
   Years of experimentation were culminated in the 1930's
 as many industries explored the possibilities of producing
 glass fiber. However, nearly three years of laboratory re-
 search were necessary to perfect a method of making
 filaments of molten glass into resilient fibers. Another
 four years passed before glass fibers could be assured a
 future, promising enough to commence commercial pro-
 duction. Now, in the present jet age, industry is con-
 stantly searching for fabricating materials which are
 lighter, but stronger-adaptable, yet inexpensive. No one
 material has more completely suited the demand than
 fiber glass.

 UNIQUE COMBINATION OF PROPERTIES
 Fiber glass has a unique combination of physical and
 chemical properties which is making it one of today's
 basic fabricating and structural materials. Used as a
 reinforcement in conjunction with the new resins, includ-
 ing the polyesters, phenolics, epoxys, furanes, silicones or
 the thermoplastics, it can be molded into forms or made
 into laminates possessing tremendous impact strength.
 Pound for pound, these combinations have a higher
 strength-to-weight ration than any of the commonly used
 fabricating materials, including steel. Fiber glass fila-
ments can be produced with a tensile strength exceeding


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER



200,000 p.s.i. This is considerably greater than 30,000 to
50,000 p.s.i. for rayon and 65,000 to 85,000 p.s.i. for nylon.
The strength of fiber glass yarns is unaffected by tempera-
tures up to 400' F. If subjected to higher temperatures,
there is a progressive decrease in strength, but, even at
temperatures at 700* F., more than half of the original
strength is maintained. Excellent dimensional stability
is verified by the fact that individual fibers, at maximum
stress, register only a 3% elongation. Fiber glass is not
influenced by atmospheric changes and will not shrink
or stretch any more than the glass in our windows. It is
chemically stable, has no color, and cannot burn, rust,
mildew, rot, or produce any odor. Fiberglass cannot oxi-
dize, since all of the constituent elements of glass. are
already completely oxidized in the production process.
With the exception of hot phosphoric and hydrofluoric,
it is impermeable to acids and weak alkalies. Since it is
a true glass, fiber glass is non-cellular and therefore com-
pletely wetproof beyond surface wetting. These proper-
ties combine to make fiber glass virtually ageless.
PRODUCTION OF GLASS YARN AND MAT
  The production of this wondrous fiber begins with the
accurate weighing and combining of the eight basic raw
materials . . . silica, limestone, boric acid, clay, fluorspar,
sodium sulphate, ammonium sulphate, dolomite, and coal.
This is controlled automatically from a control panel in
the "batch control center." When the "batch," as the
mixture of raw materials is called, is gathered, the approx-
imately 3,200 pounds of raw materials is conveyed to the
batch delivery system. Here it is transferred to smaller
buckets which are moved to a receiving station and then
to the melting furnaces as needed. In the furnaces, the
raw materials are reduced to molten glass at temperatures
ranging from 2300' F. to 2800" F., depending on the
finished product.
  The molten glass is allowed to flow, by gravity, through
microscopic orifices in platinum bushings, mounted on
the furnace. The number of holes in the bushings ranges
from 200 to 1200, again depending on the type of fiber
being produced. As the streams of glass emerge, they are
sprayed with a chemical binder.
  If the batch is to be made into superfine fiber glass, the
streams of molten glass are then blasted with jets of steam,
which attenuates it into a filmy mass. The superfine glass
pieces fall to a conveyor belt and are removed to be dried
and pressed into blankets. These mats are the form of
fiber glass we know as insulation and sound deadening
material. Fiber glass mats may also be utilized in some
of the final molding processes.
  If yarn is to be drawn from the batch, the streams of
molten glass are gathered on high-speed winders at a rate
of over two miles per minute. Since the winder moves so
rapidly, the glass seeping through the orifices is submitted
to a tension and is drawn into minute filaments. Some
may be as thin as .0002 inches in diameter. This is about
1/300 the diameter of a human hair. This extreme thin-
ness is the property which gives fiber glass fabrics their
flexibility.
  The diameter and finish of the yarns varies with the

                                                               This, combined with simple designing of forms, yields
                                                               a high rate of production. The fiber glass is added as a

                                        A .-                   into a chopper near the press. Small, chopped strands of

type of application they perform. After the strand has
been formed and wound, processing is continued on con-
ventional textile twisting, plying and winding machinery
to produce fiber glass yarns and cords. These are then
used on standard textile mill equipment. At the mills,
the yarns are woven into many forms. It may be made
into tape, screening, or cord, or most important of all,
fiber glass cloth. The cloth can be of various patterns
and weaves for decorative fabrics, such as drapes. Or, it
can be in the form of reinforcing cloths to be used with
resins and plastics in forming strong, laminated panels
for awnings, boats, auto bodies, and appliances. The list
can go on and on.

must resist movement, mat or fabric is generally used.
In many cases die-cut mat or fabric can now be obtained
from manufacturers, thereby eliminating cutting to shape
by the molder.
  Fiber glass reinforced plastics made by contact molding
require only the pressure of contact. The mold is a single
piece and can be made of plaster, wood, metal, plastic,
or concrete. Glass mat or fabric is laid in the mold. It
is then sprayed with a catalyst, accelerated resin is painted
or poured on the glass and the air is worked out by brush-
ing or rolling. In contact molding, the finish of the rein-
forced part not in contact with the mold will not be of
the highest quality, since no pressure is applied during
the operation.
  A recent innovation to the fiber glass molding field is
the prepared compoundo or "pre-mix." This is a mold-
able, dough-like material composed of chopped strands
of fiber glass, unsaturated polyester resin, and filler. The
pre-mix can be molded in conventional compression or
transfer molding equipment. Automotive, electrical, and
electronic industries familiar with the outstanding prop-
erties of fiber glass are now using this pre-mix method
to mold many of their complex components.

now completed the initial SPUR design
studies and proved the project's feasi-


bility to supply continuous accessory
power and low thrust electrical propul-
sion in space for long periods of time.
  Cutting projected 1 MW power sys-
tems to 1/10th the size and 1/5th the
weight of present power systems under
development will be possible because
of SPUR's capability to operate at
higher temperatures, thereby sharply
reducing the required radiator area.

AN


ED UCA TION


By WILLIAM F. SINGLETON


The purpose of an engineering college is to educate.
This seems like an obvious statement, but the expanse
of the word "educate" is not so obvious. For an engineer-
ing college, the prime objective is to stimulate the student
to the joy of learning. This is done by presenting the
fundamental laws and methods of the students' chosen
profession and of the fields in the periphery of his own,
with the hope he will extend himself not only in the
learning of these basic laws but in further study either
on the graduate level or in industry. This job is carried
out by the faculty, and, in order for them to be able to
relate the fundamentals to possible application, they must
keep abreast of the new techniques that are constantly
being developed in this world of dynamic thinking. This
requires many hours of reading and study, and often times
it requires a deviation from the teaching profession while
these advanced ideas are studied and made feasible for
classroom presentation.
  Since the great majority of engineering students will
eventually find themselves in the industries of the world,
a part of the education process is to orient the student to
these industries. This, of course, is a difficult job with
the many diversified industries existent in our own coun-
try and throughout the world. This duty is carried out


  WILLIAM F. SINGLETON, a senior E.E. is the Cir-
cluation Manager for the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.
Bill is also a member of Phi Eta Sigma, Druids, Omicron
Delta Kappa, Eta Kappa Nit, I.R.E., and A.I.E.E. He is
the President of the Pennsylvania Society of Professional
Engineers (Student Chapter) and of the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet.


by the administrators through their efforts to present
numerous speakers who are aware of this necessity. In
addition, the student chapter of the Pennsylvania Society
of Professional Engineers offers outstanding programs
which attempt to point out the necessity of ethical con-
duct on the part of the engineer and his duties as a
citizen of the United States. The technical societies in
the various engineering fields, also offer seminar programs
consisting, for the most part, of people directly from in-
dustry who present particular subjects. At the conclusion
of the programs the student body is free to ask questions.
  Another aspect of the word "educate" which is on a
par with the gaining of technical skills and techniques,
is the necessity to communicate and work with other
people. In many cases the engineer will be working side
by side with non-technical people and in order to "get
the job done" he must be able to instruct and explain to
these people his needs and desires. Then, when he does
complete the project, he must sell it not only to his su-
periors, but often he must instruct the salesmen and
servicemen in its operation in order that the object might
be sold. In the case of the engineer employed by the very
small organization the necessity of communication is even
more acute because he often finds that he does the research,
design, development, production, and selling of a particu-
lar item which means he ultimately must deal with the
layman, the person who has no knowledge whatsoever
of the technical complexities involved. Then, of course,
there is the life of the consulting and teaching engineer
whose very sub-title bears out the definite need and ability
to present ideas.
  So, the obvious conclusion is that unless one wants to
be put into a corner of the office with heaps of raw data,
stacks of graph paper, a well greased slide rule, and all
the formulas necessary to grind out the answers, which in
turn will probably be presented to an engineer with less
technical skill but more "education," one had better
realize the necessity of communication.
  Now, the student who is completely oriented to the
block schedules will probably run to his advisor and ask
why Communication One was not put on his schedule
and he will politely be informed that no such course
exists. There are many courses available at the University
in Public Speaking, English, Literature, etc., which are of
tremendous importance. But the fact remains that for a
person to become adept at presenting his views and ideas
in a way that is understandable to all, he needs more than


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER




this formal training. He needs practice in its application.
   In the School of Engineering and Mines this training is
readily available to any and all who seek it. Primarily,
this very important type of learning can be received
through the many activities and programs presented by
the Engineering and Mines Cabinet, which is the planning
body of the E&M Association.
   This group is comprised of an elected representative
from each class of every department in addition to repre-
sentatives from the Skyscraper Engineer and E &S M Bulle-
tin making a grand total of thirty-eight active members
plus a faculty advisor. An executive committee is elected
from this group consisting of a President, Vice-President,
Treasurer, Recording Secretary, Corresponding Secretary,
Coordinator of Committees, and Physical Plant Director.
These offices are presently held by: William Singleton,
Kurt Nestel, Richard Fusco, Charles Shawl, William Ma-
son, Nicola Marino, and Richard Hatala respectively. The
faculty advisor is Dr. Edward B. Stuart of the Chemical
Engineering Department.
   E & M Cabinet plans and promotes a diversity of activi-
ties so that not only the 38 active members gain the neces-
sary benefits mentioned earlier, but an equal opportunity
to work, play, and communicate with students of varying
desires, skills, and professions.

  One such promotion is the inter-departmental sports
program set up under the direction of Cabinet with Bill
Kelly as its chairman. The fact that Bill is not a mem-
ber of Cabinet points out that education of this sort
is available to those who seek it. The sports program
consists of all the major seasonal sports such as: touch
football, bowling, basketball, softball, etc. Any other
sport that is desired by the student body will be planned
and controlled by the sports committee upon request.
The construction of the new, olympic style swimming pool
at the University opens many doors for the future in this
area. In addition, there are more playing fields and ten-
nis courts in the planning stages which will make the
sports program more complete in the future.
  E Sc M Cabinet also conducts at least one social event
of major proportions during each trimester. This com-
mittee is headed by Larry Tavlirides who is working dili-
gently to increase interest in the social events and to
improve their quality but not their cost. In addition is
the Outstanding Senior Committee-chairman, Joe Balazs
-which polls the students and faculty and makes an
award to the outstanding senior of the School of Engineer-
ing and Mines. There also is the Outstanding Seminar
Committee with Gerald Murphy at the helm which judges
the various departmental seminars to see which one is
best furthering the orientation process. The Freshman
Interest Program attempts to enlighten the new freshman
to the many possibilities available to him with the hope
that he will more readily make the transition from high
school to college life.
  The Engineering and Mines International Travel and
Training Award, known as EMITT, provides an eight
week travel and training scholarship to Europe for out-
standing engineering juniors. The chairman of this com-


mittee is William Hosick, who received the award last
year and traveled to England. Of course the number of
these awards made is directly proportional to the funds
available, so Bill and his committee are working diligently
in an attempt to raise this money.
  In the field of publications, E g& M Cabinet originated
the Skyscraper Engineer which is now "on its own." In
addition, the E &c M Bulletin was started a few years ago
and it is presently run by editor-in-chief Ronald Schmid.
This is a weekly newsletter which attempts to present
topics of interest to all engineering students while main-
taining as high a level of personal interest as possible.
  Probably the major individual promotion of E & M
Cabinet is Engineers' Week. This is a presentation of
the achievements and accomplishments of the engineering
students to their parents, other students of the Univer-
sity, the general public and, in particular, to the high
school students of the area in the hope that it will aid
them in the choice of their profession. Engineers' Week
is truly an opportunity for each student to work with his
colleagues and since the Shamrock Award is made to the
department amassing the best overall score for the week's
activities, it is practically a necessity for each student to
help if the pride of his department is to be maintained.
The tremendous job of planning the festivities for this
week falls on the capable shoulders of Edward Kondis
and Richard Fusco. Of course in order to make an opera-
tion of this type a success, an outstanding job of publicity
is. necessary. This chore is being handled in yeoman
fashion by Ronakl Crawford.
  The diversified jobs within the E & M Association make
it possible for an engineer to receive more than a technical
education. The opportunities to initiate, develop, and
present your own ideas, to communicate, explain, sell and
work with fellow students are readily available to all
those who are willing to sacrifice some time and energy
to obtain a "complete educationg

United States Steel owns one of the world's few ion-
emission microscopes, capable of magnifying two mil-
lion times. It was built by U. S. Steel's Fundamental
Research Laboratory in line with established scientific
principles-not to study pinheads, but to enable the
scientists in Fundamental Research to study the atomic
structures and surfaces of metals. With this amazingly
powerful instrument, they can actually see and identify
individual atoms!
Whatever their specialized training, those who work at
U. S. Steel are likely to be surprised, at the start, by


such ultramodern, space age equipment. But they
soon come to realize that this is just the visible evi-
dence of U. S. Steel's continuing program to develop
new and better steels. That's what makes the work of
U. S. Steel engineers so stimulating.

* One in a series of messages
on how to plan your career





                      Are you "taking a job"



  or "beginning                           a career"?



There's a mighty big difference

                                between the two


As we see it, "taking a job" can be
much like taking a single, tentative
step in the dark. It may serve your
purposes temporarily, but where do
you go from there?
  Young men who snap up tempting
job offers often regret their decisions
as time goes by. The plain fact is that
glittering inducements sometimes cover
up the lack of a future. But the man
who thinks in terms of a career is not
easily fooled; he sees his first job as a
beginning, not as an end in itself.
Careers with Bethlehem Steel--A
doorway to careers with Bethlehem
Steel is the Loop Course-its members
make an observational circuit (or
"loop") of a steel plant during their
initial training program. Through the
Loop Course, Bethlehem seeks only
men who are interested in career
opportunities. We do not accept men
who are "just looking for a job";
and, by the same token, we do not
assign loopers to "dead-end" jobs.
Promotion from   Within-It is im-
portant to bear in mind the fact that,
aside from the need for an occasional
specialist, we fill management posi-
tions from within the organization.


The Loop Course, through its 40 years
of operation, has provided about 2,000
selected and trained men, capable of
advancing to positions of increased
responsibility.
Loopers are Thoroughly Trained-
New loopers report to our general
headquarters, in Bethlehem, Pa., usu-
ally early in July. They attend a basic
course of five weeks, including lec-
tures, classroom discussions, educa-
tional films, and daily plant visits.
The Loop Course is not a probationary
period. After completion of the course,
every looper receives his first assign-
ment. Then, after reporting to a plant,
yard, or home office division, he re-
ceives further orientation before be-
ginning on-the-job training. Bethlehem
loopers embark on their careers with
thorough training behind them.
Big and Diversified-Because of its
size and diversity of its operations,
Bethlehem Steel offers unlimited op-
portunities to "get ahead." One of the
nation's largest industrial corporations,
with over 140,000 employees, we are
engaged in raw materials mining and
processing; basic steelmaking and the
production of a wide range of steel


products; manufacturing; structural-
steel fabricating and erecting; and
shipbuilding and ship repair. We op-
erate steelmaking plants on the Eastern
Seaboard and the Pacific Coast; ship-
yards on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf
Coasts; manufacturing units and fabri-
cating works in twelve states; and sales
offices in most leading cities. A new
centralized research facility, the Beth-
lehem Steel Company-Homer Research
Laboratories, costing in excess of $25
million, located in Bethlehem, Pa.,
rivals the finest in any industry.

Learning never stops for engineers at Western Electric


There's no place at Western Electric for engineers who feel
that college diplomas signify the end of their education.
However, if a man can meet our quality standards and feels
that he is really just beginning to learn... and if he is
ready to launch his career where learning is an important
part of the job and where graduate-level training on and off
the job is encouraged - we want and need him.
   At Western Electric, in addition to the normal learning-
while-doing, engineers are encouraged to move ahead in
their fields by several types of educational programs.
Western maintains its own full-time graduate engineering
training program, seven formal management courses, and a
tuition refund plan for out-of-hours college study.
   This learning atmosphere is just one reason why a career
at Western Electric is so stimulating. Of equal importance,
however, is the nature of the work we do. Our new engi-
neers are taking part in projects that implement the whole
art of modern telephony from high-speed sound transmission
and solar cells, to electronic telephone offices and computer-
controlled production techniques.
   Should you join us now, you will be coming to Western
Electric at one of the best times in the company's history.


In the management area alone, several thousand supervisory
jobs are expected to open up to W.E. people within the next
10 years. And our work of building communications equip-
ment and systems becomes increasingly challenging and
important as the communications needs of our nation and
the world continue to increase.

  Challenging opportunities exist now at Western Electric for electrical,
mechanical, industrial, and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. All qualified applicants will
receive careful consideration for employment without regard to race,
creed, color or national origin. For more information about Western
Electric, write College Relations, Western Electric Company, Room 6205,

A GLIMPSE AT



                         SPECIAL RELATIVITY



                                                          By RICHARD COVER, JR.


  Until the late nineteenth century, Newtonian mechanics,
or classical physics, prevailed over scientific thought and
theoretical research, for in Newton's time, mechanics was
the most successful tool for solving problems in the field
of physics. To explain the physical phenomena of nature
merely meant to present a mechanical interpretation, and
no one dreamed that this mechanistic mode of thinking
could be revolutionized.
  The latest development in physics at this stage of philo-
sophical conformity was the theory of the lumeniferous
ether, which was thought to be the transmitter of electro-
magnetic waves. Ether permeated all space and matter and
carried light waves in much the same manner air trans-
mits sound waves. Most important of all, it provided the
stationary standard of reference of absolute motion which
Newton's cosmology required.
  If a light beam, for example, was flashed from the back
of a rocket in outer space, its velocity would be equal to
the speed of light (in a vacuum) minus the speed of the
rocket. If the beam was flashed in the direction of travel
of the speeding rocket, its velocity would be equal to the
speed of light plus the speed of the rocket.
  This illustration is adequately expressed in a classical


  RICHARD COVER, JR:, a Ch.E. sophomore, is a stu-
dent at the Johnstown College. Dick's article is the first to
be submitted to the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER from the
Johnstown extension of the University. Dick, who has
been studying physics for several years, will move to the
University of Pittsburgh's campus next Fall.


theorem of addition of velocities:
                       V=v--w
 where v equals the velocity of light and w equals the speed
 of the rocket if the light ray is projected against the direc-
 tion of travel of the rocket; and
                       V=v+w
 if the ray of light is projected in the same direction as the
 rocket's travel.
   Ether, however, was still theoretical in its development
 and two American physicists, A. A. Michelson and E. W.
 Morley performed a historical experiment in 1881 to
 prove or disprove the existence of the ether. They set
 up a relatively simple apparatus called an interferometer
 (since it dealt with wave interference), which consisted
 of a system of mirrors arranged in such a fashion that a
 light beam could be split and flashed in different direc-
 tions simultaneously. According to the addition of ve-
 locities theorem, the speed of light of one ray should
 be faster than it actually is, and slower in the other
 (due to the earth's revolution). Such painstaking efforts
 were taken in executing the experiment that the results
 were not to be doubted. However, the utterly remarkable
 result was that Michelson and Morley were unable to ob-
 serve any alteration in the velocity of the light beams,
 regardless of their direction.
   If the speed of light did not change in the experiment,
 the apparent velocity of the earth through the ether must
 be zero! Scientists were faced with a serious dilemma:
 either the concept of ether, which had solved so many
 problems about electricity, magnetism and the electro-
 magnetic spectra had to be ignored, or the Copernican
 Theory that the earth is in motion had to be abandoned.
   Debate on the subject was split for a quarter century
 until a young Ph.D. in a Swiss patent office came forth
 with such a simple answer that it took the wits of a genius
 to see it. Dr. Einstein published his first article, "On the
 Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" in 1905 and thus was
 born the Theory of Relativity.
 Einstein solved the ether enigma and the results of the
 Michelson-Morley experiment with two fundamental pos-
 tulates. The first answered the ether dilemma by stating,
 in effect, that all motion is relative. That is, there is no
 fixed standard of reference in the universe by which man
 can detect the absolute motion of a moving system. Mo-
 tion can only be defined as a change of position of one
body with respect to the position of another. "Every


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER




motion in space (description of events) involves the use of
a rigid body to which such motion must be referred. There
is no such thing as an independently existing trajectory,
but only a trajectory relative to a system of co-ordinates
rigidly attached to some particular body of reference."
  Imagine that you are standing at the window of a uni-
formly travelling railway car, and drop a stone onto the
embankment.2 You then see the stone drop in a straight
line from your hand to the ground. An observer on the
embankment notices that the stone falls to the earth in a
parabolic curve, due to the inertial force imparted on it
by the moving train. Does the path followed by the stone,
in reality, lie in a straight line, or a parabolic curve. Re-
membering that all motion is relative, the stone travels a
straight line relative to a system of co-ordination rigidly
attached to the train, but relative to the embankment, it
describes a parabolic curve. It is incorrect, therefore, to
speak of absolute motion as such; motion can only be ob-
served if it is referred to some arbitrary system of refer-
ence.
  If the ether existed, it would be in a state of absolute
riotion, since it would be the only thing in the universe
which remained stationary. But it has now been proven
that only relative motion can be detected, therefore de-
tection of the ether is impossible. Newton pointed out
centuries ago that it is impossible to ascertain the move-
ment of a ship in calm waters by any experiment per-
formed inside the ship. Similarly, the motion of the earth
through the ether cannot be detected by any experiment
here on earth.
  The second fundamental postulate stated that the speed
of light is constant, relative to any observer. Considering
both basic ideas of Einstein, we may say in conclusion, that
all phenomena of nature are equivalent for systems mov-
ing relative to one another.
  Dr. Einstein discarded the ideal of absolute space when
he said that all motion is relative, and now the idea of
absolute time, distance and mass must also be thrown
away.
  The layman makes time an objective, almost tangible
quantity by referring his experience to clocks and calen-

                                                        U


dars. But all measurements of time are geared to our own
solar system. What would be the effect of time processes
away from the earth and sun, in the vast reaches of the
universe? The time dilation effect states that if two ob-
servers are travelling uniformly at a constant velocity
relative to one another, the time processes of one appear
to be slowed down to the other. Einstein expressed the
slowing down of time in the equation:


             t' =   t

                                    V2
                                    C2

where t' is the time an observer reads from a clock travel-
ling at a constant velocity relative to himself, and t is
the time he reads from his own clock. His velocity is v
and c is the speed of light.
  Time does not pass at the same rate for every object
in the universe. An absolute flow of time beginning with
the infinite past and ending with the infinite future simply
does not exist.
  Along with time, distance also varies with the velocity
of an object. When one observer is in motion relative to
another, whether approaching or separating, it appears
to each that the other has shrunk in length in the direc-
tion of motion, the length being given in the equation:

                                 v2

                                 V2
             L' - L




  The results of the relativity of time and distance are
practically negligible and highly impractical for ordinary
terrestrial experiences. A jet travelling at the speed of
sound is contracted in length about a millionth of a mil-
lionth of an inch relative to an observer. However, they
do bear significance on celestial bodies, rocket travel and

theories lie in the relativity of mass. Mass, it must be re-

membered, is not merely heaviness, or weight, but resist-
ance to a change of motion, whether it is acceleration or
deceleration. In the old Newtonian physics, mass was an
unchanging property of a body. Relativity advances that
mass is not unvarying, but increases with velocity relative
to an observer. Classical mechanics failed to discover this
because these increases become perceptible only when
bodies attain velocities close to that of light. The mass
increase relationship is expressed in the equation:

                                v2
           m   =moV2

                         1


where m is the resultant mass of a body relative to an
observer, mo, the rest mass (velocity of zero), and v, the
relative velocity.
  If the history of physics had gone in a different way,
or if man had evolved without sight, c might have been
discovered as the square root of the ratio of energy to
mass equivalent.2
  Mass also is not an absolute quantity. When a body
moves with respect to an observer, the mass of that body

than the electrical charges of atomic particles. Where does
the tremendous amount of energy released in these re-
actions come from? Refering to the mass-energy equiv-
alence formula, Dr. Einstein said that the binding energy
released in an atomic reaction is supplied by part of the
mass of the nucelus.
  This seemingly simple relationship has answered many
of the age-old mysteries of physics and chemistry. It ex-
plains how transuranium elements are able to emit par-
ticles at fantastic velocities, and how the sun can continue
to radiate heat and light for millions of years.
  "Two distinct elements, matter and energy-the former
inert, tangible, and characterized by a property called
mass, and the latter active, invisible, and without mass.
But Einstein showed that mass and energy are equivalent,
interchangeable. The property called matter is simply
concentrated energy. Matter is energy and energy is mat-
ter, and the distinction is merely one of a temporary
state. .."3

increases, the amount of increase varying directly with the
relative velocity of object and observer.
   What happens to the mass of a body as it reaches accel-
 erations pushing it close to the speed of light? The alge-
 braic results show that if v=c, the mass would be infinite.
 Since a body of infinite mass is impossible, the conclusion
 is reached that there is a certain speed beyond which
 nothing can go.
 The most significant effect to evolve from Relativity is
 the equivalence of mass and energy. Since the mass of a
 moving body increases as its velocity increases, and mo-
 tion is a form of kinetic energy, the increases must come
 from an increase in energy. If the mass of a body is con-
 verted totally into energy, this equivalent energy would
 equal the mass of the body times the square of the speed
 of light, or E=mc2.
 This energy is released only in nuclear reactions, when
 a nucleus of an atom is broken up or combined with the
 nucleus of another atom. The binding energy that holds
these nuclei together must be stronger, in comparison,

HE PUTS RESEARCH TO WORK

ON THE PRODUCTION LINE

Examining new phenomena in cryogenics, optics, informa-
tion theory, data communications and photochemistry, IBM
research engineers and scientists are developing new con-
cepts for information processing.
Some of these developments have a far-reaching, funda-
mental influence on basic knowledge, while others may
have a more immediate application to actual problems.
Where technological advances have a specific bearing on
data processing needs, they must be considered for appli-
cation in manufacturing. At IBM, that's a job for Manufac-
turing Research.
As a project engineer, Peter R. Schulz has found Manufac-
turing Research a challenging and rewarding assignment.
Translating today's scientific discoveries to meet tomor-
row's production line needs is an important step in creat-
ing exciting new products. It requires imagination and
ability to put new techniques, equipment and processes to
work on the production line.
At IBM, Manufacturing Research is an area of activity that
provides as much room for professional growth and ad-
vancement as the engineer is ready for. In his three years
with the company, for example, Peter Schulz has already
received three promotions to reach his present position of
responsibility. But no matter what your field of interest may
be, IBM facilities and professional guidance provide plenty
of backing for building a rewarding career.
The IBM representative will be interviewing on your campus
this year. He will be glad to discuss with you the many
challenging jobs that are open at IBM-in development engi-
neering, research, manufacturing research, programming
or systems engineering. Your placement officer can supply
information and make an appointment for you. All qualified
candidates will receive consideration for employment with-
out regard to race, creed, color or national origin. If you

  ENGINEERS'




                             WEEK






                             By JOSEPH SCUILLI

   Every year around St. Patrick's day, the University
 populace expects to see an army of green-derbied young
 men invade the lower campus from the "hill." While the
 rest of the University community is engaged in their
 normal activities, engineers are busy planning and pre-
 paring for "their week." Preparations are made to handle
 the busloads of high school students and alumni, which
 "Engineers' Week" always attracts. But why the green
 derbies? Why all the preparations? Why the busloads of
 visitors? In short, what is the purpose of this so-called
 "Engineers' Week?"
 Although some phases of Engineers' Week have been
 somewhat amended since their inception in 1956, it is
 still fundamentally based on its original purposes. The
 first and probably the most important purpose of Engi-
 neers' Week is to display the technical talents of Pitt En-
 gineering students. To accomplish this purpose, each de-
 partment designs and builds an original display depicting
 engineering principles as applied to a particular project.
 All the projects have several things in common. First,
 all displays are designed and built with the "theme" of
 Engineers' Week uppermost in mind. For example, the
 theme in 1961 was, "The Engineer's role in the growth of
 Pittsburgh." Many departments chose familiar Pittsburgh
 projects as their displays. This year the theme for the
 week is, "The Engineer's role in National Defense." Ob-
 viously, there are a multitude of interesting and informa-
 tive projects which can be built. Secondly, all projects
 must be designed so that technically untrained people may
 appreciate them. In this way they serve to educate not
 only the engineers who have developed them, but also the
 visitors who will inspect them. Finally, all departmental
 displays are open to the public, with special encourage-
 ment given to high school students, professional groups,
 and alumni.
 In addition to technical pursuits, Engineers' Week also
 possesses a very important social purpose. The social phase
of the week serves to build the spirit of the engineering
students to a high degree. There are a number of planned
events which are geared to this purpose. Early in the week
an informal "mixer dance" is held, which in the past has
not received a great deal of support. But as a preview to
this year's activities, count on attending the mixer dance-

some new "twists" has been added. A few other events,
such as the arrival of St. Patrick and the "gimmick" stir a
good deal of both student and public interest. However,
the major social activity of the week is certainly the "Sham-
rock Ball," highlighted by the crowning of St. Patricia and
the presentation of awards to the winning departments.
Every engineering student can and should participate in
this event.
  Certainly another important purpose of Engineers'
Week is to encourage the development of professional at-
titudes in future practicing engineers. Most of the week's
activities serve to support this purpose. However, the event
which best accomplishes this purpose is the interdepart-
mental debate. This is another area which in the past has
not generated enough interest. This year we hope that

licity manager for this year's Engineers' Week. As a mem-
ber of the Central Planning Committee, and a participant
in last year's Engineers' Week, Joe has a good understand-
ing of the purpose behind this week. Joe is also a mem-
ber of Eta Kappa Nu, and president of Sigma Tau.


engineering students realize that their support of the de-
bates should be a must.
   All departments do their best in all activities in order
 to make the week a huge success. How then is it deter-
 mined which departments should be recognized for out-
 standing work in Engineers' Week? To accomplish this,
 each event is scored on a basis of merit and/or participa-
 tion and the outstanding departments are chosen in a
 master tally. In previous years the final outcome was de-
 termined on a nearly straight percentage basis. This year,
 however, a new and unquestionably more fair system of
 scoring has been developed. Based on probability and
 statistics, this system of scoring will make it possible for
 any department, regardless of its size, to have an equal op-
 portunity to win any event. This scoring system can be
 briefly described as follows: Each event will be judged in
 such a manner so that a mean may be obtained. Statistical
 theory predicts that each department will be positioned a
 certain number of standard deviations on one side or the
 other of the mean department. The next step in the scor-
 ing is to translate the standard deviations units into points.
 This is accomplished by fixing the number of possible
 points for one event. Since all other events are scored with
 respect to this particular event, their maximum number
 of points are automatically fixed. Each department is then
 judged in each event and the winners determined. This
 system will certainly eliminate all of the inconsistencies
 which have existed in the previous scoring methods.
 These are the main ingredients of Engineers' Week.
 Interest and participation will properly mix the ingredi-
 ents. Encouragement is extended to Engineering students
 in all class levels to participate in all phases of the week.
 Why an "Engineers Week"? Certainly to fulfill tech-
 nical, professional and social purposes, but more im-
 portant to demonstrate to the University and to the public
 that today's engineer is influencing and will continue to
 influence more and more the attitudes and modes of living
of all mankind-serving to make the woHld a finer place
in which to live*

SYNTHETIC SPEECH
A method of producing synthetic speech has
been disclosed by The Bell Telephone Labora-
tories. A computer is programmed with the
names of the phonetic speech sounds which
make up an English sentence, and the rules
for using these names. The computer output,
on digital magnetic tape, is converted to

The first 100% stainless steel auto muffler
is now being made by Hayes Industries, Inc.
The muffler is only about half the size of
present mufflers, and weighs slightly more
than seven pounds. It operates on a new
technique utilizing a stainless steel spring
which is controlled by the exhaust pressure.
The new muffler adjusts itself at "idle," at
turnpike driving, or anywhere between, to
give maximum gasoline economy and mini-
mum exhaust noise.

A new 1,800-kv condenser bushing was an-
nounced by Westinghouse which weighs
6850 pounds and is 231/2 feet high. It is
to be used with high-voltage transformers
with ratings up to 750,000 volts. The high-

Even the greeks didn't have a word for it

                                 According to legend, a goat tender in ancient Greece noticed
                                 that his animals acted strangely whenever they grazed near a
                                 certain spot in the field. When villagers investigated, they be-
                                 came giddy and lightheaded from an invisible "something"
                                 that came up out of the ground.
                                   Since in those days the Greeks considered the weak-minded
                                 as special favorites of the gods, they erected a temple at the
                                 spot in honor of the invisible magic that made people giddy.
                                 This was the famous Temple of Delphi, and the "something"
                                 for which the Greeks had no word was natural gas.
                                   In the years since then, natural gas has been transformed
                                 from a curiosity to one of the world's major sources of
                                 energy. Chemists (and alchemists) discovered a little about
                                 the nature of gas, and that it would burn. But it was engi-
                                 neers who perfected ways of controlling it, measuring it,
                                 transporting it, and of putting its energy to work. Our engi-
                                 neers have been a part of this progress. Their skill has helped
                                 make Rockwell-Nordstrom valves, Rockwell gas meters,
                                 regulators, and other measurement and control devices the
                                 most widely used in the gas industry.
                                   Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product

his. "That's something I've never
done," she said.
  "Never made love?" cried Dave, ap-
palled at the waste of magnificent raw
material.
  "No, silly," she answered in soft re-
buke. "Never objectedl"

  Rush Chairman: "Our fraternity
maintains four homes for the feeble
minded."
  Rushee: "I thought you had more
chapters than that."

  Prosecuting Attorney: "You mean
to tell me you had fifteen beers and
didn't move from the table once the
night of the murder."

  Spring is the time of the year when
the students find out that tuition is
going to be raised in the fall.

  Co-ed: "Where did you learn to kiss
like that?"
  E.E.: "Siphoning gas."
              * * *
  One buddy to the other: "Did you
follow my advice about kissing your
chick when she least expected it?"
  "Huh?" said the fellow with the
swollen eye, "I thought you said
WHERE."


   A fellow and a girl charged around
 a corner and bumped smack into each
 other. They stepped back, apologized
 and started up again, but they both
 dodged in the same direction and
 bumped once more. Again they started
 up, bumped, and apologized: this
 time the fellow stopped, raised his hat
 and gallantly remarked, "Just once
 more honey, then I really have to go."

   He: "Why wait until we get home
before you tell me if you will marry
me or not?"
  She: "I'm scared. This is the very
spot where my father proposed to my
mother."
  He: "So what?"
  She: "Well, on the way home the
horses ran away and my father was
killed."
              * * *
  "It isn't the amount of money that
a fellow's father has that counts here

  "No, it's the amount of father's
money the son has."

  What makes people walk in their
sleep?
  Twin beds.

  Overheard at cafeteria:
  First Cook: "Hey, the garbage man
is outside."
  Dietician: "O.K., tell him to leave
three cans today."

  It's no fun to kiss a girl over the
phone unless you happen to be in the
same booth with her.


  The Georgia farmer passed away
and the preacher came to his wife to
get some information about the poor
man to use in his eulogy at the fu-
neral. "Is he a Mason, an Elk, or a
Woodsman? Did he belong to the
Chamber of Commerce or the Ku
Klux Klan?"
  The bereaved wife asked, "What's
the Ku Klux Klan?"
  The preacher explained, "Well, I
guess you might say that's the devil
under the sheet."
  With a timid smile, she said, "That
he was!"

Kodak beyond the snapshot...

                            (random notes)


Grateful but cautious
More spectrographic plates and film
are used each year than the year before.
This goes on despite new fashions in
elemental analysis by physical methods
and by new Eastman Organic Chem-
icals. The civilized world is analysis-
happy and that makes us happy.
  To betoken the happiness a small
pamphlet has been issued under the
title "Spectrum Analysis with Kodak
Materials." Its words may prove less
useful than its graphs and numbers,
though the words devoted to a warning
against taking the graphs and numbers
too seriously must be taken seriously.
That's life.
   Life lived with the photographic
emulsion as a measuring instrument
for radiation intensity must be filled
with gratitude for its simplicity, versa-
tility, and economy and filled with
caution against glib assumptions. Those
who live that life have learned that:

1. Kodak Spectroscopic Plates and Film,
Type 103-0 work fast, capture quick-
vanishing spectra.
2. Kodak Spectrum Analysis No. 1 Plates
and Film are contrasty and good for
trace-element lines against heavy back-
ground, for semi-quantitative compari-
son, and for all-out quantitative jobs.
3. For cutting corners on how many
wave lengths you calibrate at, resort
to the new Kodak "SA-3" Plates or Films.
(If you still want the pamphlet, write
to our Special Sensitized Products
Division.)


Never say "die"?


These metal parts are not stampings.
They are too fussy and tricky for knife
or milling machine and needed too fast
and in insufficient numbers to justify
the fabrication of dies. They are prod-
ucts of photo-etching, which is catching on.

   Some outfits photo-etch for them-
selves, and some do it for hire. The
method uses either Kodak Photo Resist
or Kodak Metal-Etch Resist, depending
on the metal. Both are light-sensitive
liquids. The object is drawn to enlarged
scale and photographed. The metal is
coated with KPR or KMER and exposed
to light through the negative. Where
the negative protects from the light,
the resist will subsequently flush away;
where light-struck, it becomes resistant
to etchant. Etchants leave no burrs.
The thinner the metal the closer the
tolerances an etchant can work to.

   Photo-etching speeds execution of
design ideas. With fewer punch-press
tenders needed nowadays anyway, more
of the population has to earn a living
in the idea business.


Chemical tuning
We make optical interference filters on
a custom basis. In seeking customers
one must be creative. Why not adver-
tise them to chemists?
  To a chemist, a color filter is what
he slips into a colorimeter. If he is an
enthusiastic photographer, he may know
of dyed-gelatin Kodak Wratten Light
Filters. We take it from there:
  "Suppose, for fantasy's sake, that you
wanted to flood a reaction preferentially
with energy of exactly that frequency
to which a certain carbon-nitrogen bond
responds. An interference filter could
probably be made for the job.
   "An interference filter is tunable in
manufacture for wavelengths from 0.411
to 12[L. Unlike gelatin or glass filters,
its curve doesn't depend on what color-
ants happen to be available. It can
provide a single spectral spike of trans-
mittance but is not limited to that.
It can also be designed to cut out
energy below a stated frequency or
above a stated frequency. It can cut very
sharp. It is thermally, chemically, and
mechanically rugged. It costs a great
deal less than a laser (which, while it
can emit Niagaras of monochromatic
energy, must work with the quantum
states that Nature has in stock). It can
be large. It can be designed to monitor
a process stream continuously for the
presence or absence of any substance
possessing a suitable energy-absorbance
curve."
   Maybe something clicks somewhere.


INCREASING EXPLOITATION OF PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTIONS DEMANDS GOOD CHEMICAL ENGINEERS, AMONG OTHERS


From portrait lenses to polishing waxes,
plenty of lively careers are to be made with
Kodak in research, engineering, production,
marketing.

And whether you work for us or not,
photography in some form will probably
have a part in your work as years go on.
Always feel free to ask for Kodak literature
or help on anything photographic.

Interview with General Electric's

Francis J. Boucher

Manager-Manufacturing Personnel Development Service


How Good


Is Your Best Job Offer...


Q. Mr. Boucher, with all the job inter-
views a graduating engineer goes
through, how can he be reasonably
sure he has made the right choice?
A. This is a good question because
few seniors have enough work ex-
perience in industry, government
and   educational institutions to
allow them to make a fully rea-
soned choice. However, I think the
first step is to be sure that short-
term factors like starting salary
and location don't outweigh long-
range factors like opportunity and
professional growth. All of these
factors should be evaluated before
making a final commitment.
Q. But you do feel that starting salary
is important?
A. Very much so. If you are mar-
ried-it may be an even greater
consideration. But you should also
look beyond starting salary. Find
out, for example, if the company
you are considering has a good
salary administration plan. If there
is no way of formally appraising
your performance and determining
your appropriate rewards, you run
the risk of becoming dissatisfied
or stalemated due to neglect of
these important considerations.
Q. What considerations do you feel
should be evaluated in reaching a job
decision?
A. Let me refer you to a paper
written by Dr. L. E. Saline, now
Manager of Information Systems
in our Defense Systems Depart-
ment. It is titled "How to Evaluate
Job Offers." (Incidentally, you may
obtain a copy by writing as di-
rected in the last paragraph.) In
it, Dr. Saline proposes six ques-
tions-the answers to which should
give you much of the information
you'll need for an objective job-
offer evaluation. He suggests you
determine . . .
* to what degree will the work be
challenging and satisfying?
* what opportunities are available
to further develop abilities?
* what opportunities are there for
advancing in the Company (and
how dynamic the Company is in
the marketplace is an important
aspect of this question).


* what salary potentials are pos-
sible with respect to the future?
* what about geographical location
-now and in the future?
* what effort does the Company
make to establish and maintain a
professional climate?
There is more to these questions
than meets the eye and I think
you   would   enjoy  reading  Dr.
Saline's paper.
0. What about the openings on de-
fense projects that are listed in the
various magazines and newspapers?
A. Presumably, there will always
be a need for technical manpower
in the defense business. But I
want to point out to you that most
of these opportunities are for ex-
perienced personnel, or personnel
with specific additional training re-
ceived at the graduate level.
Q. How do you feel about training
programs? Do they offer any particular
advantages over any other offer I
might accept?
A. I feel training programs are par-
ticularly helpful in easing the tran-
sition from   an  academic to   a
business environment. Of course
they provide formal training de-
signed to add to the individual's
basic fund of knowledge. They
also provide working experience in
a variety of fields and a broad
knowledge of the company con-
cerned and its scope of operations.
Upon completion, the individual is
generally better prepared to decide
the direction in which he will pur-
sue his professional career.
General Electric conducts a num-
ber of training programs. Those
that attract the greatest number
of engineers are the Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and
Technical Marketing     Programs.
Each combines a formal, graduate-
level study curriculum, on-the-job
experience, and rotating assign-
ments. There is little question in
my mind that when an engineer
completes the Program     of his
choice, he is far better prepared to


choose his field by interest and by
capability. I might also add that
because of this, he is more valuable
to the Company as an employee.
Q. Then you feel that a training pro-
gram is the best alternative for a
graduating engineer?
A. Not always. Some seniors have
already determined the specific
field they are best suited for in
terms of their own interests and
capabilities. In such cases, direct
placement into this specific field
may be more advantageous. Pro-
fessional self-development for these
employees, as for all General Elec-
tric technical employees, is en-
couraged through a variety of
programs including the Company's
Tuition Refund Program for work
toward advanced degrees, in-plant
courses conducted at the graduate
level, and others designed to meet
individual needs.
Q. For the record, how would you
rate a job offer from General Electric?
A. I've tried to get across the need
for factual information and a long-
range outlook as the keys to any
good job evaluation. With respect
to the General Electric Company,
seniors and placement offices have
access to a wide variety of infor-
mation about the Company, its
professional environment and its
personnel practices. I think quali-
fied seniors will also discover that
General Electric offers professional
opportunity second to none-and
starting salaries that are competi-
tive  with  the  average   offered
throughout industry today. From
the above, you can see that I
would rate a job offer from General
Electric very highly.
Want more information about
General Electric's training pro-
grams? You can get it, together
with a copy of Dr. Saline's paper
"How   to Evaluate Job Offers"

reer Planning," General Electric

nectady 5, New York.

Harnessing Nuclear Ramjet Power . . . at up to 12000 F.
Nuclear ramjet engines, with a potential of many, many times the
specific impulse of existing chemical propulsion systems, are
opening exciting new approaches to aero-space propulsion. But
controlling these engines presents almost insurmountable prob-
lems. The control actuation system must be able to resist extremely
severe simultaneous environmental conditions: gases heated to
10600 F., intense nuclear radiation, shock, and vibration. What's
more, the system must operate with precision and efficiency-
not for seconds, but for hours!
    To solve this high-temperature problem, Bendix engineers
have devised an electropneumatic system, based on gas as the
control medium. This system is considered a major contribution
toward the development of powerful aero-space vehicles. It has

                              An equal opportunity employer


been demonstrated effective at operating temperatures of 12000 F.
    Other important contributions of the system include specially
treated ferro-magnetic materials and unique lubricants for rolling
contact bearings. This results in bearing performance comparable
to that obtained with standard bearings under normal environ-
mental conditions.
    If you're interested in engineering challenge, see your
Placement Director and sign up for an interview with a Bendix
representative. Or, write Dr. A. M. Canfield, The Bendix Corpo-

Cats are notoriously silent in their singularly feline way. But even the
most stealthily treading tomcat could take lessons from the men at
Ford Motor Company whose job it is to track down and suppress
unwanted noise in vehicles.
At our Ford Research and Engineering Center in Dearborn, engineers
have created a unique room without echoes, virtually duplicating the
perfect stillness that exists miles above the earth's surface.
The "Silent Room", as we call it, is a chamber utilizing fiber-glass
wedges as sonic "blotters" to soak up noise emanating from subjects
undergoing developmental tests. In this acoustically sterile environ-

A Message







From the Dean


By Dr. G. R. Fitterer






    Time Out for MENTAL DIGESTION!


 This is the title of one of the most thought provoking
 little books* ever written. The author, Robert Rawls, de-
 scribes how a young army surgeon, Dr. William Beaumont,
 in 1822, patched up an Indian who had most of his ab-
 domen shot away in a hunting accident. The surgery was
 performed in such a manner that one could watch the
 process of food disgestion through a "window." Dr. Beau-
 mont experimented for several years with various types of
 foods, watched their assimilation and described his obser-
 vations in one of the most famous books in medical his-
 tory. He found that all foods needed some time for proper
 digestion. Some, of course, required more time than others
 for mastication, action with the stomach fluids followed
 by absorption into the bloodstream.
 Rawls goes on to illustrate that not all ideas can be
 digested mentally in a split second, as in speed reading,
 but many thoughts must be masticated for a long time
 through auxiliary reading, listening, discussing and argu-
 ing. They must then be "churned by the digestive juices
 of knowledge, experience, doubt, hope," etc. Meanwhile,
 the mind might reject the ideas, absorb a nourishing por-
 tion of it or assimilate it completely.
 These processes usually require considerable time. It is
 not often that the most profound thoughts are assimilated
 immediately upon contact. Also, as in the digestion of
 foods, not all people absorb the same ideas at the same
 * Updegraff Press, Scarsdale, N.Y.


rate. In fact an idea which gives nourishment to one per-
son might cause an allergic reaction in another because
of difference between individuals in the amounts and
types of background, knowledge, experience, etc., which
are needed for digestion.
  Every person who has engaged in research has some
time in his career encountered seemingly insurmountable
problems which are temporarily abandoned as hopeless.
Yet, after considerable digestion by the mind (more often
subconsciously), a relative simple answer to the problem
will suddenly be revealed to him. This often comes as a
surprise because at the moment of revelation, he is not
concerned about the original problem.
  Many of the engineering sciences are like this. Based as
they are on mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc., as well
as other engineering sciences, solutions to engineering
problems take time for mental digestion before all the
contributing factors can be pieced together as an inte-
grated whole. This has become the phase of engineering
education referred to as Engineering Design.
  All of this, of course, has a bearing on accelerated edu-
cational programs like the Trimester at Pitt. Some students
can absorb the material in an engineering curriculum at
a rapid pace and should be encouraged to take full ad-
vantage of such accelerated programs. Others, however,
need "time out for mental digestion" and should not accel-
erate their program faster than their own rate of as-
similation.
   One should not jump to the conclusion that the greatest
 benefit is always gained by those capable of the fastest
 rate of mental digestion. Some of the slowest eaters get
 the most enjoyment and benefit from their food.
   Recent surveys of the educational backgrounds of per-
 sons with a high degree of creativity indicates that a ma-
 jority of them were persons who require "time out for
 mental digestion"
