limited as to frustrate‘ efforts of re-
searchers to advance knowledge at a
rapid rate.

The history of the investigation of
currents provides an example: In the
late eighteenth century, Benjamin
Franklin became the first American to
chart and attempt to explain the
Gulf Stream. While a great deal of
work has been done to learn more
about this current, very little has been
accomplished in locating and chart-
ing new current systems.

It was 1951 before a major subsur-
face current was discovered and
named for Townsend Cromwell, one
of its discovers. This current flows
eastward along the equator at an in-
termediate depth of 300 feet. Its
speed is 4 knots. It lies below a sur-
face current which flows in the op-
posite direction. The Cromwell Cur-
rent has been traced for some 3000
miles across the Paciﬁc. Its volume
of flow is equivalent to more than
1000 Mississippi Rivers.

In addition to these chartable cur-
rents, transient currents form as a
result of discontinuities and gradients
in water density and temperature.
These currents genera-te what are
known as internal waves. These
waves are quite variable, and the
ability to predict their behavior will
depend upon the advances in knowl-
edge of the variation in the para-
meters that cause them.

New currents are also being dis-
covered. Until the Trieste made its
36,000-foot dive to the bottom of the
Challenger Deep, water in the deep
trenches was believed to be motion-
less. However, the crew of the Trieste
observed marine life in the Challenger
Deep. This demonstrated the exis-
tence of bottom currents, for without
them oxygen transport, a necessity for
the support of life, could not take
place.

Currents in the upper atmosphere
exist just as do currents in the depths
of the sea. These atmospheric cur-
rents in time will come to be linked
integrally with phenomena observed
at sea, because the atmosphere and
sea in combination form a gigantic
thermodynamic machine.

From discoveries like these, scien-
tists have reason to ask what other
systems — physical and biological —
have yet to be discovered that will be
of tremendous signiﬁcance in exploit-
ing the sea for military and economic
gain.

Designing Tools for Oceanographic
Research

Before beginning a design project,
the problem to be solved must be de-
ﬁned. But this problem is inherently
difﬁcult where the sea is concerned,
because in many cases no one knows
precisely what to look for. The scien-
tist, who must deﬁne the problem, is
often groping for some basic knowl-
edge from which he may propose a
meaningful thesis.

Take, for example, the problem of
mapping four-dimensional space. As—.
sume that distribution of tempera-
ture, density, and sound velocity is
to be determined for a Volume of wa-
ter 100 miles by 100 miles by one mile
deep. Instruments are available that
can measure each of their parameters.
But to what accuracy must variations
be known to characterize accurately
the conditions found in the given
volume? Must temperature be mea-
sured to one degree, a tenth degree,
or one-hundredth degree accuracy to
explain the operation of the thermo-
dynamic system within this volume
of water?

If a sweep is made with an instru-
ment chain, must the sensors be one
foot apart, ten feet apart, one hundred
feet apart, or one thousand feet apart
to properly characterize the condi-
tions? And if a path is made for one
hundred miles now and, twelve hours
later, a parallel path in the opposite
direction, will there be any correla-
tion between the two sets of data; or
has the passage of time played such
an important role in the processes at
work that the second path is meaning-
less for purposes of correlation?

And furthermore, how far apart
should the paths be? Is a ten-mile
spacing close enough, or should it be
one mile? If one mile is the answer,
an entirely new problem has been
introduced. Can position on the ocean
with less than one mile precision be
determined?

There’s another real danger in
mapping this volume of water. If too
little data is taken, it may be impos-
sible to learn what is going on within
the volume. On the other hand, too
much data might be impossible to
process and understand. Thus, if
scientists knew precisely what they
were looking for, the problem of deﬁ-
nition would be made somewhat
easier. There is the real danger of
overlooking a signiﬁcant effect by

using data of too coarse a grain.
This example simply demonstrates
the difficulty in deﬁning certain basic
problems related to research at sea,
and it has within it an important les-
son for scientists and engineers. Any
system designed today, regardless of
the basis on which it is established,
must be inherently ﬂexible so that
redeﬁnition of the basic problem,
growing out of newly acquired knowl-
edge, does not result. in the system’s
immediate absolescence. Each system

today n1ust have growth potential so
that higher degrees of accuracy can
be recorded and processed and n1ore
variables recorded. Finally, the data
must be in a raw form that allows
correlation processes to be explored.
Seagoing Surveys

The development of instrumenta-
tion for survey purposes has suffered
for lack of an incentive for the growth
of research techniques. In the past,

most marine scientists were engaged‘

in individual research and sought
tools with a capability peculiar to
their own endeavor. With few excep-
tions, there has been little effort to
standardize survey tools, and those
that have been standardized are ar-
chaic by any present-day standards.
The reasons for lack of attention to
survey type instruments are obvious.
The most obvious is the lack of fund_-
ing for oceanographic pursuits in gen-
eral. This has resulted in a dearth of
good instruments designed particu-

larly for surve_v purposes. Thus, signi-
ﬁcant advances in the marine sciences
will require design, development. and
manufacture of survey instruments
that are characterized by high reli-
ability and repeatability and that can
be produced at a price that will en-
courage the construction of survey
instrumentation suits consistent with
the magnitude of the job to be done.

There is a further need for the de-
velopment of integrated oceano-
graphic systems. There are systems
in which a number of fundamental
sensors are combined for the simulta-
neous observation and recording of a
number of variables.

Basically, there are two types of
integrated instrumentation systems.
First are the research or special pur-
pose systems. These systems are spe-
ciﬁcally tailored to perform unusual
and not necessarily repetitive tasks.
They require a high degree of thought
and planning of the on—station time
of the scientist is to be economically
used.

The second type system, the
survey system, must preform a repeti-
tive function in examining large
masses of data from which forecasting
techniques can be developed. Simply
stated, the need here is for an efficient,
reliable data-gathering system de-
signed for the routine acquisition of
large quantities of data of all types
over world-wide ocean areas. Further-
more, the _system must have reserve
capability for making the detailed
observations required from time to
time by speciﬁc scientiﬁc or military
objectives.

To meet these requirements, the in-
ternational implications of survey
data collection must be kept in mind.
Inputs from the researches of many
nations must be combined to form a
central pool of knowledge from which
the basic laws of the sea can be
derived. Therefore, many national
and international agencies must. co-
operate in the conduct of survey
operations. This necessity demands
flexibility in performing measure-
ments of various types, quantities,
and accuracies.

Survey System Design

To meet the requirements of a sur-
vey system, the equipment designer
must be aware of the constantly

changing art of sensor design. Antici-
pated improvements in the future
dictate that the system have sufﬁcient
growth potential to accommodate sen-
sors of new types and greater ac-
curacy. Although all the possible
applications of the survey system
cannot. be foreseen at this time,
changes will inevitably occur both in
the physical implementation and ap-
plication of the system. Therefore, it
is important that the basic data-
handling techniques designed into the
system at the outset be adaptable to
the cycle of change.

A good example of this need is
bathymetry. In the past, depth in-
formation has been recorded and
measured by an acoustic fathometer
with a 60-degree beam width. In shal-
low depths, beam width was of no
particular consequence. \Vhen mea-
surements were made in deeper water,
the area covered became critical. The
return from the bottom. read on the
fathometer record. showed many in-
separable responses from a single
transniitted pulse and, in fact. mea-
sured only the shortest acoustical
path. This caused loss of bottom de-
tail and usually indicated a depth less
than actual depth.

Any system designed to handle data
received from this type device would
be hopelessly inapplicable in light of
recent developments in the ﬁeld of
bathymetry. Oceanographers can now
measure depths of points located so
close together that the points cannot
be clearly differentiated geographi-
cally. This precision for the resolu-
tion of bottom variations is valuable
to many investigators even though a
geographic plot is never made of each
point.

Using a vertically stablized
precision fathometer with a beam
width of 7 degrees. the area illumi-
nated is 100 times less than if a 60-
degree instrument were 11sed. thereby
providing a far more detailed descrip-
tion of a given area. Besides permit-
ting accurate exploration of sharp
discontinuities, this precision will en-
able a potential user to decide
whether a bottom submarine could
safely hide in the mass of bottom clu-
tter that would appear on a bottom-
mapping sonar.

In measuring ambient light, the

same considerations apply. It is im-
portant for the oceanographer to
know the average transmission as a
function of depth, but those interested
in light beam communications or in
visual detection of underwater objects
will want to know how the trans-
mission factor ﬂuctates.

It appears that prediction of the
performance of all communications
and detection systems depends on
knowing the noise background as well
as the average transmission factor.
Therefore, to collect data of military
interest, bandwidth must be pre-
served. Scientists are interested in
knowledge of energy transmission
that can be inferred from the study
of mixing phenomena and the accu-
rate measurements of gradients, both
of which require that the higher fre-
quency components of the data be
preserved. Temperature, salinity and
sound velocity microstructure and
sharp gradients are important to the
sonar and also require large sensor
and recording bandwidths. Scientiﬁc
discoveries in this ﬁeld have always
followed sensor improvements. The
danger of failing to observe new
phenomena because of restricted fre-
quency response is real.

The actual noise records for the
quantities measured are of no basic
signiﬁcance, since the measurements
are not repeatable. Nevertheless, the
autocorrelation and cross-correlation
functions for these quantities may be
of great importance. The amount of
recorded data might be reduced if the
spectra or correlation functions could
be derived aboard ship, and only the
results recorded. Unfortunately, be-
cause of the variables in the process
of deriving spectra correlation func-
tions and collecting suitable data, the
effect to be searched for must be
known in advance. Such surveys can
be made possible by designing an
adequate survey system.

After a survey system is put into
operation, many unanticiapted data
requirements may arise. The new re-
quirements may be so important as to
force the removal of certain basic sur-
vey sensors if the system is not
capable of handling the increased
load. For this reason, the capabilities
not only of the recording system but
also of the cable transmission band-

10

width and the computer must be gen-
erous in the basic design. In addition,
the system should be open—ended.

Given this theory of system design,
consider a tangible equipment design
problem: data transmission over a
cable.

Several problem areas arise in tele-
metering data over a cable. First,
background noise may reduce relia-
bility and accuracy and increase the
error rate of any coding scheme. These
noises may originate from thermal
noise, cable and terminating losses,
cable pickup from the ship and ex-
ternal impulsive noise sources, cable
ﬂexing, code and transmitter sensor,
bias errors, or counting errors. The
problem of test and calibration of the
instruments in the sensor package im-
poses a limitation on the design of the
package. Problems associated with
the cable, its characteristics and their
vulnerability with time from cable to
cable, may make certain types of cod-
ing schemes completely impractical.

Finally, although the emphasis
must be placed on reducing and re-
cording data in digital form, there
may also be a requirement for pre-
senting continuous analog data. If
some of the possible coding schemes
were used, data at the receiving end
of the cable would be available only
in sample form. Therefore, interpola-
tion or at least smoothing would have
to be used to reconstitute the analog
form.

This interpolation means that
the data either must be bandwidth
limited by the reciprocal of the sample
rate or that induced inaccuracies out-
side this bandwidth be tolerated but
minimized by careful choice of the
set of interpolation functions. The
disadvantage of smoothing is that it
would average the data and remove
the more rapid ﬂuctuations due to
microstructure from the reconstituted
analog data. Neit-her of these situa-
tions presents an attractive choice,
but these constraints must be con-
sidered in the choice of a coding
scheme.

There are challenging mechanical
problems also. Operations at sea are
notoriously precarious because of the
lack of a stable base from which to
work. The vagaries of sea state and
weather seem to be in constant con-

spiracy with corrosion and marine
fouling to make man’s intrusion of
the sea’s domain a failure.

A platform that is satisfactory in a
ﬁve-knot wind might break apart or
be totally unsuitable in a 30—knot
wind when the waves kick up to
between 14 and 28 feet. When operat-
ing a long way from home base, the
seagoing platform must be capable of
withstanding adverse weather. If it
can’t adjust to a wide range of condi-
tions, its usefulness suffers. The re-
rult is a continuing series of com-
promises involving economy in design
and manning, speed, endurance,
range, and the type of work the
platform must carry out.

The modern oceanographic research
survey ship makes many calls on a
mechanical engineer’s skill. The mis-
sion may call for the ship to hover
over a particular spot on the ocean
floor and lower a package of instru-
ments to obtain a proﬁle of oceano-
graphic variables as a function of
depth, or perhaps to extract cores
from the sea ﬂoor.

VVhen the ship is under way, it may
also tow packages of instrumentation.
These may be either deep—running or
close to the surface. There is a tempt-
ing array of design problems involved
in the task of towing a 1000-pound
instrument package at ﬁve to ten
thousand feet below the surface at a
speed of ﬁve to ten knots. The inter-
action of drag with cable proﬁle and
strength per unit of cross section pre-
sents an interesting combination of
variables, and present towing systems
are so poor as to make the solution of
this one problem an economically
fertile ﬁeld for the developer of
something better.

Modern oceanographic ships some-
day will be equipped with submersible
vehicles that can carry two or three
men to the bottom of the sea. Han-
dling vehicles weighing ten tons or
more in a heavy sea is difficult, but
the problem must be solved. The
vehicles will be much less useful if
their operation is limited to those
days when the sea is calm.

Important problems of ship control
exist. Economic pressure for more
effective use of the limited national
oceanographic budget suggests that
all elements of ship control be ex-

amined to eliminate human effort
wherever possible. Unfortunately,
ships are designed along traditional
manning lines. As a result, the ship
is ﬁrst a seagoing hotel, and second a
useful piece of marine equipment.

But economies can be effected in all
phases of a ship’s operation: on the
bridge, in the engine room, on deck,
and in the crew-support functions.
This is being accomplished as evi-
denced by two recent Class I oceano-
graphic survey ships equipped with a
centralized engine—room control sys-
tem. This system permits safe, effi-
cient marine power plant operation
with a one-man engine-room watch.
It includes centralized remote opera-
tion and automatic centralized tech-
niques. Its use should reduce operat-
ing and construction costs, increase
reliability, and decrease downtime in
ship’s operation. But this is only a
beginning.

In summary, the outﬁtting of a sea-
going oceanographic survey or re-

search platform presents a challenging
opportunity for all branches of the
engineering profession to join together
in devising the most appropriate and
economical system. This system must
be designed from the keel up. The
interdependence of displacement, sea-
keeping ability, speed and directional
control, prime and auxiliary power
requirements, navigational system,
communications equipment, the scien-

‘tiﬁc equipment complement, and the

manpower required to operate the sta-
tion must be recognized.

A truly successful system in all
senses will be achieved only when
these variables are competently bal-
anced, optimizing them with regard
to the immediate mission, and, at the
same time, leaving the system open-
ended, so that as requirements change
the capability of the ship can also be
changed.

The Atlantis II, recently completed
for the Woods Hole Oceanographic In-
stitution, and the recently authorized

catamaran type of vehicle for the
Chesapeake Bay Institute of The
Johns Hopkins University, are evi-
dence of this trend. The design of the
total ship system is a ﬁeld that is just
beginning to be developed. Thus, a
great opportunity exists for a signiﬁ-
cant contribution by the engineer
profession to an expanding science.

This discussion has been concerned
primarily with the tools for obtaining
information, but other areas of ocean-
ographic concern, which can only be
successfully explored with the help of
engineering innovation, should not be
overlooked. These include farming
the sea for ﬁsh and other living orga-
nisms; recovering of minerals, particu-
larly the undersea completion of oil
and gas wells; the recovery of fresh
water from the sea; waste disposal;
and many new military problems that
will arise from man’s increasing store
of knowledge of the sea.

THE ENGINEERS’

St. Patrick was an engineer. This fact has been pro-
claimed by engineering schools for the past ﬁfty years,
and has just been historically proven. An ancient docu-
ment dating back to the time of St. Patrick was recently
discovered in Ireland, and it contained the words which
every engineer knew it would: Erin Go Braugh. This,
loosely translated, means “St. Patrick was an engineer.”

“Of course,” engineers explain, “it’s a rather loose
translation.” But engineers further explain that there
is a deﬁnite basis for their claim. “Didn’t St. Pat drive
the snakes out of Ireland, and wasn’t that the ﬁrst worm
drive! Therefore, St. Patrick was an engineer.”

Actual celebration began 59 years ago by engineers at
the University of Missouri. At that time there was little
proof that the Irish ever had any connection with the pro-
fession. But needing a vacation, a group of students from
that campus claimed that they had received knowledge
of the saint’s field of endeavor in what they called a
“revelation,” and celebrated his birthday by cutting all
their classes and engaging in various forms of merriment.

As a result of the disciplinary action which followed
shortly thereafter, several of the more active celebrants
were absent from their classes for a much longer period.
Two years later, however, the celebration of St. Pat-
rick’s Day by the engineering students was ofﬁcially recog-
nized by the university administration.

Iowa State College and the University of Arkansas fol-
lowed Missouri’s lead by establishing a special day of
festivities in 1909. It was not long before most of the
engineering schools west of the Mississippi took the cry,
and now the “Engineers’ Day” or “Week” is a very cele-
brated occasion around these parts. The east—of-the-Mis-
sissippian schools have been somewhat behind their
“younger” brothers to the west but they are now carrying
on the tradition.- There is a trend to hold this festive
occasion on Washington’s birthday in February, he being
the first American engineer, but the St. Pat tradition
still prevails.

Most of those “western” engineering schools have a
week of celebration ﬁlled with such events as float parades,
special Church services, lab exhibits and open houses,
barbecues and parties, professional society meetings,
beard growing contests, tea parties, senior banquets-,
campus stunts, Engineers Carnivals, and last but not
least, pre-election political rallies put on by the candidates
for St. Patricia, usually in the form of a “cheesecake”
show. St. Patricia is then crowned at the Engineers’ Ball.

The big occasion for most of these schools (besides the
climaxing dance) is the arrival of St. Patrick dressed in
green and gold robes and sporting a beard which would
put Rip Van Winkle to shame.

‘I6

Each year he arrives by a different mode of trans-
portation, using anything from an airplane to a steam
shovel. His favorite “carriage” is the railroad hand car.
It is said that back in 1914, the actual body of St. Patrick
was resurrected from his grave in Ireland and brought to
the Iowa State Celebration. After being carried around in
a parade, St. Patrick was called upon to make a speech to
the students. Since being interred for quite a few years
and not upon the latest talk, he was only able to say a
few words, “I’m glad to be here.”

On these occasions, St. Patrick is assisted by the Guard
of St. Patrick, a group of outstanding engineering students
who are tapped to this honorary society. Pledges to the
group are called “Squires,” and members of it are known
as “Knights.”

The Squires are initiated to the Guard of St. Patrick
on the evening of the Engineers’ Ball by being “knighted”
with a two foot slide rule by St. Patrick and they show
their faith by kissing the “Blarney Stone.”

Since the Squires are required to kiss the Blarney
Stone before they become Knights, the stone has caused
no little excitement in some of the universities. It seems
that some of the boys from foreign schools (any school
other than Engineering or Mines) have ‘made strong
attempts to steal it from the Engineers. But under the
protection of the Squires, it has been kept-‘ out of
mischievous hands.

A ﬁne thing about these weeks is the fact that all the
students take part in the week, and at least 50 percent of
them are in on the planning of it or at work on the
departmental displays. That is what makes it what it is
——an Engineers’ Week.

At Pitt, Engineers’ Week was ﬁrst observed in 1954.
Since then the annual celebration has become increasingly
larger in scope, until it is now one of the major events
on the University of Pittsburgh campus.

St. Patrick’s arrival is still one of the highlights of the
Week, and the mode of transportation is a closely guarded
secret until the time of arrival.

Competition runs high during the week among the

V nine engineering departments. By means of a point sys-

tem, each department accumulates a certain number of
points for the entire week which positions it a certain
number of standard deviations on one side or -the other
of the mean department. The winning department is
then chosen. The points are awarded for participation in
Engineers’ Week activities. These activi-ties include pre-
sentation of technical displays, participation in the debate,
and gimmick and attendance at various activities
throughout the Week.

Your life at Du Pont one of a series for technical graduates

How to tell a career from a job

A job is a job. A career is a place to grow. A career has a future.
A job lives from day to day. In a job you get what you can, do
what you must. In a career, rewards parallel your contributions.

We're a career company. More than a third of our 90,000
employees have been with us at least 15 years; 10,000 for more
than 25 years. There are reasons for this. To assure growth we
invest over $90 million a year in research. Fifty percent of last
year's sales ($2.4 billion) came from products unheard of just
28 years ago. Because customers like these products, we've
grown 750% since 1937. —

Our career men share in this growth because we fill virtually
all responsible positions from within. Our young men work in
several areas to develop their capabilities. This way they can
change positions without leaving the company.

There are job men and career men. If you seek a career, we'd
like to tell you about an interesting and rewarding one at
Du Pont. Write us a letter or clip and mail our coupon today.

The

The simple use of mirror—reflected
sunlight for communications is very
old. Greek soldiers used mirror sig-
nals in the pre-Christian era: the
British Army used the mechanically
ingenious heliograph for code signals
during‘ the conquest of India; and the
U. S. Army employed this system on
maneuvers during the exploration of
our great western expanses. The basic
principle of audio transmission by
modulated light appears to have been
originally conceived by Alexander
Graham Bell. A patent for a “Photo-
phone” was issued to him in 1880,
although the rudimentary nature of
his apparatus leaves reasonable doubt
as to its effectiveness.

Since that time, a number of pat-
ents have been issued that represent
apparent refinement or improvement
on the concept. With one exception,
however, all such patents require a

30

Retrometer

power supply at each station in the
system. The exception is a “Beam
Communications System,” patent
issued to Mr. R. B. McFarlane in
1962, where a remote speaking station
is vice-powered. It does require the
sun as a light source and, therefore,
retains a substantial limitation on
freedom of use.

For longer-range communications,
much consideration has been given to
the ruby laser beam (light amplifica-
tion by stimulated emission of radia-
tion). The Bell Labs, I.B.M., and
other companies are already experi-
menting with beams that will be able
to carry several million simultaneous
telephone conversations. However,
the intensity of light available from a
ruby laser depends largely on the
number of atoms available for stimu-
lation: i.e., the size of the ruby. A
solid. such as a ruby, has more atoms

by Ralph G. Smith

by volume than a gas, and a big ruby
has more atoms than a small ruby,
necessitating the development of a
uniform catalyst to furnish the atoms
for stimulation.

Now a new system of voice com-
munications, transmitted on a beam
of light, has been developed by the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration’s Langley Research Cen-
ter. It is called the Retrometer,
because the light beam over which
voice signals are sent is returned to
its source by a simple reﬂector. This
system differs from prior systems in
that the originating station requires
no power, other than that of the
human voice.

Devised by Numa E. Thomas of
the Langley Research Center during
an investigation of various communi-
cations systems that might be used
by an astronaut during the re—entry,

radio black~out period, this system
appears to have applications other
than in space. Among military appli-
cations are air-sea rescue operations;
air-to-sea, ship-to-ship, and ship-to-
shore communications; air refueling
operations; tactical communications;
and clandestine operations. Certain
aspects of the Retrometer make it in-
viting in several of these applications,
notably, the fact that its communica-
tions are secure, that it causes no
stray electromagnetic radiation, and
that the corner reflector could readily
be parachuted or packed in life rafts
and survival kits.

The Army also sees a use for mes-
sage-carrying beams in open-air bat-
tleﬁeld situations. “It’s hard to com-
municate secretly by radio, because
radio waves fan out and an enemy
can intercept them,” reported Army
Research Chief Robert Watson in the
October 24th issue of the SATUR-
DAY EVENING POST.

Among commercial applications are
surveying; use on construction sites
(particularly those where radio trans-
missions are interdicted by blasting
operations, or rendered difficult by
steelwork or tunnels); use in steel
mills, where high noise levels and
radio-frequency interference are prob-
lems; light-plane-to—tower communi-
cations; communications during spe-
cial events and political conventions;
and emergency situations, including

A variety of applications can be envisioned, Among them are audience participa-
tion, ground-to-air communications, space communications, communications at
construction sites, and telementary of moving machinery.

forest ﬁres, shipwrecks, and other
disasters.

For sophisticated long-range sys-
tems, the use of a laser as a light
source could be combined with the

Retrometer. It could then be
modiﬁed to permit two—way
communication.

The source/receiver unit consists
of a source of light with provision for
focusing it into a narrow beam; optics
for collecting reﬂected light and di-
recting it onto a photosensitive cell;
and an audio ampliﬁer and speaker.
The corner reﬂector has three mu-
tually perpendicular reﬂecting sur-
faces, and these have the unique
ability of returning a light beam ex-
actly to its source. In other words,
the three reﬂecting sides of a corner
are able to return an incident light
beam to its source even though the
corner is not as accurately oriented
as a single mirror would have to be.

Two of the surfaces in this corner
reﬂector are rigid, front-surface mir-
rors, and the third is a ﬂexible, highly
reﬂective diaphragm. The ﬂexible
surface, vi-brating acoustically in re-
sponse to the human voice, slightly
displaces the returning light beam
and thus modulates it. Information

32

 

is thus carried on the reﬂected beam
in such a manner that the energy per
unit area, falling on the collecting
optics and the photocell, varies in pro-
portion to the modulation impressed
on the ﬂexible surface of the corner
reﬂector. The photocell converts the
ﬂuctuations of the reﬂected beam into
an electric output that is ampliﬁed
and converted into sound by ampliﬁer
and speaker.

The Retrometer is substantially in-
sensitive to precise aiming of the pas-
sive modulator unit, to thermal gra-
dients in the atmosphere, and to a
high level of ambient light. The ﬁrst
it, of course, explained by the optical
characteristics of a corner reﬂector.
It was found that the corner reﬂector
may be off axis by as much as 20
degree without noticeable loss of
volume. Refraction gradients un-
doubetedly do bend the beam in
passing from the source to the reﬂec-
tor; but since the returning light en-
counters the same gradients in the
opposite direction, the eﬂects are self-
compensating. As to operation in
ambient light, the level of light may
be high in daytime, but it is relatively
unchanging compared to voice fre-
quencies; the receiver unit is thus able

to separate the modulated component
from the bright, but comparatively
unchanging, ambient light.

Experience with models con-
structed so far suggests that the Re-
trometer has certain basic advantages
and limitations, some of them sus-
ceptible to modiﬁcation by further
development work. The advantages
are that the unit may be produced at
very low cost, particularly for the cor-
ner reﬂector or speaking station; no
power is required at the speaking sta-
tion; private communication is vir-
tually assured, since the return signal
is conﬁned to a narrow beam and
could be intercepted only with great
difficulty; there is no need for precise
pointing of the corner reﬂector, an
unusually marked advantage over
prior light—beam communications sys-
tems; and, the operator has an easy
selection of a number of stations from
a central point without switching
mechanisms.

The chief limitations are those in-
herent in one-way communications:
difficulty in alerting an inattentive sta-
tion, inability of the source/receiver
station to question remote stations
speciﬁcally, and, at a remote station,
the psychological drawback upon the
speaker of being uncertain that his
transmission is received. In some ap-
plications, particularly those at long
range where the exact location of t-he
remote corner reﬂector is not known,
the problem of acquisition; that is, of
ﬁnd the reﬂector and establishing
communications, may present a prob-
lem. To aid in acquisition, the beam
may be somewhat defocused to in-
crease the possibility of hitting the
reﬂector, though, at extreme ranges,

Your first job...wil| it be all you hope for? 

MINE WAS, and it has never ceased to be. I joined
United States Rubber as a chemical engineer right after
my graduation in 1952, and the years since have held a
series of stimulating challenges. Why U.S.? A lot of
things inﬂuenced my choice. I knew there’d be a variety
of projects there, the programs you’d find only in a large
company with great diversiﬁcation. I’d heard that U.S.
encouraged individual responsibility in an atmosphere of
freedom. I knew of the Company’s record for leadership
in technical advances. At U.S. Rubber I’ve learned that
the Company regards men of industry and imagination
as their most valuable asset.

HOW ABOUT YOURS? \V> hope that you, too, will
find the opportunity you’re looking for at United States
Rubber. if so, you’ll be part of a team that, in the last five
years, obtained over 500 patcnts—more than our two largest
competitors combined. You’ll join a select group of 2,000 engi-
neers and research personnel, worl<ing for one of America’s
largest industrial companies operating 7-1 plants at home and
abroad. You’ll join a company that makes 33,000 products.
Less than half of our business is in tires, and U.S. is one of
the nation’s largest producers of textiles and chemicals. Y0u’ll
join a Company that, more than 100 years ago, made the first
manufactured vulcanized rubber product and where, today,
we contribute our resources and skills to atomic research,
oceanography, the latest designs in space stations ant’
hundreds of other exciting projects.

meets the Atlantic Ocean. The new facility cuts driving time between. New York and Florida by
an hour and a half and bypasses Washington, D. C. and Baltimore.

The civil engineering achievement combines 191/2 miles of low-level trestle, four man made
islands raised from the bottom of the Bay, two tunnels. each over a mile long, a high and medium-
level bridge and several miles of approach roads-. T wo-thirds of the project‘s length is made up
of low-level trestle. consisting of 858 spans of 75 ft. with a ‘.25 ft. clearan.ce over mean low-level.
It and other bridge structures are designed for 20 ft. waves and 10 ft. storm surge. The super-
structure for each trestle span consists of pre-cast. prestressed concrete units resting on precast
concrete pile caps which are supported by sand—filled 53 in. diameter concrete piles.

To assure navagation requirements for major naval vessels and commercial shipping, two tunnels
were built at channel locations. Entry to the tunnels is through four man-made islands built of
sand in 4-0 ft. of water. The islands are 1.500 ft. long and 250 ft. wide. \Vatertight sections of
double-walled steel casing 300 ft. lengths. were fabricated in Texas. towed 1.700 miles to Norfolk,
Va., and eventually sunk into a leveled trench beneath the sea. These formed the two mile-long
tunnels which are ventilated by equipment located on the islands.

Commuters someday may be ridin.g over an an elecated “magnetic
highway in cars without wheels. The concept of such a. future wheel- ~ 1 <
less transportation system has been advanced by engineers of \Vesting—
house Electric Corporation. The system would ﬂoat the vehicle mag-
netically and drive it with an electric motor that has no rotating parts.

‘-I

To demonstrate the principle of the magnetic suspension system a
one—passenger vehicle has been constructed by the V\'estinghouse Re-
search Laboratories. Permanent ma.gnets. located on. the underside of Mg.
the vehicle and in the double rails, suspended the car slightly above ,
its tracks. A slight push of the fingertips is force enough to send the ’-v,-~1
vehicle on its near frictionless journey.

Such a magnetic suspension system requires that the magnets not ‘i
only be strong. but also be extremely resistant to loss i11 strength over
extended periods of time. New ceramic materials commonly known as ”-‘T’
“ferrite” permanent magnets, have the strength to supply the neces-
sary force of repulsion or lift. They resist magnetic loss or demagneti- pg ..
zation some three to five times better than materials available only a ,
few years ago. ‘*1

In a full-scale system. the car would most likely be suspended ‘
from an overhead rail. The magnetic suspension. and electric drive 
thus could more easily be shielded from the weather. The stator. ‘
which is the stationary part of any motor, would be stretched out 0"-«*
lengthwise. The rotor would also be constructed in linear form would

be mounted atop the vehicle. directly beneath the stator. Electricity, ,.,,
ﬂowing in the stator. would drag the rotor and the attached vehicle ‘
ahead, for the same reason that it spins the rotor in a conventional wui

electric motor.

Transit engineers believe the “magnetic highway” has promise for I
high—speed, point—to-point, intercity land transportation systems of the
future.

Glass resstors as big around as telephone poles are used in point—to—point communications
between stations in the Mercury “'orldwide Tracking Network. being utilized for the Gemini
program. The resistors are four feet long. Ordinar_v resistors. such as those used in radio and
television receivers in the home. are usually no more than a few inches long and about as thick as a
pencil. These big resistors serve as dummy loads for testing and calibrating transmitters and as
power dissipating terminations for rhombic and other transmitting antennas. because they are com-
pact. less costly and practically unaffected by corrosion. The function of such a dummy antenna
load is to take the place of an antenna on a transmitter during testing and calibration so that a
signal is not broadcast.

 

Manufacturer of the high frequency transmitters and receivers for the Mercury Wlorldwide
Tracking Network is Technical Material Corporation. of l\/Iamaroneck. N. Y. Glass resistors were
specified because of their low. uniform reactance at high frequencies. The resistors can be brought
instantly to full rated output even at minus 40°C. The resistive elements were spiraled to obtain
speciﬁc ohmic values. uniform heat dissipation, and minimum series nductance and shunt capacitance
for each individual installation.

A whipsy synthetic membrane. only a thousandth of an inch thick.
may soon bring to reality man's age—old wish to “breathe” under water
like a ﬁsh. It may also hold the answer to a simple system for supply-
ing submarines with air drawn from the surrounding sea, the puriﬁca-
tion of air in space capsules or moon stations. and a means of provid-
ing cheap oxygen supplies for patients in hospitals or at home.

General Electric’s Research Laboratory developed a method of
producing a very thin, hole—free. yet permeable. silicone film that
permits the passage of gases and liquids in both directions. The key
to its usefulness is its “selectivity” or ability to let gases pass through
at different rates.

The “aqua-hamster,”—shown in the photograph—is kept alive by
an artiﬁcia “gill"——a special synthetic membrane stretched across the
top, bottom. and two sides of its underwater home. The “gill” ex-
tracts air from the surrounding water. while resisting the passage of
the liquid. Carbon dioxide exhaled by the hamster passes out through
the membrane. dissolves in the water. and is carried away. \Vithout
the “gill,” the animal would suffocate. The membrane or “gill” was
invented by Dr. \Valter L. Robb (rear). of General Electric. Tubes

at left are used to circulate water through the outer fish tank.

Since sea water is essentially saturated with air to a depth of many
hundreds of feet, a membrane with sea water on one side will extract
air from the water while resisting the passage of water under great
pressure. Noxious gases will pass through the membrane in the reverse
direction.

Many industrial and home applications are also under study, in-
cluding separation and enrichment of gases, portable air-regeneration
systems, dehumidifying and purifying of air in the home.

to be cemented to the frame. For at-
tachment, Eastman 910 Contact Ad-
hesive, or its equivalent, will serve.
Because the Mylar must be tightly
stretched over its frame to eliminate
surface irregularities, a ﬁxture is de-
sirable to aid the stretching and
cementing operations.

When the source/receiver and the
corner/reﬂector unit have both been
completed, it is necessaryito adjust
the reﬂector surfaces to precise per-
pendicularity. The following sequence
will simplify the task:

1. Place the corner reﬂector unit

in a holding device.

' 2. Place the source/receiver in an-
other holding device at a dis-
tance greater than 30 feet from
the reﬂector, and aim the two
units at each other.

3. Mount white cardboard behind
the source/receiver unit, turn on
the light source, and darken the
room.

44 Then, without disturbing the
aim of the corner reﬂector, ad-
just each reﬂecting surface to
focus reﬂections on the card for
minimum light spill around the
shadow of the source/receiver.

Operate the source/receiver by
turning on the power switch, adjust-
ing the beam for a fairly broad
spread, and pointing it at the corner
reﬂector. When the reﬂector returns
the beam and establishes communica-
tion, reduce the spread of the beam
and adjust the volume control to a
comfortable level.

Operate the corner reﬂector simply
by aiming it at the source/receiver
unit. When the light beam falls on
the reflector, talk into the perforated
housing at the read of the ﬂexible dia-
phragm. Determine, experimentally,
the volume and closeness desirable at
various ranges. Overmodulation —
talking too loudly — can cause distor-
tion or acoustic feedback at extremely
close ranges. The Retrometer is now
ready for use.

The Retrometer is an invention
looking for a job. It is inexpensive to
construct, compact, and effective in
any number of applications. It is
looking for a mind that can visualize
new applications and modiﬁcations.

Why become an engineer at
Garrett-AiResearch? You’ll have to

work harder and use more of

your knowledge than engineers

at most other companies.

If you’re our kind of engineer,
you have some very deﬁnite ideas
about your career.

For example:

You’ve worked hard to get a
good education. Now you want to
put it to work in the best way
possible.

You will never be satisﬁed with
run-of-the-mill assignments. You
demand exciting, -
challenging projects.

You not only accept
individual responsibil- 
ity — you insist upon it. ‘f

Does that sound like 
you? Then AiResearch  p_
is your cup of tea. D

Our business is
mainly in sophisticated aerospace
systems and subsystems.

Here, research, design, and de-
velopment lead to production of

  
 

actual hardware.
That means you
have the oppor-
tunity to start with
a customer’s problem
and see it through to a
system that will get the job done.
The product lines at AiResearch,
Los Angeles Division, are environ-
mental systems, ﬂight information
 '- and controls sys-
tems, heat transfer
systems, secondary
power generator
 systems for missiles
V and space, electri-
cal systems, and
specialized indus-
trial systems.
In the Phoenix Division there are
gas turbines for propulsion and
secondary power, valves and con-
trol systems, air turbine starters
and motors, solar and nuclear
power systems.
In each category AiResearch
employs three kinds of engineers.
Preliminary design engineers do
the analytical and theoretical
work, then write proposals.
Design engineers do the lay-
outs; turn an idea into a product.
Developmental engineers are
responsible for making hardware
out of concepts.
Whichever ﬁeld ﬁts you best, we
can guarantee you this: you can
go as far and fast as your talents

  
  

can carry you. You can make as
much money as any engineer in a
comparable spot — anywhere. And
of course, at AiResearch, you’ll
get all the plus beneﬁts a top com-
pany oﬁers.

Our engineering staff is smaller
than comparable companies. This
spells opportunity. It gives a man
who wants to make a mark plenty
of elbow room to expand. And
while he’s doing it he’s working
with, and learning from, some of
the real pros in the ﬁeld.

If the AiResearch story sounds
like opportunity speaking to you-
don’t fail to contact AiResearch,

10 years from now he may tire of
working with computers

10 years ago he didn’t wait for a
computer's verdict

People matter more than computers

To lure smart young engineers, we feature up-to-date com-
puter facilities. That’s one good reason to have computers.
We have even more compelling reasons, not all to be found
in our widely advertised product lines like family cameras,
ﬁlm, textile ﬁbers, office equipment, plastics, etc.

What prudence prevents us from publicly spilling is what
occupies and fascinates a large corps of mechanical engi-
neers like Edward T. Kern (right) and his younger colleague,
William S. Walsh. To more colleagues from among the
mechanical engineers of the Class of 1965, we hereby offer
our persuasive combination of long-haul stability and
internal mobility.

We respect an engineer for requesting a chance to broaden
himself by a change of assignment. Both men pictured
here did so.

When we hired Ed fresh out of college in 1947, we had
him spend a year personally running a lathe and doing
bench assembly on new production equipment for ﬁlm
manufacture. (We rarely start engineers that way any more.)
Then, until 1955, he developed machinery for paper-sensi-
tizing and ﬁlm-emulsion coating. Next came a stint bossing
a 75-man crew that erected, maintained, and repaired

buildings and equipment for processing KODACOLOR Prints
and other large-volume photographic products. Feeling his
feet all too ﬁrmly on the ground after three years of this,
he decided to grapple with a subtler form of reality than
concerns the average pipeﬁtter, electrician, or bricklayer.

This decision he made just in time to join his present
team, then forming. For a while he found himself pitching
in with proposal preparation, customer contact, subcontract
technical co-ordination, customer brieﬁngs, etc. Gradually
the assignment evolved from communicating about techni-
cal matters to generating rather fundamental technical con-
tent of his own. This he does today, living the life of the
systems engineer, surrounded by logic, concepts, and limit-
ing parameters.

Bill, a 1962 graduate, spent his ﬁrst year in vibration
analysis and learned how unimportant is the distinction
between an E.E. (which his diploma calls him) and an M.E.,
under which heading he now ventures on the same frontier
with Kern. Before we throw him his retirement party, for
all we know, he may win honors as the greatest living ex-
pert on knitting machinery. We have many interests.

Should You Work for a Big Company?

An interview with General Electric’s S. W. Corbin, Vice President and General Manager, industrial Sales Division.

 

S. W. CORBIN

I Wells Corbin heads what is probably
the world's largest industrial sales organi-
zation, employing more than 8000 persons
and selling hundreds of thousands of di-
verse products. He joined General Electric
in 1930 as a student engineer after gradu-
ation from Union College with a BSEE. After
moving through several assignments in in-
dustrial engineering and sales management,
he assumed his present position in 1960.
He was elected a General Electric vice
president in 1963.

Q. Mr. Corbin, why should I work for
a big company? Are there some
special advantages?

A. Just for a minute, consider what
the scope of product mix often found
in a big company means to you. A
broad range of products and services
gives you a variety of starting places
now. It widens tremendously your op-
portunity for growth. Engineers and
scientists at General Electric re-
search, design, manufacture and sell
thousands of products from micro-
miniature electronic components and
computer-controlled steel-mill sys-
tems for industry; to the world's
largest turbine-generators for utili-
ties; to radios, TV sets and appli-

ances for consumers; to satellites
and other complex systems for aero-
space and defense.

Q. How about attaining positions of
responsibility?

A. How much responsibility do you
want? If you’d like to contribute to
the design of tomorrow's atomic re-
actors—or work on the installation
of complex industrial systems—or
take part in supervising the manu-
facture of exotic machine-tool con-
trols—or design new hardware or
software for G-E computers—or direct
a million dollars in annual sales
through distributors—you can do it,
in a big company like General Elec-
tric, if you show you have the ability.
There's no limit to responsibility . . .
except your own talent and desire.

Q. Can big companies offer advan-
tages in training and career develop-
ment programs?

A. Yes. We employ large numbers of
people each year so we can often set
up specialized training programs
that are hard to duplicate elsewhere.
Our Technical Marketing Program,
for example, has specialized assign-
ments both for initial training and
career development that vary de-
pending on whether you want a
future in sales, application engineer-
ing or installation and service engi-
neering. in the Manufacturing Pro-
gram, assignments are given in manu-
facturing engineering, factory super-
vision, quality control, materials man-

FOR MORE INFORMATION on careers for en

agement or plant engineering. Other
specialized programs exist, like the
Product Engineering Program for you
prospective creative design engineers,
and the highly selective Research
Training Program.

Q. Doesn't that mean there will be
more competition for the top jobs?

A. You'll always find competition
for a good job, no matter where
you go! But in a company like G.E.
where there are 150 product opera-
tions, with broad research and sales
organizations to back them up, you'll
have less chance for your ambition to
be stalemated. Why? Simply because
there are more top jobs to compete
for.

Q. How can a big company help me
fight technological obsolescence?

A. Wherever you are in General Elec-
tric, you’ll be helping create a rapid
pace of product development to
serve highly competitive markets. As
a member of the G-E team, you’ll
be on the leading edge of the wave
of advancement—by adapting new re-
search findings to product designs,
by keeping your customers informed
of new product developments that
can improve or even revolutionize
their operations, and by developing
new machines, processes and
methods to manufacture these new
products. And there will be class-
work too. There's too much to be
done to let you get out of date!

in their respective ﬁelds.

Dr. Y. S. Tang, Group Project Engineer in the Heat

Earth’s vast “inner space,” the sea,
is still virtually unexplored. N ew
oceanographic survey and research
tools are needed to gather the infor-
mation necessary for studying the

sea’s physical and biological systems.

The sea is a mantel that covers
71 percent of the surface of the earth
to an average depth of 12,000 feet. If
all of the irregularities of earth’s sur-
face were smoothed out, this mantel
would cover the complete planet to a
depth of 7500 feet.

Four—ﬁft—hs of the animal life on
earth, except for insects, live within
the sea. On the sea bottom are many
forms of animal life, some swimming,
some crawling or burrowing, and
others, like the coral, stationary.
Little is known about the process of
birth, life, death, procreation of these
organisms, and little is known of the
physical environment in which they
live — its temperature, salinity, den-
sity, sediment, turbidity, currents,
oxygen content, light, and many other
variables that may be undiscovered
and unnamed.

There is abundant wealth within
the sea. At a penny a pound, the salt
in a cubic mile of seawater is worth
2.3 billion dollars; magnesium worth
3 billion dollars. The sea is of im-
mense economic potential to mankind
and immense military signiﬁcance to
America.

Within the last several years there
has been a general awakening in the
United States to the importance of
the sea. The budget for oceanographic
research has grown threefold since
ﬁscal 1961, and the US. now has a
national oceanographic program “to
acquire the understanding of the
ocean and to translate this under-
standing into operational concepts
and hardware that will enable the
United States and its allies to exploit
our peculiarly oceanic position mili-
tary, economically, and politically.”

On Inter-Agency Committee for
Oceanography has been formed to
coordinate the activity of some eight
different government agencies who
have an interest in the future of the
sea. The Chairman of the ICC, a
Navy Assistant Secretary for Re-
search and Development, reports
directly to the President.

To exploit the sea in any manner,
the behavior of the sea must ﬁrst be
understood; the natural laws it follows
must be known. From these natural
laws and observations of covariants,
the sea’s subsequent behavior should
be predictable in much the same way
that weather can be forecast.

With the sea’s behavior accurately
predicted, systems of men and equip-
ment can be designed for the sea‘s ex-
ploitation. For example, a ship is a
simple man—machine system for trans-
portation over the sea. Its sea-keeping
ability is based upon an application
of existing knowledge of winds, waves,
tides, and surface currents. The first
sailors went through painful trial-and-
error procedures before learning to
forecast the behavior of a given hull
form in the sea.Today’s modern ocean
liner usually weathers the heaviest
assault by the elements in the North
Atlantic, but a 25-foot cabin cruiser
cannot last long under such condi-
tions. This is about the extent of
progress in mating man, equipment,
and the environment of t-he sea.

Man’s knowledge of the sea is truly
minute, perhaps because the sea can-
not really be deﬁned generically — its
systems are largely unknown. Today’s
scientiﬁc investigation, which must be
the basis for future progress, is gen-
erally devoted to extending assump-
tions based on an uncertain knowl-
edge of the medium. Indeed, basic
knowledge of the sea is so severely
