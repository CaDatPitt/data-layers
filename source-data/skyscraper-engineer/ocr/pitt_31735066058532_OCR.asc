While compact disc technology is
in its infant stage, presently many
applications are being utilized and
many more are being researched.
Certainly audio compact disc systems
have revolutionized the music
industry by providing resolution
rivaling live performance. Other
computer applications are just now
being realized and will provide
solutions to many of our future
computing needs. Personal
computers were first; it is only a matter
of time before compact disc
technology completely revolutionizes
the way we treat information in our
everyday lives.

How is digital data converted into
an analog signal?
by Sanjiv Gupta

The information on a compact disk is stored in digital
format. That is, the data is a series of numbers which
represent periodic "samples" of the analog signal that will
be output to the speakers. Anytime an analog signal is
digitized, the time between samples is determined by
the maximum frequency that the analog signal contains.
Specifically, according to the Nyquist theory, the
sampling frequency (which is the reciprocal of the
sampling period, or time between samples) must be at
least twice the maximum frequency contained in the
analog signal being sampled. If it is not, a type of
distortion called aliasing will occur when the signal is
converted back from the digital to the analog domain.

The frequency response of human hearing typically
ranges from 20Hz to 20kHz. Therefore, the compact
disk must be capable of storing information in this
frequency range. According to the above discussion,
this implies a minimum sampling frequency of 40kHz.
The actual sampling frequency for digital audio disks is
44.1kHz.

After the information is read off the disk by the laser
pickup, it undergoes a series of modifications that

prepare it for output. These modifications, referred to as
digital signal processing (DSP), are necessary because
the information on the disk is not actually a series of
sequential, periodic samples as described above. The
audio information is stored in a complex format in order to
facilitate the CD player's job of error correction. Error
correction is a process whereby missing information (data
that was not read correctly due to dust on the disk, a
mistracking laser, or any other cause) is reconstructed by
the machine. Sophisticated error correction codes are
stored on the disk which allow the player to interpolate
between existing data to fill in any missing information.
Some CD players also perform digital filtering of the audio
signal, which further improves the sound quality.

The final step is the conversion from digital samples
to a continuous analog signal, performed by a device
called a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). Before the
signal is sent out of the player it must go through an
analog filter which, if the Nyquist criterion explained
above is satisfied, exactly reproduces the original audio
signal. (see diagrams at right)

The Digital Audio Tape
by Sanjiv Gupta

The compact disk is currently the only commercially
available digital audio medium. However, sometime this
year the Rotary-head Digital Audio Tape (RDAT) format
should become available. RDAT has all of the
advantages of the CD, plus it is smaller (an RDAT
cassette is smaller than a regular analog cassette), holds
more information (up to two hours of music, versus a
CD's 70 minutes), and most importantly, can be recorded
on. In fact, the potential advantages of the recordable
RDAT are so great that the industry is taking drastic
measures to insure that RDAT does not render CDs
obsolete instantly. Included in these actions:

— The introduction of the RDAT to the market has
been delayed repeatedly so the major manufacturers can

get a return on their investment in CD technology.

— The sampling rate of the RDAT is 48kHz,
incompatible with the CD's 44.1kHz, making it impossible
to directly transfer digital information between the media.
Copying of CD3 onto RDAT will have to be done through
analog devices, which will introduce noise.

- RDAT players and pre-recorded tapes may be
required by law to incorporate copyright protection
schemes which will not allow the recording of
copyrighted material.

— The price of RDAT players will start at over
$1,000.00 initially, and the tapes, even blank ones, will
cost as much as a CD.

It remains to be seen if the RDAT will catch on
despite its deliberately introduced handicaps. One thing
is certain, however: digital audio, in one form or another,
will be around for a long time. Sales of analog LPs have
already started to drop off considerably, and many
selections are now available exclusively on CDs. The
vinyl record may soon be a thing of the past.

 

Under extreme magnification, the pits on the
surface of a CD would be visible.

evenly spaced time intervals.

Step 2: A "first order hold." The samples
have been converted into a continuous, or

THE SPACE
COMMANDER 300
...AND YOU

by Maurice Rickard

This (facing page) is the Zenith Space
Commander Three Hundred. The Space Command®
remote control principle was, as I determined through
numerous interviews with friends, acquaintances,
strangers, and outright jerks, developed some time in
the early 1960's and was deployed in a great number of
American households during that decade. The Space
Commander we chose to study, number 43-795, was
discovered deep within the bowels of David Lawrence
hall.

Not only that, but Space Command® remote
control is covered by one or more of the following
patents: 2,817,025; 2,821,955; 2,838,668; 2,923, 918;
2,821,954; 2,821,956; 2,902,559. It may, in fact, be
well worth your while to find out exactly what these
patents are for.

On first investigation, this device seems perfectly
harmless, measuring 9.84 cm (length) by 6.19 cm (width)
by 3.17 cm (height, excluding the buttons) , and having
a surface of a brushed metal we believe to be stainless
steel and two distinct shades of molded plastic (both of
which are brown). The two buttons, controlling channel
selection and the volume mute are ideally placed for easy
operation by beings possessing opposable thumbs.

When the spring—loaded button is pushed, a small
cam is retracted into the spring—loaded propulsion
assembly, and then is released, striking its
corresponding rod. This produces a slightly clangorous
tone, not unlike a the sound of a penetrator bullet
striking a metal plate supported by a chicken (mass =
3.18 kg).

In the Skyscraper investigation of the Space
Commander, we found that the cams bore curious scars
on the end that contacts the chimes. These scars were
circular in nature, colored dark grey to black, and were

10

accompanied by a slight deformity in the metal. Even
considering twenty years of the cam striking the end of
the chime, our researchers could not justify the
existence of those scars. It would seem that more
energy was being released in the collision than one
would initially suspect. Curiously, the greater deformity is
present on the front of the cam that strikes the channel
selector. The significance of this has yet to be
determined.

We also tested the effects of the Space
Commander on a few live subjects, most notably SGB
President Phil Moyer. We waited until President Moyer
was a distance of 12.8 m from the barrel of the Space
Commander, then depressed the Mute—Vol button once,
and the channel selector twice. The effects of this test
on President Moyer are still uncertain, and we intend to
observe closely the remainder of President Moyer's
political career, especially that part of it which denies
funding to student organizations. We suggest you do
the same. Interesting observations will be collected at
the Skyscraperoffice, during business hours.

Perhaps even more intriguing is the fact that
within the Space Commander, there are expansion slots
for two more chimes and their accompanying
mechanisms, as shown in the illustration. The two
existing chimes control volume (on or off) and channel
(presumably a channel search process). What would the
other two chimes control? This is, in fact, a mystery. We
interviewed 48.3 individuals who worked for Zenith
during the time of the Space Commander, not one of
whom claims to remember the functions of the two
mystery chimes, although this could be a result of one of
three things: 1) the individuals we talked to did not have
access to the information; 2) the individuals we talked to
are sworn to secrecy; or 3) the proposed functions were

too insignificant to warrant permanent space in memory.
Since it was impractical to conduct exploratory
neurosurgery and/or a hypnotic investigation of these
former Zenith employees before the deadline for this
issue of the Skyscraper, we are restricted to speculation
with a 85% chance of proving idle. After a combined
48.2 minutes of intense reflection on the part of the staff,
we developed a startling hypothesis explaining the
existence of the Space Commander and some proposed
functions of the mystery chimes.

The suitability of the Space Commander to
opposable thumb operation is not lost on the academic
community. With the help of a number of Pitt's research
community, we discovered that the Space Command®
system was, in fact, a last—ditch attempt to prevent beings
lacking opposable thumbs from infiltrating the television
industry; namely, chickens. The high resistance given
by the spring—loading system, coupled with the small, low-
friction surface area of the buttons prevents operation by
beak or claw, the only effective prehensile appendages
available to the chicken. in fact, the only suitable means
of pushing the buttons of the Space Commander
involves having at least one thumbprint, a feature which
chickens, and, in fact, most fowl sorely lack. The
thumbprint is, however, a prominent feature of one family
of the animal community: the primate.

Interestingly, the late 1960's were the first golden
age of research into interspecies communication, mostly
between human beings and animals. Although dolphins
were popular subjects, especially esteemed by people
like John Lilly, much more research was conducted with,
yes, chimpanzees, apes, baboons, and other primates,
all of which possess fingerprints and opposable thumbs.

It is interesting that this research was being
conducted at a time when the predominant form of
remote control was, in fact, operable by only the primate
family. Why was this? During the 1960's, people were

beginning to realize the importance of television as a
vehicle for the control of very large cross-sections of the
population. It was, after all, not until the Kennedy—Nixon
race that presidential debates were broadcast on

television.
Clearly, it became obvious to a number of
researchers, including engineers, sociologists,

zoologists, and, we suspect, the design team of the
Space Commander that this important communications
medium should not be allowed to upset the course of
evolution.

Unfortunately, this effort seems to have been in
vain. Witness, for example, the proliferation of remote
controls with blister—type buttons or "Chiclet" buttons,
often textured, creating a non-slip surface, perhaps for
those of us without the benefit of fingerprints. Could it
be that barnyard fowl have infiltrated the television
industry? We believe so.

Consider the kinds of television shows on the air
today. We have game shows, police shows, family
sitcoms, talk shows, etc. Every show that is broadcast
today falls easily into a certain type. "Hill Street Blues" is
clearly a police show, finding precedent in shows like
"Police Story," "Hawaii 5-0," "Adam 12," and even
"CHiPS." "Perfect Strangers," a sitcom about an
immigrant from the Old Country coming to live with his
American cousin, has roots in shows like "The Odd
Couple," "Laverne and Shirley," and the late Andy
Kaufmann's character, Latka Gravis, in "Taxi." Game
shows were among the first things broadcast on
television, and have remained virtually unchanged since
their first appearance in the 1950's. One possible
exception is "Wheel of Fortune," which is influenced in
part by a medieval system of determining the appropriate
punishment for various social transgressions. Indeed, as
the list goes on and on, it becomes apparent that every
television show on the air today draws upon shows aired

at least ten to fifteen years before. The reason for this is
the nature of instrumental. conditioning.

One form of learning in may life forms is
instrumental learning, in which the subject must derive
for itself what it must do in order to be rewarded. After
performing the correct response and being rewarded a
number of times, with things such as food, approval, or
passing grades, the subject "realizes" what it is that
results in the reward, and repeats the correct response.
This is seen in the training of dogs to do tricks, parrots to
"speak," and undergraduate engineering students to
memorize endless, senseless, streams of unrelated
numbers. The important thing to remember is that once
the reward-provoking response is determined by the
subject, the subject will subsequently respond only in
that way.

The Skyscraper team has determined that,
sometime in the early 1970's, an undisclosed number of
chickens used for interspecies communication and
chickens used for instrumental conditioning were
delivered to the same farm when either their respective
experiments were completed, or funding for these

experiments ran out. It is our belief that the two groups
formed a conspiracy, most probably desiring revenge on
either the experimenters, the society that forced the
experiments to early ends, or perhaps both.

It is, in fact, entirely likely that these chickens were
able to develop a viable plan to take over the television
industry. Ethologist Irene Pepperberg of Northwestern
University says that "Animals have much more complex
communication abilities than we ever imagined.”

Our theory is that the chickens involved with
instrumental conditioning have been involved in the
selection of network programming, while the other
chickens have designed remote control systems (like the
ones mentioned above) specifically for operation by fowl.

We at Skyscraper urge you, the student
community, to join us in encouraging Zenith to reinstate
the Space Command® remote control system... before
it's too late.

Career Day

On March 7, 1987 the annual alumni sponsored
Career Day was held at the University of Pittsburgh. This
program is for high school seniors who have been
admitted into the School of Engineering. During the
morning students heard various engineering
professional speak. Then there were presentations by
each department. These presentations were conducted
jointly by students and alumni. There were also campus
tours and an opportunity for the students to stay
overnight. For more information, please contact Judy
Travis Nychay in 749 Benedum.

SWE Activities

The Society of Women Engineers is as busy as
ever. Currently, they have a career panel discussion on
"What can I do with my engineering degree?" scheduled
for March 25, 1987. SWE is helping out with Career Day
by providing afternoon sessions for the students on
topics such as coping with college. SWE will also provide
a sleep-over for Career Day for those students that want
to stay in the dorms.

SWE is hoping to do a Junior Achievement
Engineering Night. This would consist of a presentation
about engineering for students in the Pittsburgh area
who are involved in Junior Achievement.

SWE currently provides a Company Preview
Service. When a company wants to meet with
interviewees the night before their interview, SWE helps
make arrangements and helps the company with its
presentation if they need overhead projectors and such.

SWE is also active with high school recruitment
through the Day on Campus program. This program
provides high school students the opportunity to spend
the day on campus. A student may also stay overnight if
he/she wishes.

Current, SWE is working on having more technical
speakers during their regular Friday noon meetings.
They plan on having speakers on cancer research, high
energy physics, and CAD/CAM. They also plan on
having speakers on self-defense and color analysis. If
you wish to know more about SWE or any of their
activities, stop by the SWE office in 125 Benedum.

Co-op

There is something new in Benedum. The
Engineering School is starting a Cooperative Education
Program. This program involves having the student
work for a company for three terms during their junior and

 

senior years. This means that it will take four and a half
years to graduate instead of the usual four.
The criteria for participation in the program is a

minimum QPA of 2.5. Approximately twenty
companies will begin the program with the University of
Pittsburgh. This means that the positions will be limited,
so there will be competition. The program is open to all
engineering disciplines. For more information contact
Lori Shuff in room 749 BEH.

Benedum Tours

Recently tours of Benedum Engineering Hall
began. This is a new program, conducted by
engineering students, for students interested in
engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. All
departments as well as many of the undergraduate labs
are covered in the tours. If you are interested in
becoming a tour guide, please stop by 749 BEH and
sign—up.

Engineer's Week Happenings

This year's theme for Engineer's Week is Movies .
The departments have chosen the following movies:

Chem E — Ghostbusters
ME - Wizard of Oz
EE —Stripes

Fresh E —Animal House
Civil -Frankenstein
Miners —Pale Rider

IE —Blues Brothers
MSE -King Kong

\The events are scheduled as follows:

Monday, March 16: Blood Drive

Benedum, or attend an Engineers’ Week Planning
Committee (EWPC) meeting on Wednesday at noon.

 

"Printergate" Scandal

University of Pittsburgh President Wesley Posvar
has been accused of controversial dealings with Iran.
The administration has been charged with selling at least
one Epson model FX-85 dot-matrix printer to the Iranian
government.

The money received from the deal has allegedly
been used to renovate Wesley Posvar's Bicentennial
Cabin ("Posvar's Folly"), which is located next to the
Cathedral of Learning.

President Posvar declined to comment as to
whether he had any previous knowledge of these
dealings. He did, however, say that if such dealings are
actually taking place, he would see to it that the money
go to a worthwhile cause, such as replacing all of the
Bicentennial signs along Forbes and Fifth Avenues with
new signs that say "Pitt - 201 years old."

In related news, Pitt investment chairman Ivan
Boesky has publicly announced that he will lead a formal
investigation into the Iran printer scandal. (Dave Kadylak)

Cathedral Remodeling

A budget of $1.7 million has been approved for
reconstruction of the Cathedral of Learning's south face.
The constmction is scheduled to begin in May of 1987.
When asked why the reconstruction was needed,
Posvar's reply was, "The windows on the sixth through
eighth floors of the Cathedral are not lined up correctly to
form the number 'one'." For those of you who are
unsure of what he is talking about, the University has
formed the number 200 on the south face of the
Cathedral, which is symbolic of the University's 200th
year. Through the planned reconstruction, the
University will be able to form 201 on the south face next
year, symbolic of the University's 201 st year. (D. Kadylak)

Benedum Going Downhill

The School of Engineering has issued requests to
several contractors for proposals to stop Benedum Hall
from sliding down the hill. Ever since it was constructed,
Benedum Hall has been slowly, inexorably sliding
towards the Litchfield Towers. According to one
University official, who asked not to be identified, a
position on Fifth Avenue, across from the Towers, would
be highly desirable for the engineering school.
However, another building, the Frick School, stands in
the way of Benedum Hall, so the motion must be
stopped. Unofficial proposals for relocating the Frick
School have also been submitted to the University.
Although the University has only taken action on this
problem recently, a poll conducted by Skyscraper
Engineer shows that students have known for years that
Benedum is going downhill. (S. Gupta)

Cathedral Goes Disco

(l.O.U.-INTERNATIONAL) Uninformed sources
reported today that, in a brash move to reduce the
university debt, the Cathedral of Learning will be
transformed into a New York-style nightclub. The
decision was reached by anonymous officials who
declined to make a statement. Rumors have circulated
that the University plans to "take some of the business
away from the Oakland bars." The University has also
considered the possibility of franchising the new
‘CATHEDRAL OF DANCE‘ concept to other schools in
an effort to increase revenue. Plans for an illuminated
neon sign and GO—GO girls have not been confirmed to
date. Other spurious sources reported that student
demonstrators plan to erect lighted dance floors with
mirrored disco balls on the Student Union lawn in
protest. (Michael Beiriger)

WPTS Overrun by Terrorists

This past Tuesday, Pitt's radio station, WPTS, was
taken over by a number of radical terrorist chickens,
brandishing what appeared to be Model I phasers and
antipersonnel insertives. The chickens are demanding
full control of programming of the station, and claim they
will make every high—level administrative official in the
University leave for other institutions it their demand is
not met. SGB president Phil Moyer said that student
apathy was at the root of the problem. Undergraduate

response to both the takeover of the station and the '

SGB has been minimal. President Posvar was quoted as
saying to the Campus Police, "Do whatever you have to,
but... don't hurt the chickens." (M. Rickard)

Cafeteria Milk To Be Investigated

A group of resident students submitted a petition to
the Towers Cafeteria this week, requesting that the
contents of its 2% lowfat milk be analyzed and posted on
the milk dispensers. Says lmpresos de Muestras, the
group's spokesperson, "Sure, they tell us it's two
percent lowfat milk, but what's the other ninety—eight?"
Cafeteria officials have declined comment, but a source
on the cafeteria staff, when asked if there was any
difference between the two—percent milk and regular,
perfectly harmless milk, said, "Of course there's a
difference!" and reported that two possible ingredients
were the cafeteria's pork and fried fish. A preliminary
Skyscraper analysis of the milk has detected traces of
boat—form cyclohexane, a sterile isotonic solution
containing a borate buffer system and sodium chloride,
sodium citrate (to aid smoothness), sorbic acid
(preservative), and riboflavin. De Muestras is currently
having the milk analyzed by a third-party laboratory, and
urges all residents to avoid this mystery milk until the
complete list of ingredients is known. (M. Rickard)

by Jim Liszewski

How long will it take for us to realize that
conservationists, ecologists, and other naturalists really
do have some points worth listening to and acting on?
I'm not trying to tell people to "wake up and smell the
coffee," but maybe just trying to nudge them a bit. Its
scary: eventually, most likely in our lifetimes, we're going
to feel the pressure of running out of vital natural
resources.

For some unknown reason, I picked up a book
recently. That's surprising enough in itself, but what's
more is that the title of the book was The Qeneervetien
Alternative. It was written in 1974 (keep that in mind) by a
man by the name of Raymond F. Dasman. Well, Ray is
your typical conservationist, and I tend not to listen to
people like him. If their ideas on saving the Earth ever
come true, we'd all be eating Grapenuts and living in a
forest, bathing in a lake, and, of course, "being as one
with nature." But leafing through the pages of the book,
I found that Mr. Dasman had dug up some interesting
and startling statistics.

He compiled these from different sources and
admitted himself that a high degree of accuracy was not
always present. I'm talking about actual figures on how
many years we can last using resources such as
petroleum, gas, gold, etc.. The numbers are, of course,
projections, estimates and even guesses. Its very
difficult to know how much the Earth holds, since there
are new deposits being discovered all the time, and to
know how fast we use these resources, because rates of
consumption change frequently. By juggling different
figures of rates and supplies from the U.S. Bureau of
Mines, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
arrived at some data which they published in a 1972
book Ratee ef Qrewth, giving ranges from 2001 A.D. to
2020 A.D. to exhaust our petroleum supply. Geologists
Preston Cloval and M. King Hubbart in 1969, Han

 

16

Landsberg in 1964, and economist Eugene Ayres in
1956, all put forth work indicating the decline and ending
of U.S. petroleum production somewhere from 1980 to
2000 A.D. Now, honestly, these are probably the most
pessimistic and outdated numbers available (figures on
how many years of supply are actually left are hard to
find), but even so, the future is really looking bleak.

One of the biggest problems that I see here is that
the only people ready with answers to these problems
say "go back to nature." That's impossible. There is no
way that society will go backwards. It's not human nature.
But there are answers. Before we can find them,
however, we have to admit that there is a problem first.
Then we can face it, and act on it.

There are always alternatives. I won't go into all of
our choices here, but please, people, be prepared for
some major changes in our lifetime. Not being a psychic,
an expert, or pessimist, I won't try to paint a picture of our
future. But things will change in our lifetimes, that is a

fact. Think for a minute on how many changes have
occurred just since your mom and dad have been alive.
Society's actions, major wars, racial tensions, and
incredible technological developments have all affected
our lives. We cannot expect to predict what will happen
in the future, but we do have a responsibility to accept
what changes are necessary, even though we don't
always realize it.

Sometimes (for myself, at least), very little time is
spent thinking about the world beyond our immediate
surroundings. Living on campus, I tend to lose track of
everything except school. Seriously, I've given very little
thought lately about international and national problems,
or even sports and weather for that matter. Now, I don't
assume that everyone who goes to school here is

isolated, but I doubt that there is any growing concern
about watching the evening news. Along the same
lines, the world we live in has the ability to block out our
concerns for the future. In a day to day society like ours
there is a great temptation to spend money when we get
our paycheck, to drive a lot when we get our gas tank
filled, or to eat a lot while there's food in the fridge. But
remember, just as end of the month will come and we'll
eventually have to go to the supermarket, supplies that
mother nature has given us are also going to run out.
Supply can't keep up with the demand.

I wonder what would happen if it gets out of hand.
Think about this, because when something important is
taken away from any system (a building, a human being,

17

an environment, etc.), destruction is always near.

So, what is it in our world today that we depend
upon? Of course there's food, shelter, and freedom.
But in our supposedly sophisticated world today, we
depend upon something else so very much, even
though its a thing that is not dependable at all: energy.
We need it. If we are to advance more, we need more.
But unfortunately, many of our methods of tapping
energy will not last forever. In fact, they are going to last
for less time than we think. In fact, less than our lifetimes.

No lights, no heat, no computers, no transportation,
no construction, no manufacturing, no communication,
no advancement, no control, no future, no life...no way
out.

Into The Metal
Zone

mind is in. Or you could tune to a station on the
center of the dial, 98.5 FM WPTS, and hear
heavy metal music to unwind your fact—knotted
brain.

Heavy metal at midnight. Hardly status quo,
unless your idea of status quo is a radio show
that plays the metal no other station will touch,
such as Megadeath, Metallica, Omen , Slayer,
or Metal Church . A show where you can hear
acoustic along with electric guitar, "thrash"
along with "inspirational", and nationally known
bands along with local metal bands such as Iron
Cross and Dreamdeath. In short, anything that
could conceivably be classified as heavy metal,
along with interviews with the heavy metal
bands, requests from the radio audience, and
even dedications. The most unusual thing
about the show, though, is that it is run by Tony
Flaskos, a sophomore electrical engineering
student here at the University of Pittsburgh, and
Eric Salinger, also a student at Pitt.

How did Flaskos climb to such a unique
position? He first became interested in radio
when he came to the WPTS radio booth at the
University activities fair. ''It seemed real
interesting." says Tony, "You're curious. You
hear them on the radio, but you don't know what

Tony Flaskos is the disk-iockey for WPTS’ midnight they do. lwas wondering what it would be like to
Heavy Metal show. be a DJ."

18

He originally signed on to the production
department, where he helped select records for play by
the station, tabulated requests that came on each song
played, and calculated the station's most popular songs.
This, as he said, "put his foot in the door", enabling him
to undergo the semester long training program to
become a DJ at the station. The program consists of
training with a group, learning to use turntables, 8-tracks,
reel to reel, compact discs and other audio media. "They
show you how everything's mixed, what you're
supposed to do -- and what you're not supposed to do.
You basically practice all. That's all it is."

At the end of the term, trainees, including Flaskos,
were tested by doing a hypothetical situation in which
the prospective DJ says "Hi, I'm [name of trainee], and
you're listening to WPTS", and hitting a turntable using
the control board. If the trainee passed the test, the
song is played on the utterance of the letters WPTS, with
the switch hit when the "T" is said. This isn't difficult
unless you consider that there are a lot of switches on a
control board, and that what the trainee presses may be
made inoperative by the pressing of the tester's switch,
forcing the DJ to switch to another machine -— quickly.
Tony's experience was a typical example. "They turned
one of the turntables and one of the 8-tracks off. When I
said 'WPT', I hit it and didn't hear anything. So I quickly
hit the other turntable, which had the next song, which
was good."

After passing the test, he was given a shift on 6:00
to 9:00 AM Sunday morning for a term. In the fall of this
year, after completing a term as DJ, he asked to do a
heavy metal show. It isn't unusual for a DJ at WPTS, a
college radio station which has a reggae show, a
"Classical Mystery Tour," a new-age music show called
"Attractive Opposites," and even a rap music show
called "The Rap Attack", to ask to do a show featuring
music he/she likes. All the person needs is a sponsor,
such as a specialty record store or promoter with interest
in such a show, and he or she is in business. In this case,
Music City stated that they wanted to do a heavy metal
show and asked for a DJ to do this. "They [WPTS] said,

19

‘oh, then you want Tony."'

Tony then asked Eric Salinger to help him with the
show because "two heads are better than one." For one
thing, this arrangement has helped by creating a division
of airplay in which Eric does the first half—hour and Tony
answers the phone and takes requests, while in the
second half hour Tony takes to the airwaves and Eric
takes requests. This division also helps when they
decide what records to play. Says Tony, "When we
review albums, I won't be blind to some things maybe
he's not. We'll have two opinions of a song, and that has
actually worked out."

Although Tony and Eric have their show at midnight,
they come to the station around 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM.
During this time, they play new records that have been
sent in by the record companies. Companies that send
heavy metal not only include well known labels, such as
Atlantic, Columbia-CBS records, Warner records, and
Capitol-EMI, but also specialty labels, such as Combat
and Metalblade records, as well as their hardcore
specialty subsidiary labels, Combat-Core and Death
records. The selection routine is about like this. "We
listen to them. We see what we like, what we don't like,
and say ‘Well, we'll play this tonight. That sounds really
good.‘ if we listen to something at home we like, we play
that too. We decide group then and there [at the
station]. Then, in the studio we throw something on real
quick. Whatever song will fit in good so it's consistent,
and the whole show sounds good."

Tony also tries to get at least one or two local bands
a week on the show. "One of the main goals of the show
is to try to build a metal scene," says Flaskos, who
describes the scene presently as "dead." "People aren't
really concerned with the local metal scene. They're
oblivious to the fact that all the Iron Maidens, Metallicas,
Dios, and Metal Churches all had to come from
somewhere. They were local bands somewhere, and
they got the local support they needed to get to where
they are, and I'm sure the people from those areas are
very proud of the fact that those individual bands are
from their hometown, which is something to think about."

As an example, he talks about the local band Iron
Cross, which has become successful enough to have
records sold world—wide. "Believe it or not , they're very
big overseas , in France, LA, and places other than
Pittsburgh." Yet, about 100 people showed when the
band played here, "a good showing, but not as
enthusiastic as others are to hear them." In fact, he
states that local bands now have a better chance outside
the city than they do here in Pittsburgh.

"What I'm trying to do is, basically help those bands
out and help out the whole scene in general, including
club owners, bands, and studios [such as Gambit, 33 1/3
productions, and Zapple records.]. The local bands are
being played on the air, and this gives people more
incentive to record here, and you're not going to record
800 miles from here. You'll record here, because
chances are you can't afford it, and Gambit productions is
local and inexpensive. You'll go and record there, and
help him out. Then I play the tape on the air, the clubs

have a show, and they [the audience] will go ‘wow,
Doomwatch and Dreamdeath are opening for
Megadeath. I'll go see that because those bands played
on the air and I liked it’, and that's how it starts out."

Tony also interviews bands for the show, and has
talked not only with local bands, but with nationally
known band as such as Megadeath and Iron Cross. He is
able to interview these bands because, as he puts it,
"the attitudes of the people in hardcore and heavier
bands are more laid back. They don't have an image that
they have to uphold. Like, if you go to a Motley Crue
concert, the people walkin' around, like, they're great
because they're Motley Crue and you're not, it's that
simple. These bands, they're down to earth. When the
opening acts are playing, the bands are right there with
you , sitting around and talking with you, having a beer.
They're more like me and you."

It is also a part of doing the show that he likes best. ''I
just love doing it. I like meeting people in bands. It's
contact that's basically what it is. I play bass, and have for
several years, and it's always good to have contacts in
case you feel like changing your lifestyle."

Having such an interest in these bands, it is not
surprising that Tony holds a dim view of the PMRC
[Parent Music Resource Center] and other "music
censorship" groups. What was surprising was his
readiness to vocalize his thoughts. "They're saying that
people kill people because the lyrics are bad. That's
almost as good as saying that guns kill people. Guns
don't kill people, people kill people. If a person is going
to kill someone, he's going to do it wether or not he
listens to a heavy metal show, listens to Metallica's "Kill
Them All'' album, reads a book, or gets angry at professor
forfailing him on an exam."

He feels that the responsibility for raising children
and setting them straight on life, having
fun, and the necessary limits and
responsibilities rests with the parents,
not the bands or the record companies,
as the PMRC would have us believe.
"They're saying our kids are
irresponsible and it's up to you [the
bands] to take care of that. No, it's not
up to me and whoever else is playing
heavy metal. They're not responsible for
your children, first of all. The people
responsible for your children are—— you...
What they're saying is it's not my fault my
child is messed up, it's yourfault."

Despite the "evils of heavy metal"
claimed by the PMRC and many
fundamentalists, Tony is quite able to
balance his interests, including the
show, and his schoolwork. He feels that
it you're dedicated and hard working,
you can achieve anything, regardless of
the juggling act. "if you're going to take
on extra responsibilities, you have to be
responsible for yourself, to make sure
you maintain your standards. I'm doing

much better this term than I was last term. Last term I
didn't have as many activities either. It's all discipline. It's
all up to you. I mean, you can't go copping out and
saying ‘Oh, I messed up. I failed three exams this term,
dad, because I have a heavy metal show.‘ I don't think
so. Doesn't sound cool to me."

In terms of audience, the show isn't doing so badly
either. It gets an average of twenty—five calls during the
show, or about a call every two minutes. For the small
Pittsburgh area that WPTS transmits to, this would seem
to indicate a generally positive response forthe show.

If Tony and Eric have anything to do with it, it may
not be too long before a viable metal scene becomes a
reality, and more students tune into... the metal zone.

TAU BETA Pl HONOR SOCIETY ERECTS
"BENT" ON BENEDUM PLAZA

The Pennsylvania Lambda Chapter of the Tau Beta
Pi Association recently erected a "Bent" monument on
the Benedum Engineering Hall Plaza (February 11,
1987). The five—and—a-halt foot tall bronze and limestone
structure is the symbol of Tau Beta Pi. Take away the
loop and stem and the monument is of the form of a
bent, the supporting structure structure common to
railroad trestles built in the late 18003. On the
monument are the numerals "1885," the year Tau Beta
Pi was founded, and the letters "Tau Beta Pi." These
characters are of the most ancient Greek form known,
which explains whythey are so unusual.

Tau Beta Pi is the national engineering honor
society, similar to Phi Beta Kappa for the liberal arts and
sciences. Throughout its history over 3,100 members
have been elected from the University of Pittsburgh. In
addition to recognizing outstanding engineers, Tau Beta
Pi fosters a spirit of liberal culture in engineering

colleges. Today's engineer needs _to develop an
appreciation of the economic, humanistic, and social
elements of our culture as well as a desire to contribute
to the society in which we live. The School of
Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh through its
programs, cirricula, and faculty exceeds the high
standards of Tau Beta Pi.

The monument was erected during Pitt's
Bicentennial year to recognize that the University has
provided the Pittsburgh area with one of the nation's
finest Engineering Schools (for the past 132 years) and
will continue to do so in the next 200 years.

Construction
of a
Nuclear Fission
Explosive Device

"I am become death, shatterer of

worlds."

--a passage from Hindu scriptures, uttered by
Robert Oppenheimer
after the Trinity atomic bomb test.

by Matthew B.T0lbert

I was recently surprised as well as disturbed to
realize how simple it would be, in theory, for one with an
undergraduate college education in physics, chemistry
and engineering to construct a fission reaction explosive
device. By just sitting down one afternoon and
reviewing the basic facts about atomic fission reactions,
someone like myself can develop the blueprints that
would describe how to assemble a small-sized nuclear
bomb capable of releasing the same devestating forces
that was witnessed at Trinity in the 19405.

What I am about to present to you in this article is that
blueprint for a nuclear explosive weapon. Why? Won't
terrorists be able to develop the Bomb if such
instructions ever fell into their hands? Fortunately the
answer is no, for knowing how to build the Bomb is not
the major obstacle in actually producing one, as I will
shortly explain. My purpose of publishing the design for
a nuclear explosive weapon is only to demonstrate to
you how relatively easy it would be for a country or
terrorist group to actually build their own Bomb given the
material to do so.

Currently the governments of six nations are known
to have successfully exploded fission weapons and to
probably possess nuclear weapons in their military
arsenals: the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain,
France, China and India. Israel and South Africa are also
suspected of having successfully developed their own
nuclear weapons. To build their weapons, all of these
nations have used the know-how of how to spark an
uncontrollable nuclear fission reaction gained from the
nuclear research efforts of the late 1940s and 1950s.

22

Much of the technical information learned during these
decades has since been declassified and published and
can easily be found in the scientific journals and books of
any research university's physics library, including the
University of Pittsburgh's. So the information needed to
build a nuclear fission explosive device is easily available.
It is the material to build the Bomb, such as a radioactive
element or certain electronic components, that is
extremely difficult to obtain. _

So how does one induce a nuclear fission
explosion? Simple. Compress a heavy radioactive
element such as uranium 235 or, even better, plutonium
239 into what is termed a "critical mass" and you will set
into motion a highly expedient atomic-level chain
reaction that will release the tremendous energy of an
atomic explosion. The whole secret of getting the Bomb
to blow is to make sure that your radioactive element can
reach its critical mass.

Critical mass is defined as being the smallest amount
of fissionable material necessary to sustain a fission chain
reaction. I am using uranium 235 for my nuclear fission
explosive device's radioactive material, since it can be
found in nature and is thus relatively easier to obtain than
other radioactive elements like plutonium 239 which
must be manufactured in nuclear reactors using very
expensive and highly advanced extraction techniques.
The 235 following the word uranium stands for the
number of neutrons and protons found in the uranium
atom's nucleus. The necessary minimum critical mass
needed of uranium 235 to begin an effective fission
chain reaction should be a solid sphere approximately six

to eight centimeters in diameters--about the size of a
baseball.

A fission chain reaction can be compared to the
genesis of an avalanche (see Figure 1). The reaction
starts with just one tree neutron floating through the
baseball-sized sphere of uranium atoms. If this neutron
during its travels impacts with a uranium 235 atom, the
uranium nucleus will probably absorb it, becoming an
unstable oscillating uranium 236 atom that might be
compared to a quivering water drop. If the oscillations are
violent enough, the uranium 236 nucleus will split into
two or more free nuclei in the following typical fission
reaction:

n + U235 --> U236 -->
141 Ba56 + 92Kr36 + 3n + Q

where n is a free neutron and Q is 175 MeV. In this
case the uranium 236 atom split into a barium and a
krypton atom, releasing three free neutrons and energy
in the process. Other fission reactions may lead to other
end products. If the nucleus does not split, the atom will
de—excite itself by releasing gamma radiation, lethal in
large concentrations to all carbon—structured life.

The possibility of the release of gamma radiation or
of the splitting of the nucleus depends on the critical
energy needed by the compound uranium 236 nucleus
to break apart (fission). The critical energy for uranium
236 is 5.3 MeV, which is the binding energy that keeps
all neutrons and protons packed together. Research has
shown that fifteen percent of the time the free neutron
will not introduce the needed 5.3 MeV during its impact
with the uranium 235 atom, and thus the uranium
nucleus will de—excite by releasing only gamma radiation.
The other eighty-five percent of the time the atom will
split apart and release free neutrons, which will travel
through the Bomb's critical mass lump until they hit other
uranium nuclei, possibly inducing more fission reactions
that will eventually release even more free neutrons. In
an extremely short amount of time that verges on being
instantaneous, billions of free neutrons will impact with
billions of uranium 235 nuclei which will release
tremendous amounts of gamma radiation, energy and

free neutrons. Just like an avalanche. One excited
neutron acts just like a pebble thrown at a pile of loose
rocks on the top of a steep mountain. If the pebble is
thrown with enough kinetic energy so that it gets a larger
rock to start moving, well then, the rolling pebble and
rock will hit even more loose rocks which will begin rolling
downward into still more loose rocks and, eventually, you
will witness a full-fledged rock avalanche. Perhaps the
only difference between this avalanche and a fission
chain reaction is that while an avalanche only motivates
thousands of rocks to roll down the mountainside, the
fission chain reaction occurring inside the critical mass
has 2,000,000,000,ooo,ooo,0oo,ooo,ooo (2 x 1024)
uranium atoms undergoing nuclearfission.

How much energy in the form of gamma radiation is
released during a fission chain reaction like the one just
mentioned? Energy released can be calculated by first
precisely measuring the mass of our critical mass sphere
of uranium, which is about 781.25 grams. Then,
calculating the number of uranium 235 atoms in our
sphere (assuming that 200 MeV is released on the
average per fission):

Natoms = 6.02 X1023/235 = 2.56 X1021 uranium
235 atoms per gram

so for781 .25 grams:

781.25 x 2.5ex1o2l = 2x1o24 uranium235
atoms

and the energy released by our fission bomb would
be approximately:

200 MeV/fissioned nucleus x 2x1O94 x 1.6x10'
19 Joules/ev =

6.4 x 1013joules

That is quite a bit of energy! How long does this
chain reaction take to complete? 2 x 1024 uranium 235
atoms splitting in a fission reaction only require about
one millionth of a second. And in the explosion that

follows due to the fission chain reaction not only will
gamma radiation be released but also new smaller atoms
as well as free neutrons moving with enough kinetic
energy to raise temperatures at the center of the former
baseball-sized lump of uranium 235 to reach
10,000,000° F, which is a temperature much greater
than those found on the surfaces of most stars.

Now that we understand the process of how a
nuclear fission chain reaction works, we may begin to
contemplate the question of how one can induce a
single neutron to impact with an uranium 235 nucleus
and start a chain reaction. Three ways are possible. The
first method is documented as being used for the
Hiroshima atomic bomb, and involves two lumps of
uranium 235 separated from one another. A powerful
conventional explosive propels one lump into the other,
creating in the process a critical mass. If this critical mass
can be held together for the necessary one-millionth of a
second, a fission chain reaction will most certainly result.

The second method is simply to bombard a critical
mass with an outside stream of neutrons. Such a device
to produce neutron streams would be very similar to an
ion mass spectrometer (which focuses a stream of
ionized atoms using magnetic fields to a detector), which
are easy to build and use (undergraduate physics majors
enrolled in UHC physics 77 use such ion spectrometers
for lab experiments). Even better, commercial ion mass
spectrometers the size of a large fire extinguisher
canister can be easily purchased for a few thousand
dollars through the mail and modified to direct and shoot
neutrons at a critical mass.

The third and final method to induce a fission chain
reaction (but I am certain other ways can be thought of) is
to surround a uranium 235 critical mass core with
conventional high explosives (simple TNT could do, as
will powerful plastic explosives, both which are easy and
legal to obtain) and find some way of focusing the
explosives‘ blast inward at the core. This implosion will
compress the uranium 235 core and induce a fission
chain reaction.

24

In Figure 2 I have provided a rough blueprint for a
small atomic weapon. It consists of a uranium 235 core of
10 cm diameter (let us say I stole it from a university
nuclear research lab) completely surrounded by a shell of
plastic explosives obtained from a local construction
company. Inserted in the explosives are approximately
50 fast—action detonators (a new product in the market I
bought for "construction purposes") equally spaced from
each other. These detonators are connected by wires of
precisely equal length to an electronic detonator situated
on the other side of the Bomb's casing that is triggered
by a seven dollar alarm clock (purchased from the local
appliance store) nestled next to it. To insure that the
initial conventional explosives‘ blast is focused inward at
the uranium 235 core, the plastic explosives are
surrounded by a focusing crystal. This blast focusing
shell, possibly made out of a lightweight yet strong
titanium alloy that would resist being initially blown apart
in the conventional explosives‘ explosion, could possibly
consist of parabolic "dimples" that would initially reflect
back the outward blast's energy, like how a reflecting
te|escope's primary mirror would focus incoming starlight
to the eyepiece. For real nuclear weapons, the focusing
Crystal's actual design is a c|osely—guarded secret, so I
can only guess about its actual design.

That's it. in one paragraph I have provided the
instructions on how to construct an atomic bomb that will
produce at least a 10 kiloton blast. Theoretically. Now
this 10 KT nuclear fission weapon may be a sneeze
compared to the 20 megaton hydrogen fusion bombs in
the Soviet Union's weapons arsenal, but to the
determined terrorist who would rather hold an entire city
hostage with an easily-hid atomic bomb than hijacking a
Boeing 747, even a meager 1 KT atomic bomb is nothing
to take lightly.

Thousands of lives and billions of dollars could be
jeopardized with little chance of ever knowing who was
responsible for the bombing, for the Bomb device I have
just described is small enough to be placed in a U-Haul
trailer. How could anyone know that this rental vehicle,

as it is parked across the street from the White House
and its owner is driving off, contains a nuclear fission
explosive device set to detonate in one—half hour that is
the same size as those black cone—shaped human—sized
nuclear warheads placed on the United States’ own
lCBMs?

What damage can a baseball—sized uranium 235 core
nuclear fission bomb do when detonated? In the
following explosion three forms of energy are released:
radiation, blast and heat. The radiation consists of
gamma rays and fast—moving neutrons released during
fission in concentrations lethal for anything living up to a
few miles from ground zero. Radioactive fallout would
threaten to poison anything else up to thousands of
miles away. The blast from the explosion itself would
start a wall of compressed air known as a "blast wave"
moving at of 750 mph. Any buildings up to ten miles
away from ground zero would probably collapse under
the minimum of 5 psi (pounds per square inch) pressure
induced by the wave, and although humans can
withstand up to 200 psi, most will be severely injured or
killed from debris moving faster than the speed of sound
sent flying by the blast. Finally the enormous heat
energy emitted by the nuclear explosion would precede
the blast wave (since thermal radiation travels at the
speed of light, like lightening before the clap of thunder)
starting firestorms and conflagrations as well as causing
severe flash burns. The fires will also immediately
consume any oxygen in the area, suffocating any
survivors who othen/vise be protected in shelters from
the nuclear explosion‘s other effects.

The Trinity test's atomic bomb took America's best
physicists and other scientists three years and over three
billion dollars to develop from scratch. Today the time,
brainpower and financial requirements can be
considerably less. As I have just shown even a Pitt
engineering student cold find it easy to build a nuclear
fission explosive device in his dorm room, given the
material and the motivation. But this is where the entire
difficulty of actually building a real atomic bomb comes in:
obtaining the radioactive element and components
needed to build it.

Plutonium 239, the caviar of radioactive materials for
nuclear weapons, is extremely difficult to obtain since it is
artificially created by bombarding uranium 238 atoms with
neutrons. Few nuclear processing plants exist that are
capable of such element manufacturing. A third world
nation like Libya would need to spend billions and wait
decades before a plant could begin producing plutonium
239. One would find it easier, cheaper and more
expedient to steal the man-made element. Uranium ore,
on the other hand, is a naturally-occurring element that
can be found in practically anyone's backyard, especially
if they live in Utah, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Australia, or
any other area of the earth where large concentrations of
the ore can be discovered with a cheap geiger counter.
The only difficulty with obtaining uranium for a nuclear
fission explosive device is rest in extracting enough of
the necessary uranium 238 from its ore uranium 238.
Since uranium 235 composes only 0.7 percent of the

25

ore, the extraction process is extremely difficult and
hazardous. The ore must be broken down into its
individual atoms and then separated by atomic mass into
uranium 235 and uranium 238. Care must be taken that
this "dust" is never breathed or touched to avoid
radioactive contamination.

A third—wor|d nation like Libya does have another
option to choose from to obtain a radioactive element like
plutonium 239: buy it legally. The United Nations has
passed international laws stating that any country can
obtain all peaceful nuclear technology if it so desires, so
countries like the United States, the Soviet Union or
France can sell plutonium 239 or uranium 235 to, say,
Pakistan that country wants to build a nuclear power plant
or conduct peaceful nuclear research. If purchased
plutonium 239 is secretly diverted into atomic weapons,
nothing can really be done to prevent it. As for the
terrorist organization which could not, of course, buy
plutonium 239 legally, perhaps they might attempt to
steal the element or perhaps the entire weapon itself
from one of the six nuclear powers‘ stockpiles.

Another technological problem that is holding up
other nations’ production of nuclear weapons is their
developing the fuses for setting off the explosive
material surrounding the uranium 235 or plutonium 239
critical mass core. Super-fast detonators are required to
exactly set off all sides of the conventional explosives
shell with time differences of only millionths of a second.
Supposedly countries like Pakistan have not been able
to successfully build a nuclear fission explosive device
because they have not yet developed such fuses. Still
another problem to overcome would be the design and
construction of the focusing crystal, and probably more
technological difficulties need to be overcome.

With the rapid growth of available published
research, radioactive materials and technology, plus the
growing numbers of both domestic and foreign students
studying at the universities and research centers of the
six nuclear power nations, nearly every nation on this
globe could in a few decades time with effort, money and
determination possess their own nuclear weapons—-
either built by themselves or bought or stolen. And with
this proliferation will come international problems never
faced before. How will we be able to prohibit open-air
tests if Third World nations refuse to follow the Limited
Test Ban Treaty, releasing radioactive fallout into the air?

How will the superpowers react if, say, lraq suddenly
possesses nuclear weapons and decides to employ
them against Iranian cities? What if a nuclear weapon falls
into the hands of a fanatic like Qaddafi? How will America
or the Soviet Union react against Qaddafi if he threatens
to use his nuclear weapons against European cities or
American overseas bases? And what if a terrorist
organization holds a city like Pittsburgh hostage with a
small yet deadly 1 KT atomic bomb? Will we concede to
the terrorist's demands? What other options would we
have?

answers to such questions, it is now. Already Israel is
strongly suspected of hoarding its own arsenal of
untested nuclear weapons, and nations like Pakistan
and Iraq are close to having their own too. The
superpowers should at least know how to cooperate
in reacting appropriately against any nation or terrorist
using or threatening to use a nuclear weapon, least
international tensions would themselves explode into
an all out nuclear confrontation between the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R. leading up to the dreaded thought of
the Third, and final, World War. This possibility in itself
is enough reason for the superpowers to also start
pushing harder to negotiate reductions in their
nuclear arsenals, which would relieve the tensions of
nuclear attack that have haunted us for the past four
decades. The spread of nuclear technology,
especially material that can be easily be stolen, should
be re-examined and perhaps slowed by being more
stringently controlled and protected. And naturally
we must all work towards achieving global peace and
stability for all nations, for with such international
harmony will the fear of the Bomb be diminished with
the necessity of its use.

FLYING THE DIGITAL SKIES

by Sanjiv Gupta

The rise of digital electronics has created a
revolution in the aerospace industry. Through the
application of digital aviation electronics ("avionics"),
today's aircraft demand lower pilot workloads, are easier
to maintain, cheaper to operate, and perform better than
earliergenerations of aircraft.

Although many of the multitudes of complex
systems aboard modern aircraft have been affected by
digital avionics, the most astounding and visible changes
have occurred in two areas: flight control and cockpit
display technology. This article will offer a brief glimpse at
the state-of-the-art in aerospace electronics by
examining digital flight controls and cockpit displays.

K in Thin n r n r I

If you ask someone what the most essential parts of
a jet airliner are, they will most likely mention such things
as the wings, engines and fuselage. They may not,
however, think of mentioning the control system. Yet,
every airplane that takes to the air (except, perhaps,
paper airplanes) must have some system which allows its
flight path to be controlled. One of the most important

Fig. 1: USAF/NASA/USN General Dynamics F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration aircraft

milestones along the road to developing the first heavier-
than—air, winged flying machine was the invention of a
suitable way to control the device as it flew.

Almost every conventional airplane in existence
today is guided through the air by deflecting control
surfaces, such as ailerons, rudders and elevators, into
the airstream. The pilot's controls in the cockpit must
somehow be linked to the control surfaces, and the
overall system is collectively referred to as the plane's
flight control system.

In order to see what digital electronics have to do
with flight control, one simply has to examine the basic
types of flight control systems in operation aboard
modern aircraft. The remarkable advantages of a digital
electronic control system will be readily apparent. Below,
the major classes of control linkage between the pilot
and the flight surfaces are explained:

Mechanical Linkages - the pilot's cockpit controls are
connected to the aircraft's control surfaces directly,
through levers, cables and other mechanical devices.
This was the method used on the very first airplanes, and

 

/WM»/xx/bf g

. ; -s

is still the predominant means of control linkage on light
aircraft where small control forces are required due to low
airspeed and maneuverabilty. The "feel" of the control
system is perfectly natural, because the pilot is actually in
direct mechanical contact with the control surfaces. A
natural feel is desirable because it lets the pilot know how
the airplane is responding to his flying. For example, if
the pilot lets the airspeed drop too low, he will feel the
sluggishness of the plane's response as it begins to stall.

Assisted Mechanical Linkage - the pilot's control
inputs are amplified by a hydraulic system or electric
motors, but are othen/vise unaltered. Such a system is
useful on any aircraft where the control forces necessary
to deflect the surfaces are too large for the pilot to exert
manually. Most large aircraft and high performance
military aircraft in operation today use assisted
mechanical control systems. The feel approximates a
natural feel, but is "toned down" as a result of the control
amplification. By varying the degree of assistance
offered by the system, it can be made to feel "heavy"
(large control forces necessary), or "light."

Analog Fly-By-Wire (FBW) - control inputs are
converted into electrical impulses and routed through
wires to servo-actuators which deflect the control
surfaces. The method of control input is arbitrary (no
mechanical motion is required to generate an electrical
impulse), and any "feel" that such a system may have is
totally artificial. The first operational use of FBW was the
Air Force's F-16 fighter, which originally had no feel at all.
Instead of a control stick, the prototype F-16s had a force
sensing side-console mounted control handle (known as
a "side-stick controller"). "Force sensing" means that it is
sensitive to the amount of pressure applied by the pilot,
but does not move (on production F-16s both the stick
and rudder pedals move slightly for purely psychological
reasons: F-16 test pilots complained that the lack of

movement was somewhat disturbing). A FBW system
can amplify, shape or limit the control inputs by filtering
before passing them to the servos. For example, if an F-
16 is pulling 9 g's (the maximum allowable structural load
factor for the airframe), and pilot's control input calls for a
tighter turn radius, the FBW system will reject the
command in order to protect the airframe. Analog FBW,
although more sophisticated than the mechanical
systems described above, has already been made
largely obsolete by digital FBW.

Digital Fly—By—Wire (DFBW)- exactly the same as
analog FBW, except the control inputs pass through a
digital computer instead of analog filters. Thus, a DFBW
system has the added flexibility of being programmable.
Control laws (equations which use the pilot's input and
other variables to determine how to modify the signals
going to the servos) are not hard-wired into the electrical
circuits used to implement them, as in analog FBW, but
instead are programmed in software. As a result, the
entire character of the flight control system can be
modified by simply reprogramming it. For example, the
Navy's F-18, which was the first operational aircraft with
DFBW, receives periodic software upgrades from the
manufacturer which give it improved flying qualities.
Other aircrafts' flight control systems are doomed to
remain exactly as they are (perhaps even degrading if
they are mechanical systems), unless the entire system
is ripped out and replaced, a very costly and time-
consuming procedure. In addition to being easier to
modify, DFBW is also more versatile and allows designers
to do many things with the airplane that would not
othen/vise be possible. We'll see examples of this
shortly.

Unlike mechanical systems, the fly-by-wire systems
can exert a certain amount of authority in controlling the
aircraft. That is, in addition to simply modifying the pilot's

Fig.2: Pitch, roll and yaw motions of an aircraft
are shown here, along with the major control
surfaces. Inboard of the ailerons, on the
wings of most aircraft, are flaps which are used
for increased lift during takeoff.

control inputs, they can actually add their own control
inputs to the servo signals. There are several reasons
why this might be desirable. For instance, since a
computer control system can "think" and react much
faster than a human can, it may be used to stabilize an
ordinarily unstable aircraft by very rapidly manipulating
the control surfaces whenever the plane begins to
diverge from its flight path. An airplane that has been
made deliberately unstable, and is then stabilized it with
an active flight control system, is said to have Relaxed
Static Stability (RSS). At this point you might very
reasonably ask why anyone would want to do this in the
first place. The answer is very simple: to increase
maneuverability. An ordinary aircraft tends to fly straight
and level if no control surface deflections are occurring.
This means that if the pilot lets go of the control stick (or
control yoke - most high performance aircraft have
control sticks, while civil aircraft tend to have yokes which
resemble a fancy automobile steering wheel) the airplane
will not tumble wildly from the sky, but will simply continue
on its present course. Unfortunately, whenever the pilot
wishes to execute a maneuver, such as a turn, he is
forcing the plane to deviate from its natural tendencies,
resulting in a slow response. An unstable airplane wants
to deviate from its current flight path, so it will respond to
any such control input much faster. RSS is particularly
useful on high performance military aircraft, where quick
response can mean the difference between life and
death, and, intact, the only operational aircraft today with
RSS are all fighters. The F-16 pioneered the use of RSS
in an operational aircraft. The Airbus lndustrie A320
passenger airliner, currently undergoing final
development and testing, will be the first commercial
jetliner in service to have FBW and RSS.

The most sophisticated type of flight control
systems available today are referred to as "full—authority"
FBW systems. in a full authority system, the pilot is not in
control of the aircraft's flight control surfaces. He merely
tells the aircraft what he wants it to do, and its computers
figure out how to accomplish the given task. The Space
Shuttle and the X-29 Fon/vard Swept Wing Demonstrator
both have full authority systems. By using such a
system, an aircraft can be made to execute maneuvers
that would normally cause it to lose control, or simply be
impossible due to amount of control input necessary. All
full authority systems are digital.

An ordinary aircraft has three types of control
surfaces that are used for maneuvering. For motion
about the roll axis (see fig. 2), the plane has ailerons.
There is normally one aileron on each wingtip, and its
position is controlled by side-to-side deflections of the

control stick, or turning of the control yoke. The ailerons

move differentially (when one goes up, the other goes
down), resulting in desired rolling motion. Yaw control is
obtained from the vertical stabilizer mounted rudder,
which is deflected by pushing the rudder pedals on the
cockpit floor. Pushing the right rudder pedal causes the
rudder to swing right, yawing the plane to the right.
Finally, back-to-front movements of the stick or yoke
cause the plane to pitch by deflecting the elevators,
located on the horizontal stabilizers. These basic

surfaces, with minor variations, can be found on virtually
every plane flying. Some planes combine the functions
of the elevators and ailerons into one surface called an
"elevon," and many fighter aircraft have, instead of
elevators, all—moving horizontal stabilizers which can
deflect differentially to increase roll response. But
basically, the pilot can control the attitude and position of
his plane by manipulating the three basic surfaces with
the stick and rudder pedals as described above. Every
maneuver, no matter how complicated, boils down to
properly deflecting the ailerons, rudder and elevators in
the necessary combinations and sequence. The X-29,
on the other hand, has five basic control surfaces:
rudder, trailing edge flaps, strake flaps and canard
foreplanes. These four surfaces (whose individual
functions and positions I won't describe here) have to be
deflected in carefully controlled and very precise ways,
as a function of altitude, airspeed, angle—of-attack, and
other parameters, in order to cause the X-29 to execute a
given maneuver. No human being can control such an
aircraft: not only would extra controls be required in the
cockpit, exceeding the number of appendages available
to a person to manipulate them, but no pilot could
possibly think fast enough to calculate what to move and
how. So, the X-29 has a normal stick and rudder, which
the pilot manipulates as if he was performing the
maneuver in an ordinary aircraft, and the full—authority
digital fly-by—wire flight control system figures out how to
translate his control inputs into control surface
deflections. As a result of the tailored control response,
the X-29 is far more maneuverable than a conventional
aircraft. Such specialized control surface scheduling can
also be used, for example, to minimize fuel consumption
by optimizing the configuration of the aircraft for every
maneuver, thus reducing the engine power necessary.
Another example of a full—authority system can be
found in a specially modified F-16, referred to as the
Advanced Fighter Technology integration (AFTI) F-16,
being used by the Air Force to evaluate future aircraft
technologies (fig.1). The unique feature of the AFTI F-
16 is that it is capable of executing maneuvers that no
other airplane in the world can duplicate. Externally, the
major visible modifications to the AFTI F-16 are two large
fins mounted underneath the air intake, and a dorsal
spine to house the electronics and computers that,
along with the fins, make its aerial wizardry possible.
What it can do, that sets it apart from other aircraft, is fly
using "decoupled modes." This is best explained by first
considering ordinary, coupled, modes of flight. Anyone
who has flown knows that when a plane turns, it also
banks, or that when it climbs, it points its nose up. These
are coupled motions; an ordinary plane can't turn (a yaw
maneuver) without also banking (a roll maneuver). The
AFTI F-16 can. In fact, it has several decoupled flight
modes: turning without banking, climbing or diving with
the nose level, translating from side-to-side without
banking, and pointing the nose to either side without
deviating from its flight path. Without the digital FBW this
would not be possible, because the control inputs

Introduction

The growth of digital audio systems over the past
year has been astounding. Such systems provide a
quality of sound previously unknown. Yet providing
entertainment is not their only possible use. The
information recorded on a disc is in digital format and thus
is ideally suited for use as a high—density storage media.
The advantages and disadvantages of such a system
have already been investigated, and some "CD-ROM"
(compact disc read-only-memory) systems have already
been marketed.

Compact Disc Audio Systems

First I will look at the audio use of this system. Audio
digital disks record a range of over 90 decibels
(compared with 70 decibels on the best LP‘s) with more
recording time on one side than both sides of an analog
LP. They are also virtually immune to the problems of
fingerprints, dust, scratches, and other such things that
plague conventional records. The digital audio unit can
quickly and accurately pinpoint any selection on the disc.
And because the system is digital, only silence, not
static, is heard between selections.

The information is stored on the disc in the form of
pits (from which the laser is scattered) and signal
surfaces. The digital information is represented by a
change from the signal surface to a pit or vice versa (1) or
the lack of such a transition (0). The number of "O"'s
depends on the length of the pit or signal surface on
which they are represented. The laser is focused by a
1.2 mm transparent layer; its diameter, which on the
surface is 0.8 mm, is reduced to 1.7 micrometers. Thus,
any disturbance on the surface smaller than 0.5 mm does
not affect the signal since it is out of focus. Larger
aberrations can be handled later by an error correction

routine. This data is then transformed into analog format
and output to the speakers, headphones, or whatever.

Computer Applications

Since the information is stored in digital format, this
technique seems ideal for computer data storage. The
advantages of such a system include extremely high
storage density, which depending on the format could
be on the order of one gigabyte. Due to the recently
reduced cost of such systems this storage medium is a
very low cost alternative. The disc is physically rugged,
removable, and small enough to be transported easily by
mail. Since their is no head that physically touches the
disc, disc crash, a common problem with magnetic drives,
is eliminated. The applications of CD—ROM would include
text and image storage in many areas of science, the
military, and library service, to name just a few.

CD—ROM has a few disadvantages compared to a
magnetic system. As a ROM device, it can not store user
data nor can it be altered. Thus, it can only supplement,
not replace, magnetic drives. Its speed is also much
slower than a magnetic disc. A lack of a format standard
in storage of data causes additional problems with
compatibility. The error-checking techniques must also
be more accurate than those of an audio disc, since
major glitches can result from a "1" being changed to a
 However, these difficulties are constantly being
researched and developers continue to proceed as if
these problems will be overcome.

Software Design

Software engineers are presented with many
challenges in designing compact disc systems,
including:

o Overcoming a relatively slow rate of data access.

0 Integrating audio, video, and graphics.

o Providing multiuser access to data.

0 Accommodating a lack of standards for CD—ROM
data structures.

0 Updating the CD-ROM database.‘

The first of these problems can be corrected
somewhat by using a better data structure. In a magnetic
disc, the files are placed assuming the possibility of their
being expanded or othenivise altered; with a CD-ROM,
this possibility is not a consideration. Thus, a much
simpler data structure requiring a minimum of head
motion can be utilized.

Creation of a specification for interactive audio and
video application on CD-ROM is being researched. As of
February 24, 1986, the plan announced by Sony and
Phillips tentatively included a CD—l ("CD Interactive
Media") based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor.
But before such an interactive media is marketed the
only way to have such a system is to use an additional
remote CD audio or video disc player or to digitize printed
images or sound sequences (a somewhat inferior
approach).

Digital audio compact discs
being manufactured. These
CD's have just been pressed
using a new technique
developed by General Electric
which reduces optical
variations in discs to a uniform
low level, resulting in
enhanced disc performance.
Despite strict quality-control at
commercial CD plants the reject
rateshave been unacceptably
high. This new technique may
improve yields. These
engineers, wearing clean-room
garments, are inspecting the
discs prior to shipping. (photo

Because of the slow movement of the CD—ROM
pickup head, CD- ROM is a poor alternative for multiuser
systems. The pickup head is moved often as data is
accessed by the various users and thus the simple data
structure loses its advantage. One solution to this
problem would be to place several CD-ROM drives under
the control of a computer which would read user
requests and optimize the data retrieval.

Although software standards have already been
proposed, none as yet has emerged as dominant. Their
are in fact arguments against standardizing data
structures now, including the fact that some companies
want to protect their data from piracy by encoding their
indexes and data, and that it may be foolish since we
really do not know what type of information we may be
storing in the future. It is possible to discard presently
the need for a standard format by storing the format in a
disc header and allowing the computer to read the data
format in this header.

In order to update a CD~ROM database, the entire
disc must be replaced. Because of the cost, this makes it
practical to replace the disc quarterly, at most. But, since
