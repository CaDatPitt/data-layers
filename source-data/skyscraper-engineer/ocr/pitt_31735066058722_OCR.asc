A MODERN COMPUTING DEVICE

GERALD L. WAGNER, ME, '52

You are sitting in a darkened room. Myriads of
lights are flashing before your eyes. Occasionally,
the flashing stops. The room comes into focus
while in the background a grumbling noise is
audible. The lights begin to dance again.

The situation described above is not the product
of imagination, nor an excerpt from some weird
time-projection story. It is, more accurately. a
description of the ENIAC at work. The ENIAC,
(Electronic Numeric Integrator and Calculator)
is a high-speed computer. The flashing lights are
analogous to all of the thought impulses our brain

brain is rather usual. The particular advantage
is that the computor remains unbiased more con-
sistently and consequently, it is more dependable
than the human brain. When a computor has been
programmed for a particular problem, its devia-
tion, or percent of error, approaches a zero limit,
dependent, of course, upon the care taken in pro-

’ gramming and preparing input data.

The question of making input data available to
the machine was a difficult one. The earliest
mechanical calculators and the smallest desk cal-

culators accepted input data manually, and were ’

programmed manually. Understandably, input to
the high-speed calculating machine, when done
manually, would defeat the purpose of high-speed
design. So, along with. high-speed computation
came the development of the IBM system of com-
putation and accounting with punched cards as
the method of input and output for their calcula-
tors and various other auxiliary machines.

Basically, the punched card has eighty columns.
In each column there are equivalent segments that
correspond to the numbers 0-9, and two additional
zone punches, 11 and 12. The correlation between
the card and the machine is this: if a hole is
punched in the equivalent space corresponding
to the number 3 on the card, an electrical circuit
is completed when the card passes between a roller
and a brush, this circuit being made at a definite
mechanical time, (three—time, in this instance,)
relative to the machine. The sensing of the im-
pulse at a definite time makes available some con-
crete method of relaying punched—card informa-
tion into electrical information which, through
programming, can be used to perform definite
predetermined operations.

International Business Machines Corporation
has made available to computing laboratories of
moderate size an electronic calculator based on
punched—card input and output. The calculator,
called the Card-programmed Electronic Calcula-
tor, or the C. P. C., is adaptable to almost any com-
puting situation, and by appropriate control panel
wiring, it can be made to operate satisfactorily
in the most unique situations.

However, there has existed for quite sometime
a need for some general method of computing on
the C. P. C. that could be used in a wide variety
of problems. Several have been developed, and a
description of one of these will give the reader
some idea of how computation is performed by
machine.

To do general purpose arithmetic, the machine
must be able to do the basic arithmetic operations.
The C. P. C., by appropriate control-panel wiring,
can be made to add, subtract, multiply, divide,
and extract square-root. The limitation on how
long it takes to perform the calculation is govern-
ed by the length of time required for the input
card to_pass through the machine. (The actual
calculating time is an electronic dimension and is
usually much faster than the time required to pass
a card through the_machine.) Instruction cards
pass through the machine at the rate of 150 per
minute, meaning that the result of a calculation
can be obtained in about 4/10 of a second.

. So that the machine may know What operation
it is to perform, and upon what factors it is to
operate, means of identification must be develop-
ed. First of all, to distinguish the arithmetic

OCTOBER, 1951

orders, a simple numeric code is used. Addition,
for example, is numeric code 1, subtraction is 2,
multiplication is 3, etc. If the operation instruc-
tion is a 2-punch in the card, the machine will per-
form the subtraction of a factor B from a factor
A to give the result C.

The factors A and B. can be read from the card
by the machine, or they can be called from storage
and their location is given some numerical
units in the machine. To identify the factors in
legend. Thus factor A'may be located in counter
2 and B may be located in counter 3. A and B are
made available for calculation by giving them an
A address and a B respectively. For example, to
do the arithmetic operation A-B-C, and A address
would be the number 72 punched in the instruc-
tion card ; the number 7 orders the counter to read
out, and the number 2 corresponds to counter 2,
Similarly, the B address would be 73. Since the
operation is substraction, its instruction would be
a 2-punch in the card. The result, C, is transferred
to storage by punching an appropriate C address
in the card, also.

In the manner just described, a calculation is
performed by the C.P.C. To solve any given prob-
lem then, where many arithmetic operations are
involved, the programmer must outline his solu-
tion in some logical sequence of these arithmetic
operations. He has, then, programmed a general
solution to the problem. Since the solution is gen-
eral, and the operation sequence is the same, the
problem or equation can then be solved for any
value of the parameter merely by initiating the
calculating sequence with data corresponding to
the value of the parameter under question.

For the solution to some problems of more com-
plex natures, special control panels may be de-
vised. Hence, there have been developed special
methods for calculating functions, interpolating
non-linear functions, etc. These special techniques
are made available to all who are interested in
computation by the cooperative exchange of in-
formation between computing laboratories. An-
other aid for the distribution of computing tech-
niques is the Industrial Computation Seminar
sponsored annually by International Business
Machines Corporation. Here, methods are dis-
cussed, compared, and very often exchanged.

The cooperation and suggestions of various
computing laboratories have prompted many of
the improvements in the design of computors.
Other methods of input are under experiment—
particularly the magnetic tape, which improves
upon punched card input as far as speed and capa-
city are concerned. And methods of increasing the
“memory” or storage of computers are being dis-
covered. Magnetic—drum storage, where ‘one-
thousand, ten-digit numbers can be stored, is _an
example. Tube storage is another example of in-
creasing storage capacity.

Even without these improvements, high-speed
computation and computing devices have made
their impression. The solution of very complex
problems has been put on a simpler, more syste-
matic basis. The designer has an abundance of
data available through computational devices, and
the results are everywhere about us. The jet eng-
ine, gas turbines, synthetic fuels, atomic power,
are examples of design and development that have
been aided by modern computing devices.

o correlate the data properly for vapors con-

densing on a vertical pipe wall, Nusselt’s
empirical equation is used. One of the factors in
this equation, the temperature of the surface on
which the Vapors are condensing, is difficult to
measure accurately since a thermometer placed
against the surface of the pipe wall will not give
the temperature of the surface, but instead, the
temperature of the vapor film surrounding the
pipe. Another common method of measuring pipe
wall temperatures is to make a groove in the pipe
wall 1/32 of an inch deep, insert a thermocouple
in the groove, and then fill up the rest of the
groove with solder. This latter method gives rise
to several errors, however, since the thermo-
couples are not measuring the temperature of the
pipe wall surface but instead are measuring the
temperature of the pipe 1/32 of an inch from the
surface. Furthermore, the solder does not have
the same thermal conductivity as the copper pipe,
and therefore, is likely to give rise to a concentra-
tion of heat in the copper, the metal of higher
thermal conductivity; this yields a “cold spot” in
the solder. In addition, it has been found from
experience that interference with the surface on
which vapors are condensing produces unpredic-
table results when data are taken. Finally, it has
been found that the wires leading from the ther-
mocouples to the outside room will conduct heat
from the thermocouples and thus cool the thermo-
couples below the temperature of the pipe.

To overcome all these difficulties, Dr. J. O.
Jeffery of Cornell University proposed that the
electrical resistance of the copper pipe be mea-
sured by a Kelvin Double Bridge and the tempera-
ture be calculated from the resistance (1). Dr.
Jeffrey’s method was later modified and used by
Baker, et al. (2), (3). _

To use this electrical method, the pipe must be
made of a material which is very pure in the com-
mercial grade, which has a comparatively large
change in resistance with temperature and which
has a known equation for the change in resistance
with temperature. Copper meets all of these re-
quirements. The commercial grade of copper is

10

approximately 99.85‘/( pure and the equation for
the variation of the resistance of copper with
temperature :

Rf= R°(l +0 OO4Il5l t- ooooooneeaa +2)

appears in the literature (4). This equation, un-

~ fortunately, is parabolic in t, and therefore a cali-

bration curve cannot be used since too much data
would have to be taken to establish the exact shape
of the curve. It is much easier to solve the equa-
tion mathematically.

It is possible, then to calculate the average
temperature of the pipe from the above equation
once the resistance of the pipe is known. The re-
sistance of the pipe is found with a Kelvin Double

-Bridge, which will be described later. Referring

to the sketch of the apparatus, the equation for
the Kelvin Double Bridge is:

-E 2-;
x 0 R "'Yl o b
This equation may be simplified by fixing the
Value of Q and b so they are equal and keeping the
variable resistances, P and a, equal to each other,

then the second term of the equation drops out
and the equation becomes: ’

x = Jan

A calibration curve for this equation can be
made easily since, by taking the log of both sides
of the equation, we get an equation of the general
form:

_ y= mm b,
thus:

log X=Ioq P+ logg-

Then by plotting the log of X against the log of
P, we get a straight line.

Since the value of the resistance thus found is
only the average temperature of the pipe, we must
be able to derive from that the temperature of the
outside pipe wall. For a thin walled pipe, with
variations of temperatures around and along the
tube, the measured resistance of the tube gives a
direct measure of its average resistivity and hence
its temperature. After the average temperature

is obtained, the outside surface temperature of
the tube can be calculated from the temperature
drop across the tube, thus:

DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS

All references here are to the sketch of the ap-
paratus. The appartus consists of a generator (G)
rated at 125 volts and 40 amperes connected to a
water colled variable resistance (Re) rated at 40
amperes and 0 to 8.0 ohms. The combination of
the generator with the resistance must be capable
of producing a resulting current of 30 amperes
and a potential difference of 2 to 3 volts acress
the ends of the lines. From the resistance the cur-
rent is carried by a heavy lead wire to the pipe
(X), the temperature of which we wish to mea-
sure, then through a yoke (Y) to a standard re-
sistance (8) of 0.001 ohm, and then back to the
generator by another heavy lead wire. Potential
points. (p) are connected to the test pipe and to

the standard resistance, and wires from these
"potential, points go to a galvanometer (Ga)

through a system of resistances (P. Q. a and b)
to form the Kelvin Double Bridge, as shown in the
sketch. By adjusting the values_ of the variable
resistances in the arms of the Kelvin Double
Bridge until there is nogalvanometer deflection,
the value of the resistance of the test pipe may be
found from the modified Kelvin Double Bridge
equation.

The heavy lead wires used were all No. 6 gage

' copper wire and the wire used in the bridge arms

wasannunciator wire.

The test pipe was a part of a vertical condenser
apparatus which consisted of two concentric cop-
per pipes, a 3 inch pipe and a 3/8 inch pipe. Va-
por generated in a reboiler was introduced tan-
gentially into the annular space between the two
pipes. A rubber stopper, fitted with a thermo-
meter and exit tubes for the potential point wire
and a tap-off for condensate, was fitted over the
inside pipe at the bottom and a similar rubber
stopper, fitted with a thermometer and exit for
the potential point and a vapor exit pipe, was
fitted over the pipe at the top. The vapors, after
leaving the appartus, were condensed in a conven-
tional coil condenser.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The test pipe was heated by allowing steam
from the reboiler to surround the copper pipe.
When the temperatures as read on the thermo-
meters at the top and bottom the condenser were
the same and when steam was coming out of the
top of the column while condensate was coming
out of the bottom. it was assumed that the copper

OCTOBER, 1951

pipe had reached thermal equilibrium with the
steam. The generator was then started and the
variable resistance adjusted to give a current of
30 amperes. The Kelvin Bridge was balanced and
the value of the variable resistance and the tem-
perature of the steam in the condenser were read
and recorded. By adjustment of the vapor outlet
valve, the pressure of the steam and consequently
the temperature of the pipe was varied. Two more
values of the variable resistance and the corres-
ponding temperatures were taken for steam. The
above procedure was repeated for four different
temperatures of methanol and two different tem-
peratures of isopropanol as shown in the recorded
data.

DISCUSSION OF DATA AND RESULTS

The resistance of the copper tube was calculated
by the equation X: RQ/P with a value of 500
ohms for the fixed resistance. The resistances
were balanced daily in a wheatstone bridge to
record variations of the resistances with changes
of room temperature. The value of the fixed re-
sistance (b) changed slightly with changes of
temperature, and this difference was large enough
to produce a considerable change on the variable

Fifty freshmen engineers started off on the
right foot at Pitt by attending freshman
camp September 14 to 16. This group of fifty was
divided into two groups, the blue and the gold, for
the purpose of competition. Six teams competed
in football, softball, basketball, volleyball, swim-
ming, songs and skits and the first place team
gained possession of the freshman camp cup until
next year.

Friday evening the freshmen were introduced
to Pitt. At a rally in the mess hall conducted by
the upperclassmen, the freshmen learned the songs
and cheers of the University. After this meeting
the men retired to their campfires where they
met informally with Professor Ackenheil. This
meeting was a general bull session where the men

got a chance to air their problems. It was at this
meeting that the group spirit began to catch on.

Saturday morning after breakfast the counse-
lors put on a skit to explain the activities of the
University to the freshmen. After this skit, the
competition for the cup resumed, and here the
spirit of competition reached _a feverish pitch. At
each meal the standings were announced, and al-
most every time a new group was on top. The
athletic program ended Saturday afternoon with
a swimming meet.

Saturday evening the competition ended with
the presentation of songs and skits. The blues pre-
sented t-he Kefauver committee investigation for
their skit. For their song the Eight Dreamers
sang “I Had a Dream Dear.” The gold’s skit de-
picted an Indian tribe’s reaction to a political cam-
paign. Their song, “The Battle Hymn Of The
Republic” was sung by the whole group with a
solo by Jim Maloney. Before this meeting broke
up Sam Shapiro struck home with a talk on keep-
ing the spirit gained at freshman camp.

Sunday morning after chapel the men met Dean
Fitterer for an informal talk. At noon the final
standings were announced. These standings found
the Pre-Meds the winners for the third straight
year. The golds were third and the blues tied for
fifth. With the competition among the groups
ended, the men began to forget the group spirit
and pick up the Pitt spirit.

The camp was a success for the engineers. This
group of fifty was the largest number of engin-
eers ever to turn out. Despite the fact that the
golds finished third in the competition they were
first in sports, and undefeated in softball. The
blue’s football team won three straight games
the second day of competition. These men should
help the engineer’s intramural league consider-
ably. Some of these freshmen helped to publish
this magazine; many joined the E. & M. Associa-
tion. If the freshmen who attended camp hold onto
the fine spirit they acquired there, they should
make the next four years the most successful
years ever seen by the Schools of Engineering and
Mines and the University of Pittsburgh.

passed through the process turbines and conden-
sors as this would endanger workers and make
repairs pratically impossible on the moving mach-

a condensor for the mercury and a boiler for the

ELECTROPOLISHING

by Robert V. Siegwart.

lectropolishing is a new method of polishing

stainless steel that has been developed with-
in the last ‘few years. It. is considered to be sup-
plementary to other finishing methods rather
than a replacement and has its best advantages
on surfaces which are broken up by ribs, radii,
protrusions and other interruptions which make
grinding and polishing difficult. It is also useful
for parts too small to be handled by other polish-
ing methods.

Electropolishing is a procedure that is almost
the exact opposite of electroplating. Instead of
plating the part, some metal is removed from it,
but the loss is slight. Metal removed ranges from
0.0002 to 0.001 inches on all exposed surfaces. The
metal displaced is sufficient to take off high spots
and remove signs of discoloration due to resist-
ance welding.

Providing a moderately clean surface is the only
pretreatment necessary for electropolishing. This
may require chemical dips if metalic coatings are
present on the part to be polished, but greases and
oils can be removed by vapor degreasing.

 

In electropolishing the work to be ‘polished acts
as the anode, submerged in an acid electrolyte and
made to respond to a cathode” in the bath. The
cathodes are lead, copper or stainless steel, inthe
farm of wire of strips. They are located about one
inch away from the anode. Metal. is taken from
the part and deposited on ‘the cathode and the re-
sult is a bright and shiny surface on the part. The
relationship 0 fthe cathode to the part, in both

distance and shape, is highly important to the_

success of electropolishing. ‘ .

Electropolishing equipment" is relatively simple,
it consists of a tank, the electrolyte, source of 6 to
12 volte DC power, a method of heating and con-
troling the temperature of the electrolyte, cath-
odes, rinse tanks, holding racks, and simple elec-
tric control equipment.

The time required for electropolishing a piece
depends upon the original‘ finish of the piece, the
shape of the piece, current density and the bath
temperature. The time varies with different pieces
but usually ranges between 2 and 10 minutes.

In some cases, such as electropolishing deep
drawn parts, it is necessary to make cathodes con-
form to the part in order that current density be
uniform over the entire area to be polished.

WHY THE ACF-TALGO TRAIN?

by Frank A. Pitsch

he ACF-Talgo train represents entirely dif-

ferent concepts in railway passenger car
design. Compared with today’s standard stream-
line equipment, the Talgo has floors only eighteen
inches above the rail, is almost four feet less in
overall height and, due to the design and all alumi-
num construction, weighs about seventy-five per
cent less.

The name Talgo is derived from the following
Spanish Words and names: Tren (train), articu-
lado (jointed), ligero (light), Goicoechea (the
inventor) and Oriol (the financial backer of the
project).

To understand properly the development of
Talgo, certain fundamental problems of high
speed train operation must be .considered. First,
speed is restricted by curves; time and again our
present equipment barely achieve top speed only
to have the brakes applied because of a curve.
This presents quite a problem in the east and far
west where nature’s barriers make it economically
ruinous to attempt major track relocations. Sec-
ondly, trains entering curves at high speed have a
tremendous centrifugal force to overcome; there-
fore speed is further restricted by this overturn-
ing tendency. Strangely enough our present equip-
ment is well able to cope with this situation from
the standpoint of safety, however passenger com-

16

fort is not improved by taking curves at safe
speeds. It should be remembered that comfort
speeds are far less than safety speeds. Last, the
construction of present trucks is such that on a
curve the flange on the forward half of the outside
Wheels rub on the rail with a downward force, pro-
ducing a reaction that tends to lift the wheel from
the rail.

The problem of curves will be ever present in
railroading, however the designers of Talgo be-
lieve that their ideas are a sound approach to the
solution of these conditions. This is true because
the - natural forces of -friction and centrifugal
force are either utilized to advantage or eliminat-
ed entirely.

The inherent tendency of railroad Wheels, as
used today, to climb the outside rail may be term-
ed a positive angle of attack. Through a unique
design, employing three point goemetry, the
Wheels of Talgo are actually -led around curves.
Each car has two small wheels at the rear and is
supported at two points in the front by members
engaged in corresponding brackets on the rear of
the forward unit. The actual pulling force is ap-
plied through a coupler at the centerline of the
car. The underframe is very similar to the com.-
mon tractor trailer units on our highways. As a
car enters a curve it is turned inward very slight-

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

1y by the preceding unit which is already into the
curve. In this way the leading edge of the flange
is pulled away from the rail head and the trailing
edge rubs against the rail with an upward force
whose reaction is downward, tending to hold the
car on the rail. Thus a negative angle of attack
has been created, providing greater safety to the
train. It is a fact, however, that there is nothing
to lead the locomotive around the curves. This
problem was overcome by designing a locomotive
with such a low center of gravity that it is well
able to take curves at speeds far in excess of stan-
dard equipment.

The design of standard cars requires that the
body be supported high enough to provide ade-
quate clearance for the wheels under all curvature
conditions. This explains the extreme floor heights
averaging about fifty inches above the rail. The
center of gravity is about five feet, four inches
above the rail and because of this the body tends
to lean outward on curves. This is accented by the
fact that the body weight is centered over the
point where it is transferred to the truck. This
condition may be remedied by superelevating the
outside rail on curves. While this is satisfactory
for high speed service it handicaps slow moving
traffic by imposing as much as fifteen percent
additional drag on the motive power. Thus a com-
promise results in superelevation and imposes
further speed restrictions.

The wheels on Talgo are mounted on stub axles,
U-shaped and non-rotating to maintain proper
gauge. The suspension is carried up the side of the
car to a point approximately the center of gravity
of the body. In this manner, the body is prevented
from swaying out at the top. This adds greater

COLOR TV

resistance to the passengers’ own centrifugal
force and increases the comfort of the ride.
Wheels are rubber sandwich type as used on P.
C. C. cars. While superelevation will still be re-
quired to a degree, present day compromises
should prove adequate.

The design of the car body is such that the
weight of five cars, (four for passengers and one
equipment car) which are the equivalent of a
standard coach is only twenty-five percent that
of present day equipment. The tremendous weight
saving may be attributed to the body design,
which closely approximates that of an airplane
fuselage and the use of aluminum alloys through-
out. Two hugh economies are thus presented.
First, a vast saving of raw materials in a day and
age when savings such as these are of prime im-
portance. Second and of greatest interest to the
railroads, an important reduction in motive power
requirements and its resultant fuel and mainten-
ance economics.

In conclusion, some 5000 miles of operation in
this country have proved the design principles to
be correct. Two sixteen unit trains have been in
operation between Madrid, Spain and the French
Border for almost two years. At this time definite
information is not available as to performance
records, but it is generally known that schedule
times between extreme points have been reduced
by more than three hours. From the experience
gained in this country it is obvious that roadbed
maintenance for a train of this type would be
greatly reduced. Car maintenance would not re-
quire heavy specialized handling equipment and
because of very low unit stress incorporated in
the design, the car life should be greatly extended.

TRANSMISSION METHODS

by Howard G. Ondick

C olor television, a recent development in the
field of Electrical Engineering, is presented
by two different methods.

The first method that I will discuss is technical-
ly known as the field sequential system which is
commonly called the revolving disc method and
is sponsored by the Columbia Broadcasting Sys-
tem. The CBS system is a simple, inexpensive
method, but it has its limitations as to its use.
The CBS system, requires a revolving disc consist-
ing of the primary colors—~green, blue, and red.
This disc revolves in front of your picture tube,
and is synchronized with a revolving disc in the
television studio. When the studio sends out a red
field, the red color on the disc in your home will
be directly in front of the picture tube, and you
see a red image. The revolving disc operates at a
speed that will permit your eyes to see a colored
picture instead of one color at a time. The size of
your screen is limited for two reasons. First, since
one color of the disc has to cover the entire screen
of the picture tube at one instant, any picture tube
larger than 12 inches will require a large revolv-
ing disc that will be both too large to handle and
annoying. Second, if the picture tube is larger
than 12 inches, the image on the screen will tend
to flicker and fringe due to the low frequency
with which the CBS system operates. Flickering
is the appearance of a snowy picture similar to the

OCTOBER, 1951

one you get in your black and white set when it
isn‘t properly adjusted. Fringing is the blurring
of the colored picture around the edges of the
tube. At the approximate cost of fifty dollars,
your present set can be converted to bring in the
CBS colorcasts only in black and white. At the
approximate cost of one hundred dollars, your
present set can be converted to bring in the CBS
colorcasts in color. But once either conversion is
made outright, you will not be able to pick up the
other black and white telecasts.

The second method of telecasting color is tech-
nically named the dot sequential system, and it is
promoted by the Radio Corporation of America.
The RCA system is more complicated and expen-
sive both to the individual owner, and especially

to the television stations, since it operates on ultra-

high frequency. _

In ultra high frequency the frequency must be
held constant and must be kept from drifting or
the image on_ your picture tube will go out of focus
and become blurred. Thus the additional expense
to the telecasting studio in both men and material
enters the picture. RCA states that the owners of
present sets will be able to pick up their telecasts
of color, but they will be seen only in black and
white at no added expense to the owner. If new

EDITOR’S NOTE

“Pitt Students in Industry” is introduced
this month for your consideration as a fea-
ture article. Many of you take summer or
part—time jobs; others would like to know
just what type of work may be had. Here is
an opportunity for you to try your hand at
writing and also share your experiences.
What you encounter in industry is of more
interest to other students than you may real-
ize, so why not write us your experience?

Gene Cowie, your Features Editor, who
spent the summer at Westinghouse Corpora-
tion’s Home Appliance Division in Mansfield,
Ohio, responded to an eleventh-hour appeal
and provided this -issue’s Students in In-
dustry article.

Engineer staff member for details.

hile being produced, refrigerators are con-
stantly being tested and retested. Sometimes
only one refrigerator is selected daily at random

and tested. Other tests must be made on every '

box. Twenty years of service often must be du-
plicated in a few weeks, and the unexpected must
be taken into account.

‘The most important question asked by the en-
gineer relates to performance. Just how good a
refrigerator have you built? The first test along
this line is a no-load test, which involves putting
the refrigerator into a room held at 90°—|—0.5°
farenheit and setting the temperature control to
hold the inside at 38° farenheit. Thermocouples
are suspended inside at seven points and from
these the inside temperature is determined. The
refrigerator is allowed to aperate until all condi-
tions are stabilized, requiring from six to eight
hours. The actual test then begins, lasting at least
twenty-four hours. On and off cycling of the
units. interior temperatures, power consumption
and total running times are recorded. The test is
run again with the control set for temperatures of
about 42° farenheit. The results from both tests
are then plotted so that results for a 40° box may
be read. This is a test on both the efficiency of the
refrigerating unit and the cabinet structure. Com-
petitive models are given this test also.

Next the refrigerating units are removed and
the cabinets are tested by means of a calorimeter
to find out how much heat leaks into the cabinet
in a given amount of time. This is expressed in a
number called the “all-over k factor” which re-
presents BTU per hour per degree temperature
difference (ambient minus box) at a given mean
temperature. In the calorimeter a measured
amount of freon 12 is circulated through a regular

18

GENE o. COW|E,ME,’52

evaporator mounted in the refrigerator in the
regular manner. The temperature of the entering
liquid, the pressure and temperature of the gas
leaving, and flow rate are recorded. This test is
used to evaluate the insulation and the structure
and is important in efforts to further improve the
efficiency of the cabinet, especially where changes
proposed give small percentage savings in the
overall size. An example would be reduction in
insulation wall thickness to give greater useable
volume for given floor space. First, a refrigerator
with thinner walls will take up less room in the
kitchen. Second, a small saving of ten cents on a
piece of insulation is not much on one refrigera-
tor. but when 2000 a day are being produced this
small saving means $50,000 a year more profit.

The next test is the load test. Pint jars of water
are put into the refrigerator in place of food. The
door is opened by a machine twelve times an hour
every other hour for nine hours each day, Monday
through Friday. When the door is opened the cold
air inside the box is displaced by the warm moist
air from the room. This air must be cooled. The
moisture in it is attracted to the coldest place-
the evaporator—and forms frost. The purpose of
the test is to find out how quickly the refrigerator
can cool the load, how much the inside tempera-
tures vary due to opening the door, and how much
the presence of frost will interfere with the opera-
tion of the refrigerator. The room conditions are
90° farenheit and 85% relative humidity and are
much more severe than those usually encountered
in service.

Finally the cabinet is placed in the iron lung.
This is a large air-tight iron box. A vacuum pump
is connected, and the air is drawn out of the box
through a moisture trap submerged in an acetone,

dry ice bath. The water freezes in this trap and
may be weighed to determine how much water
collected in the insulation during the test period
in 85% relative humidity conditions.

Another serious problem is condensation on the
exterior surfaces of. the cabinet. If there is an
easy path for heat to flow from the outside to the
inside, although not great enough to substantially
vary the power consumption, there will still be a
“cold spot” on the outside of the refrigerator that
will bring about condensation similar to that on
the outside of a glass of iced water. Hinge and
latch mounting areas are particularly bad trouble
spots. While the non-load power consumption test
is being run, surface temperatures are taken. If
at any point in a 90 degree room surface tempera-

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

tures below 85° are found, then condensation will
occur under climatic conditions that will be found
in certain areas of the United States and foreign
countries. If found, the structure in this area is
redesigned to provide insulation effect. With such
a specification the box will be safe from sweating
under all but most unusual conditions which will
occur only for very short periods of time.

Since the refrigerating units are hermetically
sealed and lubricated for life, the biggest mechan-
ical problem is the door. Counters were placed on
refrigerators in actual use and the average num-
ber of opening per day (summer and winter counts
vary) was determined. It was found that, for a
life of twenty years the refrigerator will be open-
ed and closed 500,000 times. When the door is
pushed closed it compresses a baloon type gasket
against the box. This causes the door to rebound
against the latch with a force of about 50 pounds.
This places a severe stress on the latch parts and
mountings, and sets up vibrations which may
cause screws all over the door to loosen. It is also
a severe test on the gasket and the hinges. A slam-
ming machine is used to test the door latch. This
machine opens and closes the door about 45 times
a minute, and counts the slams. This is an ac-
celerated test which duplicates in two weeks what
happens in twenty years, and has proved very re-
liable.

So far all tests discussed have been spot checks,
involving usually just one of each model produced
daily. But when refrigerators are assembled at
the rate of two thousand a day there are consid-
erable deviations from the ideal design conditions
necessitating checks on every cabinet. One prob-
lem is making the doors seal properly against the
front face of the cabinet. The test is made by plac-
ing a photo flood lamp inside the cabinet and
noting where the light leaks out from under the
gasket. Adjustment can be made at the latch to
pull the door in tighter, but sometimes the doors
have warped out of shape. Thus they will meet the
cabinet at the top but not at the bottom, or vice
versa. When this happens a wooden mallet is
placed between the cabinet and the door near the

tor from a truck, the driver will lower it off the
tailgate as far as possible, then drop it the rest of
the way. Railroads also provide many jolts and
jars in all directions. The problem is approached
in a scientific way by means of a shock meter,
which contains a weight mounted on rollers be-
tween springs. A linkwork connects the weight to
a recording pen. The pen makes a record on a tape
run at the speed of six inches per hour. This tape
is divided into five zones. Roughly, the zone num-
ber, time two, equals the velocity in miles per hour
at the moment of impact. The recorder measurers
longitudinal and vertical shocks. Longitudinal
shocks for instance occur in railroad yards while
coupling. Vertical shocks are caused by running
over bumps or dropping.

Heavy shocks are simulated on a Conbur tester.
This is a 10° inclined plane with a flat carriage
mounted on it and a rigid stop mounted at the
bottom at a right angle to the inclined plane. The
crated refrigerator is placed on the carriage and
pulled up the incline about one fourth the way.
The carriage is released and the box hits the back-
stop hard enough to Plcoduce a fifth zone shock.
The crate is slammed against each side, then open-
ed and inspected.

A series of small shocks may do more damage
than one or two large shocks. A railroad car is like
any weight mounted on springs—-—once deflected
it will vibrate with a given frequency. If the train
is running at such a speed that the wheels hit the
rail joints at this frequency, or the car has a flat
wheel, the car will bounce considerably. A vibra-
tion tester is used in the lab. It is a platform
mounted at each end on eccentrics. It is run fast
enough to give an acceleration equal to that of
gravity (32 ft./sec. squared). This is indicated
when the crate begins to leave the platform. The
test is run for one hour. These tests are run each
day under specifications set up by the National
Safety Transit Committee. 

When the refrigerator is delivered to the.sa;les

room or to the home, it is in for more rough vtre'at-._
ment. The salesman opens the door, then leans‘ or§_ 
it while pointing out the finer points of the ?r_e‘frig-- 

top and_the door is slammed. against it. This forci- eratm-_ pe0p1e close the door by pu11ing_.2m',th-333.’.

ing the door back into shape. These procedings
have drawn complaints from design engineers,
but they have proved practical thus far.

Another more scientific test that is made on the
assembly line is for door air leak, to see how much
air can leak into the door. This is of interest be-
cause air carries moisture which condenses inside
the door insulation, and water logged insulation
is not very efficient. The test time due to produc-
tion rate is limited to five seconds per door. A
hood is placed over the door and air at the rate of
0.15 cubic feet per hour is admitted. The back
pressure is measured on a manometer, and this
pressure should reach at least 0.2 inches of water
within five seconds.

After a refrigerator is manufactured it must
be crated and shipped. Then a refrigerator comes
in for its worst abuse, and it must be designed for
extreme conditions. No matter how fragile the
crate is marked, in unloading the crated refrigera-

One situation that interferes with the ,operat'lo'n§

of the refrigerator in some homes is improper»
wiring which lowersthe available voltageuln some
places for instance, old mansions have_'f:_een,~:ije.:

ing is often used, resulting in heavy overloading
and large line voltage drops. Thus the refrigerator
is often required to start and run on :a_s: low as
ninety volts. 

If you do manage to build the best refrigerator
ever made, one that will defrost automatically,
will not sweat, will take all sorts of abuse, will
run cheaper and cool faster than any other re-
frigerator on the market, and it is not pleasing
to the eye, it is Worth little. The housewife who
buys it knows nothing of the technicalities behind
a_good refrigerator. It is appearance that sells

The members of the Society of Automo-
tive Engineers this summer managed to
-make two successful and interesting field
trips. The first trip, to the Elliott Company
of Jeannette, gave the boys a look into the
gas turbines we all have heard so much
about. This tour also covered the field of
blowers and turbochargers and the balanc-
ing and machining of this equipment. We
were fortunate to see a test set up showing
two experimental railway type gas turbines
as well as a gas turbine developed for the
U. S. Navy. The second trip took the boys
to Grove City where the manufacture of
large stationary and railway diesels was
observed. This tour covered the machining,
and the foundry and heat treatment pro-
cesses on a large scale. The members of
this semester's group have reason to feel
proud since the SAE have received their

man-mile cup from Detroit this past year.
Because of the short distance from Pitts-
burgh to Akron, Pitt A. S. M. E. hopes to
take a large delegation there to definitely
clinch the cup.

Under the guidance of Professor Mani-

end will surely be accomplished.

also received a challenge to become as out-
standing and progressive as our Pittsburgh
Section of the National Organization. This
challenge will be a great undertaking since
the Pittsburgh section is one of the most
outstanding of the Society of Automotive
Engineers. This fact is very well known by
our members who have had the privilege
of attending the monthly dinner meetings.
Our program committee, headed by Bob
Lawrence, has given, us a good start to-
ward recognition with a trip through the
Fisher Body Plant of General Motors where

twenty-eight members observed the stamp-

ing of Chevrolet bodies. Plans for the fu-

ture include speeches by Mr. R. I. Pigott

of Gulf Research and Development Com-
pany, Dr. McGregor of Dow Corning Fel-
lowship of Mellon Institute, as well as
many interesting movies and speakers to
be announced later.

the most deserving M. E. sophomore, ac-
cording to his fellow students, his record
and the fraternity. The awardee's name is
placed on the plaque displayed on the
second floor of State Hall.

This semester the fraternity expects to
take preliminary steps in inaugurating an
alumni chapter.

Under the guidance of Professor Buck,
who was elected Faculty Advisor after Pro-
fessor Rudoy resigned, the group antici-
pates a most successful semester.

The American Road Builders Association,
open to junior and seniors in civil engin-
eering, has weekly meetings to discuss

' current problems in the highway field.
Speakers will be Paul B. Reinhold, national
president of the A. R. B. A., and other lead-
ing figures in highway work. The chapter
eagerly awaits the national convention to
be held January 21-24 in Houston, Texas.
The placement bureau will be hard at work
again this year in placing civil engineers
in various state highway departments. Sev-
eral social events are planned by the chap-
ter and will be announced later.

Members of the Pitt American Society of
Civil Engineers plan to attend the annual
convention in New York City on October
23-26. Social plans for this fall include at
least one dance and the annual spaghetti
dinner. The seminar program will consist
of movies and talks on the Penn-Lincoln
Parkway by George S. Richardson, and on
Q-flooring by C. K. Hertrick. Plans are be-
ing made to take at least one field trip.

Sigma Gamma Epsilon, a professional
and honorary fraternity, has at present an
active enrollment of fourteen members. The
tenative activities for this fall include a
pledge smoker, fraternity banquet, and
participation in the interfraternity sports
program.

The A. I. I. E. works in coordination with
the Seminar officers to present a program
at each departmental seminar in addition
to their own meetings.

The I. E. Seminar is planning a program
including movies on industry and speakers
on topics of general interest.

During the summer semester the jalopy
was stolen. It was finally traced to the auto
pound where it was sold on auction. Social
activities for the fall semester include the
dance on November 16 and the smoker,
December 14. One of the biggest undertak-
ings this fall will be making some badly
needed repairs on the furniture in the
lounge. The E. & M. Association is now
investigating a system to post a list of free
classrooms in State Hall so that students
can have a place to study between classes.
The Association intends to continue aid
towards the Skyscraper Engineer and to
maintain constant efforts to make the under-
graduate years of every student in Engine-
ering and Mines more worthwhile.

Members of the Pitt AIEE Student branch,
along with members from schools in neigh-
boring states, attended the District 2 AIEE
Student-Counsellor Meeting at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania on October 19-20. The
meeting began Friday morning and ad-
journed at noon Saturday. During this time
there were separate student and counsellor
meetings, luncheon at the University Cafe-
teria, a tour of the Ford Motor Company's
Chester, Pennsylvania plant, and inspection
of the electrical facilities of Moore School
Laboratories of the University of Pennsyl-
vania. At a banquet held in Houston Hall,
the National AIEE President, F. O. McMillan

Sigma Beta Sigma, the Professional En-
gineering Fraternity, has just begun its fall
meetings and plans some very interesting
activities. Though no meetings are held
during the summer months the fraternity
usually holds social events to keep its mem-
bers busy. This past summer the members
attended a picnic at South Park and cruised
up the Monongahela on a motor launch.
The cruise arrangements were made by
Colonel Dodds. To climax the summer acti-
vities, a corn roast and dance was held at
the Hemlocks dance hall in North Park.

With the resumption of classes the Fall

From Engineering Education." This speech
brought an interesting day to a thought-
provoking end.

Saturday morning was devoted to joint
student-counsellor meetings at which find-
ings and suggestions of the separate meet-
ings of the previous day were discussed.
Official adjournment was at noon but ar-
rangements had been made to permit those
who desired to see the Penn-Columbia
game to do so. The Pitt delegation found
the prospects of seeing the closing min-
utes of the Pitt—Notre Dame game in their
own stadium more enticing and,_ with the
help of an early dismissal, streaked for
"Skyscraper U."

COLOR TV TRANSMISSION METHODS
(Continued from page 17)

sets are purchased, giving expense to the indivi-
dual set owner, color television as well as the
black and white programs of other networks can
be seen. The color phenomenom of the RCA sys-
tem is achieved by the use of a new type tube
which has its picture screen dotted with the pri-
mary colors—green, blue, and red.

A summary of the advantages and disadvan-
tages of the two systems will show what the gen-
eral public should be aware of with the coming of
color telecasts. The CBS system is simple and in-
expensive especially to the telecasting stations.
For the CBS system, special adaptations must be
made to the set in order to pick up colorcasting,

and thereafter no other regular black and white
programs can be picked up.

Under the RCA system, present owners will be
able to bring in the colorcast but only in black and
white unless a new set is purchased that will pick
up color television along with black and white
programs of other studios. The CBS system is
limited as to the size of their telecast and limited
also in the further development along their pres-
ent system. The RCA system is practical and un-
limited both in the size of their picture and in the
possibilities of future developments with their
present method of telecasting color.

Color Television is in its infancy, and the Fed-
eral Communications Commission has left the door
open for any new developments and improve-
ments. Color television, in the average home, is at
least two years away.

REINFORCED PLASTICS AS STRUCTURAL MATERIALS

bv Wm. C. Banks

In these days of defense preparation, plant
expansion and high civilian demand, short-
ages of structural materials are inevitable. In the
search for desirable substitutes for metallic ma-
terials, reinforced plastics might well be given
more consideration. Reinforced plastics are poly-
ester resins, usually laminated with fibrous glass,
hemp, or sisal. The reinforced material may either
be cross woven or unidirectional. Glass is the pre-

' ferred material because of its chemical resistance,

strength, moisture resistance and elasticity. Pro-
duction difficulties have been encountered but are
being ironed out and at least four major firms are
now in glass fiber production and twelve are mak-
ing polyester resins.

Development of polyester resins bloomed dur-
ing World War II. By 1945 production was over
six million pounds. It shrank to two million after
hostilities ceased, but by 1950 had rebounded to
eight million pounds per year. With increased de-
mand due to defense activities, production is cer-
tain to continue climbing. At a recent meeting in
Chicago, leaders of the Reinforced Plastics Divi-
sion of the Society of Plastics showed some am-
bitious products, some already proven, others in
the development stage.

At present, emphasis is on the military items.
Since these materials permit radio and radar
beams to transpierce them, they can be used for
radomes, the housing for radar units. These have
been built, ranging in size from small to those the
size of an elephant. Guided missiles of these ma-
terials are able to penetrate a radar screen unde-

CONTINUOUS CASTING

by W. H. C-av

S ince July, 1950, the Nichols Wire and Alumi-
_ num Company of Davenport, Iowa, has been
continuously casting aluminum bars in a process
which makes use of a casting machine designed
and built by Mr. Ilario Properzi of S. P. A., Con-
tinuus, Milan, Italy. After casting, the bars are
then rolled into rod on a 15-stand mill also of
Italian design.

THE CASTING MACHINE
The casting machine consists of two revolving

tected so this seems to be a suitable application.
Boats are another item in production. A_ twenty-
eight foot personnel boat has been subjected to
eighteen months of active duty and has passed_all
tests. Many smaller personnel boats are being
manufactured at present, and under construction
for the Navy is a thirty-six foot landing craft of
steel and reinforced plastic. All sorts of shelters
are coming out of the molders’ plants and more
items are placed on the available list each month.

Now in the development stage, but needing
much more work, are things like landing mats for
planes. So far the upper strength limit of the ma-
terial is a wheel load of 20,000 pounds while the
Army wants it to go up to 80,000. Then there’s the
problem of the high temperature of the jet ex-
haust which melts the mats. Suitable combination
of steel alloys and plastics may yet provide the
answer. Plastic pipes fit into this category t_oo.
Army engineers are looking for a six inch pipe
which would have only one-tenth the weight of
iron and steel. Heat resistance and leakage are
problems yet to be solved. _

These are just a few of the developments in re-
inforced plastic materials. With shortages of ma-
terials and personnel, lack of engineering data
due to the relative newness of the field, prejudice
from designers, understandable timidity from the
military, and pressure from the metal makers, the
path ahead it not strewn with roses for the in-
dustry. But the producers say you can’t laugh _off
eight million pounds a year of reinforced plastics.
They are confident that plastics will take their
place among the engineering materials.

OF ALUMINUM BARS

drum wheels and a steel band. The steel band
passes over the two wheels much the same as a
band saw blade. The blade forms one side of an
equilateral mold cavity cut in a copper casting
which forms the rim of the lower wheel. The cop-
per rim is then bolted to the steel inner wheel or
hub. Circulating water is contained within the hol-
low hub section while the lower wheel itself is
partly immersed in cooling water.

The casting wheel is 36-1/4 in. in diameter and
revolves at a rate of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 rpm when cast-

CONTINUOUS CASTING OF ALUMINUM BARS
(Continued from page 23)

ing. Speed of casting is determined largely by the
size of the pouring spout orifice which in this
case is 3/16 in. in diameter. The pouring spout is
located at the juncture of the lower wheel and
steel band and is fed by a pouring ladle mounted
directly above the casting wheel. The ladle, rough-
ly 22 x 8 x 4 in. deep, is refractory lined and un-
der-fired with a gas flame from one side, the hot
gases preventing metal from freezing in the spout.

One of three 100 KW Ajax induction furnaces
acts as a holding unit and feeds the pouring ladle
through a refractory lined trough. The other two
furnaces feed the holding unit. Three furnaces are
used to permit melting flexibility for small runs
of alloy. The pouring temperature at the two melt-
ing furnaces is maintained at 1275° to 1285° F.
while the holding unit pours at 1220° to 1240° F.,
the temperature at which the metal enters the
wheel mold. There is considerable flexibility in
the furnace operation as the only “must” is that
the pouring ladle on the casting machine be kept
reasonably full.

As the metal is cast in the lower wheel mold
cavity, it solidifies fast and travels with the wheel
to a point halfway up the other side on the band
where a stripping device ejects the section to one
side. The section then loops back in the same gen-
eral direction of the wheel revolution into the
first stand of the mill.

Once the process is started, the operation is
continuous and the section is not broken. The only
scrap regularly encountered is from the beginning
and the end of a run.

The casting machine produces a 7/8 in. tri-
angular section at a speed of 10 to 30 rpm, aver-
aging 1000 lbs. per hour. The triangular section
was selected since it is the simplest shape to ex-
tract from a wheel mold. This shape also lends it-
self well to the subsequent three roll rolling pass
design of the continuous mill.

THE MILL

Each pass of the 15-stand mill consists of a
three-roll cluster, the top roll of which is connect-
ed to the main drive shaft by a chain and sprocket
arrangement, a 50 hp. motor being used to drive
the main drive shaft. Because of this arrange-
ment, all stands run at a set speed which cannot
be varied individually.

The crystalline structure of the cast triangular
section presents three 120° angles of preferential
working allowing the three rolls set at 120° to
work alternately the corners. The even numbered
passes produce a triangular shape and the odd
numbered passes roll a round shape. The cast
structure of the rod disappears after the seventh
pass when rolling 9/32 in. material, resulting in
an exceptionally sound, fine-grained rod. Rod
produced by this method has better mechanical
properties and a better surface finish than rod
produced by conventional methods. ‘

In operation the Properzi process is truly con-
tinuous; hot metal is being constantly poured into
the casting machine, the cast bar is automatically
fed into the rolling mill and the finished rod is
continuously being coiled into one of two receiv-
ers, ready for subsequent cold drawing into con-
sumer wire products.

reveals that no calculated varies by more
than 269% from the average.
CONCLUSION
Laboratory tests have shown that the tempera-
ture of a tube upon which vapors are condensing
can be measured with great accuracy by the Kel-
vin Double Bridge Method. The data contained in
this report should not be treated as conclusive
proof of the extent of the accuracy of this method.
The appartus used was equipped with two fixed
resistances made of different metals, which caus-
ed the readings to be inconsistant with changes
of room teamperature due to thermocouple -effects.
From the information obtained, it appears that
this method warrants careful investigation with
resistances constructed of similar metals.

ATOMIC POWER
(Continued from page 13)

may be lowered to 4.0 to 4.3 mills per kilowatt-
hour. The cost of producing electric power in a
comparable coal-burning power plant is 5 to 6
mills per kilowatt-hour. Although this comparison
is not extremely favorable costwise to the atomic
power station, there are several factors that do
cast a much more favorable light on this method.
In energy liberated, one pound of uranium ore is
equivalent to the burning of _ 1,250 tons of bitu-
minous coal, For the atomic plant only a very

’ small amount of the total cost is due to fuel, while

in the coal burning plants as much as 70% of the
total cost results from fuel. Therefore any in-
crease in fuel prices could greatly increase the
cost of electric power obtained by burning coal,
while the cost of producing electric power atomic-
ally would be practically unchanged. Also, the
atomic plant could operate at more than 50% of
capacity with a very little increase in the cost of
production. Another important consideration is
that the atomic plant need not be located near de-
posits of fuel because of the small quantity of fuel
required. Thus the plants could be located closer
to the load and in this manner transmission costs
would be considerably lowered.

Thus while the economics of the atomic power
plant will enable it to compete with the coal power
plants, the other factors could change conditions
to make it much more economically desirable to
produce electric power atomically.

The third problem is the supply of fissionable
substances in the United States. Contrary to pop-
ular opinion the supply.of these fuels is not as
pressing a problem as is imagined. According to
Professor Clark Goodman of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the supply of cheap, easi-
ly mined atomic fuels in the United States will be
enough to produce electric power at the 1946 rate
in this country for the next 1,000 years. In addi-
tion, there is a supply of more "expensive, less
easily mined fuels which will be sufficient to pro-
duce electric power at the 1946 rate for the next
10,000 years, Also new nuclear reactors have been
developed that “breed” new fissionable substances,
for use in earlier reactors, while undergoing the
fission process themselves. These too will extend
our fuel supplies to a large degree. As the above
figures represent only the reserves in the United
States ‘itself, any access our country can gain to
foreign supplies, will guarantee us an even greater
adequacy of atomic fuels.

As it has been pointed out, it is. technologically
possible, economically desirable, and practical
from a fuel supply standpoint to produce electric
power in the United States from the atomic en-
ergy process. Much is being done to. hasten the
arrival of such production. Last July, the United
States Atomic Energy Commission announced
that it was testing the new breeder-type nuclear
reactor at its plant at Arco, Idaho. In September,
Great Britain announced that it would begin con-
struction of an atomic powered electric station
sometime this year. With world conditions per-
mitting, it may not be very long before you can
turn on the light switch and receive a supply of
atomically produced electric power.

HERBERT J. RASS

 

AYBE that’s a far-fetched way of
putting it—but I am an engineer
(Marquette 1941, Electrical Engineering)
and a great many men do pass through
the Employment Department to oppor-
tunities with Allis-Chalmers. I did the
same thing myself.

During my last two years at Marquette,
in Milwaukee I worked as a cooperative
student at Allis-Chalmers on the electrical
test floor, in electrical product depart-
ments on both design and application
work, and in the shops. When I graduated,
I continued in the Graduate Training
Course, on training location with what is
now the Employe Relations Department.
After six months—opportunity came
around to look me up. The Company
officer in charge of Industrial Relations
talked to me about personnel work and
asked if I’d like to go on with it as a
career.

Liked Working With People

By that time I ’d-seen a lot of the Company,
both product design and manufacturing,
and I knew I liked working with people
better than with machines, so it was just
the break I wanted. During the war I was
in the shops on personnel work, got a

INK FROM THE EDITOR'S PEN

  

ngineers are naturally curious. They have a
thirst for knowledge which seems, at times,
unquenchable.

One type of curiosity results in a feverish seek-
ing for information about the relative merits of
instructors as each new semester begins. As mem-
bers of each new class enter the University, their
predecessors flock around them to pass along the
“hot word.” Then at the end of their first semester
they, in turn, join the throng of do-gooders who,
with their self-dulled axes to grind, foster this
detrimental practice.

Now is the time for you freshmen and sopho-
mores to set yourselves straight! You may have
friends in attendance here at Pitt who say Mr. X
is a “good Joe” or “steer clear of Mr. Z,” but don’t
let that cause you to enter class with a chip on
your shoulder, or pass up a course because so-and-
so isn’t teaching it this semester. Granted, a cer-
tain instructor’s methods have appeal to certain
types of students. But is hearsay sound basis for
you as an individual to judge beforehand whether
or not you will benefit from his instruction? Pre-
ference in instructors probably varies as widely
as your choice of clothing, and your friends don’t
pick your suits for you. Give the so-called “tough”
instructor a try and you’ll probably find the
course is only as tough as you make it; sail
through the “easy” ones and sooner or later you’re
certain to be held responsible for what you should
have learned. Who is the loser in the end?

OCTOBER, 1951

Speaking of the end—where is the end? Actual-
ly this ferreting out an imagined easy path is only
a beginning; it is the foundation for an attitude
which limits an individual’s progress and stunts
his technical growth. Want proof? Ask the seniors
who are now giving serious thought to accepting
positions in industry. Back through the grape-
vine has come the word! Ask about practically
any company and someone is sure to have a friend
who says . . . . Well, you’ve heard the stories be-
fore. Sadly enough there are men who choose their
employers on such testimonial, or at least single
out the ones for whom they don’t care to work!

Then they carry the practice into industry with
them; they foster baseless ill feeling toward su-
periors on the strength of the words of others, and
let their resulting prejudiced attitudes pull the
ladder of success from beneath them.

Fortunately, engineering students possess keen-
er than average minds or they wouldn’t remain as
engineering students. Even more fortunately, at
college age changes in thinking are more easily
made. So freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, nip
this practice in the bud ; senior, leave this practice
behind you as you leave to enter your chosen
fields. Satisfy the thirst for information, but di-
rect the satisfaction to pursuits which will be
beneficial.

K SKYSCRAPER

IN THIS ISSUE

As the Skyscraper Engineer begins its first full year of publication, Dr.
Fitterer begins his first year as Dean of the Schools of Engineering and
Mines. He did much toward making our first issue possible. Now, we would
like to repay him, in part, for his support and encouragement by helping the
large number of students who have never had the pleasure of meeting Dr.
Fitterer personally to become acquainted with him or know something of
him through reading.

Pitt Students In Industry is a new feature with this month's issue. Gene
Cowie tells us of the type of work he encountered while working for the
Westinghouse Home Appliance Division in Mansfield, Ohio this past Summer.

Pledges to Sigma Beta Sigma, professional eningeering fraternity, pro-
vide some interesting information on recent developments in engineering.

Those of you who looked forward to reading the proposed articles on
gas turbine development and our 275 mph wind tunnel promised for this
issue will be disappointed to see that they do not appear on these pages.
We could not obtain releases for either articles but will publish them if and
when the restrictions are lifted.

beginnng - - -

W e, the staff of The Skyscraper Engineer, the
students and the faculty feel that a new era
is beginning for the School of Engineering and
the School of Mines. Last month Dr. G. R. Fitterer

- was appointed Dean of these Schools.

Dr. Fitterer, the son of John Wesley and J ose-
phine Grace Richardson Fitterer, was born in
Newark, Ohio, April 19, 1901. While he was
still a boy his family moved to Terre Haute, In-
diana. During his high school years he worked for
a chemical firm and became interested in chemi-
cal engineering. When he was graduated he enroll-
ed at Rose Polytechnic Institute under this cur-
riculum. Among his extra curricular activities Dr.
Fitterer was the assistant editor of the school
magazine ; a member of Sigma Xi, science honor-
ary; Sigma Tau, engineering honorary; Sigma
Gamma Epsilon, mining and metallurgical honor-
ary; and Theta Xi, social fraterinty.

Upon graduation, Dr. Fitterer was employed by
the Highland Iron and Steel Co., Terre Haute,
Indiana, where he worked as a junior metallur-
gist making a study of electrolytic processes of
synthetic wrought iron.

During the next two years, Dr. Fitterer became

.a metallographer for the Stanley Tool Works.

Here his duties were centered around the metallo-
graphy of strip steel the open hearth, deep draw-
ing, forming and electroplating. In the fall of
1926, Dr. Fitterer was offered a research fellow-
ship at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, U.
S. Bureau of Mines, for the Mining and Metallur-
gical Advisory Boards. This course of study was
terminated with the degree of Master of Science
in 1927.

The same year he was employed by the Bureau
of Mines as a junior metallurgist and in only six
years he advanced from this position to associate
metallurgist to head of the department. During
this period Dr. Fitterer tackled numerous difficult
problems, such as the deoxidation of steel with
silicon, the study of extraction methods for non-
metallic inclusions in steel, ferrous silicates in
steel, the deoxidation of steel with aluminum, and
methods for the electrolytic extraction of inclu-
sions from plain carbon steels.

While working with the Bureau, Dr. Fitterer
also attended The University of Pittsburgh, work-
ing toward a doctor’s degree. His thesis work
was done on “The Presence of Non-Metallic Im-
purities in Steel Resulting from The Deoxidation
of Steel with Manganese and Manganese-Silicon
Alloys.” Dr. Fitterer was awarded his doctorate
degree in 1930.

OCTOBER, 1951

A NEW ERA

In 1932 Dr. Fitterer put his vast amount of ac-
cumulated knowledge to use in the fields of busi-
ness and production and formed The Fitterer
Pyrometer Co., Inc. This company was engaged in
the manufacture of high temperatured pyro-
meters using carbon-silicon carbide. The company
was later dissolved when the patents were sold to
a national steel corporation.

Dr. Fitterer was also a lecturer from 1934 to
1938 at The University of Pittsburgh and in 1938
was promoted to full professor and head of the
Metallurgical Engineering Department. In this
capacity he pulled this department from the low-
est of the lowly, after the fire several years back,
to one of the best, if not the best Metallurgical
Engineering Departments in the country. While
head of this department he performed numerous
other duties such as:

Director of Research, Acid Open Hearth Re-

search Association, Inc. _(an association of fif-

teen steel companies engaged in cooperative re-
search of acid open hearth refining process).

Supervisor of government research projects

during World War II and several Navy con-

tracts.

He is consultant for the Heppenstall Company,

Pittsburgh, Pa., and has also been a consultant

for the Heckett Engineering Co., Butler, Pa.,

the W. L. Maxson Corporation, New York, N.

Y., and Ste. des Electrodes de la Savoie, Paris,

France.

In August, 1951, Dr. Fitterer was appointed
Dean of The Schools of Engineering and Mines.

Thus, reads the biography to date of a man, who
in fifty years, has done more than the aggregate
sum of the tasks of ten ordinary men. There is
more, however, to Dr. Fitterer than a mere per-
sonal data sheet can tell. He is a man who makes
friends and keeps them, a man who thinks about
and talks with the students as well as the faculty,
and a man who is as widely known as any engin-
eering dean in the country. He is an organizer as
well as a worker.

We are confident that under Dr. Fitterer’s
guidance our Schools will grow by great strides
in enrollment figures, research, equipment, facul-
ty, organizational cohesiveness and national pres-
tige. His wide awake approach to any problems,
his genuine interest for all with whom he is con-
cerned, and his tremendous capacity and willing-
ness to work are going to make Pitt one of the
best.

Working with Dr. Fitterer makes us glad to
say, “We went to Pitt”.
