Cologne, West Germany, and enjoy
an additional four weeks in Europe.
The DC-7C set down lightly at
Amsterdam’s Schipol Airport at six
o’clock in the morning. Two students
and myself decided to see as much
of the city as possible before taking
an afternoon train to the respective
cities in which we would’be employed.

We walked about the city noting the
various differences and similarities to
US. life, watching with particular
interest the unfamiliar sight of people
traveling to begin their day’s work.
Since Amsterdam is a city of one
million people and one-half million
bicycles, The oddity lay not in the
fact that people were going to work
but in the means of transportation.
It was common to see men in busi
ness suits and women in high heels
and skirts traveling to work, vigor-
ously peddling their bicycles through
the downtown traffic.

We entered a hotel to partake of
breakfast in our first endeavor at
eating in Europe. To our amazement
we were served breakfast by an
English speaking waiter dressed in
formal tie and black tails. After eat-
ing we again began to walk about
Amsterdam. Our brief visit termin-
ated by viewing the works of the
renown Dutch painters, Rembrandt
and van Gogh.

From Amsterdam I traveled by
train south to Cologne. This city
would be my home for the next two
months. Cologne has a population of
about 800,0()0, not unlike Pittsburgh
in size. The city is centered about the
magnificent Cathedral situated pic-
turesquely along the Rhine River.
Cologne, devastated during World
War II, has been rebuilt with modern
techniques so as to contain numerous
impressive, modern buildings such as
the new opera house and the various
structures comprising the University
of Cologne. In the reconstruction of
Cologne the city fathers did not for-
get to provide for recreational facili-
ties. Thus the city possess an array
of plazas centered about impressive
functions and reflecting pools, a large
sports arena complex, and several
parks and gardens. The most impres-
sive park in Cologne is Rhine Park.
Here one may leisurely stroll among
the beautiful lawns and gardens, re-
lax to the strains of music from the
outdoor bandstand, dine at one of
several outdoor cafes, or even dance
on an elevated, fountain encompassed
dance floor.

I worked north of Cologne in Lever-
kusen for Forbenfabriken Bayer AG,
the largest chemical corporation in

The Colosseum, eternal monument to the glori-ous days of ancient Rome.

Europe. I selected Bayer as my em-
ployer due to its international pres-
tige and the large variety of processes
conducted in its operation. In this
respect I would be able to work with
and become familiar with a variety
of modern techniques and processes,
enabling me to benefit in the best
possible manner from the excellent

opportunity offered me. Farbenfabri-
ken Bayer AG, the originator of the
Bayer aspirin, has grown from its
meager beginnings of producing
organic dyes and aspirin to the pre-
sent position of manufacturing no
less than 8500 products. The pro-
ducts lie in the fields of: dyestuffs
and auxiliaries, chemicals, pharma-

An example of the modern architecture that dominates Berlin.

EMITT

ceutical, dental and veterinary pro-
ducts, seven man-made fibers, pesti-
cides, and Agfa camera products. The
operation of Bayer is so extensive it
produces its own sulfuric acid and
benzene and operates one of the two
largest computer centers in Europe.
The Bayer complex enploys 62,000
people in Europe with sales agencies
in 152 countries. Last year the firm
had sales in excess of one billion
dollars and in 1960 spent twenty-eight
million dollars on research. As a
result of the research, the staff con—
tains several Nobel Prize awardees:
one half of every dollar of Bayer’s
turnover is earned by products which
have been developed only in the last
twelve years.

My first day at Bayer was an inter-
esting one indeed. Although I spoke
very little German, I conquered the
complexities of the personnel office
with the aid of an English speaking
secretary. Upon completion of the
preliminary requirements, I wa s
taken to the laboratory where I, was
to work for the next eight weeks: At
this point I was introduced to several
English speaking German students.

The Bayer Chemical complex where I was employed.

Since the students h ad learned
English in school, they welcomed the
opportunity to express their thoughts
in English. In the same respect, I
was anxious to acquire a knowledge
of the Gernam language. Thus began
a program of the bilingual exchange
of comments and ideas.

l\Iy job at the Leverkusen plant of

Bayer involved work in an organic

analytical laboratory. I began doing
standard volumetric analysis of dia-
zonium salts. As I became familiar
with particular laboratory practices,
I advanced to paper chromatography
work and eventually to the qualita-
tive and quantitative anaylsis of
nitro- and amino- phenols through the
use of thin layer chromatography, a
relatively new analytic ‘technique.

ALUMNI AND THE
STUDENT

I am sure that most engineering students realize that
when they leave the University they are classified as an
alumnus and automatically become a member of the
Engineering and Mines Alumni Association. But I wonder
how many really know what their Alumni Association is
and what it does.

The Engineering and Mines Alumni Association of
the University had its start long before World War II;
but it has been since then that it has become the strong

By Charles Hosick

Organization that it is today. The Association is made up

of all Engineering and Mines Alumni throughout the
country and is headed by the E & M Alumni Council
that meets in Pittsburgh to direct the activities of the
Association. The Council is made up of E & M Alumni
and Faculty and an E & M Student. With this type of
makeup, the Council provides very close coordination
between the students, faculty and alumni.

For graduating seniors, the faculty has initiated a
Senior Social where seniors are told of the activities of
the Association and will, beginning this year, be given an
identification card which will identfy them as alumni of
the University. The association has established the G.
Raymond Fitterer Scholarship which is given each year
to a deserving student from the schools of Engineering
and Minees. This award will be presented at the Associ-
ation’s annual dinner meeting. Students are also invited
to this meeting which is the highlight of the Associations
activities.

This year the dinner meeting will be held on l\/Iarch
17 during Pitt’s Engineers Week. It will be held in the
dining room of the University Club. The program for
this meeting promises to be one of the best in the history
of the Association. The main speaker will be Dr. William
O. Baker, Vice-President —- Research of Bell Telephone
Laboratories.

Dr. Baker’s area at Bell Labs covers the physical
sciences division of physics, chemistry, chemical physics,
metallurgy and solid state electronics; the communications
principles division of mathematics, visual and acustics,
electronics and radio, and communications social science
research, and the communications systems division of
guided wave research, communications technique research
and systems research.

Dr. Baker received his B.S. in 1935 from Washington
College in Maryland. He then entered graduate study at
Princeton and received his Ph. D. in 1938. His doctoral
work at Princeton was mainly in the area which is today
called solid state research. His work dealt mainly with
determining electrical properties of molecular crystals.
From there Dr. Baker began research in physical chemis-
try at Bell Labs in 1939. He has concentrated much of his
efforts on the Study of Macromolecules, the basic elements
of plastics, fibers, natural and synthetic rubbers, and
tissues of growing plants and animals. These substances
are of particular interest to Bell Labs, as the chief
electrical insulators in communications systems.

DR. WILLIAM O. BAKER

In the early 1940’s Dr. Baker was responsible for
Bell Labs part in the program of polymer research set up.
under the rubber director’s office. This research led to
the discovery of a new kind of synthetic polymer mole-
cular called “microgel”.

He has spent 15 years of active research in the area
of polymers and has contributed some 40 research papers
to the field. In addition, Dr. Baker holds about 14
patents in subjects involving high polymers, including a
recent one on a method of increasing the strength of solid
fuels used in rocket propellents.

Since 1954, his work has been mainly administrative,
serving first as, director of research -4 physical sciences
and currently as vice—president — research. Dr. Baker
has indeed a very long and distinguished record both
academically and professionally and I am sure that his
talk will be both extremely interesting and timely.

With this dinner, the Association is initiating a
Distinguished Alumni Award, whch will be given to two
very distinguished gentlemen and alumni of the schools
of Engineering and Mines.

One will be awarded to Mr. Marcus A. Follansbee.
Mr. Follansbee was graduated from the school of Mines
in 1914 with an E. M. degree. As an undergraduate, Mr.
Follansbee was quite active in University activities. He
was a member of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity, Student
Council and the Athletic Committee. He was also Business
Manager of the OWL, Assistant Manager of the football
team and president of his senior class.

After his graduation from Pitt, he began his career
with Follansbee Steel Corp. and rose to the presidency in
1948.

Mr. Follansbee took a very active part in community
affairs and has served as trustee of several organizations.
Mr. Follansbee has contributed very generously to the
University and is indeed worthy of a Distinguished
Alumni Award.

The other awardee is Mr. George M. Bevier. Mr.
Bevier was also graduated from the school of Mines. He
received a B.S. degree from the school in 1913.

Mr. Bevier began his career as a petroleum geologist
with the Arizona Copper Co. Since 1930, Mr. Bevier has
been an independent geeologist and has proven extremely
successful. He credits much of his success to his education

Bra designers must solve the problem 0 providing an uplift against
vertical downward and sometimes tangential forces. They have
borrowed from the design of suspension bridges, supplying vertical
supports of wire or bone that are similar to a bridge’s piers. Wire
cages for the cups duplicate the wire ropes supporting the bridge’s
roadway.

B R A S S I E R S : An Engineering Masterpiece

THERE is more to brassiere design
than meets the eye. In many respects,
the challenge of enclosing and sup-
porting a semi—solid mass of variable
volume and shape, plus its adjacent
mirror image — together they equal
the female bosom—invo1ves a design
effort comparable to that of building
a bridge or a cantilevered skyscraper.

Hundreds of bra designers, many
with engineering training, eagerly ac-
cept this challenge and apply their
unusual skills eight hours a day, ﬁve
days a week. The center of this
activity is a ﬁve-block stretch of sky-

. scrapers ﬂanking Manhattan’s Madi-

son Avenue in the shadow of the
Empire State Building. More than
200 brassiere design innovations. are
sent to the United States Patent
Office each year from this area.

Why so many patent applications
on brassieres? More than $450 mil-
lion is spent annually on brassieres
in this country alone. How much of
this cash a bra will attract is a direct
result of how well it does its job. And
its performance, of course, depends
upon the design.

By the 1930s, women had secured
a certain measure of equality with
men and felt they could relax a bit.
Their dresses were designed to the
natural female form, which meant
that women, after having been flat-
tened for the decade following World
War I, began looking for something
that would help them ﬁll out the
front of their dresses. So the uplift
bra was invented.

At ﬁrst, the uplift consisted only
of a cotton band stretched across the
torso beneath the bosom. It was
called the “bandeaux.” Later, to re-
duce the obvious visual effects of
lateral and vertical motion, and to
provide ﬁrmer support, breast cups
were added and held up with shoulder
straps.

To form a basic breast cup all it
takes is two curved pieces of material
sewn together along the curve. The
resulting container will approximate
a hemisphere or a cone, depending

upon the sharpness of the curve. The
resulting seam, under pressure, often
proved irritating to the wearer. Hence
the evolution of cup design has cen-
tered to a large degree on getting the
seams out of the way of sensitive
areas. Cups are now frequently de-
signed in multi-sections which, when
properly pieced together, produce a
form-ﬁtting hemisphere or cone. The
cup may be made up of four to
eight triangles, tapezoids and other
quadrilateral sections in mixed com-
bination.

Bra sizes have been standardized
somewhat over the years, although
bras of the same nominal size will
differ in terms of comfort, form-ﬁt,
support, construction, durability and
price. There are two basic measures
used to characterize a brassiere’s size.
Inches indicate the basic size, while
alphabetical designations denote var-
iations in the volume of the bust cup.

Most brassiere designers work only
with the “ideal” model size, which
happens to be 34-B. To arrive at
tooling requirements for other sizes,
they extrapolate. Commercial sizes
range from 28-AAA to 55-DD. The
34-B “ideal” is not entirelv an arbi-
tary designation. Rather, it represents
the bust line considered most pleas-
ing to the artistic eye of most dress
designers — although there is room
here for disagreement.

Bra size, contrary to popular belief,
is measured with a tape measure
initially across the top of the chest,
not across the bust. If this measure
is 34 inches, the bra size is 34. There
are several ways to make a volu-
metric determination of cup size. If
the bust is considered essentially a
half—sphere, the designer may use any
of the following formulas to determine
the volume of the breast cup:

V=l)“x.5236 or V=r"x4.1888

where V equals the volume of one-half
sphere, D equals the diameter of the

By Edward Nanas

sphere, and r equals the radius of the
sphere. '
If the bust is conical, the formula
which may be used is:
V=D.,"' x h, x .7854
3

where D equals the diameter of the
cone’s base and h equals the height
of the cone.

One can readily see that it might
be rather difficult to measure ac-
curately some of the variables, espe-
cially if the individual bust exhibits
more ﬂuidity than rigidity. There-
fore, designers prefer to make their
initial volumetric determinations ex-
perimentally on live models with ﬁrm
busts. The customer is told to de-
termine her individual bust size by
measuring the number of inches
around the top of the chest, then
measuring the girth across the highest
part of the bust. If the difference
between the two measurements is
1 inch, the cup size would be A;Q
inches, B; 3 inches, C; 4 inches, D.

To achieve support, designers must
consider ways to provide an uplift
against the Vertical (downward) and
sometimes tangential force of the
woman’s bust. This force, of course,
is due to gravity. The object of the
designer then is to keep the bosom
at a pleasing equilibrium in the face
of gravity.

There are a number of methods of
achieving bust equilibrium. First and
most obvious is the addition of straps
to the top of the breast cups. How-
ever, this solves only part of the prob-
lem since the weight of the bosom
often is more than the straps can
sustain without cutting uncomfort-
ably into the wearer’s shoulders.

So the lower contour of the breast
cups usually are attached to a wide
band which completely encircles the
torso and latches (by means of hooks
and eyes) at the back. This skin-
tight band tends to provide a ﬁrm
anchor beneath the bosom — a hori-
zontal plane below which the bosom
cannot slip. To meet expansion char-

‘I3

BRASSIERS

acteristic of the rib cage, the band
may contain expandable rubberized
sections and elastic gussets at points
where excess pressure might cause
the wearer discomfort. These gussets
serve similar functions to the expan-
sion joints in bridges and ships.

Where larger cup sizes are required,
the above measures still might not be
enough to offset the downward verti-
cal force of the bosom. Additional
uplift support is then provided by
sandwiching various rigid or semi-
rigid structural members between the
layers of material that make up the
breast cup. The structural members
may consist of (1) starched or plas-
ticized material; (2) vertical, curved
or tangential wire forms, or (3) bones
and chicken feathers.

The structural members act much
like shoring timbers used in coal
mines except that the retaining mem-
ber is angled down and in against
the rib cage "rather than out and
away. Because they are secured at
both top and bottom of the cup, they
act as segments of a retaining wall.

Another method of offsetting the
downward force of the bosom-and
retaining undesirable lateral move-
ment of the semi-ﬂuid masses —— is
exempliﬁed in the design of the
“Action” bra. This bra employs the
principles of cantilever suspension,
setting up a situation involving op-
posite and equal vector forces. Ex-
tending from each shoulder strap is
an S-shaped strap which runs across
the top of the breast cup and down
to the central point between the two
cups, then underneath and up the
outside edge of the opposite cup.

In effect, a ﬁgure 8 is created which
behaves in cantilever fashion. Part
of the downward vertical force on one
breast acts in conjunction with that
of the other, partially cancelling it—
that is, converting the downward
force into a restricted horizontal or
diagonal force equal and opposite
instead of in parallel.

Within these basic designs there
are virtually unlimited engineering
combinations. The Lovable C0,,
which ships more than a quarter of a
million bras each week, has developed

‘I4

SHOWN HERE is patent 3,030,962 for
a strapless bra, issued to Arthur Gar-
son, president of Lovable 00., and an
experienced bra designer. More than
200 innovations in brassiere design are
submitted to the Patent Office annually.
a simple devise called the T-strap.
This strap is affixied to the cup with
a small metal T-shaped fastener at
the end instead of being sewn to the
cup. Along the top, inside contour
of each cup are small, evenly-spaced
holes (six in all) into which the
metal devices may be inserted. Thus
the strap may be secured anywhere
along the top of the bra, either to
provide a more comfortable vector
angle, or to make the strap conform
to the angle of the dress straps so that
the bra straps do not peek out.

Undoubtedly, the most impressive
challenge comes in the design of a
strapless bra. Since the cable-type
support of shoulder straps is not avail-
able, all uplift must be provided from
the bottom, often without the secur-
ity of a straight—around skin—tight
band.

The problem is generally solved
by fabricating a wire cage for the
breast cup, with a heavy, semi—cir-
cular wire running under each cup.
This double—U, with additional verti-
cal supports imbedded in the lower
band, resembles a suspension bridge.
The structural principles are almost
identical.

Arthur Garson, who has been de-
signing brassieres or 35 years, re-
cently was awarded a patent on a
completely self—supporting strapless
bra that does not require auxiliary
supporting means such as uncomfort-
able wires or bones in the breast cup.

To accomplish this feat, Mr. Garson
departed somewhat from conven-
tional materials practice in that he
uses plastic in his design. Plastics are
rarely used in place of wires and
bones because those that resist the
heat of the wearer’s body generally
are too costly for mass production.

Sandwiched into the outer trian-
gular sections of the new strapless
cup are curved and ﬂexible plastic
stiffening members, shaped to con-
form to the conical side portions of
the cup. These impart rigidity and
upright self-supporting characteristics
to the cup. The cup itself is made of
a stiff but ﬂexible material which co-
operates with the laterally—spaced
plastic members to impart additional
support.

The quest for new and different
methods of enclosing the bosom goes
on at a fever pitch. ‘New markets are
constantly being explored, and new
market mean new designs. One
Madison Avenue designer, an engineer
by training, is convinced that he can
apply the aerosol principle to the
brassiere. He has developed a quick-
hardening plastic compound which he
intends to spray on a perfectly form-
ﬁtting plastic bra—one that can be
peeled off at the end of the day.
However, one major problem remains.
He has not yet found a satisfactory
method of containing the bust in the
proper conﬁguration while the liquid
bra is being sprayed on.

Brassiere design is one engineering
activity, at least, in which the United
States is far ahead of the Soviet
Union. The Russians are about 30
years behind, according to Mrs. Ida
Rosenthal, 77-year-old matriarch of
the American foundation industry
and head of Maidenform, Inc. She
recently returned from a tour of the
Soviet garment industry and found
that the bra designers on the other

side of the Iron Curtain have not yet.

discovered stretch fabrics, foam pad-
ding, hooks and eyes, or the strapless
bra.

Meanwhile, the Americans are forg-
ing ahead and may soon get a break-
through that will provide a spray-on
brassiere in an aerosol can.

"With fewer parts and connections,"
Westinghouse scientists decided, “we'd
have a much more reliable ampliﬁer."

So they developed a new kind, using
techniques called “molecular electronics."
The device is a functional electronic block,
one quarter-inch square. (That's the cap-

sule. Actually, the electronics are on a bit
of specially-treated silicon the size of a
chip diamond.)

Other Westinghouse functional elec-
tronic blocks are just as small. They're
used in experimental products like a
pocket-size TV camera and a radio receiver

that's half an inch square and an inch long.

Today, Westinghouse makes these ultra-
reliable little devices mostly for military
applications.

One day, you'll ﬁnd them in electronic
products everywhere.

When the University of Nevada awarded John Lauritzen
his B.S.E.E. in 1961, it was only the first big step in the
learning program he envisions for himself. This led him
to Western Electric. For WE agrees that ever—increasing
knowledge is essential to the development of its engi-
neers—and is helping John in furthering his education.

John attended one of Western Electric’s three Grad-
uate Engineering Training Centers and graduated with
honors. Now, through the Company—paid Tuition Refund

Elliptic Equations

INTRODUCTION

The engineer of today frequently
must deal with problems the solutions
ofgwhich do not exist in closed form.
While it is generally possible to solve
such problems by some method of
numerical approximation, a great
number of them may also be solved
by means of special methods or func-
tions whose application will materially
shorten the work of solution. Among
the most useful of these are the ellip-
tic integrals and the associated elliptic
functions, which are indispensible in
the study of pendulums, elastic curves,
pressure airships envelopes, stresses
incurred in ships rolling in a heavy
sea, capillary surfaces, projectile
motion under the inﬂuences of gravity
and air resistance, and many other
problems in mechanics and physics.
Because of their wide range of appli-
cation it would be advantageous for
engineers to be at least slightly ac-
quainted with the elliptic integrals
and a few of their more important
applications, and the present article
was written with this in mind. It is
not, however, a treatise on the subject
in any sense of the word; many books
have been published, a few of the
more well known being Hancock’s
Elliptic Integrals and Lectures on the
Theory of Elliptic Functions, Green-
hill’s The Applications of the Elliptic
Functions, and Chapter III of Red-
dick and Miller’s Advanced ZlIathe-
matics for Engineers.

ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS
IN GENERAL

The elliptic integrals as they are
known today stem from the work of
the French mathematician Legendre
in the early nineteenth century,
although special cases had previously
been studied by Bernoulli and Euler
during the eighteenth century. Legen-
dre’s work was expanded by Jacobi
and Abel to include the elliptic func-
tions, thus giving it the form it has
retained to the present day. It was
long known than an integral of the

f Fax

form  , where F and G are
rational functions of X, was integrable
in closed form only if the degree of G

26

was ﬁrst or second, but no higher, but
it remained for Legendre to show that
if G were of third or fourth degree,
then the integral could be made to

depend on three integrals: Ii.
6
(IX

, X dX
IV 6 , and (X-b)V G,called by

him the elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst,
second, and third kinds respectively.
A more readily usable form of these
integrals was presented by Jacobi:

F(K,X) : x._L__.j_.
0 ~/( n—x?m —x? x?)

X/ 22
:(x,x) =f 
0 ‘\/I-X2

dX

x
'|T(N,K-,X) =f ‘X
o (I—Nx2)«/(I-75)(I—K5x5)

where F(K,X) , E(K,X) , and
'IT(N,K,x) , K being any real number
between zero and one or equal to
zero or to one, are the elliptic integrals
of the ﬁrst, second and third kinds
respectively. If the substitutions
X=SIN (p, dX=COS <1) dd) are made
in the above, one obtains Legendre’s
normal form:

F(x,o) 3]-¢_J2__
o ~/I—K3sIN2¢

I-:(K,¢) =f«/¢I—K5sm’¢’$ cub
.. O

-n'(N,I<,¢) =f¢ dd’
0 (I—NsIu"’¢)~/I—K2sIN2¢

Here K is called the modulus of the
integral, and its range of values is the
same as before. The upper limit (l) is
called the amplitude, whose range of
values is O to :21 and the parameter
N is any integer.‘ Integration is ac-
complished by making a binomial ex‘-
pansion of the quantity under the
radical and integrating the resulting
inﬁnite series term by term. Tables
of such integrations for the elliptic
integrals of the first and second kinds
are to be found in most standard
handbooks. In order to illustrate some
of the features of the elliptic integrals,
a few applications will be considered.

by Warren Kennedy

THE RECTIFICATION OF
THE ELLIPSE

The elliptic integrals are so named
because originally they were used to
determine the arc length of ellipses.
Consider any ellipse of major axis
length A, and minor axis length B, as
shown in Fig. 1, were a b c d is the
ellipse and P some point on it whose
location depends upon the circles of
radii A and B, as well as the angle (ll
between_ line OQ and the Y axis. The
dX=A COS O d O, and dY=—B SIN
general equation of an ellipse is

3?. 1%-
“+32-I

and since, from the figure, X=A SIN

(l)= the“ Y: 3./1-ﬁg .=
8»\/|- A 32; 5 = acosb

and the corresponding differentials are

 

ax: Acosta ¢y-.-..3sm¢¢¢

The equation for the differen-

tial arc length, .53 = .\/¢x5+' ¢_y5 , is

therefore,

K2 = ALB?
where A2
If it is assumed that when (l)=O, the

arc length S is also zero, then S =

Thus, if one wished to ﬁnd the arc
length from X=‘O to X=1 on an ellipse
whose major axis.is A and whose
minor axis is B, he would note that
at X=1, ¢= ARCSIN .5 =T6l'- and that

K =.,/—2—'éi = .866 = sINso°
2
Therefore,
s = 2E( sm eo°,_ -';_-"- ) = 1.022

where the sine value of K is used
because in most tables the amplitude
‘O is ploted versus the angle whose
sine is the modulus K, rather than the
modulus itself. The total circumfer-
ence of the ellipse is four times the arc
length from X=O to X=A, making the

amplitude -121 . Thus in the above

)]= 9.688

example, c = 4[2s(sm so°, '2'

When the amplitude of any elliptic
integral is % , as in this case, then
it is called a complete elliptic integral.

TH.E SIMPLE PENDULUM

Consider the pendulum shown in
Fig. 2, where a point mass M attached
to a light, rigid rod of length L,
swings about pivot point 0. If the
pendulum is displaced an angle from
the vertical, as shown, then M will
travel a distance S=LO, and if the
maximum angle of displacement is
0°, then M will travel a distance S°
from the equilibrium position. The
weight of the mass, Mg, will exert a

force component equal tO—MgSIN-G

along the path S when the pendulum
is displaced an angle '0-. The minus
sign merely indicates that the force
opposes the displacement. Since, from
Newton’s second law, this force must
equal the mass M times its accelera-

tion g%_ , then

Thus
%&=«/Q-E J cose— c

The arbitrary constant C can be de-
termined by noting that when the
pendulum reaches its maximum angle
of displacement, 0°, it momentarily
comes to a halt and g becomes zero.

It should be obvious, by inspection,
that this can occur only if C equals
COS O, and thus

K=1/SIN U, thus giving the time
required for the pendulum to swing
from O = O to O = 2U. Note, how-
ever, that sinceSIN O is less than
one, the modulus K is greater than
one, which is not permissible. This
obstacle can be sidestepped by letting
SIN O = K SIN U,

Notice that if it is desired to ﬁnd the
time necessary for the pendulum to go
from zero to maximum displacement,
that is, one quarter of the period
P of oscillation of the pendulum, the
amplitude of the integral becomes

integral:

increased still further the ends move
still closer together until, if the bar is
long enough, the curve crosses over
itself. Ultimately, if the bar is in-
ﬁnitely long the curve will approach
the axis asymptetically, as shown in
Fig. 5. This will occur when the mod-
ulus, equals one, which implies that
for a given compressive force and a
given ﬂexural rigidity there is a maxi-
mum value that can have.

These examples serve to demon-
strate the utility of the elliptic inter-
gals in the solution of a wide range
of problems. Scientists and engineers
find them valuable tools in the study
of hydrodynamics, dynamics, elasti-
city, electromagnetism, and many
other areas, and it therefore would
seem wise for the student engineer at
least to have a nodding acquaintance
with them. Hopefully this article has
accomplished this.

Result: More rust-resistant steel than
ever before on 1964 Ford-built bodies!

Ford Motor Company, pioneer in the use of galvanized
(zinc-clad) steel. long noted for its ability to ﬁght oﬁ‘
rust, is using increased amounts of this superior
material in 1964 car models. This marks further
progress in our continuing eﬁorts to solve the prob-
lems of metal corrosion in car bodies.

Other Ford-developed rust ﬁghters include special
zinc-rich primers . . . aluminum and stainless steels
in muﬁlers, moldings and body fasteners . . . quality
baked-enamel ﬂnishes—a|| powerful barriers against
rust in Ford-built cars and trucks.

A new process, now in limited test production, is the
electrocoating of entire car bodies. This involves
electrical attraction between positively charged metal
surfaces and negatively charged paint particles. When
the body is dipped in an aqueous solution containing
the paint particles. a form of "electroplating" occurs,
the paint seeking those areas with the least coverage,
until a complete and uniform coating is deposited.

Sixty tons of stainless steel will hold in control the surging atoms of a unique new nuclear
reactor being readied to power Canada's ﬁrst full—scale electric-producing‘ nuclear gen.erating plant.

The new power station, which is being constructed for Atomic Energy of Canada Limited,
is being erected at a cost of $81.5 million. It will be located at Douglas Point on the Shore of
Lake Huron in Ontario. The new station is designed for a 200.000 kilowatt capacity. It is expected
to produce its first electric power in 1965.

Dominion Bridge Company, Montreal, is fabricating the giant stainless steel reactor vessel.
It will be 20 feet in diameter and 17 feet long. Thickness will vary from ‘Z; to 1% inches.

Because of the strict cleanliness requirements for the metal used iii the reactor, special
attention was given to the melting process in production of the stainless steel. In addition, the steel
was ultrasonically examined at Allegheny Ludlum.

The huge vessel will be used to contain natural uranium fuel and heavy water. Using heavy
water as a coolant is relatively new and unique in the atomic energy ﬁeld. There are several advan-
tages in heavy water moderated natural-uranium fueled reactors. Among others, they have high
neutron economy and require small quantities of ore per unit of power. Despite the high tempera.-
tures and corrosive conditions caused by the atom splitting, the stainless steel reactor tank will last
indefinitely.

A new development which yields a completed picture ready for
viewing at practically the same moment it’s taken and without the need
for any chemical developers whaever has been invented by General
Electric. The new process permits instant development, righ resolution.
an(l reuse of the film. This is the first time that a permanent image
with these characteristics has been. produced by ordinary light.

The new process is called “Photo-Plastic Recording” by General
Electric. It records an image by exposing a plastic ﬁlm to light. The
ﬁlm is sensitized before exposure by subjecting it to an electrostatic
charge. Heating the ﬁlm causes the charge particles to pass tiny defor-
mations into the plastic, conforming to the image. The image is then
“frozen in“ by cooling the plastic. Heating and cooling are accomplished
in less than a second. Reheating erases the image.

According to General Electric. the PPR film can be left in the open
before it is used. Exposure to bright sunlight has no effect of any kind
upon its image—recording qualities. The fine detail that can be achieved
far exceeds that obtained by conventional photography.

Reuse of the same film more than a dozen times without sub-
stantially imparing the quality of the image is possible with the new
process. The images are projected by a special technique made neces-
sary because the image on the film is in the form of tiny depressions or
ripples. rather than light and dark areas as in conventional photo-
graphing processes. Both slides and movies are possible with PPR
process.

The tiny atom, like the lumbering dinosaur, has left permanent “fossil” tracks in the earth’s
rocks. Overlooked by scientists until now, the newly-discovered atomic tracks found by G. E.
scientists hold a key to the age of the minerals in which they are preserved.

The atomic tracks were discovered in a piece of mica, a mineral found in rocks throughout
the world. Minerals, including mica. contain. a trace of uranium, a radioactive element. The atoms
of uranium are unstable and decay at a known rate into atoms of elements that are not radio-
active. Ever since the minerals solidiﬁed from molten material, this clock has been. ticking away.
Some of the uranium atoms decay by undergoing ﬁssion fragments move away. and they leave a
trail. This damaged region, about 0.0005 inch long by a few atoms in diameter, constitutes a
permanent “fossil" record of each tick of the atomic clock.

At first the tracks could only ‘be seen with an electron microscope. However, it was dis-
covered that by dripping the sample in hydrofluoric (acid the tracks could be enlarged enough to
be seen even through a low—power optical microscope.

After the mica was etched, the tracks were counted. The next task was to determine the total
amount of uranium in the sample. This was done by irradiating the sample in a nuclear reactor,
splitting artiﬁcally some of the remaining atoms. After the sample was again etched. a new count
was made. The age of the mica was determined by calculating the ratio of the old tracks to the new.

The new dating technique, which can be performed quickly and inexpensively by the geology
department of any college, is not limited to terrestrial rocks. It also can be used to sudy the history
of meteorites, chunks of interplanetary debris that sometimes plunge to the earth after a ﬁery ﬂight

through space. The results may give new clues to the age and origin of the solar system.

Rubber that pours is a new development from the research labs
of General Electric. The new material is called RTV (room temperature
vulcanizing) liquid silicone rubber and will be used for low volume
requirements for duplication of small metal objects ranging from pattern
letters to jewelry through rubber molds.

The rubber is a high temperature resistant material capable of with-
standing temperatures of 600° F and above. The mold is obtained by
pouring the rubber upon the object and allowing the rubber to c11re for
24 hours at room temperature or within three hours at 150° F.

In studies conducted by General Electric, up to 35 reproductions
have been made from a single mold without apparent damage to the
rubber. No parting agent is required to separate a cast part from the
silicone mold as silicone rubber releases easily from other objects.

Mold life has been found to be improved by an over-night bake
at 200° F to 300° F and is still further increased by aging the mold
for a week or two. Although it is unlikely that satisfactory results could
be achieved with steel and some of the other metals with extremely
high melting points. it is possible to cast parts of zinc and other higher
melting metals by employing special techniques which cool the mold
while the metal is being poured. One of these that has some success
involves cooling the mold with water.

The silicone rubber molds are less costly to make than metal molds,
provide greater accuracy of detail than sand. and have a much greater
life expectancy than wood.

Energy Does Zllatter, Werner Emmerich . . l\/Iilton
Gottlieb . . . Carl Helstrom . . . William Stewart. Walker
and Company, Publishers . . . March, 1964- . . . 256 pages
. . . $5.95.

The second volume in the Westinghouse Search Books
series deals with matter and energy and the relationship
between them in accordance with established principles
of physics and mathematics. The subject matter for
Energy Does Zllatter is an appropriate choice for the
second book in the series as all branches of science deal
with energy in one form or another. Hence, an under
standing of energy is fundamental to an understanding of
science.

Dr. Emmerich introduces the book in this provocative
manner: “If we were to convert the mass of a copper
penny entirely i-nto energy, we could drive the ocean liner
Queen Mary clear around the world at top speed. This
is a prediction of the theory of. relativity, . . . Nobody
has succeeded in performing this particular trick with a
penny, and we don’t even know if it is feasible. But it is
one example in which the nature of energy is revealed to
11s through one of the most famous equations is science
— E=Mc2.”

Such an introduction raises the question, “What is
energy all about?” Dr. Gottlieb, the physicist, tells what
he thinks it is all about in his discussion of mechanics,
heat, light, sound, magnetism, and electricity. He gives a
rational explanation of natural phenomena such as: con-
servation of energy, laws of thermodynamics, Carnot
cycle, Coulomb’s law, Ohm’s law, Faraday’s law, electro-
magnetic spectrum, quantum theory, black body radi-
ation, energy conservation, and thereafter, quickly brings
the subject into proper perspective. Through his descrip-

38

tion of energy, the reader learns how the scientist encoun-
ters energy in the laboratory and how it is encountered
on the earth and in the universe. His review of the rudi-
mentary ideas is deliberate; this gives him the basis for
presenting more abstract concepts, more advanced ideas.
He leaves little doubt that energy controlled is beneficial
and benevolent; whereas, energy uncontrolled is terrify-
ing to contemplate.

Such matters are not the concern of the mathema-
tician beyond the fact that they make it possible for him
to relate his abstract discussion of the mathematics of
energy to a concrete base. And, Dr. Helstrom — the
mathematician — does just this as he brings within the
grasp of the uninitiated layman such complicated themes
as the special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics,
which “ . . . have brought about a_ revolution in the world
of physics which has affected its very foundation.”

The person who puts theory to work — the engineer
—- writes the concluding chapters in this book. Dr.
Stewart, who looks at economics as well as engineering,
tells how theory is applied to develop more efﬁcient
machines for converting energy into useful forms. He
analyzes the full spectrum of energy sources, to find out
which can serve man most economically through the
years. He describes known reserves or supplies of energy,
outlines current projects for converting this energy into
a useful form, and then speculates a bit about exotic
methods of energy conversion. He also speculates about
the utlimate supply of energy needed to maintain life
as we know it. And, like the true scientist he is, he ends
on a realistic, but hopeful, note; a note of challenge —
science and technology will, and must, anticipate energy
demands and figure practical ways to supply them.

Freedom 8: Discipline

Modern physics has identiﬁed 34 elementary
particles of matter—-each with its twin anti-parti-
ole. The inevitable two opposing forces that keep
the universe in balance.

We think at the heart of most well-run modern
companies there are also two opposing and equally
important forces——freedom and discipline.

Freedom to innovate, to change, develop and
invent. Plus the discipline to stick to the facts, to
stick to the problem, to stay within the budget.

At Celanese we try to combine freedom and dis-
cipline to better serve our customers, our share-
holders, and our employees.

Perhaps we are the company at which you can
best pursue your career. If you are trained in
chemical engineering, electrical engineering, me-
chanical engineering, chemistry or physics, we
hope you will stop in to see our representative

'''' . A

Once upon a time there was a creature known to joke-
smiths as “the efficiency expert.” When he wasn’t being
laughed at, he was being hated. Kodak felt sorry for the
poor guy and hoped that in time he could be developed into
an honored, weight—pulling professional. That was long ago.

We were then and are much more today a very highly
diversiﬁed manufacturer. We need mechanical, electrical,
chemical, electronic, optical, etc., etc. engineers to design
equipment and processes and products for our many
kinds of plants, and make it all work. But all the inanimate
objects they mastermind eventually have to link up with
people in some fashion or other—the people who work in
the plants, the people who manage the plants, and the

people who buy the products. That’s why we need
“industrial engineers.”

A Kodak industrial engineer learns mathematical model-
building and Monte Carlo computer techniques. He uses
the photographic techniques that we urge upon other manu-
facturing companies. He collaborates with medicos in physio-
logical measurements, with architects, with sales executives,
with manufacturing executives, with his boss (G. H. Gustat,
behind the desk above, one of the Fellows of the American
Institute of Industrial Engineers). He starts fast. Don
Wagner (M.S.I.E., Northwestern ’61) had 4 dissimilar
projects going the day the above picture was sneaked. He
is not atypical. Want to be one?

GROWTH THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE

The Role of
R&D in Industry

Q. Dr. Haller, how does General Electric define that overworked term, Re-

>0

search and Development?

. At General Electric we consider “R&D” to cover a whole spectrum of

activities, ranging from basic scientiﬁc investigation for its own sake to
the constant efforts of engineers in our manufacturing departments to
improve their products—even in small ways. Somewhere in the middle
of this range is an area we call simply “technology”, the practical know-
how that couples scientiﬁc knowledge with the engineering of products
and services to meet customer needs.

. How is General Electric organized to do research and development?
. Our Company has four broad product groups—-Aerospace and Defense,

Consumer, Electric Utility, and Industrial. Each group is divided into
divisions, and each division into departments. The departments are like
separate businesses, responsible for engineering their products and serving
their markets. So one end of the R&D spectrum is clearly a department
function——engineering and product design. At the other end is the Re-
search Laboratory which performs both basic and applied research for
the whole Company, and the Advanced Technology Laboratories which
also works for the whole Company in the vital linking function of putting
new knowledge to practical use. _
Having centralized services of Research and Advanced Technology does
not mean that divisions or departments cannot set up their own R&D
operations, more or less specialized to their technical or market interests.
There are many such laboratories; e.g., in electronics, nuclear power, space
technology, polymer chemistry, jet engine technology, and so on.

Q. Doesn't such a variety of kinds of R&D hamper the Company’s potential

contribution? Don’t you find yourselves stepping on each other’s toes?

. On the contrary! With a great many engineers and scientists working

intensively on the problems they understand better than anyone else, we
go ahead simultaneously on many fronts. Our total effort is broadened.
Our central, Company-wide services in Research and Advanced Tech-
nology are enhanced by this variety of effort by individual departments.

. How is Advanced Technology Services organized?
. There are three Advanced Technology Laboratories: Chemical and

Materials Engineering, Electrical and Information Engineering, and Me-
chanical Engineering; and the Nuclear Materials and Propulsion Opera-
tion. The Laboratories do advanced technology work on their own, with
Company funds, and on contract to product departments or outside customers
and government agencies. NMPO works for the AEC and the military to
develop materials and systems for high-temperature, high-power, low-
weight nuclear reactors. ATS is the Company’s communication and in-
formation center for disseminating new technologies. It also plans and
develops potential new business areas for General Electric.

. So R&D at General Electric is the work of a great many men in a great

many areas?

. Of course. The world is going through a vast technological revolution—

in the ways men can handle energy, materials, and information. Our
knowledge is increasing exponentially. In the last ﬁve years we have
spent more than half the money ever spent for research and development.
To keep competitive, and to grow, industry must master that mountain of
new knowledge and ﬁnd ways to put it to practical use for mankind. Only
by knowing his ﬁeld well and keeping up with the rush of new develop-
ments, can the young engineer contribute to the growth of his industry-
and society as a whole.
