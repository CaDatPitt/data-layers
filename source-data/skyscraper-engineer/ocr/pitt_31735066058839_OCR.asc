Chemistry in Steelmaking?

You bet! Steelmaking is an extractive industry, and its chemical processes are many,
complex, and—to the trained mind—fascinating.

There are many opportunities for chemical engineers here at Bethlehem Steel,
the world’s second largest maker of steel and steel products.

Think of the blast furnace, where complex chemical reactions occur on a tre-
mendous scale. Same with both open-hearth and electric furnaces. These chemical
processes are complicated by the subtle variations in make-up of the materials used:
ore, limestone, scrap metal, alloys. And our coke ovens produce a variety of hydro-
carbon by-products.

 

Bethlehem oﬂers excellent career opportunities for men in virtually all
engineering curricula: metallurgical, electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil,
, I ‘ Economy mining, ceramic, architectural, and others. W e suggest that you discuss Bethlehem
, _ , yersa;//,'[y with your Placement Oﬂicer. And be sure to pick up a copy of our booklet,

editorial

During the last ﬁve years, the University of Pittsburgh,
under the administration of Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld, has undergone many changes. New buildings have
been erected, a new trimester program has been instituted,
and several new graduate programs have been added to
the curriculum. On the strength of this, it would appear
that Pitt has truly been a developing educational insti-
tution.

Actually, however, the revolution which has occurred
since the inauguration of Chancellor Litchﬁeld has been
more administrative and architectural than educational
and intellectual. The University has allocated vast sums
for the construction of parking garages, dormitory facili-
ties, and buildings for the professional schools. In addition,
many administrative positions have been created to pro-
vide for the management of the “new” Pitt. But despite
these signiﬁcant developments, there does not appear to be
a comprehensive plan for improving the quality of instruc-
tion, nor for the development of an atmosphere of critical
inquiry.

Improving the quality of instruction and developing an
atmosphere of intellectual inquiry are both, to a large ex-
tent, dependent on the development, recruitment, and re-
tention of a competent, professionally accomplished fac-
ulty. It is in this area of faculty development that the
Chancellor’s program has been weakest.

The problem is especially serious in the engineering and
natural science areas. Professional development of the
existing faculty through research and publication is hin-
dered by heavy course loads and the lack of adequate facili-
ties. The Mathematics Department has experienced nearly
a complete change of personnel in the last two years, while
several of the better engineering faculty members have re-
cently left the University for positions in industry or with
other educational institutions.

Although this problem of faculty development is not
restricted to the University of Pittsburgh, the fact that
other colleges and universities are experiencing similar dif-
ﬁculties does not mitigate the seriousness of the situation.

Expanded research facilities, lighter course loads, re-
duced administrative responsibilities, and merit salary in-
creases are needed if the engineering and science faculties
are to be given the vital opportunity for professional de-
velopment and if, most importantly, top quality faculty
are to be attracted. You do not raise the level of compe-
tency of a faculty, nor recruit additional top quality pro-
fessors with new dormitories and parking garages, how-
ever necessary they may be.

Unless Pitt’s architectural revolution is accompanied by
an educational revolution, the administration may ﬁnd
that students are being taught in modernistic classrooms
by professionally stunted faculty and that all the new
buildings are merely monuments to mediocrity.

NOTI:'S

This issue of the Skyscraper En-
gineer has many articles on varied
topics for the reader’s enjoyment.
The articles range in content from
modern strip mining techniques to
powdered metallurgy.

The featured article of this issue
is by Frank Linden Antisell and is
entitled “Way Out Ditchdigger.”
There is, however, no comparison
between an ordinary ditchdigger and
this digging machine described in
the article. This machine uses a new
concept in digging and transporting
large quantities of material.

“Powdered Metallurgy” by Ray
Gribshaw describes the new tech-
niques and products in powdered
metals technology. The article com-
pares the properties of powered met-
al parts with those produced by con-
ventional techniques, and discusses
the advantages and disadvantages of
powdered metallurgy.

Recently, a new engine idea has
been evolved and is now being test-
ed. The new engine, called the Wan-
kel Engine, is being produced and
tested by Curtis-Wright. Joe Sei-
fried explains the principle and per-
formance of this engine in his article
“The Rotor.”

Another novel idea is explained in
the article “Hydraulic Pickaxe” by
Wesley Pickard. Wesley tells how
high pressure water streams are be-
ing used to break coal and transport
the broken coal from the mine face.

In a different vein, Brian Hamil-
ton has written an interesting article
called “Custom Teaching.” In this
article, Brian tells how educators
have devised a machine that adjusts
the teaching rate to the ability of
each student to absorb the informa-
tion given by the machine. The ideas
and techniques used in the machine
are rather novel and perhaps will in.-
fluence the science of teaching in all
other applications too.

We’ve been told frequently that engineering graduates are attracted to a
company our size because of an honest and understandable desire to be
“a big ﬁsh in a little pond”. Perhaps others prefer to think of the future as
the challenge of “swimming up-stream”.

We believe that Sikorsky Aircraft is actually the “right-sized stream” for
young engineers who would enjoy diversiﬁed, small—group activities, as
well as stature opportunities in a ﬁeld that is not limited nor professionally
conﬁning. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the modern
helicopter; and our ﬁeld today is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.

Because of this, we can offer stimulating experiences i11 an ideal environ-
ment. Work associations could include joining an electronic team of twenty
to thirty associates—or—working with a highly selective group of four or
ﬁve on interesting problems of radiation, instrumentation, auto pilotage,
automatic stabilization, etc.

And what of your future?

That, of course, involves your own potential for growth. As
a far-sighted company, we’re more than willing to help you
meet the challenge of “going up—stream”!

new areas of interest enhance careers
for engineers and scientists at Hamilton Standard

HAMILTON STANDARD DIVISION of United

dynamic force in the aircraft equipment
ﬁeld . . . with an unmatched record of
stability and accomplishment. Typical of
Hamilton Standard’s achievements are en-
vironmental conditioning systems which
are standard equipment on such aircraft
as the 1400 mph Convair B-58 Hustler
Bomber. Fast moving advances in space
technology, however, pose new problems
. . . new challenges.

TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES Hamilton
Standard is conducting advanced research
and development on environmental control
problems for manned space vehicles. The
Moon Room pictured at right was speciﬁ-
cally designed to assist engineers and
scientists in identifying and analyzing the
practical problems involved in CO2 re-
generation. However, within such sealed
experimental chambers studies can be con-

ducted to develop means of removing or
regenerating body heat, water vapor, nitro-
gen and other contaminants given off by
man in a space vehicle. Several possibilities
exist for effecting each phase of control in
an environmental control system. For ex-‘
ample, CO2 can be removed by the freeze-
out method, chemical absorption, physical
adsorption and diffusion or ﬁltration of
molecules. Consideration of the space en-
velope and the weight of equipment must
be made. In the case of CO2 this involves
heat exchangers, regenerators, water sepa-
rators, blowers, valves and vents. Need for
secondary electrical power supplies to
operate equipment creates additional
problems.

OBVIOUSLY, UNDERTAKINGS of this nature
involve the utilization of a wide variety of
engineering and scientiﬁc ﬁelds of study

Production of various mineral deposits by stripping has
become important in recent years. Seams near the surface,
which are inaccessible by underground methods because of
thinness of seams and roof conditions, are successfully strip-
ped. In stripping operations, equipment with high capacities
are essential for economical removal of overburden and
intermediate waste layers. In many open pit mines, it is also
desirable to be able to separate overburden, various grades
of coal, and waste strata, as in the brown coal mining in-
dustry of Western Germany.

This job could only be achieved by a bucket wheel ex-
cavator, and the proposed working depths, as much as 820
ft., led to sizes of machinery which were hitherto unknown.
The first giant bucket wheel, which was designed by the
Lubeck Works of Orenstein-Koppel Und Lubecker Maschin-
enbau, was commissioned in 1955.

Bucket wheel excavators were developed in the early
thirties for excavating overburden and brown coal in the
large German open pit mines. Since then, their operating
economies have led to their adoption in many other parts
of the world.

The excavating wheel consists of a series of buckets at-
tached to a driven wheel ring, which in turn rotates around
the wheel body. Knives are fixed to both outside edges of
the driven wheel, which together with high wheel speeds,

livering excavated material from discharge boom in an almost

produce a favorable cutting effect even in hard soil. The
peripheral surface of the wheel body, up to the point of
bucket discharge, is enclosed by a chute. The excavated
material is drawn along the chute surface by the buckets
to the point of discharge where the chute -ends and the
material falls onto a rotary table._ The back of the buckets
are cleaned by scraper stars, three pronged wheels, which
are kept in operation by the motion of the wheel.

A few technical details may convey an idea of the size

of these machines:

Effective daily output: |30,795 cu. yd. solids
Diameter of bucket wheel: 52 ft. 6 m.
Number of buckets: I0
Bucket capacity: 2.35 cu. yd. each
Revolutions of bucket

wheel per minute: 5.4
Maximum length in

stretched position:
Maximum height above ground level: 2|6 ft.
Width of belts: 7 ft. II in. — 8 ft. 6 in.
Surface area of the I2 crawler tracks: 437 sq. yd.
Service weight: 6000 metric tons

The machines have 118 motors and an installed power of
approximately 7,800 KW. The power supply voltage is
25 KV.

The rotary table revolves horizontally within the ver-
tical wheel and serves to transfer the discharge from the
buckets to the boom belt. The wheel itself is mounted on a
movable boom which permits it to be raised or lowered; on

623 it.

some models the boom can also be thrust forward or re-
tracted. The maximum cutting height is 164: ft. and the cut-
ting depth is 66 ft. The outreach of the bucket wheel is 302
ft. and the loading belt conveyor outreach is 121 ft. An im-
portant feature of the LMG design is that the digging wheel
boom and the belt conveyor discharge boom rotate inde-
pendently on a common base. Thus, the excavated material
can be discharged at the same point on a field belt conveyor
while the wheel boom is rotating through its digging range.
With this design it is possible to work large areas before it
becomes necessary to move the portable field belt. The field
belt is a conveyor belt which isiused as a economical method
of moving excavated material out of the mining area in-
stead of using a railroad spur line.

The bucket wheel boom’s conveyor belt transfer the
discharge to the loading belt at the main carriage. The
transfer belt then carries the discharge material to a field
belt conveyor or dumps it into coal cars if a railroad spur
line is used. The discharge rate is nearly equivalent to filling
300 sixty tone coal cars or 13,000 cu. yds., per hour.

The main carriage is a self-propelled, crawler mounted
base located between the two ends of the bucket wheel boom,
and at the base of the discharging boom.

The bucket wheels dig continuously and deliver a
steady flow of material. For this reason there are no periods
of intermittent high loads and as a result, narrower conveyor
belts can be used for better economy. The open pit mining in

West Germany points out the outstanding conveyor belt sys-
tems used with bucket wheel excavators. When compared
with conventional U.S. systems son1e of these foreign in-
stallations appear to be of advanced design. _

The Denny Hill regrade project No. 2 in Seattle during
1929-31 was the grand daddy of belt conveyor systems used
as a means of transportation for excavated materials on a
construction project. The Link-Belt Company furnished the
conveyor for hauling the excavated materials over a _half
mile from the excavation site through downtown Seattle
to the dock, from which the spoil was towed into the bay
for disposal. Thus, it is only natural that conveyor belts
have found use in later earth-moving applications.

A few large construction projects using belt conveyors
were the Shasta, Anderson Ranch, and Hungry Horse dams.
The Shasta system, consisting of 26 individual conveyors,
was 9.6 miles long and delivered 10 million tons of aggre-
gates to the dam over a period of four years.

Some advantages of a conveyor belt for transfer of ‘

excavated materials are: high conveying capacities, relative
portability, high belt speeds (500 to 1200 ft. per minute),
and the ability to follow terrain without extensive roadbed
preparations. The opportunity for long distance belt trans-
portation is well exemplified by the 51/2 mile permanent
cross-country belt conveyor for Ideal Cement Company at
Ada, Oklahoma connecting the cement mill and quarry.
One of the seven flights is the longest individual belt

conveyor ever built. The 11,766 ft. belt travels at 500 ft. per
minute, carrying 1,000 tons of material per hour and making
ten round trips in an eight hour day.

A single push button in the cement mill control room
puts the entire 551/2 mile system system in operation. The
belts are started automatically, in sequence, beginning with
the last belt. Each belt starts when the preceding one reaches
approximately half speed, for minimum start-up time. The
cycle is reversed to unload the system, which each successive
belt stopping in progression toward the mill end. In the
event of power failure or any stopping of the system while
it is fully loaded, each belt, in sequence, has been engineered
to coast for successively longer distances, preventing a mate-
rial build up at transfer points.

All of the belts in the transport system are 36 in. wide
and run at approximately 500 ft. a minute.

The takeups involved considerable ingenuity——arrang-
ing the sheaves, pulleys and sliding carriages to accommo-
date the belt elongation that occurs under various conditions
of loading and starting.

The system, which was designed, built, and erected by
Link-Belt Company, is protected with numerous safety de-
vices. These include metal detectors, head and tail drift
switches, belt-slip switches, and take-up overtravel switches.
All safety devices show as lights on the control panel, and the
system cannot operate unless all circuits are closed.

The decision to construct a conveyor belt for raw ma-
terial transportation was the result of a economic survey to
determine the best method of moving the estimated 90 year
supply of limestone and shale. Though higher in first cost,
it would prove less expensive over a period of years than
any other type of haulage.

Principal considerations were reliability of service, low
operating costs, and reasonable capital investment and
write-off period.

The combination of the conveyor belt transportation
and the bucket wheel excavators should bring new levels of
capacity to the American open mining industry C

DISCUSSION OF
HIGH PRESSURE y
MINING TECHNIQUES

“The softest thing in the world dashes against and over-
comes the hard'est. There is nothing in the world softer or
weaker than water, and‘ yet for attacking things that are
firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence
to it ”
lthough this statement was written by the great Lao-
tze, a philpsopher who lived before Confucius, it is quite ap-
propriate here. This paper deals with the hydraulic mining
of coal from its evolution to present-day research.
Russia began mining hydraulically in 1918, when she
mined and transported peat with water. Ten years later,
I overburden was removed hydraulically from a seam of brown
coal. However, these are isolated examples. In 1935, Russia
designed and put into operation a complete hydraulic mining
system on an experimental basis in an attempt to increase
coal production without increasing manpower. In this sys-
tem, the kinetic energy of the water broke the coal and the
water stream carried the coal through flumes built on the
sides of the entry.
When these experiments showed this method favorable,
a Russian expert designed a complete hydraulic coal mine.
A shaft was sunk from which entries were driven on a 5-per-
cent grade into the 50-inch coal seam. The -coal was broken
from the face by a water jet, and then flumed to a main
sump. Here the plus 14-inch coal was raised in skips, while
the minus 14-inch coal was pumped to the surface. Output
reached 6,000 metric tons per month, while production
reached 5.5 to 6.0 metric tons per manshift. Although these
tests were interrupted‘ by the war, they showed that the
method had promise.
Immediately following the war, Russia intensified her
hydraulic research, establishing a special institute to deal
with hydraulic mining problems. The institute first devised
a hardness factor ranging from 0.3 for wet soil to 20.0 for
basalt. Applying the above factor, the institute developed a
formula to determine the pressure necessary to hydraulically
mine various materials. The equation is P = fH; where P is

I2

pressure in atmosphere; f = 50, a constant; and H is the
previously devised hardness factor. The institute also has de-
veloped formulae to determine energy expended in breaking
coal and nozzle productivity in tons per hour.

The Russians first commercial hydraulic mine opened
in 1952. The coal, pitching on an angle of 65 degrees, av-
eraged 33 feet in thickness. The mine was developed on
levels driven off main shafts upward at 5-degree angles. On
each level, rooms were driven up at 5-degree angles on 18-
foot centers with crosscuts connecting every 80 feet. The
levels were connected by hanging wall on footwall raises
driven every 250 feet. The hanging wall raises were used for
transportation of men and supplies, while the footwall raises
transported the coal-water mixture.

Actual mining is done with a hydromonitor consisting
of a barrel and nozzle, either %- or 1-inch diameter. The

hydromonitor is is placed 4 to 6 feet from the face against
which water is pumped through the nozzle. Jet action pro-
duces cracks in the coal which are penetrated by the water,
breaking the coal from the face. This mine reached a pro-
duction of 600 tons per shift, 6 times greater than the average
production for conventional equipment mining in the same
area. Recovery after a 1.5-year period was 88 percent, again
considerably greater than conventional mining; while costs
were reduced 50 percent.

In retreat mining, the method used to mine the greatest
percentage of the coal, the monitor sits in the entry under
firm roof and mines first to the left and then to the right of
the entry. The coal is washed out, allowing the roof to cave
behind it. Since loading machines are eliminated, no man
need advance beyond the safe entry ; improving both percent
recovery and safety. Steps 1, 2, and 3 in diagram 2 show
the pattern for pillar recovery. Roof line is controlled effec-
tively as shown by staggering the retreat cuts.

Throughout numerous translations studied, one obvious
weakness of the Russian method appeared. The Russians do
not mine hydraulically from a solid face, but they drill and
shoot holes in the face before applying the hydraulic method.
Their water pressure reaches 550 pounds per square inch,
which is far below the minimum pressure required to cut
coal in the United States. Although costs were cut consid-
ably, as previously stated, the elimination of cutting and
shooting would reduce costs even further.

New Zealand is another pioneer in hydraulic mining.
Fluming coal from the mine to roadways began there in
1920, 2 years after the first Russian experiments. Actual
mining started in 1927-, when water under pressure was used
to recover pillars. No further advancements in hydraulic
mining were made until 1954, when the New Zealand States
Mining Department built installations to study methods of
hydraulic mining.

In this system, the water head produces the water pres-
sure. This is in contrast to the Russian method where the
head is produced by pumps. Water flows into the mine by
gravity through a 30-inch pipe to the main adit, where 12-
inch pipes carry the water to the main entries. Pipes, 4 to 6
inches, then take the water to the working faces. Pressures
here range between 40. to 82 pounds per square inch.

Coal is mined on retreat from blocks. Rooms and cross-
cuts are driven on 66-foot centers. Splits are driven in the
blocks which are mined in a manner similar to that employed
by the Russians.

As in Russia, this system is inadequate for our applica-
tion because of drilling and preshooting. These two coun-
tries, as reports indicate, are not mining hydraulically in the
truest sense. They seem merely to be sluicing or washing the
preshot coal away from the face. This is not as applicable
here, for shooting is expensive and dangerous, while our
coal seams generally do not pitch as much as those of Russia
or New Zealand.

Here in the United States, hydraulic mining has been
carried on for the past 5 years without preshootin-g. The
American Gilsonite Company of Bonanza, Utah, has been
mining gilsonite, a solidified hydrocarbon or asphaltite, com-
pletely by hydraulic methods. Gilsonite occurs in a vertical

seam ranging from a few inches to 22 feet in thickness, with
depths _up to 2,000 feet.

An air-powered, track-mounted vehicle is outfitted with-

hydralic booms and nozzles, which carry the water. The
upper boom carries water at 2,000 pounds per square inch,
82 gallons per minute, which is directed against the gilsonite
face through a 14-inch diameter nozzle. This water mines
the gilsonite while water passing through the lower boom at
350 gallons per minute washes the mined ore to a receiving
pocket. The cutting rate per nozzle is 25 to 30 tons per hour.

Before hydraulic mining, gilsonite had been mined by
hand and pneumatic picking, cardox blasting, air blasting,
and blasting with permissible dynamite. It was so hard to
blast that 1 pound of powder in an 8-inch vein could break
only 2 tons of gilsonite. Hydraulic mining methods have re-
sulted in easier mining, reduced expenditures, increased pro.
duction, increased profits, and increased safety.

In an effort to keep up to date with the latest mining
methods, the U.S. Bureau of Mines undertook a research
program to determine if coal could be mined economically
from a solid face. The Bureau leased a mining site 12 miles
west of Indiana, Pa., from the Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal
Company. The coal is in the Pittsburgh seam, flat-lying, 65
inches thick, and has 2 shale partings 2 to 3 inches thick
which occur 18 and 44 inches below the draw slate. The
coal is overlain by 10 inches of draw slate.

From studies of both foreign and gilsonite operations,
Bureau engineers decided they would need at least 3,000
pounds per square inch pressure; preferably 4,000 pounds per
square inch, for effective mining. To provide this pressure,
they purchased a Wilson-Snyder triplex plunger pump capa-
ble of delivering 300 gallons per minute at 4,000. pounds per
square inch pressure. To drive the pump, a 900-horsepower
Bessemer-Cooper diesel engine was obtained from Navy
surplus. To get the water from the pump to the working
face, 4-inch double extra heavy seamless carbon steel pipe is
used. Welding neck flanges with tongue and groove facings
connect the pipe. The flanged pipe was safety tested at 8,000
pounds per square inch pressure.

The monitor is built from a 2-inch double extra heavy
pipe. It has a nozzle holder on the outlet end and a high-
pressure Chiksan swivel joint threaded onto the inlet end.

VIEW OF THE PIPELINE which carries high pressure water
to the hydraulic nozzle assembly.

A 1-inch diameter high-pressure hose, also tested at 8,000
pounds per square inch pressure, connects the Chiksen to the
end of the high-pressure pipeline. To allow for handling by
an operator, an offset T handle, 6 feet long, is welded to the
monitor.

The monitor is mounted on an 11-foot horizontal bar
fastened at each end with U-bolts to a modified screw tim-
ber jack. Numerous holes in the jacks permit raising and
lowering of the bar. Extra timber jacks are set against the
back of the bar, 1 foot from each end, as a safety precaution
should a U-bolt work loose.

A conical base welded to a ring through which the
monitor slides fit into a saddle on the horizontal bar per-
mitting both horizontal and vertical motion of the monitor.

The operator wears a rubberized suit, shin guards, and
a face shield. A bullet-proof glass shield hung overhead pro-
tects him from spray and flying particles.

Getting the water into and out of the mine involves sev-
eral steps. A small centrifugal pump picks up water from a
concrete reservoir adjoining the pump house and discharges
this water in the suction line of the high-pressure pump. The
high-pressure pump then discharges the water through a
bypass valve back into the reservoir. By closi.ng the bypass
valve, water is directed into the pipeline under pressures up
to 4,000 pounds per square inch, adjustable at the bypass
valve. To show why the bypass valve is necessary, consider
this typical case. A 14-inch diameter nozzle at pressure of
4,000 pounds per square inch will permit approximately 116
gallons to flow each minute. Since the centrifugal pump de-
livers 300 gallons each minute, 184 gallons of water recircu-
late each minute. In a short time, the high-pressure pump
would become dangerously overheated. '

Initial tests were run to determine the most effective
cutting pattern. Various methods, including a top cut, a rib
shear, and haphazard cuts were tried, but the most efficient
proved to be:

1. Undercut 14 inches high, 6 to 8 feet deep, with
monitor set 10 inches from the floor.

2. Top cut, 52 inches high, 6 to 8 feet deep, with
monitor set at 34 inches from the floor.

3. Draw slate, 10 inches thick, 6 to 8 feet deep,
with monitor set at 40 inches from the floor.

I4

Using this cutting pattern, cuts 66 inches high, 12 feet wide,
and 6 to 8 feet deep, were made in 20 minutes, as compared
with as much as 35 to 40 minutes for other methods.

Through the above tests, the engineers determined a
general cutting rate for the various nozzles tested. The 1/3-
inch diameter nozzle produced little cutting. The %;-inch
diameter nozzle mined at "a rate of 0.5 tons per minute, while
the %-inch diameter nozzle was even better——mining at a
rate of 0.75 ton per minute. Using a 1/2-inch diameter noozle,
only 3,300 pounds per square inch pressure could be reached
at 300 gallons per minute and, at this pressure, cutting rate
was not as rapid as that of the %-inch nozzle at 4,000 psi.
These cuts were made on face cleats, butt cleats, and at 45-
degree angle to both, indicating that the direction of cleav-
age has no effect on the cutting rate.

Tests involving nozzle design were conducted also. On
the theory that a compact stream has more cutting force
than one which is disperse, a nozzle design was sought which
could keep the stream as compact as possible. The nozzles
used have two basic geometric components, a conical section
with the apex toward the discharge end, and a straight cylin-
drical section at the discharge end. The straight section was
graduated in length according to its diameter. For the My
inch diameter nozzles, the straight sections vary from O-D
(no straight section) to 6-D (1.5 inches straight). Using both
Mr and %3-inch nozzles, the following procedure was fol-
lowed: The monitor was set so that it could move vertically
only. A vertical slot was cut with high pressure for 10 sec-
onds. This was repeated 11 times. After the 12, 10-second
cuts, the monitor cut for an additional 5 minutes, all in the
same slot. This procedure was carried out on all nozzles at
pressures of 3,000 and 4,000 pounds per square inch.

The tests showed that the %-inch diameter nozzle cuts
better than the %;,-inch diameter nozzle; that 4,000 pounds
per square inch pressure produces better cutting than 3,000
pounds per square inch; and that most cutting was done in
the first 10 seconds. The testing engineers noted no appre-
ciable difference in cutting between varying lengths of
straight cylindrical section or varying angle of taper in the
conical section of the nozzle. From the above information,
the following general conclusions were drawn:

1. Cutting rate varies directly as pressure.
2. Cutting rate varies directly as nozzle diameter.
3. Cutting rate varies inversely as distance from coal

face.
4. Cutting rate is independent of length of straight

cylindrical section or angle of taper within the nozzle.

These conclusions, however, are not definite, for each
nozzle was tested just once, while the hardness of coal was
not constant. for each test. More tests must be made before
any meaningful relations can be drawn.

The future of commercial hydraulic mining is uncer-
tain. Results from overseas and from the Bureau of Mines
experiments indicate that coal can be mined in this manner,
but whether or not this method can compete economically
with present mining methods has yet to be determined. Many
persons in the mining industry hope that hydraulic mining
will permit the recovery of coal that would otherwise have
been too difficult or too costly to mine.

A NEW CONCEPT OF EN_§INE_DESIQN:

THE ROTOR ENGINE

ITS OPERATION AND ADVANTAGES

Centuries ago, the simple principle of a piston moving
up and down in a cylinder was utilized to_ produce power.
It has remained to this day as the prime means of obtaining
power for combustion. Until now, it has been the quest of
engineers and inventors to find a new design without the
inherent faults of vibration and complexity. Vibration has
been the downfall of many designs, although, in many cases,
the engines were much lighter, smaller and more powerful
than the piston engine.

The problem has been to design an engine that would
be of the positive displacement type, like the piston engine,
but without its two major faults, an elaborate valve mech-
anism and a reciprocating weight. The Rotor engine, an
invention announced by Curtiss-Wright and NSU (known
chiefly as a motorcycle manufacturer) of West Germany
late last year, has all of these characteristics.

The Rotor engine has only three basic parts: rotor,
crankshaft and enclosing casing. Two of these move: the
rotor turns on the crankshaft journal while the crankshaft
revolves; the casing encloses these moving parts. The intake
and exhaust ports are simply holes in the casing and no
valve mechanism is required; the rotor itself opens and closes
the ports, functioning as a valve, as well as a driving com-
ponent.

The heart of the Rotor engine is the rotor. Its unique
motion is the foundation of the design. The rotor is tri-
angular, and as it turns, its three vertices follow the con-
tour of the casing wall, staying only a few thousandths of
an inch away from it. In each vertex, metal inserts, forced
against the casing wall by springs, stay in contact with the
wall to seal each chamber. The rotor turns on the crank-
shaft journal and, at the same time, about a stationary gear
in “hula-hoop” fashion. The stationary gear is on the casing
side and engages a larger -gear inside the rotor. The ratio of
these gears is 2:3. Each time the rotor center revolves
about the stationary gear center, the engaged teeth permit
one-third revoluion of the rotor; thus, three revoluions of
the crankshaft are required to rotate the rotor once on the
journal.

The casing is oval shaped to accommodate the varying
distance between each rotor vertex and the center of the
crankshaft that is at the symetrical center of the casing. As
the crankshaft turns three times faster than the rotor, the
distance from the crankshaft center to the journal center
(known as stroke in the piston engine) is alternately added
to or subtracted from the distance between the vertex
and journal center. The distance from the center of the
crankshaft, then, is at a minimum as it passes the waist of

Curtis-Wright calls it a “Rotating
Combustion Engine.” Having pur-
chased patent rights from NSU, they
are developing it at their Wood-
Ridge, New Jersey, plant.

The RC2-602 is similar to the model
pictured here, but it has two “com-
bustion units.” Its specifications are
as- follows: a displacement of 60.85
cu. in. per “combustion unit,” a com-
pression ratio of 8.14 to 1, has a
maximum torque of 212 ft. lb. at 3500
rpm, and “rated power” is 200 hp at
5500 rpm. It is smaller than any en-
gine with the same hp: length is
21.4 inches; width, 20.3; and height,
22. The weight of 343 lbs., although
not spectacular, is impressive.

the casing and maximum after rotating ninety degrees.
The balanced rotor rotating on the journal creates no

‘vibration. The rotor, though, rotating about the crankshaft

center, would vibrate if left unchecked. This offset weight is
easily balanced by a counterweight opposite the journal and
turning with the crankshaft outside the casing. Thus, perfect
balance is maintained for the only moving parts.

The triangular rotor in the casing forms three separate
chambers, and when the crankshaft is rotating the volume
of each is either decreasing or increasing. This displacement
change is analogous to a piston moving up and down in a
cylinder, and allows power to be derived from a burning fuel-
air mixture, by letting it expand and expend its energy.

This engine, despite the fact that one chamber fires each
revolution, is four cycle; for each chamber goes through the
four processes of intake (of a fuel-air charge), compression
(of the charge), power (expansion of the burning charge)
and exhaust (expulsion of the burned charge). Each cham-
ber is in a different cycle, and it takes three rotations of the
crankshaft to rotate the chamber through four cycles.

Following one of the chambers, beginning with the intake
cycle, the chamber volume begins to increase as the intake
port in the casing wall is uncovered, or opened by a rotor
vertex. The increasing volume creates a vacuum in the

chamber and atmospheric pressure forces a fuel-air charge
into it. As the chamber volume begins to decrease the intake

port is closed and compression begins. Slightly before the
chamber is an minimum volume the spark plug is fired, ig-
niting the compressed charge. When the chamber reaches
minimum volume the power cycle begins. The pressure, cre-
ated by the now almost completely burned charge, forces
the rotor to rotate as the chamber volume increases. As the
chamber volume approaches a maximum an exhaust port
is opened and the burned fuel-air charge escapes through
it. The remaining gases are forced out by the decreasing
volume. The exhaust port is closed when the chamber vol-
ume is at a minimum, and the intake port is opened to begin
another four cycles in the chamber. In the meantime, the
other two chambers have gone through four cycles; one of
the chambers fires during each revolution of the crankshaft.

There are advantages in the induction system that are
not inherent in the piston engines: the charge velocity in the
intake port passage is relatively constant, and there is no
valve head to create turbulence and redirect the flow. In the
Rotor engine the ports open directly to the chambers, and
valve timing is accomplished by the turning rotor. As a ver-
tex of the rotor passes over the port it is opened to the
chamber following the vertex, beginning the intake cycle in
that chamber. At the end of» the cycle, the vertex following
the chamber passes over the port, in effect closing it and, at
the same time, opens the port to the next chamber, beginning
another intake cycle.

The result is an uninterrupted flow of fuel-air charge,
its velocity through the port remaining relatively constant.
This effect is true at all rpm’s, and delayed timing (used in
the piston engine) would not be advantageous because the
momentum of the charge is used to fill the following cham-
ber.

This effect and no restricting over the port opening re-
sults in an increase in volumetric efficiency over the com-
plete rpm range; the most increase being at low and high

I9

These curves are for a 250 cc NSU Rotor engine and bear out
many of the points made in the text. Even with a relatively
low compression ratio of 8.0 to 1, this engine developes 3 hp
per cu. in. Note that hp increases at an almost constant rate
and is still rising at maximum power. This suggests that
more power can be obtained by extending the stress li_mits;
volumetric efficiency, near 95% at 9,000 rpm, is there to be
taken advantage of. One test engine developed 13 hp at 16,000
rpm for 100 hours-, so continued development will probably in-
crease the maximum rpm. This engine was tested in a Prinz
and gave 37 miles per gallon at 50 mph. It is similar to the

engine pictured below.

rpm. In fact, some test engines have no peak hp, apparently
hp is limited by thermal and mechanical stresses.

A major problem, that must be solved before produc-
tion, is sealing the chambers. This problem arises from the
fact that it is difficult to maintain an oil film on the casing
wall to lubricate the sealing inserts. Test engines have run
successfully with oil mixed in the fuel; but this impairs the
efficiency. A more elaborate and effective means is now be-
ing developed.

The lubrication problem is now close to being solved

and refinements are being made. An engine has already been
successfully tried in a car. Curtiss-Wright Corporation has
paid a huge sum for development and patent rights, expecta-
tions are high, and it is hoped that production will begin in
1961. For cars it will not only be more efficient, but simpler,
offering long dependable service. With the Rotor engine, the
troublesome valve system is eliminated and all that is left is
a combustion chamber and a minimum of moving parts. The
Rotor engine is a new concept of engine design and a substi-
tution for the century-old piston.

In ancient China they “piped” water through hollow bamboo
sections, but they couldn’t shut it off. One day a workman
with an engineering mind bored a hole in a plug and ﬁtted
it into holes in the pipe. This was the ﬁrst plug valve.

Centuries later, the brilliant young mathematician and
scientist, Blaise Pascal, worked out the principle of hydraulics
for which he is famous: “A unit pressure applied to a liquid
contained in a sealed vessel is transmitted to every part of the
liquid with undiminished force.”

In 1914, Sven Nordstrom, a young mining engineer, had
trouble with sticking, leaking valves on the acid lines at a
silver mine. By combining the plug cock idea of the ancient
Chinese with Pasca1’s principle of hydraulics, he created a
new idea in ﬂow control: the lubricated plug valve.

Today, the Rockwell-Nordstrom lubricated plug valve is
widely used in the petroleum and natural gas industries, in
chemical processing, and in general manufacturing. Its eﬁi-
ciency helps cut the cost of many of the things you use every
day. And thanks to hundreds of engineering advances, the
original lubricated plug valve is still the most modern.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like
to work for, buy from, and invest in.

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.

Back in 1925, when Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the ﬁrst of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.

That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&WA today.

The ﬁeld, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company’s requirements
conﬁned to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt & Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of ﬂight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.

Speciﬁcally, what would you do?—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can ﬂourish.

For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,
Engineering Department, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft,
East Hartford 8, Connecticut.

At P&WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this live mock-up
of a reactor, nuclear scientists and engineers can
determine critical mass, material reactivity coefficients,
control effectiveness and other reactor parameters.

 

Representative of electronic aids functioning for P&WA
engineers is this on-site data recording center which
can provide automatically recorded and computed
data simultaneously with the testing of an engine. This
equipment is capable of recording l,200 different
values per second.

 

Studies of solar energy collection and liquid and vapor
power cycles typify P&WA's research in advanced
space auxiliary power systems. Analytical and Experi-
mental Engineers work together in such programs to
establish and test basic concepts.

BY RAYMOND GRIBSC HAW

Powder Metallurgy is an excellent saver of time, energy,
and money. Specifically, it is the process whereby metallic
.shapes are manufactured from metallic powders. It involves
the pressing of finely powdered metal into a die of the
desired shape and then treating (sintering) the resulting
compact to cause the individual particles to weld together.
It is significant to note that this process is not new. In
fact, the early Incas made crude shapes from platinum
powders many moons ago. The first modern application of
the process is the making of filaments for incandescent lamps.
The choice of preparation used for any powder is of
the utmost importance. The methodof preparation can
control the powder’s shape, size, density, and cohesion prop-
erties. This will effect the finished product to a great degree.
The most widely used method of preparation is the reduc-
tion of oxides. Since oxides are generally brittle, they are
easily powdered. However, powders can also be produced
from materials that industry would normally waste. Ore
fines, mill scale, and certain rusts can be used successfully in
the preparation of powders. Even scrap has found a place
as a cheap raw material for powder metallurgy. The particle
size encountered in the powder ranges from four-tenths to
one ten~thousands of a millimeter. This accounts for the
fact that metallic and non-metallic powders can be mixed
to obtain nearly unlimited characteristics in the finished
product.

may be compacted to form the desired shape. The molding
of high-strength parts is usually done in hydraulic presses
capable of exerting pressures of forty to sixty tons per
square inch. However, normal parts are subjected to much
lower pressures.

Sintering is the heating of the cold welded metal pow-
der. This function allows more freedom for the atoms in the
crystals, giving them an opportunity to recrystallize and
remedy the cold deformation or distortion within the cold
pressed part. This operation insures a 100 per cent weld.
Time and money are saved since there are usually no addi-
tional steps and the product is ready for use.

New areas for application of high strength parts are
opened up with the advent of “prealloyed steel powders.”

pletely alloyed by melting. The molten metal is then atom-
ized directly into tiny droplets or particles. Parts using this
innovation exhibit high tensile strength, increased wearing
resistance and toughness. Alloys with high carbon content
can be produced which have excellent workability character-
istics. Many other “specialty” alloys that are usually too
brittle for conventional working can easily be worked after
using this powder metallurgy technique. Of course, powder
metallurgy is not a “cure all” for industry’s needs. There are
many problems——and many answers. They said metal bars
and strips of large cross sections could not be made in un-
limited lengths by powder techniques. But an entirely new
process developed at Westinghouse has adequately solved
this problem. An unprecedented automation system can
now be set up, capable of producing bars of unlimited length
that can be fed directly into a sintering furnace, and then to
ordinary processing steps such as rolling. Many cross-sec-
tional shapes and sizes can be produced with this new proc-
ess. As increasingly lower-cost powder materials become
available, this continuous compaction process will provide
economical large scale production of common metals and
alloys directly from powders.

There are other industries that have noticed the useful-
ness of powder techniques. Copperweld Company has been
making wire and rods for a long time that have a steel core
and a copper coating. When they tried to use the same tech-
nique for putting an aluminum coating on steel, they were
confronted with many problems. Today they have a secret
patent for a process that uses aluminum powder to obtain
their finished product. Metal powders are even used in to-
day’s missile fuels. Metal powders can occupy much less
space within the rocket. They require no auxiliary equip-
ment such as pumps and controls. In addition, burning rates
can be controlled by their textures, and they stay mixed
with their oxidizing agents until they are burned.

Although powders are used in many diverse fields, fifty
per cent of the powder consumption goes for structural parts.
When we think of structural parts in large quantities, we
naturally think of stampings. But powder metallurgy can
even compete favorably with certain stampings of thin
parts without lugs at right angles to the pressing plane. It is

important for every engineer to know that powder tech-
niques afford nearly an 80 per cent saving in the cost of
many items. In the future, we may see the extrusion of
many complex metal parts. Research has finally solved most
of the production problems in extruding shapes from pow-
ders. However, we will not see this innovation until the prop-
erties are enhanced and the cost of extrusion lowered.
Can powder metallurgy ever compete with the new
high strength steels? In some cases the results have been
excellent. Tungsten wire produced by powder metallurgy
techniques can have the almost unbelievable strength of
850,000 pounds per square inch. This is double the strength
of any high strength steel produced today. The 1961 auto-
mobiles exhibit a large increase in use of powdered metal
parts due to the availability of extremely high physical and
mechanical properties. New oil retaining, self-lubricating
bearings are being produced exhibiting close tolerances,
longer life, and more quiet operation. High strength gears are
manufactured which have precision tolerances, improved
finishes, decreased wear, and above all—decreased cost.
The cost factor has been due to the efficiency of the

28

machines. Some parts are made 200 times faster with fea-
tures impossible to obtain by standard manufacturing meth-
ods. Mechanical presses can produce parts at rates of 300 to
30,000 parts per hour. This has accounted for the phenom-
enal growth of the powder industry in recent years. Iron
powder consumption alone has jumped from 2 million
pounds in 1943, to 57 million pounds in 1957. When we
consider that powder products are used in electron tubes,
timing devices, lamp bulbs, cams, bearings, appliances, re-
lays, and other low-weight products, we can estimate the
wide extent of the usage of powder metal parts.

It seems inevitable that as powdered parts increase in
size, huge presses will be necessary to cold-press the parts.
However, the development of new techniques, in particular
“hot pressing” methods, have permitted considerably lower
pressures than those used in cold pressing. In some instances,
the pressure required in hot pressing amounts to only three
to five percent of that required for the same material in
cold pressing.

It would be sheer folly to offer anything but favorable
predictions regarding the future possibilities of powder
metallurgy. In the fields where other methods still compete
with powder metallurgy, the probable availability of inex-
pensive powders, as well as the expected improvement in
engineering properties, will increase the application of pow-
der metallurgical products. The improvement of engineering
qualities will lead to products superior to those manufac-
tured by other methods, and will bring more and more
materials into the class of those which can be produced
exclusively by powder metallurgy. Newer fields of applica-
tion will be opened as our advancing technology demands
materials which exhibit high strength at higher temperatures.

Naturally, there are many limitations to the powder
metallurgy process, but these disavantages are far outweigh-
ed by its numerous advantages in the right applications. It is
up to the engineer to determine which process obtains a
cheaper, more efficient, longer lasting product.

The educational system of the United States has
been under close scrutiny for several years. This situa-
tion has been underlined in red ink by the significant
advances made recently by the Soviet Union in several
areas of technology, including the field of rocketry. Re-
sponsible citizens of this country have finally felt an
uneasiness over the frequently observed fact that our
schools are producing graduates whose education, if it
exists, is inconsequential and superficial. Considering the
time spent in school by the average American student,
this is not only disturbing from the utilitarian stand-
point; it is a horribly inefficient use of school facilities
and teachers, both of which are in short supply. The
future promises no easing of this shortage, but a steadily
dwindling ratio of teachers to students.

To give any sort of consideration to the people de-
siring education, the classroom must become more effi-
cient. The teacher who tries to teach algebra to twenty
or thirty students of widely varying interests, back-
grounds, and abilities needs no explanation of why this
current system is inefficient. He cannot present the ma-
terial fast enough to interest his brighter students. He
cannot go slowly enough to interest the slower students.
Too often, class time is spent patiently explaining a
point for the benefit of only one student. Several class
periods must be used for testing. The result is that the
course is taught in “lock step” fashion, frustrating nearly
everybody and holding the interest of few.

To meet the need for better quality and improved
efficiency in education, psychologists have developed
“teaching machines.” Not to be confused with audio-
visual aids, these machines do more than simply present
material to be learned. To use a teaching machine the
student must actively participate in each step of the
learnin-g process. As each bit of instruction is presented,
the student must make a response. If he makes the
proper response, he finds out immediately, This rein-
forces his understanding and holds his interest. If he re-
sponds incorrectly, he must repeat that step. Thus, the
student must know all the preceding material perfectly
before he can continue. One of the important concepts
of the teaching machine is that each step must be small
so that the average student will miss very few responses.
This insures that his interest and confidence will be
kept high. No hardship is imposed on the fast student
however, because he can proceed as fast as he pleases.
On the other hand, the teacher in the ordinary class-

BY BRIAN K‘. HAMILTON

room proceeds at a given rate, which will always be too
fast for some, and too slow for others.

In responding to the machine, the student does not
simply make -a choice from a set of alternatives. He is
required to compose an answer himself. Thus, he is
taught to recall information, not just to recognize and
correlate facts. Another reason multiple-choice type
programs are seldom used is that they necessarily con-
tain wrong answers, which is psychologically undesirable
because it strengthens incorrect responses.

Several types of teaching machines have been de-
veloped. Although they differ considerably in mechan-
ical complexity and operating procedure, they are very
similar in theory of learning. In one of the simpler ma-
chines printed material is viewed through a glass win-
dow. Each “frame” contains instructional material and
requires some response. When the student dials in the
next frame (by pushing the paper with his pencil eras-
er), he is given the correct answer in the preceeding
frame. If his response is correct, which it will nearly
always be in a properly prepared program, he moves
on. If he has responded incorrectly, he repeats as many
of the preceding frames as is necessary to correct this
mistake. If he turns the machine back, a special needle
tear.s the edge of the paper. This keeps a record of his
errors, and prevents him from looking ahead to the
answer. Since the student must participate so actively,
the student cannot lose interest and still proceed. This
type of machine was developed at Pitt’s Programmed
Learning Laboratory by Dr. Lloyd Homme, a former
professor here.This laboratory has a high reputation,
having produced much of value in educational technol
ogy under Dr. Homme and Dr. Robert Glaser.

The critical area of teaching machine technology
is the composition of good programmed texts. In addi-
tion to a detailed knowledge of subject matter, program-
ming requires a prodigious amount of time and patience.
For a program to be successful, it must follow certain
rules. These Rules, in the main, were laid out in general
form by Professor B. F. Skinner, of Harvard, who has
done considerable original work in learning theory. As
a behaviorist, Skinner’s approach involves finding a
system of stimuli which will produce a predictable sys-
tem of responses—namely learnin-g. To control learning,
one must establish it as a sequence of small, interrelated
steps, and provide the “reinforcement” necessary to es-
tablish each step as a permanent gain. Because of the

burgh firm devoted to developing teaching machine programs.

reinforcement principle, no question is to be aimed at
“tripping” the student. The questions must be designed
so that the student will almost surely get the answer.

One great advantage to programmed texts is that it
is a simple matter to pinpoint weak spots and ambigu-
ous questions that the individual teacher might never
recognize. Any part of the program that is frequently
missed by the student must be rewarded. Thus, after a
few trial runs, the programmer may revise his material
to almost sure-fire clarity.

Although teaching machines seem likely to revolu-
tionize the process of education, both by increasing effi-
ciency and decreasing the required time, they will in no
way replace the classroom teacher. They will, however,
radically alter his role in the teaching process. Since the
programs used in the machines keep flawless records of
the student’s progress, the burdensome tasks of prepara-
ing, administering, and correcting tests can be virtually ,-
eliminated. Homework assignments may likewise be re-
duced to a minimum. The teacher will be able to handle
many more students by using teaching machines, hence
they are a partial solution to the teacher shortage. Even
with a greater number of students, the teacher will be
able to spend more of his time in individual discussions.
With machines, it is possible and desirable for each stu-
dent to proceed at his own rate. Thus, grouping students
by grades will not have its traditional meaning. The
mark a student receives for a course will also change in
significance. Under the present system, a mark of C
means that a student knows a little of what he has been
taught. But since the teaching machine requires com-
plete mastery of every step, the student must earn an A
to get through the course at all. Under this system, a
sudent’s grades will show, not how well he has learned
the material, but how far he has been able to go. The
quick student, then, will be simply the one with the most
courses “under his belt.”

DECEMBER I960

Although a complete engineering course could not
be adequately programmed for teaching machines, it
could be much improved by them. Mathematics, for
example, is a natural for the machines. Mathematics
has already been extensively programmed by several
groups, and the programs have been successfully used.
Chemistry, metallurgy, thermodynamics, electrical theo-
ry, and such will be programmed with no difficulty.
Physics has been programmed at an engineering level.

Some courses, though, would not be subject to the
teaching machine method. Such courses as statics, ma-
chine design, engineering drawing, etc. require too much
individual work and problem solving to be practical as
a machine program.

The first two years in engineering, then, could be
taught more efficiently, more quickly and with more
uniformity with the aid of teaching machines.

Although several companies are producing teach-
ing machines commercially, their use is still largely ex-
perimental. One reason they are not yet widely used is
the lack of well tested programs. But teaching machines
have come a long way toward general acceptance since
1926, when a psychologist named Sidney Pressey discov-
ered that his self-testing machines could be used as a
teaching aid. Even then, Pressey answered the outcry
against education by machine, saying that his objective
was to free the teacher from being largely a clerical
worker, leaving him free for the more important duties
of developing enthusiasm for clear thinking and high
ideals.

THE TEACHING MACHINE above is an inexpensive model
built by “Teaching Machines lncorporated” of Albuquerque,
New Mexico. The simple construction eliminates many techni-
cal difficulties and at the same time lowers cost.

EMITT

As recipient of the University of Pittsburgh 1960
E.M.I.T.T. Award, I was one of approximately ninety fortu-
nate students who participated in the 1960 I.A.E.S.T.E. Pro-
gram. This program enables technical students from schools
all over the world to obtain summer jobs in foreign countries.

Having chosen Holland as the country in which I de-
sired to live and work, I.A.E.S.T.E. aided in placing four
other Americans and me with the N. V. Philips Gloeilampen_
fabrieken in the city of Eindhoven. After arriving in Am-
sterdam via KLM-Royal Dutch Airlines super constellation
Proton, I reported to the Philips Co. which is undoubtedly
one of Europe’s largest electro-technical manufacturers.

During my eight-week term of employment, I performed
experimental research on gas-discharge lamps in the com-
pany’s developmental laboratories. I electronically measured
the effect of using radio-active material as an ignition cata-
lyst in gas-filled tubes. The work I was doing coincided
nicely with my course of study at Pitt and it gave me an idea
of the practical side of electrical engineering. Most of my
English-speaking co-workers were certainly very congenial
when I asked questions. They also went out of their way to
make me feel like a member of their group. In fact, on sev-
eral occasions I was asked to attend activities outside of
working hours with them; several times I was asked out to
dinner, once taken to a birthday party, and even invited to

Each year, the E.M.I.T.T. (Engineering and Mines In-

Pitt engineering students with financial aid which enables
the students to live, work, and travel in foreign countries.
Once the awardees have been selected, the International
Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Ex-
perience (I.A.E.S.T.E.) Committee makes the necessary em-
ployment and living arrangements and usually provides for
chartered transportation,

The E.M.I.T.T. Program is sponsored by the Engineer-
ing and Mines Cabinet and the number of awards presented
each year depends upon the amount of money available.
The funds are contributed by the E & M Cabinet, local in-
dustry, the Alumni Association, and the Nationality Rooms.
All junior-year students of the Schools of Engineering and
Mines are eligible for the awards presented by the E.M.-
I.T.T. Committee which is composed of faculty members
and students. ,

The benefits received by the awardee are truly very
significant. The student learns how people in other coun-
tries “live” in every respect. He earns the same wages as
those paid to the natives of the country in which he works.
He lives among the people and learns their social customs,
learns their way of thinking, and learns something about
their industrial operations.

attend a wedding ceremony (not as the groom, incidentally).

Included in my eight-week working term was a two-
week paid vacation during the annual shop vacation. During
this period, three other students and I living in Eindhoven
drove up to the beautiful Scandinavian cities of Copenhagen,
Stockholm, and Oslo. After becoming accustomed to driv-
ing on the left-hand side of the road in Sweden, we settled
down to enjoy what I though was one of the most beautiful
areas that I have ever seen. After visiting Oslo’s fiords,
Stockholm’s castles and Copenhagen’s Tivoli, it was difficult
to return to work again.

While working in Eindhoven, I lived with a wonderful
Dutch family of six, who treated me more like a relative
than a foreigner. In addition to taking me to see special
places of interest, such as the birthplace of the famous paint-
er, Vincent Van Gogh, a wooden shoe factory, and many
others, they gave me a cherished impression of Dutch home
life and its warm sincere nature. I considered myself very
fortunate to have observed the Dutch people and their cus-
toms from a point where they were most natural, in the home.

Throughout the entire summer, the Foreign Summer
Students’ Association of the Netherlands arranged week-end
tours of the larger cities and places of interest through-
out Holland. One week-end, for example, we (a group of

dam, traveled in its’ world-famous canals, attended student
parties, and slept at a student hostel. Another week-end, we
visited the land reclaimation works, commonly known as the
Delta Plan, near Rotterdam. Here we saw Dutch ingenuity
at its best. As a result of these interesting, inexpensive week-
end tours, I saw the cities of Hague, Leiden, and Delft in
Holland and Brussels in Belgium.

During my last few days in Eindhoven, I realized that
I had become somewhat attached and disliked leaving the
city, but at the same time I wanted to see the rest of Europe.
However, after selling my major means of transportation,
my second-hand bicycle, and packing my belongings, the
anxiety of the forthcoming trip overwhelmed all else and
this made departure less difficult.

Prior to my departure, I “adopted” a traveling com-
panion, Tom Auten, who is also a Pitt engineering student.

we visited the magnificent Cathedral situated picturesquely
along the Rhine River. From Cologne, we boarded “The

The train ride through Switzerland proved to be very
intriguing as we traveled from Lucerne to Milan, Italy. As
a result, we rented a Fiat 500 (the cheapest, and certainly
the smallest, available) and returned. For three days, we
did nothing but drive up, down, through, and around the
Swiss Alps, stopping where and when we wished to take
pictures of spectacular views or to listen to the melodious
chimes of the cowbells from a herd of cows on some distant

slope. During this time, we made brief stops at a colorfully-
lighted lakefront resort, Lugano, and several small Swiss
villages nestled among the mountains away from the larger
cities and crowded resorts. Switzerland impressed me as the
one country with the most natural beauty.

Our visit to Rome was different from all that we had
encountered previously. The language was completely un-
familiar and as a result, we dieted on “pure-guess” menu
choices. The terrific Italian heat (1100 F, in the shade) and
the large Olympic crowd made our experiences even more
frustrating. However, the thrill of attending Olympic com-
petition, of visiting the awe-inspiring St. Peter’s Basilica, the
historic Colosseum, the ancient Roman Forum, the Opera
House, and many other points of interest in Rome among
its seven hills more than offset any other discomforts we
encountered.

mained on the Riviera for a few additional non-scheduled
days was the excellent sun-bathing and not the natural
beauty found along this seaside paradise. Paris with its

gay night-life, sidewalk cafes, and leisurely pace, set it apart
from all other European cities. Visiting Paris would not be
complete unless one visited the “Mona Lisa” and Venus dc
Milo at the Louvre and observed the artists at work in the
narrow, twisting streets of Montmartre. A visit to the Eiffel
Tower, Napoleon’s Tomb, and the Arc de Triomphe via
the Champs d’ Elysees also proved most inspirational.

As I boarded the train to London, our traveling party
broke up since Tom was to leave from La Havre in several
days whereas I had enough time remaining to include Great
Britain in my itinerary. Much to my surprise, I had some
difficulty in deciphering the English accent, and in several
instances felt sure that I made better progress while on the
continent. One particular characteristic which, much to my
delight, the British people possess, is the desire to go out of
their way to help a complete stranger. As a result, I had
little difficulty, disregarding the British accent momentarily,
in finding my way about. By using a very efficient subway
system, I conveniently moved about from Buckingham place,
to Trafalgar Square, the Houses of Parliament, Piccadilly
Circus, and London Bridge. A visit to Madame Tussaud’s
Wax Museum was another highlight and the discussions
which took place at “Orators’ Corner” in Hyde Park pro-
vided amusement as well as an education.

Soon, the day arrived when I was to embark upon the
S.S. Nieuw Amsterdam and set sail for home. At this point,
it seemed as though I had been in Europe for only a week
instead of my three-month stay. It was difficult to realize
that my summer abroad was quickly drawing to an end, and
that soon I would again return to a way of life completely
different from that to which I had recently been exposed.
During the seven-day Atlantic crossing, as I sat on the
sun deck in the fresh ocean breeze, I had time to recollect
many of the warm, wonderful experiences which I had and
will never, never forget.

Pitt becomes ﬁrst
§Um'ruersz'cy in we
coimtry to receive

new computer fact’/z'tjy.

On the eighth floor of the Cathedral of Learning, in
which was once the Panther Room, the University has in-
stalled a new digital computer. The computer, with the of-
fices of the Data Processing Center, occupies most of the
eighth floor. Data Processing, of course, is nothing new at
Pitt. For some seven years, the University has been using an
IBM 650 computer which was leased from the IBM cor-
poration. The new machine, called the IBM 7070, is about
half owned by the University and half leased from IBM. A
National Science Foundation grant of 210,000 dollars plus
an educational discount from IBM has helped greatly toward
the 1%,-million dollar cost of the 7070.

The 7070 at Pitt is the first computer of comparable size
and scope to be installed in a University, and only the tenth
such computer available for use anywhere. It has many great
advantages over the older 650. The internal storage capacity
of the 7070 is 10,000 “words”, compared to 2,000 for the 650.
The core storage used in the 7070 is much faster in operation
than the revolving drum system of the 650 because it involves
no mechanical motion. In practice, the 7070 seems to be
between 20 and 40 times faster than the 650, depending on
the problem.

The 7070 is equipped with a “priority” operating proce-
dure which allows two or three problems to be solved simul-
taneously. The problems are stored externally on six two-
channel tape units. The ability of the computer to handle
several problems simultaneously and quickly will be greatly

enhanced by another unit which will be added soon. This
unit will be a small size computer which will read informa-
tion from punch-cards to tapes for the 7070 to digest; and
will read tape information from the 7070 to punch-cards.
This will relieve the computer of its slowest, least compli-
cated function.

Because of the larger storage and faster operation of
the 7070, problems that were prohibitively long for the 650
will be run quickly on the 7070. All problems to be solved on
a digital computer must be reduced to a combination of cer-
tain built in “commands” called operation codes. The 7070
has 300 distinct operation codes, while the 650 uses less
than 100.

The Data Processing Center serves the combined aca-
demic and industrial communities of this area. Industrial and
scientific concerns have access to the computer on short no-
tice, presently as little as 24- hours. The fee of 200 dollars per
hour is substantially less than that charged by comparable
installations in other parts of the country. In the academic
area, the center has done work for every school in the Uni-
versity, including some 40 departments. The type of work
done is mostly research projects. Contrary to popular opin-
ion, the center does not have anything to do with registra-
tion, grade recording, or University business, although some
cooperation with the Office of Student Records is contem-
plated for the future.

At present, the new computer is in use only about half the

time, as compared to the 650’s schedule of 24 hours a day,
365 days a year. This is partly due to great increases in
speed and partly due to the fact that all the problems that
were programmed for the 650 must be completely re-pro-
grammed for the 7070. In time, a library of useful programs
for the 7070 will be on hand, and programming time will be
greatly reduced. Within one year or less, it is expected that
the 7070 will be operating on a round-the-clock basis.

To keep abreast of the changing technology of digital
computers, the Data Processing Center maintains a library
of pertinent books and other literature. This is an exacting
task because the manuals for the 7070 itself are out dated
by the time they are read.

Students are encouraged to make use of the new com-
puter. Any student of the University, working on a Uni-
versity approved project, may use the computer free of
charge (unless his project has a financial grant, in which
case there is a fee of 150 dollars per hour). The student
having a use for the computer will gather all his data and
formulate his problem. Then he will" take his material to
the center, where he will program his problem for the ma-
chine, getting any necessary technical help from the staff at
the center. If he wants to learn programming in some detail,
the center "offers three non-credit, no-tuition courses in com-
puting. One is a course in general programming, the other
two are specialized machine language courses. In addition,
the departments of Industrial Enginering, Electrical Engi-
neering, and Mathematics each have formal courses in
digital computer programming.

Thomas O'Connell (B.S. in M.E., Notre Dame, '54; M.B.A., New
York University, '60). Recently, as part of his job in marketing
at IBM, he found himself assisting the customer technicians
with the design problems of one of the world's busiest bridges.

WHAT’S AN IBM MAN GOT TO DO
WITH REDESIGNING A BRIDGE?

Tom O'Connell is an engineer working in marketing areas as an
IBM Data Processing Representative. His job is to introduce
management to the advantages of electronic data processing.
Once they have acquired an IBM system, he acts as a con-
sultant on new uses for the system.

A Spectacular Engineering Achievement. How is he helping to
redesign a bridge? One of his clients is the agency which con-
structs and operates transportation facilities in the New York-
New Jersey area. Recently, they began to add a lower deck to
the George Washington Bridge. It has been a spectacular engi-
neering achievement. Sections were brought up the Hudson
River on barges and hoisted hundreds of feet into position. All
this while heavy traffic continued in both directions.

This double-decking of one of the world's busiest bridges took
complex planning. An IBM system materially aided in the veri-
fication of bridge design calculations and in suspension bridge
truss analysis under various loading conditions. Tom O'Connell
supplied many of the computer programs that were used in
conjunction with other programs developed by the customer".
Tom now knows a lot more about the problems of bridge design.

A Job That Makes News. One of the exciting aspects of Data
Processing Marketing at IBM is this wide diversity of systems
application. Using the knowledge a man has gained in college,
and backed by the comprehensive training he receives at IBM,
he moves into many kinds of application areas. The areas are
always interesting, sometimes newsworthy. In fact, almost
every day newspapers carry stories about new applications of
computer systems in important areas of business, industry,
science and government.

If you would like to find out in more detail about the many kinds
of marketing opportunities at IBM, our representative will be
visiting your campus soon. He'll be glad to sit down with you
and discuss the reasons why marketing is a career with a
virtually unlimited future. Your placement office can make an
appointment. Or you may write, outlining briefly your back-
ground, to:

RUSTING OF IRON

A new explanation for the rusting of iron has been advanced.

by the Westinghouse Research Laboratories. The research
workers have suggested that it is not the water vapor that
actually cause rust, but that the water vapor donates hydrogen
ions to the iron and that these protons penetrate the iron and
enlarge the sites at which oxygen normally combines with iron.
To: complete their studies, the scientists made use of an electron
microscope that could magnify up to 300,000 times. The photo-
graph is that of tiny blades of rust which are no more than
300 millionth’s of an inch high.

HOT UNDER THE COLLAR

“Thermal barrier” temperatures are s'imulated here in this nose
cone test at the National Aeronautical and Space Administra-
tion’s Langley Research Center in Virginia. Heat produced by
225 2500-watt tubular General Electric quartz infrared lamps
in the cylindrical radiator reaches 3,100°F,, about a third as hot
as the surface of the sun. By pre-testing the heat resistance
of materials, structural parts, models, or whole structures of
missiles, space vehicles and air craft, the nation is able to
speed-up its program in these fields.

NUCLEAR INSTRUMENT BRIDGE

A bridge, moving over stainless. steel rails, machine finished
to watch-like precision, may become a figurative span between
the ages of jet and nuclear powered air craft. The bridge has
been installed at the AEC Reactor Testing Station in Idaho
where a major effort is directed toward tests of shielding
materials for use in future atomic powered planes. Spanning
two 30 feet deep water pools, the bridge will position, by re-
mote control, radiation-measuring probes with extreme accu-
racy in either of the pools.

NEW GIANT TELESCOPE

Grinding- operation removes from the edge of giant glass tele-
scope mirror blank portions of the mold in which the big disk
was formed. The 84-inch diameter blank was cast by Corning
Glass Works as the primary reflective piece for a new telescope
under construction at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near
Tucson, Arizona. It is the largest mirror blank ever made by
the sagging technique. This method calls for irregular pieces
of glass to be placed on the mold and sagged into a single piece
under high temperature.

LOOKS METALLIC, IS ACTUALLY GRAPHITE

Looking more like a shiny black metal, the rocket motor nozzle
insert on the left was actually made of National Carbon’s new
high-density recrystallized graphite. This photographic com-
parison, with simulated exhaust gas stream, contrasts the dense
structure of recrystallized graphite with a nozzle insert made
of conventional graphite on the right. This unique structural
material is produced with approximately two to three times
the high-temperature strength of conventional graphites.

Westinghouse walls may light, heat and cool the home of the future

It is possible? Deﬁnitely. Who can do it? Engineers and
scientists at Westinghouse. How soon? About ten years.

The change may create a completely new kind of
home. Thin wall coverings, called Rayescent panels,
will replace furnaces, air conditioners, light ﬁxtures.

A new source of light called electroluminescence
will make the walls glow. A new source of heat and
cold, thermoelectricity, will make them radiate heat
in winter, absorb it in summer.

Both effects will be produced by ordinary electric

current. The whole heating—lighting—cooling system
will have not a single moving part to make noise or
wear out. And the system will last almost forever.

This is just one of the many research projects that
help make Westinghouse an exciting and rewarding
place for young engineers. For more information

partment, Ardmore and Brinton Roads, Pittsburgh 21,

The latest Martian story is about
one who landed in Las Vegas. After
watching a series of players pumping
the arm of a slot machine, the Mar-
tian stepped up to the slot machine
and whispered, “I don’t know what
office you’re running for, buddy, but
try to smile a little more when you
shake those hands.”

“I told him I worshipped my fig-
ure and he tried to embrace my re-

Two ‘M.E.’s were on their way
home for vacation on a very cold

so, when they stopped for gas, he
took off his coat and put it on back-
wards, buttoning it up to keep out
more wind. Soon after they started
off again, they ran smack into a
telephone pole.

The policeman who called in
about the accident reported the fol-
lowing to the police chief: “The man
riding in front was killed instantly.
The man who was riding in back
was still alive when we got there, but
he died when we straightened out
his neck.

Outer space presents vast new
challenges to the engineer—espe-
cially in electronics. And photog-
raphy becomes one of his valuable
tools. Orbiting satellites send mes-
sages to be recorded from the
oscilloscope tube. X-rays and ﬁlm
allow him to check the internal
integrity of sealed components.
Even intricate circuits can be
printed and miniaturized by photo-
graphic methods.

There’s hardly a ﬁeld on which
you can set your sights where photog-

raphy does not play a part in
improving the product, simplifying
work and routine. It saves time and
costs in research, on the production
line, in quality control, in the engi-

So in whatever you plan to do,
take full advantage of all the ways
photography can help.

help you focus your personal salary
objectives.

Salary—a most individual and per-
sonal aspect of your job——is difﬁcult to
discuss in general. terms. While recog-
nizing this, Mr. Case has tried answering
as directly as possible some of your
questions concerning salary:

Q Mr. Case, what starting salary does
your company pay graduate engineers?

A Well, you know as well as I that
graduates’ starting salaries are greatly
inﬂuenced by the current demand for
engineering talent. This demand es-
tablishes a range of “going rates” for
engineering graduates which is no doubt
widely known on your campus. Be-
cause General Electric seeks outstand-
ing men, G—E starting salaries for these
candidates lie in the upper part of the
range of “going rates.” And within
General Electric’s range of starting sal-
aries, each candidate’s ability and
potential are carefully evaluated to de-
termine his individual starting salary.

Q How do you go about evaluating
my ability and potential value to your
company?

A We evaluate each individual in the
light of information available to us:
type of degree; demonstrated scholar-
ship; extra-curricular contributions; work
experience; and personal qualities as
appraised by interviewers and faculty
members. These considerations deter-
mine where within G.E.’s current sal-
ary range the engineer’s starting salary
will be established.

Your Salary

at General Electric

Q When could I expect my first salary
increase from General Electric and how
much would it be?

A Whether a man is recruited for a
speciﬁc job or for one of the principal
training programs for engineers—the
Engineering and Science Program, the
Manufacturing Training Program, or
the Technical Marketing Program——his
individual performance and salary are
reviewed at least once a year.

For engineers one year out of col-
lege,- our recent experience indicates a
ﬁrst—year salary increase between 6 and
15 percent. This percentage spread re-
flects the individual’s job performance
and his demonstrated capacity to do
more difﬁcult work. So you see, salary
adjustments reﬂect individual perform-
ance even at the earliest stages of
professional development. And this
emphasis on performance increases
as experience and general competence
increase.

Q How much can I expect to be making
after five years with General Electric?

A As I just mentioned, ability has a
sharply increasing influence on your
salary, so you have a great deal of per-
sonal control over the answer to your
question.

It may be helpful to look at the cur-
rent salaries of all General Electric
technical-college graduates who re-
ceived their bachelor’s degrees in 1954
(and now have ﬁve years’ experience).
Their current median salary, reﬂect-
ing both merit and economic changes,
is about 70 percent above the 1954
median starting rate. Current salaries
for outstanding engineers from this

class are more than double the 1954
median starting rates and, in some
cases, are three or four times as great.

Q What kinds of benefit programs
does your company offer, Mr. Case?

A Since I must be brief, I shall merely
outline the many General Electric em-
ployee beneﬁt programs. These include
a liberal pension plan, insurance plans,
an emergency aid plan, employee dis-
counts, and educational assistance pro-
grams.

The General Electric Insurance Plan
has been widely hailed as a “pace
setter” in American industry. In addi-
tion to helping employees and their
families meet ordinary medical expen-
ses, the Plan also affords protection
against the expenses of “catastrophic”
accidents and illnesses which can wipe
out personal savings and put a family
deeply in debt. Additional coverages in-
clude life insurance, accidental death
insurance, and maternity beneﬁts.

Our newest plan is the Savings and
Security Program which permits em-
ployees to invest up to six percent of
their earnings in U.S. Savings Bonds
or in combinations of Bonds and Gen-
eral Electric stock. These savings are
supplemented by a Company Propor-
tionate Payment equal to 50 percent
of the employee’s investment, subject
to a prescribed holding period.
