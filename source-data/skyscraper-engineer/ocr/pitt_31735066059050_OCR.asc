      If man is to reach the other planets...

and get back to earth...he has three immediate choices: (1) A conventional rocket, m
many times the size of anything now existing. (2) A rendezvous in orbit, hid
where the spaceship would be assembled. Or (3) an atomic-powered rocket ship. ;
Because atomic power's efficiency is the highest, many experts believe the practical 47

choice for space exploration is an atomic rocket engine.

Westinghouse and Aerojet General are now working with AEC's Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
to design such an engine. This industry-government team is working under the direction of the
Joint Space Nuclear Propulsion Office of the AEC and NASA.

...sudden1y, new hope in life

A man lies on the operating table, crippled with the exhausting tremors of Parkinson’s disease. The surgeon
guides a slender tube deep inside the patient’s brain until it reaches the target area. Then liquid nitrogen,
at 320 degrees below zero F., is fed to the end of the tube. Suddenly the trembling stops. The unearthly cold
kills the diseased cells . . . and a once desperate human being has been given a new chance in life. > Medical
reports have indicated that not only Parkinson’s disease but also other disorders causing tremor or rigidity
have responded to this new technique in brain surgery. The operation has been described as easier on the
patients than previous surgery, and they have been able to leave the hospital in a surprisingly short time.
Also, encouraging results are reported on the use of cryosurgery, as it is called, to destroy diseased cells in
other parts of the body. > Through its division, Linde Company, Union Carbide was called upon by medical
scientists for help in designing and making equipment to deliver and control the critical cold required in this
new surgery. This dramatic use of Cryogenics, the science of cold, is an example of how research by the
people of Union Carbide helps lead to a better tomorrow.

trical Engineers Industrial
Engineers . . . Mechanical Engi-
neers . . . Metallurgical Engineers

Every major engineering degree is
represented within the manage-
ment ranks here at Bethlehem Steel.

It makes sense. The mining and
processing of minerals obviously
suggest the need for Mining Engi-
neers. Then come the chemical
processes of coke-making, smelting,
reﬁning. Fuels are consumed, valu-
able by-products are made. Is it
any wonder steelmaking calls for
Chemical Engineers?

And how about the machinery, the

mills, the furnaces, the instrumen-
tation that make up a modern steel
plant? Mechanical Engineers de-
sign them, and frequently supervise
installation. Civil Engineers design
and put up the buildings to house
them, and the feed lines to keep
them supplied.

Power? Steel is the biggest indus-
trial consumer of electric power.
You cannot conceive of a greater
concentration of electrical equip-
ment than in a modern steel mill.
And many steel plants generate
electric power, too. Electrical Engi-
neers are busy fellows in the steel
industry.

Steelmaking calls for volume pro-
duction, complex and scientiﬁc,
often highly automated. We manu-
facture numerous ﬁnished products,
too, from nuts and bolts to nuclear-
powered crL1isers. The Industrial
Engineer ﬁnds plenty to do here
at Bethlehem.

What’s more, the kind of engineer-
ing degree does not limit a Looper’s
assignments. The superintendent
of a huge open-hearth department,
or a giant rolling mill, might well
be an M.E., a Ch.E., a Met.E.,
an I.E., or C.E.

Sales Engineers

Because of the nature of our

Research

Our research policy and our
magniﬁcent new research labora-
tories, in Bethlehem, Pa., offer
unexcelled opportunities for re-
search and development engineers
and scientists. The exciting results
of research promise bright pros-
pects for all Bethlehem operations.

Shipbuilding

As the world’s largest privately
owned shipbuilding and ship repair
organization, Bethlehem offers ca-

Marine Engineers, as well as to
engineers in many other categories.

The Loop Course

This program was established
some forty years ago, to select and
train well—qualiﬁed college gradu-
ates for management careers in the
Bethlehem organization. It was so
named because of an observational
circuit (or “loop”) of a steel plant.
After a ﬁve-weeks’ basic training
period, which is held once a year at
company headquarters in Bethle-
hem, Pa., loopers receive their ﬁrst
assignments, which call for special-
ized training that may last for a
few weeks or for as long as a year.
Next comes on-the-job training,
and the looper is on his way.

ONE OF THE MANY CASTLES ALONG THE RHINE VALLEY, in Germany.

the decor typical of Medieval times.

It was quite a thrill to walk through theln and note

a summer in europe

Last year’s recipients of the University EMITT Award, Regis Stana and William Schneider,

share with 11s the experience of their three months of work and travel in Europe.

The date was Friday, June 15, 1962,
probably an ordinary day for most Pitt
Engineers, but for Bill Schneider and
myself this was a special day. On this
day we, as winners of the Pitt EMITT
award, left Idlewild International Air-
port via KLM charter ﬂight to Amster-
dam for a three months stay in Europe.
As participants in the IAESTE (Inter-
national Association for the Exchange
of Students for Technical Experience)
Program, we would work for six weeks
in an engineering capacity and then
spend six weeks travelling throughout
Europe. Both Bill and I would work
as chemical engineers in oil reﬁneries,
Bill for Shell Oil, and I for Caltex Oil.

by Regis Stana

The reﬁneries were located near Rotter-
dam, Holland.

Our plane, a DC—7C, ﬂew the 3650
miles from New York to Amsterdam
in eleven and one-half hours. Aboard
the ﬂight were seventy—ﬁve boys and
ﬁve girls, all college students partici-
pating in the student exchange. At
eight o’clock Saturday morning the
plane set down lightly at Amsterdam’s
Schipol Airport, elevation thirteen feet
below sea level.

The bus ride from the airport to
Rotterdam afforded us our first View of
the Dutch countryside. The land is
very ﬂat, but sliced at even intervals
by the many drainage canals. The
ﬁelds were all a deep green, evidence

of their damp condition. There were
wild ﬂowers (no tulips—out of sea-
son) growing everywhere along the
road and in the ﬁelds. We drove upon
a typical Dutch road, a four lane high-
way, most of the 50 miles to Rotter-
dam, where there was no speed limit.
About twenty miles from Rotterdam,
we sighted our ﬁrst windmill; there are
only about seventy left in Holland.
Upon arrival in Rotterdam, Bill and
I checked in at the AMVJ (Dutch
YMCA). Caltex had arranged for me
to stay at the AMVJ while working for
them, but Shell was able to ﬁnd Bill
a Dutch family with which to stay.
The building was made of glass and
aluminum, as were most of the sur-

rounding buildings, and looked more
like the Pittsburgh Hilton than any
American YWCA. The facilities in-
cluded a modern cafeteria, gym and
basketball ﬂoor, TV room, dance ﬂoor
and, shockingly enough, a bar. There
were dances every Thursday, Saturday
and Sunday night. The rooms were
quite spacious and bright, each having
an 8x8—foot picture window. The cost
for staying here was ﬁfty-ﬁve dollars a
month for room and board, including
daily maid service.

Breakfast consisted of porridge,
milk, and open sandwiches; lunch, open
sandwiches and milk; supper was a
hot meal. Generally a type of stew and
a desert were served. The food was
always so appetizing that I once found
I had unknowingly eaten raw ﬁsh.
Food costs about one—third of U. S.
prices, while meat was more expensive.
Because of the cost, the meals had very
small portions of meat.

During our ﬁrst walk through Rot-
terdam, Bill and I noticed that most
men wore white shirts, coats, and ties,
except those in uniform. Later we
even saw men digging ditches in what
seemed to be their Sunday best. We
also noticed that almost every house
had a ﬂower box, and every yard a
ﬂower garden. Almost all of the win-
dows were of the picture window size.
The people spend many hours each
week working on their houses and
yards. The Dutch girls were surpris-
ingly tall, and it was not uncommon
to see a couple walking down the street
with the girl taller than the boy.

Almost all of Holland is below sea
level. The soil is very sandy, therefore,
and offers practically no support for
construction. Everything that is built,
including houses, roads, and train
tracks, must be built on piles that are
driven through the soft sand until they
hit a clay deposit. For a new depart-
ment store being built outside of Rot-
terdam, they are driving 63,000 one
hundred and ten foot piles into the
ground. The roads are made of either
brick or small squares of concrete and
are relayed every three years!

The major means of transportation
is the bicycle. Only about one-third
of the families own a car, generally of
the small European variety. Motor
bikes and motor scooters are rather

prevalent among the teenage set. In
Holland there are special roads for bi-
cycles which run parallel to the motor-
ways; their trolley system is so cheap
that for 7¢ you can go anywhere in
the city. The efficiency is astounding;
even in rush hour trafﬁc there is never
a wait of more than ﬁve minutes for
a trolley. The trolleys, however, shut
off promptly at midnight.

While working for the reﬁneries,
Bill and I had similar experiences.
We received very warm welcomes from
the companies and spent the ﬁrst day
meeting the people and getting to know
the reﬁnery. There were three other
IAESTE students working for the Cal-
tex reﬁnery, one Dutch, one American,
and a Finn. The second day started
with ﬁre-ﬁghting school for all the new
employees.

School began with a two—hour lecture
on the ﬁre hazards in the reﬁnery. The
instructors taught us how to work the
hand ﬁre extinguishers. Next, we prac-
ticed putting out several varieties of
small oil ﬁres. After this, we dressed
in ﬁremen’s hats, coats, and boots and
walked out to a small barge loaded with
crude oil. Each time the oil was lit
and was burning ﬁercely, we took turns
putting out the ﬁre with a high pressure
water spray. A crude oil ﬁre can be
put out with water if it is applied in
a ﬁne spray; the spray cools the oil
below its ignition point. For our last
practical ﬁreﬁghting lesson, they had a
benzene high pressure shower hooked
up on a pole with a control valve lower
on the pole. They lit the shower and
we took turns, using a water spray as
a shield, running in to turn off the

spray. It only took two weeks for my
eyebrows to grow back.

During my stay with Caltex, I was
able to work in several departments.
My ﬁrst two weeks were spent with the
crude distillation unit. Here, as in the
other parts of the plant, I learned the
purpose, product speciﬁcations, and
operation of the unit. The unit proc-
essed 66,000 barrels a day of Arabian
crude oil, separating it into nine frac-
tions. The fractionating was done in
such a way as to obtain a maximum of
diesel and fuel oil, and a minimum of
gasoline. In the United States, most
reﬁneries try to make a maximum of
gasoline.

The reﬁnery hardware, for the most
part, was made in the United States.
It was designed in the United States
and built immediately after the war.
There were Chapman valves, Brown
and Honeywell automatic controllers,
United Iron of Oakland, California tur-
bines, and Westinghouse motors and
transformers.

My third week was spent with the
thermal reforming unit. The unit re-
formed the 35—octane crude gasoline
to give a 70—octane reformate. The
unit also operated a series of fraction-
ating towers for separating the butane
and iso—butane fractions from the gaso-
line. Under Dutch tax laws, the butane
and lighter hydrocarbons are not taxed.
For this reason, they are isolated and
later blended with the gasoline as a
method of reducing the cost of gasoline.

The fourth week was spent with the
catalytic reforming unit. The unit uti-
lized a platinum catalyst to improve the
crude gasoline to an octane of 90 plus.
Although one of the cheapest in West-
ern Europe, the price of Dutch gasoline
is about ﬁfty cents a gallon, about 80%
of which is due to taxes. The octane
is slightly below American standards,
being eighty—eight for normal and
ninety—four for super.

My last two weeks at Caltex were
spent working for the technical services
department. This department was
responsible for giving each operating
unit its output for the month. They
took the predicted market reports and
adjusted the product speciﬁcations in
such a way that all the market require-
ments could be fulﬁlled.

For the most part, I spent the ﬁrst
two weeks around Rotterdam. I think

the ﬁrst thing that impressed me about
the city was the silence. The AMVJ
was at the intersection of the two main
streets; there was a trolley station
across the street; a train station was
one block away; it was only a half
mile to the harbor. It was, neverthe-
less, dead quiet. The trolleys were al-
most soundless, the trains electric, and
it was illegal for cars to blow their horn
within the city.

During World War II, the center of
Rotterdam was completely devastated
by German bombs. Year by year since
1950, many impressive modern build-
ings have been erected as the nucleus
of what is already being called “the
city of tomorrow.” The new shopping
district, the Lijnbahn, contains several
of the few department stores in Europe.
The bombed harbor has been rebuilt
and expanded until today it is the larg-
est harbor in Europe and second only
to New York. Many parts of the city
contain canals and lakes surrounded
with green lawns dotted by colorful
flower gardens. During my ﬁrst two
weekends, I visited the Euromast, a
383—foot observation tower overlooking
the city and harbor, several parks, the
Royal Rotterdam Zoo, several mu-
seums, and the harbor.

I found the movies and television
programs quite different from those in
the United States. In all movie thea-
ters, you must buy tickets for speciﬁc
seats. The cost ranges from twenty
cents to seventy—ﬁve cents per seat. All
theaters begin by showing the news;
then there are several commercials and,
before you are even in your seat, there
is an intermission. After the inter-
mission, the main movie is shown
without interruption. The television is
quite funny as compared to American
TV. First, there are no commercials.
The station is government owned.
There is only one station, and it broad-
casts only six hours a day and ends at
odd times, such as from 7:21 till 7:43.
The shows originate from almost every
country in the world, including the
United States. “Father Knows Best,”
the “Nat King Cole Show,” and the
“Perry Como Show” were all seen on
the Dutch network. In August, the
“Donna Reed Show” made its premier
in Holland. lts title, as translated from
the Dutch, was given as “Mother
Knows Better.”

The popular songs in Holland are
greatly inﬂuenced by American music;

ordinarily, seven out of the top ten

hits are American songs. However,
the top tune for most of the summer
was a German song, “Zwei Kleine
Italiene” (Two Little Italians). The
biggest recording group was the Eng-
lish instrumental group, The Shadows.
The people are extremely anxious to
hear American folksongs and Negro
spirituals.

On the Saturday of my third week-
end in Holland, a Dutch family invited
me to accompany them to the little
village of Kinderdyke, which is about
twenty miles south of Rotterdam. The
village seemed to have come to life
from a travel poster. It was full of
windmills, canals, ﬁshing boats and
wooden shoes. The inhabitants all
wore the wooden shoes, which they
preferred over the leather shoes since
they kept their feet dry while work-
ing in the damp ﬁelds. There were
eighteen windmills near the village.
We were able to visit one of the wind-
mills and see how the family lived in-
side it. Although it was built in 1738,
everything was original except the
wooden teeth on the biggest wooden
gear. These had to be replaced every
three years. The mill raised the water
to a height of one and one-half meters
at a rate of thirty cubic meters a
minute. This was the ﬁrst time that the
Dutch family had been to this village.

On Sunday of the same weekend, I
decided to see what it was like to be
a Dutch boy traveling around on a
motorbike. I rented one of the smaller
motorbikes and decided to visit the
Hague and Scheveningen (the Miami
Beach of Holland). I was able to visit
the Peace Palace and several of the
royal palaces. In the Hague, there is
also the village of Madurodam, which
is a miniature Holland, one-twenty—ﬁfth
size. It is a bigger attraction than the
Peace Palace. Scheveningen is much
the same as Miami Beach, being a re-
sort area and a place of entertainment.
Besides the usual clubs, dance halls,
and restaurants, the resort contained a
bowling hall, a golf course, and the
only trampoline center in Holland.

While riding the motorbike, I man-
aged to learn a few of the Dutch “rules
of the road.” The main rule is that
whatever is on your right or is coming

from your right has the right—of-way.
It is quite funny to see a bus screech
to a halt to let a motorscooter go by.
In Holland, it is right makes right, not
might makes right.

My ‘fourth weekend in Holland I de-
cided to go to Amsterdam. Here I
was, one lone American who speaks
only English, headed for the big" city
of Amsterdam full of Dutch people,
or so I thought. Well, I boarded the
8:07 train and saw a couple of girls
sitting alone in one of the compart-
ments. Anxious to meet some more
Dutch girls, I sat down right next to
them only to discover that they were
students from New York and Philadel-
phia. After getting off the train and
saying goodby (I still wanted to meet
Dutch girls), the ﬁrst thing I did was
to get invited to a diamond cutting
exhibition. The exhibition included a
detailed English explanation of dia~
mond cutting and a display of replicas
of some of the world’s most famous
diamonds. Unfortunately, there were
no free samples at the end.

After the exhibition, I walked over
to the Reich Museum and strolled
about a bit on the first ﬂoor, which
featured a collection of sixteenth Cen-
tury Dutch clothes, armor, and ships.

«\

A

Then I went upstairs to see the famous
Rembrandt collection. I had just
started to browse around when I heard
a guide say, in English, that he was
going to conduct a tour and comment
upon the paintings. Just then I noticed
a really sharp blonde and a terrilﬁc
brunette getting in line to join the tour.
Well, right then and there I developed
a taste for sixteenth Century Dutch art.
After the tour had begun, I walked up
to the blonde and asked, “Do you
speak English?” Itwas a stupid ques-
tion since the guide was only speaking
in English, but there are times when it
pays to be stupid. She answered, in
English, in a really sweet drawl. A few
questions later, I found out they were
from the far off land pronounced “l0-
ah—sea.” So we talked during the rest
of the tour. When the girls’ tour left
the museum, I was off to take a boat
ride around the Amsterdam canals.

The city of Amsterdam, itself, was
quite amusing. The main street was
deserted, but the narrower the streets
were the more crowded they became.
There are some streets only four feet
wide. All the houses were tall and
very narrow, and the inside stairways
are always at least sixty steep. In fact,
it is impossible to get furniture to the
upper ﬂoors by way of the stairway.
All houses are equipped with a beam
sticking out from the roof which can
be used to support a rope to raise the
furniture to the appropriate level and
then swing it in through the window.
The ground between the canals is quite
soft as is evidenced by the characteristic
lean of almost all the houses. Amster-
dam is truly the city of bicycles, as
there are 850,000 inhabitants and
450,000 bicycles.

When I took the train back to Rot-
terdam, I met the ﬁrst non—American
girl of the day. Of course, she was
French. I returned to Rotterdam that
day, convinced that “There ain’t no
Dutch girls in Amsterdam.”

On the ﬁfth weekend, two English
boys, 21 Canadian, a Frenchman, Bill
and myself rented a car and drove up
along the Zyder Zee. This huge lake
is now being drained to make more
farm land. The dyke, which isolates
the Zyder Zee from the ocean, still
contains the barbed wire barricade im-
bedded in it during World War II. We
were also able to visit several villages

similar to Kinderdyke, where the peo-
ple wore the native costumes.

On the following Monday and Tues-
day, Bill and I borrowed a motor
scooter and rode to Valkenburg, in
the southeast corner of Holland. The
center of the Dutch underground in
World War II was here. We also
visited the American military cemetery
of Margraten, Valls, the highest point
in Holland (1070 feet), and the ex-
tensive caverns used to smuggle the
downed Allied ﬂyers into Belgium.

On the following Thursday, a Dutch
student working at the reﬁnery, -my
training supervisor, and I spent the day
at the University of Delft. I had ex-
pected to see a few old buildings and
dingy classrooms. Instead I saw an
impressive array of modern buildings
housing equally modern classrooms and
laboratories. Just the immensity of the
university was a shock. I spent the
entire afternoon in only the Chemical
Engineering section. The laboratories
alone ﬁlled four buildings about the
size of Alumni Hall. All the equip-
ment was very up to date. Even in
the primary chemistry courses, they
have nothing but Mettler balances.
The one lecture room that we visited
was about the same as those in Langley
Hall. However, it had a glass roof
which had four covers that could fold

had an experimental atomic reactor as
part of the facilities.
$25 per term, and room and board
were $140 a term.

The Dutch people, for the most part,
are quite reserved and formal. Those
who have been to America, though, are
extremely helpful and friendly toward
Americans. Probably more than 50%
of the population and all the younger
people can speak English. Four terms
of English, along with French and Ger-
man, are now mandatory for all Dutch
students. When I arrived in Holland,
I couldn’t speak a word of Dutch, and
when I left, I still couldn’t.

The country of Holland has the most
dense population of any country in the
world. In this country where land is
at a premium, however, the number
one export of the country is food. Hol-
land’s ham and cheese are both world
famous.

While in Holland, a country less than
200 miles across its widest part, I man-
aged to travel about 1800 miles, by
the following means: car, train, trolley,
bus, boat, ferry, bicycle, motor bike,
motor scooter, and foot.

I found that my stay in Holland was
educationally and culturally beneﬁcial
as well as exciting and enjoyable.

We went to the mountain to

make 1963 Ford-built cars
90 30,000 to 100,000
miles between major
chassis lubrications

Quite a task faced Ford Motor Company
engineers when they set out to eliminate the
traditional trip to the grease rack every
1,000 miles.

Like Mohammed, they went to the mountain-
Bartlett Mountain on the Continental Divide in
Colorado. More molybdenite is mined there
than in the rest of the world combined. And
from molybdenite ore comes the amazing
“moly” grease that helps extend the chassis
lubrication intervals for Ford-built cars. This
grease sticks tenaciously to metal, stands up
under extreme pressures and resists moisture,
pounding and squeezing. It is slicker than
skates on ice!

New, improved seals were developed. Bushings,
bearings and washers of many materials were
investigated. Slippery synthetics, like nylon
and teflon, were used a number of new ways.

The search for means to extend chassis lubri-
cation also led to New Orleans—where
experimental suspension ball joints tested in
taxicabs in regular service went two years
without relubrication.

It took time. And ingenuity. But the effort paid
off when Ford-built cars were the first to build
in chassis lubrication good for 30,000 miles or
two years—whichever came first.

Another assignment completed—another
“Ford First” and another example of how Ford
Motor Company provides engineering leader-
ship for the American Road.

IIm'0(/uction 10 Gas Dynamics: D_wmmics and Thermodynamics of
Fluid Flow by Ralph M. Rotty. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1962.
272 pages. $8.75.

Gas dynamics, as an integral part of a present trend to
turn out broadly educated engineers, has become a ﬁeld of
increasing importance to any engineer interested in progress.
Professor Rotty, in his book, carefully reviews essential
laws of thermodynamics and ﬂuid mechanics and applies
these principles to modern devices. General principles are
presented so that the reader is able to visualize the physical
picture and recognize their application.

The material is presented in a simpliﬁed manner, which
makes it more understandable. Special emphasis is placed
on the physical signiﬁcance of each operation. Some of
the topics covered include the propulsive eﬁects of various
fluid ﬂow patterns, the effects of heating and cooling, and
shock waves and general wave patterns in ﬂuid ﬂow.

Any engineer taking courses in thermodynamics might
be interested in obtaining this book to use as a reference.
The more simpliﬁed and uniﬁed manner of presentation of
this text could aid in clarifying some of the perplexing
problems encountered in these courses.

Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel by Willy Ley. The Viking
Press, 1957. 528 pages. $6.75.

In an era of international crises and the race for suprem-
acy in outer space, this book by Willy Ley is of particular
interest. The author begins his work by reviewing early
mythology related to the heavens and man’s desire to travel
in space. He continues by discussing early achievements
in physics and astronomy, and traces rockets and rocket
fuels from their earliest days, leading into a discussion of
modern war rockets. Finally Mr. Ley speculates on applica--
tions and future aspects of rockets, missiles, and space travel.

This book has had eleven reprintings and three revisions
since originally written. In the latest revision forty percent
of the material relates to the history of rocket development,
forty percent to present projects, and approximately twenty
percent to future applications. Sections of the book were
written with the personal consultation of Wernher von
Braun. Other sections include rocket fuels and descrip-
tions of war rockets.

The Promising Shape of A|uminum’s Future

. . . an important chapter in Nationa|’s growth

Aluminum is the nation’s fastest growing metal. From
1950 through 1961, primary production has grown from
719,000 to 1,904,000 tons and shipments of aluminum
mill products have increased from 857,000 to 1,672,000
tons. To help meet America’s aluminum needs, Bridge-
port Brass Company, National’s metals division, is ex-
panding its aluminum facilities and has become a fast
growing supplier to industrial and home products markets.

Bridgeport entered the aluminum ﬁeld in 1954 and to-
day operates two modern plants with extensive facilities.
The division makes aluminum sheet, rod and forgings as
well as defense products and components for aluminum
awnings, blinds and siding at a p ant at Riverside,
California. The Warren, Ohio plant produces aluminum
coiled and ﬂat sheet. Capacity in both locations was in-
creased in 1961. This year, Bridgeport will be one step
closer to aluminum integration upon completion of a new
hot rolling mill at Oswego, New York—a joint venture
with three other companies.

These facilities, added to almost 100 years experience
in metals, enable Bridgeport to provide aluminum going
into products as varied as appliances and cars, electrical
parts and machinery. For the country’s defense, the divi-
sion turns out weapons such as the “Sidewinder” and
“Zuni” missiles. And in building products, one of the
fastest growing aluminum ﬁelds, Bridgeport markets
Flexalum® Awnings and Blinds, and recently introduced
a major new product, Flexalum Siding.

Aluminum is the important “A” in Bridgeport’s “A” to
“Z” line ranging through brass and copper and stainless
steel to such space-age metals as titanium, uranium and
Z1I‘COI11i.1In.

FOUR LANGUAGE PROJECTOR

A small, portable 8mm sound motion picture projector,
which produces its dialogue in any one of four languages
at the touch of a button, was demonstrated and described
at the 91st convention of the Society of Motion Picture
and Television Engineers.

The projector, resembling a portable typewriter case and
utilizing a self—contained rear—projection screen, played back
commentary and dialogue, synchronized with action on the
screen, in English, German, Italian and Russian.

Both ﬁlm and tape were fed from a single magazine in a
continuous loop, the ﬁlm following the conventional path
of the projector but by-passing the sound heads entirely.
The tape was fed to the drive sprocket and through the
sound heads, then returning directly to the magazine.

In describing the potential applications of such a device,
the importance of the language barrier in international
trade, cultural and political relations was noted.

BUT YOUR FEET MUST BE ON THE GIIOIIIIIII

The glamour and excitement of space age programs often obscure a fundamental fact. It is simply
that farsightedness must be coupled with sound, practical, down-to-earth engineering if goals are
to be attained. This is the philosophy upon which Pratt & Whitney Aireraft’s position as a world
leader in ﬂight propulsion systems has been built.

Almost four decades of solid engineering achievement at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft can be credited
to management’s conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy progress. ln
addition to concentrated research and development efforts on advanced gas turbine and rocket

engines, new and exciting effects are being explored in every ﬁeld of aerospace, marine and industrial
power application.

The challenge of the future is indicated by current programs. Presently Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
is exploring the areas of technical knowledge in magnetoliydroafvnamics . . . tliermionic and thermo-
electric conversions . . . hypersonic propulsion . . . fuel cells and nuclear power.

If you have interests in common with us, if you look to the future but desire to take a down-to-earth
approach to get there, investigate career opportunities at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ambitious young engineers and scientists. Your de-
gree? It can be a BS, M.S. or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL o AERONAUTICAL 0 ELECTRICAL 0 CHEMICAL and
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING o PHYSICS - CHEMISTRY o METALLURGY 0 CERAMICS o MATHEMATICS o ENGI-
NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS. The field still broadens. The challenge grows greater. And a future of
recognition and advancement may be here for you.

HOW CUTLER-HAMMER

CREATIVE ENGINEERING
HELPS INDUSTRY REACH
ITS AUTOMATION GOALS

Q. How long has Cutler-Hammer
been in Automation?

A. Long before the word “auto-
mation” was coined.

Many company historians View
the installation of the ﬁrst electric
turret-turning control for battle-
ships as our original “automatic
system” achievement. In 1904,
trials aboard the U.S.S. INDIANA
so improved rapid-ﬁre and gunnery-
control scoring that identical sys-
tems were installed on sister ships.

Q. How does your Automation-
or “System Control”—effort
differ from your other control
business?

A. We work in two areas of control.
One involves research, develop-
ment and manufacture of stand-
ardized electric control components
and apparatus. Here the customer
orders from us through a bill of
material.

The automation customer is dif-
ferent. He has no bill of material
—he has a problem. He needs to
improve production or quality, or
to reduce his unit costs. He isn’t
buying “hardware,” he’s seeking a
creative solution to a challenging
problem . . . and that’s what our
engineers provide.

Q. Assuming I decide to work
for a control manufacturer, why
Cutler-Hammer?

A. The most compelling reason is
our continuing interest and exten-
sive experience in “System Con-
trol.” This is the life of our com-
rany and distinct career advantages
result from this concern.
Our engineers are forced to apply
,a combination of advanced elec-
tronic and electrical engineering

Ralph Millermaster, vice president,
engineering and development, answers the questions
most frequently asked by students regarding
Cutler-Hammer’s role in industrial automation

know-how to solve a customer’s
manufacturing problem. They start
with a thorough grounding in the
customer’s products—how he
moves and works the materials he
manufactures. Then they apply
their technical knowledge to create
a practical solution. We have a
Materials Handling group, a Metal
Processing group, and many other
industry groups composed of young,
creative-minded engineers.

And, we don’t “stock-pile” our
engineering talent. Every engineer
we hire is expected to contribute
quickly and directly to the team
effort.

Q. How does Cutler-Hammer
approach an automation job?

A. We have learned that a sizable
system needs painstaking coordi-
nation between many groups-
project teams, engineering, mainte-
nance and purchasing personnel at
the customer factory and head-
quarters locations . . . machinery
builders, motor manufacturers,
contractorsand many more.

We View this coordination as one
of our primary functions, and fulﬁll
it by furnishing all responsible
groups and individuals the infor-
mation they want and need to
guarantee an efficient dovetailing
of effort.

We organize-a coordinating task

force for each project, headed byga i _ .
lead engineer and staffed by engi-

neers representing every necessary
technical discipline. That task force
is charged with three duties:

speciﬁcally designed to house every

activity involved in the evolution‘

of the completesystem. Every pos-
sible step has been taken to provide
a climate that is conducive to
creative planning and development.

This approach has paid off! Long
recognized as a leader in standard-
ized motor control, Cutler-Hammer
is more and more being regarded
as a major contributor in industrial
automation. Our automation cre-
dentials include innovations in every
industrial field from continuous
process lines to newspaper mail
rooms. ' - -

Q. How do I learn more about
Cutler-Hammer’s automation
capability and the career op-
portunities forengineers?

A. By visiting your Place-

rouwozo m «so: ’/

the flying transceiver

by Sam Digges

Freddy Freenwalter idly spun the propeller on his orange
and green freshman beanie as he waited to see the head of
the physics department. When Freddy had arrived an hour
earlier, a secretary told him that there would be a short
wait before he could see Dr. Dillahay. In the hour that
Freddy had been waiting, she had not uttered one other
word. In fact, she hardly moved. Her secretarial duties
seemed to consist solely of ﬁling her left thumbnail and
chewing a huge wad of gum. She was fascinating to watch.

24

Every four scrapes of the nail ﬁle were punctuated by a
liquid smack of the gum. “Well,” thought Freddy, “at
least she has rhythm.”

Suddenly, the door to the inner oﬁice ﬂew open, and a
young man with a pipe clenched in his teeth stalked out
of Dr. Dillahay’s oflice. As he passed the chair where
Freddy was sitting, Freddy heard him muttering something
about a “pompous baboon.”

“Yakin goinnow Mr. Greenwater,” said the secretary,

bathing Freddy in a professional smile that erased the
natural look of complete idiocy on her pretty face.

“lt’s Freenwalter, Ma’am,” corrected Freddy.

Her face momentarily went blank again, but she re-
covered her composure enough to smile again and giggle,
“I’m sorry, Mr. Freenwallow, but I’m just so awful at
names.”

Freddy knew when he was licked, so he sighed and went
into the oﬂice, leaving her alone with her thumbnail.

"Yes, Mr. Freenwalter, what can I . . .” began Dr.
Dillahay, but as soon as he spotted Freddy’s freshman
beanie, his “What—can-I—do-for-you" smile changed to his
“Oh-God—another-Freshman” grimace.

“As you can easily see, Mr. Freenwalter, I’m a very
busy man, so I’m sure you’ll make your business brief,”
he said in a tone that was more than a little unfriendly.

Freddy happened to glance down at Dr. Dillahay’s desk
and brieﬂy wondered what Thrilling Detective magazine had
to do with the running of a physics department, but went
ahead and bravely stated his business.

“Sir, I believe that I have made a discovery which will
be of great interest to you, your department, and our ﬁne
university.”

As far as Dr. Dillahay was concerned, the mere idea that
a freshman could ever contribute anything worthwhile to
anything was utterly inconceivable, and he started to say so.

But before Dr. Dill.ahay could open his mouth, Freddy
drew himself up to his full ﬁve—foot-three and announced,
“I have discovered an anti-gravity machine!” Dr. Dillahay
started to laugh, but Freddy went on. “Honest, sir, right
this minute it’s at home in my basement. It’s tied to an
anvil to keep it from ﬂying away. It’s really funny how it
all came about. You see, a few days ago . . .”

“Just a minute,” roared Dr. Dillahay. “Now calm down!
You say you have discovered an anti-gravity device?”

“Yessir.”

“Deliver m e fr 0 In
Freshmen and Idiots,”

“I am too busy to take care of this myself, my boy, but I
know just the man I can stick wi . . . er, I mean who will
be interested in looking at your new invention. The ﬁrst
thing tomorrow, you bring it here and ask for Mr. Beegler.
I’m sure that you two will get along just ﬁne together.”

The next day, his pipe belching clouds of smoke, Mr.
Beegler charged into Dr. Dillahay’s oﬂice with Freddy in
hot pursuit. “My God, Dillahay,” screamed Mr. Beegler,
“He’s really done it! The thing is tied to an anvil and
straining at the rope like a gas balloon on a string.”

Dr. Dillahay had a few varied thoughts about the quality
of people getting into colleges these days and snorted, “Can’t
you people do anything without my supervision? This fresh-
man couldn’t have done as you claim. Let me see this
infernal machine and I’ll end this foolishness once and
for all.”

Sure enough, when they got to the lab there was an
anvil ﬂoating just above the ﬂoor with a rope stretching
tautly up to a strange conglomeration of wires, tubes,
condensers, resistors, and other miscellaneous pieces of
apparatus.

“The anvil is almost heavy enough to keep it down,”
Mr. Beegler was saying. “It still has to be held down if
you take it outside though.” ,

But Dr. Dillahay wasn’t hearing a word; he just stood
there opening and closing his mouth like a ﬁsh out of water.
“It can’t be. It just can’t be!” he gasped when he ﬁnally
found his voice.

“It can’t be, but it is,” said Mr. Beegler.

“It is not,” snorted Dr. Dillahay. “It must be some
simple magnetic effect due to the steel beams in this build-
ing. Let’s take it outside and see what happens.”

“Er . . . ah . . . , Dr. Dillahay, I don’t think we should,”
stammered Freddy. “If it ever got away . . .”

“Nonsense. You and Mr. Beegler can sit on it. What’s
the matter, can’t your
little trick stand up to an
objective scientiﬁc test?”

thought Dr. Dillahay
raising his eyes heaven-
ward. Then suddenly he
got an idea.

Like many college
professors, Dr. Dillahay
had a pet project. He
was working to induce
piezoelectric currents in
a non-crystalline materi-
al, namely a mixture of
coffee grounds in chicken
fat. One of his assist-
ants, a mere graduate
student no less, had the
audacity to question the
workability of his idea.
That had been the dis-
turbed gentleman with
the pipe that Freddy had
just seen leaving the
office.

“Oh, yessir, but . . .”

“But nothing! Outside
I say!”

Out on the lawn,
Freddy and Mr. Beegler,
whose pipe had long
since gone out, sat on the
anvil while Dr. Dillahay
poked in the innards of
the device with a long
screwdriver.

“Be careful, sir,
warned Freddy, “I‘ve al-
ready gotten a bad shock
from it.”

“How could you?
There’s no power supply
except these two ﬂash-
light batteries.”

“I don’t understand it
either sir, but please be
careful.”

“How did you come about making this anyway?” asked
Dr. Dillahay, probing even deeper into the machine.

“Well sir, it started out to be a citizen’s band transceiver.
I was making it from a plan in an electronics magazine,
when I guess the page must have ﬂipped over and I built
half of it from plans for an underground metals detector.
I think there are a few parts from an automatic garage door
opener too. When I saw what I’d done, I started to take
it apart. but I touched something and got an awful shock.
When I woke up the thing was stuck against the ceiling.
It was an awful job tying it to the anvil.”

Dr. Dillahay was only half aware of what Freddy was
saying. He pointed to a shiny black knob and demanded,
“What does this thing do?”

Freddy pondered that for a minute and replied, “I’m not
sure. I didn’t want to go poking around because I was
afraid I’d shut it off or something and not be able to start
it up again. By the way, Dr. Dillahay, don’t you think
we should try to draw a schematic before we do anything
drastic?”

“Nonsense! How do you expect to get anywhere if you

26

don’t take a few chances?” With this he gave the knob

a vicious twist.

The anvil, Freddy, and Mr. Beegler shot up like a bullet.
Freddy screamed and jumped, Mr. Beegler screamed and
hung on. Hung on, that is until he tore through the branches
of a large oak directly overhead. (He was later rescued
with no more serious injury than a broken pipestem which
he had bitten clean in half.) Freddy sat down and cried.
Dr. Dillahay just looked up at the vanishing black speck
and said, “You see, my boy, I told you it wasn’t practical,
no control at all.”

This ends our little story except for one short post script.
On an inside page of Pravda, the following item appeared
the next day.

“Dr. Igor Kramovich, director of the Moscow Observa-
tory reported tracking an object which resembled a common
anvil soaring oil into space on a seemingly aimless course.
As the Soviet Union engages only in scientiﬁc research
which will further our knowledge of outer space, this was
thought to be a grandstand play by the Yankee lmperialists
of Wall Street solely for propaganda purposes.”

 

lReflecitions of Telstar

Remember the picture above? It flashed across your
television screen on a hot night last July. Perhaps
you remember that it originated from France. And
that it reached the U. 8. via Telstar, the world's first
private enterprise communications satellite.

Since that summer night, the Bell System's Telstar
has relayed electronic signals of many types—tele-
vision broadcasts, telephone calls, news photographs,
and others.

But there's one Telstar reflection you might have
missed. Look into the faces of the Bell System people
below and you'll see it. It is the reflection of Te|star’s

 

success that glowed brightly on the faces of all who
shared in the project.

Their engineering, administrative and operations
skills created Telstar and are bringing its benefits
down out of the clouds to your living room.

These Bell System people, through their talented,
dedicated efforts, make your phone service still better,
more economical, and more useful.

The reflections of Telstar are many.

maps from the air

The modern age of mapmaking began in 1850 with the idea of making maps from terrestrial
photography. Today this process, known as photogrammetry, has grown into a huge industry
that will soon be producing nearly all future maps. . . .

In the year 1850, Colonel Aime
Laussedat of the French Army began
to experiment with the idea of making
maps from terrestrial photography.
Because this was the ﬁrst time that
photographs had ever been used in this
way and for that reason, Colonel
Laussedat is called the father of
photogrammetry.

The word photogrammetry means
the art or science of taking accurate
measurements from photography. Al-
though this early work by Laussedat
was greatly hampered by the lack of
photographic equipment, he was able
to turn out a fairly reliable map. Soon
after Colonel Laussedat ﬁnished com-
piling his map, another Frenchman
nicknamed Nadar ascended into the
skies above Paris in a captive balloon
to take photos which he hoped would
enable him to make a street map of
Paris. Although Nadar’s balloon was
blown off course, he did obtain some
pictures of the small village of Petit
Bicetre, and his mission was quite suc-
cessful. The photographs that he took
were very clear; streets and even build-
ings could be distinguished.

Very little progress was made over
the next ﬁfty years. Then, in 1900 a
Canadian Edouard Deville developed
the ﬁrst practical method of using
stereoscopic photographs in a single
instrument for drawing a map. The
photography used by Deville was a
stereoscopic pair taken from a photo-
theodolite. (Phototheodolite pictures
are those taken from cameras on the
ground as contrasted to those taken
from the air.) Since the beginning of
the twentieth century the development
of photogrammetry has been more
rapid. Although the progress of the
science on this continent was at ﬁrst
very slow, the development of aerial
photography during World War I gave
the science of photogrammetry a new
lift.

The use of aerial photos for mapping
practically made the phototheodolite
method obsolete. Although the use
of ground photography had previously
been very successful, and had been
used in mapping the Alps, and also
employed by the U. S. Geological Sur-
vey in Alaska, aerial photography
proved more advantageous for making
maps. The airplane itself made a
wonderful platform for the camera. It
could cover large areas in a relatively
short amount of time. Today, almost
all of the mapping done by photo-
grammetric methods uses aerial pho-
tography.

. by William E. Few., Jr.

With the development of aerial pho-
tography came many problems. There
were no stereo—plotting machines yet
developed that could handle aerial
photos. The military then began to
realize the importance of aerial pho-
togrammetry and invested a large
amount of money in setting up recon-
naissance technical units throughout
their ranks. These outﬁts proved to
be invaluable during World War II
and in Korea.

The great value of the three—dimen-
sional concept that was used with aerial
photos is evidenced from an incident
of the Korean conﬁict where a young

airman received a battleﬁeld commis-
sion for his outstanding work as a
photointerpreter. He was working
with a team trying to locate the North
Korean airﬁeld that was sending MIG-
17’s to strafe our ground forces. The
only airﬁeld that was in the area where
the MIG planes could come from had
seemingly been completely destroyed
by bombs. Photographs taken over
the ﬁeld showed huge bomb craters in
the middle of the runway. After many
hours of studying the pictures through
a stereoscope, which is an instrument
that allows the viewer to see the photos
in three dimensions, the airman dis-
covered that the bomb holes did not
seem to have any depth. He reported
this to his supervisor and planes were
sent out to bomb the ﬁeld again. The
next day the MIGs were missing from

the scene, and never did come again
to ﬁre upon our ground forces. The
North Koreans had been painting bomb
holes on the runways and aerial pho-
tography was responsible for this dis-
covery. Numerous incidents like these
have given photogrammetry a perma-
nent place in our military.

Although photogrammetry is used
greatly throughout the military and the
government, it also has a very wide
range of uses commercially. In geolo-
gy, thousands of square miles, have
been photographed from the air in at-
tempts to determine the location of oil.
It is being used in medicine, tax assess-
ment, and very extensively in highway
planning. Photogrammetry is even
being used to evaluate stock pile vol-
ume for America’s large steel industry.
In stock pile computation, the pile is

Volume of the pile is computed from
the contours using an equation similar
to that for the volume of a pyramid.
In medicine, precise measurements can
be made from X—ray pictures, permit-
ting the doctor to know the exact loca-
tion of foreign objects or tumors inside
the body. Photogrammetry can be
used to study how the spine deforms
during pregnancy and after childbirth.
Photogrammetry is used extensively in
a very large number of ﬁelds, from
highway engineering to archaeology.
This article will discuss only a small
part of the wide uses of photogram-
metry. That part will be: map—making
from aerial photographs. This is prob-
ably the most important branch of the
science of photogrammetry.

Before aerial mapping was accepted
as the best method for compiling topo-
graphic and planimetric maps, large
amounts of time and money were spent
in securing an accurate map by ground
surveying methods. Maps were c.om—
piled from data obtained by surveyors
covering the area on foot. Aerial map-
ping has been able to cut the time for
making maps by ﬁfty percent and re-
duce the cost of preliminary planning
by sixty percent. Another advantage
of aerial mapping is the overall view
that the planner obtains before the
maps are actually completed.

In highway design for example, the
planner will look at the photos and
pick out the best possible route for the
highway. He then contracts the map-
ping company to make topographic
maps of this area. For highway plan-
ning, the photographs are usually taken
from an altitude of about 3,000 feet.
These pictures of great detail enable
accurate maps to be made; in fact,
ninety percent of all elevations are
accurate to within one—half of the con-
tour interval. (The contour interval
is the difference in elevation between
two consecutive contours. For exam-
ple, if contours are drawn at every ten
foot change in elevation of the ground,
the contour interval is ten feet.)

The ﬁrst step in producing the map
is securing the photographs. There
are two ways that a mapping company
usually obtains its photography. The
company, if it is very large, will have
its own plane, or it may hire one of

5'- .

‘vi

~/«\-

the many free lance photographic crews
around the country. The instrument
used to take photos from the air re-
sembles a motion picture camera in
many ways. The shutter is set to open
and close with a speed that is syn-
chronized with that of the airplane and
at an interval that gives the photographs
an overlap of sixty percent. After tak-
ing pictures in a straight line from one
end of the proposed area to the other,
the pilot brings the plane thr.ough a
180 degree turn and ‘starts back parallel
and just slightly overlapping his ﬁrst
ﬂight line. He continues to ﬂy in over-
lapping parallel lines until the complete
area has been photographed in small
parts.

Now that photographs have been
taken of the entire area that is to be
mapped, the ﬁlm is sent to the photo-
lab. It is developed and contact prints
are made. The next step in the map-
ping process is perhaps the most im-
portant, that of securing the control.
The contact prints are moved from the
lab to the surveying and control depart-
ment. One of the members of the sur-
veying party, usually the party chief,
then begins to study the photos to

determine the best locations for vertical T

and horizontal control. When he ﬁnds
these locations where control is neces-
sary, he puts a small red circle on the
photo. For horizontal control, a blue
triangle is usually marked on the
photograph.

The complete set of pictures that
cover the whole job area is then given
to the ﬁeld survey crew and taken out
to the project area. It is the job of
the surveyor to ﬁnd the spot on the
ground exactly corresponding to the
one marked on the photo. If vertical
control is required, he must, through
deﬁnite surveying techniques, ﬁnd the
elevation of this spot above sea level
and mark this elevation on the back
of the picture. For horizontal control,
he must specify the coordinates of the
point either in degrees north and east,
or as a measured distance from some
known location. After all of the cir—.
cles or triangles have been accurately
marked with elevation or location, the
surveyor’s part in this project is ﬁnished
and the photos are taken back to the
oﬂice.

During the same period of time that
the ﬁeld crew has been out securing

U  F

the control, the photo—lab has been
printing the photos on sensitized glass
plates called diapositives. The ﬁlm
negatives are inserted into the diaposi—
tive reduction printer and printed as
a positive upon the four inch square
piece of glass. It is from these glass
plates that the actual mapping will be

compiled; the glass plates and control
are taken to the compilation section.

It is here in the compilation section
that the actual mapping is completed
by the operator of the stereo plotter.
The stereo plotters that are used today
in aerial mapping have been developed

and improved since Deville ﬁrst dis-
covered the idea of using stereo vision
for compiling maps. Out of all of
those years of development, have come
machines of excellent quality and
amazing accuracy. These machines,
although very complex looking, operate
on a very fundamental idea. That idea
is stereo vision, a concept that most
people use every day without even
thinking about it.

The human eyes are found to be a
small distance apart, and it is this that
enables us to see in depth. Each eye
views an object from a different point
so that each one sees a slightly different
View of that object. When both of
these views are superimposed, a person
sees the object in three dimensions.
This exact same principle is used in
the stereo plotter.

When the airplane took the pictures,
it was in constant motion, therefore
each pair of overlapping photographs
has the same area on the ground, only
from different points. When the oper-

34

at.or inserts the glass plates in the pro-
jectors of the stereo plotting instrument,
he is recreating this effect. The over-
lapping area of the two glass plates is
projected down onto a large slate table
in two different colors, red and blue.
The operator uses a series of knobs to
adjust the projectors to a position ex-
actly the same as that of the plane when
the pictures were taken. If the airplane
was slightly banked then the projectors
will likewise be banked.

The technician then puts on bi-
colored spectacles, red and blue glasses.
If the projector that projects the red
light is on the right side, he adjusts the
spectacles so that his right eye looks
through the red glass. When the oper-
ator has the glasses on, he sees the
projection in three dimensions. Hills
and buildings stand up on the slate. It
is at this point that the control comes
back into the picture. The operator
takes a large sheet of paper and puts
it on top of the table. This paper has
previously been lined off with a grid

corresponding to the scale of the map,
and the horizontal control points have
been plotted according to their co-
ordinates. The technician then adjusts
the paper and the size of the projected
image until these points lie exactly at
the place that is deﬁned on the pro-
jection.

On top of the slate table is placed
a small movable tracing table, mounted
on a tripod. In the center of the trac-
ing table there is a ﬂat white disc,
called a platen,- that can be moved up
or down by turning a screw at the
bottom of. the tracing table. In the
center of the platen there is a small
pinpoint of white light, and when the
viewer focuses on the white dot, the
platen will disappear from sight. All
that the operator will see is a white
dot ﬂoating above the hills and build-
ings. By raising the platen with the
screw at the bottom of the tracing table,
and by moving the table around the
model, the technician can place the dot
in any position that he so desires. He
can put the dot on top of a church
steeple, or screw the platen down until
the pinpoint of light is on the ground.
The platen is connected mechanically
to a meter, and with every turn of the
screw the numbers on the meter change.
It is in this way that the operator can
read elevations around the model.

Now that the operator has the model
fairly well oriented, he must make it
level. He moves the tracing table to
one of the points where the vertical
control has been plotted by the survey
crew and sets the dot upon the ground.
After locking the platen in place with
the dot on the ground, he turns the
meter until it reads exactly the same as
the elevation given him by the ﬁeld
crew. Next he moves the table to the
other points on the model and checks
to see how they read. By turning large
screws at the sides of the plotter, he
then adjusts the level of the projectors
until all of the vertical control points
read according to their predetermined
elevation.

Now the map is ready to be drawn
on to the gridded paper. Directly be-
low the dot of light there is a sharpened
piece of graphite, and by pressing a
button at the rear of the tracing table,
the graphite drops down and hits the
paper. The operator then focuses the
white dot on the object that he wishes

/
«as


<"'<‘

to plot on the map, and traces on to
the paper. He continues to do this
until all of the features to be mapped
have been traced. The contours are
plotted by turning the screw on the
tracing table until the contour elevation
appears on the meter. The technician
then locks the platen at that elevation
and traces out a line at every point
where the dot hits the ground. He may
put the dot on the side of a hill, and
push the tracing table around the hill
until he runs into ‘the beginning of
his line.

...they collaborated across the centuries
to make life better today

In ancient China they “piped” water through hollow bamboo
sections, but they couldn’t shut it oﬁ‘. One day a workman
with an engineering mind bored a hole in a plug and ﬁtted
it into holes in the pipe. This was the ﬁrst plug valve.

Centuries later, the brilliant young mathematician and
scientist, Blaise Pascal, worked out the principle of hydraulics
for which he is famous: “A unit pressure applied to a liquid
contained in a sealed vessel is transmitted to every part of the
liquid with undiminished “force.”

In 1914, Sven Nordstrom, a young mining engineer, had
trouble with sticking, leaking valves on the acid lines at a
silver mine. By combining the plug cock idea of the ancient
Chinese with Pascal’s principle of hydraulics, he created a
new idea in ﬂow control: the lubricated plug valve.

Today, the Rockwell-Nordstrom lubricated plug Valve is
widely used in the petroleum and natural gas industries, in
chemical processing, and in general manufacturing. Its elli-
ciency helps cut the cost of many of the things you use every
day. And thanks to hundreds of engineering advances, the
original lubricated plug valve is still the most modern.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like
to work for, buy from, and invest in.

A young engineer was showing a visiting Russian the
skyline of New York City. The engineer pointed out one
of the skyscrapers and mentioned that it took only ten
months to build it. The Russian grinned and said it
could be built in ﬁve months in Russia. The engineer
pointed out another building and bragged that it was built
in only six months. The Russian laughed and said it
could be built in three months in Russia. The Russian
noticed the Empire State Building and asked how long it
took to build it. “You’ve got me,” said the engineer.
“It wasn’t there yesterday!”

The outﬁelder and the basketball center mentioned that they
had developed a new synthesis for oleﬁns via a phosphonate

work, and better yielding than the prior art had afforded.

selves for exposing photographic'materials. Yet a mere few
thousand thermal neutrons/mmz can give decent photographic
images, such as might be useful for neutron radiography (read
the wine level inside a lead amphora), neutron diffraction pat-
terns, neutron ﬂux measurements, etc. The topic of photo-
graphic detection of neutrons is too quiet for our liking. We
wish to have a little noise.

It is done by a triple play: thermal neutrons activate ‘°B to
emit alphas, which scintillate ZnS(Ag), which gives off visible
light that exposes the ﬁlm. For sharper images at the expense
of longer exposure time, neutron fans use an activation tech-
nique involving an appreciable half-life. There are gadolinium,

and a double bond is formed. You have to run the reaction in
a strongly basic medium. The new wrinkle is to achieve the
alkalinity you need by

dimethylformamide as
your solvent.”

“What happens,” add-
ed the kibitzer, “is the
phosphonate reacts with
the NaOCH3 in an equi-
librium reaction to form
phosphonate carbanion, which then performs a nucleophilic
attack on the aldehyde carbon. For what you want to do, your
aldehyde would be C6H5CH = CHCHO. So you get a situation
like this where the redistribution of electrons leads to formation
of the new double bond and leaves sodium diethyl phosphate.”

Howscientistsantl Engineers
Work Together in Industry

Q. Dr. Suits, I've heard a good deal about the scope of your programs. is your
research mostly in physics and electronics? ‘ I

A. This is a common misconception. The work of the many laboratories of Gen-
eral Electric "covers the waterfront” in science and in advanced engineering tech-
nology. Some laboratories specialize in electronics research, others in atomic power,
space technology, polymer chemistry, jet engine technology, and so forth. Actually,
the lar est single ﬁeld represented by the more than 1000 Ph.D. researchers in
Genera Electric is chemistry.

Q. Is this research performed principally by people with Ph.D. degrees in
science?

A. General Electric research covers a broad spectrum of basic and applied work.
At the Research Laboratory we focus largely on basic scientiﬁc investigations, much
as in a university, and most of the researchers are Ph.D.’s. In other Company
laboratories, where the focus is on applied science and advanced engineering, engi-
neers and scientists with BS. and M.S. degrees predominate. Formal college training
is an important preparation for research, but research aptitudes, and especially
creative abilities, are also very important qualities.

Q. What are the opportunities for engineers in industrial scientific research
and how do scientists and engineers work together in General Electric?

A. Classically, engineers have been concerned with the problem “how,” and
scientists with the question “why.” This is still true, in general, although in ad-
vanced development and in technological work scientists and engineers work
hand-in-hand. Very close cooperation takes place, especially in the increasingly
important ﬁelds of new materials, processes, and systems. Certainly in General
Electric, a person’s interest in particular kinds of problems and his ability to solve
them are more important than the college degree that he holds.

Q. What does it mean to an engineer to have the support of a large scientific
research effort?

A. It means that the engineer has ready access to the constant stream of new
concepts, new materials, and new processes that originate in research, and which
may aid his effort to solve practical problems. Contact with research thus provides
a “window” on new scientiﬁc developments—world-wide.

Q. How does General Electric go about hiring engineers and scientists?

A. During each academic year, highly qualiﬁed technical people from General
Electric make recruiting visits to most college campuses. These men represent
more than 100 General Electric departments and can discuss the breadth of G.E.’s
engineering and science opportunities with the students. They try to match the
interests of students and the Company, and then arrange interview visits. The
result of this system is a breadth of opportunity within one company which is
remarkable.

Experienced technical people are always welcome, and they are usually put in
contact with a speciﬁc Company roup. Where no a parent match of interests exists,
referrals are made throughout eneral Electric. n all cases, one ﬁnds technical
men talking to technical men in a really professional atmosphere.

Q. Are there training programs in research for which engineering students
might be qualified?

A. There certainly are. Our 2-year Research Training Program at the General
Electric Research Laboratory gives young scientists a chance to work with ex-
perienced industrial research scientists before carrying out research and develop-
ment on their own. .

In addition, there are seven Company-wide training programs. Those that attract
the largest number of technical graduates are the Engineering and Science,
Technical Marketing, and Manufacturing Training Programs. Each includes on-the-
job experience supplemented by a formal study curriculum.

Of course, not all graduates are hired for training programs. In many cases,
individuals are placed directly into permanent positions for which they are suited
by ability and interest.
