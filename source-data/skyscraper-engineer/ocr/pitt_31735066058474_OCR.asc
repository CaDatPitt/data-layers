As editor of Skyscraper Engineer Magazine, I would
like to congratulate you all on finishing another year at Pitt
and welcome you to another great issue of our magazine.
Many of you will be graduating this year, eitherto proceed
further in your education or begin yourcareers. Years from
now, when you are thinking about your years here, you may
find an old copy of our magazine; hopefully, we can serve
as a true representation of the character of this university.
The articles in this magazines include such diverse topics
as the environment and an interesting area of physics
research. Of special note is an article on the organization
and goals of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which I
will again mention later in this editorial. This year we are
publishing one issue. In future years we hope to publish
more often, but our primary goal remains quality. We are
an award winning publication, and although it takes a good
deal of time and energy to maintainthis level, it is well worth
the effort, even if it means a reduction in quantity. I certainly
hope you enjoy reading this issue as much as we enjoyed
publishing it.

Since this time last year the magazine has undergone
many organizational changes. The most significant of our
accomplishments is being certified as an official student
organization and receiving funds from the Student Govern-
ment Board. This particular goal had always been some-
thing that the officers of Skyscraper wanted to pursue, and
we are very pleased to have finally attained this status.
Special thanks for this should go to Lisa Steel (for writing
and revising the budget), to Steve Frezza (a former editor
of Skyscraper who advised us and was extremely suppor-
tive and encouraging), and of course, to myself (for writing
the constitution). The necessity for this move arose from
the fact that several years ago we disassociated ourselves
from Engineering Student Cabinet, and being indepedent,
we were forced to ask the School of Engineering for
funding. Althoughthis situation persisted for severalyears,
it was quite an inconvenience for both the magazine and
the school. Thus, our certification freed us from any
obligation to the School of Engineering and freed them from
the financial burden of supporting our magazine.

Additionally, last yearwe had some organizational staff
problems. While they are not really worth explaining, let it
suffice to say that they could have caused the end of the
magazine. This year, however, we have recruited an
exceptional staff, one which will continue to provide this
magazine with the support that has always made it an
excellent publication. With the level of organization and
enthusiasm we have reached, we hope that Skyscraperwill
never again be afflicted with uncertainty or apathy. Expan-
sion of our staff is, of course, a primary goal, particularly
outside of the School of Engineering. Our comrades in the
College of Arts and Sciences have many good things to
say, and our magazine is presently the only undergraduate
publication of its kind. As readers and publishers we all
surely desire increased diversity.

A rather interesting (and sometimes hostile) contro-
versy was created by an article in our last issue (March
1988). This article dealt with the business aspects of
Westinghouse, and put forth an opinion about their organi-
zation which many found objectionable. As editor, I could
not censorthe article, since it would have been against my
own personal beliefs; however, both Lisa Steel and I
disagreed with the article. Lisa and I have close ties to
Westinghouse; our fathers work for Westinghouse, and we
are both recipients of the Westinghouse Family Scholar-
ship. Thus, in the interest of fairness to Westinghouse, the
University of Pittsburgh, and our own opinions, we have
written another article examining the goals and ethics of
Westinghouse Electric Corporation. We wish to stress,
however, that neither the former article nor the article in this
magazine represent in any way the School of Engineering
of the University of Pittsburgh. Skyscraper Engineer
Magazine consists entirely of undergraduate students, and
thus we are the only ones responsible for what we write and
publish.

In closing I would like to encourage all of you to do well
and always keep in mind the benefits that eventually
accompany hard work. For the freshmen in particular this
may not be greatly encouraging, but just remember that we
have all been through the same pressure. College is a time
of enlightenment and growing, and everyone should take
full advantage of the opportunities offered through the

University of Pittsburgh. Always rememberthat an educa-
tion involves many things outside of the classroom; only
you can create your experiences, and only you can make
your time here worthwhile.

Westinghouse
Today

by Lisa Steel

in 1988 this magazine contained an article by a
graduating staff member critical of some of the policies
undertaken by Westinghouse Corporation. While we com-
pletely support our staff's right to publish their own
viewpoints on issues concerning the technicalcommunity,
we feel an obligation to be fair to that community. In
recognition of the symbyotic relationship that has evolved

between university and industry,  LEmmﬂ
felt it necessary to present a second view of Westing-
house.

This author's view of Westinghouse developed, as for
many other Pittsburghers, as a familiarity with something
that's always been there, and as such is part of what
defines what “there" is. Numerous associations with vari-
ous charities, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Pitts-
burgh Pirates make this corporation part of my community.
Here I look at what it is that defines Westinghouse, how it
has changed, and what it is trying to be. According to the
corporation's 1987 Annual Report:

Westinghouse Electric Corporation is a diversified,
global technology-based corporation whose goal is to
increase the value of shareholder's investment through
effective financial management, revenue growth, im-
proved operating profit and efficient asset utilization.The
principal business arenas of Westinghouse are television
and radio broadcasting, defense electronics, financial
services and the industrial, construction and electric utility
markets. Complementing these core businesses are op-
erations serving selected “niche" markets such as vehicle
transport refridgeration equipment, community develop-
ment and beverage bottling.‘

Most of this is foreign to me, but one point of departure I do
understand is that Westinghouse’s corporate personality
today as in its genesis is shaped by engineering types.

Eaclsnmund_f:ls2ts=.s

The history of Westinghouse begins 102 years ago
with the chartering of the Westinghouse Electric Company
by the state of Pennsylvania on January 8, 1886. Founder
George Westinghouse from the outset faced public fears
that alternating-current presented greater health and
safety risks than the direct-current then in use in the United
States. Westinghouse emerged from this opposition to
develop in every major area of power to become today a
major supplierto the electric utility industry and a manufac-
turer of a complete line of machinery and products for the
generation, distribution, and control of electricity. Early
development of a.c. power transmission was facilitated by
such Westinghouse scientists as William Stanley, who
developed transformers and equipment for a multiple
system of distribution; Nikola Tesla, who developed induc-
tion motors and George Westinghouse’s polyphase sys-
tem of transmission; and Oliver Shallenberger, who de-
vised measuring equipment.

Alternating-current quickly moved to the forefront
of the power industry. The first use of high tension current
for commercial lighting occurred at Great Barrington, Mas-
sachusetts in 1886. By 1895, Westinghouse had installed
three - 5000 horsepower generators to harness the power
of Niagara Falls. The company established the first indus-
trial research laboratory in 1904. Operations and the scope
of products thus expanded: Westinghouse developed the
first commercial turbine generator units, and the first elec-
tric motor drives for steel-mill rollers.

With the pioneering of a.c. power and the expan-
sion of operations came difficulties. In 1891 Westinghouse
was forced to reorganize to avoid insolvency. A second up-
heaval ensued in 1907: following this second upheaval,
George Westinghouse was relieved of its chairmanship,
and the company went into a receivershipfor one year. The
reorganized Westinghouse Electric Company surmounted
these financial. difficulties to pioneer a different field:
employee social services. In 1907, the company created

the first sickness benefit plan. A retirement plan followed
in 1915, a group life insurance provision in 1920, and a
greivance committee for working conditions was estab-
lished in 1920. By World War I Westinghouse was well
established in the power industry and thus became an
important military supplier. The first commercial radio
broadcast was made by Westinghouse on November 2,
1920; from a shed built on the roof of a Westinghouse plant
were broadcast the returns on the Warren Harding-James
Cox. In 1919, Westinghouse cooperated with General
Electric and other companies to create the Radio Corpora-
tion of America; a second such agreement lead to the
creation of the National Broadcasting Company in 1926.
This cooperation is considered to have been a crucial move
in wresting control of American radio communication from
the British Macaroni Company. Following World War I,
Westinghouse manufactured radio apparatus, developed
an appliance line, supplied giant generating equipment for
the Boulder Dam and other such sites, and developed the
first industrial atom smasher. The company's research into
purified uranium made it the only source of supply for the
development of the atomic bomb. By World War II,
Westinghouse Corporation employed more than 70,000
people and produced more than $3 billion in war materials.

In 1945 Westinghouse Electric Company was
renamed Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Following
World War II, they supplied nuclear power units for the first
nuclear submarines, cruisers, and aircraft carriers, and
designed and built the first nuclear power plant (opened
December 18, 1957 in Shippingport, Pennsylvania). Since
then Westinghouse scientists designed and built launching
systems for the Polaris missile and developed the nose
cone for spaceships, enabling reentry into the earth's
atmosphere. The research operations at Westinghouse
have made significant contributions to laser technology,
coal gasification, solar energy, and nuclear waste disposal
and have keptthe company in the foreground oftechnologi-
caladvance.

During the late 1960's and continuing through the
early 1970's, Westinghouse, like many other corporations
of the time, took the conglomerate route, adding various
businesses to complement its “heavy” industrial manufac-
turing. Unfortunately, managingthis enormous diversifica-
tion into 135 separate businesses detracted from the
traditionally strong ones, and profits slackened. The
company nearly topppled after an unlucky bet on uranium
prices in the mid-1970’s. Westinghouse continued to be a
major electrical equipment manufacturer and a leading
producer of nuclear power reactors, but lagged behind
General Electric in sales of home appliances; Westing-
house finally ceased manufacturing appliances in 1975.
Yet in 1975 a turnaround was started by the company's
chairman R.E. Kirby. Kirby brought to Westinghouse a
strategic planning approach which forced management to
consider every option for enhancing shareholder value and

generating capital return within each business. Douglas
Danforth, who became chairman in 1983, continued and
expanded the strategic planning approach. Under Dan-
forth, Westinghouse reversed its earlier trend towards
overdiversification by selling or separating 46 of the com-
panies orperations, leaving the corporation at a more
manageable size. In 1986, Westinghouse raised $2.1
billion ($1.7 billion in cash) from the sale of Group W cable
television, and used part of this revenue to buy back 35
million shares (14 percent of the companies stock) in order
to increase earnings per share. In addition, $791 million
was set aside to cover losses from restructuring. In
response to the changes and restructuring, T.J. Peters,
author of  , comments, “Westing-
house has created a magnificent revolution”?

MaLo.us_and.l.eQsz

Meanwhile, two managers within the company
were making tremendous progress in this restructuring:
John Marcus and Paul Lego. Both Marcus and Lego have
spent their entire careers at Westinghouse. Both come
from working-class Pennsylvania families. Both studied
electrical engineering at the Unversity of Pittsburgh on the
GI bill. Their view of Westinghouse: if adivision performs,
keep it; otherwise, dump it. The pair gained early expertise
in the radical restructuring that many companies went
through years later. In 1970, Lego carried out Marcus‘
cost-cutting strategy for turning around the Westinghouse
semiconductor business. As managers under Danforth,
Marcus and Lego undertook the task of rescuing the
Industries and International Group, whose products in-
cluded electrical equipment forthe construction and indus-
trial markets. Marcus and Lego moved the Group from
marginal businesses, closed inefficient plants, and mod-
ernized the rest. After two years of losses totaling $23
million, the Industries and International Group produced
$152 million in operating profit on $3.8 billion in sales. The
two have sold traditionally “sacred cows" such as the lamp
business in 1983, and most of the small motors business in
1986.

At this time, Marcus and Lego were considered by many
to be runners up to Thomas J. Murrin, Westinghouse’s top
man in Energy and defense. However, following their
successes in restructuring in the Industries and Interna-
tional Group, Marous was chosen to succeed Danforth as
Chairman beginning January 1, 1988. Furthermore, Lego
was chosed as President and Chief Operating Officer, and
is scheduled to take over as CEO and Chairman after
Marous’ retirement in three years. Shortly after this an-
nouncement, Murrin announced his retirement.

When I began to think about summer in the middle of
Winter Term last year, I definitely desired to do something
with a little less stmcture than my 18 credit hour semester.
How rebellious things would become could only be specu-
lated upon. It was during this time that I began my work in
Dr. James Maher’s physics lab. I had no idea that by the
time the summer was over I would be doing some pretty
chaotic things. I was entering the world of chaos research.

 . The very phrase seems oxyrnoronic.
How is it possible to systematically study and classify
something which has no regularities in structure, no perio-
dicity, no end to its complexity? On the other hand, how
can we avoid studying a subject which is applicable to
almost everything that occurs in the real world? In truth
chaos can be studied and has been approachedfrom many
fields of inquiry, such as meteorology, physics, mathemat-
ics, and biology. Much of what is called chaos research

Q:

revolves around the search for patterns in chaos. These
patterns are often extremely complex, requiring advanced
mathematical (particularly geometrical) knowledge to
understand fully. However, these patterns often have
fascinatingly beautiful graphical representations which are
easily recognizable.

The history of chaos begins at the limits of various
scientific fields with the unanswerable questions of these
fields. Why can't we predict the weather with long-range
accuracy? This quandry has puzzled meteorologists for
years. There are only a fixed number of possible weather
patterns, and the atmospheric situations leading to these
patterns are well known. Yet our best forecasts stretch
possibly a week into the future with accuracy, then rapidly
break down into confusion. Why does this happen? The
current answer to this problem is a concept called the
Butterfly Effect, discovered by Edward Lorenz. Imagine, if
you can, that the wind generated by a butterfy’s wings in
Japan affects weather patterns in California. If this notion
is bizarre to you, conduct the following thought experiment.
You seek to predict weather accurately all over the globe,
so you place instmments which measure the exact mete-
orological conditions over every square foot of the earth.
So you have covered the world with these instmments
spaced one foot apart. No matter how accurate the
measurements are, there will not only be errors in the
measurements but also deviations in between each of the
measuring devices. Gradually over a scale as large as the
earth these errors and deviations “add up" to change the
course of global weather. What is more important is that
these deviations defy prediction! It is also amazing that
such short term chaos leads to only a fixed number of
weather patterns. Lorenz introduced chaos theory into
science, but his work was buried in obscure meteorological
journals which no othertype of scientist would expect to find
such an important discovery. ~

Lorenz also discovered one of the beautiful pictures of
early chaos work——the Lorenz attractor. In this drawing in
three-space the trajectory of the line never intersects itself.
This meansthat the system neveris in the same state twice,
hence it never repeats. Also interesting to note is that the
Lorenz attractor has a pattern, a form “hidden within a
disorderly stream of data," according to James Gleick in his
book Qnags.

Another area in which chaos research has proved
useful in describing situations is ecology. One of the real
problems in ecology is describing population. Ecologists
generally calculate population functions and iterations of
population functions to determine a given population's
history. By iterating backward through these functions a
‘feed back” loop is set up. A simple linear function will not
suffice to explain population, because the function will
“blow up" to astronomically large numbers or dwindle to a
minute size without apparent reason and without taking into
account important and realistic factors such as environ-
ment. To compensate for this inaccuracy, ecologists
included a limiting term that keeps the population growth
within reasonable standards. Theirfurther calculations led
them to believe that the population would rise to a certain
level and then oscillate around that level. Then Robert
May, a biologist, showed how many of the environmental
parameters could be graphed on one “bifurcation diagram"
which showed the evolution of the population. A bifurcation
is just a splitting of one branch into two distinct branches
different from the first. May's diagrams included a chaotic
region, where the bifurcations of bifurcations ceased to be
regular and broke down into unpredicability. This chaotic
region explained why large shifts in the level of population
could be linked to small changes in the parameters of the
argument. Populations could fluctuate wildly from year to
year, then settle into a predictable cycle, only to fluctuate
again in the future. This conclusion is not very comforting,
for it tells us that our ability to predictthe size of a population
in the future is severely limited.

Chaos also found mathematical support in the work of
such mathematicians as Benoit Mandelbrot. Mandelbrot,
the father of fractal geometry, discovered the most intricate
and complex set in mathematics, aptly called the Mandel-
brot set. This set is a mapping in the complex plane. it you
visualize the real number line as the x-axis and the imagi-
nary number line as the y-axis, you have described the
complex plane, which encompasses all possible numbers,
from 1 to 2+3i to e"7i to pi. Mandelbrot was working on an
image that he hoped would describe all of the Julia sets, a
rich and varied group of shapes discovered in France in the
early part of this century. When Mandelbrot began to
explore the image, he found that he ran out of computer
memory befor he ran out of complexity. The image looks
a little odd, but the real quirk was that no matter how much
you magnified aportion of the set, you always saw an
intricate image which was different from any other part of
the set. This set was infinitely complex and infinitely novel.
The image of the Mandelbrot set has become one of the
trademarks of the chaos research movement.

These are just three of the problems discussed in
James Gleick's book 
ence, an excellent biography of the scientists who were the
early pioneers of chaos research. Although this book

presents the problems in a relatively inexact and unmathe-
matical way, this book shows the range and scope of the
problems encountered in chaos research, if not the depth.

Where did my summer job intersect this wonderfully
broad topic of chaos? The experiments I worked on dealt
with fluid dynamics and, in particlar, some of the more
complex (and nonlinear) systems. I studied what hap-
pened to the interface between two immiscible fluids as one
is driven towards the other. In three dimensions this
problem would prove impossibly complex, so we found a
way to constrain the experiment to two dimensions.

This constraint was accomplished through the use of a
Hele-Shaw cell (H-S cell), which contains the fluid flow
between two parallel plates whose separation distance is
arbitrarily small compared to any other distance in the
problem. The flow between the plates is for all intents and
purposes two dimensional. The cell in the experiment I
conducted consisted of two large pieces of plate glass in an
aluminum housing. The immiscible liquids we used were
heavy mineral oil and nitrogen" gas. By driving the gas
through the H-S cell, fingering patterns form along the
interface.

In an open cell the initial fingering process is chaotic,
but the eventual “steady state” is known. The system will
progress to a system containing only one finger of gas
moving through the oil. The rest of the fingers will “die off",
or cease to develop. This result was predicted by Saffman
and Taylor in 1958 (Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser A 245,
312). My summerjob was concerned about exploring what
happens between a known initial state and the predictable
final state; however, there was a new twist in this experi-
ment. By placing dividers at one end of the channel, we
were able to set up fourteen separate steady states, one in
each divider. When these fingers reached the open chan-
nel, they had to compete against each other until the final
steady state is reached.

There were many difficulties associated with the im-
plementation of the experiment. For example, one difficulty
was associated with the pressure of the nitrogen gas. The
gas was introduced into the cell from a brass reservoir at
one end of the H-8 cell. This brass reservoir had a
connection in its center which led to a nitrogen gas tank.
Pressure was applied or relieved by manipulating the
valves on the gas tank or the quick shut-off valve on the
reservoir. At first I thought that the pressure should be
uniform throughout the reservoir, but experience showed
that the fingers of nitrogen in the center of the cell grew
much fasterthan those fingers on the sides. By introducing
a crude baffle into the gas reservoir, l was able to create a
much more uniform pressure and, hence, a fairer “race" to
the channel for all of the fingers.

Another major problem was the dividers themselves.
At first we used plastic dividers held in place in the channel
by a brass bracket. These plastic dividers slid around

easily in the oil, however, and it was extremely difficult to
keep them parallel to each other. We replaced the plastic
dividers with brass dividers, which are more massive and
less likely to skew. Parallel dividers were extremely impor-
tant to create in each divider similar initial conditions.
The last major difficulty encountered was deciding how
much pressure to apply to the cell. Too much pressure and
the phenomena to be studied would destroy itself; fingers
would combine with otherfingers instead of competing, and
the glass plates may deform slightly,infIuencing behavior.
I ran this H-S cell over forty times this summer, with
varying degrees of success. The problems mentioned
presented themselves while the experiment was in prog-
ress, so the experiment became refined by trial and error.
Data acquisition was accomplished by photographing
the development of the fingers from overhead, at rates of 2
to 4 frames per second. I then, with the help of Dr. Maher,
selected the best of these runs and digitized representative

pictures to find the length of each finger. The behavior we
were looking for could not be adequately described by the
unmodified fingerlengths. We had to make a correlation
function to correlate the fingerlengths and allow direct
comparison between earlier and later frames. We found
that runs started with a positive correlation in the first
frames and then showed a sharp negative correlation a few
frames later; this led us to believe that every other finger
was “dying off". The work on this experiment is not yet
completed, but a more detailed and scientific account of
this experiment shall be available in a forthcoming paper.

Chaos research is one of the current “hot topics" of
science. Much of today's scientific investigation is devoted
to the study of anomolous behavior, of disordered states of
matter, and of turbulence in fluid systems. The ideas
explored on these frontiers lead to a new understanding of
the world around us.

Engineer's Week Happenings

This years Engineer's Week promises to be better than
ever. Eric Jagun, Engineering Week Planning Committee
chairman, along with Kristen Hasni (his assistant) have
planned lots of exciting changes. All of the traditional
events will still be held, but with the innovative new ideas
of Sarah Cunningham, Sue Neumeister and the other
event chairpersons Engineer's Week 89' should be quite
impressive.

Everyone will want to be involved with Engineer's
Week this year. Even General Motors wants to be a part:
they are sending the Sunracer, a solar powered car de-
signed by Hughes Aircraft Coporation (a division of Gen-
eral Motors). The Sunracer will be displayed in Benedum
lobby March 30 and 31.

Because of the fantastic job done by Dave Emanul the
publicity director, not only will Dean Sorber and professors
from each department be judging the parade but they will
be joined by such Pittsburgh celeberties as channel four’s
Sally Wiggen and Bill Hillgrove and a member of the
Pittsburgh Steelers. The parade will be an extremely
exciting event with plenty of floats, the Pitt Band, and
hopefully special appearances by the Pirate Parrot and the
Pitt Panther.

Finally, the Soap Box course hasbeen changed. It will
contain a hairpin turn on University Drive behind the Learn-
ing Research Development Center. So be sure to lookfor
some creative new designs and plenty of action.

The theme for Engineer's Week 1989 is black and
white television shows. The schedule for Engineer's Week
is as follows:

Tuesday, March 28th: Enginuity. Involves designing
and building a mechanical device to perform a given task.
Participants must think creatively and dedicate lots of time.

Wednesday, March 29th: Game Night.

goals are to have Engineer's Week recognized throughout
the University, and to provide a true concept of the
Engineers at the University of Pittsburgh.

Perspectives

by Mark M. Belz

As an electrical engineering student, I often grow
weary of the highly technical and scientific subjects to
which I am exposed. Thus, in this article, I draw from my
past and convey to you one of the most fascinating expe-
riences in my life.

In the summer of 1985, l was just beginning to experi-
ence life. I was 16 years old, and continually pursued new
ideas and situations, as many curious young people do.
Being an exchange student was an alluring prospect. Iwas
entirely ignorant of how deeply I would be affected.

On the 24"‘ of June I embarked on my first international
experience. The paperwork had been simple; my brand
new passport was ready to be stamped. Flying to another
continent with a group of people my age, many with similar
hopes and prospects, was an almost dreamlike experi-
ence. Our preparation for the new culture was brief
(perhaps too brief), and we were placed with our host
families.

Life in my temporary home was good. My host parents
had built a life starting with almost nothing, and were
fiercely (and justifiably) proud of everything they had ac-
complished. They were English speaking, as were most of
their fellow countrymen, so there was no language barrier
(English was one of the official languages). However,
cultural barriers did exist and had to be overcome. This
required an incredible amount of introspection, including
the basic evaluation of my own values.

School also provided a great opportunity for learning.
Taking classes with my new friends, and undergoing the
same hardships allowed me to partake of their comradery.
At the same time, our interaction produced many good
ideas, many of which stemmed from our different perspec-
tives.

In the end, I was very sorry to have to leave. In many
respects I believed that this country had many good things

13

to offer, and its people had many excellent qualities. The
fact that we had so much in common, yet had cultures that
were quite different, was quite fascinating. However, I
survived the separation, but I do intend to return someday.
I still keep in touch with my host family and friends, and
would like nothing better than to relive all of those experi-
ences, both negative and positive.

The country which I visited is the Republic of South
Africa. Though many people have criticized South Africa
for many things, one thing seems to always be forgotten.
There are many people there, people with many of the
same hopes and dreams that we have. In fact, there are
many non—superficial similarities which both of our coun-
tries share. And although many of there policies are clearly
wrong, we must never forget the effects that our criticisms
and sanctions will cause. Human nature is omnipresent,
and as often as not, pressure produces militance, particu-
larly when a group is in a precarious position, as the white
South Africans are. I do not condone them, nor do I
condemnthem. But I think it is important and significantthat
I have experienced them. Perhaps the situation could get
violent, but for everyone's sake, we must hope that it does
not. There is some good in everyone, and we must hope
that it will eventually prevail.

International travel is something everyone should
experience. Bythis I referto travel in a non-tourist situation.
Two summers ago, I travelled to and studied in the Federal
Republic of Germany. Not only did I finally attain reason-
able fluency in German, but I gained additional perspec-
tives, on both our country and the rest of the world. It is
always important to examine new ideas, and I often find the
homogeneity of ideas in the United States somewhat
stifling - notthat the situation is any different anywhere else,
but that at least the ideas are new. It is in this exchange of
ideas that democracy thrives; without it, we make our own
tyranny.

1. Every day, a commuter's mother meets him at the
bus stop and drives him home. One day, his last class is
canceled, and he arrives at the bus stop an hour early and
begins to walk home along the road his mom always takes.
She meets him along the way and takes him the rest of the
way home. if he had waited at the station, she would have
picked him up exactly on time. As it turned out, he reached
his home twenty minutes early. How long did the commuter
walk?

2. An engineering student was walking along his way
when he came to a narrow railroad bridge. He had crossed
three eights of the bridge when he heard the whistle of an
approaching train behind him. He instantly evaluated his
alternatives. If he were to run back to the beginning of the
bridge at his speed of 10 mph, he and the train would meet
exactly at the beginning of the bridge. If he would keep on
running, the train would catch him just as the bridge ended.
At what speed was the train moving?

3. A girl is twice as old as her brother was when the
girl was as old as the boy is. The sum of their ages equals
49 years. How old is the girl, and how old is her brother?

4. A girl has a pocketful of change, but she is unable
to give someone change for a dollar, half dollar, quarter,
dime, or nickel. What isthe largest sum of money (in United
States coins, no silver dollars, please) thatthe girl can have
in her pocket?

5. A newlywed couple goes into a hardware store to
buy something fortheir new house. The wife asksthe clerk
the price, and the clerk replies, "The price of two is twelve
cents, the price of sixteen is twenty-four cents, and the
price of a hundred twenty-nine is thirty-six cents.” What
does the couple want to buy?

6. A census taker asks a housewife how many people
live in her house and what their ages are. The woman tells

14

him that her three sons live in the house, that the product
of their ages is thirty-six, and that the sum of their ages is
the number of the house across the street. The census
taker goes across the street and looks at the number of the
house. When he returns, he tells the housewife that she
has not given him enough lnforrnation. The woman then
responds, “My oldest son is sleeping upstairs." The census
taker now figures out the ages of the boys. What are they,
and how does he know?

Being Aware

When was the last time you thought about the
environment? Ayearago? Yesterday? Never? Well, ifyou
have thought about it recently, then did you think about the
way you can affect it ? In good ways and in bad ways?
Yes? No? Maybe?

So many questions! You're probably thinking, “I
have enough trouble thinking about my own problems, let
alone thinking about the environment." Well, unfortu-
nately, this Is too true. Not much thought is given to the
environment throughout the day and we do not realize how
profoundly we do affect it. Car exhaust, litter, solid wastes,
sewage, and insecticides are a few of the many imposing
materials upon our environment. It is important for you, me,
and the world to be aware of these problems and be aware
of the potential solutions. For years we have been living
under an environmental “roof” in dire need of repair. And,
we are hoping someday, someone will fix it before it comes
crashing down upon us. A solution is not going to just
happen by. In the following text I will discuss one of the
many problems facing us today.

what You Can't See May Save You
Ozone Baby

As a young boy I didn't care too much for summer
rains. It was just an inconvenience to me and my busy
schedule of frolic and fun outside. impatiently I'd wait for it
to end. But, almost as soon as that last drop hit the ground
— I was out there — floating blades of grass down the
stream of water, rolling down my street. The rain seemed
to make things different. The air was always so fresh and
sweet smelling. Little did I know that what I was smelling
was ozone (O3) — a molecule of great importance.

Important to us up in the upper atmosphere, that is.
Ozone at ground levels doesn't do us two cents worth of
good. In fact it is potentially hazardous. You don't have to

15

worry about not being able to see it. It lingers around the
skyline of cities as a haze—better known as smog. This
type of ground ozone is usually produced by N02 or SO,
emissions from burning fossil fuels, as in equation 1.

Here, nitrogen dioxide(NO2), is broken apart by
ultra-violet radiation to form nitric oxide(NO) and an oxygen
atom(O). This oxygen atom then combines with the
oxygen molecules in the air, with the help of a catalyst(Z),
to form ozone(O3), as in equation 2.

At an approximate altitude of 15 miles(24.1 KM)
ozone is formed in a similar way. Oxygen molecules are
split by ultra-violet rays and ozone is, again, formed, as

NO, + Em) ---> NO + O (1)
O-I-O2-I-Z-->03-I-Z (2)
02 + EM,’ ---> O + O (3)

illustrated in equation 3(which continues in equation 2).

This layerof ozone, which if brought down to ground
temperature and pressure, would measure a mere 3 milli-
meters in thickness. Not much there to protect us from the
sun's damaging long-wave ultra-violet rays.

CFCs (Ozone’s Disease)

There is a substance, called
chlorofluorocarbon(CFC), which was created before the
1950's in order to have a safe coolant for refrigeration.
Previously ammonia(NH3) was the safest alternative.
CFCs, better known as Freon(A Trademark of the Du Pont
company), are now used in spray can propellants, refrig-
eration, air-conditioning, insulating foams and plastics, and
industrial solvents.

Unfortunately, CFC molecules are almost chemi-
cally inert. They rarely combine with other molecules and
they do not structurally go amiss. So, in essence, they are
free to float around the air unaffected. Eventually, by way
of air currents, they find themselves in the upper atmos-

phere among numerous ozone molecules. It is at this point
in their journey that causes scientists to worry , and
rightfully so. The CFC molecule contains chlorine atoms
which, when introduced to ozone, acts as a catalyst,
helping along the distruction of the O3 molecule (the re-
verse reaction of equation 2). One chlorine atom may con-
tribute to the destruction of 100,000 ozone molecules,
before it falls out of the upper atmosphere—and this is the
problem. The rate of destmction of ozone is greater than
the rate the layer can repair itself. Presently, scientists
have discovered a hole in the ozone two-thirds the size of
Antarctica, over Antarctica. They also believe another hole
has begun to form over the Arctic region.

I know what your thinking right now. You're sitting
there with your bottle of Perrier, unalarmed, thinking, “No
ozone! Nooo, problem. We can just wear sunglasses and
tanning lotions. It'll be like going to the beach all year longl”
Bitchin’, man — butwe’ll still be in majortrouble. See, there
are these tiny one celled plants that float near the surface
ofthe oceans and can't hide from the deadly rays. When
they die then , like a domino effect, the other organisms,
right on up the food chain, will die soon after. From one
celled plants to one celled animals, to crustaceans, to fish,
to dolphins, whales and people all will be irreversibly
affected.

What is Being Done

Fortunately there may be a glimmer of hope. In
September of1987, nations producing CFCs met in Mon-
treal, Canada, to try to draw-up a limitation agreement.
Some of the participating countries included: Britain, Italy,

United States, Soviet Union, France, and China. Thirty-
seven nations agreed to a schedule of CFC production
cutbacks. So, by 1989 production levels will be reduced to
1986's levels, and by 1999 levels will be half that amount.
Du Pont, independently, has promised to phase out pro-
duction by the year 2000. Until then, another environmen-
tally safe and people safe substitute must be formulated.

What You Can Do

You can do a lot as a consumer! The first thing you
can do is buy environmentally safe products. Pass by the
aerosol sprays and buy the products with pump dispensers
instead. Pass by the foam cups and plates and buy the
products made out of paper. By showing your support for
the companies who are doing right, the other companies
will be forced to change or discontinue the product. The
second, and most important, thing you can do is become
more informed. For more information write: The Environ-
mental Defense Fund, Dept. P, 257 Park Ave. South, New
York, NY 10010.

by Nadya Sustache

Have you ever wondered how enzymes catalyze the
biochemical processes that occur in your body? Or, how
the catalytic converter of a carworks? Be it in a human body
or in car, catalysts play an important role in the chemical
reactions occurring within them. Catalysts are very inter-
esting and somewhat mysterious substances. In fact,
many scientists compare the reactions where catalysts are
involved to "black boxes." The reasonforthis is the peculiar
way in which catalysts work in a reaction. This analogy
represents the uncertainty of knowing what happened to
the reactants during the reaction (hopefully we got the
expected products), but not knowing howthe reaction took
place (mechanism of the reaction). In order to understand
and sympathize with our friends in science, I will give a
rough definition of what a catalyst is.

Catalysts are those substances that change the speed
of a reaction without being consumed in it. In other words,
even though they interact with the reactants of the reaction,
they are not part of its products. They can be divided in two
categories. Homogeneous catalysts are those that are in
the same phase as the reactants and products while
heterogeneous catalysts are in a different phase than the
products and reactants. Many industrial processes require
the presence of a catalyst in order to work. For most of
these processes, heterogeneous catalysts are used in
which the reactants are in the gas or liquid phase at the
surface of a solid catalyst. Some examples of these
processes follow.

The work of catalysts in these sample processes is
best described by the laws of thermodynamics and kinet-
ics. Thermodynamics, on the one hand, predicts how far a
reaction can go (that is, the limits of a reaction). Kinetics,
however, predicts howfast it can proceed until it reaches its
limit. A we catalyst accelerates the rate of a reaction
without altering its equilibrium because it is not consumed
in it. For reactions that have large equilibrium constants
(thereby implying that the reaction proceeds to completion)

17

§:"-‘°.“€?_“‘i¥:¥W» .:~N&‘: ':':"&%’}7:~:«»ii:'s 

 

but that are normally slow, catalysts help in making the
reaction go faster. However, if the equilibrium constant is
very small and the reaction is slow there is not much the
catalyst can do to help.

There are several ways in which the rate of a reaction
can be altered. A change in the concentrations of the
reactants or in the temperature of the reaction are some
examples. In addition to these, it a reaction involves a solid
with a gas or a liquid, the surface area of the solid also
affects the reaction rate. For the reactions we are consid-
ering, the solid would be a heterogeneous catalyst. when
we add a solid catalyst, we provide the reaction with a
surface where the reactants are adsorbed and immobilized
next to each other. This increases the probability of
reacting with other molecules. So, by providing greater
surface area, we increase the rate at which the molecules
react with each other, and the reaction goes faster. For
catalysis to occur, reactions take place at specific locations
of the surface of the catalyst called "sites." In these sites,
the reactants have to fit momentarily onto the surface and
formacomplex. This complex is an intermediatethatfinally
decomposes into the final products.

The adsorption of the reactants into the surface can be
described by two different terms: physical adsorption and
chemisorption. In the first one, the molecules are attracted
to the surface by weak intermolecular forces while on the
later, they are attracted by stronger chemical bonding
forces. Chemisorption is of special consideration because
almost all of the reactions catalyzed by a solid involve the
chemisorption of one or more of the reactants.

Since many catalytic reactions occur at high tempera-
tures where significant physical adsorption is not likely to to
occur, we believe that chemisorption best describes what
is happening at the surface of the catalyst.

The most important effect of the formation of this tran-
sitory complex is the decrease of the activation of the
reaction. This change in activation energy will be respon-
sible for the change in the rate of the reaction as repre-
sented by the equation In k = lnZ - E./ RT where k is the
rate constant and Ea is the activation energy.

It is clear now how the increased surface area of a
reaction and the overcoming the activation energy barrier
affects the rate of the reaction. However, catalysts can be
useful in two other different ways: through their activity or
selectivity or both. The selectivity of a catalyst usually
varies with the conditions of pressure, temperature, etc.
underwhich the reaction occurs along with the nature of the
catalyst itself. Selectivity is measured through the percent-
age of the consumed reactant that forms the desired
product. For example, forthe following reaction we obtain
different products according to the nature of the catalyst
used.

C2H5OH  CH3CHO + H2 (Copper catalyst)

C_,_H50H ---- --> C2H4+ H20 (Al2O3 catalyst)
The activity of the catalyst refers to the rate at which it

causes the reaction to proceed to equilibrium and therefore
is dependent on the temperature of the reaction.

IABLE 1 ;
Reaction Catalyst

N2+3H2 <==>2NH3 Fe with K20 and A1203

All of these different properties of catalysts help define
different aspects of catalytic research:

a) Reaction mechanism and reaction kinetics describ-
ing how the reaction takes place.

b) Surface chemistry describing theinteractions of the
adsorbed molecules between each other and with the
surface.

Each of these approaches to the study of catalysts is
directed towards a better understanding of the catalysts
themselves and how they change the mechanisms of the
reaction. However, until we are fully able to "see" what is
happening inside our "black box", we will have to regard
catalysis as a somewhat mysterious process and describe
it through the use of different and interesting theories.

What strategy has enabled Marcus and Lego to implement
this “magnificent revolution”? Some of their policies are:
- Eliminating businesses that don't meet their standards.
Likely candidates include: Longines-Witthauer Watch Co.,
and the office furniture division. The elevator division,
which is recovering from years of poor management was
sold in July to Schindler Holding AG of Switzerland. Al-
though its performance has improved, price cutting is wide-
spread in this market, and it would have been difficult for
this business to further improve its profits. According to
Marcus, if a business doesn't show profitability, “We'll get
out of the business, no matter what it is."3 “Westinghouse
is very good at making elevators, but we're only good
domestically. We're not global. Unless we go glabal, then
sooner or later downstream we're going to get killed.”‘This
“going global" includes joint ventures to expand markets:
Westinghouse's O'Hara-based factory automation unit,
having suffered setbacks inthe mid-1980's, is being moved
into a joint venture with a European firm.

- Paying closer attention to the customer. And it's working,
according to Jack Ferguson, president of West Virginia
Power, "Westinghouse has learned the value of the cus-
tomer, and they are playing the game better than anybody
else.”’°'

- Improving productivity. Productivity has increased about
6 percent a yearfor 5 years. This has freed about 4 million
square feet of manufacturing space, yet still enabled the
company to increase volume output. In 1982, the net
income per employee rated $3,100. in 1987, net income
per employee is estimated to be $6,600.

- According to a Drexel Burnham Investment abstract, the
Marous-Lego mangement team is aggressively seeking to
sell its slower-growth businesses when good prices are
offered. This policy is based in part on Westinghouse's
experience that not all of the businesses aquired along its
conglomerate route are suited for growth in its structure,
and the companies resources may be more successfully
applied elsewhere. Recently sold businesses include fac-
tory automation and the transportation business.

- Paying close attention to quality.

— Building business via small aquisitions, and by nuturing
promising technology. In January, 1987 Westinghouse
aquired the naval torpedo business of Gould's Inc. for about
$100 million. In October, the company purchased Chal-
lenger Electrical Equipment Corp. for about $300 million. In
February, Westinghouse and a subsidiary of Daimler Banz
Of West Germany (a giant firm that makes transport equip-
ment) agreed to combine their transportation businesses.
Formerly, Westinghouse's people mover business domi-
nated the U.S market, but had difficulty winning overseas
contracts. Although Westinghouse relinquished controlling
interest in this venture, the merger is expected to give

19

access to foreign markets for people movers, and the
money to invest in new technology, such as magnetic
levitation. In March, Wesinghouse and Siemens agreed to
share markets in factory automation, to increase volume
and spread strategic costs; and to market industrial circuit
breakers through Siemens, in order to put the product in
both the United States and Euopean markets. In April,
Westinghouse engaged in a joint venture with ABB (Asea
Brown Boveri) to form two companies that combinetheir
steam turbine businesses and their power generation,
transmission, and distribution (transformer, relay, and
switch) businesses. Westinghouse sold 45 percent of that
operation, and will thus keep controlling interest. Accord-
ing to Marcus, only one U.S. order for a large electrical
generator was placed in the past four years. Westinghouse
got this lone domestic order, but has found world markets
elusive in this area. These joint ventures will allow Westing-
house to expand from a weak domestic market in these
areas into world markets.
- Working to build a “New Westinghouse", able to effectively
compete against foreign competitors on a global basis.
- Delivering consistent, above average earnings to share-
holders; that is, “shareholder value enhancement".
- Restmcturing, so that company earnings are not so
dependentonthe overall health of the economy. Currently,
investors feel that the assets of Westinghouse are too
economically sensitive, so that Westinghouse shares are
probablytrading at a lower value than its current assets and
profits would predict. Among the less economically sensi-
tive businesses under the Westinghouse logo: nuclear
energy and defense.

- Exhibiting caution with regard to bidding aggressively on
large deals. Westinghouse has learned from experience.
In 1983 bought Unimation lnc., at the time number one in
its market, for $107 million. As soon as the sale was
complete, the market rapidly declined; furthermore, in the
reduced market showed a preference for electric products,
as opposed to the hydraulic products made by Unimation.
Marous will not take a chance on a large aquisition in an
unfamiliar area: according to Marcus, “We're going to stay
in related businesses."

latestimhouselodax

In short, the 102 year-old company, headquartered in
Pittsburgh, employs 110,000 persons and grossed
$10.679 billion in sales in 1987. Based on sales, Wesing-
house ranked 33rd on the Fortune 500 this year. Westing-
house remains a major supplier to the electric utility indus-
try. The U.S. government is the company's single largest
customer, and a substantial fraction of sales for the com-
pany are generated from defense contracts for radar mis-
sile launching systems and other military hardware
Westinghouse emerged from 1988 with excess cash to-
talling $400 million: this should give Westinghouse the

flexibility to successfully transformthe company creatively,
yet aggressively. Understanding plans for this transforma-
tion requires a look at just what Westinghouse is. Structur-
ally, the firms operations are grouped into seven major
divisions:

Broadcast operations

Financial operations, consisting mostly of
Westinghouse Credit Corp.

Industrial Group

Commercial Group

Electronics Group, the nation’s second largest
electrical parts distributor

Energy Group, largely utilities and nuclear opera-
tions

Since 1983, Westinghouse has focused on divest-
ing in businesses where Westinghouse was unable to to
compete and meet aggressive profit goals, including: air
conditioners, small- and medium-sized motors, large cir-
cuit breakers and light bulbs, and most recently, the eleva-
tor business. Other “marginal" businesses faced internal
changes, aquisitions, or joint ventures in attempts to up-
grade them, including: factory automation, transportation,
transformers, and steam turbines. Selling traditional busi-
nesses hasn't been easy. Westinghouse had a 45 year
history in elevators, and a 100—year history in power circuit
breakers. However, the company is committed to building
on its strengths, and positioning such businesses in which
it cannot compete to survive in the global marketplace;
Marous comments: “Fundamentally, what we are saying is
we want to build on our strengths!" What does Marous
want to acheive from its restructuring to build on its
strengths? “We want sales to grow 8.5 a year. We want
operating profit at 10 percent. We want double-digit (in-
creases in) earnings per share. And we want a return on
equity of 18 to 20 percent."°“We are looking for enhancing
aquisitions in the $300 million to $800 million range." One
of these strengths Westinghouse is to build on is environ-
mental systems. According to Marcus, Westinghouse has
a unique strength in handling hazardous and toxic wastes.
Analysts see these markets as potential winners in the
coming years. Furthermore, the company has the technol-
ogy to take garbage and generate energy. Marous would
also like to expand the non-defense area of the commercial
electronics business. Currently, the company has a billion-
dollar backlog in orders for plants which use garbage as
fuel to make electricity. Westinghouse expects its toxic
waste business to grow by 30 to 35 percent each year.
Because of economic problems and potential legal liabili-
ties, the company is pursuing opportunities in this business
cautiously, rejecting 19 out of 20 proposed projects.

Westing house officials cite the lack of demand for
electrical generators as the main reason forclosing its East
Pittsburgh plant. In the past, the company has worked on
giant power plant projects; however, the trend today is

20

toward co—generation in which a factory generates part of
its own electrical supply, and is permitted to sell the excess
to utilities. What demand there is between now and 1992
is for comparatively small generators. The company plans
to sell the plant to the Regional Development Corp.The
metamorphosis required of Westinghouse to survive under
the conditions imposed by a global ecobomy has involved
transition and sometimes upheaval for local employees;
however, an analysis by Marcus of the extent and nature
of these changes indicates that Westinghouse remains
committed to the_employees of this area: “Five years ago,
the company employed 22,000 people in this area. This
year, the company employs 21,500 persons."‘° According
to Marcus, the quality of those jobs is higher, with higher-
paying professional positions replacing blue—collar plant
jobs.

Westinghouse is one of only 22 companies to
appear in both the 191 7 and the 1987 Forbes list of the 100
largest U.S. corporations. its return on equity was 22.9% in
1987. G.E.’s was 18.5%. Although profits have risen from
$605 million to $738 million in the past three years,
Westinghouse’s stock price is only nine times its earnings
per share. The average P/E for the Standard and Poor’s
500 is around 15. According to Marcus, “They're not giving
us credit for what we've done.”“ And they have done a lot.
From 1985-1987, as the company bought back stock,
primary earnings per share increased 45% to $5.12. About
$7 billion of the 1987 sales came from its Group W broad-
casting unit, Westinghouse Credit Corp. unit, Thermo King
transport refridgeration division, Electronic Systems, nu-
clear fuel sales, planned community developments, and
Westinghouse Electrical Supply Co. In addition Westing-
house Credit Corp. is a leading corporate lender; Phar-Mor,
a drug and variety store chain, will use financing from
Westinghouse Credit for nationwide expansion. Income
after taxes forthe financial service subsidiary has grown at
a compounded annual rate of twenty percent for the past
ten years. The subsidiary earned 16% of the net income for
the corporation in 1987. Westinghouse management has
focused exclusively on the U.S. business finance market.
Principal activities are lending to businesses for expansion
and other capital needs, lending to commercial and resi-
dential real estate developers, and leasing capital equip-
ment, such as power generation facilities. Management
has increased its emphasis on businesses with higher
earnings growth potential, divesting high overhead, narrow
profit-margin businesses.

Westinghouse expects the nuclear power plant
business to recover from a decade of decline in the early
1990's. Orders for nuclear power plants, for which
Westinghouse was the leader, dried up in 1978. The 1979
accident atThree Mile Island and tremendous cost over-
runs have held back the industry. Concerns over acid rain
and the “greenhouse effect” should make nuclear power a
more attractive alternative to coal burning plants. Under

design are smaller plants that generate less power and
should cause fewer regulatory problems. The new plants
are expected to require an evacuation plan about one third
the size of current plants. Construction times have typically
been stretched out dueto red tape. lttakes aboutfive years
to build a nuclear power plant in Korea, but about thirteen
years to build the plant in the United States. Another
business expected to expand is the advanced materials
business, headquartered in Pittsburgh, which provides
materials for the computer and electronics industries.
Westinghouse has targeted advanced materials to double

nuclear weapons production system. The contracts are
long term, although profit-limiting, and keep the
corporation's engineers and scientists on the technological
edge. Westinghouse should be ideally positioned for the
decommissioning and cleanup process when most of the
more than 100 commercial nuclear power reactors reach
retirement age at the turn of the century. Westinghouse

The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center was established in 1986 as a joint effort of Carnegie-Mellon University,
the University of Pittsburgh, and Westinghouse. The fifth such center, it was founded bythe National Science Foundation
for the primary purpose of providing state-of-the-art computing resources to the national scientific and engineering
communities. The previous NSF centers are located at Princeton University, the University of Illinois, the University of
California at San Diego, and at Cornell University.

The PSC presently operates an extremely high speed Cray X-MP/48 supercomputer and is planning to replace
that shortly with the Cray Y-MP/832, three times as powerful, withfourtimes the memory. Part ofthis increase in proceesing
capability is due to an increase in the number of parallel processors from four in the Cray X-MP to eight in the Cray Y-M P.
Parallelism allows a system to simultaneously run different programs and to exploit a programming technique called
multitasking that permits simultaneous execution of different parts of the same program. Fast cycle times, parallel
overlapped vector operations, and multiple processors allow the Crays to achieve speeds up to several hundred million
floating point operations per second; these machines are among the most powerful scientific computers in the world. The
Cray 3, presently under development and planned for installation atthe PSC in 1990, is expected to achieve sixteen billion
operations per second. The Cray 3 utilizes gallium arsenide technology and its dense circuitry is immersed in liquid
flourocarbon to dissipate heat.

Supercomputers allow researchers to disregard normal constraints and attack complex problems which might
defy solution on slower machines. Currently at Pitt, they are being used to further advances in such areas such as
biomedical research; this includes modeling membrane function and three dimensional protein structure, and analyzing
three dimensional images from NMR, CAT or PET scans.

Westinghouse has abandoned most mass mar-
kets (such as appliances) and fast-growing markets in
favorof building businesses through local monopolies. The
sectors the company now favors shield the company from
competition through the complexities of the product, long-
term relationships with the consumers, and other factors.
This strategy yeilds more dependable profits, although
growth potential may be limited. Westinghouse's Balti-
more-based defense business supplies radarforthe B-1 B
bomber and the F-16 fighter. Westinghouse picks its
undersea warfare (sonar and torpedoes) and electro-opti-
cal technology for surreptitiously identifying targets. Ma-
rous predicts that hazardous, municipal, and nuclearwaste
will be about a $1.5 billion business in about two years.
Through a joint-licensing venture, Westinghouse has an
incinerator licensed to burn PCBs. Westinghouse is the
leading facilities operator for the Department of Energy's

This successful division includes the first commercial radio
broadcast station, KDKA. Other radio “firsts" for Westing-
house include: regular radio newscasts, live concerts,
play-by-play of a World Series, FM stereo bradcast of
professional football and AM stereo. Group W radio
stations continue to be innovators and leaders in the field.
Group W today consists of 16 stations serving 13 markets
from coast to coast. Among the 10,000 radio stations in the
U.S., Westinghouse’s WINS in New York has the largest
listening audience.

Group W Television Stations Group, founded in
1948, has also pioneered the business. Group W TV
stations were the first to offer 24-hour programming, hour-
long local newscasts, and regularly scheduled children’s
programs. Group W's Television Station Group was
founded in 1948. Group W's success is based on the

principles of quality programming, aggressive localism,
and public service. A recent campaign, “For Kids” Sake”,
which focuses on important issues for children, is the most
successful TV public service project in history. Group W
earned the Peabody award for outstanding programming in
public affairs for its national educational campaign, “AIDS
Lifeline." ‘Time to Care,” scheduled to begin early next
year, will focus on community action and how it can help
families, neighborhoods, and society. Group W Television
includes a video wire service, serving U.S., Canadian,
European, and Australian television stations with ongoing
live news reports. Group W Productions was established
in 1960 to provide quality programming for the program-
ming and syndication businesses. Hour Magazine, one of
the longest-running and most successful daytime pro-
grams, is one example of the programming that has made
Group W Productions a leader in the broadcast industry.
Among other divisions is Group W Satellite Communica-
tions (GWSC), founded in 1981, which is the largest dis-
tributor, via satellite, of video programming in the U.S.
Westinghouse’s philosophy on its broadcasting
can be summarized: “Since that first radio broadcast 68
years ago, (Westinghouse Broadcasting) has continued to
take stands on issues of importance to American life, rec-
ognizing that social responsibility is the key to its commit-
ment to the communities and the nation it serves.“

Now tell us John Marous, have we given Westinghouse

the credit it deserves?
