EDITORIAL

 SKYSC‘RAPE.R ENGINEER has grown very
rapidly in size and reputation since the first issue
was published five years ago. It compares favorably
with all other magazines of its type in the country
as was indicated this past year when Pi Delta Epsilon,,
national honorary journalism fraternity, presented a
third place award to THE SKYSCRAPER ENGI-
NEER. Much of the success of THE SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER can be attributed to the support of Dr.
G. R. Fitterer, Dean of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines. In the same way that THE SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER has progressed, so have the Schools of
Engineering and Mines since Dr. Fitterer was ap-
pointed Dean in 1951. ‘

Engineering Hall is here because of his efforts
and hard work. But this is no-t the end of changes
to the engineering school. We can expect further
favorable changes and additions to our engineering
school in the immediate future.

If one were to look briefly into Dean Fitterer’s
past, he would be surprised to see how dynamic this
modest man has been. After receiving his B. S. in

-Chemical Engineering from Rose Polytechnic Insti-

tute in 1924, Dean Fitterer began workng as a metal-
lurgist. In 1927, after doing research work for the
U. 8. Bureau of Mines at Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology, he received his M.S. in Metallurgical Engi-
neering. Dean Fitterer was wth the U. 8. Bureau of
Mines from 1927 to 1933 where he worked his way
from junior Metallurgist to Associate Metallurgist and
head of the Metallurgy Department. He received his

-Ph. D. in Metallurgical Engineering from the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh in 1930.

After leaving the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1933,
he founded the Fitterer Pyrometer Company, Inc.

MAY). I956

which manufactured, distributed, and installed high

=temperature thermocouples. The Fitterer Pyrometer

is used to determine the temperature of molten steel.
Dean Fitterer has received national recognition for
his carbon-silicon carbide thermocouple. He sold his
company and came to the University of Pittspurgh as
head of the Metallurgical Engineering Department

' in 1938. He served in this capacity until 1951 when

he was appointed Dean of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines and Director of the Engineering Research
l)ivision.

Dean F itterer was a United States Delegate to the.
First Pan-American Metallurgical Conference held at
Bogata, Colombia in "1952. He has been supervisor of
several Government research projects_and has also
done so-me consulting throughout the world. Dean
Fitterer can express himself quite well and has passed
on some of his knowledge and experiences by writing
over 50 articles, government bulletins, reports, etc.

His outstanding work has been acknowledged
by -many honorary groups. Sigma Xi‘ (Science Honor-
ary), Sigma Tau'(Engineering Honorary), Sigma
Gamma Epsilon (Mines-Metallurgical Honorary), and
Omicron Delta Kappa are several of these groups
that have recognized him. THE SKYSCRAPER EN-
GINEER has certainly’ recognized and appreciated
his interest in the magazine.

The Editor would like to wish all of the gradu-
ating seniors of the Schools of Engineering and Mines
the best of luck. He also wishes to extend a very
grateful thanks to this year's staff and his best wishes
to next year's staff.

The Role of . . .

WIND TUNNELS in Aerodynamic Design

by Thomas J. Geist, Ch. E. ’55

In their early experiments with gliders at Kitty
Hawk, Wilbur and Orville Wright found that the ac-
cepted standards specifying the lifting ability of wings
were wrong. They simply could not get the lift that
theory predicted from their gliders. It was not until
the brothers built themselves 2'. small wind tunnel,
in which they could actually measure the air forces
acting on various wing shapes, that they succeeded in
building the first successful airplane.

Wind tunnels have been useful, first of all, in
discovering and developing certain fundamental prin-
ciples of aerodynamics, and in applying them to par-
ticular problems of design. Out of the tunnels have
come high speed propellors, low drag wings, flaps
which give high lift, cowls and ducts to promote the
efficient cooling of the engine, and other improve-
ments that are now standard aircraft components.
Compare the best service planes of 1930, with their
exposed engines and landing gear, conventional wings
and propellors, surfaces pimplcd with rivet heads,
and speeds less than 200 miles an hour, with the air-
craft designs of today, which carry a horsepower in
every five pounds of their gross weight and are able
to cross the continent in a third of a day. The differ-
ence isn't all luck. Granted that the engine research-
ers, structural engineers, fuel chemists, and other
specialists have had a big hand in creating the 700
mile-an-hour airship, the key man in the science of
flight is still the aerodynamicist with his roaring
wind tunnels.

A wind tunnel gets its results by a reversal of the
conditions of flight. The test object - airplane, part,
or scale model - is mounted securely on rigid stream-
lined supports. These supports are mounted on scales,

MAY, 1956

 

and when the airstream is turned on, the scales “weigh”
the responses of the object to the airflow. In this way
it is possible to determine the drag, lift, or interfer-
ence that a certain shape develops. It is possible to
measure aspects of stability and control, such as the
tendency to pitch or yaw. Practically every flying
characteristic can be studied by thus reversing the
natural process and making air the moving element.

America is remarkably equipped with wind tun-
nels. There are over eighty now in use, distributed
among twenty-seven engineering schools, the services,
and the government's agency for research, the Nation-
al Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

This agency was created in 1915, by act of Con-
‘ress, to su ervise and direct the scientific stud of

solution. In 1916 the committee began research. It
selected Langley Field, Virginia, as the seat for its

operations, and the Army authorities assigned a plot

for a laboratory. When this Laboratory opened in
1920, the principal item of equipment was a five-foot
wind tunnel. Tunnel No. 1 has long since been dis-
mantled to make room for more modern appratus,
but at the time it was built it seemed the last word
in aerodynamics research facilities.. It made many
contributions to aeronautics, but perhaps the con-
tribution was '-to point out the inadequacy of what
was then regarded as suitable equipment. Within two
years the Langley engineers had designed and were
building a new tunnel, which became the trailblazer
for more and better tunnels to come.

The "NACA realized it would be forced to ex-

pand, and soon began building laboratories at Mof-'

fett Field, California. Today the largest tunnel in the
world, an 80 foot model with winds up to 750 miles
an hour is being used at Moffett for tests on models
of guided missiles, jets, and rocket propelled aircraft.
This tunnel is designed to operate exclusively at
speeds about the velocity of sound. Its vast hurricane

is supplied by six forty-foot fans, each rotated by a ~

6000 hp. electric motor. The Moffett engineers are
also building a smaller model for rocket research with
four three-stage centrifugal compressors driven by

motors totalling 10,000 hp. and producing winds up '
' to l700 miles an hour. This is a low pressure tunnel

in which the conditions of very high altitude flight
can be closely simulated. Driers can reduce the inter-
nal humidity to as low as 1% of normal atmospheric
humidity.

In 1940, when construction of the Moffett labor-_
atory was just getting started, the NACA decided to.

established still another center of research. This labor-
atory, which occupies a large area adjoining the
Cleveland airport, is devoted to the study of aircraft
power plants, fuels, and lubrication.

The altitude tunnel at Cleveland provides coin-
pletely controlled facilities for the study of engine
performance at any altitude from sea level up to the
substratosphere. There is a refrigeration and cooling
plant to keep the temperature down to -48 degrees
Fahrenheit, a pumping plant to evacuate the tunnel

14

aid to a density equivalent to that of 50,000 feet, and
a fan which pushes the air around the huge cavern
at 500 miles an hour. These processes all go on while
an airplane engine, mounted in the '20-foot test sec-
tion, is adding its heat and fumes to ‘the tunnel air.
To operate the tunnel at full capacity requires 52,000
lip, of which only 18,000 drives the fan. The rest is
needed to drive the pumps and operate the refriger-
ation and cooling system. ’

Equally unique is the Cleveland laboratory's
icing research tunnel. It is prepared to study the
problem of icing wherever it shows up in engines

and engine parts, on prop blades, wings, antennae,

and other parts. Just as the altitude tunnel can sub-
ject an airplane to sub-stratospheric conditions. the
ice tunnel subjects it to the extreme weather condit-
ions which produce dangerous icing. The tunnel has
facilities for spraying water into the moving airstream
and at the same time lowering the temperature to as
much as 65 degrees below zero. The top wind speed
is 320 miles an hour, and the artificial blizzards of
sleet and snow which result from this combination
of wind, temperature, and humidity are a match for
nature’s worst weather. Ice is one of .aviation’s most
stubborn hazards, and this tunnel is dedicated to
solving this problem. Twenty-three of the wind tun-
nels are at Langley, and the story of the advancement
of the aeronautical sciences during the past twenty
years parallels pretty closley the story of what has
gone on there. The NACA group themselves have
never attempted to design an airplane. Their respon-
sibility is the investigation an.d development of the
fundamental phenomena. During this development
it was discovered that conclusion reached from studies
of models in Tunnel No. 1 could not be applied to
the full-sized airplane. The responses of a scale model

in "the five-foot tunnel were one thing, those of the

actual plane another, and there was no formula to
bring them into agreement.

The aerodynamic behavior of an object depends
on its size, the speed at which it (or the air) is mov-

ing, and the air viscosity. The multiple of these three

factors for a given airplane provides a scale index
known as the Reynolds number. The Reynolds of
the old Mustang, for example, is between the range
5,000,000 to 20,000,000; that of the Flying Fortress is
between 13,000,000 to 28,000,000. Although the For-
tress is slower, its greater size more than compensites
for the decrease in speed. The Reynolds number can
be increased by increasing its size, speed, or the (len-
sity of the air.

The primary purpose in building'a wind tunnel
is_to make the scale measurements of drag, lift, and
other factors approach those of actual f1ight—a con-

dition that can be obtained‘ either by increasing the

air pressure or the size of the object. The engineers
said they were after higher Reynolds numbers. But
the Reynolds number is not the only consideration.
The Mach number, a ratio of the speed of the plane
to the sped of sound, is a more fundamental expres-
sion of high-sped ratios than the number of miles
per hour, since the speed of sound varies with altitude.

High Mach numbers first showed up in aeron-
autics on the tips of propellers. Work in the propel-
ler research tunnel at Langley determined that speeds
of rotation higher than Mach .90 were both ineffic-
ient and dangerous. At the time these studies were

“3-D” IN PLANT LAYOUT ENGINEERING
by Fred A. Holler, I. E. ’ss

The fad of Three-Dimension may be fading out
in the motion picture industry, but it is only becom-
ing entrenched in other American industries. The
advantages of perspective seeing or three-dimension,
which presents a sense of form and depth, were known
to artists and scientists many years ago. However, it
was not until the start of the Second World War that
the plant layout engineer began to develop his ver-
sion of this perspective by introducing the Three-
Dimensional Model, which proved to be an effective
tool in his work.

Year after year, American industry spends mil-
lions of dollars in building new plants and altering
old ones. This has been an enormous task for the
planning engineers. A large part of this huge job is
done by the plant layout engineer, where time, accur-
acy, and cost are of utmost importance. When the en-
gineer plans a layout of the numerous machines,
equipment, and service facilities, every step has to be
performed accurately and in the most economical way.
This new tool, the three-dimensional model, has aided
tremendously in accomplishing this task for the en-
gineer.

Three-dimensional scale representations of equip-
ment and facilities were originally hand-carved out
of wood to a scale of 1/1 inch to 1 foot. These mini-
ature mode-ls were crude in design and expensive to
produce. A few years later, however, precision-scaled
models cast in metal or plastic were introduced. As
a result, this brought about greater accuracy and

_stronger eye-appeal, and it promptly gained favor

over the wooden model.

Cast metal or plastic Inodels of standard machin-
ery and equipment plus many makes of special ma-
chinery are available for use in plant layout engineer-
ing. All standard U. 8. machine "tools as well as aux-
iliary equipment, such as storage bins, pallets, desks,
tote boxes, chairs, conveyors, work benches, trucks,

FRED A. HOLLER

Fred A. Holler was g-raIdu-
 .ated from the University of
A Pittsburgh in June, 7955. A
‘A Korean veteran, Mr. Holler
spent 20 months in the army
in the Signal Corps. In his
senior year at Pitt, he was the
president of the student chap-
ter of the American Institute of
ndustrial Engineers. His ex-
periences include eighteen months with the Internati'on.aI
Harvester -"Company. Mr. Holler is married, and is a gradu-
ate of Allegheny ‘High School. He is now a Junior Engineer
with the Duquesne Lig-ht Company. .

male and female workers, and even drinking foun-
tains and telephones, are reproduced. Also, models
for special equipment, such as process plants, kilns,
vats, and ducts, are made from metal or solid plastic
lacquered in the proper colors.

The color scheme distinguishes between fixed
machines and movable equipment. Models are pro-
duced in finishes and colors similar to the actual item
represented. These color schemes even employ such
detail as multiple finishes. Machine tool model fin-
ishes follow the recommendations of the National
Machine Tool Builders Association. Machined sur-
faces are shown by aluminum paint. Control points
are shown by light buff paint, conforming to present
day practices for greater visibility and safety.

The models are durable and are not easily dam-
aged. They also have a lasting finish and sufficient
weight to stay in position when placed, or-they are
equipped with holes in the base for insertion of fast-
ening pins. Most models produced have indentifica-
tion markings —— name, number, size, description, and
other necessary items. They are shown in the m-ost
suitable place in an abbreviated form.

As the use of these miniature models widened,
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers intro-
duced a list of suggested standards to be used in pro-
ducing the models. These standards include such
items as scale, detail, finishes, allowances and clear-
ances, materials, construction, and identification.
This was accomplished so that the science of the
three-dimensional plant layout would not suffer the
experience of other fields, which developed rapidly,
uncoordinated, and unaided by standards, resulting
in detrimental effects to the profession.

The plant layout engineer's preliminary studies
include determining the quantity of raw material
needed to make the product; the number of machines,
equipment, and service facilities required; the proper

the location of machines and equipment.

 

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

workers, is for the Naussoeur Air Base in North Africa.

and most economical methods and procedures; and
the standard time for each piece and total product
time. He then turns to the three-dimensional model
layout to solve other complicated problems; namely,
process flow, efficient use of floor space, rearranging
processes, working clearances of all machines, con-
veyors, and overhead cranes, and finally selling his
layout to non-engineering executives. All of these
problems are benefited by just a look at a three-
dimensional model.

To facilitate the usage of the three-dimensional
models, a floor plan is used which consists of a sheet
of acrylic plastic hand engraved in 1/; inch squares
representing a scale of 1/1 inch to 1 foot. Using as
many plastic sheets as necessary to make up the re-
quired layout, the physical features of the‘ buildings,
such as‘columns, stairways, elevator shafts, partitions,
etc., are permanently cemented in place:.

Once the layo-ut has been decided, the models
are firmly fixed into position by double-faced adhe-
sive tape or an adhesive cement. The sections of the
plant layout are inverted one by one to rest on the
heads of the columns. A The bottoms of the models
thus show their positions on the flat undersurface of
the floor panels.

Tossecure blue prints from a three-dimensional
model layout for use in actual layout of a plant or
a department, a thin (0.0075 inch) transparent acetate
sheet, also ruled in 1/1 inch squares, is applied to the
undersurface. Templates (Repro-Templets) are ce-
mented in place on it, duplicating every feature in
the three-dimensional layout. An inventory of film
templates matches the solid models — each template
carrying a transparent lettered identification. When
completed, this film grid sheet is a photographic
negative on film ready for printing by standard re-
production processes, such as the blueprint, ozalid,
or photostat. Many reliable engineers in the plant
layout profession state that the blueprints made from
three-dimensional models can be printed and ready

for the actual layout within a few hours after layout
planning is completed. This is an advantage over the
old method of two-dimensional templates, which,
when blueprints, had to employ the services of the
drafting department at the expense of consumed V311
uable time and higher cost per layout.

Three-dimensional models also minimize errors
as plant and physical setups can be easily visualized
by all personnel and the effects of equipment location
on material flow can be studied in advance. A three-
dimensional layout also reduces the factors of any
planning project to physical fact. Each person can
participate in physical demonstration of ideas through
experiment on the layout. Even though many persons
may work together to prepare a plant layout, the
per cent of error is greatly reduced through the use of
a visual layout. The location of interior and exterior
permanent walls, including traffic openings, are clear-
ly detailed for material handling problems which
arise, and columns are shown to the height of the
working ceiling, thus showing proper clearances.

The ‘use of three-dimensional as a fundamental
tool for the plant layout engineer is here to stay. The
cost is but a fractional per cent of the savings effected
in layout, selection of factory equipment, and the
avoidance of error in construction. An actual case
history will illustrate these facts: '

Company A had many heavy presses of consider-
able height. In preparation for their new plant
the models clearly showed the inability of a gantry
crane to clear one press by 18 inches. Without
discovering this error beforehand, the cost of re-
locating the press would have been about $75,000;
the cost of the layout was less.than $5,000. Thus
a savings of $70,000 was accomplished by just
planning with three-dimensional models.

The application of 3-D should be firmly implant-
ed in the minds of all plant layout engineers in in-
dustry today.

Edward J. Stolic, class of ’48

speaks from experience when he says . . .

“With U. S. Steel, my future holds interest,
challenge and reward.”

From his graduation in 1948 with a
B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineer-
ing, until November of that year,
Edward Stolic worked as an operat-
ing trainee in the Irvin Works of
United States Steel. Following his
discharge from the Army in 1950,
he returned to work at U.S. Steel. In
just 18 months, Mr. Stolic reached a
management position as Engineer-
Lubrication.

By mid-year 1953, Mr. Stolic was
promoted to Foreman-Instrument
Repair and Sub-Station. In a recent
interview he said: “Opportunities
for rapid advancement are almost
limitless in U.S. Steel.” At 27, Mr.
Stolic is supervising a force of 30
men in mechanical and electrical
tests as well as instrument repair and
maintenance of gas generators, com-

pressors and water puriﬁcation units.
He feels that, “The engineer ﬁnds

_ many places to apply the knowledge

he garnered in school.” The men un-
der Edward Stolic are called on to
trouble shoot in any part of the mill.
This calls for a wide variety of tal-
ents and leads Mr. Stolic to say:
“The steel industry has expanded
greatly, and with it the need for good
men.”

If you are interested in a challeng-
ing and rewarding career with United
States Steel, and feel you are quali-
ﬁed, further information is available

(A message from IBM—w/were progress is engineered)

Wherever your degree leads you after graduation, you’ll see a
broad variety of IBM machines making unbelievably short work
of complex data processing chores . . . providing more complete
and more accurate information faster . . . inﬂuencing your work
and your life in countless ways. For example-

In your work, IBM equipment can solve,
in minutes, engineering problems that once demanded
long weeks, months, and even years!

The food you eat may be processed and
distributed more cheaply with the accounting controls
made possible by IBM equipment.

Better shelter and lower-cost fuels can come

your way aided by the many IBM data processing
and accounting machines in mining, steel
fabricating, and utility companies.

In health matters, too—-in medical research,
government health statistics and hospital administration
—IBM methods make important contributions.

You’ll travel better because IBM equipment is
speeding improvements in all forms of transportation.

You’ll get better buys, better service with
the widespread and growing use of IBM techniques
in manufacturing, distribution, retailing.

National defense, law and order, voting registra-
tion, paycheck preparation—even weather pre-
diction—are other areas in which IBM techniques
get things done better, faster. You’ll be seeing a
lot of IBM—working, living . . . wherever facts
and figures help you prosper.

IBM’s world leadership in data processing has been
achieved largely through creative-engineering. At
I BM ’s modern laboratories, creative freedom in a pro-
fessional atmosphere stimulates young engineers to
make important and rewarding contributions. If you

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Dean’s Page

Tlie demand for graduating engineers is now
at an all time peak. This spring some three hundred

companies, seeking up to fifty engineers each, have.

visited this campus to interview one hundred and
ninety graduating students.

Non—veterans were offered an average of $425
per month, whereas veterans were offered up to $480
per month. As an added incentive, some companies‘
will pay an additional twenty-five per cent for over-
time services. Thus it is possible for a veteran to earn
up to $600 a month.

The New York Times recently determined from
their Want Ads that the current shortage of engineers
had reached a minimum of thirty thousand.

This demand is not a temporary or imaginary
situation. Instead it is based on a newly conceived
and real appreciation of the role of the engineer in
industry. This country is on the brink of one of the

most fabulous eras in its technological history. This;
has been described by some as the second industrial

revolution, the age of automation, etc., but it is far
more than these. It will be the age of the integration
of the science wherein each specialized branch of en-
gineering and science will contribute partially to the
development of entirely new concepts. Those indi-
viduals who are privileged to have had a glimpse of
the future are able to visualize almost unbelievable
developments which are just out of reach at present,
m.erely because of the lack of engineering and scien-
tific manpower.

Although the demand is well known, the supply
of engineers is another matter. The 1956 graduating
class will number approximately twenty thousand.
About one-third of .these will be commissioned through.
the ROTC upon graduation and will not be available
to industry for several years. Fortunately for them,
the Army is making a real effort to honor the engi-
neering specialties. The civil graduate is usually
placed in the Engineers’ Corps, the electrical in the
Signal (Jorps, the metallurgist in Ordnance, etc.

The remaining two-thirds of the graduates may
be hired by the companies but with the undersanding
that they will probably be drafted before they are
txwcn-ty-six years old.

The graduates who were drafted and are return-

ing from the Armed Services constitute another source
of technically trained manpower. However, many of
these veterans erroneously conclude that they have

lost contact with their respective field of engineering.

and are more interested in sales or other non-technical
positons.

All of these factors contribute to a long term
continued shortage of engineers and the impact on
industry is becoming obvious. Many companies which

have had a. long established and continued need for

engineers have been placed in a position of competing
for graduates against new companies with only gov-

erment contracts but which are nevertheless offering.

many incentives in addition to the highest salaries.
Some of these new companies will have highly suc-
cessful futures and their offers should be seriously
considered. Others are completley unstable and their
offers should not be considered.

Since the beginning of World War II, the top

executives of some of the better small companies have"

continued to carry the administrative load. They
have been unable and in some instances unwilling to
hire and train young engineers to take over the helm
upon their retirement. Many of these companies are

now,'almost hysterically, trying to fill the gap with.

young inexperienced engineers only to find that it
is too late. The results is often a merger-with a larger
company which has been able to maintain some con-
tinuity in its administrative and engineering pattern.

Because of all these factors, there are many chal-
lenging high level positions open for the young en-
gineer but some word of caution is in order. With
such an exciting future, the young engineer should
be careful to accept the offer which presents the most
intellectual challenge and the best future. He should

inquire into the administrative structure of the com-

pany and know the location of the position being

offered with respect to that structure. He should

ask where he might expect to be within five or ten
years following his return from the service. Geo-
graphic location and salary are not too important,

although these are the two factors which all too often

mislead many engineers into positions of mediocrity.
The young engineer should accept the challenge with
courage and enthusiasm. The future is exciting.

At Ramo-Wooldridge today there exists a wide range
of projects intended to aid aircraft in navigating to the
vicinity of targets, finding the targets, destroying them,
and returning safely to base. Work is under way in such
ﬁelds as infrared and microwave detection, information
display, communication and navigation, and analog and
digital computing. Some projects are in the laboratory
development stage, some in the flight test stage, some

in pilot production.

Good progress is being made in the establishment of
facilitiesand operational patterns that are well tailored
to the unique requirements of advanced electronic

Today’s powerful turbo-jet and turbo-prop engines
ar_e a far cry from the aircraft engines of a mere 10
years ago. »

But we’ve hardly scratched the surface. We’re still
pioneering. A

Sure, the sound barrier’s been cracked. But, who
knows, perhaps in the next 10 years we’ll be ﬂying at
speeds 2 or 3 times the speed of sound. Newer, more
complex, more powerful engines ARE in the offing.
There’ll be ‘new ﬁelds to conquer. For instance, the
thermal barrier!

Allison, a pioneer in the design, development and
production of aircraft engines, now is working on
advanced design turbine engines to meet future re-
quirements . . . whatever they might be. Proven fea-
tures of engines like the Allison J71 and T56 may be
adapted to the engines of tomorrow. Allison engines
of the future will be backed up with worlds of ex-
perience gained in the development and production
of its ﬁrst 100,000 aircraft engines.

24

Now, Allison is in the midst of a $75 million ex-
pansion program in engineering research and de-
velopment facilities. Completion of the program will
give Allison one of the world’s most complete, best-
equipped, centers for the development of new, high
performance turbo-prop and turbo—jet aircraft en-..
gines. This opens new and unlimited opportunities
for young graduate engineers, for the program-
ﬁnanced by General Motors-—creates an immediate
need for a 40% increase in engineers.

'I'RANING
PROGRAM

When the application of Paul G. Thomas, EE ’57,
was accepted by the International Association for
the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience
(IAESTE) at their meeting in Trondheim, Norway, in
mid-January, 1956, the University of Pittsburgh Schools
of Engineering and Mines became a part of an inter-
national program to provide on-the-job technical train-
ing for student engineers in countries other than their own.

Early in December, 1955, the Engineering and Mines
Cabinet appointed a committee to investigate the pos-
sibilities of participation in the program sponsored by
IAESTE. Following the report of the committee the E
and M Cabinet passed a motion guaranteeing $500 for
the use by an outstanding candidate from the University
of Pittsburgh. At the same time Cabinet appointed an
awards committee and recommended that the commit-

tee investigate the possibilities of securing funds for Pitt

students applying for participation in the program.
Thomas’ approval by the international IAESTE com-
mittee was instrumental in gaining for him the support
of the P:itt’s~ Engineering and Mines Association.

The awards’ committee, with Dean G. R. Fitterer as
chairman, not only named Thomas as the ﬁrst awardee,
but set up the Engineering and Mines International
Travel and Training program, to be known as EMITT,
for the purpose of providing travel and study opportu-
nities for engineers. The committee based their plans on
the program of IAESTE, already in operation. From
Mr. Arthur C. Nagle of the Institute of International
Education, a group which serves as the administrative
agency for the United States IAESTE, the committee
received the following information.

Mr. Nagle, in a statement concerning the program,

said, “It is hardly necessary to stress the beneﬁts derived

25

 

by a student who trains abroad and thus acquires not
only technical but rich human experience through an op-
portunity which is not likely to present itself more than
once in a lifetime.” Mr. Nagle feels that by receiving
foreign students and sending its own abroad, the United
States has much to offer and much to gain.

“In 1948,” said Mr. Nagle, “universities and indus-
tries of nine countries of western Europe joined together
to establish the organizational framework for a unique
and outstanding international arrangement to provide
on-the-job technical training for upper undergraduate stu-
dents of science and technology in countries other than
their own. This non-proﬁt, non-governmental organiza-

tion was called the International Association for the Ex-

26

change of Students for Technical Experience and head-
quarters were established in London. That IAESTE
would promote international understanding and good-
will was accepted as a general thesis. However, its crea-
tion was prompted by the consensus of industrial and
academic circles that, in addition to the theoretical
and technical preparation in one’s own country, the
preparation for an undergraduate for industry is en-
hanced appreciably by an opportunity for him to develop
critical faculties in observing abroad new technical and
intellectual methods. By 1955, the number of participat-
ing countries has risen to twenty-one, including the
United States. _

“In the course of the past summer, a total of 5,130

of. engineers. and its continuing efforts to improve train‘-
ing methods for its engijneeringstudents, United States
participation has beenlabnormally small. In 1955, it has
received only 39 foreign stu_dent-trainees and sent abroad
only 20. .. . '1. 1- - A _

“With the full support of the American‘ Society for

Engineering Education. and the Engineers’ Council for

_ Professional Development, the Institute" of International

Education has gladly agreed to make.‘ use of its facilities
and wide experience’ in theﬁeld of international student
exchange for the purpose ‘of administering _the IAESTE
effort in the United States and attempting to raise the
participation of this country to -proportions commensu-
rate with its potential. A _ .
“Under the IAESTE program, students are sent
abroad for technical training during their “summer vaca-
tions for a minimum period of eight weeks. They may
indicate their choice of any IAESTE member country
where they will train as ‘well as their particular ﬁeld of
interest. In order to qualify for training abroad under
the program, a ‘student must fulﬁll the following con-
ditions: he must have completed his third year of en-
gineering study, be willing and able to pay for his own
transportation to and from the country where-he will
be training, have had practical technical experience in
his own country, be endorsed by ofﬁcials of his school
and pay a $5.00 registration fee which will be returned
to him in the event his placement abroad is not possible.
The receiving company will pay the trainee a weekly
wage, sufficient to cover his maintenance while actually
employed. 1 _ _

“Each member country is responsible for its own
economy. To meet the Cost of administration for this
two-way exchange, each receiving industry is asked to
contribute a $50.00 fee for each trainee accepted. As is
mentioned above, the prospective trainee himself pays a
$5.00 fee upon applying for placement. The Institute of
International Education will assume responsibility for
the administrative arrangements which include visas, in-
ternational travel and related formalities. Life, accident
and medical insurance is compulsory and, if the par-
ticipant wishes, can be secured at nominal cost through

the Institute of International Education.”

HOW.THE IAESTE PROGRAM WORKS

IAESTE has provided the following detailed in-
formation about the operation of its program and
the responsibilities of the students and companies
involved.

NOMINATIONS

College authorities nominate a student for each job provided and the student subscribes $5
towards the national organization of the exchange upon applying. Should a student withdraw
after nomination his subscription is forfeited. If the foreign ﬁrm refuses your nomination, which
is most unlikely, your subscription is returned to you. Students must make themselves thoroughly
acquainted with the details of the oﬁer they accept.

TRAVEL

The Association accepts no responsibility for the arrangements for the journey ‘and students
pay their own fare to the place of work. Do not await the arrival of the instruction sheet before
making your preliminary arrangements. If a suﬁicient number of American students are interested,
group travel arrangements will be made by the Institute of International Education.

INSURANCE

All students going abroad under IAESTE must insure themselves against accidents, illness,
and death resulting from illness or accident, etc. Such insurance is available for a nominal fee at
the Institute of International Education.

INTRODUCTION CARDS AND INSTRUCTION SHEETS

When a foreign ﬁrm has informed the IAESTE committee abroad that your nomination is
acceptable, that committee then prepares the acceptance note and instruction sheet, etc. and
through this oﬂice tell you that you have been accepted. The instruction sheet is compiled to supply
you with information on a variety of subjects; but is concerned mainly with information to whom
to report on arrival and your lodgings. At the time when instruction sheets are prepared, it is
sometimes diﬂﬁcult to give the exact address of lodgings. Many ﬁrms make these arrangements
late for fear a student cancels or alters his date of arrival. You may, therefore, be told on your
instruction sheet to write direct to the ﬁrm and it is at this stage that we suggest you write direct
for the first time. Every effort is made to ensure the instruction sheet reaches you in good time.
If your instruction sheet has not reached you by 3 weeks before the commencing date you should
communicate direct with the Company to which you have been nominated. Do not expect the in-
struction sheet to give you infor.mation which is readily available at banks, travel agents or in
public libraries. _ '

PAY

The Association asks its industrial supporters to pay the student sufﬁcient to cover his cost
of living. It must be clearly understood that since we depend for our existence on the goodwill
of industry, we cannot in any way dictate to them what we consider to be the correct interpretation
of “cost of living.” The most we can, and do ask for is that you will receive sufficient to pay for
your board and lodgings. Most ﬁrms, of course, are much more generous than this; but you must
not expect to save enough from your pay to cover your traveling expenses for your journey and any

, visits you wish to make abroad. You are advised to take some money with you.

ARRIVAL AND COMMENCING DATES

Endless trouble and friction between industry and the Association has been caused in the past
by students altering these dates on the ﬂimsiest of pretexts—sometimes no reason being offeredat
all. Students are asked to appreciate that once they have accepted an offer, they have given an
undertaking to fulﬁll the conditions of that offer to the best of their ability. Should any alteration
be absolutely necessary, then the student must inform the U. S. IAESTE Committee.

It should be realized that some organizations accept more than one student and in order to
deal with groups of students they must be able to plan a course or to arrange for staff to look after
them. Any student who arrives at a time other than that agreed upon or who alters his date of
arrival at short notice has to be given special attention.

If, for any reason, you cannot go abroad at all you must inform the U. S. IAESTE Committee
at once. By not doing so you——

a) deprive another student of the opportunity

b) may incur ﬁnancial liabilities due to room reservations in the event they
have been made for you. '

c) cause great inconvenience to the committee in the country
which offered to receive you.

Moreover it is diﬁicult sometimes to persuade a ﬁrm to continue its support to the Association,.
when in the previous year, its offer has been accepted and later refused by a student.

How hard can the sea bite? This is no
secret to Inco Corrosion Engineers.
For over thirty years, they have been
collecting‘ data on the corrosive and
erosive effects of sea water on many

* different kinds of metal.

In lnco’s “Ocean Test Tube” and asso-
ciated laboratories, Inco Corrosion
Engineers have the facilities and
apparatus to study all phases of
marine and atmospheric corrosion.

Ocean l.aborafory—here at its big Kure Beach, N. C., Testing Station, Inco exposes
thousands of metal specimens to the corrosive effects of salt spray, salt air,

salt Water.

How International Nickel finds out
what the wild waves are saying

The secI’s a killer of many metals.

Some it corrodes or rusts. Some it
wears away. Some it destroys by eat-
ing up one of the alloying elements.
Some it makes so “allergic” to con-
necting metals that corrosion is
speeded up.

To hunt this killer down, Inter-
national Nickel has made the ocean
into a test tube. At Harbor Island and
Kure Beach, North Carolina. Here,
Inco Corrosion Engineers study the
corrosive effects of salt water, salt
spray, salt air, water velocity, marine
growths, coupling methods.

First all-jet heavy U. S. Air Force bombers are the huge Boeing
B-52s, powered by eight J-57s mounted in pairs.

Blazing the Way for a New
Generation of Air Power

   

The most powerful‘ turbojet engine in production is 1/

blazing the way for a whole" new generation of I
American aircraft. _

That engine is Pratt & Whitney Aircraft’s J-57,
the ﬁrst turbojet to achieve an official rating inthe
10,000-pound thrust class. I

“But the J-57 provides far more than extreme high
thrust. Its unique Pratt &' Whitney Aircraft design,
achieved after years of intensive research and engi-
neering, offers as well the low speciﬁc fuel consump-
tion so vital to jet-powered bombers and future
transports, plus the additional important factor of
fast acceleration.

The importance of the J -57 in America’s air power
program is clearly shown by the fact that it is the
power plant for three of the new “century series”
ﬁghters for the U. S. Air Force—North American’s
l/7‘-100, McDonnell’s F-101 and Convair’s F-102-
as well as Boeing’s B-52 heavy bomber. The Navy,
”too, has chosen the J -57 for its most powerful attack

 aircraft, the Douglas A3D, the Douglas F4D ﬁghter
‘\/ and for the Chance Vought F8U day ﬁghter. And

the J -57 will power the Boeing 707 jet transport.

The J-57 is fully justifying the long years and
intensive effort required for its development, pro-
viding pace-setting performance for a new genera-
tion of American aircraft.

Engineering graduates who can see the challenge in this new generation, might well

 

consider on career with the world's foremost designer and builder of aircraft engines.

AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS AND THE

TORQUE CONVERTER
I)y.IoIm R. Fraas .Ir., M. E. ’55

Adisadvantage of a convential gear train is
that torque multiplication is always equivalent to the
meshed gear combination, and the engine torque is
reproduced proportionately. Unfortunately, in the
internal combustion engine, torque and fuel economy
curves drop off at low speeds when the demand for

high torque is the greatest. Thus a transmission is.

needed incorporating the features of the hydraulic
converter, by providing’ torque multiplicationsiwith
decreasing "speed to permit the engine to, operate
at its most efficient range. With the torque converter
engine and drive "train vibrations are isolated and
subdued, vehicle life is extended, driver effort is de-
creased and riding comfort is increased.

The cost of the torque converter is its main draw-
back. The public must pay in two ways for wanting
to avoid use of the clutch pedal and shift controls.
First, they cost more to make; second, they consume

‘ more fuel. They cost more because of expensive plas-

tic. molding of aluminum bladed wheel units, close
tolerances and many controls, such as pumps, valves,
and hydraulic controls. It costs one hundred and
seventy-five dollars to two hundred dollars to buy an
automatic transmission with efficiency characteristics

similar to a syncro-mesh type which can be produced '

for twenty or thirty dollars.

4. Because the efficiency curves drop off on either
side of the design point, the over-all efficiency is lower
than a regular gear-box transmission. Obviously, this
efficiency loss makes for greater gasoline consumption,
especially in city driving. Even on the highways, the

automatic transmission gives fewer miles per gallon.

than the gearing type. Conservative estimates of this
vary from one half to one and one half miles per
gallon, depending on the type of driving.

Converters have found their greatest acceptance
in city bus service where frequent starting and stop-

ping and continuous gear shifting results in short.

clutch life. The first hydraulic transmission was a
torque converter installed in GMC coaches. This facili-
tated better engine arrangement and more passenger
space. As far as urban bus transportation is concern-
ed, mechanical transmissions are a thing of the past.

The torque converter made its first appearance
on an American car in the dynaflow transmission,
announced by Buick. Thisdesign provides an auto-
matic variabldrive ratio without using gears or the

conventional clutch. The complete dynaflow is es- ,

centially a polyphase hydraulic torque converter in
front of a hydraulically applied two-speed and re-
verse planetary gear transmission. Both reverse and

32

low have positive gear ratios of 1.82 to l. The low
gear coupled with the torque converter at stand-still
is about 1.25 to 1. As the car starts, the ratio drops
through an infinite number of steps to l to l where
it acts a fluid coupling. This is why the torque
converter is called an infinitely variable ratio

"transmission. Judged in its entirety, the dynaflow

transmission offers, for the first time, a degree of
flexibility, ease, and performance never previously
presented. It makes car operation safer because of
simpler operations and instantaneous response.

Chevrolet power glide automatic transmission is
similar in operaton to its predecessor, dynaflow, in
that it as a ‘polyphase converter, which is designed
for greaterefficiency at_ higher speeds. Here again
the polyphase converter produces an efficiency curve
which reaches higher values at less torque multipli-
cation, obliterating the need for a direct drive clutch.

The torque converter is used in almost all other
passenger car drives. The difference is that in these
automatic transmissions, the converter is of the single
phase type, thus a c'ut-out_ clutch must be provided
to by—pass the torque "converter when the speed of the
vehical rises above the design point of the converter.
This eliminates efficiency loss which woud take place
if the converter was still coupled in the ‘power train.

About 1940, Allis Chalmers installed a torque
converter on its largest crawler tractor. The post war
model now features the converter as standard equip-
ment because it allows the engine to operate at a
higher power factor so the operator gets more work
done. The tractor now moves 22% more dirt at 6%
lower overhaul cost, -but slightly higher fuel con
sumption. A promising future ‘lies ahead for the hy-
draulic torque converter in the field of farm machin-
ery as it makes possiblomore work in less time.

Allis Chalmers also uses. a torque type of gear
motor on their model D grader.

The future of the hydraulic torque converter is
bright and extensive. Not because as an automatic
transmission it revolutionized driving methods, but
because of its effect on engine design. The torque
converter makes use of only the efficient range of
engine operation. As a result, the low efficiency part
of engine performance is unusable. For this reason,

_ the engine designer now may concentrate on improv-

ing the upper ranges .of engine performance, without
having to concern himself with sometimes conflicting
low speed requirements. The torque converter will
prove to be an impetus to future engine design. The
gas turbo jet coupled with a torque converter may
well be the engine of the future.

was warmly greeted by the laugh-
ing engineers. Earlier in the day
a student seminar was held in the

STORY

Mines at Pitt, was the Open House
held lrom 10:0() A. M. until 11:00
P. M. on Wednesday, March 14.
Engineering Hall, Thaw Hall, and
State Hall were filled with appro-
priate displays, depicting the ac-
tivities of the various departments
and, in particular, the theme of
Engineer’s Week, “The Role of the
Engineer in the Modern world."
Several thousand high school stu-
dents and the wives, parents, and
swee_thearts of Pitt students passed
through the buildings, reviewing
these outstanding displays.

The displays were engineered
and built by a solid core of hard
working students, many of whom
attended their individual depart-
mental dinners the previous even-
ing, Tuesday, March 13. All de-
partments reported a heavy turn-
out and a successful affair.

Tuesclay afternoon the patron
saint of the engineers, St. Patrick,
emerged from the belly of a Unit-
ed States Army tank, an unexpected
form of arrival, even for St. Pat.
Brief ceremonies were held on the
Cathedral lawn as hundreds of
green-capped engineers cheered.

The spirit for St. Pat’s arrival
had been building up since Mon-

morning green derbys began to
pop up all over the campus. Smil-
ing engineers were leafing through
the Engineers’ Week issue of the
SKYSCiRAPER ENGINEER, look-

ligious services were held during
fifth hour, Monday: the all-faith
services in Heinz Chapel and the
Catholic Seminar in Stephen Foster

Late Monday evening, two hun-
dred nurses invaded the eighth
floor of the Cathedral for the annu-
al Engineer’s 1/Veek Mixer Dance.
The engineer’s spirit soared to
great heights that evening and must
have carried through the rest of
Engineer’s Week. From the selling
of green derbies Monday morning
up until the night of the Shamrock

that this was the greatest Engi-

How the world’s first atomic suh was welded

Welding the hull of the USS Nautilus, world’s ﬁrst
atomic submarine, presented a tough problem.

Submerged-arc automatic welding seemed-to be ideal
for the job. Question was——could you rotate the hull
sections of the Nautilus to take advantage of this fast,
high-quality welding method?

Worthington’s answer to General Dynamics Corpo-
ration’s Electric Boat Division, builder of the Nautilus,
was the largest turning roll ever built.

The result? Welding of the Nautilus hull was accom-
plished in record~breaking time — and cost less than
originally estimated. Unchanged, the Worthington roll

set-up is also being used in the construction of the
nation’s second atomic sub, the USS Sea Wolf.
Turning rolls for submarines aren’t all that Worth-
ington makes. The long list of Worthington-designed,
Worthington-built equipmerrt includes air conditioning
units, construction machinery, compressors, Diesel en-
gines, steam power equipment and, of course, pumps

Instructional Goal of Engineering Education

by Dr. Ting-Hsin Chin, E. E. Dept.

  

DR. TING-HSIN ICHI-N

Dr. Ting-Hsin Chin was introduced
as a new faculty member in the Jan-
uary issue of THE SKYSCRAPER ENGI-
NEER. He received his B.S. in elec-
trical engineering from the Chiago-Tung
University in Shanghai, China. The
University of Wisconsin conferred up-
on him a M.S. degree and a PH. D.
degree in electrical engineering.

The instructional goals of en-
gineering in general include:

1. To help the student learn to
deal with new situations in
terms of fundamental prin-
ciples and with well ordered
analytical thicning.

2. To develop initiative.

3. To think in terms of scien-
tific generalizations.

-1. To keep abreast of the new
developments in science and
technology.

$51

To continue to grow intelec-
tually and culturally after the
end of formal education.

Engineeringl-advancement is char-
acterized by either dealing with
new situations or by obtaining new
solutions to old ones. The success-
ful treatment of a new situation
involves the application of well

understood fundamental principals
as well as ordered analytical think-
ing in defining the problem, plan-
ning its simplificaton without los-
ing the essential nature, carrying
the problem through to a success-
ful conclusion, checking the solu-
tion at each stage, and finally real-
izing what has been learned that
is of value in this situation and in
others that may be encountered in
the future. Significant problems
problems rarely come to the engi-
n_eer in clear, concise form that
can be recognised as being simply
mechanical, or electrical, or ther-
mal, or confined to some other well-
defined area. In practice, they are
likely to cut across several fields
and may involve, in addition to
technological and scientific factors,
social factors as well. Hence. it is

INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT

TEXTILES . u .
SPINNING FABULOUS YARNS

The textile industry—through its variety
of processes and products—plays one of
the most signiﬁcant roles in the everyday
lives and activities of "all Americans. To-
day, efﬁcient men, methods and machines
produce yarns and fabrics for an almost
endless list of products of which clothing,
carpets, drapes, tires, belting. shoes and
furniture are but a sample..With hearten-
ing regularity, textile manufacturing ad-
vances are being made, new ﬁbers and
blends created, and new applications de-
veloped.

Pacing textile industry progress is an
intensive research program. Synthetics now
are as familiar and serviceable as cotton,
wool and other natural ﬁbers, and have

46

freed us from any dependence upon im-
ports such as silk. Concentrated develop-
ment of the industry’s manufacturing pro-
cesses has brought new techniques and
methods to improve and speed up the
transformation of raw ﬁber into ﬁnished
material.

But not content with the dynamic prog-
ress already made, the textile industry is
continuing to reinvest earnings to insure
further advances. It is enIis_ted—with its
suppliers and processors—in a never-end-
ing effort to improve machines and methods.

An important requirement in this second
largest industry in America is steam, used
in textile plants for power, processing and
heating. The Babcock & Wilcox Company,

 

whose experience with steam extends over
nearly a century, has long been a contribu-
tor to textile industry progress. B&W
boilers and associated equipment are being
improved constantly as B&W’s research
and engineering facilities devote time, ef-
fort and money to help make better boilers
for all industry. The Babcock & Wilcox

How to get longer
roller and belt life
in a conveyor system

. Engineers had to ﬁnd a way to reduce costly friction
and wear on rollers and idlers in designing this big
conveyor system. It handles up to 3,300 tons of ore
per hour on each of two 54" belts traveling at more
than 500 feet per minute. Their solution: Mounting
the idlers on Timken® tapered roller bearings.
Result: reduced friction, less sliding and scuﬂing
between idlers and belts, longer roller and belt life.

 

 
 
  
  

True rolling motion,
high precision practically
eliminate friction _-

0 All lines drawn coincident with the working surfaces
of the rollers and races of Timken bearings meet at
a common point on the bearing axis. This means
Timken bearings are designed by geometrical law
to have true rolling motion. And they're manufac-
tured with great accuracy to live up to their design.
Result: Timken bearings practically eliminate fric-
tion, give longer bearing life, keep conveyors roll-
ing smoothly.

1” 0 UR F U TUBE — Chemistry and Koppers?

IN an age when most frontiers are
shrinking, there is one that is constant-
ly growing—the frontier of the chemist.

This frontier has been pushed slowly
back ever since the days of the pioneer
18th and 19th Century chemists. Their
theories, proved in laboratories, were
made useful by the mechanical genius
of engineers such as Heinrich Koppers,
designer of the modern chemical recov-
ery coke oven. These early scientists
laid the foundation for the diversified
chemical industry that has grown so
rapidly in the 20th Century.

And what are the results? An indus-
try that has helped mankind by devel-
oping entirely new and better products
for more pleasant living; an industry
that has extended the life of man by
developing new or improved medicines;
an industry that 11as extended the
life of many materials, conserving our
natural resources.

Your future? It's going to be "touched
by chemistry to an extent never dreamed
of by earlier college classes. That's why
a future in the chemical industry can be
such a rewarding one for those who are
not afraid of the challenge of responsi-
bility, the new and the difﬁcult.

In addition to chemicals and plastics,
Koppers produces tar products, metal
products, pressure-treated wood. It de-
signs and builds coke, steel and chem-
ical plants.

made the cruising speeds of airplanes were under 200
miles an hour, and the designers of wings, tails, and
bodies needed to give little thought to the influence
of Mach numbers. But wth the adaption of higher-
powered engines, cowling, and retractable landing
gear, speds increased. It was realized that propellers
of higher efficiency would be needed. As aircraft
moved on into higher speed ranges, the propeller
must be shaped to bite into the thin air of the upper
atmosphere, and to avoid the ever-threatening hazard
of shock waves. From these researches came the pad-
dle shaped propeller, now in use on all high-speed
propeller-diven aircraft.

The Nazi's had a huge supersonic tunnel at their
research station and experimental laboratories at
Peenemunde. During the war it had been removed to
Kochel, B-avaria, where it was found by American
soldiers late in the..war. Air Force and Navy experts
decided it must have been used for propeller, shell,
and guided missle research. The Germans had been
using Schlieren mirrors to photograph the air flow
around the models in the supersonic. airstream. The
wind source was a huge, 40-foot vacuum sphere that
could be evacuated in five minutes by means of a
series of pumps totalling 1,100 hp. A small concrete
tunnel led from this chamber to the test chamber. A
valve developed at the station permitted making an

opening of 271/2 inch diameter in less than one-tenth '

of a second. A bank of 120 manometers measured
pressures in the chamber, and high-speed cameras
closely recorded the air flow. The wind blast lasted
only a very short time, for its source was a vacuum
chamber, but much must have been accomplished in
it on V-2 research.

An incident problem _at the 80-foot Moffett tun-
nel is the heat effect. Six fans of 6,000 hp. drive the
wind at a speed approaching sonic velocity, and all
this power is absorbed by the air in the form of heat.
It was figured that if no means of cooling were pro-
vided, the inside temperature would rise ten degrees
a second until it reached a stage where the amount

of heat seeping through the concrete walls would bal-_

ance the input from the power-plant. But it would
take two hours for this equilibrium to be reached,
and. meanwhile a temperature of thousands of de-

grees would have developed ‘inside the tunnel. Every-
thing combustible would have gone up in smoke; the

‘steel would be a running liquid.

Russell G. Robinson, -a young engineer -on the
Langley staff, devised a ventilating tower by which
a small amount of the heated air is allowed to escape
each instant of operation, while simultaneously an
equal amount of fresh, cool air is taken in. This ar-
rangement proved to be entirely successful, and is so
economical that the exchange is accomplished with
less than 1 per cent loss of power. Several other tun-
nels have been built using a modified Robinson ven-
tilating system.

One of the main purpose of engineering is the
prediction of performance, ‘and aeronautical engi-
neering is, of course, no exception. However, since
aerodynamics is largely experimental, certain research
experiments must be made. Bcause data must be ob-
tained experimentally, it is obvious that it should
be had at the lowest possible cost and in '.thC shortest
possible time. The wind tunnel, with its auxiliary
apparatus, is the chief equipment of the experimental
aerodynamicist. As mentioned before, the purpose of
the wind tunnel is to measure the air forces, pressures,
and the like, on, largely, scale models. The Wright
brothers found they had to have experimental data
before they could build a practical aircraft, and what
was true then is just as true of the latest fighters and
bombers. Every one of them was hatched in a wind
tunnel.

The top aviation demands of today are almost
frighteningly exact. They call for mechanisms so re-
fined, packed with so much power, loaded with so
many tons of fuel, armor, armament, and other ma-
terials, capable of flight at such altitudes and speeds
that no engineer can compute and lay out in advance
the design that will meet all the latest‘ requirements
of the military. Each aircraft as it is concelved is the
heir of more than forty years of research. And yet
these accumulated data are not enough. Each new
design must be worked out individually. One of the

famous late bombers, after its shape ‘had been de-'

veloped in small scale model tests, went through five’

different wind tunnels before it was finally pronouced

fit to fly under the severe demands of modrn Warfare.

FOR THE BENEFIT of the young engineer who is

puzzling Over his future—hasn’t yet decided
on a job—-we’d like to mention some facts about
General Motors.

GM gives young engineers a great chance to follow
their natural bent— because GM makes a wide variety
of products including cars, trucks, Diesel engines,
Prop-Jet aircraft engines, road-building machines,
home appliances, military equipment.

GM gives young engineers an opportunity to work
with small, friendly groups of more experienced men,
in a choice of locations. For GM is decentralized

into 34 manufacturing divisions with 122 plants in
67 U. S. cities.

At GM, the young engineer ﬁnds prestige, security,
the support of vast technical resources, including the
research facilities of a multimillion-dollar Technical
Center.

He is encouraged in his professional growth through
training programs, publication of reports, material
incentives, and assignment of additional responsibil-
ities as rapidly as he is able to handle them.

Fact is, the way things are going now, 40% of GM
executive posts will be ﬁlled by men with engineering
backgrounds.

Think you can take the measure of a job with
the world’s largest and most successful industrial
company—dedicated to producing “mOre and better
things for more people”?

lems of professional practice, they
can recognise the separate factors
and deal with all of them ade-

quately.
The translation of new scientific
developments into engineering

practice will be facilitated by in-

tegrating scientific subject matter.;
For example, there is a great deal-

of similarity, both in conceptal
understanding and in analytical

methods in the generalizations of
heat flow, mechanics of fluids, e-
lectromagnetic fields, and variation
theory. When a student under-
stands these generalizations, he has
gained a concept of systematic or-
der of many fields of science and
engineering which enables him to
approach the solution of problem:

in widely diverse fields, using ap-
proximately the same analytical
methods. This unification of meth-
ods of analysis can be accomplisl1—
ed to a limited degree without as-T,
cending into higher mathamatical’
levels. It can be accomplished to

a considerably higher degree by]
utilizing advanced mathamatical

techniques. Unification at this ad-

vanced level makes it possible to

derive fundamental equations in

the most general form. Such gener-
alizations and the method of reduc-
ing these to the solutions of spe-
cific problems often lend ‘them-
selves to application in many fields.

It is usually important that in-
structional goals give the student
an understanding and apprectia-
tion of the historical and cultural
heritage, as well as a sense of moral
value upon which the individual
can bulid a sound philosophy of
life. It is also recognized that many
engineers progress 1nto manager-
ical and executive positions in in-
dustry and other institutions.
Hence, a foundation should be laid
in college for an understanding of
human relationships, business man-
agement, the principles of econ-
omics, as well as other fields upon
which the engineer can build.

Education for the profession of
engineering does not stop with the
acquisition of a degree; it must
continue through. life. Probably
the most important goal of engi-
neering education is to motivate the
student to learn on his own initi-
ative. Self-study, both by students
and by graduates, can be made
more effective by developing a
knowledge of correct reading hab-
its and library utilization.

HE first question you’d ask is . . .
does the design do the best job
at lowest cost? If not—wby not.

Industry constantly asks why things
are done the way they are . . . to see if
there is a better, less costly way.

One question is why shouldn’t all
machinery be designed for welded
steel. . . when steel designs are strong-
er, more rigid, more rugged . . . yet
cost less to build.

By knowing how to use welded

steel, you hold the answers to many’

designing problems. Here for example
is how one machine part is made for
43% less cost by a simple change from
cast iron to steel.

what it is -
Clicker die steel is a special cold rolled alloy steel. It is used
in making clicker dies for cutting leather, rubber, plastic,
felt and fabrics of other compositions that
go into the making of shoes
and similar products.

how it is used

Clicker die steel is furnished to the die maker in either
single or double edged form in one of several standard
shapes. The die maker ﬁrst shapes the die by bending
the die steel to a pattern that provides the desired con-
ﬁguration, and then welds the two ends at a corner. He
ﬁnishes the die by grinding a bevel on the outside of the
cutting edge and ﬁling the inside edge. Before the ﬁn-
ished die is hardened and tempered, the die maker
forms identiﬁcation marks — combinations of circles
and squares — in the cutting edge so that the material
cut from it may be easily identiﬁed as to its size and
style.

In the cutting operation, the leather or other material
is placed on an oak block in the_bed of the clicker
machine. Then the die is placed by hand on the material
which is cut as the aluminum faced head of the machine
presses the die through it. The clicking sound which
the head makes as it strikes the die is where the term
“clicker machine” derived its name.

what it is composed of

Clicker die steel as produced by the Crucible Steel
Company of America is a controlled electric steel in
which the combination of carbon and alloy is designed

for maximum toughness and proper hardness after heat
treatment.

Experience has proved that cold ﬁnished clicker die
steel is superior to hot rolled, material for sizes ap-
proximately 3/, inch and narrower because of its lower
degree of surface decarburization which permits the
use of slightly thinner sections. Cold ﬁnished material
also has a better surface ﬁnish with closer width and
thickness tolerances and thinner edges that require
less grinding and ﬁling to complete the die.

l.'l’.lll.'lBLE'S engineering service

As with clicker die steel, the Crucible Steel Company of
America is the leading producer of special purpose
steels. If you have a problem in specialty steels, our staff
of ﬁeld metallurgists with over 50 years experience in
ﬁne steel making is available to help you solve it.

PHOTOGRAPHY AT WORK—No. 21 in a Kodak series

To create in steel the ﬂowing lines of today’s cars, calls for metal of paticul forming qualities.

Sleek styling starts with special steel;
Pﬂotagrapﬁy lllI‘IZ.§' cﬁe/7zz.'s't—ﬂe40.s'pr0a'zzc6' 12:

Fenders, hoods, roofs and side panels
call for best quality steel—and the
watchful eye of photography guards
specifications and controls that quality.

Car designers’ dreams come true only if steel forms
well under the pressure of deep drawing opera-
tions. That takes a particularly high quality steel.

Great Lakes Steel Corporation, Detroit, Mich.,
unit of National Steel Corporation, makes this
steel for the automobile industry. And to make
sure of its high quality they use photography.
For example, during production, spectrograms
show chemical make—up—insure the proper minute
quantities of alloying elements, and photomicro-
graphs reveal crystalline structure.

Controlling quality is but one of the many ways
photography works for modern industry. In small
businesses and large it is aiding product design,
simplifying production, creating sales and expe-
diting ollice routine.

At G1 eat Lakes Steel a spectrogram is readied for reading in
the densitonieter—-one of the tests that assure quality steel.

Behind the many photographic products be-
coming increasingly Valuable today and those
being planned for tomorrow lie intriguing and
challenging opportunities at Kodak in research,
design and production.

If you are interested in these opportunities in
science and engineering—whether you are a recent
graduate or a qualiﬁed returning serviceman, write

B-52 iack screw—a typical Boeing design

On Boeing B-52 bombers, the hori-
zontal tail surface has more area than the
wing of a standard twin—engine airliner.
Yet it can be moved in flight, up or down,
to trim the aircraft.

The device that performs this function
is a jack screw, which, though it weighs

.only 255 pounds, can exert a force of

approximately 225 tons.’

Many kinds of engineering skills went
into designing and developing a jack
screw so precise that it automatically com-
pensates for stretch and compression
under load. Civil, electrical, mechanical
and aeronautical engineers, and mathe-
maticians and physicists — all find chal-
lenging work on Boeing design projects
for the B-52 global jet bomber, and for
the 707 jet tanker-transport, the B0-

MARC IM—99 pilotless interceptor, and
aircraft of the future.

Because of Boeing’s steady expansion,
there is continuing need for additional
engineers. There are more than twice as
many engineers with the company now
as at the peak of World War II. Because
Boeing is an “engineers’ company,” and
promotes from within, these men find
unusual opportunities for advancement.

Design engineers at Boeing work with
other topnotch engineers in close—knit
project teams. They obtain broad experi-
ence with outstanding men in many
fields, and have full scope for creative
expression, professional growth and indi-
vidual recognition. And they find satis-
faction in the high engineering integrity
that is a Boeing byword.

In addition to design engineering,
there are openings on other Boeing teams
in research and production. Engineers
like the life in the “just-right” size com-
munities of Seattle and Wichita. They
may pursue advanced studies with com-
pany assistance in tuition and participate
in a most liberal retirement plan. There
may be a place for you at Boeing—Seattle
or Boeing—Wichita.
