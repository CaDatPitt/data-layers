Why not spend the money here on earth?

All money apporpriated to the space program
is spent on Earth and is used to purchase goods
and services. Specifically, about 100,000
Americans are employed because of the space
program conducting research to improve fire-
resistant fabrics and paint, smaller and longer-
lasting radios and TV’s, tougher plastics, stronger
adhesives, electronic monitoring systems for
hospital patients, a heart monitor inserted through
a hypodermic needle rather than by surgery, im-
proved computer technology, as well as other
areas of research. These employees spend their
salaries on homes, food, cars, education,.taxes,
and entertainment — all here on Earth.

— Questions and Answers AboutAeronautics and
Space
NASA PAM 106, July 1985

As recently as July, this was NASA’s official response
to the question of extraterrestrial economics. However,
by using my high-security vend-a-card and my important
position on the Skyscraper staff, I have been able to
discover the shocking truth. In the last two, maybe three
months, it has become apparent to me that the United
States has been involved for some time now in a project
of the greatest concern to millions of Earth-people now
wandering the surface of this very planet. Yes, the United
States has been involved in the drive to complete the first
extraterrestrial economic transaction.

I (mass = 58.97 kg), ever in faithful service to
Skyscraper, except when I’d rather be doing something
else, decided to look into this. I got down on my hands
and knees to find one of the most important figures in this
program, Dr. Shirley en Pantoufles (mass = 55.34 kg),
who, darn the luck, just happens to work right here at the
University as a professor of Aero-Space Studies and Oral
Medicine. I talked to her in her laboratory deep below Fifth
Ave., across from Burger King as she compiled some ex-
periments relative to the project along with members of
the Electrical Engineering and Nuclear Physics
department.

According to Dr. en Pantoufles, there were a number
of different factions at NASA, each grappling for political
and ideological control of the project. The current favorite
involves some kind of economic exchange between our
own astronauts (mean mass = 77.11 kg), during one of
the Space Shuttle missions. Dr. en Pantoufles’ research
has determined that this apporach does seem to be the
most immediately effective. The two most favored
methods at this point are souvenir stands and vending
machines.

Dr. en Pantoufles showed me her main equipment rack,
which was interfaced with an atom probe, probing the
atomic structures of both an old spring—loaded cash
register (mass 18.14 kg) and a new DEC Electronic In-
ventory Outflow Awareness Terminal (mass 4.54 kg). She
then proceeded to bombard them both with short, high-
intensity gamma ray bursts (22 bursts at 3.724 seconds
each, radiation level 140 millirems) while sending them

both down an air track at 19.622 km/h into a formica
countertop 16 feet away. After impact, Dr. en Pantoufles
found that the spring-loaded cash register’s atomic struc-
ture was remarkably intact, although the mechanism itself
was pretty well demolished, and the DEC E|OAT’s CMOS
circuitry and atomic structure were totally wiped out by
the radiation and were replaced by boat-form
cyclohexane.

“That’s our chief problem,” she said, twirling a broken
spring in her hand, “How can we find some means of
keeping track of these transactions that won’t be
destroyed by the ravages beyond the ether?” I calculated
Dr. en Pantoufles’ language to be 78.5% excessive, and
told her so, an action with a 95% probability of nasty
results. Dr. en Pantoufles told me that she was a doctor,
da'"mmit, not an English major and that there were men
dying down there. I said that perhaps she had been wat-
ching 1700 lU’s too many Star Trek reruns. She agreed
and handed over her phaser (mass = .22 kg), mutter-
ing something about Starfleet Command. I would have
suggested she try an abacus, but, wishing to avoid
violence, I left.

I then decided to talk to Dr. Nugae Petruzzi (mass =
68.04 kg), part-time neorsurgeon and one of Dr. en Pan-
toufles’ colleagues.

“You have to understand,” he said, flipping his com-
municator open and shut, “that the strains of working on
this project can get to a person.” He picked up a packet
of dilithium crystals and began to toss them. ‘‘I mean, after
all, people have been working on this project since the
early fifties, so  He stared blankly at the opposite wall.
“Say, I could sure go for a Tang. How about you?”

I asked Dr. Petruzzi about the history of the program.
“Ah, uh, I, uh, really can’t talk too much about that, but,
uh  he said, lightly stroking the tribble on his desk, ‘‘I
think I need a vacation.”

Although Dr. Petruzzi was of little help in finding the
history of the program, I was able to do a little digging and
come up with some answers.

It seems that the government has indeed been invlov-
ed with this project since the early fifties. The original idea
was to contact some aliens and exchange goods with
them — maybe barter off a few TV dinners or
paperweights or Vegas showgirls, with the hope of get-
ting some spacecraft or miracle drugs in return. This
specific version of the plan fell through due to lack of fun-
ding, which, it seems, is just as well because in recent
years, SETI has found that the extraterrestrials know the

 

value of TV dinners, having watched TV broadcasts for
years, can serve as their own paperweights, and have
already abducted countless Vegas showgirls,

The lack of funding did not stop the government from
trying to carry out an alternate, less expensive version of
the plan. I’m sure you’ve heard the rumor that the govern-
ment has the bodies of a number of dead extraterrestrials
in cryogenic storage, along with their dissembled
spacecraft. I have found that this is indeed the case. Not
only are the aliens and their spacecraft in storage, but the
government also has a bag of groceries they were sup-
posed to pick up. It remains unclear exactly what we were
supposed to get in return.

Due to this crash, however, and the annoying tenden-
cy of Air Force planes to chase these extraterrestrial
vessels about and get themselves shot down in the pro-
cess, relations between our planet and the aliens have
been lukewarm at best. As a result, a number of other
plans were developed to complete a transaction in space.
A definite Las Vegas influence appeared in many of these
programs. For example, NASA attempted to initiate crap

 
 

games aboard the Gemini missions in the Sixties. The
absence of gravity caused a problem, though, because
the dice never really came to rest. NASA tried the gambl-
ing scene again with slot machines on Skylab, but the
astronauts couldn't get the coins to drop into the slots for
many of the same reasons.

Finally, in the late Seventies, the Apollo-Soyuz missions
was actually an attempt to exchange goods between
American and Soviet astro/cosmonauts. There was no in-
herent problem with this idea, but both teams brought our-
rency and neither brought any goods. “We thought you
guys had it,” was NASA’s official comment.

The government, however, is doing things right now to
prepare for its future projects. In order to find out about
these, I went back to Dr. Petruzzi, who said that the
government is currently drafting volunteers to set up the
first fully-operational capitalistic societies beyond Earth’s
atmosphere. My roomate, for example, has been miss-
ing for the pst 36 days, so I can only assume (ultimate
apathy factor of 9.4) that he will be one of the lucky or-
bital capitalist bourgeiosie. Dr. Petruzzi, looking down his

list of projects in the works, told me that my roomate (mass
= 97.5 kg) will be shot into orbit at 11.19 kmls with a
quarter and pay phone.

“People must realize that this sort of thing is perfectly,
uh  Dr. Petruzzi said, adjusting the settings on his
tricorder, “safe. I mean, other than the funny taste in my
mouth and this constant buzzing noise that follows me
wherever I go, this project is use  He reached up and
pulled off his right eyebrow. “harmless. No need to worry,
Mr. Scott. Just get back to Engineering and check on the
warp engines.” He turned to the water cooler. “Proceed
under impulse power, Mr. Sulu.”

At that moment, Dr. en Pantoufles burst through the
door. “Dammit, Jim, are you jeopardizing the project
again?” She pulled another phaser from her thigh holster.
“Get out.” She turned to me. ‘‘If you print this, you’re go-
ing to be in big trouble.”

Fortunately, I was able to get additional information out
of Dr. Petruzzi before this episode and found that the
government is making plans to capitalize the universe at
an alarming rate. For example, a project is now under-
way to shoot a number of migrant farm workers in space,
under the logic that “lt’s a cinch that sometime some of
them will land somewhere” and set up agrarian-based
capitalisms all over the known universe.

Even though this project sounds rather silly, it is of the
utmost importance. Just think about this: The Soviet Union
is now constructing a parking meter that will eventually
be level with satellites in geosynchronous orbit. Would you

want your kids to live in a world where they had to keep

running out of the Lagrange colony to put rubles in the
meter? I think not.

As if this alone were not enough, there is absolutely no
time to lose in getting started. The GRU, for example, is
known to reserve seven seats and 89.384% of a luggage
compartment on a special transport directly to Moscow
each month just for each issue of Skyscraper. Now that
this article has come out, they are undoubtedly going to
step up their efforts. Therefore, I urge you to-

‘‘All right, get away from the computer.” Dr. en Pan-
toufles has burst through the door and levelled her phaser
at me. “l told you if you printed this you’d get into trou-
ble.” She smiles. “Now, just do what I say, and nobody’s
going to get hurt.” She taps her foot. “l said, get away
from that —”

Maurice Rickard is also an Economics major and is still
umemployed.

MY BATTLE
by Kevin W. Bold

Being one of Adolph Hitler's henchmen hadn’t been as
easy as my supervisor had let on, but he never told me
much — just the better half of the truth. That Earthman
was crazy enough to start a war without having me to give
him ideas, but I obeyed Good Ol’ Dad and went like a good
evolution driver. Besides, being a driver was fun: while
he did the heavy math and charted trend, I saw many in-
habited planets from a native’s-eye view.

But some assignments, like that Hitler job, get rougher
than any driver would take on if he knew upfront what
would happen. When my consciousness returned to my
body, I screamed so loud they could hear me before I
climbed from the gel in my body tank, and it took four
orderlies to hold my slippery body down and sedate me.
I was almost unconscious when they debriefed me.

“Did Germany fail to perfect atomic weapons?”

“Uhh-hunhh...”

“And did the United States capture leading German
rocket scientists?”

“Uhh-hunhh...”

“Excellent!” beamed Good Ol’ Dad. “With a monopo-
Iy on both rockets and atomic weapons, the United States
will dismantle the Soviet Union and enforce a Pax
Americana. War will no longer trouble that planet, leav-
ing them to devote their energies to medicine and space
science. Within fifty revolutions about their star, they will
be sufficiently sophisticated to merit direct contact.”

But if I had done such a good job, why did I have to
get a memory-freeze before I woke up?

After a short ‘hospital stay the Boss let me have the
longest vacation I ever had. He told me I deserved it as
much as I needed it. When I came back, he greeted me
personally, and said he had an assignment that could win
me an early retirement upon my return.

We went into his office, not my usual supervisor’s, and
discussed it in detail.

“|t’s a clean, one-shot assassination. You are to
eliminate a man name Khar-in Ulallh before he founds a
new religion and keeps his culture pre-scientific for at least
several of his planet's millenia.” On most life-supporting
worlds, that's a long time any way you slice it.

“You won’t have to do anything fancy, Lou,” said Good
Ol’ Dad. “Just get in, do your job, then come back and
go on record as one of the best evolution drivers who ever
worked for me.”

My pride would not let me ignore this assignment. With
a “Yes, sir," and a smile I turned and headed for the tank
room for my subliminal instructions and my sendoff.

Whenever I prepared to leave I would reflect on our mis-
sion — to make sure every intelligent race evolved on
schedule, working for the day when a culture was ready

to contact and join our search for the mechanism
regulating the lifespan of the universe. We knew it was
out there —- but where? And we had to find it, to figure
it out, and make it work so the universe would not keep
expanding and eventually die. We knew enough about
higher dimensions to know it could be done. Anything was
possible with Good Ol’ Dad, and with enough help, it
would happen even sooner.

As I eased myself into the tank I thought of how we had
seeded the universe, sending ships with genetic material
to suitable planets where it would evolve into self-aware
intelligence. Now we defied the speed limit of light and
sent our consciousness to enter their minds and help them
develop scientific knowledge.

Mine was one of those minds which traveled to these
fledgeling worlds, to plant an idea here, nurse one along
somewhere else, or direct someone’s gaze toward the
skies with wonder. To be a prophet —— or, sometimes, like
this time, kill one — it all depended on orders from our
fatherly boss we had nicknamed “Good Ol’ Dad.”

My /ast/‘ob, I said to myself, as my consciousness raced
past the worlds. Traces of the journey’s vision faded in
and out of my host’s mind as I entered.

I heard a female give a short, muffled gasp — my host
sensed my presence within her. Her senses told me cold
winds were blowing as snowflakes landed on her body.
Her eyes opened, and through them I saw my target
huddled in her arms.

Khar-in Ulallh, her son.

Her son! Her infant son!

Priestesses stood on either side of me; the chief of the
tribe sat across from us on his throne. Between us was
an altar with a ceremonial fire.

The woman’s tribe suffered from a food shortage, and
when a child was born, they asked their gods for a sign
to let it live or sacrifice it to the food deities. I’d seen this
scam before and I knew it by heart; the deities always
voted for the sacrifice.

l’ve killed a lot of people on a lot of worlds, but this one
was too much; as the woman’s mind melted into mine,
her body was responding to my emotions — and the
nausea was tearing us up.

It was near revulsion and mine against my programm-
ing. Both were unyielding; THROW IT IN THE FIRE IT’S
YOUR DUTY IT’S MY SON MY SON MY SON YOU
BASTARD...

The priestesses sensed the depth of the conflict and
moved closer with hands on belted knives.

...KlLL IT YOU HAVE THE ORDERS THIS IS INSANE
IT’S EVIL GO AHEAD DO IT WHAT ARE YOU WAITING
FOR WHY HAVE YOU INVADED ME THIS WAY...

Like a small bell that restores order I heard a youthful
voice. It was the infant’s consciousness.

Why do you wish to harm me?

I had no such desire, and neither did the mother. To
whom do you speak, son?

There are three of you, spoke the Child. One rightfully,
one a usurper, and within him, something that should not
be.

Right on target, kid.

You think killing me will prevent bloodshed. It will not,
nor will it bring you closer to any of your other goals. I know
this, for I am in contact with the entity you seek.

What the... ?

You think it is a mechanism. You are wrong. It is a mind,
it is a gateway, it is many things. In your terminology, it
is the four-dimensional object which casts this three-
dimensional universe as its shadow.

The woman’s mind was frozen — the child’s doing —
but I was all ears.

Your people had those who knew these things. It was
not your science which led you away from this knowledge
— it was your false belief in meddling in the evolution of
others, your disbelief in the abilities of the Object to con-
trol evolution. Yes, you obeyed, and sent life throughout
the universe, but as time passed you forgot where your
knowledge came from. That was the first of many failures.
Now go back, and take with you this knowledge, and all
the memories your elders removed from you.

My past came back, the good and the bad: the plagues
on Bethaxus, the World Wars on Earth, contact with the
first space colonies orbiting Cestal, the slaughter of
several million “heretics” in one day on Argas...

And with renewed memories I went back, screaming
with blind rage when I woke up in the tank, and this time
no number of orderlies could hold me. I picked up a two-
handed scoop of gel from my tank, and with knowledge
that must have come from the kid, wearing only slippery
gel and some wires, I ran straight for the main control
mechanism. With strength I did not know I had kicked it
open and poured the slimy stuff right where it did the most
harm.

The Boss could not believe what I had done, nor could
he believe how far back |’d set his plans. “Ages,” he
screamed, and no one had ever heard him scream before.

But nothing had disturbed him more than my pride in
my deed, my certainty that what I had done was right, and
my refusal to feel any remorse.

He never listened to my story; he never even told me
where_ he got off telling me to kill a baby. I had ruined
everything, possibly beyond hope of repair. He was smug
when he announced my punishment.

“You will be disappointed, I’m sure, to hear you didn’t
quite ruin everything. One of the tanks is still working,
though barely, and we have just enough energy for one
last transfer. A one-way transfer, Lou, with no guarantee
you will find an intelligent host. Or a host at all, for that
matter.”

I knew they would destroy my body, but my mind would
die more slowly. What is consciousness with not host?
And with an unsuitable host, such as an inferior animal,
what is there for intelligence but eternal misery?

My fears were baseless; only an intelligent host will take
me, and there are many in the universe. I have had several
now, and over the centuries I have learned how to move
from one host to another at will, even at leisure, and I have
come to love intelligence, as well as life, and with great
joy I have repaid, many times over, those I have wronged.

For in my travels I have prepared the people of the
universe, making them ready for the day when Good Ol’
Dad will have his machines repaired to send his agents
once again, meddling in everyone else’s evolution, rather
than continue his own. When I find a sufficiently advanc-
ed race, I tell them the facts; some are all the more deter-
mined to perfect faster-than-light spaceships to wage war
on my former home. With more primitive peoples, I leave
clues in their myths and legends they will remember when
their time comes.

Tonight I am an old man, a storyteller, and the tribe sits
down to hear my tale. Tonight it will be my favorite, and
theirs, too.

Tonight, I will tell them about the one whom the other
gods punished because he loved them so much...

Galileo :

A Voyage to Jupiter

by Sanjiv Gupta

“On the seventh day of January in the present year 1610,
at the first hour of the night, when I was viewing the
heavenly bodies with a telescope, Jupiter presented itself
to me; and because / had prepared a very excellent instru-
ment for myself, / perceived (as I had not before, on ac-
count of the weakness of my previous instrument) that
beside the planet there were three starlets, small indeed
but very bright.”

So wrote Galileo Galilei, describing his momentous
discovery. A few days later, he discovered a fourth star
beside the Jovian planet. After observing these four
starlets for a number of days, he arrived at an inescapable
conclusion; a conclusion which would nearly cost him his
life. Galileo concluded, correctly, that these four “stars”
were actually orbiting around Jupiter. He had inadvertently
proved Nicolaus Copernicus’ heliocentric theory. Accor-
ding to Copernicus, the Sun was the center of the
universe, and all of the planets including the Earth orbited
around it. Unfortunately this idea was against the
teachings of the church, which placed the Earth at the
center of the universe with all other heavenly bodies
revolving about it. Galileo would pay heavily for his
discovery of objects orbiting around another planet. This
heresy, and others, would ultimately force him to face the
inquisition.

Three centuries later, in March of 1979, a robot explorer
from the Sun’s third planet flew through the Jovian system
and returned stunning pictures of Ga|ileo’s four “starlets,”
the inner satellites of Jupiter. These four moons,
Ganymede, lo, Callisto and Europa, are now called the
Galilean Satellites in honor of their discoverer. The
spacecraft that carried out man’s first detailed recon-
naissance of the Jovian system was Voyager 1. In the ear-
ly seventies, the Pioneer 10 and 11 probes whetted our
appetite by sailing past Jupiter and providing us with tan-
talizing glimpses of the solar system’s largest planet; a
planet so huge that it contains more mass than all the
other eight planets put together. When Voyager 1 made
its flyby, we accumulated more information about Jupiter
in a few hours than man had gathered since first discover-
ing the planet. Voyager 1 answered a few questions, and
raised many more. Four months later, her sister ship
Voyager 2 made a repeat performance. Many mysteries
remain unsolved after these two brief intrusions into
Jupiter’s domain. The Jovian system has so much more
to tell us.

That’s why we’re going back. This time, our robot
emissary will make an extended visit, rather than a tran-
sient pass through the system on the way to yet another
brief planetary encounter. The spacecraft that will become
the first artificial satellite of Jupiter will be called, ap-
propriately, Galileo. Galileo, the robot, will go where
Galileo, the man, could only peer at through a spyglass
and dream of going.

Galileo Jupiter 1986

The Jupiter Orbiter-Probe mission was approved by
Congress in 1977, before the Voyager spacecraft even
reached the planet. The spacecraft for the mission would
consist of three parts, each meant to satisfy the conflic-
ting needs of three different groups of scientists. The
primary objectives of the project, renamed Project Galileo
shortly after it was initiated, were to study the composi-
tion and physical state of Jupiter’s complex atmosphere,
to study the composition and physical state of the
satellites, and to explore the structure and physical
dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere (explained in more

detail later). Three different types of spacecraft would be
needed to carry out these requirements to the satisfac-
tion of the interested scientists. For those interested in
the structure and composition of the atmosphere, the ideal
thing would be to drop a probe directly into the at-
mosphere. Scientists concerned with the satellites or the
weather of Jupiter would prefer a three-axis stabilized plat-
form, for imaging devices, spectrometers and related
items. Finally, the people who would be doing the field
and particle studies in the magnetosphere would need a
spacecraft that spins around an axis at a constant rate,
allowing instruments such as magnetometers to sweep
through the magnetic field. Thus, very early in the pro-
gram, a “three-in-one” spacecraft design was settled
upon.

The three major components of the Galileo spacecraft
are the probe, the spun section, and the despun section.
The probe is the small detachable device that will actual-
ly plunge into the atmopshere of Jupiter, returning
valuable information about its composition and
characteristics, until its fiery death from frictional heat. The
other two components are permanently attached to one
another, and comprise the orbiter portion of the
spacecraft. pointed towards the Earth at all times will be
the large, umbrella-like, high gain antenna, mounted atop
the spun section of the orbiter. Joined to the spun sec-
tion with a complicated series of mechanical and electrical
connections is the despun half of Galileo. This will be the
first spacecraft ever with spinning and non-spinning parts.
The tasks of interfacing the two parts so that they will
reliably and smoothly operate for several years, and pass-
ing data and power lines through such an interface, prov-
ed to be major engineering hurdles.

The Galileo Probe

The entry probe will study the structure and make-up
of Jupiter’s upper atmosphere during its brief journey in-
to the clouds.

Weighing in at 335 kilograms, the probe has two parts.
The outer, saucer-shaped covering that will protect the
probe during the hottest part of the entry and help to slow
it down is called the aeroshell/heat shield. It is split into
two halves which separate after it has completed its job,
and allow the inner part of the probe, the descent module,
to continue down until its eventual demise. The aeroshell
is composed of carbon phenolic, and makes up two-thirds
of the weight of the probe. The descent module, with its
Dacron parachute, contains the six scientific experiments
that will sample the atmosphere.

For the long journey to Jupiter, the probe will be nestl-
ed in a small cavity on the despun part of the orbiter. One-
hundred and fifty days before arrival, the spacecraft will
fire its retropropulsion engines and orient itself for a
ballistic entry into Jupiter’s atmosphere. Then it will fire
the engines once more to spin up the entire spacecraft.
This maneuver spin stabilizes the probe to insure that it
follows the ballistic path exactly, for if the probe strikes
the atmosphere at too shallow an angle it will skip off into

10

space like a stone skips off the surface of a pond, or if
the angle is too steep, it will burn up immediately. Since
it has no engines of its own, the probe cannot be
recovered if it is launched incorrectly. The orbiter, pointed
correctly, and spinning, will fire pyrotechnic devices and
separate the probe to send it on its one way trip where
no man-made object has ever gone before. After the
separation maneuver, the orbiter will once again use its
engines to steer out of the ballistic path, so it does not
join the probe on its suicidal journey. The two will fly on
to Jupiter alone, until the critical final moments of the pro-
be’s existence. As the probe enters the atmosphere,
Galileo will swing around the planet and travel in a path
that is parallel to the probe’s. This is the orbiter’s closest
approach to the planet for the entire mission. The probe
will relay scientific information to the orbiter for approx-
imately one hour, until failure from overheating and ex-
treme pressure occur. If the orbiter fails to make this
rendezvous, the data from the probe will be lost. There
will be no way to find out what the probe had to tell us.

While the orbiter is preparing to receive the probe data,
the probe itself is being accelerated by Jupiter’s immense
gravitational field. It will strike the upper cloud layer at a
blistering 100,000 miles per hour. After a few minutes, it
will have slowed down to Mach 1, having experienced a
crushing 250 g deceleration. The burned aeroshel|’s up-
per half will be blown off by a mortar about two minutes
after entry, and the main parachute will deploy in the
following half-second. Four seconds later the lower half
of the aeroshell will drop away and, if the descent module
survives this far, the science will begin.

Sixty minutes later, it will be all over for the Galileo pro-
be. The orbiter, which transmitted the precious data in
real-time to Earth and stored it on tape, will continue on
its mission.

The Galileo Orbiter

The dual-spin Galileo Orbiter is the most sophisticated
interplanetary probe ever developed. Although it incor-
porates much of the technology from previous spacecraft,
such as the Pioneer and Voyager, it is the first vehicle to
integrate it all into one spacecraft.

The dominant feature of the orbiter is its five meter
diameter high gain antenna, mounted atop the spun sec-
tion. This antenna is used to transmit and receive data
over the vast distances between Jupiter and Earth, at a
rate of 134,000 bits per second. Since it is always poin-
ting towards the Earth, and therefore the Sun as well, it
serves a secondary purpose to shield the spacecraft from
solar radiation.

Below the antenna, three booms extend out from
Galileo, evenly spaced at 120 degree intervals. The
longest of the three is the eleven meter long science
boom. It spins around at 3.15 revolutions per minute while
magnetometers, p|asma—wave detectors and other ex-
periments mounted on it sample Jupiter’s magnetosphere.

THE SKINNY DIP

A store called the Skinny Dip intrigued me. I was even
more interested when I learned that they sold ice cream.
How could they use the word “skinny”?

Located at 2110 Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill, with
the clever phone number 421-DIPS, is one of the most
interesting and innovative “ice cream” stores I have ever
been to. I call it ice cream with quotes because it is made
with skim milk and only contains one-half of one percent
butterfat. So technically it cannot be called ice cream, but
frozen dietary dessert. The ice cream has a taste that is
somewhere between ice milk and ice cream.

Everyday the Skinny Dip has four flavors which are
made up fresh. They also have 32 other flavors which are
available. The fresh flavors can be made into cones or
parfaits. The other flavors can be purchased in cups. I
tasted coffee, chocolate fudge, coffee fudge and vanilla
fresh. The flavor that had the most notable taste as not
being like real ice cream was vanilla. The flavored “skin-
ny” ice cream tasted very similar to soft ice cream.

I also tasted the peanut butter fudge in a cup. The ice
cream in a cup is not as soft as the ice cream that is made
fresh daily. I thought that this was the best thing the store
had to offer. The frozen consistency made it taste more
like real ice cream. I also really enjoyed the peanut but-
ter fudge flavor. Other interesting flavors available are
Banana Royale, Banana Fudge, Creamsicle, Milky Way,
Pina Colada, Watermelon, and of course, the typical
flavors chocolate, along with all the its combinations, and
typical fruit flavors.

The Skinny Dip hands out a menu that not only includes
all of the flavors available, but also the ingredients in the
frozen dessert, calorie equivalents and exchanges, and
also nutritional information. A four-ounce cup of “skinny”
ice cream has only 70 calories. A three-and-a-half-ounce
cone without any add-ons or dips has 90 calories. The
Skinny Dip also has low-calorie fruit toppings and
chocolate for the ice cream.

Besides cones and cups of ice cream, the Skinny Dip
also carries its namesake, a chocolate-covered dietary
frozen dessert on a stick, called Skinny Dips. Skinny Dips
come in all 32 flavors. They have 90 calories. I tried
Banana Fudge, which was very good. If you like banana
popsicles and chocolate, you would probably like this.

The Skinny Dip also carries a wide variety of non-ice
cream snacks. Everything is either low-calorie, all-natural
or sugar-free. Included are tofutti, low-calorie baked goods
— such as sesame cookies, sugar-free/salt-free baked

The Skinny Dip offers its special “ice
cream” in a variety of flavors, as well
as many low calorie candies.

goods, pop corn, salad dressings, caffeine-free tea, such
as Sun-Lite Orange and Tempty Apple, spices, natural
soda, low-calorie candy, and no-calorie candy. You can
also buy cakes decorated with your specific directions.

Prices are reasonable at the Skinny Dip. Plain cones
cost either $.70, $.89, or $1 .13. Skinny Dips are $.94. They
also give baker’s dozens of everything but the candy.

The winter hours of the store are 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. They
are open seven days a week.

When I asked a regular customer, who stops in at least
once a day, why she eats so much of the Skinny Dips ice
cream, she replied that not only does she like it a lot, but
she is interested in good food and nutrition. She likes to
have a snack before she exercises for some additional
energy. A cone has the same calories as an apple, but
it is not as filling, which is what she needs before
exercising.

She likes the peanut butter the best, which I also
thought was very good. She also recommends the coffee
and coconut flavors.

Another thing she appreciates is the service. She said
that the employees are always friendly, which I must agree
with. Once, when she had an accident, they even brought
some ice cream to her house. Now, THAT is good service.

The Skinny Dip opened at the end of July, 1983, when
three former teachers, who had stopped teaching to have
kids decided to go into business. The owners are Shirley
Kahn, Arlene Stadtlander, and Gail Wedner. The first
dollar earned is framed and hangs on the wall. According
to Night Manager Michael Shore, who incidentally is a Pitt
student, the owners are hoping to eventually franchise.
Let us hope that they add a store closer to Oakland.

(1.) Tarzan (of the apes, of course!) is on one side of a
75 meter gorge. Alas, Jane is on the other side. Ingenious
as he is, Tarzan spots a hanging vine that would enable
him to swing across the gorge, so that he can be with love-
Iy Jane, who bears a remarkable resemblance to Bo
Derek. Tarzan’s muscular arms can exert a force of 1500
Newtons on the 10 meter vine. Tarzan has a mass of 85
kilograms. Find his maximum speed at the lowest point
of his swing.

(2.) There was an old lady who lived in a shoe. She had
so many children she didn’t know what to do. If every child
she had produced as many offspring as she did, she would
have too many people living in her shoe. Her shoe houses
.05 people per square foot. Unfortunately square feet are

not common. The original owner of her shoe did not have
square feet, so his shoe was not square either. The sole
is composed of an ellipse, a square and a semi-circle. The
ellipse is defined by X2 +4y2 = 10,000. The diagonal of
the square is 50  The semi-circle is defined by x2 + y2
= 25. What is the maximum amount of people who can
reside in her shoe?

(3.) You know Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, and Vixen, Com-
et, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen, and you also recall Rudolf.
Well, Rudo|f’s nose just was not bright enough and San-
ta Claus somehow got off course. He had already pass-
ed out all his toys, but fortunately he did have one Girl
Scout compass left. He calculated that he was currently
headed N26°15’E, but the magnetic declination at that
time was 7°15’W. What direction would Santa head to get
back to his palace located at the North Pole?

(4.) A group of outdoorsy engineers decided to go
backpacking in the Shawangunk Mountains. One of these
engineers decided to calculate which route will have the
least amount of work involved. Afterall they are there to
enjoy the scenery, not build their muscles with 25 kilogram
backpacks. They find that they can either go on a trail that
has a one-mile hill at an angle of 10 degrees or on another
one which is shorter by 1/4 of a mile, but its inclination is
15 degrees. Both are equally scenic. Which one has more
work involved and will consequently be avoided? How
much work will be involved?

(5.) What whole numbers n yield an (n3-n) that is divisible
by exactly two primes? (e.g. n = 3 works, 33-3 = 24 = 3x23.
n = 5 does not work, 55-5 = 120 = 5x3x23.)

NOTE: This problem appeared on the 1985 Provost Day
Competition Second Round Test.

Last lssue’s Solutions

(1) They spent eight days at the beach and 64 people
went. During those days, there were 113 hours, 38
minutes of sunlight which equals 409080 seconds.
Dividing the people by six and the seconds by 777 and
multiplying by 17 equals 95469 shells. Selling the shells
at six for seventy cents equals $11,138.09.

(2) The MacLaurin series is x-x2/2 + x3/3-x4/4 + x5/5. x = .5.
The answer is .4072917.

(3) The largest number is produced by Marie Curie
(1867-1934) and M3 (1963-1985). (Note: it was M3’s idea
to be murdered.) The number is 3610778 plus 3896555
which equals 7507333.

(4) The lE’s can make 3603600 combinations.

(5) Since there are four floors in the building, arriving
anywhere on the fourth floor constitutes arriving at the top.
Assuming the building is Benedum, you can get to the top
either by two different sets of stairs or the elevators. This
makes 27 combinations possible.

Galileo continued from page 10

The magnetosphere is a region of charged particles which
are trapped in Jupiter’s powerful magnetic field, which is
thirty times stronger than the Earth’s own magnetic field.
The Jovian magnetosphere is actually a very complex and
dynamic structure, and it is one of the primary aims of the
mission to study this region of space around the planet.

The other two booms are for the Radioisotope Ther-
moelectric Generators (RTGs). These devices provide the
electrical power to run the spacecraft by converting the
natural heat of radioactive decay into electricity. They
must be mounted on long booms so that the radiation and
heat have a minimum effect on the rest of the spacecraft.

There are a total of seven experiments mounted on the
spinning section, all of them designed to study fields and
particles. in addition to these, the spacecraft’s main
engines are mounted on the spun section. The propulsion
system, referred to officially as the Retro-Propulsion
Module (RPM), consists of one large 400 Newton engine
for trajectory change maneuvers, and two clusters of 10
Newton thrusters for attitude control. The RPM was pro-
vided to NASA by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm GmbH
from the Federal Republic of Germany.

The despun section is an electro mechanically three-
axis stabilized platform for remote sensing science, inter-
faced to the spinning section with slip rings for power
transfer and rotary transformers for data transfer. Suc-
cessfully transferring electrical signals across the inter-
face proved to be the greatest design challenge of the
project.

All four experiments mounted on the despun section re-
quire a stable platform, with two degrees of freedom, as
provided by the Galileo design. There are two spec-
trometers, a radiometer, and the solid-state CCD imag-

mg device. The CCD imaging system will undoubtedly pro-
ve to be the most popular of the Galileo experiments, for
it is the spacecraft’s eyes. A one square centimeter array
of 640,000 imaging diodes will provide resolution almost
one hundred times better than that obtainable with
Voyager. The spacecraft will return spectacularly detail-
ed images of Jupiter’s atmosphere and moons.

Also mounted on the despun section is the probe, and
the probe relay antenna which will receive the data
transmitted from the probe during its descent.

The hardware aboard Galileo is divided into five sub-
systems: Power and Pyrotechnic, Telecommunications,
Propulsion, Command and Data, and Attitude and Ar-
ticulation Control. Power and Pyrotechnic includes the
RTGs and the pyro devices used to deploy the booms,
the antenna and the probe. Telecommunications, mostly
inherited from Voyager, is composed of the antennas and
electronics necessary for command uplink from Earth, and
data downlink to Earth. The RPM is the only component
of the Propulsion subsystem.

All data transfers and commands are controlled by the
Command and Data Subsystem, which is a distributed
computer network, Ga|i|eo’s “brain.” Six 1802
microprocessors and 180 kilowords of distributed memory
are linked by data bus to the various experiments and sub-
systems of the orbiter, coordinating all of the complex ac-
tions aboard the spacecraft.

The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS)
is responsible for over thirty in-flight maneuvers that must
be performed during the mission. A 2901 processor runs
the system, using 32K word RAM and 1K ROM. The AACS
must perform flawlessly in order for the mission to be
successful.

The Jovian system has one of the harshest radiation
environments in the solar system. Delicate electronics can
be destroyed in extreme radiation, so all of the systems
use radiation hardened CMOS chips. In addition, a great
deal of shielding was added to the outside of the
spacecraft to protect it from the deadly ionizing radiation.

Galileo Mission Profile

, Galileo will be the first interplanetary spacecraft. to be
launched from the space shuttle. The shuttle booster will
carry it into earth orbit, where the crew can perform final
checks on the robot explorer to make sure everything is
alright. Galileo will be mounted to a modified upper-stage
of a General Dynamics Centaur rocket, called the Centaur-
G upper stage, to propel it out of Earth orbit. With the
payload doors of the shuttle open towards space, the
Galileo/Centaur stack will be titled up at a 45 degree angle
and then pushed off by steel springs at about 1.6 meters
per second. As the shuttle returns to Earth, the Centaur-
G will fire and send the orbiter and probe on their way
to Jupiter.

Lauch will occur on May 26, 1986 from space shuttle
mission 61-G. The crew selected for STS 61-G are com-
mander David Walker, pilot Donald Grabe, and mission
specialists John Fabian and James van Hoften. Due to
the large size and weight of the Galileo/Centaur stack,
STS 61-G will be unable to carry any other payloads into
space.

The trip to Jupiter will last over two years, and will be
relatively uneventful. The spacecraft will be “exercised”
and checked out by ground controllers at the Jet Propul-
sion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Eight months
after departure the first, and only, major trans-Jupiter
maneuver will occur. Called the heliocentric plane change,
this maneuver will adjust the plane in which the spacecraft
is moving, because Earth’s and Jupiter’s orbits do not lie
in exactly the same plane. The next major event is the
probe separation, 150 days before arrival.

orbit of lo

The action begins in August 1988, as the probe heads
for its plunge into the Jovian cloudtops. The orbiter must
perform three critical objectives within a period of about
seven hours. One of Jupiter’s most interesting satellites
is the volcanic moon lo. Unfortunately, lo orbits very close
to Jupiter and is immersed in intense radiation. To avoid
overexposure to radiation, Galileo can only make one
close fly-by of lo. However, the orbiter must fly within lo’s
orbit in order to successfully receive the the probe date.
So, the two events are set to occur in rapid succession
after arrival at Jupiter. Four and a half hours before pro-
be entry, Galileo swings past lo, coming within 1,000
kilometers of its forbidding surface. As the probe enters
the upper cloud layer, Galileo moves in closer to Jupiter.
The aeroshell of the probe drops away, and with the or-
biter only 230,000 kilometers away, data relay begins. One
hour later the probe has completed its mission and the
orbiter has another half hour before the next critical
maneuver, a 46 minute burn of the 400-N engine which
places the spacecraft in orbit.

Once in orbit, the “tour” begins. For the next twenty
months Galileo will complete twelve orbits of Jupiter and
flyby the remaining three Galileo satellites several times.
The spacecraft’s orbits will not be uniform, but instead will
vary considerably so each one includes a close encounter
with one of the satellites. Changes in orbital shape are
accomplished using a technique known as Gravity
Assisted Delta-V. Galileo will essentially be involved in a
game of celestial billiards, where the gravitational forces
of each satellite encounter are used to alter the
spacecraft’s velocity vector and set it up for the next en-
counter. In this manner, the orbiter will be bounced around
in its orbit without using much fuel on retro-rocket firings.

After about twelve orbits, the RTGs will have expend-
ed their energy and the RPM will be out of fuel. Galileo,
the first man-made object to take us residence around one
of the outer planets, will be doomed to plummet into the
atmosphere which it will have studied so diligently for
almost two years.

The mission will be over, but the data will keep scien-
tists busy for many more years to come.

pulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, for

News from NSBE

The University of Pittsburgh Chapter of the National
Society of Black Engineers co-hosted their Region II Fall
Conference with the Carnegie Mellon University Chapter
on November 8, 9 and 10. The theme for the conference
was “Retention, Professionalism, and Growth.” Over 240
students from 21 schools and representatives from 30 cor-
porations participated in the conference. (Region II is one
of six regions throughout the country and consists of 21
school from six states.)

Pitt and CMU planned one of the best regional con-
ferences. Dr. Karl H. Lewis, CE Professor, Director of PEI-
P and advisor to Pitt’s chapter of NSBE, welcomed NSBE
members to Pittsburgh at the opening session that was
held in the University Inn. Dr. Y.T. Shah, interim dean of
Pitt’s Engineering School, also welcomed Region II at the
NSBE Banquet that was held in the WPU Ballroom. Dean
Shah also briefly discussed the need to solve the problem
of retention. The activities that were planned included a
corporate reception, four workshops, a career fair, the
NSBE Banquet, reports from each chapter, program shar-
ing among the different schools, several meetings, and
a Region II Gala — “Saturday Evening at the Club.” The
Gala was held at Racquetball One.

This conference brought together all chapters in Region
II for the purpose of exchanging ideas that will further
solidify the region and to discuss deficiencies and
academic barriers which work against student retention.

Computer Lab Expansion

Over the summer the mlcrolab on the tenth floor under-
went minor construction. The wall separating the two
microlabs was removed so that all the microcomputers
could be accessible to an Pitt engineering students
throughout the entire day. Currently, the microlab has 60
IBM personal computers (PC’s) on the tenth floor.

In addition to the microlab on the tenth floor, an autocad
lab is also in the works. The autocad lab (CAD — com-
puter aided design) will hopefully be implemented
sometime during the winter term The autocad lab will be
a separate computer facility that will be housed opposite
the Mechanical Engineering Office on the sixth floor. This
lab is being sponsored entirely by the School of Engineer-
ing, and it will be specifically for the use of Pitt engineer-
ing students. The autocad lab will consist of 20 IBM AT
computers. As one of the |BM’s latest models, the AT has
enhanced graphics; the screen will consist of 640x350
lines versus the existing PC’s with 320x200 lines. The AT
is faster than the existing PC’s and also has a wide selec-
tion of colors that are even more briliant, unlike many of
the PC’s which have only black and green screens. Also,
the autocad lab will have plotters and digitalizers to in-
crease the kinds of graphics that can be done.

Although there is also a mlcrolab on the fifth floor, there
is a proposal to expand this lab as well. The University
Computer Center is contemplating the idea of funding a
project that will expand the fifth floor microlab to hold
80-100 microcomputers. To facilitate this expansion, a wall
will also need to be removed to increase the size of the
present lab. The expanded fifth floor microlab is available
to all Pitt students. Another tentative proposal is to create
16 work stations for CAM (computer aided manufactur-
ing) use. Details such as location and type of computer
are unknown at this time.

SWE Plans Activities

The Society of Women Engineers kicked off the new
term with a membership drive. Each member was asked
to bring a friend to the first meeting to make SWE even
stronger. Regular meetings are held on Fridays at noon
in 424 BEH, and to accommodate those who can’t attend
the regular meetings there is a meeting every other Tues-
day in the SWE office.

Some of the activities planned for the coming term in-
clude a high school conference, a panel discussion, a day
on campus for transfer students from branch campuses,
and a seminar series for professional and personal
development. The SWE office is in 125 BEH, and men
are also invited to join the group. If you want to know more
about what is going on with SWE stop by the office
sometime or attend one of their meetings.

Engineer’s Week Plans

The Engineer’s Week Planning Committee has been
hard at work planning this year’s Engineers’ Week. A lot
is already underway, and with this year’s theme being
Time Eras it should prove to be lots of fun and excitement.
In accordance with thetheme the following departments
have chosen the following time eras:

Chemicals — the ’60s
Civils — the ’20s
Electricals — the medieval era
Freshmen — the ancient Grecian era
lndustrials —— the ’40s
Mechanicals — the ’50s
Metallurgicals —- the future

Freshmen Receive Advice

Something new this year in the School of Engineering
is the Freshman Advisory Committee. It was begun by
Janice Walker, Lori Schuff, and the Engineering Student
Cabinet, as a way to help the freshmen decide what
department they want to enter. Juniors and seniors in each
department are the advisers. As advisor spends about two
hours a week helping a freshman by showing them around
their department, and they even may take freshmen to one
of their classes. Each week the advisers meet a new group
of freshmen to show around. The advising is on a one-to-
one basis, and a freshman may visit as many departments
as they wish. If you’re interested in learning more about
this program contact Janice Welker in the ESC office at
