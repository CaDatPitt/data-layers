as such, is really not as important as the extremists’
reaction and response in a given situation. Not only
do the males, any man in this case, not listen to what
the militant feminists have to say, but a good many
women are completely turned-off by their crude pre-
sentation of their ideas of the “role of women.” In es-
sence, they are defeating their own purpose, thereby
undoing whatever progress people like Ms. Fitz-
patrick has made. Her article is clearly for “women’s
lib.” It is obviously not written from the militant’s
viewpoint, and yet she was able to convey her ideas
in an intelligent manner while still maintaining her
femininity. That in itself is valid. It’s merely saying:

I AM A PERSON; I AM A
WOMAN.

A woman is entitled to equality, i.e.-, to be mar-
lried but to choose not to have children; to remain
single but to choose to have or adopt a baby, etc. But
in making these decisions, she must never be made
to feel less than or beneath the woman who is mar-
ried and has ten kids, or the pregnant, single girl who
is pressured into marrying not the man of her choice
but the father of her baby. A woman must be free to
choose the kind of life style she wants but in doing
so, the old-fashioned “but it’s a woman’s duty to bear
children in a marriage” should NOT be shoved down
her throat.

These are merely a few freedoms that today’s
women are striving for. So, if the “wasted energies”
which Ms. Fitzpatrick spoke of could be focused or
geared toward helping people — women AND men
— understand the “now” situation / plight of
women, then perhaps many more would be for
“women’s lib,” thereby strongly supporting it, instead
of being given reasons to be violently opposed and
retarding the progress.

Recently I sent a copy of your article that was
published in the October 1971 Skyscraper Engineer
to a friend whom I consider a true feminist.

Enclosed is a copy of her reply, your article with
appropriate comments. I suggest you read these
comments and then do a frank evaluation of your
article. Perhaps a partial retraction is in order.

How to call _

A buff will probably tell you you’ve got to drop
a bundle to get a really great stereo system.

Nonsense.

Stereo is all in the ear. it's how it sounds,
not how it costs, that makes a stereo system
great.

So next time some buff hands you that old line
call his bluff. See if he can figure out how much
you paid for your Sylvania matched component
stereo system. Just by listening.

Pick yourfavorite record. Put it      . .
on the BSR micro-mini turntable.
(|ftape’syourthing, slip one into
the 8-track cartridge playback.)

Then balance the bass and
treble on the FM stereo

Your buff won’t have a chance. He'll stand
there, surrounded by sound, completely bluffed.
Trying like crazy to figure out how much you laid
out for a stereo that sounds that great.

Solving the mysteries of molding with mathematics.

Even though plastics have been
around for many years, there’s still a lot
to be learned about these versatile mate-
rials and their processing. So they are the
subject for continuing studies by our
engineers.

Some of their recent investigations
have brought forth new and highly Useful
information about a relatively unexplored
area: the melting behavior of plastics in
the injection molding process.

One result of these studies is the
mathematical formula, or model, above.

The model helps us predict melting
behavior along the length of the injection
screw molding machine used to mold tele-
phone housings and other parts. Melting
behavior is extremely important, because
plastic pellets should be completely
melted but not thennally decomposed
before injection into the mold.

This information on melting is then
used to investigate screw designs, operat-
ing conditions, machine sizes and plastic
properties. All of which is aimed at ob-
taining optimum processing techniques.

Predictions obtained from the mathe-
matical model have checked out closely

with experimental observations. So the
resulting screw designs are now under-
going evaluation by engineers at our
plants in Indianapolis and Shreveport.
Conclusion: For new designs and
materials, the model can help reduce the
development cost for new molded parts
and materials. For manufacturing current
products, operating costs can be reduced.
Perhaps most signiﬁcant is that we’re
getting information about molding tem-
peratures not available experimentally.
And many other types of information can
be obtained without the use of costly,
time—consuming experimental work.
The end result will be more efficient
plastic molding and therefore a better
product for the lowest possible cost.

Engineering Student Cabinet this year stands
out as a model for effective student government.
Through mature and realistic communication
between our student government representatives,
the faculty, faculty committees, and deans, meaning-
ful improvement has been made in the School of
Engineering.

Many faculty committees have a student
representative, supplied by the Student Cabinet.
The Standing Committee on Undergraduate Pro-
grams (SCUP), and Engineering Undergraduate
Administration Committee (EUAC) are the two most
important committees affecting undergraduate
education. Ron Gronsky student SCUP representa-
tive and Wayne Williams have provided new ‘inputs
into their committees and have been instrumental in
changes such as the SU option, and changes in the
humanities and social sciences options in the first
two years. These are only a few areas they have been
affective in.

Engineer’s Week should be greatly improved
this year. The Central Planning Committee chaired
by Andy Cornelius, has gone to the students to find
out what they think Engineers’ Week should be.
Because of the feedback they got, they have tried to
put more fun and less competition into the activities.
Rumor has it that they have contracted the “Fifth
Dimension” to play at the Engineers’ Ball at
Churchill Country Club.

A most significant example of the extra effort
b'eing put forth by the Student Cabinet is the
Engineering Course Evaluation. Engineers could sit
back and let the University Course evaluation pole
their classes, but they haven’t. A small volunteer
committee made up of Dante Romito, Robert Miller,
Susan Suehr, Gene Heckman and Wayne Williams
has made up its own form which does a better job of
evaluating engineering courses. They will be distri-
buting the course evaluation forms at the end of this
semester and we hope to print the results in our next
ISSUC.

The Student Cabinet is also working on a
“White Paper” for the Board of Visitors, making sur-
veys and recomentations for the outfitting of the
student lounge and, providing feedback on the suit-

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—DECEMBEF\’, I971

ability of the Bevier Library. From the beginning of

the year when Chuck Norrish and company
organized the engineering freshman orientation to
the end of the year when the Student Cabinet pre-
sents the outstanding senior award, the whole nature
of engineering education, social life and activities
have a special slant, custommade features for
engineering students, — by engineering students.

These activities have been coordinated and
assisted by Dennis Yeskey, President of Engineering
Student Cabinet. He has done an outstanding job in
helping the committees to achieve their goals and he
has directed concise and useful Student Cabinet
meetings.

What’s the real nitty-grity of why the student
government is so effective this year. How can it be
ensured of continued effectiveness? Ron Gronsky,
Vice President of Student Cabinet, gave his opinion
to this inquisitive reporter. Ron said that there are
more students active this year who have good friends
in the faculty, students who have worked in student
government and with the faculty for a couple of
years. They know what can and how it can be done.
Programs weren’t started from scratch this fall. They
were carried over from last year. Students are more
practical now, more willing to work through the sys-
tem.

He said that the most important thing to be done
to continue the effectiveness of student government
is to continually draw freshmen and sophomores into
student-faculty committees. After their apprentice-
ship they will be able to provide continuity to student
government. It is essential that we don’t start from
zero every year.

Apart from the fact that the Engineering Stu-
dent Cabinet pays some of the “Skyscraper’s” bills,
these guys deserve acknowledgement for the great
job they are doing. Students should be aware that if
they have any ideas for the school or any gripes that
they should go to their Cabinet representative. The
Cabinet is the only channel through which to get
things done. They have proven they can do the job.

by e. a. solcm

The following article by Elaine A. Solan, co-editor of
the Pitt Capsule, presents an objective view of the
drug marijuana. The staff of the SK YSCRAPER
takes no stand for or against the use of this drug, but
recognizes that as members of the University com-
munity our readers will be confronted with its use in
one way or another. To this end we feel that it is our
duty to provide the following information.

 
Marijuana from the distant past

Cannabis, in its many forms, has remained with
man from his beginning. As early as 2000 B.C. the
Chinese called hashish the “delight giver.” By the
2nd century before Christ, in China, it was known as
“Ma” (a word meaning God), and was being pres-
cribed for gout, rheumatism, malaria, beriberi,
weakness, constipation, and absentmindedness. The
Hindus worshipped the plant and, like the Chinese,
gave it a name of praise — “soother of grief.” Even
Galen, the Greek who lived in the second century
A.D., is reported to have said that at Roman ban-

14

quets the host often gave the flowers of Cannabis to
the guests as a promoter of joy. And so the course of
marijuana history was established — a past that was
to continue until the last few centuries when its use
‘became known to the peoples of America. Jazz
musicians, being the first fairly large and publicly
known group of marijuana users .in the United States
(next to a number of 19th century Americans like
George Washington who even grew the plant in his
yard), believed that it helped them to quicken and
keep beat. But in 1920’s marijuana usage remained
only among the periphery of American society — a
situation which prevailed almost to this present day.

Around the world in the jargon of grass

The term “marijuana” is the one most often
used in the United States to mean any preparation or
extract of the Cannibas plant, viz., Cannabis sativa.
The word comes from the Portuguese expression
“mariguano” meaning intoxicant. But the term
“marijuana” is only one of many used to describe any
creation of the ancient Cannabis weed. Its names
range from the more common ones like pot (a

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER—DECEMBER, 1971

dichotomy of marzjuana

shortened form of a Mexican-Spanish term
“potiguaya” meaning crude marijuana), grass, Texas
tea, Mary Jane, Acapulco gold, or hash (hashish) to
the lesser known expressions such as Indian hay,
boo, gage, weed, or smoke. The completely outdated
names for marijuana are especially interesting and
somewhat amusing — a few of these names are:
rnuggles, goof-butts, griffo, greeters, mooters, gates,
joystick, jive, and giggle-smoke. Most of these
expressions are used almost exclusively in the area of
the United States and surrounding countries, but all
over the world Cannibis preparations are known to
man.

The peoples of Africa apply the term “dagga” to
their Cannabis concoction, while Middle Eastern
groups have coined the term “hashish.” In these two
areas, as in all parts of the world, unusual and
interesting preparations using Cannabis are made.
One unusual dish ‘is a candy called “majoon” which
contains a product of Cannabis — this is a candy
especially prepared in North Africa. In the northwest
African nation of Morocco, people smoke their “kif”
— the ordinary user there smokes from 20 to 30
pipes of kif daily. With their hashish, the inhabitants
of Middle Eastern countries generally prepare one of

two concoctions. Either the hashish is powered for-

smoking (as is often done here in the U.S.), or it is
mixed with a mucilage of sorts to form pastilles
which are then smoked in pipes or eaten with a
spoon.

Preparations similar to these just mentioned are
made in South America where the people use what
they call maconha” or “djamba,” their form of
Cannabis.

Perhaps the more commonly used expressions,
although foreign, are those used in Central Asia and
in -India. Central Asians have the term “charas”
which means an extract of Cannabis. It has been said
that :‘comparing the effects of marijuana to those of
hashish or charas is like comparing a light wine to
brandy, or a mild beer to 90 proof whiskey.” “Ganja”
is an Indian expression for an extract similar in effect
and strength to hash and charas. Ganja is supposed
to  5 to 8 times stronger than United States
marijuana. Ganja is sold by the Indians as an
aphrodisiac when it is mixed with other ingredients,
principally with spices like cloves and cinnamon,
with amber (a fossil resin), and with musk (a sub-
stance secreted in a glandular sac under the
abdomen of the male musk deer, having a strong
0_d0_I‘). l3hang, the Indian verbalism for an extract
similar in strength to marijuana, is prepared by tak-
ing the leaves and other parts of the Cannabis plant
and chopping them up to the desired consistency. If

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—-DECEMBER, ‘I971

this mass is rolled in a tobacco leaf, it is known as a
bhang cigarette (just like the joint or reefer known to
the peoples of the Western world). Peculiar to India
is another preparation of bhang made by steeping
the chopped plant until the intoxicant is freed from
the fibers leaving liquid bhang — this is drunk as a
glass of beer.

Back in the United States the joint, the
marijuana cigarette, is the most common form of
Cannabis. Also in the U.S. marijuana can be mixed
with food. One hippie newspaper suggests that
marijuana be incorporated into a well-known cookie
mix so that the user can turn on in public with a nary
a raised eyebrow.

Although not directly connected with the ‘jar-
gon of grass,’ dosage of Cannabis in various countries
is noteworthy. The average marijuana cigarette con-
tains about 0.5 gr. of active constituent, and a regular
user in the U.S. is defined as one who smokes 2 or 3
joints 3 to 4 times weekly —— an average of about 3 to
6 grs. Interestingly enough 46 per cent of charas and
ganja smokers consume greater than 80 grs. daily. A
rather high dose is taken by Moroccans as was men-
tioned earlier (20 to 30 pipes daily). These unusually
high dosages have never known to cause any great
harm to these people. Marijuana’s true effect is hard
to determine, however, due to the short lifespan and
the various other conditions which may play an
important role in the shortening of their years.
Perhaps some indication of the long-term, high-
dosage use of Cannabis in these countries can be
seen from this Moroccan folk-saying: “Kif is like fire,
a little warms, a lot burns.”

The faces of “pot” . . . as an aphrodisiac

The old cry used to be that the drug was an
aphrodisiac. Time distortion is said to be one
explanation for marijuana’s reputation as a means of
exciting sexual desire. The sexual act seems to last
for a half hour or more when the time is actually only
minutes. The correct terminology now is that the
drug is an inhibition-releasing drug which often
reduces self-inhibition and group-inhibition to levels
below socially accepted behavior. No evidence,
though, based on a number of reputable studies,
exists to date that marijuana leads to sexual
promiscuity.

. . . asahallucinogen

“A group of drugs which has achieved
prominence in recent years is the type which has
has been shown to affect the mind in rather bizarre
fashions.

Because they are capable of distorting images and
producing hallucinations, these drugs are generally

15

mary jcme . . . .

referred to as ‘hallucinogens.’ Medical literature
more frequently calls them ‘psychotogens’ or
‘psychotomimetics’ whereas a newer term,
‘psychedelic,’ has been coined to describe the effects
of these drugs. The term psychedellc 1S dﬁflfled 35
‘mind-manifesting’ and pertains to those drugs whose
actions seem to expand the consciousness and
enlarge the vision.” Of the above described drugs,
LSD and marijuana represent the largest entrees
under this classification. Marijuana is milder than
most other hallucinogens and many authorities
believe it to be less dangerous. For example, unlike

the LSD trip, the marijuana “high” does not take,

over totally; the individual participates more direct-
ly, and voluntarily, in the experience.
. as an introduction to heroin

A very typical and common argument against
the use of marijuana is that it is a catalyst to heroin
addiction. A three-year study conducted by two
knowledgeable sociologists concluded that there is
“no evidence that marijuana leads to the use of
stronger drugs. . . . Dr. James H. Fox, director of
the U.S. Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, reports that
“ . . . marijuana does not lead to degenera-
tion . . .and does not lead to heroin addiction.” It is
true, though, that among those who are seriously dis-
turbed emotionally or socially, i.e., those who may
also have other personality problems and interper-
sonal situations, are those who seek to break all ties,
all restraints. These are among the individuals who
are led to heroin, to LSD, or to methedrine — per-
haps through marijuana. But, for the stable-minded
person, marijuana is not the first step to heroin. One
doctor remarked that “one might say that because

16

most users of heroin once imbibed milk, milk leads
to heroin addiction.”

Grass on the rocks

A great many proponents of marijuana, when
asked to justify their defense of the drug, call to
mind the parallel, or rather the lack of a parallel,
between marijuana and alcohol — the minimal
danger of marijuana consumption vs. the potential
and real harm of alcohol addiction.

It must be conceded that, at present, the percen-
tage of those who drop out of society or commit
antisocial acts as a result of smoking pot is far less
than of those who become problem drinkers or con-
firmed drunkards by turning to alcohol. According
to the author of a book entitled “Pot,” marijuana is
like liquor in one important aspect: it is a pressure
reliever. That is, both can relieve pressures, whether
they be social, racial, domestic, military, political, by
lowering inhibitions and by supplying a carefreeness
and artificial (or drug induced) happiness. But there
the similarity ends for marijuana is a hallucinogen —
a drug that ‘turns you on’ — while alcohol is a
depressant on the CNS — it ‘turns you off!” Alcohol
can kill, but one can turn on daily with marijuana
and never be in any physical danger. And when
smoking desire tapers off, or stops, one can still
experience great happiness, great passion, great
thoughts, great whatsoever.

The use of marijuana per se would probably be
no more indicative of an abnormality in a person
than the use of alcohol. However, there is one
important difference, although artificial, between
the two, and that is the illegality of the use of mari-
juana. One author of a book on marijuana asks, “But
would we have looked at every person who took a
drink during the years between 1920 and 1933, in
defiance of the Volstead Act, as a criminal? With all
due respect for the law in general, I dare say no.”

Dr. James Goddard, past FDA administrator, is
quoted as saying that marijuana is no more harmful
than alcohol, and that “society should be able to
accept alcohol and marijuana. I don’t think we
should be making felons out of our college students.”
Following Dr. Goddard’s line of thinking, a doctor
asks, “How can you expect the young people today
to respect authorities who will ruin a person’s life for
possesion of marijuana or put a man in jail for using
a drug with the abuse potential of a cocktail?”

The good of marijuana . . .

There is no question that many of the nation’s
leading personalities and intellectuals are not only
using marijuana themselves, but are openly advocat-
ing its use, insisting that most of the stories about its

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—DECEMBER. ‘I971

-31*

effects are wholly or grossly exagerated and
demanding repeal of anti-marijuana laws. One such
well-known individual is Allen Ginsberg, prize-
winning poet and occasional user. He says:

Marijuana is a useful catalyst for specific optical
and aural aesthetic perceptions. I appreciated
the structure of certain pieces of classical and
jazz music in a new manner under the influence
of marijuana, and these apprehensions have
remained valid in years of normal concious-
ness . . . These perceptions are permanent;
any deep aesthetic experience leaves a trace.
These are deepened perceptions that one might
have catalysed by some other natural
event . . . The conciousness shifts, ever so
gently, from habitual, sallow, purely verbal
guideline to a more direct, absorbing engage-
ment with sensing phenomena. I take evidence
of my own senses, between my awarennss of the
mysterious universe of joy, pain, discovery,
birth and death . . . the cheap abstract,
inexperienced version of which one read about
in the newspapers.

This testimony is the claim of a moderate user of
marijuana, a claim based not on excess or abuse, but
on moderation, a claim distinguishing between use
and abuse. Psychiatrists say that marijuana has
mildly intoxicating qualities but virtually never
leaves permanent damage, certainly not to the
average users of moderate amounts. The author of
the book “Pot” remarks that

. smoking of marijuana is not an all-con-
suming passion, as is opiate taking, which leads
to addiction. The high is not a bottomless abyss
but a pleasant valley. Most people still do not
understand there is no physical need for mari-
juana. One can, and does, master his relation-
ship with the drug. Man is the master in charge,
and will remain so in spite of the attractive
world he sees when high on the drug. It is some-
times difficult for a man to accept that respon-
sibility.

The real truth about the casual and episodic use
of marijuana is revealed in talking to smokers and
other users of the drug. The truth itself is the
apparently almost universal need for comradeship,
for communication with others, friendship, associa-
tion, the interplay of ideas, feelings, emotion, of
sharing, of belonging. According to a comment by
one smoker, “Mostly what you want, and what you
really find, in pot is simply to relax — to find
peace . . .”

‘The words of the author of a recent book on
marijuana sum up the desirable effects of the

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-DECEMBER.197‘l

Cannabis weed: “Pot puts the artist in touch with his
unconscious, permitting him to explore truth about
himself which his ego has kept hidden. Even the
audience is expanding its conscious by becoming
more involved in the art. Marijuana is an important
catalyst in this evolutionary change.”

. and the evil

It is irrefutably true that there are some people
who can use marijuana moderately, and for pro-
tracted periods of time without ill effects of a serious
character. Grave results can be detected, though,
almost always with the unstable, disturbed
individual. Although no physical dependence at all
upon marijuana exists, the danger lies in a definite
probability of psychic dependence. “The combina-
tion of the effects of the drug plus psychic depen-
dence may lead to extreme lethargy, indolence,
neglect, of personal hygiene and a preoccupation
with the drug that precludes constructive activity. In
addition, there appears to be a casual relationship
developing between the chronic use of hallucinogens
and the impairment of both memory and intellec-
tuals functioning.”

With the undisturbed, normal individual, mari-
juana is rarely a serious threat if used in moderation.
It has been said that the smoking of the leaves,
flowers, and seeds of Cannabis sativa is no more
harmful than the smoking of tobacco or mulletin or
sumac leaves. The main objection, though, to even a
noncontinuous use of the drug is that man knows so
little about its continuingpﬂsocial and psychological
effects. People are all different and so different
people react in different ways to the drug. The lack
of carefully controlled and checked research on this
key question of reaction to marijuana presents a very
serious informational gap. The great disadvantage to
the true assessment of marijuana, then, is the ignor-
ance which surrounds it.

The end; only a beginning

Throughout its 5100 years of use, Cannabis
sativa has been at the center of controversy. No
middle ground, however, has ever existed or does
exist today in dispute — one is simply either for it or
against it. The issue of marijuana is personal,
immediate, emotional.

FLOWERS OF ZINC guard steel

against rust for 20 years and more

The myriad of shining zinc “petals,” which galvanizing
deposits on steel, form both a shield and an “electric
fence" against rust. E The layer of zinc protects first as
a mechanical barrier which completely covers the steel
to seal out corrosion’s attack. Zinc’s secondary defense
is called upon when the protective coating is scratched,
gouged or worn through to the steel itself. Then, an
electrochemical current of galvanic action fences these
gaps and the zinc slowly sacrifices itself as it continues
to protect the steel. This action takes place because, in
the galvanic series, zinc is less noble than steel and will
corrode sacrificially . . . fighting a stubborn delaying ac-
tion against corrosion’s attack. E] No other material pro-
vides the combination of strength, corrosion-resistance
and economy found in galvanized steel. That's why it's

The recent criticism of our technological world
as being ugly and dehumanizing resulted in an
expected defensive reaction on my part. I would like
the opportunity to provide a rebuttal.

In the article by George Nelson (Design, Tech-
nology and the Pursuit of Ugliness, S. R., October 2,
1971), Mr. Nelson stated that the engineer was the
first designer whose concern was with things rather
than with people. He stated that the impersonality of
the engineering design process and the dehuman-
izing objectives of business and industry were rea-
sons for engineers having defaced more landscapes
than other people. Nelson also stated that the
environment was too precious a resource to be left in
the hands of the engineers. I challenge most of his
observations, but these three are at best absurd.

The engineer in his more recent role, that is, his
more visible role since the industrial revolution has
been deeply concerned with people. His problem of
concern with things comes from his task of providing
things for others. Identifying engineers solely with
their concern for things and hardware is as unjus-
tified as identifying Albert Schweitzer solely with his
general medical practice. Our society has become so
complex that simplistic relationships between
individual human needs and their satisfaction are not
direct. Fortunately we have engineers whose educa-
tion and professional purpose is to design for the
complex system which will provide for human needs.

The engineer has been a faithful servant for
society in providing people with leisure time, food,
clothing, transportation, and a safer environment.
The impersonality of the engineer, I will admit, but
this impersonality in his design objectives allows him
to give every man a home, not one man or one
woman a Taj Mahal. In providing for many people,
large changes must be made in our landscapes and
large quantities of material and energy must be used.
Again it is fortunate that the engineer is capable of
making these changes, or we would be experiencing
malnutrition, disastrous floods, illiteracy and dis-
ease.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-DECEMBER, 1971

dr. e. b. Stuart

Certainly our environment must be improved
and it must be improved markedly for our survival.
But, it has been the engineer who has provided
millions with an opportunity for more than bare sur-
vival. It is the engineer whose education and exper-
ience can make the changes that are necessary for us
to survive in future as he has done in the past. I get
awfully tired of hearing people vent their spleens by
criticizing technology because it is visible, when the
real cause for the problems we have is simply a large
population. It is delightful to consider a Walden-like
environment. But it is a fantasy to expect a Walden
when the population density is anything near that of
our central cities or even the suburbs.

One of the more accurate criticisms of
engineers is his being all too willing to give them
what they want. Traditionally, engineers have been
concerned with guarding the public safety, but act-
ing for the best interests of his client. If the public
and his immediate client wanted large, fast auto-
mobiles, the engineer was committed to designing
them in the best way possible. The engineers, their
courage, foresight, was usually punished by public
criticism. There are still communities in this well
developed country that resist the engineeer when he
tries to provide them with a sewage collection and
treatment system. These communities would rather
risk a typhoid epidemic than have their traditional
way of life invaded by technology. The public’s
demand for more and faster automobiles left the
engineer with the only alternative of building wider,
safer highways. Although the death rate from high-
way accidents is 50,000 citizen groups are still resist-
ing highway building projects which would help to
minimize this slaughter. Parenthetically, I was much
more concerned when my son received his driver’s
license than when he received his draft card.

Our population increases coupled with our
urbanization will surely lead us to a grimy, dismal
disaster unless the engineer is given the leadership
role- in shaping our environment. Our environment

Each Saturday night The New York Times
wraps up the news.

Then FMC wraps up The New York Times.

Thanks to a mechanized system we de-
signed, built, and installed, the country’s
largest Sunday edition is mailed the world
over, carefully protected from the elements
by a see-through wrapper.

This is just one of many unusual jobs
taken in stride by FMC.

If you want to carry it, warehouse it, pack-
age it, or whatever, chances are FMC has
handled a similar job.

You may still recall by tomorrow that we’re
into machinery; but how in the world can we
get you to remember that we’re also a very
largechemical company, too?

Or that we are a major factor in alleviating
the world’s food problems through our
involvement in every phase of agriculture:
pumps and irrigation systems, pesticides and
fertilizers, food processing and packaging
equipment, even seeds.

Or that we’re one of the country’s largest
producers of rayon, acetate, and polyester
ﬁbers.

Or that we even make sewage treatment
equipment, ﬁre engines and railcars.

Being a diversiﬁed company means it’s
hard to have one all-encompassing image.
But it does give our people an unusual variety
of ways to improve man’s welfare.

A DIFFERENT TOUR OF INDIA
H. E. Hoelscher

Most Americans think of India, if at all, from
mixed exotic images of poverty, strangely dressed
and turbaned men and women, naked children,
snake charmers, Ganges bathers, elephants, cows
and cow dung, spices and an overall aura of
pagentry. Surely no other country is more thorough-
ly misunderstood, so poorly, so inadequately and so
inaccurately described to the people of America.
Not even our own! The daily press, magazines, tele-
vision and movies do a simply terrible job of portray-
ing the vast subcontinent which we call India.

I write as one American who has traveled exten-
sively through India once or twice each year for the
past 15 years. My family and I lived there for a year
and I lived there alone for an almost equal length of
time. It is a fascinating country, beautiful and kindly
to the reasonable traveler, a country laden with
obvious opportunities for the future beneath a bleak
surface of present problems. It is an easy country to
love.

The “normal” American tourist pattern, a
pattern which usually leads to articles for hometown
papers or a journal, involves a stop in Bombay, a
little time in the nation’s capital, New Delhi, and a
visit to Calcutta. This takes the traveler across the
top of India and into its three major cities. He
usually then assumes that he has had a representative
view of India and feels quite jusitified in passing
along experiences and impressions gathered along
the way. Unfortunately, the conclusion is no more
valid than the opinion of an Australian out-back far-
mer about the United States if his only exposure to
our country were a weekend in the heart of Broad-
way, a frantic weekend of theater, nightclubs and
New York revelry.

Bombay, Delhi and Calcutta are three very
different cities, different in their structure, in
their purpose but, more particularly, in their
atmosphere. Bombay and Calcutta are large
commercial seaports, but there similarity
ends. Bombay has much of the charm and many
of the characteristics of San Francisco

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—DECEMBER, ‘I971

while Calcutta is a nightmare place, an un-
believable anthill which seems to have been
squashed flat until its normal third dimension, its
once certain height during British rule, has gone.
The vast majority of people scurry about upon a
dreary level amid ubiquitious rubble, without a
future. Delhi is a large and sprawling typical nation’s
capital, beautifully laid out and completely func-
tional for that pervasive bureaucracy which is India
today.

But I will not take you through these cities.
Although they are interesting and deserving of a
better treatment than they have yet received in the
public press or travelogues, there is another route to
travel, not well known, not yet reported, more start-
ling and much more India than these cities.

We will start in Bombay, a convenient place to
enter India. We will then head south along a trail not
used by “normal” tourists. For this account, I will not
dwell on language problems of governing that vast
and sprawling country. I will tell instead of people
and of places. I will try to interest you in an India
which I have seen and find compellingly attractive,
along a different route.

We land at Santa Cruz Airport north of Bombay
and, thus, we miss the delight of a seaward landing.
Travel by sea to India in more leisurely times
brought the passenger through the “Gateway of
India” (1,2) on Apollo Bunder, an arch erected to
commemorate the landing of King George V and
Queen Mary in 1911. Behind the Gateway stands the
Taj Mahal Hotel, (3) one of the great remaining
houses of our world. It is now being modernized and
is only partially today as shown several years
ago. But the “old” part remains, the “remodeling”
has simply added on a wing, a modern wing but not a
violation to the structure. The unique quality of ser-
vice and friendliness, the spacious of interior and
rooms, and charming mix of West and East has not
been changed. The food is just superb — all of it —
but the Karimboi salad in the first floor lounge
would, by itself, make the trip worthwhile. I predict
that many travelers will continue regularly their pil-
grimages to the Taj; a stay there should not be
missed.

23

There is much to see in Bombay. The view
from Malabar Hill, the Gardens, the Parsi Towers of
Silence, Elephanta Cave on Elephanta Island in the
Bay and many remnants of the British Raj are all
worthwhile. But these have, at least to some extent,
been treated in other accounts and cannot be my
focus. We move on south.

We travel by car. For much of our route both
train and plane travel is not available. It would, in
any case, prevent many important side trips while
denying appreciation of the countryside and people.
Travel by car presents some problems but will prove
worth the effort. However, it is well we have an
English-speaking Indian driver with us.

From Bombay we go to Poona along a pleasant
and well-traveled road. Poona is a hill station, a few
hours drive from Bombay. It was a British Canton-
ment area whose chief attraction, its altitude and
climate, make it still today a popular place to go in
summer to escape, first, the sauna heat of Bombay
and then the Turkish Bath that that city becomes for
several months. There are a number of good hotels
in Poona, the Wellesley and the Napiers being two of
these, and there are any number of rest houses, pri-
vate homes and the ever-present Dak Bungalows
available to the tourists at little, if any, cost.

I should say a word about Dak Bungalows.
These are government-sponsored and maintained
houses, scattered throughout the country for the use
of tourists. They can usually be reserved in one town
for arrival in the next. Often they can be secured
upon arrival. They are almost bare, with simple cots,
a table and chairs. The travelers carry their own
bedding, sleeping bags and make arrangements with
some local person to cook and provide food. The
American tourist using the Dak Bungalows should be
accompanied by an Indian who knows the ropes.
They are not uncomfortable, but they are conven-
ient.

There are several universities in Poona, several
medical schools, a first-rate museum housing parts of
India's past and a now rapidly developing array of
industries of various kinds. One could and should
spend time in Poona to make excursions into the
surrounding countryside, to visit caves that were
once temples 2,000 years ago or more, to visit holy
sites and ancient forts from Muslim days and picnic
amid delightful scenes of hills and valleys in the
region. However, once again, there is more yet to
see, even more exciting things, and we go south.

From Poona the road becomes a narrow, two-
lane, blacktop through the villages and farms of an
agricultural region. The motorist is in no danger
from other motorists; the competition is from the
sheep, goats, chickens and small children on the
road. Progress is slow but interesting.

' Recent agricultural successes in the country are
evident in lush fields, the beginnings of an agro-
industrial system of large farms and a nearly modern
look to farming in the area.

24

We pass through many towns, some large, some
small. and 300 miles and one day later, come to
Bijapur. This is a large town, a county seat in Indian
terms. It remains the focus for the sale of produce
from surrounding farms. Many small-scale industries
are developing in the region and an economic
“boom” has started.

This city was once the capital of a great Muslim
empire. The founder, Mohammad Adil Shah,
reigned in the 15th Century and is buried in the G01
Gumbaz. This monstrous mausoleum, con-
structed on a 600-foot square platform, holds a tomb
196 feet on a side and 7 stories high. On the 7th story
and above rests the great Dome, 124 feet in dia-
meter, 15 feet smaller in diameter than St. Peter’s in
Rome, but with no central supports. The great hall of
the Dome was, until quite recently, the largest
domed space in the world.

Some 400 years later, the palace area ruins
testify to the architectural and engineering skills as
well as to the taste and culture of that kingdom.

From Bijapur we travel south again, to and then
through the Valley of Vijayanagar. This valley
was the capital of a great civilization ruled by Kings
of Vijayanagar who dominated South India from the
14th through the 16th Centuries. The ruins cover
nine square miles along the banks of the river
Krishna and are among the most startling I have seen
anywhere in the world. There are palaces and
pagodas of fine marble, covered with fantastic sculp-
tures. These were carved from the rock struc-
ture of the temple, not carved elsewhere and then
placed in their position. The magnificent temple
which heads the valley is connected by a four-lane
street to the palace of the King and royal residences
at the other end. On either side, one notes the
remains of two-story dwellings and, perhaps, a
shopping center. The Vijayanagar Valley holds clear
evidence of greatness that once characterized this
kingdom.

From Vijayanagar we travel south and west into
the Western Ghats of Mysore, the range of hills
running southward along the western coast of India.

The area is rich in minerals. Iron ore, bauxite
and many others are here but the full extent of all
deposits is still unknown.

Here is fodder for the future industrial giant that
India could become. Our destination in the Ghats:
Jog Falls.

We get there late at night after a difficult trip
along roads that sometimes disappear and are always
narrow, through forests that canopy the road,
through mountain passes and over mountain roads
that challenge any driver. Upon arrival we take up
residence in another of the bungalows.

We sleep that night in comfort but with a sound
of thunder in our ears. We wake up early in the
morning to explore its source. We find that source to
be a series of waterfalls, each many times

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-DECEMBER, ‘I971

higher than Niagara and several having greater vol-
ume, spread over three faces of the cliffs ending a
gorge into which all pour together, joining at a
power station far below. Dawn is unbelievable. The
falls roar into the silence. The sense of peacefulness
and quiet sitting on the rocks above the gorge, with
all that water speaking to the wilderness, provides a
permanent but only partially comprehended mem-
ory weeks later. Wildlife in the area is plentiful;
there are deer as well as smaller animals plus cats of
various kinds and sizes. The trip to the falls was
difficult but that morning would have amply repaid
problems many times more serious.

From Jog Falls we go to Bangalore. This is a
special city. It is among the most beautiful of India
or of any country I have seen. It too was once a
British Cantonment area. Lying in the beginning
of the Nilgiris, the central hill system of South India,
at an altitude of more than 3,000 feet, it enjoys a
pleasant climate all year around. It is a city of gar-
dens, wide streets and pleasant scenes. The West
End Hotel is always attractive to the tourist,
Indian or American, but one should not overlook the
smaller and more centrally located Shilton House, an
older but rather more interesting place to stay. The
food in both is excellent. South Parade, one of the
large, wide streets of central downtown Bangalore, is
reputed throughout the country to be the place to sit
while quietly and pleasantly watching some of the
prettiest of all Indian girls go about their shopping
chores.

From Bangalore it is convenient to drive some
sixty miles south to Mysore City. The road is
clear and clean and well maintained. In general, the
road of South India is good, blacktop, two-laned.
Automobile service is available at almost every
village or city along the way.

Mysore City is the home of the Maharajah of
Mysore, one of the most glamorous and wealthy of
all the princes of pre-independence India. He is also
a philosopher of world stature, has served as one of
the most able Governors of Mysore and, today, con-
tinues to serve his country as a skilled administrator
in various posts.

His Mysore palaces are home for his several
royal families. These are magnificent structures of
marble and give full evidence of the kind of life once
standard for the ruling houses of the princely states.

There are temples and forts everywhere and
ivory carvings to be purchased from this South
Indian center of that form. Three miles from the city,
the Cauvery River Dam provides the setting for the
gardens of Krishnaraja Sajar and the Brindavan
Hotel. The gardens, located below the dam, are
floodlit every night into a fairyland of flowers, color
and light. The hotel is a fine example of British
period architecture, comfortable, well served and
pleasant to any traveler.

Hydrogenesis. What is it? Hydrogenesis is the natural
phenomenon whereby liquid moisture is created from
air. It also is the name given to the phenomenon of
water being generated in the aggregate base of a con-
ventional-design Asphalt pavement during cyclic tem-
perature change. During warming cycles, moisture in
vapor form is drawn from the subgrade and pavement
shoulders into the aggregate base. Then, during cooling,
the resultant condensation introduces liquid moisture
into the subgrade. Moisture reaching the subgrade under
any pavement hastens pavement distress and failure
under traffic.

Full-Depth Asphalt pavement is the most effective
pavement type in excluding moisture from the subgrade.
There are no joints to admit surface moisture, and there
is no granular base to admit moisture by lateral seepage
or to permit generation of moisture by hydrogenesis.
Full-Depth Asphalt pavement Is placed directly on the
subgrade or improved subgrade; pavement thickness is
calculated in accordance with traffic requirements and
subgrade soil characteristics. Placed rapidly by machine
and promptly consolidated by rolling, Full-Depth Asphalt
pavement becomes at once water impermeable and pro-
vides longer-lasting, low-maintenance service at low-
first cost. Driving is safer, quieter and more comfortable.

On Monday night, November 15th, as the finale
to his Continuing Education Course, “Air Pollution
Control Methods for the Metals Industry,” Professor
R. A. Stoehr conducted a lively panel discussion.
The subject of the discussion, which was open to stu-
dents and faculty, was “Can the Metals Industry

' Comply with Air Pollution Control Laws and Sur-

vive?” Dr. Stoehr had amassed a distinguished and
expert panel: Dr. George Smith, Technical Coordi-
nator, Environmental Health Services, ALCOA; Mr.
A. S. Odasso, Facilities Engineer, Allegheny-Ludlum
Steel; Mr. Bernard Bloom, GASP and Allegheny
County Bureau of Air Pollution Control; Mr. Larry
Demarce, Assistant Solicitor, Allegheny County and

26

Counsel for the Bureau of Air Pollution Control; Mr.
Dietrich Weyel, Graduate Student, Occupational
Health Department, GSPH, University of Pittsburgh.
These responsive men provided new and varied in-
sights into the future of air pollution control. The
following is an effort to reproduce accurately the
statements of positions, questions and answers by the
panel and the audience.

CAN THE METALS INDUSTRY COMPLY
WITH AIR POLLUTION CONTROLS LAWS AND
SURVIVE?

Mr. Bloom — I consider the question a moot

on the survival
of at great
am ericcm industry

point. There will be a steel industry in the United
States. The government would not permit it to die.
There is no question that air pollution can be con-
trolled with the existing technology.

Dr. Smith — Which control laws are you talking
about? Are they the ones that exist now or the ones
in the future? Are we to consider the ones that are on
the books now or the ones that are now on the draft-
ing tables or the third or fourth generation control
laws?

Industry, Government and the citizens have
worked well together to make good laws in 1941 and
with revisions in 1960 & 1969. For twenty to thirty
years we have been benefiting from the good results.
Now there is environmental hysteria with pressure
groups and the government misleading the people.
The climate is changing however. President Nixon
recently made a statement that the cost mpstbe
taken into account in future air pollution control
laws. The pollution problem has not been solved yet.
There is need for continued public pressure, but the
movement faces the real danger of going too far and
falling of its own weight. If regulation standards are
set too high to be technologically or economically
feasible, the movement will lose credibility.

Mr. Demasse — I am concerned with com-
pliance with the law and not whether industry can
survive. The laws have been enforced with economic
feasibility in mind, but the courts are not the place to
solve these economic issues; they should be dealt
with in the legislation. The courts don’t have the ex-
pertise in economic matters to justly cope with the
controversies.

Mr. Weyel — I am not concerned with the sur-
vival of industry, only with conducting unbiased re-
search. I do feel, however, that scientists and engi-
neers have missed the boat in their research and de-
velopment. For instance, for fifty years the automo-
tive engineers did essentially nothing to curb auto-
motive air pollution emissions. Cooperation is
needed between industry, researchers, and the pub-
lie in solving the air pollution problem.

Dr. Cralley — What form will industry survive in
is a better question. There is little doubt that the
metals industry will survive. We know there are new
and stricter regulations on the drawing board, but we
don’t know what they will be or their cost to indus-
try. There are projections right now that 40% to
75% of our retained corporate earnings will have to

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—DECEMBER, 1971

go into air pollution control in the next few years.
New stricter regulations might require us to put
100% of our corporate earnings to this use. Margin-
ally productive plants will have to be looked at again
to see if they are worth putting new equipment into.

Mr. Odasso — Yes it will survive, but will it be
called an industry? Air pollution is just one part of
the problem. There is water pollution also which has
cost us close to ten million dollars to control. The
costs of air pollution control are underestimated.
Secondary costs must be considered. The cost of
coke we buy ‘has gone up because that industry has
had to install pollution equipment and the utility
rates for our power have gone up because they have
had to install equipment too. It’s hard to calculate
these expenses, but they all affect our competitiveness

To gain the competitive edge, the experts in downhill slalom have
this advice: “Watch the time line—the fastest course line.”

“In the race against time, if a skier slips off and goes too low in the

As you look to your future course, watch for the company whose
progress is on a time line with your own.

Ask companies about their expansion and modernization programs (ours is an optimistic
$221 million). Find out if you’re interested in the markets they’re interested in.
If they have a position that ﬁts the course you’ve set. If they promote from within.

with other parts of the industry here and abroad. It
should be realized that to cut down pollutants by
90% will cost so much but to cut it down to 95%
might cost twice as much. Cost-effectiveness should
be considered and how much air pollution signifi-
cantly affects health. No industry will knowingly put
out anything that will be harmful to the public’s
health. A major industry shouldn’t be closed down
because of insignificant air pollution.

Dr. Stoehr — There is no doubt that without
regulation, the pollution problem would be getting
worse. The Pittsburgh area has the particular prob-
lems of having one of the heaviest concentration of
the metals industry in the world. Its topology also
works against it. The hills and valleys tend to focus
high concentrations of pollutants on parts of the
population. A good question is:

CAN A HEAVY CONCENTRATION OF
INDUSTRY STAY IN THE PITTSBURGH AREA
OR WILL IT MOVE TO OTHER PLACES IN THE
UNITED STATES OR ABROAD?

Dr. Smith — Industry is aware that the federal
government is moving to make control regulation
equal in aH parts of the country. It costs a great deal
to move a company and chances are that it will face
the same problems sooner or later wherever it
moves.

Mr. Odasso — There are two incidents I know
of that might shed some light on this conjecture. A
plant which was under very lenient regulations in-
stalled equipment much more efficient than required
because it was having poor community relations.
Another plant that is near no population center and
underrno legal compulsion to control its pollutants is

28

moving to install equipment because it forsees the
possibility of future federal legislation.

Dr. Cralley — Companies are definitely looking
at the feasibility of expanding into foreign countries.

Audience — Do you know how many com-
panies in Allegheny County have been put out of
business by the pollution control laws?

Mr. Demacce — There have been a number of
small companies that couldn’t absorb the cost and
closed, but no major companies.

Audience — Will regulations get tougher?

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—-DECEMBER, 1971

t--I

Mr. Bloom — The numbers will get a little
tighter. The real difference will be that We’ll be
better at using our tools. Our monitoring systems are
getting better and We’ll know better how to force
compliance.

Mr. Odasso —— Is there any danger in State and
County regulations overlapping?

Mr. Demacce — The State regulations are the
minimum acceptable State wide. Any County can
make more stringent requirements, but they will
have to be at least as strict as the State’s. The only
jurisdictional dispute I know of is between the State
water pollution control board and the air pollution
control board concerning the Clairton Coke Works.
The air pollution board wants the company to solve
its problem by using water and the water board
wants them to cut down on the heavy metals in their
water discharge. The State won’t have to come into
the County if the county doesn’t stop enforcing its
regulations.

Audience — Are there any studies that show
that our current pollution levels have adverse affects
on health?

Mr. Weyel — To quote one of my professors, “If
you drive down a highway and you see paper and
cans and half eaten hotdogs strewn over the land-
scape, you don’t require it to be hazardous to your
health before you clean it up. The same criterion

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—DECEMBER, 1971

should apply to air pollution. Breathing clean air
should be a right.

Mr. Demasse — We won’t question the health
hazard, when there is pollution, there is the feeling it
is a health hazard.

Mr. Bloom — The relation of air pollution to
health is poorly understood. It was hard enough to
prove cigarette smoking is hazardous to your health.
There are studies showing an increased death rate in
areas of heavy pollution. When trying to say that X
amount of air pollution is hazardous to your health
and X/ 2 isn’t hazardous the information isn’t that
clear. We consider it irresponsible however to wait
until all the statistics are in to start to control it. I
should not that at 7 out of 8 monitoring stations in
the County, the pollution index is down 10 per cent
over last year.

Mr. Weyel — There are studies on groups of
mice exposed to an atmosphere of high S02 and high
particulate emissions. The mice exposed to the
polluted atmosphere lived longer than mice breath-
ing clean air. I don’t think that means we should start
polluting the air more. The high levels of air
pollution effect on humans is mostly to the very old,
very young and very weak.

Audience — Will a reduction in automobile
emissions relieve some of the pressure of industry?

Mr. Bloom — Especially in the Pittsburgh area
there are few interfaces between automotive and
industrial air pollution. For instance, automobiles
produce negligible S02.

Audience — Is there a goal or are we just going
to continue to be more restrictive as technology ad-
vances? Is there any relation of measurable health
effects to our air pollution regulations?

Mr. Bloom — The Federal maximum pollution
standards are related to measurable health effects.
The County air pollution index that you see on TV
and in the papers is related to Federal standards. An
air pollution index of 25 is equivalent to the Federal
maximum daily rating and 100 is the level the

 

29

government says shouldn’t be reached more than
once a year. The formula for the index is

1:50 (S02 + Coefficient of Haze).

Dr. Stoehr — Earlier in our history the source of
pollution was more identifiable. In the case of the
Donora disaster, people knew who was to blame and
the civil courts could assign guilt. Now there are so
many sources constantly polluting, it is hard to assign
individual guilt. That is why we’ve had to go to new
legislation and constant monitoring systems to pro-
tect the public.

I believe one thing we’ve found to be true in our
studies in this course is that you will save money in
the long run if when you pick pollution control
equipment, you go to the limit of technology avail-
able. You might not have to replace it so soon.

Audience — What per cent is meeting the pre-
sent requirements?

Mr. Bloom — Only a couple of the boilers in the
area are meeting the S02 requirements. We really
don’t know who is meeting the particulate emission
requirements and who isn’t. Control agencies are
getting tougher. In Gary, Indiana a board said be-
cause of the health hazard they ought to close down
US Steel’s 500 coke ovens, but because of economic
considerations they would give them 5 years to com-
ply with regulations. They said they would not
tolerate any delays. In Pittsburgh, very soon you will
begin to see such language.

Audience — Outside of the military, industry
has the most political influence in this country. Why
has industry essentially neglected to lobby for having
their say in pollution control laws? They complain
after laws are made rather than trying to offer their

30

own input to legislation while it is being drawn up?
They could, for example, have pressed for the right
to amortize the cost of pollution control equipment
before being forced to install new equipment. They
always seem to wait until the last minute before they
try to get their nickle’s worth in. Has industry
learned any lessons?

Dr. Cralley — Industry essentially acts as
individuals. There are too many anti-trust laws which
could cause trouble.

None of the quotes should be considered exact.
This reporter missed some of the conversation. Sel-
dom, if ever, are so many knowledgeable people on
this subject gathered together in one place. The dis-
cussion was lively and interesting. If any corrections
are requested they will gladly be printed in our next
issue.

(Dr. Stuart continued from page 19)

consists of much more than the immediate land-
scape. The engineer is the only professional person
in our society who is capable of design within the
context of this coupling of the socioeconomic com-
plex and the physical-chemical surroundings. There
are some very conscientious designers who attack
one of the many visible symptoms of our environ-
mental problem. The lasting solutions, the solutions
vital to survival are most often imbedded so deeply
in our present system that it is only the engineers
who are aware of this complexity and who can direct
us toward a solution.

A very good example of this imbedding is the
problem of air pollution. The engineering profession
is well aware of the particulates and sulfur dioxide
going into our atmosphere by the increased use of
coal as a primary power source. Extreme measures
for cleaning these stacks are technologically
possible, but only with a great increase in the cost of
power or the cost of steel. The alternative of burning
natural gas is only a temporary solution to the prob-
lem. Our natural gas reserves are dwindling rapidly,

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-DECEMBER, ‘I971

and we cannot afford this premium fuel for industrial
use much longer. The power demand in the United
States will go from the present 330 gigawatts to 1400
gigawatts in the 90’s. With decreasing gas reserves,
the only alternative to coal is nuclear fuel. Rather
than allowing an abrupt drop in our economy, the
engineer is working to conserve our energy
supplies, he has developed safe nuclear plants, and is
working toward the development of a breeder re-
actor which would extend our nuclear fuel supply
and prevent power poverty.

For years the engineering profession has been
quietly working toward improving our environment.
I am pleased that there is now a public awareness of
the problem and hopefully there is now the
possibility of support for the efforts of the engineer.
A short range attack on many of the problems is
being suggested by many people. In their enthusiasm
they would adopt a process which would require
energy to collect one waste, which in turn may
require another process to treat its waste and so on
to a sort of Zeno’s pollution paradox. I suggest we
adopt a firm philosophy of conservation of our
energy resources for survival and minimization of
pollution will be a fringe benefit.

In his article, Mr. Nelson touched on an
additional point which also needs a reply. He
criticizes the appearance of construction work and
buildings of the post-industrial revolution era. Cer-
tainly by today’s standards of beauty the railroad sta-
tions and even some decorated bridges and dams are
ugly. The engineers who participated in the dramatic
use of new materials and new methods of construc-
tion were just using the technique of gaining public
acceptance of these new methods and materials by
decorative hints of the past. The failure of the
Chrysler Airflow automobile design because it was
ahead of its time is an example of the engineering
designer having to retreat to a slower adaptation of
the carriage body into something the public will
accept. This is kitsch, but the engineer made it
possible for many more people to have an auto-
mobile by redesigning its appearance. Where the
engineer was unencumbered by architectural or cul-
tural precedent, the engineer has provided beauty in
his design. As the most obvious example the air-
planes designed by engineers are outstanding exam-
ples of functional beauty. This building for human
habitation or human use which flies through the air is
a dramatic example of engineering design and
beauty.

(In India continued from page 25)

The food of South India is different from that of
the north. Rice is central to every Southern meal. It
is served in plain white heaping mounds, in a cake-
like form called idli, spiced seasoned in various ways
or used as the base for a flour. In addition, there are
dosais, a very thin pancake-like production, vadas,
things like donuts but highly seasoned, and curries.
There are four kinds of curry found in India. Those
of Bengal are on the sweet side. Those of Bombay
tend to be creamy and mild. Madras curries are
highly seasoned and highly spiced, but those of
Andhra are simply hot and are a challenge to the
pallet of any India buff. Almost any food provides
the base for curry —— vegetables, fish, meat or foul. In
my most recent trips I find for the first time that
South Indian dishes are listed on North Indian
restaurant menus and vice versa. This is one further
example of the increased travel and exchange
between the North and South, evidence of the
increasing oneness of the country.

We drive south from Mysore into the Nilgiris,
first to Ootacamund and then to Kodaikanal. The
former is the famous “Ooty,” the hill station favored
by the British as the place providing an escape from
the coastal summer heat.

But “Kodai” is by far my favorite. The
Carlton Hotel is a pleasant rambling structure and
the food again is excellent. The scenery and vacation
opportunities in the area are superb. One could
spend weeks hiking through the hills and enjoying
picnics or simple pleasant walks through lovely hills
neighboring on the great tea plantations of the
South.

Continuing south we eventually reach Cape
Comorin, the southern tip of India where three
oceans meet and where the monument to Mr.
Gandhi has been built. A stop along the way at
Periyar would be worthwhile, were there time,
for this is one of the great remaining game preserves
of the world, a preserve in which the elephant herds,
cats of all variety, deer, buffalo and bison abound,
protected in a natural setting. Again, the visitor finds
the Dak Bungalows convenient and comfortable, the
food is good, if plain, but quite reliable.

We turn at Comorin and drive northward
toward Madras, the great seacoast port of Tamil
Nadu. On our way we stop at Madurai, an Indian
city, not especially tuned to western travelers; a
university town but most particularly for the Hindu
faith. The temple at Madurai is one of the great
Hindu temples of all India, one of the four most holy
in the country. Its structure is fantastic; its size, its
sculpture and its art, its lavishness in detail, its
holiness! Even the non-Hindu feels the latter. One
could and should spend days examining the carvings,

Feeling, etched on the faces of other people
with whom we interact, is remarkably revealing.
Physical contact via a handclasp or embrace may say
more than words could ever say. As man has realized
and appreciated the expressive potential of looking,
feeling, and touching, these gestures have become
meaningful supplements to his language. They have
become auxillary modes of communication, a help-
ing hand where words may not suffice.

In his creativity, man has continually striven to
enliven and expand his language, to make it a
socially adequate means of communication. In so
doing, he has not only adopted the naturally express-
ive gestures, but has come to adorn his language with
spice and colour — a little linguistic raz-ma-taaz. He
has infused language with a colorful variety of taboo
words, obcenities, random curses, to express the
unexpressable and fill the overwhelming emptiness.

Obscenity varies with area, and is largely in the
ear of the beholder. Rasmussen, in his three volume
work, “The Intellectual Life of the Eskimo’: reports
that a man’s name becomes taboo for a period of up
to three years after his death. Since it is common for
Eskimo names to be compounded to one such as He
Who Paddles Swiftly the Safe Canoe”, it follows that
each of these words could be considered obscene
and new words must be invented to supplement the
language. The Zulu in Africa make obscene and pro-
hibit any utterances of the names of forefathers of
the tribal chieftain for as many generations back as
anyone can remember. In Laos, nearly all common
words become obscene to a man when elephant
hunting, and he is obliged to provide himself with a
special language for such occasions. There is a ten-
dency in many European languages to substitute
“nice” words for our four-letter words pertaining to
bodily functions. Hence, we have eliminate,
copulate, urinate, etc. We define the four-letter
words as obscene and participate in a linguistic ritual
similar to the elephant hunter and the Eskimo.

Time is also influential in determining what is
obscene. In the 1939 film version of “Gone With the
Wind”, Clark Gable’s famous exit line, “Frankly, my
dear I don’t give a damn” caused a major uproar
when it first came to the screen. In 30 years,
however, times have changed to the extent that
today our modern poetry, songs, and movies are
liberally sprinkled with four-letter words. Another
example is the pig. A sacred animal in the early cul-
tures of the Near East, it has become the dirty un-
kosher pig, for the Semites in establishing dom-
mance of the area, reversed earlier myths and

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-DECEMBER. 1971

manufactured new beliefs surrounding that animal.
This anti-pig sentiment has spread into Europe and
we have the derogatory German “schwein”, the
Italian “porco” and the English version which has
most recently become very inflammatory when
applied to police by young radicals.

The swearing American who infuses rambunc-
tious sexuality into many neuter objects is reacting
against his Puritan traditions, and at same time,
compensating for the lack of gender in his language.
Rebellious adolescents often play a four-letter word
game called “Getting Back at Daddy” for obscenity
is also the compulsive breaking of taboos, the quest
for an ultimate freedom. Names applied to ethnic
groups — kike, nigger, whitey — are especially
potent obscenities for they strip the badge of hum-
anity from the feared or despised person, and last,
but by no means least, the popular obscene sex
terms. They are among the most enduring words in
the language — simple and direct, and especially
potent for they force the hearer to visualize the
bodily parts involved. Thus, they are psychologically
equivalent to removing the listener’s clothes,
embarassing him and endowing the speaker with a
kind of power and dominance.

Current obscenities are often considered signs
of the times. Dr. Renatus Hartogs, Child Psychia-
trist at Youth House and New York Detention
Home for Juvenile Delinquents, tells us that he sees
in obscenity a “significant clue to the psycho-
dynamics of the culture.” Obscene language has be-
come an increasingly socially acceptable way of
expressing one’s repressed urges and at the same
time testing society’s reaction to those impulses.
Adroitness at the playing of four-letter word games is
in some circles an index of social sophisitication, in
others a threat of violence or a declaration of
dominance, or as with youthful protesters, an
expression of frustration and bitterness.

Today, the popular obscenities are viewed by
psychiatrists as being indicative of the hidden ele-
ments within the individual or his culture. Obscenity
is revealing because it is non-partisan. With great
impartiality, the dirty word makes everything come
out zero. Obscenity turns the unspeakable into the
natural idiom of rebellion, counteracting the
acknowledged good and challenging whatever
orthodoxy prevails. It is man’s ancient and universal
sub-language, the healthy goddam, whereby man
asserts the instinctual primitive side of life against all
the inhibiting forces of his environment.

The depressed job market in 1970-71 has
created an engineering “employment problem” rate
of 4.7 percent, according to Dr. Robert J. Rande-
baugh, President of Engineers Joint Council. The
figures were obtained by querying one-fifth of the
500,000 individual members of twenty-three major
engineering societies, representing all fields of
engineering employment. The survey, conducted last
summer by EJC for the National Science Founda-

34

tion, was completed in August and the results have
just been released by the Foundation. Because of the
membership qualifications of the engineering
societies, the group covered, constituting about 40
per cent of all self-styled engineers in the U.S., is
“more qualified, more experienced, and more pro-
fessionally oriented than the total engineer popula-
tion,” according to NSF. A similar survey of scien-
tists was conducted by the Foundation earlier in the
summer.

The unemployment rate for the group surveyed,
as reported by the National Science Foundation, was
3.0 per cent. EJC believes that those engineers who
are working only part-time or doing nonengineering
work because of inability to, find full-time’ pro-
fessional employment should be added to the com-
pletely unemployed in order to analyze current
employment problems. Out of every 1000 engineers
in EJC’s “employment problem” category, 678 were
out of work, 119 were doing part-time engineering
work while seeking full-time employment, and 203
were working in nonengineering positions because
engineering jobs were not available. EJC has also
used a slightly different data base for its “employ-
ment problem” statistics by not including those
engineering society members who reported that they
preferred doing nonengineering work or were work-
ing part-time and not seeking full-time employment.
The National Science Foundation, using Labor
Department classifications, counted as employed all
those who were doing work of any kind whether full-
or part-time, engineering or nonengineering, and
numbered as unemployed only those without a job of
any kind. For example, a laid-off engineer working
temporarily in a nonengineering job such as driving a
taxi-cab would be considered employed in the
government’s statistics whereas from the engineering
profession’s point of view he would clearly constitute
part of the employment problem. The government
unemployment rate therefore represents 1,700
unemployed engineers out of a labor force of 55,800,
while EJC’s “employment problem” rate represents
2,500 unemployed or sub-professionally employed
out of a total of 52,000 engaged in or seeking full-
time engineering work. 'l‘he actual magnitudes of
the two rates are less important than the compara-
tive relationships among the various subgroups
identified in the survey data. (Tables 1 and 2
attached show in detail how the government and EJC
statistics were derived.)

According to the survey, engineering
unemployment has almost doubled between March
1970 and June 1971. This compares to an increase of
about 27 percent in total national unemployment
over the same period. Even more dramatic is the
increase in engineering unemployment since the
1964-69 period, when less than one per cent of the
respondents to major surveys conducted by EJC on
behalf of the National Engineers Register reported
themselves out of work.

The depressed job market has not affected all
kinds of engineers equally, however. A detailed
analysis of the survey data shows the following
groups to have been particularly hard hit:

Engineers without college degrees had an
“employment problem” rate 44 per cent higher than
those with degrees.

Graduates whose highest degrees were in non-
engineering curricula were 49 per cent more likely to
have employment problems than those with highest
degrees in engineering.

The problem rate for electronics and aerospace
specialists was over 60 per cent higher than for
engineers in general. Other specialties with sub-
stantially higher than average “employment
problem” rates were manufacturing engineering,
computer and mathematics, systems engineering,
and industrial engineering. Groups with the lowest
.incidence of problems were civil, petroleum,
environmental and sanitary, and chemical engineer-
ing. Other specialties with low problem rates were
agricultural and mining engineering.

The highest problem rate of all was found
among those who were doing engineering related
work but who indicated that their particular
specialty was nonengineering in nature.

Non-U.S. citizens, although relatively few in
total numbers in the survey, were nearly 80 per cent
more likely to have employment problems than U.S.
citizens.

Self-employed engineers and those in
educational and nonprofit institutions had about
four times as high a “problem” rate as government
workers.

Engineers under 30 or over 55 had the highest
rates of unemployment or professional under-
employment.

Geographically, Seattle engineers had the high-

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER—DEC-EMBER, 1971

employment problems of engineers
highlighted by new survey

est official unemployment rate but those in Wichita
had the highest “employment problem” rate,
although the number involved was apparently much
smaller. Other high unemployment areas were
Southern California, Cape Kennedy, and Boston.

Tables 3, 4 and 5 attached show how the EJC
“employment problem” rates compare with the
unemployment rates reported by the National
Science Foundation for a number of selected groups.

The employment survey has helped in several
ways to clarify the real nature of the engineering
unemployment problem. One indication that should
be encouraging to students is the fact that engineers
possessing strong educational qualifications are
much less likely to be unemployed than are
individuals who received their preparation in other
fields. Also, the pinpointing of age groups,
specialties, and geographical regions having the most
serious employment problems should enable correc-
tive efforts to be concentrated where they will do the
most good. The identification of fields where the
demand for engineers is still strong should be helpful
to educators, students, and government agencies in
shaping educational and retraining problems.

On the other hand, the survey has clearly
demonstrated that engineers’ employment prob-
lems are more complex than had been com-
monly assumed. Most current government pro-
grams, for instance, are aimed at areas where aero-
space and defense cutbacks have been most severe.
The survey shows that other categories have serious
employment problems too. EJC has proposed a full-
fledged program of supply-demand surveys at
regular intervals of six months or a year as a means
of developing a better understanding of the many-
faceted problems periodically besetting engineering,
in which manpower shortages are suddenly and
unpredictably replaced by surpluses in some areas
while unfilled demand continues to exist in others.
Such a program, EJC believes, offers the best hope of
enabling governmental agencies and professional
organizations to identify employment problem areas
and initiate corrective action before the problems
grow to crisis proportions. The United States needs
to develop the capability of predicting its high-level
manpower needs far enough in advance to avoid
wasteful imbalances between demand and supply in
such critical occupations as engineers and scientists,
whose talents are so clearly needed in solving the
major technologically-related problems facing our
society now and in the future.

PITT ENGINEERING SCHOOL
PAYS TRIBUTE TO DONORS

Officials of the University of Pittsburgh’s School
of Engineering paid tribute on Thursday, October
28, to its many donors and friends for their support in
completion of the Michael L. Benedum Hall of
Engineering complex.

The $20-million facility, located at O’Hara and
Thackeray Streets, was dedicated in March and be-
came fully operational with the start of the 1971-72
fall tenn.

The Contributors Recognition Day Ceremony
was held at 4:30 p.m. in the lobby of the new build-
ing, with Dean H.E. Hoelscher presiding. A recep-
tion followed.

Recognition was given to the many organiza-
tions and individuals who contributed to the building
program over the past six years. According to Dean
Hoelscher, many of the contributions, such as those
of the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation
(which enabled the School to obtain the 1.8-acre
building site), the George M. Bevier family (who
funded the School’s library), and numerous friends in
business and industry, have been financial. The
nature of the contributions from others, such as
those of the engineering professional societies, has
been different but is regarded as equally important.

36

The ceremonies included the unveiling of
bronze replicas of the official seals of ten engineer-
ing professional societies and a plaque listing the
names of industrial and foundation donors.

The General State Authority and the Depart-
ment of Property and Supplies of the Common-
wealth provided the bulk of the funds for building
construction, equipment, and furnishings. Dean
Hoelscher also acknowledged the contributions of
individual donors, both alumni and friends of the
School; plaques in honor of many of these donors
have been placed in the laboratories and offices of
Benedum Hall.

PITT PROFESSOR USES NEW HYDRAULICS
TECHNIQUE
TO STUDY ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS

A research program aimed at solving environ-
mental problems associated with the flow of water
and solids in natural streams and rivers is being
undertaken by Dr. Chao-Lin Chiu, associate pro-
fessor of civil engineering at the University of Pitts-
burgh.

The project, “Stochastic Simulation of Flows in
Natural Streams and Rivers,” is funded by the
National Science Foundation under a two-year,
$60,000 grant.

Dr. Chiu’s research involves the development of
techniques for accurately predicting the flow of
water in natural streams by the stochastic method —
an approach which uses statistics and probabilities to
predict results.

According to Dr. Chiu, prediction of flow is
complicated by the irregular and varying shapes of
natural rivers, especially near coastal regions where
they are affected by tides. Solid wastes and sediment
are irregularly accelerated, delayed, interrupted, or
trapped at various points. By developing methods for
simulating how rivers should behave, based upon
statistical information, engineers will be better able
to forecast natural river flow. This information will
enable them to improve predictions of water levels in
downstream rivers controlled by dams, and can be
used to study movement of pollutants in natural
channels.

PITT OFFERS SEMINAR
ON BULK MATERIALS HANDLING

For the fourth consecutive year, the University
of Pittsburgh School of Engineering’s Office of Con-
tinuing Education is offering a seminar-workshop on
bulk materials handling, with emphasis this year on
conveyor systems.

The two—day workshop on December 8 and 9
will be’ held in the Benedum Hall of Engineering
Auditorium. It will be headed by Minor C. Hawk,
assistant dean of special projects and services.

Mr. Hawk pointed out that although bulk
materials handling constitutes about 30 per cent of
the gross national product, relatively few engineers
or engineering educators are aware of the problems
involved in the field or the efforts being made to
solve them in basic industry.

The Pitt workshops were inaugurated to
exchange and disseminate knowledge and ideas
which would promote advances in the field. The
1968 sessions dealt with a general overview of bulk
materials handling systems; the second workshop
addressed itself to the operation of hydraulic and
pneumatic materials handling systems; and last
year’s program was designed to review the state of
the art and major advances in storage and reclaiming
of bulk solids.

Speakers at the seminar~workshop will include
recognized experts in their areas of specialization.
All sessions will conclude with question-and-answer
periods.

The topics and speakers are as follows:

“Conveyor Belting in the '70s,” by Edgar T.
Gregory of B.F. Goodrich Company, Akron, Ohio;
“European Engineering Practices for Belt Con-
veyors,” by Zdenek Jilek of Soros and Associates of
New York; “Screw Conveyors” by Fred M. Thomson

MOST BEAUTIFUL STEEL BUILDING
NAMED IN NATIONAL COMPETITION

The United States Steel Building, Pittsburgh,
Pa., is one of fifteen of the most beautiful steel
framed buildings in the United States according to
the American Institute of Steel Construction’s
Twelfth Annual Competition. The winners included
a Coliseum, an airline maintenance hangar, an
educational building, two corporate headquarters
buildings, a municipal building, a power generating
plant, an industrial building, a low rise residential
structure, a rapid transit station, two low rise office
buildings, and three high rise office buildings. The
jurors said of the USS building: “This innovative
structure is a bold expression of steel as a structural
and architectural material. It is a successful, unusual
design.”

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER—DECEMBEF\’. ‘I971

(In India continued from page 31)

exploring the sculpture and the byways of the city.
There are hotels, rest houses and, of course, the
bungalows for any traveler.

Finally, Madras! This is the great southern
seaport city which provided the entre for Clive of
India and the East Indian Company, opening the
days of the British Indian Empire. Calcutta is nor-
mally considered the seat of British Empire in this
country but Madras is where it started. This is a
different city. Less bustling, less hurried, more open
in its scenery and its attitude; a warmer city, a
friendlier city and my home away from home.

The people are the Tamilians of India derived
from ancient Dravidian stock having origins in the
Indus Valley of what is now Pakistan —— four-to-five
thousand years ago. They are different from the
Indo—Europeans whose Sanskrit base links them to us
Americans. The Tamilians have no such link. They
are darker, fine featured, aquiline of face, fine boned
and generally small in stature.

Madras is an industrial capital, the financial and
the management center for southern industry. There
are many fine hotels, some western, some Indian.
The Oceanic on the beach, the Connemara, Spen-
cers Hotel from the British days, and several newer
and rather touristy hotels are all attractive to the
traveler. The seaport serves the southern half of
India and is one of the busy ports within this world.
The seashore southward toward the Cape Comorin, a
beach called the Marina, is one of the longest and
most beautiful expanses of pure, clean white sand
this world still has. Fishing along this coast is
excellent and provides an important industry for the
people of Madras.

The University of Madras is one of the oldest in
old India. The Indian Institute of Technology of
Madras, started with aid from West Germany a
decade past, the Guindy Engineering College and
the A. C. College of Technology, an affiliate of the
University of Madras, are all located together in the
suburb Guindy, outside Madras, and form a
technical educational center for the south.

The airport of Madras is a convenient place
from which to embark for Singapore, Hong Kong,
Taiwan and the west coast of the United States. We
entered India at Bombay and leave from Madras.
There was much missed along the way, some of it
overlooked and some bypassed for future reference.
Any single location could easily provide the basis for
a longer story. Areas like Kerala on the southwest,
the central Gangetic Plain and north from Madras
into Orissa are equally worth attention. But those
can be saved for later tales.

ALASKAN RESCUE VIA ATS—1

A five-year-old Earth-orbiting satellite recently
played a vital role in saving the life of one woman in
Alaska and in relieving another seriously ill patient
on the same day.

The satellite is ATS-1 (Applications Technology
Satellite) which will celebrate its fifth birthday in
space in December. ATS currently is functioning as
a switchboard-in-the-sky in a statewide Alaskan
communications experiment under a cooperative
program between the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the State of Alaska, and the
Lister-Hill National Center for Biomedical Com-
munications of the Department of Health, Educa-
tion, and Welfare.

During a routine educational program on Sept-
ember 30 via ATS in which physicians were instruct-
ing medical aides in remote villages, two emergency
medical problems were reported. In one case a nurse
in the village of Chalkyitsik in northeastern Alaska
was attending a pregnant woman who was
hemorrhaging severely. In the other a woman was
undergoing an appendicitis attack in Anatuvuk Pass
in the north central part of the state.

NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Green-
belt, Md., was notified of the emergencies and its
ATS-1 Control Center kept the satellite in operation
through most of the night.

Through ATS, Dr. Michael Carrol of the Dis-
trict Medical Center, Tanana, Alaska, provided
instructions to the nurse in Chalkyitsik who success-
fully stopped the hemorrhaging. She survived the
night and was successfully removed to Tanana the
next morning.

Almost simultaneously, via the satellite, Dr.
Carrol instructed an aide in Anatuvuk on treatment
for that patient. She also was relieved and trans-
ferred to nearby Fort Yukon the following morning.

The following message was later received at
Goddard from Robert Merritt of the University of
Alaska at College:

“We at College, the entire villages of Anatuvuk
Pass and Chalkyitsik, the doctors of Tanana Service
Hospital and most of all, the two patients, wish to
thank those responsible at Rosman (North Carolina
ground station) and ATSOC (ATS Operations Cen-
ter) for their invaluable assistance rendered in our
time of need.”

The cooperative NASA/ Alaska/ HEW pro-
gram has been operating only about six weeks out of
a scheduled one year test program. ATS-1 is used for
five hours per night, five days per week, for biomed-
ical consultation between physicians and medical
aides in the field and for medical educational pro-
gramming in cooperation with Stanford University,
Palo Alto, Calif.

It's a technological innova-

facing the country today. But,
then, that's hardly surprising.
Technology is one of the surest
ways of solving social problems.

That's why,at General Elec-

by the impac.t‘they’ll have on

Maybe that's a standard you
should apply to the work you'll
be doing. Whether or not you
ever work at General Electric.

But for versatility, Dynel probably has
no equal. We can make it as soft and

it approaches the strength of steel.

You’ ll ﬁnd it in blankets, work clothes,
automobile upholstery, toys, jewelry. In
carpets, towels, drapes, paint rollers.

But regardless of all its practical uses,
Dynel is most famous for something

Dear Dick:

As I told you, I consider the heading on page 23
of the last issue of “Skyscraper Engineer” a step
beyond the bounds of propriety and to be beyond the
limits of editorial freedom. It seems a clearcut effort
to precolor someone else’s ideas.

The material on pages 30 and 31 would be bene-
fited greatly by some evidence that the people whose
pictures are shown actually said what they are
quoted to have said, and where, when and whether
the quotes are in or out of context.

On page 36 you make statements about “90,000
to 100,000 engineers unemployed today” and go on
to indicate that “forecasts predict a surplus for 10 to
17 years”. No references! No proof! No evidence that
this is anything other than your own idea. Indeed, my
data is vastly different and my perception of the
future vastly different. I enclose a news release from
the Engineer’s Joint Council which is authoritative
and is documented.

I think the above three criticisms add up to poor
journalism or poor editorial policy — whichever you
will.

In spite of my criticisms, I congratulate you on
the layout of the magazine. It is nicely and attrac-
tively assembled.

Very sincerely yours,

H. E. Hoelscher
Professor and Dean

Editor’s note:

In titling Ed Levine’s article (page 23; October,
71) “The Establishment Defends Its Atom”, I gave
the article an unfair slant. I apologise to Ed Levine.
Our artist, Bob Bretz and Layout Editor Don Miller
combined to give an attractive layout to Ed’s article.
I tried to call attention to the fact that because Ed is
employed by a major Nuclear power equipment
manufacturer, Ed Levine has everything to gain by
holding his views whereas Dr. Ernest Sternglass has
everything to lose. Ihonestly didn’t think ‘Establish-
ment” was such a perjurative term. Iprobably need
sensitivity training.

Perhaps we should have included the
journalists “Who, When and Where” in the photo
essay “New Priorities.” We of the staff who were
there tried to use quotes from the speeches that
would serve to paraphrase the speeches and the con-
text of the afternoon. The quotes from John Lindsey,
John Keary and Peter Flaherty at the New Priorities
Rally at Point State Park this Fall are accurate and
do not lose their meaning out of context. Seldom is
emotion and dynamics captured in portrait shots as
Dave Syskowski did in those pictures. The accent
was on the emotion in the faces of these concerned
men, not on their rhetoric.

In my article “Engineering Unemployment”,
every significantfact has a relliable source, but in an
article of this nature footnotes are seldom included.
The June 1971 issue of “Fortune” stated, "The

nation wide total of unemployed engineers, estimated
at 65,000 in April, is expected to reach 80,000 or
possibly 100,000 by midyear.” “Fortune” did not
include footnotes in its article, “The Engineers Are
Redesigning Their Own Profession.”

 

SKYSCRAPER ENG|NEER—DECEMBER, ‘I971

Letters to the Editor

“Forecasts predict a surplus for 10 to 17 years”
paraphrases a direct quote by Dr. Wallace Brode in
the body of my article.

Other references for the “Engineering Unem-
ployment”article are: the information handout, “Job
Applicants in E. and S. Active File — by Area, June
1971 by U.S. Department of Labor Manpower
Administration, U.S. Training and Employment
Service; ” “I180 Mass Scientists Jobless, ” in “Boston
Herald Traveler,” Sept. 2, 1971 by Drew F. Steis,
H.T. Washington Bureau.

The Engineers’.loint Council’s survey was not in
our hands at the time of the last publication. It is in
this issue. We did note that the E.J.C. was conduct-
ing the survey in our October issue. I wrote from a
broad base of information, tried to present the long
range view which was bleak. Idon’t see that the long
range view has changed.

Thank you for your responsible criticism.

It is with extreme pleasure that I, as National Pres-
ident of Pi Delta Epsilon, present you with this honor
which you so richly deserve for outstanding contri-
butions in the field of collegiate journalism.

The example that you have set will help many others
in their endeavors to produce quality publications.
May you continue to do the outstanding job that you
have done in the past and may it be my privilege
again in the not too distant future to present you with
a similar honor.

My best wishes are extended to the staff of the
Skyscraper Engineer for its significant achievement.

National President

Dear “Skyscraper”

This letter is written in support of the article
“Wasted Energies” by Joan Fitzpatrick, which ap-
peared in the fall issue of Skyscraper Engineer. I
consider myself a feminist, in that, I too am pulling
for equality for women, consequently, I feel com-
pelled to make the following comments: 3 cheers for
Joan Fitzpatrick for taking the time and energy and
concern to express her feelings and ideas on the
controversial subject “women’s lib” — in a man’s
magazine yet’

I am strongly against the extremists in this
movement — the militant feminists — because I
don’t feel much can or possibly will be accomplished
by screaming “pig” at every man they see, and at the
very least, any man these radicals think is displaying
male chauvinistic tendencies and/ or characteris-
tics. Whether or not these men actually are behaving
