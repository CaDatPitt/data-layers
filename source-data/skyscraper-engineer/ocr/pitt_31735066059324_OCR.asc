To achieve umbrella-like radar protection, Hughes engineers
have developed systems which position radar beams in space
by electronic, rather than mechanical means. These unique
three—dimensional radar systems are digitally programmed
to instantaneously detect high speed enemy aircraft, even at
low altitude.

Another Hughes system using radar information is the
Hughes Electronic Armament System. This system pilots
high-speed jet interceptors from take-oﬂ‘ to touch down . . .
and through all stages of the intercept. Both radar and infra-
red guidance systems direct today’s most sophisticated air-
to—air guided missile—the Hughes Falcon.

 

Research on the Maser (Microwave Ampliﬁcation by Simulated
Emission of Radiation) is directed towards applications of a
portable, airborne Maser for missiles and aircraft.

THE
TALKIN G

ENGINEER

Your ability to make yourself
understood will determine
your success as an engineer.

BY WILLIAM S. TACEY

When does an engineer talk? Why does he need to?
Who would listen if he did, anyone other than another
engineer? These are common questions asked by young
engineers, especially when someone suggests the im-
portance of their learning to improve their speaking
ability.

The typical American adult communicates by speak-
ing and listening far more often than by reading and
writing. Studies which have been conducted by speech
and psychology professors show that ordinary communi-
cation activities of American adults are divided as fol-
lows: 9% writing, 16% reading, 30% speaking and
45% listening. Through these activities we operate busi-
nesses and build bridges, educate the young and operate
research labs, make love and plan space travel. What-
ever our endeavor, the act of communication is of para-
mount concern. When it fails we may go bankrupt or
have quarrels, get into a ﬁght or look for a new job.
And keep in mind that three-fourths of our communi-
cation time is spent in speaking and listening.

Whatever branch of the profession he belongs to, the
engineer is ﬁrst of all a person and a citizen. In his
family relationships his success depends in large degree
upon his ability to talk and listen. The latter may be
extra important if he is married! His success as head of
his ‘own household may depend on his ability to assert
his authority by stern command, honeyed words or
skillful cajolery, depending upon the circumstances.
What he says and how he says it will help determine
how his children and his dog obey him, or whether
his wife broils steak the way he likes it.

In his profession the engineer may rely on slide rule,
sketch pad and handbook while alone. With his col-
leagues he may make himself understood with signs and
symbols. Yet in our modern society even an engineer
doesn’t spend all of his time with those who speak the

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

same language. Quite possibly neither the office secre-
tary nor the boss ever spent an hour studying Strength
of Materials, Machine Design or Engineering Physics.
Yet both may need to understand the engineer’s views
on many matters from how a letter is to be written
to listening to a report on the probable causes of a pro-
duction line failure.

Even if the engineering department is recognized as
the most important part of a modern corporation, the
most rabid supporter of the department is forced to ad-
mit that it constitutes a relatively small percentage of
the managerial staff. For that reason the engineer ﬁnds
himself communicating orally with many otherwise in-
telligent and well informed people who have to be talk-
cd to as laymen. Here the effects of his college and uni-
versitv liberal arts courses are most notable. He is able
to translate his engineering language into terms which
the former liberal arts or business administration major
may understand.

The professional engineer belongs, perhaps because
of social pressure, more likely because of personal de-
sire to advance in his ﬁeld, to one or more professional
societies. As surely as in government the success of .these
societies depends upon talk. Their effectiveness is mea-
sured by the effectiveness of the deliberation of their of-
ﬁcers and members. Inarticulate members rarely become
officers. They let responsibility for the welfare of the
organization gravitate to the control of the few who may
be willing and able to speak. In contrast, vocal mem-
bers who have ideas and information are the backbone
of any voluntary organization, such as an engineering
society. '

The opportunities for talk in such societies are plenti-
ful and far from being beyond the abilities of any gradu-

ate—-or undergraduate——engineer. Besides the oppor-
tunities for taking part in business meetings or other
discussion periods, there is ample opportunity for “read-
ing papers.” Local, state and national meetings require
programs with statements by students and practitioners
providing the principal basis of discussion. The speaker

worthwhile material is always much in demand.

but presiding officers and discussion leaders as well. The

law is indispensable for the former. He rules with skill
and fairness, making decisions without regard to pre-
judice or bias. With knowledge of parliamentary pro-
cedure he permits the majority to make decisions, but
not without full regard for the minority, no matter how
unpopular or how unreasonable the majority side seems

to be.
As a speaker the engineer posseses more assets than

liabilities. After 16 years of schooling he ﬁnds himself
in a select minority group. Only a tiny percentage of
our population has had such an experience. His educa-
tion has helped him explore the humanities, the social
sciences and the natural sciences. Through his books
and his teachers he has become acquainted with the
great thinkers of all time. If properly advised, he well
may have taken one or more speech courses during his
undergraduate career!

As a well schooled man, the engineer has an above-
average command of his mother tongue. His vocabulary
is large, perhaps a mite heavy on the technical side,
but adequate for his needs. He has become acquainted
with the graphic arts, as well as the performing arts,
and so has access to them and their equipment in the
vocal expression of his ideas.

By the time that a man has been graduated as an
engineer he has had much experience that can aid him
as a speaker. He may have been a school athlete or
musician, a debater or an actor. He probably has held
numerous part-time jobs, from baby-sitting to teaching.
He may have had two years or more of military serv-
ice, not to mention having been a Boy Scout or a De
Molay member. He likely has travelled some abroad, as
well as at home, and understands the intricacies, through
ﬁrst-hand experience, of the jalopy and the television
receiver. From all of these many sources he can draw

13

examples and analogies for enlivening and illuminating
what he has to say.

Doubtless our engineer is in good physical trim. He
is taller and heavier than his father, and with some
exercise he can get himself in suitable physical trim for
18 holes of golf, a few rounds of boxing or a 40 minute
speech. With his knowledge of physiology, diet and per-
sonal hygiene he can keep himself in good health. He is
unlikely" to have any speech impediments. His vocal
apparatus is adequate for his needs, his hands are cap-

‘able of expressing thought and his face can reveal a

gamut of emotion. Thanks to good health also an engi-
neer’s legs are capable of holding him upright, and
though his knees may quiver and shake while he speaks,
no speaker’s knees have ever been known to give way
completely.

While the speaker may complain of “butterﬂies” he
may rest assured that even they, when properly domes-
ticated, are really assets. Someone has said that “butter-
ﬂies in the belly are only bats in the belfry” and
hence, may readily be brought under control. A certa-in
amount of nervousness is common to all speakers and
other performers. It is one’s insurance that he is chal-
lenged and keyed up to do his best. The dry mouth, the
cold hands, shaking knees and excess perspiration all
tend to come under control as the ﬁrst few sentences of
the speech are given, no matter whether it is a com-
mencement address or a proposal to one’s girl friend.
While a speaker’s suffering may be intense before a
speech, is -is relieved by the act of speaking and repeated
experience leads one to look forward past the torment-
ing preliminaries to the pleasures of succeeding in lead-
ing an audience to respond as he wants it to.

Why do engineers not talk well? In some instances the
explanation may be due to a sense of inferiority. Yet
in a study conducted at Pitt by Professor Robert P_.
Newman he found that there was no appreciable dif-
ference between engineering students studying speech
and those from other schools of the University. More
frequently poor speaking is doubtless due to lack of ex-
perience. A small percentage of high schools offer
courses in speech. Not many engineers are required to

14

study speech in college. Because of heavy schedules,
both in school and out, they may not seek student oﬂice,
or take part in other student activities which would
give speech experience.

A better explanation is that few engineers have been
motivated to regard good speaking ability as a neces-
sary one. Readiness with pencil or slide ruleseems to
offer a greater reward. Classes conducted mainly by
the lecture method neither permit nor encourage stu-
dent talk. Students who study engineering seem to pre-
fer athletics to debate as an extra-curricular activity.

 

CLASSES conducted by the lecture method neither permit
nor encourage student talk.

In some way ability to speak seems to be thought of as
God-given, a natural one that just grows and needs no
training. A most frequent excuse given for not getting
instruction in speech is that engineers don’t need it.

Never before was there such a need and demand for
intelligent well-trained speakers. The very existence of
th republic depends upon a well educated and articu-
late citizenry. Although we need specialists as never
before, we need specialists who can be after-hours gen-
eral practitioners. They are needed to man our chruches,
our service clubs, the Red Cross and other elymosynary
institutions. Above all we need an electorate conscious
of our needs and alert to carry on needed discussion as
a means for ﬁnding our best course of action, not only
in deciding whether to build a new high school but
also on how best to get along with Kruschev, Nasser
and their followers.

As future engineers, present-day students may look
forward to a lifet-ime of talk. On the job they may ex-
pect to explain their activities to colleagues, persuade
superiors of the validity of their views and plead with
machine operators to observe safety rules. They will
listen to endless talk by superiors, instructors (for edu-
cation is a continuing process) and prospective cus-
tomers.

The future success of all as professional engineers, as
citizens, as parents and as neighbors depends in large
measure upon the skill which is developed in talking
and listening. I

THE 1959 EMITT AWARDEES

Scholarship, industry, and loyalty are virtues which
in themselves are their own reward. Occasionally they
achieve a more concrete and material value. A few
engineering faculty and student members have set
themselves to the task of rewarding these virtues
through the Engineering and Mines Travel and Train-
ing Award, EMITT.

A review of the preceeding attributes illustrates the
basis on which the committee bases its selection of
awardees. Naturally scholarship is of basic importance.
Industry and application to the profession, aside from
the prescribed ﬁeld of study, was of prime consideration
to the committee. Finally, loyalty to the University, the
Schools of Engineering and Mines, the individual de-
partment, and participation in the activities of these
units, both individually and compo-sitelywas considered.

The seed of EMITT was nurtured in the oﬁices of
the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER in June 1955. Staff
members were familiar with a program known as
IAESTE, the International Association for Exchange
of Students for Technical Experience, through an ex-
change magazine, the PURDUE ENGINEER. With
IAESTE as a foundation, EMITT began to grow.

In September of 1955, E&M Cabinet appointed a
chairman to investigate the possibiltiy of Pitt engineers
participating in the IAESTE program. In December,
three students completed applications for summer em-
ployment. Placements were quickly made in Scotland
and Germany and ﬁnally in May the third aplicant was
placed in Sweden.

To insure the success of the program, E&M Cabinet

William E. Blankenstein,

EMITT awardees. He is

ternities. Mr. Blankenstein

pledged $500 to the awardee to help cover expenses.
Four faculty and three student leaders then began the
task of choosing the ﬁrst awardee, and in the selection
thereof, named the awardee, the Engineering and Mines
Travel and Training Award.

Since the ﬁrst award in 1956, EMITT has developed
in-to two and last year, three awards. This has been
accomplished through the efforts of E&M Cabinet, Dr.
Fitterer, and the Alumni Assocaition which pledged an
additional $700 to cover the expenses of another
awardee. Last summer, Joseph Fitzharris, ChemE ’59,
James Terrill, MetE ’59, and Michael Companian, PE
-’59 traveled and worked .abroad through the assistance
of the EMITT program. In order to beneﬁt both the
University as well as future awardees, an account of
their experiences has been presented verbally in the
engineering seminars and written accounts have ap-
pared in various publications.

Much of the success of this program is due to the
help and advice of the directors of the Nationality
Rooms Program who are well versed in travel abroad
and a wide range of customs and traditions. Conferences
are held with University professors and prominent
educators and civic leaders from abroad, and other
Pitt scholars planning to travel overseas.

With the assurance that the knowledge and experi-
ence of life and labor in a foreign country acquired by
the awardee has and will be communicated to the Uni-
versity, EMITT and SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER pre-
sent the 1958 awardees. I

P|TT'S NEW
RADIO STATION

STUDENT BROADCASTING ASSOCIATION general man-
ager Adrian Cronauer, right, and business manager Dan
Sedye, left. demonstrate some of their taping equipment.

Next month radio station WPGH will sign on for the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. The sign on of the student managed and operated
station will culminate two year’s unrelenting ambition by Pitt's
Student Broadcasting Association.

Here is the story of how the station came about and how it

will operate.

In 1920 an amateur radio station, with the call-
letters 8Y1 was in operation at the University of Pitts-
burgh. Every evening at seven o’clock this station sent
out, in code, the baseball scores of the day. 8Y1 was
operated in the days before commercial radio. A little
while later, the University had a brief connection with
station KDKA. The establishment of 8Y1 put the Uni-
versity in the position of a pioneer in radio develop-
ment, but since the time of those early efforts, there
has never been a “University Radio Station”. Two of
the larger colleges in the city of Pittsburgh have-radio
stations, one of them broadcasts on an FM wave-
length, and the other on the wired-wireless system of
transmission. These two radio stations serve to point out
even mor_e clearly the deﬁciency of our University in
this powerful medium of mass-communication.

At the beginning of the fall 1957 semester a group
of 12 students, realizing the lack of adequate facilities
to train students in the mass-medium, determined to
ﬁll this need. They formed a group which they called
the Student Broadcastinog Association.

Their ﬁrst task was to investigate the situation to
determine what would be the best. type of station for
this particular university. After much consultation
with university officials and correspondence with
“campus stations” at other colleges, they decided upon
the “wired-wireless” method of transmission. The main
reason for this choice is that such a system will limit the
signal to the immediate campus, and thus eliminate any

16

situation wherein the University is held responsible
for a statement made on the air by a student.

The Student Broadcasting Association now needed
recognition from the University before it could proceed
any further. It was found, however, that the Committee
on Recognition of Student Organitions had’ become in-
active, and no new organization had been formed to
assume the duties of the now-defunct COROSO. After
much consultation and discussion, tentative recogni-
tion was given -to the Student Broadcasting Associa-
tion by Dean Biddle, acting as chairman of the old
COROSO, and a member of the Student Affair’s Com-
mittee. The tentative recognition, granted on January
15, 1958, gave the group authority to organize in a
preliminary sort of way, develop a constitution, and
consider how the organization may serve the Univer-
sity.

In a report submitted to the Student Government
Association, the Student Broadcasting Association point-
ed out that the establishment of a radio station will
provide five distinct advantages to the student body—
experience, education, culture, information and en-
tertainment.

The major source of experience which will be open
to student volunteers at the station will be announcing,
music programming, preparation of copy, technical
aspects. of broadcasting, and administration. This ex-
perience, the report points out, will be useful to speech,
music, journalism and writing majors as well as en-

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

gineers and business administration students.

Educationally, the station will benefit the areas of
the social and political sciences, chiefly through such
mediums as round table discussions, the presentations
of prepared papers, and interviews with administrative
personnel on subjects of student interest.

The station will open new horizons for students
culturally through the presentation of classical music,
contemporary music, drama, oration, and religious
programming. Engineers would benefit greatly through
technical experiences gained by working with the
station.

WPGH will operate at 720 on the AM radio dial.
The signal will be carried by the wired-wireless
method. In order to fully understand this arrange-
ment it is ﬁrst necessary to explain how radio, in gen-
eral, works. The output of the main ampliﬁer is fed to
the transmitter where this audio signal is impressed
upon a frequency carrier wave. In AM and FM broad-
casting this moduated carrier is fed to a radiating an-
tenna. From here the signal goes to the antenna of a
radio receiver. The radio receiver separates the car-
rier wave from the audio signal. This is then ampliﬁed
in the radio and fed to the loudspeaker where is emerg-
es as audible sound.

In order to fully understand this question, it is first
necessary to explain how radio in general works. The
output of the main amplifier is fed to the transmitter
where this audio signal is impressed upon a high fre-
quency carrier wave. In AM and FM broadcasting, this
modulated carrier is fed to a radiating antenna. From
here, the signal goes to the antenna of a radio receiver.
The radio receiver separates the carrier wave from the
audio signal. This is then amplified in the radio and
fed to the loudspeaker where it emerges as audible
sound.

In wired-wireless, however, the carrier, instead of
being fed to the usual radiating antenna, is impressed
upon a standard 60-cycle house current power line
which is used as a radiating antenna. Any radio that
is plugged into a wall outlet in buildings in the im-
mediate vicinity of the power line will receive this

 

V  l-‘tr

many affairs such as the crowning of the Homecoming
Queen.

IAN UARY 1959

 

audio signal. The advantage of the system over an
alternate system using Frequency Modulation is the
fact that the wired-wireless system can utilize a much
lower power transmitter for a satisfactory receiving
signal. Where power company transformers are located
on the transferring power lines, jumpers must be used
to send the 60-cycle around the transformer. This is
necessitated by the fact that the power company trans-
formers, through which the carriers must pass before
entering a building will filter through all but the 60-
cycle current and the radio signal will not be allowed
to pass.

Since power lines can be run only in the campus area,
the station will be available to a limited number of
students. This, at ﬁrst, will be only the area surrounding
the Student Union.

Preparation for WPGH has been made well in ad-
vance. For a year now members of the Student Broad-
casting Association have taped football rallies, dances
such as the E&M Fall Social, the Chancellor’s Recep-
tion and Freshmen Week. In addition to this library of
tapes there is also an exchange program with WRCU
of Colgate University and KPFA, an educational, FM
station in California.

The daily programming schedule for WPGH will be
in the morning from seven to nine o’clock and in the
evening from seven to nine. The morning program will
consist of light music and news of the day’s events on
campus. Evening programs will feature news and sports,
jazz and popular music. On Friday evenings there will
be remote broadcasts from dances.

Student interest in the radio station is evident from
the over 200 people who signed up to work with the
Student Broadcasting Association. The Association has
brought in prominent local radio personalities to dis-
cuss news reporting, sports, jazz, popular and classical
music. Technical assistance is received from Steve
Zorbas of television station WQED and Jack Schuitt of
radio station WCNG in Canonsburg.

The man who has organized the SBA is Adrian
Cronauer who is now General Manager of WPGH.
Business Manager is Dan Sedey, and Program Manager,
Edward Benda. Dr. W. L. Swartzbaugh, Dean of Stu-
dents, has headed faculty cooperation.

When WPGH signs on for the ﬁrst time, it will be a
tribute to the fortitude of the Student Broadcasting
Association. All expenses incurred with the establish-
ment of the radio station have been paid for by the
members themselves with the help of a grant from the
Student Government Association. No money has been
given by the University.

What’s ahead for Pitt’s radio station? Obviously,
present facilities can only be temporary. Either the
station will succeed, or it will relapse into its former
ethereal complacency. The only way Pitt will have a
propitious radio station will be with the administration’s
supervision and ﬁnancial aid. The necessity for ﬁnancial
aid is apparent, and the administrative supervision will
serve to keep an unchanging station policy. I

The head of a pin would appear about 47 feet wide if

microanalyzer—the ﬁrst to be used industrially in this
country. U. S. Steel research teams use it to get a better
look at the microstructure of new types of steel. In this
way, they gather more information about the factors
affecting steel quality and performance.

Research like this is typical of U. S. Steel’s leadership

RIDE THE RAPID TRANSIT

An answer to the national problem of metropolitan transportation.

Anyone who is forced to commute or do any amount
of city driving realizes that there is a growing traffic
problem on our highways. With the increasing number
of cars on the nation’s highways, new ways must be
found to move large numbers of people and cars rapidly
and with a minimum of new transport facilities.

Trafﬁc engineers are well aware of this problem and
are trying to ﬁnd new methods of transportation which
will speed the movement of people. The estimated in-
crease in the traflic load on our highways in the space
of ten short years has given added impetus to these
efforts. By 1965, it is thought that more than 80,000,-
000 vehicles will be on the nation’s highways. Placed
bumper to bumper, this many cars.would stretch to the
moon. Our present system of highways is not capable of
being expanded enough to handle this volume of traffic
without major rebuilding and enlargement. Obviously,
the answer lies in new ways of transporting passengers
in and out of the large urban areas.

seems best. This has been denoted the “Rapid Transit
System.” A “Rapid Transit” system would be a net-
work of high speed rail cars running along highways on
current rail tracks from the suburban areas. These cars
would travel at speeds up to 100 miles per hour and
would be able to move as high as 40,000 passengers per
hour along a single rail line. Compare this with the
2000 passengers now moved by autos on a single
expressway alone.

These cars would operate almost entirely automatical-
ly and would require only one operator. A coordinated
system of “Rapid Transit” units would save a metro-
politan area hundreds of millions of dollars by eliminat-
ing the necessity of obtaining expressway right-of-way
and large parking lots. Furthermore, the easy accessibil-
ity of urban areas would create and raise real-estate
values. The outstanding feature of the “Rapid Transit”
theory is that existing railroad rights of way and tracks
could be used.

Traffic congestion would be reduced by the use of

transit station parking lots in the various suburban
areas. Thus, cars would never have to move on the
expressways. “Rapid Transit” appears so attractive that
many cities are now investigating the possibility of put-
ting such a system into operation.

The San Francisco Bay Area has been planning a
system that would link nine counties in the Bay Area.
The plan calls for the construction to take place in
three stages over a 30 year period. Other large cities
such as Chicago and Philadelphia, faced by mounting
traﬂic problems, have begun to look to “Rapid Transit”
for a solution. Even in our own city of Pittsburgh, much
thought has been expended on the feasibility of imple-
menting “Rapid Transit” into our own public trans-
portation system.

Pittsburgh is especially suited for such a system due
to the extensive rail facilities now in operation through
the area. These lines stretch east through Edgewood to
Greensburg, down the Ohio River through Crafton
to Bergettstown, and others go north up the Allegheny
River to Sharpsburg and Aspinwall. Other rails extend
up the Monongahela River through the Southside
through West Elizabeth to Brownsville. As can easily
be seen, the most expensive and troublesome aspect of a
“Rapid Transit” system is already accomplished; suf-
ﬁcient rail lines going to the suburban areas which need
transportation to the city of Pittsburgh.

The Pennsylvania Railroad, which is in possession of
most of these tracks, is very receptive to this new con-
cept of transportation. The only problem that can be
readily discerned is scheduling difficulties of through
trains which would need the tracks used by “Rapid
Transit” cars. But this could easily be solved and is not
an insurmountable problem. About all that remains in
the planning of a new Pittsburgh system of mass trans-
portation is the choice of cars to be used and the ﬁn-
ancial arrangements to be made for track usage.

One suggested unit is the new “Pioneer Suburban”
coach. This high speed, low weight unit would be able
to transport large numbers of people rapidly with a
minimum crew and a low upkeep factor. As far as
track usage is concerned, a public authority would be
created which would lease the tracks. The railroad
could operate the transit system under a maintenance-
equipment arrangement. Thus, no major problems stand
between the plans as fundamental and an operating
“Rapid Transit” system except public acceptance and
opinion. An educated public would certainly ac-
cept this revolutionary idea if the public transportation
system as it stands were fully explained.

Although “Rapid Transit” is just an embryo now, in
the near future it may be pushed to quick maturity by
the urgency of a national trafﬁc problem. When this
happens, Pittsburgh_will probably be a national leader
and model for other cities due to the favorable rail com-
munications now in existence. For the nation as a whole,
however, there seems to be no other solution to our
growing increase in population movement except to a
system that will move large numbers of people quickly
and not use our highways to do it. I

Unmatched Engineering Facilities for Developing
Advanced Flight Propulsion Systems

Operations at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft are essen-
tially those of an engineering and development
organization. As such, an engineering atmosphere
dominates the Work being done, much of which di-
rectly involves laboratory experimentation.

In the past three decades, expansion at Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft has been almost tenfold. In
recent years, greatest emphasis has been on extend-
ing engineering facilities to meet the needs of ad-
vanced research and development programs in ﬂight
propulsion.

Among the Connecticut P&WA facilities are
many that are unequaled in the industry. Thus
today, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft is better prepared
than ever to continue development of the world’s
best aircraft powerplants . . . to probe the propulsion
future . . . to build and test greatly advanced pro-
pulsion systems for coming generations of ﬂight vehi-
cles — in whatever form they take.

 

The Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Laboratory,
operated by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, is situated on a
1,200-acre tract near Middletown. The Laboratory was
specially built for the development of nuclear ﬂight
propulsion systems.

HAMMER, EE ’6O

It would be only emphasizing the evident to say that
four years of schooling beyond high school do not now,
nor ever will constitute an education. This statement is
ultimately the outcome of a discussion or effort to
deﬁne the encompassing title of an “educated” man.

In this very limited negative deﬁnition of education,
there is usually little condensation, but oceans of opin-
ion are at once formulated when a positive deﬁnition is
attempted. The following is but a current within this
ocean . . . my own feelings.

Education is a process. A process beginning with a
question and never culminating but compounding and
increasing in scope with each waking moment of exist-
ence. The only limitation on age for beginning the litany
of education is the ability of one’s mind to question,
evaluate and catalogue the philosophies and facts given
to him. This must be done not for the mere sake of
disagreement but as a tool in formulating and deﬁning
principles of one’s own. When this process of evalua-
tion is done in earnest, as it well must be, it carries with
it potential dangers.

In questioning certain principles and philosophies,
speciﬁcally ones dealing in the theological and moral
content, stark inconsistencies should certainly be seen in
a comparatively young mind questioning beliefs origin-
ated in the mind of a Diety and validated through
thousands of years of practice and teaching. The ques-
tioning process of education must remain on a level
with the ability of the questioning mind.

The mind, the mouth, the eyes and ears are the means
to education. Before questioning and evaluation of a
principle, the principle must ﬁrst be well known. This
is done through the eyes and ears by reading and listen-
ing.

Two terms frequently misused as synonymous are “in-
telligent” and “educated.” Intelligence is never an end,
but merely a means to an end. The degree of intelligence
or ability to learn and comprehend facts in no way
limits the degree of education potentially attainable.
For a person of lesser intelligence, daily experience of
association with others becomes the predominant means
of education. Many deductions and ideas formed from
thorough thought in the mind of one of higher intelli-
gience can, though perhaps over a longer period of time,
be just as readily made through experiences by a more
dull but serious mind. In some cases, higher intelligence
unconsciously becomes a detriment to education. One
skilled in the comprehension or shear memorization of
many facts will very often become lost in a welter of
material trivialities in analyzing a philosophy or idea.

In constantly searching for the deeper or more sub-
versive reasons behind an action or idea, the perfectly

IANUARY 1959

obvious reasons are overlooked. Very subtle thought
should be employed in cases where basic deﬁnitions are
in question, but not in a critical analyzation of every
action of others. The intellectual felony of looking down
upon others for their material or mental deﬁciencies
can never be committed by one who is consciously aware
of the emotions of others. The awareness of what is im-
portant to others can only result from a knowledge and
understanding of the various types and classes of people.

As the eyes and ears play their role in education, the
mind must give more than superﬁcial thought to what
is read and heard. It must dwell on anything accepted
as valid not so much to question its validity but to
realize its limitations in application. One must not set
himself up as judge and jury but moreso as a board
of investigation.

By means of the mouth, education becomes physically
evident to those sharing similar deﬁnitions of education.
It is not used as a means of criticism but only as a means
of providing further food for the mind by communica-
tion with others of similar and dissimilar interests.

The preceeding thoughts are but a thread leading
into the braid of total education. Integrated with prin-
ciples must be the tempering alloy of age and experience
to completely establish a person as “educated.”

Close association with a particular group having
much the same interests and opinions as one’s own is
mental decay. Under a continuous atmosphere of
groups on the school level, ﬁnancial-class level, religious-
interest level or nationality level, a ﬁxation in one’s
own interests and an insentitivity to members outside
these many in-groups inevitably results. It is from here
that the very essence of education can be deﬁned. I feel
that this ambiguous title of “educated” can only be
afforded to a person who through even slight association
with other persons in all walks and levels of living has
become not only aware but quite sensitive to emotions,
tastes and philosophies other than his own. One fact
that soon arises in the mind of the “educated” man is
that tastes and thoughts of others which were once
“weird” and ridiculed are now only different than his
own.

A person intently interested in educating himself
does not ridicule principles or tastes foreign to his own
but examines them more closely and eventually sees
the purpose they perform in their existence. He does
not tailor his‘ own principles and tastes in dictation to
the majority but in agreement with his personal beliefs,

though completely divorced from the majority as they
may be. '

Why diversification makes a better all-around man

DIVERSIFICATION of elfort makes for versatility——and Ver-
satility pays oﬂ in business as well as on the athletic
ﬁeld. We’ve found that to be especially true here at Koppers.

Koppers is a widely diversiﬁed company—-actively en-
gaged in the research and production of a wide range of re-
lated and seemingly unrelated products, such as remarkable
new plastics, jet-engine sound control, wood preservatives,
steel mill processes, dyestuffs, electrostatic precipitators, coal
tar chemicals, anti-oxidants and innumerable others.

Because we are diversiﬁed, our work is interesting. Through
a system of lateral movement, our engineers and manage-
ment personnel are given the opportunity to learn many of
the diverse operations at Koppers. The result? Versatility.

While you are moving laterally at Koppers, you are also
moving up. Your responsibilities are increased. Your ability
is evaluated and re-evaluated. And you are compensated
accordingly.

You don’t have to be with Koppers for 20 years before you

IANUARY 1959

get somewhere. If you have ability, ideas, spark—you’ll move
ahead, regardless of seniority or tenure.

At Koppers, you’ll stand on your own two feet. You’ll get
responsibility, but you’ll also have free rein to do the job the
way you think it should be done. No one will get in your way.

Koppers is a well-established company—a leader in many
ﬁelds. Yet, it’s a forward-looking company, a young man’s
company. Perhaps, your company.

STANDING on one seam of coal the River Queen clears
limestone from an upper coal seam.

Mobile Moneymaker

One of the largest mobile land machines ever built
in the United States, a 2,400-ton shovel .named the
River Queen, has been working for more than a year
in an open pit coal mine in western Kentucky.

Taller than a 13-story building, heavier than a Navy
destroyer and able to take more than 80 tons of rock
and earth in a single bite, this new shovel uncovers two
seams of bituminous coal in the River Queen Mine near
Central City.

The River Queen stands 140 feet high. It is equipped
with a 145-.ft, boom and an 86-ft. dipper handle. en-
abling it to dump rock and earth overburden nearly
300 feet away from the digging point and to stack it
more than 100 feet high. In each pass of its mammoth
dipper, the River Queen excavates enough material to
ﬁll a room 14 x12 x 9 feet.

Despite the River Queen’s size, one operator con-
trols its entire digging operation with two hand levers
and two foot pedals.

Fifteen general electric motors power the shovel—-
eleven for digging and four for propelling. The main
motors are two 1,500-hp AC motor-generator-set, syn-

chronous-driving units. The main functional DC motors
consist of four hoist motors rated at 375-hp each; three.
swing motors at 187%-hp each; two crowd motors at
187%-hp each; and four 200-hp propelling motors.

Monongahela Materpiece

Pittsburgh’s new Fort Pitt Bridge, constructed across
the Monongahela River, was designed around a com-
bination of engineering principles that make it the only
span of its type in the world. Featuring a proﬁle of high
strength steel, this new bridge is regarded by engineers
as the most unique structure in the entire Penn-Lincoln
Parkway System.

To span the entire width of the river in compliance
with navigation requirements, and at the same time
achieve aesthetic appeal, a double-deck, tied-arch struc-
ture was selected. Across each deck will speed four
lanes of one-way trafﬁc. Designed by George S. Rich-
ardson, consulting engineer for the Pennsylvania De-
partment of Highways, the span is the w-orld’s only
double-deck bridge using boxqsections as arch ribs, and
with the tied arch using trusses instead of girders as
ties.

This unusual combination of engineering principles
was both computer and model tested. During the pre-
liminary design stage, a scale model was built and
tested in an e1°fort to establish the behavior of this type
of structure. In the model test, strains were measured by
SR-4 gauges and deﬂections by Ames dials. As a result
of the model test and other studies, it was determined
that a multiple indeterminate analysis was necessary.

In general, the engineers sought to determine stresses
roughly equivalent to those present in an archer’s bow.
In a tied-arch bridge design, the roadway truss acts
as the bowstring to hold the “bow” section of the
bridge arched and to properly distribute loads and
stresses. Fifteen simultaneous equations had to be solv-
ed in the ﬁnal design, fourteen for hangar points and
the ﬁfteenth for horizontal continuity. An electronic
computer was used as an aid in solving these equations.

Stress was an important cost factor in materials spec-
iﬁcations. With design requirements resolved, high
strength steel answered the problem of getting more
stress per dollar where stronger steel was needed, and

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

was speciﬁed where the stress ratio of high strength
steel over structural carbon steel was higher than the
price ratio. Half again as strong as structural carbon
steel, USS Man-Ten Steel was used in the fabrication
and erection by the American Bridge Division. Man-
Ten served a cost savings purpose in erection, and had
structural carbon steel been used in the same place, it
would have been necessary to reinforce the diagonals
until the bridge was completed.

A similar span, the Fort Duquesne Bridge, also fea-
turing extensive use of high strength steel, will be con-
structed over the Allegheny River. The new Duquesne
Bridge will be the major route to areas northwest of
Pittsburgh and will ultimately be connected to the
Pennsylvania Turnpike; whereas, the Fort Pitt Bridge
will serve as a link between the east and west Penn-
Lincoln Parkway.

THE AMERICAN FLAG atop a 74-ton bridge section of
high strength steel marks a festive moment in construction
of the Fort Pitt Bridge.

Magnetic Memory

A new concept in memory devices has emerged from
exploratory work at Bell Telephone Laboratories. This
concept, which has been named the “Twistor”, is ex
pected to make possible memory systems which are sim-
pler to fabricate and more economical to manufacture
than existing systems. Such devices may have extensive
applications in computers and electronic switching sys-
tems where rapid-acccss, high capacity memories are
necessary.

The “Twistor” concept opens the way for the con-

l ANUARY 1959

struction of magnetic memory arrays by merely inter-
weaving horizontal copper wires and vertical magnetic
wires, much as window screen is woven. Such a device
would be similar in appearance to a ferrite core array,
but without the cores, and would operate in much the
same manner. as a core array.

This new concept gets its name “Twistor” from a
characteristic of wire made of magnetic material. Tor-
sion applied to such a wire shifts the preferred direc-
tion of magnetization from a longitudinal to a helical
path. The coincidence of a circular and a longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld can then be used to insert information
into this wire in the form of a polarized helical mag-
netization, and the magnetic wire itself can be used as
a sensing means. A

Investigations are now under way to determine opti-
mum size and composition for the magnetic wires. It
appears that a conductor plated with magnetic materi-
al may have some advantages. Diameters as small as
one-thousandth of an inch appear to be feasible. At
least 10 bits per inch may be stored on such a wire with-
out adverse interaction.

In conventional magnetic core memory devices, con-
ductors must be threaded through the cores to make
up a suitable matrix. When a ferrite sheeet is employed,
either a threading or a plating operation is necessary
to suitably locate the conductors. However, with the
“Twistor”, the ferrite material is completely eliminated
and no threading or plating is necessary. Speed or oper-
ation and output of the “Twistor” are comparable to
ferrite memory systems.

Present indications are that the drive circuits for a
“Twistor” array can be readily transistorized. Thus, a
memory system using the “Twistor” concept will re-
tain all of the advantages of ferrite core or sheet sys-
tems and will be much simpler and more economical

By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock & Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.

Here’s an indication of what's going on at B&W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.

These are but a few of the projects— not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases —- upon which B&W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.

How is the company doing right now? Let’s look at one
line from the Annual Stockholders’ Report.

Vought offers this range
to the young engineer

At Chance Vought the engineer's assign-
ments range from the depths of the ocean to
the farthest reaches of space . . . from hard-
ware operating aboard the Navy's nuclear-
armed submarines to space research vehicles
.still on the boards.

Here the engineer contributes to projects
such as the record-smashing Crusader jet
fighter series . . . the Regulus missiles . . .
and advanced weapons, details of which are
still classiﬁed.

Under the guidance of the Vought engi-
neer, such weapons take shape. He super-
vises critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.

Engineers with many specialties share these
experiences. Today, for example, Vought is
at work on important projects involving:

SPACECRAFT AND ASTRONAUTICS
ADVANCED PROPULSION METHODS
ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE

Vought’s excellent R&D facilities help the
engineer through unexplored areas. And by
teaming up with other specialists against
mutual challenges, the Vought engineer
learns new ﬁelds while advancing in his own.

your training are doing at Vought. . . what
you can expect of a Vought career?

We’ve been told that an engineering graduate is frequently attracted to
companies our size because of his understandable human desire to be “a big
ﬁsh in a little pond”.

While it is true that (numerically speaking) our employee team is small
compared to some, we encounter great diﬁiculty in trying to think of Sikorsky
Aircraft as a “little pond”. Our contributions to the ﬁeld of rotary-winged
aircraft have not been small, nor can our ﬁeld be considered limited or pro-
fessionally conﬁning. Quite the contrary. Sikorsky Aircraft -is the company
which pioneered the modern helicopter; and our ﬁeld today is recognized as
one of the broadest and most challenging in the entire aircraft industry.

And what of the size of the “ﬁsh”?

Unquestionably, that is a matter involving your own indi-
vidual potential for growth. Like any far-sighted company,
we're always willing to talk with “young whales”!

The “Space Age” isn’t going to become a fact
by itself. We engineers have to make it happen.
Here’s what Douglas is doing about it:

We’ve formed a top level engineering council
to bring all our knowledge and experience to
bear on the new problems relating to extreme
high speeds and altitudes and to outer space.

This council is composed of the heads of our six
major engineering divisions and is chairmanned

by our senior engineering vice president. It will
map out the most important goals in aviation and
mobilize the scientiﬁc and engineering resources
required to achieve them.

If you would like to become a part of our stim-

Radiographs of the reactor vessel
welds were made with 21 15,000,000-

Combustion Engineering designed and built this “couldn’t-

surface was machined to dimension
with tolerances that vie with those

General Electric interviews
Dr. Richard Folsom, President of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,

to explore . . .

Teaching-
A Career Opportunity
For the Engineer

Leading educators, statesmen and in-
dustrialists throughout the country are
greatly concerned with the current
shortage of high-caliber graduates who
are seriously considering a career in the
ﬁeld of science or engineering educa-
tion. Consequently, General Electric has
taken this opportunity to explore, with
one of America’s eminent educators, the
opportunities and rewards teaching of-
fers the scientiﬁc or engineering student.

Q. Is there in fact a current and con-
tinuing need for educators in technical
colleges and universities?

A. Colleges and universities providing
scientiﬁc and engineering educational
opportunities are hard pressed at the
present moment to obtain the services
of a sufﬁcient number of well-qualiﬁed
teachers to adequately carry out their
programs. Projected statistical studies
show that this critical need could ex-
tend over the next 15 or 20 years.

Q. Why is this need not being met?

A. There are probably three main rea-
sons. These might be classed under con-
ditions of ﬁnancial return, prestige as-
sociated with the position, and lack
of knowledge and understanding on the
part of the college student of the ad-
vantages and rewards teaching as a
career can afford.

Q. What steps have been taken to make
education a more attractive field to en-
gineering students?

A. Steps are being taken in all areas.
For example, we have seen a great deal
in the newspapers relating educators’
salaries to the importance of the job
they are doing. Indications are that
these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.
Greater professional stature is being
achieved as the general public under-
stands that the youth of our nation is
the most valuable natural resource that
we possess . . . and that those associated
with the education of this youth have

one of the most important assignments
in our country today.

Q. Aside from salary, what rewards can
a career in education offer as opposed
to careers in government or industry?

A. The principal rewards might be free-
dom to pursue your own ideas within
the general framework of the school, in
teaching, research and consulting activ-
ities. As colleges and universities are
normally organized, a man has three
months in the summer time to engage
in activities of his own choice. In addi-
tion, the educator is in direct contact
with students and he has the satisfac-
tion of seeing these students develop
under his direction . . . to see them take
important positions in local and na-
tional affairs.

Q. What preparation should an en-
gineering student undertake for a teach-
ing career?

A. In college, the engineering student
should obtain a basic understanding of
science, engineering science, humanities
and social sciences with some applica-
tions in one or more professional en-
gineering areas. He should have fre-
quent career discussions with faculty
members and his dean. During graduate
work, a desirable activity, the student
should have an opportunity to do some
teaching.

Q. Must an engineering student obtain
advanced degrees before he can teach?

A. It is not absolutely necessary. On the
other hand, without advanced degrees,
advancement in the academic world
would be extremely difficult.

Q. How valuable do you feel industrial
experience is to an engineering or scien-
tific educator?

A. Industrial experience for a science

cENEnAL.ELEcTnIc

educator is desirable; however, with a
senior engineering educator, industrial
experience is a “must”. An ideal en-
gineering educator should have had
enough industrial experience so that he
understands the problems and responsi-
bilities in carrying a project from its
formative stages to successful comple-
tion, including not only the technical
aspects, but the economic and personal
relationships also.

Q. What do you consider to be the op-
timum method by which an educator can
obtain industrial experience?

A. There are many methods. After
completion of graduate school, perhaps
the most beneﬁcial is a limited but in-
tensive work period in industry. Con-
sulting during an academic year or
summer is a helpful activity and is
desirable for older members of the
staff. Younger educators usually need
experience in “living with the job”
rather than providing consultant’s ad-
vice to the responsible individual.

Q. Based on your experience, what per-
sonal characteristics are possessed by
successful professors?

A. Primarily, successful professors have
an excellent and growing knowledge of
their subjects, are interested in people,
and transmit enthusiasm. They have an
ability to explain and impart informa-
tion with ease. They generate ideas and
carry them out because they are de-
voted to developing their ﬁelds of
knowledge. They desire personal free-
dom and action.

Why Lockheed —

Lockheed’s leadership in aircraft is continuing in missiles. The Missile
Systems Division is one of the largest in the industry and its reputation
is attested by the number of high~priority, long-term projects it holds:
the Polaris IRBM, Earth Satellite, Kingﬁsher (Q-5) and the X-7.

To carry out such complex projects, the frontiers of technology in all
areas must be expanded. Lockheed’s laboratories at Sunnyvale and

Palo Alto, California, provide the most advanced equipment for research
and development, including complete test facilities and one of the

most up-to-date computing centers in the nation. Employee beneﬁts

are among the best in the industry.

For those who qualify and desire to continue their education, the
Graduate Study Program enables them to obtain M.S. or Ph.D degrees
at Stanford or the University of California, while employed in their
chosen ﬁelds at Lockheed.

Lockheed Missile Systems Division was recently honored at the ﬁrst
National Missile Industry Conference as “the organization that
contributed most in the past year to the development of the art of
missiles and astronauticsi’

Vilfredo Pareto...on the lifetime of theories

"The logico-experimental sciences are macie up of
a sum of theories which, like living creatures, are
born, live, and clie, the young replacing the old, the
group alone enduring. As with living beings, the
lifetimes of theories vary in length and it is not

always the long-lived ones that contribute most to

the advancement of lmowledge. Faith and meta-
physics aspire to an ultimate, eternal resting-place.
Science lmows that it can attain only provisional.
transitory states. Each theory fulfils its function,
and there is nothing more to aslc of it."

MAN WITH A PROBLEM
Dear Sir:

I have noticed that quite a few
other college engineering magazines
feature a full page picture of a lovely
coed. Why doesn’t SKYSCRAPER
do the same and feature a girl of the
month?

Gus Burti

Why don’t you quit worrying
about girl’s pictures and get yourself
a date.——Ed.

EDITOR TO EDITOR
Dear Sir:

Congratulations on your last issue!
I found it an entertaining balance
of technical and non-technical arti-
cles. .

Although I am a liberal arts stu-
dent whose mechanical ability ex-
tends no further than changing a
typewriter ribbon, I am an avid
reader of SKYSCRAPER ENGI-
NEER.

I have long felt that it is unfor-
tunate that the Pitt student body
considers SKYSCRAPER a maga-
zine solely for engineers. Indeed, it
is a rare article, even of a technical
nature, that is beyond the compre-
hension of the average student. I feel
that is ignorance of the magazine’s
content that has restricted its sale.

I am positive that if the entire
student body was aware of the di-

OWL Editor Christ Gillotti

verse format that SKYSCRAPER

ENGINEER presents, you would

have litle trouble with circulation.
Chris Gillotti
Editor, 1959 OWL

Fellow editor Gillotti brings up a
good point. We must admit that the
manner in which we have approached
the non-engineering student has been
deﬁcient in the past. We hope to
make amends in the future.—Ed.

MORE ON HEARD
Dear Sir:

First Weatherford and the Max-
well. I certainly am looking forward
to the next author for your “Thund-
ering Heard” series.

I think that it is to your credit
that you continue to present this
feature. Who says that the engineer
is only interested in facts and for-
mulae?

G. O’Donnell

THANK YOU
Dear Sir:

“Production Story—1959” which
apeared in last month’s SKY-
SCRAPER ENGINEER contained
many interesting and valuable facts.

Most of these facts, however, are
usually unknown to the average per-
son. For example, the use of Freon
114 in the refrigeration unit, the
time required for the assembly of
such an aircraft and the type of en-
gine that is used in such an aircraft.

Articles like this are not only in-
teresting but also educational. I
would enjoy reading more of this
type of article in future issues of
SKYSCRAPER.

A. Ivanovic

ARS GRATIA ARTIS

Dear Sir:

Who is the staffmember who has
been contributing the imaginative
artwork to SKYSCRAPER ENGI-
NEER this year? The cartoons and

the abstract drawings such as the
line drawing used in connection with
“The Thundering Heard” certainly
add to the quality of -the magazine.

Please tell me who the artist is,
and let’s see more of his work.

T. McMurray

Dear Sir:
More of the line drawings with
your stories, please.

L. Zeiler

The artist is Fran Corey (see pic-
ture) and for more of his work see
“The Talking Engineer” in this is-
sue.—Ed.

COMPLAINT
Dear Sir:

As a member of the petroleum en-
gineering department, I would like
to know why SKYSCRAPER does
not print articles that would be of
interest to the petroleum engineer-
ing student. In fact, I cannot remem-
ber when you presented an article
for either the petroleum or metal-
lurgical engineering department.

I hope that SKYSCRAPER will
not continue to neglect these and
other “forgotten departments.”

J. Ohlinger

I/,'es, reader Ohlinger, we agree
with you, but apparently cannot ﬁnd
anyone willing to write from these
departments.———Ed.
