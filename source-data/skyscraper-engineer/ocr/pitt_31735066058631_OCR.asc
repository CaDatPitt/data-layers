Intramural Sports
Report  

by Dan Clternitslry

Engineering Cabinet has tried to rejuvenate the intra-
mural sports program for engineers this year and has had
some success a.nd some failure.

During the fall term, champions were decided in two
sports, touch football and volleyball. Five departments
ﬁelded teams for the double elimination football tournament.
A quarter ﬁnal game in which the IEs downed the Chem Es
20-0 turned out to be a preview of the championship game.
The IEs came into the title contest unbeaten and unscored
upon in three games, while the Chem Es earned their shot
at the title by rebounding from their loss with three wins in
the loser’s bracket. The title game was closer than their ﬁrst
meeting, but the result was the same with the IEs gaining a
13-7 victory. The EEs (1-2) took third place while the de-
fending champion Civils (0-2) were eliminated in two games.
In the All Campus football tournament, the IEs knocked oﬁ’
Stratford House, the dorm champions, 20-0 before a schedule
mix up forced the IEs to settle for third place.

Volleyball was originally planned to be run on a round
robin schedule, but since only three departments ﬁelded
teams, the championship was decided in a one night tourna-
ment. The Met Es (4-1), after losing a hotly contested and
disputed match 12-13 to the Chem Es, downed the Chem Es
by 15-7 and 15-12 to take the best of three series and the
title. Chem Es (3-2) were runners up and the MEs. (O-4)
took third place.

Three sports are planned for the winter term. Basketball
started in Ianuary with every department except the AEs
entering a team. The nine teams were split into two leagues
with the two ﬁrst place teams to meet to decide the cham-
pionship. League A included the Met Es, IEs, Chem Es,
Frosh #2, and defending champion EEs. League B was
made up of the MES, Frosh #1, Civils, and Pet Es. The two
teams of freshmen engineers mark the first time the freshmen
have competed as a team in engineering intramurals. Basket-
ball was still in progress at press time.

The ﬁnal two sports are newcomers to the engineering
intramural program. A swimming meet is scheduled for

February 12 and a track and ﬁeld meet is slated for March 5.

Criticisms and suggestions about the sports program are
welcomed by sports chairman Dan Chernitsky, c/o Sky-
scraper Enginccr, but what is really hoped for is continued
and improved participation.

Engineering Cabinet
Report

I: y Dan Thompson

The Engineering Student Cabinet continues to promote
projects which will beneﬁt the student in the area of aca-
demic affairs. An examination ﬁle for student use is presently
being established in the engineering library through the
efforts of ESC. This test ﬁle will be a valuable source for
reference and review of course material. Many faculty mem-
bers are contributing their examinations to the ﬁle, but com-
plete cooperation by all the faculty is needed if the ﬁle is to
be truly effective. This project will become increasingly use-
ful to the engineering students as more exams are added to
the ﬁle.

In order to improve communications with each of the
engineering departments, ESC representatives will hold
meetings with their respective department heads. These
meetings will provide the opportunity for students and
faculty administration to discuss topics related to their par-
ticular departments. The meetings will also serve as a positive
step toward narrowing the communication gap between engi-
neering students and department faculty.

Engineering students now are experiencing the advantages
of taking selective courses on a pass-fail basis. This program,
which was promoted by the Engineering Student Cabinet,
provides the engineering students with the opportunity to
select elective courses by considering the educational experi-
ence rather than the effect on his quality point average.
Courses taken on the pass-fail basis carry credit toward grad-
uation, but allow the student to concentrate on the course
material rather than on the course grade.

Thus the Engineering Student Cabinet actively strives to
initiate and enact projects which will be academically ad-
vantageous to the engineering student.

Experimenting in Ultra Cold

A Junior in mechanical engineering writes about

discoveries in Cryogenics.

ABSTRACT

Cryogenics is a branch of physics dealing with the
behavior of natural phenomena below the boiling point of
oxygen. This science concerns temperatures ranging from
0° to 90° Kelvin (about —459.7°F to —300°F). The word “cryo-
genics” comes from a Greek word meaning “creation of icy
cold.” But the Greeks didn’t have any conception of the “icy
cold” researchers are creating in laboratories. Note that the
coldest temperature on earth was approximately 100° below
zero Farenheit (200‘fK), recorded in the Antarctic; this tem-
perature is warm compared with temperatures near absolute
zero. The lowest temperature ever reached is one—millionth
of a degree above absolute zelo.

How Low Temperal-ures are Reached

Liquid helium is most used as a refrigerant at these low
temperatures because scientists claim that at absolute zero,
though this temperature has never been reached, only helium
remains in the liquid state. Liquid hydrogen may also he
used as a coolant in the “warmer” range of Cryogenics and
as an insulator in the extreme cold range.

Temperatures as low as .7°K are obtained from escaping
vapors of helium. These extremely low temperatures are
kept by using charcoal. Cold helium gases are carried to
cooling chambers by pumps. Charcoal, which is noted for its
great powers of adsorption, is added to the pumping system
and the gas adheres easily to its solid surface. Since the prop-
erties of charcoal change at cryogenic temperatures, like so
many other substances, its adsorbing power increases greatly.
At a temperature of l0°K several ounces of charcoal will
collect 908 quarts of helium vapor per second. One—half
ounce of charcoal will keep temperatures at .7°K for over
an hour.

Effects of Super Cold on Malerials

The most noted eﬂect is superconductivity. This is the
property by which some three hundred materials, elements,

compounds, and alloys could carry an electrical current in-
deﬁnitely if the materials are kept at such low temperatures.
At first it was thought that such low temperatures would
lower the resistance of these materials to a low ﬁnite value.
It came as a great surprise to experimenters when they dis-
covered that resistance at cryogenic temperatures becomes
inﬁnitesimal. In fact, in experiments that have been carried
out, these materials appear to have no resistance at all to
the How of electrons.

Why the resistance at low temperatures is so small can be
explained in the following way. The current is transmitted
by the motion of electrons, driven through the metal’s crystal
lattice by the applied voltage. The electrons normally collide
with atoms in the lattice and the impedancerof their motion
constitutes the conductor’s resistance to the current. It is well
known that the resistance increases as the temperature of
the conductor increases because increased temperature causes
the atoms to vibrating in the lattice to oscillate over wider dis-
tances. Traveling in wider paths, these atoms are more likely
to interfere with the flowing electrons and, hence, the
resistance of the material increases. It is important to note
that non-metals behave in quite the opposite way. Since the
electrons are not free to move in non-metals, they must be
shaken loose by thermal vibration, i.e., raising the temperature
of the non-metal. Non metals, therefore become good in-
sulators at cryogenic temperatures.

Initially it was thought that resistance to current would
vanish only if the atoms in the conductor could be stopped
from oscillating. Fortunately, as it was discovered, resistance
vanishes completely and abruptly at several degrees above
absolute zero. For mercury, its superconducting properties
appear at 4.2°K and other metals become superconductors
at various temperatures down to one degree.

At temperatures in the range of cryogenics, a mass of
material behaves like a single giant atom, that is to say,
reduction of a material to a very low temperature creates un-
obstructed orbits for the How of electrons. Two theories ex-
plain the behavior of superconductors. The F rohlich—Bardeen
theory states that at low temperatures the vibrating atoms in
a crystal lattice no- longer obstruct the flow of electrons but,
instead, conduct this How in a wave. The lattice vibration
itself, according to this theory, becomes the agent that makes
the metal superconducting. Heisenberg’s uncertainty prin-
ciple states that the vibrations of atoms can never die away
entirely i.e., even at absolute zero the atoms in a lattice retain
an irreducible motion called zero—point vibration. Together,
these two theories hold that very low temperatures cause the
vibrations of the atoms and the motions of the electrons to be
synchronized. As a result of interaction between the atoms
and the electrons, the electrons reduce their energy and ride
along with the lattice vibration. Resistance, hence, disappears.

Superconductors and Magnetic Fields
Another peculiar property of superconducting metals is

» that they are impervious to a magnetic ﬁeld. Placed between

the poles of a magnet, superconductors completely expel the
ﬁeld so that the lines of magnetic force go around the
material.

A theory on why superconductors repel a magnetic ﬁeld
was formulated by physicist Fritz London. His theory is:
since the free movement of electrons through a superconduct—
ing metal is analogous to the unimpeded motion of electrons
in their orbits around the nucleus of an atom, then an ex—
ternal magnetic ﬁeld fails to penetrate a superconducting
material because it shifts the large orbits of the electrons in
the material so that they set up a counteracting magnetic
ﬁeld of their own.

At ﬁrst it was believed that if a magnetic ﬁeld were out-
side a superconductor, it couldn’t get inside; and if it were

Mighty magnet. A research physicist demonstrates
how three separate coils of a superconducting wire
fit together to form a new 100.000 gauss super con-
ducting magnet. This magnet can be powered by an
automobile battery. which is disconnected entirely
once superconducting currents flow in the magnet
coils.

inside a metal cooled to superconductivity, it would be
trapped inside. A simple experiment showed that the
magnetic ﬁeld was pushed out. Perfect conductivity alone
could not explain this. Thus a metal in the superconducting
state has two properties: perfect conductivity and perfect
diamagnetism. Diamagnetism is a property of materials that
tends to oppose an applied magnetic ﬁeld. Most non-ferrous
materials are slightly diamagnetic due to the electrons in the
orbits around the atoms in the material. Since superconduct-
ing electrons are merely a larger example of orbital electrons,
they are also diamagnetic.

l3

A magnetic ﬁeld does penetrate a little way into the
superconductor — just far enough so that it intersects with
the superconducting electrons in the surface of the metal.
The moving electrons in the surface are forced by the
magnetic ﬁeld and superconducting state into tight orbits in
the surface layers. The circulating currents create a secondary
magnetic ﬁeld that just cancels the applied magnetic ﬁeld
that would have appeared inside the superconductor. The
secondary magnetic ﬁeld is equal to and opposite to the
applied ﬁeld and a. repulsive force is set up between the
superconductor and the source of the magnetic ﬁeld.

The ability of a superconductor to repulse magnetic ﬁelds
allows us to attain true, stable levitation of appreciable
masses. Although there is a theorem that’ states that stable
levitation cannot be attained with static electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, it does not.apply to diamagnetic substances and since
the superconductor has perfect diamagnetism, it is easy to
dream up conﬁgurations and devices using levitated super—
conductors or permanent magnets.

Magnetism applied to a superconducting metal causes it
to revert back to its normal resistive state i.e. it has the
resistance that it had before it became a superconductor. If a
superconductor is conducting an electric current which is
being increased there is a certain point of current where the
magnetic ﬁeld created by the current will cause it to revert
back to its normal resistive state. The compound, niobium
tin “Nb3 Sn", when in the superconducting state, will carry
more current than any other known substance before becom-
ing normally resistive.

At these ultracold temperatures only certain metals be-
come superconductive. Other metals that are not super—
conductive at these temperatures can be made so by bring-
ing a thin ﬁlm of a metal not normally superconductive in
contact with a superconducting metal ﬁlm at the proper
temperature. The assembly of these two metals in Contact
causes them to behave as a unit having superconducting
properties of its own.

Odd Behavior of Ordinary Ma+eria|s

The changes in the behavior of a substance at low tem-
peratures are remarkable. Thin rubber tubing and sheet iron
will break into bits under a sharp hammer blow. A hollow

rubber ball shatters. A solid rubber ball will not bounce
when frozen but will regain elasticity as it warms up. A
piece of sponge can be sawed in two, like a block of wood.
At these low temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen resemble
white sand. Lead coils become as springy as steel. Low-
carbon steel is ﬁve times stronger than at room temperature.
Uses

There are many uses of this science. Some of these uses
are in computer memories, missiles, stronger magnets, and
switches. In most devices cryogenics can be used to make a
substance superconductive to handle extremely tiny currents
or signals with no loss of energy.

One of the most important uses is the cryotron which
may be used in place of vacuum tubes or transistors, and has
led to improved computers. A crytron is a low temperature
switching device. Many calculations are needed to solve
problems in computers (sometimes a trillion computations)
and they are becoming more difficult. A computer must
make a billion calculations per second in order to ﬁnish
such a problem in reasonable time. Computers must also be
of high speed and small size (less than a foot square).
Since electricity travels one foot in less than a billionth of a
second, the signals will travel between the switches and won’t
be worked upon. This requirement is ideal for supercon-
ductors because the cooling problem is easily solved and the
new switches and signal gates made of evaporated metal ﬁlms
on glass (cryotrons) have the necessary operating speeds.

The Cryofron

A cryotron can be explained as a simple signal gate. Sup-
pose there is a series of impulses passing through a large tin
strip and it must be turned off for a given time with another
current. Since tin has a low transition temperature, it re-
quires only a small magnetic ﬁeld to transform it into the
normal state. To turn off the How of pulses passing through
the tin strip a “gate-off” signal is sent through the lead strip.
The current passing through the lead strip creates a magnetic
ﬁeld that is sufficiently strong to cause the tin to revert to
the normal state. Since the tin strip is a very thin evaporated
ﬁlm, the resistance in the normal state is very high and the
pulses are stopped. Lead is used as a control because its
transition temperature is higher than tin so it is less sus-
ceptible to the effect of magnetic ﬁelds.

When the control current is removed, the tin strip rapidly
reverts to the superconducting state and the pulses are once
again passed through the tin strip. A small current controls
a large current in that the current through the signal strip
can be made much larger than the current through the
control strip.

Powerful Mognefs

Cryogenics is used in making more powerful magnets
with superconductors. At ﬁrst it was thought that if a coil
were wound thousands of times with superconducting wire,
then a current would be started until the magnetic ﬁeld is
built up in the coil. If the two ends of the coil were joined
the current would continue to How and the magnet could
be used’ without expending any energy at all except for
cooling.

For a long time, the highest possible magnetic ﬁeld that
could be tolerated by a superconductor before it went into
the normal state was 10,000 gauss. But the new compound
Nb3Sn, under special conductivity of preparations, could
carry current even under ﬁelds as high as 200,000 gauss.
Newer materials show promise that one day superconducting
magnets may generate a megagauss.

Conclusion

Large electromagnets that are not superconducting have
magnetic ﬁelds of 2,000 gauss. But with magnets as power-
ful as the Nb3Sn magnet, scientists may be able to squeeze
steel rods like tubes of toothpaste and to perform forging
operations that are as yet impossible. These strong magnetic
ﬁelds can also be used to control moving charged particles,
to contain high temperature plasma in fusion power
machines ,and to deflect deadly radiation contained in the
Va.n Allen Belt. Magnetic ﬁelds at superconducting tem-
peratures may be used to continue fusion reactions if the
goal of harnessing the H—bomb reaction for peaceful purposes
ever becomes a reality. Thus cryogenics is increasing in im-
portance very rapidly. The great number of uses of this
science make it very valuable and many more uses will be
found because of its peculiar properties.

How anoul1n9 _
cubic miles III II?

Furnishing elbow room for new ideas is
an old story at the Electric Boat Division
of General Dynamics. It's been that way
ever since we built the first submarine
for the Navy in 1900. Then, as _now, the
only limit on performance is the level of
technology. And today, as we adapt new
space-age techniques to undersea ex-
ploration, the entire ocean—one billion
cubic miles—is fast becoming a vast
area of new technological opportunity.

And it's not just the technology, though
of course you'll be involved in state-of-
the—art developments in electronics, nu-
clear propulsion, structural dynamics,
metallurgy, to name a few. Equally im-
portant is the systems approach we're
applying to all phases of submarine con-
struction, from original concept, through
procurement, construction, inventory
control, all the way through to testing
and sea trials.

We have a lot to show for it. Our research
sub, STAR lll, can already gather data at

depths of up to 2,000 feet. The AUTEC I
and ALVIN ll, now in construction, are de-
signed to operate at 6,500 feet and will
be completely equipped with the most
sophisticated equipment including two
bow manipulators, lights, c|osed—circuit
TV, cameras, obstacle avoidance sonar,
fathometer and communications sys-
tems. And in addition, we are designing
and building the NR-l, the world's first nu-
clear powered research submarine.

So it's no wonder that Electric Boat Div-
ision is the acknowledged specialist for
all phases of submarine building, over-
haul and repair. And that we've been as-
signed to develop the submarine design
that all other yards will be following when
converting Polaris submarines for Posei-
don operation.

Speaking of development, we have a
“people development" program designed
to spot your special capabilities—to help
you move, to progress, even to change
your product area or technical discipline
if that's what it takes to increase the
certainty of your success. Part of it,
is one of the most extensive and far-
sighted educational, study and post
graduate programs ever offered by any
company, to encourage continued aca-
demic proficiency. Hundreds of people
in our Division participate every year.

Living and working in Groton, Connecti-
cut is a rewarding experience in itself.
For in this unique nautical community
you are not only close to the men and
women who build and sail submarines,
but to all the abundant pleasures of the
sea. (Not that you're far from more met-
ropolitan pleasures if that's your prefer-
ence).

Degrees required : BS or advanced degree
in naval architecture or aeronautical,
chemical, civil, electrical, industrial,
management, marine, mechanical and
metallurgical engineering. Positions are
also available for graduate students in
math, physics, psychology and applied
mechanics.

If you are earning one of these degrees
and would like to make a contribution to
the new aqua-space technologies we're
developing here, make a date through
your Placement Office to see our repre-
sentative. Or write for a new informative
brochure to Mr. Donald K. Whynott.

RESEARCH AT PITT

Doctor Rafael G. Quimpo is an Assistant Professor of
Civil .En gineerin g here at Pitt. The research project for

National Science Foundation and a paper covering this pro»
ject was published in the Iournal of the Hydraulics Division,
American Society of Civil Engineers.

The Stochastic Prediction of Streamflow

Introduction

An important facet in the planning of a water resource
project is the prediction of future water supply, the most
common indicators of which are rainfall and runoff. The use
of the latter seems to ‘be more practical since it is less sus-
ceptible to intermediate processes which A could radically
change ﬁnal quantitative estimates of available water and
since at the same time, it admits to facility in measurement.
With the ever increasing demand for water, estimates of its
availability expressed in lumped quantities, averaged over a
month or more, are no longer sufficient. Speciﬁcation of
river runoff in terms of mean annual flow of How duration
is gradually giving way to description of How in terms of its
time sequence and distribution, the knowledge of which
allows for better regulation and control of water, e.g., by
storage reservoirs. This need for better quantitative esti-
mates is the premise for this research.

Runoff from a basin is the combined effect of variables
which may be deterministic or stochastic in nature. The in-
teraction of these variables has thus far deﬁed a complete
mathematical analysis. The engineer, who has to make a
projected estimate of How must therefore rely on statistical
techniques.

To be able, to closely examine the runoff process, ideally
one requires a continuous record of the process. Although
streamﬂow has been measured with continuous recorders,
problems in ‘information retrieval has limited published data
to equi-spaced records of average values. Records of mean
daily flows were used in this study.

A chronological record of a process is called a time series.
The statistical analysis of a continuous time series may be
approached as a study of a random function of time. If X
represents the runoff variable, then  is a probabilistic
representation of the runoff process. It should be noted that
the use of probability theory implies an ensemble of a set of
time series. Further, the use of statistics implies that the
time variation of the statistical properties of the process is
known.

featuring Dr. Ouimpo

The General Model

Consider a record of the runoff process taken at equal
intervals of time and denote it by X(t), the discrete equiva-
lent of X(t). Under certain assumptions relating to time
variation and ensemble properties, a general heuristic model
which may be used to descri'be such a sequence is

Xtt) = T(t) +P(t)+ e (H

where T(t) is a trend component, P(t) is a periodic or
cyclic component, and e(t) is a probabilistic or stochastic
component.

In streamflow records studied thus far, the trend’ was
found to be insigniﬁcant so that the burden of research con-
stituted in the determination of the proper model for P(t),
the periodic component; and e(t), the stochastic co_mponent.
The periodic component was detected by analyzing the
variance spectrum of the process.- The variance spectrum
identiﬁes the cycles comprising the periodic component of
X(t). Typical of the spectra obtained from records investi-
gated is shown in Fig. 1. After the cycles were identiﬁed,
they were isolated by subtracting their harmonic representa-
tions from the original series thus leaving the stochastic re-
mainder series e(t). The effect of successive subtraction of
these cycles on the correlograms of the residual series are

21

shown in Fig. 2. The modelling of e(t) was done by ﬁtting
Markov schemes of autoregression such that they satisfy cer-
tain variance identities. With all the components isolated, it
just became a matter of synthesizing components to recon-
struct the process.

Perspective
The implication of the derived model in engineering de-
sign are immediately apparent. If the inflows into a multi-
purpose reservoir can be predicted within statistical limits,
problems of allocation of water resources are better resolved.

In water quality management, exploratory investigations
are presently being done on how the stochastic prediction of
streamﬂow could be used to optimize sewage release rates
into streams. While the statistical model has been derived
using a digital computer, the model could be tied in with
an analog simulating stream behaviour. The use of a hybrid
computer in this aspect of the problem is being explored.

ANNOUNCING . . .

ENGINEERS’ WEEK 1968

Engineers’ Week is held each year during the week of
St. Patrick’s Day. This year, Engineers’ Week will be from
Wednesday, March 13 to Saturday, March 16. It is a function
of the Engineering Cabinet and is planned and directed by
the Central Planning Committee. The theme for this year is:
Engineering and the Developing Nation. The reason behind
the choice of. this theme is very simple. For the past ten years
the United States and other world powers have invested
billions of dollars in newly developing countries in order to
improve their way of life. Even more important than our
monetary investment, we have given these nations our tech-
nical help. We have designed, built and ran their pla.nts, but

even more important we have taught the citizens of these
nations how to 'do these things. The developing nations have
been a new and exciting challenge for engineering tech-
nology. It is the challenge of trying to help solve the prob-
lems of these countries that we, the engineers at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, are getting involved in by choosing Engi-
neering and the Developing Nation as the theme for our
displays in Engineers’ Week 1968.

Although the displays are an important part of Engineers’
Week, there are many other events that take place. Here is
a tentative calendar for the week:

SATURDAY. MARCH |6—8 P.M.

This year, for the first time in the history of Engineers’
Week, freshmen engineers will compete as a separate de-
partment. One of the reasons for permitting freshmen to
compete as a separate department is to increase their partici-
pation in Engineers’ Week. In the past, few freshmen have
taken an active part in the Weeks’ activities.

Engineers’ Week is planned and directed by Central
Planning Committee. It is the committee’s job to make rules,
to arrange the various events, and to take care of any prob-
lems that may arise during the week. Central Planning
Committee consists of two members from each department
and a chairman. The names of the members are as follows:

Chairman: Albert Rocchini

William Piper Carl Pavetto
Richard Freedman Bob Kerin
Herbert Kosstrin Mike Neesham
Bernadette Onda Gerry Innocenti
Richard Herskowitz Neil Newton
David S. Brown Max Pepper
Paul Kezmarsky Ron Schoff

Engineers’ Week may be the function of Engineering
Cabinet and directed and planned by Central Planning
Committee, but it will only be a success if it is supported by
all the engineers at Pitt.

“I Wanted to Work for
a small company. It may

sound crazy, but that’s
Why I Went with IBM!’

“When I was in school, I dreaded the thought
of working ‘for some huge company where I'd
be just another number," says IBM’s Jim Hamil-
ton. (Jim, who has a B.S. in E1ectrical~Engineering,
is a Systems Engineering Manager in Marketing.)

“At the same time, I knew there were deﬁnite
advantages in working for a large ﬁrm. So as I inter-
viewed each company, I checked into the degree of 
individuality I could expect there. 

“One of the main reasons I picked IBM was their de- 
centralization. They’ve got over 300 locations throughout the
country. Which to me means a big company with a small-
company atmosphere."

IBM's small team concept

“Actually, there's plenty of decentralization even within each
location. For instance, in science and engineering, they-use a
small team concept. It means, no matter how large the proj-
ect, you work individually or as part of a small team—about
four or ﬁve people.

"In marketing, I was pretty much my own boss even
before I became a manager. As a systems engineer, it's up to
you to ﬁnd the solution to a customer's problem, and
then see it's carried out in the optimum way. You
work with the customer every step of the way.”

There’s a lot more to the IBM story than Jim has
mentioned.

Among The Finest

A look at four of Pittsburgh’s
most remarkably modern buildings.

INTRODUCTION

Pittsburgh began as a fort in 1754. During the next 10
years it belonged to Virginia militamen, to the French, and
then to the British. It was first called Fort Duquesne, then
Fort Pitt, and ﬁnally in 1764 the town of Pittsburgh was
founded (23 years before the University of Pittsburgh was
founded.)

After the Revolutionary War Pittsburgh was known as
the “Gateway to the West” because it was such an ideal
starting point for travelers. In its growth and development
in iron, steel, and aluminum, Pittsburgh acquired such nick-
names as “Iron City,” “Steel City,” and “Arsenal of the
World” which were testimonials to the fact that during
World War II, Pittsburgh produced nearly as much steel
as Germany and Japan combined.

But in the 40’s another name had been associated with
Pittsburgh, that being ‘-‘Smokey City.” The smoke produced
from the factories and mills was a serious problem.

In 1946 an action program was started by Pittsburgh
civic and industrial leaders; the start of Pittsburgh’s renais-
sance. Smoke control was put into effect, new dams ap-
peared, a network of bridges and highways began to take
form, old buildings were torn down, and the new buildings
of Pittsburgh began to rise. Nearly 3 billion dollars has been
poured into this dynamic rebirth and many millions more
will yet be used to make Pittsburgh one of the most beauti-
ful cities in the world.

There are many new buildings in Pittsburgh but the four
I have written about (two which are already completed and
in use, a third which may be in use by the time of this
publication, and a fourth which will be completed early in
1970) are prime examples of the innovations in design, con-
struction, and beauty of the buildings of Pittsburgh’s ever-
continuing renaissance.

THE CIVIC AUDITORIUM

The central structure in the redevelopment of Pittsburgh's
Lower Hill district is the Civic Arena. The “Big Dome,” as
it is sometimes called, gave Pittsburgh :1 “ﬁrst” because of
its retractable roof. It is an auditorium that can let its
audience enjoy a performance either under its roof or under
the stars by the mere Hick of a switch.

The cost of the Arena was $20 million, which was
ﬁnanced by a combination of private and public funds in-
cluding outright grants from City of Pittsburgh and County
of Allegheny, and it was one of the best investments ever
made. Because of its multi—purpose structure, the Arena
can accommodate Civic Light Opera, sports, such as basket-
ball, hockey, boxing, wrestling, roller derby, etc; and trade
shows, conventions and expositions. The seating for some
of these events is as follows: 10,700 for hockey matches;
12,200 for basketball; 10,000 for ice shows; 7,200 for theatrical

performances, and the total capacity is 13,600 making it one
of the largest auditorium capacities in the US.

But the most important aspect of the Arena is its roof.
It has the world’s largest retractable dome. The roof has no
interior supports but is supported by a huge steel cantilever.
This enormous roof is divided radially into eight leaves, two
of which are stationary, and six of which rotate about a pin
at the top as they roll along curved rails laid on a reinforced
concrete ring girder. The dome is constructed to open or
close in 21/2 minutes. It is nearly circular in plan, 415 feet
in diameter and, at center, 136 feet high (as tall as a 12-story
building).

The six movable leaves of the dome differ slightly in size
so that they may be nested. Sheets of 20- and 22-gauge
stainless steel have been fabricated into trapezoidal shapes
to form the sheath for the roof leaves. Approximately
170,000 square feet of stainless steel (about 4 acres) cover the

eight leaves, and some 7,800 separate pieces of stainless steel,
weighing between 180 and 190 tons, are affixed to the dome
in varying sizes.

Taking a cross section of the leaves, the structural mem-
bers are 30-inch wide flange beams. On the top face of the
beam is an H. H. Robertson decking. Immediately above the

_ decking is a vinyl vapor seal, two inches of rigid ﬁber glass

board insulation and building paper over the board, then the
stainless steel sheathing. On the interior face of the leaves
there is a perforated steel acoustical panel covering a ﬁber
glass back that acts as a sound absorption panel.

The cantilever frame is the main support for the retracted
leaves. Flanked by two permanent leaves, above which the
other six leaves stack when nested, the cantilever rises more
than 110 feet above its abutment and projects 205 feet over
the Auditorium. The 206-foot arching cantilever consists of
a curved box girder approximately eight feet wide, and
176" deep, with a system of tie—back anchorage members ex-
tending from the bottom of the anchorage point near the
ground line almost to the top of the cantilever girder. In its
interior, the box girder carries electrical wiring for control
and operation of the roof and for the lighting and sound
systems.

The ring girder is continuous over four 26-foot spans. It
is supported on 48 concrete A-frames and banked at a 13-
degree angle to resist the thrust of the leaves.

There are many other qualiﬁcations that make “the
Arena” one of the best auditoriums in the U.S. Truly it is
one of Pittsburgh’s greatest achievements.

IBM BUILDING

The “ﬁrst truly contemporary steel office building in the
world” wears its structural steel framework on the outside.
This new architectural concept is a marked departure from
the conventional post and beam curtain wall buildings of
recent years.

Relying fully on the family of constructional steels ‘avail—
able for architectural expression, ﬁve different steels represent-
ing four strength levels were combined in the IBM Building.
Included are 100,000 psi minimum yield strength construc-
tional alloy steels, super—strong USS “T—l,” and “T-1” type A,
being used for the ﬁrst time in major construction.

The steels were designed into the structure in a way to
make every pound work at its efﬁcient best, therefore re-
ducing the building costs. This unique “inside—out” design
is in the form of a diagonal crisscross grid system sheathed
in stainless steel. These truss walls carry all wind and wall
loads, and contributory floor loads. The nature of the steel
frame exterior is designed to direct all building loads around
the building and downward to culminate at two points of
ground contact on each side at the base of the structure.
Thus, there are no signiﬁcant flexural stresses in the walls,
and all main str_u_ctural members are in either compression or
tension. A central core on the rectangular-shaped building
carries all inner floor, wall, and elevator loads, thus eliminat-
ing spandrel beams and all vertical columns from the skin to
the core — clear spans of 54 and 27 feet.

Each side of the building is erected in the form of a giant
vertical truss. Since the sides are load—bearing, they were

41

- started ahead of the floors, supported by temporary bracing

up to about the ﬁfth story height. The grid system con—
sists of pairs of unequal let angles. It is coated with a ﬁre
prooﬁng asbestos plaster and sheathed with rigidized, tex-
tured and design strengthened stainless steel.

The modern trend toward combining steels of varying
strength levels in building construction is based on speciﬁc
economic and aesthetic advantages. The super—strong “T—1”
steels, being used for the ﬁrst time in building construction,
were used inthe lower stories where the stresses are greatest:

below—ground columns of “T—1” and above—ground members
of “T—1” type A.

Having a 50,000 psi minimum yield point, USS Tri-Ten
(A441) steel was used for the mid—structure construction, and
for the upper stories, where the stresses are lighter, recently
developed A36 carbon steel with a 36,000 psi yield point was
used. Miscellaneous applications of A7 carbon steel rounds
out the ﬁve—steel combination.

This beautiful building was completed in 1963. When
entering Pittsburgh from the Fort Pitt Bridge or traveling
along the Parkway beside the Golden Triangle, the IBM
Building stands out from the rest of Pittsburgh because of
its unique, 21st century design.

ONE OLIVER PLAZA

One Oliver Plaza, Pittsburgh’s newest ofﬁce building, will
rise more than 500 feet in unbroken vertical planes, dominat-
ing the center of the downtown area. This 39—story building
will be sheathed in striking matte—ﬁnished, dark toned metal

and harmonizing solar bronze glare-reducing glass.

lsurrounded by a beautiful landscaped plaza, the building’s
main entrance will face Sixth Avenue, with underground

parking entrances on Wood Street‘ and Liberty Avenue.

The site of One Oliver Plaza is located in an old river

bed, and the amount of soil excavated from this site was about
45,000 cubic yards. At its deepest point the foundation is
forty feet below street level.

Because there were buildings still standing next to the
foundation site and the foundation was to be deeper than
the other buildings’, the foundation had to be “underpinned.”
Underpinning is one of the most delicate operations in the
construction industry. A hole was dug down a few feet
beside the footer of the existing building, and then a tunnel
was dug sideways until it was under the footer, and ﬁnally
a hole about two feet by four feet was dug straight down
twenty-ﬁve feet; this hole was then ﬁlled with cement. There
were 36 of these piers built.

.4

After the skelton of the building was erected, the curtain
wall (outer metal and glass) was put up. The main members
of the frame are mullions and muntins and they are bolted
to the anchors which are welded to the supporting members.
Mullions are vertical members and run the full length of the
building. They extend eight inches from the building and
when the curtain wall is completed, the mullions will create
a ribbed effect up the outside of the building. Muntins are
the horizontal members of the curtain wall and can be seen
at each floor level, attached to and spanning from mullion
to mullion. The mullions and muntins are a special new
steel, called Mayari-R. A disadvantage of this steel is that it
will have rust running all over it for about one year, there—
fore the curtain wall steel will be painted (a deep bronze
color.)

The basement, the 13th, and the 38th and the 39th floors
will be mechanical floors housing heat exchangers, boiler
plants and refrigeration fans. The 13th floor will be a little
extra special since it will also house an analog type computer
for controlling the elevators.

One Oliver Plaza will have 16 passenger elevators, the
slowest traveling 500 feet per minute and the fastest 1200
feet per minute. These elevators are about the safest in the
world. For example, six cables (5/8" thick steel rope) are
used to haul the cab, whereas only one is needed. If the cab
should reach a higher than normal speed, the power is
turned off automatically and two safety clamps grab the
rails, sliding the cab to a safe stop. And if everything else
fails and the cab should reach the pit, there is an hydraulical
buffer to catch the cab and ease it to rest.

There are many other fine features of this building, and
it will be one of the most distinctive office buildings in

Pittsburgh for years to come.

The new U. S. S+eel Building second largesf office
building in 1-he world and 1-he fallesf in Piflsburgh.
—Courl'esy U. S. Sl'eel

UNITED STATES STEEL BUILDING

The second largest office building in the world is now
being erected in downtown Pittsburgh. It is located by the
Bigelow and Crosstown Boulevard forming a pivot point
between the business core of the city and the Civic Arena.
Completion date is now set for early 1970.

The building will be 64 stories high, 841 feet tall above

the paved plaza. It will have a trz'angztl_ur base of 41,164
square feet which occupies 36% of the site. The total area
relating to the ofiice building is" about 2,900,000 square feet

plus about 180,000 square feet of garage area — — - approxi-
mately 73 acres of building.

This new building will offer a spectacular view. From
the restaurant on the 62nd floor, Pittsburghers will be able,
for the ﬁrst time, to see over the hills for a distance of 50
miles. Mt. Lebanon, Brentwood and Whitehall, long con-
cealed by Mt. Washington, will be visi'ble from the building.
On a clear day, it will be possible to see the County Airport,
South and North Parks, and even Ambridge, Aliquippa, and
“McKees Rocks.”

An equilateral triangle with 16-2-foot—long sides, the U.S.S.
Building has 18 exposed supporting steel columns, six for
each side. These columns will be of USS COR—TEN steel, a
special steel which will be left bare and unpainted, and will
weather to a deep russet color. They will be 36 inches deep,
24 inches wide, and positioned three feet in front of the
building wall, thus providing an architectural expression of
steel structure.

Almost all columns in buildings are ﬁreproofed by ﬁlling
concrete around the columns, but these 18 columns will have
special ﬁreprooﬁng. These columns will be ﬁlled with water
and a potassium carbonate, anti—freeze solution. Each column
will be divided into four chambers and a piping system has
been developed which will set up gravity circulation of the
liquid whenever a portion of the exterior column is exposed
to high temperature, as in the case of ﬁre, thereby internally
cooling the column section and keeping its surface tempera-

44

—Cour+esy U. S. Sfeel

tures within safe limits. It is estimated that approximately
500,000 gallons of water will be used to ﬁll the column
protecting system.

In very tall buildings, the most important function of the
structural system is to provide SLlﬂ'lCiCI1t lateral strength and
stiffness to resist the driving force of the winds. To achieve
this necessary resistance to wind forces, a large-scale primary
system composed of a triangular braced shell cantilevers
from the foundations. If this shell were required to resist
lateral loads unaided by any other elements of the structural
system, it would behave as a cantilever curving further and
further from the vertical as the height increases. However,
at the top of the building, a space frame ties the shell to the
exterior columns. This system of “hat" develops the tension
and compression capabilities of the exterior columns and
mobilizes the load in these columns to aid in the resistance
to lateral movements, thus enabling the triangular shell to
rise far higher that would have been possible using con-
ventional techniques.

Atop the building will be a heliport designed for possible
future use by vertical take—oH (VTO) aircraft, but will
initially be used by conventional helicopters.

The U.S.S. Building will be a great symbol representing
the Steel Capital of the world; “The steel triangle in the
golden triangle.” Pittsburgh truly is becoming one of the
most beautiful cities in the world.

 be this kind of excitement in engineering?

You check your bindings again, adjust your goggles . . . then push off
in a fast schuss down the ﬁrst leg, skis hissing against the powdered
snow. This is the excitement of skiing — pitting your experience and
skill against speed and the variables of a new, fast-dropping trail.*

Can there be a corresponding excitement in professional terms?

An exhilaration in matching your engineering talent against new
technologies? We think so. And we feel you can experience this type of
professional excitement at Xerox.

We’re working on new concepts in. imaging and data handling and
graphic arts and education and many other areas. You’ve seen the
massive impact of past Xerox technical achievements on business and
industry. You can understand why, in the past three years alone,

we’ve put $100 million into research and development. And why the
climate for technical people here has to be experienced to be appreciated.

So if you feel that an engineering career should include a high level of
professional excitement and stimulation, look into what Xerox has to
offer. Your degree in Engineering or Science can qualify you for some
intriguing openings in fundamental and applied research,

engineering, manufacturing and programming.

Depends on the giant. Actually, some giants are just regular
kinds of guys. Except bigger.

And that can be an advantage.

How? Well, for one thing, you‘ve got more going for
you. Take Ford Motor Company. A giant in an exciting
and vital business. Thinking giant thoughts. About develop»
ing Mustang. Cougar. A city car for the future.

Come to work for this giant and you’ll begin to think
like one.

Because you’re dealing with bigger problems, the
consequences, of course, will be greater. Your responsibilities
heavier. That means your experience must be better—rnore
complete. And so, you‘ll get the kind of opportunities only a
giant can give.

Giants just naturally seem to attract top professionals.
Men that you‘ll be working with and for. And some of that
talent is bound to rub off.

Because there‘s more to do, you‘ll learn more. In
more areas.

Youlll develop a talent for making hardrnosed, imaginar
tive decisions. And you‘ll know how these decisions affect
the guts of the operation. At the grass roots. Because you’ll
have been there.

If you’d like to be a giant yourself, and your better
ideas are in ﬁnance, product engineering, manufacturing,
marketing and sales, personnel administration or systems
research, see the man from Ford when he visits your campus.
Or send your resume to Ford Motor Company, College
Recruiting Department.

You and Ford can grow bigger together.

Solid connection.

It just makes good sense for the
graduate engineer or scientist,
contemplating the direction of his
professional career, to make sure
that he has all the information he
needs about every company he is
considering—that he has total
input information—before he makes
a, connection.

If you're good. If you're really
good. If you have learned to use
the knowledge you have acquired
as a starting point from which to
launch new ideas, you probably
know already that your talents are
in demand. There is always a
seller's market for intellect.

But there can be more to your
future than buy and sell.
Satisfaction is a commodity that
cannot be exchanged.

When you are considering where
you will start in the complex world
of aerospace, while you are
gathering input information, we

54

urge you to investigate the

opportunity for a satisfying career

here at the Pomona division of

General Dynamics.

Here are five reasons why it would
be a wise move for you now:

1. You will work side-by-side with
nationally recognized engineers
and scientists who are
pioneering advanced concepts
in missilry. Your reputation will
be balanced by association.

. Your compensation and fringe
benefits will be on a par with
the top in the industry.

3. You will pursue your profession
in an area where living is
pleasurable year ’round—one
of the top vacation areas in the
nation. Beaches, mountains,
desert, a great city nearby,
universities and colleges for
advanced study, an atmosphere
of growth and achievement.

4. Your ability will be applied to

F0

creating universally important
products of engineering
imagination.

5. Here at the nation’s largest
facility for development and
manufacture of tactical guided
missiles, your talents will be
evaluated, recognized and
rewarded.

This is the image of a

Kodak
mechanical engineer

Correct, literally. But misleading because
Larry Wood’s job is not _typical of Kodak
engineers in general. Most of them get to handle
a camera—assembled or disassembled—only at home or
on vacation. Unless they happen to be personally hipped
on cameras (which Larry once told us he is).

Diversiﬁcation has been going on here for a long, long
time. That’s why we can give an engineer plenty of solid
ground for choice—at the outset and later. If his personal
feelings incline him away from devoting his talents to fun
things like cameras, he gets just as good a chance to
demonstratehis capacity for higher responsibility through
work in the 72% of our business that has nothing to do
with fun cameras. He may be solving problems in the
packaging of bulk vitamins for dairy cattle or designing
spinnerets for polyoleﬁn hay baler twine or making x—ray
processing machines run faster so that society can get
more use out of its short supply of doctors.

Kodak itself really serves as a magniﬁcently effective
machine through which M.E.’s and other engineers can
apply their talents against society’s demands. There can
be no more valid excuse for Kodak’s continued existence.

   
 
   

The engineer’s duty consists of constantly
improving effectiveness. Here are ﬁve ways-
each suiting a different personality makeup—to

ﬁt in:

1. Designing new products and better performance into the
established ones.

2. Figuring out the best possible ways to manufacture the
products.

3. Applying pure reason through mathematical tools to make
the laws of physics serve human needs, not oppose them.

4. Creating the right physical tools, the right plants to house
them, and the right services to keep them functioning.

5. Getting out to where the products are being used, showing
the users how to get their money’s worth, and bringing back word
on how to do even better in the future.

If you want more speciﬁc details than that, we are very
glad. Just communicate with
