What did I see?
What were my thoughts?

BY DONALD B. HOOVER, MetE ’58

’ -When my train pulled into Milan, ‘most of the

passengers left. A Tsliort Italian and myself were the
 remaining in the coach. I tried to tell him

 yvas goipngy to Geynoa.  ﬁrst he did not understand

I ,rne,i but then abroad smile appeared across his face.
-I «He indicated that he too was going to Genoa and that
  would "care for me yduri/ngi the ‘remainder of the trip.

   returniedii cparrfyingyyytwo bottles of ‘ﬁﬁirra
 Peroni?’ and some ,_sandwiches. ‘After giving them to
4 /‘me, heyrefused» to take the coins I offered him.

When I learned he was: coming from Paris, I
asked him what‘ he"had’”d6ne there. Producing pic.
tures of several women, he pointed to one, blew a kiss
fromhis lips, and said, “1000 Lire.” I got theidea.

A new world was opening before me as I boarded
a Vickers Viscount at Pittsburgh for the ﬂight to New
York. There was the thrill of adventure as the Viscount
lifted into the air; I was severing ties with my family
and being put on my own. As the airplane headed for
New York, I asked myself, “How would I react to
the new-found freedom? Would I justify the trust
everyone had in me ?” As I travelled from New York
to England, these same thoughts again passed ‘through
my mind.

They vanished completely, however, when I ar-
rived in Sheffield, England. At 9:00 a.m. I met Mr.
C. C. Linstead in his office at the Edgar Allen & Co.,
Ltd., Research & Development Laboratories. By the
end of the day we had mapped a plan whereby I
would spend a week in each of several departments in
the laboratory. The first week I worked in the Radio-
graphy section. At ﬁrst I imagined that he was not do-

ing his work; he seemed to be devoting all his time to
showing me around, As the week came to a close, I
realized that a large amount of work had been done
without any pretentious hustling or shouting.

My next week was spent in the toolmaking and
trackwork sections; again, things were done very de-
li‘-berately. And the workers always had time for a
cup of tea. The next stop was the induction melting
center where special alloys were produced. Everyone
asked me, “How do the Americans prevent segregation
of carbide in high-speed steels?” I had a vague notion
of the problem, but couldn’t answer the question. To
this day the thought still persists in my mind, “Should
I know?”

During my days in Sheffield, I visited the British
Iron & Steel Research Association where I was shown
several projects of metallurgical interest. A day at

wave transmission through superconductors. This experiment is a ioint effort of a group of
Westinghouse scientists aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the nature ofsuperconductivity.

Westinghouse Scientists Probe Secrets of Superconductivity, using...

The Coldest Cold

Temperatures within a fraction of a
degree of absolute zero are produced
routinely by Westinghouse scien-
tists in their search for more knowl-
edge of the important phenomena
of superconductivity. These phenom-
ena rank with the nature of nuclear
forces as one of the most funda-
mental problems facing the theo-
retical physicist. When supercon-
ductivity is completely understood,
its principles could well revolu-
tionize the electrical and electronic
industries.

The basic principles of supercon-
ductivity have eluded an explana-
tion since 1911 when the ﬁrst ex-
ample of the complete disappear-
ance of electrical resistance in metal
was discovered. Today scientists at
the Westinghouse Research Labo-
ratories in Pittsburgh, are making
signiﬁcant contributions to the ﬁeld
by their low-temperature research.

Superconductivity occurs in cer-
tain metals, alloys and compounds
which, below characteristic transi-
tion temperatures, completely lose
their electrical resistance. While in

DECEMBER 1957

this superconducting state, they are
perfectly diamagnetic, i.e. will com-
pletely exclude magnetic ﬂux when
placed in a magnetic ﬁeld.

While this fundamental research
is being conducted by theoretical
physicists in search of knowledge
and understanding of ﬁrst principles,
from even the terse description above
of superconductivity, the imagina-
tion begins to run Wild with engi-
neering applications. An electronic
computer using superconductivity
memory elements will switch 10,000
times faster than conventional com-
puter elements, will store 10 times
as much information per unit space
as ordinary computers. If the con-
ditions can be fulﬁlled to make a
substance superconductive in tem-
perature regions other than that

around absolute zero, design of every
electrical or electronic product will
be radically changed. Imagine con-
sidering the commonest electrical de-
sign problem without having to take
into account electrical resistance!
While these exciting considera-
tions whet the imagination, they are
not the primary object of the low-
temperature research going on at

,Westinghouse. This and many other

research projects are being conducted
to discover new phenomena and new
knowledge of the universe. It is done
on the belief that all research is an
investment in tomorrow.

this means exciting opportunities for

AUTOMATED PRODUCTION IN A SMALL‘

BY DONALD L. METZGER, EE ’58

In Upper Sandusky, Ohio the most automated
small motor plant in the country was recently p-ut into
production by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Al-
though highly conveyorized and_ mechanized, this plant
is ﬂexible enough to permit additional major increases
in productive capacity with only moderate expendi-
tures for tooling, equipment, and rearrangement. Also,
two basically different fractional horsepower motors,
shaded-pole and permanent-split capacitor types, can
be manufactured. Both are used -for direct-connec-ted
fan applications, such as room air conditioners, unit
heaters and coolers, furnace blowers, and window fans.

The shaded pole motor is a single- or multi-speed,
switchless motor for low-power applications. The per-
manent-split capacitor motor is also a single- or multi-
speed, -switchless motor; its higher efficiency and power
factor make it ideal as a fan drive in room air-
conditioners.

In planning this small motor pl-ant, design engin-
eers had to develop a complete line of motors to serve
the air-conditioning industry as well as to design, lay-—
out, and build a plant to produce high quality motors
efficiently. Starting from scratch enabled them to
closely coordinate motor and plant design to full ad-
vantage. The basic requirement was to develop a
motor which would have a new bearing an-d lubrica-
tion system guaranteed for ﬁve years. -

Motors in the new plant are manufactured in
ﬁve basic component production lines: end bells, lamin-
ations, shafts, stators, and rotors. The major lamina-
tion and shaft lines are completely automatic from
-start to ﬁnish; the other lines are highly conveyorized
and mechanized. An "assembly conveyor passes the end
of each component line and picks up completed parts.
-By the time the conveyor p-asses over ﬁnal assembly
work tables, two complete sets of motor parts are on
each rack of the conveyor.

An end-bell de-reeler passes 7% or 7% inch coil
through a straightener and roll feeder to a 600-ton

From the baking oven the stator cores are con-
veyed automatically to two lathes that tur-n en-dabell
ﬁts on stator ends. The stators are removed manually
from an overhead conveyor at the lathe site. The core
is s.upported ‘by an expanding arbor, the machine tail-
stock supports the. arbor and shield-s the winding, and
the cutting cycle is automatic. Th-e ﬁnished stator is
placed on the ﬁnal assembly co-nveyor.

The ﬁnish ground shaft is chain driven to a

are stored until ready for shrink assembly to the
rotor core.

All components of the motor are received at the
general assembly area on a single conveyor. Each
hanger rack on the conveyor contains components for
two complete motors.

There are two assembly lines, each three station
progressive. The conveyor moves between the two lines
directly ove-r work stations.

rotor, and the s-tator on a belt driven ﬁxture. The

the lea-ds through the lead hole, and inserts the through
‘bolts. The third operator uses a three-headed pneuma-
tic drill for inserting screws, checks end play, and
connects the assembled motor to the test conveyor.
This test conveyor carries the assembled motor -into the
soundproof test ‘booth. Enroute, the motor reaches nor-
mal operating temperature for subsequent tests and is
automatically checked for grounds.

At the ﬁnish paint area dust caps are assembled.
The motor is placed on conveyor-driven rotating ped-
estals, automatically sprayed with enamel, and cycled
through the paint baking oven.

At the end of the baking cycle, the motors are
cooled, identifying decals are added, and the motor
is packed for shipment.

HALF WAY UP THE HILL

A REVISED SEMINAR PROGRAM

The concept of student participation in the Thurs-
day seminars is not new. Few seminars, however, have
as much student activity as the American Institute of
Industrial Engineers.

Reorganized this year, the AIIE seminar is en-
couraging all of its 110 members to take- an active in-
terest in the programs and activities of the group.
These members are manning ﬁve standing committees:
social, program, athletic, directory, and newspaper,
Each student is required to participate in the activities
of at least one of these committees.

The largest, the program committee, is responsi-
ble for plannin-g and presenting the weekly meetings.
The committee is divided into small groups; each is re-

    

Officers of the AIIE are, left to right, Ron Neumar,»Dave
Gr-otjohan, Dick Ney, and Curt Anclreen.

sponsible for the seminar program of a particular week.
Each group decides whether they w-ant a speaker, a
movie, or some other type of program. Once the type

of program is selected, the group makes all necessary

arrangements for the meeting.

The newspaper committee is responsible for the
production of the weekly seminar bulletin, TH-E PITT
THE-R'B~LIG. Publishing information about the seminar
programs, announcements from .the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet, news of the IE faculty, and informa-
tion about the IE student activities, the THERBLIG
is an extension of the bulletin board.

Publishing a booklet oontaining the names, ad-
dresses, and phone numbers of all AIIE members is
the job of the directory committee. This is the ﬁrst
time a seminar group at Pitt has started such a pro-

40

ject. It is designed to promote closer associations be-
tween members of the group.

The athletic committee is responsible for organiz-
ing the IE departmental intramural teams. Playing in
the Engineering and Mines Cabinet Intramural Lea-
gue, the group had a team in the touch football com-
petition. Plans are also being made to ﬁeld an IE team
in softball, basketball, and volleyball.

SCHOLARS ARE INITIATED

During t-he past two weeks, engineers who have
excelled scholastically were initiated to both Sigma
Tau and Eta Kappa Nu in formal ceremonies at the
Student Union. .

Psi Chapter of Sigma Tau, natio-nal honorary en-
gineering society, held their initiation on December 5
in the Supper Room. Dave Gish, ME ’58, was the
banquet chairman. President Jim Gatto, EE ’58, re-
ported that many of the active and faculty members
were present to honor the initiates.

On December 10, Beta Delta Chapter of the Eta
Kappa Nu held their initiation -banquet in Dining
Room A. Dr. Donald E. Swarts, Director of Student
Pu-blic-ations and Associate Dean of Men, was the main
speaker at the affair. He discussed the need for effec-
tive communication between technically train-ed per-
sonnel. Don Metzger, EE ’5‘8 and President of the
chapter, urged the group of initiates to ta-ke an active
interest in the or-ganization.

A LOOK AT THE YEARBOOK

Keeping in step with the many changes being
made at Pitt, the concepts guiding the production of
the 1958 ‘OWL are radically different from those of
previous years. OWL Editor Bob H-awxhurst recently
announced, “The format of the ’58 OWL is pointed
toward the student——his college life, activities, and
organizations. New techniques in layout are being us-
ed to give this year’s ‘book a -fresh appearance.”

After December 20, the price of the ’58 OWL in-
creases. Until that deadline a $2.00 down payment will
reserve a copy of the OWL for any student. Prices for
the yearbook are: regular edition, $6.00; deluxe edi-
tion; $7.50. After December 20, the price of the regu-
lar edition will be $8.00. No deluxe editions will be
sold.

Copies of the OWL can be ordered at the Student
Desk in the Cathedral of Learning or in the OWL
-office, 805 Cathedral.

ABOUT OUR AUTHORS

Few students at Pitt can boast of
more experience in the oil ﬁelds
than Michael P. Companion. This
experience is plainly evident in the
authoritative manner in which he
handles “Putting Isotopes To
Wor .”

Mike worked as a rousta-bout for
the past two summers, one with
Continental Oil in Kansas and the
other with Carter Oil in Illinois. It
was at these places that he became
acquainted with the uses of radio-
activity in the petroleum industry.

To tell about our other authors
is to tell about the pictures which
appear in the articles. There is an
interesting story of how the pictures
were obtained for each article.

When Copy Editor Ken Rothert
chose the Fort Pitt Tunnel story
as the second feature in the Pitts-
burgh’s Progress series, he was
aware of the abundance of informa-
tion available. His problem began,
however, when he tried to obtain
pictures of the tunnel as it will ap-
pear when completed and of the
boring rig used in its construction.

Nowhere, it seemed, were these

DECEMBER 1957.

pictures available. After a week of
interviews and letters, a phone call
to Michael Baker Architects in
Rochester, Penn-sylva-nia, resulted
in the artist’s drawing which ap-

’ pears in “A Tunnel Solves A Prob-

lem.”

Dick DeNezza states in his arti-
cle, “A Poisoned Atmosphere,” that
the effects of radiation are felt
everywhere. He found, however,
that photographs concerning radia-
tion can be quite scarce. To get
pictures for his article, Dick visi-ted
Pitt’s Radiation Laboratory and the
radiation department of the School
of Public Health. Result: no pic-
tures.

When he searched through the
library of THE PITTSBURGH
PRESS, he found a photograph
that was appropriate for -his story.
After asking if he could borrow it,
Dick was told that the picture was
not available for distribution.

Finally, after talking with the
P-RE-SS Managing .Editor Victor
Free, Dick received permission
to borrow the picture for this issue.

How would you describe a pro-

     

Mike Companion

duction process without pictures?
Don Metzgcr, Features Editor, con-
sidered this when he wrote “Auto-
mated Production In A Small Mo-
tor Plant.” The article is based on
a technical paper by H. V. Mc-
Gahey of Westinghouse.

When Don thought of whom to
contact for pictures, he remember-
ed that a SKYSCRAPER alumnus
works i-n the Westinghouse Public-
ity Department. Mitch Kozikowski,
editor of the 1956-57 SKYSCRAP-
ER, was the man who obtained the
pictures for Don’s article.

“They all agree. . .”

"Since the day we decided to get married, I’ve been
doing a lot of thinking about our future. It’s time I
made a choice on a career. I've talked to the Dean of
Engineering, most of my professors, and to some of the
fellows who have graduated, and you know, they all
said the same thing.

"They all agree that the aircraft and missile industry
holds the best opportunities and the brightest future for
an engineer these days. What they said makes sense,

too, because developments in’ this field today really give ‘ ‘
a fellow an opportunity to make important contribu:, . A

tions on vital projects.
"Not only that, but the aircraft industry is noted for
its good salaries. Generous beneﬁts, too. And advance-

ment in both salary and position is limited only by hogvﬁw‘

far I want to go."
U nlimited opportunities, high salaries, company-paid
beneﬁts unheard of until a few years ago —— these
are only a few of the reasons why so many young engi-
neers with a keen eye to the future are choosing the
aircraft industry.
It is only natural that many engineering graduates
should consider joining Northrop Aircraft, Inc., be-

. , . V5
cause the company shares 1ts many successes with every s—¥’*‘°

member of its engineering and scientific team. Ad-
vanced projects at Northrop are now in production, and
active top-priority projects mean rapid advancement
and success for the individual engineer.

Such projects include the famous Snark SM—62,
world's first intercontinental guided missile, now being‘
activated in the first United States Air Force missile
squadron; the USAF T-38 supersonic twin-jet ad-
vanced trainer; and other important missile and
manned aircraft weapon systems and components.

Engineers in more than thirty categories contribute
to Northrop’s success in an ideal environment with the
latest tools of science, in its new Engineering Science
Center. Here you will work with leading scientists and
engineers who respect, acknowledge, and reward your
individual ideas and abilities. ‘

Why not write us now . . , regardless of your class at
college. Ask us how you might best gain a career with
Northrop. Write to Manager of Engineering Industrial
Relations, Northrop Division, Northrop Aircraft, Inc.,

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Q. Mr. Hill, what can I do to get the
most out of my job interviews?

A. You know, we have the same
question. I would recommend that
you have some information on what
the company does and why you be-
lieve you have a contribution to
make. Looking over company in-
formation in your placement office
is helpful. Have in mind some of the
things you would like to ask and try
to anticipate questions that may
refer to your speciﬁc interests.

Q. What information do you try to get
during your interviews?

A.- This is where we must ﬁll in be-
tween the lines of the personnel
forms. I try to ﬁnd out why partic-
ular study programs have been fol-
lowed, in order to learn basic motiva-
tions. I also try to ﬁnd particular
abilities in ﬁelds of science, or math-
ematics, or alternatively in the more
practical courses, since these might
not be apparent from personnel rec-
ords. Throughout the interview we
try to judge clarity of thinking since
this also gives us some indication of
ability and ultimate progress. One
good way to judge a person, I ﬁnd,
is to ask myself: Would he be easy
to work with and would I like to
have him as my close associate?

Q. What part do first impressions play
in your evaluation of people?

A. I think we all form a ﬁrst im-
pression when we meet anyone.
Therefore, if a generally neat ap-
pearance is presented, I think it
helps. It would indicate that you
considered this important to your-
self and had some pride in the way
the interviewer might size you up.

Q. With only academic training as a
background, how long will it be before
l’|l be handling responsible work?

Interview with General Electric’s

W. Scott Hill

Manager — Engineering Recruiting

Qualities I Look For

When Recruiting Engineers

A. Not long at all. If a man joins a
training program, or is placed direct-
ly on an operating job, he gets
assignments which let him work up
to more responsible jobs. We are
hiring people with deﬁnite consider-
ation for their potential in either
technical work or the management
ﬁeld, but their initial jobs will be
important and responsible.

Q. How will the fact that I've had to
work hard in my engineering studies,
with no time for a lot of outside activi-
ties, affect my employment possibilities?

A. You’re concerned, I’d guess, with
all the talk of the quest for “well-
rounded men.” We do look for this
characteristic, but being president
of the student council isn’t the only
indication of this trait. Through
talking with your professors, for
example, we can determine who
takes the active role in group proj-
ects and gets along well with other
students in the class. This can be
equally important in our judgment.

Q. How important are high scholastic
grades in your decision to hire a man?

A. At G.E. we must have men who
are technically competent. Your
grades give us a pretty good indica-
tion of this and are also a measure
of the way you have applied your-
self. When we ﬁnd someone whose
grades are lower than might be ex-
pected from his other characteristics,
we look into it to ﬁnd out if there
are circumstances which may have
contributed.

Q. What consideration do you give work
experience gained prior to graduation?

A. Often a man with summer work
experience in his chosen academic

ﬁeld has a much better idea of what
he wants to do. This helps us decide
where he would be most likely to
succeed or where he should start his
career. Many students have had to
work hard during college or sum-
mers, to support _themselves. These
men obviously have a motivating
desire to become engineers that we
ﬁnd highly desirable.

Q. Do you feel that a man must know
exactly what he wants to do when he is
being interviewed?

A. No, I don’t. It is helpful if he
has thought enough about his in-
terests to be able to discuss some
general directions he is considering.
For example, he might know whether
he wants product engineering work,
or the marketing of technical prod-
ucts, or the engineering associated
with manufacturing. On G-E train-
ing programs, rotating assignments
are designed to help men ﬁnd out
more about their true interests be-
fore they make their ﬁnal choice.

Q. How do military commitments affect
your recruiting?

A. Many young men today have
military commitments when they
graduate. We feel it is to their ad-
vantage and ours to accept employ-
ment after graduation and then ful-
ﬁll their obligations. We have a
limited number of copies of a De-
partment of Defense booklet de-
scribing, in detail, the many ways in
which the latter can be done. Just
write to Engineering Personnel,
Bldg. 36, 5th Floor, General Electric
Company, Schenectady 5, N. Y. 959-s

...on science and impossibility

"Scientific imiowiedge is derived from observations of
the world. Our imaginations. however, are not hounded
by this constraint:-—vwe can easily imagine physicai non—
sense. Not everything is possible. We sometimes get the
opposite impression because new scientific discoveries
force us to modify an old theory, and give rise to new
and unexpected possibilities. But the point is that the
old theory was verified for some class of physical phe-
nomena, and a domain of validity was established. The
new theory. however radically it may differ from the oid

one in its conceptual basis, must aiways agree with the
oid theory in the predictions it makes for that class of
phenomena. Despite the greater generality of quantum
mechanics, Newton's laws still apply to macroscopic
objects. Parity is still conserved for the strong inter-
actions. The oid impossihiiities still remain. Within the
limits defined by the impossihiiities, there is plenty of
room for man's inventiveness to operate. In fact, the game
is even more challenging that way."
