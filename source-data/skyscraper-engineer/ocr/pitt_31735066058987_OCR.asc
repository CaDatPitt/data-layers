Sophisticated, work-saving aids
help Bell System engineers
provide important communications services

As an engineer your future could be important to us.
You might be able to contribute to our continuing
leadership in the communications ﬁeld. Therefore, you
should know something about us and how we operate.

Bell System engineers deal with modern problems
in modern ways. They have at their command the
latest in technology and equipment.

An example is how computer programs aid in
providing telephone service for new communities.

Engineers at Bell Telephone Laboratories have
devised computer programs broad enough in scope
so that Bell System operating telephone companies
can use them to engineer the required wide variety
of telephone plant networks.

As part of a continuing effort, programs have been
designed to analyze communications needs of an
area for determining the best plant network layout
and switching ofﬁce location.

In general, the necessary data are collected and the

 

 

engineer selects a number of alternative plans to be
analyzed in detail by a computer. His ﬁnal decision is
based primarily on an analysis of the computer output.

The computer supplies more signiﬁcant data, and
supplies it much faster, than laborious, manual cal-
culation methods. The engineer is thus relieved of
dull, time-consuming computation, and he plans facili-
ties with increased conﬁdence—knowing that he is
providing efficient and economical communications,
tailored for a given area.

You may well Find a rewarding career in the Bell
System, where people find solutions to exciting
problems. The Bell System companies are equal
opportunity employers. Arrange for an on-campus
interview through your Placement Office, or talk to
a local Bell System company.

 ‘I’ in this hypothetical geographical area, communications could be supplied with one large tele-   ?

phone switching ofﬁce and a network of cables (left), or with three smaller ofﬁces and a diﬁerent
network (right). Many other combinations of ofﬁces and cable networks might be possible.
This situation, although hypothetical, is typical of the complex telephone engineering prob-
lems that are being solved with the aid of computer programs designed at Bell Laboratories.

What’s

New

in Engineering

Let there be light. Engineers de-
scribe the Sodium-Lucalox lamp,
which uses a pencil thin arc tube of a
translucent synthetic ceramic called
Lucalox, as the light of the future.
They predict that it will revolutionize
the lighting industry similar to the
ﬂuorescent lamp of 1938.

The high heat resistance of Lucalox,
combined with its chemical stability
and ability to transmit light, permits
the use of sodium vapors at higher
temperatures and pressures than pre-
viously possible. Efficiencies in excess
of 145 lumens per watt have been
achieved.

The ﬁrst major outdoor test was
conducted at General Electric’s Rich-
mond Heights plant. Q5 Sodium-
Lucalox lamps adequately replaced

5% present day mercury lamps in their
parking lot.

Laser computer. A two-mile long
laser beam has been folded into a
small space by reflecting it over 1000
times between two mirrors. Conducted
by Bell Telephone, this experiment
opens the way for optical delay lines
used as high-speed, sequential, com-
puter memories.

To get the maximum number of
reflections without interference be-
tween light beams, two spherical mir-
rors were bent into slightly cylindrical
shapes. As a result, the light spot—
the point where a beam hits the mir-
ror—moves with each reflection to
form a Lissajous pattern. By con-
trolling the angle of the entering light
beam, a region free of spots can be
left in the mirror’s center for the
output beam.

l\Iany beams can be reflected back
and forth at the same time if they
enter at different angles or frequen-
cies. Thus, one mirror system can
store several sets of information. The
maximum number of beam relays is

limited by the area of the mirrors and
by its scattering loss.

Field ion microscope. The world’s
most powerful commercial research
microscope — the first that enables
scientists to see atoms —- was
introduced by l\’Iaterials Research
Corporation.

For many years microscopes used
reflected light as the basic principle
of operation. Then electron micro-
scopes replaced these as the tool
researchers used for increased magni-
fication. The newest microscopes em-
ploy the ﬁeld ion principle.

The field ion concept was first in-
troduced in 1955. It has increased
resolution from 8 angstroms down to
2. The microscope operates like a
conventional television picture tube.
A picture representing the edge of a
needle-point specimen is formed on a
fluorescent screen. This picture can
then be photographed.

A specimen is ﬁrst reduced to
——258°F. to inhibit atomic motion.
Next it is subjected to an electric
field so that charged particles will be
reﬂeeted by the sample. And ﬁnally

the specimen is placed in a Vacuum
to prvent interference by extraneous
atoms in the actual photograph.

Space furnace. At a cost of ony $25
per “flight”, aerospace scientists sub-
ject exotic metals, such as columbium
and tantalum alloys, to simulated
escape and reentry conditions of space
flight. Tests previously performed
with actual rockets were very time
consuming and expensive. The basis
for the new low operational expense
is a quartz lamp radiation furnace
developed by General Dynamics.

The preprogramed furnace dupli-
cates the actual space mission by
varying the temperature, pressure,
and load. The furnace subjects metal
specimens to temperatures ranging up
to 3,000°F.; to pressures varying from
atmospheric to the virtual vacuum of
space; and to stresses up to 100,000
pounds per square inch.

Research entailing such environ-
mental conditions is aimed at develop-
ing the ideal material for manned
space vehicles of the future at a great
saving to the tax payer.

College graduates do key work right away on the Aerospace Team.

Lt. Gregory Risch, aeronautical engineer from Notre Dame, varsity swimmer, missile test expert,

tells how you can be part of it.

(Lt. Risch, BS. ’62, did extensive un-
dergraduate work in aerodynamics,
helping to construct one of the coun-
try’s largest and most successful smoke
tunnels. He has played an important
part in the operations of the test range
at Cape Kennedy.)

What’s the
best way to become an
Air Force officer?

I wouldn’t -want to call any one way
the “best” way. VVe count on getting
top—quality oflicers from all our sources.
First, there’s the Air Force Academy.
I received my commission through Air
Force ROTC. Many colleges and uni-
versities will soon be providing two-
year AFROTC programs that you can
apply for during your sophomore year.
Then, for the college graduate, there’s
Air Force Officer Training School—OTS.

Who’s eligible
for Air Force OTS?

Any college graduate, male or female,
or a college student within 210 days
of graduation, is eligible to apply. VVho

the Air Force will take depends on what
the particular needs are at the time.
Those with scientific or engineering de-
grees can usually count on receiving the
first openings.

Does the Air Force have
jobs for nonscience majors?

There are quite a few jobs in non-
technical fields such as administration
and personnel. And it is not essential
that prospective pilots or navigators
have backgrounds in the sciences. How-
ever, since the Air Force is one of the
world’s leading technological organiza-
tions, a keen regard for science is im-
portant.

What sort of work
do young Air Force officers do?

Important work. An Air Force career
gives young people the opportunity to
do meaningful work right from the start.
That’s the thing I like best about it.
I’m only a couple of years out of col-
lege, but already I’m working on a vital
project in an area that really interests.
me. In other words, I’m getting to use

the things I studied in college. My edu-
cation is paying off, both for me and
for the United States.

What are the
possibilities for advancement?

They’re plenty good. The Air Force be-
lieves in giving its young officers all the
responsibility they can handle. That’s
not only good for you., it’s good for the
Air Force. It gets the best-qualiﬁed
people into the top jobs where they can
contribute most to our defense effort.

How long am I committed to serve?

Four years from the time you receive
your commission. If you go on to ﬂight
school, four years from the time you’re
awarded your pilot or navigator wings.

Where can I ﬁnd out more?

If there’s an Air Force ROTC unit on
your campus, see the Professor of Aero-
space Studies. If not, contact the near-
est Air Force recruiting oﬂice. It’s listed

STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING IN

Masonry bearing walls, common in Skopje, Yugoslaviak, couldn't hold up under the
high lateral loads imposed by the earthquake. Reinforced concrete ﬂoor slabs and
stair treads hang from the remaining walls of this structure located in Skopeje’s
New City section.

Geological knowledge of the earth
gives one the impression of living on
a huge egg shell. When the cgg’s thin
shell cracks, one of nature’s most dev-
asting and mysterious
occurs: an earthquake.

ph en om e n a

Our planet has a solid, brittle shell
var_ving from 3 to 30 miles in depth.
Below that, like the white of an egg.
is a mantle of rock about 1.800 miles
deep that is plastic and flows under
pressure. Inside, the yolk consists of
an inner and an outter core some
4,300 miles in diameter. Scientists
postulate these cores to be mostly
molten iron and nickel.

Quaker puffed earth. Just exactly
what causes quakes is something seis-
mologists are still studying and de-
bating. The most widely accepted
idea, called the elastic rebound theor_v,
holds that the earth’s crust is con-
tinually subjected to distortions
whose source has not yet been de-
fined. An accumulation of stress
builds up, and when the magnitude
of the stress exceeds the strength of a
section of crust rock, a fracture
occurs.

Then the rock adjacent to the frac-
ture snaps back to an unrestrained
position, releasing pent-up energy
that runs through the earth’s struc-
ture. Some of these shock waves
travel at speeds greater than 8 miles
per second.

Another accepted theory to explain
earthquakes states that the earth‘s
interior is as hot as a furnace. This
heat causes expansion of the earth,
stretching the crust and forcing it to
crack as would the shell of a quickly
boiled egg.

Whatever the causes. earthquakes
are a very common occurence. The
1,900 seismograph stations around the
world detect as many as 500,000 trem-
ors in a year. Magnitude is indicated
by the Richter scale, with the severest
quake ever recorded having an 8.0
reading. There is no upper limit.

EARTHQUAKE ZONE

by Walter R. Arn/zeim

have been few notable efforts to docu-
ment earthquake damage from tech-
nical and engineering viewpoints. The
investigation must reproduce a build-
ing as a small scale prototype so it
will be physically manageable, or he
must build a full size structure and
face problems of simulating the gigan-
tic forces of an earthquake.

When a real earthquake hits a city.
nature carries out the experiment for
the researcher. It may be a horrible
form of experiment b11t it gives the
engineer a true story from which to
check his theories and gather new
information.

Preventive Medicine. Cities can pre-
vent massive destruction by earth-
quakes, providing they take advan-
tage of today’s construction materials,
toda_v’s building methods, and today’s
engineering knowledge. This is the
main conclusion drawn by two engi-

neering inspection teams who con-
ducted ﬁeld investigations of the
Skopje, Yugoslavia and the Anchor-
age, Alaska earthquakes.

These teams. sponsored by the
American Iron and Steel Institute,
s_vstematicall_v combed both cities.
took numerous pictures, talked with
local building experts, and studied
hundreds of maps and construction
drawings. Their first published report
dealt with the Skopje earthquake.
Skopje is the capital cit_v of l\Tacedo-
nia, one of the six socialist republics
comprising Yugoslavia. The Vardar
River divides Skopje into the Old
City and the New City. At the time
of the quake the city’s population was
about 180,000.

Noisy alarm clock. On July 26, 1963
an earthquake jolted Skopje awake
at 5:17 a.m. The epicenter (surface
point where movement starts) of the

earthquake.

quake was located onl_v a few miles
from the center of town.

The earthquake’s magnitude regis-
tered about 6 on the Richter scale.
This was not a major seismic event
considering 198 quakes of magnitude
(5 or more were recorded during the
past two years. The region of severe
damage was entirely within Skopje’s
city limits. Fatalities numbered over

1.2()(). 10'/r of all buildings collapsed
with an additional 65% damaged
l)eyond economical repair.

Factors. Several factors combined to
bring about the great destruction.
The small area of severe damage. the
small magnitude. and the close epi-
center indicated that the major zone
of damage was influenced by sul)grade
conditions. Thus, the alluvial soil
unde Skopje was pro-bably a primary
contributor to the damage.

Another factor is that much of
Skopje is an ancient city with few
modern structures designed to resist
earthquake forces. Yugoslavia has
had a seismic code since 1948 but few
buildings, old or new, had adequate
provisions for the lateral forces im-
pose d by quakes.

The Old City section received espe-
cially severe damage. Masonary walls,
common in Skopje, collapsed under
the high lateral loads. Heavy tile
roofs on adobe buildings pulled in the
walls which did not have the strength
or resilience to ‘withstand these huge
lateral forces.

Reports show that the Skopje and
Anchorage earthquakes were sharpl_v
different catastrophes. The Alaskan
quake, one of the strongest ever to
rock North America, occurred on
.\/larch Q7. 1964. The main shock had
a Richter magnitude of 8.4- and hit
80 miles east of Anchorage. Scores of
aftershocks followed, with many of
magnitude 6 or greater.

Unstable clay. The major cause of

property damage in Anchorage came
not from shock or vibration but from
earth slides. The unstabe clay under-
lying the cit_v is blamed for four major
slides. Such foundation failures can
not be controlled by design.

Unlike the Skopje catastrophe,
effects of the quake in Anchorage ap-
peared in general to be most harmful
to high structures. It left most low
structures practically unaffected. But
because Anchorage is a modern city
where most structures are built to a
rigid seismic code, few high buildings
collapsed although many received
moderate to heavy damage. Hence,
the Anchorage structures A protected
life reasonably well with less than Qt)
lives lost.

The quake was remarkably effec-
tive in ferreting out structural weak-
nesses. lnvestigators quickly discov-
ered those buildings designed without
attention to seismic forces. Glaring
failures resulted from inadequate con-
nections of structural elements. poor
construction of joints, and a lack of
ties in reinforced concrete.
Concrete facts. Structures with steel
frames generally withstood the earth-
quake quite well. l\'Ioderate height
poured-in-place concrete structures
showed fairly good performance. But
the performance of precast concrete
structures was relatively poor.

In stating lessons learned from the
two earthquakes. the inspection teams
stress that certain fundamental prin-
ciples must be followed in seismic de-

In Boston there were two brothers, one a bachelor and
the other married, who looked so much alike you could
hardly tell them apart. One lost his wife, and shortly
afterwards the other lost his ﬁshing rowboat, a quite
dilapidated craft which fell apart and sank suddenly.

A few days later, a kindly old lady met the boat owner
and mistook him for the brother whose wife had died;
“Oh, l\'Ir. Jones,” said she, “I’m sorry to hear of your
loss.”

He, thinking she meant the boat of course, said: “Loss?
Forget it. I should have put the axe to that old tub long
ago; she belonged in the bottom of the ocean. Smelly
thing, full of ﬁsh odors, I could hardly stand it lately.
Tried to sell her but who would -have her.

Even that thick paint job couldn’t hide the fact that she
was all chewed up. Finally I couldn’t handle her;eI rented
her to some guys looking for a good time; but there were
too many of them, and suddenly she just cracked up and
fell apart — — — Hey, somebody, quick! This old lady’s

“If angular momentum can’t be created, where did it

BRIEF

 

The problem: Measurement of the
characteristics of a very hot gas
stream of unknown composition. An
instrument is needed that will mea-
sure mass flow density and total heat
content per unit mass only, and pitot
pressure.

The solution: A shielded, tubular
flow calorimeter that is simply oper-
ated by valve positions to selectively
measure the desired gas stream pro-
perties.

How it's done: The probe consists
of a calorimeter tube encased in a
water-cooled shield. Flow of water
through the device is controlled to
minimize effects of external, heat
transfer. Water in the calorimeter
tube passes along the inner face of the
Slll€l(l, thus reducing the temperature
differential and resultant heat trans-
fer between tube and shield. It then
passes along the outer wall of the
shield, cooling’ the surface in contact
with the hot stream. Accurate mda-
siirement of the gas temperature ‘at
the probe outlet is not required ‘as
long as it is close to the water tem-
perature because residual heat con-
tent per unit mass is usually negligi-
hk“ HOWGVCI‘, gas temperature must
be known accurately at the gas flow-
meter, therefore the gas is passed
thl'“Ui‘Ih a coil in a water bath to
bring it to a constant temperature.
Pressure is measured at the flowmeter
“"t"a"?9 by a dial manometer. A
throttling valve is placed in the line
following the flowmeter.

To measure total heat content per
"W? "1355, the probe is inserted at the
desired point in the stream and the
throttle valve adjusted until a suit-
able gas outlet temperature is reached.
To measure total heat content per
unit mass and local mass flow density,
the probe ‘inlet faces the stream di-
"“(’tl.\' and the throttle is adjusted to
capture the entire mass ﬂow ahcad of
the Inlet. For.this measurement, pres-
sllI'(‘ at the inlet lip must be held
equal to the free-stream. To mea-
-“‘”"‘ Plmt l”'C3Sl11‘€‘. the probe faces

the stream directly and the throttling
valve is fully closed_

The problem: Analog cardiotacho-
meters are inherently nonlinear and
do not respond with sufficient speed
to indicate rapid changes in heartbeat
rate. Those digital cardiotachometers
that are capable of measuring heart-
beat rate on a beat—by—beat basis are
generally complex and costly.

The solution: A cardiotachometer
circuit that produces an output volt-
age proportional to the heartbeat rate
on a beat—by—beat basis. Direct read-
ings in beats per minute are obtained
on a linear scale of a digital voltmeter.
This circuit is designed to be used
with an auxiliary circuit that converts
a subject’s electrocardiogram into
square-wave pulses at a frequency
proportional to the heartbeat rate.
How i'l"s done: The sqiiare—wave
pulses from the auxiliary circuit are
applied as the input to the cardio-
tachometer. These pulses trigger the
moiiostable multivibrator (Q1—QQ)
which converts them into shortdura-
tion (4—millisecond) square-wave
pulses. The narrow pulses pass
through the driver stage, (Q3), and
are differentiated in the (Q4) emitter
and (T1) transformer circuit. The
positive—going portion of the differen-
tiated square wave appearing on the
secondary of (T1) passes to the base
elements of the normally cut off
switching transistors (Q5) and (Q6).
On receipt of a positive pulse, these
transistors are turned on to transfer
the voltage developed on integrating

capacitor (C5) to the memory capac-
itor (C6). A few milliseconds later,
the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) ,
(CR4), is triggered and shorts out
the charge on (C5). The SCR then
returns to the quiescent state and
(C5) becomes ready to start another
cycle when the next positive pulse
appears.

Capacitor (C5) is sampled and
then shorted out each time a 4-milli-
second pulse is generated. The time
between pulses is relatively long (0.3
to 3 seconds). During this interval,
(C5) will continue to chare at a
linear rate through (Q7) toward
—— 10 volts, until the next heart beat
(4-millisecond pulse) activates the
switching transistors to transfer the
charge from (C5) to (C6). Transis-
tor(Q7) provides the coiistant-cur-
rent source necessary for a linear
charge rate, so that the amplitude of
the ramp voltage on (C5) is a func-
tion of the time between heart beats.

The charge on (C6) biases the ﬁeld
effect transistor, (Q8), to control the
current through (R15). Since a ﬁeld
effect transistor is a high—impedance
device, the charge on (C6) will not
leak off between pulses. The voltage
across (R15) is therefore a function
of this charge. This output voltage is
applied to a commercial digital volt-
meter in a unique manner. Normally
the voltage would be applied to the
voltmeter’s input terminals. Instead,
the output voltage is applied to the
voltagevoltage reference circuit inside
the meter case and a 0.1-volt reference
is applied to the input terminals. The
digital voltmeter is thus connected as
an electronic divider or ratiometer to
provide readings of the heartbeat rate
directly in beats per minute.

The problem: To maintain a con-
stant output torque, free of backlash
components, from a pulsating input
torque.

The solution: Two elastic elements
(springs) connecting a hub and two
spur gears absorb torque differentials
and provide the desired antibacklash
characteristics between input and
output shafts. The system performs
equally well in either direction of
rotation.

How i'l"s done: The hub is securely
attached to the output shaft. and the
two spur gears turn freely on the
shaft. Spring 1 connects gear A to
gear B and spring 2 connects gear B
to the hub. The input shaft pinion
engages both spur gears. Spring 1
forces the engaging tooth of gear A
against the bottom tooth of the pin-
ion and the engaging tooth of gear B
against the top tooth of the pinion.
This arrangement prevents backlash
between the input and output shafts
and spring 1 also serves as a torque
ﬁlter between the two spur gears.
When the input shaft is rotated clock-
wise, its pulsating torque is trans-
ferred directly to gear A, which then
drives gear B through spring 1. The

torque pulsations are ﬁltered by the
spring since the pinion does not
directly drive gear B in this direction
of rotation and gear B is free to rotate
slightly with respect to the pinion.
The hub and output shaft are then
driven counterclockwise with a
smooth, constant torque by a pin in
the hub that engages a slot in gear B.
When the input shaft is rotated
counterclockwise, it drives gear B di-
rectly. In this condition, gear B
drives the hub and output shaft

clockwise through spring 2, which
ﬁlters out the pulsations in the input
torque.

Notes: 1. This system is capable of
ﬁltering small angular displacements
to less than 1 are minute (essentially
zero).

2. This device should be of interest
to manufacturers of precise control
systems.

3. Possible conﬁgurations and ﬁlter
materials are limited only by the
application desired.

THE WAR ON POVERTY:

a message to the Nation’s college students...

Inspiring causes have always fired the
imagination of students.

Today the United States is committed
to the greatest humanitarian cause in its
history—a massive counterattack on the
causes of poverty, which are robbing
35,000,000 Americans of the opportuni-
ties most of us are free to pursue be-
cause we had the advantage of a decent
start in life. That start has been denied
to one-fifth of the nation's people. Thir-
teen million of them are children.

This is a moment in history for the
fortunate to help the least privileged of
their fellow citizens. You can help this
summer, or for a full year if you choose,
as a volunteer in the War on Poverty.

In July and August, 30,000 volunteers
will be needed in their own communities
to assist four- and five-year-old children
of the poor through Project Head Start
Child Development Centers. Thousands
more are needed to live and work among
poor families by enlisting in VISTA, the
domestic Peace Corps.

In Head Start, volunteers work side-
by-side with teachers, social workers,
doctors, and other professionals to give
pre-school children advantages which
can change the patterns of their lives.
Many of these children have never held
a doll, never scribbled with crayons.
Meager environments have blunted their
curiosity. Some are spoken to so rarely
that they are unable to form sentences.

Head Start volunteers will read to chil-
dren, take them on outings to zoos and

parks, organize creative play for them,
and help build the security and self-
confidence they need to succeed in
school. The rewards come when a with-
drawn child begins to ask questions or
responds to the affection for which he
has been starved. Without such help,
many of these children would be headed
for school failure and the poverty cycle
which trapped their parents.

Many young people who are 18 or
older and can serve for a year enroll for
training in V|STA—both to help others
and to enlarge their own capacities for
teaching, social work, or careers in so-
ciology, economics, law, and other fields.

Home base for VlSTAvolunteer groups
can be a city tenement row, a struggling
farm community, an Indian reservation,
a migrant labor camp, or a mental hos-
pital. Volunteers may counsel school
dropouts, ‘organize recreation programs,
tutor children who are behind in school,
explore job opportunities for the poor-
in short, do whatever is needed to help
people find their way up from poverty.
Volunteers become respected members
of the communities where they work.

The pay is nominal—living expenses
plus $50 a month paid at the end of serv-
ice. But the opportunities are great: you
can help pave the way for an America in
which the democratic ideal is big enough
to encompass everyone.

Will you lend your abilities to people
who live in need? Join the War on Poverty
today!

Yes, I want to help the War on Poverty!

(location)

this summer.

H4,

Why become an engineer at

Garrett-AiResearch? You’ll have to

work harder and use more of

your knowledge than engineers

at most other companies.

If you’re our kind of engineer,
you have some very deﬁnite ideas
about your career.

For example:

You’ve worked hard to get a
good education. Now you want to
put it to work in the best way
possible.

You will never be satisﬁed with
run-of-the—mill assignments. You
demand exciting,
challenging projects.

You not only accept
individual responsibil- H
ity — you insist upon it. '

Does thatsound like 
you? Then AiResearch
is your cup of tea.

Our business is
mainly in sophisticated aerospace
systems and subsystems.

Here, research, design, and de-
velopment lead to production of

 
 

actual hardware.
That means you
have the oppor-
tunity to start with
a customer’s problem
and see it through to a
system that will get the job done.
The product lines at AiResearch,
Los Angeles Division, are environ-
mental systems, ﬂight information
and controls sys-
tems, heat transfer
systems, secondary
power generator
systems for missiles
and space, electri-
cal systems, and
specialized indus-
trial systems.
In the Phoenix Division there are
gas turbines for propulsion and
secondary power, valves and con-
trol systems, air turbine starters
and motors, solar and nuclear
power systems.
In each category AiResearch
employs three kinds of engineers.
Preliminary design engineers do
the analytical and theoretical
work, then write proposals.
Design engineers do the lay-
outs; turn an idea into a product.
Developmental engineers are
responsible for making hardware
out of concepts.
Whichever ﬁeld ﬁts you best, we
can guarantee you this: you can
go as far and fast as your talents

  
  

can carry you. You can make as
much money as any engineer in a
comparable spot — anywhere. And
of course, at AiResearch, you’ll
get all the plus beneﬁts a top com-
pany offers.

Our engineering staff is smaller
than comparable companies. This
spells opportunity. It gives a man
who wants to make a mark plenty
of elbow room to expand. And
while he’s doing it he’s working
with, and learning from, some of
the real pros in the ﬁeld.

If the AiResearch story sounds
like opportunity speaking to you-
don’t fail to contact AiResearch,
Los Angeles, or Phoenix, or see our
representative when he comes to
your campus.

The nae to remember for care potential? IORSKY.

It could be the ﬁrst step to a wise career decision.

For never was there a better opportunity for young engineers
like yourself to participate in the growth of a dynamic,
young industry . . . to enter the expanding world of advanced
VTOL systems.

Let’s enlarge on this point. Throughout the history of
engineering, man’s ability to progress has been accomplished
by combining one technology with another. And at Sikorsky
Aircraft we’re doing just that.

The Sikorsky vehicle of today is an advanced VTOL system
. . . blending the technologies of sophisticated electronic
systems and the helicopter airframe to provide a uniquely
new, most versatile means of transportation. Today, our
VTOL systems are working in the broadest areas—ran_ging
from space capsule recovery to commercial and industrial

transport. And we are aiming far into the future with the
further advancement of this new technology.

And what about you? As a Sikorsky engineer, you would be
helping to move “tomorrow” closer by working in small
interdependent groups on demanding problems in such
areas as aerodynamics 0 human factors engineering
0 automatic controls 0 structures engineering 0 weight
prediction 0 systems analysis 0 operations research
0 reliability/maintainability engineering 0 autonaviga-
tion systems 0 computer technology . . . among others.

Opportunities for individual stature and personal progress
are here . . . now.

And professional competence is further advanced by our car-
poration-ﬁnanced Graduate Education Program.

Please consult your College Placement Ofﬁce for campus
