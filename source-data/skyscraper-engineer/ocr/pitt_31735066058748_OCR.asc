THE WORLD'S MOST
POWERFUL ENGINE

The science of rocketry today offers one

of the most challenging fields that can be found by the

young engineer.

Civilization has at its disposal today an en-
gine so powerful that not even its builders can
realize its ultimate limitations. This engine is
capable of attaining goals utterly impossible with
any other known means of locomotion. It has
won battles, even wars; it has hurtled missiles
above the earth at more than 4,000 miles per hour;
it has even carried man himself at a speed of
over 1200 miles per hour. Thousands of horse
power are developed with an engine weight of
only a few hundred pounds.

The engine of which we speak is the rocket;

a device so simple that even a school-boy can be
made to understand the simple principle upon
which it operates. But as in many simple engin-
eering principles the simplicity is often deceptive.
The difficulties encountered in fulfilling the con-
ditions required to make the principle operate be-
come the real problems. These problems set
forth a challenge—a challenge more to the en-
gineering profession than to any other and in
particular to the mechanical engineer, for it is he
that is familiar with the inherent characteristics
and problems of the rocket engine.
_ Let us briefly follow through history the
flights of rockets, then discover what makes the
rocket move together with some of the problems
encountered and lastly we will extrapolate our
rocket progress curve a bit and find what some of
the challenging goals may bein the future; _

Aside from the bow and arrow, the stone
hammer and the human fist, the rocket is perhaps
the oldest weapon known to man. It was first
used in 1232 A.D. by the Chinese in the battle of
Kai Fung Fu, scaring the troops and horses more
than actually inflicting casualties.

The rocket was next used in India. It was
used against the British by the Indians in the
battle of Guntar in 1780. The British adopted
the rocket themselves and employed it against
Napoleon and later against our own country in
the seige of Ft. McHenry in the war of 1812. The
rockets were fired from ships’ boats and were
launched from ladders.

The accuracy of cannons resulting from the
rifling of the barrels caused the decline of the
rocket as a war weapon until the last war.

In 1923 Professor Oberth of Hungary pro-
duced a treatise on the possibility of rocket flight
to the moon. He also developed the first equations
for rockets. The result of this promise of escape
from the earth supporting the mathematical theo-
ry aroused a storm of controversy. As the discus-
sion grew, the subject of rockets became one of
ridicule and amusing speculation about space
ships and five-legged men. As the case has been
with many of our great inventions this ridicule
greatly hindered rocket progress.

Aside from several individuals in the United
States, who worked in secret, the only scientific
rocket development was being done in Germany.
Here the Society For Space Travel was formed
and experiments with liquid fuel rockets were
begun. When Mein Kampf became prescribed
reading for the Germans the society was taken
over by the Nazis and for-med into a military re-
search program at Peenemunde in the Baltic Sea.

The aim of the program was to produce a
rocket capable of bombarding the British Isles
and later the United States. To do this and carry
a given amount of explosive payload meant the
rocket had to have certain push or thrust, namely
56,000 pounds at sea level. The basic profile of
the engine was simple enough, but as mentioned
before, the solution of the problem involved to
meet the required conditions of this simple en-
gine became the real challenge and was an engin-
eering feat second in scope only to that of the
atomic bomb.

It was found that a minimum of 287 pounds
of propellents per second had to be vaporized
(imagine 34.5 gallons or 2/3 of a gasoline drum

Vacuum tubes versus transistors. The object on the right
is a point contact transistor.

History even repeats itself in the field of elec-
tronics! Yesterday, “radio” was the crystal de-
tector, tomorrow, the crystal amplifier. The
“crystal” of tomorrow is the transistor, a device
employing a germanium crystal and capable of
performing efficiently nearly all the functions of
a vacuum tube. After vacuum tubes became suf-
ficiently low priced for experimenters to afford
them in numbers, the crystal became somewhat.
of a novelty in radio. Recently, however, in the
course of fundamental research into the electrical
properties of solids, an entirely new physical
principle was discovered. This principle made
possible the transistor, a vacuumless filamentless,
miniature triode.

The transistor principle rests basically on the
possibility of controlling the resistances of a ger-
manium crystal. Germanium is a crystal semi-
conductor of the silicon, a selenium type having
low resistance to current flow in one direction
and high resistance in the other. By applying
electric fields these resistances, under favorable
conditions, can be controlled and a change in the
voltage-current. relationship of one will be affect-
ed by a controlled current in the other. There are
two ways in which this effect can be accomplish-
ed. This article will deal with some of the basic
theory of the first method discovered by Bell Tele-
phone scientists, and that which is being put into
trial use in the Bell system this year. The origin-
al transistor employs two point contacts in close
proximity upon the same surface of a wafer of
germanium. These two point contacts are essen-
tial to the theory of transistor action in this type
of transistor. Further development led to a
second transistor consisting of different conduc-
tivity types of germanium, placed in such a man-
ner that transistor action phenomena occurs be-
tween surfaces of conductivity types, and is in-
dependent of the electrical contacts which are
made to the outside surfaces.

Before a treatment of transistor action in the
Type A or point contact transistor is attempted,
the conduction phenomena of a semi—conducting
crystal will be discussed, since this phenomena is
responsible for transistor action. For all practi-
cal purposes, substances are divided electrically

ly all the functions of a vacuum
tube.

into two main classes, conductors and insulators.
In metals which are good conductors there is ap-
proximately one current-carrying electron to
every atom, while- in insulators there are prac-
tically no such electrons and therefore little con-
ductivity. Semi--conductors are intermediate in
property between these two. The most common
semi-conductors are sillicon, selenium, certain
metallic oxides and germanium. The conductivity
of germanium can be increased by the addition of
certain elements to the germanium. Added ele-
ments further classify germanium as to the type
of conductivity they produce in the germanium.
Elements with an unstable outer electron shell
will readily donate an electron to the germanium,
producing n-type (negative type) conductivity.
This donation of free electrons comes about
through normal electron bonding. The addition
of electrons does not, however, give a net nega-
tive charge to the germanium. If an added atom
were electrically neutral when added, it will re-
main so once in the germanium. The net result
is that adding these impurities results in more
free electrons available to carry current; the
classification n-type indicates that the conduction
is by electron flow. A p-type (positive) german-
ium is also possible, but a discussion of it is not

relevant to this article since the transistor under
discussion employs the n-type.

A basic property of the germanium under con-
sideration is its ability to carry current in two
distinctly different ways. In addition to its nor-
mal electron flow current there may exist within
the crystal a deficit conduction or conduction by
so called “holes”. Of primary importance is this
hole current. Holes are the result of fixed elec-
trons in the crystal lattice being taken from the
lattice, leaving behind a net positive charge. This
action greatly differs from the ordinary conduc-
tion action. In ordinary conduction if two ter-
minals are placed at the ends of a conductor the
conduction consists of electrons flowing in one
terminal and out the other. Electrons do not move
with the speed of light; the electrical impulse,
however, does. The electrons flowing out of the
terminal are not the same ones that flowed in
necessarily. They are the result of the electrical
signal, transmitted the length of the conductor,
and consist of the free electrons which are locat-
ed progressively nearer the positive terminal of
the conductor. At all times, however, the total
number of electrons in the conductor is constant.
Now consider a rectifying point contact made to
a sample of n-type germanium. When current
begins to flow the electronic equilibrium is upset
at the positive terminal. Instead of the free elec-
trons leaving the germanium at this point, elec-
trons are drawn out of the crystal lattice, leaving
behind a hole or a net positive charge. For the
scope of this article it will suffice to say that this
behavior occurs; how this behavior was employ-
ed to produce an amplifier is of primary con-
sideration. Once these holes have been produced
they will drift in a direction opposite to the direc-
tion of electron drift, since they represent a net
positive charge. These holes will drift or diffuse
away from the point contact through the lattice.
If they are made to come under the influence of
a second electric field they will constitute a com-
ponent of current that is additive to the electron
flow of this second field. Once the exciting field
source is removed, the crystal will return to its
normal state; electrons will fill the holes and
neutralize the charge.

A cutaway drawing of the point contact transistor showing
the contacts resting on the germanium snrface_

Transistor action in a germanium crystal is
the result of the influence this hole current will
exert upon an impressed field other than the field
that produces the holes. In the Type A or point
contact transistor developed in the Bell Telephone
Laboratories, two phosphor-bronze point contacts
are placed in close proximity (.005 - .025 cm.
distant) on the upper face of a small block of ger-
manium. In the simplest analogy one of these con-
tacts may correspond to the grid terminal of a
triode and is called the emitter. The other is
called the collector and may be equivalent to the
plate of a triode. A large area, low resistance
contact on the base of the germanium is the third
element of the triode. When connected separate-
ly through an external circuit, each point contact
has characteristics similar to those of the ordin-
ary germanium crystal diode rectifiers, which
have high resistance to current flow in one direc-
tion through the crystal and low resistance in the
other. When the emitter and collector contacts
are distant from one another on the germanium
surface their currents through external circuits
are independent of one another. Transistor ac-
tion, however, depends on their proximity and
while the mathematical and physical considera-
tions of proximity effects will not be dealt with,
a simiplified explanation of the action will be con-
sidered when the point contacts are in close prox-
imity.

When the two point contacts are in close prox-
imity, there is a mutual influence of the fields pro-
duced by external circuits that makes amplifica-
tion possible. In operating the transistor as an
amplifier, the emitter or input circuit is biased
in the direction of easy flow or low resistance
direction. With the emitter electrically positive,
a large part of the emitter current consists of
holes flowing away from the emitter contact. The
collector is biased in the reverse direction. The
collector current is largely electron flow from the
contact to the base electrode. Biased in the re-
verse direction, the collector is negative with re-
spect to the emitter. Because of the relative
nearness of the collector to the emitter, with re-
spect to the base electrode, the collector attracts

EDITOR’S NOTE: Mr. Jones has been
a Pittsburgher all his life, having been
born here in 1922 and living here ever
since. He graduated from the Chemical
Engineering department in 1942. After
graduation he entered the army where
he served from 1942 to 1946. After his
discharge he worked for a year as an in-
spector in an army depot, then returned
to Pitt in 1947 as an instructor in Chemi-
cal Engineering. During this time he con-
tinued studying and in 1948 he feceived
his masters degree.

That a chemical engineer should,
on occasion, present himself as an
electronic circuit designer requires
some explanation. My hobby is the
design, fabrication, testing and use
of high fidelity sound equipment.

This interest started back in 1940
when I wanted to get more music
from some phonograph records than
the family heirloom—an early Victor
“Talking Machine” could yield. For-
tunately my desires exceeded my as-
sets. Instead of getting a ready made
combination I bought a turntable, a
crystal pickup, a loudspeaker, a book
on building amplifiers, and finally
some electronic components. Luck
was with me and the resulting sound
system performed better than any-
thing I could have hoped to buy at
five times the cost. Since then the
rig has been rebuilt and improved
several times. Portions of it are in-
corporated in a custom built FM-AM
Phono combination which a classmate
of mine has taken to South America.
Thus tomorrow’s rig has usually been
financed by selling yesterday’s_

A high fidelity sound system differs
from a ready built “department store”
radio in several respects. It sounds
beter. Often costing less, it can be
built into walls, closets, or existing
pieces of furniture. The component
parts may be arranged about a room
for maximum convenience and opti-
mum sound reproduction.

Phonograph pickups used are mag-
netic rather than crystal. Pressing
lightly on the phonograph record, a
magnetic pickup causes less record
wear and yields a cleaner, more faith-
ful reproduction," When I still had a
little 12” speaker costing" but $10.00,
the replacement of a good crystal
pickup by an average magnetic pick-

up produced a startling improvement.

Most serious enthusiasts do not use
record changers since none is avail-
able with sufficiently constant speed
or low noise level. Instead, a dual or
triple speed turntable is used. With
an adequate motor and a heavy 12”
turntable, the desired constant speed
and low rumble characteristics are
more nearly obtained.

Loud speaker prices range from
$20.00 to over $750.00. While I can
assure you that the inexpensive unit
will sound much better than any or-
dinary speaker, it must be admitted
that the $750.00 unit will not sound
anything like $730.00 better than the
$20.00 unit. The behavior of any loud-
speaker will depend o-n the housing
used with it. An inexpensive speaker
in a good baffle will outperform an
expensive one poorly housed, I have

done very little experimenting with
speakers other than to make listing
tests on the finished products. What
I have heard in the way of home
grown speaker combinations just
strengthens my prejudice that the
best bet is to buy a reputable speaker
combination and let the aco-ustic ex-
p-erts experiment in the sound proof-
ed chambers.

The amplifier used for driving the

loudspeaker will probably contain
more tubes than a typical AC-C ra-

dio. Although the price range of am-
plifiers is less than that of speakers,
performance, dependent somewhat on
cost, will range from adequate to
superlative. Flexibility is obtained

the treble and the bass frequencies.

The fidelity of sound reproduction
from a system will depend entirely on
the quality and correct application
of these several components, The
average TV set hides within it but
ten dollars worth of sound system.
A big combination will often differ
from a table top radio only in the
amount of space enclosed in a 1/4”
plywood box finished with a fake,
photographed “hardwood veneer”.
With perhaps two very expensive ex-
ceptions, it is quite improbable that
any radio or TV set named could be
classified as a high fidelity unit, ad-
vertising claims to the contrary. My
own sound system is built around a
15” co-axial speaker, a diamond
tipped pickup in a transcription type
tone arm, and an amplifier and con-
trol unit more or less of my own de-
sign. It reproduces sounds which the
average listener using ordinary radio
equipment will never have heard pro-
perly if at all. Quiet passages are not
lost in the hum and noise while the
loud sections do not blast with‘ ear
splitting distortion,

In order to test and compare my
own designs, I havea laboratory set
up in my basement. Much of the
equipment is similar to that in the
electronics laboratories here at school.
However, some of the distortion an-
alysis equipment having a specialized
application is not available in even
reputable radio repair establishments.
Strange as it may seem, I do not have
a tube checker. The best test for a
tube used in high quality equipment
is its behavior when plugged into the
equipment. A tube may be passed by
a tube checker and yet behave inade-
quately in some circuit, even though
in a less critical application its be-
havior would be entirely satisfactory,

Thus has an early interest in hear-
ing good music well reproduced led
me into the field of electronics.
Through this hobby I’ve met a lot of
new friends, published several tech-
nical papers, learned a little, and
hope to continue having a lot of fun.
Like almost anyone with a hobby, I
enjoy talking about it and would like
to meet anyone with similar interests.

THE AUTHOR

 

While leafing through the pages of this mag-
azine, did you ever wonder how these words and
pictures were made to appear in the proper form
and in the proper place? The answer lies in a
process known as lithographic or offset printing.
The lithographic process is unique among print-
ing processes in that it is a photographic process
and that reproductions are made from a flat sur-

ace.

Preparing the material to be printed is the
most time consuming job in producing the SKY-
SCRAPER ENGINEER, requiring about 250 man
hours of work per issue. The material is divided
into two classes—1ine work and halftones. Line
work includes line drawings and printed Words,
while halftones include photographs. Line draw-
ings are made to proportion on white paper with
black india ink. The printed words are set up on
a linotype machine. This machine has three key-
boards, one each for capitals, lower case, and
italics, and is operated in the same manner as a

typewriter. Each key on the linotype machine
is connected to a bin of type, and when the key is
released, the leter falls into place, forming a line
of type——hence the name. After a line has been
set, a lead casting is made and the castings are
set in their proper sequence in galleys. When the
galleys have been filled they are set in a proofing
press which prints the material from the galleys.
The galley proofs, as they are called, are returned
to the staff members who must proof read them
to locate errors made in setting the type. When
an error has been located, a symbol is placed in
the column alongside the line in which the error
appears. Another symbol is placed on the line at
the location of the error. When all errors have

14

been located, the proofs are returned to the shop.
The printer, knowing the location and nature of
each of the errors, goes into the galleys removing
lines in which errors occur and replacing them
with corrected lines. When all corrections have
been made, 10 copies of the assembled type are
made either by proof press or by letter press, and
the line Work is ready for the paste-up.

The linework is cut from the press proofs in
columns and pasted into place on white dummy
sheets With blue guide lines for columns, page
numbers, and date. Wherever a halftone is to
appear, a piece of black paper of the proper di-
mensions is pasted. Each black area is numbered
in red, and the same number is placed on the

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

 

back of the corresponding halftone for identifica-
tion. The dummy sheet, when completed, is pho-
tographed.

The film used to photograph the dummy sheet
is color blind: it is unable to d1st1ngu1sh white
from blue and red from black. Hence the blue
guide lines on the dummy sheets and red numbers
on the black areas will not be reproduced. The
camera, since it has only one eye, has no idea of
depth, and although the human eye can see where
the press proof has been pasted to the dummy
sheet, the camera sees only a flat surface.

Halftones present a different problem, for
black and white, as well as an infinite number of
gray tones must be reproduced with black ink.
The halftones are photographed separately
through a halftone screen attached to the camera
between the lense and the negative holder or
ground glass.

The way in which the screens are made and
the job they do are equally fascinating. The
screens are made from optical glass approximate-
ly one eighth inch thick. Fine lines, one two
hundred fortieth inch wide are cut in the glass
under conditions of extremely accurate tempera-
ture and humidity control. A space equal to the
line width is left between the lines. When two
plates have been prepared, they are turned so that
the lines run at right angles to each other and the
two pieces of ruled glass are joined with clear
balsam cement. Each of these tiny squares, 120

to the inch, becomes a lense in itself and repro-
duces either a black or a white area on the nega-
tive. Thus the printed picture is actually com-
posed of these dots, and the proportion of black
to white dots present reproduces the various tone
values. Since there are 120 dots to the inch, these
halftones are called 120 line screen. The screen
used depends upon the type of paper used, the
quality of the reproduction desired, and the use to
which the printed product will be put. Depend-
ing on their use, screens vary from fifty line to
400 line. The finer the screen the greater the
fidelity of the reproduction.

The space provided for the halftones by the
black areas on the dummy sheet appear transpar-
ent on the negative. These areas are cut out, and
the screened halftones are stripped into place
with red masking tape.

The next step is to transfer the material
from the negative to zinc plates. These plates,
about 0.012 inch thick, are first grained—a sur-
facing process that is accomplished by covering
the plate with metal or wooden marbles and a
cutting sand, and vibrating it. The result is a
smooth surface with a grain—like appearance. The
plates are then coated with a light sensitive li-
quid. This material is put in the center of the
plate, which is spun in a light proof chamber. The
spinning insures an even coating and helps the
material dry. As the material dries, it becomes
light sensitive.

The negatives are placed on the zinc plates
in a glass faced vacuum frame to insure perfect
contact between the plate and the negative. The
plate is exposed to a double carbon, thirty-five
ampere arc lamp for a period of time dependent
upon the relative humidity and shop conditions.
The light causes a reaction with the areas on the

plates are coated with greasy ink, a black ink
with a grease base, and Washed with Water. The
areas on the zinc plate which were light har-
dened by the arc lamp are insoluble, and the ink,
because of its greasy nature sheds the water and
remains on the plate. The unexposed areas,
however, are water soluble and consequently are
Washed off, carrying with them the ink. The final
result is a plate which is inked only in the areas
where reproduction are to be made. The zinc
plates are now ready to be placed on the printing
press.

The lithograph press consists primarily of
three rolls, a ater fountain, and an ink fountain.
As the top roll, carrying the zinc plate is rotated,
a coat of water is applied. This Water is shed by
the greasy ink and Wets only the exposed zinc
surface. Next a coat of printing ink is applied.
The ink is shed by the Water, and is picked up
only by the areas that have previously been inked.
From the zinc plate the impression is transferred
to a rubber blanket cylinder, then to the paper,
which is fed between the blanket cylinder and the
impression cylinder. In this manner, the pages
are rapidly reproduced from the flat surface of
the zinc roll or plate cylinder.

Control of the Water which is applied to the
zinc plate presents a problem. If insufficient
Water is applied, the Water film will break down
and the Wrong areas will be inked, resulting in
a dirty print. If too much Water is applied, the
ink will be diluted, and the reproduction Will be
gray instead of black. Thus the proper balance of
ink and Water must be maintained.

After the pages have been printed, they are
folded, gathered in order, stapled, and trimmed,
and another issue of the SKYSCRAPER ENGIN-
EER is ready for sale.

This month’s PITT STUDENTS IN IN-

us of his experiences mining gold in Alaska
last summer. Besides his work on the PITT
NEWS, Dave is an active member of ODK

“Where did you disappear to last summer?”

a friend asked me the other day.
“Oh, I went north on the Alaska highway to

the land of the Eskimos where they mine gold and‘

woolly mammoths with a fire hose !” I told him.

Why did I go all the way to Alaska for a job

this a travel article, but the purpose of this article
is to tell future road builders and mining engin-
eers about the two most exciting things that hap-
pened to me last summer; first, I traveled the
Alaska highway, a thiryt-foot wide ribbon of

gravelled road that stretches 1527 miles through"

primitive, beautiful country from Dawson Creek
in British Columbia through the Yukon Territory
to the city of Fairbanks in the heart of Alaska.

Second, I worked three weeks in one of the
most famous gold mining camps in North America
—Fairbanks Creek, Dredge No. 8 of the Fair-
banks Explorations Co., a subsidiary of the United
States Smelting, Mining and Refining Co. Using
the hydraulic method of mining, the company
dams a stream and uses thawing pipes, dredges
and huge fire-hose like contraptions to extract the
precious yellow metal from the permanently froz-
en ground. It was here that in 1950 a hoseman’s
stream of water turned up a baby woolly mam-
moth, imprisoned in nature’s own deep freeze
chest since the last Ice Age. Still intact were the
flesh of one leg, the trunk and head, with mouth
and "eye holes still visible. It waspreserved by a
University of Alaska scientist who had been col-
lecting the un-fossilized bones, tusks and parts of
skeletons buried at the site; this baby mammoth
is undoubtedly the oldest piece of meat in the
world.

Life magazine did a spread on the discovery,
and the relic was frozen again and is now on dis-
play at the New York Museum of Natural History.

My terrific “pay-as-you-go” vacation develop-
ed from a tip from some friends last spring that

MAY, 1952

BY DAVE WINTER, COLLEGE, '52

the University’s Placement Bureau had posted a
notice offering high-paying jobs in gold mining
camps within a 30-mile radius of Fairbanks.

The hitch was that before you could earn the
$416 a month for “thaw-point driving”, you had
to get to Fairbanks, paying your own way. Even
by bus this 4500-mile trip would cost about $250,
and none of us had money in the bank.

Gambling against the chance that delay
would put us in Fairbanks too late in the March
to October mining season to get any jobs, we got
work in Pittsburgh to earn a grubstake. Then, at
2 p.m. on July 7, with a battered 1940 Packard in
which the speedometer had stopped at 86,000
miles, with about $450 cash for food and fuel,
some groceries and blankets borrowed from our
homes, and a pledge to share all expenses, we
left Pittsburgh for the Far North, fired with the
idea of journeying to what has been called “the
last American frontier.”

Thirteen days after leaving Pittsburgh, the
Packard rolled into Fairbanks on a wide-open
Saturday night. We ignored the neon» and noise
of the bars and night clubs, which at first glance
seemed to outnumber the grocery stores, and drove
through town to the other side. There we opened
our last can of spaghetti and meat balls under a
twilight sky lit by the midnight sun just below the
horizon. Then, because we were nearly broke and
still jobless, we went back into town and slept
with a roomful of hobos in the cellar of a Salva-
tion Army lieutenant’s cottage.

I couldn’t get to sleep that night. On the
Alaska highway’s worst sections, the driver had
to keep his eyes glued to the ground slipping away
beneath the radiator ornament, watching for pot-
holes, because a broken spring could mean disaster
when you are hundreds of miles from a garage.
When we stopped to stretch, this gave us a weird
optical illusion that the road was moving, unroll-
ing away from you. That night, as I tossed while
awake and dozed and dreamed, the Alaska high-
way was still unrolling swiftly in front of me,
bumpy and dusty, twisting around and over the
spectacular Canadian Rockies, across miles of
swampland and alongside great stretches of charr-
ed pine skeletons ruined by forest fires. The high-
way is not magnificent because of its resem-
blance to a turnpike. It’s magnificent because it

How to help a scraper
do its level best

Bearing applications on large-capacity scraper wheels
pose two problems to design engineers. One is the heavy
loads. The other is wear. Engineers solve both problems
at once by mounting scraper wheels on Timken® tapered
roller bearings. Line contact between rollers and races
of Timken bearings provides extra load-carrying capacity.
The true rolling motion and incredibly smooth surface
ﬁnish of Timken bearings practically eliminate friction
and wear within the bearing.

Mounting scraper wheels
on T|MKEN® bearings

This is a standard wheel application showing indirect mounting of
Timken bearings. The bearings are adjusted by means of a nut. ‘-
Cups are mounted in the counterbored hubs. The use of Timken
bearings in this application keeps the shaft concentric with the
housing, thus the seals are more effective in keeping dirt out,
lubricant in.

MEASUREMENT

Management and labor have accepted Methods Time

Measurement as a yardstick which is fair to all.

Every day in American industry thousands of
valuable man-hours are unnecessarily wasted, and
thousands of dollars in needed production and in
take-home pay are literally thrown down the
drain. For want of a simple, accurate, and stand-
ard method of performing and measuring an un-
limited number of industrial jobs, this condition
has existed as long as manufacturing has been
carried on.

For many years management has been search-
ing for a procedure to establish production stand-
ards that would eliminate the element of judg-

'ment of the methods engineer when devising a

method for performing an operation and estab-
lishing a standard time in which to perform it.
Generally accepted time studies although taken
by experienced men can not always be the basis

for a standard because the judgment of every
man differs.

In 1940 Methods Engineering Council organ-
ized a methods improvement training program
for time study men with the purpose of removing
inequities and improving poor methods ever pres-
ent in industry. As the program progressed, it
was observed that while inefficiencies were being
corrected on the job, new jobs were being intro-
duced with the same inefficiencies. As a result
of these conditions it was decided to set up data
from which it would be possible not only to stand-
ardize existing jobs, but to provide standards for
setting up new jobs. Thus is seemed that in-
dustry now had a valuable tool in M. T. M. or
methods time measurement with which to aid
time study work.

Does M. T. M. answer the big question in in-
dustry today concerning what constitutes a fair
day's work? Management was the first to be ap-
proached and the first to accept M. T. M. Will
M. T. M. be accepted by unions? Will the system
solve the many disagreements between manage-
ment and labor as a result of present time study
procedures? There is every indication that M.
T. M. will do these things. M. T M. has been used
and enthusiastically accepted, almost demanded
by many industries. Although there is some op-
position, several union leaders, when questioned
as to the merits of M.T.M., have accepted it whole-
heartedly, saying that at last there is a system
that shows no prejudice. With M. T. M. the job
is measured, not the man doing the job.

THE SKYSCRAPER

Why does M. T. M. promise to be a valuable tool
for setting fair standards? In their book, Meth-
ods-Time Measurements, H. B. Maynard, G. J.
Stegemerten, and J. L. Schwab say “Methods-
Time Measurement is a procedure which analyzes
any manual operation or method into the basic
motions required to perform it and assigns to
each motion a predetermined time standard which
is determined by the conditions under which it is
made.” M. T. M. is based on the theory that near-
ly all industrial jobs can be broken down into
seven basic elements or motions—reach, move,
turn, grasp, position, disengage, and release. In
order to determine the standard time for per-
forming a job in question, the experienced engin-
eer has only to analyze the task into these basic
motions and apply to them predetermined time
values. The total being equal to the sum of its
parts, the engineer then adds the individual times
to get the standard time for performing the oper-
ation.

M. T. M. data has proved itself unquestionably
accurate, often within one half of one percent of
stopwatch standards. With four years of study
and experiment by its originators, Maynard, Ste-
gemerten, and Schawb, M. T. M. data were com-
piled from results of micro-motion study film
analyses of jobs employing the seven basic mo-
tions. For example, data on the motion reach

were collected by analyzing 1350 feet of motion
picture film taken of 36 different drill press
operations. Upon first analysis the data did not
fall along any definite trend lines. As a result
of further investigation it was found that the data
fell along several curves depending upon the con-
ditions under which the motion was made. It
followed that time values for the basic motion
reach depended upon the distance moved and the
class of motion it fell into as shown by the data in
table 1. A very small time unit was needed to
measure the basic motions which were of short
duration and a convenient unit called a TMU
equal to 0.0006 minute was chosen. Similar pro-
cedure was used to establish time values for the
remaining six months.

Reach is the motion employed when the purpose
is to move the hand to a destination. Reaching
for a pencil laying on a table is an example.
Transporting that pencil to a sheet of paper, to a
destination, would be the motion move. The opera-
tion of screwing a light bulb into a socket, once
the bulb has been started, requires three of the
seven basic motions. Turn, one required motion,
would be employed when rotating the hand and

. wrist about the long axis of the forearm with the

light bulb or without it. Releasing the light bulb
at the termination of each turn is an example of
the basic motion release which is the element em-
ployed to relinquish control of an object by the
fingers or hand. Grasping the light bulb at the
completion of a turn of the hand without the
bulb in order to repeat the cycle constitutes the
third required basic motion, grasp. An example
of position would be the motion employed to align
and engage the cap of a fountain pen with the
body of the pen, and removing the cap from the
pen, that is, breaking the contact between the
two objects employs the seventh element, disen-
gage.

In order to further illustrate the procedure of
methods time measurement, consider the task of
determing the time required for a person to as-

semble a square- 3/4 inch nut on a 3/4 inch bolt. ’

Experiment shows that to screw the nut on com-
pletely requires seventy-one 75-degree turns, 36
turns of the hand rotating with the nut and 35
turns without. The description of the motion of
the hands, the M. T. M. notation, and the time
measurement units for the motions are recorded
on a methods analysis chart. In cases where
simultaneous motions of the right and left hands
are used in the assembly, the time for the motion
of longest duration, the controlling motion, is
recorded.

With the bolt and nut in a position four inches
apart the assembly operation begins when the
assemblyman moves his left had toward the nut
a distance of six inches as illustrated in the pic-
ture study. Reference to the M. T. M. data in
Table 1 shows for a six inch class A reach, R6A,
a time of 7.0 TMU. The second motion is grasp,
employed when the bolt and nut are grasped by
the left and right hand respectively, and the no-
tation is G1A for each motion.

The next motion in order of assembly is move,

The Odorout Lamp Bulb

ELECTRICAL l_)EODORANT _

In 1945 Westinghouse E1ectric_C_or-
poration introduced a deodorizing
lamp that utilized ozone to destroy
odors. This lamp emits ultraviolet
rays with a wave length of about 1850
Angstrom units. These radiations
change some of the oxygen surround-
ing the bulb into ozone, which then
oxidizes the odor molecules in the
air. Now, as a result of a completely
unrelated lamp engineering investi-
gation, a more powerful deodorizing
lamp has been developed.

The new lamp, called the Odorout,
was developed as a by-product of re-
search aimed at improving lamp start-
ing and emits about three times more

ozone-producing ultra-violet. A special
glass bulb is used to transmit more of
the ultra-violet frequencies, .

This 31/2-watt, 12-volt bulb lasts six
months when operated 24 hours a day.
It can be operated from a standard
110-volt single-phase, a-c source by
using a special fixture containing a
built-in control device, such as a
transformer, to limit the current and
voltage.

The new lamp eliminates unplea-
sant odors from cooking, smoking,
dampness, mildew, and_ perspiration
more efficiently and quickly than the
old lamp and is recommended for use
in the home and in physicians’, den-
tists’, and business offices.

 

STEEL RESEARCH _

According to the United States
Steel Company, research _in steel and
materials for steel is going forward
today hand in hand with the tremen-
dous expansion program of the‘ steel
industry. The necessity of this re-
search is obvious, and even through
the severe depression years of the
1930’s—when steel production at one
time sank to a low of 15,000,000 tons,
as compared with the more than
105,000,000 tons produced in 1951—
research continued. The many _ad-
vancements made during that period,
as well as during the war years, were
vital to the development of military
equipment with which that struggle
was won. _ _

Much of today’s research is bein
directed toward the solution of one o
these problems, the shortages of criti-
cal materials which are seriously
threatening the industry’s capacity
operations. As an example, take the
shortage of scrap, which has prescrib-
ed recourse to the use of more blast
furnace iron when and if available
and thus has brought intensified re-
search to bear on all of the elements
of the blast furnace operation. Loss
of Russia as a major source of man-
ganese, so essential to the steelmak-
ing process, has intensified research
on processes for recovery of mangan-
ese from open hearth slags and from
lean domestic ores, The uncertain
supply of aluminum, used in deoxi-
dizing molten steel, has accentuated
the search for possible substitutes.

USS officials cited the well known
“National Emergenry Steels” develop-
ed by the industry during the war
years to conserve rapidly dwindling
stocks of strategic alloys. These steels
stretched the supply of critical alloy-
ing materials, in effect, to almost
twice its actual size, and the situation
was saved. Recent perfection of boron
steels now serving extensively in the
present emergency has subsequently

MAY, 1952

cut to about half the amount of the
already reduced alloying elements
needed for certain steels. The use of
boron, which is in abundant domestic
supply, is conserving vast quantities
of molybdenum and of imported
chromium and nickel, thus greatly
extending the supply of indispensable
alloy steels.

Reviewing the developments in tin-
plate, one of the industry’s largest
products, reveals that countless im-
provements have been and are being
made both in the product and in the
process of manufacturers. An investi-
gation by the Army Quartermaster
Corps reported that the useful life of
tin can food containers has been in-
creased by at least a third and in
some cases more than doubled within
the past two decades, And fortunate-
ly, when most of the Far Eastern tin
producing areas fell to Japan in
World War II a process for the elec-
trolytic coating of tinplate requiring
less than half the amount of tin con-
sumed by established methods had
just been developed and was ready
for production. Further development
of the electro-tinning method has now
led_ to the production of coating re-
quiring as little as one fifth of the
amount of tin formerly used.

Of particular importance is the
steel industry’s research on oil indus-
try goods, where notable advances
have been made on products for oil
industry production and distribution.
Among’ these are a recently developed
011. well casing having a known yield
point of_ 110,000 pounds per square
inch, which has proved its merits for
the satisfactory completion of deep
wells _where the limitation of previous-
ly existing grades had interfered to
considerable extent with the deep
well exploratory program. Other de-
velopments for the oil industry in-
_clude a new type casing joint which,
in tension, exhibits approximately the
same strength as the pipe itself with-

out requiring an increased cross sec-
tional area of the ends by upsetting;
and a method whereby seamless pipe
for transmission lines will be expand-
ed by new type equipment designed
to produce higher strength pipe to
handle the increasing pressures adopt-
ed for transmission of oil and gas.

Although some of the industry’s
current research efforts are inspired
by the National Emergency, they in-
evitably blend into the work on civil-
ian requirements and contribute to
the march of rogress. For example,
it makes litt e difference whether
high temperature steels are being de-
veloped for jet engines or gas tur-
bines to be used in either combat or
passenger planes, as the problems are
substantially the same and the data
interchangeable. It is evident that
products of this type will benefit
peacetime as well as wartime Amer-
ica.

Plotting the radiation pat-
tern of a microwave antenna
is typically time consuming
and laborious. For some
time, workers in this ﬁeld
have felt a need for a contin-
uous non-manual means of
performing this operation.
The extensive microwave
activities of its Research and
Development Laboratories
have created at Hughes a
special interest in such au-
tomatic pattern-measuring
equipment.

The ﬁrst automatic ma-
chines that were at all accu-
rate were of the ﬁxed location
type and weighed nearly a

ton. The new Hughes record-
er weighs just one hundred
pounds, is more accurategand
has higher Writing speeds
than the earlier machines.
Its recording range covers
80 decibels in the audiofre-
quency spectrum. The writ-
ing speed is approximately
25 inches per second,With an
8”x11" plot, and the abscissa
or angle scale is controlled
by an electrical take-oﬂ’ sys-
tem.

In the ﬁeld of microwave
measurements, this machine
assists in determining many
things—such as the correct
shape of reﬂectors and the

proper location of feeds.The
development of such im-
proved laboratory tools is an
interesting by-product of a
large research activity, such
as that conducted by the
3500 men and women of the
Hughes Research and Devel-
opment Laboratories.

A man who was in New York with-
out any money wanted to find some-
place to sleep. He went into a hotel
and struck up a bargain with the man-
ager_ It seems that our friend had a
chain with sixty solid gold links, each
of them worth considerably more than
the cost of a room. He told the man-
ager that he would use the gold links
to pay for his room; each day the
manager would have one more link
than the previous day. Since it cost
two dollars to weld the links, the
manager wanted the man to cut the
fewest links possible. If the man stay-
ed in the hotel for the full sixty days,
what is the fewest number of links he
would have to cut?

Here’s a problem to determine
whether or not a man is a college
graduate. If he is, it will take him
fifteen or twenty minutes to work it
out. If he isn’t, it will take him at
least thirty seconds. Two ships start
out one hnudred miles from each
other and begin sailing toward each
other, each ship moving at a speed of
ten miles per hour. A gull is perched
atop the mast of one of the ships and
as the ships set sail, he flies to the
other ship, touches it, and flies back,
repeating this process until the ships
reach each other. If the gull flies at
the speed of twenty miles per hour,
how much distance does he cover?

Instead of proving that two equals
one in this issue, we’re going to prove
that every angle is a right angle. Draw
the line CB and the line BA at a
right angle to it. Now draw line CD
equal in length to AB, but at any
angle_ Draw the line AD. Next con-
struct the perpendicular bisectors of
CB and DA. Since CB and DA are not
parallel, their perpendicular bisectors
will intersect at some point G. Let us
assume that this point falls outside
the figure ABCD. Line GB equals
line GC, because G, lying on the _per-
pendicular bisector of CB is equidis-
tant from points B and C. Line CE
equals EB for the same reason. Thus
triangles GBE and CGE are congru-
ent so that angles EBG and GCE are
equal. In the same manner, triangles
GDF and GAF are congruent, and
angles GDF and GAF are equal. Thus
by subtraction of equal angles, the
angles ABE and DCE are equal. Since
ABE is a right angle, and DCE is any
angle, any angle is a right angle, If
the intersection of EG and FG falls
within the triangle, the same proof
applies except that equal angles are
added instead of subtracted

square feet in the rug originally, and
eight feet were cut out, he figured to
make a ten by ten rug out of the

WHAT IS ENGINEERING?

The Engineer is, first of all, a scientist. He
receives considerable training in chemistry, math-
ematics, and physics, and in addition, he is train-
ed in the art of making those sciences of some use
to mankind. This art distinguishes him from the
pure scientist and he obtains knowledge of the
art through such courses as applied mechanics,
strength of materials, machine design, plant lay-
out, applied electricity, power plants, and many
others.

He is trained to take any new scientific idea or
theory (possibly his own), reduce it to practice
( i. e., make a first model), and then make it
available to the public by producing it economical-
ly in quantity. The pure scientist .is often more
inclined to be satisfied with having developed the
new idea and to leave its application to the en-
gineer. This is the reason that the engineers
eventually become the foremen, superintendents,
managers, and even top executives of the indus-
trial companies. ~’

The engineer probably get as much, if not more
satisfaction out of his work than many other
types of people. His accomplishments are defin-
ite and he can point to them with pride. The ad-
vances of our modern way of life are largely due
to the reduction of science to practice by the en-
gineer who also completes the final step and
makes the new products available to the public.

The American system of engineering education,
more than that of any other nation, has produced
men who have the knack of economically produc-
ing items for public use.

Today engineering is rapidly approaching the
full status of a profession. Practically all states
of the union now require the engineer to be re-
gistered like the doctor or the lawyer. It is es-
sential to license the professional engineer to
guard against unqualified persons who might get
the contracts to build bridges, automobiles, air-
planes, and many other public conveyances, only
to have them collapse due to faulty design or ma-
terials. The engineer has become the guardian of
public safety. '

How Did Engineering Schools Start?

In the early schools of engineering the courses
were usually of short duration and were establish-
ed to upgrade the trades. The first formal edu-
cation in mining engineering was established at
Freiberg, Germany, in 1765, and probably the
first engineering school was established in France
as Ecole des Ponte et Chausses in 1775., Twelve
years later a college called the Pittsburgh Acade-
my, the nucleus for the University of Pittsburgh,
was established in the American wilderness.

Engineering education in Great Britain did not
start formally until the establishment of a civil
engineering chair at the University of Glasgow
in 1840. A government School of Mines was later
established in London in 1851.

Actually, formal engineering education as we
know it today was not started in the various
countries until the latter part of the 1800’s. It was
not until about 1880 that the English universities

were willing to accept this newer branch of learn-‘
mg.

In this country, West Point began to develop
formal instruction in military engineering as
early as 1817. Rensselar Polytechnic Institute
at Troy. New York, introduced studies of an en-
gineering characterin 1825, although a regular
curriculm in civil engineering was not developed
before 1839. Dartmouth College in 1851 estab-
lished the Chandler Scientific School intended to
be a school of the industrial vocations. Schools
like Harvard and Yale did not introduce engineer-
ing courses until about 1854, and the first engin-
eers were graduated from Harvard in 1852. The
first American School of Mines was established
at Columbia in 1864 and Massachusetts Institute
of Technology was established in 1868.

The Origin and Development of Engineering at Pitt

In the early eighteen hundreds, certain changes
took place in the Pittsburgh Academy which
changed its name to Western University of Penn-
sylvania. General engineering courses were
started and in 1846 two men were graduated as
civil engineers. In 1865 a chair of engineering
was established in this University. The first pro-
fessor to teach mining engineering was appointed
in 1869.

It may be seen from this historical outline that
the University of Pittsburgh was among the first
six colleges in the United States to offer instruc-
tion in the engineering sciences and probably the
first college west of the Allegheny Mountains to
foster and develop this profession.

At the start of 1846 there were no special de-
partments of engineering. In other _words, there
were no branches in this field—Just general
courses of engineering were offered. The modern
development of the School of Engineering at the
University started when Professor D_aniel_ Car-
hart became the professor of civil engineering in
1882. The records indicate that engineering
ceased to be a department and became a school in
1882, at which time Dr. Carhart was made the
first Dean of Engineering. From that point on,
the various departments were organised and de-
grees were granted in the special divisions, such
as mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering.

The establishment of the School of Mines by
the state legislature came shortly after these de-
velopments and this school was formally founded
in 1895. During the early years the two schools
were separated and each had a different dean.
Since 1921, however, the Schools of Engineering
and Mines have been combined administratively
and, at the present_time, they operate as a single
unit of the University. _ _

A few other items of history might be of inter-
est. For example, the first building to be con-
structed on the present campus was State Hall.
This was built for the purposes of the School of
Mines and with state funds. In 1909 Thaw Hall
was built for the School of Engineering and this
was partially financed by subscriptions from the
people of Pittsburgh.

The interest in engineering at the University
at the turn of the century can be best exemplified
by the fact that at that time the entire University
consisted only of The College, the School of En-
gineering, and the Allegheny Observatory. At
that time there were fewer than eighty students
in the University and the majority of these were
enrolled in engineering under Professor Carhart.
Some of the science and engineering pioneers in
the early days at the University became world re-
nowned, Brashear, Langley, and Fessenden were
responsible for the first large reflecting astrono-
mical telescope, the first or second airplane, and
the first radio broadcast, respectively.

It is not generally known that the University
of Pittsburgh Schools of Engineering and Mines
established one of the first co-operative programs
of engineering education in the United States.
This program involved the efforts of the student
both by working alternately in industry and on
the campus. This not only aided in his support
but gave him a knowledge of industrial operations
at the same time that he obtained his engineering
education. This program was highly successful
but was dropped after 1929 because of the diffi-
culties in arranging co-operation with industry in
the midst of a major depression.

SCHOOL YEAR

I-n 1950 the U. S. Department of Labor and
several popular magazines published a report
that engineers were a “dime a dozen.” This was
an unfortunate error. Actually, there was a short-
age at the time and there will continue to be a
shortage at least until 1956 when it is hoped that
engineering school enrollment will have reached a
normal level again.

The reason for the misstatement in 1950 was
that at the peak of veteran enrollment and gradu-
ates, the country went through a series of strikes,
(coal, steel, automotive, etc.) , so that employment
of graduates was postponed until the strikes were
settled. One only has to read the papers to see
the great number of advertisements for all types
of engineers. In the spring of 1952 more than
1,200 industrial representatives were scheduled

to interview 200 engineering graduates for posi-
tions.

A considerable amount of publicity has been
given the fact that there is a current shortage of
engineers but not too much has been said about
the extent of the shortage or how long it is expect-
ed to last. The above chart will reveal these points
so that a quantitative idea may be obtained re-
garding the shortage. It may be seen that the
peak enrollment in 1947 was only temporary and
that since that time the number of freshmen has
equalled the number of estimated graduates.

The present number of freshmen needed to pro-
duce the 30,000 graduates needed per year is about
60,000 but the present freshman enrollment is
only about 30,000. The estimated number of
graduates for June, 1952 is 22,000. There are
four or five jobs available for each man.

The
Westinghouse
Plan

 

Time is precious to you. False starts, second guessing and indecision
are costly.

We have devoted years of study to develop dependable ways to help
you get set in the "right career.

The Graduate Student Training Program is the result. This is the
medium for orientation and training of technical and professional men
coming to Westinghouse from colleges. From this training program come
most of the key personnel in technical, commercial and supervisory
positions throughout the company.

This program gives an understanding of Westinghouse, its products
and operations; shows how your college training may be applied at
Westinghouse; and helps each man, with the assistance of trained coun-
sellors, to ﬁnd the type of work for which he is best ﬁtted.

The result pays off . . . to you . . . to us. For more information about
the Westinghouse Plan, send forta copy of our book—“Finding Your
Place in Industry”. A copy will be sent without obligation. G-10166

ACCREDITATION

The present status of the departments in the
schools is best exemplified by the fact that all
are accredited by the Engineers’ Council for Pro-
fessional Development which is the only accredit-
ing body for engineering schools in the United
States. One of the most popular beliefs by indi-
viduals not associated with the engineering pro-
fession is that such schools are rated in decreas-
ing order of their excellence. This is not correct.
In fact, the only recognized rating which is given
to engineering schools is that of the Engineers’
Council for Professional Development to the ef-
fect that the department is either approved or not
approved.

Engineering curricula throughout the country
are essentially the same. This is largely true be-
cause the Engineers’ Council for Professional De-
velopment maintains certain high standards in
mathematics, chemistry, physics, and other basic
sciences, as well as a minimum number of special
engineering courses which are deemed necessary
to an engineering education. In addition to this,
each engineering department emphasizes some-
what the specialties of the faculty members and
’it_‘hus emphasis is placed on certain aspects of the

ield.
Undergraduate Enrollment

Starting with the early thirties and developing
through to the early forties, the Schools of Engin-

eering and Mines have grown steadily. For ex-
ample, in 1941 there were 926 students enrolled
in both schools—the largest enrollment was en-
countered in 1948 when there were 2,343 students
enrolled in all courses. At the present time there
are 1,056 students enrolled and it appears that
the enrollment will increase again for the next
few years.
Graduate Students

The graduate Work of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines is developing at a rapid pace. In
fact, with a decrease in the undergraduate enroll-
ment, it appears that more attention will be paid
the large numbers of part and full-time graduate
students. At the present time there are 900 grad-
uate students enrolled in the Engineering and
Mines Schools, 522 of whom are in the Graduate
Work in Industry program.

In this program such companies as the Westing-
house Electric Corporation, the Aluminum Com-
pany of America, Philadelphia Company, United
States Steel Company, Gulf Research & Develop-
ment Company, Jones & Laughlin Steel Company,
and the Koppers Company, Inc. are co-operating
currently. The students attend some specialized
courses taught by company personnel and some
courses are taken on the campus. The thesis
work is generally done on the campus under
faculty supervision.

The Aeronautical Engineering stu-
dents shown above are preparing a
model for study in a wind tunnel.
Wing and fuselage design, as well
as study of high speed power plants
such as turbo-jets, etc. keep these
students busy. They are Thomas
Sullivan, Crafton High School ’45,
and Leon Noga, Johnstown High
School ’46.

Filbert E. Spinelli, McKeesport Technical High School ’48, a senior in the Chemical Engineering Depart-
ment, is shown here operating and reading the gauges of a Podbielniak Distillation Column. The Chemi-
cal Engineer is trained to operate and judge the importance of many such apparatus as this and his con-
fidence in himself and his field of engineering increases as he proves that Chemical Engineering theory
can be proven in practice.

About 650 chemical engineers have graduated
from the department with the Bachelor of Science
degree, 90 with the Master of Science degree, and
more than 40 with the Doctor of Philosophy de-
gree. These graduates have accepted positions
in almost every state in the union, Where they
have assisted in the development of petroleum,
chemistry, metallurgy, and other industries.
Nevertheless a large percentage of these gradu-
ates are employed by industry in the Pittsburgh
area, where they are at work in the plants and the
laboratories of important industries and research
centers. The department also trained about 800
employees of local industry during World War II
in order to increase production and meet the un-
usual conditions of that period.

This was the first department of engineering to be estab-
lished at Pitt. It was a natural development from the original
“Department of Engineering” from which the first students
graduated in 1846. _ . _ _

For more than one hundred years Pitt’s civil engineering
graduates have become executives in companies whose busi-
ness it is to design and construct buildings, bridges, roads,
railways, dams, tunnels, water and sewage systems.  L

This department is one of the earliest of its type in the country. It has long been known

for its training in AC and DC power equipment. Its Professor Reginald Fessenden was the first
V person ever to successfully broadcast music and the spoken word by radio in 1906, fourteen years
before the first commercial broadcast.

Today electronics is a standard course in all electrical engineering departments and that
at Pitt is no exception. This department has been fortunate i'n its association with the Westing-
house Electric Corporation as well as with other electrical companies in the district. More than
two hundred Westinghouse electrical engineers are currently taking graduate courses at the Uni-

versity.

The industrial engineering course is relatively new and yet it is rapidly becoming well
known. In some schools it has been called Management Engineering and it is concerned with the
evaluation of processes and the determination of how they can be made to operate most efficiently.

The industrial engineer is taught some of the principles of the various branches of engin-
eering, but in addition he is taught the essentials of business—accounting, cost finding, economics,
business law, etc. He is often an expert in personnel problems.

Industrial Engineering students study how to increase production and
keeﬁ the production lines moving. Here Thomas Dillis, Ansonia, Conn.

The power development and transmission to automobiles, aircraft, and even steel
plant machinery are types of things in which the mechanical engineer becomes expert.
He is trained to take charge of the installation, maintenance, and operation of power
plants, heating and ventilating, gas, automotive, aeronautical, and refrigerating equip-
ment as well as many others. The mechanical engineers often become the executives who
operate our industrial plants. (See also Aeronautical Engineering).

The metallurgical engineer today has almost an unlimited number of opportuni-
ties. Some of the positions in which he is found are: Open Hearth Superintendent,
Plant Metallurgical Engineer or Chief Metallurgist, Metallurgical Sales Manager, Quali-
ty Control Metallurgist, Research Metallographer, Aircraft Materials Engineer, Alloy
Steel or Carbon Steel Metallurgical Engineer,Rolling Mill, Blast Furnace or Foundry
Superintendent, Foundry Engineer. Some metallurgical engineers with administrative
ability become company presidents or executive officers, while others of varied profes-

Department Established: 1895

Mining is one of the oldest industries. Without
it other industries would cease to exist from want -1
of materials and fuels such as coal. Mining in-
volves the application of many other kinds of en-
gineering principles to the extraction of various
minerals and coal from the earth. A mining en-
gineer may become a mine operator or a specialist
in the design, maintenance, and use of mine ma-
chinery. He also may become expert in the hand-
ling and treatment of the minerals after their ex-
traction. Ore beneficiation, classification, flota-
tion, washing, are all interesting specializations
of the mining engineer.

       

The Mining Engineer does not always work below ground.
He removes the valuable ores and coal wherever they are
found in the earth's surface. Here Irwin H. Kotovsky,
Taylor Allderdice High School ’48 and Edward W. Corey,
Monongahela High School '46, Mining Engineering students

The Petroleum Engineering Department at Pitt
was the first to be established in the United States_
The first courses in oil and gas production were
taught here in 1910 and the first petroleum en-
gineering degrees were conferred in 1914. At the
present time there are only eleven other accredit-
ed petroleum engineering departments in the en-
tire country. The undergraduate enrollment in
the department has always been held to about 125
students, thus giving opportunity for close per-
sonal contact between the departmental faculty
and the students.

Because of the wide distribution of oil opera-
tions, the graduates of this department are per-
haps more widely scattered than those of any
other engineering department in the University.
The more than 700 alumni of the department are
scattered through the twenty-seven oil producing
states and eight foreign countries. Twelve are
Presidents or Operating Vice Presidents of Oil
Companies.

  
  

Petroleum Engineers must not only locate oil in the eart_h’s
crust, but they must drill for it and pipe it to the_ref1n1ng
centers. They must study the properties of materials used
in oil production. Here Robert E. Kretzler, _Sew1ckley
High School ’43, and Harry J. Kozik, Duquesne High School
'40, investigate the properties of oil well drilling ﬂuids in
a Stormer Viscosimeter.

ADVANTAGES OF THE ENGINEERING AND
MINES SCHOOLS AT PITT

There are many advantages in the Engineering
and Mines Schools at Pitt. Some of these may be
well worth recounting. In the first place these
schools are a part of a great university. This is
a distinct advantage in that it permits the stu-
dents of the Schools of Engineering and Mines
to take elective courses from many other branches
of the University such as in The College and the
School of Business Administration. This is_an
advantage which is not enjoyed by engineering
schools which are not associated with a university
with its many divisions. In this respect the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh is probably similar to the
mid-western state colleges.

Another advantage of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines at Pitt is its location. Here in the
heart of one of the greatest engineering centers

of the world, the University of Pittsburgh has
the excellent association and co—operation of many
of the industries in this district. Lecturers from
industry may be obtained with ease to discuss
matters of an engineering nature with our stu-
dents. Similarly, it is easy to arrange plant trips.

With the city of Pittsburgh progressing as it
is today, the future of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines at Pitt will be exemplified by increas-
ing usefulness to this district. A recent survey
of the undergraduate students indicated that
some ninety-five per cent are from the Pittsburgh
area and that some eighty-five per cent remain
in Pittsburgh after graduation. This is typical
of the service which has been rendered by the
Schools to the industries in this area.

ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS

Admission to the freshman class of the School
of Engineering or the School of Mines is in accord
with the general requirements of the University
governing admission. In addition, there are spe-
cific requirements as follows:

(1) Admission requires that the applicant pre-
sent evidence of graduation from an accredited
high or secondary school and a minimum of 15
units in the following subjects:

(2) The Schools of Engineering and Mines do
not accept the following preparatory or high
school units:

. Vocational units.

2. Related units (such as related English and

related mathematics).

3. Units obtained by U. S. Armed Forces In-

stitute examinations.

Elective Subiects
Elective units must be presented from the sub-
jects listed in the following group:
Civics, economics, history, journalism, pub-

lic speaking, speech, Latin, Greek, French,
German, Italian, Spanish, algebra, geometry,
trigonometry, general mathematics, or com-
mercial arithmetic, astronomy, botany, chem-
istry, physics, zoology, geology, general
science, general biology, physiology, consum-
er education, fine arts, music physiography,
sales, and commercial law.

* Some states require three units of English for gradua-
tion whereas other states require four units. Students
having only three units of English must remove the de-
ficiency by some such means as taking the State Board
examination.

The Schools of Engineering and Mines do not
admit students with entrance deficiencies, unless
these deficiencies can be removed by standard
procedure, such as State Board examination, as
in the case of English units as stated. The Schools
of Engineering and Mines have an Admissions
Committee to which special requests are ultim-
ately referred.

Applications to all departments of the Schools
of Engineering and Mines may be made by writ-
ing to the Registrar, 1817 Cathedral of Learning,
University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh 13, Pennsyl-
Vania.

For further information regarding any of the
engineering courses, write Dean G. R. Fitterer,
106 State Hall, University of Pittsburgh, Pitts-
burgh 13, Pennsylvania.

The first scientific development of the principles of aerodynamics
were developed by Professor S. P. Langley at the University’s Allegheny
Observatory in the 1880’s. Professor Langley was at the Observatory for
twenty years following which he became secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitute in Washington. While there he built one of the first man-carrying
airplanes ever to sustain successful flight. Langley Field in Virginia is
named after him.

INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING

Since graduating with high honors
from the Industrial Engineering de-
partment in June 1950, John Cuturilo
has made considerable progress with
the General Electric Corporation. Mr.
Cuturilo went with General Electric
as a test engineer in their training
program upon his graduation from
Pitt_ After completing the program,
he was sent to their jet engine plant
at Lockland, Ohio in June 1951 as a
welding engineer. He is presently in
charge of a welding application group
on jet engines. This position involves
the reviewing of welding designs fo-r
jet engine application, determining
causes of welding failures and recom-
mending design change to eliminate
those failures. He is also in charge of
a welding school for certifying air-
craft welders. This work requires a
working knowledge of all the welding
processes, methods and work station
layouts, and a knowledge of fixturing.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

The Mechanical Engineering de-
partment reports the promotion of

.Mr. Michael Zoltun to the position of

Vice President in charge of Operation
of the Steel City Engineering and
Construction Company. The appoint-
ment became effective on January 1,
1952, a little more than three years
after his graduation with honor in
September 1948. The position in-
cludes the general supervision of the
manufacture, transportation, and erec-
tion of rolling mill machinery, soak-
ing pits, furnaces, and machine tools,

ELECTRICAL. ENGINEERING

When the “lights go on” at the
Greater Pittsburgh Airport this
month, Lawrence W. Hornfeck, Pro-
fessional Engineer, Eta Kappa Nu,
Sept. ’46, theoretically, will be pull-
ing the switch. He was largely respon-
sible for the design of the electrical
facilities for the airport. Since 1948,

tion certificate as a Professional En-
gineer in March 1951 and is currently
serving as Corresponding Secretary
for the Pittsburgh Chapter of the
P.S.P.E.
METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING
Every member of the Metallurgical
alumni no doubt felt a personal loss
upon learning of the death of Mr.
William J. Laird, 1618 Beechwood
Boulevard, on February 29, 1952, A
1923 graduate of the metallurgical en-
gineering department and an active
member in alumni affairs, Mr. Laird
was superintendent of the Westing-
house Electric Corporation’s Feeder
Division, and formerly superintendent
of the Brass and Iron Foundry. One
of Mr. Laird’s avocations was the

casting of testimonial plaques such as
the one which he is shown present-
ing to Dean Fitterer at his testimoni-
al-inaugural dinner last November.

 

Mr. Laird is presenting the plaque,
which he cast, to Dean Fitterer at the
testimonial-inaugural dinner on No-
vember I6, 1951.

PETROLEUM ENGINEERING

Mr. Paul D. Torrey, Bachelor of
Science in Petroleum Engineering,
1925, was awarded the honorary de-
gree of Doctor of Science by Marietta
College, Marietta, Ohio at their
Founders Day exercise in February,
1952. The College cited Mr. Torrey’s
qualifications for the degree as his
“outstanding leadership in the pro-
fession of petroleum engineering in
the United States”. Mr. Torrey’s work
has been of national significance in
the development of methods for sec-
ondary recovery of oil. ‘He is chair-
man of the Secondary Recovery Ad-

visory Committee for the Interstate
Compact Commission, Mr. Torrey is,
at present, president of the Oil Re-
covery Chemicals Company at Austin,
Texas.
AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
Donald D. Martin, who was gradu-
ated from the Aeronautical Engineer-
ing department in June, 1950, recent-
ly received a commendation for his
contribution in safely landing the
XC-99 cargo transport. Mr. Martin is
currently employed as a service en-
gineer by the Consolidated Vultee
Corporation. The incident occurred on
a night flight from McClellan AFB,
California, to Kelly AFB, Texas. The
cargo counterpart of the B-36 bomber
was approximately two hours out of
McClellan flying at 19,000 feet with
68,00 pounds of cargo aboard when
three of the six engines lost power
due to electrical difficulties. Mr. Mar-
tin crawled into the wing section be-
tween number two and three engines
to check fuses on the distribution
panel. It is a difficult trip into the
wing, but it was not new for Mr, Mar-
tin and on this occasion he received
a “well done” for his contribution in
enabling the cargo ship to land safely.

MINING ENGINEERING

Mr. Edward L. Fish, June ’41, was
made District Sales Manager of the
Drill, Bit, and Tool Division of the
McIntosh-Hemphill Company in Mid-
land, Pennsylvania on February 1,
1952. His position includes the distri-
bution and selling of machine bits
and drills to the various coal com-
panies in the Tri-state district. Mr.
Fish also supervises the engineering
development work on new types of
machine bits.
CIVIL ENGINEERING

That eighty-five percent of the Pitt
graduates remain in the district is
exemplified by the work of Peter
Trbovich, a 1949 Civil Engineering
graduate. A lieutenant in the original
thirteenth Air Force in the South
Pacific during World War II, he is
presently working out of the Pitts-
burgh office of the State Highway
Department. Mr. Trbovich was the
resident engineer at the Tarentum
Bridge for two years during which
time he worked out a new formula for
the use of concrete.

No man in Engineering or Mines has worked harder to im-
prove the schools than Robert Cook. Bob is probably best known
as president of the Engineering and Mines Association. One of
his most ‘outstanding contributions to the schools was his work
during the past two years as a counselor at freshman camp. Last
fall he served as head counselor for Engineering and Mines. In
this capacity he did much to help the freshmen who intended to
become active in university activities. For this work he was
tapped by Omicron Delta Kappa, leadership honor society. Among
his other services, he has acted as host for the University open
house in the fall of 1950, and host for the Engineering and Mines
open house for high school students this spring. As a member of
Sigma Gamma Epsilon, honorary Earth Sciences fraternity, Bob
has served as president for two semesters and as author of a paper
for the national fraternity magazine. With these activities, Bob has
maintained a quality point average of 2.68. One summer with

- Stanolind Oil and Gas Company in High Island, Texas, and part
ROBERT E-  time work with Alden W. Foster, consulting petroleum engineer,
Petroleum have given Bob valuable experiences in his field.

James Eriser has combined an outstanding activities’ record
with scholarship. His 2.52 average qualified him for Sigma Tau,
engineering honorary, and his activities led to his being tapped
by Omcron Delta Kappa, leadership honor society. In serving
his school, Jim has participated in High School Day when he
showed potential Pitt men the Schools of Engineering and Mines,
and in the freshman orientation program. As a member of Sigma
Tau, engineering honorary, Jim has served as recording secretary.
He is currently the president of the student branch of the American
Society of Civil Engineers, senior member of Men's Council, and
an active member of the American Road Builder's Association.
Two years a member of the Engineering and Mines Cabinet, Jim
is now treasurer and athletic chairman. Jim is also a member of
Sigma Pi, social fraternity. In this organization he has served

IAMES A- ER-ISER as treasurer, pledgemaster, house manager, and chairman of the
Civil spring festival project.

The outstanding graduate from the Industrial Engineering de-
partment is William Hahne. As a member of Sigma Tau, engineer-
ing honorary, Bill has served as social chairman and vice presi-
dent. During the past year, he has served as president of Scab-
bard and Blade, honorary military science fraternity. In his own
department, Bill is currently president of the student chapter of
the American Institute of Industrial Engineers, and chairman of
the Industrial Engineering seminar. His special interest in radium
radiography. This interest led to radiographic work on the welded
seams on Penn State's navy water tunnel, and later to an article

- on this subject in the March issue of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.

On the lighter side, Bill is an accomplished pianist, having played

in a dance band for five years. He is also accomplished in the

WILLIAM 1' HAHNE art of magic, and has entertained at University functions on several
Industrial occasions.

To maintain a 2.77 average is difficult in itself, but Ted Kisiel
has has done it while holding a part time job. In fact for over a
year he worked a full forty hours a week while carrying a full
schedule in Metallurgical Engineering. Needless to say, the job
limited his extra-curricular activities, but he has managed to par-
ticipate in intramural football, basketball, and softball and in the
life saving and water safety programs at Trees Gym. His tmo
years experience in steeel production plants has given Ted valu-

able experience in his field. After graduation, Ted intends to
THEoDo_RE I‘ KISEL study for his masters degree in metallurgy, and to further his
Metallurgical studies in mathematics.

The outstanding graduate from the Mining Engineering depart-
ment is Nicholas J. Baresky. His record shows scholarship and
activities. For his scholarship he was tapped to Sigma Tau, en-
gineering honorary. One of the most active men in the depart-
ment, Nick is resident of the Minin En ineering group and an

NICHOLAS J. BARESKY active participapnt in intramural sport: After graduation, Nick is
Mining headed for the United States Army.

26 THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

 

During his four years in Electrical Engineering, John Reihing
has won more honors than any other man in Engineering and
Mines. He was the recipient of the Eta Kappa Nu award for the
outstanding Electrical Engineering sophomore, was selected a
Junior Worthy of the University, received the Society hf American
Military Engineers gold medal for the outstanding junior military
student, and a similar award as the outstanding senior student.
He has served one semester each as vice president, treasurer, and

Military Engineers, and president of Eta Kappa Nu, honorary Elec-
trical fraternity. In ROTC, he holds the rank of cadet lieutenant
colonel commanding the second engineer battalion. John is an
active member of Phi Eta Sigma, freshman honorary, Sigma Tau,
engineering honorary, and Omicron Delta Kappa, leadership honor
society. He has also participated in intramural football and soft-
ball. Despite these activities, he has maintained an average of
2.98.

The outstanding graduate in the Mechanical Engineering
department is Arthur Mikoleit. Art started off right at Pitt by
making a 3.0 average in his first semester. For this achievement
he was tapped to Phi Eta Sigma, freshman honorary. As a result
of his first two years work, Art received the Pi Tau Sigma out-
standing sophomore award. In his junior year, he was tapped to
the fraternity and in his senior year was elected President. In
this position he inaugurated the slide rule tutoring classes. As
a result of his work, Art was tapped to Omicron Delta Kappa,
leadership honor society. This spring he was elected chairman
of the student branch of the American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers. Art also served two semesters on the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet as lounge committee chairman. In his spare time
he has worked in the photostat laboratory, which he is now man-
aging. During his four years at Pitt, Art has held a scholarship
from the Mesta Machine Company, for whom he will go to work
after graduation.

The outstanding graduate from the Aeronautical Engineering
department is Iulius Peline, from Iohnstown. During the last four
years, Iule has been active in the Iohnstown Association, Rocket
Society, Engineering and Mines Association, Society of Automo-
tive Engineers, and Sigma Tau, engineering honorary. He has
held the offices of assistant pledgemaster of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
social fraternity, recording secretary and social chairman of Pi
Tau Sigma, and chairman of the student branch of the Institute
of the Aeronautical Sciences. In addition, Iule has worked on the
naval research project at Pitt. Despite the extra—curricular activi-
ties, he has maintained an average of 2.86. Iu1e's special interest
is jet engine power plants. His thesis covers the design and con-
struction of a model ram jet, and his article, "The Design of a
Model Ram Iet" was the feature article of the January issue of THE
SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER. The jet, when completed, will be used
in classroom lecture demonstrations.

In the Chemical Engineering department Ed Flockhart has
been outstanding both in activities and scholarship. Scholastical-
ly, he stands at the top of his graduating class. As a freshman
he was tapped to Phi Eto Sigma. In his junior year has was
tapped to Sigma Tau, Engineering honorary, and Phi Lambda
Upsilon, honorary chemistry fraternity. In his own department, he
is currently president of the student branch of the American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engineers, and a member of the department's
softball and football teams. Full time employment during the
schol year at the Mellon Institute has hampered Ed's activities, but
given him valuable practical experience. After completion of serv-
ice with the Army, Ed will go to work for the Shell Oil Company
in Texas.

Since the last issue of THE SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER. the student section of the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers
has been very active. The group has made
necessary arrangements for field trips to
the Schenley Distillers Inc. and to several
other chemical industries in the Pittsburgh
area.

Approximately thirty members of the
Pitt chapter of the Institute of Aeronautical
Sciences made a trip to Cleveland March
21 to visit the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics. There the group saw an
icing wind tunnel, high altitude wind tun-
nel, 6' X 8' supersonic tunnel, cut away
views of the latest jet engines, and a
shadowgraph showing varying air densi-
ties.

Six members of the IAS attended the
regional convention at Rensselaer Poly-
technic Institute, Troy, N. Y. In addition,
ten members attended the ASME conven-
tion in Akron, Ohio, April 28.

This semester the Society of Automotive
Engineers has placed emphasis upon its
speakers, bringing several good ones into
the seminar meetings. On April 3, the
group heard a talk by Mr. T.. I. Driscoll of
Ross Gear and Tool Company. The address
was a comprehensive coverage of the fund-
amentals of steering including the two sys-
tems of power steering. On April 24, the
group heard Mr. Malcomb L. Lang of the
Elliot Company speak on turbo super-

It was announced that the chapter will

"Instrumentation During I-‘light Testing,"
based upon material gathered while work-
ing for the Convair Aircraft Corporation
of Texas. Several movies dealing with the
aircraft industry were shown to the mem-
bers.

chargers for diesel engines. This talk was
especially interesting since it employed
many of the principles of thermo and vibra-
tions which were fresh in the minds of all
the students.

MAY, 1952

 

The annual E&M Picnic was held May 9
at Main Lodge in North Park. As in former
years, a large crowd of engineers and
their dates attended.

The annual E&M Dance will be held May
23 at Danceland, West View Park. Brad
Hunt's orchestra will provide music for the
affair.

The highlight of this semester's activities
was the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers’ convention in Akron, Ohio on
April 28 and 29. Thirty-eight Pitt men at-
tended. This large group placed second in
the man—mile competition for the school
which brought the most men the longest
distance.

Beside the usual tour of the host school's
campus, the group went on a tour of the
local industries, including Firestone tir and
Firestone research. Much attention was
given to the prize paper contest, in which
one man fro each school was entered. Bob
Robinson presented a peper on rockets
(see page nine).

Highlights of the semester for Sigma
Gamma Epsilon, petroleum engineering
fraternity, was the Spring initiation held
April 30th at the Royal York Hotel. Dr.
Taylor, head of the mathematics department
at Pitt, spoke to the group. Five new mem-
bers were initiated into the fraternity.

At the end of the semester, the fraternity
will present the Tarr Memorial Award to
the outstanding graduating senior in the
School of Mines.

The American Institute of Industrial En-
gineers has concentrated on bringing good
speakers into the seminar meetings this
semester. During Religion in Life Week,
the members heard Reverend James Van
Buren speak on the mounting need for
religion in our lives. Another interesting
speech was delivered by Mr. M. S. Jacobs
of M. S. Jacobs & Associates Inc., Engin-
eers. Mr. Jacobs spoke on the importance
of instrumentation in industry today.

Athletics took the spotlight this semester,
however, as the IE's basketball team Won
not only the engineering league title, but
also the all-campus trophy. The trophy

‘ was presented at the seminar meeting of

April 24.

Om May 6 a group of students repre-
senting the Pitt chapter of the American
Road Builders Association went on a field
trip to the Conemaugh Dam. The trip was
made possible by the Corps of Engineers
of the United States Army.

employed in moving the nut and bolt toward each
other, each move a distance of two inches. Posi-
tion is required to align and engage the nut. on
the bolt while the left hand holds. The operation
of screwing the nut on the bolt is completed by a
series of grasps, turns, and releases. Because
the nut is already grasped by the right hand there
will be one less grasp motion. By actual count,
then there will be employed 35 grasps, 36 releases,
thirty-six 75-degree turns of the hand with the
nut, and thirty-five 7 5-degree turns without. Upon
completion of the last turn and release of the nut
the left hand moves the bolt and nut to the table.
The final motion of the assembly operation, re-
lease, is executed when the fingers relinquish con-

trol of the bolt as shown in the picture study.

Adding the individual times_of the basic mo-
tions gives a total of 485.9 time measurement
units. Converted, the time needed for the as-
sembly is 17.5 second which checks with the stop
Watch reading. _ _ _ .

The above example 1S typical of the application
of methods-time measurement to nearly all in-
dustrial problems in setting time standards. Not
only can accurate standards be set for Jobs al-
ready in existence, ’but_ for jobs, even whole op-
erations, in the blueprint stage. M. T. M. pro-
mises to be a valuable aid to time study work.

to be mixed with air efficiently in a space three
feet long and three feet in diameter and the en-
gine kept cool in spite of a temperature of 3000
degrees Rankine. Fuel was injected through
eighteen injector heads after first being circulat-
ed around the combustion chamber to cool the
motor and warm the fuel. The Germans com-
pleted the solution of the cooling problem by in-
geniously injecting part of the alcohol used for
fuel through some 3000 small holes in the com-
bustion chamber. The fuel spread out and formed
a protective film which reduced the heat transfer
to the walls. Leaks and distortions caused by
thermal strains were another serious problem
that was solved by supplying expansion joints
every few inches. To maintain fuel flow the fuel
had to be pumped at a greater pressure than the
220 psia chamber pressure. It was here that the
Germans displayed their greatest ingenuity by
pumping the fuel and oxidizer with a 500 hp
turbopump that was driven by steam from a hy-
drogen peroxide generator.

The range of the V-2 was determined by the
timing of the power cutoff. The cutoff device
consisted of an electronic integrator which inte-
grated the acceleration as measured by accelero-
meters.

Control was a particularly difficult problem
that the Germans did not solve completely. Sta-
bility was accomplished by means of gyroscopes,
but once the rocket was fired control from the
ground was cut off.

When the V-2 was finished the Germans had
a missile weighing 28,000 pounds. It contained
8,400 pounds of fuel plus 10,800 pounds of liquid
oxygen and it traveled over 200 miles horizontally
and reached a maximum altitude of 51' miles. It
reached a velocity of 5060 feet per second (3'470
mph) and developed 588,000 HP. with an engine
weight of only 930 pounds, This meant 633 horse
power per pound of engine.

It is interesting to note that the elapsed time
from take off to the impact 200 miles distant was
only five minutes.

The V-2 accomplished little in turning back
the Allies but it did revolutionize the science of
rocketry. The public no longer considered the
rocket an instrument for ridicule. It had seen

the weapon kill over 500 persons and destroy wide
areas of France and England. The fantastic
speeds and distances attained had firmly implant-
ed upon the public mind the possibility of rocket
aircraft.

Shortly after the war the United States Gov-
ernment awarded Bell Aircraft a contract to build
a supersonic plane, the XS—1. This plane was in-
tended to fly at 800' mph for two to five minutes
at 35,000 feet and carry 500 pounds of recording
instruments. When finished the craft contained
a 6000 pound rocket engine built by Reaction
Motors, Inc. and capable of traveling 1400 miles
per hour. In October 1947 the XS-1 became the
first man-carrying aircraft to exceed the speed
of sound. It was launched from a converted
B-29 at 35,000 feet.

At the same time the Navy began designing
a plane to fly at extreme altitudes. This plane
contained both a 6000 pound thrust rocket engine
and a J -34 turbo jet. Last February the Skyrocket
flew up to 80,000 feet at a speed of 1200 mph.
Both of these figures are records. The fuselage
of the Skyrocket is magnesium alloy and the
wings are aluminum alloy. The purpose of the
Skyrocket was to determine the characteristics of
supersonic flight and the properties of high al-
titudes.

Along with research in piloted aircraft the
United States government began research in guid-
ed missiles. Rockets became the foremost means
To learn the characteristics of
large rockets many of the German V-2’s were
brought to WSPG and fired for several years.

When the supply began to run out of the V-2’s
the Navy built its own high altitude rocket, the
Viking. This missle was built by the Glenn L.
Martin Co. and the engine by Reaction Motors Inc.
The general characteristics of the Viking were
based on those of the V-2 but better gyroscopic
control was installed and a high slenderness ratio
employed to cut down on the aerodynamic drag.
The engine of this rocket delivered 20,000 pounds
of thrust or about 1/3 that of the V-2. The length
is 54 feet with a diameter of 45 inches. Eight
Vikings have been fired and on May 11_, 1950 one
model reached an altitude of 105 miles, being
launched from the deck of the U. S. S. _.Norton
Sound. Later at WSPG it reached an altitude of

107 miles.

The history of rockets stirs our interest and
demonstrates what the engineer can do in the face
of ridicule and seemingly unsurmountable prob-
lems. Having this interest, we next want to know
what causes a rocket to move and what are some
of the characteristics of this engine.

The push or thrust results from the burning
gases being expanded rearward. They are ex-
panded rearward due to the high'pressure develop-
ed within the combustion chamber. A familiar
analogy is that of standing in a small boat and
throwing a weight over the stern. The boat im-
mediately moves in the opposite direction. The
boat is said to have suffered a momentum change.
This change was caused by the momentum change
of the rock. Momentum is defined as the product
of mass times the velocity of the mass. For the
case of the rocket the rock has been replaced by
the particles of burning gas and the boat by the
rocket. From the diagram of the simple rocket
engine the thrust becomes equal to the mass times
the velocity of the burning mass.

From this equation can be seen one of the
most important principles of the rocket; thrust is
independent of the speed of the rocket. It is only
dependent on the velocity of the jet.

The rocket, turbo-jet, and ram jet all employ

‘momentum changes for thrust but the turbo—jet

and ram jet must utilize the mass flow of the air
to obtain the mass term of the

equation and also to oxidize the fuel to obtain
burning. Since the rocket carries its own fuel,
it can go indefinitely into outer space.

As in any machine the amount of useful work
that can be obtained from a given’ amount of fuel
is of interest. For the rocket this relation is call-
ed the propulsive efficiency. From the efficiency
diagram it can be seen that less than fifty per
cent of the original energy can be tapped for use-
ful propulsion. This is because we have increased
our unavailable energy to obtain a high exit ve-
locity. This energy, being unavailable, must be
discarded without doing useful work. It is here
that we see a very useful application of entropy.
When we increase the unavailable energy we have
increased the entropy. For these reasons the
rocket is not a very efficient device compared
with other engines. Since the rocket can fly in
regions where the other cannot a comparsion on
an efficiency basis is meaningless. When com-
pared with other engines in regions where they
can fly, the rocket is advantageous in that the
horsepower developed per pound of engine is far
greater. This power is equal to the thrust times
the velocity of the rocket.

The comparison of one rocket against another
is more often done on an impulse basis. This is
merely the thrust times the time of thrust dura-
tion. From the impulse diagram it is the mea-
sure of the area beneath the curve.

To summarize the principles of the rocket:

The thrust of a rocket is equal to the mass of
fuel times the change in velocity from combustion
chamber to nozzle.

The thrust is independent of the rocket’s
speed.

The propulsive efficiency‘ is low due to the
large increase in entropy given to the jet.

The impulse is the product of thrust times
thrust duration.

Having seen some of the amazing things done
in the past with the rocket engine and a few of

'32

the basic principles, let us look into the future and
see what can be done with this engine that pro-
duces half a million horsepower at a speed of over
4000 miles per hour.

Another use.is for guided missiles. The gov-
ernment plans to spend $300,000,000 next year
for guided missiles.

Another application would be to carry sup-
plies from the earth to the proposed artificial
satellite that is to move endlessly around the
earth. Only rocket planes could carry the ma-
terials. The construction of such a satellite may
even now be a matter of life and death to the
free world for it is possible that whoever builds
an atomic bomb carrying satellite first could con-
trol the earth. This is open to question but if the
Russians do get a satellite built first and are able
to control the earth, it would be too late to con-
struct one of our own.

In the next few years this may be our first
line of defense. The completion of the project
will be the greatest engineering feat of all time.

The satellite could be used later as a way
station for the fulfillment of man’s oldest dream,
escape from the earth.

As pictured in Collier’s the satellite would be
dough-nut shaped with a center tube for landing
craft. The force of gravity at the proposed al-
titude of 1075 miles would be almost zero and in
an effort to create an artificial gravity, the satel-
lite would rotate about its own axis. This rota-
tion would create a centrifugal force, acting ra-
dialy outward at all points on the circumference.
Thus two men diametrically opposed to one an-
other would have their feet pointed in opposite
directions, each feeling that “up” would be to the
center of the satellite.

The satellite would circle the earth once every
24 hours and during this time every point on
earth could be seen. Any act of aggression or
illegal manufacture of war material could be spot-
ted by means of powerful telescope or radar and
disciplinary measures taken.

Rockets have done some spectacular things.

In the past they have been used primarily as in-
struments of war. When the development stage
of rockets is completed and the data released from
classification, it is certain that it can be made
economically feasible. The proposed satellite will
soon become a matter of life and death for the
free world. If the rocket is to carry the burden
of civilization survival it is then not only the
world’s most powerful engine but the greatest
instrument of peace ever devised. This is the
greatest challenge to the young engineer of all
time.

TITANIUM ALLOY STUDIED

“Titanium has virtually unlimited possibili-
ties,” says the Consolidated Vultee Corporation,
which is doing a tremendous amount of research
on the metal. The metal has the strength of steel
but is forty per cent lighter. It also is heat re-
sistant and non-corrosive, giving it superiority
over lighter metals such as aluminum and mag-
nesium.

Engineers believe titanium alloys can be sub-
stituted for steel fittings, high strength corrosion
resistant steel sheet and armor plate.

At present, however, the metal has one big
drawback.’

Although it is the fourth most abundant metal
in the world, refined titanium is scarce because
the technique of converting the ore to usable
metal has not been perfected. Refining now must
be accomplished in a vacuum. Therefore, cost of
the metal and its alloys is out of reach for most
industrial use.

In the B-36 alone, Convair estimates that one
fourth of the present weight could be saved by
using the new metal.

BLOTTER ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE

_ Dr. James H. Freeman, a scientist at the West-
inghouse Electric Corporation’s Research Lab-
oratories, has found a new analytical method of
determining the chemical composition of Bakelite-
type plastics.

The “Blotter” technique—more precisely called
paper chromatography—was first used by chem-
ists 100 years ago. In the last decade it was re-
vived and used in the study of proteins. Only
within the last year, however, has the method
been applied to the study of phenolic resins and
plastics.

Everyday items made from these Bakelite-type
plastics include: radio and television cabinets,
electric light -switches, telephones, electric fan
blades, the handles on electric irons, and bearings
for many machines. Dr. Freeman’s new analyti-
cal tool will have particular application in the de-
velopment of insulating resins and varnishes for
Westinghouse equipment.

_Here_ is how the paper chromatography tech-
nique _is applied:  strip of white blotter-like
paper is suspended in a large glass jar about two
feet high. Pinpoint samples of known and un-
known ingredients of a phenolic plastic are placed
at intervals along the top of the paper. The top
of the strip is held in a glass trough filled with
a solvent capable of dissolving the samples. More
of the solvent is kept in a small dish in the bottom
of the jar to keep the air inside saturated.

In much the same way that a blotter corner
draws ink from a spilled drop, the solvent begins
to “run” down the paper and carries the ingre-
dient samples with it. After 15 or 16 hours, the
solvent “front”, or its leading edge, has nearly
reached the bottom of the paper which still ap-
pears white. However, when an “indicator”
chemical is “painted” on the paper, different
colored spots appear. Ther position on the paper
enables the scientist to identify them. The color
of the spots serves as an additional check.

Dr. Freeman said the primary value of this
method of analysis when applied to resin chem-
istry 1S that it provides a specific and highly sen-
sitive technique by which given substances includ-
ing some previously unknown ones my be separ-
ated and identified.

TACONITE CONCENTRATE

G. V. Woody, manager of the processing ma-
chinery department, Allis-Chalmers Manufactur-
ing Company, has announced plans for a $75,000
pilot plant for pelletizing and heat hardening
taconite concentrates. Warning that a great
deal of testing remains to be done before the
commercial feasibility of continuous heat hard-
ening of taconite pellets can be determined,
Woody pointed out that the pilot plant is the only

34

way to make certain that successful laboratory

_ results will be borne out in practice.

The plant, being built at Carrollville, Wis., 14
miles south of Milwaukee, is expected to process
one to two tons per hour of concentrated taconite
fines brought in by rail from the Mesabi Range.

Pelletizing will be done in a balling drum and
the “green” (soft) pellets pre-dried in a rotating
drum prior to being fed to the traveling grate.
During the travel on the grate, the green pellets
will be further dried, preheated, ignited, and
burned. Waste heat from the grate is utilized in
the drying and the preheating stages to reduce
fuel consumption.

The pilot mill will also permit further study of
such problems as heat hardening of both magne-
tite and hematite concentrates without admixed
carbon.

It is planned that the product from the unit
will be shipped to a blast furnace for test in
actual iron production.

NEW S_CIENTIFIC USE FOUND FOR TV

A new use for color television which adds an-

other dimension to biological research was de-
scribed recently by RCA. They said that the use
of color television will enable the biologist to ob-
tain more information about microscopic speci-
mens than with present methods.

The new development was made possible by
hooking up an RCA tricolor picture tube to a
sensitive new ultraviolet vidicon camera which
is mounted over a microscope trained on the
specimen. The absorption of ultraviolet light by
the tissues of the specimen differs. By arbitrari-
ly assigning different colors to the tissues, the
biologist can make them emerge with individual
clarity.

The new system adds color to the cells or the
tissues by translating different wave lengths of
invisible light into electronic energy. This energy
is then translated into the three different primary
colors on a picture tube.

A specimen or thin slice of tissue which, to the
human eye, appears colorless and flat through a
microscope then can be viewed on a television
screen as a dynamic picture in color.

Although no new TV stations have
been built since 1950, television’s
reach has been extended in two ways.
In sections of cities where interfer-
ence is a problem, ﬁne pictures can
now be seen. The same is true in rural,
or TV “fringe” areas, formerly too
distant for clear reception.

RCA engineers and scientists, to offset
these «limitations, developed powerful
new Super Sets. In distant fringe areas,
these sets boost a weak or faltering signal
into a clear, steady picture. While in
cities, where buildings and electrical

devices may interfere, this same super
power—plus television’s first double-
shielded tuner—bring in TV at its best.
The result is stronger pictures in the
country and in problem areas, and better
pictures than ever before in areas of nor-
mal television reception.

is a 30-foot wide strip of civilization chiseled
through a forested, pathless wilderness by the
brute power of the two gangs of bulldozers which
started butting into the forest during World War
II. With the lead bulldozers following the line of
least resistance where trees were thinnest or the
ground was most solid, and heavy grading equip-
ment following, the two halves of the Alaska high-
way were carved out and joined, to form a vital
supply link for Canadian and American airfields.
Today it is the most scenic tourist highway in the
world, and has opened up a vast territory for set-
tlement and exploitation of mineral and forest
resources, booming tiny towns, and through pub-
licity like this, catching the imagination of people
with a yen for new horizons.

The highway finally stopped rolling through
my mind, and I went to sleep, tantalized by a
question that occured just before I drifted over
the borderland: would my friends and I find our-
selves employed or stranded without money the
next day?

In the morning, after passing up breakfast
when we looked at the menu and saw “Coffee &
1 roll——$.50”, we reported to the F. E. Co’s. office,
and were hired. Later we found that if we had
had enough money and time to wait a week or two
and get into a union, we could have had jobs as
unskilled laborers working at Ladd Air Force base
for $2.48 an hour plus overtime, instead of the
$1.31 an hour plus $1.96 an hour overtime pay for
a 63-hour, 7-day week at the F. E. Co. But be-
cause the cost of living in Alaska is between one
and one half and two times as high as in the
United States, we agreed later that the F. E. Co’s
low charge of $2.25 a day for room and board
would make our wages balance out pretty well
with laborers living in Fairbanks.

The night we were hired we got our first
view of the “firehose” method of mining. After
the camp bull cook had assigned us rooms, we
walked up over the hill behind the mess-hall and
watched tiny figures of hosemen a half-mile away
spraying great streams of water against a 30-foot-
high mud cliff. From the slight growth of brush
and grass on .the valley wall not- under attack by
the hoses, we deduced that the “artificial” erosion
had been going on for several years, cutting out
a shallow man-made valley.

36

We went back and talked to the red-headed
young timekeeper, a Boston College student, who
explained that the company used the hydraulic
method, washing away the dirt until only about
forty feet of soil and gravel covered the bedrock,
then drilling thaw points into the ground to thaw
the frozen “bedcover” so that a dredge could be
moved in to remove it and extract the gold.

“But what are these thaw points we’re sup-
posed to drive?” we asked. “Red” just laughed
and said, “You’ll find out bright and early to-
morrow morning.”

We did. Sloshing around most of the time
in water up to our ankles, we connected one end
of a one-inch rubber hose to the threaded end of
a 10-foot piece of one-inch pipe, clamped a vise
with handles on the pipe, turned on the water,
and then stood the spurting pipe on end, using
the handles to twist its pointed end into the
ground. The thaw points (see sketch) had one
end pinched to screwdriver—like point, with holes
in both sides like the football needles used to pump
up footballs.

Water spurting through the holes made the
pipe go down easy, but after we added the first
ten-foot extension pipe, the point usually hit the
perma-frost at about 15-18 feet below the surface.
When that happened, we tightened the vise, slip-
ped in 10-pound hammer of iron like a half-sleeve
around the pipe, resting it on the vise while we
slipped in the horizontal pin which served as a
handle, and then pounded the pipe into the ground
by lifting the hammer and letting it drop. Lift,
drop. Lift, drop. Put another 10-foot pipe on.
Lift, drop. Ten pounds. Dull work.

Working with us were college students from
Boston U., Hawaii, UCLA, Michigan, a wise-
cracking bunch of med students from Rochester,

N. Y., a gang of tall, big—boned jokers from Utah,
and a few drifters and Eskimos, altogether about
forty men. Since there w_ere no women at the
camp, few had shaved, and the “oldtimers” of a
month or more were conspicuous for the length
of their beards and their deep tans. Working
stripped to the waist and enjoying the hot Alaskan
summer sun, we swapped jokes and stories. They
told us about the baby woolly manmmoth and
pointed out the Life magazine clippings on the
mess-hall walls. Several of them had small col-
lections, including teeth, and complete skulls from
the pieces of skeletons turned up by the hosemen.
One man even carted home a 175-pound ivory
mammoth tusk as a trophy for his den.

The history of the camp we worked at was
interesting in other ways, too. It was first operat-
ed by an English mining company from 1917 un-
til 1933, but because the British firm’s dredge
was not big enough to go down all the way to bed-
rock where the gold lies in a heavy black sand de-
posit, the owners went into the red with a fortune
under, their feet, finally going bankrupt with a
$237,000 deficit. The F. E. Co. took over, brought
in a bigger dredge, and made the mine profitable
by paying rock-bottom wages for the area and
furnishing board and room, sure bait for the
near—penniless seasonal worker and inexpensive
to them because with eight camps in the Fair-
banks district alone they could buy blankets, beds,
and food in quantity.

We talked, too, about the artificial value of
gold. As mining-company employees we worked
nine hours a day so the company could get a few

ounces of gold from tons of rock and dirt which
they sold to the United States at $32 an ounce.
And the government buries it again in vaults in
Fort Knox!

Drilling thaw points was not back—breaking
labor, but it was a slow, grinding business, and
after romanticized Western folk lore about gold
mines where nuggets could make a man rich over-
night, the hydraulic mining and thawing process
seemed incredibly slow to us. ‘

This idea vanished when we took a walk up
the valley one night and got close to the dredge,
whichwas working over the old English dredge’s
“tailings.” Looking like something suited better
for Lake Erie than the dinky one—acre pond it was
on, it kept gobbling mouthfuls of gravel, swivel-
ing itself back and forth by cables attached to
concrete set in the banks, dripping a constant
stream of muck and rock on a 30-foot high pile
of its own tailings which rimmed one side of the
pond.

The dredge worked around the clock against
the deadline of the first freeze, and every minute
was important because delays could add up to
many thousands of dollars in lost revenue and
costly overhead. The focal point of the whole
camp was in a huge noisy rocker in the innards
of the dredge. It was cleaned out twice a month,
and bucketfuls of gold, amalgamated with mer-
cury and buried in the heavy black sand, were
carried out under guard and taken to the company
lab where the $32-per—ounce yellow stuff was ex-
tracted.

We stayed only three weeks at Fairbanks

products to the forefront.

How well this idea has worked is amply demon-
strated by the outstanding leadership record which
Pratt & Whitney has established in both piston and
turbine aircraft engine types.

And for the future, because of its sound engineering
background and research facilities, Pratt & Whitney is
one of the few companies in the country to be selected
to develop an atomic powered engine for aircraft.

You are giving away your

standard of living

ANATICS in Germany, India, even some in America,
F say we should scatter our billions over the world
in order to use up our surplus; otherwise (they say)
it will dam up on us and cause a depression.

It is entirely possible that we should give away
those billions for humanitarian reasons—that is
another matter. But don’t let’s let greedy foreigners
and stupid Americans say we’re doing it for our own
selﬁsh interests. And don’t let anyone of us think
we are doing it by“soaking the rich”. We are giving
away (and, remember, perhaps we should, so long
as we do it with eyes open) our standard of living.

You and I work, not for dollars but for what those
dollars will buy. The more t/aings there are in
America, the more your day’s work and mine will
buy. The more steel there is in America, the more
automobiles you can get at a low price. The more
cloth, the more suits you can own. The more food
there is, the better you and your family will eat.

There can only be so much of those things. When
you ship them away; you do without. You seldom
ship money abroad; money is only a token of
exchange for the things that are going out of this
country, out of your reach.

Perhaps that’s good, perhaps that’s wise. But we
should realize what we’re doing. Wha-tever we give
away abroad comes out of what we have at home.
Unless, of course, each of us produces that much
more at his machine or plow or desk every day.

If every one of us produces more eﬂiciently we
can have the satisfaction of knowing we are doing
something for the world without destroying Amer-
ica . . . the one strong hope of the world. If we
“share the wealth” with the world, we will soon
be sharing nothing but poverty. If we share our
increased production and demand increased pro-
duction in return, there will then be wealth and
strength to share.

+, When two lengths of elec-

 trical conduit are joined
together, ordinarily the point of
coupling becomes the weakest
part of the run. For this reason
the coupling is all-important.
And for this reason a Sherardized
coupling has special advantages
over other types.

 
 
   

SHERARDUCT COUPLING

 

ORDINARY COUPLING

A Sherardized coupling is gal-
vanized after the threads are cut-
every thread is zinc protected
against rust equally with the out-
side surface.

The shoulder on Sherarduct
couplings is a further safeguard.
It covers and protects the ﬁnal
threads so that no raw threads
will be exposed to moisture and
other corrosive weather condi-
tions.

Sherarduct conduit threads are
so cut and couplings so tapped
causing Conduit to butt, that to-
gether they form a practically
continuous raceway through
which wires may be drawn with-
out difficulty or injury.

Here at the joint, unless perfect
continuous grounding is assured
as it is with Sherarduct, rust ﬁrst
begins its resistance activity and
acts as a barrier.

THERMODYNAMICS

BY DAVE ABRAMS, M. E. S. S. '52

Sooner or later the engineering student at the University of
Pittsburgh is required to take a course known as thermodynamics.
In order to understand the science of thermodynamics the student
must obtain an understanding of the term related to it. For the
beginning student, I would like to present you with a few defini-
tions of the most common terms.

For example there is the term enthalpy. Briefly described,
enthalpy is so much hot nothing. By taking only one pound mass
of Water, 778 BTU’s of enthalpy may be obtained. Many indus-
trial plants are thinking of burning enthalpy as it is readily obtain-
ed and very cheap. The BTU is not the Republican abreviation of
the term “Before Truman Uprising”, but a term derived by the
British meaning hot stuff.

Next on the agenda of the thermo student is a subject known
as steam. In connection with this subject we make use of diagrams
known as TS. Until recently the chaplain distributed these dia-
grams in the form of chits after every hour exam. To make things
easy for the student, steam tables are available. It must be noted
that these are not the same ones that keep the ice cream and milk
hot in th Tuck Shop. These tables, compiled by Keenan Wynn, the
movie star, are chock full of figures (not movie stars). They are
similar to racing forms and give the weight, size, shape and color
of steam under all conditions and tell the maiden name of the
jockey’s mother. The saturated tables are very useful after heavy
weekends or fights with the girl friend.

Slyly hidden in the back of the steam tables is a Mollier chart.
This is very handy for calculating how far it is from State Hall to
the Cathedral of Learning. When unfolded, the Mollier chart
makes a perfect device for sleeping in class. If you wish to get
your chart folded back, there is a three hour lab, M.E. 126071/3 on
“Folding the Mollier Chart”.

A great deal of consideration in thermodynamics is given to,
orifices. The flow through an orifice may be calculated by:

where YMCA is not the place to go for a free bed and a swim, but

that all experimental work will agree with that given to the text.

The professors are very helpful to the student of thermo. After
drawing a Pv diagram on the board, a student asked, “How do you

Creek, because our main purpose was travel, and
we wanted to get back to the States to see more of
the Far West.

I had started out with about $200, a month’s
pay from U. S. Steel, where I worked in June.
Exactly $56.60 of that went for my share of the
$225 Packard we bought. My net pay for three
weeks 1n the gold mining camp was $175, but
because we took a side trip to Lake Louise and
Banff Park in the most scenic part of the Cana-
dian Rockies, about 200 miles over the border of
Montana, I had to stop and work for more money
in Great Falls. Montana. From there I hitch-
hiked home via the Grand Canyon, arriving in
Pittsburgh with $2 profit for a work-travel “pay-

mer by the amount of cash profit it produced.
Even ignoring the entertainment value, I think
the experience of working in a gold mining camp
and seeing the Alaska Highway had an educa-

would recommend to anybody.

——including both the nuclear reactor and the as-
sociated propulsion equipment, according to a
recent report by the company.

_ Previously, the company’s Atomic Power Divi-
s1_on had announced development in co-operation
with Argonne National Laboratory of an experi-
mental land-based nuclear reactor which will
serve as the prototype of the actual submarine
power plant. This experimental model is now
under construction at the Atomic Energy Com-
m1ss1on’s reactor testing station near Arco, Idaho.

“The submarine reactor will be the product of
the teamwork of many groups and the pooled ef-
forts of many highly trained specialists,” the re-
port stated. “When the full story can be told,
it will be revealed as one of the all—time major
accomplishments of engineering skill and co-
ordinated effort.”

Other outstanding military developments dis-
closed in the report include smaller, faster wake-
less electric torpedoes; radar and fire-control de-
vices for all-weather jet fighters; new and more
powerful jet engines; and equipment for radio-
controlled airborne lifeboats.

The projects scheduled through 1952 will lead
to increased production of transportation and
generating equipment, electronic tubes, aircraft
armament systems, lamps, small motors, Micarta
plastics, jet engines, and eventual increased pro-
duction of household appliances, radios, and tele-
vision sets. The entire program is scheduled for
completion by 1955 and should increase the com-
pany’s capacity by 50 per cent.

The quantity of electric power-producing equip-
ment now under construction in Westinghouse
plants is larger than at any other period in the
company’s history, according to the report. Major
new developments included huge turbine-genera-
tors with capacities of 185,000 kilowatts and
200,000 kilowatts, the largest single shaft units
ever sold.

The expansion programs in the steel and alumi-
num industries led to greatly increased demand
for electrical equipment during 1951, and West-
inghouse sales to the steel industry increased 50
per cent over the volume for 1950.

WEST ALLIS WORKS (Graduate Training Course 1950) Ohio State—EE—1949

SELECTING a speciﬁc job in
the engineering ﬁeld after
graduation from college is a
tough proposition for most of
us. It was for me, and that’s
why I came to Allis-Chalmers.
I thought I wanted to be a
development engineer but I
wasn’t sure. Allis-Chalmers

gave me an opportunity of
trying design and develop-
ment—and other types of work also.
By my own choosing I am now engaged

considered while in school. The point is,
all GTC’s have the same chance of
“finding themselves.”

That’s the outstanding feature of Allis-
Chalmers Graduate Training Course. You
have a very broad selection, and you your-
self choose the type of training you re-
ceive. Of course you get help and guidance
from experienced men throughout your
training period. You need it, since there
are jobs here that you have never dreamed
of.

Finds Job Challenging

Take my job for instance. To the engi-
neering student it probably sounds rather
dull when compared with Advanced Ther-
modynamics or Electric Transients in
Power Systems. But, in my opinion, the

MAY, 1952

 

FLOYD O. SMELTZ

most fascinating science is co-
ordinating engineering and
production efforts through
standardization of proce-
dures, parts and materials. As
Supervisor of the Standardi-
zation Section and Chairman
of the Standards Committee,
I encounter new problems
every day—-no monotony here.
But that is only part of the
story! I am also Secretary of
the Chief Engineers’ Committee and
Secretary of the Development and New
Products Committee. What could be more
stimulating for a young engineer than to
be at the crossroads, where he can watch
the engineering planning of an expanding
company?

No Limit to Opportunities

I never thought I’d be doing this when I
graduated from Ohio State in 1949 and
enrolled in Allis-Chalmers Graduate

AI.l.|S-CHALMERS Q

Training Course. As I mentioned, I was
particularly interested in design work at
that time. In fact, right now there is a
patent applied for on an electro-magnetic

relay device I designed. Yes, they even let i

me do development work while still a
GTC student.

A student helps plan his own courses
and is free to change his plans as new
interests, new opportunities present them-
selves. He. can divide his time between
shops and oﬂices—switch to design, man-
ufacturing, research, application engineer-
ing, sales, or advertising—and can earn
advanced degrees in engineering at the
same time.

When he graduates from the course he
is encouraged to go into the type of work
he liked best while on the Graduate Train-
ing Course.

One of the reasons Allis-Chalmers offers
so many opportunities is that A-C designs
and builds machines for every basic in-
dustry, such as: steam and hydraulic tur-
bine generators, transformers, pumps,
motors, rotary kilns, crushers, grinders,
coolers, screens, and other machinery
for mining, ore processing, cement, and
rock processing. Then there are ﬂour
milling, electronic equipment and many
others.

There is no other organization that
seems to me to offer the graduate engineer
such a wide range of activities, or that
gives him such a chance to ﬁnd the type of
work for which he is best ﬁtted.

in the manufacture of pressure vessels for air, gases and
liquids. For example, one of the most interesting methods
of cold-forming metal in use in this country today is the
Scaife Reverse-Draw Process, a revolutionary method of
forming deep-drawn shapes.

We invite engineers to contact our Personnel Director
for information about the opportunities with the
Scaife Company.

    

The Scaife Reverse-Draw Process

Shown above are some of the deep-drawn
shapes that may be made by the Scaife
process, and the press employed for the
pressing operation. This is how it is done:

All kinds of engineering iobs
call for photography

Let’s say you’re going to engineer tomorrow’s global transportation
systems—explore inaccessible areas for new mineral deposits——or that
you’ll design a new machine or product. All along the engineering
way, you’ll ﬁnd photography playing an important part.

Photography can help you choose a site through aerial photographs.
It helps you analyze structural stresses by studies of plastic models in
polarized light. It provides information on metal strength and struc-
ture through x—ray diffraction and photomicrography. It provides a
rapid means of reproducing engineering drawings full-size—or reduc-
ing them to mere frames on microﬁlm for safe, easy storage and ready
reference.

Applying photography to engineering and engineering to photog-
raphy have become specialties in themselves. This has led graduates in
the physical sciences and in engineering to ﬁnd positions with the
Eastman Kodak Company. If you are interested, write to Business and

Technical Personnel Department, Eastman Kodak Company,
Rochester 4, New York.

FUNCTIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY

—serves industrial, commercial and scientific progress

Photogrammen-y—the teclinic of surveying by
pliotographv—provides essential information for
world-wide planning of airports, pipe lines, conveyor
Systems, inineral and oil development. and all kinds of
engineering un(lc1‘tz1kings.

“The advice should go back to the sophomore level and it
‘would be to take as many fundamental engineering courses as
possible instead of specializing in one ﬁeld during junior
and senior years. The specializationwill come as a matter of
course due to participation in a phase of engineering occupa-
tion after graduation.” «

“Obtain working experience in all the jobs you think you know
nothing about and avoid your primary interest the ﬁrst year
out of college. Ignore geographic location when selecting a
job. Even Schenectady is an enjoyable place to live when you’ve
been there long enough to know how to appreciate it. Respect
and admire your boss or change bosses.” ‘

.“Too many of today’s graduates are hypnotized by the glamor
ﬁelds of rockets, jets, etc., whereas they are overlooking good
opportunities in the old standard lines.”

“Come with G.E., take advantage of opportunity to ﬁnd ﬁeld
of most interest and possible reward. Don’t jump to any fore-
gone conclusions, and don’t hurry to ﬁnd a ‘permanent’ job.”

“This is for freshmen . . . Go to a school that will give you
an excellent background in fundamentals of physics, math,
mechanics, and materials. Spend at least 25 to 30% of your
time in the study of humanities. Forget about machine shop
and drawing courses and practical application. Get your prac-
tical "experience eventually from a company. In a few years
you will be worth 10 times more to them and yourself than
the so—called practical student.”

“Be thoroughly grounded in engineering fundamentals. Ex-
periment in your likes and dislikes by trying several jobs.
Work for a company that helps you do this.”

“I think the General Electric Test Engineering Program is the
ideal employment for the graduate engineer. "He should spend
the full time on Test with many assignments to obtain the
backgroundthat will be of utmost value to him.”

“Get .a line of work in which you are sincerely interested; it
should be a pleasure to get up and go to work in the morning."

“It is a rare thing, one to be cherished as a golden opportunity,

to be able to move around on rotation, look over the best ~

facilities and opportunities of a company and thereby be able
to make a much more considered choice of where, ﬁnally, to
work. These things are all possible on the G-E Test Course.”

“If you don’t ﬁnd your work interesting after ﬁve years or
rewarded withresponsibility and money after 10 years—quit."

“I have worked with hundreds of young fellows since I was
on the Test program. Only a few of them knew exactly what
they wanted a year or even two years after graduation. One
advantage of working with a large company is that it gives
them an opportunity to observe a broad ﬁeld of activities-

everything from betatrons to garbage disposers——locomotives
_ to guided missiles. The most important thing in selecting a job

is choosing one that will keep the individuals happy, contented
and satisﬁed.” '

“Get with the company that offers the best training program‘
—the longer the better.”

“G-E Test is the best way to spend ﬁrst 2 years after school-

ANOTHER ALCOA DEVELOPMENT STORY:

In 1927, a chemical manufacturer asked us,
"Why must some chemicals be handled in small
drums or carboys . . . can’t tank cars be built
of aluminum?”

From our years of research, we knew that we
had alloys compatible with many chemicals—and
experience in fabrication methods dictated weld-
ing. The Field was inviting, and we decided to
design and pay for the ﬁrst aluminum tank
car ourselves.

Our engineers designed an 8,000-gallon tank, to
be welded together from 16 large aluminum plates.
Working with a leading tank car builder, lessons
which we had learned in other Alcoa develop-
ments enabled us to materially assist in the alloys
selected, welding techniques and structural fabri-
cation methods employed. One year later, in 1928,

the car was completed. It was then tested in
20,000 miles of road service, while hauling glacial
acetic acid—a typically tricky cargo. It weathered
3,500 recorded shocks—900 severe ones. That
aluminum car is still in service!

Together with tank car builders, we have de-
veloped improved riveted and welded car designs,
which are now “standard.” Today there are over
1,300 alurninum tank cars carrying the fussy com-
pounds that formerly traveled only in small
containers.

This is typical of the development jobs we do
at Alcoa. Others are under way now and more are
waiting for mechanical, metallurgical, electrical,
chemical and industrial engineers having the
irnagineering skill to tackle them. Perhaps you
may be one of those men. ALUMINUM COMPANY OF

INK FROM THE EDITOR'S PEN

With graduation at hand, it is only natural to
look back over the four years spent as a student
in Engineering and Mines. The schools have
undergone many changes——almost all of them for
the better. There is one change, however, that
has been a little more pronounced and a lot more
beneficial than the rest. There is now a place for
the freshman.

Four years ago we were still in the middle of a
large veteran enrollment. More than fifty per cent
of the men who enrolled in Engineering and
Mines in September 1948 were vets. There just
weren’t enough facilities to properly handle all
who enrolled. Many extra-curricular activities
had to be put aside. The freshman was a for-
gotten man.

By September 1951 things were back to normal.
The congested class rooms and accelerated pro-
gram were a thing of the past. A group of
eighteen-year-olds, fresh out of high school, and
full of energy enrolled. These men were given a
chance, and they showed their mettle.

When freshmen were permitted to participate
in varsity athletics, several freshmen engineers
went out for the team—and made it. The fresh-
men engineers have been most successful in track.
Number one man in the javelin throw is Pat
Scordo, a Chemical Engineer from Kane, Penn-
sylvania. Pat was state champ in high school
and ranked second in the nation. In the opening

meet against the University of Delaware, he
earned half of his letter by taking first place in
this event. Sprinter Joe Dudas, an Electrical
Engineer from East Palestine, Ohio runs the 440
yard dash and is a member of the mile relay team.
The end of track season will find him a letterman
too.

Freshmen have also been active in other fields.
Edgar Daer, a Chemical Engineer from Wilkins-
burg, has been active on the staff of the SKY-
SCRAPER ENGINEER. From all indications, Ed
will play an important part in the next three
years of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.

The most outstanding work done by any fresh-
man Was that of Bob Dickinson, an Industrial
Engineer from Dormont. As freshman represen-
tative to E&M Cabinet, Bob has established him-
self as one of the most ambitious and reliable men
in the organization. His outstanding work on the
E&M smoker last fall prompted his appointment
as head of the E&M picnic. In this position he
was responsible for feeding and entertaining the
600 people who attended. According to E&M
President Bob Cook, this is, to the best of his
knowledge, the first time any freshman has as-
sumed a responsibility of this magnitude.

There have been many other men who have
been active to a lesser extent; One thing, how-
ever, is certain. With student activities in the
hands of men like these, Engineering and Mines
can expect a bright future.

The Torrington Needle Bearing
needs little space—saves time in assembly

 

The Torrington Needle Bearing is
a completely self-contained unit
consisting of a full complement of
small diameter rollers and a single
retaining shell. This unit design and
construction greatly simplify han-
dling and speed assembly, and help
reduce the size and weight of re-
lated parts.

High Load Capacity
in Small Space

Because the many rollers distribute
loads over a large contact surface, a
Needle Bearing has a very high load
capacity in relation to its size. In
fact, the Torrington Needle Bearing
has a higher rated radial load capac-
ity than any other type of anti-fric-
tion bearing of comparable outside
diameter. This not only permits the
use of a smaller, lighter bearing for
a given load, but also allows reduc-
tions in the size and weight of hous-
ings and other related components.
The Needle Bearing’s large inside
diameter permits larger shafts to be
used in cramped quarters, an im-
portant factor in many designs.

Installation Simpliﬁed
The installation of Torrington
Needle Bearings is fast and easy.
The housing bore is simply ma-
chined to proper diameter. The

bearing is then pressed into this
housing. An arbor press is normally
used for this operation. No spacers
or retainers are needed to keep the
bearing in place. An accurately
made shaft is required, of course, as
it serves as the inner race in most
cases and must be hardened and
ground to correct size. For applica-
tions where an unhardened shaft is
desired or necessary, inner races can
be furnished for all Needle Bearings.

These advantages make Torring-
ton Needle Bearings ideal for appli-
cations where space or weight is at
a premium, or where mass produc-
tion methods necessitate the use of
a bearing that is as easy as possible
to handle and install.
