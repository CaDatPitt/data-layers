From Silicon to $@uim<dl:
The Electronic $yhttlhesis of

by Joe Samosky

In the last issue (February, 1986), part one of this arti-
cle presented a scene common to contemporary music:
a group of performers utilizing synthesizers of various sorts
to produce a panoply of musical sounds. An overview of
sound and its production was given, and a basic analog
music synthesis system was developed. This system,
although very simple, showed in principle how such things
as keyboard xylophones and trumpeting guitars could be
created. Finally, a hint was given of a wondrous new realm
of musical creativity, digital synthesis, which would be
covered in Part Two.

Well, the wait is over! So sit back, relax, turn on some
Vangelis (the “Chariots of Fire” soundtrack would be good)
and enter the digital age.

Digital more or less implies computers, and one might
wonder why in the world musicians would be interested
in these electronic number processors. As mentioned last
time, computers are very good at controlling complicated
things very quickly. As our analog synthesizer starts
sprouting more knobs, buttons, switches and slide con-
trols than can be comfortably handled by two hands and
two feet, a computer can be applied to help manage all
this controlling. Control is the key issue here: in general,
to create sounds with more finesse requires us to be able
to control more precisely the parameters of the sound. As
any student of government knows, with more freedom
comes additional responsibility--the computer can help to
manage the responsibility of setting the values for all of
the parameters we're free to control.

That’s the philosophy — here's the practicality. A com-
puter has memory, and we can store the values of all our
synthesizer’s knobs and buttons once we’ve created just

the sound we want. Then, instead of having to manually
reset the values of attack time, decay time, filter cutoff
frequency, etc. each time we want to change sounds, we
can just call up “Voice 2” and, presto! we have a bubbl-
ing trumpet sound at our fingertips. A keyboard performer
can thus switch “instruments” in a fraction of a second,
letting the computer take care of the tedium of setting all
the control values.

Waveform Etch-a-Sketch

Digital technology allows us, as twentieth century
musical instrument engineers, to do far more than such
knob-and-switch bookkeeping. Digital techniques allow us
to carve a sound waveform as easily as a sculptor molds
clay (perhaps even more easily).

As described in the last article, sound waves can be
analyzed and described mathematically. But to create the
sound using analog circuitry was a fairly involved matter:
we needed one circuit (the Voltage Controlled Oscillator)
to generate a basic waveform such as a sine or square
wave; a second circuit (the Voltage Controlled Amplifier)
then varied the amplitude of this signal in a way specified
by yet another circuit, the Envelope Generator. Finally,
the spectrum of the signal was shaped by a Voltage Con-
trolled Filter, the cutoff frequency of which was varied by
a Function Generator.

That’s a lot of circuits, and we still can’t generate a com-
pletely general waveform.

With digital technology, we can generate a waveform
as easily as we can draw its graph. We can then store

Figure 1. “What’s this?”

this waveform, ready to recall it at any time, or we can
modify it or erase it and start over. What fun, eh?

Digital-to-Analog Conversion

A computer is basically a device that can receive, store
and manipulate numerical information. We need to be able
to translate this numerical data into a sound wave. A
speaker takes care of the electrical signa|—to-sound con-
version, hence all we need is a number-to-electrical signal
converter. This device is the Digital-to-Analog converter,
or D/A (read “Dee to ay”) for short.

Suppose someone gave you the drawing shown in
Figure 1 and said, “What’s this?” Having had a bit of
higher mathematics you’d probably respond, “A sine
wave,” and wait for your prize. Of course, Figure 1 isn’t
exactly a sine wave — it’s only a few points on the sine
curve. But your mind “connects the dots” and fills in the
empty spots. In principle, the person could have given you
a list of 12 numbers instead — the y-values of the 12 points
in Figure 1. If you were told to plot the points and the x-
spacing was specified (and was uniform) then you would
plot the points, come up with Figure 1 and discover a sine
wave once again.

Figure 3. A sine wave produced by storing 30 points
in the computer memory, then sending them one-by-
one to the D/A.

D/As do just this. They take a series of numbers,
perhaps a list stored in the microprocessor’s memory, and
convert them, at regular intervals, into signal values. In
a simple linear D/A, the output voltage or current is pro-
portional to the numbers (the digital data) put in. Figure
2 shows an example of this. Here, the voltage of the D/A
is numerically equal to the input number. The numbers
are just the y-values of the points in Figure 1. The output
of the D/A is a signal that looks something like a sine wave.
In this case, the D/A performs a conversion every 1/1200
of a second — producing a complete waveform 100 times
a second (100Hz).

The waveform of Figure 2 is reminiscent of a sine wave,
but it sure doesn't look much like one and it wouldn’t
sound like one. We can generate a “better” sine wave
by incresing the number of data points used per cycle.
This “makes the dots closer together.” If we used 30
samples per cycle, the D/A output would be as shown in
Figure 3. Finally, a filter can be used to smooth out the
rough edges, leaving an essentially perfect sine wave, as
shown in Figure 4.

We’ve been using sine waves as a simple illustration,
but the powerful generality of this system is that with it
we can create any voltage waveform we wish (within cer-
tain limits) just by specifying the data values. Such a list
of data points is "called a Iookup table, since the computer
‘‘looks up” the next value, then sends it to the D/A where
it is converted to a voltage. Another approach entails stor-
ing not the data points themselves, but an algorithm that
generates the desired function. The microprocessor then
evaluates the function at sucessive x-values, and once

again sends the data points to the D/A.

We’ve now created a system by which virtually any
equation can be transported from the abstract
mathematical realm to the world of voltage signals and
sound waves. We can now literally listen to any function
we like.

Recall the problem we encountered last time when we
tried to synthesize a piano sound? We needed to generate
lots of partials (a series of sine waves of increasing fre-
quency), and each partial had its own amplitude function.
This meant we needed a separate VCO, VCA and
envelope generator for each partial. Using a computer,
however, we could store the amplitude envelope for each
partial in memory, then read out the envelope functions
to a D/A for each VCA. Actually, we can do even better
than that. Instead of using physical components to
generate the sine waves, multiply them by the amplitude
envelopes and add them all together, why not do all this
mathematically in the computer? We can then skip all the
analog circuitry —— the VCOs, VCAs and envelope
generators. All that is needed is to compute the value of
the sound wave every forty-thousandth of a second or so
and send this value to the D/A. The D/A output is then
filtered and connected to an audio amplifier and speaker.
Using such a technique, piano sounds (or sounds of
almost any sort) can be very convincingly recreated.

The real fun, though, comes not in simply imitating a
sound, but in creating new ones. We could alter the
amplitudes of the piano’s partials so as to create a distinct-
ly “new” instrument, and all this can be done just by
reprogramming the computer. Generally, when changes
can be made in software rather than hardware, a good
deal of time, money and effort can be saved.

Of course, we need not use the waveforms produced
by natural instruments as a base from which to work. We
can think up functions of endless variety and “see how
they sound.” This creates an interesting blend of
mathematics and music — there is, for example, a
“plucked-string algorithm” that readily generates (you
guessed it) plucked-string sounds.

Analog-to-Digital, or Phil Collins’s Snare Drum on a
Chip

If numerical data can be converted to sound, can the
reverse be accomplished? Certainly. A circuit known as
an Analog-to-Digital converter (A/D) does just this. Sup-
pose we take the electrical signal from a microphone and
measure its value, say, forty thousand times a second.‘
We could record these values and plot them on a graph
— we’d get another dot-picture, this time of whatever
sound was present around the microphone during the time
we were making the measurements. Rather than do all

‘This 40,000 hertz rate was mentioned previously in connection with
the DlA operation. The reason for choosing this particular rate of sam-
pling is found in the sampling theorem. Mathematical analysis
demonstrates that in order to be able to sample a signal and then
recreate it exactly, the samples must be taken at a rate at least twice
the frequency of the highest frequency component present in the signal.

Figure 5. Block diagram of a sampling system. Sound
waves are transduced into an electrical signal by the
microphone. This signal is then sampled at a regular
rate by the A/D — at each sample time, a binary
number proportional to the signal voltage is sent to
the computer, which then stores this number and
prepares to accept the next sample value. A sequen-
tial list of signal values is thus placed in the memory.
If this list were then sent out one at a time to the D/A
of Figure 4 (at the same rate as they were sampled by
the A/D) then the original waveform would be
recreated. This waveform could be sent to an audio
amplifier and speaker, and we would hear the original
sound.

this by hand, we can run the signal into an A/D, then con-
nect the data port of the A/D to a computer. Each time
the computer tells the A/D to take a sample, the A/D
throws a number (in the form of a binary word) out of the
data port which the computer then catches and tucks
away in its memory somewhere. in a linear A/D, this
number is simply proportional to the value of the analog
signal input — it is a measure of the voltage value. This
sort of set-up is shown in Figure 5.

This means that we could ask Phil Collins to strike one
of his drums while we sampled the sound, thereby con-
verting the “snap” (or “thump” or “whap” or whatever)
into a few tens of thousands of numbers in the computer’s
memory. Now, what would happen if we then sent this list
of numbers out, one by one, to a D/A at the same rate
as they were originally sampled? We’d change the digital
data back into an analog signal, and if we fed this signal
to an amplifier and speaker we’d hear the original drum
sound.

“So,” you may be asking, “Why have we devoted
several thousand dollars worth of the most sophisticated
computer technology to give us back what we just put in?”
An excellent question indeed, if we could only do just that.
But computers have memory, and we can store that drum

Since humans can, at best, hear frequencies up to around 20,000 Hz,
a sampling rate of 40,000 Hz ensures that any audio signal we wish
to sample through our A/D will be recreated precisely when we send
the samples out to the D/A. (In practice, due to the non-ideal nature
of the circuits used, the sampling rate must be somewhat higher than
twice the highest frequency in the signal.)

sound and play it back at any time. We can play it back
in a regular pattern, thus creating a beat. (We just step
through the lookup table, pause a bit, then step through
it again.) We can store other percussive sounds — cym-
bal crashes, bass drum thumps, conga strikes — and put
them into the pattern, too. We’ve just created a drum
computer.

The sampling technique, of course, need not be limited
to drum sounds. Any instrument, any sound, can be
sampled and stored, then later played back in perfect
fidelity to the original. This technique produces even
higher quality sound than tape recording.

What’s more, a sound waveform stored in memory can
be “played back” more quickly or more slowly, simply be
sending the data to the D/A at different rates. This pro-
duces an effect similar to changing the speed on a tape
recorder — the pitch changes. With digital synthesis,
however, various data manipuation techniques can be
employed so that the duration of the sound stays the
same, even while the pitch changes. The result is that any
sound can be sampled and repitched over an entire
keyboard. Depressing a key then plays the sound back
at the appropriate pitch for that key. This then, incredibly,
allows a keyboard instrument to play virtually any sound!
One could sample, say, a sneeze, and then have five oc-
taves of sneeze-sounds available to be played. Whether
or not this would be musically pleasant is, of course,
another question.

Drainpipes and Dance Beats

The techniques of sampling and digital synthesis are
finding increasingly widespread use in modern popular
music. Peter Gabriel, for example, lists instrumental
credits of “scraped paving stone” and “blown drainpipe”
on his album Security. The song “San Jacinto” ends with
a haunting, etherial wind sound, which apparently is ac-
tually a sampled drainpipe sound. Gabriel uses the
Fairlight Computer Musical Instrument (CMI) extensive-
ly, which has the sampling capability just described.
Another widely used digital synthesizer is the Synclavier
II. An episode of “The Cosby Show” a few weeks ago
showed Stevie Wonder using this instrument to sample
sounds made by the members of the Huxtable family. He
then sequenced them into a catchy techno-pop dance
tune. The use of sampling for vocal manipulation in this
way is becoming increasingly common, since the voice
can be just as readily sampled as any other sound. One
needs only to say “Nopel” to the synthesizer, and then
by striking the keys of the keyboard the chorus of Stevie
Wonder’s “Don’t Drive Drunk” is created. Vocal sampl-
ing is also used to produce the peculiar type of rhythmic
stuttering heard on a number of recent new music
releases, such as the “S-s-s-s-superstar” lyric in the remix
of Fa|co’s “(Flock Me) Amadeus.”

Digital sampling can show up in some unexpected
places. Sampled sounds can be gleaned from a recording,
and used either alone or in combination with other sounds.
In a recent article in Rolling Stone, Stephen Levy states

17

that, “A single drum hit in 1981 can, in theory, be the basis
of a backbeat on a pop single in 1985  ”2 If you happen
to be dancing to the extended version of Bruce Springs-
teen’s “Dancing In the Dark,” listen carefully to that
powerful, full snare sound. With every strike of drummer
Max Weinberg’s stick‘, three sound sources were being
triggered, including one drum sound that was sampled
from another record. Levy also describes that during a re-
cent concert tour of a pop female vocalist, her backup
vocals were sampled and stored in and played back
through a bank of Yamaha DX7 and Roland Super Jupiter
synthesizers. She sang the lead parts live, but was ac-
companied by her own voice as played back through the
synthesizers.

it should be realized, of course, that some of the most
artful of electronic music is created by a partnership of
traditional instruments and electronic wizardry. Peter
Gabriel uses the Linn drum machine together with drum-
mers, not to their exclusion. On his album First Circle, Pat
Metheny uses the Synclavier guitar interface to
dramatically shape the sound of his electric guitar. The
end of the song “Praise” features what at first seems un-
mistakably to be a trumpet solo, until one realizes that
pitch bends are being introduced in a fashion commonly
employed by guitarists. Metheny here creates the sort of
guitar-trumpet hybrid described in part one of this article,
a hybrid made possible by the power of the computer to
rapidly mathematically alter the sound waveform of the
guitar, sculpting the harmonic structure to conform more
closely to the spectrum of the trumpet.

That’s a Wrap, Folks

lt’s been my intention to provide in this two-part series
a broad overview of electronic music technology, with
some indications of how this electronic art is being ap-
plied in contemporary popular music. For those interested
in learning more about the use of digital synthesis in rock
music, I’d recommend “Push Button Rock” by Steven
Levy, which appears in the November 21, 1985 issue of
Rolling Stone magazine (available in Hillman Library). lt’s
not just new wave bands who employ synthesis, of course,
and a look at some contemporary composers utilizing
electronic techniques in music can be found in “Break-
ing Sound Barriers” by Annalyn Swan, in the August 2,
1982 issue of Newsweek (which also, however, contains
a look at “Synth-Pop”). A more technical overview of
digital synthesis appears in “Electronically Synthesized
Music” by Eric J. Lerner, in the June 1983 issue of IEEE
Spectrum (available in the engineering library). Finally, an
excellent general work which covers everything from the
basic concepts of music synthesis to circuitry and soft-
ware for digital synthesis is Hal Chamberlin’s Musical Ap-
plications of Microprocessors (Hayden Book Co., Rochelle
Park, N.J., 1980), which is held on reserve in the music
library. Happy s-s-s-s-synthesizing!

The Great Oakland

Getaway Weekend

by Maurice Rickard

As you walk around the campus this time of year, you
may detect a certain special feeling in the air, one that
makes you feel rather happy, at peace with the world, and,
daresay I, lightheaded. You may think it's the coming of
spring, the term’s end, or male and/or female hormones
raging horribly out of control. I have recently discovered,
however, that this is not the case. This is the work of the
University’s latest project, experimental antigravity
generators.

Antigravity has been in the works for quite some time
here, perhaps since the initial threat of near-imminent total
nuclear devastation in the early fifties. That we still live
in fear of near-imminent total nuclear devastation today
serves as a testament to the foresight of the scientists and
administrators who initiated the project.

There have been a number of theories as to exactly
which manifestation of antigravity is going to be utilized
by the University; I, however, was the only person outside
of the project to have the true story explained to me in
complicated terms that only a Nobel laureate can under-
stand. It turns out that the team members’ various
girl/boyfriends received explanations that were 93.6850/o
clearer than the ones I got. I was, however, able to get
a good deal of additional information by spending time
with the janitors of the department, who, suspected, know
more about the project than anyone inside it. This is large-
ly due to the fact that the janitors have access to all of-

fices and file cabinets and are incredibly well organized
and unified, whereas the team members are much more
limited and factional.

As it turns out, the initial plan to send Oakland into
space didn’t involve antigravity; it involved the Towers as
rockets, spinning about their vertical axes to simulate
gravity. This plan was quickly dropped when it was real-
ized that the occupants would be pinned to the outside
wall as a result of the spin. Considering many of the
Towers’ current occupants, this may not be so bad, but
these people won’t be sent spinning off into space, at least
aboard any kind of vessel, anyway.

No, the current plan involves raising Oakland up by the
roots, as it were, including Schenley Park (trees, for oxy-
gen; deciduous trees will be in two groups, one budding
in the spring and one in the fall), the restaurants on
Forbes, Hospital Flow, the body of the University, and,
thank God, The Playhouse.

This admirable feat is accomplished by a rather obscure
principle, the “vermorscht Me|dzettel” principle,
discovered in the late 60’s by a group of quantum
physicists who had found that, by properly decomposing
the appropriate form (tax return, requisition form, class
registration form, Selective Service registration form, et.
al.) using a gratuitous amount of substance P (extracted
from the digestive tract of chartered accountants), one
could get the strong force and the electroweak force to

Flg. 1

distract gravity for a short time (1.037682905 x 10'9
seconds, to be exact), in which one could, theoretically,
accomplish something bloody well heretofore unlikely. In
order for antigravity to be of any use to us, this operation
must be performed at least 963,685,529.7 times a second,
for as many seconds of antigravity needed. Unfortunate-
ly, when the duration is up, gravity, seeking equilibrium
comes back with a veritable vengeance, sometimes up
to five times its normal strength. It is theorized that gravi-
ty may grow exponentially in proportion to the time it is
distracted.

I went to see Col. B.D. Hergesheimer (Ret.), chief
engineer of the project, who can be found in his office just
off the sub-basement of Benedum Hall, in the Department
of Anti-Gravity Bargaining Engineering.

“Ugnnnh, arrr  ooh  fffff  oh, uh!” he says, attempt-
ing to struggle off the floor. He and his immediate sur-
roundings appear unusually red, and his movements
seem rather sluggish. His secretary suggests I return in
a couple of days. “That’s about six months for you and
me.”

Of greater help is Dr. Anna Vyshinsky, Janitorial Parti-
cle Physicist in Residence, here on an exchange program
with the University of Havana. “You see, when proper
form, as this,” she says, indicating a stack of 1985 1040
forms in her dumpster, “is, ah, decomposed,” she sets
the dumpster on fire, “one finds that, given a [coughs]
set of conditions such that [coughs, coughs again] trees
 [coughs] substance P, or turn red, submit a  [coughs]
formal request [coughs three times] small enough for them
to understand  we run choking out of the room,
Benedum beginning the slow, painful process of burning
to the ground. Dr. Vyshinsky throws a 16.5 ml bottle of
substance P into the room. “ls to watch,” she says. The
substance P permeates the room, decomposing the forms
to the subatomic level, and gravity in the room stops work-

 

ing, its attention elsewhere. With no gravity to tell it which
way to rise, the smoke hovers, smothering the fire after
a precise $62,000 of damage. Science is a wonderful
thing.

I later go to quiz Col. Hergesheimer on this occurrence,
who informs me that “Mmmmm, ddaaaahh  grrrrrrrr, k,
k, ssssssss  unh!” Apparently, such matters are still
under investigation.

Dr. Vyshinsky tells me that by this time, the University
has installed gratuitous antigravity facilities around cam-
pus. They are easy enough to find; you just have to know
where to look.

For example, as more and more tests are run each day,
the only thing keeping Oakland from flying off into space
is a bolt penetrating deep into the substrata. This bolt (Fig.
1) is found near the top of Cardiac Hill, just past Ohara
street, at the entrance to the loading dock of Scaife Hall.
If you decide to go, you may want to bring a big
screwdriver just in case.

On Ohara itself, just a short distance from the Bolt, in
front of Western Psych, is one of the aft control panels
(Fig. 2). These are used to fine tune the flow of Substance
P, needed in the breakdown of the tax returns, transcripts,
and unprocessed registrations. There is another in front
of the Historical Society building, near the Chem building.
These are to be manned by Chinese graduate janitorial
students.

Notice, if you will, the mysterious trailer next to Allen
Hall (Fig. 3). What goes on in there, you ask. Antigravity
experiemnts. If you've been here at least two years, you
will notice that the trailer has actually moved a distance
of approximately 10.7 feet. This trailer isnot connected
to any conventional propulsion system, so it only could
have moved by antigravity. That or space aliens and Elvis’
ghost, but what they would want with what has become
affectionately known as the “Hi, Bob” trailer is thoroughly
beyond me.

Further on down Ohara, one finds the heart of the Anti-
gravity project, the LIS building. Many engineers scoff at
the Library and Information Science major, but the truth
is that all those who declare the major are indoctrinated
into the Project. Anyway, all around the LIS building, one
finds the antigravity generators themselves (Fig. 4). Notice
that these have attracted a large collection of toxic ber-
ries, well-known for giving off large concentrations of dead-
ly radon gas. Scientific theorists are working long hours
(1.5 times longer, to be exact; in the interests of what goes
under the misnomer “equal time,” the scientific theorists
only have to work 5.3 of these hours per day) to discover
exactly why this is.

The effect of gravity’s distraction is distributed all about
Oakland by special antigravity plates installed by Bell
Telephone (Fig. 5) . Be careful not to step on any of these,

especially if your weight is over 13.7 x. x values are to
go on sale at the bookstore next winter term, at an
estimated price of 3.687 y.

 

The most telling part of the scope of this project is this
sign (Fig. 6). As you can see, the NASA Industrial Applica-
tions Center is stationed in the LIS building, where the
aforementioned drives are kept. Not enough for you? How
about these: you are not allowed on the seventh floor of
the Cathedral; nor are you allowed on floors higher than
36. Why do you think this is? The steering and naviga-
tion centers are there. Why do you think the University
recently changed the phone system to one more central-
ized at the University? Do you think it’s any minor coin-
cidence that President Posvar was once involved with the
SAC? Why do you think tuition increases yearly?

Yes, as Dr. Vyshinsky puts it, “ls finally to raise status
of University, once and for all.” Or, as Col. Hergesheimer
puts it, “Mmmph, mmph, ak  ull  lndeed, where once
one could claim in the rational world that things don't just

go flying off into space, now one must realize that the
actually do. i

The Skyca per
by Kathleen McE1hinny

The Skycaper is a regular feature of Skyscraper Engineer.
Test your skill at solving this issue’s problems. Members of
the Skyscraper staff and ESC executive officers are ineligi
ble to enter the Skycaper contest. Only original entry forms
will be accepted (no photocopies please.) Complete the re-
mainder of the form and bring or mail your entry to the
Engineering Student Cabinet office located in Room 125
Benedum Hall. Be sure to have an ESC officer mark the time
and date of your entry. Forms received by mail will be timed
at 5:00 p.m. on the postmarked date. The student who sub-
mits the most correct answers will win a $25 prize. In case
of a tie, the award will be given to the person with the earliest
entry. We encourage you to submit entries even if you can-
not solve all of the problems, since it is not necessary to
answer all of the questions correctly to win. The final date
on which entries will be accepted is

(1) Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, a peck
of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked. Peter, being a shrewd
business man, decided that since he was a speedy pickled
peppers picker, he could make more money if he charged
Paul, the Pickled Pepper Producer, by the peck for his ser-
vices, instead of by the hour. As a side note, he added that
he might feel the urge to mention the “legality” of the situa-
tion to his lawyer. Paul, eager to please Peter and anxious
to keep his other cheap labor (migrant workers form Mex-
ico) did some quick calculations in his head. The migrant
workers Paul hires only demand $2.40 per hour. The prob-
lem with them, besides the language barrier, is that on the
average they can only pick 32 quarts per hour. Since Peter
can pick 40 quarts per hour, how much should Paul pay Peter
per peck so that he will be able to retain Peter and his other
workers?

(2) Two Pitt football players (who escaped Coach Gott-
fried’s weedout) had a head on collision during practice. The

height and weight of the first player are 6’0” and 250 pounds.
The height and weight of the second player are 5’10” and
290 pounds. The initial velocity of the first player is 8 meters
per second, and initial velocity of the other is 7.5 meters per
second. Both players rebound, player one with a velocity of
7 meters per second. Unfortunately the second player
sprained his toe, but fortunately for his team he finished the
play. What is his final velocity?

(3) Solve the following series:

1, 8, 81, 1024, , 279936, 
(4) A large, heavy Thomas and Finney Calculus book is
propped on a bookshelf next to a less large, less heavy
Linear Algebra and Differential Equations Book. The Linear
Algebra Book is perpendicular to the shelf. The Calculus
book is placed at a 20 degree angle from the vertical. If the
Algebra book is suddenly pulled away, at what angle will the
calculus book be at and will it remain leaning, or will it sud-
denly become parallel to the shelf?

(5) A commuting Pitt Engineering Student is traveling at 60
km/hr when she observes that the traffic light on Fifth Avenue
at the Bookstore has just turned red. She begins to
decelerate for two reasons: 1. She does not wish to run over
the unsuspecting Freshmen Engineers crossing Fifth to get
to their 8:00 Calculus classes and 2. She knows that the
light is timed to stay red for 20 seconds and she is 300 meters
from the light. If she wants to pass the light without stop-
ping, at what rate will she have to uniformly decelerate?

Congratulations to Chris Bright who correctly answered
all five questions in the last issue of Skyscraper. He then
went on to dial the phone number the sum of the answers
gave him. And then he also answered the final clue correctly.
Chris received a $25 prize for his effort.

Last lssue’s Solutions

The answers to the problems from last time are:

(1) FUN which is nothing (zero).

(2) The work is 120.4 which rounds off to 120.

(3) 175

(4) There are 5 players on a team on the court at one

time, so 5x5x2x10x10 = 5000.

(5) a=won=1
b=too=2
c=three=3
d=fore=4
e=V=5
