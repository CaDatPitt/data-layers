Memorial to Dr. Litchfield

@&»,z::.:»‘is«/»'~»’~*v'M *5 " " .- . '

Dr. Edward Litchfield

All here at the University were shocked earlier
this month at the tragic death of former Chancellor
Dr. Edward Litchfield. To quote Chancellor Wesley
Posvar. "Under his guidance. the University made
giant strides in education." During his ten years as
Chancellor. Dr. Litchfield made many changes that
have headed Pitt toward being a great University
and this strife for excellence continues. Among Dr.
LitchfieId's accomplishments are the following: he
quadrupled the physical plant value and increased
the amount of research at the University six times

. over. he greatly increased the dormitory space and

the number of students from other states and
countries.

The most readily noticeable of Dr. Litchfield's ac-
complishments at Pitt are the newly completed and
soon-to-be completed buildings on campus — Hillman
Library. Space Research. Crawford Hall. Benedum
Hall to name a few. He was truly a man of advance-
ment: the plans he had for the University are still
being carried out.

Notes

From The Dean

lniroducfion

Several things of signiﬁcance to the School of Engineer-
ing have occurred since the last issue of the SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER. All of us were saddened by the death of
former Chancellor Dr. Edward H. Litchﬁeld. Dr. Litchﬁeld
initiated the present program of development in the School
of Engineering during his last year as Chancellor. In his
honor, several of the events of the Engineers’ Week were
cancelled. At the Engineers’ Week_Seminar on Thursday,
March 14th, Mr. Laird Varzaly, President of the Engineer-
ing Student Cabinet, paid tribute to Dr. Litchﬁeld and ex—
pressed the appreciation of all Engineering students for his
interest in and support of the School. The faculty and the
administration of the School share in these sentiments.

Although some of the events of Engineers’ Week were
cancelled, others went on with only slight modiﬁcations.
The annual alumni dinner was a particularly signiﬁcant
event in_ both the number of Engineering alumni who at—
tended and in terms of the program. My report to the
Alumni summarized development during‘ the previous year.
Although this information has been presented to the stu-
dent body and faculty of the School in other forms on
other occasions, I am reproducing some of that which was
presented to the Alumni for this record.

CONTINUING ENGINEERING STUDIES

In its ﬁrst full year of operation, with the cooperation of
the academic departments, the Continuing Engineering
Studies Division conducted four seminars of several days’
duration and three special classes for industry. Over 25,000
announcements of seminars were mailed. An expanded pro-
gram of continuing engineering education courses, seminars,
and conferences will be oﬁfered next year.

ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING

An endowed professorship in honor of Pittsburgh engi-
neering pioneer, Edward R. Weidlein, will be established
at the University of Pittsburgh with funds recently contrib-
uted by Lt. General Richard K. Mellon and Mrs. Mellon.
The funds will be used to endow the Edward R. Weidlein
Professorship in Environmental Engineering and to support
research and teaching programs in this new ﬁeld. Prospec-
tive candidates are being interviewed, and it is anticipated
that the program will begin by 1968-69.

RESEARCH

Faculty activities and interest in research continues at a
high level. Currently there are 39 sponsored projects in the
School of Engineering at a total dollar value of $52,068,934.

These notes about the School of Engineering are just
a brief summary of the more signiﬁcant developments since
the 1967 Annual Alumni Dinner. The 1966-67 Annual
Report of the School of Engineering contains much more
information about the School. Copies are available to those
interested. Please call my ofﬁce.

In summary I want to call attention particularly to the
generous gift from General and Mrs. Mellon which will
permit us to begin a formal program in the ﬁeld of Environ-
mental Engineering. This is a ﬁeld of activity which is of
particular signiﬁcance to us here in the city of Pittsburgh
and one in which we in Engineering at Pitt can enjoy a
strong position. We are seeking candidates for the Edward
R. Weidlein chair in Environmental Engineering and hope
to begin this new activity next fall.

Our Fund Raising Campaign continues in high gear
and we are all hopeful, even, conﬁdent, of reaching the
stated goal by the end of this present academic year. The
Alumni Campaign is just beginning, the campaign among
the smaller industries of Pittsburgh is well under way and
the Campaign among the major corporations is proceed-
ing. As you know, all of this is under the general chair-
manship of Mr. Bob R. Dorsey, President, the Gulf Oil
Corporation, aided and abetted by Mr. Chas. Carroll Carter
and Mr. Russell M. Arnold.

We expect that this, the 1968-69 academic year, will be
another signiﬁcant year for Engineering at the University
of Pittsburgh and that we will make signiﬁcant strides for-
ward toward our stated goals.- All of us look forward to the
1969-70 academic year and, with the continuing enthusiastic
support and assistance of our student body and oL1r alumni,
we will continue to make progress.

Engineering intramurals for the winter term have so far
decided champions in basketball (which had the most par-
ticipants of all the sports this year) and swimming (which
had the least participation) and produced a good battle for
the All Sports Trophy.

With eight teams representing nine departments, more
engineers took part in basketball than any other sport this
year. The nine teams were split into two leagues with the
iltzague leaders meeting to decide the engineering cham-
pionship. The Met E’s with four starters over 6-2 and a
deep bench, breezed through League A winning all four of
lheir games, their closest contest being a 55-36 win over the
EE’_s. The Freshmen #2 were runner-up in League A with
a 2-2 record. The standings were tighter in League B. It

game (avenging an earlier 34-30 victory by the Pet E3) to
compile a 3-1 record for the League B title. The Pets and
the ME’s, each 2-2, tied for second place in League B.

The Mets remained undefeated by dumping the Civils
45-33 in the championship game, but suffered their ﬁrst loss
58-45 to the Graduate School of Business team in the semi-
ﬁnals of the All-Campus Tournament. The basketball
championship was the second title for the Met E’s, who won
volleyball last term, and this moved them into first place in
the All Sports Trophy standings.

Only two departments, the Met ES and the Chem E’s
took part in the swim meet, making it short with the poorest
participation of the year. The Mets won the first event, the
100 yard freestyle relay, but the Chem E’s won the remain-
ing six events to take the meet 35-24. Bill Tome was the
outstanding individual swimmer, winning the 25 yard but-

RESEARCH

Doctor Brody is an assistant professor of Metallurgical
Engineering here at Pitt. He received his P/z.D. from
MIT. Dr. Brody is active in the American Society of
Metals. HL teaches materials science courses and has a
speciﬁc interest in solidiﬁcation.

RESEARCH IN SOLIDIFICATION
ENGINEERING

Solidiﬁcation engineering is concerned with controlling
the structure and properties of cast materials (metals, alloys,
polymers, and ceramics) through control of the processing
parameters, such as freezing rate thermal gradients, melt
stirring, directionality, and alloying. Two areas of structure
control being investigated in the Metallurgical and Materials
Engineering Department are (a) microsegregation in the
dendritic solidiﬁcation of alloys and (b) fabrication of two
phase composities by unidirectional solidiﬁcation.

Dr. H. D. Brody

When alloys freeze, the interface between solid and
liquid is very complex. A “treelike” skeleton having many
sets of parallel branches, termed a dendrite, forms ﬁrst. As
more solid forms the branches thicken. Initially the branches
appear cylindrical; later in solidiﬁcation, as the branches
thicken, they appear “platelike”. The dendrite arms have a
deﬁnite crystallographic orientation, e.g. in steel (100) .
The composite photograph in Figure 1 shows the three—
dimensional structure of a dendrite in cast iron — 25%
nickel alloy. Generally, the spacing between dendrite arms
in the cast material is between 5 and 500 microns and the
spacing varies with the time of solidiﬁcation raised to a
power between 1/3 and 1/2.

The distribution of alloying elements in a cast material
is not homogeneous. In an alloy the ﬁrst solid to form has a
different composition than the melt. As solidiﬁcation pro-
ceeds the composition of both solid and liquid phases is
continually changing. Remixing in the liquid is rapid. Re-
mixing in the solid is often very slow. Thus the solid freezes
with a gradient in chemical composition from the ﬁrst
metal to freeze, i.e. at the center of the dendrite branches,
to the last metal to freeze, i.e. in the region between dendrite
branches. The non-uniformity in alloy concentration on the
scale of the dendrite arm spacing is termed microsegrega-
tion. Microsegregation is apparent in the Fe-25% nickel
alloy of Figure 1. After etching, the centers of the dendrite
arms, which are low in nickel content, appear light; the

15

region between dendrite arms, high in nickel content, ap-
pear dark. Microsegregation, when not controlled or cor-
rected, lowers the corrosion resistance of an alloy and
decreases the mechanical properties, such as hardness, tough-
ness, and fatigue resistance. _

Analysis of the effect of processing parameters and alloy
content on microsegregation have yielded some initial re-
sults. For example, severity of microsegregation can be
estimated from the parameter

Where D is the solid diﬂusion coefﬁcient, t is the local
solidiﬁcation time, d is the dendrite arm spacing, and k is
the ratio between the composition of the solid and the
composition of the liquid. When “a” is much less than one,
microsegregation is most severe and reaches a limiting value.

Composite materials composed of hard but brittle ﬁbers

or plates of one alloy or compound imbedded in a ductile.

but soft matrix of a second alloy are of current interest. The
composite shows promise of utilizing the good properties
of both components while overcoming the disadvantages of
each. For example, a composite could be hard and ductile.
Controlled solidiﬁcation of two phase alloys offers the pos-
sibility of fabricating composites in one step. One com-

bination we are working with is niobium—carbide ﬁbers and
plates in a matrix of the niobium terminal solid soluton.
The former being quite hard even at elevated temperatures
and the latter relatively ductile and oxidation resistant. The
goal is to solidify the material so that the ﬁbers or plates
of the carbide phase are well aligned and continuous over
distances at least one hundred times their thickness. This
is a high melting point alloy that must be melted and cast
in a non—reactive atmosphere. We are melting and casting
in vacuum employing an electron beam technique, i.e.
bombarding the solid metal with electrons until it melts.

A small zone, about one eighth to three eighth inch long,
is melted and the molten zone is progressively passed along
the sample. See Figure 2. The molten alloy is held in place
by surface tension. Freezing takes place behind the molten
zone. In cases where the temperature gradient is made very
steep, the growth rate is very slow and the diffusion bound-
ary layer at the solidifying interface can be maintained con-
stant. The plates or ﬁbers of the carbide phase will be well
aligned with the growth direction, they will be relatively
continuous, and their ends will be staggered. The results
of one of the initial tries is shown in Figure 3.

The Sky Is Not The Limit

Robert H. Goddard was a man of tremendous foresight.
This great rocket pioneer, who was better known in his days
as a physicist and schoolteacher, ﬁrst conceived an electric
propulsion system in 1906, a time when most of the world
was still‘not convinced that a noisy machine with four
wheels would ever replace the horse. Now, the ion thruster,
an electrostatic engine fashioned after Goddard’s original
design, may well be man’s magic carpet to the stars.

Ion engines are unable to generate the high thrust nec-
essary to‘ achieve earth orbit. However, once earth orbit
is achieved by a standard thermo—chemical launch vehicle,
the ion engine comes into its own.

Unlike the mammoth conventional rocket engines which
devour thousands of pounds of fuel per second, ion engines
have run for 341 days on 41 pounds of "cesium fuel.

Perhaps the best way to understand the fantastic potential
of the ion engine is to take a simulated trip to the Andro-
meda galaxy. Let us imagine ourselves perched on top a
huge Saturn V launch in an Apollo command module.
When the ignition button is pressed, 6,500,000 lbs. of thrust
hurtle us into a perfect earth parking orbit (a perfect cir-
cular orbit in which the apogee equals the perigee.) Once
earth orbit is established, we switch on our thruster.

Ion engines can produce an average of 7/100ths of
a pound of thrust. However, due to the vacuum environ-
ment of outer space, there is no frictional or induced drag,

and therefore, even low thrust increments can yield high
velocities.

As our ion engine continues to run, our space vehicle
begins to spiral outward from earth, developing a greater
apogee with each orbit. By the end of an hour, our space-
craft will have gained almost a half—mile in altitude and it
will be moving outward at .82 m.p.h. Each additional hour
it will increase its outward speed by .82 m.p.h.

At the end of a week, our spacecraft will be up 11,850
miles and moving away from earth at more than 140 m.p.h.

After ten weeks, our craft will be more than 1,000,000
miles from earth. At this point, gravitational forces from
earth will be so small that our spacecraft can break earth
orbit and begin travelling at 17,580 m.p.h. in a straight line
toward Andromeda.

Ion engines are highly advantageous for deep space
probes. Firstly, the total propulsion system (engine, pro-
pellent, and solar—electrical converters) weighs only 85
pounds. Currently, 90% of the total mass of spacecraft con-
sists of fuel and oxidizer. Thus, the ion engine would allow
a high payload-mass ratio.

Secondly, ion engines have an amazingly long speciﬁc
impulse time. With 80 pounds of fuel, an ion engine can
run continuously for two years while burning only two
ounces of fuel per day!

There is no .doubt about it. Robert H. Goddard knew
what he was saying when he declared, “The sky is not the
limit.”

Who _
are you with? Monsanto

It’s reassuring to have a good name behind you.
But a name is only a handle which describes the
quality of people working for it. Monsanto is swiftly
expanding in exciting directions. Monsanto needs
more of the same high caliber personnel it presently
employs —both graduating students and experienced
men and women. Engineers, scientists and college
graduates at all degree levels are wanted, and op-
portunity for growth is an understatement! If you
are talented; if you have big ideas; if you’d be proud
to say, “I’m from Monsanto,” we really ought to get
together. Meet the Man from Monsanto when he
Visits your campus. Or write: Monsanto Company,

Oil and Gas Production

Present day operations in the oil field.

Introduction

Consider for a moment what would happen if all oil
and gas in use across the U. S. were suddenly cut off:

' lights across the nation would go out

° airplanes would stop flying, cars would coast to a halt,

ships would bob helplessly at sea

° manufacturing across the country would stop
In short, the country would come to a virtual stand—still.
This is not likely to happen, of course, but the idea dramatizes
how vital the oil industry is to our nation’s economy. Petro-
leum supplies three—fourths of all this country — and twice
as much will be needed within forty years despite competi-
tion from coal and nuclear energy. Our exploding popula-
tion growth rate pales in comparison to the mushrooming
demands for energy. Today, however, many people are
ignorant of the methods used to ﬁnd and produce oil and
gas. Mention “oil well” and they visualize oil gushing out
over a tall derrick somewhere in the Texas panhandle. This
article will explain some of the more common methods used
today to ﬁnd and produce oil and gas.

Origin

The exact origin of oil and gas is not presently known.
The most commonly accepted theory is that the basic in-
gredients, hydrogen and carbon, came from remains of land
and sea life buried in the mud of ancient water bodies. These
small organisms, dying and settling to the bottom, were
later buried by silt, sealed from the air, and were further
protected from ordinary decay by the salty sea water. As
time went on, pressure, temperature, bacteria, and other
natural forces caused these remains to change into oil and
natural gas. This explains why these accumulations, or
reservoirs, are found exclusively in sedimentary rocks.

With only rare exceptions, oil and gas do not exist in
underground pools, as many people believe. They reside in

—- by Mark Papa

tiny pore spaces between grains of sand and in the myriad
of cavities and intercrystal voids of limestone. The best way
to visualize an underground reservoir is to imagine that a
quart of oil was poured into a bucket of sand. This is
generally how the oil exists —— within a sand body. The oil
and gas do not simply sit in place, however, for they are
subject to many underground forces. For example, under-
ground water can make the lighter hydrocarbons slowly

drift upward in a permeable strata until some barrier stops
movement. When enough hydrocarbon has moved into some‘
kind of trap a reserve awaits discovery and production.

Drilling

The only way to positively locate a hydrocarbon reservoir
is to drill into it. In the past permanent steel or wooden der-
ricks were erected and used as the basis for drilling opera-
tions. These derricks, the symbol of the industry, are still
common sights in many areas around Pittsburgh. Today,
however, 85% of the domestic drilling is done by portable
rotary rigs. The rotary drilling operation is deceptively sim-
ple. The hole (usually between 51/2 and 15 inches in dia-
meter) is drilled by rotating a bit suspended from the der-
rick by sections of drill pipe. The rotational power is
supplied at the surface by conventional gas or electric engines
and is transmitted to the bit by the hollow sections of drill
pipe. Specially mixed drilling “mud,” a complex mixture
of oil, water, and chemical additives, is pumped down the

drill pipe, through the drill bit, and back to the surface

through the annulus, the space between the drill pipe and
hole wall. The mud removes rock cuttings from the hole,
controls formation pressures as drilling progresses, cools and
lubricates the bit, and seals the hole wall to prevent mud
loss into permeable formations. The driller feeds the drill
pipe into the hole and adds new sections of pipe as he pene-
trates deeper into the earth. Although the drilling opera-
tion seems very basic it is a very hazardous economic gam-
ble, for only one well in nine strikes a significant amount
of oil or gas.

Compleﬁng The Well

When the drill bit strikes a productive hydrocarbon
accumulation the well must be completed so that the oil and
gas can be efficiently brought to the surface. «To prevent
caving, the entire hole will be lined with high quality pipe,
called casing, which is cemented against the hole wall.
Often, however, the oil will not be able to flow to the sur-
face through the large diameter casing. For this reason a
string of smaller diameter pipe, the tubing, is also placed in
most wells. The next step is to create a channel through

33

which the ﬂuid can ﬂow into the well bore. To create an.

opening between the well and the productive formation
either a bullet perforating gun or jet-type charges are
lowered to the desired depths and ﬁred electrically. Bullet
perforators ﬁre conventional projectiles into the casing and
formation, while jet perforators, similar to a scaled down
bazooka, ﬁre shaped charges whose high temperature, high
velocity gases can penetrate up to a foot or more through the
casing into cement and formations. If the hydrocarbaron
reservoir is in a limestone bed the well may be acidized ——
dilute hydrochloric acid is pumped down the tubing to
dissolve the limestone formation, creating less opposition to
ﬂow. Another method of stimulating production is hydrau-
lic fracturing. A viscous ﬂuid is pumped down the well
bore at a high pressure, causing the formation to fracture
along either a horizontal or vertical plane. A fluid contain-
ing a propping agent, such as sand or glass heads, is then
pumped into this fracture to assure that it will not close
completely when the fracturing pressure is removed. These
artiﬁcial fractures, about one—eighth inch wide and 150 feet
long, provide eﬂicient ﬂow channels from the formation to
the well bore.

Many wells ﬂow naturally when ﬁrst completed. In
these, the formation pressure overcomes the opposing forces
— ﬂuid column weight in the well, tubing ﬂow friction,
and formation ﬂow resistance. In most wells the formation
pressure will be depleted before all the recoverable oil is
produced, necessitating initiation of some type of artiﬁcial
lift. The most common type of artiﬁcial lift is the sucker
rod pump. This is a reciprocating pump installed down the
tubing and actuated by small diameter alloy—steel sucker
rods extending to the surface. This up—down motion is
usually imparted by an engine driven “teeter-totter” pump-
ing unit. Gas lift is another common type of artiﬁcial lift
High pressure gas is injected into the space between the
casing and tubing, entering the tubing through a gas lift
valve. The fluid that is standing in the tubing-above the
gas inlet port is displaced, lightened by mixing with the
gas, and is raised to the surface by the expanding gas. If
the well is able to maintain a column of fluid above the
point of injected gas, the well is said to be under continuous
ﬂow gas lift. If considerable time is needed for fluid to
build up in the tubing, gas is injected into the well in
batches which bring the fluid to the surface in slugs. This
type of production is known as the intermittent type gas
lift. Other types of artiﬁcial lift are available, depending
upon the depth of the well, the type of ﬂuid to be produced,
and the relative costs of each method.

When the well ﬂuid reaches the surface it is separated
into its components —— usually oil, gas, and water. The oil
is sent to a reﬁnery, while the gas is delivered to a gasoline
plant where the liquiﬁable hydrocarbons are stripped off.
The dry gas can then be sold or reinjected, as in gas lift
operations. The produced water may be reinjected back into
the formation through injection wells. This water spreads
out from the injection wells, driving reservoir oil ahead of it
toward the producing wells. This method, called water-
ﬂooding, can double the amount of oil recovered from a
reservoir. Generally, recoveries from reservoirs under natural

'34

drives will range from 10% to 50"/0 of the total oil in place,
depending on the drive mechanism. Higher recoveries will
result from reservoirs surrounded by large encroaching
aquifers, while reservoirs whose only energy is the solution
gas dissolved within the oil will have lower recoveries. Often
ﬂuids will be reinjected into the reservoir to produce second-
ary oil that is unrecoverable from natural drives. The most
common types of secondary recovery are waterﬂooding, de-
scribed above, miscible ﬂooding, gas injection, and steam
injection. Miscible ﬂooding is simlar to waterﬂoodng ex-
cept that it miscible polymer is placed at the oil—water
interface to reduce channeling of the water from the injec-
tion to the producing wells. Gas injection, also, can increase
oil recovery. At the reservoir pressure declines the injected
gas will expand, driving oil toward the producing wells. In
areas where the oil is extremely viscous steamﬂooding may
be used to boost production. Steam is injected into the for-
mation and heat is imparted to the oil through the rock
matrix, decreasing oil viscosity and enabling the oil to ﬂow
more freely toward the well bore.

Conclusion

The basics of oilﬁeld development and operation are

quite simple. Wells penetrate productive formations, pipe
is set from the surface to the oil zone, artiﬁcial ﬂow chan-
nels are created in the formation, and the well ﬂuids flow,
or are pumped, to the surface where they are separated and
sent to reﬁneries and gasoline plants. There are no gushers
in the modern oilﬁeld — only carefully controlled wells de-
signed to efficiently deliver the maximum amount of oil and
gas possible from a hydrocarbon reservoir.

“For example, one of my installations is at a cancer research
institute. A problem came up when they decided to build a
radio therapy suite about a block away from the computer.
The doctors wanted to communicate with the computer right
from a patient's bedside.

“The general solution was easy enough. We knew we’d have to
use some sort of remote terminal. But from then on it was a
process of exploration. I asked a lot of questions, dug up a lot
of facts, and generally helped the customer arrive at a detailed
deﬁnition of his problem. Then I worked closely with
IBM and the customer until we had the right ter-
minals installed and functioning.

Photochromatic Glass

Glass that changes from light to dark and back again

lniroduci-ion

One of the basic materials in modern day engineering is
glass. By making modiﬁcations in the basic structure of
glass, in its shape, or in its manufacturing process, a re-
markable variety of properties can be obtained. In 1963 at
the Corning Glass Works in Corning, New York, a most
fascinating type of new glass was developed. It is of a
special composition enabling it to darken when exposed to
light and clear when the light source is removed. Photo—
chromatic glass is not to be confused with photosensitive
glass which was first made in the late l940’s. Photosensitive
glass is essentially the same as film in that once exposed to
light its shading is irreversibly changed. Photochromatic
glass has been developed which is permanently reversible
regardless of how many times it is exposed. This is quite a
peculiar trait for glass which is well known for its physical,

chemical and dimensional stability.

Darkening Condifions

The rate of darkening and degree of darkness are de-
pendent on exactly how the glass was made and processed,
what type of light it is exposed to and the temperature
during exposure. Darkening takes place when the glass is
exposed to long—wave near ultraviolet light and reverses
when the light is shut oﬁ’. Prescription ground sun glasses
have been made of photochromatic glass that darken in
bright sunlight but under normal inside lighting remain
perfectly clear. However, by using different sensitizing
agents the wave length at which the change occurs can be
made to vary. Consequently it is possible to change the
shade of photochromatic glass with visible light or even
heat. The color of the darkened glass is usually a shade of
gray, occasionally with a purple or brownish tint.

The response time of these glasses varies with composi-
tion and ranges in value from a fraction of a second to days.
An increase in tempearture will increase the rate at which
the glass darkens. The optical transmittance of a 1/," plate
of photochromatic glass has been reduced as much as 99%.

Mechanism of 'lhe Change

The mechanism of the change in color involves the dis-
sociation of silver halide crystals which are approximately
50 Angstroms in diameter and 500 Angstroms from each
other. These crystals, due to their small size, do not affect
the color of the glass until they are exposed to the ultra—
violet light. The crystals are introduced into the glass
during the cooling and reheating of the glass in the manu-
facture process. The dissociation of the halide crystals can
occur over and over again with no apparent effect on the
glass or the crystals. In the laboratory, photochromatic glass
has been exposed thousands upon thousands of times with
no fatigue or deterioration.

Uses of Phoiochromaﬁc Glass
Some of the more obvious uses of photochromatic glass
would be in sun glasses and windows where,_it is desirable
to reduce the amount of light admitted according to the
amount of sunlight at a given time. Since images can be
traced on glass with ultraviolet rays and erased with visible

rays, this glass can serve as a type of memory device. Also‘

possible are such things as self-erasing display devices and
light valves in optical systems.

The silver particles are active
in only part of the glass. The upper
pearl‘ of 'l-his glass lets 30 per cent
of the visible light while the lower
half allows 86 per cent light trans-
mission.

If you want a career with the only
big computer company that makes
retail data systems complete

from sales registers to computers,
where would you go?

Guess again.

It's NCR, and this is not the only surprise you may get if
you take a closer look at NCR.

We're a company alive with new ideas, research, de-
velopment. A year never passes without NCR increasing its
investment in research. We have hundreds of engineers,
chemists, and physicists exploring their own ideas for the
company that's willing to wait and let them do it.

Take a closer look and you'll see that NCR makes com-
puters, electronic accounting systems, highly sophisticated
solid-state communications systems for space and defense
applications, and you'll see that even our good old cash reg-
isters have become advanced information machines for
businessmen.

In a list of “emerging ideas of 1966," Business Manage-
ment magazine credits NCR with two out of seven: pioneer-
ing in laser technology for recording data, _and development

Transportation Research in Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh has been planning mass transit systems since 1917,

but the city still lacks an efficient transportation system.

Cobblestones and streetcar tracks plague the mass transit
manufacturing center of the world. Goat paths called streets
wind around the hills. Buses average 5 miles per hour
during rush hour between downtown and Oakland. The
Penn-Lincoln Parkway, 1.7% of the total arterial system
mileage, provides 85% of its travel. The inadequate trans-
portation system in Pittsburgh motivates research for im-
provement.

Good planning takes time. Engineers study not only
technical, but also social and economic questions.

1. Planners estimate future employment, the control of fam-
ily incomes and demands for services.

2. Population trends control vehicle registration.

3. Land-use studies show distribution of growth and
employment. New houses need more schools, parks, and
shopping districts. Land used for service industries de-
pends on the employment increase in those industries.
Land—use studies recognize established neighborhoods, a
main concern with the North Side freeway, and historical
landmarks.

4. People travel in patterns. Mathematical models based on
such things as how many times the wife goes shopping
in a week, predict future trips. A computer assigns travel
to the routes most likely taken, and shows future over-
loads to the present system.

5. Personal interviews gather data. People answer home,
roadside, and truck—taxi questionnaires.

6. New proposals are made comprehensive. They must
consider renewal and redevelopment, housing projects,
industrial districts and parks. The planner must work
with what has already been done while other engineers
often start with a clean slate.

7. Benefit—cost analysis chooses which systems proposed are
best and built first. i
As other cities, Pittsburgh boasts many transit plans. A

master plan in 1917 called for a 37.5 mile subway and

elevated system. Taxpayers voted for a 356 million issue in

1919 for downtown subway construction that never started.

A 1926 study proposed “immediate construction” of a 6.1
mile subway. In 1958, the State Department of Highways,
the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and the U.S.
Bureau of Public Roads joined forces for the Pittsburgh Area
Transportation Study (PATS). Its objective was an “inte-
grated plan of major highway and mass transportation sys-
tems for the year 1980, designed to serve the projected land
uses . . . of the area.” It followed the seven steps outlined
above to propose a 16 mile, $94 million rapid transit from
the East End through downtown to the South Hills. It
augmented an extensive highway plan.

PATS ﬁndings include:

Six out of ten people make trips daily.

They spend one hour a day making 2.8 trips.

4/5 are auto drivers or passengers; 1/5 transit.

85% of the bus riders do not drive cars.

Only 4% of owners of cars use transit, and the number

of licensed drivers goes up.

6. Public transit specializes trips. 1/3 go to the golden
triangle, 1/3 to school, and 1/3 to jobs outside the
triangle. _

7. 4.9 million seat miles were offered, 1.9 million were used

in 1958.

P‘.-"P°!\’f“

8. The arterial system in 1958 operated slightly under its
design capacity (8.6 million vehicle miles), yet 372 miles
of arterial streets operated over design capacity.

Since then, Pittsburgh turned down a computer subsidy
program, and the Pennsylvania Railroad dropped its trains.
The Port Authority of Allegheny County examined a one
year commuter demonstration project to Trafford using the
Pennsey tracks. After station and parking improvements,
and buying self propelled rail diesel cars, a 50c trip would
cost PAT at least $51.00, even if the trains ran with standing
room only. Today, the P&LE runs a train a day to Beaver
Falls and back, and the B&O makes seven round trips to
McKeesport and Versailles with rail diesel cars.

Within the last year, three groups ﬁnished cost estimates
for a regional rapid transit system. Transportation Research
Institute of Carnegie—Mellon University compiled Westing-
house rubber wheeled “skybus” technology, configuration,
and costs for a regional system and a downtown loop sys-
tem. Parsons, Bricknerholf, Quade, and Douglass compared
conventional steel wheel rapid technology to the skybus for
a sixty mile regional system and alternate station plans down-
town. PBQ&D designed the $1 billion BART now being
built in San Francisco.

The advantages of the Skybus system are:

Great ﬂexibility in adapting to variable conditions of
topography and environment. (Notice 8% grade in proﬁle.)

Smaller light—weight vehicles which permit correspond—
ingly lighter weight aerial structures.

Relatively small noise level in operation.

As a result of the preceding characteristics, an opportunity
with careful design and judicious location to make much
greater use of aerial construction than with conventional
steel rail systems.

Substantial economies made possible by aerial line con-
struction vs. underground for conventional steel rail and
consequential substantial savings in station costs.

Skybus technology would save 20% in construction costs
over a steel wheel system. Richardson, Gordon, and Asso-
ciates drew detailed plans for the South Hills line. Planning

Any future plans must overcome many social, economic,
and political obstacles, as well as technical. After two more
years of gathering data of land use, industrial growth, and
population to update the 1958 PATAS report, regional sys-
tem plans will be presented to the people. They may not
want it. The North Side Freeway linking into the “Bridge
to Nowhere” is costing $23 million a mile. Influential men
oppose the Clark Freeway in Cleveland that will cut through
80 large houses in Shaker Heights and ﬁll its park lakes.
Central planning commissions must face 129 municipalities
and their local vetos. Greentree ofﬁcials banned parking on
the west side of Greentree Road to Western Avenue be—
tween 4:30 and 6:00. Council planner Little said that it

To The Moon Softly

by R. J. Vargar

Absfraci
The Surveyor Spacecraft VII ﬂight of January 9, 1968,

marked the ﬁnale in an almost monotonous string of accom-

plishments compiled by the U. S. Surveyor Spacecraft pro- ‘

gram, which successfully soft—landed ﬁve ‘of seven space-
craft sent moonward. This average is perhaps the greatest
technological feat in the ﬁrst decade of the space age. Rus-
sian space scientists have parachuted an instrument package
onto Venus, but hav_e yet to develop the approach radar
and _rocketry system that can set an unmanned spacecraft
down on the airless moon more gently than a helicopter
touches down on a landing strip. From Surveyor’s success
has come man’s ﬁrst detailed knowledge of the consistency
and chemical makeup of lunar soil, data and pictures that
will inﬂuence the choice of the ﬁrst astronaut landing site,

"and conﬁrmation that the soft-landing system of the Apollo

Lunar Module — similar. to Surveyor — is well conceived
and workable. Presented here is a brief discussion of the
signiﬁcant engineering features of the Surveyor operation,
a brief review of the ﬁnal mission operation and some of
the results obtained from the various missions.

To The Moon Soﬂ-Iy

The ﬁrst major U. S. scientiﬁc achievement in the year
1968—the soft landing of the Surveyor Spacecraft VII near
the crater Tycho—was also the feat that marked the end of
the Surveyor Program.

The Surveyor, designed and built for the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory of NASA, was to obtain lunar information
needed for the ﬁrst manned lunar landing. Some of the
technological advances made by Surveyor are to be incor-
porated in the Lunar Module of the Apollo Program. The
Surveyor mission, as well as that of the Apollo Lunar
Module, is highly complex for it entails not only the normal
diﬂiculties of a successful launch and midcourse trajectory
adjustments, but also the relatively new science of controlled
soft landing.

Spacecraﬂ Operaﬁon

The launch, transit and landing sequence of Surveyor
entails a long series of delicate operations spanning a period
of about 65 hours. After separation from the second stage
Centaur, Surveyor is on its own, free of its protective. shroud
and with its antennas and legs extended. During the ﬂight

it locks on to the sun and the star Canopus for reference,
breaks lock to perform a midcourse correction maneuver,
then reacquires the sun and Canopus for the remainder of
its transit phase. The landing sequence is, in effect a launch
in reverse carried out under automatic ﬂight control 247,000
miles from earth.

The spacecraft approaches the moon at approximately
5,900 miles per hour. When it is about 52 miles away, the
main retro rocket and Vernier engines are ignited by a
signal from the altitude marking radar. ‘The spacecraft is
slowed to about 400 mph at 37,000 feet, and the main retro
engine is jettisoned. The vernier engines continue to burn
until Surveyor is about 14 feet above the lunar surface and
has slowed to 5 feet per second. At that point the Vernier
engines cut off and the spacecraft free falls to the surface.
(See Figure 1).

With ﬁve successful landings on the moon, the Surveyor
has accomplished numerous ﬁrsts and much has been
written of these unprecedented feats. However, the engi-
neering story behind Surveyor is equally impressive and also
deserves some attention.

The relatively small spacecraft which weighs approxi-
mately 2200 pounds with a 1500 pound retro rocket engine
is made up of more than 90,000 parts which had to function
flawlessly and respond precisely to instantaneous command.
There are over 30,000 electronic parts alone which had to
operate in sequences of microseconds.

In addition to the myriad of components of varying
sizes, there are numerous basic subsystems which had to per-
form during speeds up to 23,000 mph over a quarter-million
miles.

Significanl Engineering Design Feafures

The basic soundness of the system design concepts de-
veloped early in this decade must be cited as the principle
contributor to the success of the program.

A commandable-type spacecraft which responds to ground
commands rather than to an on—board spacecraft pre-pro-
grammed computing system has been proven. This feature
could never have been accomplished without an R. F. sys-
tem performing flawlessly for the command and communi-
cation links. During the transit period, more than 5000
commands were sent and successfully executed by the space-
craft. In excess of another 75,000 commands were sent dur-
ing the lunar day (14 earth days).

This feature also provided flexibility by using the ground
intelligence to correct problems. For example, it was pos-
sible to re—program the terminal descent, which saved the
Surveyor V mission. The ﬁrst lunar repair was performed
on Surveyor VII using a non-standard procedure when the
Surface Sampler maneuvered the Alpha-Scattering Instru-

_ ment to the surface when it failed to deploy.

The completely automatic terminal descend was another
key feature. The closed loop functioning of the radars, flight
control system, and propulsion was proven out on the earth
with the T—2 vehicle test series at the Air force Missile De-
velopment Center at Alamagordo, New Mexico, where the
test vehicles were dropped from balloons from an altitude
of 1500 feet and on the moon as represented by ﬁve success-
ful lunar touchdowns. These features have directed applica-
tions to other type spacecraft, such as those going to the
nearby planets, Mars and Venus.

The combination of a retro-rocket engine and the throttle-
able vernier engines for propulsion has also been proven out.
On ﬁve successful ﬂights the command usage of the vernier
engines to execute pinpoint midcourse corrections, provide
stabilization during retro ﬁring, and to continuously throttle
the rate of descent until ﬁnal Hare—out, has been amply
demonstrated.

The spacecraft demonstrated the ability to perform these
many complex functions at minimum weight. For example,
the basic spaceframe structure weight is only 65 pounds,
which is remarkable when one considers that the Surveyor
at the time of touchdown is just under 700 pounds after ex-
pelling the retro—rocket. Minimum weight was also accom-
plished by Hughes’ techniques of electronic packaging and
by small gage harness wires and connectors.

Another feature is the temperature control for the space-
craft. A minimum of.active electrical heating was required.
Instead, super insulation, thermal switches, and unique paint
patterns were used. Temperature control through the rigors

of space and lunar environment was .provided by the more
reliable passive methods.

A keystone of mission success was highlighted by long
and exhausting environmental system tests. These tests
simulated conditions of launch, transit and lunar operation.
The spacecraft was, in a sense, burned in and thus qualiﬁed
for its ﬂight mission.

Every Surveyor Spacecraft carrying something new has
been a success on the ﬁrst attempt. No. 1 itself was new and
carried the ﬁrst TV camera to send back pictures from the
moon’s surface. No. III had a camera and a Soil Mechanics

Surface Sampler. No. V carried a camera and the Alpha‘

Scattering Instrument to analyze the soil composition.
No. VI was identical to V, while No. VII carried all devices.
Final Mission Operalion

The ﬁrst six Surveyor missions were restricted to areas
of the Apollo landing sites for engineering investigations.
The last of the -flights, Surveyor VII, was put in the hands
of the scientists and hence one of the worst possible landing
sites was selected near the relatively new crater, Tycho. The
Tycho site was to permit examination of the ejecta or throw-
out material which was excavated from beneath the for-

to duplicate the movements of sprinting. The head stays level.
It's never higher over the hurdle than it is between them.”

A level head helps overcome any obstacle. Take bearing problems.

mer surface of the highlands, when the crater Tycho was
first formed. The Tycho ejecta blanket was particularly at-
tractive for several reasons: 1) Tycho is the youngest large
crater and its throw—out should, therefore, be less ‘con-
taminated by ejecta from other parts of the moon and by
metoritic material; and 2) it is an outstanding anomaly in
radar and infrared reflection. The features which made the
ejecta blanket important, however, also made it a risky
landing site. The terrain is very rugged. The most de-
sirable landing site lies within a relatively small target area
north of the Tycho crater. Closer to the crater the terrain
becomes virtually impossible as a landing site.

On January 9, 1968, Surveyor VII touched down at 8:05
EST within I1/2 miles of the predicted target north of Tycho
in the south polar region. Figure 2 is a photograph taken
by the Lunar Orbiter V of this region using a high resolu-
tion camera. Superimposed upon the photo is the Surveyor
VII landing site and also key points which are to be com-
pared with Figue 3, which was taken from Surveyor VII.

spacecraft. The small rocky crater in the near ﬁeld is about
5 feet in diameter and is 18 feet from Surveyor’s camera.
The crater is ﬁlled with rocks torn from the surface by
impact of a large block of lunar material ejected by a still
larger impact somewhere to the right of the area pictured
and out of range of the camera. The rock on the near rim
is 2 feet across and casts a 4 foot shadow to its left. Sur-
veyor VII is sitting on a gentle slop (about three degrees)
and in this mosaic, the camera is looking downhill. The
distance from Surveyor to the horizon varies from hill to hill,
but the center of the horizon is about 8 miles away. The
horizon is made of a series of ridges and hills somewhat
alike in form to many rounded hills found in Pennsylvania.
The undulating surface is a characteristic feature on the
flanks of the rims of most very large lunar craters and
probably is made up of great piles of ejected debris. Just
below the horizon at point 5 are small ravines and gullies
probably formed during the How of debris at some time
shortly after it was deposited.

Toward the upper right of the picture at point 8 is a
rock which appears small in the mosaic but is 20 feet across
and lies nearly 1200 feet from the spacecraft. At point B is
a 200 foot crater some 2100 feet from Surveyor "VII. Close
inspection of this crater reveals two smaller craters Within
it, each about 18 to 20 feet in diameter.

In addition to the pictures obtained from the TV
camera other experiments were performed on No. VII with
the Soil Mechanics Surface Sampler and the Alpha—Scatter-
ing Instrument. The Surface Sampler furrowed a 12 inch
long trench in the moon’s surface at midnight, 12 January,
1968. This was the first digging operation conducted on the
moon since Surveyor III dug four trenches in April, 1967.
A diﬂiculty, however, was discovered in the nylon cord
suspension system that would not permit the Alpha—Scatter-
ing Instrument to deploy to the lunar surface. With the
help of the Surface Sampler, the Alpha—Scattering Instru-
ment head was pushed and pulled and successfully deployed
to the lunar surface and thereby Surveyor VII became the
first spacecraft ever to correct its own mechanical problem.

The Surface Sampler has picked up and examined smaller
rocks and has made bearing strength tests. The lunar ter-
rain near Tycho appears to be richer in coarse rocks and
rocky fragments than seen at any of the previous Surveyor
landing sites.

The Alpha—Scattering Instrument accumulated a total of
64 hours of operating time while gathering valuable data.

Because of extreme temperature conditions during the
lunar day, the ASI could only be operated when the auxil-
iary electronics were within an acceptable temperature
range. Three different lunar samples (locations) were ex-
amined in addition to a sample taken with the ASI in the
stowed position before it was lowered to the lunar surface.

With the turn 085 of the TV camera on January 23, 1968,
all spacecraft science operations were halted for the first
lunar day. Prior to being shutdown, the TV camera re-
turned approximately 21,046 pictures, with about 800 of these
being taken after sunset.

Another interesting experiment involving No. VII was
that of photographing laser beams transmitted to the moon.

tory in Southern California’s San Gabriel mountains was
photographed by the TV camera and returned to earth.
This was a keen display of aiming accuracy over a range
of about 240,000 miles.

A similar accomplishment was achieved by other scientists
at Kitt Peak in Arizona also using the argon laser invented
by the Hughes Research Laboratories at Malibu.

There were two critical experimental requirements in
performing this test. First it was necessary to collimate the
laser beam sufficiently so that it would pass through the
earth’s atmosphere with enough photon flux to register on
the Surveyor’s camera set for a 2 second time exposure.
Secondly, the observer would have to be able to point the
beam accurately enough to locate Surveyor VII on the moon.

The 2 watt argon laser which was taken from the
Hughes Research Laboratory to the ]PL observatory atop
Table Mountain near Wrightwood, California was aﬂixed
to a 24 inch telescope employing a Coude focus. The set—up
was such that the laser beam passed through a beam splitter
which had a hole in it. Light coming back from the moon

hit the beam splitter and deflected off at a right angle to the
telescope, making it possible for the observer to visually
locate the area on the moon in which Surveyor rested; the
laser beam was transmitted simultaneously through the
same optics. The beam was aligned with the telescope by
focusing on a warning hut at the head of a ski run atop
another mountain about a mile away.

The laser spot size on the hut was about 3 inches.
Polarization of the beam was checked by closing the dome
of the observatory and then observing the polarization from
light scattered off the dome. It should be explained that the
laser technique could have been used to analyze the earth's
atmospheric fluctuation and to conduct simple communica-
tions experiments if there had been faster detectors on the
moon.

Figure 4 is the picture photographed by the TV camera
of the laser experiment. The beams are so highly con-
centrated that they appeared brigher to the TV camera than
Sirius, the brightest star in the sky.

After sunset of the lunar day additional pictures were
taken of the solar corona, of earth shine on the moon and
of the planet Mercury. Mirrors were attacheed to the mast
and various parts of the spacecraft to give greater visability.
Stereoscopic observations could be made of the moonscape
as well as of the Surface Sampler and Alpha—Scattering
Instrument.

Although not designed to survive the lunar night, Sur-
veyor VII was awakened on February 11, 1968, and pro-
ceeded to prepare itself for further experimentation. The
spacecraft suffered damage to its batteries after being ex-
posed to —250°F temperatures during the lunar night and
hence was operating with a weak signal. The camera viewed
a new lunar area when it became tilted about 8 degrees
following a leak which occurred in one of the shock
absorbers. Reports from Mission Control have indicated
that considerable alpha scattering data was accumulated and
that 44 photographs in the 200 line emergency mode were
received using power from the solar panel. Little hope was
given for further operation of the spacecraft.

Lunar Exploraﬁon Resulfs

The data obtained from Surveyor I, III and V provided
much information which has been reviewed, evaluated and
analyzed. Just a small portion of the results is presented
here.

Fundamentally, it has been learned that the lunar sur-
face is benign in terms of executing manned landings, pro-
viding that the proper lunar location is selected.

The gray lunar soil is dry and granular, but has the
cohesiveness of wet sand. By measuring the current drain
by the four electric motors actuating the Soil Mechanics
Surface Sampler during application of various forces, it has
been determined that the lunar surface has a bearing
strength of about six pounds per square inch. This is
similar to some sandy and sun-baked parts of earth, and
is adequate to support Apollo Astronauts. Calculations do
indicate that the astronauts will sink about one to two inches
while walking. However, this slight give will aid in
cushioning a landing vehicle.

A clearer-picture of the sub—surface structure of the lunar
surface debris layer, or regolith, has emerged from the
study of the Surveyor V television pictures of the area fur-
rowed by the Surface Sampler. At depths below about
10 cm, the regolith is probably composed mainly of shock-
compressed aggregates ranging from a few millimeters to

52

3 cm in diameter, set in a matrix of less coherent, finer
particles. Rocky chips and fragments larger than a milli-
meter are dispersed as a subordinate constituent of the
debris. Most fragments larger than 3 cm, however, are
rocky material. Both the fragmentation and aggregation of
the material in the debris are probably the direct result of
prolonged meterorite bombardment of the lunar surface.

It is important to recognize the complicated history of
the lunar surface debris in evaluating the chemical analysis
provided by the Alpha Scattering Instrument on Surveyor V
which landed in a small crater. The instrument was lowered
from the spacecraft and came to rest on loose debris that
had been kicked out on the wall of the Surveyor V crater
during landing. This debris is composed mostly of-=aggre—
gates of fine particles; the particles of which the aggregates
are composed probably have been derived from a wide
region on the lunar surface and transported ballistically to
the site of the Surveyor V crater. The analysis does not,
therefore, represent a single rock, but a mixture of rock
particles, possibly of diverse origin. Most particles prob-
ably have not been transported more than a few kilometers,
however, so that the analysis represents, for the most part,
a mixture of rock particles derived from the small area on
the Sea of Tranquility.

The Alpha—Scattering method of chemical analysis relies

on the bombardment of the lunar surface with alpha par-
ticles from six radiation sources of Curium 242. This tech-
nique is especially suitable for instrumented space missions
because of characteristics such as compactness and relative
simplicity of operation. It involves the measurement of the
energy spectra of alpha particles scattered backward from
the atomic nuclei of a sample and of protons obtained from
the nuclear reactions of alpha particles with some of the
lighter elements. These spectra contain quantitative infor-
mation on all major elements in the sample except hydrogen,
helium, and lithiL1m. The method can readily distinguish
among the lighter elements but the atomic weight of heavier
constituents can be identified only approximately.

Table I lists the results obtained on the chemical com-
positions of the lunar surface. The table lists the atomic
percent of all atoms (heavier than lithium) represented by
the elements in question. From this analysis it is seen that
the most abundant element on the lunar surface as on the
earth is oxygen. More than half of all the atoms are of
this element. Second in importance, again as on the earth's
crust, is silicon. Next in abundance is aluminum and the
quantity is somewhat lower. At this stage, only upper limits
can be placed on the amounts of carbon and sodium pre-
sent. The data indicates surprisingly large amounts of ele-
ments heavier than silicon, 13 + 3%. Although a detailed
breakdown of these elements cannot be made at present, it
is possible to place a lower bound of 3% on the combined
abundance of iron, cobalt and nickel, and an upper bound
of 0.50% on that of still heavier elements.

Although use of the mean values of Table I would in-
dicate a slight deficiency of oxygen needed to oxidize all the
metals, the estimated error ranges at present would include
values not requiring any free iron. The overall analysis
indicates that the lunar surface at the Surveyor V landing
site is a silicate rock formation similar in composition to
materials available on earth.

The cumulative size—frequency distribution of fragments
on the undisturbed surface near Surveyor V normalized to
an area of 100 mg for each of the sample areas, may be com-
pared with the average size-frequency distribution of frag-
mental debris on undisturbed parts of the lunar surface at
the Surveyor I and III landing sites (Figure 5). The size-
frequency distribution of the fragmental material on the
undisturbed walls of the Surveyor V crater is similar to
that observed at the Surveyor I and III sites. Most’ of the
size-frequency distribution curves for the debris on the wall
of the Surveyor V crater have a slightly steeper slope, how-
ever, than the curves obtained for fragmental debris at the
Surveyor I and Surveyor III sites. Thus, there are fewer
fragments larger than 6 cm per unit area around the Sur-
veyor V crater. This paucity of coarse fragments may be
the result of two related factors: (1) a greater thickness of
the fragmental debris layer at the Surveyor V landing com-
pared to the Surveyor I and III landing sites and; (2) a
greater distance from Surveyor V to the nearest raised-rim
crater with associated strewn ﬁelds of coarse blocks.

A comparison of the cumulative size—frequency distribu-
tion of small craters measured from the Surveyor V is pic-
tured with size—frequency distribution of craters determined
for the Surveyor I and Surveyor III sites (Figure 6) shows

fewer small craters at the Surveyor V site. This observation
difference is due primarily to the incompleteness of the
observational data for the Surveyor V site. The low oblique
view (from the television camera) of the lunar surface out-
side the Surveyor V crater and unfavorable illumination of
parts of the Surveyor V crater during the lunar day made
recognition of the small craters difﬁcult. The cumulative
frequency of craters in the 4 to 256 meter diameter range,
determined from the Lunar Orbiter V photograph is some-
what below the average for the lunar plains. This observed
low frequency near the Surveyor V site is due, in part, to
incompleteness of the data near the 4 meter end of the
diameter range measured; but the number of craters from
about 50 to 250 meter in diameter is actually somewhat
below average in the area examined. The overall cumula-
tive size-frequency distribution of craters at the Surveyor V
landing site probably approaches the general frequency dis-

' tribution for craters on the mare surfaces determined from

Ranger VII, VIII and IX pictures also shown in Figure 6.

As a matter of interest, photographs in Figure 7 show
the earth as photographed by Surveyor VII. Upon close
examination the various continents can be seen as the earth
is shown to rotate about 30 degrees in each picture. The
Skyscraper Engineer will have been the first magazine to
publish this set of pictures.

In the final analysis, Surveyor did become more than
cold metal and hot wires. And the people who worked on
the spacecraft revered them. No keener dedication has ever
been displayed on a program as on the Surveyor program,

with people giving of their own personal time to meet.

critical schedules and launch windows. Team work was the
essence of conducting system tests, launch operations and
mission operations on a 24 hour daily basis. Hence, it is
clear, time robs us of the present, but through the wise use
of time and talents we build a better understanding of how
to contend with the future. And the future, because'of
accomplishments in the past, will bring even greater oppor-
tunity, challenge, growth, and understanding to solve the
mysteries and problems that beset mankind.

The young executive had taken $100,000 from his company's

Dan Johnson has a flair
for making things.

Just ask a certain family in Marrakeck, Morocco.

A solar cooker he helped develop is now making life
a little easier for them——in an area where electricity is
practically unheard of.

The project was part of Dan’s work with VITA
(Volunteers for International Technical Assistance)
which he helped found.

Dan’s ideas have not always been so practical. Like
the candlepowered boat he built at age 10.

But when Dan graduated as an electrical engineer
from Cornell in 1955, it wasn’t the future of candle-
powered boats that brought him to General Electric.
It was the variety of opportunity. He saw opportunities
in more than 130 “small businesses” that make up Gen-
eral Electric. Together they make more than 200,000
different products.

At GE, Dan is working on the design for agremote
control system for gas turbine powerplants. Some day
it may enable his Moroccan friends to scrap their solar
cooker.

Like Dan Johnson, you’ll ﬁnd opportunities at Gen-
eral Electric in R&D, design, production and technical
marketing that match your qualiﬁcations and interests.
Talk to our man when he visits your campus. Or write

Looking Back

 
   

 
  

It has been an unusual year. This year has been one
‘where we watched the new engineering building ‘spring’
up. Its completion is promised for 1969. We hope that
Benedum Hall will be unlike the Hillman Library, where
interior decorating goes on, still, almost three months past
the grand opening. We also hope Benedum Hall will be
fully equipped — again unlike Hillman Library whose
astounding size is offset by an equally astounding lack of
tables and study facilities. Solutions to these problems de-
pend on the fund drives now under way.

 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
     
 

But funds are not so easy to come by. This year past
has been a year where the University community was able
to observe first hand the swift, open minded performance
of the state legislature.

 
        

The School of Engineering has made many good ac-
complishments this year. Engineering intramural sports
improved greatly as a result of good planning, an expanded
iprogram, and increased enthusiasm on the part of most
departments. There are now ﬁve sports in the program,

 
   
   
   
   
 
  

  

football, volleyball, basketball, swimming, and track. The
program has also been well balanced; it includes three ex-
tended tournaments, football, volleyball, and basketball, and
two meets, swimming and track. Our congratulations go
out to the Metallurgical Engineers for showing the most
enthusiasm in the sports program._

Engineering Student Cabinet, Dean Hoelscher, Dean
Turkes, and all those who have co—operated with Cabinet
to enable the test ﬁle and the pass—fail option to become
realities deserve a note of thanks. Central Planning Com-
mittee for Engineers’ Week under the direction of chairman
Al Rocchini and faculty advisor Mr. William Conturo
worked very hard to program Engineers’ Week.

In closing the 1967-68 school year, our congratulations
go out to the Industrial Engineers for winning Engineers’
Week 1968. Though the week was shortened, spirit was
high and the Industrials came out on top in a close con-
test. On behalf of the S/gyscmper Eng1'r2eer'5 editorial and
business staffs I take this opportunity to wish everyone a
happy and proﬁtable summer.
