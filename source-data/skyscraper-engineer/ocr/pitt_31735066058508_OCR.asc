EROSPA CE PLANE

by Sanjiv Gupta

By the middle of the next century, people may be
flying routinely into space on on sleek, airplane-like
vehicles which will make the ponderous and powerful
rockets of today seem as archaic as dinosaurs. These
vehicles will be "aero-spaceplanes," a synthesis of
aircraft and space vehicles that could revolutionize space
transportation. Aero-spaceplanes are not a device of
fantasy, and their flights do not only exist exist in the
minds of dreamers. In fact, the United States has very
seriously examined the potential of such vehicles, and
has embarked on a program to build an experimental
prototype before the end of this century.

This article will look at the operation and key
technologies of an aero-spaceplane as it is envisioned
today.

Why an Aero-spaceplane?

within the atmosphere a conventional jet aircraft is
far more efficient than a missile. That is, a jet plane
requires considerably less propellant than a missile to lift
a certain mass of payload to a given altitude. There are
two major reasons for the aircraft's greater efficiency.
First, a jet engine obtains the oxygen it needs for
combustion from the air. A rocket motor must be
supplied with fuel and oxygen from tanks. Oxidizer tanks
usually occupy a large volume and add a great deal of
extra weight to the vehicle. Secondly, the missile is lifted
into the air exclusively by the thrust of the rocket motors,
a direct application of Newton's law of action and
reaction. The thrust of the engines must exceed the
weight of the vehicle at lift-off, or else it will not leave the
launch pad. This means that tremendous quantities of
propellants are consumed by the engines, which must
be very powerful. An airplane's engines, on the other
hand, rarely provide thrust which exceeds the weight of
the plane. In fact, in most cases they don't even come
close to doing so. The engines do not lift the plane into
the air, but instead are used to push it forward. This
causes air to flow past the wings, which lift the aircraft by
the principles of aerodynamic lift. Once the vehicle is
moving, it would continue to fly even without the

engines as long as its velocity remains high enough for
the wings to generate enough lift. A glider offers proof
of this fact. An airplane's engines only need to be
powerful enough to overcome aerodynamic drag and
push the plane through the air at the desired speed.

One of the important parameters of a launch vehicle
is the payload fraction, or the mass of the payload divided
by the total mass of the vehicle. As a result of the factors
described above, the payload fraction of a missile is
usually very small compared to that of a typical aircraft. A
missile weighing close to a million pounds at launch
might only be able to lift a payload of a few thousand
pounds, while some aircraft can carry close to their own
weight in payload.

The logical question, then, is why not make a vehicle
that exploits all of the advantages of a jet plane while it is
in the atmosphere, and then switches to rocket
propulsion to go into orbit? Such a vehicle would by
virtue of its greater efficiency lower in the atmospherebe
able to deliver a greater payload fraction into orbit than a
conventional rocket. Unfortunately, part of this payload
includes the dead weight of engines, wings, thermal
protection, and other things which serve no function in
space, so the net useful payload fraction could actually
be lower than a conventional rocket. But (and this is the
primary motivation behind the aero-spaceplane), even
though the useful payload fraction is lower, it would be
able to deliver the payload it to orbit and then return to
earth in one piece (without disposing of any stages). it
would have the efficiency to carry into orbit, and
subsequently return to earth, its own equivalent of the
lower stages that a rocket would jettison. IThus, it would
be a completely reusable space vehicle, which in the
long run could result in tremendous savings. A
conventional rocket flight to deliver a communications
satellite into orbit can cost up to $200 million, and the
entire launch vehicle is expended.

in principle, there is no reason why this reusable
"aero-spaceplane" is not possible. Reality is a bit more
complicated. Problems arise when we consider what is
necessary to achieve orbit. The payload must be lifted to
the proper altitude, about 150 miles for a low earth orbit

(LEO), and accelerated to orbital velocity, which is
approximately 17,000 miles per hour, or Mach 25. Now,
three factors are pertinent: most jet engines will cease to
function at about 150,000 feet (about 28 miles), no jet
engine in existence today can operate above Mach 5,
and most structural materials readily available today would
melt if subjected to the frictional heating at speeds well
above Mach 10 within the lower atmosphere.

Suppose we circumvent these barriers by building a
vehicle which flies like a plane up to 150,000 feet, at
Mach 5, and then uses rockets for the rest of the trip. If a
careful analysis of such a vehicle is carried out, one
would discover that absolutely nothing has been gained.
The altitude and speed increments obtained within the
atmosphere are small fractions of the target conditions.
Any improvements in efficiency during the atmospheric
part of the trip are probably more than offset by the
losses incurred from carrying the dead weight of wings
and jet engines for the rest of the flight. The only way to
reap any benefits from air-breathing, aerodynamic flight is
to give the vehicle a substantial portion of its final orbital
velocity while it is within the atmosphere, and then use
rockets to boost it up to orbital altitudes. In doing so, we
come head-to-head with the three problems mentioned
above, and several others’.

Until recently, the technologies necessary to begin
tackling the problems of transatmospheric flight were not
available. By the early-1980s, the fields of propulsion,
materials, and computer technology had advanced to a
point where it was reasonable to consider such a vehicle.
In 1982, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) conducted a series of classified
studies under the designation Copper Canyon and
concluded that an aero-space plane was possible. In his
State of the Union address in February, 1986, President
Reagan announced that the U.S. would initiate a
program aimed at solving the problems of
transatmospheric flight and then validate the technology
by building and flying a transatmospheric vehicle. The
joint NASA-Department of Defense program (which is
managed by DARPA) is called the National Aero-Space
Plane (NASP) Program, and the final flight hardware, to
be completed around 1993, was designated the X-30.

Propulsion

One of the key technologies necessary to make the
X-30 a reality is a highly-advanced, air-breathing
propulsion system capable of operating at hypersonic
velocities. Current research is centered around a type of
engine known as the supersonic combustion ramjet
(scramjet).

In its simplest form, a jet engine consists of a hollow
cylinder through which air flows. Inside the cylinder fuel
is sprayed into the air and ignited. As the fuel combusts,
it expands, and the superheated gas is forced through a
narrow nozzle on the way out, producing thrust. Such a

simple engine is referred to as a ramjet, because the air is
literally rammed into the engine by its fonivard velocity.
The obvious problem with a ramjet is that it must already
be moving in order to start, or else no air will be flowing
through it. A ramjet powered vehicle must have some
other form of propulsion to get it goingor must be air-
launched from another plane. The advantage of the
ramjet over other types is that, because it is so simple, it
is capable of operating at much higher speeds.

Most jet engines are of the turbcjet or fanjet variety.
The turbcjet is similar to the ramjet, except that it has a
series of rotating compressor stages at the inlet. These
compressors suck air into the engines so it doesn't have
to be in motion to operate. Furthermore, once turned
on, it is self sustaining, because the compressors are
linked by a shaft (the "spool") to turbine blades
downstream of the exhaust. The high velocity exhaust
gases cause the turbines to spin, which in turn makes
the compressors spin, drawing more air into the engine.
The fanjet is very similar to this.

Both types of jets have one thing in common: the air
flowing through them must be subsonic (slower than the
speed of sound). If it is not, the supersonic shock waves
created inside the engine will disrupt the smooth air flow
and cause the engine to stop operating (a "flameout").
Because of this limitation, all supersonic aircraft have
complex air intake duct geometries leading to the
engines which slow the incoming air to subsonic
velocities. In a Mach 2 plane, the air must be slowed
down by over 600 miles per hour. when the air slows
down it compresses and gets very hot. This causes the
ultimate limitation of a jet engine. After a certain velocity,
about mach 6, the air becomes so hot when it is
compressed by the engine that the oxygen molecules
dissociate. It can no longer support combustion, and the
engine becomes useless.

The scramjet solves this problem by letting the air
pass through it at supersonic velocities, hence its name.
The engine must be designed so that the supersonic

Rain. Once considered the life giving gift of the
heavens, it is now as likely to take life as to give it. This is
the phenomena of acid rain. What is acid rain, then?
Acid rain is technically defined as rain with a pH of less
than 5.65 (This is the pH of distilled water in equilibrium
with atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO2] under laboratory
conditions.) on a logarithmic scale. Note that with a
logarithmic scale, a pH shift of one indicates a change of
a factor of ten, and a pH shift of two a factor of one
hundred (i.e. pH drop from 6 to 4 would indicate one
hundred times the acidity) on scale of zero to fourteen.
The lowest recorded pH of a rainfall was in Wheeling,
West Virginia, in the fall of 1978 and sometimes
registered pHs of less than two during the course of a
three day drizzle. The pH of lemon juice in comparison is
approximately 2.1.

Acid rain, perhaps better called acid precipitation, for
it can and does exist as snow, ice, fog, dew, and mist as
well as rain, is a relatively recent occurrence in the history
of our earth, and this is because its causes did not exist
until recently. What are these causes? Primarily SOX an
N0x emissions along with the products of the reaction of
these compounds with light and other atmospheric
compounds. While it is true that these gasses can be
emitted by nature, those sources which contribute most
of the pollutants are the man made sources such as cars,
power plants and industrial facilities (as shown by table I ).

Sulfides are released in many iomts (S02, S03,
H28, as well as traces of sulfate salts and elemental
sulfur) but S02 is the most common form in the
atmosphere. S02 is oxidized in the atmosphere in two
ways: 1.) homogeneous reactions (all particles in gas
phase) and 2.) heterogeneous reactions (gas molecules
becoming attached to liquids and solids). The second
form of oxidation is as yet only incompletely understood
and it is uncertain to what degree it contributes to the
total amount ofoxidation. Only 20% of the S02 is
originally released as such, most of the remaining 80%
comes from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with the
oxygen in the air { H28 + 02 --> S02 + H2 }. This S02,
once it is in the atmosphere, combines further with
oxygen to form sulfur trioxide { 2802 + 02 <==> 2S03 }

10'

which in turn can combine with water to form sulfuric acid
{ S03 + H20 -->H2S04 }. It is this then which makes the
rain distinctly unhealthy, for plants and animals both.

The other primary culprit in the formation of acid
precipitation is nitrogen, or rather nitrogen compounds.
It is still uncertain exactly what percentage of the total
acid rain damage can be attributed to these compounds,
but some studies indicate that they could cause up to
twice the damage of sulfur compounds. These studies
show also that the damage from N0, is worst at a pH of
around 4, a pH typical of the rainfalls in many parts of the
United States, and indeed the world, today. Most of the
NOX is emitted by high temperature combustion which
"fixes" nitrogen with oxygen to form nitric oxide { N2 + 02 
--> 2N0 }, which is in turn oxidized in air to form nitrogen
dioxide { 2N0 + 02 --> 2N02 }. This is the most harmful
of the nitrogen compounds and aside from it's own
properties concentrations of as little as 3.0 ppm can be
detrimental to human health, and at concentrations of 8
to 10 ppm it can reduce visibility significantly.

In addition, it can combine with water to form nitric
acid and nitric oxide { 3N02 + H20 <==> 2HN03 + N0 }.
Another of the dangerous properties of this compound
is its ability to absorb ultraviolet light, this allows it to
produce ozone [03] which, although helpful in the
upper atmosphere can be harmful to plants when it is
released at a lower level. This ozone can also react with
nitric oxide to form nitrogen dioxide, which in turn
produces more ozone in a circular process (see tablell).
At higher elevations, ozone serves as a shield against
the suns ultra violet rays, and indeed there is a great deal

of concern recently that certain aerosols and
fluorocarbons could be dissipating the earth's
atmospheric shield of ozone.

The relative importance of NOX and Sox in acid rain
is, as stated before, undetermined, although it seems
that the two in combination are more dangerous than
either of them alone. Another fact to consider is that at
the present time, the amountof S0, emitted is roughly
equal to twice the amount of N0,‘ emitted. This fact
makes it very difficult to quantitatively assess the
relationship between the two compounds separately

outside of laboratory conditions. It may seem
unimportant and indeed irrelevant which culprit is most
responsible, but this is not the case.

Until now most efforts to control acid precipitation,
meager as they were, revolved only around the
elimination of the sulfur compounds. If the nitrogen
compounds are truly to be held accountable for an equal
or greater portion of the damage (Some estimates
indicate that ozone [03] produced from N02 could be
responsible for as much as 90% of the damage to cash
crops.), this strategy will clearly be ineffective. As
previously mentioned, the current rate of emission of
sulfur compounds is about twice that of nitrogen
compounds, but the amount of sulfur compounds
released is expected to increase by only 10% over the
next fifteen years, while the amount of nitrogen
compounds released is expected to increase by 27%
during the same time period. If the acid rain problem is to
be solved, it must not, it seems, rely solely on the
reduction of sulfur compounds,important as this is.

The problems associated with control of acid
precipitation are many and often not simply solved. The
question of sulfur compounds is concerned primarily with
heavy industry (For distributions of sulfur emissions, see
table Ill) and the regulation thereof. it is ironic that one of
the pollution control measures of the seventies, the tall
stack, helps contribute to the problem today. These
stacks were built with the intemion of reducing ground
level concentrations of sulfur and in this they
succeeded, but in the process, they allowed the sulfur
compounds to be spread around and fall on remote
wilderness areas far from the source of the problem.
(This has been a major point of contention of late
between Canada and the United States.) There are
many methods available to reduce the amount of sulfur in
emissions, some involving changes in fuel such as using
a lower sulfur coal or perhaps coal gasification or
investing in alternative fuel sources.

11

Others involve the modification of existing facilities
through the use of scrubbers. This basically involves the
filtering of the sulfur from plant emissions before it
reaches the atmosphere through the use of reactions

with various substances. Three of the most effective

scmbblng processes are:
1) Wet lime / Limestone
2) Magnesium oxide
3) Catalytic oxidation

All of these processes remove from 80% to 90% of
the sulfur contained in the emissions and can be
demonstrated to be cost effective as well.

The question of how to control nitrogen oxide
emissions is somewhat more complex, as a majority of
these emissions come from"mobile" sources (i.e. cars,
trucks, busses, etc.) as shown in table IV, the result of
high temperature combustion which "fixes" atmospheric
nitrogen with oxygen. There is still a sizable portion of
these nitrogen compounds which emanate from
businesses. Some of the methods mentioned for the
control of sulfur can also be effective in the control of
nitrogen (scrubbing, change of fuel [natural gas releases
much less NOX than coal], etc.) One of the best
methods, however, was not mentioned - the fluidized
bed combustion process

The fluidized bed combustion process operates by
mixing small particles of coal with limestone to remove
the sulfur from coal as it burns. An added bonus of this
process is that since it works at a much lower temperature
it will emit much fewer nitrogen compounds and can
accommodate a variety of fuels (grade coal, and even
combustible solid wastes) As new technology develops,
new methods for combating SO,‘ and NOX emissions will
develop as well, but for the present, it seems that this is
one of the more promising options available.

All of these processes involve a considerable initial
expenditure if they are to be effective on a global basis.
A question often asked then, especially by the

companies which would have to renovate or replace
equipment, is why bother? A simple economic reason is
easily provided in the fact that the benefits of such
operations have been predicted to exceed the cost, in
some estimates by as much as five billion dollars. This
includes the estimated reductions in crop losses,
material and property damage, and added employment
from the new industries involving production, installation,
and maintenance of scmbber new fuel and combustion
devices. This is.not thetme reason, however, that most
people wish to control the problem.

The real fact underlying the chemical and scientific
explanation of acid precipitation is that it is doing
damage, damage which is in some cases irreversible.
The great monuments left behind by the fallen
civilizations of the past, statues and buildings which have
stood for over a thousand years, are falling prey to this
new and unforseen menace. The sulfuric acid in the rain
reacts with the marble which many of these buildings and
statues are made of to change it from calcium carbonate
to calcium sulfate ( CaCO3 + H2804 --> CaSO4 + H20 +
CO2 }, which is water soluble and washes away, leaving
less and less of the edifices standing after each storm.
The nitric acid (as well as the sulfuric) is extremely
corrosive to metal and causes a great deal of damage to
modern structures as well. Since the estimated damage
to materials is in the four to five billion dollar range, this is
surely a cause for concern!

Perhaps the most important cause for alarm is the
damage to the earth itself. Some estimates place the
damage to vegetation (including cash crops) in the 35 to
75 billion dollar range. Behind this dollar amount is the
fact that the forests and lakes which are being destroyed
are not only irreplaceable, but also vital to the earth's
ecosystem.

The first victim of this silent plague is very often the
water. As the pH of lakes and streams falls, the fish begin
to die, until eventually all that remains is a lifeless pool.
The decline begins with a reduction in the number of
eggs, which hatch at a pH of about 5.5 (This pH is itself
fatal to some sensitive fish such as large and small mouth
bass and rainbow trout.), and by the time the pH reaches
4.8, the lake is pretty much incapable of supporting fish
of any species. This catastrophe is by no means limited
to fish or water, for as the quote says, "from water does all
life begin". Many kinds of insects and birds begin to
disappear as well, and subsequently the larger animals
which live around the polluted waters. Several thousand
lakes, both here and in Europe have already sunk
beneath this level. Ontario providence in Canada has
lost an estimated 1200 lakes to acid precipitation and has
an additional 3400 nearing the same point. Some 212
Adriondak lakes and ponds in New York, totaling some
10,460 acres have gone down as well. In Sweden, many
lakes have been lost and in Germany the Black Forest
has begun to decline.

Still another aspect of the environmental damage is
the damage to plant life. Many trees are already showing
signs of serious problems, especially evergreens.
Nitrogen acts as a fertilizer and so it seems bizarre to

12

assert that it does damage, but this is indeed the case.
The acids and ozone literally "bum" many plants, but
some, mainly evergreens, continue growing until far to
late in the year because of the added nitrogen. When
this happens, the trees do not have sufficient time to
produce the protective coating for their leaves and as a
result they often take severe damage during the winter.
This is only the first indication of an expanding problem,
as first one tree then another falls to this "chemical
leprosy".

Decaying buildings and dying plants, animals, lakes
and rivers all point to the danger of acid precipitation. Yet
still the problem is ignored in political circles, and this is
ultimately where the solution must originate, for few if any
companies will volunteer to spend the amount of money
necessary unless it is required of them. The current
administration denies the implications of the evidence
and calls for "conclusive" proof while gutting the Clean
Air Act and smothering any attempt at regulation, despite
the fact that most people do support pollution control
measures.

The question then, is if we desire to, or if indeed we
are capable of living in an antiseptic environment, devoid
forever of natural winds and rains, isolated forever from
an outside world made inhospitable by our own devices.
If some steps are not taken, and that soon, such may be
our fate. Many argue that the situation is not worsening,
and this may or may not be tme, but regardless, the level
of acid precipitation we have today is sufficient to
produce the aforementioned results without any
increase. The solution then is not to ignore the problem
but to recognize it. If wind, rain, plants and animals and
the feeling of freedom they imply are important, then
something must be done to halt this menace, and it must
be done by the ones who created it.

THE SKY CAPER

by Steve Sabram

A new term is with us and here are this issue's
problems. As usual the same rules from last issue apply.
The answers must be accompanied by/submitted on the
official skycaper entry form. They are due on April 4,
1988. Please mail your answers to Room 122 Benedum
Hall. The student who submits the most (correct)
answers will receive a prize of $25. in the case of a tie,
the earliest entry will win. Remember, rarely does the
winner get all of the answers correct. I thank Stephen
Frezza for devising the series in problem one and placing
problem three in rhyme. Now, with no further delay, here
they are 

1) There are twenty elements in the series below.
The first seven elements are given. What are the
following thirteen?

8,16,7,3,2,15,10,...

2) Bernie and Ert are playing a popular fantasy
role—playing game. Ert's character, Manox, causes one to
eight points of damage with his longsword. To compute
the damage, Ert rolls an eight-sided die. When Ert rolls
the die on the table, it cracks and a sphere rolls out of the
die. If the edge length of the eight-sided die is 1.5 cm,
what is the maximum possible diameter of the sphere?
Consider the eight-sided die to be an octahedron.

3) What is the answerto this riddle?
The Four Brothers

The Order they've entered is one
And one of is loves to have fun
Another of us lays herein and about
Not bothering even to chat.
Whilst sitting and reading a book
The third stays tucked in his nook.
The last is engrossed in his prayer
Ignoring the girl combing her hair.
They all rest quietly in the shadows
Observing students and their matters.
Where do they reside?

Hint: It is somewhere on Pitt's campus.

4) The following standings actually occurred in
1968 in a dream that M3 had in 1967:

TEAM W L

Los Angeles 80 55
San Fransisco 79 56
Pittsburgh 78 57
Cincinnati 77 58
Milwaukee 72 63

Philadelphia 63 72
St. Louis 58 77
Chicago 57 78
Houston 56 79
New York 55 80

As you know, the season is 162 games, and
coincidentally each team has the same number of games
left with each other team. According to Cincinnati's
sensational rookie catcher, each team will continue to
pray for the pennant until it is mathematically out of it.
How many teams are still praying? (This question is taken
from a past issue of SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER
magazine.)

5) This question is in tribute to the Constitutional
Convocation to be held at Pitt this term. The answer to
the following question was discovered by the author on a
trip to Washington DC this year.

The original Constitution that our founding fathers
signed was kept in storage out of public view for most of
the 19th century. A 19th century clerk wrote down a
number in the lower, right hand corner of one of the
pages of the Constitution to keep it filed. What number
is this?

6) Here's one for all of you Dr. who fans out there
in magazine land. Dr. Who travels through the
continuum in a TARDIS. What phrase is the root of the

Co-op Program Grows

It's been a good first year for the engineering
school's Co-op Program. Last academic year, mailers
were sent to engineering and science firms around the
country announcing the existence of the program.
Since then, many firms with an interest in the program
have responded. Ms. Lori Shuff, the former program
coordinator, started to announce the program at
departmental seminars last winter term. Currently there
are about one hundred applicants waiting for co-op
positions.

A co-op student will take five years to earn their
bachelors degree instead of the usual four. One term of
each of the last three years is spent working for a chosen
firm; the other terms are spent taking classes. Co-op
students graduate in December of their fifth year. A
minimum OPA of 2.5 is required to apply for the program.
To apply, one must fill out an application form at the
Freshman Office. Listings of firms that are interested in
co-op students are regularly posted outside the
Freshman Office on the seventh floor of Benedum
Engineering Hall. Students that have applied for a co-op
position are encouraged to regularly view these
postings. If a co-op applicant finds a firm that they are
interested in, they should request an interview at the
freshman office.

Co-ops spend all three of their employment terms
working for the same firm. Here a student gets to find out
what "real engineering" is all about by actually working in

. industry on various projects the firm assigns. A student

can drop out of the co-op program at anytime but cannot
reenter. Westinghouse, General Dynamics and GM-
Delco Electronics are some of the firms that are currently

WESTINGHOUSE

THE TRLALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF AN INDUSTRIAL GIANT

Jim Liszewski

" ...ceaseIess/y working for the extension of electricity
into new fields, for the improvement of present methods
and apparatus, and for the invention and perfection of
new apparatus and machinery. "

-from a PR booklet, 
g,Qe_ra1jQa, circa 1928)

Is it possible for a large corporation to lose sight of
its own direction? ls integrity losing its place in big
business? Why are big corporations becoming
conglomerations of many small businesses, rather than
the large manufacturing and engineering firms they once
were? Shouldn't we be concerned? Example in point,
Westinghouse Electric Corporation.

George Westinghouse founded his company in
1886, and in 1894 he moved it to Pittsburgh. At the
time, and well into the 1970's, it was a large manufacturer
of electrical and steam engines and machine parts, both
for the house and for industry. Works were located
across the U.S., including Attica, N.Y., Derry, Pa.,
Homewood, Pa., Newark, N.J., South Bend, Indiana,
and, most importantly to us, here in Pittsburgh.

Westinghouse has become probably the most
important business finn in Pittsburgh, as well as one of, if
not the, largest employers here, with 23,332 people in
1985. It is obvious, then, that changes the company
makes do affect many of us and our families. And in the
past few years, through the process of time and a
changing economy, Westinghouse has undergone a lot
of adjustments. We should be aware.

Westinghouse today is on its way of becoming an
entirely new type of business. To show you what the
company is all about, I'm going to dicuss two major
occurrences that Westinghouse has undergone, and
then explain how they have set the tone for its present
and future.

Firstly, in 1975, a group of utilities sued
Westinghouse, a long time manufacturer and servicer of
nuclear power plants, for not fulfilling its promises to
provide 80 million pounds of uranium [uranium that it
didn't have] at fixed prices that were then far below
prevailing market prices. In an agreement that was
settled out of court, Westinghouse lost $500 million.

All through the 1970's the corporation, was

16

 

struggling to survive not only the financial loss, but also
the blow it took to its reputation. Even a single incident
can, and did, make contract bidding and dealing with
other corporations very difficult for years. Trust. as well
as quality problems, remain major sources of headaches
for the company. A few examples :

-The New York Transit Authority concluded that
faulty Westinghouse parts were causing short circiuts in
60 new subway cars, resulting in power losses within the
subway system

-During a trial of the Sergeant York Division Air
Defense Gun, for which Westinghouse designed the
radar system, the system mistook a bathroom exhaust
fan on the roof of a building for a helicopter,and later
even zeroed in on a regiment of Army officers. Needless
to say, the $4.5 billion contract was closed.

-Its employees have even had reason to distrust the
company : A U.S. District court ruled against the
company on March 1986, and in favor of 35 employees
at a Lester,Pa. plant, in a ruling that will affect older
workers nationwide. Westinghouse engaged in "blatant,
willful age discrimination” against older employees. Laid
off employees eligible for early retirement, were told that
if they didn't retire early and forego severance pay, they
would lose medical, dental, and life insurance, and would
see a further reduction in pension, thereby giving the
workers no choice but to retire. The suit expects to cost
the company $10 million. Westinghouse intends to
appeal.

The second and more recent transition for
Westinghouse came in December 1983 when Douglas
D. Danforth took over as chairman and chief executive. A
63-year-old former engineer at Westinghouse, Danforth
has taken on a challenge of putting the aging corporation
into the "winner's circle". He feels that the corporation

EADCAD 64) 65.) (A)

can be among the elite in the world,alongside highly
respected institutions like General Electric and IBM
Corporation. Though this is a somewhat typical goal, the
manner in which he intends to do this is what makes
Danforth's plans so interesting.

We've identified two major causes of change for
Westinghouse. Also, we've dicussed some problems
that have resulted from our first point (quality problems).
The remainder of the article will focus on the direction
that the company has taken due to our second point
(Danforth).

Westinghouse has not been facing problems that
are necessarily unique to itself. Many other companies
have also been affected by the lack of profits from the
more traditional old-line manufacturing plants,such as
switches and electric devices, appliances, turbine
generators, and even Westinghouse light bulbs. Most of
the blame for decline has been given to foreign
competition and more competitive markets, and whether
or not this was the best assumption, something had to
be done. With Danforth as the new man at
Westinghouse, his new ideas went into affect and what
amounts to a new philosophy was drawn up. Just as the
1975 suit set a tone for the company's performance, so
has Danforth set a tone for the company's business
philosophy. According to Danforth, today
Westinghouse is a corporation that will "continue to take
steps necessary to be even more cost competitive and
to be able to provide greater value to our customers."

A key theme noticable in this quote involves the
words "cost comptetive" and "value." This has been a
vital part of the restructuring plan. In fact, as a strategy for
the future, Westinghouse intends to build up only those
divisions that outgrow the gross national product by 3%
each year. One of the consequences of this plan is
another phrase used in the quote above.

‘To take steps necessary" has been an important
part of Danforth's work with the company. His plan's
since 1983 have been to place less emphasis on mature
manufacturing and utility businesses in favor of faster
growing areas such as services, cable television,
robotics, and defense electronics. He has out, sold, or
moved divisions left and right, and has received much
criticism from industry as well as employees. As a result
of the company's restructuring, it has moved away from
approximately 34 business lines and plants. Danforth is
quite proud of this seemingly unstable fact, saying, "It's
going to be 26 very successful businesses” in the near
future.

The following is a mndown of the major
Westinghouse divisions and their futures due to the
Douglas Danforth philosophies.

17

Energy and Advanced Technology Group.

This is the nuclear, power generating, defense, and
robotics division, and is also its largest. Nuclear power
has always been a specialty of Westinghouse, with about
72 plants in the world and 20 on order or under
construction. But while Danforth is looking to depend on
nuclear power for revenues, the industry right now is
looking the other way. The high cost of construction, the
delays commonly associated with construction of the
plants, the sluggish growth in electricity, and even the
recent Chernobyl event have all put dampers on the
order of new plants. Two main results have come from
this: 1) layoffs, and 2) increase in servicing and
maintaining, ratherthan manufacture, of plants.

Most recently, in November 1986, Westinghouse
had to annouce a cutback of 10% of its 12,000 workers
who design, build, and service nuclear and fossil fuel
electrical generating systems. Westinghouse tries to
minimize the effect of its layoffs through its early
retirement plans. However, when older employees
leave, they take with them their expertise, which
obviously is a factor in the bidding of contracts.

As an example of this effect, South Korea has been
constructing several reactors in the last ten years. Until
1981 Westinghouse - one of, if not the, largest builders
of nuclear power plants - had been involved with 6 out of
9 plants, providing much needed work for the division.
But in October 1986, the corporation was not even
allowed to bid for the eleventh and tweMh reactors, as
the negotiating rights went to General Electric and
Combustion Engineering,lnc. Expertise is generally a
large factor that is looked into when considering
contracts, and this was even more interesting of a
decision by South Korea considering that utilities usually
stay with the same companies with which they started.

Orders industrywide for nuclear power plants are at a
standstill at the present, so when manufacturing is down,
something must fill the gap. Westinghouse's future in
nuclear power is geared towards the service and
refueling of existing plants. In 1978 manufacturing was
50% of its nuclear business, while 1983 figures show
that down to 25%. Even non-nuclear utilities are at 1/3
the amount of manufacture in the past. While servicing is
not as stable nor as high profit an industry as
manufacturing, it is again necessary to note that it is the
fast-growing, highly competitive type of business that
represents today's Westinghouse.

Defense electronics is and will be a cornerstone of
profit for Westinghouse, as a backlog of contracts will
keep that division busy for at least five years. These
include radar for the F-16 fighter/bomber, AWACS plane,
and B-1 B bomber, along with electronic countermeasure

In your course of studies here at the University of
Pittsburgh, you have probably come across a certain
amount of quantum theory, some of it possibly even
applying to physics. A certain understanding of this
fascinating field can come in extremely useful,
sometimes even in physics.

Naturally, there are a number of gifted and slightly
fanatical researchers at the University who are willing,
maybe even more than willing, to discuss their projects
with the Skyscraper. Because this field is so rich and
varied, one can only cover a small area of it at once, but
quantum theory deals with this sort of thing anyway and
not only finds it permissible, but actually encourages" it.
This article concerns one of the most exciting little areas,
subatomic particle physics, or the practice and theory of
smashing things to bits.

lfirst discussed quantum theory with Dr. lpse Dixit, a
visiting professor from the University of Killiecrankie,
Scotland. She is currently occupying the position of
Distinguished Service Professor of Total Subatomic
Annihilation in the Physics department. While other
researchers are interested in finding an elemental
particle that composes every other particle, Dr. Dixit
specializes in finding particles that serve a useful
purpose. She is primarily known for her discovery of the
futon, the only subatomic particle that folds out into a
bed. Some of her other successful discoveries are: a
particle that weighs approximately 25.7 kg, one that
sticks to walls, and one that can pass through two
diseased chickens without losing momentum. "We are
applying for grant money and extra dilithium crystals to
find appropriate uses forthese,” she revealed.

She is currently trying to discover a particle that gets
over 100 krn/l. "So far," she said, inserting three dull
pencils into a lead box on her desk, “we have one that
gets 25 krn/I, but that is nowhere near our goal." She
leaned back, smiling, and bmshed a few 1:-mesons off

18

her lab coat.

"My colleagues back in Scotland and I
dream that one day all labor will be done by subatomic
particles!" She leaned forward and banged her fist on her
desk, sending small splinters of wood flying in various
orbital paths. "Think of it! No longer will there be any
professions. Particles will cook, clean, perform surgery,
host television programs..." She drew a deep breath.
"We will no longer need people. The Particle will reign
supreme!" She reached across the desk, eyes 94.1%
circular, and pulled four sharp pencils from the lead box.
Subsequent calculations indicate that Prof. Dixit's
statement will lower her popularity with union leaders
approximately 79.02%.

Dr. Dixit is also working to narrow the gap between
American and Soviet developments in this field. "The
Soviets," she said, "have found a particle that washes
clothes. Rumor has it that they're about to find one that
replaces light bulbs." Her face turned red. "Do you
realize exactly what this means?” I shook my head no,
although I had my suspicions and left before I could
oonfirmthem.

I then chose to talk to Dr. Sidney Deluge, another
researcher in the Physics department, known
affectionately among his colleagues as the department's
"karyolymph." He is very active within the department
and is well known for what other professors jokingly refer
to as his boundless energy.

He can usually be found in the deeply involved in his
wartime research in particle physics in his office or one of
the many empty classrooms in Benedum, but also has an
enviable reputation as a pioneer in the study of Brownian
motion. As I approached his office in Benedum, one of
the other researchers in the department opened his
door and asked to borrow a spare nutrino, but Dr. Deluge
bounced out, down the hall, into the stairwell, and deep
into the proverbial heart of Benedum. He has, in fact,
been sighted several times since, throwing himself

against the walls, doors, windows, and elevators of the
building, but has not as yet been isolated for an
interview.

Another interesting and perhaps less experiential
approach to subatomic particle physics is practiced by
Prof. Gary Ribbentrop, a neuroradiologist at the
University. In the course of his neurological work, he
became interested in the radioactive dye often used to
trace blood flow in the brain, and now keeps a small
cyclotron in his office, as well as a rack of brightly-colored
shirts.

Prof. Ribbentrop has managed to find a particle that
upsets all current theories of subatomic composition.
This particle was originally thought to be the Iong-sought-
after magnetic monopole, but on closer analysis, it
turned out to be nonémagnetic, and composed entirely
of collapsed wave functions. While quantum theory has
never concerned itself with what happens to the parts of
Schrodinger wave functions that collapse, scientists are
now proposing that they form concentrations and
gradually turn into one of these particles. It has, as a
result of its composition, a very strange orbital path. This
path is, in fact, so strange that no one is exactly sure
what, if indeed anything, the particle is orbiting.
Speculations range from nutrinos to eta particles,
California, theta, and Ed McMahon's head. So far, none
of these theses has proven convincing, let alone
desirable.

Prof. Ribbentrop would like to name his particle
Duade, but convention (and, so it seems, various local
ordinances) prevent this. Prof. Ribbentrop refused to
comment further on the issue. "Its..." He pulled a white
Persian cat from his desk drawer and began to stroke it
lightly. ”lt's none of your concern." He held the cat up to
the light, as if to look through it, and turned to me. "Bet
you it's Schrbdingers.”

Prof. Rlbbentrop's main problem, however, seems

19

to be that, while one of the energy levels of the particle is
in his lab, none of the others are, and he has no set idea

where he should look. ''If I could find another energy
level, I'd have a shot at calculating at least one of the
others, and in turn find the others, and so on." He
looked around the room, then turned, and approached
me, amrs out. "Say, you wouldnt happen to have one,
would you?" He trembled slightly. "Would you?"

Suddenly, Dr. Deluge broke through the door and
into the room, screaming, "Neutron bombardment!
Neutron bombardment!" and striking Prof. Ribbentrop
on the head with a baseball. He then reached over the
desk and took the cat. He bounced out again, muttering
something about putting it in a box.

Prof. Flibbentrop was taken, unconscious, to
Presbyterian University Hospital, and was last seen deep
within Western Psych, cutting mbbius strips in half. The
cat has not yet been found.

shock waves do not interfere with its operation, and so
that it can withstand the high temperatures of hypersonic
flight. Since the air flows through the engine so quickly,
ordinary jet fuel cannot be used. The reaction time
between the oxygen and jet fuel molecules is longer
than the average time that an oxygen molecule spends
in the engine. Fast burning liquid hydrogen must be
used to fuel a scramjet.

Unlike subsonic aircraft, the engines on a
supersonic plane cannot simply be attached to the wings
or fuselage by pylons. Instead, the engine and intake
design must be carefully integrated into the airframe, so
that the supersonic shock waves from various parts of
the aircraft do not interfere with the engine air flow. In the
hypersonic X-30, this careful aerodynamic integration
becomes even -more important, in fact, to the point
where the entire bottom of the fuselage is considered to
be part of the propulsion system. The shape of the X-
30's fuselage will be determined in large part by the need
to direct a smooth, stable airflow into the scramjets, and
the need to properly shape the exhaust plume in order
to maximize thrust. Complete analysis and optimization
of various airframe/engine integration techniques has
become possible only recently due to the advent of
supercomputers. The equations used to describe the air
flow around a complex body at hypersonic velocities are
a computational nightmare and without supercomputers
like the Cray, would be impossible to solve in any
reasonable period of time. Computer modeling is being
used extensively by NASA to optimize the shape of the
X-30 before any hardware is manufactured, since even a
minor alteration in one component of the propulsion
system could result in a complete reworking of the
vehicle's aerodynamics.

Like the ordinary ramjet, the scramjet must be
moving to start. In fact, it must be moving at about mach
3. Thus, the X-30 must have three sets of engines on
board to help it complete its mission: turbojets for
takeoff, scramjets to accelerate it close to orbital velocity,
and rocket motors for the final velocity kick and the boost
into orbit. The next generation of aero-spaceplanes,
after the X-30, may have "dual-mode” engines that
operate as jets within the atmosphere and later convert
into rockets.

Materials

Most ordinary aircraft are made of aluminum. It is
lightweight and strong, two very important qualities of an
aircraft structural material. However, it begins to weaken
at about 300°F, making it unsuitable for high
temperature applications like engine housings. Another
source of heat is the frictional heating caused by air
molecules striking the skin of the aircraft. The faster the
plane goes, the more frictional heating it experiences.

Up to about mach 3 aluminum can handle the heat, but
for anything faster an alternative material must be found.

A good candidate for a "high-speed” metal is steel.
It can withstand much higher temperatures than

20

aluminum, and there is no question about its strength.
At least one mach 3 aircraft, the North American XB-70A
Valkyrie, had a stainless steel fuselage. Unfortunately,
steel is also very heavy. For a much higher price and with
considerably more complicated manufacturing
techniques, one can use titanium, which has the same
heat resistance as steel but weighs half as much. The
mach 3 plus Lockheed SR-71, which is currently the
fastest jet aircraft in the world, is made primarily of
titanium. But even titanium would weaken at speeds well
above mach 3 at which airframe temperatures may
exceed 1,000 °F. Finally we enter into the realm of
exotic metal alloys. The legendary X-15 rocket—prope|led
hypersonic research plane was built from a nickel-
chromium alloy called lnconel-X. However, even the X-
15 was limited to speed of around Mach 6. To go faster,
up to a planned Mach 8, the aircraft was coated with a
special ablative material which absorbed the intense
frictional heat and then burned away, protecting the
metal below. Unfortunately, after achieving Mach 6.7
(which is still the official air speed record) the X-15 was so
badly damaged from the heat (despite the fuselage
coating) that it neverflew again.

Clearly, the operating environment of the X-30 is
outside the realm of ordinary aircraft flight. Perhaps the
next logical place to look for structural materials is
spacecraft. While reentering the Earth's atmosphere,
spacecraft experience the kinds of temperatures that the
X-30 will have to deal with.

what is the space shuttle made from? Curiously
enough, the answer is aluminum. The reason it doesn't
melt is because of its Thennal Protection System (TPS),
those infamous silica tiles. A shuttle orbiter is covered
with over 24,000 tiles made from high purity silica
(basically glass), each one uniquely shaped and
numbered and carefully glued into place on the
aluminum airframe. The tiles can do what metals could
not (when the shuttle was designed): they can withstand
the tremendous temperatures of atmospheric
hypersonic flight. Unfortunately, the tiles can't be used
as a structural material because they're too brittle. If the
shuttle were made of silica, it would crack into thousands
of pieces. in a sense, the tiles are a "pre—cracked" shell
over the aluminum airframe. Thus, silica, a ceramic rather
than a metal, offers one possible solution to the heat
problem, but at a price. It is very light-weight (each tile is
90% air), very heat-resistant, but not very strong.

For the highest temperature parts of the shuttle, the
nose cap and wing edges, even ceramics fail, and an
advanced material called reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC)
is used. RCC belongs to a class of materials called
composites. Composites are composed of fibers (or
particles) of one substance embedded in a matrix, or
"binder," of another. In the particular case of RCC the
fibers are graphite and the binder a phenolic carbon
resin, hence the seemingly redundant name "carbon-
carbon" (the "reinforced" refers to a silicon carbide
coating on the carbon which prevents oxidation). Some
composites are stronger than steel, lighter than

aluminum, and can withstand much higher temperatures

than metals. They achieve these remarkable
characteristics by blending the properties of their two
component substances. For example, a ceramic matrix
composite, with metal fibers, would have the same
thermal properties as the shuttle's tiles, but would
simultaneously be useful as a structural material. The
science of composites has come a long way since the
shuttle was developed, and they will play a key role in the
X-30's structure.

Like the shuttle, the X-30 will probably use some
form of RCC for the hottest parts of the airframe,
including the nose, wings, and stabilizers. However, to
help dissipate the heat load, active cooling will be used.
The X-30's liquid hydrogen fuel must be stored at
cryogenic temperatures (about 20 Kelvin), so if the fuel is
routed through the hottest parts of the airframe before
going to the engines it will absorb a great deal of the
heat. This also increases the efficiency of the engines,
because it brings the fuel closer to its reaction
temperature.

Most of the fuselage itself may be composed of
advanced alloys of such exotic metals as niobium and
molybdenum. Using new manufacturing techniques,
these "superalloys" will be formed into lightweight parts
from which the fuselage's outer shell can be built. The
exterior surfaces can be coated with special refractory
coatings which help protect the metal. Temperatures at
the top of the fuselage may at times approach 1,400 °F.
Underneath the metal, a layer of insulation might be used
to protect the inner structures, which could be
composed of organic matrix composites (such as
graphite-epoxy).

For the scramjet inlets, ducts and nozzles a ceramic
matrix composite could be used. These parts of the
airframe will experience continuous heat loads in excess
of1,000 °F.

Computers

The X-30 depends in two major ways on state-of-the-
art computer technology. First, as mentioned before,
supercomputers will be used extensively during the
development and design of the X-30 to perform complex
aerodynamic and thermodynamic calculations related to
the shape and stmcture of the vehicle. Secondly, the X-
30 will require a highly advanced digital fly-by-wire

   

21

electronic flight control system.

The current space shuttle flight control system is
very sophisticated and powerful. The heart of the
system is a group of four IBM 101 general-purpose digital
computers which receive input from a vast array of
sensors and then generate commands to guide the
shuttle during all phases of flight. However, the shuttle's
system may not be adequate for the X-30, because the
aero-spaceplane has a much more demanding flight
profile. If the aircraft strays too far from its prescribed
flight profile it may bum-up orfail to achieve orbit.

Unlike the materials and propulsion technologies
discussed above, the computer technology is advancing
at a rapid enough pace without the NASP program that it
should not prove to be a major roadblock to developing
the X-30. Nevertheless, the flight control system will be
highly complex and difficult to develop.

What It All Means

When the X-30 begins its flight testing sometime in
the mid 1990's, it will be breaking records on a routine
basis. Among other things, the X-30 will be the fastest
and highest flying air-breathing aircraft ever built, the first
single-stage-to—orbit vehicle (i.e.-it won't drop expended
stages or boosters like a rocket vehicle does), and the
first vehicle to achieve orbit after a horizontal takeoff.

Perhaps more importantly, though, the National
Aero-Space Plane will pave the way for future,
operational aero-spaceplanes vehicles that could
potentially lower the cost of transporting payloads into
orbit by at least an order of magnitude. The X-30 itself will
be purely a research vehicle. It will carry a crew of two
experimental test pilots, and a small payload of test
instrumentation. However, if the program is successful
the mature technology could be applied to developing a
fleet of operational aero-space planes which, for certain
missions, would be far more economical to operate than
rockets. Some critics of the program are skeptical of
such claims, and for good reason: they have the space
shuttle as an example. Similar reductions in the cost of
space transportation were projected for the shuttlebut
proved to be unattainable. But it is precisely because of
the uncertainties in the aero-space plane's operational
effectiveness that the NASP program was initiated.
Instead of plowing full speed ahead into an "operational"
program, the NASP is being treated strictly as an
experimental prototype. If and only if it lives up to
expectations will any money or effort be expended in an
operational system. Such a system would be even
better than the X-30 because it would represent a
second generation of aero-space vehicles, with the X-30
experience to draw upon. Even if the NASP program
demonstrates that the aero-space plane is not a realistic
option for a safe, economical space transportation
system, it would still not have been a wasted effort. The
knowledge acquired during the program will be
invaluable, and almost certainly applicable to other types
of aerospace systems.

separate location in space, thus producing a separate
signal from each location with its own unique frequency
(fL=kBo, with Bo varying at each location). Realistically
this cannot be done, but another similar technique is
utilized: in a succession of subsidiary experiments a
series of magnetic-field profiles can be used that are well
characterized but vary in one direction only. This can
generate projection data similar to that of X-ray
tomography. The currents in the gradient-generating
coils are changed incrementally so that the gradient
direction can be rotated through 180°. Slice definition
can also be achieved by using field gradients. Two-
dimensional (cross-sectional) and three-dimensional
images can be constructed through the use of a series of
MRI projections and oomputers.7

sclerosis can also be identified.3

Detailed images of the cardiovascular system can
also be achieved with MRI. The ability of magnetic
resonance imaging to differentiate moving fluid from
stagnant fluid (and, to some extent, degrees between
these two extremes) provides an enormous advantage in
cardiovascular evaluation; rapidly flowing, slow flowing,
stagnant, and clotted blood can be easily distinguished.
The myocardium and the walls of the cardiac chambers,
among many other structures, can also be shown. MRI
also provides a good deal of information on the
pulmonary system.9

Magnetic resonance imaging provides good images
of the canilagenous component and other soft tissue
components of bone (bone itself being invisible). It can,

osteogenic sarcoma and thus improve surgical
planning.”

What is provided in this article is by no means
comprehensive; many other clinical applications exist.
The list of these applications is long, and further ones are
currently being developed. Likely the success of this
research will lead to further ideas about possible
application of magnetic resonance imaging or may
indeed show us a completing new imaging technique.
No one knows what the future may hold.

Clinical studies have indicated no danger from
magnetic resonance imaging at fields up to 2 T (the
upper limit of most studies). Stronger fields (4-6 T) may
cause temperature increases in the body, depending on
the ability of the body to lose heat and the choice of
imaging techniques and pulse sequences. No
guidelines for temperature elevation have yet been
established, although elevations of less than 1°C may be
considered safe. Any other biological hazards are yet to
be discovered.‘ 1

Danger from magnetic fields need not be direct,
however. Certain physical hazards can arise from the
effect of a magnetic field on ferromagnetic objects; any
such object brought near the magnet will experience a

powerful force. Thus patients with implanted objects or
devices, such as cardiac pacemakers and all types of
metal implants, must be excluded from MRI scanning.
Additionally, no metal object should be worn by the
patient. This is the only major hazard presented by MRI
scanning - but obviously it can be easily avoided by
taking simple precautions.

Magnetic resonance imaging, by using the
properties of atoms, physical laws, and computers,
provides medicine with a safe and invaluable tool in early
diagnosis of certain diseases and improvement of
surgical techniques. Additionally, due to the technology
involved in this technique, an increasing number of
physicians are pursuing degrees in physics and electrical
engineering. MRI presents no known hazard and can
thus be used more frequently than other techniques
involving X-rays. it has already saved many lives and
improved others. Other benefits will surely arise from
current research; at this time, one can only imagine what
will be achieved and learned with this advanced, yet
nonetheless nascent, technology.

by Chris Eddy

The subject of surveillance is rarely ever discussed
in any detail. information is understandably hard to come
by. There is little to be found in magazines or
bookstores. One of the best ways to obtain information
about surveillance, besides working for a government
agency, is to buy surveillance equipment from
companies, usually through the mail. The intention of
this article is to increase the reader's knowledge only.
The author does not suggest attempting to realize any of
the methods described here, as the legal liability is
immense.

Telephone Tapping

There are four major on-premise telephone
surveillance techniques. There are the series, parallel,
drop in, and the hookswitch bypass. The first two involve
devices which must be placed on the phone line, either
in or near the house (the tap can exist as far away as the
junction on the pole). The last two involve units which
must be placed inside one or more of the phones in the
house.

The series and parallel types of bugs are wired into
the phone line. The simplest example is a mini-tape
recorder with a device to interface it to the line. When
the phone is off the hook, the device triggers the tape
recorder to begin recording the signal on the line.
Another type simply takes the signal and transmits it via
radio. These kind can be independently powered by a
battery or operate from the current on the phone line. If
powered by the line, it must be a series type, as a parallel
would trigger the phone line into a disconnected
condition at all times.

when attempting to locate these bugs, the
investigator can simply do a visual inspection. This does
not ensure success, though. The best approach is to
test the phone line for an impedance which is out of the
range of the normal line resistance. Some types show
up as a pure resistance, while others might appear to be
a capacitor. The first might appear on an ohm-meter, but
the second, referred to as being capacitively coupled,
takes a more elaborate detection scheme. A third type is

24

coupled to the line inductively. In the path of a phone
line, inductive influences are normally encountered,
such as power lines, metal structures, etc. This makes
detection especially difficult.

The least professional type of telephone listening
device is probably the drop-in transmitter. As its name
implies, it can be dropped into the phone in place of the
microphone element. in addition to sending the
telephone conversation through the phone line, it also
converts it into a radio signal which can be received in the
neighborhood near the home. Range is dictated by the
transmitting power of the drop-in, the terrain
characteristics, and the receiving antenna's sensitivity.

The fourth type of bug is popular, as it has
advantages over the others. Referred to as the
hookswitch bypass, it is installed in the phone. The
hookswitch in the phone, which connects the phone to
the line when in use, is bypassed with this device. The
audio signal from the microphone element is coupled
omo the line without passing DC current, which would
disturb the status of the phone. The audio signal which
is now present on the line is picked up using some other
technique. What this basically means is that the
interested party can listen to you whether you are using
the phone or not. As rugged and old as some phones
are, most have an amazing amount of sensitivity. Keep in
mind that the listener is using an amplifier with more gain
than phones have.

You may have noticed in a few spy movies that when
the actor must have a private conversation, he simply
turns the rotary dial half a turn and places a pencil in the
hole to hold it. This effectively shorts out the phone line,
rendering a hookswitch bypass inoperable.

More elaborate types of hookswitch bypasses are
possible. One type may be legally used in conjunction
with a court order, when control of the phone line is
possible from the central office. It incorporates a neon
bulb, so that when the line voltage is raised to the
breakdown voltage of the bulb, the bypass becomes
active. Another type is based on elaborate timing
schemes. when the listener wants to activate the
device, he simply calls the number. When the party

answers, he simply hangs up. The bug is then activated
for a preset time interval, or until the owner of the phone
picks up to make a call.

Zone Monltorlng

Zone monitoring devices oorne in four basic
varieties. There are hard—wired, RF, carrier frequency,
and optically coupled types. All zone types monitor the
room with a microphone and export the signal using one
of many approaches.

Hard-wired devices are placed at the end of a pair of
wires which exit the house. They derive power from the
line, and send the signal back out on it. An easy way to
accomplish this is to use the two unused wires on the
phone system. Although Ma Bell provides four lines,
red, green, black, and yellow, only red and green are
used. A path must then be found from the terminal box
outside of the house to the earphones of the listener.

RF bugs incorporate radio frequency to link
themselves to the receiver. Most often used is the 30-
170 Mhz range of the FM band. These types can take
power from a battery or the power system of the house.
One was discovered which ran a short wire outside of the
window and had a solar cell glued to a brick on the face of
the building.

Carrier frequency bugs also take power from the AC
line, but the signal is sent back out over the same power
line. The signal can be tapped off of the power line
anywhere on the same branch, all of the way up to the
reduction transformer on the telephone pole. These
bugs are hard to find, as they do not emit any RF and can
come in a lot of disguises. Some are just the basic
electronics built into an appliance. Some look like a light
bulb (which doesn't light up) or an extension cord.

Optically coupled devices are rare and expensive.

The signal picked up in the room is modulated onto a
light source, usually a high intensity infrared device. The
light is picked up outside of the house, through the
window. The sound is then demodulated off of the light
carner.

Exterior Eavesdropping

One more major class of listening devices exists.
These are external microphones and window-bounce
listening approaches.

Microphones are aimed in the direction of the
conversation and amplified. One type uses a shotgun-
type sound isolator, ensuring isolation from unwanted
sound. Another uses a parabolic dish to concentrate the
sound, reducing the demand on the performance of the
amplifier. These types cannot be used to listen through
walls and are generally restricted to line of sight.

The other type of eavesdropping, called window-
bounce, is performed by bouncing a coherent signal off
of the window and receiving the reflected signal. The
coherent source can be a maser, which is coherent
microwave energy, or a laser. The window acts as a
magnificent microphone, and the vibrations produced
are modulated onto the reflected wave. All that is left is
to receive and dernodulate the reflected light.

Security at the White House supposedly ensures
privacy against this type of eavesdropping by playing
classical music on the window panes. There may be a
possible flaw in our national security. If the same channel
of audio is played on all of the windows, couldn't two
windows be monitored and the resultant signals be
cancelled to produce the background conversation?
Maybe there is no such thing as a truly private
conversation.

systems to jam enemy radar, and ground-based radar,
command, and control systems. Even this division is
untouched by Danforth, however, as approximately 700
out of 13,000 workers at the Linthicum, Md. plant were
laid off in October 1985 due to the termination of the
$657 million contract for the Sergeant York antiaircraft
gun (referto earlier in the article).

Bought in early 1983 for $107 million,
Westinghouse's robotics maker Unimation,lnc. has only
brought losses.’ A major problem with the division stems
from the fact that it has no electric spot weld unit, a
necessity if it is to be sold to automakers. Automakers
are the largest customers of robotics today. Until this
year,this was the only marginal division that Danforth had
not taken the axe to, as he repeated maintained that
Westinghouse would "keep and fix" it. As with other
slow growing divisions, Danforth didn't continue efforts
for very long, as it was sold to Prab Robots Inc. in June
1987, just four years after its purchase. 350 workers
were laid off.

Commercial Group

This is the division of Westinghouse that best
exemplifies the corporatation's future. It is composed of
many fast growing small businesses, owned, of course,
by a single company, and is strictly profit oriented. An
interesting point is that most of these businesses were
not started from the ground up by Westinghouse, as was
done in the days of George Westinghouse, but instead
were bought after already being operational and
profitable businesses that were in need of big business
capital.

These "stand alone" businesses include the
beverage group (which owms the nation's largest 7-UP
bottler among others), Thermo King Corp. (an over-the-
road refrigeration division), an elevator unit (which
recently underwent a plant closing and a joint venture
with Korea's Hyundai Group involving moving some of
the division overseas), a manufacturer of printed circuit
board materials used for computers, and many divisions
that change hands frequently and rapidly, so much that
keeping track of them is almost impossible. The
Commercial Group involves extremely active buying and
selling of businesses, and although the company had
made many profitable transactions, a few major poor
decisions have taken place. One example in particular is
the purchase and selling of it's cable TV venture.

In 1981 $646 million was put into puying
Teleprompter Corp., a cable TV company. Along with
high hopes, the programming group was renamed Group
W, and $2 billion were expected to be put into it within
the next three years. As this appeared to be an
enormous investment on Westinghouse's part, doubts
were raised on whether or not the profits would or could
justify the initial cost, even considering the obvious
promise of the cable industry.

Westinghouse sold the cable unit in January of
1986, as $1.6 billion and the assumption of about $500
million in tax and other liabilities was paid for it by a group
of investors consisting of Tele-Communication, lnc.,

26

Time lnc.‘s American Television and Communication
Corp., and three other cable companies. This
transaction followed successive losses in the cable
industry for Westinghouse, such as the Satellite News
Channel (a 24 hour news show owned jointly with
American Broadcasting Cos.which folded in October
1983, handing a loss of $20 million to Westinghouse),
the selling of 50% of its interest in Showtime movie
channel, and the bailing out of a family cable channel (a
Walt Disney Production ). The total loss in the cable and
programming business just in 1983 was $50 million.

Industries and International

Responsible for the engineering and manufacture
of indutrial equipment, transformers, gas turbines, etc.,
this group has been through some rough roads recently,
including losses in 1983 and 1984, after earning 25% of
the company's operating profit in 1981 .

Needless to say, many of Danforth's 6% cut of
Westinghouse employees since he assumed chainnan
have been through this division. A 45% joint venture
was formed out of its semiconductor works, the industrial
equipment division in Sykesville, Md. was removed from
service, its medium motor business was sold to Reliant
Electric, and its small motor divsion went to A.O. Smith,
along with its 42 nationwide repair shops. In fact, the
only factory left of its once-cornerstone Motor Division is
in Round Rock, Texas, and even this factory only
produces individually engineered industrial motors.

With the help of these sales, the division's earnings
have helped it to climb back into profit in the past two
years, while Danforth is acting on its future. His efforts to
reciuce labor costs in particular are quite interesting. First
of all, he has reduced the number of unionized
employees to less than 50%, down from 1950"s level of
67%. Secondly, he advocates the taking over of small
businesses in the South, where unions are less likely to
form. And thirdly, he is high on taking advantage of low-
cost, high skilled labor in other countries, such as as the
marketing of some gas and steam turbines in Canada,
the manufacture of some transmission and distribution
gear components in Brazil, and other manufacturing
done in Asia.

Quality problems and a new money making
philosophy that seems to decrease the importance of a
company with morals and stability - these are problems
that must be upsetting for Westinghouse employees.
So then, how can Mr. Danforth justify his actions? Simply
put, he is making profits. However, the analysis of the
stockholder share is a key issue.

In this analysis, one must note not only the earnings
and the increase of earnings but the future for earnings.
In figure 1, one can see that Danforth is definitely
increasing the value of the stockholder. This has been
his motive since he took his present position. But a
good investor will look for factors in a company's stock
that may not seem important now, but might be in the
future. He will examine the "quality of the earnings".

The writer now would like to acknowledge an article
from a July 2, 1984 issue of Barron's, a business

magazine. The author of this article analyzed this
important aspect of Westinghouse portfolio in the article,
"Quality of Earnings: The Key to Successful Investing".

Each share in 1982 underwent an increase of $5.16
and $5.08 in 1983 (certainly a nice profit). However,
much of this profit was "softened" by what is known as
non-recurring items, such as the sale of divisions and
property. These transactions provide large amounts of
‘pure’ profit to the company and look good on paper, but
won't be able to provide money to the company
anymore. (Example: If I sell my car, I'd be a few thousand
dollars richer, but I wouldn't have anything to drive).

The following is an outline of the 1983 earnings per
share due to these non-recurring items:

What should it mean to you?

Westinghouse has made record profits recently, but
at what cost?

Seemingly, money has taken a front seat to stability
and morality, two factors that this writer feels must be
present in order for a company to expect a 100%
performance from its employees.

Before you choose a company to start your career,
look around.

(At the end of last year, Douglas Danforth retired to
his llama farm outside Pittsburgh. His successor is John
Marous, who is expected to carry on Danforth's policy of
concentration on only the money-making divisions. The
Westinghouse board of director's chose Marous over
another competitor, Thomas Murrin. If chosen as
chairman, Murrin was expected to have moved the
company more vigorously into the advanced
technologies area. Reportedly, Murrin's and Danforth's
personalities did not mix well.)

5) ‘BaCI+Heat-> Ba+CI'

6) Ba+Heat-> Ba+2+2e’

As you can see we are trying to accomplish the
formation of Barium monochloride(BaCl), a good

rnonochloride breaks down to neutral barium, then it
ionizes and this you will recall produces white light. One
solution would be to not let the flame temperature get
too high. But this results in low output light sources.
Another solution is to introduce free electrons.
According to Le ChateIier's principle the introduction of

producer of green light (equations 1&2). in this case the
oxidizer is the source of BaCl. If the oxidizer we used did
not contain BaCl we would have to add additional
molecules that contain chlorine atoms. Part of the
oxidizers energy would go to liberating the chlorine from
these additional molecules, and not to exciting BaCl
electrons and thus the flame would not be as intense. A
solution is to use an oxidizer that will provide chlorine as
well as heat. Some other examples of these oxidizers
are: KCIO4, KCIO3, and NH4(C|O4).

Remember that high temperatures increase light
output, but look what happens when flame temperatures
become too high (equation 5&6). The barium

 

a metal with a lower ionization energy than barium will act
to supress the tendency of barium to ionize. This again
could be accomplished by adding a new molecule to the
formula but there is no need because again an oxidizer
can provide the necessary electrons. Take for example
the potassium in KCIO4, and KCIO3, notice it has a lower
ionization energy than barium(referto table 3).
Let's review:

1) Light is composed of photons.

2) Color is related to the energy of the photon.

3) Excited electrons emit a photon when they drop back
to the back to ground state.

4) Each molecule has specific energy levels to which its
electrons are excited. Therefore each molecule has a
characteristic color when photons are emitted.

5) The production of ions and the effect of
incandesence is undesirable in a colored flame
because they produce white light which washes out
the color.

6) The production of heat, color producing molecules,
and ions can be controlled in a colored flame using Le
Chatelier's principle.

With this understanding of the mechanisms
producing colored flame we can begin to design our own
formulations. in my next article I will show you how to do
just this.

Tfie C c1pita[i.st 9i/fanifesto

by Sanjiv Gupta

It's that time of year again. Time to wonder exactly
why you are here. Why are you torturing yourself so,
when you could be leaping off tall buildings with nothing
but a bungee cord between lots of fun and certain
death? Or perhaps laying on a warm beach somewhere
with a gorgeous member of the opposite sex lowering
grapes into your mouth... Or maybe just sleeping...

There are so many questions, and so few answers.
What possessed me to come to Pitt? Why on Earth did I
choose engineering as a major? What the hell is a
convolution integral? who cares? when is the test?
Why don't my TAs speak any English? when is dinner?
Where did I put my toothpaste?

Things look pretty bleak, don't they? They should.
Remember, it's only going to get worse. The only thing
you have to look forward to is another term. If you're
really lucky you may get to go home for a while and argue
with your parents. Otherwise, you'll just have to settle for
arguing with them over the faulty, useless campus
telephone system. It really is a Campus Without a Future.

But all is not lost... Your problems can be solved by
dropping out of college now, before it's too late. Just
think: people with easy majors get to have fun after
classes, instead of staring at endless mounds of
homework like you do, and people with no major at all get
to have fun all of the time. I know, you think that you'll
have to get a job, but it just isn't so. Anyone can make a
million dollars in America without really trying. The key is
remembering that the public will buy anything, no matter
how useless, if it looks interesting. As you sit there
pulling out your hair over the forces on some stupid
beam, or the current through a stupid diode, or
whatever, just remember that someone made a fortune
by selling Pet Rocks. As you stare at another plate of
gruesome cafeteria slop, keep in mind that someone
became rich by selling Slime. As your tortured little brain
slowly grinds towards catastrophic failure the night
before a big final, try to recall that somewhere some
dumb sod is relaxing with the millions he made by selling
erasers shaped like little animals.

It's true: you too can make a million dollars. Face it,
as an engineer you'll work from 9 to 5 for the rest of your
life designing high-tech toilet paper dispensers and
whatnot, and never earn more than $50,000 a year! But
with a little bit of ingenuity, you can be rich before you're
thirty at the expense of countless other worthless
people who are just like you once were: poor and
miserable. It's a wonderful vision, isn't it?

Okay, let's get started.

The first part is the hardest. You've got to come up
with an idea - something to sell. Most of the really the
good ideas have been taken already, but there are still
plenty of idiots out there willing to empty their pockets
over something so utterly useless that even Chuck and
Di seem meaningful in comparison. So think hard. As an
example, consider Pet Dirt (remember, this is only an
example - if you try to sell Pet Dirt, we'll see to it that you
never walk again). Pet Dirt is free to produce, until your
neighbor catches you digging up his lawn, and very
inexpensive to package. It needs to be taken care of, so
the people who buy it will feel that its worth something,
even though it doesn't do a damn thing (why do people
buy hermit crabs? They never move either, but people
feel good because they have to feed them). If you don't
water your Pet Dirt regularly, after all, it turns into Pet
Dust. Pet Dirt can be used as a habitat for Pet Rocks, or
even hermit crabs. It can be used to bury small, bratty
children, or suffocate obnoxious relatives. it. is ideal for
pouring into your enemy's gas tank, or throwing at your
favorite professor the day before you quit school. These
are all terrible excuses that people can use to justify their
purchase of a bag of dirt. So, the second step is
advertising to make the public aware of what they can do
with your product. Buying ads may be expensive, but
you'll recover your loss in no time. Advertising costs can
be minimized by advertising in the right places first, for
once it catches on with a particularly gullible group of
consumers, other people will hear about it through word
of mouth. Tell someone in a sorority about your product
and the whole campus will know about it within days.

The third step is production and delivery.
Depending on the product, this can be very expensive,
or virtually free. For pet dirt, the expenses associated
with this phase are minimal. Futhermore, you can spend
the whole week goofing off, and use the weekend to
package dirt. And then, after the profits start to pour in,
you can hire some other petty scumbag to do the dirty
work. Before you know it, you've made your million.

Now, wasn't that easy? _

So put away that differential equation and start
thinking. Soon you'll be a millionaire, and you can hang
around outside Benedum Hall with your Ferrari and laugh
at all the miserable, pathetic, hopeless wretches heaving
their bodies up the endless stairs towards another day of
torture.

I'll say no more, for I have said all that I wanted to say.
Besides, you've already wasted enough time reading
this, so get back to work or else you'll fail.

: Magnetic Resonarnc imaging :

Let us spin your protons

by Mark M. Belz

Modern medicine is an area of constant excitement
and often of miraculous breakthroughs. Although
medicine relies on the skills of its physicians, new
techniques are providing them with tools of
incomparable worth in saving and improving the lives of
their patients. They are frequently able to operate with
increased confidence.

One of these revolutionary techniques, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), uses the magnetic properties
of atoms to detect differences in tissue content.
Powerful supercooled magnets are used to align these
atoms, and with the aid of a computer, the data can be
formed into images which help to identify cancer, tumors,
cardiovascular disease, and many other disorders
without exposing the patient to substantial danger or
discomfort. Unlike many techniques, MRI uses no X-
rays; the only risks are from exposure to a very strong
magnetic field (about 60,000 times as strong as the
earth's magnetic field). In fact, although long-term side
effects are as yet unknown, no short-term side effects
have ever been detected.

In 1974 some of the pioneering work in magnetic
resonance imaging was performed. At University
Hospital in Nottingham, England, Professor Brian S.
Worthington, working with a tiny magnet, first examined
an onion with a tiny magnet and saw its inner rings.
There was great concern about the effects of a strong
magnetic field on humans, but in 1977 a human wrist was
scanned with MRI. Since this obviously did not alleviate
the fear of an MRI scan wreaking havoc with the brain, it
was another two years until a scientist allowed his brain to
be scanned. The potential of MRI has only been
recognized since 1980, and some 400 scanners are
today operating in the United States alone.‘

Initially called nuclear magnetic resonance, this
technique was renamed magnetic resonance to remove
the implication that X-ray radiation is involved. In fact,
even in the absence of such radiation, MRI provides
images that are often superiorto images involving X-rays.

Due to their abundance in bodily tissue, the atoms

most often used in MRI are those of hydrogen, ‘H, and
phosphorus, 31 P. The nuclei of these atoms each have

a spin of one half and thus, as a positively charged
sphere, create a magnetic field. Each has a magnetic
moment, u. An externally applied magnetic field will
rotate this magnetic moment in the direction of the
magnetic field. This causes the nuclei to undergo two
rotations which are at right angles to each other: one as
the spin of each nucleus, and the other as the spin of the
magnetic moment towards the direction of the externally
applied magnetic field. The resultant motion of these
two rotations is the precession of the magnetic moment
in the direction of the magnetic field. Larmor frequency
(fL) (the frequency of precession) is given by the
equation fL=kB where k is a constant and B0 is the
strength of the magnetic field acting at the nucleus (k
differs for different nuclei). Thus fL is directly
proportional to the strength of the externally applied
magnetic field. The Larmor frequencies of identical
nuclei in the same magnetic field are thus equal?

There are two energy levels for nuclei with a spin of
one half in a magnetic field. The higher energy level
contains those nuclei with their magnetic moments
opposed to the magnetic field, and the lower contains
those nuclei with magnetic moments not opposed to the
magnetic field. When the nuclei in a sample distribute
themselves between these two energy levels, slightly
more nuclei will settle in the lower energy level than in
the higher energy level. The magnetic moments of
these nuclei form two cones, one for each energy level.
A radiofrequency coil is used to excite the nuclei and a
detector coil is used to detect their resonance. Two
effects occur at resonance: some nuclei in the lower
energy level are excited and move to the higher energy
level, and the oscillating field from the radiofrequency
coil causes the magnetic moments to collect on one side
of the cones. Following resonance, the magnetic
moments must return to their normal room temperature
distributions; that is, the excess nuclei in the higher
energy level must return to the lower energy level and
the assymetrically distributed magnetic moments must
return to a uniform distribution. These transitions occur
in two relaxation times: T1 (the spin—lattice or longitudinal
relaxation time), for the return of the excess higher
energy level nuclei to the lower energy level, and T2 (the
spin-spin or transverse relaxation time), for the
redistribution of magnetic moments around the cones. A
Lorenztian peak centered on the frequency fL describes
the resonance of identical nuclei; the measured
parameters are the frequency, area, and width at half

 

maximum height of the resonance peak.3

The frequency is determined by the magnetic field
acting at the nucleus. The peak area indicates the
number of nuclei producing the peak and can thus give a
quantitative measure of the concentrations or changes in
concentration of different metabolites. The width of the
peak at half maximum height is given by Av1,2=1/1cT2. T2
is determined by the level of magnetic noise at the
Larmor frequency coming largely from magnetic fields
generated by the motions of the molecules containing
the nuclei and the motions of nearby molecules. This
leads to the result that sharper resonance is achieved
with more mobile molecules, since the intensity of the
signal within a narrow waveband is determined by the
mobility of the molecule containing the nuclei. This
result is important to MRI, since more mobile molecules

to moving nuclei, TE is the time between the
radiofrequency pulse and the reception of the signal
(pulse sequence), and TR is the repetition rate between
successive spin-echo sequences.5):

1. The quantity of free hydrogen - bone, having little
free hydrogen, appears black (small signal), where fat,
having a great deal of free hydrogen, appears white
(large signal).

2. Movement within an imaged tissue - rapidly
flowing blood causes a decrease in the signal.

3. T1 relaxation time - the hydrogen nuclei of water
are free and thus have a longer T1 than fat.

4. T2 relaxation time - T2 is longer in pure fluids than
it is in body tissues and protein rich fluids, since the
nuclei in pure fluids remain synchronous far longer.

A technlclan examining a bull heart on a magnetic resonance lmager (Pittsburgh NMR lnstltute).

would cause sharper resonance and easier resolution.
MRI using protons (hydrogen nuclei) produces good
images due to the abundance and high mobility of water
molecules in biological tissues.‘

With this basic background, it is evident that, when
hydrogen is used, there are four factors which affect the
magnetic resonance signal (for spin-echo imaging, a
common technique, the equation for signal amplitude is
S=Nf(v)(e'TE/T2)(1-e'TFVT1), where N is the
concentration of nuclei, f(v) is the signal modulation due

Additionally, the pulse sequence, or the time
between pulse delivery and detection, can affect the
value of T1 and T2; a part of the body is often imaged
twice, with two different pulse sequences (one
weighting T1 and T2), in order to maximize information.
Thus, the great strength of MRI is in showing soft tissue
contrast and thus distinguishing between normal and
abnormal tissue.5

In an ideal situation, the best way to produce an
image would be to vary the magnetic field at each

The Physics and Chemistry of the
Fireworks

Flame

by Matthew Palaszynski

Everybody loves fireworks, but did you ever wonder
what they really are or how they are actually made? Well I
certainly did. What exactly are those big showers of color
you see in the professional displays? Are they really
rockets like the newspapers always describe them?

It turns out that fireworks are not rockets but rather
cardboard canisters filled with little pellets called stars.
These canisters are shot out of steel mortars and a timing
fuse, which has been burning since the shell left the
mortar, ignites the stars and an explosive charge within
the shell. The burning pellets are propelled outward by
the charge and the familiar fireworks flower is created.

I remember reading this information in a Popular
Mechanics magazine as a young man. But I wanted to
know more about how they are made, what their chemical
formulas are, and where one could buy the needed
materials.

Every aspiring pyrotechnist learns how to make
gunpowder. A few years ago I found this formula for
gunpowder in an encyclopedia:

5 parts saltpeter

1 part charcoal

1 part sulfur

The pharmacist at the local drug store knew exactly
what I was going to do with that sulfur! The gunpowder
burned, but never really like it was supposed to. I fooled
around with differem formulas for the next couple of
years but I didn't really know what I was doing. Then I
learned of the Pyrotechnics Guild International (PGI).
This is an organization of amateur pyrotechnists who
study and build fireworks as a hobby. I have been a
member of the PG! for two years and have learned a great
deal about the fundamentals of fireworks. In this article I
will introduce the theory behind these fundamentals,
and in future articles chronicle my attempts to use this
theory to develop more effective pyrotechnic devices.

The first topic I would like to tackle is the theory of
colored flame. This theory will be useful in designing
stars of higher color quality, which can then be used in
shells like the ones described in the introduction (Much
of the following article will be a summary of Dr. Ken
Kosanke's article on the physics, chemistry, and

perception of colored flame, published in Pyrotechnia,
Occasional Papers in Pyrotechnics VII & IX).

In discussing colored flame an appropriate starting
point is with a definition of light. The modern theory of
light defines light as being comprised of small packets of
energy called "photons." Photons have discrete
frequencies and wavelengths and carry proportional
amounts of energy. This relationship is defined by the
following equation:

E=hv=h/7l.c

where: E=energy, h=Plank's
}.=waveIength, v=frequency and c=speed of light.

The color of light that photons produce is
determined by the frequency of the photon and, by the
above relationship, is related directly to the energy of the
photon.

A photon is produced when an electron of an atom
which has been excited drops back to its ground state. If
we think back to freshman chemistry class we recall that
electrons can only occupy certain orbital levels which
correspond to distinct energy levels. If energy is
supplied to an atom that is not sufficient to raise the
electron to its first excited state nothing will come of this
energy. Dr. Kosanke uses a very good analogy. You can
stand on any rung of a latter you wish, but you can not
stand half way between two rungs. If you try, you will fall
to the next lower rung. This is why certain atoms
produce certain colored light when excited. If energy
states were not quantized the energy of a photon would
depend on the amount of energy received by the atom
rather than the atom itself. Therefore every atom would
be capable of producing photons of every energy
(color). This is not the case, so pyrotechnicts search for
atoms and molecules that emit photons at specific
energy levels and therefore specific colors.

If enough energy is supplied to an atom it is possible
for the electron to exceed all of the bound energy levels
and escape the atom completely. This energy is called
the ionization energy. Once the electron reaches the
ionization energy it is no longer quantized and can take
on an infinite number of energy levels. when the ion is
recombined with the atom it does not give off a photon of

constant,

of random energy. The result of many ions emitting
photons is that of a random distribution of photon
energies. This is the definition of white light. Therefore
if ions are present in a fireworks flame they tend to wash
the colorout.

Another detrimential effect to the production of
pure colors is incandescence. This is when an object
made up of many different atoms is heated and gives off
different photons, each of which is characteristic of the
various atoms of which the object is comprised, the
result is a random distribution of photon energies,
producing white light.

So we have seen that atoms and molecules emit
photons at characteristic energy levels. Much work has
been done in determining the specific values for these
energy levels. The method used is called spectroscopy;
the result of spectroscopy is a line spectra. Aline spectra
is essentially a graph representing the energy levels at
which a particular molecule or atom will emit photons.
Using this readily available information pyrotechnists can
search out molecules that will produce the desired
photon energies. Thus we can create a menu of color
producing molecules. (see table 1)

We now need to find chemicals that will produce the
needed energy to excite the electrons. My first attempts
at producing a colored flame failed miserably. I had a
suitable color producer, but the heat producing
chemicals I chose just couldn't provide the necessary
energy to excite the electrons. The formulation
consisted of:

5 parts Potassium Nitrate (KNO3)

1part Charcoal

1 part Barium Chlorate(BaClO3)

In this formula the Potassium Nitrate acted as the
oxidizer and the charcoal as the fuel. These two
reactants are capable of producing heat once the
reaction is started. Charcoal is not the ideal fuel in a color

formulation because its particles incandensce. Combine
this with the very low heat energy produced by the
potassium nitrate and the result is a very weak color. The
search was on for a better combination of chemicals to
act as a heat energy producer.

Through the literature published by the PGI I soon
found chemicals that were much better suited to
producing the energy necessary to generate color.
Related directly to the energy released by these energy
producers (oxidizers) is the flame temperature they
produce. It is desirable to have as large a flame
temperature as possible. A higher flame temperature is
capable of exciting a larger number of electrons and
therefore produces a more intensely colored flame. (see
table 2)

There is one more aspect to producing flame to be
discussed. The color producing agents in a fireworks
flame are rarely available in chemical form. It is usually
easier to constmct the color producing molecule within
the flame itself than to produce the color generating
molecule in a test tube and then add it to the fomwulaticn.

To proceed to the next step you will again have to
think back to freshmen chemistry class. A color fireworks
composition essentially consists of a homogenous
mixture of chemicals. Some chemicals will combine to

 

produce heat, others will combine to produce the color
generating molecule. But the order and extent that
these chemicals combine must be controlled. To do this
we apply Le Chatelier's principle. Recall it states that by
applying stresses in the desired direction you can
influence the direction of the. reaction. Now would be a
good time to introduce a specific example. The following
formulation produces a green flame:

10 parts Barium Chlorate(Ba(ClO3)2

2 parts Shellac

The following set of equations represents the
formation of the desired color producing molecule, and
its emissiom of a photon. Where (') represents a free
electron. This type of molecule is called _a free radical,
and ( ) represents an excited radical

1) Ba(ClO3)2 + Heat -> BaCl2 + 302

2) BaCl2 + Heat -> 'BaCL+ Cl‘

3) 'BaCI. + Heat -> 'BaCl

4) 'BaCl ->'BaCI+photon
