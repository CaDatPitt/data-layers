doctorate degrees. Three of these were
engineers. They were Dr. George S.
Dively, Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of the Harris-
Intertype Corporation; Dr. Chester G.
Fisher, founder of the Fisher Scientiﬁc
Corporation; and Dr. Blaine B. Wes-
cott, formerly vice—president and di-
rector of the Gulf Research and De-
velopment Corporation.

A complete and up—to—date survey
of the positions held by the engineering
alumni is essentially impossible to com-
pile, because individually they are con-
stantly moving upwards to new posi-
tions. However, one attempt was made
about four years ago to evaluate the
status of about 2000 alumni on which
data were available. This survey indi-
cated that of this group four were
corporate board chairmen, forty—ﬁve
were presidents of companies, sixty-
two vice presidents, and seventy—four
were owners of their own companies.
Eighty-four were general managers and
ninety—ﬁve were assistant general man-
agers or superintendents. One hun-
dred forty-nine were chief engineers,
seventy—six were division heads, and
forty-three were sales managers. Also,
t\venty—seven were directors of indus-
trial research laboratories and several
hundred were engaged in research
work. More than ninety—six per cent
have retained their interest in engineer-
ing and were following it as their life’s
work. Five engineering alumni are
currently members of the University’s
Board of Trustees. Such a record
should be more than reassuring to
those now in school in anticipation of
pursuing a career in engineering. This
is the level from which the acceleration
started and the alumni are to be com-
mended for their attainments follow-
ing graduation.

The faculty, in particular, are to be
congratulated for keeping their eyes on
the road, and their feet on the acceler-
ator. Their loyalty in remaining on
the job over such a long period of
essentially a “boot—strap” operation
must be commended and a review of
some of their accomplishmnets is in
order at this time.

Partly because of the attainments of
the alumni and also in recognition of
the level of engineering education being

offered here, three hundred and sixty-
ﬁve companies came to the campus to
recruit seniors last year. Only forty-
nine, most of which were department
stores and insurance companies, were
not recruiting engineers.

In recent years, more and more in-
dustries have surveyed their scholarship
programs and have reduced their grants
to a few colleges from which they be-
lieve they are obtaining the best engi-
neers. As a result, the Schools of
Engineering and Mines have almost in-
variably been in the preferred group.
For example, Pitt is among a group
of thirty—ﬁve of the one hundred and
sixty engineering schools in the country
to be honored by the Union Carbide
Corporation to receive four complete
four—year scholarships.

Also, at the graduate level, Pitt is
among a group of forty—two engineering
colleges to be selected by the Ford
Foundation to receive forgivable loans
to engineering teachers for graduate
study.

In recognition of their graduate pro-
grams, the National Science Founda-
tion has recently made grants to three
departments for the development of
doctoral and faculty research labora-
tories. The International Nickel Com-
pany has also made a grant to a fourth
department for this purpose.

The Atomic Energy Commission has
also granted some $216,000 for equip-
ment to be used in graduate instruc-
tion. This has been of considerable
assistance to several of the departments.

In a recent fund—raising drive, head-
ed by Dr. E. R. Weidlein (trustee),
many of the top executives of this and
other areas expressed their knowledge
of, and appreciation for the excellence
of the engineering program on this
campus. In the past several years,
there has been an increase in the gradu-
ate enrollment so that nearly one hun-
dred full—time students are currently on
the campus. In addition, about three
hundred are attending graduate classes
part—time. These are graduates of
eighty—ﬁve colleges and universities.

Engineering research has also in-
creased in recent years. During the
past eleven years some two and one-
half million dollars in contracted gov-
ernmental and industrial research has
been processed. None of these grants
would have been made without the

continuous efforts of the faculty. These
grants have contributed to the growth
of the programs and to the need for
new facilities.

Last, but certainly not the least,
mention should be made of the assist-
ance and enthusiastic cooperation of
the undergraduate students themselves
in the acceleration which has been tak-
ing place. The increasing level of their
attainments on this campus have been
most interesting to observe. The en-
rollment has grown during the past
eleven years so that the engineers now
constitute nearly one—fourth of the stu-
dents on the campus. Last year, forty-
seven per cent of all the men entering
the University were engineers.

Eleven years ago, the academic level
of the entering freshmen was such that
sixty per cent were in the upper two-
ﬁfths of their respective high school
classes. Last year, sixty-four per cent
were in the ﬁrst—ﬁfth and ninety—one
in the ﬁrst two, but with none in the
lower two—ﬁfths.

The extent to which scholastic -

achievements have accelerated was
illustrated last year when the engineers
dcninated in the campus awards for
scholarship. William Hosick, a metal-
lurgical engineering student, graduated
with a 3.98 QPA, having received but
one B grade in his entire program. He
was sglected as the University’s “Mr.
Pitt.”

Richard Johnston was the ODK
“M;m—of—the—Year” and his QPA was
3.80. Richard Johnston and William
I-losick completed the requirements for
both the B.A. degree in Liberal Arts
and the B.S. degree in Engineering.
Both were elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

Edward F. Kondis was named the
University’s “Distinguished Scholar” at
the Spring Convocation. He was the
ﬁrst person to graduate from engineer-
ing with a straight “A” average for the
four years. All three of these students
are continuing in graduate work to-
ward their doctorates here and at other
schools.

These are just a few of the records
of achievement made by the students,
alumni, and faculty, but they are sulﬁ-
cient to show that the Schools of Engi-
neering and Mines are more than pre-
pared to shift into a new high gear
requiring the new facilities. Congratu-
lations are in order to all!

dr. heroes to spend year with du pont

The engineering students extend their congratulations to Dr. Beroes, Associate Professor of

Chemical Engineering, for having been chosen to participate in the

Du Pont “Year in Industry” program.

DR. CHARLES S. BEROES, Associate
Professor of Chemical Engineering in
the Schools of Engineering and Mines
at the University of Pittsburgh, has
been invited to join a select group of
engineering educators in the Du Pont
“Year in Industry” program.

Beginning in September, 1963, Dr.
Beroes will spend a year observing all
the activities of the engineering depart-
ment of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &
Company. The company will pay his
salary and all expenses connected with
the program, including those of moving
to Wilmington, Delaware.

Du Pont set up the program in 1951 n

to help educators see the philosophy,
principles and practices of engineering
as applied by a large corporation. After
a year in industry, the professor will
be better equipped to handle teaching
and campus counseling assignments.

Dr. Beroes received a bachelor of
science degree in chemical engineering
at Pitt in 1949. He also received his
master’s degree in 1950 and the Ph.D.,
1957, from Pitt. He has worked with
U. S. Steel Corporation, Westinghouse
Electric Corporation and Harbison
Walker.

Non-academically Dr. Beroes is also
active. The positions he has held in-
clude the following: Department Ad-
ministrative Assistant; Chairman of
the Registration Advice Committee,
Pennsylvania Society for Professional
Engineers; Member of the Executive
Committee, University of Pittsburgh
Engineering Alumni Association;
Chairman of the Properties Committee,
Pittsburgh Section, A. I. Ch. E.

He is an active and honored member

Dr. Charles S. Beroes

of the community. He is an honorary
member of ODK and an honorary
member of Druids. He has served his
community as solicitor for the United
Fund and as a member of the Execu-
tive Board of the Pitt Y.M.C.A.

Dr. Beroes’ special ﬁelds of interest
are pure metals, power generation, and

data analysis. At the present time, he
is writing a text on data analysis. Dr.
Beroes is known to many chemical
engineering students because he has
taught Experimental Design & Data
Analysis, Thermodynamics, and Engi-
neering Fundamentals. Dr. Beroes lives
in the Oakland district of Pittsburgh.

     
        
    
 
 
  

THE GROVVT H OF ORIENTED SINGLE CRYSTALS OF PURE IRON

To understand the basic nature of metals, it is often desirable to use single crystals of carefully controlled
orientation. By using a single crystal, many properties which are crystallographically dependent can be '7
investigated. , ,-
Metallurgical students in particular will ﬁnd the article by Gabriel F. Pittinato and Robert H. Thomas of .
special interest. Their composition was originally submitted as a thesis and has now been adapted for
publication in the next SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER. 2»
The authors relate in an easily understandable manner the procedures they employed in the prepa-
ration of single cube-oriented crystals of Ferrovac E iron. They begin with their reason for
selecting the Strain-Anneal method and an analysis of the starting materials. Successively dis-7; .
cussed are sample preparation and the construction of a special furnace needed to obtain a
high temperature gradient. The actual orientation and growth procedures are dealt with in
greater detail followed by a summary of the results and conclusions. "-

THE RESCUE OF ABU SIMBEL
Thirty-three hundred years ago, Ramses II made his bid for immortality in
the pink sandstone cliffs of lower Egypt. The two grandiose temples he had
carved at Abu Simbel were eventually covered by the shifting sands and for-
gotten for thousands of years till their discovery by a Swedish explorer in 1805.
Now, after a relatively short period of examination and restoration, these master-
pieces of ancient Egyptian architecture face the peril of being inundated forever by
the rising waters of the Nile. The new high darn, Sadd el Aali, is now being constructed
at Aswan by the United Arab Republic with Soviet aid. The new dam will contain the
river above that point and form a giant reservoir which will ﬂood the Nubian Valley in
Egypt and the Sudan.

To save the Abu Simbel temples, the United Nations Education, Scientiﬁc and Cultural. Organ-
ization (UNESCO) has undertaken a world-wide campaign to ﬁnance a bold, but feasible, plan to
raise the temples to a safe level. The details of this plan, plus a brief history and description of the
temples, are the subjects of an extensively illustrated article which will be presented by Ralph Smith
of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER Staff. The magnitude-of this project, which proposes to raise a singu-
lar, fragile mass of a quarter of a million tons a height of two hundred feet on more than three hundred
massive jacks, will captivate the interest of engineering students from every department.

Functions of this type were named in honor of Friedrich
Wilhelm Bessel (1784-1846), a German astronomer who
was responsible for the development of a number of their
more useful properties. Bessel, however, cannot be given
credit for the actual origin of these functions, for at least
ﬁve men before him encountered special forms of the
equations.

Probably the ﬁrst person ever to work with a Bessel
function was James Bernoulli (1654-1705). Bernoulli
was a Swiss mathematician who mastered calculus with-
out the aid of a teacher and went on from there to originate
many important concepts in the ﬁeld of mathematics. In
the course of his experimentation with physical systems,
he encountered a new function. Since, however, he did
not see any tremendous importance attached to the func-
tion, he put it aside in favor of more important physical
phenomena and mathematical formulae. Years later,
this expression was to be resurrected as a Bessel function
of order 1/3.

In 1732, Daniel Bernoulli, a nephew of James Bernoulli,
encountered another new function as a result of his ex-
perimentation with a heavy ﬂexible chain. The upper end
of the chain was ﬁxed, but the lower end was allowed to
hang free. When slightly disturbed from its position of
equilibrium, the chain oscillated in a manner which could
not be accurately described by any existing mathematical
expression. Bernoulli set to work on the problem, and
soon he was able to describe the oscillation by an equa-
tion which bore some similarity to the one developed
earlier by his uncle. Though Bernoulli could not possibly
have known it, the function which he had derived was
a Bessel function of order zero.

In 1764, Leonhard Euler developed Bessel functions
which were in a more general form. These were the out-
come of his experiments with the vibrations of a stretched
membrane. The same functions were encountered by
Joseph Lagrange in 1771 as he worked with the elliptic
motion of celestial bodies.

Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician, proposed a

problem in 1822 which involved another Bessel equation.

made to the theory of numbers in the twentieth century.

Though it is true that Bessel functions have some mod-
ern applications in mathematical theory, their major im-
portance still lies in the ﬁeld in which they were originated
—applied physical mathematics. This is the respect in
which they apply to the engineer, and the respect in which
they will be treated here.

A major application of Bessel functions lies in the ﬁeld
of electricity. The functions apply themselves well to the
problems of potential distribution. Also, by simple trans-
lation of the terms involved, the same functions can be
used in the description of the ﬂow of heat; the two are
analogous in many ways. Another electrical application
lies in the propagation of electromagnetic waves along
wires. Here the functions are used in dealing with oscil-
lations and the dilfusions of electrical current.

Closely akin to the ﬁeld of electricity is the ﬁeld of
light, where Bessel functions are used quite extensively
in dealing with diffraction and related phenomena.

Hydrodynamics has also found several applications for
Bessel functions. They are used in expressing ﬂuid mo-
tion in coaxial planes and the oscillations of a cylindrical
vortex about a state of steady motion. Wave motion in
a cylindrical tank can also be described by Bessel func-
tions. Likewise, the functions can be used to describe
the oscillations of a heavy liquid contained in a circular
basin which rotates with uniform angular velocity.

The functions are still used, of course, as they were
originally used by Bessel: for the calculation of per-
turbations in an elliptical path wherever the need for such
a calculation might arise in astronomy or other branches
of science. Other miscellaneous applications for Bessel
functions include the calculation of equilibrium of an
isotopic elastic rod, surface traction for a circular cyl-
inder, variable ﬂow of heat in a solid sphere, torsional
vibrations of a solid circular cylinder, oscillations of a
chain of variable density, and the behavior of tidal waves
in an estuary.

Considering these and many other applications, the full
explanation of which would unquestionably ﬁll a dozen
magazines of this size, it is only reasonable to conclude
that Bessel functions are not only handy, but in many cases
vitally necessary to our modern level of engineering prac-
tice and research.

bessel function

temperature at any point in the cylinder is a function of
the distance of that point from the axis. Then the cyl-
inder is placed in a medium which has a temperature of
zero degrees. The problem is to ﬁnd the distribution of
heat in the cylinder after an increment of time has elapsed.
The analysis of this problem led Fourier to an expression
substantially similar to the one formed by Bernoulli.

Two years later, Friedrich Bessel discovered an appli-
cation in astronomy for equations of this type. This was
the age when astronomy was just getting its start, and
astronomers were beginning to form charts and tables
of the movements of the heavenly bodies. Bessel hap-
pened to be dealing with a perturbative function in the
elliptical motion of certain bodies when he discovered that
he needed a function similar to those developed by Fourier
and Euler. He found, however, that the functions which
they had developed were not general enough for his pur-
poses. This led to the development of more general forms
and the discovery of more useful properties of the func-
tions. Thus they came into recognition and popular use
in the ﬁelds of physical science and mathematics. Be-
cause Bessel was directly responsible for unifying and
reﬁning the functions, they took on his name.

After the Bessel functions were developed for use in
the evaluation of astronomical data, they were seized by
mathematicians whose purpose in analyzing them was
purely mathematical. Thus, there was an abrupt change
from the purely applied to the purely abstract pursuit of
the functions. Mathematicians would undoubtedly never
have worked with a function of this sort if it had not been
for the discovery of the function in a rather haphazard
manner in physical science. Analysts who have consid-
ered the form of the functions are quick to notice that
no mathematician in his right mind would ever have
dreamed of anything so mathematically uncouth as these
expressions; if by chance he had, he would have been
quick to dismiss the thought as a horrible nightmare.
Eighteenth century mathematicians who worked with
Bessel functions did so because they were prompted by
the physical occurrence of the expressions, not because
they thought that they looked pretty on paper or were
easy to evaluate. These men could not possibly have fore-
seen the theoretical applications that Bessel functions have

The modern engineer in his everyday research is confronted with a number of mathematical

complications that are not easily solved by conventional methods. One of these problems,

the Bessel Function, can be solved by the method of Frobe11ius. . . . . . . by John Choma.

Through the years, a nearly inﬁnite variety of physical
problems has arisen in modern engineering, physics, and
mathematics. As the student engineer soon realizes to his
dismay, some of the more complex of these problems can-
not be solved by what he would call “ordinary” mathe-
matics—trigonometry, and, for that matter, even inter-
mediate calculus. He thus realizes that he must resort
to the mathematics of differential equations for the solu-
tion to many of his problems. In some cases, matters are
further complicated by the fact that many of the solutions
to these equations must be realized by approximate tech-
niques.

Another thing which the engineer should realize as he
progresses to more complex study is that many different
problems, though apparently not in the least related at ﬁrst
glance, are solved by equations of the same exact form.
This, of course, is the theory of mathematical analogy.
The power of this theory of study cannot be overempha-
sized. For instance, the equation needed to solve an
electrical circuit composed of inductance and resistance
in series with a voltage source is the same as that needed
to solve a system composed of a force acting on a mass
which is hindered in its movement by some sort of me-
chanical damper. Even in the study of simple differential
equations, the engineer soon realizes that ﬁrst order
equations have exponential solutions and second order
equations are basically oscillatory; this last fact, however,
depending on any initial conditions given and the amount
of damping present in the system (or in the equation).

Likewise, engineers and mathematicians soon realized
a rather startling resemblance in the equations needed to
solve complex boundary value, heat ﬂow, and transmission
problems. One of the equations in question became known
as “Bessel’s Differential Equation.” Namely, the equation
is:

2

9% + t% + (t2 — n2)y = 0. (1)
It is the purpose of this article to expound on the mathe-
matical properties of Bessel’s Equation and to give the
reader a very basic insight into the solution and properties
of this equation. If interested in a deeper analysis of the
Bessel Equation, the reader is referred to Treatise on the
Theory of Bessel Functions, by G. N. Watson.

In Bessel’s Equation, the symbol, “n” represents any
real number, though usually an integer. Because of
obvious variable coefficients in the equation, we assume a
solution in inﬁnite series form exists. We therefore try a
solution of the form,

y = kZl0Cktk+“, (2)

and proceed to solve the differential equation by the method

of Frobenius.
Now :

(t2 — n2)y = (t2 — n2) 2 Ckt“+°‘
1 =0

= 2 cktk+«+2 — n2 2 Cktk+°‘.
k=0 k=0

Replacing K by (K-2) in the ﬁrst expression on the right
gives:

(t2 — n2)y = E C(k — 2)tk+“ — n2 E Ckt“+“ (3)
k=2 l{=0

Taking the derivative of (2) yields:

‘;—y = 2 (k + <1) Cktk+«~1.
t 1v=0

Then:

tflal’ = °§ (k + 0:) Ckt“+°‘. (4)
t k=0

Taking the derivative of dy/dt:

‘glitz = °§ (k + on — 1)(k + o:)Ckt1‘+““2;
k=0
And:
9% = k°Z°0(k + or — 1)(k + oz)Ckt“+“. (5)

Using (3), (4), and (5), Bessel’s Differential Equation
becomes:

By the method of Frobenius, we arrive at our indicial’
equations by ﬁrst setting the coefficient of ‘t’ equal to zero.

From these two equations, it is readily noticed that unless
n:= : 1/2, Co = 0.

One of the roots of our indicial equation was »- = 11.
Using this fact and setting the coefficient of t“+°‘ equal

This solution, of course, holds for n integral only, since

Recall that the remaining root of our indicial equations
was 70 = ——n. Once again, using this value and setting
the coefficient of t“+2 equal to zero and also remember-

Let us now recapitulate what we have done thus far:
(1). We initially set out to solve Bessel’s Differential
Equation, our equation (1), by the method of
Frobenius, assuming a solution of the form equa-
tion (2). Here ‘K’ was a running index and ‘alpha’
was a root of what we termed our “indicial equation.”

(2). We put this solution into our original differential
equation and equated the coefficients on the left-
hand side to those on the right—hand side. Obviously,
since we were working with a reduced equation, all
of the coefficients had to be set equal to zero.

(3). By carrying out this procedure and by assuming that
“n” was an integer, we found that all CI, for p, an
odd integer, were equal to zero. Thus our ultimate
solution contained only even powers of “t”.

(4). The reader should have noticed at the onset that
since the differential equation was of order two, two
arbitrary constants should have appeared in the
solution. This was veriﬁed by the fact that the
indicial equation yielded two roots, which we saw
ultimately led to two independent solutions, each
having its own arbitrary constant.

(5). Our ﬁnal step was to combine these two independent
solutions linearly to yield our ﬁnal result.

/Z/'___,,,J'

Once again, I should like to emphasize that although
we assumed “n” to be an integer, it need not be. In the
case where “n” would be non-integral, we would have had
to employ gamma functions in place of any factorial oper-
ations appearing with respect to “n”. We state without
derivation that a particular solution to Bessel’s Differen-
tial Equation for “n,” a non—integer, is:

°° (_1)k t2k+n

Y = k:02n +2k(k)!I‘(n+k+ 1),

mm + k +1) =f°°tn+ke"tdt
¢

Another thing we should mention is that by trying a
solution in inﬁnite series form and necessarily calculating
the derivatives of this solution so that we might put it
into the original equation, we arbitrarily assumed that we
could take derivatives of an inﬁnite series term by term.
Although this procedure seems intuitively reasonable, I
believe there exists a certain avenue of doubt as to its
validity. The reader is assured, however, that this pro-
cedure is in fact valid and is referred to Inﬁnite Series and
Sequences by Professor Konrad Knopp.

Let us now once again refer to our solution, equation
(10). When “n” is an integer, it is customary to set “B”

equal to zero and “A” equal to 2%, . We thus obtain the
solution:
t" t‘~’ t4

This solution is customarily denoted by J ,,(t) and is termed
the Bessel Function of the n”' order, 11 an integer.

Now that we have our particular solution, equation
(9), which is in inﬁnite series form, the reader may in-
quire as to the convergence or divergence of the Bessel
Function. To investigate this matter further, we employ
d’Alembert’s Ratio Test. Let us now proceed to take the
absolute value of the ratio of the (K—|—1)st term to the
Kth term of the series. This gives:

First and Second Order Bessel Functions

And according to d’Alembert’s test, the Bessel Function
1
converges for t‘~’ < Lim p = co or for t< oo.
k—>oo

This means that the function converges for all values of
“t.”

This thus ends the extremely brief study of Bessel Func-
tions. I emphasize the word “brief,” for it would be a
nearly impossible task to study the derivation and all the
properties of this function in strict mathematical form in
an article such as this. However, I hope I have succeeded
in exposing the student engineer to the few basic facts
underlying a function whose importance to engineering
cannot be over emphasized, the Bessel Function.

 The 1962 Langley Memorial Lecture

About

Samuel Pierpont Langley

In 1866 a 52-year-old professor of
physics and astronomy at the Univer-
sity (then known as the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania) began to study
the gentle soaring ﬂight of migratory
whooping cranes. He had become in-
terested in a work on their ﬂight by
Israel Lancasted; he could not rest un-
til he had discovered how these birds
could sustain themselves for hours in
a seemingly effortless position. This
curiosity of Professor Samuel Pierpont
Langley was to lead him to achieving
important feats. Professor Langley
would be the one whose heavier-than-
air ﬂying machine would soar through
the air before the Wright brothers were
successful; he would be the one to
prove a mistake in Newton’s ﬁgures
on resistance.

Professor Langley’s feats were ac-
complished because he could grasp
new relationships and would work hard
to prove his theories, even though pub-
lic opinion would be against his “silli-
ness.” The most important relation-
ship that Professor Langley formulated
sprang from his interest in the ﬂight
of the whooping crane. He realized
that the ﬂight of these birds was de-
pendent upon a Newtonian Maxim
which stated that the resistance of a
plane surface to the air varies as the
square of the sine of its angle of inci-
dence. Now the hard work began.

Langley began to expand his experi-
ments and apply the principle to a
variety of surfaces. The result of this
study was the issuance of a physical
law by Langley which stated that New-
ton’s ﬁgures on resistance were in error
and that resistance was only 1/20 that
stated by Newton. He further stated
that mechanical ﬂight was possible with

24

engines then in existence.

In 1889 Professor Langley was
named secretary of the Smithsonian
Institute in Washington, D. C., and,
as a result of this position, was able
to secure funds to publish his writings
on the heavier—than—air ﬂight. At this
time Langley also experimented with
hundreds of ﬂying models powered by
many engines of various kinds.

The hard work continued; he con-
structed a small, very lightweight steam
engine which operated with a low pow-
er to weight ratio; he worked long and
hard on the development of suitable
wings to carry the aerodrome. By 1894
he was experimenting on a ﬂying model
which was launched from atop a house-
boat moored in the Potomac near
Quantico. The wings of the poorly-
balanced model were of silk, the frame-
work of split bamboo. The fragile
nature of the lightweight craft required
a dead calm for launching—a situation
rarely witnessed in a Virginia winter.
The launching catapult was tricky and

6 unreliable. These factors spelled im-

mediate defeat for the ﬁrst four mod-
els shot into the cold air. One by one
the frail models strained at the catapult
with the force of their tiny steam en-
gines, and one by one they were cut
loose, only to drop and sink beneath
the deep, murky waters of the quiet
river.

Success came in October, 1894.
Aerodrome No. 5 was launched and
maintained ﬂight of three seconds
which covered about 35 feet. The
aerodrome weighed 22 pounds “ﬂying-
weight.”

After much thought to the necessity
of proper moments of rotation, a pair
of tandem wings and a pair of crossed

planes for the tail assembly was de-
cided upon. The launching of No. 6,
a 26—pound model which looked like
a dragonﬂy, was a failure and the crash
was attributed to a faulty launching.
But the venerable old man with his
shirtsleeves rolled up stood on the bank
of the river and realized that his suc-
cess was closer than it had been for
years.

Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, a close
friend of Professor Langley and a man
who knew the hardships of fruitless
research, was present at the launching
of the rebuilt No. 5 equipped with
tandem wings. The day was May 6,
1896. Langley and Bell had just ﬁn-
ished a ﬁnal check of the launching
mechanism, the wings, the tail, and the
engine of the aerodrome. They stood
on the shore and looked out to the
houseboat. Langley had been through
one of the most difficult winters of his
life. He had seen model after model
collapse and sink. Newspapers had
called him a madman, quack and
dreamer. Through all the defeat he
had retained his belief that powered
ﬂight was attainable in his time. Now
Bell stood by, camera in hand, waiting
to secure positive proof. The white-
bearded astronomer waited until a few
minutes after three and then shouted
to the attendant on the houseboat, “Let
her go.” Then he held his breath.

The propellers whirled madly, the

N

tiedown rope was cut, the aerodrome
shot off the end of the catapult, dipped
toward the water and then, to the shock
and surprise of Langley, Bell and mor-
bidly curious onlookers on the banks
of the Potomac, it began to rise slowly
in long graceful spirals. In the shout-
ing and confusion, Bell forgot to take
his historic pictures and hugged Lang-
ley excitedly. He later told reporters
that he saw tears on the old man’s
cheeks.

The aerodrome remained airborne
for 1 minute, 20 seconds, attained an
altitude of between 70 and 100 feet
and covered 3,000 feet. Immediately
after the model was recovered safe and
sound from the river, it was relaunched
and ﬂew again for 2,300 feet. A re-
built No. 6 was launched in November
of the same year and ﬂew 4,200 feet
at about 30 mph.

Professor Langley’s curiosity had
been satisﬁed. His principles had been
proved. He stated publicly that the
success of Aerodrome 5 and 6 marked
the end “of the work which seemed to
be especially mine—the demonstration
of the practicability of mechanical
ﬂight~—and for the next stage, which
is the commercial and practical devel-
opment of the idea, it is possible that
the world may look to others.”

The world, however, looked to
Langley. In July, 1898, Gen. Adolph-
us W. Greely, chief of the United States
Army Signal Corps, was sent to Smith-
sonian by President McKinley to re-
quest that Langley build an aerodrome
suitable for combat duty. By the sum-

3,000 foot ﬂight.

Langley’s one-quarter size gasoline-engined model.

mer of 1903, the tandem-winged aero-
drome, with a wing span of 48 feet
and an overall length of 52 feet, was
ready to be launched. It boasted a
framework of steel tubing, bevel gear
transmission, cotton—percaline—covered
wings and two pusher propellers.
The aerodrome used a split—vane rud-
der and an “equilibrium control,”
which trimmed the ship fore and aft.
The pilot was able to adjust the engine
in ﬂight from his seat in front of the
power plant. Lateral and vertical con-
trols were mounted to the right and
left of the exaggerated dihedral of
the wings.

The aerodrome was mounted on the
catapult and ready to launch, and there
it sat for two months while storms
lashed the Quantico area. Finally, on
October 7, 1903, the launching was
made. Professor Langley was detained
in Washington for oﬂicial business or,
perhaps, merely used that excuse to
hide from the waiting press, who had
already expressed an open criticism of

wsmn. ‘

AERODROME NO. 5 is poised on the launching catapult just before its first successful

the government’s waste of money on
the experiment. Nevertheless, the
launching was made, and the aeroship
fell heavily from the end of the plat-
form into the water. Manly, its pilot,
was rescued unhurt and made a state-
ment to the press in which he blamed
a lack of balance in the airframe for
the failure.

Although his heart was never in the
new experiment, Langley took the lat-
est failure as a personal defeat. His
courage, however, would not be sub-
jugated and through the constant and
relentless persuasion of Manly, he re-
peated the fateful experiment of 1903.
The latest attempt on January 6, 1906,
resulted in the destruction of the ma-
chine, even before it left the catapult.

And so ended the experiments in
ﬂight by Professor Samuel Pierpont
Langley—in failure. A short time
after the failure of the fund—raising
campaign for the last trial of Langley’s
man-carrying machine, the Wright
brothers successfully made their ﬂight
at Kitty Hawk. When Professor Lang-
ley read of their success, he turned to
Manly and said, “I must congratulate
them.” But the ﬁre of curiosity and
the burning desire to achieve powered
ﬂight were gone from Langley’s eyes.
He cleared his desk in the Smithsonian
Institute and resigned his position.

On February 27, 1906, without fan-
fare or public attention, forgotten by
the press which beat him to defeat and
the crowds that waited to see him fail,
Professor Langley died. He had never
seen a man ﬂy.

Eight years later, in 1914, a rebuilt
model of the man-carrying aerodrome
was successfully ﬂown and landed on
the waters of the Potomac, proving too
late to the world that Professor Langley
had achieved his dream and that only
the world prevented him from seeing it.

The University of Pittsburgh

1962 Langley Memorial Lecture

by

Raymond L. Bisplinghoff

Soldiers a11d Sailors Memorial Hall

December 6. 1962

The Samuel P. Langley Memorial Lecture, sponsored by
your engineering school, has earned the recognition of an
auspicious event. It is indeed an honor to be asked to
carry forward the high traditions which have been set by
the previous lecturers commencing with Dr. Paul D. Foote
in 1958.

Meeting with you today is a most satisfying experience
since I spent so many years of my own career in a university
community. It is especially gratifying to renew acquaint-
ances with Dean Fitterer and members of the University of
Pittsburgh engineering school faculty.

As you might expect in a lecture sponsored by your
engineering school in the memory of Samuel P. Langley,
I shall devote my attention to science and engineering as
they relate to aeronautics and space. I cannot, however,
refrain from some conjecture at the outset on how Dr.
Langley would be delighted with this topic and with the
age in which we live. It is diﬂicult to ﬁnd in any generation
a man whose contributions coincide more closely than those
of Samuel P. Langley with the broad sweep of science and
technology now emerging in our national aeronautics and
space program.

The history of Langley’s career is a lesson in versatility,
perseverance, and steadfast courage. This man, who be-
came one of the nation’s leading scientists, had no formal
education other than a high school diploma from Boston
Latin in 1851. He also pursued a period of self study in
the Boston libraries and with this preparation he went in
1857 to the west where he practiced civil engineering in
Chicago and St. Louis. His liberal education was in a sense
completed in 1864 by a year’s trip to Europe with his
brother. I do not necessarily condone Dr. Langley’s choice
of a process of education, but I believe that his success in
spite of it could serve as an inspiration. Langley returned
from Europe with :1 strong desire to become an astronomer,
a career which he began as an assistant in the Harvard
observatory. At the age of 33 he was named director of

‘the Allegheny Observatory of the University of Pittsburgh

where he remained for 20 productive years until he assumed
the highly responsible oﬂice of Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.

While at the Allegheny Observatory, Samuel P. Langley
was an ardent student of solar phenomena, and he is re-
membered for his exquisite drawings of the great sun spot
of December, 1873. He was intensely interested for many
years in the fundamental problem of the amount of heat
the earth receives from the sun and the selective absorption
of it by the earth’s atmosphere. Langley’s interest in the
sun led him to the invention of an instrument known as the
“bolometer,” used to measure the properties of the solar
spectrum. While he was still at Allegheny he became inter-
ested in the science of aerodynamics and constructed, with
the ﬁnancial aid of William Thaw of Pittsburgh, a whirling
table for experimental studies of this new science on the
lawn of the observatory. In his own words it was “of un-
precedented size, mounted in the open air and driven round
by a steam engine, so that the end of its revolving arm swept
through a circumference of 200 feet at all speeds up to 70
miles an hour.” There Langley came to the conclusion, as
his experiments continued, that mechanical ﬂight was possi-
ble with the engines then available.

When he assumed his new post at the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, he continued studies and experiments in both aero-
dynamics and astronomy in spite of the many administrative
duties which were required of him. His work in aerody-
namics was widely published and it inspired others to work
in the ﬁeld of mechanical ﬂight. In fact, Wilbur Wright
later wrote in a letter to Octave Chanute that “the knowl-
edge that the head of the most prominent scientiﬁc institution
of America believed in the possibility of human ﬂight was

one of the inﬂuences that led us to undertake the preliminary
investigation that preceded our active work.”

It is in the latter period of Langley’s career that his
perseverance and courage are most evident. He began in
1893 a three year period of determined effort which culmi-
nated in a successful ﬂight in 1896 of a steam driven model
airplane over a distance of 4,200 feet. He thus showed the
world that a heavier—than—air model could be successfully
ﬂown some seven years before the Wright Brothers man-
carrying ﬂight of 1903.

This would have, in all likelihood, been the end of
Langley’s aeronautical experiments had it not been for a
national emergency. This was war with Spain, and it
brought an invitation from President McKinley in 1898 to
construct a ﬂying machine as a weapon of war. Again
Langley summoned his strength for a period of sustained
effort which was to witness two heart—breaking failures to
ﬂy his own machines and to end in his death in 1906
without having reached his goal.

We are told that Langley’s unsuccessful experiments cost
the United States government some $70,000.- We can also
discern over the years some feeling for the opprobrium
which was leveled against this visionary man. A particu-
larly cruel newspaperman wrote, for example: “here is
$100,000 of the people’s money wasted on this scientiﬁc
aerial navigation experiment because some man, perchance
a professor wandering i11 his dreams, was able to impress
oﬂicers that his scheme had utility.” One cannot help but
compare the attitude of Langley’s day toward scientiﬁc
experimentation with that of today in which billions are
spent on research and development.

Despite the pioneer efforts of Langley and the Wright
Brothers, the European countries forged ahead in the de-
velopment of aircraft de_s;1Pgn_a1.ld*technology prior to World

War I. To deal with this deﬁciency, we established in
1915 the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the
predecessor of the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration, with a $5,000 annual budget attached as a rider
to the Naval Appropriations Act of that year. It was
charged with the conduct of research to advance aero-
nautics. We can say that this was our country’s ﬁrst step
into so—called big science.

In the early years of this century, another American,
Robert H. Goddard, carried forward the pioneer work in
the development of the rocket and demonstrated that a
rocket, carrying its own oxygen supply, could provide
thrust in a vacuum. But again it was European countries,
Germany and the Soviet Union, which built the first hard-
ware capitalizing on this principle for military purposes.

These and other examples have demonstrated that our
country cannot afford to lag in the advancement of human
knowledge. Clearly a nation with the responsibilities of
ours in today’s world must continue to pursue knowledge
to provide assurance that it will fulﬁll its responsibilities.
As the realization of this truth has grown since World War
II, the participation of the National Government in research
and development has expanded in geometric progression.
At the turn of the century the sum was less than 10 million

dollars a year. At the beginning of World War 11, Federal
outlays for research and development were still under 100
million dollars a year. Consider now these ﬁgures: one
billion dollars in 1945, two billions in 1953, three and a
half billions in 1956, twelve and a half billions in the current
ﬁscal year, which began July 1st.

Activities in space are responsible for more than half of
the nine—billion dollar increase in Federal research and
development outlays since 1956. The current space budget
is about 5.4 billion dollars, of which just under 3.7 billion
will be obligated by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration for aeronautics and space research and
operations. The Department of Defense space budget is
1.5 billion, and the remainder will be expended by the
Atomic Energy Commission, the Weather Bureau, and the
National Science Foundation.

You are all undoubtedly familiar with the NASA work
on orbiting satellites and space probes as well as the projects
of manned space ﬂight. The solid and enduring substance
of space applications represented by the communications
and meteorological satellites is recognized by all discerning
people. The highly successful and spectacular manned
orbital ﬂights of Project Mercury have been given wide
publicity. The aspirations of Project Apollo to land men

on the moon and return them in this decade have ﬁred the
imaginations of many. lf Langley were a contemporary
American citizen, I am sure that he would be proud of
these bold plans and exploits.

However, there is another relatively unpublicized side of
NASA’s work, that of advanced research, which I would
like to talk about today and which I am certain would also
receive Langley’s warm approbation. We are often asked,
“Why is advanced research required?” The answer to this
question has been given repeatedly by the lessons of history
of science and technology. These lessons have taught that
for pre—eminence, any branch of technology must embrace
both fundamental research as well as applications of this
research to projects for the beneﬁt and use of man. The
projects, which in the NASA example are the satellites and
manned missions, rest upon the intellectual activity of re-
search conducted in previous days and years. The intel-
lectual activity of the research of today derives vigor and
freshness from the motivations of the projects. For con-
tinued progress there is an immutable coupling between the
two, and the absence of one produces sterility in the other.
These assertions must certainly apply to large technological
enterprises as well as small although our observations have
been conﬁned for the most part to the smaller entities such
as industrial ﬁrms. Industrial ﬁrms have learned that con-
tinued progress cannot depend alone upon salesmanship
based upon yesterday’s technology, but that a sharp cutting
edge of advanced research and technology is a necessary
ingredient. The successful American company, based upon
the exploitation of a single, perhaps patentable, idea is
familiar. The idea may be codiﬁed carefully in guarded
notebooks and in the minds of chosen executives. High
dividends may be paid to the stockholders and enlightened
employee beneﬁts given. The management may be con-
ducted according to an organization chart which is carefully
designed. The company executives may be pillars of the
community who make substantial contributions to all po-
litical and civic organizations. Nevertheless the company
drifts slowly into bankruptcy because it is unwilling to
expend a sufﬁcient fraction of its proﬁts to bring along new
ideas as replacements for the original. So it is, I believe,
with all technological enterprises whether they be measured
at the unit of an individual, a company, a government
bureau, or a nation.

I would like to outline for you in a general way some
examples of the pathways of advanced research which must
be followed during the l960’s if we are to stand foremost
among nations in aeronautics and space activities in the
1970’s. There are four areas where I would suggest that a
continuing and driving program of advanced research is
required if we are to achieve pre—eminence in aeronautical
and space activities in the future. These are:

(1) Energy conversion and propulsion

(2) Materials and structures

(3) Control, guidance, and communications

(4) Space sciences and the environment of space

The challenge of the future which is presented to us in
the area of energy conversion and propulsion embraces the

30'

most diﬂicult technical problems ever faced by mankind.
Man’s eﬂorts to propel himself along the surface and above
the earth have always involved an energy conversion cycle
which converts energy supplied by nature into thrust or
torque. In modern aeronautical and space vehicles we are,
in general, interested in two types of energy converters. The
ﬁrst is a propulsion device which supplies thrust and the
second is an on-board power supply. The three principal
sources of energy are chemical, solar, and nuclear. All
three are exploited in advanced research in our national
space program.

As you are no doubt aware, the largest existing space
boosters make use of the energy contained in the propellant
combination of liquid oxygen and kerosene. The growing
need for more powerful and eﬂicient chemical engines has
spurred research into higher—energy combinations such as
oxygen and hydrogen, ﬂuorine and hydrogen, or ﬂuorine
and hydrazine. These propellants are viewed at the present
time as being especially promising for employment in upper
rocket stages. However, the most promise for increasing
performance of upper stages is believed to rest in the nu-
clear rocket which is undergoing development as Project
ROVER under the joint sponsorship of the AEC and NASA.
The nuclear rocket employs ﬁxed fuel elements containing
uranium-235. Propellants like hydrogen or helium are
pumped past the fuel elements and are heated to tempera-
tures which approach 6,000°R. The heated propellants
expand as gases through a nozzle to produce thrust. On
November 30, 1962, a successful test of a nuclear rocket
engine was conducted at the Nuclear Rocket Development
Station in Nevada. Flights of the nuclear rocket are planned
in the latter period of the l960’s.

The ﬁeld of electric propulsion is being given very strong
support in our national space program. Such electrical
thrusters as ion rockets, one type of which is illustrated
schematically by Figure .1, could impart over periods of
months and even years accelerations on the order of IO—5
or lO—“g to space vehicles. The ion engine illustrated by
Figure l is known as the contact ionization type. Cesium
propellant is passed through a porous hot tungsten plate
which extracts an electron from each cesium atom producing
positive cesium ions.‘ The ions are accelerated by ﬁeld elec-
trodes and prior to exit from the engine are neutralized by
the addition of electrons through an electron gun. Electric
thrust devices require, of course, on-board electrical gener-
ators. For small engines requiring power of the order of
3 kw, solar or isotopic electric power generating systems
may be employed. For higher powers, nuclear—electric
power generating systems must be used. Such systems are
under active development. An illustration of a double loop
Rankine cycle space nuclear—turbo—electric power system is
shown schematically by Figure 2. This system is similar
in concept to those under development in the national space
program. Such systems must employ liquid metals as the
working ﬂuids. For advanced electric thrusters, nuclear-
electric space power systems in the power range of tens of
megawatts will be required. The diﬂiculties which must be
overcome here may be appreciated when it is realized that
these systems must weigh less than 20 pounds per kilowatt
and operate reliably over periods of months and years.

The opportunities for ingenuity in affecting energy con-
version in space are limitless. Fuel cells are an example of
a concept which is being vigorously pursued. They are
electrochemical devices like batteries except that the react-
ants are supplied to the cells from external tanks. One
version of our fuel cell research involves the employment
of human waste as an energy source. Along the same lines
we are developing a bio-battery in which biological activity
changes an unreactive chemical into one where electrical
energy is obtained.

Man’s engineering achievements have always been in-
extricably linked with his ability to use the materials fur-
nished by nature. A decade ago, before we had capabilities
of launching spacecraft or of operating aircraft at high
supersonic speeds, the engineering demands could be satis-
ﬁed with relatively few classes of materials. Furthermore,
aircraft did not experience conditions drastically different
from those of other machines such as locomotives, auto-
mobiles, or ships. With the arrival of space vehicles and
supersonic aircraft, many new materials requirements have
arisen. In most instances, the materials used in the older
technologies could not be adapted to the new needs. Conse-

quently, new approaches using entirely new classes of ma-
terials had to be found.

Materials research extends, more than the other basic
research activities, over a wide range from the study of
physical principles to applications in the space program.
The materials problem may be connected with a tank in a
launch vehicle, a heat radiator in space or a re-entry body,
or it might be concerned with the theoretical understanding
of surface phenomena and crystalline structures. It is in-
herent in studies of interplanetary travel and re-entry where
the main concern is extreme environments: low and high
temperatures, vacuum of space, and high launch and re-
entry forces.

One of the most refreshing by—products of our space
program might be termed “materials gadgeteering.” It has
long been the desire of metallurgists to engineer a material
to meet specific requirements. To a limited extent, this is
now possible. For example, rocket nozzle throat material
requires a combination of strength and thermal conductivity.
A metal, which in a pure state does not have the desired
characteristics, may be conventionally strengthened by the
addition of alloying materials. However, in almost all cases,

the thermal conductivity is drastically reduced which leads
to cooling diﬁiculties and therefore to wall destruction.
Intense research efforts are being devoted to combining high
strength with high thermal conductivity. One method of
accomplishing this is by ﬁbre strengthened alloys as illus-
trated by Figure 3 in which many small ﬁbres are mixed in
the material, such as aluminum oxide fibres in aluminum.
We ﬁnd that ﬁbre strengthened materials may have the
same strength but many times the heat conductivity of a
conventional material.

A materials problem which is of great urgency in our
space program is that posted by the storage of cryogenic
liquids. Storage of liquid oxygen at ——300°F in tanks
creates serious problems. For example, if certain tank
materials are struck, even mildly, when full of liquid oxygen,
violent reactions including ﬁre and explosion can result.
Since our tanks may be struck by micro—meteoroids or sub-
jected to severe vibrations we must ﬁnd tank materials
which are not reactive with liquid oxygen under impact.
We are very hard at work in attempting to understand the
nature and prevention of these reactions.

The most efﬁcient space vehicle would be useless if it

could not be controlled, guided, and communicated with
in space. The heart of a control and guidance system is
the gyroscope, an object which has been improved continu-
ously over the past decade. Reliable inertial gyro units
with drift rates of one minute per hour have been developed.
The difﬁculty of this task was emphasized by C. S. Draper
when he pointed out that such a drift rate requires a center
of mass deviation of the gyro of less than ﬁfteen crystal
lattice dimensions of the material employed for gyro con-
struction. Attempts to further improve gyros have led us
along several pathways, one of which is toward the cryogenic
gyroscope. The cryogenic gyroscope utilizes the phenome-
non of superconductivity discovered by the Dutch physicist
Onnes in 1911. Onnes discovered that the electrical resist-
ance of some supercooled metals vanishes near absolute
zero. In the l95()’s, Matthias of the Bell Telephone Labo-
ratories and Bardeen of the University of Illinois succeeded
in cataloguing a number of superconductor materials and
in improving the understanding of the phenomenon.

We are attempting to put this phenomenon to work by
making a metal sphere levitate in a vacuum. If this can be
done, a gyroscopic mass can be suspended in an almost
frictionless environment. Once “spun up” to gyroscopic
speed, the run—down time constant is expected to be meas-

ured in years. The levitation is accomplished by surround-
ing the sphere with suitable magnetic ﬁelds so that a current
is induced in the sphere. Since the sphere is a supercon-
ductor, the current continues without variation indeﬁnitely.
If the sphere is oﬂ center, non-equal repulsive forces will
develop which cause it to “ride” the geometric center of
the external ﬁelds.

During the historic ﬂights of Colonel John Glenn and
others we have all been made painfully aware of the com-
munications black—out which occurs during re—entry. This
is due to the inability of radio-frequency waves to penetrate
the ionized plasma sheath which surrounds the spacecraft
as it is aerodynamically heated in the earth’s atmosphere.
For some time, we have attempted to ﬁnd a greater under-
standing of the problem and means of alleviating it. We
now have evidence that very small amounts of atomized
water injected into the ionized ﬂow ﬁeld as illustrated by
Figure 4 appear to act as a catalyst in reducing the electron
concentration. This and other means of overcoming the
communications blackout problem are being studied in
theory and in shock tubes on the ground and in ﬂight.

The area of space science is so vast that I cannot dwell
long enough here to establish its true identity. When the
term “space science” is used we infer “science in space.”
The word science is employed along the lines of the German
equivalent Wissenschaft, meaning general knowledge of or
learning about.

It is the area which has moved forward most dramatically
during the past few years because of man’s newly found
ability to peer with satellites, sounding rockets, and space
probes beyond the earth’s atmospheric blanket. It is an
area which is more properly the province of liberal arts
colleges in modern universities, the departments of physics,
astronomy, and geology being most intimately involved.

During the ﬁrst four years of its existence, NASA
launched 157 sounding rockets and 55 satellites, all of
which were intended to gather geophysical and astronomical
data. As a result, our knowledge of the density and compo-
sition of the upper atmosphere has increased greatly. Prior
to the start of the International Geophysical Year, this
knowledge was limited, for the most part, to altitudes below
100 km. At the present time, we are able to deduce
through a combination sounding rocket—satellite experiment
and theoretical arguments the essential properties of the
atmosphere up to 1,000 km. This information has great
value in understanding the solar inﬂuence on our atmos-
phere, incidentally one of Dr. Langley’s early interests, and
hence in understanding the causes of weather activity in the
lower atmosphere.

The potential values of orbiting telescopes in extending
astronomical observations beyond the earth’s atmosphere
are very great. This is certainly the ﬁrst step toward a
fuller understanding of the structure of stars and galaxies
and even of stellar evolution. It seems strange that an
orbiting satellite can be employed to obtain knowledge of
the interior properties of the earth. Such knowledge, as
those of you who study physics know, is extracted from an

examination of the precise shape of the satellite orbit. This
shape is governed by the gravitational ﬁeld in which the
satellite moves and is hence related to the distribution of
mass within the earth.

Interplanetary space has been a region of rapid develop-
ment of understanding in space science in recent months.
In the ﬁrst four years of NASA’s existence some 9 space
probes have been launched, the most recent being Mariner
II now expected to pass within 21,000 miles of Venus at
noon P.S.T. on December 14, 1962. Magnetic ﬁelds and
the motions of interplanetary plasma as well as the par-
ticulate content of interplanetary space are all objects of
study in these experiments.

I have spoken at some length about the technical chal-
lenge which faces our nation if we wish to establish and
maintain a position of world pre-eminence in aeronautics
and space activities. There is, however, a necessary condi-
tion which must be met in order to meet this challenge.
This is the condition that there be available a suﬂicient
supply of well educated and creative scientists and engineers.
Recognizing the seriousness of the requirement for scientiﬁc
manpower, the NASA has initiated a new program of grants
to universities to help in the graduate training of outstanding
students in space related science and technology. The ﬁrst
100 students entered the program this fall—ten at each of
ten selected universities. We expect that the scope of this
program will grow.

Since this lecture is sponsored by your engineering school,
I should like to conclude by outlining the challenge which
faces the faculty and student body of this school. The
requirements and standards which society places upon the
engineer in 1962 are exceptionally high——so high that few
who practice the profession truly fulﬁll them. What are the
reasons for this? A necessary requirement in the education
of a modern engineer is depth in science and mathematics.
This alone does not suﬂice. There is demanded also a
second requirement that engineering students be imbued
with the habits of thought and attitudes needed to proceed
effectively from theory to synthesis to practical conclusion.
A balanced combination of deep scientiﬁc knowledge with
true creativity and the ability to innovate is not often found
nor easily taught. Many students simply do not have the
talent to develop in both these directions simultaneously.
This is at the heart of the challenge to engineering school
faculties and it is not an easy one. The challenge to the
new graduate is equally diﬂicult if he is called on to work
in a development program which is crowding the boundaries
of technology and for which there is no established base.
The number of engineers who can truly work creatively at
these boundaries is pitifully small. Each day advanced
development programs in the United States slip for lack
of viable technical leadership of this type. This leadership
must be found if we wish to go forward at the pace which
is projected. I believe that it can be found, but only at
the price of very hard work. I doubt if young people in
any age have faced a greater challenge. I invite you to
accept this challenge.

The glamour and excitement of space age programs often obscure a fundamental fact. It is simply
that farsightedness must be coupled with sound, practical, down—to-earth engineering if goals are
to be attained. This is the philosophy upon which Pratt & Whitney Aircraft’s position as a world
leader in ﬂight propulsion systems has been built.

Almost four decades of solid engineering achievement at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft can be credited
to management’s conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy progress. In
addition to concentrated research and development efforts on advanced gas turbine and rocket
engines, new and exciting effects are being explored in every ﬁeld of aerospace, marine and industrial

power application.

The challenge of the future is indicated by current programs. Presently Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
is exploring the areas of technical knowledge in magneto/1_va’roafvnan7ics . . . thermionic and thermo-

electric conversions . . . hypersonic propulsion . . . fuel cells and nuclear power.

If you have interests in common with us, if you look to the future but desire to take a down-to-earth
approach to get there, investigate career opportunities at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ambitious young engineers and scientists. Your de-
gree? It can be a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL o AERONAUTICAL o ELECTRICAL o CHEMICAL and
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING o PHYSICS o CHEMISTRY o METALLURGY o CERAMICS 0 MATHEMATICS o ENGI-
NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS. The field still broadens. The challenge grows greater. And a future of
recognition and advancement may be here for you.

degradation

The sea, even in its quiescence, seemed distasteful that
night. Probably if it had been another time he would have
forgotten that the night wt. chilly, as he had before, and
would have lain on the be;. to imagine that he was swim-
ming, he alone swimming IL. :nal;e a fan—like slash, a great
and momentary scar in the calm sea. But not on this
night. Too much else occupied his mind. Fragments of
the moon ﬂoated like egg—shells on the water, and freshness
ﬁlled the night air.

As he walked, his feet ma ﬁe impressions in the sand.
They seemed black and hollow and very deep because no
light was in them. The moist sand yielded easily as though
he were not really walking on anything solid. His feet
sank . . . deep sank . . . another step in moist sand that
got in his shoes and bothered him . . . another step . . . deep.

Before him the cliff, dark—ugly now, yet tan and white
and lovely by day, rose Vertically with no slope in the night.
He always said that it reminded him of the cliff that Annabel
Lee might have lived on before the angels took her away.
“ ’Twas many and many a year ago in a kingdom by the
sea that a maiden there lived whom you may know by the
name of Annabel Lee . .  deep, deep sink . . . But this
was not possible for his family, he knew, had lived far into
that cliff for many generations. He walked almost to the
cliff now though, Lord knows, he could never climb it, and
would have to walk all the way back around the beach to
get home. Finally, at the bottom of the cliff he sat on a
rock and lit his pipe.

He faced neither the cliff nor the ocean but turned with
one shoulder to each, looking straight ahead so that the
whole beach before him was a path with the ocean on one
side and the cliff on the other. Far oﬁ the ocean made a
turn, or the cliff got bigger and there was no more path to
see, only the cliff folding into the sea as it did at Dover,
smaller though and yet magniﬁcent.

The ocean did not roar here, close to the cliff, as it
covered an expanse of sand. It sounded like a heavy wind
or millions of gloved hands clapping at the same time far
away. All was still—and without the sound of the sea
somehow it would have seemed less quiet.

When he was a child, he would come to the sea on
Sunday mornings when everyone else was at church because
he was too young to go. He would try to throw shells over
the cliff, even though he was supposed to stay in the house
and wait for their return. One day he stayed too long and
they came home while he was on the beach. His mother
said that from then on he would have to go to church with
them. He knew that she did not think he was old enough,
but it seemed like a good punishment. At this moment he
felt like picking up a small shell and throwing it, but that
would be silly, and he knew he could do it anyway.

Some birds were ﬂying over the cliff and were taking off
from it like planes from an aircraft carrier, he thought.

A short story by Richard F. Tanski

They ﬂew straight and high, ﬂapping like pieces of black
paper. This was autumn and they were ﬂying north. He
felt like calling them back to tell them to go south because
they would freeze up north. “Give ’em a compass,” he
chuckled, and they were out of sight.

“If a soldier doesn’t even know how to use a goddam
compass, he deserves to die,” he remembered the sergeant
saying to him long ago. He had blundered the whole
platoon into the enemy at boot camp—because he had read
the compass upside—down. They would have all been dead.
He walked them smack into the enemy and ratatatat . . .
fake bullets from a fake machine gun, and they would have
all been dead. That will keep you here a little while longer,
recruit . . . Boy, did Mother cry when she heard about that.

Push—ups . . . 1—2—3—haw . . . 1-2-3—haw. He always
hated the army and he was a bad soldier, but not as bad a
soldier as he was a civilian; so he spent his life in the army.
After thirty years of it, he was now a civilian, ex—soldier,
with gray hair and carrying the army with him in his habits.
That’s what he was doing, old dog that he was; no new
tricks. Up at ﬁve—thirty in the morning and 1-2-3-haw,
alone. Plenty of long walks, too.

A breeze was coming in from the sea and clouds with
black bottoms were forming in the sky . . . WEATHER
DRY. CLOUDS FORM. SIGN OF A STORM.

Mother and Dad were dead. Pray for the repose of the
souls of Frederick and Anna . . . Rest in peace, Amen.
Car wreck in forty—ﬁve. Dad always said that he would
live forever if he could survive the war. He was a good
man. The boy begrudged him compliments all his life;
why dirty the corpse? The caskets stayed closed. The
funeral director let him stay inside the home all night
because he knew him from when he was a boy. Locked
the place all up though. He sat on a chair near Mother’s
casket and thought about her lying in there. The top of
the casket was so smooth and cold, and thinking about her,
he cried because he loved her the way he did. Then he
got scared and tried to get out of that place, but it was all
locked up. He could hear the wash of the ocean outside
and wanted to be there; he was running around and bump-
ing into things to try to get out. He even ran into the wall
and did not feel it because he was so scared, not of his
parents but of God who was in the funeral home, telling
him to come and be anointed and that sort of thing. God
was in there not wanting to hurt him but to assure him
Heaven, and he was so afraid because God did not know
that he hated Him.

CLOUDS FORM, SIGN OF A STORM . . . He should
start for home before it began to rain. A man his age
could catch a bad cold. He didn’t have too much resistance
to weather anymore. Even now it was cold; he rolled his
sleeves down and buttoned them and folded his arms for
warmth, but he made no move to rise. A man his age,

degradation

though. The sea was rolling in further onto the beach as
the waves became bigger cylinders before they shattered on
the sand. Now, if he were a younger man, he could . . .
He’d take off his shirt and dare the storm if he were a
young man. He’d run the length of the beach and then
swim back in the sea, sit down soaking wet, and dare the
storm. He’d do all sorts of things that he wouldn’t do
when he was a young man.

Those black clouds up there were doing a strange ominous
dance. That sounded wrong, dance, but that was the only
thing it could be, sort of a slow, sliding dance across the
sky, keeping time to their own thunder and the rhythmic,
slurring hum of the sea. He re-lit his pipe and the smoke
disappeared as soon as he exhaled into the wind. The sea
was dark . . . like coffee.

Never did drink it. He always drank milk, even when
he was a kid. Most kids want coffee because their parents
drink it, but his both drank milk; so he did and everybody
thought what a perverted little kid he was. You want some
coffee, huh, mister? No, thank you. Milk please.

Luca drank coffee like a ﬁend. Used to put her to sleep,
she’d say. Often she’d say that she was built inside—out.
Whatever anything would do for anybody else, it would do
the opposite for her. That’s why you love me. Everybody
else hates me; so you love me. She’d never deny it.

She looked like a canary, just like a canary. She wore
a yellow uniform with a little white apron, and she had
real yellow hair. She sang or hummed songs while she was
working in the restaurant too. All the time she sang this
song about Jim. She used to amuse him singing about Jim,
trying to get him jealous, and he knew it. He wondered if
there really was a Jim. Was gonna marry her and settle
down to a new life. Then he was stationed in Montgomery.
All the time he was there he didn’t get any letters from her
and then he got mad. He was going to call the whole damn
thing off. He got back and went to the restaurant to give
her a piece of his mind; there he learned that she had died
of pneumonia while he was gone. Buried before he got
back. Didn’t get a chance to see her grave then, and when
he did get a chance, he didn’t want to. Mom was dead
and she was dead and that made them both alike. Some-
how he loved her more now that she was dead.

He got up now and started to walk. The moon was
covered with those big black clouds, and it was dark.
Looking back, he saw the cliff, now darker than the rest
of the dark. Far down the beach a beacon ﬂashed. It was
one of those beacons that they light when they know there’s
going to be a storm. Even if ships or boats were to land,
there was only sand in the ocean and they wouldn’t ‘crash.
The rocks were far inland by the cliff. He wondered why
they lit that beacon anyway.

There are many things people do that they don’t have to,
like when he was at Fort Dix and that kid sent him a ﬁfth
of whiskey. He was only a sergeant then. The kid got in
a ﬁght with a Negro. He was the only one who saw them
ﬁghting, and he should have stopped it. He could’ve re-
ported them both, just like that. The kid beat that Negro
to a pulp and then came over to him and drawled, “Who’s

40

he think he is? Daymn nigguh thinks he’s good as innybody.
You all gonna repo’t me, sauge, for wuppin’ that scum?”
But the sarge just looked at him and the boy walked away.
He noticed that the colored boy didn’t have any teeth. Put~
ting himself in the toothless Negro’s place, he still did not
report the ﬁght. He told himself it was a fair ﬁght, and if
the Negro had won, he wouldn’t have reported him either.
The white boy won because he was a better ﬁghter, that’s
all. But when he got a ﬁfth of whiskey a week later signed,
“Your buddy, the nigger hater,” he got mad at himself and
tried to ﬁnd that kid to beat the hell out of him. Why didn’t
he just forget it? He didn’t have to do it.

The wind was getting cold now, and he got up and started
to walk across the beach toward home. While he was walk-
ing, he kept saying the “Hail Mary” to himself over and
over again, not praying it, he didn’t pray, but sort of remem-
bering it from when he was a kid reciting it . . . Hail Mary,
full of grace . . . The Lord is with thee . . . Blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . . .
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now . . .
and at the hour of our death . . . Amen. For such a little
prayer it had a lot of meaning. Walking along and kicking
the sand, but not enough to send it spattering forth from
his shoe, only to push it away as he took another deep step
in it, he came closer to the ocean. Now it roared and ex-
ploded onto the beach with the wind, sending spray every-
where. He was wet with the stinging salt water. Suddenly
he wanted to be on top of the cliff and tried to run all the
way to get there, but the sand weighted his feet, so heavy
with age, that he was forced to walk, his destination far
ahead of him. Not far off the storm swelled and the wind
shrieked forebodingly like a laughing witch as he, like a
wet rag, was dragged across the wide beach toward the cliﬁ”.
He remembered his mother telling friends that she had borne
an ill omen. Poor he, small child that everything seemed
to happen to, who lost balls in the ocean and turned in
wrong assignments at school. But, that’s life and because
he is my son I can forget the trouble that he causes me,
can forget because he can’t help it, he doesn’t mean to do
the wrong things, and he is my son. You just have to love
him because he just can’t help it.

The storm was closer and seemed alive; he felt its
presence, not the howling wind—rain part but the soul of the
storm, and now he knew that he would be at the top of
the cliff to watch as it came in. Before he thought of it,
there he was standing on the great cliff. Was there some
song that he should sing, recite a poem or some speech,
looking down at the ocean? With everything so far below
and the powerful thrashing of the black sea against the
shore, he reeled drunkenly with the height, his age, and
mostly with the nemesis of the storm. Far ahead, the beacon
ﬂashed, and his mind wandered. . . .

Multi—colored neon lights and laughter . . . Qualf the
nut-brown ale, boys . . . men laughing raucously and
moving in rhythm . . . Have another . . . And there was
a woman who came and sat beside him. Her teeth were
rotten and the stench of her perspiration offended his nostrils
. . . Soldier, you want a good time tonight? A real good
time tonight? Ordinarily he would have said, “Go away!
I’m in love with someone, old woman,” But there was the

\(

wine and when she said “My name’s Mary,” he said his
own name and bought her a drink. Later they walked to
her apartment as she leaned on his arm and sang almost
unintelligibly; he sang, too, and laughed because he was
with her and drunk, singing “I want a girl, just like the girl
that married dear old Dad” . . . not Luca. He laughed
harder; somehow he was satisﬁed.

They got to her apartment and she left the light off. She
was so old . . . when she kissed him on the lips with her
tongue, he wouldn’t open his mouth . . . C’mon, honey,
babeee . . . He could feel that stomach of hers protruding
as she embraced him. Her arms were heavy and she was
dirty. He never understood what made him go to bed with
her and say, ‘‘I love you” and kiss her. When he woke
up, he was sober, and ashamed. . . .

Now he looked over the cliff with the waves shattering
like broken glass on the shore. The presence of the storm
enveloped him and he felt weak, weak, so weak that his
legs failed; he was kneeling at the edge of the cliff with his

head between his legs, knowing all the while that God was
in the storm and what a great altar this cliﬁ’ was . . . “But
man, proud man, dressed in little brief authority. His glassy
essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before
high heaven as make the angels weep.” Kyrie eleison .
All the time he could never have helped anything, could
never have helped it, but merely to hate it and not care . . .
Poor he, white fat lamb . . . Mother in heaven, oh Mother
in heaven . . . Again Kyrie eleison at the hour of our
death . . . Amen.

There was light on light and the sand shone strangely
in the day; white birds, too, sailed monotonously over the
beach, sometimes taking living black creatures from it or
lighting on the cliff to rest undisturbed. The wrinkled
reﬂection of the sun in the sheen of the sea signalled the
passing of the storm brightly. Far away over the beach the
beacon ﬂashed no more. The sand was white and di-
sheveled like a morning bedsheet; the sea, tumbling over it,
wrested the image.

in July. They attend a basic course
of ﬁve weeks, including talks and
discussions by top Company ofﬁ-
cials, educational. ﬁlms, and daily
plant visits (this circuit, or “loop”
through a steel plant, is what gave
the course its name). The Loop
Course is not a probationary period.
After Completion of the basic
course, every looper receives his
ﬁrst assignment, whereupon he
goes through another, more spe-
cialized, training course before be-
ginning actual on-the—job training.

Loopers are Career Men

We select qualiﬁed men for the

National Powders the Polyethylene Pellet

.. . and opens up a new world of plastic applications

Magical things happen when polyethylene resin—usually
shipped in barley-sized pellets—is made the consistency
of ﬂour. The powder can perform like a liquid. It can be
sprayed, cast, used for coatings . . . stirred as an additive
in waxes and lubricants . . . molded into products so large
as to be prohibitively expensive if made by any other
plastics process.

Since National’s U. S. Industrial Chemicals Co. divi-
sion introduced MICROTHENE® powdered polyethylene
resins two years ago, end-uses have sky-rocketed. One
example—molded auto carpeting backed with poly-
ethylene coating. Another—new popularity for rotational
molding of hollow plastic items.

MICROTHENE typiﬁes the customer-oriented product
development made possible by National’s expansion in
plastics. Among the latest developments are: (1) forma-

tion of 50 per-cent-owned Alamo Polymer Corporation to
manufacture polypropylene resins and ﬁlms in Texas,
(2) creation of U. S. I. Film Products to market poly-
oleﬁn ﬁlms and packaging, and (3) near completion of a
linear polyethylene plant—also 50 per-cent-owned.

As the only company now on record with plans to produce
all major types of polyoleﬁn resins and ﬁlm, National is in
a unique position to meet customer needs and to make the
most of growth situations in any area of the polyoleﬁn
plastics and film market.

A Career at National . . . National is moving ahead.

GIANT GLASS DISC

This giant glass disc, which will be-
come the primary mirror for the largest
telescope in the Southern Hemisphere,
has been made by Corning Glass Works
for installation in a sixty ton telescope
in Argentina.

The 7—foot disc was made from a
single 4,000 pound piece of glass which
was placed on a mold and melted to
shape. The formed disc was then
gradually cooled for seven months to
eliminate stress in the glass.

A geometrically ribbed, honey-
combed pattern on the back face of
the blank reduces the weight of the
disc while retaining its strength and
rigidity. The blank is made of boro-
silicate glass, which is stable under
extreme temperature change.

FIELD ION MICROSCOPE

For the ﬁrst time, scientists are able to see individual
atoms of matter using the world’s most powerful micro-
scopic device, the Muller Field Ion Microscope. This new
microscopic tool, developed by Dr. Erwin W. Miiller of
Pennsylvania State University, and introduced by the Cen-
tral Scientiﬁc Company, a division of Cenco Instrument
Corp., is expected to help scientists learn the answers to
many important problems in metallurgy, especially those
dealing with the refractory or high-melting point.

The Miiller Field Ion Microscope is capable of magnifying
up to two million diameters with amazing deﬁnition and clar-
ity which surpasses the well-known electron and ﬁeld emis-
sion microscopes. Although high in magniﬁcation power, this
microscope is relatively inexpensive, costing about one tenth
the price of a conventional electron microscope. One of
the most esoteric of the advanced research instruments de-
veloped in recent years, the new microscope is expected to
be widely used throughout the world.

SILICON SOLAR CELLS

A study of silicon solar cells under various kinds of
radiation at Bell Telephone Laboratories has shown that
the cells are the simplest and among the most useful devices
available for measuring high intensity radiation.

These silicon solar cells are made by forming a thick
layer of n-type semiconductor on a base of p—type semi-
conductor. In this form they are 10 to 15 times less subject
to damage from radiation than are solar cells which follow
the original Bell Laboratories form of the device. This de-
crease in sensitivity to radiation damage makes the new solar
cell attractive for many radiation monitoring applications.

The major advantages of the solar cell over other types
of radiation detectors are simplicity and economy. For
most applications, it is merely necessary to solder wires
to a solar cell and connect them to a relatively inexpensive,
commercially available ammeter. As an illustration, one
million rads per hour of x— or gamma radiation would
produce a current from the cell of 37 microamperes, easily
measurable on a moderately sensitive meter.

THEORY

Chromatography is primarily a sepa-
ration process applicable to essentially
molecular mixtures which relies on dis-
tribution of the mixture between an
essentially two dimensional, or thin,
phase and one or more bulk phases
which are brought into contact in a
differential concurrent matter.“

Solvent partition chromatography
was introduced by Martin and Synge”
in 1941. This technique employed a
liquid mobile phase and a liquid sta-
tionary phase supported by a solid
with a large surface area. Martin and
Synge also suggested the possibility of
using a gaseous mobile phase with a
similar stationary phase, and speciﬁcal-
ly emphasized the advantages of such
a method. In 1952, gas—liquid parti-
tion chromatography was used for the
ﬁrst time when James and Martin3 re-
ported the separation and microestima—
tion of volatile fatty acids. This new
analytical technique gave a great im-

by Edward Pokrzywinski

petus to many ﬁelds of research and
many reports pertaining to gas—liquid
chromatography have been published.
A very wide range of substances,
particularly low boiling organic com-
pounds, has been studied by gas—liquid
chromatography using different liquid
phases and different instrument tech-
niques. However, relatively few inves-
tigations have been carried out on low-
er aliphatic amines because the polar,
basic amines interact with the solid
support used for column packings.”
This interaction between the solutes
and the solid support, which causes
nonlinearity of the adsorption isotherm,
has been a problem in gas—liquid
chromatography when polar solutes
are used.” Compounds bearing hy-
droxyl, carboxyl, and amine groups
tend to be adsorbed on the surface of
the solid support, causing asymmetric
peaks or peaks with tailing. In lower
aliphatic amines, the adsorption effect
is very much in evidence. This is due

It was decided to use the
A discussion of the

to the presence of “acidic active sites”
in the diatomaceous earth used as the
support. Therefore, the aliphatic
amines have not been investigated thor-
oughly by the gas chromatographic
techniques.

James, Martin, and Smith‘-’ have
separated mixtures of ammonia and the
three methylamines using a gas—liquid
chromatogram. In this investigation,
separation of ammonia and methyla-
mines was claimed to be achieved us-
ing hendecanol—liquid paraﬂin as the
liquid supported on Celite 545 (kiesel—
guhr). It was found that kieselguhr
was not inert and the adsorption of
amines on it caused “tailing” and asym-
metric bands. This was overcome to
a considerable extent by the following
treatment: after size-grading, igniting,
and acid washing, the kieselguhr was
steeped in a solution of sodium hydrox-
ide (5%) in methanol. The excess
liquid was decanted and the wet kiesel-
guhr was dried at 100° C. and stored

51

chromatography

in a dessicator over sodium hydroxide.”
The liquid phase was mixed into the
kieselguhr in the ratio of 30 weight
percent liquid paraffin in undecanol.
When the liquid phase was 15% of
liquid paraffin in undecanol by volume,
good separations were obtained. By
varying the hydrogen bonding power
of the solvent by varying the concen-
tration of liquid paraffin, the position
of the trimethylamine zone could be
changed over a wide range.‘-’

Pretreatment of the kieselguhr by
washing with methanolic sodium hy-
droxide prevented most of the adsorp-
tion, although this effect was still pro-
nounced enough to cause the zones to
appear asymmetric.

In a later publication, James carried
out separations of a large number of
primary, secondary and tertiary alphat—
ic amines and also pyridine homo-
logues. By using two types of column,
one having liquid paraffin as the sta-
tionary phase (so that the only solution
forces involved are Van der Waals
forces), and the other a polyether
(Lubrol MO) so that both hydrogen
bonding and Van der Waals forces op-
erate as solution forces, distinction
could be made between different types
of aliphatic amines. Only primary and
secondary amines are capable of hydro-
gen bonding with the polyether station-
ary phase, as an N-H group is necessary
for this bonding. The primary and
secondary amines are held back rela-
tive to tertiary amines and show great-
er retention volumes when run on a
liquid paraffin column, whereas the
tertiary amines show similar or lower
retention volumes. By plotting the re-
tention volumes of a series of amines
when run on a paraﬂin column against
those obtained on a polyether column,
primary amines, secondary amines, and
tertiary amines are found to fall on
straight lines of different increasing
slope. Bifunctional amines such as
hydroxyamines and diacidic amines lie
on positions away from those of mono-
functional amine lines by virtue of their
stronger hydrogen bonding. In this
way it is possible to deﬁne closely the
nature of an unknown amine. Further,
with liquid paraﬂin as the stationary
phase, the position of an amine is de-
ﬁned only by the Van der Waals forces
of interaction with the stationary phase.

52

Since in compounds containing C, H,
N and O atoms these forces depend
mainly on the molecular weight, it is
possible to get a rough estimate of the
molecular weight of an unknown amine
simply from its position on the chro-
matogram. Of 25 different aliphatic
amines studied, only two pairs (iso-

butylamine and sec—butrylamine, and '

also de—iso—butylamine and di—sec-
butylamine) could not be separated on
either of the two 4—foot columns?

The adsorption effect of the solid
support reported by James, Martin,
and Smith remained as the main diffi-
culty in the gas chromatography of
basic nitrogen compounds, especially
lower aliphatic amines. Knight-1° at-
tempted to deactivate the support by
using water for the separation of
amines as it did in the case of some
polar compounds. Although this meth-
od failed, he was able to obtain an
inert support by adding an amine which
was more strongly adsorbed than the
amines in the system.

Ring and Riley” attempted to sepa-
rate amine mixtures by depositing po-
tassium hydroxide on C-22 ﬁrebrick
using Flexol 8N8 as the liquid phase.
They found this technique very effec-
tive in deactivating the solid support.

Potassium hydroxide was also used
as a deactivating agent in the work
done by Decora and Dineen.‘* They
deposited 10 grams of potassium hy-
droxide on 100 grams of the commer-
cial detergent, Tide, (40-80 mesh).
This modiﬁed Tide was satisfactory of
the separation of thirteen basic nitro-
gen compounds with a pK,, range of
6-11 (i.e. pyridines, n-propylamines,
n—butylamines, etc.) when non polar
liquid phases were used. Nitrogen
compounds with pKb less than 6.0
yielded asymmetric peaks.

Honnegger and Honnegger“ investi-
gated a solid support Chromasorb
(30-60 mesh) which was pretreated
using the James’ method with a 5%
methanolic sodium hydroxide solution
and coated with 24% “Carbowax”
20M. It was reported that separation
of 1-dimethylamino-2—propanol, 2-di-
methylaminoethanol, 2-diethylamino-
ethanol, 2—methylaminoethanol, 2-am-
inoethanol and phenylethylamine was
achieved. This article also presented
various illustrations which indicated
that the adsorption effect was appar-
ently eliminated.

Satisfactory resolution and sym-
metrical peaks were obtained by Nel-
son13 in the separation of high molecu-
lar weight primary amines. Nelson
used two types of columns. The ﬁrst
was silicone grease on sodium chloride
and the second was silicone oil on
Chromasorb W. The latter column was
pretreated with potassium hydroxide.

Smith and Radford” disputed James’
suggestion that washing of the support
with potassium hydroxide followed by
rinsing with water would overcome ad-
sorption effects. They coated Chroma-
sorb W, a solid support with relatively
low activity, with 5% potassium hy-
droxide by weight prior to the applica-
tion of the liquid phase. This gave
gas chromatographic packings of su-
perior properties for the separation of
aliphatic diamines. However, since low
aliphatic amines were not investigated,
it was uncertain whether this technique
would be feasible for them.

Decreased tailing of peaks in the
separation of ammonia and methyl-
amines was observed by Issoire and
Chaput.7 They added 10 per cent sodi-
um iodide and the solid support using
di-ethanolamine as the liquid phase.
However, it is doubtful if sodium iodide
is capable of deactivating the support
when a neutral liquid phase is used
instead of di-ethanolamine.

Yang and Wolf” coincided with
Amell in the separation of ammonia,
methylamine, dimethylamine, and
ethylamine. They employed 1—hexa-
decanol on C-22 ﬁrebrick which was
washed with sodium hydroxide to
achieve their separations.

Pretreatment according to James’
method of C-22 firebrick using
o—toluidine as the liquid phase was the
basis for a study recently conducted
by Amell, Lampret, and Schiek.1 They
obtained a quantitative separation of
ammonia and the methylamines. How-
ever, the column had to be replaced
periodically because o—toluidine has a
signiﬁcant vapor pressure at room tem-
perature and gradually bleeds out of
the column.

At least two reports pertaining to
the separation of amines do not involve
any deactivation or modiﬁcation of the
solid support. Franc and Wurst‘ in-
vestigatedthe retention times of four-
teen lower aliphatic amines on 20% by
weight of Elastomer E301 on kiesel-
guhr. Adsorption effects were not men-

..»‘«

tioned, but operation at 0° C. or less
was necessary for the separation of
ammonia and dimethylamine.

Although several of the above stud-
ies deal with the separations of methyl-
amines and ammonia, none of them
is satisfactory from the viewpoint of
both separation and overcoming the
adsorption effect of the support. How-
ever, since James’ classical work, many
attempts have been made and the im-
portance of chromatographic tech-
niques were evidenced in the fact that
Martin and Synge were awarded the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1952 for
their work in extending chromato-
graphic procedures to include sub-
stances soluble in water. Thus an
analytic process dating from the early
nineteenth century has won recogni-
tion as an important adjunct to chemi-
cal research and development?

DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT

The equipment may be classiﬁed in
two sections:

1. The reaction Unit consisting of
N2 and MA gas supplies, piping
arrangement, and reactor.

Figure 1: REACTION UNIT

2. The Chromatographic unit, in-
cluding column, detector cell, and
potentiometer recorder.

I . Reaction Unit

The Reaction Unit is outlined in
Figure 1. The MA was a product of
the Olin Mathieson Company. It was
chemically pure, stored in a heavy
walled cylinder as a liquid under its
own vapor pressure. The nitrogen was
obtained from the Airco Company. It
was chemically pure except for a small
amount of oxygen which was removed
using a deoxygenator. The nitrogen
was also dried in a trap using Drierite
prior to entering the system.

Surge pots, one containing glass wool
and the other Drierite, were installed
to dry the MA. The MA and nitrogen
were allowed to ﬂow to a third tank
and allowed to diffuse to assure con-
stant concentration and also to prevent
condensation of the MA during the
reaction. The MA and N2 mixture
was then allowed to ﬂow to a reactor
which was installed in a furnace, and
were reacted using a nickel catalyst.
The products then ﬂowed to a scrubber
and a sampling device. The scrubber

was then connected to a ﬂowmeter,
which measured the ﬂow through the
system.

The tubing is of M3 in. O.D. and
% in. stainless steel ﬁttings were used
due to the corrosive nature of the
amines. Leaks, being intolerable, were
carefully controlled although they did
hinder the experiment. MA is very
toxic and a hood along with an exhaust
system was necessary. Gas masks were
also provided for the experimenters
when working with the amines. This
section of the unit has been completed
to satisfaction and is in good operat-
ing order.

2. The Chromatographic Unit

The Chromatographic Unit is illus-
trated in Figure 2. The unit is a
Burrell—Kromotog-7 Analyzer. The de-
tector cell is a common Wheatstone
bridge connected into a potentiometer
recorder. The temperature of the cell
was regulated by a bath external to
the cell and was also insulated to main-
tain a constant temperature.

The adsorption column consisted of
an eight foot circularly wound tube
of stainless steel. The temperature of

53

chromatography

the column was kept constant by in-
serting the column in a pot which con-
tained benzene at its boiling point.
Helium was used as a carrier gas and
the ﬂow rate was controlled by a valve
and recorded on a mercury manometer.

In addition, an auxiliary setup was
made in order to obtain a calibration
curve. It consisted simply of a tank
with MA, N2, and D.M.A. which had
a sampling device attached to it. The
sampling was done by means of a
syringe and it was injected into the
column.

PROCEDURE
A. Preparation of the Column Packing

The column which was ﬁnally decid-
ed upon consisted of Celite coated with
diglycerol and tetraethylenepentamine
(TEP), which was previously washed
with KOH. The packing was prepared

as follows: weigh out 40 grams of
Celite into an evaporating dish. Make
up a 10% solution of methanolic KOH.
Pour the KOH solution into the Celite
and allow it to stand after stirring.
Decant the solution and dissolve 2.5
grams of TEP and 7.5 grams of di-
glycerol in methanol.
tion into the washed Celite. Stir to
make a homogeneous solution. Heat
packing at 200° C. until all the meth-
anol evaporates, stirring continuously
to prevent burning. Cool the packing
and pour it into the 8 ft. column to
be used in the analysis.

B. Operating procedure

After inserting the Column packed
with Celite coated with TEP and di-
glycerol, the helium carrier gas was
passed through the column and then
through the cell. The cell was then
checked to make certain that helium
was ﬂowing across the reference side.
If ﬂow was detected, the detector cell

Pour this solu- -

was turned on and allowed to come to
equilibrium. When equilibrium condi-
tions were attained, a sample was taken
from the stream with a syringe and
injected into the column. The sample
was then blown through the column by
the helium carrier gas and soon the
ﬁrst peak appeared. The entire analy-
sis time varied from 2.25 minutes to
5 minutes.

Included in this report is the desired
separation that has yet to be achieved.
(Figures 3)

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

During the entire time spent on this
thesis, no reproduceable results were
obtained. Although there was signiﬁ-
cant separation of the components, a
great deal of trouble was encountered
with the detector cell. The base line
on the recorder varied greatly and the
trouble was traced to the detector cell.

Figure 3: EXPECTED SEPARATION OF AMINES using a Celite packing coated with

15% diglycerol and 5% TEP.

The following steps were taken to cor-
rect the situation:

(1) Clean the cell by blowing ace-
tone through it.

(2) Resolder the connections from
the cell to the column.

(3) Reverse the ﬂow by passing the
sample through the rear of the
column.

(4) Insulate the detector cell.

It was found that corrections 1, 2,
and 3 showed little improvement, while
correction 4 showed considerable im-
provement, yielding a base line which
was almost straight.

It is believed that the Celite packing
coated with TEP and diglycerol should
be suitable for the separation necessary.

DISCUSSION

Although the main objective of ob-
taining the necessary data for a calibra-
tion curve was not achieved, much
progress toward a solution to the prob-
lem was attained.

Previous problems which occurred
and their solutions were:

(1) The cylinders of amines con-
tained water which was carried to the
system. Two traps, one containing
glass wool and the other Drierite were
installed at the exit of the cylinder to

 

problem was alleviated by supplying
the workers with gas masks.

(3) The amines are stored as liquids
under their vapor pressure and tend to
condense altering the ﬂow and the con-
centration. This problem was rectiﬁed
by allowing the amine to ﬂow into
another tank and pressurizing it with
nitrogen.

(4) The gas sampler leaked badly.
This problem was solved by using a
syringe injection technique.

In addition, a new furnace was in-
stalled for the reactor to replace the
oil bath which was originally used.
This enabled the workers to control the
temperature of the reactor very ac-
curately. A deoxygenator was also
installed in the system after the nitro-
gen tank to remove the small amounts
of oxygen present. Finally, the tem-
perature of the column was controlled
by placing it in a pot which contained
benzene at its boiling point.

The only remaining problem that
needs to be solved is to attain a regular
base line on the recorder. It is be-
lieved that once this problem is allevi-
ated, the remaining work will progress
smoothly.

prevent the water from inﬁltrating the
system.

(2) The amines were very toxic and
the fumes harmful to the worker. This

AT NASA. YOU’RE IN THE AEROSPACE CENTER OF THE FREE WORLD

 . . .your place in space

NASA programs encourage swift professional growth

for the engineer or scientist launching his career

You can accelerate your career swiftly
as a professional staff member of the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion. Stimulating assignments, unequaled
resources, liberal programs of educational
assistance, early responsibility—all help
hasten the professional growth of the
engineer or scientist who chooses NASA
for his initial career position.

Each NASA research center offers its
own comprehensive plan to help advance
your knowledge and speed the time when
you can contribute at the peak of your
capacity. The plans differ from center to
center, but this summary is generally valid
throughout the, NASA complex:

NASA Installations
Maintain University Ties

NASA centers have established close
relationships with nearby universities. As
a professional staff member, you may
pursue graduate study either in the even-
ing at NASA’s expense or during regular
working hours on full salary. And, if
necessary to fulﬁll university requirements
for a graduate degree, you may become a
resident student, also on full salary.

 

m .

NASA encourages advanced study in
astronautics, physics, electronics, chemis-
try, metallurgy, mathematics, astronomy,
and geophysics, as well as aeronautical,
mechanical, electronic, electrical, nuclear,
ceramic, and civil engineering, engineering
mechanics, and engineering physics.

Guggenheim, Sloan, Brookings
Fellowships Available

Additional avenues of opportunity will
be open to you because NASA participates

  
   

 

in fellowship programs of the Guggen-
heim and Sloan Foundations and the
Brookings Institution. Right now, as a
result of this participation, NASA staff
members are attending Cal Tech, M.I.T.,
Harvard, and other leading schools, re-
ceiving full salary, expenses, and per diem.

NASA helps you keep abreast of the
latest developments in your ﬁeld by per-
mitting frequent attendance at major
technical conferences in this country and
abroad.

Unique Intern Programs
Increase Technical Competence

The NASA centers offer exhaustive in-
house educational opportunities as well,
including the unique Intern Programs.
The regular in-house activities include
lectures, seminars, ﬁlms, and expense-paid
trips to other organizations. The Intern

 

 

Program is somewhat different. As an
Intern, you study and work closely with a
senior NASA scientist or engineer, a
leader in his—and your—ﬁeld. This is an

informal and exceedingly productive
arrangement, which usually lasts for six
months. The Intern Rm ram is designed
to bring you very rapidlf to the forefront
in a special technical are .

Richard E. Covert, Iowa State BSME
'62, utilizes an analog computer to
study heat transfer transients and
their eﬁect on the control mecha-
nism of a mobile military compact
reactor being developed by the Alli-
son Division of General Motors un-
der contract to the Atomic Energy
Commission. Covert is one of sev-
eral young engineers now engaged
in various studies connected with
nuclear powerplant engineering
programs at Allison.

O NUCLEAR ENERGY CONVERSION—For the last 5 years, Allison,

the energy conversion Division of General Motors, has participated in the

design of various nuclear powerplants requiring compactness and low weight.

Work on these projects has resulted in the compilation of a formidable back-
/ ground in nuclear systems engineering for space and terrestrial powerplants.

/ Announcement by the Atomic Energy Commission of the selection of Allison
I as prime contractor for development of MCR (Military Compact Reactor)
now creates opportunities for well-qualiﬁed Engineers and Scientists in a long-

/I range program in the nuclear ﬁeld.

The MCR is a lightweight, completely self-contained nuclear reactor power
system—easily transportable by truck, aircraft or rail—designed to provide
packaged power for a wide variety of applications. It will have a high
temperature, liquid metal cooled reactor coupled to a power conversion
system. Incorporating long plant life characteristics compatible with military
ﬁeld equipment, the powerplant is expected to reduce the burden which shipment
and storage of petroleum imposes on combat forces.

Along with its nuclear, missile and space activity, Allison is maintaining
its enviable position as designer and producer of air-breathing engines.
Recent developments include advanced types of turboprop engines for
greater power with maximum fuel economy and without increase in engine
size; a compact lightweight turboprop selected as the powerplant for the
Army’s next generation of Light Observation helicopters, and thermally
regenerative gas turbine engines for a wide range of vehicular and
industrial use.

Perhaps there’s a challenging opportunity for you in one of the diversiﬁed
areas at Allison. Talk to our representative when he visits your campus.
Let him tell you ﬁrst-hand what it’s like at Allison where

The 1963 Ford-built cars you see on the road these days can
eat dust and keep coming back for more, thanks to improved
carburetor air ﬁlters.

In our continuing quest to build total quality and service-
saving features into Ford-built cars, our engineering research
staff explored the entire ﬁeld of physical chemistry for new
air-purifying properties in materials.

The result: a ﬁltering material made of chemically treated
wood pulp and paper that permits Ford-built cars under
normal operation to go from 24,000 to 30,000 miles before
carburetor air ﬁlter replacement is required.

The new, tougher ﬁlter paper is accordion folded to increase
surface area four-fold, permitting higher ﬁltration in a smaller
package. The more matter it accumulates, the better it ﬁlters
right up to its full rated service life. It saves owners time and
money. It keeps Ford-built engines livelier longer.

Life sciences study effects

The life sciences group at The Garrett Corporation is con-
cerned with the reaction of living organisms to their environ-
ment, and the development of environmental systems to
support such organisms.

Intensive investigation is now being conducted at Garrett
in all major areas of the life sciences—microbiology, neuro-
physiology, psychology, biochemistry, biophysics and related
areas—to study the relationships of man to his environment
in extended space travel. These studies vary in scope from
determining the effects of near vacuum conditions on labora-

of long range space travel

tory subjects over long periods of time, to deﬁnitively eval-
uating the effects of re-entry acceleration on human beings.

Garrett also designs, develops and manufactures environ-
mental control systems for this country’s major manned
spaceflight programs, including Project Mercury, Gemini
and Apollo.

For information about other interesting projects and the
many career opportunities with The Garrett Corporation,

Stopping at the ﬁrst farmhouse on his famous midnight
ride, Paul Revere cried:

“Is your husband at home?”

“Yes!” came back the reply.

“Tell him to get up and defend himself, the British are
coming!”

At the second and third and fourth farmhouses the
same was repeated, but at the ﬁfth house it went some-
thing like this:

“Is your husband at home?”

“No,” came back the reply.

“Whoa!”

Architect’s Sketch of Crucible’s New
Process Research Laboratory

Where Special People Like You Develop Special Steels!

Special steels are created by special people—people con-
stantly alert to new ideas and new technology.

To meet the demands of modern industry, Crucible
processes more than 1,100 grades of steel into 50,000
separate items. This is not only a tonnage operation but
a varied, high quality, extremely specialized production
of materials that have high strength and light weight,
that will withstand extreme heat, friction, rust, acid,
pressure and impact.

These are the problems of Crucible’s 11,000 people—-
at plants in Midland and Pittsburgh, Pa.; Syracuse,
New York and Harrison, New J ersey—at service centers
and sales offices in 34 major American cities-and
through subsidiaries in Nassau, Bahamas, Canada, Italy
and Australia. Solving these problems are the metallur-
gists; mechanical; industrial chemical and electrical en-
gineers; also the accountants, business administrators
and other highly trained personnel.

The T/zin/ting Maclzine by John Pfeifler. J. B. Lippincott Company.
1962. 242 pages. $5.95.

Many of us are prone to think of a computer, data
processor, or electronic brain as a complex and hard to
understand machine. We tend to think this way because
these electronic creations are doing so many services in our
lives: they ﬁgure bank balances, analyze cancer cells,
study football strategy, predict the weather, analyze brain
waves, and solve mathematical equations for the design of
atomic weapons, aircraft and furnaces. We think this way,
also, because we have been told that the coming of com-
puters was like a Second Industrial Revolution that promises
a future ﬁlled with miracles and marvels of science. The
Thinking Machine is the work of a man who would like
to see the public view computers from a true perspective,
untinted by fear of the complex or hard to understand.

By using a fact to fact, concept to concept form, Mr.
Pfeilfer is able to present his information without confusing
the reader. His easily understandable style immediately
removes any thoughts the reader might have about the
complexity of the issue of computers. The book begins
with a basic discussion about the need for machines to
organize, record, and incorporate the mass of rapidly ac-
cumulating knowledge that faces 20th century man. Mr.
Pfeiffer feels that the evolution of these machines is a
signiﬁcant part of human evolution and their importance
should be appreciated. This appreciation could provide

68

fresh insights for us as we reassess our rapid accumulation
of knowledge.

This evolution of counters—“from ﬁngers to transistors”
——is brieﬂy discussed. In this section, as in the rest of the
book, the ideas and concepts are presented in a logical and
entertaining manner. Mr. Pfeiffer’s ideas and facts lead us
to the conclusion that their speed is one of our modern
electronic computers’ greatest assets.

After discussing other assets the author next discusses
one of the problems man has encountered in the transi-
tion from ﬁngers to transistors. This problem is com-
municating with computers. Other problems, such as those
of programming and adapting the computer for speciﬁc
tasks, are discussed in an understandable manner. Before
reaching his ﬁnal conclusions about the future of electronic
computers in our lives, Mr. Pfeiffer makes comparisons be-
tween the human brain and the thinking machines. In many
ways they are alike; in other important ways they differ.

Throughout his book Mr. Pfeilfer is concerned with
differences: between the human mind and a computer,
between the present and the future applications of com-
puters, and between the various tasks a computer can
perform successfully. Never does he present his ideas in
a confusing way. At no time, although handling highly
fact-charged material, does Mr. Pfeiffer become too com-
plex for a layman to understand the facts and comprehend

\Y

if

the ideas. Mr. Pfeiﬁ‘er combines his
qualiﬁcations and kn.owledge with the
knowledge and research of many other
scientists to produce a book that views
many aspects of thinking machines.
For those who seek the more detailed
facts he has provided a good founda-
tion .on which to build; for those others
who want to know the story of the
thinking machines, he has told it enter-
tainingly and effectively.

Assault on the Unknown by Walter Sullivan.
McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., 1961. 450
pages. $7.95.

In his Assault Mr. Sullivan has pre-
sented the ﬁrst readable account of the
International Geophysical Year 1957-
58. Although the IGY has been termed
“the single most signiﬁcant activity of
mankind since the Renaissance and the
Copernician Revolution,” the layman
has left the discussion of IGY to the
science enthusiast because of its im-
mensity and complexity. Yet the very
fact that the phenomena unearthed in
this international effort will affect man-
kind for years to come, makes it im-
perative that an understanding of this
undertaking be reached between lay-
man and scientist.

Walter Sullivan has done a remark-
able job in his exposition of IGY; after
a brief note on the forerunners of IGY,
the ﬁrst and second polar years, and
the men behind them, Sullivan sum-
marizes the conception and birth of
the new IGY. He is careful to explain
its objectives, its development, and its
signiﬁcance to man as a world attempt
to interpret the earth, its oceans, its
atmosphere, and the space through
which it travels. Breakthroughs in the
ﬁelds of meteorology, oceanography,
geodesy, and terrestrial magnetism are
presented, always with an eye toward
the international cooperation necessary
to make these explorations worthwhile.

Data collected simultaneously from
all corners of the earth, processed
through a global network is made
available for the ﬁrst time to the reader.
The explorations, disappointments, and
triumphs of the international scientist
are here along with an age of invention,
surprises, and fantastic discoveries.
Mr. Sullivan in less than 500 pages
has well described the activities of
60,000 scientists in 66 nations in this
giant among experiments.

Opportunities at Du Pont for technical graduates—second of a series

BAYMAL®—one of our many new products
that could launch a thousand careers

New careers are important by—products of Du Pont research.
Developing BAYMAL* is a case in point.

BAYMAL is a white, free-flowing powder. It's intentionally
synthesized into submicron-sized fibrillar particles about 5
millimicrons in diameter and about 200 millimicrons in length.
These small particles display a number of properties com-
pletely different from other types of alumina now available.

Dispersibility to form stable sols with unique thixotropy,
viscosity and film forming characteristics is one of its notable
properties. Our photos illustrate another. Shake a BAYMAL-
and-water solution and it will pour. Let it sit awhile and it will
gel—won’t pour unless you agitate it again.

We see dozens of potential uses for BAYMAL. But it's up
to our development men to bring this new product to com-
mercial maturity, and here is where careers are born.

You see, from the day we examine a sample of the chemical
to the day a full-scale plant starts turning out the finished
product, years may elapse—years of patient work by chemical
engineers developing processes and assembling basic data
for process design, by mechanical engineers who must create
new equipment to make the product, by electrical engineers
whose job it is to develop control systems to meet the needs
of the process.

And BAYMAL is just one of literally hundreds of new prod-
ucts under development at Du Pont. Each one gives promise
of new and rewarding careers for technical men—perhaps like
yourself—preparing to enter industry.

portunities at Du Pont, and to know more about BAYMAL and
other new Du Pont products featured in our “Opportunities”

why not: the

The University of Pittsburgh, noted for its boldness and
initiative in establishing the trimester system, recently pro-
posed a dramatic new scheduling program for the engineer-
ing students. This new idea is the half-trimester. After
polling students and faculty as to their opinions about the
new plan, the administration of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines decided that too many obstacles and not enough
interest warranted dropping of the plan. Some of the
reasons behind this decision are outlined below.

Before going into these reasons, however, it is worthwhile
to list some of the advantages that students might have
enjoyed if the idea had been accepted. Brieﬂy, these ad-
vantages include: (1) the obvious increase in ﬂexibility of
scheduling for the working student, (2) equally important
ﬂexibility for students who travel or work on special projects
during the summer and those students who must attend
ROTC Summer Camp, and (3) a time to dispose of those
courses which take much time but deliver few credits
towards graduation. Why, then, was the plan rejected?

The reasons for this decision may be seen in the statistics
of the polling. Day (full time) students who planned to
attend the summer trimester numbered 420. Of these only
225 preferred the half-trimester while 186 opposed it.
(Nine had no decision.) One hundred and twenty-two of
the 225 students who favored the plan wanted to attend
both half—semesters, or the equivalent of the standard spring
trimester. Ninety—three of these 225 students indicated they
would attend only the ﬁrst half-trimester; seven, only the
second half. One conclusion the administration drew from
these statistics was that most of the full time day students
either opposed the plan or would receive the same amount
of education whether or not the plan was accepted.

Although the polling of the night students was incomplete,
almost twice as many night students opposed the plan as
those who favored it. Strangely enough, thirteen students
who opposed the plan indicated they would take advantage
of it should the half-trimester be initiated. One of the night
students commented that he thought the plan was a good
idea because he would have less travel time to take the same
courses. Other students though that it would be almost

72

half-trimester

impossible to absorb material from the courses at that rate,
and that ﬁve credit courses would present a scheduling
problem.

The faculty was also polled, and their feelings mirrored
those of the night students; they also rejected the plan by
nearly a two to one decision. Indicating a concern about
salaries and the impossibility of ﬁnding consulting or other
work after teaching the ﬁrst half-trimester, many of the
faculty wanted to teach both half-trimesters if the plan
went through. Others thought the extra time of a free half-
trimester, while still employed by the University, would
offer them “time to devote to new course preparation and
proposal work,” and to complete some of their research
projects. A number of the faculty agreed with those night
students who thought the pace of the courses would be
too fast.

“This system enables one to complete the teaching in a
half term. However, the exposure time is so short that the
student may not have time to ‘mature’ to the philosophy of
the subject,” commented one faculty member. Another
came directly to the point when he wrote, “Having taken
two math courses on a half term basis, I have the following
opinion: The school term of seven weeks is too short to
learn a subject. However, it is a quick way to obtain credits
needed for graduation.” Still another faculty member stated
emphatically that, “I would not want to be responsible for
any four or ﬁve—credit courses taught on this accelerated
basis, especially at night. I believe this pace is far too fast.”

Most of the faculty opinions received were either of this
nature or .of the passive “I am prepared to go along with
this program if the demand warrants it” variety. A very
few favored the idea and cited some of the advantages, but
the general consensus was one of rejection.

Perhaps some time in the future the half-trimester plan
will be discussed again; it is indeed a pleasure to see such
ideas offered to the student. But, under the circumstances
and because of the complications involved in setting up the
new half-trimester, the opp.osition and lack of interest were
too great to warrant acceptance of the plan.

We make machines, but Wall Street calls us a chemical company.

People who know nothing about Wall Street associate us with simple little cameras.

Photography involves cameras, and it also involves chemicals. A great deal of our chemical
activity, however, does not involve photography. On the other hand, the chemistry of photog-
raphy now hides inside machines like the ones above, so that photography doesn't seem to
involve chemistry any more. “Involved” is certainly the word for the situation.

It is an involved situation but it is also a very healthy one.

So healthy is the demand for electromechanical machines of all kinds and sizes to perform
the chemical operations of photography that our sizable body of electromechanical engineers
keeps very pleasantly occupied. Possibly you will write to us, and possibly we shall strike up a
correspondence, and possibly you too will come to work for us as an electromechanical
engineer, and possibly you will be running a vitamin factory for us on the day we pin the 25-
year medal on you. That's the beauty of diversification.

Manufacturing Careers Offer
Diversity. Challenge
  Opportunity

Q. Mr. Miller, what do engineers do in manufacturing?

A. Engineers design, build, equip, and operate our General Electric plants through-
out the world. In General Electric, this is manufacturing work, and it sub-divides
into categories, such as quality control engineering, materials management, shop
management, manufacturing engineering, and plant engineering. All of these jobs
require technical men for many reasons. First, the complexity of our products is
on the increase. Today’s devices—involving mechanical, electrical, hydraulic,
electronic, chemical, and even atomic components—call for a high degree of
technical knowhow. Then there’s the progressive trend toward mechanization and
automation that demands engineering skills. And ﬁnally, the rapid development of
new tools and techniques has opened new doors of technical opportunity—elec-
tronic data processing, computers, numerically programmed machine tools, auto-
matic processing, feedback control, and a host of others. In short, the require-
ments of complex products of more exacting quality, of advanced processes and
techniques of manufacture, and of industry’s need for higher productivity add up
to an opportunity and a challenge in which the role of engineers is vital.

Q. How do opportunities for technical graduates in manufacturing stack up
with other areas?

A. Manufacturing holds great promise for the creative technical man with leader-
ship ability. Over 60 percent of the 250,000 men and women in General Electric
are in manufacturing. You, as an engineer, will become part of the small technical
core that leads this large force, and your opportunity for growth, therefore, is
unexcelled. Technical graduates in manufacturing are teamed with those in mar-
keting who assess customer needs; those in research and development who con-
ceive new products; and those in engineering who create new product designs. I
sincerely believe that the role of technical graduates of high competence in the
manufacturing function is one of the major opportunities for progress in industry.

Q. What technical disciplines are best suited to a career in manufacturing?

A. We need men with Doctor’s, Master’s, and Bachelor’s degrees in all the tech-
nical disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, chemistry and physics. We
need M.B.A.’s also. General Electric°s broad diversiﬁcation plus the demands of
modern manufacturing call for a wide range of first-class technical talent. For one
example: outside of the Federal Government, we’re the largest user of computers
in the United States. Just think of the challenge to mathematicians and business-
systems men.

Q. My school work has emphasized fundamentals. Will General Electric train
me in the specifics I need to be effective?

A. Yes, the Manufacturing Training Program is designed to do just that. Seminars
which cover the sub-functions of manufacturing will expose you to both the theo-
retical and practical approaches to operating problems. Each of the succeeding
jobs you have will train you further in the important work areas of manufacturing.

Q. After the Program—what?

A. From that point, your ability and initiative will determine your direction.
Graduates of the Manufacturing Training Program have Company-wide oppor-
tunities and they continue to advance to positions of greater responsibility.

a message from the dean

    

Dr. G. R. Fitterer

FOURTEEN months ago, the Board of
Trustees approved a recommendation
by the Chancellor, that a new building
be constructed for the exclusive use of
the Schools of Engineering and Mines.
Rather than just another building on
the “Hill” to be added to the six already
occupied by the engineers, this one will
be suﬂiciently large to house all of the
engineering departments. The ﬂoor
plans are now being reviewed by the
faculties of the various departments and
it is anticipated that the thirteen and
one-half million dollar structure will be
completed in 1967. The accompany-
ing ﬁrst architect’s drawing shown here
depicts the building on the Logan

 

The schools of engineering and mines

shift into a new gear . . . by Dr. G. R. Fitterer

Armory site. This structure will con-
tain nearly three times as much space
as all of the six buildings currently
occupied by engineers today.

It is well known that before one can
shift into a higher gear, he must ﬁrst
accelerate the vehicle to a greater speed
in a lower gear. If the engineering
educational program at this university
can be likened to a vehicle for the
transportation of knowledge from the
faculty to the students, then an analogy
between these two situations exists.

The acceleration which has taken
place in engineering programs on this
campus is evident from the expansion
of the Various departments into addi-
tional space in the recent past. Eleven
years ago, all of the departments in en-
gineering were housed in three build-
ings. These were State and Thaw Halls

and the Chemical Engineering (A&H)
Building. Today, the various depart-
ments also occupy Engineering and
Pennsylvania Halls, as well as the
Upper Dental Hall (Mineral Indus-
tries), in addition to the other three.
Nevertheless, the various activities of
the faculty and students have accele-
rated to the point where the new struc-
ture is very much in order.

The previous level of educational
attainment was already high, so that
the installation of the departments into
these new quarters will permit the de-
velopment of programs at even greater
heights. The level of success of the
past efforts can best be illustrated by
the performance of the alumni. For
example, at the Fall Convocation this
year, fourteen distinguished alumni of
the University were granted honorary
