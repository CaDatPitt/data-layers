WHAT WILL
DETERMINE MY  
STARTING SALARY?

Nearly all professional associations and employers are predicting that
1961 starting salaries for college graduates will be about the same as
those paid in 1960.

According to a study by the National Society of Professional Engineers,
the 1960 starting monthly salary for engineers averaged $530. E. E.’s
received somewhat more than most other majors.

The graduate can expect a position—and compensation—
commensurate with his previous work experience,
personal maturity, and academic record.

While starting salary is only one of the
things to consider, Bendix recognizes it
as an important one, and continually
reviews rates and trends to maintain
its strong position. In addition, Bendix
offers engineers and scientists superb
challenges in such dynamic ﬁelds as
those listed below, with a wide
range of freedom to pursue special
interests.

A Message
From the Dean

By Dr. G. R. Fitterer

Whether we like it or not, we American engineers have
been challenged by the Russians and we must accept the
challenge with vigor. In either a “hot” or “cold” war, a
large portion of the responsibility for winning the contest
will be ours. We cannot fail.

It did not take much imagination on the part of the
Russians following our victories in World War I and II to
conclude that we in America had something unique which
twice stopped the German war machine. America entered
both wars late and, at times, when all of Europe, including
Russia, had their backs to the wall, and when the Germans
had. nearly attained a total victory.

The Russian leaders know that they could not have ac-
complished their victories in the latter part of World War
II without our help. We all but smothered them with a
deluge of guns, ammunition, planes, tanks, and many other
necessities of war, including food, at a time while we were
stimultaneously winning another war in the Pacific without
their help.

Although in recent years America has become the science
center of the world, this was not true during these two wars.
Instead, it was Germany which was considered the mecca
of science. How then were we able to win these most techno-
logic of all wars? It was undoubtedly through our type of
engineering education which has been unique in this world

—until now. And now, the Russians have copied many of
the good points of our curricula and some of Germany’s,
and are turning out 110,000 engineers per year to our 35,000.

Russia’s one goal is world domination. With all of these
engineers they have enough to develop the material of a
“hot” war and at the same time many engineers can be
sent to foreign lands to take part in technical assistant pro-
grams of the “cold” war.

Brazil, which is lar-ger than the United States and has
about one—third the population, is probably the most rapidly
growing nation in the world. Brazilian colleges graduate
only about 4-00 engineers per year, whereas on our scale
they should be graduating at least 11,000 compared to our
needs and 27,000 compared to the Russians.

The Brazilians must look elsewhere for their engineers,
and since we are hardly graduating enough to meet our
own needs, they are turning to Russia for this help. It is
the only other country producing engineers with any simi-
larity to ours.

Meanwhile, our emphasis through government assistance
in this country has turned to the development of scientists
and not engineers. For these reasons every engineer in this
country will be greatly needed and he must extend his
thinking to include world problems. The answers to a great
majority of these are not political.

Announcing The EMITT Awardee

Scholarship, industry and loyalty are the qualities
which the committee of engineering faculty and students
look for in awarding the annual Engineering and Mines
Travel and Training Award (EMITT). Of these, schol-
arship is of basic importance. Industry and application
to the profession, aside from the prescribed field of
study is of ‘prime consideration to the committee. And
finally, loyalty to the University and to the Schools of
Engineering and Mines, and participation in the activities.
of these units are considered in presenting the award which
sends a Pitt Engineer overseas for travel and industrial
experience in a country of his choice.

The EMITT program had its start at Pitt in the of-
fices of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER in June 1955.
Staff members, familiar with a program known as IAESTE,
the International Association for Exchange of Students for
Technical Experience, through an exchange magazine, the
PURDUE ENGINEER, initiated action ‘for a similar pro-
gram at Pitt.

In September of 1955, E&M Cabinet appointed a
chairman to investigate the possibility of Pitt engineers
participating in the IAESTE program. In December, three
students completed applications for summer employment.
Through IAESTE, placements were quickly made in
Scotland and Germany and finally in May the third ap-
plicant was placed in Sweden.

To insure the success of the program, E&M Cabinet I

pledged $500 to the awardee to help cover expenses. Four
faculty and three student leaders then began the task of
choosing the first awardee, and in the selection named the
award, the Engineering and Mines Travel and Training
Award.

Now in its sixth year, the EMITT program has con-
tinued to receive the support of E&M Cabinet, Dr. F itterer,
and the Alumni Association, who together contribute funds
to help cover expenses for the awardee’s six week trip.
Local industry has also made sizeable contributions to the
program.

BY HOWARD KANESS

A nuclear steam electric generating station is being
built on the Hudson River 24 miles north of New York
City. One of the problems in building this station is to
make the cost of the energy produced from the initial
reactor as low and as nearly competitive as possible
with conventional steam generation costs. Since present
limitations of pressurized water reactors result in saturated
steam of relatively low pressure and temperature as com-
pared to modern steam plants, an investigation of the
economics of superheating the steam generated by the
reactor before using it in the turbo-generator was made.
The cost, capacity, and plant heat rate were calculated
for a plant using the saturated steam produced by the
reactor to run the turbine, and for an alternate plant in

 

A senior M.E., HOWARD KANESS comes from West
View. He is a member of Pi Tau Sigma and Sigma Tau.

topics in thermodynamics, he is still undecided about
future plans. This article on atomic-power conversion is

GINEER.

 

which the steam from the reactor would be channeled
through separate oil-fired superheaters. The economics of
superheating the reactor steam to temperatures of 860F,
1000F, and 1050F were studied. The most satisfactory
care was at 1000F. The steam pressure at the throttle was
reduced from 405 psig at the boiler to 355 psig because of
the pressure drop in the superheater and piping.

The station will have an electric capability of 275
Megawatts; 163 MW from the reactor and 112 MW from
two oil-fired superheaters. The reactor is a pressurized
water, internal thorium converter. It will be the first unit
to make use of thorium as the fertile material to supple-
ment the base fuel, enriched U-235. The heat capability
of the reactor portion of the station will be 585 MW.

The addition of superheat to the cycle results in an
increase in capacity from 163,0.00 KW to 275,000 KW and
a reduction in cost from $524 per KW for a plant using
only nuclear fuel to an average cost of $379 per KW
for the combination of nuclear boiler and oil-fired super-
heaters. The use of superheat will also reduce the main-
tenance costs on the turbine as compared to a unit operat-
ing on wet steam.

The general layout of the station follows the general
arrangement used in conventional steam plants except the

nuclear reactor replaces the conventional boiler.

The station’s heat balance is as follows: To develop
an electrical output of 275MW, 2,200,000 pounds of steam
per hour generated in the boilers at 405 psig and heated to
1000F in two half-size superheaters will be introduced into
the turbine generator at 355 psig, and will be exhausted
to the condenser.

Condensate will be returned to the boilers after being
heated in a string of three closed heaters, an economizer,
and a high pressure deaerator. The condensate flowing
through the three closed heaters and the deaerator is heated
by bleed steam from the turbines and by an economizer
between the superheaters and the stack. From the deaerator,
the boiler feed pumps will return the condensate to the
boilers of the nuclear steam generator.

The heat rate of the steam cycle, exclusive of reactor
efficiency, is 10,700 Btu per KWH.

The nuclear steam generator consists of (1) the
reactor and its heat transfer system containing valves,
piping, pumps, boilers, and pressurizer; (2) reactor safety
and control systems; (3) safety containment vessel and
auxiliary equipment; (4) coolant treatment and makeup
systems; and (5) waste disposal facilities for collection, stor-
age and disposal of solid, liquid and gaseous wastes.

The reactor core is an internal thorium converter. The
reactor utilizes enriched uranium as the base fuel in the
form of uranium oxide, and thorium oxide as the fertile
material. The two materials are mixed and put in rod
type fuel elements.

Thorium was chosen as the fertile material on the
basis of (1) its ability to supplement the base fuel by the
production of fissionable U-233, (2) its radiation stability,
(3) its high resistance to corrosion in high temperature
water, and (4) its compatibility with uranium oxide and
stainless steel.

The first core, composed of 120 fuel elements, will have

a life of approximately 600 full power days. The active por-
tion of the reactor core approximates a right circular cyl-
inder.

The core is designed so that a structural failure will not
occur as a result of any operational procedure. Because of
the high specific power of the reactor, close tolerances must
be placed on the manufacture of the fuel elements, control
rods, and reactor vessel structure.

The composition of the core is determined by the re-
quirements of heat transfer, structure, excess radiation, and
the need for a negative temperature coefficient. About 75
per cent of the core volume is needed for the coolant flow
and about 18,500 kilograms of a uranium oxide-thorium
oxide mixture. The remaining Volume is composed of various
metals.

Between the core and pressure vessel, alternate layers of
stainless steel and water serve as a neutron reflector and a
thermal shield.

The primary coolant system consists of four parallel
loops which circulate demineralized water between the re-
actor vessel and steam generators. Each loop consists of two
motor pumps, two swing check valves, two electrically op-
erated gate valves, a steam boiler, and connecting piping.
The design conditions for all parts are 1800 psig and 650F.
The principle material of construction for components com-
ing in contact with the coolant is type 304 stainless steel.

The primary coolant pumps are single speed centri-
fugal pumps which are mounted on the head of the steam
generator and supported by the piping. Water is provided
for the cooling of the pumps during normal operation. The
pumps, however, are required to operate without cooling
water for three minutes at maximum pump delivery of hot
loop water without injury to any mechanical or electrical
parts. Idle pumps with no cooling water supply must be

capable of withstanding hot loop temperatures indefinitely
without damage to the pump motor unit.

Each loop has a swing check valve to prevent large
quantities of water from flowing through an idle pump. To
permit natural flow through the loop, the check valves allow
a small circulation of water.

The two motor operated gate valves in each loop serve
to isolate the steam boiler, pumps, and check valve from the
reactor, and the remaining loops of the primary coolant
system. These valves will normally be operated fully opened

or fully closed, providing no control of flow. Normal closing
pressure differentials on the valve are 175 psig. However,
these valves are capable of closing with emergency pressure
differentials of 1800 psig.

The steam boiler in each coolant loop consists of a U-
tube lower heat exchanger connected to an upper separator
drum. The upper drum is located above and on the center

line of the heat exchanger and is connected to it by risers
and downcomers. The normal steady output of each steam
boiler is 146 MW.

The function of the pressurizing system is to establish
and maintain primary coolant system pressure within pre-
scribed limits during warmup, steady state operation, load
changes, and shutdown. The pressurizing system consists pri-
marily of a pressure tank, heaters, surge line, spray line,
and spray head. The design conditions are 1800 psia and
650F. Normal operating conditions are 1500 psia and 596F.

The pressurizer tank is installed vertically. It contains
saturated water in the lower portion and saturated steam in
the upper portion. The water provides a reserve for the sud-
den increases in primary coolant system density.

Immersion type electric heaters are inserted into the
pressurizer through nozzles in the wall of the tank. The
heaters raise the temperature of the primary system water

and generate the steam head necessary to raise and main-
tain the pressure of the primary loop.

A surge line penetrates the bottom head of the pres-
surizer and is connected to the reactor outlet leg of one pri-
mary coolant loop. This surge line carries water between the
primary coolant system and the pressurizer system when
there is a change in primary coolant density.

The spray line penetrates the upper part of the pres-
surizer and is connected to the reactor inlet leg of one pri-
mary coolant loop. The spray line is equipped with a con-
trol valve which opens to pass a small quantity of water for
retarding any pressure rise that results from an insurge
during normal operations, and for reducing pressure when
shutting down.

The spray head, installed within the hemispherical up-
per head of the pressurizer, is designed to distribute the wat-
er in a solid cone pattern without permitting it to strike the
pressurizer wall.

Concentric, cyclindrical, stainless steel thermal shields
are mounted inside the pressure vessel. These shields reduce
thermal stresses in the vessel wall during reactor operation
by absorbing radiation coming from the core. A portion of
the primary coolant flows past the thermal shields and the
inner wall of the pressure vessel to remove the heat gen-
erated. The vessel is designed in accordance with the ASME
Boiler and Pressure Code. The design pressure and tempera-
ture are 1800 psig and 650F.

That portion of the system containing the more conven-
tional types of equipment includes the oil-fired superheaters,
the turbine-generator, and the condenser are all designed to
accommodate certain characteristics of the nuclear steam
generator. These features include: the use of two super-
heaters, large steam inlet sections on the turbines, and tubes
welded to the tubesheet in the condenser in order to prevent
the leakage of circulating water into the condensate.

The two oil-fired superheaters will operate in parallel.
Each superheater will be valved to allow isolation and start-
up while the other is operating. Each superheater will be
equipped with high pressure oil burners, an air preheater, a
forced draft fan, and a surface economizer which will be
located in the gas stream between the air preheater and the

stack. Steam from the superheaters passes through a mixing
chamber before entering the turbine leads. With 350F exit

gas temperature at the economizer outlet, the guaranteed
efficiency of the superheater is 85.5 per cent when fired with
fuel oil.

The single shaft turbine will have a double-‘flow high-
pressure element and a two-element, double-flow, low-pres-
sure arrangement with a common exhaust discharge into a
twin-shell condenser.

The condenser will be a horizontal single pass unit di-
vided into two half size shells. Divided water boxes will pro-
vide a total of four cooling water circuits. Isolating plates
will divide each half condenser into two condensing zones,
each of which will be equipped with an isolated hot well.
The condenser will be valved to allow isolation and subse-
quent overboarding of any zone in which leakage of water
is detected.

During periods when the salt concentration in the Hud-
son River water is relatively high (500 to 500.0 ppm), not
even minute leakage of river water into the condensate can
be allowed. The maximum allowable concentration of chlor-
ides in the boiler water must be kept in the range of 0.1 to
1 ppm to prevent chloride stress corrosion of the stainless
steel heat exchanger tubes.

The reactor will be regulated to provide constant steam
pressure in the boiler regardless of the load on the turbo-
generator. The reactor will be designed so that the load
may be increased from 15 per cent to 100 per cent over a
period of a half hour. Moreover, the load may be taken off
at the same rate. If the turbogenerator fails, the reactor will
be kept in operating condition for a couple of hours. In this
condition, the reactor will be loaded to 15 per cent capacity
by means of a steam bypass around the turbogenerator. With
the use of a pressure reducing valve and desuperheater in
the bypass, steam will be passed directly to the condenser,
and the heat rejected to the river.

When completed in 1961, the Indian Point Station will
be the world’s largest nuclear power plant, with a capacity of
275,000 kilowatts of electricity. This installation is a giant
step forward in the development of nuclear technology, help-
ing to keep America first in nuclear power. .

Courier

In August of last year the United States launched a

’ I 500 pound satellite which was developed by Philco Western

Development Laboratories, of Palo Alto, California, for use
by the Department of Defense. This first attempt to launch
this satellite, Courier I-A, ended in failure when the rocket
carrying the satellite exploded at an altitude of 18 miles.
Approximately a month later on October fourth, another
attempt was made to put another Courier satellite, I-B, in
orbit. This attempt was successful and at the present time,
the satellite is orbiting the earth nearly 14 times daily. Its
primary purpose is to transfer messages from one point on
the earth to another.

The Army’s self-sufficient satellite has a built-in power
-source consisting of about 20,000 solar cells. Built-in circui-
try rejects any command or query not properly coded, and
through redundant components the satellite carries spare
parts for repairing itself.

ROY MARANGONI is a Sr. M.E. who comes to the Uni-
versity from a small community in Western Pennsylvania
called Bessemer. He is a member of Pi Tau Sigma and

Roy’s first article in the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.

Courier’s ornamental appearance misrepresents its work-
horse capabilities; its surface covered by thousands of bluish,
highly reflective solar cells has outwardly little in common
with the typical olive drab military communications equip-
ment. Only the antennas, protruding from a white band
around its middle, give it a functional look.

Different from its recent predecessors, the Department
of Defense’s Courier is not intended for navigation purposes
or scientific measurements, nor is it on a reconnaissance
patrol in space. It is out in space expressly to test its ability
to relay messages for communications between ground sta-
tions. Its capacity is estimated to be equivalent to 3,400,000
words a day or approximately enough words to fill 465 solid
pages of newspaper information without ads or pictures in
the standard eight-column size newspaper page.

Courier’s successful operation now opens the door to
untold future developments in civilian world communica-
tions. Its success foretells highly reliable transoceanic deliv-
ery of messages by means of satellites. These messages for-
merly were interrupted by atmospheric disturbances to radio
circuits or they suffer-ed costly delays in underwater cable
movement. While the satellite is designed for delayed
delivery of messages, comparable to a land-line telegraph or
teletype system, provision has been built into the Courier
enabling instantaneous relay of messages between two
ground stations which can see the satellite simultaneously.

The precision of control over the satelli~te’s equipment
was made possible by its built-in digital logic system, called
the command decoder. Designed to use logic modules, the
command decoder checks all incoming signals and com-
mands with regard to procedural correctness, signal strength
adequacy, and compatability with the sa,tellite’s function-
ing at that instant. It routes any acceptable command to
the appropriate equipment and then initiates a coded ac-
knowledgement signal which is transmitted back to the

ground station.

As the satellite orbits the earth it passes over a ground
station in a predictable manner. During a pass, the following
typical sequence of events takes place: the horizontal sector
from which the satellite Miss is expected is illuminated by
the ground station antenna, operating at VHF. As the low

11

powered acquisition beacon in the satellite appears in the
antenna field, a coded command is initiated by the ground
stations to switch the satellite from a “stand by” to an “ac-
tive” mode of operation. This command activates a VHF
satellite transmitter, which will begin to radiate after a
short warm up period. The satellite VHF acquisition trans-
mitter is switched off and the high powered satellite VHF
telemetry transmitter begins to transmit telemetry data to
the ground station. After the ground station receives ac-
knowledgment of its first command, the ground antenna
goes into a “scan” mode at microwave frequency. When
the satellite microwave signal appears in the beam of the
ground antenna, the ground station automatically begins
to track the satellite.

Commands to the space station, after the command
to activate, are made through the microwave link. Each
command is preceded by a code which is changed in accord-
ance with a predetermined method of operation. In event
of fading or other loss of signal, the satellite automatically
returns to the acquisition mode and the process may then
be repeated. Data relay or exchange is accomplished during
the 10 to 15 minute period in which the satellite is within
range of the ground station. The satellite is then commanded
to return from “active” to “stand by” condition.

The satellite is powered by the sun’s rays. In outer
space the sun is not a diffused shower of rays as on the
earth. Rather, it is a tiny line of energy striking only
one side of the satellite at a time. Accordingly, a compli-
cated solar outer shell consisting of some 20,000 individual
cells wired together, provides an unprecedented 62 watts of
power. This is equivalent to the amount of power necessary
to illuminate a living room lamp bulb twenty-four hours a
day.

The silicon solar cells which produce this power are

fastened to the surface of the Courier satellite. These semi-
conductors convert solar energy into electrical power to
operate the electronic equipment within the satellite. Solar
cells are soldered into shingles comprised of seven cells each.

Twelve shingles are connected in series and attached by
adhesives to a curved fiberglass base, or array, which is in
turn fastened to a hemispherical cover of the satellite. These
arrays are connected in parallel to form the complete solar
battery.

Two separate and independent sets of solar arrays are
provided on the Courier. Each one charges a nickel cadmium
storage battery which permits higher peak power loads than
the solar arrays can supply. The batteries also provide a
means whereby the satellite can operate when it is in the
earth’s shadow.

The outer shell of the satellite functions as a support
for the cell arrays and as a shield for heat control and
meteorite erosion. The design consists of two lightweight
hemispheres joined ‘together at the inner structure equa-
torial band with detachable fasteners to establish a form
which is approximately spherical in shape. Major access to
the inner structure and its equipment is obtained by sep-
arating the hemispheres. The hemispheres are fabricated
from a plastic honey-comb sandwich between two thin skins
of fiberglass. In addition to providing adequate strength,
the thickness of the honey-comb cellular results in an ex-
tremely rigid surface for mounting the solar cells. The
honey-comb cells are permeable to the outside of the satel-
lite to eliminate the possibility of air diffusion to the inside.
In addition to this permeability, major venting is provided
through the entire outer shell.

The inner structure of the satellite is made in the form
of welded aluminum platforms which support the various
items of equipment in the payload. The payload is almost
equally divided into message handling equipment and spare
equipment. The spare parts in most cases are to be switched
into the system by ground command if failures occur. There-

fore ultimate satellite models such as this, evolving from long»
range developmental programs, under the sponsorship of the ‘

Advanced Research Projects Agency, have approximately
a 90 percent probability of remaining operational for one
Yearﬂ

Television tape may help save your child's life

Westinghouse scientists and engineers have put together an unusual
assortment of machines with which doctors hope to write a bright
new chapter in the history of man's fight against childhood_diseases.
The machines are: A fluoroscope which uses lower radiation
intensities...to lower the exposure of the human body. A new

light amplifying system which makes the image from the fluoroscope
50,000 times brighter. And a TV camera which picks up the image as
a moving picture and records it on video tape. This can be played
back again and again until the trouble is diagnosed, or put on
television cables and shown to specialists half a world away.
Physicians hope that this machine will help them diagnose diseases
and injuries more quickly and accurately than ever before.

Have you ever seen a house walking? If you have ever
been in the coal fields of northwestern Pennsylvania, there
is a good chance you have seen walking machines much
larger than a house. The extensive yet little known strip
mining industry is one of Pennsylvania’s oldest, being more
than a hundred years old. The strategic location of coal in
this area is one of the primary reasons Pittsburgh is now the
steel center of the_world.

All coal is either deep mined or stripped. In stripping,
the overlay of dirt and rock is removed or “stripped” to get

to the coal below. This article will describe the methods and
machinery now commonly used in strip mining in northwest-
ern Pennsylvania. .

One of the major methods of removing the overburden
is to use giant “drag-lines.” These are so called because the
digging operation consists of dragging a bucket. These drag-
lines come in various sizes but are usually very large with
high capacity buckets. One thing all drag-lines have is
mobility. Some are mounted on caterpillar-like treads while
others use a very unusual “walking” technique.

The author visited two different drag-line machines in
collecting material for the article. The first machine was a
diesel-powered 1954 Paige Drag-Line owned by the Chutz
Brothers and operating outside of Harrisville, Pennsylvania.
This particular machine has two levels in the main cab. It
is equipped with a 135 ft. long boom and a 13 cubic yd.
capacity bucket.

The main power for the hoisting, dragging, and walking
is supplied by an approximately 800 HP, V-6 Diesel engine.
It operates at only 450 rpm with a 16 in. stroke and 121/2 in.
diameter pistons. One unusual feature of this engine is that
it lays on its side.

There is a smaller 350 HP, 3 cylinder engine on the sec-
ond level and it drives an electric generator. This generator
supplies power for the two swing motors, lights, and an air
compressor. The air compressor is used to supply air to the
electrically-valved air controls of the drag—line and the
swing motors are used to turn the cab and boom to either
side. The steel rope cable, used to drag the bucket, is 21/3
in. diameter and the lift cable is 17/8 in. The drag and lift
motions are braked through mechanical friction brakes and
they are started through mechanical clutches.

a shaft that extends across the cab.

Two men are required to operate the machine, one is
the operator who controls the machine, and the other is an
oiler who takes care of lubrication and some maintenance.
The oiler directs the machine’s walking progress since the
operator can not see where he is going. On this particular
job, from 10 to 15 thousand tons of coal are mined each
month and it takes the removal of about 10,000 yds. of over-
burden per day to get this production.

It is -easy to see why a quick and cheap means of remov-
ing dirt is needed when the average depth of overburden is
about 60 ft. on this job and the coal thickness is only 4 feet.
The Paige can dig down as deep as 100 ft. and make an
80 ft. wide cut.

The other machine visited was a 1951 Marion 7400
drag-line owned by the Buckeye Coal Company. This drag-
line has a 185 ft. long boom and a 13 yd. bucket and weighs
1,235,000 pounds. It has a dumping radius of 175 ft.,
dumping height of 73 ft., and an average of 14,000 yds. of
overburden removal per day. It uses a lift cable of 134 in.
diameter and a drag cable of 2%; in. diameter and can exert
a drag pull of 120,000 lbs. on the bucket. The lift cable and
boom is capable of picking up a total of 62,500 lbs. in bucket

LUBRICATION OF THE MOVING PARTS is a vital operation
in keeping a drag-line in operation.

and overburden. It can dig 120 ft. down and over 100 ft.
across. This machine also “walks” and can take 6 ft. steps.
Power is brought to the machine through a 2,500 ft., 4
wire, 3 phase covered cable with a neutral wire. Current is
supplied at 4,160 volts AC. This AC current is used in a 750
HP synchronous motor that in turn drives a 375 KW gen-
erator, two 85 KW generators and a 125 V exciter generator.
The 375 KW generator supplies power to the main 425
HP, 230 volt DC drag and hoist motor. The two 85 KW
generators drive two 94 HP, 230 volt DC swing motors. The
swing motors swing this boom and main cab around on the
main platform. The 125 volt generator is used to provide
power for the magnetic fields in the main DC generator.
With the use of the cable and subsidiary transformer sub-
station, the electric drag-line can operate up to 2 miles from
the main utility source. The biggest drag-lines are usually
operated like this from exterior electrical sources rather than
internal diesel powered sources.

However, drag-lines are only designed to dig loose dirt
and rock. They do not dig well through hard packed soil or
solid rock formations. So the earth must be loosened by
drilling and blasting before the drag-line can dig. The drill-
ing is done by a large rotary drilling unit. The one described
here is a larger type and can drill through 50 ft. of solid
rock in about 20 minutes. The diesel engine on the drilling
rig is used to drive hydraulic pumps, and an air compressor.
The drill is turned by hydraulic motors and air is blown
through the drill stem to blow out the dust.

HERE IS A VIEW OF the Marion 7400 drag-line dumping a
load of dirt.

DRILLING RIGS such as this drill continuously so that blast-
ing can be used to loosen the earth.

Everything on the drilling rig is hydraulically powered.
The drill stem is lifted and driven down by hydraulic mo-
tors. Using hydraulic power for everything has resulted in
much less breakage through smoother power transmission to
the drill bit, and reduced shock effects.

After the holes are drilled, an explosive such as am-
monium nitrate (fertilizer) is tamped in the holes and
detonated. The blast breaks up the rock and soil and allows
the drag-line to operate much more efficiently.

The drag-lines remove the loose soil and work down
to the coal seam. Then the last remaining dirt on the seam
is carefully removed by highlifts or bulldozers. When all the
dirt is removed, power shovels are brought up to the edge
of the coal seam and begin to load the coal into trucks
brought down into the pit. The power shovel pictured is a
diesel-powered 1% yd. capacity machine. While the pic-
tured trucks are dual-axle 15 ton capacity, it only takes 6
or 7 shovel fulls to load each truck.

The coal is carried from the pits by these trucks. Next
stop for the coal is the tipple. Here the coal is sorted and
rocks picked from it. Then the coal is put into railroad cars
to be taken to buyers.‘

This is the way coal is usually strip mined in north-
western Pennsylvania. Coal mining is a large and extensive
industry employing a large labor force of highly skilled men
to operate the machinery. The heavy equipment used is
among the largest and most expensive built in America.
Strip mining is rapidly evolving into a highly efficient and
scientific industry using the latest possible methods for the
lowest possible costs. With new uses for coal being discovered,
coal mining may again become a major industry in the tri-
state area of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.

Back in 1925, when Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the ﬁrst of its family of
history—making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.

That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&WA today.

The ﬁeld, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company’s requirements
conﬁned to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt & Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of ﬂight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.

Speciﬁcally, what would you do?—y0ur own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can ﬂourish.

For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement oﬁicer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,

A “stream-of-action” environment with unusual growth
possibilities should be a major factor in a choice of
career. And that’s an excellent reason for considering
carefully the opportunities existing in Sikorsky Aircraft.

We believe that our company is just the “right-sized
stream”. Young engineers can enjoy diversiﬁed, small-
group activities, as well as stature opportunities in a
ﬁeld that is wide open to the expression of imagination
and professional competence.

Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the
modern helicopter. Our current program is far-ranging
and is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.

Work associations are stimulating and in an atmosphere
of progress. Assignments could include joining an elec-
tronic team of twenty to thirty associates—or—working
with a highly selective group of four or ﬁve on interest-
ing problems of radiation, instrumentation, auto pilot-
age, automatic stabilization, etc.

If you want to enter this “stream-of-action”; the time is
now. Opportunities for personal progress have never
been greater.

excitement——Engineering.

He got what he bargained for (and a little
more) when he joined Paciﬁc Telephone. One of
Stu’s early assignments was to ﬁnd out how
existing Long Distance networks could be used
to pipeline high speed “conversations” between
computers in distant cities.

The fact that he did a ﬁne job did not go
unnoticed.

phone career, Senior Engineer Stuart Smith

We in America owe much to the motor car. The design,
engineering, and workmanship of the modern automobile
make it safe and reliable when used properly. But with al-
most 40,000 lives lost in traffic accidents every year, it is
clear that improper use of the automobile is an epidemic
of national proportions. Since the first automobile chugged
noisily down cobblestone streets, more than 62,000,000 killed,
crippled and maimed Americans have inscribed their names
on the nation’s roll call of senseless slaughter. More have
died on the highways than on our nation’s battlefields.
More have been injured than in all the world wars com-
bined. Accidents are caused by people—the people who mis-

judge road conditions and speed, who let their attention
wander, or who grossly disregard the rules of the road and
good driving practices. As long as people persist in such
errors on our streets and highways, any of us can be in-
volved in a serious accident caused by someone else’s careless
driving.

The way motorists are knocked about in accidents is a
cause of grave concern to safety and traffic experts as well
as automotive engineers. Motor companies, universities, the
Air Force and leading organizations concerned with safety
have done a great amount of research and have suggested
quite a few interior refinements. As a result of these sug-
gestions the automotive industry has introduced padded
dashboards and visors, head rest, recessed steering wheel,
and in particular, safety belts in the American passenger
car. A close look at all of these reveals that each merits
consideration.

Often upon collision the passengers are thrown for-
ward. By padding the dashboard and sun visors, the chance
of a severe injury in these areas is lessened. But the area
between these two, the windshield, which is usually the
obstacle that is struck, cannot be padded and offers no
protection. Therefore, although the use of padding on the
dashboard and sun visors is useful, it alone is of little use.

Frequently after impact the occupant will fall back
against the seat. The back rest is only shoulder high and the
force of the fall will very often snap the occupant’s neck
since there is nothing to restrain the motion of his head at
the same time his body is being restrained. Increasing the
height of the back rest would solve this but it is not practical
since it would obstruct the rear view of the occupants. This
can be solved by putting a head rest where the occupant
usually sits which would not decrease his rear view. How-
ever, there is no guarantee that when he leaves his seat he
will come back in the same place. Therefore, the head rest

is useful, but by itself useless.
The recessed steering wheel is an example of a device

which is useful by itself. It is now standard equipment on
all modern automobiles and has greatly reduced a major
cause of injury and death. The top of the steering post on
older cars is in the same plane as the wheel, whereas when
the driver is thrown forward his chest is crushed against
the immovable post. With the post recessed below the plane
of the wheel, the driver’s forward motion is retarded by the
wheel and not the post. Even if the wheel should break under
impact it will decrease the acceleration force of the driver.
The importance of this device is perhaps shown in the fact
that it is the only recent innovation to be used by the auto-
motive industry as standard and not as optional equipment.

Injuries tend to be worse when a person is thrown from
the car; new safety door latches help restrain him. Re-
search crash studies, using actual vehicles, demonstrated
that doors frequently opened, even during relatively low-
speed collisions and permitted the occupants to be ejected
from the car. Investigation showed that the door latching
elements slipped out of engagement because of the dif-
ferential movement between the door and body which oc-
cured during an Impact. Various latch designs were

that holds and pillor securely together. Tests show they will
hold doors closed under three times as much impact as those
formerly used.

developed to provide a longitudinal engagement between
the door and body latching elements. F ull-scale crash studies
demonstrated that such double-grip latches resisted separa-
tion of the lock components during a collision and the door
remained closed. These latches are, by no means foolproof;
Under excessive impact these latches would simply shear
apart but under the lessor load that is applied in the
majority of accidents they will hold up fine in most in-
stances.

The most effective single item of protective equipment
presently available to reduce traffic injuries and death is the
automotive seat belt. Thousands of lives are lost each year
because people are thrown against windshields or out of car

doors by the impact of collisions. Your chance of being killed
in an accident are five times greater if you are thrown from
the vehicle. A seat belt will keep you in the car.

Careful analysis of actual highway accidents made by
the Automotive Crash Injury Research Division of Cornell
University clearly indicates the advantages of seat belts.

Using a “paired comparison” technique, Cornell match-
ed identical accidents except for the one control factor that
in one car the occupant was wearing a seat belt and in the
other he was not. The comparison of these accidents showed:
75.5 percent of the people without belts had an injury to
some degree; 25 percent of the people in cars without belts

had an injury that was listed as moderate to severe; 3.6
percent were fatal.

In the identical accidents where seat belts were worn,
analysis showed: 29.9 percent of the people had an injury
to some degree; only 9.2 percent of the people had an injury
that was listed as moderate to severe; and only 1 percent
of the accidents were fatal.

The above case referred only to accidents where the per-
sons remained inside the car. Using again a “paired compari-
son” technique, automotive crash injury research found that
of the ejectees, 87 percent had an injury to some degree; 53.7
percent had an injury classified as moderate to severe; and
17.4 percent were fatal.

Comparing these victims with those in similar acci-
dents except that they were not ejected because they were
wearing seat belts, automotive crash injury research figures
show: 39.9 percent had an injury to some degree; 10.9
percent had an injury listed as moderate to severe; and 2.2
percent were fatal.

The Ford Motor Company has run identical test crashes
using dummies. In one case the dummy was belted and in

the other the dummy was not belted. Through electronic in-
struments, the amount of force applied during the crash to
different parts of the anatomy was recorded. These tests
showed that, although a person wearing a belt might still
strike a barrier within the car, the amount of force with
which he would strike would be substantially reduced, there-
by reducing the degree of potential injury.

This points to the previously mentioned padded dash
and visors which if used in conjunction with a seat belt can
add much to the safety of the occupant in the car.

Also with the use of seat belts the occupant remains in
the same position making head rests more practical.

Contrary to popular notion, seat belts offer -great pro-
tection at moderate speeds. More than half of the accidents
causing injury or death involve speeds of less than 40 miles
per hour. Your seat belt can prevent or lessen injury and
may save your life.

Many people mistakenly believe that they don’t need
seat belts because they drive mostly in their own communi-
ties rather than on long trips. But the figures show that
three out of four traffic deaths occur within 25 miles of
home. Your seat belt can protect you in town as well as on
the highway.

Less than 1% of all injury-producing accidents involve
fire or submersion to any degree. Contrary to widely held
beliefs, seat belts greatly improve your chances of surviving
even such an accident. A seat belt can be unfastened in an
instant with one hand. Your seat belt can increase your
chances of remaining conscious, so you can get clear of a
submerged or burning car.

A seat belt contributes to good posture by holding you
erect in your seat, and makes an automobile trip much less
tiring because you aren’t slipping sideways or forward.

According to the Ford Motor Company the use of seat
belts in all cars and trucks on the American road today

would reduce the 40,000 fatalities annually to less than 19,-
000, and would reduce the 1 million serious injuries to no
more than 500,000. Although Ford Motor Company and
the other manufacturers recognize the value of seat belts,
they feel that there is apathy on the part of the public to
buy them and use them.

Shoulder harness in conjunction with a seat belt would
be even better but they are much more cumbersome and
most people would not bother with either then.

The cost of seat belts is low, the benefits of comfort and
protection are high . . . seat belts are much like insurance,
but more important. Insurance protects your pocketbook . . .
seat belts protect the lives of you and your family. Smart
drivers have both.

Fasten your seat belt before you turn on the ignition
and keep it fastened whenever your car is in motion.

Paul Farbanish (B.S.E.E., Lehigh '58) is a development eno
gineer with design responsibilities for IBM's new solid state
1401 computer system.

HE'S MAPPING NEW WAYS TO BEAT
TRAFFIC JAMS IN LOGICAL SYSTEMS  

A computer system must be versatile. The IBM 1401 sys-
tem, for instance, might go to work in a radiation lab, a
stockbrokerage office, an air operations center, a refinery,
or any one of a hundred other places. Demands upon the
individual units of the system will vary widely.

Paul Farbanish analyzes the loads placed on the system by
different applications. One of his assignments is to design
new and alternate ways for data to move from unit to unit
with the greatest speed and reliability.

Like many an engineer at IBM, his responsibility ranges
over a wide technical field. To do his job he has become
familiar with many challenging areas of electronics. Within
the 1401 system alone he dealt with circuits, data flow
control, input-output, storage, etc.

If a young engineer wants to move rapidly into the most
advanced areas of electronics, he would do well to consider
IBM. In the fast-expanding world of data systems and its
many peripheral fields, a man is given all the responsibility
he is able to handle. New ideas and new ways of doing
things are not only welcome but actively encouraged.

The IBM representative will be interviewing on your campus
this year. He will be glad to discuss with you the many chal-
lenging jobs that are open at lBM—whether in development,
research, manufacturing, or programming. Your placement
office will make an appointment for you. Or you may write,

COLLEGE GRADUATES: Are You Happy With Your
Job Choice .................................. ..

In the Spring of 1959 a class in Industry 14-3—Human
Relations, decided to make a small pilot study in the field
of job selection by graduating Seniors. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the reaction of college graduates to
various factors connected with their first jobs following
graduation.

Heavy reliance was placed on a study done by Opinion
Research which sought to determine the most important
factors which influence the college senior in the choice of
his first job. Many surveys have been made to determine
what factors are regarded as most important. In general,
they have come up with about the same list of factors.

However, a cursory search of the literature of college
placement has not revealed any study determining how the
college graduate felt about these factors at least one year
after beginning work on his first job.

For example, if a college graduate felt that “chance for
advancement” should be a very important factor in his job
choice, did he feel that he had made a wise choice one year
later in so far as chance for advancement was concerned?
In a like manner, other factors that theoretically determined
the graduates choice of a job were included in a question-
naire sent to a number of college graduates.

One hundred and seven (107) letters with question-

naires were sent out to Engineering Graduates of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh in the Class of 1959. Each member of the
committee (seven in all) also took ten letters and question-
naires and agreed to give them to employees of the company
where he worked.

A preliminary survey showed that some employees were
fearful that their superiors would learn about any dissatis-
faction and discipline them for their frankness. In view of
this anxiety on the part of employees it was agreed that
questionnaires should be returned anonymously. To make
this plan practical, an envelope addressed to the Placement
Service was given to each employee.

Employees were invited to make extended remarks or
comments on a few lines at the bottom of the questionnaire.

One hundred and seventy-seven (177) questionnaires
were mailed or given to college graduates who had worked a
minimum of one year and not more than five years on the
first job obtained through a college placement office or
through direct application by the college graduate. Seventy-
three (73) questionnaires were returned. Sixteen (16) re-
spondents saw fit to make comments on their questionnaires.

Replies to the questionnaire were received from seventy-
three graduates. The results are presented in tabular form
below. They reveal a generally happy group of workers who
seem to feel that they have found satisfaction in their job
choices.

Although the results of the survey reveal a general satis-
faction with the various job factors which college graduates
deem important, there are four clearly defined areas of dis-
content.

The first area is concerned with the interest of top
management in the college graduate worker as a person.
Twenty-one respondents indicated by their “No” answers
that they did not believe that top management was inter-
csted in them as persons.

Another area of discontent concerned the quality of
supervision. Twenty-one respondents said that they did not
have a “high regard for the quality of supervision carried
on by their immediate superiors”.

The third area where respondents indicated they were
not satisfied concerned the matter of compensation. While
almost all studies indicate that salary is not a prime con-
sideration in job choice, it is not a matter of indifference.
Consequently, replies of twenty respondents indicated that
they “did not feel adequately compensated for their services.”

Showboat

The traditional homecoming festivities at the University
of Pittsburgh featured the fraternity-sorority float parade.
Each float had to conform with the general theme, Broad-
way Shows, and also had to have an association with the
Pitt-West Virginia football game.

Eachgroup was confronted with similar problems when
attempting to build a float, many of which can be a test of
an Engineer’s basic skill.

The first and possibly hardest problem was deciding on
a theme. A joint meeting was held. between the fraternity
and sorority to do this. The idea of building the float around
the show “Streetcar Named Desire” was mentioned and dis-
cussed, but later discarded. When “Showboat” was men-
tioned it seemed that everybody got the same idea at the
same time. It was unanimously decided to build a Mississippi
River stern wheeler called “Showboat.” The choice of this
theme and the emphasis on motion, beauty, fluffiness and
perception of theme resulted in a first place float for Chi
Omega and Phi Kappa Theta this year.

Ken Wilmot and Steve Pearson, Phi Kappa Theta’s
Homecoming co-chairmen, began by purchasing 140,000 pa-

per napkins and 450 ft. of chicken wire. In order to obtain
the effect of flowers, the napkins were inserted in the chicken
wire and stapled to each other. This long and tedious process
was the course of action for the next three weeks.

Actual construction started two weeks before the dead-
line. The construction was done on a 25 ft. flat bed truck
which was borrowed from Miller Heck Construction Com-
pany. The main body of the boat was made of 2x6’s and
other structures were made of 2x4’s. The bow was made of
2x6’s angled to form a point. A steel cable was fastened to
the bow and then anchored to two solid vertical metal bars,
two inches in diameter, at the top of the cab.

Resting on the bow were two barrels spinning on edge,
one on top of the other, giving the illusion of toppling over.
Sitting on top of the spinning barrels was a West Virginia
Mountaineer. The Pitt Panther was lying on the deck spin-
ning the barrels with a kick of his foot. Jack Murphy 
’6l) and Steve Zehala (CE. ’61) worked out this idea by
placing the barrels on a pipe and using roller skate wheels
for bearings so the wheels would ride on the frame. This pipe
was turned by a crank beneath the bow. An interesting side-
light was seen when Steve loosely hinged the legs of the West
Virginian causing them to fly out by centrifugal force when
rotated. By varying the speed of rotation the legs could be
moved up and down.

Directly behind the bow was the cargo which was made
of paper mached chicken wire painted to resemble beer kegs.
This idea was incorporated primarily to cover the hood of
the truck.

On the right side of the Showboat were stairs leading to
the pilot’s house. “Boo-Boo” Bear was to walk up these stairs,
turn around at the top, and come down again. Among the
methods proposed for doing this, two seemed most logical;
either to have the figure fastened to a roller skate and pulled
up by a system of pulleys, or to have him pushed up and
down with a broom handle from inside the float.

The latter was finally accepted due to its relative sim-
plicity.

“Showboat”, sat majestically in the pilot’s house with his
head out of the window and waving his hand at the sight-

scers like a political candidate. This arm was moved by
pivoting a broom handle on the shoulder which acted as a
simple lever. The only difficulty that arose was trying to
squeeze the freshly painted 18” head through a 14” window.

On the side of the “Showboat” were three doors from
which popped the heads of Pixie, Dixie and Jinx, the Cat.
The doors were hinged and could be pushed open or pulled
shut from the inside by a long %” steel concrete reinforcing
rod.

On the back of the “Showboat” stood Yogi Bear wav-
ing his hand which was manipulated by a lever inserted
through the wall of the Showboat. His head turned to and
fro and was maneuvered by wires attached to the neck
which were pulled at set intervals.

On the roof of the second deck were two blue smoke
stacks puffing white smoke. Enough smoke was created by
a single Carbon Dioxide extinguisher to provide the desired
effect.

The paddle wheel in the stern presented many prob-
lems. First, the outer rims had to be cut from plywood in

the most economical manner; secondly it had to be mounted
so as to be free to rotate and still be strong enough to stay
coupled; and third was the problem of rotation.

Sam Frick (A.E. ’61) worked this out by cutting a rim
in quarter sections from four pieces of plywood. These sec-
tions were then mounted on two 2x4’s which were cut the
diameter of the wheel. These 2x4’s served as spokes of the
wheel and were connected by mortise and tenon to form an
X.The remaining four spokes were cut on a 45° angle and
connected by butt joints. The assembled spokes were secure-
ly connected by placing steel plates on each side of the hub
and bolting them together. A two-inch pipe was then placed
through the centers of the two wheels and rested on light
construction girders which were anchored to the truck. The
paddles, which were the length of the two inch pipe, were
inserted into the notched rims. The ideas of propelling the
paddle wheel by means of belt and pulley or‘sprocket and
chain had to be discarded because of lack of equipment. Fin-
ally it was decided to use a pledge in the float turning the

wheel by hand. His arms were painted purple to have them
blend in with the back of the float.

The sound system was set up by Tom Cook  ’63).
It consisted of a generator, a Webcor 2010 tape recorder, and
an amplifier. Because of its toxic fumes the generator had to
be mounted on the underside of the truck. This, however,
was not much of an improvement because it could not be
mounted with its exhaust to the rear and the fumes still
found their way into the truck bed. One of the two 15”
speakers for the amplifiers was mounted on the top of the
cab of the truck and the other in the stern of the boat. The
song “Old Man River” that had been pre-recorded on tape
from the “Showboat” album was played during the float
parade.

The chicken-wire and napkins were stapled to the 500
board feet of frame and painted with water base paint and
spray guns.

Although only a few of the difficulties are mentioned
in this article, every engineer can recognize the many hours
spent and the great deal of experience gained working on

PHOTOMULTIPLIER ION GAUGE

Scientists of Westinghouse Electric Corporation recently
devised a laboratory tool for the measurement of pressures
less than one-thousandth of one-billionth of. the atmospheric
pressure at the earth's surface. The device focuses a beam of
ultraviolet light which stimulates the metal surface to release
electrons. These electrons are guided onto a series of similar
s'urfaces which multiply the electrons in speed and number.
The electlrons are then used to form ions that are collected
and counted. The series of surfaces which release the electrons
and increase their number is called a photomultiplier, from
which the name of the new pressure-measuring instrument is
derived.

SEMI-AUTOMATIC TONGS

Semi-automatic tongs are saving time and reducing the
probability of accidents, during the construction of the New
Cumberland Darn, at Stratton, Ohio. By overcoming powerful
skin friction, they are able to extract sheet piles 60 feet long
and 16 inches wide from the Ohio River bed. These piles have
been driven deep into the river bed to form a cofferdam. In
the past, the removal of these piles has usually required some-
one to run the pin of a clevis through a hole in the top of
each pile. The Dravo Corporation, which is building the dam,
has found that these tongs eleminate this hazardous time con-
suming job.

WATER REPELLENT RESIN

A water repellent resin called Dri-Film 144 has been
developed by General Electric Company. Made especially for
use in masonry water repellent formulations, this silicon resin
offers performance superior to regular grades at no increase
in cost. Treated paper resists sticky substances, and is easily
pealed from asphalt. Water droplets are unable to penetrate
the treated masonry surfaces of the brick on the left. The
untreated brick on the right absorbed the water immediately.

AUTOMATED BELT CALENDAR

America's first higeh-speed automated belt calendering sys-
tem has been built by Goodyear. This electronically controlled
unit has two X-ray devices which insure uniform thickness of
the belt as it passes through the calendar. The two story unit,
with a four roll calender, costs $1,600,000 and has a daily capa-
pacity of two to three miles of high-quality belting. It is
designed for a maximum width of 72 inches, a maximum roll
diameter of 156 inches, a maximum weight of 20 tons. Already
in operation, it has produced a continuous piece of belting
almost half a mile long, the longest made to this date.

sandwich one day. The waitress said
“just a minute until I see the chef.” She‘
hustled out to the kitchen to the owner
who was also the chef. “Get ready to
shell out ten bucks, there’s a truck joe-
key out front who has ordered an ele-
phant ear sandwich.” The chef looked
at her and exclaimed. “Do you mean to
tell me we are out of elephant ears?”

“No,” said the waitress, “but we’re
out of those big buns.”

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Spreading the magic of hse skilled hands

JANUARY I96!

Given native ability, years of experience—and time-the
craftsmen of~grandfather’s day could work miracles of pre-
cision in wood and metal, using simple hand tools.

But craftsmen like that were too few—and too costly—to
ﬁll the demands of a rapidly growing nation wanting more of
everything fast, at prices most people could afford.

So engineering minds looked for ways to build craftsman-
like precision and skill into machines that could be used by
less skilled workers to build the many things America needed.
This is how the first Delta Power Tool came into being, almost
forty years ago. It was a simple scroll saw, but with it even a
child could cut intricate patterns in wood.

Today there are 62 different Delta woodworking and metal-
working tools, ranging from a very modern scroll saw to pre-
cision metal lathes, and including a new radial drill that does
things impossible with any other drill press. Engineering, of
course, was vital in developing every one of these tools, and
it is engineers who keep the world’s most complete line of
power tools also the most modern in the world.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like
to work for, buy from and invest in.

THE ENGINEER’S LAMENT

The engineer sat on his high-back-
ed stool,

Madly plying his compass and rule,

His face was drawn like a window
shade,

Thinking of drawings still unmade.

“Unfinished Jobs” were piled up
high,

“One 1nore,” he cried”, — I'll be
fit to tie!

When the telephone clanged and
over the wire

Came the raucous voice, surcharg-
ed with ire:—-

‘Where is that drawing due last
week?-

Must we drag it out of your hide
with a jeep?

What are you doing—poker
playing?

Act like a hen;—come on, .start
laying!”

The Engineer vainly tried to ex-
plain

But the voice went on AGAIN and
AGAIN:—

“Those drawings you made for the
B-2 Chucker,

Played our production line for a

sucker.”

“Cam motions are wrong — they go
up, not down;

To assemble that mess would take
a clown.

You can't put a screw where you
have no stock,

And you can't mill steel that's hard
as a rock.”

And so went the wail till the air
got blue,

Then our hero put in a word or
two:—-

“Lay off,” he cried, "let’s have no
more,

We’ve heard that song many times
before.”

“They gave us the spec sheets late
on Sunday,

And wanted the layout finished on
Monday.

But a month went by before any-
one knew.

Exactly what the machine was to
do.

Meanwhile we all had to guess and
grope

And do what we could with scanty
dope.

Till everyone here was a nervous
wreck,

Then we calle(l you in for double
check.

You checked each tolerance, you
checked each fit,

You checked the assembly bit by bit

Each operation on each machine

Got your okay - that's what I mean.

Yet whatever goes sour along the
line

Is charged to the engineer's design,

Followitne drawings and go to
work!”

Here, he hung up the phone with
an angry jerk.

This job, he sighed, goes from
brawl to brawl.

As he gazed at the motto on the
wall

Phelps,

Some people sow their wild oats

church on Sunday and pray for

—you'll find Photography at Work with you

THE engineer working in elec-
tronics ﬁnds photography one of
his most valuable tools. For ex-
ample, he uses camera and ﬁlm
to capture and study the ﬂeeting
transient on the oscilloscope face.

X-rays and ﬁlm provide him
with a check on the internal in-
tegrity of sealed components.
Even intricate circuits can be
printed and miniaturized by
photographic methods.

There’s hardly a ﬁeld on

which you can set your sights
where photography does not play
a part in simplifying work and
routine. It saves time and costs
in research, on the production
line, in the engineering and sales
department, in the ofﬁce.

So in whatever you plan to
do, take full advantage of all the
ways photography can help.

Q. Why does your company have train-

ing programs, Mr. Abbott?

A. Tomorrow’s many positions of major
responsibility will necessarily be ﬁlled by
young men who have developed their
potentials early in their careers. General
Electric training programs simply help
speed up this development process.

In addition, training programs provide
graduates with the blocks of broad ex-
perience on which later success in a
specialization can be built.

Furthermore, career opportunities and
interests are brought into sharp focus
after intensive working exposures to
several ﬁelds. General Electric then gains
the valuable contributions of men who
have made early, well-considered deci-
sions on career goals and who are con-
ﬁdently working toward those obj ectives.

Q. What kinds of technical training pro-
grams does your company conduct?

A. General Electric conducts a number
of training programs. The G-E programs
which attract the great majority of
engineering graduates are Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and Tech-
nical Marketing.

Q. How long does the Engineering and
Science Program last?

A. That depends on which of several
avenues you decide to take. Many gradu-
ates complete the training program dur-
ing their ﬁrst year with General Electric.
Each Program member has three or four
responsible work assignments at one or
more of 61 different plant locations.
Some graduates elect to take the Ad-
vanced Engineering Program, supple-
menting their work assignments with
challenging Company-conducted study
courses which cover the application of
engineering, science, and mathematics to
industrial problems. If the Program mem-
ber has an analytical bent coupled with a
deep interest in mathematics and physics,
he may continue through a second and

Technical Training Programs
at General Electric

third year of the Advanced Engineering
Program.

Then there is the two-year Creative
Engineering Program for those graduates
who have completed their ﬁrst-year
assignments and who are interested in
learning creative techniques for solving
engineering problems.

Another avenue of training for the
qualiﬁed graduate is the Honors Program,
which enables a man to earn his Master’s
degree within three or four semesters at
selected colleges and universities. The
Company pays for his tuition and books,
and his work schedule allows him to earn
75 percent of full salary while he is going
to school. This program is similar to a
research assistantship at a college or
university.

Q. Just how will the Manufacturing
Training Program help prepare me for
a career in manufacturing?

A. The three-year Manufacturing
Program consists of three orientation
assignments and three development
assignments in the areas of manufacturing
engineering, quality control, materials
management, plant engineering, and
manufacturing operations. These assign-
ments provide you with broad, funda-
mental manufacturing knowledge and
with specialized knowledge in your
particular ﬁeld of interest.

The practical, on-the-job experience
offered by this rotational program is sup-
plemented by participation in a manu-
facturing studies curriculum covering
all phases of manufacturing.

Q. What kind of training would I get
on your Technical Marketing Program?

A. The one-year Technical Marketing
Program is conducted for those graduates
who want to use their engineering knowl-

edge in dealing with customers. After
completing orientation assignments in
engineering, manufacturing, and market-
ing, the Program member may specialize
in one of the four marketing areas: appli-
cation engineering, headquarters market-
ing, sales engineering, or installation and
service engineering.

In addition to on-the-job assignments,
related courses of study help the Program
member prepare for early assumption of
major responsibility.

Q. How can I decide which training
program I would like best, Mr. Abbott?

A. Well, selecting a training program is
a decision which you alone can make. You
made a similar decision when you selected
your college major, and now you are
focusing your interests only a little more
sharply. The beauty of training programs
is that they enable you to keep your
career selection relatively broad until you
have examined at ﬁrst hand a number of
specializations.

Furthermore, transfers from one Gen-
eral Electric training program to another
are possible for the Program member
whose interests clearly develop in one
of the other ﬁelds.

Personalized Career Planning
is General Electric’s term for the
selection, placement, and pro-
fessional development of engi-
neers and scientists. If you would

ning folder which describes in
more detail the Company’s train-
ing programs for technical gradu-
ates, write to Mr. Abbott at Sec-
