WHO'S THE SEX OBJECTP

“I said nothing about a woman’s whole mind. I
spoke of her view of Man as a separate sex. It is
no more cynical than her view of herself as above
all things a Mother. Sexually, Woman is Nature’s
contrivance for perpetuating its highest
achievement. Sexually, Man is Woman’s con-
trivance for fulfilling Nature’s behest in the
most economical way. She knows by instinct
that far back in the evolutional process she
invented him, differentiated him, created him in
order to produce something better than the
single-sexed process can produce. Whilst he

fulfills the purpose for which she made him, he is

welcome to his dreams, his follies, his ideals, his
heroisms, provided that the keystone of them all
is the worship of woman, of motherhood, of the

family, of the hearth.” (Quote from “Man And

Superman" by George Bernard Shaw)

The news that the Techni Cutie will not be in the next issue of
“Skyscraper Engineer” has triggered an uprising in the School of
Engineering. Four days after the decision was made to drop the feature,
a petition with 570 names affixed was on my desk. The
ﬂood of boisterious engineers thought that I and f or the Engineering
Department were being pushed around by Women’s Lib.

The truth is that after much discussion and thought at the meeting
of the Executive Committee of the Skyscraper Engineer, I made the
decision to drop the feature. Either prior to or after the decision was
made, every one at the meeting and every member of the
“Skyscraper” staff agreed to it. No one had been pushed around or
intimidated.

Engineering has always been an almost totally male profession.
There is no justification for it continuing as such. The profession
should be more accessible to women, but women aren’t going to come
into engineering if we keep publicizing a strictly masculine image.
Skyscraper, in representing a socially aware student body, should lead
the way in reforming the profession’s image by eliminating Techni
Cutie.

Some aspects of the reaction to the dropping of the feature from the
magazine are fascinating. There’s more skin shown in “Time
Magazine” and “Women’s Day” than there has been in the
“Skyscraper.” Engineers obviously weren’t getting their jollies
creating sexual fantasies between our pages as Women’s Lib theorized.
I challenge you to find one of our old magazines with the pages stuck
together. Then, why were our technicrats so irate?

Let’s go back to the masculine image theory. When choosing a
profession, one picks an image of one’s future self. Engineering being a
very masculine profession, many students, perhaps myself included,
have picked this career primarily to wrap themselves in its mantle of
masculinity. Four times a year the featuring of a ﬂowing tressed maiden
has served to reinforce the men’s club atmosphere of the profession.
The decision to remove the ‘ ‘Techni Cutie’ ’ shook the foundations of
engineering’s image, as was evidenced by the swift accumulation of
570 names on petitions.

The engineering profession and its Godhead, the new industrial
state, could use some shaking up, and hopefully some new ideals and
objectives. Big industry, which was created by engineering skills,
plummeted toward a greater quantity of gross national product
seemingly wall-eyed to the importance of human rights, the pleas for
protection of our environment, or the concern for the general life‘
quality of Americans.

The criterion for removal of the Techni Cutie feature should be
clear and distinct. We are not concerned with the sexuality of the
feature. Any subject communicable on paper such as nudity and
profanity should be permissible subject matter for an adult publication
such as “Skyscrpaer Engineer.” The criterion for removal of the
feature is that Engineering should not be the effectively male
professional fraternity that it is and that the Skyscraper Engineer should
not be an essentially male oriented publication. If this generation of
engineers is going to be leaders in reforming their profession and
society , their campus publication should be the model and herald of the
reformation.

The “Skyscraper Engineer”, as of now, is the best media for the
dialogue of change in the University engineering community. The staff
and I hope to make it the most relevant publication on campus.

Edgar Thomson Works

   

U53. SSITEEIL
"—fw.wm»éJ»~

STATEMENT TO BE READ ~

I am a resident of Penhurst, Wilkins Township. My home is located three miles northeast of the Edgar Thompson Works of U. 5.
Steel; therefore, I lie right in the path of the prevailing southwest winds blowing over the Edgar Thompson Works. On reasonably clear
days a pinkish—brownish cloud of smoke can be seen rising from the direction of Edgar Thompson and spreading to the northeast, directly
over my house. Of course, on very hazy days the smoke is spread over a large enough area that the source is difficult to locate.

The result of this smoke cloud is a very fine gray and pink dust that settles on our house and yard. Almost every day, before our little
girl can play on her swing and slide, we have to dust them off. Our lawn furniture is always too dirty to sit on without first being cleaned.
Last Sunday I hosed off the front porch; by Monday noon the ﬂoor of the porch was too dirty to sit on.

Prior to moving to our present house, we lived in Blackridge, which is located north of the Edgar Thomson Works. Although we
used to think that area was dirty, by comparison to our present location, Blackridge was clean. The prevailing winds do not blow the smoke
from Edgar Thompson over Blackridge.

Besides the inconvenience caused by the dirt, I would like to mention the more serious problem of my family’s health. My son and
myself both suffer from allergies, and while neither of us can say we are allergic to smoke, there is no doubt that the dirt irritates our
condition. I can usually determine wind direction by the amount of runniness of my eyes and nose; the more irritated these organs, the
more from the southwest is the wind blowing. My little three year old girl cannot play outside during a southwest wind because her eyes puff
up and she develops a bad cough.

Because of these personal experiences, I strongly urge that no variance from the laws be granted.

Gasps at Citizens ’ Concern

One day in the career life of one of Pitt’s now un-
dergraduate engineers, he may be faced with a document
of the nature of the following presentation by GASP
(Group Against Smog and Polution).

Because ofthe wealth of our industrial state we have
the means to buy national security, material wealth and
a better environment. The contemporary engineer must
be aware of the effects the machines he directs have
on the environment. He should also be sensitive to the
fact that drastic changes in production methods to reduce
pollution can cause unemployment. Reduction in
pollution should be purchased with our excess wealth
and not purchased with the jobs of factory workers.
Change is necessary but change should be well managed
to cause as little unemployment as possible. The
engineer's responsibility to the life quality of society is
part ofhis professional ethics. He should evaluate his role
and ethics.

This article and future articles in this magazine
should provoke introspective thought and dialogue
within the School of Engineering. The first part of the
article is part of a statement by the Group Against
Smog and Pollution before the Air Pollution Appeals and
Variance Review Board. At the end of the article is a
summary of the Board's decision. Comment will be

501%’/ll from U.S. Steel for publication in the next
Skyscraper.

STATEMENT
BEFORE THE AIR POLLUTION APPEALS
AND VARIANCE REVIEW BOARD

JULY 1, 1970

EDGAR WORKS

I. Introduction

The purpose of this statement by the Group Against Smog and
Pollution (GASP) is to bring to the attention of the Variance Board
some of the relevant historical and technical information pertaining to
the variance request of the United States Steel Corporation, Edgar
Thomson Plant. It is the intention of GASP to present what it believes
to be a set of rational alternatives with respect to this problem and not
to advocate a particular course of action. In a separate statement GASP
will present recommendations to the Variance Board. GASP wishes to
make clear that it understands the complexity of the situation presented
to the residents of Allegheny County in their desire to maintain both
clean air and a viable economic base in the area affected by the Edgar
Thomson Plant:

1. Areas of relevant investigation by the Scientific Com-
mittee of GASP.

2. Possible approaches to the control of emissions from the
Edgar Thomson Works open hearth facility.

3. Questions which U.S. Steel should be called to answer at
the Variance Hearing of July 1, 1970, the answers to which
may bear heavily on the variance request.

4. An analysis of the possible approaches to bringing about
emission abatement and phase out activities.

II. Background and Technical Information
A. History

The Edgar Thomson Works of United States Steel Corporation is
located in North Braddock, Pa., near the junction of the Turtle Creek
and Monongahela Valleys. The Plant employs about 3,000 men during
periods of peak production. However, it has been on standby status for
virtually the entire decade of the sixties and has been shut down or cut
back severely on several occasions during this period.

The Edgar Thomson Works will be one hundred years old in
1975. The entire hot metal facility, containing 5 blast furnaces and 9
operating open hearth furnaces, is so antiquated that it can no longer be
operated economically and is a large source of uncontrolled particulate
matter in the greater Pittsburgh area. The Edgar Thomson Works has
only a few reasonably efficient facilities; the slab mill built in 1938 and
the ingot mold foundry. In the early sixties there was the distinct
possibility that Edgar Thomson and two other United States Steel
facilities would be abandoned or sold. In fact, the Donora plant has been
disposed of altogether and the Clairton works has effectively been
converted to coke and chemical processes. Until 1967 residents of the
Braddock area were convinced that the Edgar Thomson Works would
also be discarded, with the permanent loss of the occasional 3000 jobs.

Braddock, present population of about 10,000 (with about
60,000 in the surrounding hills) has slipped from third largest retail
center in the County, and has lost more than one third of its population
in the last twenty years. Decline of the Edgar Thomson Works is
probably the main reason for this community becoming a depressed
area. In recent years the Economic Development Administration of the
United States has pumped more than 1.2 million dollars into the
Braddock area, hoping by the encouragement of the frozen food in-
dustry there to restore some degree of economic prosperity. These
efforts have not met with success.

In July, 1967, E. H. Gott, at that time the new president of U.S.
Steel, announced plans for a major modernization—expansion of the
Edgar Thomson Works. Hiram Milton, president of Regional In-
dustrial Development Corporation (R.I.D.C.) considers it as one of the
most important industrial projects proposed in recent years.1In ad-
dition to improving and stabilizing the local employment situation, it is
regarded as a major stimulus to the economy of the whole region.

Governor Shafer has hailed the expansion project as another in-
dustrial achievement for Western Pennsylvania.

The development of the Edgar Thomson Works is expected to
attract satellite industries, which will contribute additional economic
benefits to the community.

It should be pointed out that taxpayers have made some con-
tribution. The property needed for the expansion could not have been
acquired without considerable financial help from government agen-
cies. The 16-acre parcel of land was sold to U.S. Steel by the County
Redevelopment Authority for $395,000 with the entire redeveloped
portion of the site costing the corporation $595,000. However, the
cost borne by Federal, State, and County governments, and the
Braddock School District is said to come to $3.3 million. It is estimated
that the entire project will cost U.S. Steel between $500 million and
$750 million.

The modernization will feature the installation of two basic oxygen
furnaces (BOF) of latest design‘, which will replace the 9 open hearths
now operational. The new furnaces will, presumably, produce greatly
reduced quantities of particulate matter. The reduction in jobs due to
the automation of the steel making operation will be more than
balanced by other features of the modernization so that the total work
force will actually increase. Future employment at the plant has been
variously estimated at between 4,000 and 6,000 people. This does not
include workers who will be hired by the satellite industries. 1

11

References have appeared in the news media to several statements
by U.S. Steel officials that the Edgar Thomson Works pollution would
cease by or in 1970 at the latest. In his original July, 1967 an-
nouncement Gott was quoted as saying, ‘ ‘We are going to clean up the
smoke at Edgar Thomson by 1970’2 U. S. Steel now claims that the
delays in acquiring the Braddock property have pushed back the
completion date for the BOF shop to July, 1971 and that air pollution
from the open hearth furnaces will continue for at least two years past
the date at which it claimed the problem would cease.

It is clear from the record of the Edgar Thomson Works that
uncertainties in many of the facets of its operations, not excluding its
air pollution activities, have been an integral part of its character.
Later on in this statement we shall examine references to the gas
cleaning and process variable changes that could have been im~
plemented by U.S. Steel when it became apparent Mr. Gott’s 1967
assertion was incorrect by several years. For now it is enough to note
that the loss of employment statements that have been repeated by
corporation representatives before the Variance Board are inconsistent
with the bright economic future it is apparent the community of
Braddock is going to enjoy.

B. Ambient Air Quality

It is currently not possible to state that the quality of the air at any
particular point in time and space in Allegheny County is a quantitative
result of the pollution from any particular set of sources, Hence, while
the Edgar Thomson’ Plant is no doubt in violation of Article XVII it is
not possible to identify what share of atmospheric pollution can be
attributed to emissions from the Edgar Thomson Works.

Nevertheless, for the residents of the eastern part of the County
the orange—red fumes emitted from the stacks of the Edgar Thomson
Works and the subsequent fall out of settleable red dust are perceived as
cause and effect. And, there is no doubt that the quantity of the
suspended particulates in the air in this section of the county is
dependent upon the rate of emissions from the Edgar Thomson Works
even if the quantitative dispersion techniques are not available for
precise identification. U.S. Steel Corporation has stated that the effect of
emissions from the Edgar Thomson Works on the ambient air quality is
considerable.

With complaints of the citizens of this area in mind, GASP has
undertaken the task of measuring the (particulate) ambient air quality
in order to quantify the intuitive and obvious degradation of it. GASP
has performed high volume suspended particulate measurements on a
systematic basis throughout the month of June in two areas of Forest
Hills. Sampling technique followed ASTM standards with equipment
and auxiliary help provided by the University of Pittsburgh.

Forest Hills is not the most polluted section of the eastern suburbs
and data could have been collected at sites closer to the plant.
Nevertheless it is clear that the annual average for Forest Hills, 139
ug/ m 3, exceeds the annual average standard adopted by Pennsylvania
by a factor or two 3. Further it is to be noted that at least several of the
readings exceeded the accepted daily standard of 195 ug / m3. The air
in Forest Hills, which has a proximity to the Edgar Thomson Works is
currently unacceptable in Pennsylvania. It should be noted that during
the week of June 8-12 an inversion occurred throughout Allegheny
County, but due to our sampling frequency GASP did not monitor the
air during this period.

The air quality affecting the citizens of Forest Hills and the neigh-
boring communities is below Pennsylvania standards, and is not being
improved by the present operation of the Edgar Thomson Works open
hearth furnaces.

C. Oxygen Lancing in the Open Hearth Furnace

1. Background and Metallurgical Considerations

Since oxygen lancing substantially increases particulate emissions
from the open hearth furnace, an examination of pertinent information
regarding the use of oxygen in open hearth steelmaking is in order.
Basically, open hearth steelmaking is a refining process in which
high excess carbon and other impurities (e.g., phosphorous and sulfur)
are oxized and carried off as gaseous effluents or entrapped in a slag
which is also descarded.

12

Oxygen lancing serves two basic purposes; namely, to speed up
the melting process and to aid in the refining period of the heat 4,5 -
During melting, heat is supplied at the Edgar Thomson Works by
burning tar and coke gas. Without oxygen lancing the efficiency of heat
transfer from the ﬂame to the charge is only on the order of 20 to 30 per
cent whereas the use of oxygen increaes the efficiency to close to 100
per cent. Also since the oxidation of many of the impurities in the melt
(notably carbon) is exothermic, oxygen itself provides a source of heat.
The overall effect is a decrease in fuel consumption of 18 to 35 per cent.

During the refining phase of the operation, oxygen injection is the
most efficient means of oxidizing the impurities. The older practice of
using iron ore containing iron oxide to supply the needed oxygen is
much slower and requires the use of more fuel. Oxygen lancing during
refining results in a decarburization rate two to three times as fast as
with the older orein g practice, which combined with the faster melting
times, results in a reduced total heat time from 10 per cent to 50 per
cent. This means that a lanced open hearth steel making furnace can
enjoy an increase in productivity of at least ‘/2 ton of steel per hour with
a fuel savings in the neighborhood of 180,000 BTU / ton of steel
produced.

However, there appears to be no metallurgical advantage to the
use of oxygen in the open hearth process?‘ The dissolved oxygen
content in the steel at the end of the refining process is the same for
lanced and unlanced steel. There are no residual benefits to the quality
of the product such as effects on the trace impurities such as
phosphorous due to lancing: In fact although oxygen speeds the refining
reactions, the critical chemical relations between the carbon, oxygen,
and slag are virtually unchanged.5Thus arguments to the effect that
oxygen lancing is mandatory for high quality open hearth steel are
unsubstantiated. The open hearth process, with or without lancing,
operates with the liquid metal supersaturated in oxygen? The resultant
cleanliness of the steel is more a function of the deoxidizing processes
operant at the end of the process (oxygen is typically removed by
adding deoxidizing materials to the ladel containing the hot liquid
poured from the open hearth) than whether the steel is refined with
oxygen from a lance or from iron ore. Steels which require extreme
purity are usually made in the electric furnace which operates closer to
the carbon oxygen chemical equilibrium line and thus produces a
cleaner product. It is noted in passing that electric furnaces may or may
not be lanced themselves and as one might suspect with the same
general air pollution implications.) In any event lancing serves a useful
economic function by increasing the productivity of the open
hearth process, but it has no effect upon the metallurgical quality of the
finished product.

2. Emissions from Lanced Open Hearth Furnaces

Absolute emissions vary widely from furnace to furnace and
therefore little agreement exists between published values of emissions.

While variations exist from furnace to furnace there is considerable
evidence that oxygen lancing causes a factor of two increase in overall
emissions. At certain times during the process, notably during the
refining period, dust loadings can be as much as an order of magnitude
higher in the lanced furnace. And, because the tap to tap time is
decreased by oxygen lancing the emission rate is further increased.

The emission problem is especially severe in the early stages of the
refining period. At this time the slag is a very viscous material and the
carbon content of the molten metal is usually greater than 0.30 per cent
(by weight). Under these conditions bursting bubbles in the slag and
general turbulence caused by oxygen impingement and gaseous
reactions products result in large scale splashing and fuming. The
resulting effluents are highly corrosive to furnace roofs, checkers and
flues, and greatly increase emissions to the atmosphere. For this reason
oxygen lancing is usually recommended only after the bath has reached
a carbon content of 0.30 per cent or less? Below this level, emissions
are still heavy but are not as destructive to the furnaces. At carbon
concentrations less than 0.l0per cent, most reaction products are liquid
and fuming.

In general, in an open hearth furnace the rate of refining
(decarburization rate) decreases as the carbon level falls towards its final
value. In both the lanced and ore refining processes the initial rate of

For engineers

of more than
engineering.

As far as Frank Betron's concerned,
involvement isn't a responsibility that
comes with success. . . it's a reward.

“I'm happy. And I'm lucky. I've got a
family I love, a beautiful home, and a
job that excites me." Frank's a Senior
Mechanical Engineer with our Business
Products Group in suburban Rochester,
New York. “Things might not have turned
out so well if I hadn't gotten a little
direction and help when I needed it. So all
I'm doing now is passing that help along
to other people.”

In this case, the “other people” are
juvenile offenders. As an active member
of the Webster Jaycees, Frank played a
pivotal role in organizing a Committee in
March 1970 to provide man-to-boy
counseling to youngsters on probation.
“| interview each one immediately after
sentencing. Then I get together with the
counselors. We discuss the youth and his
problems at length and decide which of
us is best suited for that particular case."
“For the most part, these kids just need a
little help through a troublesome time in
their lives. We try to provide that help by

building a little bit of trust between the
counselor and the boy."

The desire and need for involvement is a
very personal matter. It takes a sensitivity
to people as individuals. It takes
understanding. It takes a special kind of
man. Like Frank Betron.

Xerox is like that, too. If you seek an
environment where you're appreciated
for the person you are and the engineer
you are, why not talk to Xerox. Your

Engineers ’ Week

Governor Shapp To

Was St. Patrick an Engineer?

by: William E. Conturo
Assistant Professor, M.E.

In 1903, a group of engineering students at the University of Missouri felt that they needed a vacation from a long winter of classes, books, and
studies. They claimed that they received a “revelation” that St. Patrick was an engineer‘. In celebration of this fact, they cut all classes on St.
Patrick’s Day and engaged in various forms of fun and merriment. (They were expelled from school for 2 years for their efforts.) In 1909, Iowa State
and University of Arkansas followed Missouri’s lead and eventually most schools west of the Mississippi had celebrated Engineers’ Day which later
became a highly celebrated Engineers’ Week. Finally, the east of the Mississippi schools began carrying on the tradition of Engineers’ Week.

At Pitt, Engineers’ Week, was first observed in 1954 due mainly to the encouragement and efforts of Dr. G.R. Fitterer. The celebration has
become so extensive in scope that it is now one of the major events on the Pitt campus. St. Patrick is always a little late in arriving for his own parade
— and so the parade always begins without him. At the end of the parade route, the students, in their green derbies, are grouped together chantin g
‘ ‘We want St. Pat!’ ’ Then, by some very unusual mode of transportation St. Pat does arrive in his green robe and long white beard. In the past. he has
arrived by helicopter, in an authentic Shiek’s car complete with harem, in a dragster, in a Nike missile, on horseback, in deep-sea diving gear, an d
from a manhole in the middle ofthe street.

The arrival of St. Patrick signals the long-awaited start of a series of competitive events. On occasion this has taken the form of : a Reno
gambling casino, a mammoth monopoly game featuring Oakland properties, displays built by students of each department, a search for hidden
Shamrocks, a five legged race, a tire rolling contest, a tug-of-war, a charity service project, a debate, a brick throwing contest, a dramatization of TV
commercials, and a catch—a-live—pig contest. The climax of Engineers’ Week is the Shamrock Ball which features the crowning of St. Patricia. a
concert, and the presentation of the Shamaock Award to the winning department. After presenting the Award, St. Pat mysteriously and quietly
disappears from the campus and is not seen again until next year’s arrival parade.

Little did those engineering students back in 1903 know that their revelation would be proven true. Only recently in Ireland was an ancient
document dating back to the time of St. Patrick discovered. It contained the words “Erin Go Braugh.” This, rather loosely translated, means ‘ ‘St.
Patrick was an engineer.” Engineers further explain that there is a definite basis for their claim. After all, didn’t St. Pat drive the snakes out of
Ireland, and wasn’t that the first worm drive?

i As  can see, you can’t see our new telephone lines.

  

      

They're underground.

We think America has enough eyesores, so wher-
ever possible we're burying our new cable. And con-
verting old aerial lines.

We already have over 50% of our lines under-
ground. And before we're through we'll have about
92% buried.

We'll never reach 100% because in a few places it's
practically impossible to get the cable underground.
And in a few other places it's ridiculously expensive.

’ (

In the 15 years that we've been burying cable we've
gone through hills and high water and turnpikes and
mountains.

We've struck oil in Texas (a pipe in someone's back-
yard). And we've had to get a special repellent to keep
gophers from eating the cable.

So if you still see a fair number of telephone poles
around, bear with us. Our engineers are working as
fast as they can to bury our lines.

And resurrect our scenery.

FRESHMAN DESIGN CONTEST

A FINALE TO AN INNOVATION

IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION

Professor C.S. Beroes

During this fall’s Engineering Science I course, a design contest
was held as a finale to a new course objective —— to teach the inventive
process. The revamped program of studies had made a frontal assault on
creative design by analyzing and processing engineering innovation.
Motivated by cash prizes, competitive instinct, the prospects of local
notoriety, and an additional opportunity to earn a good grade, the
freshman engineering class used its sharpened and systematized
creative abilities on an assortment of unsolved problems.

Professors J. I. Abrams and C. S. Beroes initiated the contest this
year to put more emphasis on the design process and to excite the
interest of the freshman students in the activities with which they will
be involved once professional status has been achieved. The study of
engineering has historically been concerned with giving the nomen-
clature and mathematical techniques used in cranking out solutions to
structured textbook problems. Students could finish four years of
engineering studies and have little or no training in the methodology of
creative attack on previously unsolved problems. This method—spurred
creativity that was presented in ES I will be discussed by Professor
Beroes in a future article. This accent on the interesting design aspect
of engineering was a pleasant change for the freshman burdened with
the fundamentals of math and chemistry.

To the victors of the competition went a “niche” in Freshman
Engineering Annals as well as monetary awards. First prize was $150,
second $100, third $50, and there were six honorable mentions worth
$15 each. The eight design finalists had their final presentations
covered by the local public news media as well as various campus
publications.

20

Organization and structuring of the contest required the initiative
and cooperation of much of the Engineering faculty to keep the activity
from disintegrating into chaos. At the beginning of the competition,
the 360 students were given the options of going it alone or dividing
into groups of two or three. The following week, the teams had to
identify their selected projects. By the fourth week, the groups made
progress reports to their lab instructors. Members of the Engineering
faculty were assigned to consult with each team as to the feasability and
direction of their work. During the final lab period, each project was
judged by the students, lab instructor and faculty consultants. The best
of the projects in each lab were then considered by students in the four
lecture sections and from each two finalists were chosen. This select
nine had one week in which to groom their presentations for the finals
to be held in the auditorium of the Public Health Building on Saturday,
Dec. 12, at 9 a.m. Judges of the competition were: H. E. Griffith,
Manager of Engineering — Heinz USA, Clem Bazewski — Blaw Knox
Corporation, George Haddad, Bruce Parker — Westinghouse Electric

First Place Winner Design Contest

Preset TV Antenna Rotor System

By: A. T. BENNETT
WERNER HOEHLEIN
MARK BEAUMONT

PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

The purpose of our project is to design a television antenna rotor
control system that will automatically aim the antenna in the direction
that will provide the best reception. The rotor control system is the
electrical device that causes the rotor motor on the shaft of the antenna
located on the roof of one’s house to rotate the axis of the antenna to
the degree indicated by the control input to the system in order to
achieve the best television reception.

Although antenna rotor systems have been in use almost since the
origins of television in the late nineteen-forties, the rise of color
television that has occured over the last decade along with the increase
in the numbers of television stations in most markets throughout the
world has caused a large increase in the number of antenna rotor
systems in use as well as an increase in the complexity of the over—all
television system found in the average middle—class American home.
The requirements of reception of the more complex color signal by the
television as well as improvements in the sensitivity of television
receivers have brought about the widespread use of the highly direc-

tional Yagi-type rooftop antenna. The directional properties of this type '

of antenna make it desirable to reorient the antenna by rotation in order
to receive channels located in different directions from any one in-
dividual home. The alternative of having a different antenna for each
station in the area, as is done in some large apartment complexes, is of
course impractical due to space limitations and high cost.

The addition of an antenna rotor system to one’s television system
allows the outdoor antenna to be adjusted by the viewer as he observes
his screen for the most pleasing picture. This adjustment must be made
while the fine tuning, tint, Color, brightness, vertical hold, horizontal
hold, contrast, volume, and tone controls are also being adjusted. If the
reasonably intelligent viewer has sufficient experience and dexterity at
coordinating all of these controls and experiments long enough or is
lucky, he will eventually achieve the proper combination of settings
that will produce a pleasing picture. It has been the experience of the
members of this design team through their connection with some
members of the group in the field of television repair that many viewers
who own such systems have great difficulty understanding them and
controlling them properly. It is, in fact, common for a serviceman to be
called to repair a “broken” television that is only out of adjustment.

We feel that television systems are too complex for the average
consumer to operate, and that consumers are dissatisfied with present
systems because of their complexity. In order to document this a survey
was made of people owning televisions. Out of a sample of twenty-six
people questioned, twenty—two said that they would very much like to
have an automated antenna system. Of these twenty—two who said yes,
seventeen or 77.3 per cent, said they would pay as much as one
hundred dollars extra for the system as an option on a new color
television system costing between six and eight hundred dollars.

METHOD OF SOLUTION

The method we used to solve our problem revolved around a group
approach to the problem. Each member of the group was called upon to
familiarize the others with his thoughts and understanding of the
project in a series of group discussions. Research work was farmed out
to the individual members and they in turn reported their findings back
to the group. Each of the group discussions included a review of work to
date and tasks required. This produced a continual re—evaluation of the
project as it progressed.

22

The emphasis of the effort was placed on development of general or
‘ ‘conceptual’ ’ approaches to the problem. The individual experience of
each of the participants in the project was drawn on heavily. One expert
in the field, Mr. Beaumont, the father of one of the team members and
a teacher and television service technician of considerable experience
was interviewed and provided valuable advice and suggestions toward a
solution to the problem.

It was necessary to exercise great care to limit the scope of the
project in order to keep it within the technical capabilities of the
members of the group. A tendency toward pre-occupation with the
electronics of the proposed system ideas caused some delays until the
decision was made to allow this portion of the project to wait until we
were more certain of our needs in this area. As things turned out a
simple modification of the circuitry of an existing design was all that
was necessary. We also determined that consideration of the designs of
other portions of the television system such as the antenna transmission
line and receiver for possible modification was neither feasible nor
necessary in the solution of our problem with the result that we con-
centrated our attention on the control system alone.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
PART I: BACKGROUND

In order to prepare ourselves for the problem of designing an
automatic antenna rotor control system we had to find the answers to a
few questions. These questions were as follows.

1. How does the antenna receive a signal?
2. Which signals are desirable and which are undesirable?
3. Is it necessary to rotate the antenna?

4. What is the best reception condition as observed by the
viewer?

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER_FEBRUARY, 1971

Some of the competition

By research, thought, and group discussion, we were able to find
satisfactory answers to these questions that provided us with sufficient
insight into the area of television antennas and reception con-
siderations to propose solutions to the problem of automating the rotor
system.

1. How does the antenna receive a signal?

First,it is necessary to understand exactly what is'a television
signal. Basically, a television signal is in the form of electro-magnetic
radiation with frequencies assigned by channel number into two bands.
The lower of these two bands, called the VHF or very high frequency
band, lies between 54 and 88 m.h.z. for channels 2 through 6 and
between 470 and 890 m.h.z. for channels 7 through 13. The upper of
these two bands, called the UHF or ultra—high frequency band, lies
between 470 and 890 m.h.z. for channels 14 through 83. The 13
channels in the VHF band and the 70 channels in the UHF band gives a
total of 83 possible channels within which signals can be transmitted.

Although the television signal is actually a combination of several
sub—signals combined or multiplexed into a package within a specified
band width dependent on the band (VHF or UHF), it is common, for
the purpose of antenna theory, to consider the signal to have just one
frequency increase, the attenuation of the atmosphere increases
channel band width. Signals of these frequencies have certain properties
that effect their radiation patterns and hence the manner in which they
are received. The signal travels in the air mostly as a “ground wave”
that is greatly attenuated by the atmosphere with distance. As the
frequencies increase, the attentuation of the atmosphere increases
while diffraction of the signal due to atmospheric conditions increases.
This refraction or bending, called tropospheric scatter, allows some
components of the signal to curve over or around obstacles slightly,
however most reception is in the straight line of sight mode. These
signals are reﬂected very well by large solid objects such as buildings
and some skipping (reflection by the ionosphere) occurs in the lower
VHF band at low signal strengths. Any reﬂected or refracted signal
has a phase shift associated with it when compared to the line of sight
signal.

The outdoor antennas used to receive signals in the VHF band by
home receivers are almost uniformly modifications of the Yagi an-
tenna. The Yagi antenna is a combination of a doublest or folded
doublet antenna with a series of directors and reﬂectors intended to
produce a unidirectional resonant antenna. The elements of the Yagi
must be cut and placed to dimensions corresponding to the right
fractions of a wavelength of the desired signal in order to produce the

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_FEBRUARY, 1971

proper reinforcement of the incoming signal at the doublet elements.
The elements can be made of any suitable wires, rods, or tubes of a
conducting matter. Properly designed, the Yagi antenna takes the
incoming electromagnetic signal and reinforces its strength in its
directors passing the signal from one director back to the next with an
increase in strength for each director until the signal reaches the ‘ ‘hot’ ’
doublet elements and is passed to the receiver. The reﬂector element
blocks any signals entering from the rear of the antenna. The highest
gain of the Yagi antenna is exhibited toward signals of the frequency to
whose wave lengths the elements are cut entering along the per-
pendicular the elements in the same plane from the direction of the
directors. Such an antenna is excellent for a signal of one frequency, but
when it is necessary to receive a whole band of signals, it becomes
necessary to modify the antenna. It has been found that as the antenna
is modified to accept a wider band of frequencies, the directional
properties suffer and some gain is lost. The modified Yagi antennas
presently in use represent a compromise between band width, direc-
tionality, and gain.

The UHF band has just recently come into prominence, but as yet
no single type of antenna has come into general use. It can be said,
however, that in general, all antennas used in this band are directional
and represent the same sort of compromise that is found in the VHF
antenna.

2. Which signals are desirable and which are undesirable?.

Of the signals that reach the antenna for any channel, any one
signal of sufficient strength to drive the receiver amplifiers will produce
a clear picture regardless of its source. The actual required strength of
such a signal is determined by the gain of the antenna at that frequency,
the sensitivity of the receiver and the properties of the transmission line
between the antenna and receiver. Of course, these factors will vary
from one system combination or installation to another. There will be
some difference in quality among reﬂected, refracted, and line of sight
signals caused by a slight phase shifting among the sub—signals within

the signal package that will cause slight synchronization problems
observed as rolling or jumping of the picture and color degradation
These phase shifts can usually be compensated for with the front panel
tuning and synchronization controls. The trend in the television in—
dustry lately has been toward automatic fine tuning and color controls
that remove the burden of controlling these adjustments from the
viewer. As a result, if the antenna can be provided with a signal of
sufficient strength the system can make a pleasing program display out
of it.

An undesirable signal is not one signal but a combination of
signals impinging on the antenna at the same time from different
directions out of phase with one another. A combination of out—of
phase signals produces multiple images of the picture overlaid on one
another, called ‘ ‘ghosts’ ’ , on the screen. It also causes a degradation of
color and distortion of the sound portion of the program. It is not always
possible to compensate for these problems with the front panel tuning
and synchronization controls and this condition tends to fool the
automatic tuning and color adjustment devices causing them to further
worsen the situation.

3. Why is it necessary to rotate the antenna?

The Yagi antenna described in question 1 has proven to be the best
solution to eliminating undesirable signal combinations and therefore
ghosts by virtue of its highly directional reception characteristics. This
antenna is also valuable in pulling in distant stations because of its high
gain. It is necessary, however, that this type of antenna be pointed
precisely in the direction of the incoming signal for best performance
and it is good for the one channel frequency for which it is designed. In
order for the viewer to receive all of the stations in the VHF band it
would be necessary for him to install as many as 13 different antennas
on the roof of his home, one for each station he wants to receive. This is
obviously impractical.

The alternative to multiple Yagi antennas is a compromise design
that is a modification of the Yagi that allows one antenna to receive all
the stations in one band.The reason such an antenna is a compromise is
that it is still desirable for the antenna to be directional in order to
eliminate interferring reflected signals. Also, it is still desirable for the
antenna to have a high gain in order to receive distant stations. It is
necessary, however, to sacrifice some gain and direction in order to
achieve the band spread necessary to receive all channels well.

As the directionality of the antenna is lost so is its ability to reject
unwanted or reflected signals. It is possible though, by rotation of the
antenna, to isolate one lone signal or one combination of signals that
will produce the best reception with the least objectional interference
for any given set of conditions.

Since all the stations in one community do not always transmit
their signals from the same tower and since signals of different
frequencies are refracted in the same way, the position of the antenna
that produces the best reception for one channel will not necessarily
produce the best reception for the others. This brings about the need for
the viewer to be able to rotate his antenna to a new position whenever
he changes to the channel he wishes to view.

It is common for a viewer to have to readjust the rotation of this
antenna for each station in the area. The more sensitive the antenna-
receiver combination, the more necessary it becomes for the viewer to
rotate his antenna for different stations and the more accurately he
must make his adjustments of this rotation. In some rare cases, the
direction of the best signal for one station may change radically with the
time of day and changes in atmospheric conditions. In such cases, it is
necessary for the viewer to make almost constant adjustments in the
antenna rotation to keep his reception quality at an acceptable level. It
should be noted though, that these cases are rare and in most cases the
same station will come in well from the same direction most of the time.

4. What is the best reception condition as observed by the
viewer?

The best reception of a television signal is that which
provides the qualities of picture and sound that are most pleasing to the
individual viewer. Television is basically intended to provide en-
tertainment and should therefore, provide pleasure to the viewer. It also
has a communications function, but the requirements of com-
munications are not nearly as stringent as those of entertainment. It

26

could also be said, that television is useless as a communications media
if people cannot be induced to watch it because it is not pleasing to
them.

Each individual viewer has his own opinions and preferences
concerning the qualities that are pleasing to him in a television display,
but there are certain qualities that could be considered universally
unacceptable in television reception. Among these unacceptable
qualities are snow, a blurry picture, ghosts, rolling and wiggling of the
picture, and distorted sound. All of these conditions are affected by the
antenna.

For the purpose of considering the antenna rotor system, the best
signal condition can be defined in terms of the signal received at the
antenna. The best reception occurs when the strongest possible signal
with the least and weakest interferring signals are received at the an-
tenna.

PART II: SIGNAL STRENGTH AS A
FUNCTION OF ANTENNA ROTATION

In every television receiver there is a system called the automatic
gain control (AGC) feedback. This system takes a reference voltage
(D.C.) from the video detector stage and feeds it back to the first in—
termediate feedback amplifier (first I.F.). This feedback voltage varies
negatively with an increasing signal strength in such a way as to limit
the gain of the first I.F. and keep the peak to peak value of the amplified
signal in the I.F. strip constant within specified limits and therefore
reduce distortion of the television signal within the receiver.

Since the AGC voltage varies proportionally with the incoming
signal strength, the idea was proposed that by sampling this voltage
electronically, it would provide the proper control and feedback inputs
necessary for the antenna rotor control system.

The use of the AGC voltage offered many advantages. Because it
made use of existing circuitry within the receiver, it would reduce the
amount of additional circuitry necessary for the antenna rotor control
system. Since the reference sampled the signal after it had gone through
the tuner, the system would operate independently of the position of
the channel selector. Finally, such a system could be added to any
existing chassis with no modification to the receiver circuitry.

It remained to be seen, however, if the system would work.
Primarily , two points presented themselves as indicative of feasibility of
the scheme. First, was the signal strength a reliable indicator of the
picture quality? Second, was the AGC a good indicator of the signal
strength? An intuitive analysis of the mechanisms was very en-
couraging.

Under ideal conditions, as a uni—directional antenna rotated in the

Bill Greiner's problem: shaving 10-14 sec-
onds off one operation in the manufacture of inte-
grated circuits, while reducing error factor below
.OO1inch.

Bill is a staff member at Western Electric’s
Engineering Research ‘
Center, working primarily
with the handling and test-
ing of integrated circuits.

Bill came to Western
Electric in 1968 after re-
ceiving his MS from MIT.
He earned his BS in Me-
chanical Engineering at
Yale.

“My work here has
given me a better appre-
ciation of the problems in
manufacturing,” said Bill.
His automatic TV system
for the alignment of inte-
grated circuits is a good
example.

At one phase of the manufacturing process,
operators must correct alignment of integrated cir-
cuits by hand—a job that took up to fifteen seconds,
and was accurate to only .001 inch in x and y, and
to one degree in rotary.

What Bill did, essentially, was design and build
a small dedicated computer that completely auto-
mates the process. An operator can push a button
to align the integrated circuits automatically. A TV
camera enlarges the image in silhouette form,
scans the pattern, and
feeds the voltage signal
into Bill’s computer. The
computer calculates the
position measurements
and triggers a stepping
table to correct the align-
ment.

The correction time is
reduced to one second,
the error factor to .OOO25
inch in x and y, and ‘/2 de-
gree in rotary.

What does he find most satisfying about his

encouraged to take it.”

presence of a single signal coming from one direction, the strength of
the received signal will vary as the cosine of the angle between the
receive axis of the antenna and the direction of the incoming signal.
The strength will be maximum when the receive axis and signal
direction are aligned, then drop off sharply as the antenna turns away.
Then the reﬂector is aimedat the incoming signal, the strength will be
zero and then increase as the antenna rotates back toward the signal in
the second half of the arc. The amplitude of the signal at any point in
the rotation and the rate at which it drops off will be dependent on the
parameters of the antenna and the power output and distance of the
station. Naturally, the optimum condition would be with the receive
axis of the antenna precisely aligned with the incoming signal. This
point would give the maximum AGC voltage and the strongest, most
reliable signal.

In order to determine the applicability of this ideal situation to an
actual case, the following experiment was performed:

A television (Magnavox, chassis number V19-O1AA)
was connected to a manual antenna rotor system. A high
quality voltameter (RCA VOLT—OHMYST MODEL V TV
M., 0-10 volt range) was connected to the AGC test point on
the chassis. While the screen was observed for picture quality
and voltage readings were recorded, the antenna was rotated
through the compass settings in graduations of 10 degrees.
This was done for each of four VHF channels in the Pitt-
sburgh, Pennsylvania area, channels 2(KDKA), 4(WTAE),
11(WIIC), and 13(WQED). The tabulated values for each
channel were plotted on a graph with direction as the abscissa
and signal strength as the ordinate and connected with a
smooth curve. The point at which the picture was judged to be
the best for each channel on the basis of sharpness and a
minimum of ghosts was also marked on each graph.

The results of the experiment were that although the AGC voltage
did appear to give a good indication of the signal strength, there could
be found no correlation between the signal strength and the picture
quality. It was further noted that the prime consideration was not the
strength of the signal, but the elimination of ghosts.

If some electrical indication of the presence of ghosts could be
found within the receiver, it would be possible to use this indication to
control the eliminations of these ghosts. Under the present format of
television transmission, however, any out-of-phase signals appear
within the receiver as modulation and are handled as such. It is
necessary therefore, to provide at the transmitter some means by which
the receiver can compare the phase relationships of the received signals.
One possible means of doing this could be to modulate two sub—carriers
within the signal package such as the sound and picture carriers
simultaneously with the same tone in some unused portion of their
respective band widths. At the receiver after demodulation, these tones

could be compared in a phase discriminator. If a phase difference exists
between the two, a voltage would be produced that could be used as an
input to the antenna rotor control in order for the latter device to reject
the antenna position that produced the undesirable phase shift and tend
to minimize the output of the discriminator. This system, in com-
bination with another input, facilitating comparision of the signal
strength against a minimum reference level, could conceivably produce
the best picture as defined in question 1. It would, however, require
changing the format of the transmitted signal and technological
capabilities far beyond those available to the members of this team at
the present time. This concept is, therefore, beyond the scope of the
project at hand.

PART III: PRESET POSITIONING

A common practice among those viewers who use manual antenna
rotors is to mark the indicator dial of the control box with a piece of tape
to indicate the position that gives the best reception for the channel
number that appears on the tape. This crude system is the closest thing
to an automatic antena rotor system presently in common use. It also
suggested to us an idea for a simple solution to our problem.

That would be a system that uses a memory device, an array of
potentiometers for each channel on a wafer switch rotating on the shaft
of the channel selector. The pots would be preset by a television service
technician at the time of installation for the best signal reception for
each channel. When the viewer selects the channel by rotating the
knob, this same action automatically positions the antenna for the best
reception of that channel as indicated by the preset pot.

This system has the advantages of being simple, conformable with
existing systems, and inexpensive. It requires a slight modification of
the tuner in order to add the new wafer to it; however, this does not
change the electricial properties of the receiver in any way.

Many of the more popular antenna rotor systems use a balanced
resistive bridge to compare the position of the antenna with that of the
control knob, while the other half is controlled by the rotor shaft. The
difference between the two halves produces a voltage that controls a
phase amplifier and drives the rotor motor in the proper direction to
nullify the difference between the two halves of the bridge. When the
difference between the halves is nullified, the motor shuts off until a
new difference appears. This system works in the same way with the
exception that the position desired is preset and switched into the
circuit instead of being manually dialed by the viewer.

One disadvantage of this system is that it does not provide for the
UHF band. The reason for this is that the UHF tuner in a television is
continuously tuned instead of being detent tuned (click by click) as is
the VHF band. The result is that the position of the turning knob for a
station is not always the same, making it difficult to gang a switch to
the tuning shaft for the pots. Two possible solutions to this difficulty
exist. One is to provide a number of push buttons to be preset for the
UHF channels available. The other would be to provide a manual
override switch with a manual adjustment knob, much like that
presently used, and be satisfied with having solved the problem of
automating the system for the more popular VHF band, while leaving
the viewer to his own devices in the UHF band.

Another disadvantage of this system is that it does not provide for
the possibility of a change in the signal direction, due to a change in
atmospheric conditions. This problem is also solved by the use of the
manual override. This problem, it should be remembered, is unusual
and only occurs in a small number of cases.

As stated above, this system requires modification of the design of
the tuner assembly to add an additional wafer switch to the shaft.
Although the system itself is not significantly more expensive to
manufacture than a manual control box (in fact, it may be less ex-
pensive as it does not require a separate case), in order to offer it as an
add—on feature for existing sets, new tuners must be sold with it which
would drive the cost out of the competitive range. Offered as an option
on a new color set, however, it would probably result in an amazingly
low price with room for a generous margin when sold along with an-
tenna and installation. We estimate that the whole package need in-
crease the retail price of a $600 to $800 color television by no more
than $100. Our analysis of the market indicates that the average
consumer would gladly pay that amout for it, if not more.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_.FEBRUARY, 1971

PART IV: DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESET CIRCUIT

The preset circuit is based on the use of a two phase induction
motor in combination with a bridge-type servo—amplifier. The bridge is
made up of a rotary potentiometer that is connected mechanicallly to
the antenna rotor shaft and any one of the potentiometers connected to
switch two, which is a wafer on the tuner shaft or the manual override.

With switch one, the manual—automatic selector switch, in the
automatic position, the appropriate preset potentiometer is selected by
the tuner wafer, switch two, corresponding to the channel selected. In
the manual position the manual override potentiometer controls the
circuit. The voltage at the wipers of the control potentiometers and the
feedback potentiometer ganged to the antenna,which are connected in
parallel across the secondary of transformer T—1, will be 1800 out-of-
phase and of equal amplitude only if the settings of these pots are equal.
This will cause the voltages to cancel in the mixer allowing no input to
the servo—amplifier.

If the antenna and control potentiometer voltages are not equal and
out—of—phase at the mixer indicating that the antenna is not in the
desired position, a resultant signal will appear at point A, the output of
the mixer. This error voltage will be amplified by the servo—amplifier
and realized on coil ‘B of the motor. The resultant phase difference
between coil B and coil A whose voltage is provided directly from the
transformer, T-1, will drive the motor in the proper direction to
correct the error. In this way, everytime a new channel is selected or
the manual override is adjusted by its knob on the outside of the
television cabinet, the antenna will be rotated so that the voltages on
the antenna and control potentiometers will be equal and the antenna
will be in the desired position.

It remains only for the control potentiometers connected to switch
two to be preset by an experienced technician so that they will position
the antenna in the optimum direction for each channel in the VHF
band at the time of installation. A potentiometer is also provided at the
input of the servo—amplifier to serve as a sensitivity control. This must
also be adjusted at the time of installation in order to give accuracy of
positioning while preventing oscillation of the system.

Values of the circuit components are not shown as they will vary
with the types of transistors selected and the type of motor used. The
values of the control and antenna potentiometers should be equal and
high enough to both limit the load on T-1 and provide desired sen-
sitivity. Plus or minus 10 antenna rotation would be reasonable with
the idea that this would be reduced by the sensitivity circuit. The more
common antenna rotor motors in use today operate on 28 volts A.C.
(R.M.S.), however, use of a different motor type would drastically
change the circuit parameters and effect the selection of the active
circuit components. For this reason, component values are left to the
discretion of the builder. As this circuit is intended for use as an op—
tional feature on new televisions, it would be advisable to use additional
windings on the main power transformer instead of T—1 as a power
source.

FINDINGS AND SUMMARY

The problem of automating a television antenna rotor control
system is basically one of specifying the inputs and output of the control
system. The primary criterion of the system are that it provide the best
possible reception with the least effort on the part of the viewer.

We found that the best possible control inputs to achieve the best
reception were indications of the phase relationships within the
received signal and the strength of that signal. We also found, however,
that these indications were not both available electronically within the
present day television receiver due to the mode of signal transmission
used. The signal strength is indicated nicely by the automatic gain
control circuit, however, this information tends to be misleading due
to the interference of reflected signals. Any amount of phase distortion
or out-of-phase signals appear within the receiver as modulation in-
distinguishable from any other and we could find no means of deter-
mining the presence of such interference electrically. We did devise a
system for indicating the presence of such distortion by the use of a
transmitted reference signal, but since this required changing the
transmitted signal as well as the receiver set-up, we had to drop the
idea.

Since the best means of determining the desirability and quality of
the received signal we could find was by observation of the picture and
sound, we settled on the use of a preset pusitioning system. The control
inputs to this system are the preset potentiometers _that are selected by
the channel selectro as each channel is selected and a position indication
from the antenna. The system uses comparison of the present position
of the antenna in comparison with the desired position preset for the
selected channel to control the antenna rotor system. The viewer must
only select the channel in the usual manner. This system is only
practical for the VHF band, which is the more popular, because of the
positive detent tuning universally used in this band due to the fact that
the continuous tuning employed in this band does not provide the
positive switching necessary for the system. A manual override is
therefore provided allowing the viewer to manually control the antenna
in any situation for which the presets are not provided or are un-
satisfactory.

Interviews with viewers indicated that they would be willing to
pay as much as $100 or more for such a system as an option on a new
color television antenna combination costing in the range from $600 to
$800. Our estimates are that such a system, although uneconomical to
add as a modification to an existing system, could be added to a
television receiver at the time of manufacture for as little as $20 to $30
per set.

refining is high but in the lanced furnace the rate or reaction remains
higher than in the ore fed process (unlanced). Thus, since the economic
advantage of oxygen lancing increases and emissions decrease as carbon
levels fall, it may be fruitful to think along the lines of a hybrid refining
process; with oxygen lancing being used at that stage of the refining
least detrimental to the environment. It would be most helpful to know
the specific oxygen practice followed at the Edgar Thomson facility.

3. Control Techniques

At first glance it seems reasonable to ask U.S. Steel to consider at
least a partial curtailment of oxygen lancin g for the short period of time
they claim the open hearths at the Edgar Thomson Works will still be
in operation. U.S. Steel has claimed that decreased productivity due to
lancing curtailment may endanger the jobs of 1100 people employed at
the Edgar Thomson Works and the Irvin plant. However if one con-
siders that the open hearths will ostensibly be in operation for only
about a year and that the new BOF shop will offer a large, long term
economic benefit to the area and the corporation, restrictions on
lancing do not seem to be such a drastic measure. According to the facts
presented in the preceeding sections it may in fact be possible to restrict
oxygen lancing to those stages of the process which do not cause the
heaviest emissions while retaining the greatest increase in productivity
afforded by the lancing.

The entire subject of oxygen lancing of open hearth steel is not a
simple one of straightforward alternatives but affords a broad range of
possibilities that U.S. Steel and the Variance Board could consider.

Several years prior to 1965 a Venturi type scrubber was installed
and successfully operated on No. 4 open hearth at the Edgar Thomson
Plant. According to F. A. Thomas, at that time an engineer with the
Edgar Thomson Plant, in a paper presented to the National Open
Hearth Conference of the American Institute of Metallurgical
Engineers and published in the Journal of Metals:

‘ ‘In the older open hearth shops without waste heat boilers the
Venturi Gas Scrubber, with its ability to handle hot gases
directly, provides both satisfactory gas cleaning and increased
furnace draft. The lower capitol cost, as compared to elec-
trostatic precipitators, makes the scrubber an attractive in-
vestment. Also, it is possible to design a scrubber for an
open hearth shop so that it can be used for future basic
oxygen steelmaking installations, thereby obtaining a duel
benefit from one capital expenditure.”

It is quite clear that this paper was written at a time prior to the

1967 statement by Mr. Gott. U.S. Steel Corporation should be asked
why it has not\taken advantage of this possibility.

It should be stated that Venturi scrubber systems have been
relatively easy to procure with the time for planning and installation
sometimes less than one year. This has been the experience of Republic

MEET
THE ENGINEERING

STUDENT CABINET

By WILLIAM E. CONTURO, PE

Faculty Advisor Engineering Student Cabinet
School of Engineering
University of Pittsburgh

Long before the present campus mood of the students existed, the
Dean of the School of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh had
been listening to suggestions from a recognized organization of student
representatives. This organization is the student governing body of the
School of Engineering and is known as the Engineering Student
Cabinet.

When Dr. I-l.E. Hoelscher, PE, became Dean in 1965, he greatly
encouraged the expression of student opinion by scheduling regular
monthly meetings attended by himself, Associate Dean W. R. Gurkes,
PE, and the Cabinet,where matters of mutual concern are discussed
These meetings have been very fruitful from the outset. Through these
meetings Cabinet has promoted the adoption of such innovations as the
S—U option for engineering students taking elective courses in the
humanities and social sciences.

As the Student Power movement began to develop on campuses
throughout the world, Cabinet became a model at the University of an
effective student organization participating in the administration of a
university. Now other schools of the University have formed or are
forming cabinets of their own.

Cabinet was formed in 1925 with a two-fold purpose. First, it is to
create a closer fellowship among the Engineering students. Secondly, it
is to promote student academic, social, professional and administrative
interests in the School of Engineering and throughout the University.

The Cabinet membership is made up of sophomore, junior and
senior student representatives elected from each of the six departments
(ME, CE, ChemE, M&ME, and IE) and the two department options
(Pet E, AE) within the School of Engineering. The Freshman class in
Engineering, not being a part of any department, elects three
representatives, making a total of 27.

In addition to the monthly meetings with the Dean and Associate
Dean, Cabinet members are serving on many administrative com-
mittees not only in the School of Engineering but also in the overall
University. For example, the president of Cabinet serves as the student
representative on the University Senate Educational Policies Com-
mittee. At the school level, a member of Cabinet is the student
representative to the Engineering Undergraduate Administrative
Committee. At the departmental level a member of

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER___F'EBRUARY, 1971

Cabinet serves on the Curriculum Committee of each department.
Also, Cabinet members meet monthly with each department chairman
to discuss such things as curriculum, courses, faculty teaching
techniques, textbooks and grading practices.

Pitt Engineers’ Week is sponsored each year by Cabinet. This
major campus event features a student parade with the arrival of St.
Patrick, student engineering displays, a game night, a gimmick,
selection of St. Patricia, the Shamrock Ball, a service project for the
community and a concert by name entertainers. Each involves heated
scoring competition between the departments or options. At the end of
the week the department or option with the highest total score wins the
coveted Shamrock Award for the year.

The Engineering Student Cabinet International Travel and
Training (ESCITT) Award is another major project. Here, a deserving
engineering student is presented a summer job overseas and $500 in
cash to help defray his travel expenses.

Cabinet also makes the Outstanding Senior Awards each year for
the entire School of Engineering as well as for each department and
option.

Other projects include a self-sustaining student loan fund, student
athletic competition between departments or options, a weekly student
newsletter, locker registration, the student lounge facilities, the
ESCITT seminar, the Outstanding Senior seminar, and the Activities
seminar.

Cabinet operates on an annual budget of approximately $7000.
The finances come from an allocation from the University and from
admission to the Shamrock Ball and concert during Engineers’ Week.

Cabinet has a sense of achievement since it has served as a model
for other schools at the University. It has financial support and
cooperation from the University Administration. The president of
Cabinet is a recognized important student leader not only in the School
of Enginering but in the entire University. Each year’s newly elected
representatives have the challenge to excel over the previous year. This
all makes the Engineering Student Cabinet quite a unique and effective
organization in the modern mood of a University campus where student
opinion is beginning to be heard in the higher councils.

Steel Corporation 14. In 1963 prior to the Thomas statement and before
the market for control equipment became crowded, it took Republic
eleven months to purchase, construct the auxiliary equipment, and to
have operational a system applicable to the same problem as the Edgar
Thomson Works presents. In fact, it should be pointed out that the
description of the gas cleaning devices scheduled for installation in the'
U.S. Steel, Edgar Thomson Works BOF shops given by the Cor-
poration on p. 4 of its supplementary testimony before the Variance
Board (submitted May 4, 1970) includes one for a “Venturi throated
gas cleaner” or just the type that Mr. Thomas noted five years ago
could be designed for the open hearth and then transferred to the BOF.

Summary — October 6, 1970

UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION, Edgar Thomson—Irvin
Works, granted a variance until July 31, 1971, covering smoke and
particulate emissions from an open-hearth steelmaking shop. The firm
originally asked for two years to complete construction of a new basic
oxygen plant as a replacement.

The variance reduces by half the time allowed for construction and
is subject to these conditions:

Stack tests to determine emissions from the existing plant must
be performed under supervision of the Allegheny County Health
Department’s Bureaii of Air Pollution Control, and results must be
submitted to the Board by the end of 1970. The variance may be
modified on the basis of these results.

Construction schedule for the new plant must be submitted by
December 31, 1970. The schedule must show construction steps that
can be speeded up or performed simultaneously and the additional costs
involved.

Oxygen lancing — the use of oxygen to step up steel production
— increases air pollution and must be reduced by one-fourth beginning
January 1, 1971. Monthly reports of steel output and the amount of
oxygen used must be submitted to the Board.

Plans for pollution control at the new plant must be carefully
studied by the Air Pollution Control Bureau to insure compliance with
the County’s strict new regulations. “The Board does not wish to
grant any variance covering emissions from the existing plant,
predicated on the proposition that the new plant will solve the problem,
only to be presented with a request for a variance for the new plant”.

In granting the variance, the Appeals Board weighed carefully the
effects of air pollution on the “health and quality of life in the com-
munity” if the plant continues operations against the adverse effects of
unemployment — the plant employs about 3,000 — if a shutdown is
ordered.

1. Pittsburgh Press, January 5, 1968.
2. Pittsburgh Press, July 6, 1967.

‘ ‘While employment is not a justification for polluting the air, we
should take cognizance of the inequitiees involved when the cost of
solving a.problem for the benefit of the community at large falls
disproprotionately upon a few people”, reasons the Board.

According to the Board, “Complete cessation of air pollution
from this plant could be accomplished immediately only by ceasing
operations”.

In its decision, the Board also makes these points:
The pollution problem from the plant is serious enough to
warrant substantial expenditures by United States Steel to speed
construction of the replacement plant.

At the public hearing on its appeal for a variance last May, the
corporation rejected on grounds of cost some suggestions by the Board
to speed construction of the new facility.

By granting a variance, the Board is saving the corporation
$1,000 a day in fines that might be imposed on each of 10 furnaces.
Given a one—year variance, the firm thus can spend 365 times $10,000
without exceeding the potential cost of operating without a variance.
The Board conjectures that a $3 1/2 million outlay “could speed up a
solution to the air pollution problem at the Edgar Thomson Works”.

HAROLD D. BRODY APPOINTED
TO DEPARTMENTAL CHAIRMANSHIP AT PITT

PITTSBURGH, January 26 — Dr. Harold D. Brody, 31, has
been named chairman of the Department of Metallurgical and
Materials Engineering in the University of Pittsburgh’s School of
Engineering.

His appointment was announced by Dr. H. E. Hoelscher, dean of
the School.

Dr. Brody has been acting chairman of the department since July
1, 1970, when Dr. Edward I. Salkovitz resigned the chairmanship to
take a two-year leave of absence so that he might serve as scientific
director of the London branch of the Office of Naval Research, U. S.
Navy. A search committee composed of Engineering faculty recom-
mended that Dr. Brody be appointed to the chairmanship.

Dr. Brody, an associate professor, has been on the Pitt faculty four
years. He holds S.B., SM. and Sc. D. degrees from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. He has previously served as a research
assistant with the Walworth Company in Braintree, Massachusetts; as
an instructor at Calvin Coolidge College in Boston; as research
metallurgist, research assistant and student technician at M.I.T.; and
as senior research metallurgist with Monsanto Research Corporation.

Dr. Brody’s principal areas of research interest are casting and
solidification.

SOLUTIONS TO
EVER YDA Y PROBLEMS.

In this instance, we've just removed a traffic-snarling casualty
from a crowded expressway. Now, we'll concede that this
might be considered a relatively modest contribution towards
improving the human environment.

But. . . this same Sikorsky® helicopter could have been
effecting a rescue mission off a wallowing tanker in a North
Sea gale. It could have been airlifting food and supplies to
starving villagers in flood-ravaged Tunisia. . . or transporting
equipment for on-the-spot control of off-shore oil pollution.

Obviously, what we're pointing out is the impressive record
and adaptability of our helicopters in solving important
human problems.

There’s much more to come in our world of exciting, advanced
VTOL aircraft systems. For example, Heavy-Lift Skycranes®
and Tilt-Flotor Transports. And just around the corner are our
High-Speed Commercial Transports—designed to ease
short-haul mass—transportation headaches.

Does this kind of engineering attitude stir your sense of
responsibility and imagination? Then you should talk careers
with us. There’s ample opportunity for innovation in:
aerodynamics - human factors engineering - automatic
controls - structures engineering - weight prediction -
systems analysis - operations research - reliabilityl
maintainability engineering o autonavigation systems -
computer technology . . . and more.

And your career advancement can be accelerated through our
corporation-financed Graduate Study Programs—avaiIabIe at
many outstanding schools within our area.

Consult your College Placement Office for campus interview
dates—or—write to Mr. Leo J. Shalvoy, Professional and
Technical Employment.

or

The recruiter's dilemma of 1971

As in any selection process, if you can afford the best and
the best is available, you pick the best. ”Best” here means
the liveliest minds and personalities. And there comes the
dilemma: pick them, or pick those who won't rock the boat?
On today's engineering campuses there is a scarcity of
bright people interested in nothing but engineering. The
boat will have to rock a bit. Let her rock. Eastman Kodak
Company, Business and Technical Personnel, Rochester,
N. Y. 14650. An equal-opportunity employer.
X‘ 3‘ 3F

Dick Pignataro is a mechanical engineer from Georgia Tech.
His job has to do with engineering, construction, mainte-
nance, and utilities for the manufacture of film, paper, and
chemicals by the most advanced methods available. The

office next to his was occupied by a 24-year-old personnel
man named Bob Lee.

One night over a beer these two under-30 types were
getting themselves worked up over the contrast between life
as lived a mile or two outside the plant gates and the sleek
technology inside those gates. Instead of letting it drop,
they put together a proposal for rebuilding badly decayed
houses. It called for high-grade Kodak talent, Kodak seed
money, and faith in the premise that kids can hate school
and yet take pride in doing a job right. Seemed like puddin’-
headed humanitarianism unlikely to get very far up the
chain of command.

Three weeks later, high aloft in a jet, their idea was being
explained to the company president. He liked it.

Pignataro, Lee, Kodak construction supervisors, and
young men of Rochester, N. Y., admire house the
young men rebuilt. The first year several dozen such
houses are being rebuilt by a work force of 100 part-
time students. Since interest in the sonnets of Shake-
speare is at present negligible among these students,
their studies tend more toward ﬁguring how many

boxes of tile to order for a 9' x 13’ kitchen floor.
Building-trades unions counsel. So do bankers, real-
tors, and schoolmen. The renovated homes are sold
to poor people at prices they can afford. It is better
to light a candle than to curse the darkness. If the
candle is too dim, try a halogen-vapor lamp.

VVhen you can
hardliéhe ar

yourse think, a

it’ time to thmk
about noise.

Noise won’t kill you. But before it leaves you deaf,
it may drive you crazy.

Noise is pollution. And noise pollution is approaching
dangerous levels in our cities today.

People are tired of living in the din of car horns and
jackhammers. They’re starting to scream about noise.

Screaming won’t help matters any. But technology will.
Technology and the engineers who can make it work.

Engineers at General Electric are already working
to take some of the noise out of our environment. One area
where they’re making real progress is jet—aircraft engines.

Until our engineers went to work on the problem,
cutting down on engine noise always meant cutting
down on power. But no more.

GE has built a jet engine for airliners that’s quieter than
any other you’ve ever heard. A high—bypass turbofan. It’s
quieter, even though it’s twice as powerful as the engines
on the passenger planes of the Sixties.

And NASA has chosen General Electric to ﬁnd ways of
cutting engine noise even further.

. It may take an engineer years of work before he can
work out the solution to a problem like noise in jet engines.
And it may be years before his solution has any impact
on the environment.

But if you’re the kind of engineer who’s anxious
to get started on problems like these and willing to give them
the time they take, General Electric needs you.

Think about it in a quiet moment.

Or, better yet, a noisy one.

Even with two powerful fan jet engines only a few feet
away, these people can converse in normal tones.
How? The interior designers of this Fan Jet Falcon
business aircraft specified a lead impregnated vinyl
sheet to be sandwiched between the plane's outer
skin and interior trim. Lead’s density effectively bars
both noise and vibration——mal<es flying more produc-
tive, more enjoyable. [3 Lead alone, or combined with
other materials, is one of our best weapons against
noise pollution; it’s being used in planes, boats, offices,
schools and heavy machinery. Designers and archi-
tects know that “lead can make life more liveable—by
hushing things up.”
