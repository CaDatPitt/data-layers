A 3.1 mile race which began and ended at Benedum.
The Chemicals ran away with this year's race.

Each department built a game piece relating to its
theme and played a 12 hour Monopoly game.
The MSEs were able to hold off the ChEs, MES,
and the EEs.

This year’s challenge was to build a “push-of-war"
machine from various items provided in a kit. The EEs
continued their reign as kings of ingenuity, winning for
the third straight year.

Each department created games that went along with its
theme. The EEs and ChEs tied for first place.

This year's events were a tug-of-war, twister,
wheelbarrow race, volleyball, and waterballoon toss.
The Civils emerged victorious from the Cathedral
lawn.

Each department built a float according to its
theme and puts on a show for the judges.
The Mechanicals stole the show.

Each department raced its soap box car, judged on
speed, stability, and maneuverability. The EEs
turned in the quickest time.

A semi-formal dinner dance where trophies were

given to the winners of each event as well as the

Skycir

by Mick Nardozzi

Welcome to another issue of Skyscraper and to
another installment of Pitt’s most puzzling piece of litera-
ture, the Skycaper. Here are the rules: all you have to do
is submit the answers to the following puzzles on a piece of
paper to the Skyscraper Office, room 122, Benedum Hall.
Remember, rarely does the winner get all of the questions
correct. In case of a tie, the earliest entry will win.

You are probably interested in what you will get if you
win. First prize is your name in bold print in the next issue
of Skyscraper. Second prize is the hole of a donut.

1 . What word contains three sets of double letters in a row?
2. Find the product of the following: (x-a)(x—b)...(x-z).

3. On his way to class on the twelfth floor of Benedum, a
chem e takes the elevator to the eighth floor and walks the
rest of the way to class. He does this every day. Why?

4. Let’s pretend that Benedum is surrounded by aten foot
square moat. Each engineeris then given two planks, each
9 1/2 feet in length, and nothing with which to fasten them
together. What do you do ?

(You must get to Benedum - skip class is not a correct
response.)

5. An electrictrain is heading east at 50 miles per hour, and
the wind is blowing from the southeast at 1 8 miles per hour.
In what direction will the smoke from the engine point?

6. In the Towers cafeteria, a cook wants to measure four
ounces of oil out of a jar. The problem is, however, that he
has only a five—ounce and athree-ounce container. How
does he do it?

7. In the newest Engineer's Week event, the soap box

13

derby chicken race, the industrials and the civils are headed
toward each other at aconstant speed of 60 mph. When the
cars are two miles apart, afly leaves the front bumper ofthe
industrials’ car and travels toward the civils’ at a speed of
120 mph. When he reaches that car, he instantaneously
changes direction and heads back toward the other car at
120 mph. He continues this until the two cars smash into
each other . How far did the fly travel?

8. An electrical engineer came to a narrow railroad bridge
and began to run across it. He had crossed three eighths
of the distance when he heard awhistle behind him warning
him of an approaching train. Being an electrical engineer,
he instantly evaluated his alternatives. If he were to run
back to the beginning of the bridge at his speed of 10 mph,
he would leave the bridge at precisely the moment the train
entered it. If he kept on running to the end of the bridge, the
train would reach him just as he left the bridge. At what
speed was the train moving?

Why We Shake

by Ronda Tremonti and William Jacob

During the 1960’s, the theory of plate tectonics became
popular in describing the causes of earthquakes. The
theory holds that the earth’s crust is made of seven large
plates, a few miles thick, and a number of smaller ones
referred to as microplates. Microplates average a few
miles across. The plates and everything on them float on
the earth’s asthenosphere, a layer of molten rock. The
plates, which may move as much as four inches per year,
often collide and scrape past one another, resulting in a
fault. There are two types of faults. Athrust fault occurs
when one plate slides under another, while a strike-slip fault
occurs when plates slide sideways past each other. If the
fault occurs smoothly, only a few tremors which are unde-
tectable by humans occur. However, if the plates are
unable to slip past each other smoothly, they may lock
together.

When two plates lock, pressure builds. Eventually, the
land masses break free jerking a fraction of an inch or a few
feet in a matter of seconds releasing energy which travels
away from the fault in the form of seismic waves. These
waves, which do most of their destruction in the first twenty
seconds after the slippage, are felt by humans as an
earthquake.

The seismic waves from an earthquake travel directly
through the earth in about two minutes. There are three
types of seismic waves. Compressional or longitudinal
waves are created when the rocks vibrate in the same
direction as traveled by the waves. This results in an
increase in the volume of the rocks. Compressional waves
travel at about 8 km/s. Shear or transverse waves which
result in a change in shape of the rocks occur when the
rocks vibrate at right angles to the direction traveled by the
waves. Transverse waves travel at about 4 km/s. Surface
waves which travel slightly slower than shear waves are
confined to the earth’s surface.

Seismographs, which measure the amplitude and pe-

riod of the seismic waves, work basically on the principle of
inertia. A weight is suspended from a frame by a delicate
spring. The frame moves with the motion of the ground
while the weight, due to its inertia, tends to be stationary.
The relative motion between the weight and the frame is the
key to analyzing the seismic waves caused by the earth-
quake. Seismologists use seismographs in groups of three.
The three seismographs, which correspond to the three
types of seismic waves, measure motion up and down,
north and south, and east and west. The epicenter of the
earthquake, which is the area on the earth’s surface directly
above the fault, is found by locating the intersection of
circles drawn from various seismograph centers.

Oncethe amplitude and period of the seismic waves are
found, the intensity of the earthquake can be measured on
the Richter Scale which is determined through the follow-
ing formula devised by Charles F. Richter:

R=log (AfT) + B

where A is the amplitude of ground motion in microns at the
receiving station, T is the period of the seismic waves in
seconds, and B is an empirical factor that allows for
weakening of the seismic wave with increasing distance
from the epicenter of the earthquake. Each interval on the
Richter Scale is an earthquake with intensity 10 times that
of an earthquake of the previous interval. For example, a
5 on the Richter Scale is 10 times as strong as a 4 and 100
times as strong as a 3.

To give an idea of the severity of the quake:

3.5: slight damage

4.0: moderate damage

5.0: considerable damage

6.0: severe damage

7.0: capable of widespread, serious damage

8.0: tremendous damage

An intensity of less than 1 one the Richter Scale can only
be detected by a seismograph. Although animals are
sensitive to lower intensities, humans only feel the effects
of earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater on the Richter

Scale. Each year, more than 300,000 shocks of magnitude
between 2 and 2.9 occur. Most earthquakes take place
beneath the sea. One of the largest earthquakes ever
occurred in 1906 in the Pacific Ocean off the Columbia-
Ecuador border. This earthquake registered an 8.9 on the
Richter Scale.

Although each earthquake only has one Richter Magni-
tude, it will have several values on the Modified Mercalli
Intensity Scale. The Mercalli Scale is used to measure the
amount of damage the earthquake can do. The values
range from 0 for no destruction to 12 for total destruction.
Obviously, the values nearthe epicenter of the earthquake
will be larger than those further away.

There are two major belts along which faults are located.
The first runs through Southern Europe and Asia and is
known as the Alpide belt. The second belt is known as the
Circum-Pacific belt. The San Andreas fault of California is
located on this belt. Some California residents especially
in Los Angeles and San Francisco have waited for years for
a major earthquake known as the “Big One”.

Although reluctant about alarming the public, seismolo-
gists have attempted to predict the occurrence and magni-
tude of earthquakes in California. The traditional approach
is known as forecasting. In this approach, several assump-
tions are made. First, it is assumed that breaks along the
fault occur a segment at a time. Also, the amount of stress
required to break each segment is constant. If these two
assumptions hold, the result is a string of characteristic
quakes, meaning that the intensity of the earthquakes will
be predictable. It is also assumed that the rate at which
stress occurs is constant. Thus, the earthquakes would
occur periodically. Through forecasting, the analysis of
past earthquakes should lead to valid predictions. In July
of 1988, the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
issued its first ever earthquake prediction for California
based on the forecasting method. After analyzing the
estimates of dates and sized of previous ruptures along the
San Andreas fault, the USGS predicted that by the year
2018 there was a 50% chance that San Francisco would
experience and earthquake of Richter magnitude 7.5 or
greater. For Los Angeles, there was a 60% chance of the
same occurrence. Although the forecasting method is
indeed reliable for many faults, there are a number of
situations in which it has failed.

One major cause of the unreliability of the forecasting
method is the presence of faults which lie deep beneath the
surface of the earth. These faults may have been respon-
sible for earthquakes which were thought to be caused by
faults present on the earth’s surface. Thus, the data used
for predictions is unreliable. For example, seismologists
carefully monitoring movements of the earth’s surface in
the Los Angeles area predicted no earthquakes and
ignored geologist Thom Davis’ statement that a low angle
thrust fault lay approximately 9 miles beneath Los Angeles.

15

He predicted that the fault could cause an earthquake
measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale. Davis’ theory was
accepted after an unsuspected earthquake due to the
Davis fault occurred on October 1, 1987. This new fault,
which is difficult to monitor because of its depth, demon-
strated the unreliability of the forecasting method.

One new method of predicting earthquakes which has
led to evidence against the validity of the predictions of the
USGS is the analysis of rings on trees growing near the
fault. In 1988, Gordon Jacoby of Columbia University led
a team which analyzed 70 Jeffrey pines lying along Mojave
fault in California. When a major disruption such as an
earthquake occurs, the growth of the trees is interrupted
leading to rings which are thinnerthan normal. Jacoby was
able to determine from tree rings such information as the
dates of earthquakes as well as the length of surface
ruptures. The team was able to conclude that earthquakes
occur quite irregularly, thus refuting the forecasting method.
Although Jacoby’s results were mentioned in the report by
the USGS, they were not included in the calculations since
more data is needed before attempts at predictions based
on the tree ring method can be made.

Another method of prediction developed at approxi-
matelythe same time as Jacoby’s method is that of analyz-
ing earthquake scars left in peat bogs. Kerry Sieh, a
Caltech geophysicist, analyzed the peat samples with
radiocarbon techniques. Sieh noted that quakes at a single
site occur in clusters which in turn occur at regular intervals.
These results, too, refuted the idea of regularity in occur-
rence and magnitude emphasized in the forecasting method.

Since we have no accurate method of knowing when an
earthquake will occur, the only reliable solution next to
foresight is compensation. Special precautions taken in
constructing buildings in high risk areas include:

- Construction of buildings only on solid ground.

- Foundation pilings dug deep into the ground provide
strong supports for taller buildings.

- Hydraulic shock absorbers placed in between the
floors in a building slow down the motion of the building
while still allowing it to flex.

- At the base of the building, the use of layered steel and
rubber reduce the tendency to movehorizontally.

The earthquake that rocked the Bay Area on October
17, 1989 registered 6.9 on the Richter scale and was the
second most destructive in the history of California. One
of the major results of the severity of the October 17 quake
was the collapse of the Nimitz freeway. This one occur-
rence killed over 200 people, leaving many more trapped.
The highway was strengthened some time ago. It should
have been able to withstand a quake of 8.0 on the Richter
scale, but one of 6.9 felled it. There are many continuing
efforts to protect constructions from earthquake damage.
In the future, we may be able to prevent such a tragedy
through advanced engineerng.

 

Terspectives

by William Jacob

The second semester is usually the time that people
start thinking about where they will be working for the
summer. if you are not in the Coop program, your place of
employment is usually not etched in granite. The resumes
are sent out and the placement office sets up interviews
with as many companies looking for interns as possible.
Given a certain amount of luck and if the interviews go well,
you can land yourself some summer work.

Most students who work overthe summer are employed
at larger companies. The reason forthis is thefact thattheir
budget usually affords them the opportunity to invest in
younger people in the hopes that they will train them for a
future position at the company. This same process takes
place at the smaller firms, but to a lesser degree.

The cost of training a new-hire for a company is not
small. In some cases, the majority of the first year salary is
spent teaching the employee the facets of the job, the
company's policies, and generally establishing at what
capacity they will work. It is clear, then, that if a company
could reduce these costs, they would not only save money
up front, but gain from the factthatthe new employee would
be able to handle his or her responsibilities at an earlier
time, thus making a contribution to the firm sooner. The
student program is the best way to accomplish this.

The company definitely is not the only party that gains
from the experience. The student, if they have never
worked at a large company before, will be impressed on
their first arrival, especially if the corporation has a manu-
facturing facility on location. The scale of production is
something that will not soon be forgotten. The tools that are
employed to create the product are state of the art and the

16

machines are usually computer numerically controlled.
Such companies as General Electric produce aircraft
engines that have jet intakes on them large enough for a
person to live inside. There is an unbelievable amount of
technology that goes into producing each single blade, for
example. For the Materials Science Engineer, the task of
creating the blade as a single crystal (to reduce the number
of grain boundaries, therefore increasing the strength ofthe
blade) is a challenge in itself. The Mechanical Engineer
who designed the blade has specified that the blade is
hollow with cooling passages inside and air outlets on the
trailing end of the blade. One might think that these holes
are drilled, as they used to be, but they can be added by
either laser technology or by electro-discharge machining.
The Electrical Engineer is needed to bring all of this
technology into existence and keep it in running order. The
Chemical Engineer is in charge of quality control since the
parts are checked for imperfections by the use of a chemi-
cal bath that fills any fracture, and when passed under an
ultraviolet light, the accumulated fluid reveals the problem
The Civil Engineer has duties on the plant floor such as
machine and building layout, while the Industrial Engineer
can manage the operation and make productivity deci-
srons.

These tasks will usually not be performed by the intern,
although they can be if enough experience is gained over
the course of a few summers. The capacity in which the
intern will function will usually be as an assistant. At first
impression, this may seem rather mundane, because we
all want to be in the position to make the decisions, but
actually this can be one of the most rewarding experiences
that a student can have. If you are given enough respon-
sibility, the work that you are given is nothing less than a
challenge.

Do you eat at least one hot balanced meal a day? Do
you get seven to eight hours of sleep at least four nights a
week? Do you take fewerthan five alcoholic drinks a week?
if you answered no to these questions, you could be
suffering from stress! In the engineering guide to applied
definitions in science (EGADS), stress is defined as a force
per unit area that prevents the mind (and sometimes the
body) from exhibiting normal functioning behavior . This
condition is a common occurrence nationwide. Recently,
there has been an alarming increase in the number of
cases cited on our very own Pitt campus. Due to this
increase, we have compiled a quiz to show early warning
signs of stress. So grab your pencil and begin. Don’t worry,
this will be graded on a curve.

1. You find out that the Engineering 13 problems you
thought were due next Friday are due this Friday. lt’s
Thursday night. You:

a) Lock yourself in your room with a ruler, calculator,

and a case of Mountain Dew;

b) Start filling out transfer applications;

c) Spaz, scream, and run through the halls of Benedum.

2. During a Calculus exam, you run across a question
that appears to be written in a foreign language. You:

b) Perspire profusely;
c) Try holding your breath until you pass out.

3. You just finished typing a ten page term paper that’s
due tomorrow when all of a sudden the keyboard locks and
the screen displays, “ABORT, RETRY, IGNORE.” You:

a) Whimper a bit but move to another computer;

b) Clinch your teeth, growl and mumble a few choice

words;

c) Rip the cord out of the wall and strangle the nearest

lab attendant.

4. Professors who assign a test, a term paper, and
several chapters of problems due in the same month

driven insane.

5. You know your workload is a bit too heavy when:
a) You feel like a walking zombie;

b) Vivarin can be used as a sleeping aid;

c) You start talking to inanimate objects.

6. Minutes before your physics final, you realize you
used your calculator batteries for your Walkman, which is
on your desk in your room. You:

a) Think “no problem”, I can do it in my head;

b) Make a quick dash to your room;

c) Knock out the person next to you and steal his

calculator.

Typically, the student has a close relationship with a
supervisor. The work that you are hired to perform usually
is due to the specific needs at the corporation. Your
supervisor is either head of the group or a person in the
group who provides you with work that would either over-
load others, or because you are best suited to the job. For
this reason, it is useful now to establish computer skills that
enable you to be more versatile. Some of the people in a
larger firm are well educated and are in major decision
making positions, but do not have enough time to do
evaluations, simulations, or other computer enhanced tasks
that would improve the results thatthey getfrom their work.
If a student can offer this skill, along with engineering
knowledge, he or she will be more valuable to the company
as an intern, and also help to put the company further
ahead in a competitive business environment.

There are definitely other skills that will make you a more
valuable asset. Some of these are in—depth knowledge of
the engineering skills taught in school, knowledge of the
“tools of the trade”, or hands-on experience, and good
personal skills, to name a few.

Aside from the specifics, there are a few general things

|II|iIms5ﬁ5ﬁEEi”"”‘.Eii

that a person will learn during a work assignment at an
aggressive large company. The business world that the
United States operates in is definitely a global one. The
attitude of the employees is one of the majorthings that can
either make or breaka company. The company is not only
the name orthe building that houses all of the machines, but
it is the people as well. One of the problems in the past for
some American companies is thatthe consumer complains
of a lack of quality. One reason for this was due to the lack
of tools to get the job done correctly. Another reason was
the attitude of the workers. I know I have heard this more
times than I prefer, but it is true, and until we go by it, it will
be difficult to be successful in the business world today -
“pride in your work is the secret to success.” The manage-
ment is the first group of people that must convey this to
others. Some object to the idea of being a “company man”
or a “company woman”, but this does not have to be the
case to employ this principle. The companythat fosters this
idea is doing a great service to their future, but this idea
does not begin only at the company. If a student can bring
this to the company, personal success will not only result,
but the attitude of others will improve. This leads to overall
success.

As editor, I would like to welcome you to the fortieth
anniversary issue of Skyscraper Engineer Magazine.
Skyscraper was first introduced to the University of Pitts-
burgh in 1951 , and today it remains the only magazine of its
kind on campus: completely staffed by undergraduate
students. Although many of you may not be familiarwith the
magazine, Skyscraper has been the recipient of many
journalistic awards in the past, and this year’s staff is
dedicated to returning the magazine to award-winning
status. Although we are only publishing one issue during
this academic year, we hope to return Skyscraper to its
previous publishing schedule of once per term.

Final exams are upon us once again, and we at
Skyscraper wish good luck to everyone. There are many
new faces in Benedum this year. We would like to welcome
them to what we hope will be avery beneficial period in their
lives. We would also like to say so long to the seniors.
Whether you are moving on to begin your careers or to
further enhance your education, we hope that this issue of
Skyscraper provides you with just a few memories of your
years at Pitt. We’ve gotten a great deal of enjoyment out of
publishing this issue, and we hope that you enjoy reading
it.

In this issue we have provided a wide range of
subjects. Of special note are technical articles on the
chemical processes that occur in photography and the
science behind earthquakes. Skyscraper has also ob-

tained the exclusive rights to photographs taken by Mark
Belz during his trip to Africa last summer. We have also
provided the results of Engineer’s Week 1991 and chal-
lenged you with another installment of the Skycaper.

In closing, I would like to wish everyone a healthy and
productive summer. The staff at Skyscraper will be working
hard in order to provide more interesting articles for next
year’s issues. In the meantime, enjoy this issue, and let us
know what you think. We are always interested in hearing
the views of the student body as well as the faculty.

Any letters can be sent to:

A Lesson on
Life

by Jim Liszewski

Yes, as the title reads this is another lesson on life.
You’re saying to yourself, why the hell should I read on,
right? Well, I dare you to read on. Because what follows
dares you to doubt who you are today. Hey, it’s healthy
(mentally) to doubt oneself. The best ideas of ourtime have
come about because people have doubted the present
situations. So, look to the future, and read on...

Do you reallythinkyou can handle engineering forthe
rest of your life? Or will you really be able to take teaching
30 impatient 12-year-olds? Is there going to come a time
when that nursing degree bottoms out in responsibilities
and promotions? Did you enter college with a major that
you decided upon with little more than a wild guess? Is
there something now or will there be something someday
that you've wished you’d done instead?

Did you ever wonder what you want to do when you
grow up? Of course you have, and I have.

Welcome to the real world.

It’s a stress causing subject for a lot of people, but one
can’t let oneself avoid it, because we college students are
still on that state of flux from irresponsibility to responsibil-
ity. Soon, we have to make a living and a career. But if we
thinkwe’ve guessed the wrong career, now is the best time
to question it. Now is the best time to make a move. If not,
we’l| regret it later.

Doubt everything. Take an interest in anything.

Of course, the options always seem either forever
possibilities orthe possibilities seem nonexistent, because
there’s so many factors involved in a decision as big as
choosing a career. Everybody’s options are different, but
this writer has created a generic version of “the confused
student." l’ve discovered these basic categories of thought
in making that dreaded career decision: First, there’s the
“something I enjoy doing” career, then the “the career best
suited to me” career, then “the dream career," finally the
“fate” career. All but the most lost of us have experienced

all these and maybe more. l’ll show you what I mean, and
see if you don’t agree.

“something I enjoy"

What if I get hit by truck and die tomorrow? My life and
yours as well could end any second, so I want to make sure
I am doing something I enjoy right now.

For example, I don’t want a job that requires me to
invest 10 years of boring work until I can get a position that
is enjoyable. Who wants to get out of four years of school,
only to be bored in the prime of one’s life? Not me. Which
is more important, money or happiness? Isn’t this the
question that causes people to drop promising careers in
business in orderto teach school, go to the peace corps, or
raise a family? Myself, l’ve had menial laborjobs that have
been more enjoyable than some positions l’ve had in
engineering-related jobs. Situations such as these sure
make one think a bit about priorities.

OK, I’d better take a break from this subject before I
drop out of school right now and get a job waiting tables.

“a career best suited for me”
Then there’s the job that I am best fitto do, the one that

requires skill that I have.

Did Mom and Dad always say you were good with
numbers? Did you always draw? Were you always fixing
things? Do you remember elementary teachers saying
everybody has one thing at which they are good? Well,
then, whatever this vocation is for you, it seems that this
should be the logical, practical thing to do for a living.

But be careful about this one.

First of all, make sure you aren't stuck with a career.
Are you in afield that you’ve been decided aboutsince third
grade? If so, maybe you feel you’re living out a dream, but
were you realistically able to make a good decision to live
out this dream when you were in third grade? An object in
motion tends to remain in motion. it’s easy to go with a
career as a default just because you can’t think of anything
else to do.

Secondly, many career counselors will suggest not to
try to make money on a hobby you enjoy doing. Say

someone enjoys repairing his own car. That doesn’t mean
he would want to be a mechanic eight hours a day, seven
days a week, 52 weeks a year. If he does, that hobby will
not be fun anymore, but instead will become work.

So, ask yourself if there is such a thing as a “practical
career," one that is your talents best fit? And if there is, are
you willing to give up your enjoyment for the practicality of
making money?

‘ h r m r r

The dream. I think I can.

The desire. I can do anything.

Everybody wants their dream. After all, this is Amer-
ica and there is no one telling us what career we should go
for. As college students, now is the time to dream and we
are closer to that dream than we have ever been.

But wait. Can you really say that if you want to be an
artist, or a professional athlete, you can? You must
possess at least some natural talent, artistic talent, physical
talent, etc. Sometimes a lot of drive can make up for a lack
of talent, but we've all had dreams crash on us. Practicality
must always be considered.

Can you afford to change majors and stay in school
longer? Do you have the guts to do it?

“f_a.te_”

Do you believe in fate?

“No matter what I do, any decision I make, fate will
take it’s course”.

How about, “ What He wants to happen will happen?"

Personally, I can’t count the number of times this has
happened to me: I have an important decision to make, my
options are in front of me, and I make the choice, my own
free choice; but then looking back some time after the
decision, it seems as though it was “fate” for things to turn
out the way they, that the present state was bound to
happen.

The surprises, the luck, the sudden turn of events -
can it all be doomed to happen? Can this really be true?

Nah...

SUMMARY...

We have all seen others - parents, friends, friends’
parents, relatives - who deal with reality every day, unlike
us college students. They get by.

But are they really happy? Or are they wondering the
same things, doubting the same things about their voca-
tions as many of us are?

Do they wish they had doubted themselves long ago
when they were younger, for example, our age? I guaran-

tee there are more people out there like this than you think.

Actually, we should always doubt our present situ-
ations. My dad said to me not long ago, ‘‘I still don’t know
what I want to do when I grow up.” He’s 60 years old. Not
that he’s unhappy with the present, but one should always
assume that there’s always something beyond.

My whole point is that this is a great time to make a
change in goals, a change in direction. Don’t hold yourself
back from doubting where you are going.

And look around. If you see something that may be
vaguely interesting, look into it. A university gives us more
information at hand - libraries, recruiters, counselors,
important contacts - than we’ll find anywhere else.

Look at others. Surely you know people who have
changed careers, or people who aren’t happy doing what
they’re doing.

There shouldn’t be anything to prevent you from
finding happiness. Act now.

The Big Picture

by Nadya Sustache

Photography brings out the artist in every one of us.
Have you ever thought that every time you take a picture
you are framing a set of variables that are going to form an
image distinct from any other? Most people view photog-
raphy as a way of capturing images; however, many don’t
visualize the critical role they play as the designers of those
images. Photographers considerthe images they produce
as the combination of visual creativity and technical exper-
tise. In order for a photographer to use the full potential of
the image forming capabilities of his system, he must be
particularly familiar with the sciences of chemistry and
optics and at the same time use his imagination in orderto
express himself in a creative way. For many of us, taking
pictures is an easy job that requires not much more than
looking through a viewfinder and pressing a button. How-
ever, few realize that photography involves one of the most
complex chemical processes known at present. It is also
a very exciting field that is rapidly expanding into areas
such as electrophotography, thermography, digitized im-
age formation and many more. All of these advancements
incorporate different branches of knowledge such as elec-
tronics and materials science and expand the scope of
imaging science to not only commercial photography but to
images obtained through high resolution microscopes,
telescopes and even computers. Photography being such
a broad field, I would like to concentrate the scope of this
paper on the chemistry of the photographic process. in
particular, it is my interest to describe the process through
which images can be captured on film and developed into
prints.

One ofthe first discoveries that formed the basis forthe
photographic system occurred in 1630. Before that time,
the color of objects was attributed to the objects themselves
and light was thought of as the element that made that color
visible to our eyes. Scientific discoveries showed that the
color we see depends on the intensity and the wavelengths
of the light that illuminates the object and not on the object

itself. Along with this, it was discovered that the eye
perceives only a specific range of wavelengths; it is sen-
sible to the blue, red and green radiation of the visible
spectrum. However, it was not until 1801 that Helmholtz
and Young showed that by mixing different amounts of
those three primary colors almost any desired color could
be produced. Those discoveries about the nature of light
and the ways in which the eye perceives color constituted
the basis for color photography.

in the manufacture of photographic film, layers are
used which are sensitive to each one of the primary colors;
each layer recording only one of the three. The compo-
nents of the film are, in simple terms, an emulsion and a
base. The emulsion contains different layers composed of
the light receiving elements that are going to form the latent
image. There exist many light sensitive substances which
vary in their degree of sensitivity. Silver halides are the
materials used in photographic emulsions because they
are developable, which means that the effect of light in
producing a latent image can be amplified and reproduced
through the use of a developing solution. In doing this, the
sensitivity achieved is increased on the order of a thousand
million times. Of the silver halides, a combination of them
is used in an emulsion. Each one of them absorbs light of
a limited range of the electromagnetic spectrum. For
example, silver chloride absorbs the wavelengths of light in
the blue region up to 500 nm, silver bromide to 520 nm and
silver iodide to 550 nm (1 nm = 109 m). For this reason, if
commercial emulsions contained only pure silver halides,
only the blue reflections of objects could be recorded in the
film. However, through the use of certain organic chemi-
cals, the sensitivity can be extended into the green and red
regions of the visible spectrum. The sensitivity can also be
enhanced through the preparation of special configura-
tions of the silver grains. Extensive research done in this
area has shown that the sensitivity of a silver halide grain
to blue light is dependent upon its volume while the sensi-
tivity to red and green light is dependent upon its surface
area. The shape of silver halides that combines these
characteristics has been termed T-grain and is currently in
use in new, improved film products.

Besides silver halide grains, the emulsion is com-
posed of gelatin, which is a very complex organic material
obtained from animal skins and bones. It is so complex that
the specific arrangement and the exact proportions of the
elements are still unknown. In particular, collagen, the
immediate source of gelatin, is obtained from carefully
selected hides and ears of calves after chemical treatment.
Gelatin is used for a variety of reasons. Primarily, it helps
keep the silver halide grains evenly distributed through the
emulsion without touching each other. It also adds support
so that the emulsion is able to resist abrasion and finally,
it makes all the grains accessible to the processing solu-
tions. So many different factors affect the nature of the film
that great care has to be taken in order to achieve the
desired product characteristics. Some of the most impor-
tant factors are the choice and distribution of the silver
halides and gelatin, as explained in the former paragraphs,
but also, the ripening process and the choice of other
chemical additives such as hardeners and sensitizers. For
this reason, it is a very difficult task to achieve the desired
film composition that is going to give us the quality of the
image we want. The variables involved in the production of
film are so extensive that great care has to be taken in each
step of the process. All of these considerations help us
realize the complexity of the chemistry behind the photo-
graphic system.

A photographic emulsion is basically made through the
following reaction, (note that the halide element is subject
to change):

AgNO3 + KCI —---> AgC| + KNO3

This reaction starts with a solution of gelatin in water to
which halide salts and silver salts are added at a specified
rate and temperature. The silver halides precipitate into
crystals very quickly. A long precipitation results in a
solution of high sensitivity due to the large size of a big
proportion of the crystals. After this initial precipitation, a
more concentrated gelatin solution is added to increase
protection forthe crystals. This mixture is then heated in a
process called ripening. This process allows the crystals to
grow at the expense of the smaller ones, thereby increasing
grain size. This is possible because of the low solubility of
the silver halides. Control of the grain structure, size and
distribution is very important to the precipitation and ripen-
ing steps. Once these preliminary steps are complete, the
emulsion is washed to remove unwanted salts and excess
halides. The final emulsion will consist of separate layers
which will record individually the blue, green and red
components of light. By superposing the three individual
images created in each layer, the original picture can be
reproduced with a fair amount of accuracy. A typical

emulsion is going to contain a blue sensitive layer, which is
going to absorb the blue wavelengths of light, and under-
neath, a yellow filter which will prevent any blue light from
reaching the subsequent layers. The next layers are green
and red sensitive respectively. For image development, it
is necessary that the records of blue, green and red light be
composed of their complements, yellow, magenta and
cyan. This is done through the use of color couplers either
in the developing solution or in the emulsion itself. In
photography, such colors are termed subtractive primaries
and they are the result of the following combinations:

Blue + Green = Cyan
Blue + Red = Magenta
Green + Red = Yellow

In orderto obtain the correct image, the couplers have
to be stabilized and unable to diffuse from layer to layer.
This is prevented by anchoring the color couplers through
the use of chemically inert chains linked to the gelatin
colloid. Once the silver grains are sensitized and exposed
in a camera and light is allowed to enterthrough the shutter,
a latent image is formed. The Gurney-Mott mechanism is
one theory for the mechanism of latent image formation.
This theory asserts that the latent image is composed of
silver formed by the combination of mobile silver ions with
electrons liberated by exposure. This happens when
radiation by light produces electrons that are raised to
higher energy levels. At this time, four different kinds of
point defects are formed in the crystal, two are positively
charged and two are negatively charged. The former ones
are called interstitial silver ion vacancies. During exposure,
absorption of a photon of light by the crystal excites the
electrons that are then free to move through the lattice and
combine with interstitial silver ions, thereby producing
silver atoms. When sufficient exposure has produced
about four atoms of silver at one site of the grain, it then
becomes developable. The general reaction can be repre-
sented by the equations:

Ag’' + e‘ —---> Ag
Br + hv —---> Br + e‘

The positive holes, formed by the loss of electrons to
form silver atoms, move to the surface of the crystal where
they neutralize halogen ions and are adsorbed by the
gelatin. in orderto develop the latent image, two important
chemical reactions also have to take place:

1) Silver halide grains which have become develo-
pable by exposure to light are reduced to metallic silver and
the developing agent is oxidized:

Developing Agent + Silver Halide > Silver Metal
+ Halide lon + Developer Oxidation Products

2) Developer oxidation products react with color cou-
plers to form image dyes:

Developer Oxidation Products
+ Color Couplers  > Dye

it is possible to obtain all three dyes from each layer
through the use of only one developer. The developing
agents used for this process are generally members of the
p- phenylenediamine family in which the hydrogens of one
amino group are replaced by organic groups such as: -
C2H5, -C2H4OH, and -C2H4NHSO2CH3. For development to
start, a silver center where the latent image is present has
to exist. A developer should be able to reduce exposed
grains at a rate considerably larger than that one for
reducing unexposed grains. in order to understand the
mechanism of development, it is importantto viewthe silver
centers as catalysts. This adsorption catalysis mechanism
assumes that the reduction of silver atoms is a heterogene-
ous reaction in which one or more of the reactants are

adsorbed by the silver centers. When this takes place, an
intermediary complex is formed between the developing
agent and the silver ion which is then succeeded by
electronic rearrangement. This is the final step of develop-
ment where the complex decomposes to silver and oxi-
dized developing agent. After development, the unre-
duced silver halides are dissolved in a fixing bath, and all
that remains is the image composed of metallic silver.

Many other variables come into play in this complicated
process and all of them have a distinctive influence in the
final result. The image produced can be examined for
characteristics such as granularity, color saturation, sharp-
ness among others. The evaluation of these images is a
science in itselfthat is based on the principles of optics and
chemistry, but relies also on the psychological and physio-
logical aspect of the viewers.
