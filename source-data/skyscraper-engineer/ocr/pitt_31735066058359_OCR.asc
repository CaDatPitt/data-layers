Why is Cheating Wrong?

The fundamental question is: why is cheating
wrong? (For if it is not wrong, why should anyone be
concerned about it?) I received a wide variety of
responses to this question; however, they can be
categorized into three general viewpoints: cheating is
unfair, cheating is stealing and cheating is lying.

A widely held belief is embodied in the statement of
one honest and frustrated student: “Cheating is wrong
because it is not fairtothe people who dothe work. It is
not fair if nothing is inputted by someone (if a cheater
does no work) because the score ofthe cheater cheap-
ens the score of a non-cheater (when they are com-
pared on an equal basis). To an unknowing professor,
the efforts of the honest student are evaluated on the
same basis as the dishonest one. With the prevalent
use of grading curves, cheating can directly affect the
honest person’s grade.

The concept of unfairness was expanded upon by
many of those interviewed to include unfairness to the
cheater himself. One professor told me: “One who
does not do his own work does not learn the material.
He is cheating himself out of an education.” Further-
more, as another engineering professor described to
me, he is depriving himself of the self-confidence
which one develops through successfully tackling dif-
ficult ass gnments and concepts.

This “fairness" argument, however, does not
address two views widely accepted among the engi-
neering student population. One view is that to cheat
and copy on “busy work” is acceptable, not wrong. The
other view is the claim that cheating on an unreasona-
ble examination is justifiable.

A view which does attack these justificatio‘ns for
cheating is that it is inherently wrong to cheat because
passing off other’s work as one’s own is a form of theft.
One professor described a cheater as “a common
thief.” It is a common occurrence that students use
each other’s work. Have you had a classmate copy
your computer program when he said hejust wanted to
use it as a reference? One chemical engineering stu-
dent joked about the widespread copying of laboratory
reports: “Who wrote the original P. Chem (Physical
Chemistry) lab (write-up) anyway? It must have been
the professor. No, it probably was the T.A." Do you
think that such copying is a form of cheating?

This second viewpoint of why cheating is wrong is
limited to cheating which involves taking another’s
work or ideas. But is it all right to use “crib" sheets and
to copy another’s work if one has his or her permis-
sion? “No!”, say many students and faculty. They
believe that cheating is wrong because it involves an
untrue presentation of what one knows; it is lying. As
one CAS professor told me: “Recognition should only
result from one’s own effort.” Do you not think it is
wrong for someone to unethically obtain recognition
over you? Is it not wrong for someoneto be recognized
by a test grade which was obtained through cheating?

What Levels of Cheating Exist?

In the course of my asking people why cheating was
wrong, I discovered that most people believed that
different severity levels of cheating existed. One pro-
fessor compared these levels to different degrees of
murder. All forms of cheating are wrong, but some are
worse than others.

The least severe level of cheating is copying home-
work. Most students polled said that although this is
cheating, it is still all right for one to do. One student
said this concisely, “Simple homework copying is
O.K.” The various justifications given for this type of
cheating follow.

Many engineering students have a strong adversion
to work they deem as a waste of their time. Over and
over again I heard the excuse: “lt’s (homework is) just
busy work.” Therefore, it is all right for one to copy it.

Another widely accepted view is that because home-
work grades are such a small percentage of one’s total
grade it does not matter if it is copied. Do you agree
with this argument? is it all right to take a quarter
because it is only a quarter?

Among many engineering student circles, esprit de
corps exists; homework should be tackled with a col-
lective effort by which the work load of each individual
is reduced. As one student phrased it: “As long as a
person does his fair share of the homework, it isfineto

copy?

Besides the blatant physical proof, there exists ac-
tual personal experiences of observing or hearing about
instances of cheating. A few such experiences are
recorded below.

0 Anita Test was furiously preparing for an,

engineering final examination with a friend who had
already taken the course. After working through a “sam-
ple” test, the friend found out that he had helped her com-
plete the test that had been administered two hours earlier
and would very probably be the one that she was about
to take in the following hour.

- l. Rover was born a procrastinator. Once again
he had not kept up with his class work in an important
class. Moreover, he rarely had been in class, since he
especially disliked classes meeting before 1:00 PM. The
night before the examination, he decided to start studying.
It only took him twenty minutes to realize that he could
not learn the material adequately in one night. Depressed,
he went to bed. During the test, he knew that he had to
copy from his neighbor in order to pass the examination,
so he let his eyes rove to his neighbor’s test paper.

0 Pam Xerox hates lab. Researching the theory and
writing it up is boring. The calculations are tedious and
time consuming! Besides, who wants to waste one’s time

conducting and writing up an experiment? Since her friend'

is one year ahead of her in the same department and the
professor never changes the experiments, she never has
to do any of these unpleasant things. Pam simply
paraphrases her friend’s old report. To circumvent the
problem of having to turn in data before leaving the
laboratory, she copies from the old report before she goes
to class. Since the instructor is not (and, perhaps, cannot
be) around much during the laboratory class, he has never
discovered that she has yet to perform an experiment and
collect original data.

There are many other examples that I could cite, but
there is no room here. The point is that cheating exists
here. The severity of the situation is very difficult to deter-
mine. Pitt might have much less or much more of a prob-
lem than other schools. Regardless of breadth, the prob-
lem is an issue which must be addressed by the students,
faculty, and administration of this school.

Yet another view is that homework copying is not
cheating only when one learns the material. One stu-
dent explained, “You don’t have to work for hours to do
it (homework). You just have to learn it somehow.” One
professor seemed to condone this view with his com-
ment: ‘‘I don’t count homework (except for borderline
cases) because I know that copying goes on. The pur-
pose of homework is to learn how to solve problems.
Any student can come into my office and see the
answer book.”

Many professors are fully aware of the problem of
copying of homework. Many professors agreed with
the one who said; “Cheating on homework precludes
(my) assigning an undue fraction of my class grade to
homework." It is unfortunatethat many professors feel
that they must take such a pragmatic view towards
cheating.

The next level of cheating is on examinations. With
tests the objective is not to learn material (as it is with
homework), but rather for the student to demonstrate
the knowledge he or she has acquired. Due to this
difference in objectives, many engineering students
who accept the copying of homework oppose cheating
on examinations. One student stated it the following
way: “An exam is an indicator of how much is learned
(by the student). If one cheats, one presents an unac-
curate picture of what he has learned, and this is ethi-
cally wrong.”

Another reason given by students who condone
copying homework yet object to cheating on tests is
told by two students: “Copying homework is not like
cheating on a quiz or test where one is out and out
unprepared for a major portion of one’s grade.” The
severity of one’s cheating is seen as a function of the
percentage of the class grade given to a particular
assignment or test.

There exist students who believe that even cheating
on tests is acceptable; it is a way to get by. Said one,
“Cheating on a test is steeping low, but it is still O.K.”
Some of these students claim that cheating in some
classes is justified because they are irrelevant to one’s
education. As one said, “People know which classes
are serious.” What I wonder is: is it all right for these
students to decide which classes are “serious”? is it
not unfair to those students whofind a class relevantto
have people cheating because they feel the class is
superfluous?

The third and most serious level is the stealing of an
examination before the test. Every student believed
that such an act was very wrong. Even the student who
said that cheating on a test was all right said: “Stealing
an exam — you can’t do that.”

I was slightly surprised, but glad, that no one sup-
ported stealing an exam with the argument that it is
worth stealing an exam if it results in good grades. I
offer two hypotheses for the absence of this response.
First, students find the argument that “the ends justify
the means” contrived and fallacious. Theft is always a
crime. Second, students realize that engineering stu-
dents do not (or should not) need to steal an examina-
tion to pass a course. Such means cannot be justified
when better ones are at one’s disposal.

Why Do People Cheat?

After looking at how people break up cheating into
different levels, I wanted to know why people cheat at
all. I received many excuses for people's cheating:
Fear, laziness, lack of character, and besttime utiliza-
tion. The following is a representative sample of the
responses to my question: Why do people cheat?

“People cheat because they fear failure,” said one
professor. This fear is not restricted to students who
are failing a course. Responded one student: “People
with high grades cheat because they are afraid to get
low grades." For some this fear of failure is only
instilled upon arrival ofthe test date. “People procras-
tinate. They then cheat to survive (the class),’’
explained another professor.

Another reason is that people do not want to waste
their time on unimportant matters. One student told
me: “People don't want to spend time on B.S. like
organic (chemistry). In practice, if one needsto know a
reaction, he is going to go to the books.” Another
student related: “Spending time on homework is not
beneficial.”

This attitude is dangerous because it can facilitate
the spread of one’s cheting. As one cheats more, it
becomes easier to find more and more of one’s work
meaningless and appropriate on which to cheat.

Many engineers find themselves cheating because
they simply have too much to do. Said one student, ‘‘I
couldn't lead a normal life if I didn't copy homework
and use old labs (laboratory reports).” Having survived
my junior year in chemical engineering, I can under-
stand this sentiment. That year, I slept more hours over
Christmas vacation than I did over the entire fall or
winterterms. However, I do not accept the excusethat
an unfair workload justifies cheating. Be it unpleasant,
one has to make sacrifices. These may be grades, a
healthy social life, or money (if one must reduce the
course load and go during part of the summer or an
extra term).

Some persons polled (especially professors) are
much harsher on cheating students. “People cheat due
to lack of character,” said a professor. A student put it
more gently, “People copy on a test because they are
not ambitious enough to learn.” One student stated his
view simply: “People who cheat are lazy.” These views
are too simple and specific to cover all circumstances;
however, they can often be applied.

Cheating paraphernalia

to fight this attitude must be willing to risk losing the
acceptance of those who hold it and must be very
persistent and persuasive. The student, on the other
hand, should be aware that peer pressure can be very
effective. Even if one prevents only one person from
cheating, something has been accomplished. This
direct student-to-student approach is most often more
effective than an appeal to a professor. One needs
evidence to go to a professor, and this is often difficult
to obtain. Besides, cheating is generally acceptable
within the student code of camaraderie whereas “rat-
ting” is not.

Some people, especially professors, believe that stu-
dents should transcend this minimal responsibility and
speak directly with the professor. One professor
equated it to a criminal act: “|t’s like the law where one
is legally obligated to report a crime. A student has a
responsibility to do something (about cheating).”
Some students agree with this professor’s view, but
feel that it is difficult to practice. Someone has to have
a strong ethical sense and must be a strong person
before he could tell on afellow student.” Could you tell
on a fellow student? Would you feel obligated to tell?

What Are the Professors’ Responsibilities?

What Are the Students’ Responsibilities?

Given that people cheat for whatever reasons, what
are the students’ responsibilities to counteract it? Do
students even have such responsibilities? Do students
and professors have different viewpoints?

The minimal responsibility a student can have is to
“embarrass the person who cheats and to let him know
he has a low opinion of him,” said one professor.
Although a professor might think that this is an easy
task, he is mistaken. Where cheating is a major prob-
lem, an attitude pervades within the student popula-
tion that cheating is acceptable. One person who tries

Professors, as well as students, have the responsibil-
ity to control cheating. Professors’ views on their duty
ranges from that they have no responsibilityto monitor
examinations to that they must police examinations to
the degree of taking note of every student's seating
location. Students feel that it is the professors’ respon-
sibility to take control in a situation they feel powerless
to control.

One professor’s responsibility to examine is the
monitoring of examinations. Some professors believe
that they have none. Said one: ‘‘I should be able to
leave the room during the exam.” Other professors
disagree, such as the one who said: “A professor
should do his best to make conditions such so a stu-

 

dent doesn’t have the opportunity to cheat. Because of
crowded conditions in large classes it is difficult, but
the professor should try to see that an exam is moni-
tored.” Students virtually unanimously agree with the
student who said: ‘‘It is the professor’s responsibility to
make sure cheating doesn’t occur so it (the grading
scale) is fair to all students. A professor must maintain
equity in the classroom.”

One student gave an approximate test monitor-to-
student ratio of one to twenty—five. I believe that a
professor should carefully monitor examinations. Pitt
does not have an honor code by which the students
pledge to report all cheating on examinations, but
someone must take the responsibility. A student
should not have to be watching for cheating while he is
taking a test. He already has enough to worry about.

Another responsibility of the professor is to tell his
students in the beginning of the term that he will not
tolerate cheating, and to back up his words early in the
semester. As one student said: “He should take action
in the beginning of the semester before things get out

of control.” People will most often not cheat if they
believe that they might be caught. Examine this for
yourself. Do people cheat in those professors’ classes
who let it be known that they will not only take action
when it is found that cheating has occurred but will
also actively search for cheaters?

A professor's primary responsibility was succintly
summarized by a student: “A professor’s responsibility
is to insure that his students have learned the mate-
rial.” A professor has failed to do this if he allows
students to pass his class by cheating. Therefore, he
should try his best to prevent cheating.

On reflection upon this article, one thought stays in
my mind: the student who never cheats and is in
classes where cheating occurs is often left with no
recourse. Often he cannot even prove that cheating
has occurred. Somehow students and faculty must
join to maintain fair classroom situations for all stu-
dents. This can only be accomplished when students
and professors both accept their responsibility to stop
cheating.

Professor's Checklist for Cheating Prevention

1. Let your students know in the beginning of the
term that cheating will not be tolerated in your class.
Continue to stress this point throughout the entire
term.

2. Try to give examinations in large rooms so that
the students can be spread out. Besides making it
more difficult to cheat, this makes it more comforta-
ble for the student, "especially during an open book
exam.

3. Monitor your tests. Ask for assistance from your
teaching assistants if your class is large.

4. Collect copies of experimental data during the
laboratory period. Also, go to the various experi-
ment stations during the course of each class and
determine if the students are actually performing
the experiment and collecting their own data.
Remember, cheaters are often excellent bluffers.

5. Alter experiments from previous years when pos-
sible to prevent copying from old reports.

6. in order to be fair to all students, place copies of
old examinations on reserve in the library or change
your examinations from year to year. This will pre-
vent those students who have access to old tests
from having an unfair advantage in your class.

7. Most importantly, show concern for your stu-
dents, and try to create a situation in which students
are graded fairly according to their own merits.

Student’s Checklist For Cheating Prevention

1. Examine your current actions in your classes. Do
you believe that you are cheating in any way? If you
are, is it right for you to do this? Do not cheat.

2. Encourage your friends and classmates not to
cheat. Never condone cheating by not speaking-up ;
about it to them. :

3. Do not allow anyone to copy from you. Do not
loan your computer programs and old reports to
people who will copy them from you.

4. If a situation merits it, speak to your professor. If
he does not take any action, speak to the depart-
ment chairperson. ’

5. Most importantly, try to foster the attitude that
cheating is wrong, and voice your opinions.
Remember that the professor is not the only person
who is responsible for curbing cheating.

SK/-ITH AUTOCOLOR, users

can synthesize three-dimen-
sional, shaded images of design con-
cepts on a color display and then
quickly explore how major or minor
changes affect the overall aesthetic
impression. The system is com-
pletely interactive. By choosing from
a menu on the screen, the designer
can redefine display parameters,
select a viewing orientation, or mix
a color. Each part of an object can
be assigned a surface type with
associated color and reflectance
properties. Built-in lighting controls
generate realistic “highlights” on
simulated surfaces composed of dif-
fering materials.

Before developing the system,
David Warn, a computer scientist
at the General Motors Research
Laboratories, observed the complex
lighting effects achieved in the stu-
dio of a professional photographer.

A highly advanced design tool developed at the General Motors
Research Laboratories uses computers to generate visual images
from mathematical data with such accuracy that, soon,
in-depth aesthetic evaluations of new concepts may be made
prior to creating a costly physical model.

By simulating these effects, Auto-
color can produce results unattain-
able by conventional synthetic
image display systems. Previous
systems used a point source model
of light, which allows adjustments
only in position and brightness.

The versatility of the lighting
controls constitutes a major advance
in Autocolor. An unlimited number
of light sources can be indepen-
dently aimed at an object and the
light concentration adjusted to sim-
ulate spotlight and ﬂoodlight effects.
The lighting model even includes
the large ﬂaps or “barndoors” found
on studio lights. These comprehen-
sive controls permit the user to View
the simulation in studio lighting con-
ditions, as well as to make revisions
in color, paint type, and materials.

With real lights, direction and
concentration are produced by reﬂec-
tors, lenses, and housings. It would
be possible to model these compo-
nents directly, but that would intro-
duce considerable overhead to the
lighting computation. Instead of
modeling individual causes, Auto-
color models the overall effect, reduc-
ing complexity by simulating those
aspects needed to produce realistic
results.

Autocolor approximates the
geometric shape of an object with
a mesh of three or four-sided poly-
gons. These polygons are grouped
to form parts. For a car body, there
might be separate parts for the door,
hood, roof, fender, and so on. Each
part is assigned a surface type, such
as painted metal or glass, and each
type of surface has associated color
and reflectance properties. The

Ali Baba

Ali Baba — not quite an Arabian Knight, but in time it
will be equally as famous!

Located at 404 South Craig Street in Oakland, rather
than the Middle East, Ali Baba’s restaurant offers good,
non—fast food for the not so rich college student!

Nadin Nassar and lvin Makhoul, co-owners of Ali’s,
started the restaurant thirteen years ago as a means to
complete graduate school at their respective universi-
ties — Pittsburgh and Duquesne. It began as a little
counter diner serving only deli sandwiches. But the
area was strictly a residential one at the time, and in
order to stay alive they had to expand with a bigger,
broader concept. After two renovations and ten years
experience, Ali Baba became what it is today — an
authentic mid-eastern family diner.

The Brown Bag

At the time that this article was written, the Brown
Bag at 3235 Forbes Avenue was planning on a grand
opening before the beginning ofApril. They serve cus-
tomers Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m.—5 p.m.
and were doing a good business, even though the shop
was still in the process of being renovated. Once it
really opens, there will be more room for dining, but
they also have take out.

The idea of the owner, Martin Burger, who owns two
other Brown Bag stores in Pittsburgh, is to be like a
New York-style delicatessen. Left to the customer’s
choosing, they serve a variety of deli sandwiches for
$2.25, with up to three kinds of meat, cheese, lettuce,
tomato, on either white, rye, wheat, pita bread, a bagel
or a croissant. They also feature four daily specials.

Cooks You May Have Missed

by Laurie Peach and Carmen Whitson

Lunch is served from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday
through Friday, with a separate menu for supper which
runs from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. seven days a week.

The main courses include the house speciality of
Shish—Kebeb — tender chuncks of lamb barbecued to
taste, Kafta Kebeb — spiced ground lamb barbecued
on a skewer, lamb shank roasted in a specially pre-
pared sauce, and even Sheik El-Makshi which is
roasted eggplant stuffed with ground lamb, pignolia
nuts, and sliced onion. All ofthe dishes are accompan-
ied by rice, a salad with house dressing, and pita bread.

For lunch, one of the selections is a student special
for $2.95. It consists of a dish of rice, pignolia nut salad,
and a choice of Bazila, Loobee or Bamia, (peas, green
beans, or okra cooked with lamb and tomato sauce).
There are many more courses available including ala
carte specials of yogurt, grape leaves, fetta cheese,
salads, spinach pie, or just a bowl of soup.

All of the food is strictly Syrian or Lebanese, and the
restaurant boasts of having a separate cook for each
respective country.

The decor is modern American, and the atmosphere
is informal. So if one‘s tastebuds are hankering for
something a little bit different and one’s pocketbook
isn’t quite bulging, Ali Baba’s is an excellent choice for
an adventurous meal! (And one doesn't need to know
the secret password ‘Open Sesame’ to enter!)

Two of them are a certain meat and cheese on a bagel
with fruit for $1.75, and two are a specific sandwich,
fruit, and chips for $3.00.

Christal Perich, the manager of the Forbes Avenue
Brown Bag, remembers eating too much junk food
while in college. She therefore offers some alternatives
and often has special discounts for Pitt students. They
sell granola bars, cheese chunks, raw vegetables and
fruit for a quarter: apples, oranges, pears, bananas,
and seedless grapes to go.

They also have a chef’s salad for $1.75 which
includes ham, turkey, swiss cheese and egg. For des-
sert they offer various kinds of cheesecake like NY-
style grasshopper (chocolate-lime), amaretto, and for
the same price of $1.25, they have apple strudel, carrot
cake, and German chocolate cake.

Some items are made in the store like a homemade
dip, blue cheese dressing, ham salad, and egg salad.
Don’t bother asking Christal forthe recipes, though, as
she refuses to give them out. Other items in the deli are
brought in fresh daily.

Another aspect of the deli is its catering menu which
is a favorite of hospital employees. The Brown Bag will
make up food trays with cheese chunks, sandwich
meats, fruit, vegetables, and desserts, charging an
amount based on the number of people it serves. An
orginal item on the menu, which may explain the name
of the establishment, is the “Working Lunch” for$3.00.
It consists of a sandwich (your choice), a bag of chips,
fruit, mustard, mayonaise, napkins and utensils in a
paper bag. You couldn’t ask for more!

As Christal stated, it’s a unique deli. Its concept is to
serve any type of deli sandwich the customer desires,
(as long as it’s not too disgusting). The variety of food
and original specials are impressive for such a small
place. It can be found squeezed between other shops
near Forbes Hall, and is worth the search. So watch for
the grand opening specials!

Located in Wellsboro, DA, the Jesse Dobinson Manor is an imposing brick
Queen Anne mansion built in 1886. What captures the eye first is the grand size of
the manor, with its beautiful wrap—around latticed porch, column supported
balconies, and high medieval chimney spires. On close inspection. one will see
original stained and leaded glass windows, etched glass double Front doors, a solid
cherry grand staircase, Milton tiles, pocket doors, and parquet flooring. The house
is furnished with antiques and reproductions collected by the family over the years.
There are ﬁve bedrooms, two full baths, two half baths, dining room, living room, family
room, kitchen, and a sitting room that was once a library. éince the house was built,
it has been a private home, a boarding house, apartments, a church, a dental ollice,
and is now the Bed and Breakfast that you see here.

Technical experts have become a vital part of the
American judicial process. In general, an attorney will
seek the assistance of a technical expert in cases
involving a settlement over $1 0,000. A technical expert
may aid the legal system in three ways. The expert can
consult with and advise the attorney on the technical
matters of the case. He may assist in the examination
and cross examination of other experts. The technical
expert may also serve as a witness in the actual trial
process. Participation of engineers and other scient-
ists in the legal system is a very important public
service.

Attorneys use several channels in seeking out tech-
nical experts. The Technical Advisory Service for
Attorneys (TASA) is a nationwide agency which refers
lawyers to experts in nearly any case. In other
instances,attorneys contact universities to find
authorities in their field of interest. A doctorate (Ph.D.)
degree is considered a requirement for consideration
as an expert. In some states, certification is also neces-
sary. Most importantly, experience with the aspect of
the case in which the authority will be used is essential.

The major responsibility of the engineer serving as a
technical expert is the reconstruction and analysis of
the event in question.

To hold a manufacturer responsible for an accident,
a defect must be discovered which would have either
caused the accident or contributed to the damages
incurred. The engineer must discoverthis and detem—
lne its overall significance.

Failures can occur due to design inadequacies such
as not anticipating conditions of service. Processing
and fabrication failures arise due to improper heat
treatment, forging and casting defects, etc. Environ-
mental and service deterioration can occur due to cor-
rosion, creep, poor maintenance, improper inspection,
etc. The expert must study the conditions of the event
and reconstruct scenarios that accommodate these
conditions. The expert should always research inde-
pendently and not consult with the attorney until the
expert has completed his study. The attorney and the
technical expert should then carefully review the
details of the case before any testimony is initiated.

In this type of case, witnesses are required to make
depositions before the actual trial begins. The deposi-
tion is a sworn statement answering questions posed

In researching for this article, this author inter-
vieweded Dr. Charles Beroes of the Chemical and
Petroleum Engineering Department. Dr. Beroes has
rendered his services in over 100 cases and is consi-
dered an expert in cases dealing with: flammable
fabrics, fires and explosions, toxic chemicals and
chemical burns. He discussed past and present
cases in addition to information pertaining to expert
testimony.

Objective discussion of court cases, high settle-
ments, and how to win them would provoke a very
cynical attitude toward the entire matter. However,
one must return and contemplate the purpose this
process serves. Dr. Beroes showed the author pic-
tures of burn victims in flammable fabrics cases
including photographs of a two and ahalf year old
child who was awarded ten and a half million dol-
lars. The child was wearing cotton flannel pajamas
which ignited and burned her entire body from the
neck down. Dr. Beroes explained the reasons why
high percentage burns cause such difficulty.

The epidermis, the largest organ of the body, pre-
vents loss of body fluids, shields against bacteria,
houses sensitive nerve endings, and acts as a ther-
mometer monitoring temperature changes. It can
no longer function when a significant portion of it is
burned. Scar tissue caused by a serious burn is
called “keloid." Keloid differs from healthy skin in
two important ways. This tissue does not have the
ability to insulate as normal skin does. Also, this
tissue does not stop growing after the wound heals
as normal skin would. Keloid continues to thicken
and eventually begins to contract and pull normal
tissue out of place causing deformity.

Several medical procedures are implemented to
offset the effects of serious burns. Sheets of skin
removed from another part of the body are grafted
over the injured region. This procedure is relatively
effective in preventing infection, yet, prominent
scarring still occurs. Patients are now wearing a

special garment called a “jobst” garment which app-
lies uniform pressure to the burned skin helping to
lessen the degree of deformity. But as the keloid
grows and tightens, deformities worsen.

Surgery is required every few years to alleviate the
tension caused by the contraction of the scartissue
in severe cases. A z-shaped incision is made
through the scarred area and normal skin is grafted
into the scarred region. As the normal skin grows
into the scar tissue, it helps to add elasticity to the
region. New treatments are continually being deve-
loped to aid in the recuperation of burn victims;
however, scarring still poses a formidable problem.

The presence of scar tissue in place of healthy
skin causes a variety of other health problems. As
keloid contracts it may alter bone arrangement
depending on the location of the injury. Scartissue
may interfere with the functions of other organs.
Scar tissue is also especially susceptible to skin
cancer. Since keloid is not an effective insulator, the
skin's ability to regulate body temperature is hin-
dered. For this reason, victims of severe burns must
always protect themselves from overexposure. The
damage caused by a serious burn is not fully repara-
ble and causes lifelong problems for the victim.

Initially, a settlement of ten and a half million
dollars to the child who can’t be cured, as described
previously, seemed outrageous. Had not the dam-
age already been done? How could you put a price
on someone’s suffering that way? Does it not all
seem like an insult? Maybe it does at first. However,
this is a child facing a long life with a severe handi-
cap requiring frequent and expensive medical
attention. Part of the settlement was awarded to
compensate for suffering, but most of it is coverage
for past, present, and future medical expenses.

It was important that a good expert witness was
there to testify on her behalf. What is so outrageous
about that?

21

by the opposing attorney. The expert presents his find-
ings to the court for the first time in his deposition. The
expert should make certain the attorney understands
his findings completely before depositions are
initiated. The attorney can then develop the most
effective lines of questioning for the opposing wit-
nesses’ depositions. This is part ofthe process through
which an attorney builds his strategy for making the
necessary conclusions apparent to the jury. The wit-
ness should be certain he does not contradict any of
his previously written work while giving the deposition.
Therefore, proper preparation is essential. Con-
currently, the attorney assisting the expert questions
the witnesses for the opposition in their depositions.
Careful cooperation between the lawyer and the tech-
nical expert at this stage is crucial. Both will analyze
and consult on all of the depositions in preparation for
the actual trial.

Before the actual trial begins, the expert should
arrange his schedule so as to be able to attend the
entire trial and continue to consult with the attorney for
the entire proceeding. When the expert gives his actual
testimony, he should rememberto speak articulately in
layman’s terms and carefully explain all technical
vocabulary used. The expert must be careful not to use
language that the jurors cannot understand. Other-
wise, the testimony will be worthless. The witness
should also be careful not to patronize thejurors orthe
judge. The most effective method to make jurors
understand technical concepts is to use stories or
analogies to explain ideas. This allows the listeners to
transfer their understanding of one subject to another.
The witness should prepare himself emotionally for
taking the stand to avoid “stage fright” which could
damage the effectiveness of the testimony.

Special care must be exercised in the preparation of
visual aids. At least one to three minutes should be
allotted for each slide. Making sure the jury has suffi-
cient time to study the slides will improve the chance
that they will be remembered. Models and figures
should be constructed to scale to avoid the question of
intentional deception. Painstaking care must be taken
in planning a demonstration. Any demonstration must
work or the case will be at serious risk. Again, simplic-
ity is imperative if possible.

To be a successful technical witness, the engineer

must also familiarize himself with the mechanics ofthe
judicial system. The judge decides if a witness is quali-
fied as an expert through a process called voir dire. In
this process the attorney attempts to qualify his expert
by discussng his strong points in relation to the case.
The expert’s areas of research are explored as well as
his affiliations with any related professional societies.
The opposing attorney will attempt to disqualify the
witness by stressing his weak points in relation to the
case. If the witness has had a great deal of practical
technical experience, the opposing lawyer may
emphasize lack of academics and publications. Like-

According to Dr. Beroes, an experienced expert
witness: ‘‘If a product or system or process can be
made safer by an economically and technologically
feasible change in design, then the product or system
or process is unreasonably dangerous and defective.”

wise, if the expert is strong academically the opposing
attorney may accuse him of having no real experience
in the matter. If the opposing attorney succeeds in
disqualifying the technical witness, then the judge will
not permit this witness to give testimony in court.

If the expert does testify, he must realize that the
opposing attorney will do all that he can to discredit his
testimony in front of the jury. The opposing attorney
will attempt to impeach the expert, that is, catch the
expert in a. contradition. A simple contradition will
invalidate the witness's entire testimony. The oppos-

22

ing attorney will attempt to trap the expert, and the
expert must remain calm and mild mannered during
questioning. If the expert does not give the opposing
attorney a point on which to discredit the testimony,
the opposing attorney will try to develop one.

A good expert will be prepared forthese techniques.
For instance, the opposing attorney may ask a series of
questions which are answered affirmatively to try to
trick the expert into answering affirmatively to a ques-
tion he would have normally answered negatively. In
some cases the opposing attorney will narrow his
questions to the point of entrapment or follow a line of
questioning that leads to an illogical end. The oppos-
ing attorney may attempt to coerce an estimate from
the expert saying, “How much? Ten? A hundred? A
thousand? A million?” The other lawyer mayflatterthe
witness to get him to answerquestions out of his range
of expertise. The expert should always remember to
listen carefullyto the question putto him and to keep in
mind that the answer ‘‘I don’t know” is less damaging
than a mistaken answer. The witness should answer
the questions as concisely as possible and refrain from
volunteering information.

Usually the opposing attorney questions the techni-
cal expert about the compensation he receives for his
services. As a general rule, the fee an expert requires
should be in line with the fee he accepts for similar
cases of consulting work. The expert should always
charge a flat fee independent of the outcome of the
case. If the remuneration is contingent on the outcome
of the case, biased testimony on the part of the expert
is more likely in the eyes of the jury. The witness must
dispel the notion of “mercenary testimony” by striving
to remain neutral.

Another legal distinction that many don’t under-
stand is the difference between theterms “possible" or
“probably." The description “probable” should be
used only to describe a scenario which would occur
over 50% of the time. “Possible” describes any scena-
rio which could occur. Though many individuals don’t
understand this difference, the legal system does. A
witness may mistakenly identify something “possible”
as “probable.” A clever attorney will capitalize on this
type of mistake without the witness even under-
standing what he did.

Two of the most important responsibilities of the
technical expert are his responsibilities to himself and
to his profession. One should realize that giving a
useless or damaging testimony will not only hurt the
case, but also damage the individual expert’s reputa-
tion and damage the reputation of his profession. The
witness must be honest and sincere. To be credible,
the expert must remain neutral. In cases where con-
flicting opinions between experts are presented, credi-
bility in the jury’s eyes is the deciding factor. The
expert witness can insure his believability by limiting
his discussion to subjects within his range of expertise.
The expert delivers testimony under a sworn oath
under penalty of perjury. If the expert does not believe
in a case, he should not accept it or testify to anything
he doesn't honestly believe. These are the technical
expert’s greatest responsibilities.

-lhlere are several reasons one may propose to
explain the recent growth of robotics in industry:
_ improved software capabilities, the need for access to

E»/;,,, hazardous areas and outer space, or a call for
Q,  improved quality and consistency in manufacturing.
  Nevertheless, interest in robotics has grown amazingly
vvvv »r "  over the past few years. American Robot Corporation,

1 a relatively new company located here in Pittsburgh,

has had its revenues increase 300 percent in 1984. Dr.
 Romesh Wadhwani, chairman and chief executive
officer, explains American Robot’s impact on injustry:
“Our company has achieved its excellent customer
reputation and strong financial position by aggres-
sively attacking the market, through domestic and
international agreements. For example, we signed a
multi-million dollar agreement with Daikin Industries
Ltd. of Osaka, Japan this year (1984). By doing this,
American Robot became the first company in approxi-
mately fifteen years to successfully license American
computer integrated manufacturing (ClM) technology
to the Japanese. With forty of the Fortune 100 compan-
ies in the U.S. as our customers, we expect to grow
200% in 1985.”

23

Noting the increased use of robots in industry and
manufacturing, Skyscraper Engineer began looking
into how one may become involved in the field of
robots. Here we explore the educational opportunities
at Carnegie-Mellon University’s Robotics Institute

The Robotics Institute was founded in 1979 wit.
grant of one million dollars per year for five years from
Westinghouse. CMU was asked to helpthe company in
automating their manufacturing, including work in
metal processing, electronic device assembly, and
higher level factory control. At aboutthe same time the
Institute received a grant from the Office of Naval
Research to do basic research of robotic mobility,
such as the development of a device which could navi-
gate underwater completely independently.

Since that time, funding to the Robotics Institute has
grown to about ten million dollars annually. A little
more than half of their research’ is in robotic manufac-
turing, while about one-third of it is in robot mobility in
a variety of applications. This is a more fundamental
technology than manufacturing because it includes a
wider range of problems. The remainder of the Insti-
tute’s research is of core technology which is relevent
to all robotic applications. It includes such areas as
sensors and vision systems.

The Robotics Institute is a research institute; it is not
an academic department. It has no classes orteaching
responsibilities, but it draws about half of its people
from various academic departments at the university,
primarily electrical, mechanical, civil and chemical
engineering, and computer science. Students in these
departments can become involved at the Robotics
Institute in one of three ways. Many faculty members
working in the Institute bring graduate students with
them. These students, usually funded by external
research contracts, do their thesis work within one of
the robotics labs. Undergraduate students can
become involved in the Robotics Institute by working
as technicians. This is usually arranged as work
study,half-time work, or as a sum merjob. A third way a
student may become involved is to take courses taught
by Robotics Institute faculty. Many such engineering
courses include robotics ideas. An E.E. course on con-
trol, for example, would deal with robotics, as would a
Mech. E. course on manufacturing.

Once a student becomes associated with the Robot-
ics Institute, 13 different labs provide a very diverse
range ofwork in which he or she may become involved.
In one lab concerned with flexible assembly, students
are designing mechanical devices such as grippers. In
another, students are working as programmers. In a
third lab students work with industrial robots as skilled
technicians. A group of civil engineering students
worked on a contract to develop a remote controlled

24

Robots

device to go into the Three Mile Island reactor. The
group built this reconnaissance vehicle in a matter of
months.

While CMU’s Robotics Insitute has been very suc-
cessful (it has had contracts with some 25 companies,
including ALCOA, American Robot, and Westing-
house), its “research capacities are developed way
ahead of their impact on undergraduate and graduate
training,” as J. Todd Simonds, Associate Director,
Office of Administration explains. In order to take full
advantage of the institute’s successes, the deans and
department chairmen should decide how to incorpo-
rate it into education. They are working toward a more
formal curriculum in robotics courses. Simonds sug-
gests a 4-6 course series, possibly across several
departments, which would be of interest to all of them.
The series would include areas such as mechanics,
control, artificial intelligence, sensors, and also eco-
nomics of robot applications.

Although a formal robotics curriculum does not yet
exist at CMU, the research at the Robotics Institue
provides an opportunity for experience which can lead
to a career in robotics. Because robotics research is
relatively new, about a third of the students that gradu-
ate after working at the Institute are hired back by the
Institute to do research. A large part of the graduates

go on to work for the corporate sponsors of the lnsi— ‘

tute. In any event, most of the graduates use their
experiences in robotics in their work.

entire data structure is stored in

data base developed at the GM
Research Laboratories.

I HE LIGHTING model deter-
mines the intensity of the re-
ﬂected light that reaches the eye
from a given point on the object. It
takes into account the reﬂectance
properties of the surface as well as
the physics of light reﬂection. A hid-
den surface algorithm determines
which point on the object is visible
at each point on the display. For each
of these visible points, the inten-
sity is computed for each light
source. The displayed intensity is
the sum of the contributions from
all the lights plus an ambient term
which indicates the general level of
illumination.

Using the point source lights
of conventional image generation
systems, highlighting a particular
area of an object can be a difficult
task and can result in unwanted
highlights in other areas. By
contrast, the light direction and
concentration controls found in
Autocolor make it possible to iso-
late the effect of a light to a partic-
ular area, and achieve a desired
highlight easily and quickly (see
Figure 2). This is not because
Autocolor’s lighting model compu-
tations are faster, but because its
controlled “lights” behave in a more
natural way.

Another unique feature of
Autocolor is the ability to portray
realistically a variety of different
materials and lighting conditions.

The color seen from a surface is
really a combination of two colors:
the color of the surface or material
itself (diffuse reflection) and the
color of the reflected highlights
(specular reﬂection). The highlight
color may be the color of the mate-
rial, the color of the light, or a color
derived from the material and the
light.

A different highlight color can
be used for each different surface
type that is defined. This makes it
possible to simulate materials such
as plastic, painted metal, and
chrome—each of which has differ-
ent reﬂectance properties and re-
quires a different highlight color.

The user can interactively
adjust the blending of the surface
and highlight colors, watching the
image change dynamically on the
screen until a desired effect is
achieved.

“Autocolor will free designers
to be more creative? says researcher
Wam. “Our goal is to move from con-
trols that show changes in lighting,
color, and materials, to software that
will let the user change the actual
shape, manipulating the image on
the screen like a ﬂexible clay model?’

Dean Yates Will Retire

Associate Dean Campbell C. Yates will retire on
April 30 following almost 40 years of service to the
University of Pittsburgh’s Engineering School. Dean
Yates graduated from Pitt in 1942 having earned a
Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineer-
ing with an aerospace option. In 1949 he completed
studies leading to a Master of Science degree in
mechanical engineering. Dean Yates’ teaching career
at Pitt began in 1946 as an assistant professor. His
career continued as head of the aerospace option dur-
ing the 1950s and 603. In 1972 he was appointed chair-
man ofthe mechanical engineering department, and in
October of 1984 he was promoted to the position of
Associate Dean.

Dean Yates’ research has been primarily experimen-
tal and has included, among other things, a large
amount of engineering environments work studying
the effects of vibrations, salt spray, extreme tempera-
tures, etc. His most recent research has been in the
development of a mobile facility for rotating tests of
gas turbines using coal derived fuel in conjunction
with Jones and Laughlin Steel's coke oven plant.

Following his retirement, Dean Yates has no specific
plans; he and his wife intend to stay in the Pittsburgh
area. The staff of Skyscraper Engineer joins the rest of
the School in wishing Dr. Yates avery enjoyable retire-
merit.

SWE Hosts High School Sleepover

For the first time in conjunction with Career Day on
February 23, which 270 high school seniors and their
parents attended, the Society of Women Engineers
held an overnight for seventeen girls with aseminar on
“How to Cope at Pitt.” The girls were met by their
hostesses between 12:30 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. and taken
to lunch. Then in the afternoon SWE members gave
short seminars on computers, professors, study hab-
its, on and off campus activities, and choosing one’s
home away from home. Afterwards, there was a pizza
party forthe girls andtheir hostesses.The evening was
spent going to the movies, ice skating, or checking out

UTA’s and SAC’s R.S.V.P.

Opportunities exist for undergraduates to become
math undergraduate teaching assistants (UTA) or Student
Academic Counselors (SAC).

A math UTA conducts a 3A-Algebra or 3B-
Trigonometry recitation. There is a time commitment of five
hours per week for office hours, recitation hours, and a
supervision meeting. This program demands a personal
commitment to helping others and the maturity and respon-
sibility needed to conduct oneself as a paraprofessional.
The position presupposes a general knowledge of
mathematics and confidence in one’s algebra and
trigonometry ability.

An SAC conducts group and individual study skills ses-
sions which are held at the Learning Skills Center. SAC’s
are prepared to teach the processes and skills that are
utilized in textbook reading, lecture note-taking, memory
improvement, time management, and preparing for and
taking exams. In addition, the student counselors are also
trained to assist their peers in learning to apply general
study methods to specific courses.

UTA and SAC candiates register and take the course
(CAS 64) ‘Seminar in Peer Helping.’ This three credit
course is offered through the Learning Skills Center. Can-
didates for either area of ‘Seminar in Peer Helping’ must be
undergraduates, preferaby about to enter the sophomore
orjunior year, who have an above average and stable QPA.
Students selected for these positions are compensated
monetarily for their services. If you feel that becoming a
peer helper will enhance your college experience, more in-
formation and application packages are available from the
Learning Skills center, 311 William Pitt Union, 624-5481.

Freshmen Select Departments

This year the electrical engineering department
decided to limit the number of incoming freshmen to
130. Of the 149 students who applied to the depart-
ment, everyone who had a 2.0 or better quality point
average and met the grade requirements for certain
classes was accepted. This brought the list down to the
accepted limit of 130. The other departments set no
limit on how many students they would accept. The

Congratulations to Albert Balluch, who amazingly
went through the scavenger-hunt type Skycaper in
record breaking time. For his herculean efforts, Big Al
has become a moderately rich young man, who can
now afford anything under $25. M3 would like to thank
all the good folks who put forth a worthy attempt at this
Skycaper, the solution of which is described below.

The sum of the answers to the five simple exercises
was 6,242,551. After dialing 624-2551, the competitors
were told to go to (hint) Benedum. The hint was 11?+1
which equals 122. M3 gave a short puzzle to those who
came to room 122. After solving this puzzle, the super
sleuths called M3 for the last clue. This was to solve for
100! exactly.

Big Al found all 157 digits of 100! by writing a short

it by hand and would like to thank the McDonald Doug-
las Corporation of California for verifying his answer.

Four Years

And now, we stand, four years later.

Four years.‘ About that long ago I remember mulling
about at a dance at Forbes Quadrangle during freshman
orientation, painting my first dorm room on a hot August
day, and using my campus map to find unfamiliar places
like “Thaw Hall,” “Old Engineering Hall,” and “The
Chemistry Building.” Now, three dorm rooms, two score
textbooks, three dozen professors, and quite a few nights
of dancing later, I sit late in the evening looking out my win-
dow at the city lights of Forbes Avenue and think of gradua-
tion and four college years and life — I can’t seem to think
of any one of these three without the other two entering in-
to the picture.

In what now seems an astonishingly short span of time,
I and several thousand other people, more or less like me
and more or less very different, have gone through a pro-
cess that has educated and exasperated us, forced us to
look at our values, ideas and perceptions and goals —
ourse/ves—and given us experiences of gut-wrenching
laughter and heart rending tears. We stand now, soon to
move on fr_om a community which has housed, fed,
nurtured, en/tertained, and most of all taught us — about the
world, each other, and ourselves. We stand now, a pack of
intellectual tools slung across our shoulders, soon to greet
the world in an embrace of heightened understanding and
ambitious sense of purpose.

The University is a surprising instituion. its basic
premise is that it can bring together 20,000 or so people of
different ages, interests, races and religions, from
throughout our state, country and world, and uniquely serve
each oftheir desires foreducation. Most surprising is that,
to a large degree, the University accomplishes this her-
culean task — peacefully, proudly and, yes, with an at-
mosphere frequently teeming with fun. In few places, it
seems, is such intense intellectual activityjuxtaposed with
such intensely and creatively pursued merriment. But this
is the inevitable result of giving free run to the minds of
young men and women who as never before are at once
charged with energy and enthusiasm — intellectually,
physically, emotionally, spiritually. The results are often un-
predictable, frequently rewarding, and never dull.

From the perspective of one who is about to graduate,
I offer here some thoughts (you might even call it friendly ad-
vice) forthose who will soon — it will seem sooner than you

circumstances.

might think — be looking back on four (or so) years as well.

We in the School of Engineering are in a circumstance
different in many ways from that of our fellows in other areas
of the University. Engineering education involves a
technical, highly specialized program of study, offering both
benefits and potential disadvantages. We have acquired
skills which society deems sufficiently valuable to pay for
with comparatively large sums of money. As a discipline
and career, engineering can be exciting and highly rewar-
ding — its fundamental goal is no less than service to
mankind and the betterment of man's condition using the
potent tools of science and technology. At the same time it
must be remembered that there is much more to life than
one’s job, and there is far more to college than job
preparation.

It is unfortunate that some college students — and cer-
tainly not only engineering students —— very early on in their
four years develop a “job orientation.” Classes are viewed
not as to whether they are interesting, challenging or
valuable for personal satisfaction and development, but
rather as to whether they are relevant to one’s career. Par-
ticipation in extracurricular activities is done with an eye
towards one’s resume, rather than for the purpose of
developing one’s leadership skills, improving one’s interac-
tions with others or revelling in the sheer personal satisfac-
tion of accomplishing goals through commitment and
cooperation. Fortunately, the nature of college tends to
subtly expand the perspectives of even the most pragmatic
careerists, who may well find themselves thinking that, yes
that English literature class was actually enjoyable or realiz-
ing that they are putting far more time into Engineers’ Week
(and getting far more out of it) than is necessary for them to
claim participation on a resume.

Don't misunderstand — a career certainly forms a
large part of one’s life and will affect how much time one has
outside of work as well as how one can spend this leisure
time. For those fortunate enough to work in a field that they
truly enjoy, distinctions between vocation and avocations
may pleasantly blend, and the term “job” may seem inap-
propriately applied to their work. But college offers a rare
opportunity for exploration that should not be bypassed or
used half-heartedly. Here in the University is created a uni-
quely sheltered environment: a little world complete with
governments, journalists, social and political organizations,
sports teams, libraries, parks and shops, sages, jesters and
folks like you and I. Here is offered perhaps a last chance
at essentially complete personal freedom — before the
commitments of a full time job or a family take precedence

in one’s life. (Although, for some, these responsibilites have
already been undertaken.) For those in the midst of their
college years, now is the time to test one’s creativity and im-
agination, a time to explore a world of possibilities. Have
you ever wanted to write a newspaper or magazine article?
Go ahead! Thought you’d like to have atry at acting or sing-
ing or playing intramural soccer? Do it! Care to learn sign
language? Go for it! A world of options exists for one’s ex-
ploration and enjoyment, options far too valuable and rare
to pass by.

academic programs themselves. Career preparation in-
volves two major steps: choosing a career, then preparing
for it. The first of these steps is often relegated to secondary
importance while it is, in fact, the critically important factor.
How easy it is to make a career choice without having
become well informed, without having explored first-hand
a variety of options. Here is ample enough reason even for
the dedicated careerist to try to achieve as broad and
diverse an education as possible. When was the last time
you seriously considered an alternative major or career?
And not just, say, mechanical rather than chemical
engineering, but perhaps journalism or economics? Now is
the time; here is the place.

For many, including preprofessionals of other
disciplines such as medicine, a career decision is made in
high school. Indeed, for some the choice may have been
made in grade school. Not that there is anything in the least
wrong with this, as long as the final decision is based upon
actual experience in the chosen discipline, and not upon
perhaps ill-conceived or misperceived high school notions
of what an engineer or a doctor or a physicist is and does.
This caution particularly applies to engineering since,
unlike other specialty schools in the University which allow
two years in the College of Arts and Sciences before

 

Nowhere are these options more prevalent thanin 

entering the chosen professional school, the School of
Engineering demands a decision (though certainly not one
written in stone) directly of high school seniors. The few
electives offered during the first two engineering years
allow a small degree of freedom: it is up to the individual to
make the best possible use of these and co-curricular op-
portunities to explore new areas or to see familiar areas in
a new light. Areas of interest can also be explored and
developed in parallel with one’s engineering (or other)
degree, resulting in a rich and satisfying academic
program.

College is the time for such exploration and testing of
interests. It is friendships and cooperation, disputes and
reconciliations. It is talking with good friends until three in
the morning, dressing up in costumes for the Engineers’
Week parade, having a discussion with a professor to clarify
an obscure thought, and experiencing a burst of satisfac-
tion upon finally realizing how to solve a troublesome prob-
lem. These four years are a time for working very hard as
one studies late into the night, and atime for doing nothing
much at all while watching a misty sunrise break over
Schenley Park. Bustling and hectic, challenging, confusing
and rewarding, college is most of all the opportunity for
growth. It is in large part to each of us what we choose to
make of it. The members of our graduating class exemplify
this growth and choice: students who have been band
members, leaders in the Engineering Student Cabinet,
members of campus religious groups and resident
assistants on their form floors; students who have worked
as many hours a week as they’ve had classes in order to
pay for their opportunities here, and a student with a fam-
ily and ajob who has attended school full time; an admittee
to Harvard law school, a student who travelled around the
world, University scholars and Chancel|or’s scholars; a var-
sity football player and countless intramural athletes;
artists, musicians, and many who have striven to do their
best while exploring and developing their own unique in-
terests: all in the process enriching each of our lives.

We have persevered for four years, and we have suc-
ceeded. Each graduate can be proud of that in its own right,
but even more so take comfort in knowing that these have
been four of the most challenging years of our lives.
Moments of supreme insight and foolish stupidity have
been experienced, often in rapid succession, yet we can
now look at our mistakes, grinning sheepishly at first, but
then smiling and finally breaking into loud laughter. We
laugh at our imperfectness, but we laugh filled with the
realization that we have survived: we have met the
challenge, we have learned, and now we stand, ready to
move on. Hope exists for all who have learned something
about themselves. Four or so years is hardly time to com-
plete this process; a lifetime may not suffice. but these
years have been —— and are yet to be for many — both a
foundation upon which to build and a glorious room in which
to have lived for a time. With continued diligence, the

lessons learned in the shelter of this room will be strong;

allies in the construction of a creative, satifying and produc-
tive future. We stand now and move on, greeting a lifetime
of challenges with the able lessons of these four years.
