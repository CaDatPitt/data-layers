Westinghouse desalting plants can make the sea an endless source of fresh water

Where can the earth's expanding pop-
ulation get the fresh water it needs?
We can get it from the endless supply
in the sea.

Desalting plants offer one of the

most practical solutions to the problem.

Since 1951, 57 Westinghouse de-
salting units have been installed around
the world. They are desalting millions
of gallons of water a day.

Westinghouse is prepared to start
building water—desalting facilities to
help solve water deficiencies for coastal
cities of any size—anywhere in the
world.

  Here are 7 knotty problems facing the
Air Force: can you help us solve one?

   

‘I. Repairs in space. if something goes
wrong with a vehicle in orbit, how can it
be fixed? Answers must be found, if large-
scale space operations are to become a
reality. For this and other assignments Air
Force scientists and engineers will be
called on to answer in the next few years,
we need the best brains available.

exact composition of
the lunar surface, as
well as structural

and propulsion char-
acteristics ofthe space
vehicle, enter into

this problem. Important study remains to
be done—and, as an Air Force officer,
you could be the one to do it!

3. life-support biology. The filling of
metabolic needs over very extended peri-
ods of time in space is one of the most
fascinating subjects that
Air Force scientists are in-
vestigating. The results
promise to have vital ram-
ifications for our life on
earth, as well as in outer
space.

 

 

4. Space orientation. The orbital prob-
lems of a spacecraft, including its ability
to maneuver over selected points on the
earth, are of vital importance to the mili-
tary utilization of space. There are plenty
of assignments for young,Air Force physi-
cists in this area.

5. Synergetic plane changing. The abil-
ity of a spacecraft to change altitude can
also be crucial to space operations.Where
but in the Air Force could Sc.B.’s get the
chance to work on such fascinating prot-
ects right at the start of their careers?

6. Space propulsion. As our
space flights cover greater

and greater distances, pro- ,,
pu|sion—more than any-
thing else—will become the
limiting factor. New fuels *
and new propulsion tech-
niques must be found, if we
are to keep on exploring
the mysteries of space. And
it may well be an Air Force
scientist on his first assign-
ment who makes the big
breakthrough!

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

7. Pilot performance.
important tests must still be
made to determine how the
pilots of manned aero-
spacecraft will react to
long periods away from
the earth. Of course
not every new Air
Force officer be-
comes involved in research and develop-
ment right away. But where the most ex-
citing advances are
taking place, young
Air Force scientists,
administrators,
pilots, and engineers
are on the scene.

Attention to detail is an old
Bell System habit. Or maybe you call
it thoroughness. Or follow—through.

Anyway, we attended to an interesting
detail recent|y—the effect of rain
on the microwave link between a
communications satellite and our
pioneer ground station antenna

at Andover, Maine.

If we could but measure the rain’s
effect, we could improve the design
of satellite ground stations.

The question was how.

Well, you often have to take your
laboratory tools where you find them,

=t

and in this case we found ours in
Cassiopeia A, a strong and stable
radio star that is always visible from
Andover. We measured the noise
power from Cassiopeia A during dry
periods, and then measured the
reduction during rainy periods. The
result could be expressed as a
formula and employed accurately in
designing future ground stations.

The initial success of our Te|star®
satellites proved the feasibility
of communicating via space.

But it also opened the door—or the
heavens—to a whole new technology
which we are now busily

exploring in every detail.

‘The deﬁnitions and derivation, plus further information on satellite

transmission degradation due to rainfall, may be found in the

RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES
IN HIGHWAY ENGINEERING

The Asphalt Institute Suggests Projects in 5 Vital Areas

 

Phenomenal advances in roadbuilding
techniques during the past decade have
made it clear that continued highway
research is a must.

Here are ﬁve important areas of
highway design and construction that
America’s roadbuilders need to know
more about.

If you or your department are plan-
ning research studies, you can make
important contributions to highway
technology through projects in one or
more of these areas:

Much remains to be done in the re-
ﬁnement of thickness design concepts
for asphalt pavement structures. Re-
search is required in areas of asphalt
rheology, behavior mechanisms of in-
dividual and combined layers of the
pavement structure, stage construc-
tion and pavement strengthening by
Asphalt overlays.

Traffic evaluation, essential for
thickness design, requires the develop-
ment of improved procedures for uti-
lizing loadometer and other traﬂic
data. These new procedures will more
adequately permit conversion of mixed
tralﬁc loads into terms of 18,000-lb.
single-axle loads as required by de-
sign guides of the American Associa-
tion of State Highway Officials, The
Asphalt Institute and others. Also
needed are better methods for pre-
dicting future traffic volumes and
characteristics.

Rational Thickness Design
and Materials Evaluation.

Materials Speciﬁcations and
Construction Quality-Control.

Needed are more scientiﬁc methods
of writing speciﬁcations, particularly
for determining rejection and accept-
ance criteria. Also urgently needed
are speedier methods for quality con-
trol tests at construction sites, such as
improved air- or water-permeability
procedures for controlling pavement
density.

Better and more positive methods are
needed in this area. Suggested are ex-
periments with two-layer systems and
investigations of differing roadbed

cross sections. A
a Traditional Lifts and
Thicker Lifts.

Rolling procedures, compaction equip-
ment and compaction testing-methods
for traditional thin lifts of asphalt

Drainage of Pavement
Structures.

Compaction of Pavements,

pavements need further study. The re-
cent use of much thicker lifts in as-
phalt pavement construction suggests
the need for new studies to develop
and reﬁne techniques of compaction
to obtain the densities desired.

In light of greatly increased road and
street construction, in which high-
grade materials are being used in
abundance, the conservation of ag-
gregates has become a pressing re-
quirement. A study of the use of As-
phalt in membrane form to" envelop
low—quality base courses and soils
would be helpful. Other procedure-s
utilizing Asphalt also could be studied.

Degree Programs In
Computer Science

College degrees are not always the
same year after year. Degree programs
have expanded to include new ﬁelds as
they develop such as aeronautical engi-
neering and biophysics. The availability
of curriculum in a particular ﬁeld is
one major consideration for the student
planning to attend college. or to study
for an advanced degree. One ﬁeld is
developing rapidly and is of major in-
terest to an increasing number -of stu-
dents, yet relatively few schools offer a
degree program in it. This is the ﬁeld
of computer science.

Twenty-ﬁve years ago, the ﬁeld of
computer science was relatively un-
known. But since then, great progress
has been made. Today, computers are
used for almost anything: to schedule
students and compute grades, to do
research projects, to bill customers and
keep track of‘ supplies, to translate from
one language to another, and even to
ﬁnd a student’s ideal date.

These applications are but a handful
of the uses of computers. Colleges,
realizing that there is an increasing de-
mand for computer programmers and
operators, are offering computer science
courses, but not necessarily a degree
program. At the University of Pitts-
burgh, a whole series of courses come
under the heading of computer science.
At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a
student can take a number of computer
courses. Also, if he is able to program,
he may use the computer for homework
assignments and term projects in other
courses. Both schools are contemplating
computer science degree programs; at
Rensselaer it could come within the
next couple of years. At Pittsburgh,
where both a bachelor’s and a master’s
program is possible, the proposed target
date is still unknown.

Colleges such as Carnegie Institute of
Technology, Purdue University, Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, University of
North Carolina, University of Michi-
gan, and University of California are
offering computer science degree pro-
grams or degree programs in similar
ﬁelds. Some of these colleges, however,
are offering the program only at the
doctorate level and not at the master’s
or bachelor’s level. Other schools are
probably facing the decision of whether
or not they should institute such a
program.

Many people, students and professors
alike, feel that such a program would
be of value to students. True, if a stu-
dent obtains a job as a programmer,
the company will probably train him.
But, will the company teach him how
to operate or ﬁx a computer as well as
how to program the computer? Also,
will he learn the language of the par-
ticular computer which the company
has or will he learn other languages,
especially those which are compatible
with many computers? These are some
of the things a program in computer
science should teach.

computer languages plus the machine
language for the computer at his college
and the assembly language for that
computer plus several other common
computers.

Some people feel that the computer
science department should be a separate
one, but that it should be made up of
people from electrical engineering,
mathematics, and computer science.
Those from electrical engineering
would teach logical design, those from
mathematics would teach numerical
methods, ﬁnite state machines, and
mathematical methods, and those from

PiH"s Compufer Room

George MacDonald, a junior chemi-
cal engineer major at Rensselaer, who
is also a grogrammer and who is in-
terested in pursuing a career in com-
puter science following his graduation,
has developed a possible curriculum for
a bachelor’s program in computer
science.

MacDonald stresses that some of the
science electives should be in computer
building and repairing.

This proposed curriculum is attempt-
ing to teach the student the various

computer science would teach program-
ming and machine oriented techniques.

Such a program will leave the stu-
dent with a well-rounded background
in the computer science ﬁeld, but it may
also leave him with a narrow education,
aimed toward the current generation of
machnies and applications.

This disadvantage, however, may be
remedied by means of a strongly elec-
tive curriculum, one which gives the
students a minor area of competence in
addition to the computer science work.

This area should be one of interest and
general value to the student, hopefully
the area in which he hopes to make his
computer oriented contribution.

The program must be ﬂexible. It must

include introductions to everything
from hardware and logical design
through to software design (compilers
and assemblers). It must not emphasize
unduly any aspect of computation
which is technology limited, so that the
student will be able to adapt readily to
new machines and programming.

Students are not the only people in-

Elliott I. Organick, professor of com-
puting sciences at the University of
Houston feels that “graduate work in
computer science is especially valuable
to those who wish to direct computing
centers or to teach at colleges and uni-
versities in the computer areas.”

of the MAD (Michigan Algorithm

it may be possible in some schools to
take the relevant courses while being

Many people, professors and students
alike, feel that the area of computer
science should be given more emphasis
in the different colleges and universi-
ties. Courses and degree programs of
this type are needed if today’s students
are to be well—prepared for the new
careers and opportunities now opening

They not only provide mechanical and thermal protec-
tion, but also increase visual transmission beyond the
theoretical 92 per cent to 99 per cent. Ask, too, about the
high-speed glass memories that help guide Gemini to in-
space rendezvous and re-entry.

And ask about the glass resistors, as thick as telephone
poles, which serve as dummy loads and power dissipating
terminations at tracking stations.

Glass can be designed to maintain constant electrical

Plastic forms are used more and more
in concrete structures because they are

economical and make possible the con—

struction of modern architectural
designs.

Plastic forms were first used in place
of conventional wood or steel forms for
their durability and the smooth ﬁnish
of the resulting concrete. More recently
plastic forms are used to produce
modern architectural designs, which
would not be economically feasible, if
made with wooden forms. Plastic forms
will inexpensively produce a large num-
ber of different shapes and curves in
future architecture for precast and
cast—in—place concrete structures.

Advantages and Limiiaﬁons

Plastic forms are used to save money.
Plastic forms can usually be reused
more than wooden forms. Wooden
boxes lined with plastics are used in
moulding concrete shapes such as slabs
or posts. Since the plastic surface is so
smooth, concrete rarely sticks to the
sides of such boxes. This means that
boxes can be used for a great many
moulding operations, and replacement
of boxes is virtually eliminated.

The plastic forms do not dentas steel
forms do, and if they crack, they can
be repaired. Plastic forms are light in
weight. They can be moved as a unit.
For these reasons handling of such
forms both on the job and during ship-
ment save time and money. Frequently
plastic shells replace steel forms. Plastic
forms usually weigh less than half as
much as the steel ones and hence, ship-
ment cost is considerably decreased.

Because concrete does not stick to
plastic, forms can be stripped without
completely dismembering them and can
be moved to a new location intact. This
eliminates much time wasted in form
construction. Their light weight in
comparison with wood and steel forms,
decreases the time spent in form setting
and stripping.

Probably the biggest advantage in the
use of plastic forms in concrete con-
struction is the very smooth ﬁnish of
the resulting concrete. This saves the
time and cost of rubbing and patching.
In the construction of the columns, the
concrete surface was, completely free
from the usual irregularities left by un-
lined wood shuttering.

Since plastic is not porous, moisture
does not evaporate from the mix and
this enables the concrete to cure more
effectively. When cured, the concrete
is a light grey colour approaching
white, and for certain applications this
means cheaper types of cement can be
used in place of the more expensive
white cements.

Use of plastic forms is limited to
cases where the forms will have re-
peated use. It is not economical to
design and hand cast a plastic form
which would be used only once, but in
high buildings where each floor has the
same design, or for columns, or precast
members, the advantages are apparent.

Several new buildings have demon-
strated that plastic forms for concrete
construction will help make the new
designs of modern architecture a reality.

 

in modern architecture
seems to be smooth curves and sharp
designs. The dramatic new designs and
innovations reflected in modern build-
ings have forced contractors to come up
with correspondingly novel construction
methods.

The trend

One of the designs which seems to
be catching on is the hyperbolic para-
boloid, which is given by the mathe-
matical expression: xz/a2 + yz/b2 =
z?/c2. To made mathematical curves
such as these from wood or steel would
be expensive. Plastic has solved the
problem. With the use of plastic
forms, modern architecture will only be
as limited as the imaginations of the
architects and engineers.

Washingion Plaza Aparfmenis

T—shaped plastic forms were used in
the construction of Pittsburgh’s Wash—
ington Plaza Apartments. The build-
ing is twenty—three ﬂoors high. Each
floor required 660 cubic yards of con-
crete. The building cost $7 million
and is 219 ft. high, 302 ft. long and
219 ft. wide: The apartment ﬂoors are
concrete slabs which rest on two rows
of concrete columns and a pair of longi-
tudinal concrete walls.

Though the columns and end walls
meet structural needs, the architects
also wanted them to serve an architec-
tural purpose. Indentations were made
in the stem of the T, which forms the
separation between windows. The bar
of the T is the form for the spandrels.
Enough T—shaped forms were made for
one floor and each form was reused

twenty—two times. The end walls had
to meet the same architectural concrete
requirements as the columns. Since the
surface area for these end walls was
large, plywood forms coated with
plastic were used. All forms were
reinforced with steel.

The desired smooth ﬁnish of the
apartments was made possible with the
use of plastic forms. The contractor
obtained, a ﬁnished face on the con—
crete that is precise as it emerges from
the forms and needs no further dressing

by hand.

The plastic forms made possible the
fast concreting of the building. Two
floors of the apartment were placed
every seven days. It took only one day
to set the forms for an entire ﬂoor! Con-
sidering the dimensions of the building
this is a very short time. Each form
was lined with a transit and bolted to
the one next to it. The forms were
handled as other concrete forms except
that a little more care was used to
preserve the unmarred surface.

Hyperbolic Paraboloid Buildings

Three recently constructed buildings
having hyperbolic paraboloid shapes
used plastic forms. Two have trees or

umbrellas whose trunks are columns
and whose branches from the concrete
roof. The other, a gasoline station in
Midland, Michigan, has a concrete shell
roof supported by four piers located at
the center of each side.

Plastic forms were used to make the
concrete surface of thirty—six concrete
trees rooﬁng the $600,000 Olivet Col-
legiate Center in Olivet, Michigan. This
is a one story building. The umbrellas
or trees which are 20 ft sq. are con-
nected along their edges by upside
down channels that project about two
feet above the roof and house ﬂoures—
cent lights and air—conditioning ducts.
Only one form consisting of four sym-
metrical quarter sections of an um-
brella was made and it was used
eighteen times. High early strength
cement was used and thus one tree was
cast every twenty—four hours. Because
of many form reuses, the company got

the ﬁne ﬁnish demanded by the archi-
tect for the exposed concrete surface at
a cost of $1.35 per sq. ft.

Similar umbrellas were made at the
State University of New York complex
at Albany. The plastic forms produced
a smooth rock—like surface. Two dif-
ferent contractors solved the problem
of holding the forms in place by two
different ways.

One contractor had his forms
mounted on scaffolding frames with
screw jack legs which could be lowered
or raised. Thus the assembly was

wheeled into position. The wheels were
removed and legs raised. The concrete
was placed in the forms. When the
concrete hardened, the legs were lowered
and the wheels replaced. The entire
assembly could be wheeled to the next
bay for casting.

The other contractor had the forms
assembled on scaﬁolding. Then when
the concrete cured, the forms were sup-
ported by cables projecting through
sleeves cast in the shell. The cables
held the forms while workmen removed
the scaffolding. The forms were lowered
to the ﬂoor and taken to the next bay.

The gasoline station has a three inch
thick hyperbolic paraboloid shell roof.
The forms were polystyrene planks.
The planks were warped between two
layers of prestressed wired to form the
doubly curved surface. To build a
wooden frame would have cost three
times as much. It would have also re-
sulted in a thicker shell, calling for
costlier substructures.

In the floor construction of a ﬁve
building residence hall at Pennsylvania
State University plastic concrete pour-
ing pans have replaced steel pans. The
result was a savings in initial cost, re-
duction in stripping time and a very

smooth ﬁnish that did away with costly
ﬁnishing prior to painting. Six thou-
sand pans were brought costing $35,520.
The steel pans would have cost $42,000
to rent. Pans that were estimated good
for seven pours were used up to twenty-
ﬁve times. Since the pans were lighter,
shipping cost was less and handling on
the job was easier. The use of plastic
pans resulted in a large savings for the
contractor.

The development of modern archi-
tecture may rely very heavily on the
increasing use of plastic forms in con-
crete construction. These forms in-
creased economy for conventional con-
crete construction and will make
economically possible the construction
ofnew buildings with more imaginative
designs. They provide unusually smooth
concrete surfaces and, because of their
light weight, they are cheaper and
easier to handle both on the job and in
shipment. Because of the nature of
plastic, smooth curved—surfaced forms
can be easily made. These examples
are evidence that modern architecture
with its compound curves and com-
plexly bent surfaces is going to rely
heavily on the continued use of plastic
forms.

Live television from the moon will
be broadcast by a camera similar to the
above prototype during the first manned
Apollo lunar exploration mission. The
camera, called the Apollo lunar tele-
vision camera, is being developed under
a contract from the National Aeronau-
tics and Space Administration by the
Aerospace Division of the Westing-
house Defense and Space Center.

During the moon exploration mis-
sion, the compact camera will produce
television pictures that will be relayed
to earth and processed and distributed
by the Apollo ground system to the
World’s television networks. The quality
of the television pictures produced by
the system will be virtually as good as
those usually seen on home television
receivers.

What's New

 

In Engineering

The essentials of portability, and con-
sequently light weight and compactness,
and reliability dictated certain design
constraints. These were: low power
requirement, limited bandwidth, sim-
plicity of operation and a 35-year mean-
time—between-failures (MBTF) require-
ment. Other requirements were based
on the design environmental conditions,
such as 250 degrees F ambient lunar
temperature; 10-14 mm of mercury
pressure; micrometeoroid and radiation
bombardment.

The heart of the camera is the sec-
ondary electron conduction (SEC) im-
age sensor. This type of tube was
invented and developed by the West-
inghouse Laboratories. It has the wide
dynamic range needed to obtain good
pictures at the very low light levels of
earthshine during lunar night.

At 400,000 feet, 1000 seconds from
home, astronauts enter the severest,
most dangerous lap of their journey, the
passage through the heat barrier. The
module will roar back to the Earth’s
atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour.
It will be exposed to metal-melting
temperatures for 16 minutes.

Their protection is a phenolic epoxy
resin ablative material bonded to the
outer skin of the module. Composed
of resins, ﬁbers and ﬁllers, it looks like

a pile of reddish black clippings when
in its raw state.

The heat shield, with its stainless
steel honeycomb construction, can en-
dure up to 600 degrees F without
imperiling the comfortable 70-80 degree
temperature in the inner crew com-
partment. But the primary heat shield
must be protected, for 600 degrees is
only a taste of the space inferno. In
certain areas, the boundry layer of

gases churn up to 20,000 degrees F.

A compact and unusual-looking in-
strument, the Automatic Reporting
Telephone will be on duty mainly at
unattended and remote industrial and
business locations. It will deliver re-
ports automatically when certain con-
ditions exist.

ART could monitor conditions at un-
attended stations and could report
undesirable conditions — such as the
overloading of a power station’s trans-
formers to manned control centers miles
away.

The set isn’t confined to the oil or
power industry. Its only limitation is
the sensing or detection mechanism
which triggers it into action. For ex-
ample, ART may be used to report
pressure changes to water companies
and temperatures to large-scale refrigera-
tion ﬁrms. Or, it could be set to call
the police when unauthorized persons
enter a building after hours.

Fairly simple in operation, the set
uses a regular telephone line. During
installation, a message — up to 13 sec-
onds long — is narrated onto tape and
the control center number is positioned
on the dial. After a test, the set is in
working order, and stays on duty 24
hours a day.

At: the receiving end of the line,
either a Touch—Tone® telephone or a
pushbar handset enables the control cen-
ter to acknowledge the message.

The large radio telescope recently
completed at‘ the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank,
West Virginia, is one of the most stable
and precise in the world. It has to be,
to meet its requirements of highly
accuraet determination of the positions
of radio sources out in space and track-
ing of objects with great accuracy over
long periods of time. A major factor
in providing this accuracy and stability
for the telescope’s projected long service
life is a l67—ton polished steel bearing.

The 2600 tons of steel and aluminum
in the 140—foot dish and its supporting
components are pivoted on this spheri-
cal bearing, which was machined and
polished at the Westinghouse East
Pittsburgh plant. A ﬁlm of oil 0.005
inch thick separates the bearing com-
ponents to permit precise positioning of
the dish without sticking.

Your career
at Boeing began

It started, in fact, the day you
decided to become an engineer or
scientist. Along the way, you’ve
developed and learned many of the
things you’ll need to accomplish
the challenging assignments await-
ing you at Boeing.

Why Boeing? Boeing is one of the
nation’s leaders in aerospace. A
substantial backlog of ﬁrm con-
tracts and orders—more than $3
billion as of December 31, 1965-
assures a high degree of career
stability. Boeing activities range
from commercial jetliners and
helicopters through military pro-
grams to space ﬂight contracts,
offering a broadly diversiﬁed spec-
trum of long-term assignments. It’s
a good combination. Initiative and
ability can get you to the top fast.

This year Boeing celebrates its 50th
Anniversary. From a small shop

‘I8

years ago

in 1916, it has expanded into an
aggressive, eminently successful
and still growing organization,
with sales over $2 billion in 1965.
The power behind this remarkable
growth has been a forward-striding
attitude, an orientation toward the
future which, over the years, has
produced a steady succession
of pioneering, years-ahead
achievements.

It’s a propitious moment, perhaps,
to consider a Boeing career. For
further information about career
opportunities, write directly to:

NASA TECH BRIEF

 

The Pfeblelnt To reduce the canopy-
opening shock of a parachute to a level
that protects the wearer from injury.
Various devices that cohtrol canopy
opening behavior either do not protect

against line stretch shock or add signiﬁ-

cant bulk and complexity to the

parachute pack.

The solufion: A nylon shock absorber

is mounted on each of the four risers

between the shroud lines and the
harness.

How ii"s done: An 8-inch shock ab-

sorber is mounted by stitching it to the

17-inch long riser between the shroud
line clevis and the riser confluence with
suﬂicient slack introduced in the riser
to permit stretching of the shock ab-
sorber fabric when the parachute can-
opy opens. Opening shock loads are

converted to large elastic strains at a

relatively low level in the shock

absorbers instead of small elastic strains
at a high load level in the parachute
risers.

Notes:

1. Because of their size and location,
the shock absorbers pose no problem
in repacking the chute and harness
after a jump.

The problem: To design a transducer
system using a noncontacting pickup to
measure the outputtorque of a rotating

shaft.

The solu'l'ion: Use a specially designed
sleeve of magnetically permeable mate-
rial that fits snugly over a small section
of the shaft and deflects axially in direct
proportion to the output of the rotating
shaft. Stationary inductance pickup
coils mounted in close proximity to,
but not in contact with, the sleeve
undergo a corresponding change in
reluctance, which is measured by con-
ventional circuitry connected to the
pickup coils.

How i"|"s done: A small section of the
shaft is reduced in diameter in order to
ensure a relatively large torsional de-
flection between the two end‘ portions
of the shaft when torque is applied.
The sleeve of magnetically permeable
material is symmetrically positioned
over the reduced section and secured by
a shrink fit to the ends of the full—dia-
meter shaft adjacent to the reduced sec-
tion. The sleeve incorporates three
integral rings, one at each end and one
at the midsection. Two circumferential

bands of equidistant holes are radially
drilled through each portion of the
sleeve between the central ring and the
end rings. The holes in each pair of
bands are connected by slots cut at an
angle of 45° with respect to the shaft
axis. Theislots in one portion of the
reduced section are at 90? to the_slots
in the other portion. The sueeve con-
structed in this manner has a much
smaller torsional stiffness than the shaft.

When torque is applied to the shaft_

as indicated by T-T, the end rings will
deflect in an axial direction, as indicated
by M Z . Since for small» deﬂections,
M, = M; =/‘fhaxial deflection of the
center ring, M1 , will be equal to M]

+M3 /2 (i.e., one-half the total tor-
sional deflection at mean sleeve radius).
This axial deflection may be measured
(while the shaft is rotating) by a vari-
able reluctance circuit which incorpo-
rates four inductance coils (only one
pair is illustrated) wound on laminated
cores.  pair of coil assemblies is posi-
tioned between the rings to form small
air gaps, G, , G2 , G3 , and G . As the
centerring moves axially, the gap width
G increases or decreases relative to

G , thus correspondingly increasing or

.W’V’A“J’,-

decreasing the reluctance of one coil
relative to that of the other. Since the
end rings are not deflected axially, G,
and G /,4’ remain constant and do not
affect the reluctance of the coils. When
the two pairs of coils are connected in
an ac Wheatstone bridge circuit, the
output signal amplitude will be pro-
portional to the deflection or shaft
torque.

Nofes:

1. This transducer system operates
equally well at all shaft speeds and
therefore may be calibrated statically.

2, Since no electrical or frictional con-
tact is made with the rotating shaft,
the system would be especially use-
ful for measuring torque at high
rotational speeds.

3. The eﬁect of slight axial or radial
movement of the coil assemblies is
cancelled by the symmetrical design
of the system.

The P|‘0bl.el'n:‘ In many test programs,
an oscillograph printout‘ of test per-
formance is required for analysis. Be-
cause‘ the service life of oscillograph
lamps is unpredictable, many tests are
interrupted or nulliﬁed by lamp fail-
ures. The expense of such failures can
be appreciable where sophisticated and
complex procedures are involved.

The soluﬁon: A lamp with a primary
and a secondary ﬁlament with means
for automatic switching to the second-
ary ﬁlament at primary ﬁlament
burnout.

I-low i‘|"s done: The lamp is made
with two ﬁlaments supported between
three posts._ The primary ﬁlament con-
nects the common post with a spring-
loaded primary post. The secondary
ﬁlament is mounted between the com-
mpn post and ﬁxed secondary post. An
zwzerritle is provided externally to permit
manual switching from primary to
secondary element.

With the external switch as shown,

current flows through the common post,
the primary ﬁlament, the spring-loaded
primary post, and the switch. The
primary ﬁlament is on and the second-
ary ﬁlament is oPf. If the primary ﬁla-
ment burns out, the spring lodaed
primary post automatically makes con-
tact with the secondary post and current
flows through the common post, the
secondary ﬁlament, the secondary post
to its contact, the primary post, and the
switch. The primary ﬁlament is off and
the secondary ﬁlament is on.

Should automatic switching fail, the
override is switched to its opposite
position and current flows through the
common post, the secondary ﬁlament,
the secondary post, and the switch. The
primary ﬁlament is off and the second-
ary ﬁlament is on.

No'|'es:

1. This development is in the concep-
tual stage only and as of the date of
this publication neither a model nor
a prototype has been constructed.

The problem: To provide an electrical
signal whose magnitude is proportional
to the trigonometric sine of a given
angle 0, plus or minus a ﬁxed phase
angle 0, when 0 is linearly proportional
to the magnitude of an input electrical
signal. Prior methods have used rotat—
ing electromechanical components
whose dynamic accuracy is limited by
the slow response time of servo controls.

The soluﬁon: A circuit that samples
the magnitude of a sine wave at a
point in its period determined by the
magnitude of the input signal.

How H"s done: The output of a square
Wave generator is ﬁltered in order to
recover the fundamental, which is a
"sine Wave of the same frequency as the
square wave. Simultaneously, the square
Wave is used to synchronize a sawtooth
sweep generator. The synchronized
sweep signal is one input to a voltage
comparator that also receives a voltage

which is linearly proportional to O. At
a point in time when the value of O is
equal to the magnitude of the sweep
voltage, the output of the voltage com-
parator drives the impulse generator,
which in turn opens an electronic gate
for a short interval. The sine wave
obtained from the ﬁlter is phase shifted
through a predetermined angle 0 by
the phase shifter and this signal is
passed through the gate when the im-
pulse generator signal is applied. Thus
an impulse whose magnitude is propor-
tional to sin (0 + 0) is applied to the
sample hold. This sample is the output
voltage, e0=K sin (0 + 0), which is
maintained until the next sample is
taken. The synchronism control deter-
mines the frequency of sampling, which
is designed for the anticipate maximum
rate of change of the input 0, and may
be as great as the fundamental fre-
quency of the square wave. The greater
the sampling rate, the more accurately
the output will represent K sin (0 + 0)
as O varies with time.

Noies:

1. The advantages of this innovation

are summarized as follows:

a. There are no moving parts, and
consequently no mechanical
wear, no backlash, and no
dynamic lags as a result of

friction and inertia.

b. A considerable savings is realized
in size, weight, and reliability
over the corresponding character-

istics of a mechanical system.

c. The static accuracy is not limited
by the resolution (number of
turns) of a nonlinear potenti-

O1’1'lCtC1'.

d. The accuracy does not depend on
the length of the interval over
which it is desired to generate
the function.

TFIUST THIS EIVISIGNIA

 

Ten years ago we were making only a handful of relatively simple
semiconductor devices for a limited number of applications.
Today, with highly advanced and exotic processes, we are pro-
ducing hundreds of different and sophisticated semiconductors
—for thousands of applications. Our technicians can now control
material composition down to the molecules with precise regu-
lation of impurity levels—and on a daily production line basis.

This we call PERFORMANCE.

Five years ago we produced semiconductor packages the size of
a pencil eraser that replaced the big glass vacuum tubes in your
radio. Today we're making sophisticated semiconductors that per-
form giant-sized tasks—yet fit on a soupspoon like grains of rice.

We call this MINIATURIZATION.

Drop the old time vacuum tube and it would smash. Its parts
wore out pretty regularly too. Shake it or shock it beyond rela-
tively modest limits and you were in trouble. Now you can launch
a space vehicle with thousands of semiconductor components to
go all the way to the moon and back . . . and make it go back
around all over again. And a couple of times more after that.

That's RELIABILITY.

Shake ’em, shock ’em, squeeze ’em or freeze ’em.-—today’s elec-
tronic devices have got to be able to take it . . . and perform.
Motorola makes them as though they're a matter of life or death.

Sometimes they are.

What kind of engineer will you be...

preliminary design, design, development?
At AiResearch Phoenix, you work as all three

before you decide.

Yaur future as an engineer is
strongly influenced by your ﬁrst
assignment. What that assign-
ment will be, should be, is an
important decision.

At Garrett you control that
decision. During an eight-month
orientation program, you work
with experienced engineers on a
variety of assignments in different
areas. Your permanent assignment
depends on your own aptitude
and interest.

In preliminary design you may
work on gas turbine engines, jet
engine starters, or advanced power
systems for space vehicles. Analy-
sis is the key—and the emphasis
is on thermodynamics, fluids,
vibration, heat transfer, and math
to solve today’s problems.

As a design engineer, you see
your solution to a product design
problem take shape on‘the draw-
ing board and in fabrication. You

   

may work on controls systems for
turbine drives, engine fuel sys-
tems, or a laboratory test system.
Mechanics is the theme—statics
and dynamics, materials and pro-
cesses, and graphics are your tools.

In development, you'll test
designs before they go into pro-
duction. Manufacturing processes
are examined and production
techniques are explored. Every-
thing from nuts and bolts to com-
plete power systems are tested,
and your lab work and practical
judgement will pay off in this area.

Your career at AiResearch
Phoenix can be stimulating and

rewarding. You can work in all
three important areas of engineer-
ing on diverse aerospace products.
You can use your total education,
learn more on top of it, and take
part in a wide variety of advanced
engineering.

At AiResearch Phoenix, the
product lines include gas turbines
for auxiliary power, turboprop
engines for business and military
aircraft, secondary power equip-
ment for aircraft, advanced space
vehicle nuclear power systems,
pneumatic and hydraulic control
systems, as well as a variety of
related equipment for aerospace,
ground, and undersea applications.

slips of the stick

The legend is told that in the days of
ancient Rome an oﬂicer, called away to
the wars, locked his beautiful young
wife in armor and gave the key to his
best friend, with the admonition: “If I
don’t return in six months, use this key.
To you, my dear friend, I entrust it.”
Ten miles away from home, he saw a
cloud of dust approaching and waited.
His friend, on horseback, galloped up
saying: “You gave me the wrong key.”

A small boy stood gazing at a horse and
wagon while the mllkman delivered
milk.

When he came out the boy observed,
“Mister, that horse will never get you
home.”

“And pray tell, why not?”

The small boy explained, “He just lost
all his gasoline.”

At a county fair a strong man squeezed
a lemon dry and then offered a prize to
anyone who could get another drop
from it. Many tried but the lemon
appeared dry. Finally a little man said
he could squeeze some more juice from
the lemon. Amid laughter the Her-
culer proffered the lemon to the little
man who squeezed a jet of juice.
“Extraordinary!” the muscle man ex-
claimed in admiration.

“Not at all,” the little man replied,
shrugging his shoulders “You see, I
work for the Bureau of Internal
Revenue.”

A castaway from a wrecked ship was
captured by cannibals. Each day his
arm was cut by a dagger and the natives
would drink his blood. Finally he
called the king. “You can kill me and
eat me if you want,” he said, “but I’m
tired of being stuck for the drinks.”

Prof: “Well, what did you think of the
course?”

C.E.: “I thought it was very well
covered. Everything that wasn’t covered
during the semester ‘was covered on the

ﬁnal,”

The essence of humor is com;

A Texas oil man was visiting New "I

York. His city friend showed him all
the sights including the Empire State
Building.

“Isn’t that a magniﬁcent structure?”

asked his friend.

“Nothin’,”said the Texan. “I got an‘

outhouse bigger’n that.”

The New Yorker looked him over.
“You need it!” he retorted.

Then there’s the story of the man with

The inebriated university professor
staggered into the bar and asked the
bartender for a dry martinus.

“Beg you pardon, sir,” the bartender
replied, “but do you mean a martini?”

“Now see here, my good man,” ex-

two, I’ll ask for them.”

The young kindergarten teacher had
just instructed her charges to come for-
ward as their names were called and be
prepared to draw something on the
blackboard that had been the cause of
excitement in their homes during the
previous week. One by one the pupils
came forward and sketched such items
as report cards, television sets, mothers’
new hats, and the like.

When it came time for Johnny, the
class cutup, to comply with the assign-
ment, however, he walked to the board
and simply made two white chalk dots

p"Suspecting that he was up to one of his
‘usual pranks, the teacher advised

 Johnny that he had better be able to
 explain why those two dots were ex-
I‘ citing if he didn’t want to be kept after

school.

“Well,” said Johnny, “the other day

\ you told us that those dots are also

\.“That’s correct, the teacher interrupted.
“But what could possibly be exciting

, about two periods?”

“Beats me,” replied Johnny, “But that’s
how many my sister in high school says
she’s missed, and they’re causing an
awful lot of excitement around our
house!”

Then there was the M.E. who thought

Then there is the story of what one

Scene: A ﬁeld hospital in Viet Nam.
A correspondent is talking to a soldier
bandaged from head to foot. the cor-
respondent eager for the gruesome de-
tails asked for the soldier’s story.

“It’s a long story,” said the soldier.
“When I first got here I was told how
to recognize friend from foe. I was told
when I came upon a man to yell ‘Ho
Chi Minh is a rat!’ and if he smiles,
he’s a friend and if he gets angry he’s
a foe, and I was to shoot him.

Well, I was here for about six months
and then as I was walking along this
jungle road, I saw a man. With my
gun at the ready, I yelled, ‘Ho Chi
Minh is a rat.’ But he did not smile or
get angry. Instead, he cupped his hands
and yelled ‘Lyndon Johnson is a ﬁnk.’

And as we were shaking hands in
the middle of the road, a truck ran
over me.”

An entrant in a long distance swim-
ming contest in the English Channel

“Drift-along” careers? We don’t have them.

You won’t ﬁnd the environment at Sikorsky Aircraft
conducive to inertia. We earned our reputation as a pioneer
and leader in our dynamic, young industry by applying a
lot of mental muscle to a bewildering array of problems.
And being willing to buck the current in order to go places
is an essential engineering attitude with us today.

Are you this kind of young engineer? Willing to wrestle
with new ideas, hard work? Then you should certainly talk
to us about the opportunities for personal progress and
rewarding professional satisfaction offered in our world of
advanced VTOL systems.

The Sikorsky vehicle of today reflects a startling new tech-
nology . . . the merging of sophisticated electronic systems
with the VTOL airframe to provide new dimensions in
airborne capabilities. These advanced VTOL systems are
fulﬁlling the broadest demands on their versatility . . . from
space capsule recovery to wide-ranging military and com-

mercial application. As for the future—it’s bounded only
by the span of engineering imagination.

THE RIGHT SPOT FOR YOU? We’ll have it. You’ll be
given tough, responsible assignments within one of our
small, interdependent groups—working on demanding prob-
lems in such areas as aerodynamics o human factors engi-
neering o automatic controls o structures engineering o weight
prediction o systems analysis 0 operations research o relia-
bility/maintainability engineering o autonavigation systems
o computer technology . . . among others.

And your career potential can be increased materially by our
corporation-ﬁnanced Graduate Education Program . . .
available in many outstanding colleges within the area.

Please consult your College Placement Ofﬁce for campus
interview dates—or—for further information, write to
Mr. Leo J. Shalvoy, Engineering Personnel.

Suggestion to Ch.E.s, M.E.s, and other engineers:

The University of Rochester has long com—‘

mitted itself to the pursuit of academic excel-
lence and long ago attained success in that
quest. Likewise, with a somewhat different
conception of higher education, has the Roch-
ester Institute of Technology earned high re-
gard. The two institutions are quite unrelated
to each other or to us, except that their for-
tunate presence in Rochester provides oppor-
tunity for those who join us with fresh bac-
calaureates to proceed right on course with the
next formal stage of professional or business
preparation. In Kingsport arrangements are
offered by the University of Tennessee Gradu-
ate School and East Tennessee State University.

Ask us about the details of our incentive plans for post—bacca1aureate education.
Eastman Kodak Company, Business and Technical Personnel Department,

Rochester, N.Y. 14650.

Two big factors make such plans attractive:

1. Money. It can be a great comfort when supplied regularly by a
prosperous ﬁrm well aware that its fate depends on the intelligence
and devotion of the people it can lure into its fold.

2. Direct personal involvement in the realities. The realities en-
countered in a company that leans as heavily as we do on engineer-
ing, science, and scholarship can be nothing but helpful to one
whose motivation toward education is genuine and deep.

T/Iere is also a rough side:

You have to drive yourself pretty hard when you work and study
at the same time. This shows you up as a candidate for tough
assignments. ‘
