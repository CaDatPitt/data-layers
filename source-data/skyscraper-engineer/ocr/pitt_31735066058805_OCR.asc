Typical printed wiring board consists of copper
(only 0.0028 inch thick) laminated to a phenolic-
resin panel. With the new process. unwanted metal
is etched away with cupric chloride.

Automatic regeneration and plating machine has a heavy,
rubber-lined tank with 22 stationary graphite anodes and
57 rod-like copper cathodes moving at the rate of 90
transfers an hour.

Creating an entirely new way to etch printed circuits.

 

One of the most common methods

of printed circuit manufacturing is by
batch-etching with ferric chloride. How-
ever, while batch—etching produces cir-
cuits of high quality, it also has some
processing disadvantages.

For instance, it takes more and more

etching time as the etchant is used.Then,
to replace the spent etchant means con-
siderable downtime. And the etching of
100,000 circuit boards produces 2000
pounds of copper in a non—recoverable
form.

is needed. Etchant strength does not di-
minish. The etching rate is now constant
and faster than the average ferric chloride
rate. There’s no more waste of etched
copper. It is now recovered, about 20
pounds per hour, and resold.

Conclusion: The ﬁrst completely
closed-loop cupric chloride etching sys-
tem in the printed circuit industry is a
major innovation that has improved effi-
ciency and quality, eliminated downtime
and decreased costs by more than 90%.
Furthermore, it has helped conserve a
valuable natural resource.

plant set out to discover a better way to
etch that would eliminate all of these in-
herent problems.

Their new process is the ﬁrst closed-
loop, spray-etching system that electro-
lytically reverses the chemical reaction
of etching. It continuously recycles cu-
pric chloride and has reduced the cost of
etching wiring boards by over 90%.

Virtually all the problems of the old
method have been overcome. No more
machine downtime is required to change
etchant. No more costly ferric chloride

Help Wanted —
Steelmaking

We’re planning to talk with a lot of candidates
for employment in Steel Plant Operations dur-
ing the next few months. Students working
toward M.E., Met. E., E.E., or several other
engineering or technical degrees should give
serious thought to careers in steelmaking
through the Bethlehem Steel Loop Course.
And remember, we're a leader in steelmaking
teohnology—our capital investments total
$980 million for the last three years alone!

A word to the wise—COAL

According to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, our
nation’s consumption of bituminous coal will
double by the year 2000. That fact alone sug-
gests something about career opportunities
in the coal operations of our Mining Depart-
ment. We’re looking for mining, electrical,
and mechanical engineers.

Steel’s magnetic “personality”

Iron and steel are magnetic. So, what’s the
big deal? Just this: ferrous wastes are the
easiest materials to recycle. Magnetic extrac-
tion separates ferrous scrap from trash, re-
covers metal after waste incineration, even
permits “mining” of dumps. About 50% of
all new steel is made from iron and steel scrap.

speaks
out!

 

Well, here we are in a brand new term, starting
off with a clean slate, and the Skyscraper is right
where you would expect it to be: two weeks behind.
How we manage to put this magazine together in
time to meet our ad deadlines is just one of those un-
solvable mysteries. Now, for those of you who are
taking the time to read this, the entire matter might
be one of complete indifference. But give us a few
minutes of your time as we attempt to explain and
justify a few things.

Two years ago, prior to Dick Beswick’s term as
editor, the Skyscraper was more or less in a state of
deterioration. The bulk of the magazine consisted of
news briefs (issued regularly by NASA), an occasion-
al article submitted by a faculty member, two pages
of secondhand bathroom jokes, and a waste of good
film and layout space known as the “Technicutie.”
The office was cluttered with leftover copies after
each issue; a pretty poor testimonial to a publication
which is distributed free of charge. At this time both
editor and business manager were awarded full tui-
tion scholarships for their services, doubtful though
they were. No effort was made to train new staff
members. This oversight cost the magazine a few
hundred dollars when the old staff walked out and
left their advertisers hanging.

Dick was determined to make something out of
the Skyscraper. He did away with the jokes and the
Technicutie feature, much to the consternation of
students and faculty alike. With the help of Dave
Syskowski, he enlisted photographers Felix Sciulli
and Dan ‘Fuzzy’ Laughman. When Bob Bretz walked
in to compalin about the removal of the Techni-
cutie, he ended up staying as staff artist, and there-
after more attention was paid to the overall appear-
ance of the magazine.

But photography and artwork alone don’t make
the publication good; graphics merely serve to pack-
age the journalistic efforts. Creative writing was
called for, and the staff was resolved to never again
rely on news briefs to fill space.

Controversial articles (Thompson Steel Works,
Infant Mortality, Engineering Unemployment, etc.)
touched off a landslide of letters to the editor, the
first in years. Most of the student body was still upset

at the removal of the joke page, and Dick’s editorials
brought charges of poor journalism, among other
things. Then came more serious problems. Engineer-
ing cabinet threatened to cancel its school-wide sub-
scription. Some students, not realizing that the pub-
lication was an independent organization, wanted
the administration to step in and ‘put things right’.

We had one positive sign of encouragement:
there were no longer any leftover copies piled up in
the closet. Like it or not, everyone was reading the
Skyscraper again. In the meantime the magazine
began receiving congratulations and awards from
other journalistic organizations both on and off cam-
pus, culminating in a first place in national collegiate
competition. The entire staff was invited to join Pi
Delta Epsilon.

Not everything we did deserved praise. Quite
often the work load and lack of personnel made it
impossible to completely research an article prior to
publication. But the editorial staff was willing to
stick its neck out (a badly scarred neck) to generate
thoughtful response. Sound advice, whether it came
from the Dean or the Director of Student Publica-
tions, was often ignored. Frequently short deadlines
resulted in sloppy layout work. We could be satisfied
with one thing only:_ the fact that we were doing our
best.

The amount of work involved in the magazine
forced Dick and Dave to resign from their positions
in order that they might devote more time to their
academic pursuits. These two were responsible for
the new trends in the magazine, particularly for en-
couraging creative expression in the engineering stu-
dent. And the Skyscraper’s first female member,
Joan Fitzpatrick, happened to be Dick’s spouse.
Dick, by the way, is still a happy man.

Our new editor is Lynda Zakrzewski. She really
knows her stuff, and the staff is confident that she
will turn out one of the best publications on campus.
Whatever her motivation, she does not receive fin-
ancial aid due to her work on Skyscraper as past
editors did. Her reward for working like a dog will be
verbal abuse from just about everyone, staff in-
cluded. Margaret Szvetecz makes her debut as a fea-
ture writer in this issue, along with shutterbugs Carl
Deutsch and Larry Zambotti. Jeff Pasek takes Dave’s
place as businss manager, and he already has his
hands full. As of this writing we have no printer and
no money.

So keep an eye on us this year. If we do some-
thing you like, let us know. If we do something you
don’t like, or feel you can improve upon, then please
speak up. And if you are thinking of joining the staff,
we sure can use the help. Oh, and by the way — we
may tease them about it, but there is nothing wrong
with having Lynda and Margaret with us. The only
problem is that nobody knows how to pronounce
their last names.

Perhaps one of the most despised words in the
everyday vocabulary of the academic world is the
word “exam.” Idealistically, testing is defined as a
method of evaluating a student’s progress. Far too
often, however, tests fail in this task and serve only
to frustrate and discourage students.

In many respects an exam is a very complex
creation — an avenue of expression for an in-
structor. A valid test should be challenging, but not
unreasonable, and should be aimed at stressing
understanding rather than memorization habits.

Unfortunately, far too few tests meet these
criteria. The “open book” exam is just one instance
of a type of test which has great potential for ex-
amining, not memorization techniques, but in-depth
understanding of the subject matter of a course. In
most cases, however, these exams are designed to be
of such difficulty that the majority of the class is
completely confused. Perhaps instructors feel that
they must complicate the problems in order to
compensate for the fact that the students may use
their books for assistance. As a result, however,
pupils are incapable of recognizing the crux of the
problem as presented, and are forced to flounder
helplessly, unable to apply any principles they may
have learned.

Another type of test to be dreaded is that com-
posed of what students disgustedly term “multiple
guess” questions. Frequently tests of this type consist
of possible choices so ambiguous that they defy the
reader to disqualify any of the suggested answers.

Many times the potency of a test’s impressions
on the students are overlooked. A carefully formu-
lated test can challenge the student, reveal his areas
of understanding and confusion, and spur him on to
further study. On the other hand, however, a test
based upon unrealistic expectations of the class’s
abilities can stifle interest in the course and instill
futility in the atmosphere of the classroom. There is
a vast difference between a problem requiring a little
extra thought and a solid understanding of funda-
mentals, and a question which is beyond the general
level of comprehension of the class.

By far the most unfortunate consequence of un-
reasonably difficult exams, however, is that the stu-
dent has no firm idea of his standing in reference to
the other members of his class. Averages are usually
extremely low and thus traditional grade levels have
little or no meaning. Frequently, letter grades are
calculated on the basis of cumulative points earned
for all tests given throughout the term, and profes-
sors establish cutoff points only after all the results of
finals have been averaged into individual totals. Thus
the student can at no time during the term pinpoint
his level of achievement. This uncertainty can inhibit

J enthusiasm and dampen incentive.

It is indeed unfortunate that in so few instances

exams are utilized as an aid in the teaching pro-

A m<.<t/ .r--~.. , fession, rather than as a stumbling block. Perhaps if a

m“““W° ""“'W"' ‘  sense of pride and creativity could be nurtured in the

attitudes of instructors and students alike this

dilemma could be resolved, and the learning process
enhanced.

     
  

  

Editorial:

___ _ 13.5 Lgnda Zakrzewski

The following is a letter submitted to Sky-

Engineering and Development at Westinghouse. It is
a reply to Dick Beswick’s editorial, “The Skybus
Caper” published in our February ’72 issue.

 
 
   
     
     
   
   
   
     
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
     
   

  

Dear Mr. Beswick:

As an alumnus of the University I read with interest your editorial in the February, 1972, issue of the Sky-
scraper Engineer. I certainly respect your right to editorial opinion. However, in line with the engineering
career you have chosen, I do wish you would investigate the facts before promulgating such a broad description
of a project on which you are obviously not well informed. '

We have many engineers at Westinghouse. We try to train our engineers to secure all the facts from all
sides of an issue before proceeding. This includes facts we don’t like as well as facts that we do like. Applied to
your editorial, for example, did you make any effort to determine what the Westinghouse facts are concerning
the contract we were hired to carry out and mentioned in your second paragraph?

In order to help you secure some additional data to clarify your editorial, I offer the following items which
we believe to be facts.

In your second paragraph you mentioned that Westinghouse was hired to select the system. This contract
was in no way involved in the selection of a transit system for Pittsburgh. Our specific task was to determine if
the Transit Expressway system would fit in the right of way to the South Hills. The contract clearly calls for this
task and the report covers only this work. Westinghouse was against taking this study because it would be mis-
interpreted; however, we agreed to this project as a service to the community.

Also in your second paragraph regarding rejection of Transit Expressway, please be advised that only four
cities have made a comprehensive study of the Transit Expressway system. They are Baltimore, Miami, San
Juan and Honolulu. Three of those cities have approved it and are proceeding. Only Baltimore decided on con-
ventional rail after the consultant engineer selected and recommended Transit Expressway. Their reason was
to be compatible with the Washington, D.C., system which was already under construction and which they will
join. ‘

Regarding your statement of “unbiased engineering analysis” made frequently throughout your editorial. I
am not sure you know the function of the consultant engineer in industry and in public works. Parsons,
Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas are fine consultant engineers. However, these consultants do not have
development laboratories or research departments for new systems. Consequently, this firm or any other con-
sultant would not recommend for or against an innovative system such as Transit Expressway. They only re-
commend what has been built before and where such a system has been operating for at least five years. New
technology is decided upon by a transit authority, and through government (Urban Mass Transportation
Administration). I’m sure you are aware that engineering analysis on Transit Expressway has been accom-
plished by a number of independent engineering firms, primarily highway engineers for roadway, aerospace
engineers for electronics, and by the Department of Transportation in Washington, D.C. (UMTA). In addition,
Westinghouse has had outside firms audit its safety analysis. Battelle Institute, at our request, made an inde-
pendent study of the safety of the system. Battelle has been employed by many transit authorities across the
country for this purpose.

There were several other points made in your article which indicate you do not have accurate information.
Apparently you have the impression that each car must operate singly as do your elevators on campus. This just
is not true. Trains on the South Hills line will operate with six-car units during rush hour and Transit Express-
way can readily be operated with ten-car trains. In normal rush hour service each train to South Hills will carry
at least 400 people, not 27. While trains could be scheduled every 30 seconds, we believe moving 400 people
every two minutes will be more than ample for any line in Pittsburgh for many years to come.

We have no doubt that the unmanned Transit Expressway system will be much safer than any manned sys-
tem. We have good engineering data obtained by many competent engineers, over a ten year period, to support
this position. Being locked to the track is one feature alone that will save many lives. And there are others you
apparently are not aware of in this Transit Expressway System.

If you would like to pick up your engineering responsibility to look at all the facts relative to Transit
Expressway, I woul be most pleased to have someone contact you and make a presentation to you and your en-
gineering associates. Also, it is my hope that you will print this letter so that your readers at least get a chance
to understand some of the facts as they are.

Sincerely,

$1..) I./vs,\,—.,I/(./'

EDUCATION FOR AN ENGINEERING FUTURE

ﬁ
H. E. Hoelscher

The accelerating pace of technological change
in all nations and the growing emphasis on in-
dustrialization in those slowly emerging from eco-
nomic chaos are both real and important phenomena
of our time. One consequence of both is that the
engineering profession will have an increasingly im-
portant, increasingly visible and much broader role
to play in all future world societies — or none. As
that profession concerned principally with the use of
knowledge to deal with (to “solve” if you will) the
constantly changing problems of the real world with-
in which we function, it represents one of man’s old-
est professional interests. But there will now be
many new demands on and new responsibilities as-
signed to the engineering profession plus new de-
grees of accountability to be considered. The present
cry that engineers demonstrate more concern for the
socio-economic impact of their technologies is only
one manifestation of this trend.

For engineering educators, these new demands
will require that we prepare our students in new ways
to meet the challenges of the future.

Since engineering is concerned with the use of
knowledge and experience to solve problems in the
real world of man or of his society, the profession
changes continuously as the societies of man change.
Both the demands on the profession and the profes-
sion itself must, therefore, continue to change as
man’s societies experience further transformation.

Unlike the engineer of the 1970’s, early engi-
neers were largely “loners” holding sole respons-
ibility for massive projects. In Egypt a single engi-
neer supervised pyramid construction. Similarly, one
engineer supervised construction of the aqueducts of
Rome. Even in more recent times, an engineer
directed construction of each railroad thrust from
the developed east into the western reaches of the
United States.

Today, any project of similar magnitude
requires large teams of engineering professionals and
sub-professionals working together with respons-
ibility divided and accountability often vested in
some management group physically far removed
from the project site. Communications and transpor-
tation technology make this possible. Success occurs
only when all efforts are properly meshed.

Two other changes have occurred. In the past,
cost was of little importance to the engineer. His
clients or his sponsors were usually the king,
pharoah, emperor or local ruler. Early in this cen-
tury, however, cost consciousness became the pri-
mary element for engineers to consider. Effective-
ness was often measured in economic terms. Today
we find a marked return to earlier times in which
many massive and important projects must, because
of their very nature, be sponsored by government,
usually with a large infusion of federal funds. Urban
redevelopment, highway programs, urban waste dis-
posal and sewage systems, pollution control pro-
grams, and space and ocean exploration and de-
velopment are all examples of activities in which the
engineer is less involved with cost accounting than
with effectiveness, safety and result.

Finally, empiricism dominated the early history
of the engineer. His education derived largely from
experience and from an apprenticeship to a prac-
ticing master. The apprentice was instructed to do as
his master did. He learned new things, if at all,
through the observation of results and through
courageous but small deviations from traditional
techniques and methods. “Schools” of engineering
became necessary only as the need for engineering
talent in a developing world outraced the ability of
the apprenticeship system, with its one-to-one
teacher-pupil ratio, to provide sufficient numbers.

-Early engineering education programs in the
universities of the United States — those at West
Point, Rensselaer, the University of Pittsburgh and
others — codified empiricism for easier and more
effective presentation to students. Through the
1930’s. programs were largely based on “rules of
thumb,” empiricism and recorded experiences.
These were presented to the students for study and
emulation. This pattern seems to have been charac-
teristic of early engineering education throughout
the world.

Following World War II, most engineering
schools in the United States adopted programs that
emphasized engineering science. This development
has been well documented. In a sense, this was an
over-reaction to the experience of the engineering
profession during the war when engineers en-
countered problems that required sophisticated sci-
ence and mathematics for their solution on new and
ultra-short time scales and were, somewhat, less than
fully prepared for the new demands.

Today there seems to be two discernible paths
available to the profession. There is, firstly, the four-
year bachelor’s degree program in technology, an
emphasis on the use of results from science, engi-
neering science and mathematics to maintain and
carry forward the existing technologies of our
nation. Secondly, of equal challenge, there is the
program which emphasizes the process of design, the
development and analysis of models, a concern with
systems and with the dynamic analysis of those sys-
tems. Advances in science and mathematics, the
computer and a growing understanding of the sys-
tems which make up our world have combined to
give a viability and importance to this kind of inter-
est and emphasis.

Both branches, paths, to the engineering profes-
sion present the educator with the challenge to
produce a new breed of engineers who can assess
and deal with the societal implications of the tech-
nologies for which they are responsible before those
results effect an undesirable transformation of so-
ciety. The technologies of our world, results from
past engineering efforts, have transformed man from
actor in his environment to its director. It has given
him added options, new freedoms. It has also now
presented him with a new challenge . . . the chal-
lenge to use technology more effectively for people.
Suitable competence for tomorrow’s engineers must
begin in University programs educating engineers for
the future. A major question then concerns how can
this best be done.

10

Programs for the path which emphasizes the
existing technologies of our nation and our world
now require development. These will need to be
considered carefully; there is no precedent. They
represent a new but certain challenge to the profes-
sion. They are clearly, at present, a challenge in the
undergraduate bachelor’s-degree program, but they
may, of necessity, become programs at the master
and doctoral levels of study. Their graduates will be
the technologists of our world — a name which can
and must carry prestige, stature and status equal to
that of engineer.

For those who follow the second stem, those to
be concerned with the design, development or sys-
tems interests of engineering, I suggest that spe-
cialization must be deferred as long as possible, first
to the later years of bachelor degree programs and
perhaps, eventually, to the master’s and doctorate
levels; such undergraduate programs must provide a
basic education for those who wish to function as
engineers in the broadest possible, non-specialized
sense.

These undergraduate engineering programs
must concentrate increasingly on those pervasive
characteristics that distinguish engineers from scien-
tists at the expense of subjects traditional to the
specialized, departmentally focused offerings in
schools today.

These thoughts have several implications for
program development in engineering schools. We
cannot accomplish what is needed in either of the
two emerging stems of engineering by add-on types
of changes. Something much more drastic is
required. There must be new kinds of programs at
the undergraduate level. Elimination of specialized
courses in the lower division and de-emphasis of
such courses in the upper division seems a necessary
first-step. There seems a reasonable call for an
emphasis on computer-based modeling, design, de-
velopment and evaluative activities, all unique to
engineering, in terms that permit anticipation of
human needs for the next three decades. The under-
graduate engineer of the future must have an even
better understanding of the systems nature of the
real world and must be able to cope with problems in
systems terms.

‘H

We must begin to coalesce fragmented material
now offered in several courses; these may, obviously,
be reinforced by special problem sessions where
necessary. The principles of thermodynaimics, fluid
and solid mechanics, statics and dynamics, heat and
mass transfer are the same for chemical, mechanical
and every other kind of engineering; only the spe-
cific problems vary.

Next, and much more importantly, we must find
new and better ways of teaching principles —
engineering principles — to large numbers of our
students.

There is a body of law, logic and principle which
provides the foundations for the sciences (Newton’s
Laws, Helmholtz’s equations, the Arrhenius equa-
tions are examples). Is there not also a body of
separate rational logic which governs the activities of
engineers? Are there “Principles of Engineering?”

I believe that such a foundation structure for
our profession does exist, independent of the various
engineering sub-specialties, but I know of no effort,
thus far, to identify and articulate such “Laws of
Engineering.” By way of example, I offer two state-
ments which just might be engineering principles in
these terms:

1. Given a problem situation and the ability to
conceive of an idealized solution for each of
the facets of the problem when each is con-
sidered independently of the others, the
engineer must always choose a final solution
which is less than totally ideal for any single
facet;

2. Within a given competitive environment, the
bases for competition between two com-
petitors will always be fixed for one by the
other competitor.

11

The first statement says that a solution will al-
ways, deliberately and knowingly, represent varying
degrees of what would be the ideal approach to solv-
ing a problem; perfection in any one part is just not
possible. Scientists require that, for a given problem,
the solution must be represented by a single point in
the problem coordinate system. In fact, the problem
will usually be altered so that this is the case. In engi-
neering, alternate solutions will often be acceptable
and the final choice among them may well revolve
about factors which are related to, but not part of,
the problem.

The second statement, limited in this form to a
binarily competitive situation, may be expanded to
indicate the multiple interacting nature of any com-
petitive situation among any number of competitors.

The identification, development, analysis and
classroom presentation of such principles would
substantially aid the education of young engineers.

Identification of the problem structure of engi-
neering is also needed. Most of our graduate work
seems directed toward problems which fall out of or
are rejected by the sciences. Is there not a problem
structure which is basic to our profession and com-
mon to all its sub-specialties? If so, should these
problems not be at least one focus for our attention
and concern?

I can suggest four kinds of problems:

1. A basic problem — Example: Define a per-
formance ratio — the ratio to time of the
amount of information which can be intro-
duced into a system, used by the system or
taken from the system; the ratio is a quantity
(of information) per time which is either the
input (the consumed) or the output informa-
tion from the system. It seems possible that
these three, on the average, must be equal in
any system operating at steady state and that
there must be something like a law of
conservation of information.

I suggest that a basic problem arises from
the need to maximize this performance
ratio. Note that the word “system” permits
inclusion of any machine, man or man-
machine system operating in the real world;

2. A fundamental problem — Example: To
devise a technology-based rationale for the
allocation of priorities in the attack and
solution of engineering problem situations;

3. An applied or pragmatic problem — Ex-
ample: To decrease the time span between
the moment new information becomes
known or available to the engineer and the
time it is useful to him in a problem situa-
tion; to increase the rate of flow of new in-
formation from discovery into end use;

4. An applied problem — Example: To define
the dynamics of our technology-based and
technology-driven economic, political and
social systems well enough to permit assess-
ment of the impact of technological change
on those systems with some degree of confi-
dence.

The above are only four of what must be a
lengthy list of engineering problems which can or
should be met by engineers. They are based on the
fundamental premise that engineers are people who
take ideas, facts and understandings from science
and use these judiciously in their need to solve, or at
least ameliorate, the problems of an increasingly
complex society.

Engineers of our future must be equipped to
meet the complex systems problems of tomorrow’s
world. They will need to know not only how to de-
sign and build an atomic power plant, an airplane or
a bridge, but also how to cope with the ancillary
problems of increased power availability and wealth,
sonic booms and changing land-use patterns. They
will need to understand the interrelationships of
technical and technological activities and institu-
tions with economic, political and social institutions.
They must be able to anticipate the impact of each
upon the other in a developing, changing world of
ever increasing complexities. They must provide
more than managerial abilities. They must provide
leadership. We must provide them with the founda-
tion from which to do so!

"ABOUT
SCIENCE FICTION"

  
 

by

Margarei & Mary Szveiecz

Many people read a type of literature (or story-
writing) dealing with the various bizarre or seemingly
possible futures of mankind, and various equally
bizarre or possible interpretations of the past and
present. These stories are peopled with garrulous or
insidious monsters, benefactors, mystics, prophets,
and strange beings (of which sometimes man is con-
sidered the strangest). Other people malign these
stories as examples of pointless obscurity and bad
writing —— these objections are sometimes valid. A
certain amount of discrimination must be used in
reading science fiction, and even then it is kind to
say that for some writers, literary style is of secon-
dary importance.

It is difficult to come up with an exact definition
of science fiction even though it is an easily recog-
nizable genre. Miriam Allen de Ford thinks there is a

difference between science fiction and fantasy. She
says “. . . science fiction deals with improbable pos-
sibilities, fantasy with plausible impossibilities.” This
is a rather arbitrary idea since traditionally science
fiction includes a certain kind of fantasy. Stories
seemingly on the borderline between science fiction
and fantasy are usually classified as science fiction,
regardless of the exact content of the story, if the
author is an acknowledged writer of science fiction.
In fact, the distinction between science fiction and

fantasy is not necessarily obvious or important.

Perhaps the most popular idea about science
fiction is that it consists of “trashy” adventures and
scientifically plausible stories prophesying the
future. This definition overlooks one fact — science
fiction never discusses “reality.” Each author con-
structs (or tries to construct) his own world, using
concepts borrowed and expanded from his own cul-
ture. The ships which can travel faster than the speed
of light are based on some popular notions of physics
and present day space capsules. The alien beings

from another planet are based on the tenuous crea-
tures of myth, dream, and self-projection. The con-
cept of the robot is a strange combination of the idea
of the machine and that of the alien. The world en-
compassing city is based on projections and the
history of the spread of urban life.

The point is that no story is a prophecy of the
future, not even one written in pseudo-technical
terms bearing logical relation to present day termin-
ology. Various writers use various devices to trick
the reader into accepting and sympathizing with
their creations. Now, of course, this is the idea be-
hind all literature, but with science fiction it’s theo-
retically more difficult for the writer to gain this kind
of acceptance from the reader. The basic idea of
writing science fiction is to compose believable
stories about conditions which are furtively admitted
by both writer and reader to have never existed at
any place or time, and which probably never will
exist (although some commentators disagree with
this analysis).

Of course, that sounds confusing, but science
fiction is confusing — it is not a specifically defined
medium. Some authors focus on an unfavorable ele-

ment of modern life by emphasizing this element in a
projected future and making this future as unpleas-
ant as possible. Some write to emphasize a strange
psychological factor by creating a world in which it
can be very obvious or important. All write to enter-
tain but some do this more blatantly than others, i.e.
“clever stories.” Many authors write to preach or
prophesy doom; it is an interesting fact that much of
today’s science fiction is very gloomy. Also, it is pos-
sible to find more well written short stories than well
written novels since science fiction deals more with
concepts than with characters.

Science fiction is best analyzed by discussing the
stories themselves; perhaps by even a description or
an interpretation of these selected examples a reader
can visualize what makes a story science fiction
rather than “mainstream” literature. The first ex-
ample is of that type commonly known as scientific-
ally plausible — the scientific or scientific-adventure
story.

The best science fiction written in the 1940’s and
1950’s utilized a style emphasizing scientific plaus-
ibility. This is not to say they were straight pro-
phecies of the future —— however, there is an often
favorable emphasis on developing technology and
most of the stories have a recognizable cheerfulness
which is practically a jaunty “zest.” (This is particu-
larly noticeable in contrast with the more depressing
alienation stories so prevalent in the 1960’s.)

“Nightfall,” written by Isaac Asimov and first
published in 1941, deals mostly with a theme (the
forte of the short story) rather than with characters.
The theme is basically that men unaccustomed to
darkness and stars would go mad if suddenly con-
fronted with them. The story takes place on a planet
illuminated by six suns so positioned that no part of
the planet is ever in total darkness. From certain
astronomical observations a group of scientists theo-
rize that at the time when only one sun, Beta, is il-
luminting the planet an unusual occurrence will take
place — another planet, usually invisible in the glare,
will eclipse Beta and put their planet in total darkness
— an occurence they calculate happens once every
2,000 years. This is further confirmed by the vague
data of a mystical cult which claims that every so
often the planet goes into a cave and the stars come
out and drive men mad, leaving only the chosen ones
saved and sane. The scientists also note that there
are records of nine past cultures totally destroyed at
stages of development comparable to that of their
culture. They have made preparations for a few
people to escape this unthinkable and maddening
darkness in a haven equipped with torches and
strong walls. The rest of the people will supposedly
go on a rampage of burning in order to try to escape
the claustrophobic terror of total darkness; this
frenzy is the force which destroyed those nine past
civilizations.

The reader is given a rundown on the situation
because a formerly unconvinced reporter comes
around and the situation has to be explained to him.
It is a clever story, told quite lightheartedly in spite
of the fact that almost everyone goes mad in the end.
As a further touch one of the main characters is
found marveling in his insanity at the fantastic num-
ber of stars visible when darkness finally comes — he
had formerly considered them hallucinations of dis-
ordered minds.

This type of story thrives on interesting techno-
logical details. A good writer does not usually
blatantly describe his world all of the time. There are
sections of straight narrative; the rest of the
necessary details he sneaks in — it takes some skill of
organization but the best stories have a certain
amount of cleverness. Some stories of this type are
thought-provoking but none are extensively intro-
spective.

16

The short story was the traditional style of good
science fiction writing, particularly because there
was a market for short stories in the science fiction
magazines and partially because of the difficulty of
writing good novels (i.e. the necessity of creating
interesting themes, settings, and characters). In the
1960’s the publication of short story anthologies and
novels in paperback form became more widespread.
However, in the 1950’s there were some reputed
(only in the field of course) science fiction novels
written, and at least one example should be dis-
cussed.

The Caves of Steel, a novel written by Asimov
and first published in 1953, is interesting because it
manages to strike a middle ground between the
classic optimistic-adventure story and the de-
pression-doom stories of the 60’s. It deals relatively
plausibly with certain “technological” concepts —
the closed-in city megapolis surviving mostly on
yeast-grown artificial proteins, the literal minded
robot with something of a personality, the moving
sidewalk strips for transportation. The robot itself is
one of the more unusual devices in that it is not a
monster, nor does it have genuine human feelings in
a moment of crisis, even though it is human in
appearance. Because of its basically literal mind
(even though it is very adaptable to new circum-
stances) it sometimes seems to have a subtle sense of
humor, but this is an illusion of writing. The novel is
unusual because it succeeds in maintaining an inter-
esting plot (a detective story, no less), a cogent back-
ground and sympathetic characters.

The concept of an intelligent or non-intelligent
life form not native to earth — an alien — is central
in the popular mystique of science fiction. However,
very few good “alien” stories are actually written,
probably because they are so difficult to write. The
writer can err either in giving the alien or its society
implausible human characteristics in order to make
it a sympathetic figure, or the writer can create an
alien so unusual as to be gimmicky, which also
makes the story unbelievable.

All ludgnient Fled, the novel written by James
White and published in 1969, deals more specifically
with the first contact of man and aliens, but it does
treat the aliens it creates plausibly. The basic theme
is that when man is faced with a novel and dangerous
situation he does not always behave heroically;
sometimes he reacts violently — hence the title, All
Judgment Fled.

.71

The situation is this — a strange extra-solar ship
suddenly appears 60 million miles from earth. Six
men are sent to investigate in two small ships re-
sembling space capsules (The technology resembles
that of our present day society.) The journey takes
several months and in that time the men are “posi-
tively rather than negatively bored” by lectures
(from Prometheus Control) supposed to prepare
them for anything and which are occasionally “so
theoretical as to be almost science fiction.” The mili-
tary and the diplomats are nervously anxious for the
success of the project — so much so that the lectures
often contain the implied request to “please not do
anything stupid.” The main characters are intelligent
but sometimes confused in the face of the frightening
situations — when they react violently to what is
later found to be the attack of unintelligent lab‘ ani-
mals which have escaped and reverted to bestiality
they are blamed and threatened by the ground con-
trol, which is typically much more concerned with
public opinion than with the fate or the men them-
selves. The depiction of the alien ship is plausible
and the characters are all quite believable. Toward
the end of the novel the intelligent alien is briefly
sketched — in appearance it is a sort of many-eyed
furry caterpillar and is prone toward living in half
submerged cities on a planet subject to high winds.

The story is credible partially because the ship
and the situations themselves lack perfection. The
men are confused and the alien ship is in a state of
malfunction due to the escape and subsequent over-
breeding of a species of lab animal. It is not a hope-
less story of the total incompetence of human rea-
soning — the most stable man survives and his cau-
tious and humane logic prevails. However, it is not
blatantly an unrealistically optimistic novel; neither
the men nor the intelligent alien behave like gods. In
its accurate depiction of human beings as both im-
perfect and admirable, All Judgment Fled is almost
unique in the science fiction world; most alien
stories are just not that good in depicting human
beings.

Not all science fiction stories are oriented to a
world of science. There are some stories in which the
usual jargon of science and technology is distorted
or used for a different end than in the more scientific
type story. In stories of this nature it is perfectly
plausible for a non-rationalistic, even ridiculous
world to be created with the use of technology. Ubik,
written by Philip K. Dick, and first published in 1969
is a good example of this.

17

Ubik is a gimmicky novel with a lot of fantastic
technological inventions, such as moratoriums
where people who have almost died and have only
residual brain activity are kept alive in cold storage,
and revived to talk to their relatives. It creates a
world where such “half-lifers” live in an alternate
universe of their own, which has regressed to the
l930’s. All kinds of other gimmicks and gadgets
abound — apartment doors that demand a nickel to
let the occupant out, and coffee machines that get
nasty to people without change. The novel is cram-
med with such conventional science fiction things as
telepaths and precognitives, space ships and some
form of time reversal; it is also full of adventure and
activity. On this level it could be called a pro-tech-
nology novel, except for the difference in outlook.
Dick does not care whether the created world is
useful or rational. Technology is seen as being some-
what perverse, as when a door refuses to accept a
credit card or a coffee machine mutters “we can do
without your kind.” The novel abounds with catchy,
commercialized advertising for a product (Ubik)
which can solve all problems (cure colds, stop dand-
ruff, freshen breath) and, incidentally, keep the main
characters alive. At the conclusion, there is a mock-
scientific paragraph describing what Ubik actually is
(utilizing such terms as “anti-protophasons” and
“negative ions”), but Dick does not seem to be par-
ticularly interested in what he is describing. The
conclusion is, of course, non-rational. Throughout
the novel Dick plays with technology, treating it as
an intricate joke. His final world is one of illogic,
commercialism, and humor.

At least Ubik is not depressing — there is still
enough of the fast paced adventure story in it to
make it fairly light reading. This is not always the
case. The other type of anti-technology story is
invariably depressing. In this type of story, science is
seen as the destroyer, and technology as a tool for
the destruction of man. Most of the stories were
written in the 1960’s and 70’s (as opposed to the 50’s
and 40’s scientific story) and the writing is less
scientific (or pseudo-scientific) and often more
literary. “Windsong”, written by Kate Wilhelm and
first published in 1968, is a classic example of such a
story. The writing is less highly plotted, more per-
sonal, and less adventure oriented. Even the main
character (a scientist) is apprehensive about the new
technological device — a machine for fighting wars
with completely automated equipment — a device of
such complexity that it requires a human brain to
operate it. The story also contains the main
character’s flashbacks about a sensitive young poet-
ess, and one is led to assume that only minds as
clever and flexible as hers can operate the war-mak-
ing machine. The story, though vague, is not terribly
subtle, and technology is seen as an inhuman force
unable to be controlled — the ultimate destroyer.
This pessimistic outlook on technology is a fairly

common theme in 60’s writing, and this idea of tech-
nology as an ultimate enemy is often presented as the
main factor in the alienation of man from his world.

Another parallel development in science ﬁction
is the popularization of the fantasy element. There
have been writers who contended that a distinct and
ﬁnal difference between fantasy and science ﬁction
exists, but in later years (the 60’s and 70’s) this dis-
tinction is difﬁcult to uphold; very little of the old
adventure style scientiﬁc science fiction is written
today — many of the stories are not even pseudo-
scientiﬁc. The only distinction that can be made be-
tween the fantasy-oriented stories and the more
scientiﬁc type stories is some difference in jargon.
“Gonna -Roll the Bones”, written by Fritz Leiber and
first published in 1967 can represent the fantastic
element in science ﬁction. Although it does make
use of some space and space ﬂight terms it is really a
“tall tale” about a man who gambles with the devil. It
is clever, and written in a style that suggests that the
story is the type to be handed down over a long per-
iod of time. It is important to note that, in spite of his
writing style, the author, Fritz Leiber, is still con-
sidered a science ﬁction writer. Categorization of
science ﬁction is not quite as rigid as it used to be.

The fantasy element is important, but not all
that prominent in science ﬁction. Probably the most
common type of science ﬁction story written today is
the type that is classiﬁed in this article as “depressing
alienation stories”. These stories are similar to the
anti—technology stories of the 60’s and 70’s. They are
often more experimental in writing style than tech-
nological science ﬁction (though not always better)
and, as mentioned before, invariably depressing.
They are usually vague, and many of the better ones
are understated and non—dramatic. These are the
type of stories that one can read in a science ﬁction
anthology and then doubt their science ﬁction
authenticity. They are often set in the present day or
in the near future, and many of them never make use
of such science ﬁction concepts as aliens, time
travel, or even such a common constant as space
travel. Man himself is often considered the unknown
being, a position held by the alien in the space travel
adventure stories of the 50's.

18

Unfortunately, such stories are difﬁcult to write
about, due to their own vagueness. “The Asian
Shore”, written by Thomas Disch, and ﬁrst published
in 1970, is a good example of the alienation story. It
is a slow paced story describing the almost random
observations of an art historian researcher in
Turkey. There is an atmosphere of alienation and
depression, and only halfway through the story does
one learn the author’s theme — the totally arbitrary
nature of all society, and of all life itself. At the con-
clusion, the main character, almost without his resis-
tence, arbitrarily becomes someone else — a Turkish
speaking native of this Asian Country. The story im-
plies that the physical universe is arbitrary and
therefore meaningless, but there are no direct
sweeping generalizations. The reader is always con-
scious of the main character’s inability to understand
the arbitrariness of his own life — hence the de-
pression of the story.

Alienation stories are not always vague, but they
are always depressing. “Day at the Beach”, written
by Carol Emshwiller, and first published in 1959,
takes a dim view of life in the near future. It is an
“after the Bomb” story, a story of how a family sur-
vives in a post nuclear war society. The story, told in
a personal, but understated style, is about the
attempts of a family to cling to the human elements
of life (the enjoyment of a “day at the beach”), in a
world that is becoming increasingly savage and un-
human. The futility of their attempt is. shown by the
mutation of their three year old son (born after the
war) into a more primitive life form, and by the great
difﬁculty and danger they experience in retaining
any elements of civilized life. It is a conventional
theme, but it is treated well, with no panoramic
views of life, or technical descriptions of the future.
It is a good example of the depressing attitude pre-
valent in 60’s and 70’s science fiction.

Having discussed all the various categories of
science ﬁction it should be noted that these
classiﬁcations are purely arbitrary. Science ﬁction is
simply not that speciﬁc; there are a number of stor-
ies that are too obscure or unusual to be classiﬁed in
any of these categories. Any work of J.G. BaHard is a
good example of this. “The Voices of Time”, pub-
lished in 1960, will be discussed here since this work,
as distinguished from his later, more avant grade
works, is at least partially understandable.

The story is, in some obscure way, a science
story telling about the last few days of a neuro-
surgeon suffering from a disease similar to sleeping
sickness, and about the mutation work of his friend,
a biologist, who had already succumbed to the
disease. It is partially a technological story, with its
biological speculation on the function of “hidden
genes” that can mutate a species, but it is more dis-
oriented than is typical for a technological story. It is
not told in a direct, tightly controlled series of
events; there are sections of irrationality. It is also
not particularly cheerful — with a basic premise
being that the universe is wearing out, the story is
bound to be depressing. There are unrelated scien-
tific and non-scientific incidents that increase the
obscurity and depression — a broadcasted count-
down from a star group that is calculated to end
when the universe finally disintegrates, and a cryptic
sign that both the biologist and the neurosurgeon
feel compelled to inscribe on as large a flat area as
possible. There are more unrelated incidents, but the
alienation of Powers, the neurosurgeon, from the
rest of humanity, due to his disease, and his subse-
quent empathy with the dying universe is constant.
The story becomes progressively less and less order-
ly, until it is difficult to find any trace of the techno-
logical story it first appeared to be.

This brings one to a general conclusion about
science fiction — its obscurity. Perhaps this explains
why people actually read it (bad writing notwith-
standing). Science fiction gives the reader a certain
variety of worlds to choose from. It is fundamentally
an escape from reality — sometimes an unpleasant
escape into a more dismal future — but an escape
nevertheless. On a secondary level the writers often
try to incorporate grandiose schemes for man’s final
destiny into the medium, or more recently, devious
or blatant social comment. These elements are basic
to science fiction, but they do not supplant its funda-
mental nature of escapism. Science fiction does not
glorify science itself, not even in stories having a
positive attitude toward technology. It takes science
and uses it as fantasy to create fantastic stories; there
is something of a fake myth—1ike quality about it.
Obscure is an excellent description for it — it is a
semi-respectable writer’s medium for creating
clever, hopeful, pessimistic and entertaining legends
about a dubious past and a non-existant future.

“F MC” is the name of a highly diversified company

doing thousands of good things for society-
in fibers and films, machinery, and chemicals.

We're not as well known as many other
corporations, because we don't make household
items bearing our trademark.

We work behind the scenes.
Nevertheless, we do offer three major

areas of interest in which you can

make a significant contribution:

Fibers & films

Did you know that our American
Viscose Division started the man-
made fiber industry in the U.S.?
Probably not. Yet, we're the nation's
leading rayon producer, and our lines
of acetate and polyester fibers keep
growing.

Though our products are hard to
identify, you see them all around.

We make the cellophane that
wraps the hamburger you can buy at
the supermarket. _

Your radial tires probably run on
our tough DYNACOR"" rayon cord.
And the Avlin”? polyesters in your
suits or sports clothes help keep you
looking neat and well pressed.

We're also the discoverers of micro-
crystalline cellulose, a unique
excipient widely used in pharma-
ceuticals and special food products.

To name just a few things were
into.

If you're an engineer, chemist, or
textile major wishing to make a
name for yourself, see your place-
ment officer for an interview. Or
write for our booklet “Move Ahead
with American Viscose" to lndustrial
Relations Department, FMC Corpor-
ation, American Viscose Division,
1617 John F. Kennedy Boulevard,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.

Machinery

Many of the ways FMC is a useful
company is in the area of machinery.

You've read a lot about pollution.
FMC is active in solving pollution
problems. We build sewage treat-
ment equipment for cities, and we're
continually searching for more effec-
tive materials and new treatment
concepts in our environmental re-
search center.

We help the food problem by
making products for soil preparation
and planting. irrigating, crop spray-
ing and dusting, mechanical harvest-
ing, and food processing—and even
equipment that automatically pack-
ages fresh eggs!

We also make railroad cars, fire
engines, petroleum equipment, con-
struction machinery, barges, and
much more in our machinery divi-
sions located nationwide.

Graduates in engineering, busi-
ness, accounting, and the sciences
have a field day looking over our
many opportunities. See us at your
placement center. Or read our bro-
chure “Like It lsi’ Write to The

tial Plaza, Chicago, lllinois 60601.

 

FMC CORPORATION

Chemicals

Because FMC is one of the major
chemical manufacturers in the U.S.,
many people think we are only a
chemical company.

Understandable. We have plants
and mines throughout the country.
And our range of products is un-
usually broad—from agricultural
chemicals that help crops grow, to
organic and inorganic chemicals
which comprise many of industry's
essential “building blocks?

You'll find FMC chemicals in pulp
and paper products, cleaners and
detergents, paints and plastics, in
luggage, floor tile, and flexible
garden hose.

Our chemicals have myriad appli-
cations—everything from glassmak—
ing to textiles to swimming pool
sanitizers.

So pegging us as strictly a chemical
company is an honest mistake.

But enough of our rattling on. If
you're a chemical, mechanical, in-
dustrial, or electrical engineer, you'd
rather talk about how you can be
useful . . . within a useful company.
Here's how to begin. Write FMC Cor-
poration, Chemical Group, lndustrial

You'd be surprised at all the things we do.

We are an equal opportunity employer.

Throughout the years science ﬁction has been a
rather controversial subject, scorned by some as
“trashy” literature, while being praised by others as a
valuable tool for social comment as well as a testing
ground for the beginnings of new technological
ideas.

Such inventions as radar, television, atomic
power plants, rockets, satellites and spaceships were
all described in detail years before they were actually
perfected and brought to attention. Indeed in many
ways science ﬁction has heralded and deﬁned the
electronic age, the atomic age, and the age of space.

Perhaps the best explanation for this trend is the
fact that many of the best known science fiction
writers of the 40’s and 50’ s were in fact scientists and
engineers. John W. Campbell, a nuclear physicist
from Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
assumed editorship of the journal Astounding Stor-
ies in 1937, and it was here that many writers who
later came to prominence were ﬁrst to attain
recognition —— authors like Robert A. Heinlein (a
mechanics engineer), Isaac Asimov (a biochemist),
George 0. Smith (an electrical engineer) and E.E.
Smith (a chemical engineer). All publicized their
newest theories in the pages of Campbell’s magazine.

In some ways these men used their writings as
an outlet for those ideas too much in a formulative
stage to ﬁnd a valid place in true scientiﬁc journals.
In the 1930’s, for example, both Edmund Hamilton
and Robert Heinlein wrote stories envisioning the
design and use of space suits. Later during World
War H both men were to collaborate to construct the
first actual “high altitude suit.”

“the
realm

of
speculative
fiction”

In the late l950’s and early 1960’s, however,
the trend changed to some degree. Though most
stories still maintained a certain degree of scientiﬁc
plausibility, they tended more toward sociological
trends, perhaps parallelling the fact that scientists
and engineers of this period were forced to assess the
social ramifications of their research. A revolution of
some sort resulted with the emphasis on the soft
sciences. Many of the new writers had little or no
technical background and thus sought to avoid the
label science ﬁction, and instead titled their works
speculative ﬁction. A typical story of this time would
probably dwell not upon the details and events
surrounding the invention of a new device, but
would rather explore the social implications result-
ing in the wake of the advance.

Though today many connoisseurs of speculative
ﬁction would insist that the greater majority of work
done is still the offspring of this “soft science”
rebellion, it is rather interesting to notice that of the
ﬁve novels considered for the 1971 Hugo award,
three were very technical and none of the ﬁve con-
cerned soft science so completely’ as to ignore hard

\ science. In fact the 1971 World Science Fiction Con-

vention in Boston was organized and programmed to
a large degree by scientists and technologists from
Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Indeed it
seems safe to assume that science ﬁction based upon
the hard sciences still bears a certain aura of
prophecy and adventure attractive to readers and
will never be displaced completely by purely
sociological discussions.

Regarding science fiction, it is interesting that
there is such a contrast between the pro-technology
adventure story and the relatively recent world-gone-
rotten-anti-technology story. This is a real dif-
ference, not just in jargon, but even in attitude, and
it can probably be tied in with the kind of non-
science fiction writing going on at the time and also
the mood of the country in general.

“First Contact”, written by Murray Leinster and
first published in 1945, can represent the early
“happy” science fiction. It opens with some corny
writing (Actually the writing stays that way through-
out the entire story) describing the scientific mission
of the space ship Llanvabon, that of taking scientific
measurements of the Crab Nebula. The Crab Nebula
itself is described and explained as a scientific
phenomenon of intrinsic interest not directly related
to the storyline itself. This type of scientific exposi-
tion almost never occurs in the 60’s gloom stories
and is indicative of these two different types of
science fiction.

The amount of cliches in this story is pheno-
menal; for example, Tommy Dort always speaks
“meditatively”, the skipper growls “savagely”, and
the aliens themselves have a certain “wry” humor.
These are interesting (entertaining?) because the
prevalent cliches of today’s science fiction are quite
different, as is the jargon.

Briefly, the plot is that two extra-solar vessels
(one human, one alien) come to the Crab Nebula to
take scientific measurements. The aliens are
amazingly similar to the humans in appearance and

24

psychology — except for such relatively minor varia-
tions as seeing part of the infrared spectrum and
communicating with each other by telepathy instead
of sound waves (A method which, incidentally, they
don’t even try to use on the humans.). A quite effec-
tive code is worked out for use in communicating
between the two ships. In spite of the fact that it is
the language of neither crew, it is formed rather
quickly by the use of numbers, pictures, and other
unexplained information — a somewhat character-
istic bit of optims on the part of the author. He
virtually sidesteps the truly “otherworldly” alien
problem. Aside from that aforementioned “wry
humor”, which is an extension of a human person-
ality trait, the aliens are motivated almost exactly the
same way the humans are. Each ship is afraid to
leave the area (somewhere in the Crab Nebula) since
it would reveal the location of its home planet and
leave that planet open to an attack by members of
the other planet. Each feels that the safest course is
to attempt to destroy the other ship but both crews
are too “advanced” to be too enthused about doing
this.

After about one month of these ship-to-ship
broadcasts an influential but not highranking mem-
ber of the observation crew, that “meditative”
Tommy Dort, comes up with a solution. Each group
can take the ship of the other group to return home,
after first destroying or making inaccessible the star
charts and weapons, and after having accomplished
changes in the lighting of each ship. This solution, of
course, presupposes an enormous number of things
— it presupposes that the crew of each ship can
operate each other’s controls, navigate home with-
out the concealed star charts, and recognize each
other’s weapons should a member of either crew try
to sneak one aboard. But the story blithely ignores
these objections, and ironically, the alien crew
comes up with this very same idea. The plan is
quickly implemented, and it is stated and implied by
the author that their mutual trade of artifacts will
provide some basis of mutual trust between the two
groups and will probably lead toward peaceful rela-
tionships.

The optimism of the story is its striking feature;
no problem is insurmountable and no one, not even
an alien, is essentially bad. Of course the story seems
to be meant mainly as a clever bit of writing, and it is
quite clever and entertaining in spite of the dated

cliches. However, it is extremely different from
many of the science fiction stories written today,
largely because of the writing style and the good-
natured cheerfullness.

In “A Few Last Words” written by James Sallis
and first published in 1968, the mood and style are
immediately different from that of the Leinster work.
Whereas that story begins with pseudo-scientific and
enthusiastic technical description (”isn’t-space-fun?”
type), this one begins with a quote from the poet
W.S. Merwin. Already the style is either literary or
pseudo-literary rather than happy-adventure
chronicle. There follows the strange musings and
somewhat imaginative descriptions of a man dis-
oriented by his third night of bad dreams and by the
ghostly moonlight pouring in the window. Further
reading reveals that this is not the only strangeness
— it seems that most of the people have left the cities
and towns to live in virtual isolation. It is a different
kind of end of the world or at least end of civiliza-
tion. The main character is a man named Hoover
who is worried because he and his wife are trying to
stay together for a while in spite of the inward pres-
sure each feels to go off alone.

After his nightmare Hoover sneaks out to visit
one of the few people left in the town — a man who
lives in a deserted diner. It is an eerie world; the only
other living creature he sees outside before he
reaches the diner is an abandoned dog which is al-
most immediately killed by a car speeding away from
the city. Hoover reaches the diner and finds his
friend as restless as himself. The man talks for awhile
about the nervous people who used to stop by for
coffee and leave while still drinking it; he then walks
into another room to get more coffee and just never
comes back.

The story itself has a sufficiently obvious closing
paragraph from a literary standpoint, but the situa-
tion of everyone retreating into solitude is never
really explained. Often these new stories feel com-
fortable leaving things up in the air. In this they are
unlike the old adventure stories which tried to ex-
plain as much as possible. This story is a gentle if de-
pressing work, written more in the style of the poet
than the scientist. It does not glorify the far future as
the scene of interesting adventures and scientific dis-
coveries. In fact, it shows us the very near future in a
state of collapse.

This state of hopelessness is common in the
science fiction of the 60’s and 70’s. Of course there
were depressing science fiction stories written in the
1940’s and 1950’s but they were nowhere as prevalent
as they are today. These two stories are a good con-

25

trast in their depiction of two different moods
depending on the mood of the country in general at
the time each was written. There was a basic pro-
technological progress tendency in the 1940’s and
50’s; there is now a great deal of feeling against tech-
nology and something like a fear of it.

Since a concise definition of science fiction was
never given, some people may wonder how a story
like “A Few Last Words” is classified as science fic-
tion. One way to identify a story as an example of s.f.
is to note the original source of publication and fur-
ther sources of printing. James Sallis is known as a
science fiction writer and the source of publication
of this story is one book from the reputable Orbit
anthologies. Apart from that, there is a nebulous
quality of obscurity in these vague stories. They talk
about the far or near future or someone’s unusual
experience of the present — the settings created lack
the direct mundanity of present day life. Even the
stories supposedly set in 20th century earth do not
portray it without a fictional slant; they change its
characteristics to suit the writer’s purpose, not
always with very obvious additions like telepaths and
aliens, but with additions and different emphases
nevertheless.

These two extremes in science fiction writing
are interesting to note because they give some idea
of the real variety in an often stereotyped field. Of
course some of the stereotypes are justified (reread
“First Contact”), but grade B movies on television
about the attack of the blobs or the day the ants
cavorted do not give an accurate idea of the field. It’s
not that inane, nor is it merely an escape medium
for pre-teen pro-military types. Because of the long
association between science fiction and technology
this type of article about science fiction can legi-
timately be included in the engineering magazine.
S.F. stories have also been described as mental exer-
cises (which works sometimes, doesn’t work other
times) and engineering is presumed to be a mental
exercise. This article comes to no new revelation
about science fiction; no one except fans (and not
many of them) takes it with grim seriousness. It is a
likeable genre if nothing else (some people credit it
with more) — science fiction even sells acceptably at
the Bookstore.

“America’s first college road racing team” a
This impressive phrase actually just begins to de
scribe the intricate tasks and accomplishments of the 
Pitt Road Racing Team, for behind’ this title lies the
workings of an organized student business venture.

Three years ago the team was formed under the
direction of Bob Fryer, a political science major at
Pitt. Today Bob Fryer drives the Pitt car, and has
proven himself quite competent in/_,  respect. Last
year Bob qualified second fastest in the American.
Road Race of Champions where he competed:
against some of the finest cars and professional
drivers in the country.

  

But the road racing team is much more than a
car, a driver, and a handful of mechanics. The
complex, well-run corporation run by Fryer needs
workers in race mechanics, engineering, photog-

 

   

“know-how.” Instead Bob comments that he looks
for “guys and gir ‘with the integrity to persist with
good hard work; > F pon expression of interest in the
team, applicants are evaluated- on the basis of 
“intellectual dedication and the attitude to do hard 
work perseveringly.”

Each member of the team is expected to work
fifteen hours per week in his particular area. Fryer
has designed a functional system for assigning duties
with each person listing specific tasks to be ac-
complished in a certain time slot, and afterwards
specifying exactly how much of the goal has been ac-
complished. Bob justifies the enormous pressure he
feels the members of the team experience by citing
the overwhelming sense of accomplishment which
may be attained. He speaks of personality transitions
resulting from the dispulsion of the tendency to
underrate oneself and to consider only the results of
others as impressive.

In truth members of the team have proven that
they "could formulate revisions and new designs
which could compete with those of professionals.
The Gulf Oil Company, which is a financial bene-
factor to the team, has provided its research and de-
velopment facilities for use by team members. The
Pitt racing car now implements a brake suspension
system designed to prevent rocking and deliver uni-
form power in rain which is more efficient than many
professionally sponsored systems.

29

In addition to the opportunities afforded for
application of classroom learning and the expression
of personal ambitions, team members also reap some
social and travel benefits. The entire team travels to
races during the year in places like Warren, Ohio,
and Atlanta, Georgia. They have free lodgings and
admissions to the races. There is also an apartment
adjacent to the Race Shop in Bridgeville where team
members may live free of charge.

In an overall view, the Road Racing Team is an
excellent opportunity for students interested in de-
voting some hard work toward the accomplishments
of concrete results, as well as a good avenue for
social interaction.

F RESHMEN INTER VIEWS

. . . . A RANDOM SAMPLE OF OUR NEW STUDENTS

The motivated freshman sometimes seems like a
myth, but there are at least a few concrete examples
of this type in the School of Engineering. Charles
Weigandt came to Pitt for definite reasons — he
wanted an engineering background as a foothold
into flying and Pitt is one of the few universities
which does offer Aeronautical Engineering. By the
same token,'however, he is disappointed, since the
School of Engineering does not allow specialization
for at least two years, and consequently he has to
wait some time for an Aeronautics course. He said,
“For the first few years I’m not going to be getting
even a taste of it (Aeronautics); it’s discouraging.”
Since his better aptitudes are Math and Physics he is
not too happy about talking humanities courses
which involve reading he does not find particularly
interesting. He commented, “Just personally, I don’t
like Philosophy.”

31

Charles Weigandt went to Haverford High
School in Philadelphia and applied both to Pitt and
the Air Force Academy. He’s been to a few frat par-
ties, but other social life was limited since he’s in the
usual beginning-of-the-term state of being broke
from buying books. When asked what he thought of
girls in engineering, he told the staff that he “wishes
there were a few more since that’s the first place
you’ll strike up an acquaintance.” He likes hockey
and plans to join the hockey club. He considers the
dorms livable and thought the orientation was nice
but “kind of a waste of time”, since the engineering
set-up of block schedules precludes any need for ad-

vising sessions. Another thing he liked — Benedum
Hall.

Although female engineers are an extremely
small minority at Pitt, they are such a novelty that
the staff felt it would be good journalism to interview
two of them. Mary Lisa Black is a freshman who
comes from Florida but she lived in this general area
as a child. She chose engineering because she liked
math and her guidance counselor steered her toward
engineering; so far the biomedical option appeals to
her. She did note some surprise at the experimental
nature of her Math class — it seems to be basically a
self-teach system rather than lectures. However, she
seemed fairly pleased both with Pitt and engineering.

A new student at Pitt is usually a freshman, but
not inevitably. Pat Branch is a transfer student from
Thiel in Greenville. He came to Pitt because it was
acceptable to him from a financial standpoint (he
could afford it is what he said), and because he was
impressed by the programs. He had studied Physics
at Thiel but he reasoned that as a Physics graduate
“you’re nowwhere.” He was quite disappointed that
two of his Physics courses were lost in the transfer —
supposedly at Thiel there had been an emphasis on
optics, whereas at Pitt there is a corresponding
emphasis on field and wave theory.

Being one of the few girls in engineering classes
does not seem to bother Mary Lisa, and she does not
feel stereotyped as a female engineer. On being
asked whether she liked block scheduling she com-
mented favorably on it — “It saves us the hassle of
having to figure it out.” It seemed to be practical in
view of the system of prerequisites and require-
ments.

He seemed to like the dorms —— Pat has a single
in Tower C whereas at Thiel he was in a double. He
also finds the atmosphere in the dorms friendly. He is
pleased at Pitt’s lack of social restrictions and said it
had been quite different at Thiel; girls had only been
allowed in the rooms for 2 or 3 hours. In general Pat
didn’t think he would dislike Pitt but he had one
complaint. Apparently he has already been a victim
of Pitt’s bureaucracy — the E.S. course and English
recitation for which he had signed up had simply
been scratched from the scheduling and cancelled.
However, he does not plan to cut classes and seems
generally satisfied with the university. Upon being
asked by the staff about his hobbies he showed us his
current pen and ink drawing. When asked whether
he thought engineers were stereotyped he said that
he hadn’t really thought about it. Pat was also suit-
ably impressed with Benedum Hall.

Mary Lisa likes Pitt so far, even though it does
seem large to her. She also said she liked her dorm
but that it seemed rather old, (understandable, since
she lives in Brackenridge). She is pleased with the
social life here and told the staff that she had a good
time at some frat parties. As an out-of-stater she was
a stranger when she came to Pitt and she’d still like
to get to know more people. When asked by the staff
if she liked Benedum Hall, (of course) she replied in
the affirmative.

x.‘

Not all freshman come here with specific and
unalterable career plans, but at least all the guys
interviewed had basic ideas, (which gives some
counter-examples to the theory that guys go into
engineering for want of anything better to do). Bill
Stockwell decided to go into engineering because of
a math aptitude but he also has an interest in busi-
ness — his family owns a manufacturing business. He
thinks he might select Civil Engineering or perhaps
Environmental as his specialization, if he decided
that he likes engineering in general.

Bill is an out-of-state student from Cherry Hill,
New Jersey, and he came to Pitt for various reasons.
His brother is here and he likes it; he liked the
campus and the people he met here on his pre-
liminary visits. He liked the School of Engineering;
also his parents are alumni. He said that he didn’t
mind block scheduling if the schedule worked out
well, and he also thought the dorms were acceptable
+ it seems they had been somewhat renovated since
he last saw them — Bill lives in Tower B.

Bill was pleased with the fact that there is no
curfew here, and also with the range of activities,
which he thinks is a definite advantage of a school
this size. He wasn’t totally enthralled with taking
humanitives distribution courses. Upon being asked
by the staff whether he would rather have these
courses with CAS students instead of exclusively
engineers he remarked, “I, personally, would prefer
it that way.”

He did not seem to resent girl engineers; when
asked by the staff if he felt engineers were stereo-
typed he said that he thought they were. Possibly this
is because he sees engineering as a realistic option
rather than an inflexible goal. Of course, he liked
Benedum Hall, too.

Julianne Crisante is another freshman female
engineer, and she is from Mingo Junction, Ohio. She
decided to be an engineer because of the good
career opportunities -—— she commented, “Just about
anything is open in any field.” She chose Pitt because
it was one of the places to which she could apply for
a certain scholarship. (Julianne is able to skip some
of her distribution requirements because she has al-
ready obtained about 14 credits by taking advance
placement courses in Math and English at the
college of Steubenville).

She does like certain aspects of Pitt but hates
the large classes and is not thrilled at being the
only girl in many of them. She finds block scheduling
agreeable because of the inherent confusion in trying
to pick a schedule individually. (She also happened
to get a rather good schedule herself, with only two
classes on Friday.).

When asked about her orientation she seemed
to like it, but thought the program itself and the stu-
dent leader discussions in particular were just too
long. The staff asked her if she was interested in
joining any activities (specifically Skyscraper). She
expressed a particular interest in the yearbook since
she had done work on her high school yearbook.
Julianne likes her dorm but thinks it should be
repainted — she lives in Brackenridge.

When asked by the staff if she felt stereotyped
as a girl engineer she said, “Most guys think it’s
strange.” She repeatedly gets comments like, “What
are you taking that for?!!”

And of course Julianne liked Benedum Hall. (No
one the staff interviewed disliked Benedum Hall, (it
must have been a pointless questionl).

NEWS!

During the spring and summer months when the
majority of the students had left for vacations the
halls of Benedum were anything but empty.

In April the Electrical Engineering Department,
in cooperation with the Pittsburgh chapter of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’
Computer Society, IEEE Control Systems, Man and
Cybernetics Society, and the Data Handling and
Computation Division of the Instrument Society of
America, hosted the third annual conference on
modeling and simulation.

Under the direction of conference co-chairmen
Dr. Marlin H. Mickle and Dr. William G. Vogt, both
of the electrical engineering department, this con-
ference examined the wide range of topics now being
simulated with computer models. Several hundred
experts, both foreign and American, presented talks
ranging from subjects like the health professions to
economics and transportation.

The opening address was delivered by Richard R.
Dorf, professor and chairman of the Committee on
the Extended University for the State of Ohio. The
second day’s session was opened by an address by
Professor Lofti Zadeh, a nationally renowned expert
in his field, lectured on “Simple Models for Complex
System,” explaining some of his uses of fuzzy vari-
ables.

This year the Junior Engineers’ and Scientists’
Summer Institute (JESSI) was held July 16-29 at Pitt.
The program, directed by Dr. Paul McCormick,
associate professor of electrical engineering and dir-
ector of the lower divisions engineering programs, is
designed for students entering eleventh and twelfth
grade who wish to explore topics in science and en-
gineering.

Pitt, one of the four universities who par-
ticipated in the program, housed the students on
campus in order to introduce them to the atmos-
phere of college life. The program also provided high
schoolers with information on subjects such as cur-
ricula, financial aid, research and appropriate high
school preparation for specific careers.

Instructors in the program were drawn from
members of Pitt’s natural sciences and engineering
faculties. In addition, representatives from area
industries gave guest lectures and explored career
possibilities with the students.

The class of ’76 was given a glimpse of academic
life at Pitt June 18-22 at the annual orientation cere-
monies. Activities for engineering students included
placement testing, registration, and talks from stu-
dent activities’ leaders. A Freshman Advising Office,
staffed with a group of faculty advisers, has also been
opened to provide freshmen with necessary counsel-
mg.

GALVANIZED STEEL has an

“ELECTRIC FENCE”

to keep corrosion out of your product

The layer of zinc metallurgically bonded to steel in the
galvanizing reaction is much more than just a skin deep
barrier against rust. Cl When the tough zinc coating is
scratched, gouged or worn through, an electrochemical
current fences the gaps and the zinc slowly sacrifices
itself as it continues to protect the steel. This happens
because, in the galvanic series, zinc is less noble than
steel and will corrode sacrificial|y—fighting a stubborn
delaying action against corrosion’s attack. Cl The zinc
coating is bonded so firmly and uniformly to the steel that
it is practically a part of the base metal and will with-
stand any deformation that the steel can. Galvanized
steel can be formed by virtually any metalworking opera-

tion and can be readily joined by welding or soldering.
When fabrication involves cutting or drilling, zinc’s “elec-
tric fence” provides lasting protection to the exposed
edges of the steel. El Today, galvanized steel is available
in finishes custom-tailored to suit your specific applica-
tion. D In addition, galvanized steel has the strength,
hardness and heat resistance (up to 500°F) to protect
your product's performance.

NO OTHER MATERIAL GIVES YOU THE COMBINA-
TION OF STRENGTH, CORROSION-RESISTANCE
AND ECONOMY YOU GET FROM GALVANIZED
STEEL.

Unidentical
twins.

What do you call two stereo‘
systems that have identically the same
insides, but not the same outsides? 

Well, you call one a Sylvania compact
stereo system. lt’s stacked and compact with tuner /
ampliﬁer, turntable, and tape player all in one unit. A,

“And you call the other a Sylvania component stereo system. Each unit is sepa—
rate so you can spread it around any way you want it.

Inside, though, they’re the same. Both have an RMS rating of 12.5 watts per
channel (20 watts IHF) with each channel driven into 8 ohms. There are identical
FETS, ICs, and ceramic IF ﬁlters in the AM Stereo FM tuner/ ampliﬁers. Both offer
the same switchable main and remote speaker jacks, headphone jacks, aux jacks, tape
monitor, and built—in matrix four—channel capability for the new quadrasonic sound.
The turntables are Garrard automatics with magnetic cartridges and diamond Styluses.
The 4—track stereo record/ playback cassette decks are the same. And both air»suspen—
sion speaker systems contain two 8—inch woofers and two 3-inch tweeters.

So if they’re the same, how come they’re different?

Because different people want the same great stereo sound different ways. So
we give it to them. .

Come on down to your Sylvania dealer’s for a look and a listen.

Then you can pick the shape you want as well as the sound you like. _

How cAN A SMALL PIEcE oE \X/IRE
HELP SAVE A PATIENT DURING SURGERY?

General Electric engineers
and_ medical researchers have
come up with a very interesting
piece of ’’wire.’’

It's an electrode wrapped in
a membrane that's highly per-
meable to CO2 gas. Yet tiny
enough to fit inside a needle
and be inserted into a person's
blood vessel.

That's a neat piece of engi-
neering. But that's not why it's
important.

The GE sensor permits a
new method of measuring the
pCO2 level in human blood...
one of the most important indi-
cators a doctor hasfordetermin—
ing a patient’s condition during
major surgery.

It eliminates the need for

drawing a blood sample, then
sending it to the hospital lab for
a pCO2 analysis. That can take

time. Sometimes more time than
a critically ill patient can afford.

The new GE blood gas
analyzer gives a doctor continu-
ous, instantaneous pCO2 read-
ings. Soit can warn him of
developing trouble. And give
him the time to respond.

It's a good example of how
a technological innovation can
help solve a human problem.

That's why, at General
Electric, we judge innovations
more by the impact they'll have
on people's lives than by their
sheer technical wizardry.

Maybe that's a standard you
should apply to the work you'll
be doing. Whether or not you
ever work at General Electric.

Because, as our engineers
will tell you, it's not so much
what you do that counts. It's
what it means.
