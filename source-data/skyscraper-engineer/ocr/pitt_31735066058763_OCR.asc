DESIGN OF A MODEL

   

EDITOR’S NOTE: The ram jet designed
in this article is under actual construction.
Thus far Mr. Peline has completed the brass
templates and housing stock boring for ma-
chining and housing contours on a lathe. It
is hoped that the model will be successful
and can be used as a class room demonstra-
tion on ram jet power plants. This ram en-
gine construction is partial fulfillment of a
thesis requirement for graduation with BS’
in ME degree with an Aeronautical Engine-
ering Option.

aircraft has come about though the develop-
ment of the jet engine. The jet and the propeller
operate on the same principle, namely, momen-
tum change per second of air or gases in order to
produce thrust. The chief difference between
these two types of aerial propulsion is that the
conventional propeller uses a large mass flow of
air and gives it a small increase in velocity, while
the jet engine utilizes a comparatively small mass

flow of air and gives it and the products of com-
bustion a large velocity increment.

A jet propulsion device is fundamentally a tube
into which fuel is injected to mix with air and to
burn ejecting hot gases at high velocity to pro-
duce thrust. The ram jet consists of a diffuser,
a combustion chamber, and an expansion nozzle.
Air at high speed enters the diffuser and di-
verges. The velocity energy of the air is convert-
ed to pressure energy. The air then leaves the
diffuser at a high pressure and enters the com-
bustion chamber Where it is mixed with fuel
which is injected into the chamber from fuel noz-
zles. Combustion in the engine is initiated by a
spark plug during the starting cycle. but during
operation continuous combustion is self support-
ing. The burning fuel heats the air passing
through the combustion chamber and causes it to
expand. The expanding gases pass through the
nozzle with a conversion of pressure energy to
velocity energy. The thrust thus produced is
equal to the momentum change or the product of
the mass flow of air per second and velocity enter-

TAM 63 AT WORK

ON THE AUTOMOBILE

BY GENE O. COWIE, ME, '52

‘When Archimedes, according to legend, ran
naked through the streets of Athens yelling
“eureka” upon the discovery of the principle that
bears his name, he gave to science» its first know-
ledge of the properties of fluids. Many other
properties have since been discovered. These
properties, though simple, have been used to solve
some of the most complicated problems that have
arisen in the development of the passenger auto-
mobile. Efficiency, comfort, ease of handling,
and safety have been added to the present family
car by a few simple applications of the principles
of fluid mechanics taught in TAM 63.

In the text by Cox and Germano, fluid mechan-
ics is defined as “that part of the science of me-
chanics which deals with the effect of forces on
the form and motion of fluids. Fluid mechanics
may be divided into hydrostatics . . . the study of
fluids at rest . . . and hydrokinetics . . . the study
of fluids in motion.” Since hydrostatics is simp-
ler to understand and receives wider application
than hydrokinetics, only the application of hydro-
statics will be considered here The definition of
hydrostatics is often extended to include fluids
in motion if changes in kinetic energy, friction
losses, and accelerations are of no consideration.
Thus hydrostatics does not apply to the fluid
clutch or the torque converter, but rather to shock
absorbers, brakes, hydraulic valve lifters, and
power steering.

Fluids have three properties which are put to
work in the above mentioned automotive parts.
Fluids, in the liquid state (it must be remembered
that fluids refers to both liquids and gasses) can
not be appreciably compressed unless extreme
pressure is applied. The bulk of water, for in-
stance, is about 1/70 that of steel. Such high
pressures are seldom encountered. When a fluid
is set in motion there is friction between the mole-
cules causing resistance to liquid flow. This re-
sistance to fluid flow is called viscosity. The ex-
pression “slow as molasses in January” best il-
lustrates viscosity. Pressure applied to a fluid in
a_ closed system is transmitted equally in all direc-
tions, the farmer who drove a cork into his water
Jug with a hammer discovered this principle when
the bottom broke off the jug.

_The first device employing hydrostatics that is
still in wide use is the hydraulic shock absorber.
The name shock absorber is -a misnomer because
shock absorbers do not absorb shock. When the‘
wheel of an automobile hits an obstruction, the
spring supporting that wheel deflects and absorbs
most of the shock, the remainder being absorbed
by'the tire. But the spring, loaded with the
weight of the car, will rebound and oscillate if left
free to do so. There is also the danger of break-

10

ing the spring. Most springs can sustain the
sudden loading caused by a bump, but break on
the rebound. Thus to protect the spring and to
add to riding comfort it becomes necessary ‘to
check the rebound of automobile springs with
shock absorbers. The first shock absorbers con-
sisted of two friction disks, one connected to the
spring and one to the axle in such a manner that
when the spring deflected, the disks rotated
against each other. The friction between the
disks checked the action of the springs.

 

Figure 1

The fluid shock absorber was found much more
satisfactorily that the friction shock. The fluid
shock absorber works the same way as a door
check. The door is opened against a spring, then
is checked when the spring tires to slam the door
closed. In the same way the shock absorber al-
lows the spring to deflect without restriction,
then slows down the rebound.

The fluid shock absorber applies the properties
of incompressibility and viscocity. Figure 1 is a
diagram showing the operation of the Houdaille
shock absorber used for a long time of the Ford.
Arm a is connected to the axle of the car, and arm
I) to the frame. When the spring deflects,_the
moving vanes c rotate with respect to the fixed
vanes d making chambers e and e’ larger and
chambers f and f’ smaller. The fluid in the shock
absorber flows from chamber f to e and from f’
to 6’ through the fixed orifices g and g’ and ball
check valves 17, and h’. The passages are large
enough that the deflection of the spring 1S prac-
tically unrestricted. When the spring rebounds,
the ball check valve h and h’ seat and the fluid is
forced through the fixed orifices g a_nd_g’. Since
the orifices are small, the flow _of fluid is restrict-
ed, and the rebound of the springs is checked.

The telescopic shock absorber is used on pres-
ent day cars. The telescopic shock applies the
same principles as the Houdaille and has the ball
check valve and fixed orifice. A piston and cylin-

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

der are used to force the fluid between two cham-
bers. Some compensations are made for changes
in viscosity due to changes in temperature, for
rough and smooth roads, and numerous other
factors that affect the action of the fluid shock
absorber.

Braking has always presented many problems,
and even after the introduction of the internal
expansion principle the mechanical brake left
much to be desired. Great pains were always
taken to adjust mechanical brakes so that each
brake shoe exerted the same force and hence the
same braking power. If a brake on the right side
were set too close, the car pulled to the right
when the brakes were applied. One set of brake
shoes was always wearing out before the others.
The hydraulic brake eliminated these problems.

The hydraulic brake makes use of the incom-
pressibility of a liquid, and the principle that a
force applied to a fluid in a closed system is trans-
mitted equally in all directions. The system con-
sists of a master cylinder, four wheel cylinders,
and tubing connecting the wheel cylinders with
the master cylinder. The master cylinder con-
sists of a fluid reservoir, a piston, and a cylinder.
The piston is connected to the brake pedal by a
linkage which multiplies the force applied to the
brake pedal. The wheel cylinders consist of a
cylinder with a piston in each end. These pistons
are connected to the upper end of the brake shoes
as shown i-n figure 2. The system is filled with
brake fluid, which is poured into the fluid reser-
voir on the master cylinder. When force is ap-
plied to the brake pedal, the piston in the master
cylinder exerts pressure on the brake fluid
which in turn exerts force on the wheel Cylinders
(1,. Since the pressure is constant throughout the
brake fluid, the force transmitted to each wheel
cylinder and hence each brake shoe b is the same.
The piston in the master cylinder is smaller than
those in the wheel cylinders, so the force exerted
by the master cylinder is further multiplied by
the hydraulic system. When force is gained,
something must be sacrificed; in this case, dis-
tance. To move the wheel cylinders only a frac-
tion of an inch, the brake pedal must be moved
several inches.

Figure 2

JANUARY, 1952

When the wheel is rotated in the direction
shown in figure 2 and the brakes are applied, the
brake drum tends to pull the front shoe into the
drum and throw the rear shoe away from the
drum, causing more force and hence more wear
on the front shoe. To equalize the two shoes, the
front piston is made smaller in diameter than the
rear. Since the force exerted on the piston is
directly proportional to its area, less force is ex-
erted by the fluid on the front cylinder. But the
tendency of the brake drum to attract or repel
the shoes varies with the speed at which the drum
is rotating. Chrysler solves the problem by
mounting the brake shoes as shown in figure 3.
When the wheel is rotating in the direction shown
and the brakes are applied, both shoes are pulled
against the drum and the most use is made of the
car’s own momentum in stopping the vehicle.

Figure 3

When the hydraulic brakes first came out Ply-
mouth was using it as one of their main sales
points. Mr._Murray Fahnestock, editor of Ford
Field magazine, tells of seeing a Plymouth sales-
man at an auto show demonstrating the hydrau-
lic principle. The salesman had blown up a rub-
ber glove and was pointing out the fact that there
was equal pressure in each finger. To this Mr.
Fahnestock said,.“¥es, but punch a hole in just
one finger.” This incident illustrates the biggest
danger of the hydraulic brake. If just one wheel
cylinder or one brake line develops a leak, all four
brakes are rendered useless. Extreme care in
production and a few years of development have
eliminated this danger, and hydraulic brakes have
for some time been used of all American pass-
enger cars.

_A very complicated problem that has arisen
with the development of the automobiles engine
is the maintenance of valve tappet clearance (see
fig.'4).. Each of the valves in the automobile
engine is closed about three quarters of the time
that the engine is running. When the valves are
closed, it is necessary to maintain some clearance
between the end of the valve and the heel of the
cam to make sure that the valve seats properly.
Ford, for instance, specifies 0.010 - 0.012 inch
clearance of the intake valves and 0.014 - 0.016

P|TT’S SCHOOL’S OF ENGINEERING

BY DR. G. R. FITTERER

In the early schools of engineering the
courses were usually of short duration and
were established to upgrade the trades. The first
formal education in mining engineering was es-
tablished at Freiberg, Germany in 1765, and pro-
bably the first engineering school was established
in France as Ecole des Ponte et Chausses in 1775.
Twelve years later a college called the Pittsburgh
Academy was established in the American wilder-
ness.

Engineering education in Great Britain did not
start formally until the establishment of a civil
engineering chair at the University of Glasgow
in 1840. A government School of Mines was later
established in London in 1851.

Actually, formal engineering education as we
know it today, was not started in the various
countries until the latter part of the 1800’s. It
was not until about 1880 that the English univer-
sities were willing to accept this newer branch of
learning.

In this country, West Point began to develop
formal instruction in military engineering as
early as 1817. Rensselar Polytechnic Institute
at Troy, New York, introduced studies of an en-
gineering character in 1825 although a regular
curriculum in civil engineering was not develop-
ed before 1839. Dartmouth College in 1851 estab-
lished the Chandler Scientific School intended to
be a school of the industrial vocations. Schools
like Harvard and Yale did not introduce engineer-
ing courses until about 1854, and the first en-
gineers were graduated from Harvard in 1852.
The first American School of Mines was estab-
lished at Columbia in 1864 and Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology was established in 1868.

The Origin And Development Of
Engineering At Pitt

Meanwhile certain changes were taking place in
the Pittsburgh Academy which had changed its
name to Western University of Pennsylvania.
General engineering courses were started and in
1846 two men were graduated as civil engineers.
In 1865 a chair‘ of engineering was established in
this University. The first professor to teach min-
ing engineering was appointed in 1869.

It may be seen from this historical outline that
the University of Pittsburgh was among the first
six colleges of the United States to offer instruc-
tion in the engineering sciences and probably the
first college west of the Allegheny Mountains to
foster and develop this profession.

At the start of 1846 there were no special de-

partments of engineering. In other words, there ‘

were no branches in this field—just general
courses of engineering were offered. The mod-
ern development of the Engineering School at the
University started when Professor Daniel Car-
hart became the professor of civil engineering in
1882. The records indicate that engineering

12

AND MINES

ceased to be a department and became a school in
1882, at which time Dr. Carhart was made the
first Dean of Engineering. From that point on,
the various departments were organized and de-
grees were granted in the special divisions, such
as mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering.

The establishment of the School of Mines by the
State Legislature came shortly after these de-
velopments and this school was formally founded
in 1895. During the early years, the two schools
were separated and each had a different Dean.
Since 1921, however, the Schools of Engineering
and of Mines have been combined administrative-
ly and, at the present time, they operate as a
single division of the University.

A few other items of history might be of inter-
est. For example, the first building to be con-
structed on the present campus was State Hall.
This was built for the purposes of the School of
Mines and with State funds. In 1909 Thaw Hall
was built for the School of Engineering and this
was partially financed by subscriptions from the
people of Pittsburgh.

The interest in engineering at the University
at the turn of the century can be best exempli-
fied by the fact that at that time the entire Uni-
versity consisted only of The College, the School
of Engineering, and the Allegheny Observatory.
At that time there were fewer than eighty stu-
dents in the University and the majority of these
were enrolled in engineering under Professor
Carhart.

Some of the science and engineering pioneers
in the early days at the University became world
renowned. Brashear, Langley, and Fessenden
were responsible for the first large reflecting
astronomical telescope, the first or second air-
plane, and the first radio broadcast, respectively.

It is not generally known that the University
of Pittsburgh, Schools of Engineering and Mines
established one of the first cooperative programs
of engineering education in the United States.
This program involved the efforts of the student
both by working alternately in industry and on
the campus. This not only aided in his support
but gave him a knowledge of industrial operations
at the same time that he obtained his engineering
education. This program was highly successful
but was dropped after 1929 because of the diffi-
culties in arranging cooperation with industry in
the midst of a major depression.

The Engineering School now consists of the de-
partments of chemical, civil, electrical, general,
industrial, and mechanical engineering. The
School of Mines is composed of the geological,
metallurgical, mining, and petroleum engineer-
ing departments. Each of these departments, in
turn, have certain sub-divisions, indicating spe-

0 you recognize this building? Probably
Dnot unless you are C. E. or Ch. E. This
building is the Automotive and Highways Labora-
tory, which houses a testing laboratory of the
C. E.’s and process laboratory of the Ch. E. This
article will deal with the Chemical Engineering
Unit Observations Laboratory.

In your first three years as a student in Chemi-
cal Engineering, you are exposed to certain fun-
damental engineering processes. In Ch. E. 9 and
10 you learn to take Heal and Overall Material
Balances. In Ch. E. 15 and 16 you begin to grasp
the fundamentals of Fluid Flow, Heat Transfer,
Conduction, Radiation, and Convection. In Ch.
E. 18, the problems of Filtration and Sedimenta-
tion are attacked and the subject begins to clear
itself in your mind. These subjects together with
your chemistry, physics, and mathmetics courses
give you a good basic background.

While these courses do give you the theory of
how and Why a certain process takes place, you

JANUARY, 1952

still feel uncertain as how to apply all this know-
ledge to a practical industrial problem. If at the
end of your junior year you are asked to run a
filter press in an industrial plant you would know
the theory but not how to run it.

So the Chemical Engineering Department de-
signed a practical laboratory course Where you
would run a chemical engineering process on a
pilot plant scale, so as to give you some practical
experience when you go out into industry as a
chemical engineer. This course designated Ch. 33
and 34, is taken for 8 hours a day, one day a week
for your entire senior year. You run some 15
chemical processes some of which take one week,
and some other which take two weeks. After the
experiment is run and the correct data is collect-
ed, you must correllate all the material gathered
and tabulate it in a written report explaining the
experiment and the results of your work. _These
reports that are similar to large industrial re-
ports run from 15 to 30 pages long.

SPRAY DRIER

Now on to a few of the chemical processes.

The material to be spray dried is supplied by
means of the low air-pressure feed system to the
atomizing nozzle situated near the top of the
desiccator. The atomization occurs in the desic-
cator just beyond the nozzle tip in the downward
moving hot air stream. This hot air has been
drawn from the room and is heated to the desired
temperature by the air heater. The air flow is
maintained by the centrifugal fan that is located
between the desiccator and the cyclone separator.

The fineness of the spray resulting from the
atomization, plus its being intimately mixed with
the hot dry air as is accomplished in the desic-
cator, provides the necessary conditions fo.r rapid
drying. Thus, within the desiccator, the moisture
in the atomized feed is transferred to the hot air
and with proper operating conditions the feed
material leaves the bottom of the desiccator as a
powder dispersed in the moist air stream.

In the multiclone collector, the bulk of the powd-
er is removed from the air stream and is collected
in the multiclone hopper.

The rated water evaporation capacity of the

gryer is 25 pounds per hour at 300°F temperature
rop.

TRAY DRIER

This drier is a completely integrated unit de-
signed for control of temperature, velocity and
humidity. Tempeature is automatically controll-
ed from room temperature to 450°F. Air velo-
sity is readily controlled by means of manually
controlled dampers. Humidity is automatically
controlled over a wide range by means of a Brown
“Electro-vane” humidity controller.

Hot air from the fan enters the plenum cham-
ber under a slight pressure where it passes to
each tray and is directed through down the ma-
terial by means of individually adjustable air de-
flector plates. The air then passes through the
perforated tray bottoms and out into the return
air chamber. This chamber is under suction from
the inlet side of the fan, thus to the fan for re-
circulation. When the wet bulb temperature calls
for more moisture in the air, the humidity con-
troller automatically closes the motor controlled
dampers located near the bottom of the heating
element chamber. At the same time the dampers
in the air conditioning chamber are opened. This
causes the air to be circulated through the humid-
ifying sprays, which are now under the fan suc-
tion where air is conditioned to the required point
by the absorption of water vapor. This condition-
ing process keeps occurring until the required wet
bulb temperature is reached, after which the
dampers return to their original positions by the
automatic reversing of the motor controlled damp-
ers actuated, of course, from the humidity con-
troller. The humidity controller through the dry
bulb temperature controls the amount of heat
released in the heating element chamber.

Double Effect Evaporator

The arrangement consists essentially of a pre-
heater and two evaporator effects, the first effect
having a horizontal calandria and the second ef-
fect, a vertical calandria and salt catch. A
double pass heat exchanger condenses the vapor
from the second effect. The cooling water rate
through the condenser is measured with an ori-
fice. Two condensate storage tanks are provided
for alternate use. The remaining equipment is a
steam operated feed pump, vacuum pump, feed
storage tank and agitator.

Steam from the high pressure main passes
through a reducing valve to the preheater and to
the horizontal calandria of the first effect. The
Vapor from the first effect is passed through a
centrufugal separator to the condenser. The con-
densate from the condenser is collected in the
storage tanks.

The steam pump supplies fresh feed to either
the preheate or directly to the first effect if the-
preheater is not in use. A centrifugal pump cir-
culates material through the preheater. The con-
centrated liquor from the first effect is heated in
the second effect by the condensing vapor from
the first effect. By-pass lines around the second
effect to the condenser and storage tanks are
provided if operation of the equipment as a single
effect is desired.

Horizontal Heat Exchanger

The heat exchanger consists of a heating and
cooling section operated in series. Oil is pumped
from a tank to the heating section and then to the
cooling section in a continuous path, the sectional
differentiation being made by introducing steam
and cooling Water at the proper jackets. Oil
flow rates are measured with a sharp-edged ori-
fice. Cooling Water rates are determined with a
nutating type Water meter. Specific gravities of
the oil are run with A.P.I. hydrometers, and oil
viscosities by means of_ the Saybolt visconimeter.
A 500 lb. Toledo scale is provided for meter cali-
brations.

Filtration Press

The filtration equipment consists of a washing
type and frame press. The filtering medium is
canvass cloth. The slurry tank is mechanically
agitated and is pessure tight so that compressed
air on the slurry surface can be used to give ac-
curate pressure control during filtration runs. A
diaphragm type pressure gage is located on the
feed line to the presses for the pressure measure-
ments. Filtrate rates are measured batchwise on
a platform scale. The slurry consists of a mix-
ture of lime and clay in water. Accurate Values
of cake moisture and percent solids in the slurry
are essential. All samples must be taken in du-
plicate. Moisture samples of the cake should be
taken from opposite quarters of each frame and
then composited.

Now, that the experimentis completed, you
must Write up your report and hand it in one
week later. Like all other courses in this univer-
sity, you must be graded for your Work, and these
reports with their results are the basis for a
major part of your grade.

TENSILE STRENGTH TESTING

OF POLYSTYRENE

WALLACE B. RAMSEY, COL '52

BY

How strong is this plastic toy?” is a _question
suspicious parents have been asking har-
assed clerks ever since the flood of plastic pro-
ducts came after World War II. If the ‘toy is
made of one of the rubberlike plastics, the parents
are usually satisfied with the spectacular demon-
stration of bouncing the toy off of a concrete
floor to show how “strong” it is. The Engineer
who designed the toy and who had to know how
thick to make various parts of the toy so that it
would not break also had to know how “strong”
the plastic is. He can find this information by
consulting his handbooks. Twisting, bending,
squeezing and pulling apart are all methods of
testing the strength of a material. The method
of pulling,a-fnaterial apart which gives the so-

”/,c;al»led‘“’Eensile strength” of a material is the most

widely used of these tests. By common usage
among engineers, the term tensile strength is
what an engineer means when he talks about
“how strong” a material is. Tensile strength is
defined as the number of pounds required to pull
apart a bar of material which has a cross-sectional
area of one square inch. In order to make the
tensile strength of a plastic mean the same thing
to everyone, the plastics manufacturers have co-
operated with the American Society for Testing
Materials to develop standard procedures for the
testing of each type of plastic. The procedure to
be described is the one used for determining the
strength of polystyrene plastics. Polystyrene is
a clear colorless plastic which looks like Plexiglas.
The importance of polystyrene is shown in the
simple fact that enough of it was produced in the
United States last year to give every American
man, woman and child a block of it weighing over
two pounds.

Figure 1 shows a full scale drawing of a poly-
styrene tensile test bar. This bar is 1/8” thick.
Although the bar may be cut from a sheet of plas-
tic, the more common practice is to make it by
moulding it. A mould of heavy steel is made with
a center cavity having the dimensions shown in
the drawing. Molten plastic is forced into the
mould under high pressure, permitted to cool, and
then removed from the mould as a hard tensile
test bar. When the tensile bar is moulded, it is
not possible to keep the temperature of the molten
plastic exactly the same at all times. Neither is
it possible to force the plastic into the mould in
exactly the same amount of time, nor can the
mould be kept at the same temperature at all
times. These variations of moulding conditions
usually result in what are called strains in the
plastic. The hot plastic chills and hardens where
it touches the cool steel mould while the inside of
the test piece remains liquid for a while. When

JANUARY, 1952

the entire mass finally cools, strains are set up
between the part which cooled quickly and the
part which cooled slowly.

_ Although all of the strain cannot be eliminated,
it can be reduced to a point where it can be safely
neglected by the treatment called conditioning. In
the conditioning process, the test bars are placed
in an oven at 50°C. The temperature must be
controlled to within 1°C. This temperature per-
mits a “thawing out” of the plastic. The test bar
does not become liquid but this heating is enough
to allow the plastic to soften slightly and the
strains are relieved. The American Society for
Testing Materials requires that the oven meet sev-
eral other specifications. First, the oven must
have a forced blower in it which continuously

new employee than several dozen posters. It is
most important that the new man read the safety

E & M Cabinet, the guiding hand of the
Engineering and ‘Mines Association, has
been busy providing social and athletic
activities for State's Men. The first event,
the fall dance held at West View on Nov-
ember 16, was a success as usual. At the
smoker held at the Murray Beacon Alleys
on December 3, some 70 men had an eve-
ning of free bowling and door prizes.

In football their were two sections, one
with six teams the other with five. The
playoff game found the Civil A team de-
feating the Civil B's 12 to 0. The Civil A's
then entered the campus playoffs and were
beaten by Psi Omega dental fraternity, the

The American Institute of Chemical En-
gineers has brought to the undergraduate
body of Engineers, films pertinent to the
chemical industries and speakers who are
prominent in the field of chemical engin-
eering.

Mr. Gersen, of E. E. Dupont DeNemours
and Company, Incorporated, spoke to the
joint seminar November 29, on octane ‘-:at-
ing of gasoline.

Pi Tau Sigma, the honorary Mechanical
Engineering fraternity, initiated 15 men to
active membership, bringing its total mem-
bership to 28. Mr. Erdlac of the Aeronauti-
cal Department was initiated to Honorary
Membership at the same time. The ban-
quet honoring the new members was held
on November 13. Mr. Tacey, Associate
Professor of Speech, spoke on "Black Liz-
zie—The Model T".

On November 8-10, Gene Cowie, lack
MacMahon, Andy Melzer, Art Mikoleit and
Bob Robinson drove to Lexington, Kentuc-
ky for the annual National Pi Tau Sigma
Convention. Besides learning what the fra-
ternity is doing as a national group, the
delegates spent a wonderful weekend in
the Blue Grass region. The fellows came
back tired but richer from their experien-
ces.

The American Institute of Mining Engin-
eers has had a program highlighted by out-
standing speakers. On November l5, Mr.
M. D. Cooper, Director of Mining Engin-
eering Education for the National Coal Ass-
ociation in Washington, D. C. ,presented an
interesting talk. Mr. Cooper told the Pitt

in each section will play off as in football.
Plans are being made for competition in
volleyball, softball, swimming, ping pong,
and any other sport in which an interest is
displayed.

All students are urged to watch the new

Aluminum Company of America, and "Fifth
Freedom" distributed by Allegheny Ludlum
Steel Corporation.

The highlight of the semester's activities
was a plant trip to Schenley Distillery.

This semester Pi Tau Sigma undertook
a project which will benefit the engineer-
ing school tremendously. Since there is
no course in slide rule manipulation at Pitt,
the group resolved to begin teaching the
course to any student interested, without
charge. It was felt that the engineering
student benefits greatly if he learns how to
use a slide rule in his freshman year. The
members of Pi Tau Sigma chose one hour
a week that they could teach. Schedules
for classes were posted in State Hall and
advertised in the Pitt News. Every engin-
eer, especially freshmen, lacking a work-
ing knowledge of a slide rule, was urged
to attend. The response was so good at the
first few sessions that the classes will be
resumed again next semester.

was Student Night, and those students will-

a dinner at the Tuck Shop, and then heard
Mr. E. I. Wasp talk on Coal Pipe Lines.

The AIME plans to cut down on the num-
ber of meetings in the future. Where four
meetings were held this semester, only
one or two will be held next semester.
This reduction will give more time to the
departmental seminars.

At the initiation ceremonies on December
10, six new men became members of the
Beta Delta Chapter of Eta Kappa Nu, Hon-
orary Electrical Engineering Fraternity.
These new initiates were: William Vogt,
Robert Steimer, Arthur Hershkowitz, Rudy
Putkovich, George Raynovich and Peter
Pettler. The principal speaker at the ban-
quet which followed the initiation was Mr.
Donald McGill, Manager of the Headquar-
ters Sales Training Department of Westing-
house Electric Corporation.

As part of the new pledge program in-
augurated this fall, Peter Pettler received a
cash award for submitting the outstanding
industrial employment survey. Mr. Pettler
reported on the Gulf Oil Companies. The
other firms surveyed were: Fisher Body
Works, Westinghouse Electric Corporation,

Members of the Pitt Chapter of the Soc-
iety of Automotive engineers were treated
to a program of speakers, social events, and
athletics which it challanges any other cam-
pus organization to equal, both in quality
and in quantity. In addition to the trip to
the Fisher Body Plant reported in the Oct-
ober issue, the group has heard some out-
standing speakers. On October 18, Mr. R.
I. S. Piggott presented a paper on liquid
fuels. Mr. Piggott, presently the national
president of the American Society of Mech-
anical Engineers was the national president
of SAE and is the first man to have held
both positions. On November 15 the group
heard a talk on the development of automo-
bile manufacturing by Mr. Murray Fahnes-
tock, dietor of Ford Field, and one of the
most active members of the Pittsburgh chap-

This semester the members of Sigma
Gamma Epsilon went all out in their efforts
to increase the membership and activities
of the Beta Chapter. Eight pledges were
treated a spaghetti dinner at the Naples
Restaurant, downtown Pittsburgh, on Nov-
ember 8. After wading through a pile of
spaghetti and meat balls, the pledges were
briefed on the membership requirments by
President Bob Cook. Faculty Advisor, Prof-
essor H. G. Botset then informed the pled-
ges of the professional and social advan-
tages afforded by college fraternities and
organizations and discussed the accomp-
lishments of Sigma Gamma Epsilon.

At the fraternity banquet held on Dec-
ember‘ 4, 1951, five of the eight pledges
were initiated into the Beta Chapter. The
new members are: Donald Dodge, Robert
Kretzler, Bill Zupon, Neal McMillian and
Iohn Smithyman. Dr. G. R. Fitterer, Dean
of the Schools of Engineering and Mines
spoke to those present on the social and
technical improvements and advancements
made by engineers in the past fifty years.

Several pieces of apparatus have been
constructed by the Eta Kappa Nu members
as part of their laboratory construction pro-
jects. These include a video amplifier, a
capacitor analizer and power supplies for
two frequency generators. Plans are being
laid for many future projects. HKN invites
all students in the Electrical Engineering
Department who are interested in working
on these laboratory projects to contact Mr.

officer of Eta Kappa Nu for information.

ter. On November 27, twenty of the Pitt SAE
attended the regional dinner meeting of
the Pittsburgh Chapter at the Webster Hall

der, national president of SAE. Mr. Roe-
der spoke on the engineer's place in indus-
try. On December 6, the speaker was Dr.
McGregor of the Mellon Institute. Dr. Mc
Gregor spoke on silicone lubricants, a very
timely subject since silicones are receiving
more and more attention.

The group forgot their studies for a while
and attended a stag party at the Highland
Seaplane Base on November 23. The tum-
out was large and the party was a success.

by the members of S.G.E. on October 25,
at the Mellon Institute. Following this meet-
ing the Society held open house at the Gulf

through the laboratories and a dinner.

The members of S.G.E. also attended the
sixth annual meeting of the AIME on Nov-
ember 2, 1951, at the William Penn Hotel.
Main interest was centered around the Pet-

ical Science have had a varied program
of events in addition to the General Sem-
inar. The first trip of the year, to the Tay-
lorcraft Corporation, provided an opportun-
ity to see the stages in small aircraft pro-
duction. Of special interest to the Aero’s
was the doping and fabrication room.
Among the outstanding programs held at
school was a talk by Lee Noga, A.E. '52,

This semester a variety of subjects were
brought into the American Institute of In-
dustrial Engineers seminar.

On October 18, Mr. John W. Devine,
Vice President of Consultants for Manage-
ment, Incorporated, presented a speech en-
titled, ”Success and It's Meaning’. Mr. De-
vine, who is presently teaching cost ac-
counting here at the University of Pitts-
burgh, used his wide industrial experience
to give a very realistic definition of success
and how to obtain it in industry.

The Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce
honored the AIIE Seminar with a speaker
on December 1. The speaker was Mr. Rob-
ert E. Wood, who is the Director of Public
Relations at the Reliance Life Insurance
Company of Pittsburgh and member of the
Pittsburgh Civic Salesman's Club. Mr.

lenge”. Mr. Wood not only showed the
Seminar What progress has already been
made in the Pittsburgh development pro-
ject, but also discussed the future plans of
the development program.

"Safety in Industry" was the subject of
the December 6th Seminar. Mr. John L.
Tatman, Assistant Superintendent of the
Rolling Mills Department of the National
Tube Company, McKeesport, delivered the
speech. Safety in industry is a subject
which is closely allied with the studies of
the Industrial Engineering students. In his
speech, Mr. Tatman gave a brief history
of the safety programs in the steel industry
and discussed the problems of installing
and maintaining an effective safety pro-
gram.

For the Seminars of January 3 and 17,
there will be two movies which have been
scheduled through a national film distrib-

The Evening School Association, in keep-
ing with their policy of providing social
functions for Pitt's Evening students, has
taken two more steps toward their goal.
The second social event of the semester
was a square dance on Friday, November
2, held at Rose Grove, North Park. The

dance just whipped the night-owls into
shape for the Snowflake Ball, a Semi-forrnal
affair, which took place at the Edgewood
Country Club on Saturday, December 8.
In the future, the association has a second
square dance planned, for Saturday, Feb-
ruary 23, at the Swisshelrn Community
House.

The ARBA was very fortunate to have
several good speakers during the fall sem-
ester. Mr. I. McKnight of the Portland Cem-
ent Association addressed the group on
November 20. His topic was "The Penn-
sylvania Turnpike". On December 11, Mr.
Paul Reinhold, national president of the
American Road Builders, presented to the
Pitt Chapter an award for being an out-
standing student chapter. Mr. Reinhold also
addressed the group on the subject of "To-
day's Highways". The chapter is planning
to send several delegates to the national
convention in Houston, Texas, Ianuary 21-
24.

The Institute of Radio Engineers, at their

first meeting, heard Professor Pierce of the .

Western State Psychiatric Hospital speak
on electronic applications used in treating
mental patients. Two weeks later, they tra-
velled to the South Side branch of the Du-

The second speaker of the semester was Mr.
Howard Stillwell who spoke on the quality
control of chemical processes through elec-
tronic measuring devices. The third speak-
er of the semester, Professor George Diding-
er, gave an introductory talk on the various
electronic and physical aspects of the cyc-
loton. Following the talk the I.R.E. group
was conducted on a tour of the University
of Pittsburgh's cyclotron.

On Friday, November 16, Sigma Beta
Sigma, the professional engineering frat-
ernity, had its bi-annual initiation. After
three weeks rest, the fraternity acted as
host for the Snowflake Ball. On the follow-
ing Friday, the members braved the snow
and sleet to attend the Annual Old Timers
Night and Initiation Banquet. The affair was
held at "The Ranch" located on Rodi Road,
Penn Township. The Fraternity has chosen
Ed Keller to speak at the Annual Honors
Lecture, scheduled for Friday, January 18.

Sigma Tau, the honorary engineering
fraternity had its initiation on Monday, Dec-
ember 17. The initiations, held at the Fac-
ulty Club, admitted twenty students and one
faculty member.

The fraternity is slowly but carefully
working on the completion of plans to con-
struct a monument, to be built on the Pitt
Campus. Many other projects are planned.
The fraternity is also holding a dinner and
meeting on January 18, to elect new offi-
cers.

A census taker stops at a house on Main
Street to gather his information. He notes
the house number. The man who comes to
the deer informs him that there are three
other residents besides himself. The census
taker asks the man his age and notes it in
his book. He asks the ages of the other
members of the household. The man de-
clines to give their ages. but volunteers
the information that the product of the ages
of the three individuals is 1296 and that
the sum of their ages is equal to the house
number. The census taker reflects awhile.
He is not quite satisfied. He asks. "Are you
the oldest?" The man replies that he is. The
census taker then deduces the ages of the
other three individuals and goes on to the
next house.

Problem: What were the ages of the

' IN INDUSTRY

EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the second in
the “Pitt Student’s in Industry” series. Bert
Rautine gathered the material from an “A

to Z” account of gun cradle production dur-

ing his summer employment with the Ohio

Machine and Boiler Company in Cleveland,

Ohio.

uppose your best customer handed you a set

of blueprints for a gun cradle and asked you
how much it would cost him. How would you ans-
wer, and what would you say about a delivery
date? To answer quickly, there would be many
facts you would need to know.

The cradle barrel is a tube of high alloy steel,
forged and roughturned to an outside diameter
of 16 inches and an inside diameter of 14 inches.
It is 32 3/8 inches long and weighs 384 pounds.
Welded to the cradle are 31 different parts rang-
ing in thickness from 2 inches, weighing 14
pounds, to 1/8 inch weighing only a few ounces.
These parts must be fabricated within a strict
tolerance of plus or minus 1/32 of ‘an inch. They
are round, square, curved, beveled, and any other
shape. They have any number of operations to
be performed on them before they are welded to
the barrel. The parts are welded to the cradle
barrel at 9, 30, 36, and 60 degrees and other
angles at various heights from the base and exact
dimensions from the centerline. Some of the
pieces are required to hold the tremendous force
of the recoil, while others hold only a hydraulic
oil line or a name plate.

How can this cradle be set up for fabrication
in a boiler shop to a tolerance of plus of minus
1/32 of an inch, when the boilermakers are happy
with a piece of work one quarter as accurate?
This problem of fabrication and many others like
it are solved every day by the men in industry.

The first important consideration on a job is
the estimate of cost. The estimate must be made
low enough to suit the buyer and yet high enough
for the producer to make a profit. If the producer
allows too much for profit or unseen costs, the
job will go to a lower bidder, who has used more
efficient methods of production and has figured
about the same amount of profit. The smart en-
gineer or cost man will know the most efficient
method of producing a part, whether on a pro-
duction basis or in single units. A company’s
reputation for low rate of rework and rejects may
often influence the buyer to award the contract
to a slightly higher bidder with a guarantee of
above-average work. Some companies employ
good-will men, capable of making decisions on
quality and reject, and intelligent enough to re-
tain good will when the job hits a flaw.

BY BERT RAUTINE, ME, '52

On the cost estimate of the gun cradle job, the
change from machining to burning of parts with
a straight line oxy-acetylene torch made great
savings in the production of parts and clinched a
contract for the Ohio Machine and Boiler Com-
pany. Formerly, the parts which were beveled
by a slow, tedious, costly milling operation cost
the producer more than the welding of the part
to the cradle barrel. When a straight line cutting
machine and table with calibated side members
and interchangeable setup fixtures was used, 64
machining operations were converted to torch
cutting. For beveled arc cuts, the same burners
were used on a radius arm. The large flanges

. were burned accurately from steel plate with a

pantograph burner, using a double tip torch
which burned two parts at the same time.
Knowledge of how these milling operations
could be converted to oxy-acetylene burning did
not come from textbooks or formulas, but from
years of practical experience and common sense.
Experience is invaluable when two or three men
study a drawing and list the time required for
handling, maching, burning, chipping, welding,
grinding, and other operations necessary to pro-
duce a finished product. When the difference
betwe n 1 1/4 minutes and 2 minutes for making

a part is mentioned it doesn’t sould like much.
Yet when thousands of parts are produced, that
small difference means the difference between
profit or loss on each part. Or, in figuring the cost
of a part, if one operation is neglected, that one
operation could mean the difference. So the men
who make the estimate of a job must be produc-
tion-wise and conscious of every minute detail of
every shop operation. This consciousness can
only be gained through years of practical exper-
ience.

All of the factors mentioned above come into
consideration when a job estimate is made by a
company for bidding purposes.

After the contract is signed, the practical pro-
duction man must set up the fabrication of parts,
assembly, cleaning, burning, welding, inspection
and shipping schedules to meet the demands of
the buyer. He has a given number of men to do
the job, and must allot the proper number of men
to each part of the operation in order to keep the
job rolling. If one man can torch-cut hundreds
of pieces by himself, and it takes three men to
grind and inspect the pieces, then there is no need
to have four men torch-cutting. Or if the pro-
duction schedule calls for 300 completed cradles
to be shipped every month, the steel to produce
them must arrive at the plant far ahead, to allow
for the operations to be done and the cradles
welded in time to meet the schedule. The produc-
tion man sets his schedule according to what can
be done by his given complement of men, and
it is the foreman’s job to see that the schedule is
met.

In order to fabricate the gun cradle to the strict
plus or minus 1/32 of an inch tolerance and yet be
able to produce hundreds of cradles a month with
few rejects, a fixture was built (see Fig. 1).
This fixture was designed to place all 31 separate
parts in their true relation to each other and in
exact relation to the centerline of the cradle bar-
rel. The base of this fixture is a highly finished
machined steel plate 58 inches diameter and 1 3/4
inches thick. It is mounted on angle iron legs
(Fig. 2) to give the operator easy hand-level ac-
cess to the parts. The cradle barrel is divided
into four quadrants, and 1 inch blanchard ground
steel plates are mounted vertically on the base,
one set of plates in each quadrant. Running
through these vertical plates are horizontal slid-
ing rods. At the inside end of these rods are the

. Vises which hold the parts to be welded. At the
. outside end are adjusting knobs which screw into

the Vertical plate. To get the exact distance from
the center, stop collars butt against the outside
face of the vertical plate. The part-holding Vises
are made in different shapes and the faces are on
the proper angle to hold the part.in the right loca-
tion. The thumb screws which hold the parts in
the Vises are_ mounted on the “fat side” of the
part. _The side of the vise opposite the thumb
screw is at the exact height required. Then if one
part is too thick, the Vise still holds it in location
and the subsequent machining operation trims the
“fat side”.

The barrel is put into the fixture and located
by the four screws mounted on the posts just
above the base. Then the parts are loaded into
the Vises. which are 1/16 of an inch oversize to

To get a quick start on the road to success, engineering graduates who join W/estinghouse start with an
orientation and training program at the new Educational Center. The reading room shown above
is one of the many facilities available at the new Center. To aid in carrying out the program,
there are also modern classrooms, auditorium, cafeteria, hobby rooms and recreation areas.

Regardless of the type of career you wish to follow in industry, the Westinghouse
Plan will be of value in» helping you achieve success.

A major part of the Plan is the Graduate Student Training Program. It has

been carefully developed through 50 years to enable top men, selected in leading
colleges, to Choose their careers wisely from the wide variety of opportunities
available at Westinghouse. This method enables you to become a responsible
factor, quickly, in one of America’s great industrial organizations.

Getting men started right is so important to Westinghouse that millions of
dollars have been spent to develop this Plan, provide the facilities and assemble

and maintain a staff for this job.

Experience shows that from this Training Program come most of the key person-
nel, in research, engineering, manufacturing and sales throughout the Company.

The major problems encountered in the design
of a ram jet engine can be well illustrated by go-
ing through the design of a miniature ram jet.
The design can be broken up into two parts; shell
housing design, and the ignition-combustion sys-

em.

Before _tl_ie housing design can be started, sev-
eral conditions of operation must be established.
The engine 1S assumed to be moving through the
air with a Mach number of .500. A Mach number
of .500 corresponds to a speed of 1/2 that of sound,
Mach number being equal to the velocity of sound
divided by the velocity in question. This would
give a velocity of approximately 375 miles per
hour or 550 feet _per second. This assumption is
based on the engine efficiency at different velo-
cities, the problems encountered at speeds in ex-
cess of 375 miles per hour, and the fact that the
thrust output of the engine varies nearly as the

square of the relative free stream velocity. The
velocity of 37 5 miles per hour is simulated for the
stationary model engine by allowing highly pres-
surized air to_ pass from a plenum chamber
tl_1rough_an orific_e of .750 inches in diameter
directly into the diffuser of the jet. The orifice
of the plenum chamber is located approximately
1/2 inch awa from the diffuser entrance. Be-
cause of the importance of frontal area in deter-
mining the drag, and therefore the power require-
ment, it IS necessary to keep the diffuser diameter
of the ram jet as small as possible for a given out-
put. In consideration of this fact, the diffuser
entrance can be assumed to be .500 inch in dia-
meter.

The problem in design now encountered is to
determine the diameter of the housing at points
along its longitudinal axis. All calculations are
based on two fundamental laws:

Perfect gas law, -; = RT

Continuity equation. in =’oAV

where, m : mass flow per second
(slugs per second)

e : mass density (slugs/ft3)

R = gas constant

(1718 ft-lb/lb-°R)

Calculations are greatly simplified through the
use of compressible fluid computation curves.
These curves are plots of Mach number versus
the ratio of the stagnation properties of a fluid
and its free stream properties. The stagnation
properties of the fluid are those which are mea-
sured by instruments which bring the velocity of
the air stream to zero at the point being investi-
gated. The stagnation values are higher than the
free stream values because there is an energy in-
crease due to the decrease of the air stream
Xflelocity. The compressibility curves are shown

ere.

By application of the continuity equation,

, the mass flow of air per second flow-
ing through the diffuser entrance can be calculat-
ed. All values used in the continuity equation
should be free stream values. The area can easily
be determined since the diameter is .500 inch.
The exact velocity can be calculated by multiply-
ing Mach number times the speed of sound. The
acoustical velocity is equal to forty-nine times the
square root of the free stream absolute tempera-
ture. The calculation of the free stream stagna-
tion temperature can be done through figure 3.

The mass flow per second through the diffuser
entrance must equal the mass flow per second at
any other point according to Bernoulli’s equation.
Solution of the mass flow equation for area gives

Once the required cross sectional
area is known for several points, the diameter can

‘be found; and the contour of the inside of the jet

housing can be drawn.

The next point to be investigated is the outlet
of the diffuser, this point also being the inlet of
the combustion chamber. At high velocities in
the combustion zone a flame can be easily blown
out. In order to prevent this, the velocity should
not exceed 150 feet per second; consequently a
velocity of 120 feet per second is assumed. The

assumption must also be made that there is a loss
in total pressure at the diffuser outlet equal to
10% of the difference between the velocity heads
at the diffuser inlet and outlet. This assumption
is made to compensate for the pressure loss due
to friction between the surface of the passage and
the moving fluid. The diameter of the diffuser
exit is then found by application of _the two laws
and three compressibility curves in a manner
similar to that for the diffuser entrance._ This
diameter is found to be 1.02 inches and 1S also
used as the constant diameter in the combustion
chamber. ,

The drop in total pressure at the combustion
zone is assumed to be two diffuser velocity heads
plus the pressure drop due to increase in momen-
tum of the gases by combustion. The efficiency
of combustion is taken as 85%. This efficiency
is based on the fact that the flame velocity ranges
from 1.5 to 2.5 feet per second while the actual
air fuel velocity is 120 feet per second. The ‘result
is incomplete burning. The temperature in the
combustion chamber is equal to the entrance tem-
perature of 540°R plus the result of the product
of the heating value of the acetylene fuel and the
combustion efficiency divided by the product of
the air fuel ratio and the specific heat. The air
fuel ratio is taken as 40.1; the specific heat, as
.246; and the heating value, as 21,000 Btu per
pound. The resulting combustion chamber tem-
perature is then found to be 2300°R.

After consideration of the pressure losses the
combustion chamber exit stagnation pressure is
found to be 16.46 pounds per square inch. The
pressure at the nozzle exit will be assumed at-
mospheric or 14.7 pounds per square inch. From
the ratio of nozzle entrance pressure to the nozzle
exit pressure and the curve of figure 1, the exit
Mach number is found equal to .400. The speed
of sound at the jet exit is 2350 feet per second and
the velocity of the mixture of air and gases IS 935
feet per second. From application of the continu-
ity equation the exit diameter is found to be .773
inch. Although the theoretical nozzle exit velo-
city is 935 feet per second, the assumption is made

that only 95% of the theoretical velocity is real-
ized because of incomplete nozzle expansion. Thus
the actual exit velocity will be 888 feet per second.

Since the velocity at both the exit and the en-
trance of the engine are known, the thrust pro-
duced by the engine can now be calculated. The
thrust is equal to the mass flow of .0O183 slugs
per second times the velocity increment from 554
feet per second at the jet entrance to 888 feet per
second at the nozzle exit. The thrust produced
is .608 pounds or 9.72 ounces. Actually since
complete expansion does not occur in the nozzle
(only a carefully designed converging-diverging
nozzle gives complete expansion), a pressure
thrust term should be introduced. The term is
very small in the case and is neglected. The net
thrust produced is equal to 9.72 minus 2.50 or
7.22 ounces. The value of 2.50 is the drag due to
the combustion system and will be explained in
the following section.

The principle of operation of the ignition-com-
bustion system is very simple. Acetylene from an
external source is injected into the combustion
chamber through fuel nozzles. The acetylene
mixes with the rapidly moving air stream and is
ignited. Ignition is started with a spark plug
fired by a Ford coil which is supplied by a 6.3
volt filament transformer.

Although the principle of operation of com-

A bustion is very simple, there are many problems

encountered in the actual design of a combustion
chamber. Chief among these is the mode of flame
stablization. Due to the high velocities through
the housing, the flame is very easily blown out.
The flame is kept burning by inserting flame
holders in the combustion chamber. The flame
holder acts as a baffle which causes the air stream
to become turbulent in the combustion area. This
turbulence causes a zone of recirculation which
feeds hot combustion products back into the baffle
thus serving as a continuous source of ignition
for the fresh air-fuel mixture. The development
of flame holders has been largely a matter of ex-
perimentation. The end toward which these ex-
periments are directed is the development of a
flame holder which gives efficient fuel combus-
tion in addition to very low drag within the com-
bustion chamber. The flame holder to be used in
this miniature ram also acts as the fuel injector.
It consists of a circular baffle which shields
twelve fuel injection holes located in a cylindrical
section of .34 inches in diameter as shown in
figure 4. The drag due to this combination fuel
nozzle and flame holder is approximated at 2.5
ounces. This combustion system has been in
actual use by the Westinghouse Electric Corpora-
tion which developed a model ram jet similar to
the one designed in this article.

Although the principle of the ram jet was pro-
posed some time ago in France, the successful ap-
plication of the principle was not made possible
until recently when the relatively high velocities
necessary to make this type of propulsion practi-
cal were realized. The first successful application
to flight was made in 1945 through a ram jet en-
gine developed by the physics department of
John Hopkins University.

Because of its simplicity of construction and
ease of maintenance due to no moving parts, the
ram jet has been given much consideration as a
power plant. Its application is especially suited

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

for high speed guided missiles where only a one
way trip is required and the problem of landing
and take off is minimized. Recently it has been
tested by General Electric Corporation as a means
of rotating the blades of a test helicopter by plac-
ing one of its six-inch midel 3R-1 ram jets on the
tip of each blade. Some of the results were- very
promising. One drawback was the necessity of
auxiliary power in starting blade rotation until
operating velocities are attained at the blade
tips. The model designed in this article is not too
different from General Electric’s model 3R-1.
Westinghouse research laboratories of Pittsburgh
have developed a model ram jet similar to the
model designed in this article. The Westinghouse
model ram jet is especially designed for illustrat-
ing a lecture or some similar presentation con-
cerning a ram jet power plant. All assumptions
made in this article for losses and efficiencies are
from those made by Westinghouse.

allow for variation in stock. The Vises are then
positioned by screwing the adjusting knobs in
until the stop collars hit solid. The large flanges
are located on the ring, which is at the exact
height from the base, and held in position by
clamps. Then the gun cradle is ready for tacking.

For convenience of production, each part is
given a number and a bin is located within easy
reach of the operator. This bin has all the parts
numbered and speeds the setup of the fixture. To
further speed operations, a stud head has been
tacked on the end of the adjusting knob, and a
speed wrench is used to tighten the knobs.

The fixture was designed for maximum opera-
tor efficiency and minimum possibility of human
error. The fixture is exact in operation, yet
simple to operate, an ideal fixture for fast, pre-
cise fabrication.

After the tacking of parts to the barrel, the
cradle is removed from the fixture and put into
a positioner for welding. The welding must be
done at the preheat temperature of 300-400 de-
grees farenheit, so some type of preheater was
necessary. The usual methods of preheating
were either too costly or too slow for the job, so
a new idea in preheating was devised. (Fig 3)

heaters could be plugged in and from then on
there was no worry about temperature. The bar-
rel can be heated‘ in 1 hour and 45 minutes, but if
not used, could be left connected as long as de-
sired. The wiring was done with stainless steel
strip on the heater and three-phase range-type
wire on the outside. This was grounded to pre-
vent accidents. —

The heater strips are mounted on three rings
and lightly tacked on the center ring. The hand-

giving the maximum surface contact for heat
conduction. The handle is inside the heater, al-
lowing the entire mechanism to be put inside the
cradle with only the wire coming out through the
opening in the end cap of the welding positioner.

The carts shown in Figure 3 are used while the
cradles are being heated, and provide easy move-
ment if desired. When the welder needs another
cradle, he merely puts the crane on the end cap
beari_ng and unplugs the heater. Then the heat-
er is plugged into a socket in the welding booth
and the cradle is mounted in the welding position-
er where the actual welding is done.

The welding positioner allows the complicated
gun cradle to be welded entirely in down-hand
position. Because of 360 degrees axial rotation
and 180 degrees rotation of the axis, the welder is
able to position for the easiest, fastest, and best
quality welds possible. The positioner is balanced
for hand rotation, and the bearings are split to
allow easy setup and take down. Just four bolts
hold the cradle in position. The end caps serve
a double purpose. The heat is held in and the
bearings hold it in place. There is no possible
way to put the cradle into the positioner wrong,
so once again the element of human error has
been all but eliminated. This positioner, although
simple in design has cut the welding time of the

. gun cradle by almost 50% from What was antici-

pated.

The actual welding of the cradle was a new
experience for many of the welders, because a
new type electrode was used. It is a lime-ferritic,
low-hydrogen rod, and is very difficult to use for
many reasons. It has a very short arc length,
which is hard to control. As compared to AWS
6010 or 6011, it does not form a gaseous envelope
around the metal at the arc tip. The average
voltage for AWS 6010 is 28-31 volts, and maxi-
mum voltage for the same size low-hydrogen rod
is 25 volts. If a higher voltage is used, low tensile
strength of the weld, porosity, ductility, and un-

der-bead cracking are the results. At low voltage,
a perfect slag coverage prevents porosity. If the
electrode coating is allowed to stand in open air,
it will absorb a great deal of moisture from the
air, and once again porosity, ductility, low ten-
sile strength, and underbead cracking occur. So
the electrode is kept in a dry room at 125 degrees
farenheit to prevent this. In the welding booths
the rod is kept in boxes which are heated by a
different type of Chromalox heater, and the tem-
perature is raised to 300 degrees farenheit. The
temperature of preheating eliminates “cold
starts”, which cause slag pockets and imperfec-
tions in the weld. All the electrodes used con-
form to army spec. mil-e986, which is standard
for this type of welding.

But before any welding can be done, every
welder must be qualified by the U. S. Army Ordi-
nance, since the job is done for the Army. To
qualify every welder makes three test specimens
according to specifications set up in a welding
booklet. This booklet shows every type, size, posi-
tion, and pass made by each welder on the gun
cradle. It gives the root opening of the weld;
the thickness of the base metal; physical and
chemical composition of metals and electrodes
used; voltage and amperage range in welding;
type of weld preparation; preheating; procedure
in weld; the thickness of the base metal; physical
and chemical composition of metals and electrodes
used; voltage and amperage range in welding;
type of weld preparation; preheating; procedure
in weld repair; and shows where every weld is
made. The booklet must be approved by all ordi-
nances concerned and must be exact to the most
minute detail.

When the booklet has been approved, the weld-
ers are allowed to take their tests. Their three
types of welds are then x-rayed by a qualified
x-ray opperator. If there are no defects on the
film, the welders are free to weld on the gun cra-
dles. But when the standards are not met, the
welder is permitted to take the test again. The
usual average for passing the first time is 50-
70%, yet by proper instruction by the superin-
tendent and by Very close supervision, the Ohio
Machine and Boiler Company qualified sixteen out
of sixteen in the first group and three out of three
in the second group. This 100% qualification
proves that shop instruction and supervision, if
given in the right way, can do more for the men
than undirected efforts.

In order that the welds can be x-rayed. the op-
erator, the machine, and the dark room must also
be approved by the U. S. Army Ordinance. This
qualification consists of an x-ray booklet, com-
parable to the welding booklet which must be ap-
proved, a list of dark room conditions as reported
by the Army inspector, and an approval of x-rays
taken at specified times and distances. This
booklet gives the ordnance a complete report of
how x-rays are taken, down to the type of film
and developer used, even as minutely detailed as
the temperature of the Water in the washing
basin.

From the description of the extensive booklets
and qualifications described above, it can be seen
that considerable man-hours are spent long be-
fore the first gun cradle is Welded. These tests
are necessary to insure the proper quality of work
which is essential. Poor work or defective parts

will result in loss of life, so the safety factor in
producing has to be insured. _ _

After welding is completed by the qualified
welders, the gun cradles are taken to a cleanup
bench, where a roller is mounted to aid in chip-
ping weld spatter and in cleaning the welds for
inspection. Here the welds are cleaned with an
air gun, brushed or ground in case of possible
flaw, and inspected to insure the proper quality
of weld. (Fig. 5) If any of the welds are defec-
tive, the cradle is sent back to be repaired. Then
it is recleaned and set on to the inspector.

The.» inspection jig is set up much the same as
the fixture for fabrication. A highly finished
circular plate is laid out to the exact dimensions
of the barrel and parts. Then small holes are
drilled to locate the various pointers which are
used to locate the parts. The inspector realizes
that a machining operation follows sand blasting
and annealing, so he can make slight allowances
for oversize parts. Since the fabrication is done
by an almost infallible fixture, the inspection is
merely a check on the fixture and the cradles are
usually accurate within plus or minus 1/32 of an
inch. For this reason there is very little rework
or scrap loss, an almost ideal situation in steel
fabrication.

The inspector’s approval sends the gun cradle
to be sand blasted and annealed. The sand blast-
ing takes off what the cleanup could not, and the
annealing furnace puts the final desired physical
properties in the metal and also relieves the
stresses in the barrel caused by welding. Since
there are more than twenty pounds of welding
rod deposited on each cradle, there is a consider-
able amount of residual stress. It was found by
test that the welding of the flanges alone pro-
duced a oval shaped barrel as much as 3/32 of an
inch out of round. This caused difficulty in ma-
chining, so the barrels are now being made with a
“flat side.” This is the side which the flanges
are on, and after welding the barrels are found
to be quite accurate.

After annealing, the barrels are then shipped
to be machined. They are shipped according to
the schedule set up when the contract was first
made. This schedule has held within a day or
two for all the operations described, and could
only have been done by careful, intelligent plan-
ning. When you consider that 31 parts had to be
burned, ground, inspected, tacked, welded,
chipped, inspected again, then sand blasted and
annealed, it is truly a wonder that the schedule is
as accurate as one or two days.

To aid in shipping the gun cradles a loading
platform was built which allows the carts shown
in Figure 6 to be wheeled in the trailer bed at the
ground level. This operation saved crane work
or physical labor of pushing a cradle up a ramp
and paid for itself in faster loading time. Since
some of the parts are easily bent out of line, a
wooden framework is now being used to hold the
cradles in a rigid upright position. This frame-
work can easily be dismantled, once again speed-
ing loading time and saving man-hours. Former-
ly the cradles were shipped in individual wooden
boxes, which cost over $20 to build and were added
weight on the truck, thus cutting the number of
cradles per truck load. So a great deal of money
was saved by using the framework.

When a semi-trailer pulls away from the shop

34

loaded with completed gun cradles, the thoughts
of the superintendent probably go back to the day
he first saw the blueprints of the gun cradle. He
remembers the hours spent estimating the job
from start to finish, the original shipment of steel
which arrived to make the fixture, without which
the job would have been almost impossible, and
the trouble he had trying to torch-cut a beveled
radius on the flanges. He thinks about the pro-
duction schedule which is only a day behind, the
hours spent in instructing his welders on the use
of low hydrogen rod, and of the work done in
qualifying the welders, the x-ray machine and
operator, and the welding and x-ray booklets.
Pondering over the preheating problem, he won-

- ders when the first heater unit will burn out. Was

it worth all the effort to make welding position-
ers, carts of two types, and cleaning bench rollers
to aid the men? -It is doubtful that the superin-
tendent realized what was in store for him when
his customer came to him that first day and
asked, “HoW much will this gun cradle cost and
when can you begin delivery?”

lid. The dessicator contains a material which
absorbs water from the air. Because of this ab-
sorbtion the test bars which were thoroughly
dried by the heating in the oven remain dry.
After the bars have cooled to room temperature
they are ready to be put into the tensile testing
machine.

Although it is not necessary to treat the tensile
test bar further after the conditioning process,
one very important step is necessary before the
bar is put into the tensile testing machine. The
section labeled “tensile test section” in Figure 1
must be measured to within 1/1000 of an inch
with a micrometer. The width and thickness are
measured at about midpoint along the length of
the tensile test section. After this is done, the
bar is placed in the tensile test machine. The
tensile testing machine may be thought of as two
Vises, one of which is firmly anchored, while the
other can be moved. The forces of the Vises have
the same rough ridges in them that a coarse file
has. This prevents the bar from slipping when
it is clamped into place. One end of the tensile
bar is clamped firmly to the stationary vise by
the section marked “clamping area” in Figure 1.
The stationary vise is anchored so that the test
piece is held in place vertically. Next, the mov-
able vise is raised up from its rest position below
the stationary vise and clamped to the other
“clamping area”. The lower vise is attached to
a cable which allows it to be pulled away from the
upper vise. The cable is attached to a motor
which is geared so that the lower vise is pulled
away from the upper one at a constant speed of
0.002 inch per minute. A large dial, calibrated in
pounds in the same way as a butcher’s scale is cal-
ibrated, records how many pounds pull there is on
the test piece. When the tensile piece breaks, the
number of pounds which were necessary to break
the piece are recorded. The tensile strength of
the plastic is then calculated by the formula:
Tensile Strength =

Pounds
Cross section area in square inches

How to mount

Type TNA Timken bearings areused at each end
of this press cylinder. The bearing at the left is
ﬁxed by clamping the double cup while the other
bearing is permitted to ﬂoat. The bearing cones
are clamped on the shaft by means of an end plate
and cap screws which are locked by wiring the
heads. The double cup for both bearings has a
groove and oil holes through which the lubricant
is supplied.

 

How to keep a

color press in the pink

Long-lasting precision and speed are necessary requirements
in single color offset press lithography. To meet these re-
quirements, engineers mount vital cylinder shafts and main
drive shafts of presses on Timken® tapered roller bearings.
Due to tapered construction, Timken bearings carry any
combination of radial and thrust loads—hold shafts in proper
alignment. And Timken bearings eliminate all speed restric-
tions due to bearings, permitting more impressions per hour.

In a typical sample of polystyrene, the following
data were recorded:
1. Width of tensile test section .501”
2. Thickness of tensile test section .127”
3. Pounds Force 407
The tensile strength of this sample of polystyrene
is calculated as follows:
Cross section area = width X thickness

or .501 inches x .127 inches
on .0636 square inches
Tensile strength 407 pounds _
.0636 square inches
or 6,400 pounds per square inch

With the information that the polystyrene plas-
tic used to make the toy has a tensile strength of
6,400 psi, the engineer is able to say how strong
the toy is. He is also able to decide just how
thick to make the various parts of it. If his cal-
culations show that no parts of the toy have to be
exceptionally thick to obtain the strength he
wants, he can be confident that he has selected
the correct plastic to be used in making the toy.

inch on the exhaust. If no clearance is left, the
Valve will not seat properly and will leak. When
an automobile is running at 50 miles per hour the
engine is running at about 2000 RPM. The
valves must open and close in 1/60 of a second.
When the cam makes contact with the tappet, it
hits the tappet at considerable speed. If too much
clearance is left, the valve will be noisy, wear will
be increased by the pounding of the cam on the
tappet, and the valves will not lift far enough.
The difference in temperature between a cold
engine and one that has been warmed up is con-
siderable. Since the push rods and valve stems
are not made of the same material as the engine
block and do not expand at the same rate, the
valve tappet clearance varies from a cold to a
warm engine. For ideal operation, then, the

valve tappets should be held at zero clearance
despite thermal expansion, but the Valves should
seat properly.

This operation is obtained by the hydraulic
Valve lifter which employs the incompressibility
of a liquid. Figure 5 shows the action of the
hydraulic valve lifter used on the 1937 Lincoln.
The spring d forces the plunger 0 against the end
of the push rod at taking up the clearance 19. When
the plunger moves, the piston e moves with it,
forcing oil to unseat the ball check valve g and
flow into the cylinder f. When the cam It begins
to lift the tappet, oil pressure causes the ball check
valve g to seat, trapping the oil in the cylinder f.
The valve is actually lifted on a column of oil, and
since oil can not be compressed, the valve is lifted
as far as possible.

Figure 5

There will be a certain amount of leakage be-
tween the plunger d and the cylinder g. This
leakage is necessary to provide clearance so that
the valve will seat properly and the hydraulic
valve lifter will repeat its cycle of action. The
unit can leak too much, however. The recom-
mended test for the unit shown is to raise the
valve 1/16 of an inch. If the valve seats within
30 seconds, the unit leaks too much and should
be replaced. The inlet ports are small, and can
be blocked by a small particle of dirt or rust.
Since oil from the crankcase is used, full flow oil
filtering is necessary when hydraulic lifters are
used. The cost of the hydraulic lifter due to the
close tolerances to which the plunger and cylin-
der must be held, restricts its use to high priced
automobiles. .

Even more expensive than the hydraulic valve
lifter is power steering. For many years power
steering was employed in off-the-road vehicles
used for heavy hauling. In such applications,
power steering was necessary. In 1951 power
steering made its first appearance.on the passen-
ger car when Chrysler announced its Hydraguide
system. _ _

The Hydraguide system employs the ability of
a fluid to transmit work. It consists of an oil
pump mounted behind the generator, a block_of
control valves, and a pair of power p1stons_which
are connected to the steering arm (see fig. 6).
When the steering wheel is turned counterclock-
wise to make a left turn, the spur gear connected
to the steering column tries to climb the spur gear
connected to the worm shaft. The flexible rub-
ber coupling allows the gear to climb a short dis-
tance, carrying the whole block of distribution

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

and reaction valves with it. Due to the movement
of the valve block, the upper valves remain closed,
but the left turn distribution valve and the right
turn reaction valve open. This action causes oil
from the pump to flow into the left power cylin-
der and out of the right power cylinder, thus
moving the steering arm.

If the system should fail to opeate for any rea-
son, or it becomes necessary to steer the car while
the engine is not running, steering is still possi-
ble. When the steering wheel is turned, the gear
begins to climb, the valves open, but the valve
block is soon stopped. The force applied to the
steering wheel is transmitted directly through
the gears, to the Worm, roller and steering shaft,
thus moving the steering arm. Although the car
can always be steered mechanically whenever
necessary, the hydraulic system does 90 per cent
of the work of steering.

The reduction in work is accompanied by a re-
duction in the steering ratio. Where 5 1/2 turns
of the steering wheel Were formerly required to
turn the front wheels from their extreme left to
their extreme right position, now only 3 1/ 2 turns
are required. In addition to the resulting reduc-
tion in driver fatigue, safety is further increased
by the greater resistance offered by power steer-
ing to ruts, chuck holes, and tire blowouts.

Thus, by a few applications of the principles of
fluid mechanics taught in TAM 63, some of the
most difficult problems that have arisen with the
development of the automobile have been simply
and satisfactorily solved. But the properties of
fluids mentioned here have their limitations, and
these limitations must be born in mind. Liquids,
for instance are said to be practically incom-
pressible. But liquids can be compressed if
enough pressure is applied. A shock absorber
has been developed using the compressibility of a
liquid as its principle of operation. A force ap-
plied to a fluid in a closed system is transmitted
equally in all directions only if the fluid is at rest.

cialties or options in their specific field. Since
the development in the early twenties, the Schools
of Engineering and of Mines have gradually de-
veloped to their present status.

Accreditation

The present status of the departments in the
schools is best exemplified by the fact that all are
accredited by the Engineers’ Council for Profes-
sional Development which is the only accrediting
body for engineering schools in the United States.
One of the most popular beliefs by individuals
not associated with the engineering profession is
that such schools are rated in decreasing order
of their excellence. This is not correct. In fact,
the only recognized rating which is given to en-
gineering schools is that of the Engineers’ Council
for Professional Development to the effect that
the department is either approved or not ap-
proved.

Engineering curricula throughout the country
are essentially the same. This is lagely true be-
cause the Engineers’ Council for Professional De-
velopment maintains certain standards in mathe-
matics, chemistry, physics, and other basic sci-
ences, as well as a minimum number of special
engineering courses which are deemed necessary
to an engineering education. In addition to this,
each engineering department emphasizes some-
what the specialties of the faculty members and
thus emphasis is placed on certain aspects of the
field.

Undergraduate Enrollment

Starting with the early thirties and develop-
ing through to the early forties, the Schools of
Engineering and Mines have grown steadily. For
example, in 1941 there were 926 students enrolled
in both schools—the largest enrollment was en-
countered in 1948 when there were 2343 students
enrolled in all courses. At the present time there
are 1056 students enrolled in the two schools, 841
of which are in the School of Engineering, and
215 in the School of Mines.

It is most gratifying at this time to see that
the students in the two schools have so much
spirit. A good example of the students’ morale
is the recent development of THE SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER. This magazine has been establish-
ed to operate along the lines of the professional
engineering magazines of other schools and the
contributions of the students which have been
published illustrate the excellent morale of the
students.

Other factors which can be used as indications
of the attitude of students at the present time is
that all of the student engineering societies are
active; the honorary fraternities, Sigma Tau, Eta
Kappa Nu, and Pi Tau Sigma and the profes-
sional fraternity, Sigma Gamma Epsilon are
active on the campus and are upholding stand-
ards which are excellent. In addition to this, the
Engineering and Mines Association has been
quite active in its social events this year.

Graduate Students

The graduate work of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines is developing at a rapid pace. In
fact, with a decrease in the undergraduate enroll-
ment, it appears that more attention will be paid
the large numbers of part and full-time graduate
students. At the present time there are 900 grad-
uate students enrolled in the Engineering and

38

Mines Schools, 522 of whom are in the Graduate
Work in Industry program.

In this program such companies as the West-
inghouse Electric Corporation, the Aluminum
Company of America, Philadelphia Company,
United States Steel Company, Gulf Research,
Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, and the Kop-
pers Company are cooperating currently. The
students attend some specialized courses taught
by company personnel and some courses are taken
on the campus. The thesis work is generally
done on the campus under facutly supervision.

Engineering Alumni

The record of the alumni of these schools is
also most gratifying. A review of the positions
held at present by various graduates of the Engi-
neering and Mines Schools indicates that they are
progressing normally as engineers and are assum-
ing positions of high level in industry. For ex-
ample, the Petroleum Engineering. Department
recently made a survey which indicated that there
are twelve presidents and vice—presidents of oil
companies among its graduates.

The Faculty

The faculty situation is most excellent. In
spite of the unprecedented number of industrial
opportunities, only five of the former staff mem-
bers left during the summer. Many engineering
schools suffered greater losses during this period.
Thee are now sixty full-time faculty members on
the staff of the two schools and it is most for-
tunate that the 125 per cent teaching load has
been discontinued. Also, it is planned to return
to a normal two-semester year and to discontinue
the accelerated summer program which was re-
quired during the period of high veteran enroll-
ment.

The Engineering Research Division

The Engineering Research Division at the Uni-
versity was established in 1941 as a charter
member of the Engineering College Research
Council, a division of the American Society for
Engineering Education. Some research projects
were developed over the years and recently the re-
search program has grown considerably. The
first large research project in this Division was
organized through the request of a cooperative
group of steel industries. This is now known as
the Acid Open Hearth Research Association, Inc.,
a corporation of Pennsylvania, and currently
consists of the following companies:

Atlantic Steel Casting Company
Continental Foundry & Machine Company
Erie Forge Company
Heppenstall Company
Mackintosh-Hemphill Company
Mesta Machine Company
The Midvale Company
Ohio Steel Foundry Company
Railway Steel Spring Division of

American Locomotive Company
John A. Roeblings Sons Company
Standard Steel Works Division of

Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation
United Engineering & Foundry Company
United States Steel Company

All of these companies are competitors in a
business way, yet they have joined together in a
cooperative research program at the University
for the purpose of solving some fundamental and

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

WHAT,S AN ENGINEER?

(Quoted from the November Edition, 1951 of the Power Magazine,
by Philip Swain, Editor)
Y ou can write your own ticket, but here’s my formula for a real

“engineer:

First he likes machinery. Almost certainly this trait showed up
while he was still a boy. He was hipped on tools and seeing the
wheels go round.

By long years of working with machines and reading and think-
ing about them, he has turned this mechanical birthright into a lot
of mechanical skills. He can handle almost any kind of tool or ma-
chine you could name.

Yet even all this mechanical know-how isn’t enough. As an
engineer, he is more than a good mechanic and machine operator.
His mind creates, invents, thinks up new gadgets and new hookups
to solve his new problems as they arise. And he can turn these bright
ideas into things that work.

This real engineer may not be good at higher mathematics, but
he does know how to use everyday arithmetic and geometry to get
sound answers to his practical engineering problems. He knows how
to figure tanks, weights, powers, pressures, efficiencies.

He knows the “line language” of mechanical drawing, can
handle drawing board and T-square to picture solid objects in three
views. He understands blueprints and can build from them. He
can talk to other engineers, and to mechanics, in the picture language
of freehand drawing.

Combining several of these talents, he can (with some occasion-
al outside help) design plants and hookups." He is able to supervise
their erection and- operation with a complete understanding of each
step.

This real engineer I am talking about has learned to think far
ahead. He has long since considered the new demands the future may
impose on him and how he might revamp hisplant to meet them.
Hle knows the improved equipment that could be worked into his
p ans.

In a personal sense this engineer looks ahead to the days when
he can grow step by step into a bigger job, so he is already learning
how to delegate responsibility without losing his grip on the throttle.

He is well aware that the world moves, that technology advances
and keeps getting more difficult. To keep pace he is always reading,
observing, conferring, thinking.

The real engineer I am talking about may be no expert account-
ant, but he understands operating forms, knows how to make esti-
mates and keep costs.

He may be no superman in the business world, but this real en-
gineer can organize his engineering office, keep proper files and
records, handle his everyday paper work without confusion. He
knows how to write acceptable business letters and how to draft re-
ports that bring action.

To deal effectively with management he has added a bit of
“front” to his technical talents. He can stand on his feet, state his
views in clear logical language. He acts, talks, thinks, and dresses
like a successful department head.

He has learned to deal tactfully with parallel department heads.
Even more important, he has learned the more difficult art of being
a sound boss by exercising leadership without being either a tyrant

‘ or a sucker.

In this last he wins respect by his practical understanding of
the job. Holding every man to_ a high standard of performance, he
is likewise a loyal and friendly member of the plant team, a respect-
er of individual rights———above all, a keeper of promises and a square
shooter.

He never holds good men down. Rather, he trains men to step
up to higher jobs, maybe even into his own job. Thus he is fair and
earns loyalty, also makes it possible for management to give him

Experience, they say,
 is the best teacher. But
you can avoid one pitfall if—
from the very start—your wir-
ing specifications call for
Sherarduct Rigid Steel Con-
duit. It has meant “perma-
nence” and “quality” to the
electrical trade for more than
40 years because it is proc-
essed to meet all the require-
ments of an outstanding
conduit.

 

Q It is made of Spellerized steel
for a ﬁne, even texture.

0 It is Sherardized by alloying
zinc to steel to_ give it rust-
resistance and life-long ro-
tection. Zinc is applie so
smoothly that even the threads
dre protected.

0 It is treated with Shera-Solu-
tion enamel to give it smooth
surfaces and acid-resistance.

You can always expect a
feather in your cap when you
specify the installation of
Sherarduct. It will “last as
long as the building stands.”

Sherarduct is but one of many
outstanding products made by
National Electric—a reliable
source of supply for any elec-
trical roughing-in materials
that you might need.

common problems. They have been engaged in
this program for a period of eight years at a total
expenditure of more than $150,000.

During the war period there were a number of
Government projects in the Engineering Research
Division and, at the present time, the contracted
research projects are Acid Open Hearth Research
Association, Inc., Navy Bureau of Ships (ship
plate steel), Navy Bureau of Ordnance (electric
equipment), and Navy Bureau of Aeronautics.
The total contracted research currently amounts
to about $142,000 per year.

There are now some twenty-five people engaged
in research work on the projects listed above and,
in addition, each department has special investi-
gations under way.

Engineering Laboratories

Because of their many and increased activities,
the greatest need of the Engineering and Mines
Schools at the present time is adequate space for
such facilities as laboratories and offices. It is
hoped that within the next few years some de-
finite improvements in space will be made because
the current facilities undoubtedly are inadequate
for the activities which are now under way.

Advantages Of Our Engineering And Mines
Schools At The University Of Pittsburgh

There are many advantages in the Engineering
and Mines Schools at Pitt. Some of these may be
well worth recounting. In the first place these
schools are a part of a great university. This is
a distinct advantage in that it permits the stu-
dents of the Engineering and Mines Schools to
take elective courses from many other branches
of the University such as in The College and the
School of Business Administration. This is an
advantage which is not enjoyed by engineering
schools which are not associated with a univer-
sity with its many divisions. In this respect the
University of Pittsburgh is probably similar to
the mid-western state colleges.

Another advantage of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines at Pitt is its location. Here in the
heart of one of the greatest engineering centers
of the world, the University of Pittsburgh has the
excellent association and cooperation of many of
the industries in this district. Lecturers from in-
dustry may be obtained with ease to discuss mat-
ters of an engineering nature with our students.
Similarly, it is easy to arrange plant trips.

With the City of Pittsburgh progressing as it
is today, the future of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines at Pitt will be exemplified by increas-
ed usefulness to this district. A recent survey of
the undergraduate students indicated that some
ninety-five per cent are from the Pittsburgh area
and that some eighty-five percent remain in Pitts-
burgh after graduation. This is typical of the
service which has been rendered by the Schools
to the industries in this area.

_In the view of the above statements, it is ob-
v1ous that considerable advancements have taken
place over the years in the Schools of Engineering
and Mines at the University. Continued growth
1s to be expected and the future appears most

promising.

than a “Get ’em if you want ’em” approach.

Unsafe acts committed by workers due to ig-
norance may be corrected by proper training, but
what of those committed knowingly? Improper
attitude and sometimes even physical or mental
defects are the causes. Usually a private talk
with the offender will determine which of these is
responsible. Often improper attitudes can be
tactfully but firmly corrected. In cases where
they cannot, transfer or dismissal is indicated.
When an experienced employee steps out of line
just once, a remark such as “Bill, take it easy—-
you don’t want to miss J unior’s graduation!” will
not only have the desired effect, but will give the
foreman (and management) a reputation for be-
ing interested in a good safety record chiefly be-
cause it is good for the men themselves. Any
reference to safety that carries a personal mean-
ing to the employee involved will be much more
effective than one which stresses loyalty to the
company’s cost reduction program.

During his tours through the shop the foreman
is in an excellent position to spot potential haz-
ards and correct them or arrange for their cor-
rection. Losely piled lumber or boxes, nails pro-
truding from loose boards, hand trucks left near
blind corners, tools in poor condition, and worn
or defective electrical equipment are just a few
of the conditions that are easy to see when a fore-
man is safety-conscious.

Finally, when an accident occurs, prompt in-
vestigation and accurate reporting are second in
importance only to rendering suitable aid to the
man involved. The foreman should make his
report in conjunction with the safety engineer.
This report should be directed toward determin-
ing the causes of the accident and preventing its
recurrence, rather than fixing the blame. Need-
less to say, if an unsafe mechanical cause, such
as defective machinery is involved, no one should
be allowed to work on the job until repairs have
been satisfactorily made.

Industrial injuries hurt everyone, not only in
the worker’s physical suffering, disability, or
death, but in the staggering financial burden they
impose on all levels of our society. Management’s
realization of its responsibility for the safety of
workers is the starting point for the crusade
against accidents. It should be understood, how-
ever, that the foreman is the key man in any in-
dustrial safety program. His interest, his initia-
tive, and his leadership must be developed and
utilized before even the best staffed and highest
budgeted safety department can begin to do its
work effectively.

Behind Every Success There’s

PLANNING

by H. V. FULLER, Supt. Time Study and Planning Dept.

General Machinery Division, ALLIS-CHALMERS MANUFACTURING COMPANY (Graduate Training Course 1939)

PLANNING is an important part of man-
ufacturing machinery—and of build-
ing a career, too. This planning, however,
must be based on information and ex-
perience. You don’t always have all the
facts about industry that you need at the
time you leave engineering school and
start planning your own future. At least,
that’s the way it was with me when I got
my degree in Mechanical Engineering at
University of Wisconsin in 1936.

New 30-ft. boring mill now operating in Allis-Chalmers’ West Allis shops. It supplements

engineering drawings and material speciﬁ-
cations. And from this data we plan the
sequence of manufacturing operations-
determine the equipment and tooling
required, and set up time standards for
each operation.

You can get some idea of the volume
of work from the fact that our West Allis
Machinery Division shops ship an aver-
age of eight million pounds of ﬁnished
machinery per month—representing a

older, slower 40 ft. mill, and greatly increases capacity on big, heavy work. Both mills are
scheduled practically around the clock, seven days a week.

I took a job with a big manufacturer,
but within a year the work I was doing
ended, and my employers referred me to
the Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training
Course. I enrolled in 1937—and then my
knowledge of industry really began to
grow. There was the usual round of the
p1ant——shops, ofﬁces , various departments
—where I saw a wide range of work at
first hand. I worked with steam turbines,
pump testing, and on the electrical test
ﬂoor. About half way through the two-
year course I got really interested in the
manufacturing side of the business. After
four months of plant layout work I went
to the Time Study and Planning Depart-
ment, and ﬁnished out my course there in
1939. In 1945 I became Superintendent.

This Is the Starting Point

In this department we really start the
manufacturing operation. We’re given the

range of products from small V-belt
sheaves to massive crushers, steam and
hydraulic turbo-generating units, cement
kilns, sewage pumps, motors, flour mills,
and power transformers.

Look Before You Decide

As a Graduate Training Course engineer
here you may become interested in manu-
facturing. There’s a great need for trained
engineers in this work. Or, you may ﬁnd
your interest lies in some other ﬁeld-
designing, research, sales, personnel, ser-
vice and erection. In any case, theGraduate
Training Course gives you a chance to
look them all over, gain practical ﬁrst-
hand experience, plan your career on a
sound basis of knowledge.

Do Your Own Planning

The course is ﬂexible—you help plan it
yourself and can change it as new interests
or opportunities develop. There’s no other
spot in industry that offers such a wide
range of experience—so many choices for
a career. ‘

If you want to get further details as to
qualiﬁcations, salary and operation of
the course, get in touch with any Allis-
Chalmers district ofﬁce. Probably the
manager was a G T C himself. Or, write
for literature.

SOLUTION . . .

. . . “cold rubber,” the latest type
of synthetic rubber made by
Hercules customers, which has
superior wearing qualities. Its
name comes from the unusually
low temperature of 41 deg. F. at
which it is made. Special catalysts
were needed for this “cold rubber”
and Hercules had the answer ready
with its hydroperoxides. These
chemical catalysts initiate the
polymerization of the two basic
components of “cold rubber”-
butadiene and styrene.

This is but one example of the
far-reaching chemical develop-
ments in which you could partici-
pate at Hercules—in research,

tions. It suggests the Ways Her-
cules’ products serve an ever-
broadening range of industries
and end-uses.

Hercules’ Business is solving problems by chemistry for industry...

TRADE-MARK

We conducted a po||*of ’41 graduates to find out: 

HOW HAVE THEY MADE out IN

10 YEARS WITH GENERALELECTRIC?  

Here are the results: i

1. TRAINING. On the average, college_- graduates who
came with General" Electric in 194-] have taken between

three and four Company-run training courses. Some have"

taken as many as seven. These have included courses in '

businessmanagement and accounting, in sales, manufac-

turing, and in many phases of engineering. Graduates re-

‘ port that this training has been a big help in furthering

their careers. As one expressed itz,"-These courses are

essential to certain ﬁelds of endeavor———so essential I am i

still signing up for additional courses."

Other comments: "These programs are not the purely
academic ones of school days. They are practical, interest-

_ ing, enable one to do a better job and enjoy. it more.”
if "The G-E Sales Training Program was deﬁnitely instru-

mental in helpingime ﬁnd my present position.” The train-
ing programs have been a very essential link betwee;i3cny
college training and my present work.” "I wish I hould

- have known then how val_uable these courses were going

to be later.” "They conﬁrmed my original opinion that

»G.'E. offered the best training for engineers.”

2. EXPERIENCE. These graduates have had an average
of three’ different rotating assignments in various phases
of the Company’s work. A typical example included assign-
ments in radio test,  motors and generators, and in the
industrial control development laboratory. Graduates ex-

press three ‘main beneﬁts derived from the G-El rotational .

job programs :’ _
a. They provided opportunities_ for deciding on a deﬁ-
nite ﬁeld of interest. Typical comment: "I didn’t know
what kind of work I wanted to do. Rotating assignments

helped me make up my mind." p 7

This is a Torrington Needle Bearing

Designed for Today’s Needs and Toniowon/s Trends-—

Needle Bearings Oﬁer A Unique Combination of Advantages

The Torrington Needle Bearing has
two component parts—the full com-
plement of relatively small diameter,
thru—hardened, precision-ground
rollers and a case hardened retain-
ing shell by which they are held.

The bearing is a complete unit in
itself, and is easily pressed into posi-
tion in a bore machined to proper
dimensions. The advantages of this
unit construction in simplifying in-
stallation and speeding assembly
are readily apparent.

High Radial Capacity

Of special importance is the high
capacity of the Torrington Needle
Bearing. This eﬂicient anti-friction
unit can carry a greater radial load
than any other bearing of compar-
able outside diameter due to the
large number of rollers. The small
cross section of the bearing allows a
large shaft which permits a rigid de-
sign with minimum shaft deﬂection.

Eﬁicient I/abrication -

The method of lubrication is an-
other feature of the Torrington
Needle Bearing. The retaining shell

JANUARY, 1952

with its turned-in lips provides a
natural reservoir for the lubricant.
Thus the needle rollers turn in an
oil or grease bath and continually
bring up a fresh ﬁlm of lubricant-
insuring rotation of all moving
members on a ﬂuid ﬁlm.

Low Cost

The size of the Torrington Needle
Bearing, coupled with the simplicity
of its construction, makes it a com-
paratively inexpensive anti-friction
unit. Its compact size encourages
simpliﬁed design which requires less
material in surrounding compon-
ents. This also contributes to further
cost reductions.

The shaft serves as the inner race
in the majority of Needle Bearing
applications and therefore should

be hardened and ground to proper
dimensions. However, where it is de-
sirable to use an unhardened shaft,
an inner race can be supplied.

For M odern Design

Where the efficiency of anti-friction
operation is desired, and where
space, weight and cost are vitally
important considerations, Needle
Bearings provide a logical answer.
That’s why you will find them
used in an ever-growing list of
applications.

This is one of a series of adver-
tisements designed to give you the
latest engineering information on
Needle Bearings. Should you have
occasion to work with bearing de-
sign or wish more information,write

INK FROM THE EDITOR'S PEN

F or us students, there is no better time than
now for some thoughtful planning and per-
sonal evaluations.

Happiness is not doing what you like to do, but
liking what you have to do. Every young engin-
eer can, with some careful thought, prevent him-
self from becoming a misfit, a “round peg in a
square hole”.

No one can successfully catalog his life, plan-
ing each move and having his plans materialize
exactly as he would wish. To a limited extent,
however, it is possible to make the adjustments
rdiecessary to enable us to “like what we have to

0.7}

During the neophite engineer’s college years
he has the gift of youth when changes are easier
to adopt, and the balance of time is still in his
favor. In later years new beginnings are diffi-
cult. If a man finds himself in a position where
he can’t bring himself to like what has to be done,
he becomes, at best, a clock watcher whose days
of drudgery are dragged slowly -around the hour
hand. In this state of mind a man is a loss to the
profession and surely a loss to himself.

Honest self-evaluation is a first hand means of
avoiding an occupational rut. When a student
has completed his prescribed university course he

should be able to decide for himself whether he is .

sound enough technically to enter research or de-
velopment; whether he has exhibited the leader-
ship which qualifies him for management; wheth-
er he is the befriending extrovert required in
sales or personnel work. Each of us has some in-
herent qualities which are more adaptable to a

particular branch of the engineering profession.
After appraising his traits and qualifications, 3.
student may plan to accept the job to which he is
best suited.

Once the decisions are made he cannot close
his eyes to obvious opportunities in other branches
of the profession or in other fields. An engin-
eering background is an excellent preparation for
many lines of work. The important point is that,
through self evaluation, the student decides not
only what he would enjoy doing but also what he
is best prepared to do. This evaluation should
govern his reasoning when jobs in other fields
appear easier or more lucrative.

Granted, starting salaries in engineering work
are not impressive, but if a man permits salary
alone to woo him into a position where he will not
be satisfied or for which he is not adapted, he is
obviously in error. What gratification will a high
salary bring him? Specifically, salary is the im-
mediate and most obvious problem at hand.
Nevertheless the hidden problems brought about
by looking to future opportunities, security, and
the possibilities for personal growth and develop-
ment must also be considered. A decision must
then be made, based on sound judgment, which
will assure the young engineer of satisfactorily
placement in pursuits which will net him the max-
imum return for his efforts so he may be proud
of his work and happy while doing it.

Lionel uses Crucible Alnico in new
locomotive design

The Lionel Corporation, big name electrical toy manufacturer,
has pioneered in the design of miniature locomotives for
table-top railroading. One of theprincipal aims of this design
is to achieve the highest possible degree of adhesion between
the driving wheels and the track.

Lionel experimented with a conventional method of increas-
ing the traction (i.e. load up the driving axles with ballast
weights) . . . and then turned to magnetic materials.

Crucible alnico specialists were called in. Working in
close cooperation with Lionel engineers, the Lionel “Magne-
Traction” locomotive was born. As the name implies, “Magne-
Traction” utilizes magnetic attraction between powerful
Crucible alnico bar magnets placed in close proximity with
the wheels.

By varying the number and strength of the magnets,
almost any desired degree of adhesion can be obtained.
In laboratory tests a light-weight plastic “Scout” loco-
motive whose normal train load is 4 cars, was able, after
installation of proper magnets, to pull a train of 24 cars,
an improvement of 600%. A heavy miniature locomotive

pulled 28 cars instead of its usual load of 7 cars. Then
too, locomotives unable to start a normal 4 or 5 car
train on greater than 1 degree slope were able with the
special magnet assembly to pull them from a dead start
up a 5° slope, while the new twin-motor Lionel Pennsy
CG-1 scooted up a 15° slope (i.e. 37% grade) without
any apparent difficulty.

Crucible’s part was twofold. Not only were Crucible
metallurgists and engineers active in the initial design,
but Crucible production experts precision cast these bar
magnets using plastic patterns. This is an innovation in
alnico magnet mass production. Commonly, alnico is
made in sand molds, and usually requires a great deal of
ﬁnishing, but with precision-cast alnico magnets expen-
sive machining is cut to a minimum.
