On the cover

The theme of this year’s Engineers’ Week was fairy tales and legends. These
stained glass windows, located in the German nationality room in the
Cathedral of Learning, portray the characters of the Germanic folk tales
”Hansel and Gretel,” and ”Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.” The latter
story was the theme of the Chemical Engineering Department for this year’s
Engineers’ week.

The Universal Engineering

Skill:

Communication

by Mark McKreII
and LuAnne Schmidt

An inability to effectively use language to communicate
has become as much a part of an engineer's stereotype as
greasy hair, black socks, and a calculator strapped to the belt.
Many people feel engineers are so technically oriented that
they are not understandable. This description overlooks the
importance of communication for an engineer. Mr. Charles
Aveni, Director of Student Affairs, has estimated that an
engineer spends up to seventy percent of his time com-
municating. This leaves just thirty percent of his time to apply
engineering skills. A successful engineer has to be able to
communicate his thoughts, opinions, and work progress. Ad-
vancement in an engineering field can't be accomplished
without proper communication skills.

Oral communication is used everyday by engineers. This
ranges from a brief conversation with the boss to a presenta-
tion for colleagues and management. When an engineer's
supervisor checks on him, he needs to be able to respond
concisely. A thorough, but brief, response lets the boss know
exactly what has been done and when he can expect the
work to be finished. The staff member benefits from this ex-
change in that his boss can give advice and help correct prob-
lems that may arise.

An engineer also needs to express himself to his
coworkers in order to maximize his effectiveness in group
projects. The ability to accomplish a portion of a large job
is only part of a group member's responsibilities. An engineer
must be able to communicate what he has done to other
members of a group so that they can use and build on his
work.

Listening is an often overlooked but extremely impor-
tant communication skill. A person who can interpret the
proper context of another’s remarks can use that informa-
tion to his own benefit. The knowledge can be used in several
ways. One is to use the work of others as a supplement to
assigned work. Another is to learn new techniques and
methods which can be put into practice in job execution.
Good listening skills are imperative for those holding
managerial positions. A supervisor can evaluate an
employee's performance from the oral progress briefings of
the employee. At a business conference, a manager who is
a good listener can learn ways of making his department
more productive.

Reading is another skill an engineer needs to be profi-
cient in. An engineer can use articles written in his field of
expertise to aid his work. Management uses reading skills
more than a staff engineer. The majority of written reports

Dr. Allias’ students are exposed to poor speech habits in
order to correct and improve their communication skills.

go to management. Managers receive from these reports a
knowledge of what their people are doing, and they are then
able to critique the performance of their personnel.

Writing is a necessary skill for the engineer as well.
Writing is required in many forms. One of these is a short
composition to issue orders, directives, and various other in-
formation. These compositions take the form of small memos,
corporate letters, and day~to-day progress reports. Engineers
can also be called upon to file for a copyright for a particular
invention. A good composition is very brief, but it still con-
tains the essentials. This makes the writing easily understand-
able to those who will be reading it.

Engineers aspiring to positions of management will use
nearly every form of communication discussed so far. Super-
visors review reports, negotiate departmental budgets, and
report on the performance of personnel. If a department
receives defective equipment, the manager is responsible for
remedying the situation. This would require a letter of com-
plaint or a phone call to register displeasure. Managers also
issue memos which inform the employees of meetings,
changes in company policy, revised working -hours,
company-recognized holidays, and other such matters.

Managers may also need to write letters to those people who
use their equipment. This requires a working knowledge of
departmental projects. It also requires the ability to describe
the function of the equipment without confusing the reader
with technical jargon. Obviously, those not in management
need these skills as well. A busy supervisor will at times need
to delegate some of these responsibilities to his employees.

In many cases, communication skills are important
because of differences in style. Computer programs, for ex-
ample, can be accomplished in many different ways. There
will be differences in programs which are only a matter of
style. Good communication can keep this from resulting in
a problem for engineers who are working as a group. Dif-
ferences in style occur in many design processes. Good com-
munication can often blend ideas and result in a more effi-
cient design.

Some sectors of industry hire people for the specific task
of technical writing. Some companies use their most ex-
pressive engineers for writing reports and short papers. But
how does one get to be a technical writer? The background
is a combination of technical courses and writing courses.
The technical background varies somewhat depending on
what type of discipline the company one wants to work for
specializes in. A good background includes calculus,
chemistry, and physics. Other courses which are helpful in
getting a basic understanding of physical principles are ther-
modynamics and solid mechanics. An engineering degree
with a good writing background is very inviting to a poten-
tial employer. Fluency in other languages is also helpful
because many companies operate in the world market and
need translation into and out of foreign languages.

Since communication skills are so essential to an
engineer, programs have been designed to develop these
skills. At the corporate level, employers sponsor seminars
to develop the communication skills of their employees with
the intention of thereby improving task execution. Univer-
sities also have begun to recognize the need for such skills,
and many universities now offer courses in technical
communications.

The University of Pittsburgh has offered courses in
technical communication for more than 35 years. These
classes originated in the English department in the early
1940's, under the direction of W. George Crouch, chairman
of the English Department who later became secretary of the
university. They are now offered in the School of Engineer-
ing. Only two departments require a technical communica-
tion course for completion of a bachelor's degree, the In-
dustrial Engineering and Mining Engineering departments.
For a student in any other department, the classes are
available as technical electives.

Engineers are also called on to write large reports for
management and coworkers and at times for consumers.
These reports are often difficult to write because one person
probably hasn't done all the work in a group project. This
might cause some ambiguity in his understanding of the
whole project. Another problem arises in the necessity to
make a highly technological project understandable to those
unskilled in that particular field. The first problem is relatively
easy to solve. Help from coworkers can overcome difficulties

in this area. The second problem isn't as easily remedied.
The best way to start attacking this problem is to eliminate
as much material as possible while still accomplishing the
purpose of the report. One method used to solve this prob-
lem is to consult previous work done on similar projects to
see how the material was presented. Another method is to
examine dissertation abstracts which can be found in most
large libraries. These show methods of converting technical
language into more common language.

Most people have seen examples of technical writing,
even though they may not have realized it at the time. The
instruction booklet that accompanied your calculator or
stereo system is an example of technical writing. Someone
had to understand the function of the calculator or stereo
system and then explain it in simple terms so that the average
person could understand its function. This type of writing
can be done in very large proportions as well. Suppose a
company sells a generator which will be used over a huge
region. Explaining the function and intricacies of something
of this magnitude requires the writing of a manual which may
consist of more than one volume. When dealing with inter-
national companies, it is often necessary to translate these
manuals into other languages. This is another necessary
aspect of technical writing.

There are many other modes of communication which
have become increasingly popular in our high technology
society. One widely—used and easily applicable method of
oral communication is the telephone. One can set up
meetings, transact business, and exchange ideas without ever
leaving his chair. Videotapes are also being widely used. A
presentation on videotape is much more personable than a
written report. The use of telecommunications is also increas-
ing. Telecommunications allow business conferences to be
held without requiring those in attendance to travel to a cen-
tral location. Computers provide a different mode of sending
written information. Also, writing large reports can be made
easier if an engineer is skilled in using a word processor. The
engineer who can easily adapt to new communication
technologies and use them to his advantage is likely to be
a successful engineer.

The engineer who is a strong communicator is usually
successful for several reasons. First, he is relaxed and confi-
dent with his subject. He makes his main points extremely
obvious so as not to create any confusion in the minds of
his audience. Brevity is also important so as not to lose one’s
audience. The use of visual aids helps the audience to see
the key points. Suppose one is designing a support structure
for a bridge. The ability to incorporate visual aids in a talk
greatly enchances the presentation. Allowing the audience
to see drawings of the bridge in consecutive stages of
development would help them to understand how it will
function. In certain presentations, graphs and equations can
enhance the understanding of the audience.

Dr. Marcus Allias, who received a B.A. in English and
an M.A. and Ph.D. in Administration from the University of
Pittsburgh, teaches a course entitled Communication Skills
for Engineers. With a text, current handouts, a series of films,
videotape recorders, and a telephone, Dr. Allias exposes his
students to virtually all phases of technical communications.

Dr. Allias requires his students to write many forms of
technical correspondence such as memos, letters, com-
parison reports, and short papers. Specifically, this could in-
clude a letter of complaint about a piece of malfunctioning
equipment or a report comparing two stereo systems.

A portion of the class time is devoted to a series offilms
from the Bureau of National Affairs Communications Course.
These ten films are topics like perception, how to com-
municate with the boss, how to use a group to solve prob-
lems, and how to prevent communication mix-ups. Each film
is coordinated with two handouts. The first handout is
distributed the week before the film is to be shown, and it
gives an overview of the film including an introduction, ob-
jectives, and key points. The second handout, which con-
tains questions, is distributed on the day that the film is
shown, and the questions are to be answered by each stu-
dent immediately after the film is shown. With this learning
device, a student receives information about communications
and, at the same time, is required to practice listening skills.
This situation simulates a business meeting where, having
been given an agenda previously, the businessman must
listen closely to extract the information which he needs.

In developing oral communication, Dr. Allias and his
students are aided by videotape recorders in Hillman
Library's Media Center. The students prepare five-minute oral
presentations which they give in front of the videotape
camera. Each student can watch himself present his topic
immediately after the taping session, and he may then retape
his speech if he is not satisfied with his performance. Dr.
Allias’s evaluations on the set of tapings are returned to the
students the following week.

Another unique aspect of this class is that two or three
times a term Dr. Allias contacts each student by telephone
to discuss the progress which that student is making. In ad-
dition to involving each student individually, this tactic gives
the student an opportunity to practice using the telephone
as means of business-like communication, in this case com-
municating a progress report.

Communications Skills for Engineers also provides some
insight into non-verbal communications known as body
language. This includes such actions as nervously wringing
one’s hands or impatiently drumming one’s fingers. in addi-
tion, the class examines communications barriers and prac-
tices good job—interviewing techniques.

A course at the University of Pittsburgh which delves
more deeply into the written aspect of technical communica-
tions is taught by Mr. Michael DeMarco who is a senior
member and Associate Fellow of the Society for Technical
Communications. DeMarco received both his B.A. in
Political Science and Economics and his M.A. in English from
the University of Pittsburgh. The course he teaches is Com-
munication Skills for Engineering Management. As a course
aimed at management, it is a graduate level course, and many
of the students enrolled in the class are currently working
in industry. The course is, however, open to undergraduates
as a technical elective.

The content of the course varies with the needs of the
students. The range of topics includes memos, letters,
abstracts, journals articles, oral presentations, major profes-

Mr. Michael DeMarco gives his class an in depth view of
the written report of technical communications.

sional reports, and instruction manuals. The class uses films
and audio—visual materials as well as scientific journals,
books, and research documents. The class studies and
reviews case histories from business, government, and
research organizations in addition to discussing related ex-
periences that members of the class have had. In conjunc-
tion with the forms of technical writing in the curriculum,
the standards required for a professional publication are
discussed. The course may also examine copyrights, patents,
data protection of classified material, and the legal and ethical
responsibilities connected with these aspects of technical
writing. Technical writing skills are especially important to
anyone in engineering management because all written
reports will be reviewed by the manager. After being re-
viewed and sent on, the manager is responsible for any er-
rors in the report.

There are two aspects of technical writing which are
stressed in this course, regardless of the form that any given
documentation will take. The first is the thinking-writing pro-
cess. It has been stated that most of the time needed to write
a paper should be spent in the researching and thinking
phases and that a smaller amount of time should be required
for the physical writing of the paper. The second universal
aspect of technical writing is writer—reader rapport. The writer
should always keep in mind for whom his project is under-
taken. If it is written for the technical community, most details
should be included. If it is written for management, un-
necessary details should not be included since management's
time is limited. if it is written for the consumer, unnecessary
technical terms should be avoided since such language could
cause confusion.

Communication is a necessary skill in almost any field.
For engineers, the ability to communicate clearly about
technical issues is imperative for success. In order for an
engineer to develop to his fullest professional potential, it
is necessary for him to actively cultivate and practice
technical communication skills.

Another part of Engineer’s Week is the

;  bringing together of the sophomores, juniors,
and seniors of each department. It is a chance
for them to get to know people with whom
they normally wouldn ’t come in contact. The
departments are in competition against each
other, and thus each individual one tends to
be drawn together. Everyone has a chance to
put away his books and his class identity to
work on a common pursuit. They can focus
on the idea of beating the Chem E ’s and the
IE ’s, or whoever has done well in the past.

The most important part of Engineers’
Week, perhaps, is the memories that are alive
long after the ﬂoats and costumes are put
away. Each department keeps a display that
holds the ribbons and pictures from past
years’ events. Listening to the stories about
them can often be as much fun as the events
themselves. These are the rememberances of

He found the class very exhuberating, but he was so excited
that he couldn't pay attention. He began reading the posters
on the bulletin board and the notices on the front wall. Of
the words on the two identical messages located near the
top of the front wall, what is the median number of letters?

 

(2) Valerie Jachimowicz, Dr. Simaan, and M Cubed
decide to play a three person game of monopoly. They
stipulate that no trading is allowed. If Valerie rolls first, Dr.
Simaan rolls second, and M Cubed rolls third, find the
minimum number of turns Dr. Simaan could take for him

February's twenty—five dollar Skycaper prize was won
by the team effort of three freshman engineering students.
The winning entry, with four correct answers was submit-
ted by Darryl Breitenstein, John Gargani and Joseph E. Smith.
The Skyscraper staff also commends David Tobin, whose en-
try, although received later than the winning entry, also con-
tained four correct answers. The solutions to the February
Skycaper are as follows:

(1) An enumeration of all possible combinations of
coins, beginning with two quarters and eight pennies and
ending with fifty—eight pennies, leads to the answer of fifty-
five possible combinations.

(2) The total weight of the three moles is 1.0794 +
1.4206 + 1.5 = 4.0000 pounds. Since the data in the ques-
tion are given to five significant figures, a value of 18.015
grams/mole water should be used. George's portion of water
is therefore 1.5/4.0 x 18.015 grams = 6.7556 grams of water
= 6755.6 milligrams. (Answers ranging from 6755 to 6756
were accepted as correct.)

 

(3) 2, 6, 22, 66, 242, 746, __j_

This is a geometric series with the multiplicative constant
equal to three. The numbers, however, are octal. (base eight),
not decimal. 7468 = 48610, then the next term is 3 x 486
= 145810 = 26623. (Many people arrived at the correct
answer of 2662 by observing that 2 x 11 = 22, 22 x 11 =
242, so 242 x 11 = 2662. It was also noted that 6 x 11 =
66 and 66 X 11 = 726. The number 746 was not a
typographical error.)

(4) The correct answer is zero, or close to zero. A wir
screen can hold no water. '

(5) The probability of a man having a mustache is 1/3
and of a man having a beard is 1/7. Therefore the probabili-
ty of having both is 1/3 x 1/7 = 1/21. (Assuming beards and
mustaches occur as independent events in the population
of men.) Thus, the probability of a man having only a
mustache is 1/3 - 1/21 = 6/21 and of a man having only
a beard is 1/7 — 1/21 = 2/21. The probability of a man hav-
ing either a mustache or a beard of both is 1/21 + 6/21 +
2/21 = 9/21 = 3/7. The condition of having both a mustache
and a beard was not excluded from the problem. There is
a 1/2 probability of a person being a man, so the probability
that three people at the bus stop are all men and all have
either beards or mustaches is (1/2 x 3/7)3 = (3/14)3 = ap-
proximately 0.00984.

Teach a robot
the facts of life.

There was a time when most
robots earned their livelihoods
in comic books and science
fiction films.

Today, they're spraying,
welding, painting, and process-
ing parts at manufacturing
plants around the world.

Necessity has caused this
amazing leap from fantasy to
factory.

The world wants long—lasting,
high quality products, now.
And robots fit perfectly into this

‘ scheme of things: They can

make those products — quickly,
easily and accurately.

What kinds of robots? There
is GE's Allegro,” for one.

It can position a part to within
1/1000th of an inch — or about ‘/4
the thickness of the paper this
article is printed on. Or there's
GP 132 (shown here). This
loader, unloader, packer,
stacker and welder —can lift
and maneuver 132 pounds with
no trouble at all.

So what's left for me to teach
robots? You might ask. Consid-
er this glimpse into the future
by Dr. Roland W. Schmitt, head
of GE corporate research and
development:

"One of the big frontiers
ahead of us is putting the
robot's nervous system
together with some senses —

like vision, or touch, or the abil-
ity to sense heat or cold. That
can give you an adaptive robot,
one that can sense how well it's
doing its job and make the
adjustments needed to do that
job better."

That's a tall order. And one
we'll be expecting you to fill.
With foresight, talent, imagina-
tion —all the things that robots
have yet to learn.

 

WE BRING GOOD THINGS TO LIFE

An equal opportunity emp/oyer.
