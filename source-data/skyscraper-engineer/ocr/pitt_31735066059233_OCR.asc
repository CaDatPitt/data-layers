More power to the chemical industry-engineered byyou


The American chemical industry's enor-
mous growth over the past decade and
a half has opened seemingly insatiable
markets for electrical creativity. Elec-
trochemistry, as practiced at the Colum-
bia-Southern Chemical Corporation, is
particularly sensitive to developments
in power facility design and other appli-
cations of electrical engineering...
machinery, circuits and equipment.
  Let's look first at some of the fasci-
nating areas that will stimulate your
finest thinking. The world's leading
merchant producer of chlorine, Colum-
bia-Southern pioneered in control en-
gineering for electrolytic production of
commodity chemicals.
  The various demands of our modern
chemical installations draw electrical


engineers of all specialized leanings into
new and pilot construction planning at
the earliest stages..Light, power, basic
instrumentation, communications... in
developing fresh, better answers you'll
work with outside vendors and engi-
neering experts, pooling your plant ex-
perience with their know-how in apply-
ing ideas and equipment to the practical
production of many vital chemicals.
  Recognition follows achievement
with refreshing speed. A "standardized
program," like standardized thinking,
has never been a Columbia-Southern
habit. Assignments are carefully worked
out between you and interested man-
agement supervisors, to help you win
and exercise responsibility in the short-
est time possible.


   Columbia-Southern offers truly out-
 standing career opportunities to elec-
 trical engineers of promise. If you
 would like more information, please

Can you tell which men are



                      "GOING PLACES"?


Perhaps all of them-and you, too-will go places, if you get
started in the right place after graduation!
  Thompson Products tries to make sure that you get started in
the right place-either on a specific job, or in training for one,
whichever seems better for you.
  Thompson's diversification gives you many choices: Mechani-
cal, Electrical, Electronic, Nuclear, Metallurgical, Aeronautical
or Industrial Engineering ... Physics or Mathematics ... Manu-
facturing... Research and Development... Industrial Manage-
ment . . . Business Administration . . .Industrial Accounting
... Purchasing.
  We feel that Thompson's reputation as a "growth company"
is largely due to the attention given for many years to concen-
trated research, development and improvement of products and
methods. Today Thompson is engineering and manufacturing
for the automotive, aircraft, industrial and electronic markets.
  Thompson is a "big" company, employing over 25,000 people
-at the same time it is "small" in that each of its many


divisions operates as a company in itself, where you are an
important individual.
  Able, understanding technical supervisors work with you at
Thompson, men who are moving ahead just as you are. They
know the kind of help a man needs when he's starting on a new

Have you heard about linear programming? It's a new
tool of Management Science-a mathematical technique
devised to help management make decisions more quickly
and accurately than ever before.
   Suppose, for example, you are a manager faced with
 a veritable jungle of figures-schedules, machine loads,
 cost inventories. A decision based on these must be made.
 Once youwould have had to be satisfied with an educated
 "guesstimate," or perhaps recourse to trial and error.
 But now, with linear programming and electronic com-
 putation, you can get not merely "an" answer, but the
 best possible answer-and get it fast.

 Key to the success of linear programming is an electronic
 computer-IBM's 704. Its tremendous calculating speed
 and data capacity solve complex management problems
 often in a matter of minutes.
   If you are preparing for an engineering career, or are
majoring in math or physics, perhaps you would enjoy
helping IBM create electronic computers such as the 704.
The potential of this phase of electronics presents one of
the brightest chances today for a rewarding career. Why

COMPUTERS AND






      INFORMATION THEORY


           Today everyone knows how a thermostat works. If
       a house is equipped with a furnace and an air condi-
       tioning unit, both of which operate through a thermo-
       stat, it doesn't take much explaining to understand that
       if the house temperature rises above the desired tem-
0      perature, the thermostat will turn on the air condition-
       er and cool the house again. If the house temperature
       drops too low, the thermostat will turn on the furnace.
           The human mind also operates in this manner. If
       one starts to walk toward a tree on the opposite side
       of a field and then veers to the right,, one glance at the
       tree is all that is required to alter the course back
       toward the tree. If one wanders too far to the left, the
       "thermostat" in the brain will change the course back
       toward the tree just as soon as this information reaches
       the brain through the eyes.
           Thus, it has been discovered that the mind operates
       very much like machines. The process is called "feed-
       back" mechanism-in fact a "negative" feed back-
       negative, because if the temperature rises in a room,
       the information transmitted to the thermostat causes
       the furnace to be shut off so as to reduce the tempera-
       ture, i.e., change it in the opposite direction.
            Almost all of the thought processes can be repro-
       duced by machines. They can be made to calculate
       almost any problem which can be solved by man, but
       in a fraction of the time required of humans. Today
       we have Eniacs and Univacs, or digital and analog
       computers. Their capacity and speed in solving prob-
       lems are simply fabulous.
            It is interesting to note that even imaginative or
       inventive thinking is made possible by some sort of
       a "feed-back" mechanism. Fortunately, wish-thinking
       or ambition is characteristically human. A machine


Dr. G. R. Fitterer


(computer) has no desire or drive to do anything. It
must be fed by human brains. It does not have the
ability to associate the proper thoughts to reach a
logical conclusion. The human brain must first recog-
nize the relationship between, various factors 'before a
problem can be expressed and fed to the machine.
Desire 'and ability to corelate such data must be devel-
oped by young engineers who then would "feed" the
machines which would complete the laborious calcula-
tion. The machines would complete but not understand
or use the answers.
     The impact of information theory, feed-back me-
chanisms, servomechanisms, 'and computers on     the
future trends of science is little realized byv even those
who are skilled in this area.
     One often hears about the rapid changes in tech-
 nology wh;ich have taken place during this century and
 the accelerated pace at which technology has been
 developed since Hiroshima. These are just the begin-
 nings. Every engineer has an association of ideas tucked
 away in the recesses of his mind which, if translated to
 modern computers, would revolutionize some industry
 or science.
     Someone has stated that the 1920's and '30's were
 eras of measurement (i.e., temperature, pressure, time,
 etc.) and that the '40's and'50's were periods of mea-
 surement and the control of processes. However, the
 future will involve eras of synthesis and alterations.
 Machines which err will correct themselves. This is a
 part of the second industrial revolution which has al-
 ready begun.
     Computers and machines have one quality which
 would be of great benefit to the human race. They lack
 the capacity to become frustrated. They solve manly
 problems by trial and error methods and never become
 discouraged when an error is made-they try again-
 and eventually solve the problem. In this respect, if in
 no other, engineers could do well to emulate machines.

Harry M. Crooks, class of '49, speaks from experience when he says:


                  "At U. S. Steel there is a wide


    and varied choice of opportunities offered,


under the most agreeable working conditions."


THE RAPID RISE of Harry M. Crooks
   to his present responsible position
is typical of that experienced by
many hundreds of college graduates
who have joined forces with U. S.
Steel.
  Presently Assistant Superintend-
ent of the Power and Fuel Depart-
ment, National Works, National
Tube Division of United States
Steel, Harry M. Crooks graduated in
January, 1949 with a BS degree in
Mechanical Engineering, after serv-
ing three years in the U. S. Navy. He
started with U. S. Steel on February
1 as a student engineer. Within a
year-and-a-half he was made Process
Engineer in the Power and Fuel De-
partment, and ten months after that,
Power Engineer.
  After three years as Power Engi-
neer, he was promoted on March 1,
1954 to his present job as Assistant
Superintendent, with a wide range of
responsibilities, including all power


and fuel utilities throughout the
large National Works plant. This
position includes supervision of mill
and furnace air supplies for the steel-
making process, steam and mixed
gases for power, and open hearth oil
and tar. In carrying out this work, he
supervises a force of 250 men.
  Mr. Crooks decided to work at
U. S. Steel because he felt that U. S.
Steel had one of the finest training
programs available in industry to-
day. During his training, he arrived
at the personal conclusion that, being
an engineer, his best opportunities
were in the operating branch of the
steel industry.


  Quoting Mr. Crooks: "Through
the training received at the mill, the
engineer has the opportunity to work
in and become acquainted with every
phase of steelmaking and with every
department of the plant."

ing and rewarding career with United
States Steel, and feel you can quali-

                                     Tin conservation has become a
                                   necessity, and any method to save
                                   tin in current processes is important.
                                   In recent years many developments
                                   have been made in the tinplating in-
                                   dustry. This article describes elec-
                                   trolytic tinplating.









ELECTROLYTIC TINPLATING


BY CHARLES KISER, CH. E. '57


    The growth of electrolytic tinplating was slow
until the outbreak of World War II. Although the
process had been known for many years, the first con-
-tinuous electrolytic tinning unit was not placed in
operation until 1937. Prior to this time, the only method
of tin coating was by immersing the steel sheets into
a bath of molten tin. This was a more economical
operation since the initial cost was lower, and at the
time a hot dip stack did the coating job faster.
     Within the past twenty-five years two events oc-
curred which greatly ichanged several aspects of the tin
plating picture. With the advent of continuous cold
reduction processes in the early thirties continuous
electro-tinning became possible. Then, of course, the
scarcity of tin during World War II imposed strict
standards upon the steel industry forcing them to con-
serve this vital ,metal. Electrolytic tinning with its more
uniform, more accurate coating offered a solution to
this problem.
     Since 1937 the production of electrolytic tin plate
has grown from nothing to the point where eighty
per cent of tin plated products in the United States
and Canada are made by this process. These products.
include tin containers for foods, paints, beverages, oils,
and other types of closures, utensils such as baking pans,
bottle caps, plugs, gaskets and various drawn parts
in toys and electrical equipment.
Methods Of Plating
     The driving force behind the coating operation
is the flow of current between the tin anodes and
the steel strip, the cathode. The current density, and
consequently the amount of coating, may be adjusted
by changing the current or altering the distance be-
tween the tin anodes and the strip. There are three
main methods of plating, called electrolytic lines, each
characterized by the electrolyte used in the plating
bath. They are the vertical acid, halogen, and alkaline


baths. Although the organic electrolytes may differ,
the chemical reaction in the vertical acid and halogen
baths are similar since they both involve the oxidatioh
from metallic tin to the stannous ion (valence of 2) at
the anode and the reverse is true at the cathode. Twice
as great a current density is required in the alkaline
bath since the stannic ion (valence of 4) is involved
in the reaction rather than the stannous ion. This
means that four electrons rather than two must be
liberated to transfer an atom of tin to the steel strip.
It should 'be mentioned that in the vertical acid and
alkaline baths both sides of the strip are coated simult-
eneously while in the halogen bath one side of fhe
strip is coated, the strip is reversed by -passing over
a roller guide, and the other side is then coated. The
vertical acid and halogen baths are highly efficient but
are corrosive to equipment while the alkaline bath is
non-corrosive but less efficient.
     The alkaline plated product is somewhat superior
in corrosion resistance, but lacquers do not adhere to
the product quite as well as the acid products. These
differences have been minimized by -recent advances.
The halogen line requires slightly more floor space as
a result of the horizontal plating. All three lines are
quite suitable as shown, by the large tonnages -produced
by each. Through 1952 there were 15 vertical acid lines,
5 halogen lines and 13 alkaline lines with a combined
capacity of 3,845, tons of tin plate per year.
The Overall Process
     The steel coil to enter the electrolytic line is in-
 spected with respect to shape, hardness, finish, and size.


MAY 1957






















    This massive continuous annealing line processes strip
steel at a rate of 1,000 feet per minute to prepare it for
stiffening in the temper mill.


    In this 2-stand temper mill, the steel strip is tempered,
then sheared, or side-trimmed, 'before being coated with tin.


    The annealed, tempered and trimmed s'trip is fed into
this end of the electrolytic tinning line.


  The coating operation follows.
      Two uncoiling reels are generally at the entry end
  of each line. They may be either the standard cone
  type reels or expanding reels. Generally, the reels are
  in series with one reel being charged while the other
  reel is feeding into the line. The reels are charged by
  placing the coil on a platform next to the reel, the
  platform is raised so that the eye of the coil is in line
  with 'the reel, and' then the platform is moved toward
  the reel, so that the reel is inserted into the eye of the
  coil. The platform is then lowered and the reel is ex-
  panded to insure a snug fit.
      The next steps in the process are shearing and
 welding. The head and tail ends of each strip are shear-
 ed by an up-cut shear. The head of the coil to be
 charged is then arc welded to the tail end of the previ-
 'ous coil. The process requires only a few seconds. The
 head of the coil to be charged is engaged in a set of
 pinch rolls which also catches the tail end of the pre-
 vious coil. After the shearing operation   these pinch
 rolls regulate the speeds of the -two coils until the
 seam weld is applied.
     The coil is then fed into the looping pit or tower.
The purpose of the looping pit is to store enough strip
that the line will continue in operation while the weld
is being made. The coil is fed into the looping pit
somewhat faster than! the remainder of the line is run-
ning. Then while the weld is 'being made on the next
coil the line speed may remain constant by using the
excess strip in- the looping pit.
     From the looping pit the coil enters a tension
bridle which provides a sufficient tension on the strip
to prevent the dragging of the strip against any of the
equipment.
     In the two acid type lines an alkaline bath may be
inserted at this point in the process. In the alkaline line
this sometimes is not necessary since the plating bath

itself partially perfof,rms this operation. In this opera-
tion the strip pas-ses through a hot alkaline solution
(200',F or 'higher)( through which an electric current is
usually maintaink d to encourage the cleaning.
     The alkali/e is removed from the strip in a water
 spray rinsing ,unit prior to pickling. Since this is a
 rather fast, cg9ntinuous operation, the faster electrolytic
 pickling usyially is used rather than the straight chem-
 ical mettnod. In electrolytic pickling the current is
 tra  ierred to the strip by a conductor roll. By varying
i 'he current in this roll, the strip may be alternately
anodic and cathodic combining the good properties of
these two processes. Anodic pickling etches the strip
and improves adherence of the tinplate while cathodic
pickling liberates hydrogen from the strip and tends to
  reduce any oxide films from the strip. The strip is
  rinsed, and sometimes scrubbed, thoroughly and is then
  ready for the plating operation.
      The plating units are basically similar, differing
  only in the electrolyte used and the number of passes the
  strip makes through the bath. In all cases the strip
  passes over conductor rolls such as chromium plated
  cooper shells mounted on shafts. In alkaline baths the
  anodes are large tin slabs while the anodes in acid
  baths are approximately three inches by four inches by
  six feet long. The life of these anodes depends on the
  amount of current passing through them.
      The plating tanks are generally divided, into four
  compartments. In each of these compartments, the
  strip passes over the contact rolls and into the electro-
  lyte between the banks of anodes. The anodes are add-
  ed from one side of the line and moved through the
  line until they reach the other side of the line. The
  anode bridge slopes slightly toward the strip at the
  anode exit in order to compensate for difference' in
  thickness of anodes. Anodes may be added or sub-
  tracted to control the amount of plating. There are


no cooling worries in an alkaline bath, but in the
acid 'baths, shell and tube exchangers must be em-
ployed to control the temperature.
     After plating, the strip passes through wringer rolls
which remove most of the moisture. The remaining
moisture is then removed by hot air heaters. At 'this
point in the process the tin coating is dull and gray in
appearance. By heating the plate just 'above the fusion
point of tin and immediately quenching, the tin be-
comes smoother and more lustrous. This heating is
done by a 'closely regulated current through the strip
much likle the heating that occurs in the filament of a
light bulb.
     After quenching, the strip is given a filming treat-
ment to protect it from rust, discolorations or undesir-
able films. In some operations the plate is immersed in
a chemical solution while other operations use an elec-
trical current and chromic acid to accomplish filming.
In either case a very dense oxide film is created to pro-
tect against further undesirable oxidation.
     The final step before shearing is oiling the strip.
Either emulsion or electrostatic oil-coating may be
employed. In the emulsion method the strip is passed
through a bath or spray of unstable oil emulsion. The
emulsion consists ofan oil, a neutralizing agent, and an
emulsifying agent. Oil content and temperature of the
emulsion control the amount of oil deposited on the
strip. The oil spray is often electrostatically charged and
hence attracted 'to and grounded on the strip in this
menner. When a spray ,met'hod is used, emulsion or
electrostatic, the strip should -pass t'hrough the oiling
unit in a vertical direction.
     After oiling, the plate is then sheared to the re-
 quired dimensions, inspected, and packaged. In several
 plants, rather than shearing all the plate, some is
 shipped in coils. In this case the shear would be supple-
 mented by a recoiler. m

COMBUSTION CONTROL

                       BY FRED GLUCKSON, M. E. '58


                         e are now in the age of the automobile horse-
                      power race, and automotive engineers find themselves
                      under continual competitive pressure to build engines
                      of higher and higher horsepower. We are familiar with
                      their methods: higher compression ratios, more efficient
                      carburetion  and valve trains, increased   rotational
                      speeds. Yet the common aims of all of these methods
                      is to burn the maximum amount of gasoline efficiently
                      in a given length of time. It is this efficiency of combus-
                      tion that will become the big engine design criterion.
                      Crankshaft speeds are limited by engine stresses, car-
                      buretion advances are checked by complexity and cost
                      problems, but compression ratio is limited only by the
                      ability of the engine to burn its fuel charge -cleanly and
                      efficiently.
                      Faulty Combustion
                          Thermal efficiency of gasoline increases with com-
                      pression ratio until it levels out at around 14:1. But
                      before this value is reached, tremendous problems arise
                      in controlling the fuel combustion. Faulty burning of
                      the fuel robs power from the engine, decreases fuel
                      mileage and may -severly damage the engine parts. Poor
                      combustion often reaches the stage at which a sharp,
                      audible "knock" is heard upon full throttle acceleration,
                      or upon lugging up a hill. This sound is caused by vi-
                      bration of the combustion chamber parts under severe
                      dynamic loading. If 'allowed to continue, severe knock
                      may even crack a piston.
                          Knock is caused 'by uneven burning of the fuel
                      mixture. The flame front should initiate at ,the spark
                      plub and travel evenly across the combustion chamber.
                      In knock, however, the advancing flame front causes a
                      pressure wave to preceed it to the more remote loca-
                      tions of the fuel 'charge. This pressure wave causes an-
                      other ignition and flame front in another part of the
                      chamber. The two flame fronts, each travelling at 20
                      'to 150 ft./sec., meet and cause a tremendous instan-

taneous pressure wave. This shock wave strikes the
piston a hammerlike blow.
      Even more severe than knock is a form of com-
 bustion known as pre-ignition. It is caused by the ex-
 istence of a hot spot in the combustion chamber which
 fires the charge before the spark plug itself fires. This
 occurs while the piston is still on the compression stroke
 and creates tremendous pressures to oppose the piston.
 Stresses of great magnitude are thus set up in -piston,
 wrist pin, bearings, and crankshaft. Severe pre-ignition
 has been known to destroy completely an aircraft en-
 gin in seconds.
     Pre-ignition may be set off by a defective, or clog-
 ged cooling system, an exposed spark plug thread, or
 again, by extensive combustion deposite which reduce
 heat transfer to the cooling water or are of such a
 nature that they retain the heat themselves.
 Improving Combustion By Engine Maintenance
     The causes of knock may be eliminated by correct-
 ing any or all of the following conditions.
     The distributor timing is advanced as far as possi-
ble to get maximum power out of the gasoline. But the
effect of the vacuum distributor advance must also 'be
considered. When the engine is operating at full throt-
tle, as in the two previous situations, an additional
spark advance of 10 to 15 crankshaft degrees is realiz-
ed. Thus too high of an initial spark advance may make
an engine prone to knock.
     A new engine may operate smoothly under all con-
ditions, but when some additional mileage is recorded
it may begin to knock. This is due to deposits 'which
form naturally in all cars, and which are a factor in
engine knock. Occasional high speed driving will help
keep an engine free of these deposits.
     A too lean carburetor setting or float level may
boost economy, but lean fuel mixtures are more apt to
knock than rich ones.
     The causes for surface ignition can be eliminated
by improving cooling, removal of all sharp edges within
the combustion chamber, proper spark plug selection
and cleaning, improved valve maintenance, and the re-

moval of combustion cham,ber deposits.
Improved Combustion By Engine Design
     Apart from engine maintenance difficulties, anti-
 knock quality of gasoline and combusion chamber
 design are the controlling factors in fuel burning. The
 hemispherical combustive chambers are being widely
 accepted as conductive to good fuel efficiency. In it
 there are no remote corners for pressure to build up and
 no sharp corners to retain the heat. However, some pro-
 visions must 'be made in high compression engines for
 creating turbulence in the charge. It has been shown
 that ia well -mixed c,harge will burn more evenly than
 one in which the suspended gasoline droplets are of
 uneven size. Tihus the innovation known as a "squish
 area" was adopted. This is a part of the combustion
 chamber with very little clearance for the piston when
a:t top dead center. As the piston approaches the
squish area, it drives the entrapped mixture out in a
jet into the main body of charge, thus creating auxiliary
turbulence.

  quality to determine. However, an arbitrary reproduci-
  ble scale was set up by Dr. Graham Edgar in 1926
  employing blends of fuels known as normal heptane
  and iso-octane. The scale is read in octane number,
  the volume percentage of iso-octane present in the
  fuel. Thus pure normal heptane rates zero octane
  number, and pure iso-octane rates 100. Since fhis scale
  was set up, it has been found necessary to extend it
  past 100. This is defined by the addition of discrete
  quantities of tetraethyl lead to the iso-octane. Now the
  octane rating scale runs up to 120. Octane rating is
  the ability of a fuel to resist knock, and is determined
  by comparing the fuel with reference fuels in control
  engines.
      Modern engines are demanding gasoline of higher
  and higher octane rating, leading to the recent market-
  ing of a number of "super" fuels at premium    prices.
  Although the octane Trating of a fuel can be raised by
  the use of certain additives, there are both practical and
  legislative limits to this effect. Modern cars cannot run
  without knocking on fuels that will easily satisfy engines
  made just a few short years ago.
  Future Gasolines
      The best guesses among refinery and automotive
 men indicate an octane-requirement of about 105 for
 high compression engines of ten years from now. The
 refineries -will 'be sorely pressed to provide this fuel at
 a price less than prohibitive. However, if an engine is
 tuned -to utilize the maximum possible spark advance
 permissible for a relatively knockless fuel, the increased
 power 'per gallon will tend to offset the higher price,
 mileage-wise. Such a highly tuned engine will not run
 satisfactorily on low or medium grades of fuel.
     Automotive gasolines with octane ratings as high
 as 105 can be obtained by the use of higher quality
 basic components and the admixture of various addi-
 tives.
     In the complex operation of a gasoline refinery
 there 'are many factors that dictate the final composi-
 tion of a fuel. Among these are the original nature of
 the petroleum, market demand for fuels other than
 gasoline, the immediate cost of transforming less desir-
 able components in'to better ones. For example, aroma-

   tics are 'a family of hydrocarbons found in petroleum
   and are desirable in gasoline for their high anti-knock
   qualities, but have a detrimental effect on 'rubber,
   greater pre-ignition tendency, and poor lean-mixture
   performance. Cyclic paraffins and naphthelenes are
   excellent components but are not used in.excess of 30%
   because of their relatively high cost and slightly lower
   heat content per pound.
       These and many other factors are considered and
   the basic nature of the gasoline is determined. To this
   mixture, certain additives are blended.
   Combustion-Control Additives
       Possibly the most widely used fuel additive is
  tetraethyl lead. The addition of small quantities of
  TEL will greatly boost the anti-knock quality of gaso-
  line. In opposition to this beneficial quality are certain
  drawbacks to the use of TEL. It is quite expensive. It
  is 'highly toxic, and so is limited in concentration to 3
  -cc. per gallon of gas by Federal law. This law also re-
  quires that all fuels using TEL indicate this fact by
  also adding a red dye. TEL has a tendency to form
  undesirable lead deposits in the combustion chamber,
  and so necessitates the use of ethylene dibromide as a
  scavenging 'agent. However, TEL is a very flexible
  agent for boosting octane rating, and has found 'wide
  use in refining.
      Another additive for controlling undesirable com-
 bus'tion (knock) is ICC or Ignition Control Compound.
 This phosphorous compound has three major effects.
 It prevents carbon deposits in the combustion chamber
 from becoming incandescent and causing preignition.
 It prevents spark plugs from fouling due to deposits.
 By suppressing preignition, it lowers octane require-
 ment to that needed 'to suppress ordinary knock.
     Other combustion control compounds added to
gasoline are benzol and alcohol, but these are rarely
used because of 'certain important disadvantages.
     Thus, the performance of tomorrow's advanced
design engines is limited by the ability of tomorrow's
gasolines to burn with a maximum of heat output, and
in controlled, smooth combustion. i

"IT WILL FLY"


     Professor Langley taught physics and astronomy
 at the University (then kncwn as the Western Univer-
 sity of Pennsylvania). He was also director of the
 Allegheny Observatory, serving in this capacity for
 twenty years from 1867 to 1887. During this time he
 attracted wide acclaim for his writings and general
 contributions to astronomy.
     But in 1866 Professor Langley became interested
 in a work on the flight of migratory whooping cranes
 by Israel Lancaster. The 52-year-old professor was in-
 stantly fired with curiosity to find the secret of the
 gentle soaring flight of the great birds who could sus-
 tain themselves for hours in a seemingly effortless posi-
 tion. This curiosity launched the aging professor on a
 long hard road of research which led down one blind
 alley after another, and finally ended in defeat.
     Langley set about to determine what forces in the
 air the birds used to sustain themselves, not realizing
 that the balance of forces and the power of the flight
 was controlled by the birds and not by the air around
 them. By means of a rapidly rotating table, on which
 were mounted stuffed birds with their wings extended,
 Langley was able to measure lift and to some extent
 drag.
     Realizing -that the flight of these birds was depend-
ent upon a Newtonian maxim which stated that the
resistance of a plane surface to the air varies as the
square of the sine of its angle of incidence. Langley
began to expand his experiments and apply the princi-
ple to a variety of surfaces.
     With the backing of William Thaw, a Pittsburgh
philanthropist, Langley built a larger spinning table
with brass plates attached to the ends of long arms. The
plates, which could be rotated on their longitudinal
axes, would provide a varying angle of attack.
Finds Error In Newton's Law (can be rewarded)
     The result of this study was the issuance of a
physical law by Langley which stated that Newton's
figures on resistance were in error 'and that resistance
was only 1/20 that stated by Newton. He further stated
that mechanical flight was possible with engines then in
existance.


Samuel Pierpont Langley


BY JIM MARINO, COL. '58


     In 1889 Professor Langley was named secretary of
 the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D. C. As a
 result of this position, Professor Langley was able to
 secure funds to publish his writings on heavier-than-
 air flight. Also at this time Langley experimented with
 hundreds of flying models powered by many engines of
 various kinds. He was forced to end these toy-like
 experiments without having attained a single flight of
 more than four seconds.
     Unwanted publicity hounded Langley throughout
 his experiments and followed him unceasingly to his
 retirement. The love he had for quiet research and the
 need for solitude presented by his work at the institute
 were denied him. He was a watched man from the
 very beginning of his experiments. This publicity would
 have made him a national hero had his experiments
culminated in manned flight. Instead, public acclaim
turned to ridicule and caused -the destruction of his
dream of powered flight.

  be able to rise and move without power. This is an
  amazingly   accurate account in stumbling, groping
  words of the thermal-borne flight of sailplanes.
  Builds First Plane
      With these principles in mind, Langley set about
 to prove that powered heavier-than-air flight was pos-
 sible. He constructed a small, very lightweight steam
 engine which operated with 'a low power to weight
 ratio. He worked long and hard on the development
 of suitable wings to carry the aerodrome. By 1894 he
 was experimenting on a flying model which was launch-
 ed from atop a houseboat moored in the Potomac near
 Quantico. The wings of the poorly-balanced model
 were of silk, the framework of split bamboo. The fragile
 nature of the lightweight craft required a dead calm
 for launching, a situation rarely witnessed in the Vir-
 ginia winter. The launching catapult was tricky and
 unreliable. These factors spelled immediate defeat for
 the first four models shot into the cold air. One by one
 the frail 'models strained at the catapult with 'the
 force of their tiny steam engines, and one by one they
 were cut loose only to drop and sink beneath the waters
 of the river.
     In October, 1894, Aerodrome No. 5 was launched
 and maintained a flight of 'three seconds which covered
 about 35 feet. The aerodrome weighed 22 pounds
 "flying-weight."
     By the end of the year Langley had launched
 number 5 three more times and the same results were
 witnessed. Finally, in evidence of his dauntless courage
 and burning curiosity, Langley wrote of his experi-
 ment, "the di.ficulties of factual flight . . . . probably
 lie even more in obtaining exact balance than in . . .
 obtaining the mere engine power to sustain a machine
 in the air." The experiments were continued in the
 face of certain d'efeat. But a lesson had been learned:
 balance was the secret of sustained flight.
     After much thought to the necessity of proper
 moments of rotation;, a pair of tandem wings and a
 pair of crossed planes for the tail assembly was decided
 upon. The launching of Number 6, a 26-pound model
 which looked like a dragonfly, was a failure and the
 crash was attributed to a faulty launching. But the
 venerable old man with his shirtsleeves rolled up stood
 on the bank of the river and realized that his success
 was closer than it had been -for years.


26


         Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, a close friend of
  Professor Langley and a man who knew the hardships
  of fruitless research, was present at the launching of the
  rebuilt Number 5 equipped with tanden wings. The
  day was May 6, 1896. Langley and Bell had just fin-
  ished a final check of the launching mechanism, the
  wings, the tail, and his engine of the aerodrome. They
  stood on the shore and looked out to the houseboat.
  Langley had been through one of the most difficult
  winters of his life. He had seen model after model
  ,collapse and sink. Newspapers had called him a mad-
  man, quack and dreamer. Tihrough all the defeat he
  had retained his belief that powered flight was 'attain-
  able in his time. Now Bell stood by, camera in hand,
  waiting to secure positive proof. The white-bearded
  astronomer waited until a few minutes after three and
  then shouted to the attendant on the houseboat, "Let
  her go." Then he held 'his breath.
  Flight Is Achieved
      The propellers whirrled madly, the tiedown rope

 surprise of Langley, Bell and the morbidly curious on-
 lookers on the banks of the Potomac it began to rise
 slowly in long graceful spirals. In the shouting and con-
 fusion, Bell forgot to take his historic pictures and
 hugged Langley excitedly. He later told reporters that
 he saw tears on the old man's cheeks.
     The aerodrome remained airborne for 1 minute,
20 seconds, attained an altitude of between 70 and
100 feet and covered 3,000 feet. Immediately after the
model was recovered safe and sound from the river,
it was relaunched and flew again for 2,300 feet. A
rebuilt Number 6 was launched in November of the
same year and flew 4200 feet at about 30 mph.
     Professor Langley's curiosity had been satisfied.
His principles had been proved. He stated publicly
that the success of Aerodromes 5 and 6 marked the
end "of the 'work which seemed to 'be especially mine-
the demonstration of the practicability of mechanical
flight-and for the next stage, which is the commercial
and practical development of the idea, it is probable
that the world may look 'to others."

      If Professor Langley had actually concluded his
 experiments with the attainment of powered flight, his
 achievement would have made him an internationally-
 acclaimed pioneer of aerodynamics. He would have
 been known as the man who achieved successful, heav-
 ier-than-air flight seven years before the first manned
 flight -by the Wright brothers. But circumstances were
 to shape the destiny of his later years. Already the
 enraged press was screaming in black type for the
 start of the Spanish-American War.
 War Contract Offered
     In July,. 1898, Gene Adolphus W. Greely, chief of
 the United States Army Signal Corps, was sent to
 Smithsonian -from President McKinley to request that
 Langley build an aerodrome suitable for combat duty.
 The weary professor rissisted and restated his desire to
 close his book of flight research. But the army had ?dif-
 ferent.,ideas. After securing a sum of $50,000 to cover
 the expense of building a manned aerodrome, Professor
 Langley reluctantly agreed.
     Experiments were begun      in June; 1898. Mr.
 Charles M. Manly, a Cornell University graduate, was
 appointed to design a full-scale airframe, capable of
 carrying a man. The models used in 1896 were scaled
 up and used in experimental flights from the houseboat
 in the Potomac. Throughout 1899, the experiments
 were unsuccessful. Trouble plagued the houseboat, the
 catapult, and the aerodromes themselves.
     Two years before, a contract had been signed with
S. M. Balzer fortwo lightweight gasoline engines of
twelve horsepower, weighing 'less' than 220 pounds.
Balzer never met the contract. Langley spent six weeks
in Europe trying to secure engines of this type without
success. Finally, Manly designed and built a 5-cylinder,
4 cycle radial engine, weighing 207.47 pounds and de-
livering 52.4 horsepower.
     By the summer of 1903, the tandem-winged aero-
drome, with a wing span of 48 feet and an overall
length of 5'2 feet, was ready to be launched. It boasted
a framework. of steel tu'bing, bevel gear transmission,
cotton-percaline-covered wings and two pusher propell-
ers. It weighed 850 pounds 'with the pilot. The aero-
drome used a split-vane rutter and an "equilibrium
control," which trimmed the ship fore and aft. The
pilot was able to adjust the engine in flight from  his

  seat in from of the power plant. Lateral and vertical
  controls were mounted to the right and left of the
  pilot's seat. Longitudinal controls were provided by the
  exaggerated dihedral of the wings. The aerodrome was
  mounted on the 'catapult and ready to launch, and
  there it sat for two months while storms lashed the
  Quantico area.
      Finally, on October 7, 1903, the launching was
  made. Professor Langley was detained in Washington
  for official business or, perhaps, merely used that ex-
  cuse to hide from the waiting press, who had alrea'dy
  expressed an open criticism of the government's waste
  of money on the experiment. Nevertheless, the 'launch-
  ing was made, and the aeroship fell heavily from the
  end of the platform into the water. Manly, its pilot,
  was rescued unhurt and made a statement to the press
  in which he 'blamed a lack of balance in the airframe
  for the failure.
      Immediately the press unleashed a fury of criti-
 cism, telling Langley and the government that they
 disapproved of the experiment and the idea of manned
 flight. Langley was the butt of cruel jokes: and was
 accused of quackery, of lack of intelligence, and of
 seeking publicity.
      Although his heart was never in the new experi-
 ment, Langley took the latest failure as a personal
 defeat. However, his courage would not be subjugated
 and through the constant and relentless persuasion of
 Manly, he repeated the fateful experiment of 1903. The
 latest attempt on January 6, 1906, resulted in the de-
 struction of the machine, even before it left the cata-
 pult.
      Again the hounding press criticized the old astron-
 omer -for his failures. Again, Manly insisted that the
 professor attempt one more trial. The money from the
 government plus a loan from the Smithsonian Institute
 and a great deal of the personal savings of Manly and
 Langley had already been used up. As a result of the
 bad publicity, no more money was forthcoming, and a
 final trial was never made.
     And so ended the experiments in flight by Profes-
 sor Samuel Piermont Langley. A short time after the
 failure of the fund-raising campaign for the last trial
 of Langley's man-carrying machine, the Wright broth-
 ers successfully made their flight at Kitty Hawk. When
 Professor Langley read of their success, he turned to
 Manly and said, "I must congratulate them." But the
 fire of curiosity and the burning desire to achieve
 powered flight were gone from Langley's eyes. He
 cleared his desk in the Smithsonian Institute and re-
 signed his position.
     On February 27, 1906, without fanfare or public
attention, forgotten :by the press which beat him to
defeat and the crowds that waited to see him fail, Pro-
fessor Langley died. He had never seen a man fly.
     In 1914, a rebuilt model of the man-carrying aero-
 drome was successfully flown and landed on the waters
 of the Potomac, proving too' late to the world that
 Professor Langley had achieved his dream  and that
only the world prevented him from seeing it. E

ENGINEERING - - A PROFESSION




                                                            BY  DR. E. B. STEWART, CH. E.


     Last February we celebrated Engineer's Week
  throughout the Nation. The theme for this celebration
  was "Engineering-America's Great Resource". Presi-
  dent Eisenhower sent a message to Robert J. Rhine-
  hart, president of the National Society of Professional
  Engineers, saluting "-the contributions made by the
  members of the Engineering Profession". Engineers'
  Week, believe it or not, has been recognized by only two
  of our presidents. Engineering as a profession is new,
  so new, that many students-even engineers don't
  recognize t'he need for professionalism.
      Before getting into the need for professionalism,
 we might stop and ask, "Why is engineering now a
 profession?" I believe that engineering has reached
 the status of a profession in the same manner as the
 other three well known professional groups; clergy, law,
 and medicine. For example, when people first started
 to think about things they couldn't understand such as
 life and death, the men who came forward and answer-
 ed those questions sincerely and with vision, were
 trusted and elevated to the profession of the clergy. In
 fact, more often than not, we can recognize a member
 of that profession by his distinctive dress.
     Early in our civilization men found it necessary
 to call on experts to interpret written laws that con-
 cerned them, to speak for them and to present their
 cases in convincing and learned language. These mem-
 bers of the legal profession who can read well and
 logically present another mans argument are   well
 known by their ability to communicate.
     Another place where we found a need for special-
 ists was in medicine. Here we needed and found well
 trained people dedicated to their work so that they
 traditionally put in long hours to care for our physical
 ills. We have come to trust them for their devotion to
 duty, coleanliness, and the knowledge that they will
 help us whether we are rich or poor.
     All of these professions have arisen when the peo-
ple found a need for a special service, a service that
could not be performed by themselves. I ask myself
the question, "Could not that be true of any trade or
art?" Possibly the only difference that we can see
between the special skill or service, and the same sort
of specialized work as done by a number of professions,
is that you respect the professional. You respect his
vision and ideals. You respect his logical thinking and
ability to communicate. You respect his cleanliness and
devotion to your problem. You can't direct him, he


      Medicine, law and the ministry are recognized
   professions. Has engineering reached similar high
   standards of professionalism? Dr. Stuart states that
   the respect and recognition of engineers as profes-
   sional people must first come from within our-
   selves.











 makes the decisions, but you trust him because you
 know that he is making his decision based on his
 training and with your success as his goal.
      I think the reason that engineering has reached
 the status of a profession is two-fold. First, we are
 more dependent on technology today than we were
 twenty or thirty years ago. We might think of the
 world today without some of the recent technological
 'advances. Picture our day without any plastics, super
 highways, or electronics. I won't try to justify the pre-
 sent complexity of our lives with these 'things, but we
 have found them useful enough to become dependent
 on them. The non-engineering public realizes the need
 for the special background, th special type of thinking
 that's necessary to keep pace with this complexity.
     The second reason for the elevation of the engin-
eers to a professional status comes from  within the
engineering group. Although the need for engineers
has existed for quite a few years, people will not raise
any group to the status of a profession unless they
trust that group  without reservation. Fortunately,
there is a segment of trained engineers that has estab-
lished, promoted, and lived by a written code of ethics
and a personal integrity that the public has come to


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER













































trust. This has elevated engineeers as a whole to the
professional level.
     It is unfortunate that we also have a segment of
engineers who still consider themselves highly skilled
tradesmen. Today we hear a lot of talk about the
engineering unions. I firmly believe that there is a
place for an engineering union. However, this engin-
eering union should only serve that segment of men with
an engineering training that should be catagorized as
engineering technicians. For that large group of en-
gineering technicians, the union is a necessity. For
the professional engineer, the creative engineer, there
is no need for anything more than the present profes-
sional and technical societies.
     Apparantly the consensus of the many studies of
our manpower shortage indicate that we should use our
trained people more wisely. We should emphasize the
creative engineering and the technician level as two
separate branches. Certainly, there is a need for tech-
nically trained people to do the many necessary jobs
to bring an idea to fruition. The technician does not,
however, have the same responsibility as that of the
person originating the idea or directing the work. Their
training need not be as extensive as that necessary for


the creative engineer, the professional.
     If a student wants to work in the Engineeering
Profession and not as a technician, he must begin to ac-
quire the professional attitude early. The acquisition of
the characteristics, standards or methods of profession-
als is what I would call "Professionalism." Since there
is no place in the curriculum for professionalism, the
student must get it for himself.
     At a college a student can learn the the funda-
mental physical laws. The techniques of adapting these
physical laws to produce or to construct for the com-
mon good may be learned in an engineering school.
The use of this special knowledge is like playing ball.
We 'may learn the physical law that a ball tossed in
the air will fall toward the ground. In engineering
school we would go further, we learn the technique
of how to catch ,the ball. Now to bring the analogy a
little further, 'com'pare the catching of the ball by the
sand-lot player to that of the professional ball player
Both perform the same feat, but we enjoy watching the
professional. We pay 'to see the professional ball player
because he catches the ball with ease, gracefulness, pre-
cision, and much respect for the game.
      I believe that a student can start early in becoming
 a Professional Engineer by following three simple rules:
     1. Respect your profession; Utilize your time well
        in school to get the best possible training in
        your field. Be prepared to participate whole-
        heartedly in professional and learned societies.
     2. Respect others; They deserve that you give your
         best, that means your best work, your best ap-
         pearance, your best language. Be prepared to
         be humble, personally I have never met a man,
         no matter what his background or job might be,
         from  whom   I could not learn something of
         value.
     3. Respect yourself; Be honest in evaluating your
         technical ability, the a'mount of time you spend
         on your studies, your habits. You will find that
         you have the. same opportunities as the best,
         and the same abilities.
      It is rather obvious that I have been concentrating
  on developing the value of appearance, use of correct
  English, and attitude to the Professional Engineer.
  These things alone are not enough, by any means, to
  elevate a person to the professional status. We certainly
  need many other things such as hard work, decisiveness,
  dependability, along with perfection in creative engin-
  eering. This idea of creating     good impressions is
  important. It's a simple thing to accomplish, yet it
  means so much to a practicing engineer. We can't force
  our services on the general public, they must ask for
  our help or advice. So, before we can make a "Contri-
  bution" as President Eisenhower put it, before we
  can do our work for the benefit of non-engineers, we
  must have their trust and respect. I think we 'may
  help win that trust and respect with professionalism. 0

in the field of Aerodynamics


Although each successive chapter in
the history of aircraft engines has as-
signed new and greater importance
to the problems of aerodynamics,
perhaps the most significant de-
velopments came with the dawn of
the jet age. Today, aerodynamics
is one of the primary factors in-
fluencing design and performance of
an aircraft powerplant. It follows,
then, that Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
- world's foremost designer and
builder of aircraft engines - is as
active in the broad field of aero-
dynamics as any such company
could be.
   Although the work is demanding,
 by its very nature it offers virtually
 unlimited opportunity for the aero-
 dynamicist at P & W A. He deals
 with airflow conditions in the en-


gine inlet, compressor, burner, tur-
bine and afterburner. From both the
theoretical and applied viewpoints,
he is engrossed in the problems of
perfect, viscous and compressible
flow. Problems concerning boundary
layers, diffusion, transonic flow,
shock waves, jet and wake phenom-
ena, airfoil theory, flutter and
stall propagation - all must be at-
tacked through profound theoretical
and detailed experimental processes.
Adding further to the challenge and
complexity of these assignments at
P & W A is this fact: the engines
developed must ultimately perform
in varieties of aircraft ranging from
supersonic fighters to intercontinen-
tal -bombers and transports, func-
tioning throughout a wide range of
operational conditions for each type.


Moreover, since every aircraft is
literally designed around a power-
plant, the aerodynamicist must con-
tinually project his thinking in such
a way as to anticipate the timely
application of tomorrow's engines to
tomorrow's airframes. At his service
are one of industry's foremost com-
puting laboratories and the finest
experimental facilities.
Aerodynamics, of course, is only
one part of a broadly diversified en-
gineering program at Pratt & Whit-
ney Aircraft. That program - with
other far-reaching activities in the
fields of instrumentation, combus-
tion, materials problems and me-
chanical design - spells out a
gratifying future for many of to-
day's engineering students.


   Modern electronic computers accelerate both the analy-
 ''tis and the solution of aerodynamic problems. Some of
 these problems include studies of airplane performance
r%%which permit evaluation of engine-to-airframe applications.

As recently as ten years ago it was just becoming
evident that digital techniques in electronics were
destined to create a new and rapidly growing field.
Today, incorporated in electronic computers and
other equipment, they constitute one of the most sig-
nificant developments in scientific computation, in
electronic data processing for business and industry,
and in electronic control systems for the military. In
the near future they are expected to become a major
new factor in industrial process control systems.
The digital computer for scientific computation is
becoming commonplace in research and development
laboratories. Such machines range from small spe-
cialized units costing a few thousand dollars, to large
general purpose computers costing over a million
dollars. One of these large computers is a part of the
Ramo-Wooldridge Computing Center, and a second
such unit will be installed the latter part of this year.
The digital computer has not only lightened the com-
putation load for scientists and engineers, but has
made possible many calculations which previously
were impracticable. Such computers have played a
major role in the modern systems engineering
approach to complex problems.
Electronic data processing for business and industry
is now well under way, based on earlier developments
in electronic computers. Data processors have much


in common with computers, including the utilization
of digital techniques. In this field, teams of Ramo-
Wooldridge specialists are providing consulting serv-
ices to a variety of clients on the application of data
processing equipment to their problems.
The use of digital techniques in military control
systems is an accomplished fact. Modern interceptor
aircraft, for example, use digital fire control systems.
A number of Ramo-Wooldridge scientists and engi-
neers have pioneered in this field, and the photograph
above shows a part of an R-W-developed airborne
digital computer.
These, then, are some of the aspects of the rapid
growth which is taking place in the field of digital
techniques. Scientists and engineers with experience
in this field are invited to explore openings at The

GAS-FILLED CIRCUIT BREAKERS

     The first experimental gas-filled circuit breakers
 ever built were recently installed on the Gulf Power
 Company's substation at Pensacola, Florida. The break-
 ers have a continuous current rating of 400 ampres
 rms, will interrupt in 5 cycles, and reclose in less than
 15 cycles. This SF6 breaker is restrike free, which makes
 it particularly well adapted for switching capacitors,
 either single bank or bank against bank.
     The gas has excellent insulation properties and is
used at relatively low pressure (45 psig). A porcelain
housing is used for the enclosure. The upper half of the
porcelain-clad pole unit contains the interrupting device,
and the lower half provides insulation to ground.
    Three curved, double-armed, U-shaped     moving
contact castings are mounted on a rotating shaft and
mate with six stationary contacts to provide a total
of six breaks per phase. The breaks are formed within
an insulating tube in which stationary contacts pass. The
short stroke and small amount of closing energy re-
quired of this breaker allows eleven closing operations
without going below minimum closing pressure with
the standard pneumatic operating mechanism.
    Each pole unit is approximately nine feet high by
one foot wide and weighs approximately one thousand
pounds.



CRYSTAL GAZING


    Crystal gazing to help produce even better, more
uniform high quality steels 'has been made possible at
the new U. S. Steel Research Center in Monroeville,
Pennsylvania, by the harnessing of electrons.
     "Point probe analysis," a new metallurgical re-
search technique, permits analysis of steel-specimen
areas 10,000 times smaller than is possible by any other
method. The point probe method of analysis involves


the use of an electron microscope containing a focused
electron beam to excite X-ray emission from a region
as small as a few microns in diameter. The character-
istic X-rays emitted are then analyzed by a crystal
spectrometer.
    With this information the metallurgist can bring
out the best qualities in steel. He does this by prescrib-
ing more exact heat treating and processing on the
basis of the data revealed by the new research tool.

A YEAR IN REVIEW




                   BY LOWELL TARBETT, P. E. '57


This is the year's report
on the acthvities of the
35-member Engineering
and Mines Cabinet.


   During the past year the Engineering and Mines
Cabinet has carried through an expanded and pro-
gressive program. 'Cabinet's goal was to become recog-
nized as the most active student government organiza-
tion on campus. To achieve this goal a comprehensive
program was established in four areas; service to the
engineering students, awards, departmental competi-
tion, and social activities.
Service
     The Freshman Interest Committee was established
to help the Freshman become adjusted to college life
and to acquaint them with Engineering activities. This
committee sent out letters of welcome to the incoming
fall freshmen. A special seminar was held in February
for the mid-year freshman class. At this seminar the
freshmen were introduced to Pitt, the Engineering
School, and activities.
     The Lounge Committee continued to serve the
student body by making many improvements in the
lounge. A hi-fi radio and phonograph was purchased
with E & M Association funds, and chess and checker
sets, playing cards, and current magazines were add-
ed to the lounge for the enjoyment of the engineering
students. A program was established for keeping the
lounge clean, and part of this program was the assign-
ment of E & M cabinet people to handle business in the
office adjacent to the lounge, These assignments also


allowed the students to question Cabinet members about
various phases of activities.
     An efficient locker program was stimulated this
 year. An organized locker system was established and
 lockers were provided free of charge to all students.
     The most obvious of the new activities to serve
 better the Engineer was the establishment of the En-
 gineering and Mines Bulletin. The weekly Bulletin
 has published information which is of direct concern
 to the Engineering and Mines students. The accept-
 ance of the Bulletin has been even greater than anti-
 cipated, thanks to the up-swing of engineer spirit and
 the efforts of the editor and staff of the Bulletin.
     Along with the establishment of a Bulletin to
 keep the student informed, two 'committees were form-
 ed. The Religion and Culture Committee has tried to
 acquaint the engineers with the Wednesday Chapel
 Services and will continue to publicize cultural and re-
 ligious' events around campus. The Student Faculty
 Relations committee was designed so that more of the
 student body could get to know the faculty. Organized
 meetings of students and faculty were anticipated and
 the committee,is working closely with Student Congress
 on this program.
 Departmental Competition
    Cabinet has tried to instill spirit in the engineer.
It set up a program so that each Engineer can take
pride in his own department. Engineers' Week is the
most prominent event in this program. During Engin-
eers' Week a pride and spirit were developed by each
engineer. This pride 'took the form of displays and par-
ticipation in various events during the Week. At the
end of the Week each department was a solid, well or-
ganized group, and the Engineering School as a whole
benefited.


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER



















The Engineering and Mines Cabinet.





     This year an athletic program was pushed ahead
 by Cabinet. In order to stimulate department com-
 petition a running trophy was purchased and will
 be awarded to the department with the best overall
 athletic results in football, volleyball, basketball, and
 softball. An increase in engineer interest in the Athletic
 program was evident.
 Awards
     The Engineering and Mines Cabinet traditionally
 awards a plaque to the outstanding graduating senior
 each semester. This plaque is awarded to the graduate
 who has shown qualities of scholarship, leadership, ser-
 vice, and character. As well as the Outstanding Senior
 Award a plaque is given to the outstanding seminar.
 The departmenal seminar which achieves the best over-
 all program is considered for the award.
     The Engineering and Mines International Travel
and Training program was continued. The Cabinet was
assisted by the Engineering  Alumni Association in
providing $500.00 for each of two awardees. These
awardees will work and study in a foreign country of
their choice. The EMITT program has been stabilized,
expanded, and assured for the future.
Social Activities
     The Engineering and Mines Cabinet has expanded
their social activities. The Fall and Spring Dances at
West View Danceland were great successes. A great
number of Engineers were treated to good dancing,
fine intermission entertainment, and an overall good
time. A definite trend away from the ordinary fall and
spring socials was started with the square dance in
December. This affair added greatly to participation in
the social events. This trend to orginality and variety in
social events was continued in the Spring. All of the
engineers who attended the Spring hayride also had a
great time.
     Being a Cabinet with orginal ideas and plans,
many new activities were established. A pep committee
was iniated to increase support at pep rallys and foot-
ball games. The major accomplishment of this com-
mittee was the displaying of a 70 foot poster at the


Homecoming football game. The Engineering and
Mines Association also entered a booth in Spring Car-
nival. The Spring 'Carnival iCommittee gave a fine
start to what is hoped will be an annual project.
     In an effort to create a closer fellowship among
Cabinet members a mid-year informal party was held.
Another first, the party proved 'to be a step in the
right direction. Also, in May, a banquet for old and
new Cabinet members showed promise of being a
yearly affair. These social affairs not only tend to
draw Cabinet members closer together, but also serve
:as a means of recognition and reward for the hours of
work spent in turning out 'the highly desirable E & M
program.
     This past year of accomplishment was a most pro-
fitable one for the E & M 'Cabinet. The year has been
one of expansion and improvement. Motivated by a
desire to sell Engineering and Mines students, the
school, and activities to the University, the Cabinet
iniated new and original programs. The year '56-'57
was undoubtedly the best in the history of the Engin-
eering and Mines Association. 0

FOR


ENGINEERS


TECHNICAL WRITING


          Industry needs engineers who like
        to write. How does technical writing
        and editing compare as a career for
        an engineer who can write? How
        broad is the field? What does it take
        to be a technical writer?








    Engineering recruiters are now asking specifically
'for engineers who like to write. Technical writing, al-
most unheard of twenty years ago, is today a multi-
million dollar industry. A new form of exposition?
Certainly not! Technical writing was born in the dawn
of technology. Actually, most early technical writing
took the form of patent applications in which a gadget
was described in purpose, construction, and operation.
Later, it was usually the inventor himself who wrote
the first instruction booklets. World War II saw the
need for voluminous amounts of technical literature.
The armed forces required operation, maintenance, and
repair manuals to instruct its personnel in the care and
feeding of weapons, machines, and electronic apparatus.


  BY      JOSEPH SCHULER, E. E.'57








Today, as the complexity of equipment has greatly
increased, military services have even greater need for
better written and more complete instruction manuals.
The Importance of Technical Writing
    It is not only the military who is dependent on
good technical writing. To a great degree, the scientific
and engineering professions are tied to the excellence of
its technical publications. Industry would be seriously
hampered without it. As the complexilty of modem tech-
nology has increased, the need 'for technical communi-
cation has gained prominence and importance. To. in-
sure high quality publications, many industrial and re-
search organizations maintain a separate staff of per-
sonnel to prepare, write, and edit technical information.
The plain fact of the matter is 'that reducing newly
found knowledge to a useable form is as important
as the discovery itself.
Forms of Technical Writing


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER




     Technical writing has as many forms as there are
needs and purpose in a complicated industrial age. The
more common forms are the technical letter and bro-
chure, the engineering report and proposal, and the
technical manual. Equally important are the articles
which appear in the scientific and engineering journals
and the familiar trade magazine's. All good technical
writing, no matter what its final form, affectively trans-
lates specialized  information  into language   under-
standable by a specific audience. To be effective, this
writing must be clear, concise, complete, and consist-
ent with the primary requirement of accuracy.
Technical Writing Opportunities
     Engineers who like to write can select from a wide
variety of opportunities. These opportunities will often
carry different descriptive titles. However, whether he
be a technical editor, a publications engineer, engin-
eering writer, or scientific correspondent, all have the
responsibility of transforming technical data into tech-
nical information for the specific reader. However,
techPi'cal writing opportunities may be classified accord-
ing to specific writing requirements:
  1. Writing which contains specialized information
      detailed in engineering and scientific fact.
           This writing is prepared by highly skilled
           engineers and    scientists whose complete
           knowledge of what is involved permits him
           to explain accurately and concisely the in-
           nards of mysterious black 'boxes. Writers in
           this category are sometimes called Product
           Technical Writers or Engineering Writers.
           Since their writing must be complete and
           accurate, they must fully understand the
           details of 'the product or process. This un-
           derstanding of detail is the "little picture"
           aspect of technical writing.
             Oftentimes writers in this category work
           in groups preparing instruction books., main-
           tenance and operating manuals for com-
           plex products or systems. These writers, fully
           aware of their audience, must choose the
           proper language symbol to bridge the gap
           between manufacturer and customer. The
           language symbol which adequately describ-
           es a product, idea, or proposal may often
           be by algebra, differential equations, charts,
           diagrams, or cartoons. The product writers
           must also include ,the "how and the why"
           behind the apparatus being described. In
           addition, his information must be concise,
           clear, and within the grasp and experience
           of his readers.
  2. Writing with varying amounts of engineering con-
     ten't and a more general readership.
           These opportunities generally fall in the
           category of Technical Publicity. Those who
           prepare articles in this classification are
           called  Technical Editors or Publications
           Engineer. In general, these engineering jour-
           nalists are required to prepare, write and


           edit technical information   for the trade
           magazines or house organs. They are as-
           signed to a division or specific area where
           research is going on. They personally estab-
           lish contact with those performing the work
           and keep fully -abreast with the development.
           They seek items of interest to readers of
           the trade and technical journals. Not only
           do they gather information, prepare -the
           write-ups, but also plan the publicity and
           direct the taking of photographs. In short,
           the Technical Editor works with a story
           from concept through actual printing and
           proof-reading.
  3. Writing which contains      technical information
     slanted toward sales promotion and advertising.
           Technical trained writers in this category
           plan, create, and execute advertising and
           sales promotion programs. These men have
           the broad responsibility which directly ef-
           fects the sales of company products. MCich
           of their writing borders .the field of public
           relations.
     The opportunities mentioned above are only a few
of the writing assignments available in a world where
scientific discovery is common place. Other opportun-
ities include science writing for newspapers a*nd maga-
zines, science writing for television and radio, and free-
lance technical writing. Editors everywhere are com-
plaining about not having enough suitable science copy.
The broad field of science writing offers unlimited
opportunity to the writer who can interpret technical
achievements in common terms understandable to the
man on the street.
Qualifications Of A Technical Writer
     Just as technical writing varies in form and in
engineering content so do the qualifications of the writ-

                                                 "New ideas," Henry Thoreau wrote, "come
                                                 into the world . .. with a flash and an ex-
                                                 plosion and perhaps somebody's castle
                                                 roof perforated." Many a budding young
                                                 chemist has introduced his parents to
                                                 chemistry in similar fashion. But the real
                                                 making of a chemist takes place in quiet,
                                                 unspectacular little ways.
                                                 There is the challenge of a teacher who
                                                 asks two new questions for every one he
                                                 answers.
                                                 There is the mental sweat and labor of
                                                 working out a quantitative analysis-and
                                                 the glowing pride of being right, to the

                                                 There is the romance of chemistry writ-
                                                 ten wordlessly in the twinkle of an aging
                                                 professor's eye.
                                                 There is memorizing and mixing . . .
                                                 calculating and titrating and cramming.

er. Technical training is however considered to be a
prime requisite. Many companies insist that a man have
had formal engineering training or extensive experience.
Graduate engineers with industrial background are
'highly desirable. It is important that the writer gain
the confidence of those engineers actually engaged in
the project. Since these engineers are his chief source of
information, he must be able to talk their language.
Technical training also implies that the writer must be
able to think. Organized t:hought, before, during, and
after the writing process, is essential for intelligent
writing. Organized thinking is difficult, and this is per-
haps the main trouble with any writer. He must de-
cide which ideas are important, which can be left out,
which need explanation, and which do not.
     Another important qualification is journalistic skill.
The writer must be able to write simply, factually, and
interestingly. In order to express himself clearly, he
must have facility in handling words. The purpose of
every technical communication is 'to convey ideas and
information accurately and efficiently. This objective
requires that the writing be brief and easily under-
stood. It is also important that the technical writer
enjoy his work. He must like to write. Words are his
tools and he should use them with pleasure and skill.
     Other qualifications are originality, imagination,
and a healthy curiosity. The effectiveness of the writing
is greatly increased if it is pleasant, forceful, and easy
to read. In order that the article possess life and in-
terest, the writer must be original and imaginative. He
must also be able to sense a potential story which will
appeal to his audience. This quality is sometimes call-
ed having a "nose for news".
     A  friendly personality is another   qualification
which measures 'to a large degree the success of a
Technical writer. The writer must radiate confidence
and win friends. He must also employ a considerable


amount of tact and diplomacy in dealing with busy
scientists and engineers. In order to obtain accurate
and complete information, he must cooperate and plan
his personal contacts for convenience of others. These
attributes are of course important in any organization-
al activity.
Advantages Of A Technical Writing Career
     Each phase of engineering, research, development,
 production, or sales has its advantages and attractions.
 Each offers the engineer the opportunity for profes-
 sional development. This is particularly true in the
 field of technical writing. An excellent way of contin-
 uing his education, it enables the writer to keep fully
 informed in 'the area of his interest. Assignments re-
 quire the writing engineer to observe first hand the
 research, design, development, production, and opera-
 tion of a product or process. This over all scope of
 writing assignments is known as the "big picture"
 aspect of technical writing. Engineers today are becom-
 ing more and more specialized. However, the diverse
 nature of his work excludes the possibility of a writer
 becoming pigionholed, or specialized on one chassis
 one function, or one subassembly. In addition, techni-
 cal assignments call for association with leading author-
 ities in various fields. Information from the best minds
 in science and engineering passes through the writer's
 hands. From -the journalistic point of view, technical
 writing offers an outlet for written expression plus the
 satisfaction of adding to the world's storehouse of
 technical information. It also offers an opportunity to
 travel, and to attend important meetings. In addition
 ito these advantages, the salary range is comparable
 to other kinds of engineering.
     For those trained in engineering and science and
skilled in the art of writing, technical writing offers
unlimited opportunity. It is an open invitation and
,challenge for engineers to grow in t'heir profession. N

How John Peacock


                  met


      "White Alice"


John M. Peacock, B.S.E.         One of the huge tropospheric antennas used in the "White Alice"
in Mechanical Engineering,      project. These screens pick up the "scatter" of UHF radio signals
Princeton, '47.                 beamed from more than 150 miles away!


"I met 'White Alice' at Bell
tories," says John. "That's
the communications system


Telephone Labora-
the code name for
linking defense in-


stallations along 3100 miles of Alaskan borders.
  "Laboratories people had made a basic survey
to determine the kind of system needed. I was
assigned to the group that developed tropo-
spheric antennas for over-the-horizon UHF
radio transmission.
  "Besides the usual critical problems involved
in systems of this sort, we had some extraordi-
nary factors to deal with, too. There were prob-
lems of snow. The structures had to withstand
150-mile-an-hour winds. And research showed
that in the Arctic up to sixteen inches of ice
could accumulate on the antennas. We had to
design them to be strong enough to support
this weight without collapsing. But the antenna
would not function properly with this much ice


on its face, so a de-icing system was devised to
limit that ice to an inch or less.
  "We had to work fast, on a very tight time
schedule, in order to beat Alaska's winter close-
in. And we did. From start to finish, 'White
Alice' was an exciting and interesting project.
But now I'm working on another over-the-
horizon radio system that's just as absorbing.
By the way-it's to be in Florida!"

Engineer with Bell Telephone Laboratories

Frank Kovalcik, Purdue'48, Covered 24,000 Miles in

     1956 as Western Editor of ELECTRICAL WORLD


F YOU'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE, you think of an
    editor as a man who's "chair-borne" most of the
    time ... tied to a desk at an indoor job.
  Nothing could be further from the facts when it's
a McGraw-Hill editor you're thinking about. Frank
Kovalcik, Western Editor of McGraw-Hill's
ELECTRICAL WORLD Magazine, can quickly tell
you that. He's anything but a desk man ... covers
11 states and part of Canada. Frank says:
  "In 1956, I made eight major field trips, covered
close to 24,000 miles. I was underground in a trans-
former vault in Los Angeles, inside a diversion tun-
nel in Idaho, atop a steel transmission tower in
northern California. Projects visited included The
Dalles multi-purpose project, Hoover Dam, Hells
Canyon, and even behind the scenes (electrically) at
the Republican National Convention. But none of
them can touch the "Operation CUE" A-Bomb test
I covered a year ago!
  "My chance to witness the detonation of a nuclear
device came when the Federal Civil Defense Admin-
istration and the A.E.C. decided to test non-military
effects of the blast. I reported on what happened to
electrical utility lines and equipment."
  (Frank wouldn't say so, but his story set a record ...
from explosion to editorial pages in four days! The
pictures at right were part of his original coverage of
this fast-breaking-"hot"-news story for his maga-
zine.)
    McGraw-Hill As A Place to Work
Frank can tell you about this, too:
  "My first editorial job-with the Purdue Expo-
nent in college-didn't use my engineering training,
but it showed me the way to communicate what's
new in engineering ... to report and interpret the
work of engineers for the benefit of other engineers.

  "When I got my B.S. in E.E. I started with
ELECTRICAL WORLD in New York. Within a year
I was promoted to Assistant Editor and made re-
sponsible for a department of the magazine. Before
the big jump to San Francisco as Western Editor in
'54 I served briefly as assistant to the managing
editor.
  "As Western Editor my search for news takes me
into all important phases of the electric utility indus-
try-and into association with top management and
engineering men. Working with them is a constant
reminder that the choice of an engineering-editorial
career was the right one for me."

It is a store where an oil man may
come in with a "want" list and buy
goods worth several mink coats. It
may stand on the outskirts of a big
city and sell nothing that the city
uses. Or it may do $20,000 a week
from a country crossroads location.
   It is a National Supply store, one
 of 128 scattered through the oil fiels
 of the U. S., Canada and Venezuela.
 It sells virtually everything needed to
 drill for oil and get it out of the ground.
   Young Man on the Move--The
 store manager has his hands full.
 Inventory to control. Oil field news to
 keep up with. A crew of men to
 handle. Customers to see. A good-
 sized building to keep in shape. It's
 his baby and his judgment can make
 or break his store.
   A big job for a young man? Yes.
 But young men who are able often
 get big jobs to handle at National
 Supply. It's a fast-moving business-
 and a fast-growing one. We now have
 six manufacturing plants, offices or



54


agents in 24 countries, 800 distribu-
tors for our pipe and electrical con-
duit, over 1,700 people selling our
oil field products, almost 10,000 em-
ployees, sales of close to $260 million
a year and a new division handling
products for general industry. There
are lots of places for a young man
to go.

National Supply conducts a search
for twenty-five exceptional college
graduates. Accountants, industrial
management majors, salesmen and
engineers-men who want responsi-
bility, who prefer to move up rather
than vegetate. For those interested in
a general business career there is a


broad nine months training program
which includes indoctrination lec-
tures, field assignments and plant
visitations. For the engineer who
seeks the challenge of product design
there is a longer range development
program embracing indoctrination,
plant and field experience. In either
case, they will be men who are at-
tracted by National Supply's growth
possibilities.

    Joseph Schuler will be graduated in June with a B. S. in Electrical En-
gineering. Joe gained experience in technical writing last summer while
working in the Technical Manual Section of Hughes Aircraft Co. Besides
working for two summers with the Pennsylvania Railroad as a Journeyman
Electrician, he has held a job as a part-time Physics Lab Instructor. Joe's
activities at Pitt include membership in Phi Eta Sigma, Sigma Tau, E & M
Cabinet, and president of Eta Kappa Nu.







                     OUR GRADUATING SENIORS
     Four seniors are graduating from the staff of the SKYSCRAPER this
 semester. Mitch Kozikowski, Editor-in-Chief; Tom Tarolli, Associate Editor;
 Jack Albert, Managing Editor; and Rich Jackson, Business Manager, have
 worked on their last issue. Under their leadership and assistance, this magazine
 has enjoyed its greatest successes.
     Fortunately, there will be underclassmen to replace them and who will be
 able to do Jack's job of controlling, Tom's job of editing, writing and pasting-
 up, and Dick's and Mitch's job of overall supervision. The staff and the school
 thank these men -for their help and we hope that. they have enjoyed working
 with us as much as we have enjoyed their comradeship. Good luck and thanks.


           STEAM

AND THE WORLD'S

LARGEST BAKERY

This new boiler plant at Nabisco's huge
Chicago bakery was planned to provide,
efficiently and economically, the steam
that the bakery must have on tap at all
times for heat, hot water and various
processing operations.
  Because the reliability, efficiency and
economy of its steam source are so vital
to this world-famous company, they
selected B&W boilers.
  Think a moment of most companies'
use of steam-and its cost. Take a fast
turn around a boiler plant. Spend a
little time chatting-perhaps quite prof-
itably-with engineers. Get the facts on
a company's invested steam dollars in
relation to the return they're getting. If
the facts add up to problems, B &W en-
gineers can and will help industrial com-
panies and their consulting engineers
solve these problems.
   When a B&W boiler is chosen, long-
range performance is assured. And isn't
that what the buyer really wants? Not the
boiler but its end product, the steam,
and the assurance of an efficient, de-
pendable, economical steam source. The


service records of thousands of B&W
boilers, in thousands of large, small and
medium   sized industrial and utility
plants, supply that assurance.

      skyscraper notes

   The article on Samuel P. Langley is a con-
tinuation of our "Great Men From Pitt" series
which was started in our last issue with the
article on Fessenden. Langley, who was one of
the first men to experiment with heavier-than-
air craft, was a professor in Astronomy at Pitt
in 1886.


  The SKYSCRAPER        ENGINEER     would
like to publicize the accomplishments df the
Engineering and Mines Cabinet this past
year. Lowell Tarbett, E & M Cabinet presi-
dent, has summarized the activities of the cab-
inet so that the student body will become aware
of how the Cabinet affects them.



   At the beginning of this school year the edi-
 tors of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER set
 goals which they desired to attain. At that
 time it was felt that by better orginization and
 new systems the magazine could be improved
 and become one of the best technical maga-
 zines in the country.
   During the year the SKYSCRAPER EN-
 GINEER received enough advertising to be
 able to publish a bigger book. Therefore, the
 student body had the advantage of being able
 to read more technical articles, features about
 events at Pitt, and information concerning new
 -happenings in the Engineering field. But this
 was not the only aim of the New Skyscraper.
 The editors wanted to give the student body
 a magazine that they could be proud of and
 one that they wanted to read.
 To cariy out this plan the staff stressed lay-
 out, accurate and concise writing, and variety
 in subject material for articles and features.
The SKYSiCRAPER ENGINEER achieved a
"New Look"; one of which the school, the stud-
ent body, and the staff of the magazine could
be proud.








      in the next issue

 -Bob Ferber in his article titled Tele-Cam
 describes his invention and its operation. The
 Tele-Cam will eliminate many imperfections
 in TV reproduction, and the article will prove
 to be interesting reading. At this time Bob has
 a patent pending on this invention.

Blades for record breaking turbine-generator.


  RECORD BREAKING TURBINE GENERATOR
     One of the largest turbine blades of its type in
 the world is being forged under a 23,000 pound forg-
 ing hammer at the Westinghouse metals development
 plant at Blairsville, Pa. Heated to 2,000 degrees Faren-
 heit, the white-hot stainless steel blade is shaped by
 hammer blows equal to 475,000 foot-pounds, an impact
 roughly equivalent to that from a 320 pound weight fall
 falling from the top of the Empire State Building.
     Measuring 44 inches in length, the blade for the

           QUARTZ INFRARED LAMP

     In two and one half years the smallest, hottest elec-
trical heat source on the market, the General Electric
tubular quartz infrared lamp, has developed almost un-
believeable versality. This lamp, three-eights of an
inch in diameter, comes in lighted lengths of 5, 10, 16,
25, 38, and 50 inches at 100 watts per inch.
     Its applications, according to the manufacturer, are
legion. It is used for cooking and food warming, but it
is also used by railroads and machine shops for shrink-
fitting pinions and bearings. It is used in the printing
industry to set ink in high presses. In the textile in-
dustry 'this radiant energy source, with other drying
facilities, speeds up and improves textile processing
It also bakes lacquers, enamels, and varnishes in a
fraction of the time required by other 'baking processes.
    The versatility of the quartz infrared lamp is due
to its small size, high operating temperature, and
a)bility to withstand the shock of violent temperature
changes. The lamp is designed to last more than 5000
hours.

days of work.
  The newest - and largest - electronic "brain"
(more accurately, electronic data processing sys-
tem) is Bizmac, developed by RCA.
  Bizmac is quickly becoming one of the most
powerful allies of business and industry. It "reads,"
sorts, catalogs, analyzes, calculates, forecasts-re-
duces months of paper work to seconds-cuts costs
by millions!
  For insurance companies, Bizmac can keep its
finger on millions of facts daily. It can help depart-


ment stores keep split-second inventory control.
And for the U. S. Army, it keeps track of literally
billions of ordnance parts all over the world.
  The leadership in electronic research that made
Bizmac possible is inherent in all RCA products

NICE WORK ON A

HOT SUMMER DAY


THE temperature at altitudes of 36,000 feet and above
goes far below zero, so it's standard procedure to demon-
strate the starting capabilities of modern jet aircraft engines
in a man-made "climate" of a brisk minus 670F.
  At Allison, demonstration tests are run periodically on
both military and commercial aircraft engine models in
cold weather tanks like the one shown above.
  And, how do they get the tank's inside temperature
down to the required 670 below zero? Here is one way
Allison engineers do it. Outside air is cooled first with
air-to-water heat exchangers. Then, a mechanical refrig-
eration system takes the air temperature to below zero.
For the third step, the cold air is run through a turbine
section of an Allison T-38 engine. As the gas expands, it
comes out at about a minus 130'F. There is some warm-
ing as the air is piped to the cold tank, but usually, warm
air has to be added to bring the tank temperature UP
to a minus 670 Fahrenheit!


  Fuel and oil tanks are located inside the test chamber,
and they-with the engine-are permitted to "soak" in
the frigid temperature before firing up. Tests of 72 hours
"soak" duration have been made on Allison Prop-jet
engines. Of course, the front opening is clamped shut for
the test, and performance is checked by remote controls.
But, occasionally, it's necessary for an engineer to "bundle
up" and go inside the cell. It's nice summer work.

Allison now is in the midst of an engineering expansion
and development program representing an expenditure of
$75 million. Completion of the program will make the
Allison engineering Research and Development Center
one of the most complete in the world . .. an ideal place

Nickel Progress Report


Panel caving is one of two bulk mining
methods which account for 70 per cent
of the company's total nickel output.


A crack at the earth's surface shows bulk mining is proceeding far underground.



    Once only"waste rock'"..

now a new source of Nickel


How Inco's mine engineers
utilize a panel-caving method
in order to recover nickel from
huge ore deposits that formerly
were not practicable to mine
Panel caving is one of the newest
mining methods put into use by The
International Nickel Company.'
  The tonnage of ore handled by this
method is immense. Sometimes a
single block measures 200 by 800
feet. It may weigh as much as 11/2
million tons.
  As these heavy masses move down-
ward they break into pieces small
enough to drop through chutes and
into machine crushers deep inside


the mine. From crushers the ore goes
a quarter mile by conveyor to hoists
that lift it to the mine head.
  From there, the ore is milled as
fine as sand. The concentrate is then
pumped to the Inco reduction plant
7/ miles away.
  Panel mining; new concentrating
machinery; new, continuously im-
proved operating practices; pipeline
transport. Add them together and
you can see how they make possible

mine. The heavy panel of ore and rock
sinks, breaking up as it moves down.


   Which Mining Method is BEST?
   There is no one best method of
   getting ore out of the ground.
   Type of ore; type of rock; even
   the location of the mine must
   be weighed. Inco uses five
   underground mining methods
   at Sudbury:
      Square Set Cut and Fill
      Shrinkage Blasthole
          Panel Caving

  Inco has prepared a full-color

shows the operations of modern
nickel mines. 16mm prints are loaned
for showings before technical soci-
eties, engineering classes of univer-
sities and industrial organizations.

...at CRUCIBLE


None of the exciting technical promises for the future can come true without
parallel developments in many fields. And the field of special steels is especially
important-for almost everything that's made is either made of or made by
a special steel.
  Crucible is the nation's,foremost producer of special steels, including tool
and high speed, alloy and stainless, magnet and spring, and many, many others.
Also, through its affiliates, Crucible produces titanium products and vacuum-
melted alloys-products whose modern applications have only scratched the
surface.

..on economy in national defense


"The widespread belief that there is an inherent conflict
of interest between those who put national security first
on the one hand and the taxpayer and his cost-conscious
representatives on the other is simply erroneous - except
when the level of the national security budget is at issue.
Once the budget level has been fixed, the choice of
weapons which maximizes our military capability is logi-


cally equivalent to the choice which minimizes the cost
of attaining that capability. Moreover, the weapon
characteristics so chosen are typically similar at different
budget levels. In these circumstances economy and mili-
tary effectiveness are not opposing objectives to be com-
promised: they are different but equivalent aspects of the
same national objective."
      -Charles Hitch, Head of the Economics Division

                  How to make the most
                  of your engineering career
                  ONE OF A SERIES




      go where engineering


in   teresting              It's basic that you'll get more fun
                            out of working on interesting
                  projects than on stodgy ones. So it makes
                  sense to choose a company and an industry
                  in which you'll draw engineering assignments
                  that give you excitement-and professional
                  satisfaction. That way, you'll get more fun
                  out of life, and advance faster, too.
                  It just so happens that Boeing offers you
                  assignments on some of the most interesting
                  projects in the country. For instance-an
                  advanced supersonic guided missile weapon
                  system; the 707, America's first jet transport;
                  the revolutionary B-52 eight-jet nuclear
                  weapons carrier; the KC-135 jet transport-
                  tanker, and top-secret research projects.
                  There's a whole world of opportunity for you
                  at Boeing, in research, design, manufacturing
                  or service. Boeing's growth (400 % more
                  engineers today than 10 years ago) creates
                  an expanding need-and long-range
                  opportunities-for engineers of all kinds:
                  electrical, mechanical, civil, aeronautical,
                  industrial, or related fields, and for
                  mathematicians and physicists.
                  At Boeing you'll enjoy high starting salaries,
                  career stability, retirement and pension plans,
                  company-paid opportunities for graduate
        3 *study, and a host of additional benefits!
