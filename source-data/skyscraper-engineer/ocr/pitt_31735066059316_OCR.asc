SPECIAL BI CENT’-’—-N

 

SKYSCRAPER NOTES

Pittsburgh is celebrating its bi-
centennial, and SKYSCRAPER
joins in the festivities by oﬂering you
this Bicentennial Issue.

This issue is an atempt to offer
what we think are the main engi-
neering accomplishments in Pitts-
burgh—past and present. Obviously
the entire engineering accomplish-
ments of one city throughout two-
hundred years cannot be fully told
in, one magazine. This issue is, then,
only what we think are the main
highlights of engineering,

Once we had selected the topics
for this Bicentennial Issue, the re-
cruitment of authors was no prob-
lem. SKYSCRAPER staff members
were igven -the task of preparing
the two-page essays which appear on
the following pages.

For any major Renaissance pro-
gram there is usually one effort
which symbolizes the entire project.
Here in Pittsburgh it is the develop-
ment of Point Park. Paul Segas re-
lates the history of the point which
in itself is a history of the City.
With the opening of the Fort Pitt
Bridge next summer and the event-
ual completion of Fort Duquesne
Bridge, Point Park will continue to
symbolize Pittsburgh’s Renaissance.

Akin to Pittsburgh’s. Point Devel-
opment is the education necessary
to perpetuate the City’s ‘eminence
in engineering. The University of

Pittsburgh and Carnegie Institute of
Technology have in the past and

will in the future continue to be
leaders in the ﬁeld of education.
Richard Johnston prepared the essay
dealing with 200 years of education
in Pittsburgh.

The application of knowledge ac-
quired in the City’s Universities was
put to a challenge years ago with
the problem of smoke control. Not
too many years ago, Pittsburgh was
drifting, and Pittsburghers were
creatures of defense—apologizing for
the smoke, the floods, and the apathy
among i-ts public leaders and inﬂuen-
tial citizens. The story is related by
John Hammer of the realization and
eventual conquering of the smoke
control problem.

Not only smoke control, but other
engineering problems were tackled
in the City’s environs. As a result of
this, Pittsburgh has come to be
known as a leader in industrial re-
search. Bob Whetzel summarizes the
tremendous facilities which Pitts-
burgh industries have set aside for
research.

Although it is not a product of
laboratory research, transportation
within a large metropolitan city is a
problem for the engineer. Joe Matesa
describes the many road systems in
the area and the gigantic projects
which will make access to the City
much easier in the future.

An entire book could be written
on the many industries which have

AiResearch engineered and produced
this electro-hydraulic servo system-
the most reliable and responsive
steering control system for missiles
yet produced. Extremely lightweight,
it consists of three control valves and
six actuators.

This unique system represents but
a part of the challenging, important
work under way at AiResearch in
missile, electronic, nuclear, aircraft
and industrial ﬁelds.

Speciﬁc opportunities exist in sys-
tem electronics and servo control
units; computers and flight instru-
ments; missile auxiliary power units;
gas turbine engines and turbine and
air motors; cryogenic and nuclear
systems; pneumatic valves; indus-
trial turbochargers; air conditioning
and pressurization; and heat trans-
fer, including electronic cooling and
nuclear applications.

Intensified engineering is con-

ducted by small groups where indi-
vidual effort and accomplishment are
quickly recognized, providing oppor-
tunity for rapid growth and advance-
ment. An eight-month orientation
program is offered prior to perma-
nent assignment to help determine
your placement from a variety of
analytical or development projects.

Advanced education is available
through company ﬁnancial assistance
at outstanding nearby universities.

THE CONQUEST OF INNER SPACE

There is no question about it, man is going to con-
quer outer space. As this is being written the Russians
have successfully launched a rocket which is the ﬁrst
object ever to completely leave the earth’s gravitational
ﬁeld. The Sputniks, the Vanguards, the Explorers, the
Pioneers and the Atlas all were forced sufficiently far
away so as to orbit around the earth at great distances,
but the “Lunik” is the ﬁrst to ever depart completely
from the earth’s influence.

The Russians are to be congratulated. Not only was
this a tremendous feat in itself, but when one considers
that the last stage of “Lunik” weighed 3,245 pounds and
that it was shot at a moving target 220,000 miles away,
the accomplishment is fantastic. Even with all the vari-
ables of distances and velocities, “Lunik” passed within
5,0.00 miles of its target, the moon. Had it been another
1,000 miles closer, the rocket would have orbited
around the moon as planned and the experiment would
have been a complete success. Instead, “Lunik” is doom-
ed to travel around the sun some 93,000,000 miles away
through alleternity.

Putting man in space, orbiting around the moon and
traveling through space on controlled schedules and
charted routes, is inevitable. It requires only time for
these achievements to be accomplished.

Scientiﬁc developments con-tinue all over the world
at an accelerating rate. It has been said many times
that the airplane is shrinking the world. Now the rocket
is shrinking the universe.

In spite of these tremendous scientiﬁc developments,
man is still living in the “horse and buggy” clays inso-
far as many social, national and international problems
are concerned. Science, engineering and world trade
are doing more to break down the language barriers
in the world than all the politicians put together.

One is forced to agree with Sydney Harris, Pittsburgh
Post Gazet-te’s columnist when he said that “Man’s Es-
sential Need is a Conquest of Inner Space.” With the
conquest of all the space on elarth completed and the
conquest of outer space assured, it is time for man to
turn his thoughts inward. Otherwise, international dif-
ﬁculties will be encountered which are beyond our com-
prehension.

We should at least know our own beliefs before we
try to evaluate those of other peoples. Throughout the
world, we are currently chlampioning the causes of na-
tions living under feudalisms, dictatorships, colonies,
federations of states, and democracies. Surely, we do
not believe in all of these forms of government.‘

Perhaps we should start by saying that we would
actively support any government which establishes free-

dom of speech and la free press, freedom of the ballot,
free education and child labor laws.

These and other freedoms have been expounded many
times by our political leaders, but not all are yet in
vogue in our own country. Further, we are supporting
countries which still practice slavery and in which child
labor laws are a very long Vvay off. Yes, Harris is right.
The conquest of inner space must be the next frontier.
Perhaps the methods used by scientists and engineers
would help. I

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS
from Donald W Douglas, Jr.

President, Douglas Aircraft Company

You may wonder What the future holds for the
engineer who_ decides to build his career in the
aircraft/missile industry.

In terms of permanent demand, this industry
probably requires a greater proportion of engi-
neers to total personnel than any other. Here at
Douglas we are now employing more engineers
than we did during World War II.

In regard to professional standing, the air-
craft/missile industry deals always with the

latest state of the art in every engineering and
scientiﬁc. specialty involved. Its engineers are in
one of the best informed and highest prestige
ﬁelds in their profession.

Whatever your present activity, if you decide
to move into aircraft, missile and space tech-
nology, we would like to hear from you.

Please write to Mr. C. C. LaVene,

PROGRESS AT THE POINT

, BY PAUL J. SEGAS, EE ’60

When General John Forbes occupied the French Fort
Duquesne for the British on November 26, 1758 he shap-
ed the destiny of the entire United States. This occupa-
tion eﬂectively ended French domination in the New
World. In so doing, it meant that Americans would, in
generations to come, speak English instead of French.
It meant -that they would develop different concepts of
government, different cultures and different customs.
In the two hundred years since this historic event, Pitts-
burgh has continued to play an important role in the
shaping of the nation.

When Forbes entered the region in 1758 there was
not even a crossroads settlement. All that was left of the
French fort consisted of a pile of smoking rubble.
Forbes wrote to his Prime Minister, William Pitt, in
London informing him that he had named the region
Pittsburgh in his honor.

Immediately, General Forbes began the construction
of a new fort, one of the long line of forts extending
from Maine to the Carolinas. Fort Pitt was to garrison
troops for the protection of settlers moving westward.
Settlers began moving into the area, turning the wood-
lands into farmlands. This alarmed the Indians and pro-
voked raids on the settlements surrounding the fort.

By 1763 these raids were becoming so costly that the
commander of the fort ordered all buildings destroyed
and -the settlers into the fort.

After Colonel Bouquet’s victory over the Indians in
1764 at the battle of Bushy Run, the people of Pitts-
burgh began to rebuild their city. Also, in 1764 Colonel
Bouquet ordered the building of a brick redoubt as addi-
tional protection for the people at the point. This block-
house stands today as the only visible part of the mili-
tary establishment that once commanded the head of the
Ohio River. With the additional protection, the point
became the stopping place for travelers both on land
and on the rivers. It was in this era that Pittsburgh be-
came the true Gateway -to the West. Supplies for the

14

West were carried over the mountains on pack horses
or wagons and then shipped down the Ohio on ﬂatboats
or keelboats.

Fort Pitt meanwhile fell into disrepair and was sold.
Renewed Indian trouble, however, made a fort once
again necessary, and the government built Fort Fayette
in 1792. By 1794 Pittsburgh was ﬁnally free from Indian
attack, and this fort went the way of its predecessors.

With the threat of Indians gone, the‘city began in
the early 1800’s to develop the many resources which
were to help make it one of the leading industrial centers
of the nation. The abundant coal which had been used
in homes in the area for many years was now in great
demand. Not only did it ﬁre the furnaces in the budding
factories in Pittsburgh but it was also shipped to east-
ern markets.

Early in the 1800’s this coal was put to use in the
iron industry. A small iron works in 1828 was the
father of the great steel industry which thrives in Pitts-
burgh -today.

During this period, too, there were about sixteen
glass plants ﬂourishing in the City. This was the begin-
ning of another great industry in Pittsburgh. In addition
to these major indus-tries, other small ventures aided
in the development of the City. Foods were processed
in the factory instead of the home. Textiles also began
to appear as factory made instead of home made.
Shoes, groceries, drugs, hardware, jewelry, dry goods
and candies are only a few of the long list of businesses
which ﬂourished in this era of rapid progress for the
city.

Perhaps the progress was just a little too rapid, though.
The smoke rising from homes and the new factories
combined with fog and covered the city with a dark
cloud that earned for Pittsburgh the name of Smoky
City, a title that fit the city well for more than a cen-
tury.

By 1860 the population of the City was approaching

WHO WOULD KNOW that in 1760 the junction of these
rivers would develop into a great industrial center, Pitts-
burgh?

50,000 and her industries were becoming nationally
prominent. It remained only for the civil war to stimu-
late the iron and steel and coal and coke industries into
this position of prime importance. The government-
owned arsenals began turning out weapons and am-
munition from the vast industrial facilities and experi-
ence of Pittsburgh. Other factories turned out other
vitally needed materials for a nation at war. Pittsburgh
produced to capacity and cooperated wholeheartedly
in the winning of the war to secure our freedom. As a
result of her wartime production Pittsburgh became
a true industrial giant.

In the postwar years -the City was slow in progressing
but she continued to produce the vital goods for which
she had become nationally known.

During the ﬁnal twenty years of the nineteenth cen-
tury, however, such names as Carnegie, Phipps, West-
inghouse, and Heinz made permanent contributions
to the progress of the city. Under the leadership of such
prominent and energetic men Steel plants sprang up
all along the rivers. Railroads and telegraph lines, oil
refineries, glass making plants all became part of the
changing Pittsburgh scene.

An unfortunate consequence of the progress, however,
was the ever increasing shroudvof smoke and fog which
constantly hung over the City. By the beginning of the
twentieth century it seemed as if Pittsburgh was choking
itself with the fruits of its labor. Buildings which had
outlived their usefulness were not torn down when they
should have been. The rivers overﬂowed their banks
much too often causing great damage. Buildings had
acquired a heavy layer of dirt and smoke from indus-
try. During the opening years of the twentieth century
it looked as if Pittsburgh were on the long downhill
road of obscurity. It took a great catastrophe to awak-
en Pittsburghers to the fact that steps had to be taken
to keep Pittsburgh on a par with leading civic and
industrial centers of the nation.

AN ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH shows the proposed
development of -the point with the original site of the
Blockhouse indicated in the center.

On St. Patrick’s Day, 1936, the rivers overﬂowed
their banks, sending silt-laden water into the Golden
Triangle. The Hood crested at 46 feet, the worst ﬂood in
a long series which had plagued the City since 1762.
Damage totalled $94 million dollars. The City was left
under a thick crust of mud and silt.

In 1946 it was announced that a State Park would
be built on the site of the historically rich point. On
May 18, 1950, the huge steel ball crashed into a building
at the point signalling the start of demolition for Point
State Park. All through the Golden Triangle old build-
ings began to give way to progress. Civic, industrial and
private leaders cooperated in -the program which was
designed to make Pittsburgh a model for the entire
nation. I

ENGINEERING EDUCATION

Expansion and change has affected Pittsburgh’s two
Engineering Universities, the University of Pittsburgh
and Carnegie Institute of Technology, just as they have
changed the Pittsburgh skyline. This expansion and
change has affected curriculum as well as campus.

Pitt has come a long way since the days of 1787, when
the log cabin college was chartered as the Pittsburgh
Academy. Through the years the name changed to
Western University of Pennsylvania and ﬁnally to the
University of Pittsburgh. Now the University has a
campus of more than 40 buildings (including the Health
Center) and an enrollment of 16,000 students.

Under the reigns of Chancellor Litchﬁeld the Univer-
sity is undergoing a 100,000,00.0 dollar expansion pro-
gram. Never before in the history of education has such
an ambitious program been undertaken. It will encom-
pass every phase of University life.

The first step in the expansion program was the ac-
quisition of the Schenley Hotel and Schenley Apart-
ments to be used for student activities and faculty and
student dormatories. Chancellor Litchﬁeld envisions a

possible revamping of Forbes Avenue and the demoli-
tion of Forbes Field. In the present location of Forbes
Field, Pitt will build a library building, and additional
buildings to house the Schools of Business Administra-
,tion, Retailing, Law, Education, Social Work and the
Graduate School of Public and International Affairs.

Engineering students do not directly beneﬁt from this
Forbes Areia expansion, but they are receiving new lab-
oratories and buildings. The Electrical and Chemical
Engineering Departments will move to remodeled medi-
cal buildings behind Pitt Stadium. These buildings are
now being remoleded and should be ready for occupancy
by late June of this year.

The Electrical Department has received a analog-
computer from the Atomic Energy Commission, Divi-
sion of Reactor development. The Mechanical Depart-
ment has recently received almost 120,000 dollars from
the same commission for studies in heat loops and allied
reactor developments. Other departments, the Chemical
and Metallurgical, have either received or asked for
grants from the commission. The University to date has
received over 200,000 dollars and may soon receive
150,000 dollars for addtional equipment and 50.,000
dollars worth of nuclear materials. These new facilities
are for the use of both graduate and undergnaduate
students. The Commission granted the funds with the
hope that more students, graduate and undergraduate,
would become interested in‘ nuclear engineering. Mas-
ter of Science Degrees are now being offered at Pitt in
electrical, mechanical, chemical and metallurgical
nuclear engineering.

Across the ravine on the edges of Schenley Park, Car-
negie Institute of Technology is expanding its horizons
beyond the dreams of its founder Andrew Carnegie.

The city donated the land for Carnegie Tech in 1905.
In April of that year, ground was broken for the ﬁrst
building, Industries Hall, which already has had exten-
sions added to it.

Today Tech graduates are scattered all over the world
with backgrounds stemming out of the College of Engi-

industries.

neering and Science, the Carnegie Library School, the
College of Fine Arts, the Division of Humanistic and
Social Studies, the Graduate School of Industrial Ad-
ministration, the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College
and the School of Printing Management.

In the next ten years Carnegie Tech will spend an
estimated 24,350,000 dollars to give their campus a
major ﬁace-lifting. The new Hunt Library will unite
Tech’s scattered library facilities into one steel and alum-
inum, three story structure. Mr. and Mrs. Roy A. Hunt
made a gift of 2,800,000 dollars for the construction of
the library. It will be erected early in 1960 on the site
now occupied by Skibo, the old aeronautical engineering
building erected during World War I, and later convert-
ed into a cafeteria.

The Hunt Library will face a long, straight, land-
scaped mall, extending from Frew Street, through the
campus to Forbes Avenue. A new 2,000,000 dollar Activ-
ities Building will be erected to the right of the mall,
near the present hump, which will be cut down and lev-
eled into the Tech Bowl, a new athletic ﬁeld.

The long range plant also includes another engineer-
ing Ia-nd science building and a ﬁne arts center.

The highlight of the bicentennial year for both Pitt’s
and Tech’s engineering school will be the 67th Annual
Meeting of the American Society of Engineering. Pitt
and Tech will host the convention which will be held
in Pittsburgh June 15 to 19.

The Society, founded in 1893, maintained its national
offices on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh
from 1914 to 1947. It is an organization of individual
and institutional members. The interests of the individwal
members are coordinated under a General Council; the
activities of the institutional members, through the Engi-
neering College Administrative Council and the Engi-
neering College Research Council.

The ASEE has twenty-two Divisions and la number of
Committees which represent various professional branch-
es of science, engineering, and related ﬁelds. The Divi-
sions and Committees arrange the technical program

FEBRUARY 1959

of the annual meeting and are responsible for much of
the technical work of the society. A number of studies
of ﬁar-reaching importance to engineering colleges and
the educational profession have been conducted through
Division and Committee activities.

An ASEE meeting with co-hosts is unusual in the his-
tory of the society. The meetings themselves are normal-
ly held on the campus of the host institution. Headquar-
ters for the 67th Annual Meeting of the ASEE will be
in the University of Pittsburgh’s Schenley Union. The
majority of those attending will be housed in the resi-
dence halls of Pitt, Tech, and Chatham College.

In any discussion of engineering and scientiﬁc edu-
cation, D.uquesne University must be mentioned. Al-
though Duquesne University does not have an engineer-
ing school as such, it has an outstanding science depart-
ment.

Duquesne was founded in 1878 on the corner of Wylie
Avenue and Fernando Street as the Pittsburgh Catholic
College of the Holy Ghost, and did not move to the bluff
until 1885. In 1911 the institution was granted a charter
and changed its name to Duquesne University. In 1913
D.uquesne acquired the distinction of being the ﬁrst
Catholic co-educational college in the country.

Since 1935 Trinity Hall, Assumption Hall and Rock-
well Hall have been erected. On the seventy-ﬁfth anni-
versary of the school a building goal of 13,500,000
dollars was announced. This money was to be used to
build a dormitory for male students, a large addtion to
the library, a hall of science, a student union building,
a ﬁeld house, an additional classroom building and a
chapel.

It is the only college in Pittsburgh today that uses
closed circuit television in some of its classwork.

The progressive spirit of the city of Pittsburgh is
matched, if not outshined, by the expansion and re-
vamping of curriculum of the Colleges and Universities
in Pittsburgh. This progressive spirit is making the
Golden Triangle, not only an industrial center, but an
outstanding educational center I

DUQUESNE UNIVERSITY, which overlooks the Golden
Triangle, plans a major rejuvenation in the near future.

SMOKE CONTROL

BY JOHN E. HAMMER, EE ’60

In the regeneration of Pittsburgh, one of the prime
requisites was the elimination of smoke. If tall build-
ings and new construction were to transform the City,
it must ﬁrst have a clean face.

A few years ago, Pittsburgh was known as the “Smoky

City.” Today, Pittsburgh has lost that name as a
glance about the City will prove. Visitors coming here
for the first time ﬁnd it hard to realize how black and
dirty Pittsburgh once was. There are occasional fogs
and mists, but there has been no smog in Pittsburgh
for several years. The United States Weather Bureau
credits Pittsburgh with having reduced its smoke of six
or eight years ago by over 94- percent.

So many visitors come here and so many letters are
received asking how this was accomplished, that perhaps
a few words in explanation might be of interest.

The ﬁrst and most important undertaking was to

‘arouse the average citizens interest in smoke abatement.

This was brought about by popularization through news
articles, radio talks, lectures, citizens clubs, etc., telling
the advantages that a smokeless city could have for the
public. This meant continuous work by enthusiastic
groups and civic minded people.

Once the general mass of citizens really wanted
smoke elimination, it meant an ordinance to further
their wishes. The committee appointed by the Mayor
to draw up the ordinance called for open meetings to
discuss its provisions which still further increased the
public interest until Pittsburgh literally became smoke
conscious and this has lasted and is true today. The
few who did not want it were overruled by the many
who did. Ordinances had been drawn before, but they
failed because they never had the public solidly be-
hind them. Such backing brought cooperation. Some
groups in industry or trades that were originally oppos-
ed, changed their attitude.

Just as important as the ordinance itself was the
method used in its application. Smoke inspectors must
be able to help and advise the owner of a smoking plant.

An inspector is not a policeman but a combustion engi-
neer. Unreasonable enforcement breeds antagonism.
Smoke is not stopped in the court room; it is stopped
in the ﬁre box. Unaccountable millions in dollars and
cents were lost in the migrating of industry and popu-
lation from Pittsburgh due to the smoke menace. Con.-
Vince a man he is losing money up a smoking stack
and you don’t: need enforcement.Very little legal action
has been necessary as the records over past years show.

A set of legal restrictions is, of course, necessary and
Pittsburgh’s ordinance has been a very successful one.
It has the necessary teeth in it and yet over the years
has proved that it is workable in practice. Some of
its technical features and engineering details are ex-
plained in the following paragraphs.

Two hard-hitting ordinances, one by the city and one
by Allegheny County, now regulate the density of
smoke. Use of smokeless coal is a must. Virtually all
industry has installed mechanical ﬁltering devices. The
sun shines again. The sky is clear.

In retrospect, -the smoke situation existed not because
of one or two acting elements but by the compounding
of many causes. Among them were the following: In-
efﬁcient combustion of heating fuels, inadequate disposal
of industrial wastes in the form of smoke and soot, poor
incinerating of residential was-tes, and railroads.

In the early days of smoke elimination perhaps the
most troublesome problem was to control the great
volume of smoke sent into the atmosphere by the large
number of steam locomotives then in use everywhere.

As late as 1945, Diesels were practically unknown on
the railroads. They were considered too light in weight
to give adequate traction. The electric diesel has over-
come this by utilizing the weight of the train and provid-
ing motors on car axles.

The Pittsburgh ordinance permit-ted a steam locomo-
tive to emit dense smoke for one minute in any one
hour. This is a very severe restriction and many said
it hampered the railroad’s operation. However that

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

may be, it developed in actual practice that instead of
a minute, only 5 or 10 seconds were needed to blow a
large black mass of smoke, cinders and dirt high into
the atmosphere where it would remain and spread
out dropping dirt and cindcrs over a large area.

To further restrict the ordinance was out of the
question, and it loo-ked as if some very radical change
was necessary; electriﬁcation or dieselization.

While Diesels were not used on railroads, they had
been used in marine service for some 20 years, and
many records and ﬁgures were available which proved
they not only were great fuel savers but the upkeep
was low. Therefore a campaign to induce the railroads
to use them was in order. The oil burning Diesel does
not produce smoke unless badly out of adjustment.

During 1946 and 194-7, a few Diesels were tried by
some of the railroads. They showed immediately a
large fuel’ saving and from then on more Diesels re-
placed the old steam locomotives until by 1953 Pitts-
burgh was about 70 percent Dieselized and today, dur-
ing 1958, all roads are 100 percent Diesels, and Pitts-
burgh has no steam locomotives.

It is rather interesting to turn back the pages of
Pittsburgh’s history to some of the U. S. Weather
Bureau’s observations. They show that there was a great
reduction in Pi-ttsburgh’s moderate and heavy smoke

STRICT ENFORCEMENT of the smoke control law gives
the view from the north end of the Liberty Tunnels an
entirely different appearance.

starting about 194-9 and the following years. This was
about the time the Diesels began to displace the steam
engines. One is inclined to believe that the Diesel was
perhaps the greatest factor in this.

Incinerators were the next reasonable step in smoke
prevention. In the last two years, 38 domestic incinera-
tors have been installed in Pittsburgh. They have given
no trouble and so have made a place for themselves in
household economy- This, in spite of -the fact that the
City of Pittsburgh has a good domestic garbage and
refuse collection services, will soon undoubtably make
obsolete the unsightly waste areas designated as
“dumps.”

A great many large oﬂice and apartment buildings
have been built in Pittsburgh in the las-t few years. Some
of the large oPﬁce‘buildings particularly have preferred
to make private contracts with companies who make a
business of collection and disposing of rubbish and thus
do not have incinerators.

The stoker installations have greatly decreased over
the past nine years and more and more gas fuel is dis-
placing coal. Very little oil is burned in Pittsburgh.

Now that Pittsburgh’s smoke is greatly cleared, people
are becoming more conscious of odors, noxious gases
and fumes. The amount of work by inspectors in their
elimination has greatly increased in the past year. Due
to this vigilant smoke consciousness in Pittsburgh, the
skies are still becoming clearer and the City is becoming
an even cleaner and brighter place to live. I

RESEARCH IN PITTSBURGH

BY ‘ROBERT L. WHETZEL, AE '61

Large industrial corporations have aided signiﬁcantly
in the growth and development of the city of Pitts-
burgh. They have provided jobs for thousands of indi-
viduals, have contributed vastly to education and civic
development and have provided for the material needs
of the growing population. The growth of these corpora-
tions themselves, however, has been partly due to their
tremendous expenditure on research facilities.

Research has had an important role in the progress
of American industry. The reasons for this are many.
For one thing, the whole tempo of technical develop-
ment in this country has been quickening. The rapid
expansion of science has been outpaced by an even more
rapid expansion of technology. As a consequence, the
time intervlal between a scientiﬁc discovery and its tech-
nological application has been shortening over the past
few decades. Also, from a purely economic standpoint,
many major companies have undertaken research, both
applied and fundamental, for the reason that any major
breakthrough by a competitor might have disastrous
and long-lasting effects. Thus, it might be said that re-
search has been the “_advance guard” of scientiﬁc pro-
gress.

Aggressive Pittsburgh industries realized early the im-
portance of scientiﬁc research. Consequently, there are
today in or near the city of Pittsburgh approximately
one hundred and thirteen industrial research centers,
employing over seventeen thousand people. This gives
Pittsburgh an important role in scientiﬁc research.

The Westinghouse Electric Corporation, an early
pioneer in the ﬁelds of electricity, radio and electronics,
has over the past years, grown to vast proportions. As
Westinghouse grew, however, so grew its research facili-
ties. In Pittsburgh alone, Westinghouse maintains sever-
al research centers. The largest and also the most re-
cently completed is the Westinghouse Laboratories in
Churchill Boro, which houses more than seven acres of
up-to-date scientiﬁc research facilities. Over seven hun-
dred people are employed in the various laboratories,

20

ofﬁces and shops of this one center. Included in these
facilities are a technical library, a complete metal pro-
cessing laboratory, and an instrument and glass-blowing
labor-atory, and also research services such as a photo-
graphic reproduction laboratory. In addition to
the laboratories in Churchill Boro, Westinghouse also
maintains a research center in Forest Hills which is de-
voted to nuclear research.

The abundance of natural resources has been an im-
portiant incentive for the formation of companies here

in Pittsburgh. The ready accessability of coal and iron
ore resulted in the formation of many large steel corpor-
ations near Pittsburgh. One such corporation, the world’s
largest producer of steel, United States Steel, has also
devoted considerable amounts of money to research.
The United Saates Steel Research Center in Monroe-
ville is the largest laboratory in the free world devoted
exclusively to research in steel and related problems.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

The facilities at the research center are divided into
fundamental and applied research. The fundamental
research division employs chieﬂy smlall-scale facilities for
ﬁne measurements; therefore, small laboratories are pre-
dominate throughout the building. The applied re-
search division is housed in three buildings which con-
sist of the main laboratory, the experimental engineer-
ing shop, and the raw materials processing buiding. In
Iaddition -to these buildings, construction was begun in
August, 1958, on a new building for electro-mechanical
development. This will provide an additional facility for
development work in the ﬁelds of instrumentation, pro-
cess and materials handling mechanisms, and automa-
tic control in steel production.

In addi-tion to the large industrial research centers,
Mellon Institute is one of Pittsburgh’s most important
and well known research centers. Founded in 1913,
Mellon Institute has made signiﬁcant contributions to
the ﬁelds of both pure and the applied sciences. Its
activities have dealt largely in the ﬁelds of physics,
chemistry, and the engineering sciences and technologies,
with emphasis on their application to the important
problems of human welfare such as public health, sani-
tation, stream pollution control, smoke abatement, and
alleviation of industrial hazards. Mellon Institute recog-
nizes the need for fundamental scientiﬁc research as a
background and stimulus for applied research. It ﬁnances
and carries out numerous pure science investigations.

WESTINGHOUSE Research
Laboratories are situated on
a 72-acre site in Churchill
Boro. The Laboratories em-
ploy more than 700, of which
over 450 are professional
scientists, laboratory techni.
clans and assistants.

Basic investigation in diversiﬁed ﬁelds of science has re-
sulted in many original contributions to scientiﬁc liter-
ature, especially in respect to new drugs, spectroscopy,
X-rays, and distilllation theory.

Among the recent achievements in applied science at
Mellon Institute are improvements in refractories, por-
celain enamels, building materials, and optical glass.
Also, important additions have been made to the know-
ledge of steelmaking, steel construction, welding, and
metal-working. The Institute is active in assisting the
by-product coke industry to map its future and in in-
vestigating recovery processes and methods for utilizing
colal chemicals. Its work in petroleum chemistry and
technology is also recognized internationally as authori-
tative.

The city of Pittsburgh has been steadily growing and
expanding. Pittsburgh, over the past two hundred years,
has progressed to the point where it now is known as
an industrial center of the world. Much‘ of the growth
of the city can be attributed directly to the growth
and expansion of the industrial corporations in and near
Pittsburgh. The establishment and corresponding devel-
opment of these corporations has been dependent, to a
great extent, on scientiﬁc research. Many notable
achievements of the past have been made possible
through research. It is certain that the still more chal-
lenging demands of the future will hlave to be satisﬁed
in the research laboratories. |

 

MELLON INSTITUTE, one of Pitts-
burgh’s best know research centers, has
contributed greatly to the fields of both
pure and applied sciences. It is located
in the Oakland section of the City, near
the University of Pittsburgh and Car-
negie Institute of Technology.

TRANSPORTATION

BY JOSEPH  MATESA, ChemE ’60

Plittsburgh, Workshop of the World, sends more than
five billion dollars worth of goods to markets all over
the world each year. Beforehand, the raw materials
from which these goods are made came in by rail, river
and road. The coming and going is like the ebb and
ﬁow of some great tide. It moves on wheels and on wings,
over the mountains and down the rivers of the Pitts-
burgh area.

In 1846 the transportation story almost became one
of civic strife. The Legislature declined a charter grant
to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, favoring instead
the Central (later Pennsylvanila). Western Pennsylvan-
ians threatened to secede from the rest of the state. The
issues have changed but the story is still one of trouble
as many riailroad heads look toward consolidation or
government aid in the face of rising costs and shrinking
proﬁts.

These are the last full year’s ﬁgures when 152,000.,000
tons of freight moved out of Pittsburgh: Railroads car-
ried 98,000,000 tons; the rivers, 54,000,000; the trucks,
75,000,000 tons, and -the airplane, 20,000. The volume
of air freight seems small but the goods—often import-
ant instruments and parts—were vitally needed. Air-
lines also carried 2,183,472 passengers in and out of
Pittsburgh last year.

Nothing impresses national and international travel-
ers with Pittsburgh’s progress more than the airport
facilities available for their use at the Greater Pitts-
burgh Airport. As Pittsburgh’s door to the air travel-
ing public, it is the most widely known representative.

Since its dedication on May 31, 1952, the Greater
Pittsburgh Airport has made Pittsburgh one of the
world’s great air centers. The international ﬂavor of the
airport has helped stimulate travel to other countries.
In 1954, Pittsburgh ranked 101 among all cities in the
world in number of passengers on international ﬂights,
but in 1958, the city ranked 80 and the international
travel from this airport is still increasing. There are

22

many reasons for Pittsburgh’s growth in air traffic at
Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

Eleven years of planning and building have develop-
ed a skyport that is larger than New York’s LaGuardia
Field and Washington’s National Airport combined and
also the world’s largest terminal building. The far see-
ing architectural design has made the terminal building
the model of terminal buildings for years to come. Its
seven stories are ﬁlled with services which make travel-
ing such a pleasant job for the air traveler.

There is la 62 room hotel, two public observation
lounges, two passenger lounges, ticket and information
centers, a Coffee Shop, a drug store, haberdashery, post
ofﬁce, barber and beauty shops, a branch bank, cafeteria,
ﬂorist shops, a public garage, recreation center, night-
club and even a movie theatre that can accomodate 330

highways.

people. 138 exhibits and two large exhibit rooms bring
the unfamiliar traveler face to flace with some of Pitts-
burgh’s products and industries. Outside, 5,500 cars can
be parked with ease and a 500 foot long fountain makes
a wonderful scenic attraction. The futuristic approach
of the designers was not only limited to the terminlal
buildings, but also is evident in the construction of the
runways.

Pittsburgh is also meeting the trend toward rebuilding
Main Street, U. S. A. The City where once the horse-
and-buggy range was -the town’s edge and a farm horse-
and buckboard range was a round-trip to the nearest
town, but only on ‘Saturday, no longer is a description of
Pittsburgh. These roads are not roads of today.

Today’s roads are thousands of miles of superhigh-
way which unﬁnished though they are, are now consid-
ered inadequate and obsolete. This is because the motor
vehicle in the last ﬁfty-odd years has brought mobility
to the individual, and the individual likes it.

When the voters of Pittsburgh gave their approval to
a $40 million bond issue for highways, bridges and tun-
nels last year, they were given a small taste of the tre-
mendous sums of money that will be spent to meet the
County highway needs of the next decade.

To the average motorist, Pittsburgh streets and high-
ways already seem to‘be too crowded, particularly at
peak hours. But they are destined to become much
more crowded in the near future. In 1955, motor vehi-
cle registration numbered 494,353. Ten years hence, it
is conservatively estimated that there will be more than
600,000 registrants. In fact, registrations, up 3 per cent
annually, are increasing at a greater rate than our pop-
ulation. °

Realizing this great problem, the Federal Goverment
provided for a roadbuilding program calling for more
than $33-billion a few years ago. It was -this program
that emphasized the need for long-range highway plan-
ning by Allegheny County.

The most dramatic of Pittsburgh’s road improve-

FEBRUARY 1959

ments is the construction of the Fort Pitt Tunnel and
Bridge. This came about largely because of the daily
traﬂic congestion of South Hills traﬂic. Both Parkway
East and Parkway West met on opposite sides of Mount
Washington, a seemingly impenetrable object. The
construction of a tunnel through Mount Washington
joined the 27-mile Penn-Lincoln Parkway, and, when
completed, will solve Pittsburgh’s traflic headache—the
bottleneck in the South Hills.

The tunnel is designed for two levels of traﬂic at one
entrance. The two tubes will measure 60 feet from
center to center and will be 3,600 feet from portal to
portal. A partial list of the materials being used in the
construction includes: 6,000 cubic yards of concrete,
850,000 pounds of structural steel and 2,000,000 pounds
of reinforcing steel.

Pittsburgh’s new Fort Pitt Bridge, constructed across
the Monongahela River, is designed around a combina-
tion of engineering principles that make it -the only span
of its type ‘in the world. Featuring a proﬁle of high
strength steel, this new bridge is regarded by engineers
as the most unique structure in the entire Penn-Lincoln
Parkway System.

To span the entire width of the riv-er in compliance
with navigation requirements, and at the same time
-achieve aesthetic appeal, a double-deck, tied-arch struc-
ture was selected. Across each deck will speed four lanes
of one-way traﬂic. Designed by George S. Richardson,
consulting engineer for the Pennsylvania Department of
Highways, the span is the world’s only double-deck
bridge using box sections as arch ribs, and with the tied
arch using trusses instead of girders as ties.

This is not the complete story of transportation in
Pittsburgh. Rather it is an attempt to highlight only a
few major accomplishments of the tnansportation indus-
try in the City. This industry is by far ideal. Pittsburgh
is only beginning to realize the inadequacy of its bus
and trolley transportation. Perhaps a major development
in this ﬁeld will highlight transportation in Pittsburgh
in the next hundred years.I

  

AT FIRST SIGHT the many interchanges of roads seems
to be the result of poor coordination. They are, however,
the result of careful surveys and precise planning.

Herbert Spencermon the genesis of science

"Without further argument it will, we think be admitted
that the sciences are none of them separately evolved --
are none of them independent either logically or histori-
cally; but that all of them have, in a greater or less degree,
required aid and reciprocated it. Indeed. it needs but to
throw aside hypotheses, and contemplate the mixed
character of surrounding phenomena, to see at once that
these notions of division and succession in the ldnds of

lmowledge are simply scientitic fictions: good, if regarded
merely as aids to study; bad, it regarded as representing
realities in Nature. No facts whatever are presented to our
senses uncombined with other facts »-— no facts whatever
but are in some degree disguised by accompanying facts:
disguised in such a manner that all must be partially
understood before any one can be understood."

{Hi LANGLEY
MH\/|UHlA[ [£EHJH£

This is the first in a series of Langley Memorial
Lectures presented at the Schools of Engineering and
Mines at the University of Pittsburgh.

This lecture was given by Dr. Paul Foote on No-
vember 20, I958.

About Samuel Pierpont Langley

Professor Langley taught physics and astronomy at
the University (then known as the Western University
of Pennsylvania). He was also director of the Allegheny
Observatory, serving in this capacity for twenty years
from 1867 to 1887. D.uring this time he attracted wide
acclaim for his writings and general contributions to
astronomy.

In 1866 Professor Langley became interested in a
work on the ﬂight of migratory whooping cranes by
Israel Lancaster. The 52-year-old professor was instantly
ﬁred with curosity to ﬁnd the secret of the gentle soar-
ing flight of the great birds who could sustain them-
selves for hours in la seemingly effortless position.

Langley set about to determine what forces in the
air the birds used to sustain themeslves, not realizing
that the balance of forces and the power of the ﬂight
was controlled by the birds and not by the air around
them. By means of a rapidly rotating table, on which
were mounted stuffed birds with their wings extended,
Langley was able to measure lift and to some extent
drag.

Realizing that the ﬂight of these birds was dependent
upon a Newtonian Maxim which stated that the resist-
ance of a plane surface to the air varies as the square
of the sine of its angle of incidence, Langley began
to expand his experiments and apply the principle to a
variety of surfaces.

The result of this study was the issuance of a physi-
cal law by Langley which stated that Newton’s ﬁgures
on resistance were in error «and that resistance was only
1/20 that stated by Newton. He further stated that
mechanical ﬂight was possible with engines then in ex-
istance.

Then, in 1889, Professor Langley was named secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D. C.
As a result of this position, Professor Langley was able
to secure funds to publish his writings on the heavier-
than-air ﬂight. Also at this time Langley experimented
with hundreds of ﬂying models powered by many en-
gines of various kinds.

He constructed a small, very light-weight steam en-
gine which operated with a low power to weight ratio.
He worked long and hard on the development of suit-
able wings to carry the aerodrome. By 1894 he was ex-
perimenting on a ﬂying model which was launched
from atop a houseboat moored in the Potomac near
Quantico. The wings of the poorly-balanced model were
of silk, the framework of split bamboo. The fragile na-
ture of the lightweight craft required a dead calm for

winter. The launching catapult was tricky and unrelia-
ble. These factors spelled immediate defeat for the ﬁrst
four models shot into the cold air. One by one the
fnail models strained at the catapult with the force of

ley carried out his first experiments on powered flight.

their tiny steam engines, and one by one they were cut
loose only to drop and sink beneath the waters of the
river.

Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, a close friend .of Profes-
sor Langley and a man who knew the hardships of
fruitless research, was present at the launching of the
rebuilt No. 5 equipped with tandem wings. The day
was Mlay 6, 1896. Langley and Bell had just ﬁnished
a ﬁnal check of the launching mechanism, the wings,
the tail and his engine of the aerodrome. They stood
on the shore and looked out to the houseboat. Langley
had been through one of the most difficult winters of
his life. He had seen model after model collapse and
sink. Newspapers had called him a madman, quack and
dreamer. Through all the defeat he had_ retained his
belief that powered ﬂight was attainable in his'time.
Now Bell stood by, camera in hand, waiting to secure
positive proof. The white-bearded astronomer waited
until a few minutes after three and then shouted to the
attendant on the houseboat, “Let her go.” Then he
held his breath.

The propellers whirrled madly, the tiedown rope was
cut, the aerodrome shot off the end of the catapult, dip-

ped toward the water and then, to the shock and sur-
prise of Langley, Bell «and the morbidly curious on-
lookers on the banks of the Potomac, it began to rise
slowly in long graceful spirals. In the shouting and con-
fusion, Bell forgot to take his historic pictures and hug-
ged Langley excitedly. He later told reporters that he
saw tears on the old man’s checks. 3

The aerodrome remained airborne for one minute, 20
seconds, attained an altitude of between 70 and 100
feet and covered 3,000 feet. Immediately after the model
was recovered safe and sound from the river, it was re-
launched and ﬂew again for 2,300 feet. A rebuilt No.
6 was launched in November of the same year and ﬂew
4,200 feet at about 30 mph.

Professor LIangley’s curiosity had been satisﬁed. His
principles had been proved. He stated publicly that the
success of Aerodrome 5 and 6 marked the end “of the
work which seemed to be especially mine—the demon-
stration of the practicability of mechanical ﬂight-and
of the next stage, which is the commercial and practi-
cal development of the idea, it is probable that the world
may look to others.”

Finally, on October 7, 1903, the launching was made.
Professor Langley was detained in Washington for of-
ﬁcial business or, perhaps, merely used that excuse to
hide from the waiting press, who had (already expressed
an open criticism of the government’s waste of money
on the experiment. Nevertheless, the launching was
made, and the aeroship fell heavily from the end of the
platform into the water. Manly, its pilot, was rescued
unhurt and made a statement to the press in which
he blamed Ia lack of balance in the airframe for the
failure.

Although his heart was never in the new experiment,
Langley took the latest failure as a personal defeat.
However, his courage would not be subjugated and
through the constant and relentless persausion of Manly,

he repeated the ﬂateful experiment in 1903. The latest
attempt on January 6, 1906, resulted in the destruction
of the machine, even before it left the catapult.

And so ended the experiments in ﬂight by Professor
Samuel Piermont Langley. A short time after the failure
of the fund-raising campaign for the last trial of Lang-
ley’s man-carrying machine, the Wright brothers suc-
cessfully made their ﬂight at Kitty Hawk. When Pro-
fessor Langley read of their success, he turned to Manly
and said, “ must congratulate them.” But the ﬁre of

curiosity and the burning desire to achieve powered‘

ﬂight were gone from Langley’s eyes. He cleared his
desk in the Smithsonian Institute and resigned his posi-
tion.

On February 27, 1906, without flanfare or‘ public
attention, forgotten by the press which beat him to de-
feat and the crowds that waited to see him fail, Pro-
fessor Langley died. He had never seen a man ﬂy.

In 1914, a rebuilt model of the man-carrying aero-
drome was successfully ﬂown and landed on the waters
of the Potomac, proving too late to the world that Pro-
fessor Langley had achieved his dream and that only
the world prevented him from seeing it. I

It is most ﬁtting that Dr. Paul D. Foote should be the ﬁrst
Samuel P. Langley Memorial Lecturer. Like Langley, he is a renowned
physicist and engineer, whose intense interest in all phases of science

Minnesota, Dr. Foote ﬁrst became internationally known for his de-
velopment in high temperature measurement and control through his

work as physicist at the U. S. Bureau of Standards.

Starting as a one man investigator for the Gulf Oil Company, he
developed the Gulf Research Aid Development Company to one of the
largest industrial research teams in the world. The success of his asso-
ciates at Gulf is known in "all technical areas. Dr. Foote retired as Vice
President and member of the board of the Gulf Oil Corporation in

1954.

Just prior to presenting this lecture on Thursday, November 20,
1958, Dr. Foote had retired from his latest position as Assistant Direc-
tor in Charge of Science and Engineering for the U. S. Department of
Defense. Very few scientists or engineers can look to a more impressive
record in science and engineering.

Why Lockheed —

Lockheed’s leadership in aircraft is continuing in missiles. The Missile
Systems Division is one of the largest in the industry and its reputation
is attested by the number of high-priority, long-term projects it holds:
the Polaris IRBM, Earth Satellite, Kingﬁsher (Q—5) and the X-7.

To carry out such complex projects, the frontiers of technology in all
areas must be expanded. Lockheed’s laboratories at Sunnyvale and

Palo Alto, California, provide the most advanced equipment for research
and development, including complete test facilities and one of the

most up-to—date computing centers in the nation. Employee beneﬁts

are among the best in the industry.

For those who qualify and desire to continue their education, the
Graduate Study Program enables them to obtain M.S. or Ph.D degrees
at Stanford or the University of California, while employed in their
chosen ﬁelds at Lockheed.

Lockheed Missile Systems Division was recently honored at the ﬁrst
National Missile Industry Conference as “the organization that
contributed most in the past year to the development of the art of
missiles and astronautics?’

THE LANGLEY MEMORIAL LECTURE

As a former citizen of Pittsburgh and Oakland for so
many years, I welcome the occasion to return, and par-
ticularly appreciate the opportunity to talk to this group
so vitally concerned with contributing to the technologi-
cal and industrial strength of the United States. When
Dean Fitterer invited me for this meeting, I was serv-
ing as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and
Engineering. Before assuming that post, I had, since
my retirement from Gulf Oil Corporation, been living in
Washington and enjoying the relative calm and pleasure
of serving as a part-time consultant to the Government.
On October ‘31st, I completed my tour of duty as Assist-
ant Secretary and thus speak to you today from the
safe harbor of advisor to the Department of Defense.

In determining what to discuss with you, it occurred
to me that you might be interested in a review of some
of my impressions of the signiﬁcant events of the past
year and to give you an estimate of where we stand
from the broad viewpoint of national security and more
particularly in regard to Defense research and engineer-
ing. The year was an important ‘milestone in our history
as a nation. When Sputnik I last Fall scored an im-
pressive scientiﬁc and propaganda triumph for the
Soviet Union, it challenged our technological-industrial
superiority in the minds of the American public, our
friends and allies, and the underdeveloped countries
that long to share in the higher standard of living
of the modern world.

Today, we are challenged as never before to use our
vast intellectual and moral resources to deal construc-
tively with the profound changes wrought in human
society by the technological revolution initiated through
the release of nuclear energy. Several years ago, Presi-
dent Eisenhower pointed out that with the advent of
nuclear weapons, there was no longer any alternative
to peace. The unprecedented dilemma of our times is the
fact that the real power of nuclear weapons and strate-
gic missiles lies in the assurance of international peace,
rather than the winning of war ; there can be no winners
in an all-out nuclear war. Last September, in speaking
before the American Legion Convention in Chicago,
Secretary McElroy said “the primary objective of our
military policy is -to prevent war” and that “the weapons
and weapon systems with which our Armed Forces are
equipped serve only one purpose, the preservation of
peace.”

Technology has expanded at an exponential rate for
the past 250 years. Regardless of the type of data under
consideration, for example the number of technical
books and magazines, membership in engineering socie-
ties, paten-ts, dictionaries of national biographies, what-

— ever be the basis of computation, one discovers the rate

of growth to be six percent annually with a variation of

BY DR. PAUL D. FOOTE

around plus or minus one percent. This means a doubling
every ten to ﬁfteen years. World population has been
doubling at a much slower rate of every ninety years.
Hence if both scientists and the general public continue
increasing at the rate for another 250 years, we would
out-number our total labor force. Obviously, nothing can
continue to double indeﬁnitely, but it is an interesting
fact that at the present time there is not the slightest
evidence for a retardation in the rate of growth of pop-
ulation and especially of science and technology. We
are living in the most exciting age of all history, in
the epoch of nuclear and thermonuclear power. Super-
sonic ﬂight, satellites and space navigation. These de-
velopments require large expenditures of funds by the
Department of Defense in order to insure national secur-
ity.

Although Defense is actively engaged in formulating
the budget for FY ’60, it is now operating on the bud-
get for FY ’59, ending next June 30. The total amount
so far appropriated by Congress for FY ’59 is nearly $41
billion. About 6.4 billion, or roughly 15 percent of this
amount, is expended for research and engineering. Re-
search and development require $2.7 billion, testing and
evaluation $3.2 billion, and $500 million for expansion
of facilities, military personnel and construction. Most
of the research is of an applied or supporting nature,
but roughly $131 million could be classiﬁed as basic
research in the physical, social and medical sciences.
Special emphasis is being placed on the support of basic
research and this sum should be materially increased in
future appropriations.

In preparing for -an adequate defense of this country,
the Armed Services have become the nation’s largest
consumer of the products of technology. The hardware
and end items stem from applied research development,
and testing, «and all developments are -the ﬁnal out-
growth of basic research, "Ia term applying to the search
for knowledge in the physical and life sciences. Defense
as well as other government agencies, such as the vari-
ous Bureaus, the National Science Foundation, the
Atomic Energy Commission, the private research insti-
tutes, the industrial laboratories and the universities,
all must continue to increase this reservoir of funda-
mental knowledge in the interest of national security
and public welfare.

In the Department of Defense we have nearly one
hundred major laboratories and test stations devoted to
almost every conceivable military subject. Based or.
FY ’58 statistics, the thirty-ﬁve Army technical installa-
tions, the forty-ﬁve Navy laboratories, and the sixteen
Air Force laboratories and test facilities had a total of
nearly 144,000 persons directly employed by the De-
partment of Defense in research and engineering. This,

however, is only a fraction of the technological activities
supported by the Research and Engineering Depart-
ment. It has been estimated that over half of the re-
search personnel of the entire country is engaged in De-
fense work, Of the 6.4 billion-dollar appropriation for
research ahd engineering, 15% is allotted to Defense
owned and bperated technical installations, 4% to uni-
versity and non-proﬁt institutions and 81% to indus-
trial contractors, large and small business.

About a quarter of our annual expense is devoted to
improving air defense capabilities, on radars for early
warning and surveillance, on control centers with their
electronic computers and on communication links and
networks for tying all these elements into single inte-
grated systerris. Radars in the early warning and sur-
veillance systems are continually being improved in
range and altitude capabilities, and are being made less
vulnerable to electronic jamming and deception. Better
warning and surveillance against low~ﬂying aircraft are
being developed through such techniques as raising
nadar antennas above the earth by means of towers,
blimps and planes. Control of weapons -is being improved
in capacity, accuracy and speed by using electronic
data—handling techniques to replace the old manual
methods for plotting and recording aircraft positions.
In the defense of North America, elaborate electronic
and data-processing installations, such as SAGE and
MISSILE MASTER, are able to locate on-corning
enemy planes and dispatch immediately high speed inter-
ceptors armed with nuclear weapons. Our many SAC
bases are maintained on a 15-minute alert so that
bombers can be readily launched for retaliatory mea-
sures.

In 1923, ayoung Navy ﬂier, Lt. A. J. Williams, llater
employed by Gulf here in Pittsburgh in charge of Avia-
tion, set a world speed record of 243.8 miles per hour.
Shortly thereafter medical ofﬁcers placed a ban on speed
trials on the basis that such high speeds endanger the
ﬂier. It was thought that the human body was at the
limit of all the speed it could stand, possibly a concept
confused by the associated acceleration.

Today, 35 years later, we have operational aircraft
ﬂying lat ﬁve times the speed of Lt. Williams’ record.
One experimental aircraft has already ﬂown at nine
times this speed and the X-15 airplane will shortly
carry its pilot out into space at speeds in excess of 3,500
miles per hour. ,

When a Mach 3 interceptor, ﬂying at three times the
velocity of sound at 35,000 feet altitude meets an enemy
bomber Ialso ﬂyiiig at Mach 3, the rate of closure of the
two planes is 66 miles per minute or roughly one mile
per second. If the operator of the interceptor had to
depend on visual detection at a range of 5 miles, he
would have just 5 seconds to make complicated ballistic
calculations and release a properly directed missile,
which would be obviously impossible. The days of the
spectacular dog ﬁghts and loop-the—loop are over. Only
a single pass is possible and after that the two planes
have vanished in the distance. Actually the intercep-
tion must be handled by electronic control with digital

computers and automatic weapon releases operating
in milliseconds. Practically, we have the meeting of two
guided missiles carrying human operators more or
less as observers, with the pilot‘ of the interceptor hav-
ing the ability to return his plane to his base after the
single encounter possible. Most of the entire «action is
controlled by electronic gear. At the start of World War
II—less than 20 years ago—~the use of electron-tube
devices in military operations was conﬁned almost ex-
clusively to communication. In fact, the word “elec-
tronics” which now deﬁnes an eleven billion dollar in-
dustry, did not come into general usage prior to this
period. At the present time, one-third the cost of a plane
is for electronic equipment essential to navigation and
ﬁre control.

The B-17 bomber, the aircraft that carried the burden
of the air offensive in World War II, used 100 electron
tubes, had the electrical power requirement of 50 aver-
age size homes‘ and cost around $200,000. In contrast,
the present B-52 bomber uses 2,140 electron tubes, has
power sufficient for 350 homes and costs $8,000,000. The
B-17 required 200,000 engineering man-hours for ﬁrst
ﬂight; the B-52 used 4,085,0.00 man-hours. The B-58
supersonic’ bomber in production as the next Iaircraft
for SAC will have consumed 9,340,000 engineering man-
hours, and the B-70, designed for speeds in the Mach 3
range, will require 14,500,000 engineering man-hours
for development. Similar progress has taken place with
our ﬁghter and interceptor planes. For example, the
F-106 all-weather interceptor would be completely in-
effective if its fantastically complex electronic systems
did not openate properly to provide communication,
data link, identiﬁcation, navigation and weapons con-
trol. The electronic system in this aircraft employs over
1,000 vacuum tubes and 4,000 semiconductor devices
operating in close contact with the extensive ground
electronic environment of massive radars, digital com-
puters and communication networks.

It has been stated that a single ﬁghter bomber, such
as the F-105, carries power equivalent to all the
bombs dropped by the U. S. Air Force during World
War II. This is a light-weight ﬁghter. One of our heavy
bombers would have several times this ﬁre power capac-
ity. The destructive capability of a ﬂeet of bombers is
simply beyond comprehension.

The advancement of radar over the past 20. years ex-
empliﬁes the tremendous growth in military electronic
research. At the close of World War II, radar was used
primarily for the detection of surface and air targets
and for the control of guns. Although these early vint-
age radars represented a large advance over perwar
communication and television technology, they were in-
fants compared to present-day systems. They were con-
sidered very complex if they included as many as 300
electron tubes with a maximum pulsed peak power out-
put of 100 KW. Detection ranges against a heavy air-
craft rarely exceeded 100 miles and tracking ranges of 50
miles for precision radars were considered good.

Today, radar devices are being used for scores of
military applications, including the guidance of many

In this respect, it is quite different from a ﬁxed installa-
tion on land, designed for intercontinental or inter-
mediate range missiles, the exact geographical coordin-
ates of which may become known. The Soviet Union
has an active ﬂeet of over 450 submarines, the largest
peace-time force that any nation has ever possessed.
With these new oapabilities of the submarine, research
and technology are pressed to the limit in the develop-
different types of missiles; the navigation of ships, sub-
marines and aircraft; ground surveillance and mapping,
meteorological research and operations; location of
tanks and personnel advancing across obscure ternain,
and the tracking of satellites. Radars that operate in
the several megawatt power range are now common

. and some of the newer forms contain sevenal thousand

electron tubes and semiconductor devices. But even
these are small compared to systems now under develop-
ment for the detection and -tracking of ballistic missiles
at ranges of thousands of miles. The production of these
new radars necessary to provide an effective defense
against ballistic missiles represents one of the greatest
technical challenges that has ever confronted the elec-
tronic engineers of this nation.

An interesting by-product arising from the use of
such complicated electronic gear in planes, ships and
missiles has been the space limitations and the neces-
sity for miniaturization. Microcircuitry is ca development
of the past ﬁve years and is still in its infancy. In 1950
we did very well to package 1,000 components in a cubic
foot of space. This year we speak in terms of nearly a
million per cubic foot, and hope that by 1965 one billion
electronic components can be conﬁned in a black box
of one cubic foot capacity. The future of microcircuitry
may hold the answer to many of our problems such as
reliability and redundancy. Even gyros are being made
smaller and smaller, and of more precise sensing attitude,
not with the earth alone, but with the ﬁxed stars. Drifts
of only 0.001 degree per hour are commonplace and per-
mit precise underwater naviagation as recently demon-
strated by the passage of the nuclear-powered submarine
under the polar ice cap.

Three of the Navy’s serious problems are the protec-
tion of this country against missile-launching sub-
marines, the defense of convoys against submarine at-
tack, and the prevention of losses due to enemy mining
operations. About,one-eighth of the total research and
engineering funds are being spent to solve these prob-
lems through the development of longer-range sub-
marine detection devices, infrared equipment, anti-sub-
marine ships, Iaircraft, special weapons and counter
mining -techniques. Nuclear power, resulting in continu-
ed submerged endurance and increased underwater
speed, has given our submarines a decisive advantage.
This, combined with the capability of launching, while
submerged, intermediate range ballistic missiles with
nuclear warheads makes the submarine one of the most
effective and dangerous weapons ever devised. As a
missile launching station, the submarine is a mobile
target, the precise position of which requires continuous
tracking when effective countermeasures are necessary.

ment of effective defense. Protection requires the inte-
grated use of destroyers, picket boats, carrier aircraft,
killer submarines, long-range patrol seaplanes, «helicop-
ters and other naval units all equipped with the best
technical gear the scientists and technicians are able to
devise.

In fulﬁlling its responsibility for improving land com-
bat weapons and equipment, the Army’s major efforts
are devoted to the increase of ﬁrepower, to better mobil-
ity and communications and to new methods for acquir-
ing combat intelligence. The Army works with the Air
Force on improving capabilities for the aerial delivery
of troops and supplies. Battle area surveillance is direct-
ed toward more eﬂective radar, infrared, sonic, and
meteorological and drone reconnaissance with photo-
graphic and television transmission of intelligenve. The
object is to keep continuous watch over thousands of
square miles of battleﬁeld in any weather, to locate tar-
gets, and to determine the results of every direct action.
Nuclear warfare has made troop concentration danger-
ous. The resulting necessary dispersion of forces requires
rapid and effective communication facilities among all
units.

Modern versions of most of the conventional weapons
of World War II are being developed, such as tanks,
riﬂes, machine guns, recoilless rifles of large calibre, shap-
ed charges, blazookas, mortars, howitzers and military ve-
hicles of every description. Guided missiles and rockets
play a major role. The NIKE-AJAX was the world’s
ﬁrst supersonic anti-aircraft guided missile ﬁred from
the ground to intercept and destroy an enemy plane
regardless of evasive action. Units of this rnissile have
been sﬁationed around vital industrial and strategically
important areas as well as cities throughout the United
States. These are gradually being replaced or supple-
mented by the more powerful NIKE-HERCULES with
an atomic warhead. Several missiles for use on the battle-
ﬁeld are now in openation such as the CORPORAL,
the HONEST JOHN, the REDSTONE, and others. The
HAWK is a target-seeking missile capable of attacking
aircraft at low altitude or tree level where ordinary
detection by radar is impossible because of ground clut-
ter and interference. The NIKE-ZEUS missile is being
developed for very high altitude attack on an incoming
ballistic missile. Development of defenses against chem-
ical and toxicological warfare is a subject of intense
activity. Food preservation, clothing characteristics,
properties of materials and countless other items keep
the Army’s many llaboratories and contracting research
organizations fully occupied.

During this pastiyealr we. have made very important
progress joining forces with our NATO allies, whose
combined research capabili-ty is potentially equal to
that of our own. In a television address in November,
1957, the President referred to “the tragic failure to
secure the great beneﬁts that would flow from mutual
sharing of appropriate scientiﬁc information and effort
among friendly countries” and said, “Here is a way in
which, at no cost, we can dramatically and quickly
magnify the scientiﬁc resources at the disposal of the

free world.”

This Presidential mandate for a far more liberal
exchange of information with our NATO allies has
opened up a vital new ﬁeld of international agreements,
through our Mutual Weapons Development Program,
to increase European military scientiﬁc research and
NATO weapons development. I am convinced that this
program has signiﬁcant vialue. Its usefulness has only
begun and it is conservative to say that the future looks
bright for substantial achievement.

Recently we have taken a constructive look at our
fundamental research program, the base upon which
a strong military technology must rest. This has been
officially recognized by the Department of D.efense with
the assertion that “the needs ‘of n-ational defense are
uniquely characaterized by pressing demands for new
flacts and knowledge very close to the frontiers of sci-
ence.” The cost of basic research is so small in propor-
tion to its contribution to potential military strength
that it constitutes a creative means for effecting long-
range economies in the military program. The most
limiting factors in military development today are mate-
rials, electronic and mechanical components of every
type, and fuels. Materials dictate what we can do with
jet engines, with missiles, with plane design, and with
pnactically every military device. We are always limited
by corrosion resistance, heat resistance of hypersonic

_wdapon systems, and chemical reactivity of the mate-
rials of construction. We need an attack upon the ma-

terials problem from the standpoint of solid state phy-
sics much. like the research that resulted in the transistor.
We require more fundamental research in the chemis-
try of materials, especially synthetic organic chemistry,
chemical reactivity, chemical thermodynamics and me-
éhanisms of oxidation, basic research in alloy systems of
refractory metals, in the physical chemistry of ceramics
and cermets, in adhesives, structural plastics, glazing
materials and composites. It is certain that had we years
ago carried on more intensive fundamental research on
radar and electronic components, on concepts for the
generation of radio frequency power, and on the devel-
opment of high-powered tubes, we would have available
today an alternative to the brute-force radar solution
adapted to tide us over military emergencies in our
defense system networks.

In basic research there is no problem of duplication of
effort in spite of so much unfavorable newspaper public-
ity to the con-trary. When we are searching the unknown
for an unpredictable piece of knowledge we increase the
probabilities of the yield as more independent investiga-
tors participate in the search. If by chance two scient-
ists discover the same thing at -the same time, this only
validates their ﬁndings, which is good. Diversity in the
support of basic research is also vitally important for
developing a broad spectrum of new ideas. All agencies
of government, industry and academic institutions
should participate.

In spite of the fact that the cost of basic research is
small compared to the cost of carrying the results
through development to a ﬁnal engineering accomplish-

ment, some of the modern tools of research represent
tremendous investments in equipment and facilities. We
must have more complete wind tunnel data for speed
nanges from Mach 5 to 20, from 10 to 20, and eventually
for speeds beyond this. We "need higher energy electron
and proton accelerators where in‘_-the multi-billion volt
ﬁeld the equipment expense is of the order of a hundred
million dollars and the operating expense of a single
machine may run to ﬁfteen million dollars annually.

.Such equipment is beyond the capability of industry and

must be supported by government. But even in govern-
rpent themos-t qualiﬁed decision makers cannot probe
the future to decide with Iassurance that research ﬁnd-
ings from one such accelerator may pave the way for
the . next quantum jump in military capability more
effective than dividing this substantial investment and
annual outlay among many other ﬁelds of research
such was oceanography, meteorology, solid propellants
or special problems in health, education and public
welfare. We must recognize that there has to be an
expenditure limitation, and that many more desirable
projects are competing for funds than can be approved.

Priority ratings on proposals involve exceedingly dif-
ﬁcult considerations in arriving at a ﬁnal decision. Al-
most any weapon system contemplated ultimately means
the expenditure of several billion dollars, whether it be
a new ﬁghter, a bomber, a nuclear propulsion system,
an intermediate—or intercontinental-range missile, a
submarine, or a communication system for continental
defense. In authorizing a new development, the ﬁnal
cost rather than the initial or current expenditure must
be weighed against the advantages to be secured. Deci-
sion making in engineering is becoming more difficult
every year because technical knowledge, as mentioned
earlier, has been growing at an expontential rate for
more than two centuries. As a typical example of the
present complexity, we now have 100,000 scientiﬁc jour-
nals world-wide, and 300 technical abstract journals
reviewing these publications. The number of engineering
choices in the electronic design of a ﬁghter plane has
been estimated to have increased by a flactor of more
than 100 since 1946. Similar increases in possible de-
sirable choices have taken place in most phases of mili-
tary requirements. A few decades ago it was a relative-
ly simple matter to make a sound decision promptly
for an operational weapon system. Today, confronted
with so many thousands of possible choices, it is usually
necessary to require staff studies, systems analyses and
operational research investigations to narrow the ﬁeld
to a manageable minimum. Such studies, to be worth
the effort, require time and detailed review by highly
competent authorities. Thus the attempt to render the
best possible decision based on sound engineering prin-
ciples often results in delay of the program, with critic-
ism from the contractors, from the military ofﬁcers re-
sponsoble to operational force, and from the Congress.
The present reorganization of the Department of De-
fense is designed in every possible way to speed up its
decision-making caplability without sacriﬁcing sound
judgment and technological feasibility. I

How to get steel tough enough
to land America’s first jet airliner

Career at the Timken Company”. Write Mr. Russ
Proﬂitt, The Timken Roller Bearing Company, Canton
6, Ohio.

OU see above the axles of the Boeing 707-
America’s first jet airliner. They have to be tough.

A cross-wind landing could put the whole landing im-
pact of this 122-ton plane on one wheel-—instead of
eight. And these axles have to be light. Manufacturers
of the 707’s landing gear had built landing gears for
dozens of other models using an analysis of seamless
steel tubing specially developed by the Timken Com-
pany. But to be strong enough for the much heavier
707, the steel would have to be cleaner. Any impurities
in the ﬁnished part would cause its rejection. Timken
Company metallurgists said the steel could be made
clean enough for the 707. And it was—met highest
speciﬁcations, stood up to the terriﬁc landing impacts.

lems. Problems that you may face in your future job in

Another Unmatched Engineering Facility to
Advance Propulsion Systems of the Future

Future aircraft and missiles may require propulsion
systems far different from those in wide use today
—— different in size, power output, appearance, and
perhaps even in the basic method of utilizing energy.

To probe the propulsion future . . . and to build
and test greatly advanced propulsion systems for
coming generations of ﬂight vehicles, Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft is now operating its new Florida
Research and Development Center. This facility
supplements Pratt & Whitney’s main research and
development installations in Connecticut.

The new Florida Center, ﬁnanced and built by
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, is unique in America’s
air industry. Here a completely air-conditioned
plant with 17 acres under roof is specially designed
and equipped for the development of new power

 

plants of virtually any type. Testing is handled in
special isolated areas; the nearest is four miles
from the plant and many miles from any inhabited
area; The new Center can be greatly expanded on
its 10-square-mile site. Continued isolation is in-
sured by a vast wildlife sanctuary in which the
Center is located.

Of‘ the many people employed at the Center to-
day, about half are scientists, engineers and highly
trained technicians. By late next year, the total
number is expected to be almost doubled.

The new Florida Research and Development
Center is one more reason why Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft is able to continue producing the world’s
best aircraft propulsion systems . . . in Whatever

THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY

BY JOSEPH J. FITZHARRIS, ChemE ’59

Pittsburgh has been long noted as an important indus-
trial center. Coal and steel hlave been the mainstays of
this mechanized metropolis. The city of Pittsburgh
came to life with the coming of coal and steel.

Steel began to alter industrial life about 1875, 121
years after the city became a trading post and gateway
to the west.

Steel in Pittsburgh‘ began, however, with the building
of the ﬁrst iron foundry in 1805 by Joseph McClurg,
whose descendants, W. G. Hogg, was to become divi-
sion superintendent of Clairton Works. That ﬁrst foun-
dry was on Fifth Avenue, site of today’s Park Building.

Cannon balls came out of Pittsburgh for the Lake
Erie ﬂeet of Commodore Perry in the War of 1812, land
the arsenal in Lawrenceville was established in 1814.

In 1848, Andrew Carnegie came to Pittsburgh when
he was 12 years of age. He worked in a cotton mill for
$1.20 per week. He eventually sold a steel empire for g M‘

$40O’O0O’(?0O° _ . WORKERS in the muck mill make small forgings. In 1870
Carnegie worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad as a their job was much the same as a blacksmith.

   

\

telegrapher. With the beginning of the Civil War he
bought into bridge fabrications and a forging plant.
The demand for war goods sent Carnegie and Pittsburgh
on the way to fame.

In the same period, high grade ore was found in Lake
Superior’s environs, coke was used successfully in blast '
furnaces and the Bessemer converter was invented.

Andrew Carnegie built the ﬁrst Bessemer converter
plant in 1875. The plant was the Edgar Thomson Works
in Braddock. It was constructed on the site of battleﬁeld
where General Braddock was defeated 120 years previ-
ously.

Carnegie and his partners obtained the Homestead
Works in 1883, and in ﬁve years the name of Carnegie
was distinguished on two continents. During this period
the Homestead Works built the ﬁrst basic open hearth

BRAWN, and plenty of it, was required in all phases of

steel making in 1906. Here a turner strains as he empties furnace’ _ ,
a crucible into ladle. Subsequent business ventures obtained the Duquesne

36 SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Steel Works and opening of iron ore mines on Lake
Superior. A ﬂeet of steamers transported ore on the
Great Lakes and Carnegie got control of H. C. Frick
Coke Co.

Clarnegie and Frick became partners, and consolida-
tions were added to make Carnegie Steel Co. largest in
America and leading to the formation of U. S. Steel
Corporation in 190.1.

Steelmaking in Pittsburgh could not have attained
such great heights without district coal deposits. Steel
and coal have been mutually dependent on each since
their beginning.

Vast deposits of coal in the Pittsburgh area have
been responsible for the district’s growth. Mining of coal
goes back almost to -the beginning of the 200 year history
which this Bicentennial marks.

In 1778 Major Ward ordered a coal mine opened
opposite Fort Pitt on the Mononoglahela side for use of
the garrison.

Washington is recorded as commenting upon the
abundance of Pittsburgh coal which he said “appeared
to be of the best quality, burning freely.”

Pittsburgh coal supplied American troops during the
Revolution and in 1784 the Penn family was selling “the

motives which the railroads provided in previously un-

‘reached sections of the country. The new territory open-

ed new markets to the coal industry. The rivers and
rails together carried over a million tons of coal during
the latter part of the Civil War. The coal industry
prospered through World War I and into 1920’s. It fell
victim to the depression in 1932 but had a temporary
boost during World War II. The coming of diesel power
and oil and gas heat_plunged production to a low point
in 1954-.

Mine employment in the Pittsburgh district then fell
to 7,300, compared to 31,000 a few years before.

The future of the coal industry depends on two im-
portant factors. The ﬁrst of these is the rate of electric
power consumption. Presently, utility companies are the
largest consumer of coal. The future of the coal indus-
try also depends upon coal chemicals. As matters stand
todlay, coal tar is the raw material for nearly one-half
of the U. S. organic chemical industry.

Looking toward tomorrow, researchers are producing
liquid fuel from coal. Scientists also are ﬁnding more
and more chemicals in the crude oil-like liquid which

results when coal is subjected to high pressure and temp-‘

erature in the presence of hydrogen.

Coal and steel are not the only industries in Pitts-
burgh. They are, however, the bulwark of other manu-
facturing concerns. Most factories and shops in this dis-
trict either use the products of these industrial gilants
or supply their many needs. I

Although Pittsburgh has gained national and inter-
national recognition for its spectacular redevelopment
program, the city remains seriously handicapped from
a civic standpoint by the absence of major recreational
facilities. This civic problem, although one of the last
to be attacked, is rapidly being eliminated through such
staggering undertakings as a retractable roofed auditor-
ium, a municipal stadium, and an underground parking
lot topped with a magniﬁcent park.

The ﬁrst of these major projects, the auditorium,
combines in one dramatic building a convention hall, an
open-air amphitheater, a sports arena and an exhibition

hall. It will be so ﬂexible and adaptable that it will have_

year-round usage and an impressive earning potential.

The responsibility for the redevelopment of the 95.4-
acre Lower Hill district, which includes the construc-
tion and ultimate operation of this civic auditorium,
rests with the Public Auditorium Authority of Pitts-
burgh and Allegheny County.

The Lower Hill district was a welter of substandard
housing, obsolete commercial structures and narrow,
cobblestone streets and alleys.

The auditorium building will cover four acres. Its
exterior will have the shape of a hemisphere supported
by a steel cantilever beam. The roof’s center pivot will
be 145 feet from the floor. The dome’s exterior will be
stainless steel, while the interior will consist of perfor-
ated, baked enamel panels with a three inch, ﬁberglass,
acoustic blanket.

The hemispherical roof will have a 415-foot diameter
and will contain 2,950 tons of steel. It will consist of
eight sections, six of the movable. The bracing arm, 171/2
feet thick and three feet across, will weigh 1,100 tons.

The retractable roof is by far the most outstanding of
the auditorium’s many unique features. The six, three
foot thick, 260 ton sections will travel on 30-inch rail-
road wheels planted on heavy duty track circling the
arena. Each of the sections will be powered by its own
100 horsepower motor and will have brakes in case of

power failure. The controls will be in a separate con-
trol room, but there will also be individual controls under
the stands. When closed, the leaves will be sealed by
synthetic rubber, and safety gutters inside will protect
against leaks. In case of a sudden storm the roof could
be closed against a 60 m.p.h. wind in less than three
minutes.

Other unique feat-ures include telescopic seating sec-
tions and a hydraulically lifted seating section which,
when raised, uncovers the stage and orchestra pit. Per-
manent seats will be provided for 9280 spectators plus
134-0 seats ﬁxed on telescopic stands. There are also 750
additional seats made available when the hydraulic sec-
tion covering the stage is lowered in place. The sound
system, lights, "and curtains for the 116 by 66 foot stage
would be on the underside of the seat section.

A high pressure, combined heating and air condition-
ing system will be at work in all public spaces. The
arena will have an unusual weather feature, that of
creating its own weather like a dirigible hanger. The
ventilating system will prevent rain from falling while
the dome is closed. The showers would result from moist
air rising from the floor, condense against the cool roof
and fall back to the ﬂoor in -the form of rain drops.

In addition to the civic auditorium, the over-all
plan includes new residential and commercial develop-
ment and a tract for future cultural purposes.

By virtue of the Crosstown Thorofare and its connec-
tions with the Penn-Lincoln Parkway and other major
traﬂic arteries, the area will be easily accessible from
any part of Western Pennsylvania.

Provisions for adequate parking has been a primary
consideration in the planning of the Lower Hill. There
will be approximately 1,300 car spaces around the
arena; 1,400 additional spaces within easy walking dis-
tance; and on the fringe another 1,000.

The next undertaking, which is still in the embryo
stage, is the Municipal Stadium. The planning of the
stadium became necessary when the existing facilities,

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

 

Pitt Stadium and Forbes Field, were found to lack suf-
ﬁcient parking areas and the extensive road system
necessary to disperse the -traffic. These adverse conditions
and the limited seating arrangements at Forbes Field
caused concern that the professional baseball and foot-
ball teams might move to another city. The loss of major
sporting events would be a serious blow to the Pitts-
burgh area, both in business and prestige. Therefore,
the stadium was conceived out of necessity and not an
ostentatious whim.

A committee was created to study all aspects of the
stadium’s planning. The committee studied 15 poten-
tial sites and found that the Monument Hill location
best met their criteria and was most likely to assure suc-
cess. Monument Hill is the Center of Allegheny County
and readily accessible for nearly 85% of the popula-
tion presently located to the north,south and east of the
Golden Triangle. Western Pennsylvania’s new vast
network of highways wlil all lead into the area. Other

used by downtown workers who could shuttle to town.

The professional teams, sports writers and other experts
have asked that the new facility be within a ﬁve-mile
radius of Downtown Pittsburgh.

The preliminary plans call for a 50,0.00 person seat-
ing capacity. The Pittsburgh area should not require a RETRACTIBLE TOP and

Stadium is now a concrete fact.

cultural and civic level of the city, but the year-round
use of these facilities becomes an activating force in
stimulating the city’s overall morale and economy. The
thousands of people who are attracted to conventions,

grams will not only be superbly entertained, but will also
further business by spending millions of dollars in the
Pittsburgh district.

SHIPPINGPORT

BY ROBERT S. FATYOL, AE ’62

The nuclear power plant at Shippingport, Pa. has
been producing electricity for the greater Pittsburgh
area since December 18, 1957. The Shippingport plant is
-the world’s ﬁrst full-scale atomic-electric plant ex-
clusively built to serve civilian needs. The plant was
the joint project of the Atomic Energy Commission
and the Duquesne Light Company of Pittsburgh with
the Westinghouse Corporation under contract to the
A. E. C. Since its completion in December, _1957,.the
plant has become an integral part of the Duquesne
Light Company power system.

Ground was broken for the plant on September 6,
1954 by President Eisenhower. This s-tarted the con-
struction of the nuclear portion of the plant by the
Westinghouse Corporation, which, including the ﬁrst
core, cost the combined interests $45,000,000. The tur-
bine-generating part of the plant was built by the
Duquesne Light Company, which also supervised. the
overall installation. Duquesne Light also contributed
the site and $5,000,000 toward the cost of the nuclear
portion of the plant.

The Shippingport plan-t has as its heat source a pres-
surized-water reactor. The one important reason for
its selection for the Shippingport plant was because the
technology of the pressurized-water reactor is by far
the most advanced of all the types known today. In
addition to being a radically new heat source, the nuc-
lear portion of the plant also signiﬁcantly affects the
overall design and operation of the plant.

A pressurized-water system consists of two main parts
—a primary system containing the nuclear reactor in
which heat is produced, and a secondary system to
which that heat energy is transferred for use in a steam
turbine. Water pumped through the primary system
flows over the nuclear fuel elements in the reactor,
absorbs heat from them, then flows to the heat exchang-
er, or steam generator. Here it gives up that heat to
water ﬂowing in the secondary system.

The whole primary system is under high pressure to
prevent the primary water from boiling. The secondary

40

system, however, is a relatively low-pressure system, so
that when secondary water absorbs heat in the steam
generator it turns to steam, thereby providing energy
in the necessary form to drive the turbine.

A pressurized-water reactor plant has several signi-
ﬁcant features. One important fact is that the primary
loop is physically isolated from the secondary system,
i.e., water from the primary does not enter the second-
ary. Thus, if any radioactive particles or ﬁssion products
ﬁnd their way into the primary system water, they are
conﬁned 'there——-they cannot contaminate the second-
ary system. This means that much of the secondary is
available for maintenance during operation.

The primary system in this type of reactor is pressur-
ized 'for several reasons. The chief reason is to prevent
boiling in the reactor. The pressurized-water system is
designed primarily to make use of relatively slow-mov-
ing thermal neutrons.

The water in a pressurized-water system serves a dual
function as a coolant and as a neutron moderator.
Neutrons given off by the ﬁssion process are traveling
at high speed. Collision with water molecules dissipates
some of their energy and slows them to the so-called
thermal level, where they are most efficient in causing
ﬁssion in uranium 235.

One of the most important facts about a pressurized-
water reactor is that it can be designed to have a
negative temperature coeﬂicient of reactivity. As a re-
sult, the reactor inherently -tends to maintain the power
level at which it is set. Thus, in a properly designed
pressurized-water system, the reactor automatically
maintains the correct power level with no controls be-
ing involved.

The primary system of -the PWR reactor can be di-
vided into two main parts—the reactor and the coolant

loop. The reactor consists of three main elements—-the '

pressure vessel, the nuclear-fuel assembly, or core, and
the control-rod assembly.

The reactor pressure vessel is a cylindrical structure,
formed of carbon-s-te'el plates and forgings. Internally,

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

the pressure vessel is approximately 31 feet high and
9 feet in diameter. The walls of the vessel are a little
over eight inches thick. Thermal shields prevent excess
heat generation in the vessel wall from gamma-ray radia-
tion.

The reactor is controlled by moving neutron-absorb-
ing control rods in and out of the fuel core. Other than
under emergency conditions, the chief function of the
control rods is to establish and maintain the power level
of the reactor. At the start of reactivity in the reactor,
criticality with full power was obtained with 12 con-
trol rods fully inserted, but as fuel burn-up and poison-
ing continued, rods were withdrawn in groups of four.
The lower section of the rods are made of the little-
known metal hafnium, the upper portion of a zirconium
alloy. The hafnium portion of the rod, which is the
neutron-absorbing end, is about 70 inches long, to cor-
respond to the length of the fuel in the fuel assemblies.
When fully inserted into the core, the lowest point of
the rod coincides with the lowest point of the fuel alloy.

The fuel assembly, or core, for the reactor uses both
highly enriched uranium 235 and natural uranium.
The core is so designed that the assembly of
natural-uranium elements, is made chain reacting by the
help of neutrons leaking from the highly enriched ele-
ments. The highly enriched elements are called the seed,
and the natural-uranium elements, the blanket. Initially
the seed will provide most of the reactivity, with the
blanket acting as a neutron-multiplying reﬂector. The
entire core is about 70 inches long, 81.5 inches in dia-
meter, and contains 145 fuel assemblies; 32 of these are
seed “clusters,” the remaining 113 are blanket assem-
blies. The seed clusters and blanket assemblies are ar-
ranged in the core in a deﬁnite pattern, for both nuclear
and heat distribution reasons. The blanket is ‘divided
into four regions which are designated according to
their position with respect to the seed clusters. The
coolant flow is distributed among the seed clusters and

blanket assemblies to compensate for heat flux varia-
tion from region to region.

The control system for the PWR primary plant con-
sists of two basic parts——sensing elements and instru-
mentation that indicate existing conditions, and controls
that react to these signals and maintain or restore pro-
per conditions. The reactor plant control is designed to
accomplish several different functions. It must provide
for m-anual start-up of the reactor in either a hot or
cold condition. In addition, the control system must
be capable of shut-down under two di1°ferent circum-
stances. It must be able to shut down the system under
normal conditions, and protect all equipment from
damage by decay heat. Also, the control must be able
to shut down the reactor automatically under condi-
tions that could lead to equipment damage if allowed to
continue. Last, the control must operate all auxiliary
ﬂuid systems in the main coolant loops.

The staff of the Shippingport plant includes sufficient
people to operate and maintain all equipment, including
the nuclear portion of the plant; to maintain all site
property; to perform -all the necessary industrial-hygiene
services; to provide plant security; and to perform the
necessary clerical services. This staff is, of course, or-
ganized to serve a dual purpose. As well as operation
and maintenance, it has the task of testing and evalu-
ating the plant. Of the 135 peopleat the plant about
26 are involved in full time testing, and gathering in-
formation. After operating experience has been ob-
tained, the staff can probably be reduced to perhaps 81.
This compares with 66 people for 9. conventional coal-
burning plant.

The Shippingport atomic-electric plant is a mile-
stone not only in the peaceful application of nuclear
power, but also in the progress and development of the
greater Pittsburgh area.

for this is that these two separate

of the might which Pittsburgh holds

pal stadium with one of the largest
seating capacities in the world and
many more sidelights to offer Pitts-
burghers a chance to relax. The en-
gineering of these projects is relat-
ed by Dick DeNezza.

In a summary of Pittsburgh’s pro-

not overlook the many single ac-
complishments centered in the City.
Pre-eminent among these is the
Westinghouse Shippingport Plant-
the world’s first full—scale, atomic-

this milestone in the City’s history.

You will also note a special eight-

Simpkins, widower with a small
son had just taken unto himself a
new bride. The small son was not too
keen on his new “mother” and told
visitors so.

“In that case,” said one woman, a
friend of Simpkin’s dead wife, “why
don’t you ask your daddy to take
her back and change her for some-

“I was splashing in the Zambezi

this tigress came along, the most
ferocious-looking beast I ever saw.
I had no weapons with me, so when
she paddled in my direction, I
splashed water in her face and she
swam away.”

Another explorer not to be out
done, spoke up.

“I can verify that story, ladies,”
he said, “I was coming down the
trlail to the river that same morning
and I met the same tigress, looking
very angry. To calm her, I kissed her
whiskers. Ladies, those whiskers were

Westinghouse-proposed solar sail
may permit 60,000 mph speeds in space. ..
and it will need no fuel at all!

Lunar reconnaissance—-and manned lunar colonies——may become realities
in the not-too-distant future.

But the exploration of deep space is entirely another matter. Distances
are tremendous—fuel requirements for chemical rockets are staggering-
navigation must be almost unbelievably precise.

As a partial answer to these problems, a Westinghouse scientist has
proposed the use of a solar sail which will harness the light of the sun. This
sail will require no fuel, it will be capable of fantastic speeds, and its design
will permit in-ﬂight navigational corrections. More important, this West-
inghouse approach could be cheaper and simpler than any other system
proposed for this same purpose.

Westinghouse develops new skin
for space craft. . : so they won’t burn up
re-entering earth’s atmosphere

At 6,000 mph, air friction is a problem for space craft re-entering earth’s
atmosphere, because skin temperatures can exceed 2,500°F. Without ade-
quate thermal protection, the incoming space vehicle will burn itself up
like a meteor.

Westinghouse has developed a new ablative material for use as the pro-
tecting outer skin for space craft. It has already been service-proven in
actual re-entry tests involving ﬁrings of ballistic missiles equipped with
nose cones of this material.

This new Westinghouse development should do much to help advance
our nation’s space exploration effort.

One of a series

_ ._ General Electric interviews
Dr. Richard Folsom, President of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,

to explore . . .

Teaching-
  A Career Opportunity
For the Engineer

Leading educators, statesmen and in-
dustrialists throughout the country are
greatly concerned with the current
shortage of high-caliber graduates who
are seriously considering a career in the
ﬁeld of science or engineering educa-
tion. Consequently, General Electric has
taken this opportunity to explore, Wlth
one of America’s eminent educators, the
opportunities and rewards teaching of-
fers the scientiﬁc or engineering student.

Q. is there in fact a current and con-
tinuing need for educators in technical
colleges and universities?

A. Colleges and universities providing
scientiﬁc and engineering educational
opportunities are hard pressed at the
present moment to obtain the services
of a sufﬁcient number of well-qualiﬁed
teachers to adequately carry out their
programs. Projected statistical studies
show that this critical need could ex-
tend over the next 15 or 20 years.

Q. Why is this need not being met?

A. There are probably three main rea-
sons. These might be classed under con-
ditions of ﬁnancial return, prestige as-
sociated with the position, and lack
of knowledge and understanding on the
part of the college student of the ad-
vantages and rewards teaching as a
career can afford.

Q. What steps have been taken to make
education a more attractive field to en-
gineering students?

A. Steps are being taken in all areas.
For example, we have seen a great deal
in the newspapers relating educators’
salaries to the importance of the job
they are doing. Indications are that
these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.
Greater professional stature is being
achieved as the general public under-
stands that the youth of our nation is
the most valuable natural resource that
we possess . . . and that those associated
with the education of this youth have

one of the most important assignments
in our country today.

Q. Aside from salary, what rewards can
a career in education offer as opposed
to careers in government or industry?

A. The principal rewards might be free-
dom to pursue your own ideas within
the general framework of the school, in
teaching, research and consulting activ-
ities. As colleges and universities are
normally organized, a man has three
months in the summer time to engage
in activities of his own choice. In addi-
tion, the educator is in direct contact
with students and he has the satisfac-
tion of seeing these students develop
under his direction . . . to see them take
important positions in local and na-
tional affairs.

Q. What preparation should an en-
gineering student undertake for a teach-
ing career?

A. In college, the engineering student
should obtain a basic understanding of
science, engineering science, humanities
and social sciences with some applica-
tions in one or more professional en-
gineering areas. He should have fre-
quent career discussions with faculty
members and his dean. During graduate
work, a desirable activity, the student
should have an opportunity to do some
teaching.

Q. Must an engineering student obtain
advanced degrees before he can teach?
A. It is not absolutely necessary. On the
other hand, without advanced degrees,
advancement in the academic world
would be extremely difﬁcult.

Q. How valuable do you feel industrial
experience is to an engineering or scien-
tific educator?

A. Industrial experience for a science

sENEnAL@ELEcTnIc

educator is desirable; however, with a
senior engineering educator, industrial
experience is a “must”. An ideal en-
gineering educator should have had
enough industrial experience so that he
understands the problems and responsi-
bilities in carrying a project from its
formative stages to successful comple-
tion, including not only the technical
aspects, but the economic and personal
relationships also.

Q. What do you consider to be the op-
timum method by which an educator can
obtain industrial experience?

A. There are many methods. After
completion of graduate school, perhaps
the most beneﬁcial is a limited but in-
tensive work period in industry. Con-
sulting during an academic year or
summer is a helpful activity and is
desirable for older members of the
staff. Younger educators usually need
experience in “living with the job”
rather than providing consultant’s ad-
Vice to the responsible individual.

Q. Based on your experience, what per-
sonal characteristics are possessed by
successful professors?

A. Primarily, successful professors have I

an excellent and growing knowledge of
their subjects, are interested in people,
and transmit enthusiasm. They have an
ability to explain and impart informa-
tion with ease. They generate ideas and
carry them out because they are de-
voted to developing their ﬁelds of
knowledge. They desire personal free-
dom and action.

This etched metal bar ( at left ) directs the electromechan-
ical positioning of cutting edges in the first all electronically-
controlled machine tool line.

Developed by Hughes Products, the commercial activity
of Hughes, this unique control system integrates any de-
sired number of machine tools into one production line.
Milling, drilling, tapping, boring and reaming operations
are performed automatically to precise tolerances. Other
commercial activities at Hughes Products center around the
research, development and production of semiconductor de-
vices, specialized electron tubes, and other advanced elec-

tronics systems and components.

The wide range of interest present in the commercial area
of Hughes is also typical of other Hughes activities. The
Research and Development Laboratories are conducting in-
vestigations into Advanced Airborne Electronics Systems,
Plastics, Guided Missiles, Space Vehicles, Subsurface Elec-
tronics Systems, Global and Spatial Communications Sys-
tems...and many more. Hughes in Fullerton is developing
radar systems which position beams in space by electronic
rather than mechanical means. Complete modern manufac-
turing facilities are maintained at El Segundo (advanced
armament control systems), Fullerton (3-D radar systems),
and Tucson, Arizona (Falcon IR and Radar guided missiles) .

The rapid growth of Hughes reﬂects the continuous ad-
vance in Hughes capabilities——providing an ideal environ-
ment for the engineer or physicist, whatever his ﬁeld of
interest.

Fabulous steps into the future, such as this, can be made only by men
with fabulous imaginations. A lot of such men work for General Motors
and its divisions. There’s room for a lot more—maybe you.

In addition to research in the automotive and appliance ﬁelds, General
Motors and its divisions are concerned with solar energy, astronautics,
astrodynamics, electronics, and many fields of space engineering. If
these areas of scientiﬁc study challenge your imagination, perhaps
GM has a place for you at one of its plants in 71 cities.

Here is a real opportunity to put your imagination to work on every-
thing from tiny transistors to dynamic diesels. Write General Motors,
