HYBRID

In a broad sense the field of hybrid computation com-
bines the features of analog computers with the features of
digital computers. Hybrid computers were developed in the
late 1950’s to handle certain types of problems which were
beyond the capabilities of either digital or analog computers
alone. Much of the development came in the aerospace
industry where simulation of complex systems was done on
analog computers. The resulting data was evaluated and
the solution optimized with a digital computer. The hybrid
computer combines the best features of both computers —
the speed and ﬂexibility of the analog with the memory, logic
capability and accuracy of the digital. Therefore for a com-
plex problem, the analog sub—unit can perform the dynamic
simulation and the high speed solution of differential equa-
tions while the digital sub-unit performs the static analysis
and accurate solution of algebraic equations. Thus the prob-
lem can be evaluated from both aspects with the digital and
and analog capabilities available in a single computer.

The digital computer is a descendant of the abacus or
ﬁnger counting. This device uses digits to represent the
actual numbers. The two basic features which characterize
the digital computer are its handling of data as discrete
values and its step—by-step operation. In the digital machine
all values are represented as combinations of 1’s and O’s.
The accuracy of the representation of the number is not
limited by the quality of the equipment or the preciseness of
some measuring device. The only limiting factor is the num-
ber of bits contained in the memory registers, that is, the
length of the number in its stored form. Because of this
digital representation scientiﬁc notation can be used. This
form allows for the representation of a large range of num-
bers with only a limited number of digits being needed.

In the digital computer the solution of a problem is
obtained in a stepwise manner. One step or instruction is
executed and then another. Since only one variable can be
operated on in a given step, the solution of a problem may
require an extremely large number of steps and accordingly
a long execution time. The time required to solve a prob-
lem depends on its complexity, that is, the number of
arithmetic steps involved. This stepwise operation has ad-
vantages. In some cases tht method of solution is dependent
on some intermediate value. This value can be tested by
the digital computer and the corresponding steps can be
taken. Thus the digital computer has logic or decision
making capabilities.

Another valuable feature of the digital computer is its
memory. Through its core memory or its peripheral memory
devices such as magnetic tapes or disks the digital can store
a large amount of information. This stored information
may be instructions and data needed bv the computer to
solve a problem. In this manner the digital computer can
easily ‘remember’ how to solve a given problem. The dig-
ital’s peripheral memory devices also provide a convenient
method of storing information for future reference and use.

The digital computer is able to perform only a limited
number of arithmetic operations. The scope of these opera-
tions is usually addition and multiplication. All other opera-
tions which must be done involve the use of numerical
techniques. For instance if integration is needed it must
be done by repeated multiplication and summation. These
numerical techniques often lead to inaccuracy due to the
approximations involved. Also the numerical techniques
often require a large number of repeated operations and thus
a long execution time.

On the other hand, analog computation stems from the
graphical solution of problems. Analog devices rely on the
analogous relationships between the physical quantities
within the computer and the quantities associated with the
problem under study. The solution of the problem is ob-
tained by measuring some continuously varying voltage in
the computer. Thus the analog computer is a continuous de-
vice giving continuous solutions rather than discrete values.

The operation of the analog computer depends on the
physical laws governing the behavior of the circuit elements
in the computer. Variables and constants in a problem are
represented in the computer as voltages and currents in
electrical networks. These networks consist of resistances,
capacities, and operational ampliﬁers. To program the
analog computers, one connects together various components
of the computer with patch cords. Programming techniques
consist largely of substituting electrical elements in the com-
puter for the analogous physical elements in the problem.

 

For analog computation, the variables and constants of
the problem must be scaled. In the analog computer only a
limited range of voltages is available, for instance from
-100 volts to +100 volts. The values in the probltm must
be scaled so that their representation in the computer does
not exceed the range of the computer. This scaling is often
one of the most time—consuming steps in the solution. This
task is complicated by the fact that the exact range of the
problem variable is not always known until the problem is
solved. Often this scaling must be a trial—and—error-procedure.

In the analog computer the solutions of a problem are
voltages. The accuracy of the solution is directly related to
the quality of the circuit elements in the computer. The
accuracy of the solution is rarely better than .0170. This per-
cent of accuracy is not necessarily a disadvantage though.
Often the constants of the problem are not known to a
greater accuracy.

Since the analog computer does not deal with discrete
values, the solutions are usually in the form of a graph.
These graphs can be viewed on a cathode ray oscilloscope
or an X-Y plotter. The oscilloscope offers the advantage of
speed of operation, that is the problem can be run faster and
the solution can still be recorded. The plotter offers the
advantage of having a permanent copy of the solution.

One of the valuable features of the analog computer is its
ability to directly perform many mathematical operations.
The following operations are conveniently available with
tht analog computer:

1) multiplication of a variable by a constant
2) addition of two or more variables
3) integration of a variable
4) multiplication of two variables
5) generation of many continuous functions such as
sine, cosine, logarithm, and exponential
Of great importance is the availability of the integral in the
analog computer.

Another feature of the analog computer is that all of the
variables of the problem are operated on simultaneously.
This means that the solution time is relatively independent
of the complexity of the problem and depends only on the
characteristics of the computing elements.

The hybrid computer consists of a digital computer and
an analog computer linked together by an interface. The
interface converts the digital signals to analog signals to
digital signals. The extent of hybridization can range from
the digital computer setting only the initial conditions of the
analog’s integrators to the digital only using the analog as
an integrator. The true hybrid lies somewhere between these
two extremes.

The advantages of analog and digital computers are
combined in the hybrid system. The analog’s speed of inte—
gration and ability to operate on continuous variables is
combined with the digital’s logic capabilities, memory, and
accuracy. However, the hybrid system does not eliminate
the undesirable features of each type of computer. The
hybrid’s overall precision is that of the analog not that of the
digital. The scaling of the problem is still necessary for the
part of the problem to be run on the analog. In addition,

certain types of errors are introduced by the hybrid system.
These errors are primarily from approximation errors in
the conversion of analog signals to digital signals and vice
versa.

When an iterative technique is being used to solve a set
of equations, the analog can go through a set of solutions as
many as 200 times per second. The human is not fast
enough to take advantage of this speed. When the digital
is used to control the analog, this speed can be used to an
advantage. It can reset the conditions in the analog for
another iteration as soon as the analog is ready. A human
operator can reset the analog for another iteration about
every 15 seconds whereas the digital can accomplish this
200 times every second.

The hybrid computer system has been used to an ad-
vantage in a large number of situations. It is by no means
intended to eliminate the need for digital computers and
analog computers. The hybrid computer is used to solve
types of problems that require both analog and digital
methods. The following is a list of some of the current
uses of hybrid computers:

1) high speed data acquisition

1) process simulation

3) system optimization

4) simulation of man—machine systems

5) process control

6) automatic checkout of equal equipment
The ﬁeld of hybrid computation has existed for only about
ten years. Currently equipment technology leads the devel-
opment of hybrid computing techniques. Consequently there
is a considerable amount of work to be done in the ﬁeld of
developing techniques to effectively use the hybrid
computer.

With the completion of Benedum Hall, the School of
Engineering will have a hy-brid computer system. The above
ﬁgure shows the proposed system conﬁguration. With this
hybrid computer, engineering students at the University of
Pittsburgh will have the opportunity to learn hybrid com-
putation, to develop hybrid computing techniques, and to
use the hybrid computer in research.

Notes

From The Dean

Another academic year is drawing to a close; another
class of seniors is completing a first phase of their Engineer-
ing education. This has been a most successful year for us.
I believe we have made signiﬁcant strides toward better and
more effective communication between faculty and students
at all levels and in all matters. Student involvement in our
Engineering school planning and operating committees has
been, insofar as I can see, very successful. My thanks and
my congratulations to Cabinet and particularly to its presi-
dent, Ed Levine, for their strong leadership in this effort!

by Dean Harold E. Hoelscher

This past Engineers’ Week has, in every possible way,
been the best I have yet seen at Pitt. There was more
enthusiasm, more student involvement, and a stronger com-
petition than ever before. The Service Project and Parents
Night were unexpectedly and most dramatically successful.
My congratulations to the whole of Central Planning and
in particular to Max Pepper for leading the effort! I want
especially to note the success of the Service Project and the
efforts of Rich Bernstein to make it so.

I think I once promised this senior class a graduation
from Benedum Hall. That promise is obviously not being
kept — for this I am sorry —— and it was undoubtedly made
from a mountain of ignorance about how construction
normally proceeds. At present we are about a year late and
should begin the next November. It remains clear that

this will be, once we lay our hands on it, one of the finest
facilities for Engineering education in the country. Our
seniors will simply have to come back and visit us in it.
They will, of course, always be welcome. My congratula-
tions to them on completing their degree requirements and
my very good wishes to each for a successful professional
career!

Once again, I think we may look forward to next year
with continued optimism. Our faculty is growing in quan-
tity, quality, and national stature. The new freshman class
once again seems to be a cut above previous classes and we

are getting the numbers we want. Financial support of the

School from industry and other sources is developing well
and will permit development of our facilities in the direc-
tions demanded by our programs. I hope we may all con—
tinue to work toward the goals we have set for ourselves
in Engineering at Pitt.

The Study of Structure

PART II OF THE MICROSCOPIC STUDY OF METAL

by Paul A. K ezmarslry .

Photomicrography

Introduction

In the February issue appeared the first part of this
article in which mounting, polishing and etching of a sam-
ple were discussed. Part II of ‘The Study of Structure’
follows.

Photomicrography

Basically, photomicrography is taking pictures of a sam-
ple in question with the aid of a microscope. Since one is
using the microscope as a type of projector, he should know
the photographic principles involved with it. Because the
specimen is of such a nature that prohibits light transmission,
light must be reflected off the surface to produce an
image. The source of this light is in most cases a tungsten
bulb or a carbon arc, although other forms of light are
available for varyinggneeds. The light is cast upon the sur-
face and is reﬂected up through the objective and eyepieces
and ﬁnally into the eye. Being formed by the lenses are real
and virtual images; real images are those that are formed
by the light passing through a point; whereas, virtual im-
ages are those that art formed if imaginary lines are ex-
tended from the rays of light passing through the lenses to
an imaginary focal plane. The images which are formed on
the retina are examples of virtual images; while that formed
on the ground glass screen of the camera is a real image.

When light passes through a different medium, i.e.
air to glass, the varying wavelengths are acted upon dif-
ferently; the shorter wavelengths are bent toward the axis;
such as:

ezieﬂ gap 6
KED /aeeeﬂ 3
NON -
Amp,Qy\m-.¢ ACMROMATIC. Aﬁocnkotnerric

Because of this axial bending, the image is surrounded by
color bands and lack deﬁnition; this is termed chromatic
aberration. To remedy this situation a correcting lens is

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER — APRIL, I969

added to the objective. Achromatic objectives are corrected
chromatically for two color regions — red and green. Apoch—
romatic objectives are corrected chromatically for three
regions — red, blue, and green. Even though a lens may
be corrected for chromatic aberrations, another problem
is that of spherical aberrations, which are the result
of light waves striking a simple lens. Formed along the
principle axis of the lens are a series of images of the
source which are caused by the light which, in passing
through the periphery of the lens, is reflected to a greater
degree; thereby, the image formed is closer to the emergent
side of the lens that would be the same wavelength pass-
ing along the principle axis. For the achromatic objective
the lens is corrected spherically for green lights and chro-
matically for red and green. For the apochromatic objective
the lens is corrected spherically for blue and green; there-
for, one should use a green ﬁller when using an achro-
mantic lens. When the achromatic objective is used at
low power, it is used in conjunction with a I-Iuygeian eye-
piece. When the achromatic objectives are used at high
power, a corrected eyepiece can also be used. For apoch-
romantic lens, which are corrected chromatically for all light
and spherically for violet and green, a violet, green or blue
ﬁlter can be used and better resolution will be attained the
shorter the wavelength.

All objectives that are used have several inherent quali-
ties about them; one of these is magniﬁcation. The objec-
tives are available in varying powers of magniﬁcation, and
the total magniﬁcation is the product of the objective and the
eyepiece. In photography to determine the magniﬁcation, a
ground glass screen and a stage micrometer are used. The
stage micrometer consists of flat piece of metal for reflected
light, or a piece of glass for transmitted light onto which
lines have been engraved within 0.01 mm. The micrometer
is used as the object and is projected onto the glass screen.
From a measurement of the image of the micrometer pro-
jected on the screen and the distance between the lines, the
magniﬁcation can be calculated by using a simple ratio.

Also an inherent feature of the objective is the numerical
aperture. This is the one of the most important factors in
the design of an objective. If the wavelength of the light
being used remains constant, the numerical aperture is
nearly proportional to the resolving power of the objective.
The n.a. is equal to N (sin 0) where N is the index of
refraction of the media and o is one-half the angle of a
cone of light with its base at the objective lens and its
vertex at the objective. The amount of detail is directly
proportional to the angle 0, i.e. the greater 0, the greater
will be the resolving power. The amount of light entering

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER —- APRIL, I969

the lens is also governed by the index of refraction through
which it passes. This is illustrated below:

OEJECTIUE /mm£L°Sl0AI

Since the index of refraction of oil is greater than that of air,
more light is directed through the objective.

Still another inherent factor, is the resolving power
which is the ability to separate details. The resolving power
is dependent on the wavelength of illumination and the
numerical aperture. For a "beam of light that just floods
the objective, the resolving power is equal to ‘/2 n.a.; it
can be seen that the shorter the wavelength or the greater
the n.a., the greater will be the resolution. By calculation
the minimum magniﬁcation required to see detail is 400 x
n.a.; however, this magniﬁcation is, in most instances, un—
comfortable to the eye. Generally, the ideal situation is
between the powers of 500 and 1000 x n.a. The upper limit
is usually not exceeded since a lack of sharpness and detail
tends to occur. The upper limit can be exceeded, however,
if the oil immersion objective and good techniques are used.
Since the primary purpose of the microscope is resolution
and not magniﬁcation, any magniﬁcation beyond the upper
limit will not give any added detail; this situation is given
the name of empty magniﬁcation. This empty magniﬁca-
tion is permitted and sometimes is desired, however, when
the image is to be examined at a distance of more than 10
inches, such as that which might be used in a projector.

Of all the necessities for a microscopic observation and
photograph, one of the most important is illumination. The
light that is most widely used, tungsten ﬁlament, produces
a variety of wavelengths of which the undesirable ones are
blocked out by the use of ﬁlters. The color of the ﬁlter
should act as a supplement to the color of the detail in
interest thereby causing the detail to appear sharper due to
the absorption of light. For example, the blue .filter would
be used for apochromatic objectives; whereas, the yellow-
green is used for achromatic ones. Also adding to the ﬁnal
quality of the image are the ﬁeld and aperture diaphragms.
The aperture has the principle function of controlling the
amount of light that is allowed to enter the objective. The
best possible resolution is obtained when the aperture is
adjusted such that approximately 90% of the objective is
illuminated. If the aperture is closed too much, the numeri-
cal -aperature of the objective is reduced resulting in a

‘I5

decrease in resolution. The ﬁeld diaphragm is also located
inside the microscope, but, while the aperture has its focus
on -the back of the objective, the ﬁeld diaphragm has its
focus on the plane of the specimen. Its principle function is
to reduce glare and light reflection within the system. Be-
cause of this reduction, improved resolution is obtained by
improved contrast. The correct setting for the ﬁeld dia-
phragm is such that its image just enters the ﬁeld of the
objective deﬁned by the limiting diaphragm of the eyepiece.
When a protograph is made, the ﬁeld diaphragm should be
adjusted to the larger dimension of the plate».

When making a photomicrograph one should follow a-

certain procedure. The sample in question should be prop-
erly polished and etched; next the magniﬁcation is chosen;
the bellows of the camera are adjusted to the proper length
for the magniﬁcation; the source of illumination should be
centered, the correct ﬁlter chosen, and the tungsten light be
at maximum intensity; the aperature diaphragm set to give
proper illumination; and after the image has been focused
on the ground glass screen, the ﬁlm holder is inserted.

A point to remember about the ﬁlm holder is the in-
sertion of ﬁlm. The emulsion side should be in the “up”
position; this is easily determined by convenient notches on
one corner of the ﬁlm. When they are in the upper right
hand corner, the ﬁlm is in the correct position.

Another key point in mind is that of exposure time ac-
cording to illumination. If the correct time is not known, a
trial plate must be run. The trial plate is divided into ﬁve
sections, and exposures are made; the exposures are made
such that the next exposure is twice that of the preceding
one. After developing the ﬁlm, the proper or best time for
the speciﬁc ﬁlm can be determined.

If all of these steps of the procedure are followed, a very
good photomicrograph may result.

PROCESSING THE NEGATIVE

Composing the ﬁlm used in the photographic holder are
a gelatin-base material and an emulsion. Impregnated with-
in the gelatin is the emulsion composed of silver halide salts
—— chloride, bromide, or iodide. When any type of illumina-
tion, with the exception of red light, falls upon the ﬁlm,
the salts are exposed and become reduceable by certain
chemical agents. The extent of sensitization is proper
tional to the intensity and duration of the light. Auong this
line one must consider a ﬁlm with a varying color range
and light sensitivity. There are two main types of ﬁlm in
general use —— orthochromatic and panchromatic. The for-
mer is affected by green and blue light, and the latter is
affected by all visible light. In processing (developing) a
negative three successive steps are used: the ﬁrst step is the
developer which has the ability to rduce exposed silver salts
and should be used for ﬁve minutes; the next step is the
stop bath which is used to stop the developing action; and
ﬁnal step is the ﬁxer which is used to fix the image by means
of a solvent and hardner, and it is used for twice the de-
veloping time. After the ﬁlm is done in the ﬁxer, it is
washer in running water and hung to dry thoroughly.

‘I6

Contrast, which is the most desireable feature in a nega-
tive, is merely the difference between light and dark areas.
There are several factors which inﬂuence contrast; one of
these is the developing time which tends to increase contrast
with an increase in time. Since the surface of the. ﬁlm is in
contact with the developer,i t is adviseable to agitate the
solution or shake the ﬁlm to improve contrast. Another
factor inﬂuencing contrast is the emulsion speed; contrast 1!
tends to vary invtrsely with emulsion speed. And one of )3
the most important factors affecting the ﬁnal contrast is the j 
developer itself. The are two major types of developers in " "
use — Hydroquinone and Metol. Hydroquinone is a very
high contrast type and will reduce only the salts that have
been oxidized; whereas, Metol is a very reactive developer, w
and will reduce all of the salts that have been exposed along ,-g
with some that have not which, in effect, results in low con-
trast and fog. It has been found that excellent results are‘”'‘‘
obtained by using a mixture of both developers.

«J

To evaluate tht negative there are several points to look
for. These are critical sharpness, flatness of ﬁeld, correct con- if
trast, and composition. Critical sharpness is the amount and 
ﬁneness of detail present; flatness of ﬁeld is the term applied; ‘
to being in focus from the center to the edges; correct con-
trast is present when there is a very distinct difference be- *-
teen the whites and blackss of the negative; and composition
is among other things, the selection of a representative ﬁeld,
which is pleasing to look at; the factor which produces a "‘
ﬁne print, that is an overall transition from white to gray ;I__.
-to -black over the entire negative. /

-.r’‘''.

‘L

MAKING A PRINT

After the negative has been thoroughly dried, prints can «.4
then be made. Used in printing are varying contrast papers
to match or counterbalance the contrast of the negative; the '
papers range in contrast from F-0 to F5, with F-5 having the
highest contrast. The choice of the paper is directly de- 4
pendent upon the contrast that is present in the negative,
i.e. if high contrast is present, a low contrast paper such ,__I
as F-1 or -2 should be used. The print time and light in- 
tensity should be varied according to the density of the nega-
tive image, and in some instances a trial and error method -
must be used. After several prints are made, however, %
some “feel” for the process is gained.

The process that is used in the method of printing is
called “contact printing” which is surface to surface emul-
sion contact. The notches on the negative, again, come into 3
play and are placed in the upper right hand corner which ‘g
signiﬁes that the emulsion side is “up”. After placing the

paper emulsion side down, the exposure is made.

Having ﬁnished the exposure, the print is then developed
in much the same manner as the negative was developed —
developer for approximately one minute; short stop for an
instant; and ﬁxer for several minutes. The print should then
be washed for about thirty minutes in agitated, cold water
to “set” the print. To dry the print a rotating belt dryer is
used; the print is placed image side up and dried.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER — APRIL, I969

The determining factors in a good print are that of con-
trast and ﬁne resolution. The contrast should be definite
sharpness between black and white with an even dispersion
of grays. To enhance the total image even further, a glossy
type paper is used; this also makes the print very suitable
for mounting.

STEEL STRUCTURE

The basic understanding of the type of structure that is
present in a carbon steel comes from, mainly, the iron-
carbon diagram. The dividing line for carbon steels is the
eutectoid line with a 0.80% carbon content. This line divides
steels into hypo- and hypereutectoid types —— with hypo-
being to the left with less than 0.80% carbon and hyper- to
the right with more than 0.80.% The structure of a hypo-
eutectoid is that of ferrite and pearlite; a hypereutectoid
structure is pearlite and cementite.

A very important phase on the diagram is that in which
pearlite is formed. The maximum amount of pearlite is
found along the 0.80% carbon line, and it is composed of an
equilibrium structure of ferrite and cementite in a lamellar
array. It is formed by cooling from the austenite region, and
its structure may vary according to the increase or decrease
in carbon content from the 0.80% line. If it is lower than
0.80% there will be less pearlite and more pro eutectoid
ferrite; whereas, if it is greater, more pro—eutectoid cementite
and less pearlite is found.

Also playing an important part in the formation of pear-
lite, is austenite. It is the high temperature, stable solid
solution. Austenite is the former of pearlite, ferrite, and
cementite and does so on decomposition during its cooling.

 FAILURE 

You'll never get anywhere without it.

Nothing helps a young engineer's
career like being given a challenge.
Which is another way of saying a chance

immediately. They make their own de-

You're living dangerously, and you
love it.

You fought the professor all semes-
ter, and got an A in spite of it.

The girl you’ve been eyeing likes
your style.

It’s spring. That’s dangerous.

But the one place where you
shouldn’t have to live quite on the edge
is on the road. Now you don’t, thanks
to new safety features in cars . . . and the
remarkable radial tire.

Radials are a marvelous invention
in rubber and rayon cord. They last:
twice as long as regular tires, and even
give you better gas mileage. On wet, slip-
pery pavements, they grip like ﬂy paper.

A point of interest—The Dynacor®
rayon cord in radial tires is made by FMC
Corporation, the same company that
makes rayon for the “throwaway bikini”
your date is working up courage to wear.

This same company that builds egg
handling systems also builds ﬁre engines.

Each day you see FMC products
around and you’ve never known it.

FMC also makes petrochemicals,
pumps, freeze dry equipment, practically
anything dealing with food growing
machinery and industrial chemicals, and
more. We are one of the country's top 60
corporations.

FMC is a creative company that’s
making an impact on the American way
of life. Perhaps you’d like to help. For

tive brochure, “Careers with FMC.” FMC

Minimizing the danger of

lightning damage.

Buildings and expensive industrial equipment are vul-
nerable to one of nature’s most destructive forces, lightning.
The uncontrolled momentary overvoltage caused by light-
ning results in a breakdown of electrical insulation causing
short circuits and damage to the equipment involved. The
tremendous amount of energy released along with the high
volta.ge in a surge of lightning can damage buildings that
are struck and can cause ﬁres. However, the chances of
such disastrous effects can be minimized by the use of
proper protection.

Electrical systems can be damaged by lightning in a
number of ways. A conductor can receive a direct hit from
a lightning surge. A conductor can pick up lightning volt-
ages from a stroke to a nearby poor conductor, or by in-
duction from a stroke that hits near by. However, conduc-
tors can be protected from the damaging effects of lightning
by building construction or protective equipment. A piece
of equipment can be protected if a metallic cage is built
surrounding it. This cage must have all joints bonded
together electrically. This cage will divert lightning around

26

the electrical conductor, thus protecting it from the effects
of lightning currents. The best protection from lightning
is a building of all metal construction with all joints elec-
trically bonded and the walls well earthed. Electrical sys-
tems contained inside such a building could for all practical
purposes be considered safe and free from lightning either
from direct hit or from induction. The building could re-
ceiveia direct hit and any circuits or people inside would
feel no effects or damage. If a wood or masonry building is
struck by lightning and there are no earthed reinforcement
rods or grounded leads the How of current is obstructed
since such materials are practically insulators and the re-
sulting high voltage is likely to shatter some of the build-

ing materials. However, this type of building can be pro-
tected to a high degree by rods, masts, and overhead ground
wires. These types of protection devices are placed to catch
the lightning stroke and carry it to the ground by a heavy
cable which is well earthed. The high lightning current is
transmitted to the ground through this system thus eliminat-
ing the high voltage to earth or the building or the equip-
ment to be protected. A masonry building with a metal
roof and metal reinforcement in the walls which is in good
contact with the ground or well earthed will offer excellent
protection. If this building has a metal floor which is in
good electrical contact with the reinforcement in the walls
and the metal roof this will form a Faraday cage which
offers very good protection.

Lightning current can be induced into a plant’s electrical
system directly into unshielded structures or they can be
brought into a completely shielded building through the
conductors. Motors are the most vunerable to overvoltage
surges in a plant. The insulation in rotating machines has
a low capability to withstand overvoltage. Motor or genera-
tor insulation can be damaged in two ways. Voltage from
conductors to machine iron as well as voltage between
adjacent turns of a coil winding must be limited. Surge
Voltage from conductors to a frame iron of a motor or
generator can be limited by lightning arrestors that spark
over at a value somewhat higher than normal system voltage
and divert the lightning current safely to ground. Turn—to-
turn failures can be prevented by installing capacitors from
line to ground in parallel with the arrestors. This will
temporarily absorb some of the energy of the lightning
surge.

A typical misconception is that grounding and earthing
are the same. But actually they are two quite different pro-
tection procedures. Both are extremely important in pro-
tecting electrical systems, buildings, and people from light-
ning damage. Electrical connection to -earth is called
earthing. Grounding is connection to any extensive metallic
system that may or may not be earthed. The usual practice
in earthing is to drive a metallic rod into the earth. For
earthing to be effective as a sole means of protection against
lightning the electrical resistance to the earth should be low.
If resistance to earth is high, lightning or system fault cur-
rents can produce high voltage drops to earth which may
cause damage or shock. The safest practice is to use a com-
bination of grounding and earthing. All earth connections
such as rods and all availablt buried metal systems should
be tied together and connected solidly to internal piping,
conduit, equipment frames, and metal buildings. Quality
of protection is only slightly less in buildings of other con-
struction if all metal piping and equipment frames are tied
to the lightning protection -system.

Metal supports of TV antennas are lightning rods and
should be treated as such. They should be well earthed to
conduct the lightning current to tht earth as effectively as
possible. A lightning arrestor on the receiver end of the
conventional twin lead-in wire would be of little help in
this connection. Badly earthed TV antenna supports have
been the cause of lightning damage and ﬁres.

The University —- 60 Years Ago

A 1908 graduate describes

the University as it was then

The University of my student days was an entirely dif-
ferent kind of institution from what it is today. I graduated
in mechanical engineering in 1908, in the last class which
used the name, The Western University of Pennsylvania.
We had a small engineering school and associated with us
was a group of liberal arts students, housed in three build-
ings on a hill on the Northside. The schools of medi-
cine, dentistry, pharmacy and law were far removed from
us, way over in the city in four locations.

Chancellor Samuel B. McCormacl< came to the Univer-
sity in 1904, following the administrations of Dr. William
I. Holland, later Director of the Carnegie Museum, and of
Dr. John Brashear, then famous as an astronomer and
manufacturer of large telescopes, and probably the most
beloved citizen of Pittsburgh at that time. With the ex-
ception of Dr. Brashear, I believe that all Chancellors have
been Presbyterian ministers until the arrival of Dr. Bowman
in the early twenties.

There were about sixty engineers in my class. They were
all serious minded students who had prepared in the high
schools and private academies of the surrounding area. A
large majority of them commuted from their homes in vari-
ous towns in Western Pennsylvania. Commuting in those
days was quite an undertaking, as it involved long rides on
trains and in miserable little electric street cars. There were
about a half dozen co—eds in liberal arts.

I feel very strongly that we had excellent professors. Most
of them were mature men who made teaching their lifetime
occupation. Dr. Daniel Carhart, the Dean, taught civil engi-
neering, Stewart Bankson and Lauson Stone in mechanical
engineering, Smith in design, were all ﬁne men, as were
Berger in German, Dr. Frost in physics, and Joe Beck in
economics. Alexander Silverman in chemistry, was an ex-
ceptional teacher.

Good teachers, serious minded students and very small
classes certainly contribute to the educational process.

40

by Phillip E. Angle

Our faculty members had written some books and done
some research but their main job was with students, in-
structing them and preparing them for their future in the
industrial world.

The academic requirements were not as severe as they
are today. I recall that upon entrance my record in high
school was accepted for all subjects in which I had studied.
Only in solid geometry did I have to have a tutor and take
an entrance examination.

Some engineering colleges at that time did not include
in their curriculums any courses in languages, English or
history. We were more fortunate as we did spend a reason-
able amount of time on such subjects.

Mr. Philip E. Angle

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER — APRIL, I969

 
 

There were no graduate students in the engineering
school. The era of post baccalaureate degrees had not arrived
in the engineering schools of the country. In all of my forty
years in the steel industry I knew probably less than a dozen
men, actually engaged in manufacturing, who had advanced
degrees. At the time of my graduation I was aware that a
continuation into post graduate study would have been
advantageous. Later I attended lectures and was tutored in
metallurgy by University men.

A common practice in those days in the steel industry
for college graduates, who aimed for management positions,
was to get jobs at the bottom, which gave them an under-
standing of labor, processes and management, which they
otherwise would never have acquired.

Physical training at the University was not very satis-
factory. We had required gymnasium classes, and some
track and field work, if you cared for it. Football was under-
going some development, with players mostly from the
professional schools and little part being taken by the
engineers.

A student’s life in those days was relatively peaceful. We
experienced no wars and we expected that there would
never be any more war.

Our city environment, in many respects, was different
from that of today. We were still in the horse and buggy

Research
_ opportunities in_
highway engineering

The Asphalt Institute

suggests projects in five vital areas

Phenomenal advances in roadbuilding techniques dur-
ing the past decade have made it clear that continued
highway research is essential.

Here are ﬁve important areas of highway design
and construction that America’s roadbuilders need to
know more about:

1. Rational pavement thickness design and materials
evaluation. Research is needed in areas of Asphalt
rheology, behavior mechanisms of individual and com-
bined layers of pavement structure, stage construc-
tion and pavement strengthening by Asphalt overlays.

Traﬁic evaluation, essential for thickness design,
requires improved procedures for predicting future
amounts and loads.

Evaluation of climatic effects on the performance
of the pavement structure also is an important area
for research.

era. Most people had never ridden in an automobile and
there were no good roads outside the cities. We were sure
that aeroplanes would never be successful and television had
not yet been dreamed of. Marconi had recently developed
wireless telegraphy but the fruits of this had not reached
the public. The first moving picture theaters were just com-
ing into existence.

In many cultural areas the period was at least equal to
the present time. My recollection is that Pittsburgh sup-
ported three good professional theaters all winter and we
were privileged to see many great actors and actresses. The
symphony orchestra was first class under Emil Paur. Victor
Herbert had been in charge shortly before my time. We
had half a dozen newspapers in the city and the national
magazines were far superior to those of today.

The University as it existed in 1908 was plainly not
adequate to fulfill its destiny, so great changes were planned.
The first building in Oakland was put into service a year
after my graduation. This marked the change from many
decades of quite uniform conditions, very much as in my
time, to a long era of continuous and vigorous development,
through severe economic derangemcnts and four terrible
wars, until the present day when we have our most mag-
niﬁcent and expanding plant, a superior faculty and a ﬁne
big student body.

 

2. Materials speciﬁcations and construction quality-
control. Needed are more scientiﬁc methods of writing
speciﬁcations, particularly acceptance and rejection
criteria. Additionally, faster methods for quality—con-
trol tests at construction sites are needed.
3. Drainage of pavement structures. More should be
known about the need for sub-surface drainage of
Asphalt pavement structures. Limited information
indicates that untreated granular bases often accumu-
late moisture rather than facilitate drainage. Also, in-
dications are that Full-Depth Asphalt bases resting
directly on impermeable subgrades may not require
sub-surface drainage.
4. Compaction and thickness measurements of pave-
ments. The recent use of much thicker lifts in Asphalt
pavement construction suggests the need for new
studies to develop and refine rapid techniques for
measuring compaction and layer thickness.
5. Conservation and beneﬁciation of aggregates. More
study is needed on beneﬁciation of lower—quality base-
course aggregates by mixing them with Asphalt.

tion and technology, send in the coupon.

High returned home and his father asked him how his
school had done. He said, “We won the shot put, but
Washington won the meet. Thty had a total of 22 points.
We ﬁnished with nine and so did Roosevelt. The events
were scored by a certain number of percentage points for the
winner of each event, a smaller number for second and a
still smaller number for third. (Must be a positive integer
number of points.) The number of events was unknown.
There was a high jump but the student didn't know who
won it. His father told him who had won the high jump.

Two screwballs at a vacant resort rented a boat and found

IBM invites you to join an infant industry. 

Big as it is, the information processing
industry is just beginning to grow.

Recently, Fortune estimated that the
value of general purpose computers
installed in this country will more
than double by 1972.

Other publications have other
predictions, but most agree that infor-
mation processing is one of America’s
fastest growing major industries.

To somebody just starting out, this
growth means exceptionally good
chances for advancement. Last year,
for example, we appointed over 4,000
managers—on performance, not
seniority. Here are three ways you
could grow with IBM:

Engineering and Science

“The interdisciplinary

    
  
  
  
 
 
 

environment keeps . _
you technologically I "
hot.”

“Working in data
processing today

pretty much means
you work in a broad
spectrum of technologies,”
says Nick Donofrio. ’

An Associate Engineer 7;
at IBM, Nick is a 1967 ‘
graduate in Electrical
Engineering. He’s using his technical
background to design circuits for
computer memory systems.

Nick says, “Your specialty at IBM can
take you into the front yard of half a
dozen different fields. In my job, for
example, I work with systems design
engineers, chemists, physicists,
metallurgists, and programmers.”

Career areas in engineering and
science at IBM include: Research,
Design & Development, Manufactur-
ing, Product Test, Space and Defense
Projects, and Field Engineering.
You’ll need at least a B.S. in any
technical field.

“Working with

Marketing

 
  
 
  

company president
is part of the job.”

“I’m pretty muc ..  _
the IBM Corporation
in the eyes of my custom-

ers,” says Andy Moran. ‘‘I consider

‘  that fairly good for an engineer who

graduated only two years ago.”

Andy earned his B.S.E.E. in 1966.
Today, he’s a Marketing Representa-
tive with IBM, involved in the planning,
selling and installation of data
processing systems.

Andy’s customers include companies
with annual sales ranging from 20
million to 120 million dollars. He often
works with executive vice-presidents
and presidents.

Career areas in marketing at IBM

include: Data Processing Marketing
and Systems Engineering, Office
Products Sales, and Information
Records Sales. Degree requirement:
at least a B.S. or B.A. in any field.

“It’s a mixture

  
 
 
  
  

Programming

of science
and art.” 

“A computer is 
practically useless ‘f

until somebody writes

a program for it,” says Earl Wilson.

Earl got a B.A. in Modern Languages
in June, 1967. He’s now an IBM pro-
grammer working on a new
teleprocessing system linking IBM
divisions.

Earl defines a “program” as a set of
instructions that enables a computer
to do a specific job. “Programming
involves science,” says Earl,
“because you have to analyze
problems logically and objectively.
But then you have an infinite variety
of ways to write your program.”

Career areas in programming at IBM
include: Systems Programming,
Applications Programming, Pro-
gramming Research, and Internal
Programming for |BM’s own use.
You’ll need at least a B.S. or B.A.

Other reasons to consider IBM

1. Small Teams. No matter how large
the project, we divide it into units
small enoughfor one person or a few
people. Result: quick recognition

for achievement.

2. Educational Support. IBM
employees spend ‘over thirteen million

hours a year in company-sponsored
educational and training programs.
And plans like our Tuition Refund

Program could help you get your
Master’s or Ph.D.

3. 300 Locations. We have almost 50
plant, laboratory, or headquarters
locations and over 250 branch offices
in key cities throughout the

United States.

 Q: arm  

Bob Nerad seeks recognition

But not just for himself.

Bob was Chairman of a special Jaycee project to se-
lect the “Outstanding Young Educator” in Schenectady,
New York.

He began by rediscovering ﬁrsthand some of the vi-
brant situations that confront young teachers. With that
background he was ready to coordinate the nominating
and judging.

Planning and coordinating come naturally to Bob.
As a Production Control Specialist with General Elec-
tric’s Medium AC Motor and Generator Department,
he keeps production lines running smoothly. Coordinat-
ing machinery, raw materials and labor is crucial to any
efﬁciently run business.

With a mechanical engineering degree from Cornell,
in 1962, and an MBA in personnel administration from
George Washington, in 1963, Bob sought to plunge

directly into meaningful work. He’d had enough theory
and simulations to last him for awhile.

At General Electric he found people that agreed with
his thinking, and what’s more, GE offered him imme-
diate responsibility via the Manufacturing Management
Program.

Like Bob Nerad, you can get a fast start at General
Electric, in R&D, design, production or technical mar-
keting. Talk to our man when he Visits your campus. Or

pany, Room 801B, 570 Lexington Avenue, New York,

A Comment On The Engineers Ball

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

In past years the Engineering Ball has been the climax
of a hectic but enjoyable week for Pitt Engineers. This year
it would have to be called an anticlimax as it was in many
aspects the poorest Engineers’ Week affair I have ever
attended.

Not to personally criticize any one individual, as I’m
sure the Hilton Hotel is partly to blame, two outstanding
mistakes were made in the planning and execution of this
affair.

First of all, and I’m sure most disturbing to those at—
tending, there were only two bars with one bartender for
each, in the ballroom accommodating 800 — 1000 people. Bar
lines contained a hundred or more people and it took faculty
as well as students up to an hour to get served. Associated
with the refreshment aspect of the Ball, was the lack of
potato chips and pretzel snacks, which I was assured were
to be at each table..

The most outstanding error, an error which showed ex-
tremely poor taste, was the ridiculous and ignorant manner
in which the Queen was crowned. In past years, all the
queens and their escorts were introduced first, then the
crowning procedure with the two runners ‘up being an-
nounced, then St. Patricia was crowned by the Chancellor
on stage with much pomp and ceremony. This was very
ﬂattering to the queen and made the work she put into the
contest well worthwhile. At this Shamrock Ball, only the
three finalists were announced, over a bad public adddess
system I might add, and then Chancellor Posvar crowned
St. Patricia on an unlit stage with an old green felt hat.
Thert was no ceremony or music and the crowning was
over and the queen off of the stage before anyone had a
chance to see her or applaud. I was standing next to the
Chancellor when this happened and he seemed embarrassed
about the whole affair. Miss Langsdale, the queen, appeared
rather disappointed, for which she cannot be blamed. This
is no manner in which to treat a person who donated her
time to make Engineers’ Week more enjoyable for us.

As I said, this year’s Shamrock Ball was an anticlimax
compared to others, but this does not mean future ones
should be or will be the same. I feel, after talking with
several people associated with the affair, that steps will be
taken to better organize it and provide for better services
and accommodations. ——R.A.I-I.

 B Buta lot of engineers
     still don't get

Like, we'll ask a graduating engineer:

”What opportunities do you think an engineer has
if he works for the telephone company?”

And, zap—we get a blackout!

Well, we think the company responsible for
engineering innovations such as the transistor, radio
astronomy, high fidelity and stereo recording,
magnetic tape, synthetic crystals, negative feedback,
sound motion pictures, microwave relay, electronic
switching, the solar battery and telstar deserves a
consideration that's strong and clear.

When the Bell System recruiting team comes
