    Portable gas turbine
generators, mounted on barges
and trucks, are being plugged
into existing power networks to
boost capacity. And nickel's
helping make it happen.


    One tool that more power companies are
using in both their short- and long-range efforts
to close the generating gap is a down-to-earth
cousin of the jet aircraft engine, the gas turbine.
    A typical turbine, hitched to a generator, can
produce enough power to light a city of 25,000
people. (Above, eight turbines are ganged on one -
barge. Combined output: 156,000 kilowatts!)
    The beauty of the turbine is that it can be
bought and set up almost anywhere in a matter of
weeks. And it can be turned on and off in mere %
seconds. Which makes it ideal for those muggy
summer evenings when everybody gets home and "
hits the air-conditioner button at once.
    Gas turbines have proved such a boon to utili-
ties that sales of them are soaring. Last year, they
actually accounted for more than one fifth of
power companies' total new generating capacity.

    At the volcanic heart of the turbines, where
, temperatures reach 1,800 degrees, only specially
designed superalloys can be used. Almost all of
- these alloys contain a high proportion of nickel-
up to 78 percent. Nickel is vital for the properties
required for dependable turbine service. It helps
to provide alloy stability and corrosion resistance.
    Just as our metal is a helper, so International
Nickel is a helper.
    We assist dozens of different industries all
over the world in the use of metals. We offer tech-
nical information. And the benefit of our ex-
perience. Often, Inco metallurgists are able to
anticipate alloys that will be needed in the future,
and to set about creating them.
    This kind of helpfulness, we figure, will en-
courage our customers to keep coming back to us.
    And that helps all around.

           Smoothing the way for perfect thin film bonding.


     Aluminum oxide, or alumina, is con-
sidered to have the best combination of
properties for thin film circuit substrates.
Until recently, however, the bonding of
metal elements to gold-coated tantalum
nitride resistor film on alumina was some-
what unpredictable.
     Now, an advance at Western Electric
has made it possible to get practically
fault-free bonding of these materials.
    This new perfection in bonding
came through the development of finer
grained alumina substrates.
    The process has four basic steps:
milling, casting, punching and firing.
     During milling, alumina is combined
with magnesium oxide, trichlorethylene,
ethanol and a unique deflocculant. For
24 hours, this mixture is rotated in a ball
mill. In a second 24-hour period, plasti-
cizers and a binder are included.
    The deflocculant plays a major role
by dissipating the attraction forces that
exist between the highly active alumina
particles. This prevents thickening, which
would ordinarily make an active alumina
mixture unworkable.
    The 48 hours of milling is followed
by casting. When the material comes off
the casting line, it is in the form of a flexi-
ble polymer/alumina tape, dry enough
to be cut into easily handled sections.
     After casting, a punch press cuts the
material into the desired rectangles or


other shapes. Holes can be punched at
the same time.
     Finally, because of the use of active
alumina, the material is fired at an unusu-
ally low temperature which results in
smooth substrate surfaces for reliable
thin film bonding. The finished substrate
is then ready for the various processes of
thin film circuit production.
     In developing this new process, en-
gineers at Western Electric's Engineering
Research Center worked together with
engineers at the Allentown plant.
     Conclusion: This new way to pro-
duce substrates is a truly significant con-
tribution for thin film circuit production.
    The ultimate gain from this smoother
substrate is for communications itself.
For through the achievement of nearly
perfect bonding of metal leads to tanta-
lum nitride, thin films can be produced
with even greater reliability and economy.

our older people. We should strive to continually
improve and reexamine such programs until finally
no aged person in America regardless of financial
status will ever again be deprived of medical atten-
tion.
     However, there is much waiting to be done.
Because today more people are living to be old and
the elderly comprise a larger percentage of our
population, a concerted attack on geriatric health
problems would surely be of benefit. Since harden-
ing of the arteries to the brain is considered to be the
main cause of senility or mental deterioration of the
elderly research into its prevention and treatment
would herald the dawn of a new era with less
segregation of our old people because of their
mental deficiencies and hence a greater acceptance
of them by all other age groups.
  Greater emphasis should be placed upon the con-
struction of geriatric-diagnostic-treatment and
restorative centers. Many  exist individual or
congregational, social & work centers, nursing and
hospital service, and household help if required. For
although the friendship of youth is much to be
desired by our aged folks, there is a fuller freedom
with contemporaries, sharing similar pasts and
mutually limited futures.
  In planning any such housing or health facilities
for the aged, however, we should remember to



20


respect their personalities while grouping their
infirmities. Choice is a precious perogative, and
private rooms in     old   age homes allow   for
individuality  and  the   retention  of cherished
possessions. To make them away would diminish the
person's speaking, and    infringe  upon  his
individuality.
     Frequent inspections of all such institutions is
essential to maintain high standards of care &
cleanliness.
     There are many ways to help our aged citizens.
There is no one so naive as to point to only one
possibility which would solve all their problems, for
these peoples are individuals. To the administrator
of a home for the aged, a woman may be just "that
old woman, Jones is her name" but to herself, she
is The Katie Jones, who won prizes for poetry and
had the smallest waist in her class, plus a hundred
other distinctive attributes - who just happens to be
old. In our provisions for the elderly it is esential that
we remember their self image, and that we act today.
Tomorrow, it may be you or I who are the OLD and
there should be that will-to-do which does not wait
for tomorrow's wisdom but strives today to apply
today's knowledge. Now is the time to strive to truly
make our elders less alienated and happier members
of socieety, to make them comfortable, and not just
make ourselves comfortable about them.

rat trap


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-APRIL, 1972













INTRODUCTION


   This paper was substantially a fine report on an
   ES1 final design project. The project members
   were Louis Smith, Joseph Thoma, and Veronica
   Konefal.




                   SUMMARY

     On May 26, 1971, the United States Department
of Agriculture proposed a development program for
Rat Control Device, hereafter referred to as an RCD.
This device will eliminate, or substantially retard, the
growth of a rat population in a grain storage ware-
house. The RCD was to be portable, yet simple and
safe in operation. It was to operate with maximum
control and a minimum of maintenance.
    The proposal was accepted by the Thoma-
Groupe Corporation and under the head of Mr. J.T.
Thoma, Director for Research and Development.
The work was commenced on May 29, 1971.
    The first stage of development was a literature
survey investigating the ecology of a rat. The survey
limited the research to certain species of rats, their
instincts, and reproduction habits. Further research
was done on the mechanics of rat traps, past and
present, for their possible application to this prob-
lem.
    The second phase included consideration of
numerous designs applicable to the project. Nine
feasible designs for an RCD were developed. All
were judged on the basis of their projected perfor-
mance in a grain storage on the basis of their
projected performance in a grain storage warehouse
environment.
    The last phase of the project involved the
deliberation of the advantageous features of Phase II
designs. These features were modified into a design
that would meet all of the proposal requirements.
    The final design was a box-type device which
induced a pregnant rat to nest in the interior of the
trap. As the rat grew in weight, the RCD activated an
electrical system that caused electrocution of all rats
within the confines of the nest. This device met the
requirements necessary for project completion.


     Current rat-trapping devices were inadequate in
dealing with the growing rat population in grain
storage warehouses. While these traps may have
exterminated the rodents individually, the female rat
of a pack reproduced twenty-four off-spring per
year.1 In the face of this number, common traps
clearly became less and less efficient. As a result, the
United States Department of Agriculture proposed
that a more efficient Rat Control Device be
developed to eliminate the growing rat population.
     The proposed Rat Control Device, hereafter
referred to as an RCD, was to be used in warehouses.
This immediately imposed certain requirements and
restrictions as guidelines in project development.
The requirements stipulated that the rats be killed
and disposed of in accordance with the Department
of Agriculture Sanitation Code governing sanitation
in grain storage warehouses. The limitations involv-
ing the RCD were that it be portable, simple and safe
in operation, and have a high degree of efficiency.
No chemical agent could be used in the device so
that possible food contamination could be pre-
vented. This also was in compliance with existing
Sanitation Laws. A summation of the stated restric-
tions led to the main objectives of the RCD project.
                  OBJECTIVES
    The RCD proposal described a development
program that would sanitarily eradicate rats from the
United States Government Grain Storage Ware-
houses. The primary objectives included simple and
safe operation, portability, and rodent disposal. A
secondary objective was to devise an RCD that
would eliminate with a minimum of maintenance a
large rat population.
                 PROCEDURES
Method of Approach
    The method of approach to the RCD consisted
of three main phases. Phase I was research, Phase II
a selection of feasible designs, and Phase III the final
selection and modification of a Phase II solution.
Phase I-Literature Survey
    The first phase of the RCD involved research as
to the ecology of the rat. The research was
immediately limited to the investigation of Rattus
norvegicus, the brown rat, and Rattus rattus, the
black rat.2 Field investigation has shown that the
majority of all rats trapped are of these two types.
These species of rat are common throughout the


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-APRIL, 1972



United States, and no other major specie of rat are
concentrated in the Western World.3 Therefore,
the characteristics and reproduction habits of these
rat spedies were pursued for possible exploitation by
the RCD.
    The main characteristics of the rat affecting a
feasible RCD were its' inborn instincts of fear and
caution.4 The common rat had a condition called
automatic neophobia, a fear of anything new or
different.5 This made it difficult to utilize a bait-
type lure in the RCD. It has also been shown rats
could have a fatal heart attack (Vagal Syncope)
when severely frightened.6 As was suspected, and
vertified by research, rats are extremely intelligent,
and relate quickly to changes in environment
through texture of surface, odors, and slope of
surface. These facts lead to the rats' nesting habits.
    The most productive area of research, however,
was the rats' reproductive traits. The rats' nesting
habits are consistent, in that, they cannot burrow,
but will nest anywhere including trees.7 However,
most rats favor a secluded, closed-in area which con-
tains rags, paper, or a fluffy-like material such as
cotton.8 This complusion of the rat was an impor-
tant factor in the final development of a RCD.
    Past and present devices for trapping this rodent
in its natural state were evaluated for their general
applications. Generally, the devices fell into two
broad categories: chemical and mechanical.
Chemicals now employed by commercial ware-
houses are of the anti-coagulant type.9 However,
the government stipulated that chemical agents of
this type were not to be used for this development
program. The mechanical devices consisted pri-
marily of springg-actuated mechanisms, which are
easily tripped, and just as easily avoided by the
rat.10 These inquiries into traps, past and present,
led the investigators to believe that a combination of
confirmed facts and modern viewpoints would pro-
duce the most satisfactory results in the projected
RCD.
Phase II-Applicable Designs
   Certain guidelines of project development men-
tioned in the introduction of this report included:
sanitary disposal, simple and  safe  operation,
portability, and high efficiency. With these factors in
mind, all project members submitted rough sketches
for solutions to the RCD problem. A specific
explanation of the Rodent Control Device now
follows to itinerate this project's development.
RCD Development Program
    Project members met on June 9, 1971, to begin
work on an RCD final design. Feeling that a brain-
storming session was necessary, the group initiated
many ideas such as channeling devices, electrical de-
vices, and mechanical devices. With the notes
gathered from this session, all members retired to
compile what they felt were their best solutions. The
members submitted nine solutions for consideration,


but only four solutions appeared applicable to the
problem. These four solutions and their overall
effect on the project are now described in detail.
Electro-Dole Climbing Device
    The first device considered aplicable to the
project was an electro-pole climbing device. This de-
vice consisted of a base, three poles attached to the
base which were wired to conduct 440-volts of elec-
tricity, and a wire extension cord for plugging the
device into a wall outlet. The base provided support
for the three poles were of a sufficient length, such
that, the rat was unable to jump their height.11
With these parts assembled, the device was ready for
operation.
    The simplistic operation of the electro-pole de-
vice was its main feature. A bait-type lure was placed
at the top of the pole, and the device was then
connected to the nearest electrical outlet. A rat,
lured by the smell of the bait, then attempted to re-
trieve it by jumping. After this failure, he then
attempts climbing the pole. When halfway up the
poles, he reached the uninsulated part of the pole
and was electrocuted. He ten falls to the base, and
the device is then ready for its next victim.
    This device had certain undesirable features
which necessitated rejection. The disadvantages
include a possible loss of bait, and hazardous opera-
tion. The presence of a dead rat also rendered the
trap useless until the carcass was removed.12 The
features favoring this device include portability,

   simple and efficient operation, and swiftness of kill.
   The two features of swiftness and efficiency were re-
   corded for future design use.
   Chamber Device
       The second design the project members con-
   sidered was a chamber-type device. It consisted of a
   box which a rat sealed upon entering, subsequently
   asphixiating himself.
       Several objectives were immediately apparent.
   A means would have to be found to induce a rat to
   enter, and trip the trapping mechanism. Once
   trapped, alithal gas must be injected into the cham-
   ber and a means must be provided to reset the trap.
This must be all done in accordance with the Sanita-
  tion Code.
  Hoop Trap Device
       A third device was the hoop trap. This was a
  portable trap consisting of a circular, solid base with
  a spring-loaded, wire basket suspended over it.
       The operation of the hoop trap was very similar
  to the electro-pole device, in that a lure was placed
  at a height where the rat must jump to retrieve it. On
  striking the bait, a trigger device drops the basket
  over the rat, trapping him. The outstanding features
  favoring this device included portability, simple and
  safe operation, and easy installation. The features
  against this type of device were possible loss of bait,
  does not kill, and limited efficiency.

  Channel Device
       At this stage of development, it became
   apparent that purely mechanical-type devices were
   subject to severe limitations due to the rat's quick
   reflexes.13 It was decided that the use of electricity
   should be developed to a greater extent.
       Subsequently, the last design considered in this
  project was a channel device. It consisted of a
  1directed-approach to the bait, a photo-electric
   tripping mechanism, and four exposed, uninsulated
  electrodes attached to a high-voltage power supply.
       The operation of this device involved biopsi
  , procedures, in addition to sophisticated electroonic
  devices. The bait was placed in a location where the


rodent could easily approach it. Pursuing the bait's
odor, the rat was channeled along a fixed path
through the photo-electric system. Four exposed
electrodes were imbedded in the wall of the
approach after this area. Passing through this system
energized the high-voltage power supply. This
caused a electrical arcing between the electrodes,
effectively electrocuting the rat. A silent alarm was
then tripped signaling an attendent to remove the rat
and reset the apparatus.
    This design had favorable features, such as
simple, efficient operation, a sure-kill capability, and
sanitary construction. Several undersirable features
became immediately apparent. The use of such high-
voltage would have been hazardous to the attendent,
and it was felt that the odor of an electrocuted rat
would have kept potential victims away.14
    A   review  of all designs considered, then
revealed a common shortcoming. This was the bait
factor. Due to the abundance of food easily available
to the rat in a food warehouse, a bait-type lure did
not seem a reasonable lure for an effective RCD. A
trait or instinct common to all rats should be
exploited for use as the RCD lure. All applicable
facts being considered, the project was then ready to
proceed into its final phase.
Phase III-Final RCD Design
    The Rat Control Device selected for further
development was the channel device; the rat instinct
chosen to be exploited was the rats nesting habits. It
was decided that the RCD should channel the rat
into a seemingly secure area where a female rat
would nest. At a certain stage in the rat's gestation
period, electrocution would occur until all rodents
within the confines of the device were dead. A snap-
top lid would be placed over the RCD for easy
removal of the dead bodies. This RCD included the
primary project objectives of portability and simple
yet safe operation. It was felt that we had developed
a disposal system which would allow for maximum
control over a rat population with a minimum of
maintenance.
RCD Description
     The RCD shape can be altered to suit its
demands, but basically, the RCD   was a box
approximately 30" x 18" x 10" in size. There
are four walls comprising the box with an opening
four inches square near the top on one wall for
access into the trap. The exterior of the box was
covered with a fabric material impregnated with
odors of soot and warehouse dirt. The interior walls
were to be a burlap material similar to that used in
the warehouse. The floor was to be covered with
strips of a soft cotton, interwoven with a one-fourth
inch thick layer of steel wool, on top of a non-
flammable material, such as Olin roofing insulation.
The strips were separated by approximately one-

             Research

     opportunities in

highway engineering


         The Asphalt Institute
suggests projects in five vital areas

Phenomenal advances in roadbuilding techniques dur-
ing the past decade have made it clear that continued
highway research is essential.
     Here are five important areas of highway design
and construction that America's roadbuilders need to
know more about:
1. Rational pavement thickness design and materials
evaluation. Research is needed in areas of Asphalt
rheology, behavior mechanisms of individual and com-
bined layers of pavement structure, stage construc-
tion and pavement strengthening by Asphalt overlays.
     Traffic evaluation, essential for thickness design,
 requires improved procedures for predicting future
 amounts and loads.
     Evaluation of climatic effects on the performance
 of the pavement structure also is an important area
 for research.

        College Park, Maryland 20740


2. Materials specifications and construction quality-
control. Needed are more scientific methods of writing
specifications, particularly acceptance and rejection
criteria. Additionally, faster methods for quality-con-
trol tests at construction sites are needed.
3. Drainage of pavement structures. More should be
known about the need for sub-surface drainage of
Asphalt pavement structures. Limited information
indicates that untreated granular bases often accumu-
late moisture rather than facilitate drainage. Also, in-
dications are that Full-Depth Asphalt bases resting
directly on impermeable subgrades may not require
sub-surface drainage.
4. Compaction and thickness measurements of pave-
ments. The recent use of much thicker lifts in Asphalt
pavement construction suggests the need for new
studies to develop and refine rapid techniques for
measuring compaction and layer thickness.
5. Conservation and beneficiation of aggregates. More
study is needed on beneficiation of lower-quality base-
course aggregates by mixing them with Asphalt.

tion and technology, send in the coupon.

     Dr. Brody presented a lecture in the Air Force
 Materials Laboratory Distinguished Scientist Series
 on the subject of the application of solidification
 theory to the directional solidification of alloys. The
 lecture was presented on January 5, 1972, at Wright

shirt that he wears with his uniform. Jeffery put on
the clean shirt and a tie, and then an overcoat. He
put some toilet paper down in his cheeks to look
jowly, and dumped some talcum powder in his hair.
He was going to impersonate the Dean, but he
looked so great he could've passed for a provost or a
chancellor, even.
    So we got back to Benedum just in time, be-
cause they started to swing that big marble and they
meant business. Jeffery put them on good and they
thought he was somebody important and they
apologized and headed for the real State Hall.
    Well, it took them only about half an hour to get
down there with their crane and all, and Jeffery and I
sat on the hill to watch. They got that big ball


swinging again, and when they let it loose it tore
through the building like a hot knife through butter.
You remember what State Hall was like: for the last
eight years the termites had to bring their own wood.
     So while bricks and dust and junk were still fly-
ing all over the place, and they were getting ready to
swing the ball again, half the windows on the first
floor flew open and all these guys in suits and ties
started bailing out. Here the VIPS that showed up
for the convention read that stupid pamphlet map
and were waiting in there for something to happen.
    That's when things started jumping. The hard-
hats nabbed us because they thought we sent them to
the wrong building, and the convention guys started
fighting with the hardhats cause they almost killed
them, and me and Jeffery ended up in front of the
Dean, courtesy of the campus police.
    Well, I really thought we'd get chewed out good
but we didn't. The Dean just asked a few questions
and the whole time Jeffery kept pulling hairs out of
his eyebrows. It was driving me crazy but I didn't
say anything because I didn't want the Dean to think
we were weird or something.
    So anyway you people should be thankful to me
that you have classes in Benedum Hall and not in the
Cathedral where there's girls, and if you're ever here
at Johnstown stop in and see me.
    Oh, yeah, Jeffery quit school last term and got a
job with the city - Port Authority Transit, I think.

RCD Operation
    The operation of the RCD     involved the
exploitation of a rat"s instinct. A rat, looking for a
nest, discovered the RCD which is placed near an
established rat run path. An investigation of the
interior leads its instincts to conclude that this area
was a potential nest, and it was then lured inside for

shelter. Afterwards, other rats may have followed it
to this place. The prescence of the additional rats,
may prematurely activate the floor system, thereby
killing the occupants. Our research indicated that
this could be a likely event, and one to be
considered. Inevitably, a pair of the rats will mate
and establish a nest, thereby initiating operation of
the floor system.
    Successful operation of the RCD will depend on
a series of experiments done by the individual ware-
house user. A means must be found to determine
how acceptable, and for what purpose is a "dummy"
RCD to the average rat colony. Should it indeed be
used as a gathering place, one can estimate the
correct spring setting for maximumm effectively. It
has been suggested by field workers that the floor
system be modified into a photographic, trigger-
release system. At a certain stage in RCD use, the
mechanism will activate in infra-red camera. The
user will then have a photographic record of rat
acceptance techniques peculiar to his location.
Project Considerations
     In the development of the RCD, certain facts
became obvious to the project members. These find-
ings pertained to general problems and limitations
imposed upon a rat control device. Note will now be
made of them for possible future work in this field.
The findings were divided into four major cate-
gories: bait lure, mechanics, rat instincts, and field
testing.

                                                            FIELD TESTING. Field testing is the only
                                                       means of conclusively determining the merits of a rat
                                                -      control device. Laboratory conditions are too con-
                                                       trolled and often for this very reason field data does
                                                       not correlate with research findings. A field test sub-
              Ale                                      jects the rodent device to its working environment
                                                       where all favorable conditions will be at a minimum.
                                                       Final Recommendation
                                                           Electrical or electro-mechanical devices are the
                                                       only feasible solutions at present. Mechanical
                      ..  ,  ,,                        devices have too many limiting factors which cannot
         .  ..    .be alleviated except by the use of electricity. Electro-
                                                       mechanical devices operate faster, more efficiently,
                                                       and for a longer time.

 (Cont. "Rat Trap")
     BAIT LURE. During the literature survey, all
 trap lures were in the form of a bait. Foods, and even
 water were continually suggested for luring rodents
 to the trap. Yet every author and article seemed to
 have their own opinion as to what specific bait to
 use. These contradictions, coupled with the rat's
 automatic neophobia complex, indicated   that
 another approach to the development of an RCD
 seemed necessary.18
     MECHANICS. Research on rat traps past and
present, showed  a severe limitation  of the
mechanical devices now in use. This limitation was
the trap's inability to cope with more than one rat at
a time. This was in part due to the bait lure findings.
However, the main limitation is that these traps seem
to have a size prerequisite that is dependent on
rodent size. This allowed for a high degree of
portability, but definitely restricted the number of
possible parts in any mechanical system.
    INSTINCTS. The instincts of a rat were among
the most consistent elements found in the re-
search.19 They have been the primary factor in sav-
ing the rat from complete extinction by man.20
Their consistency lies in their inborn cunning and
nesting habits. Though general likes and dislikes vary
from rat to rat, all rats have an inborn sense of
specific nesting habits. This is one constant among
many variables.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-APRIL, 1972


























     Not a sound, right?
     You won't get a peep out of any
 other stereo ads in this magazine,
 either. Just the same pretty pictures
 and technical facts.
    That's why there's only one way
to buy stereo. Go listen to it. If it's really good,
your ear will tell you.
    We say this because we're confident
you'll be impressed when you- hear
a Sylvania stereo. Our stereos sound
as good as they look.
    Take the matched component
system, MS210W, over on the right.
That turntable is automatic, with cueing
and anti-skate controls. It's precisely matched
to a Sylvania solid state FM Stereo/ FM/AM
receiver.
    Inside, where you can't see it, is a solid state
amplifier that delivers 50 watts of peak music
power to that pair of air suspension speakers.
Which sound as good as standard speakers two
sizes larger. Especially when they hit those
important low bass notes. And since they put
out wide-angle sound, you can sit almost any-
where in the room and get the full stereo effect.
    But don't believe a word you read. Hearing
is believing. Go listen to a Sylvania stereo
before you buy.
    Then, when you hear our price, you'll believe.

These charts are based on information from two
extensive engineering evaluations conducted by
U.S. Testing Co., for the International Lead Zinc
Research Organization Inc. These studies showed
that in almost every instance die cast zinc gives
you more performance for your money than any
of the plastics tested. O For example, the results

showed that an unreinforced Polycarbonate rod
would cost 3.82 times more than a SAE 903 rod to
withstand the same tensile load. Glass reinforced
Polycarbonate would cost 3.36 times more than
zinc. O Reprints of this "Engineers Guide" are

how i saved benedum hall


    I doubt very much if any of you know anything
about this . . . I mean, about Benedum Hall almost
being torn down and everything. You see, there was
this big mix-up and, well, let me tell you about it.
    It all started on a Thursday in November a year
ago, when me and Jeffrey Cabelle were riding a bus
down Perrysville Avenue heading into town. Jeffery
is a real gasser. In high school he used to gulp air
until his stomach was full and he'd rift real loud in the
cafeteria. Everyone clapped and whistled and
thought it was funny until one time when he did it
Susan Shoemaker got sick and puked all over her
pork pinwheel and he got paddled. Well, that's the
kind of kid he was: he either made you laugh or
puke.

    The reason we were going into town was to pick
up these pamphlets at the printers. There was
supposed to be some kind of engineer's convention
the following day, and the Dean asked me and
Jeffery to make up a folder to be printed and passed
around. Most of it was hogwash about the school of
engineering and how old it was and how famous it
was, blah, blah, and all we had to do was draw a map
of O'Hara Street showing where Benedum Hall was.
Well, Jeffery labeled Benedum Hall as State Hall and
vice versa, you know, for a joke, and didn't tell me
about it until after we dropped it off at the printers.

     So now we were going to pick up fifteen
hundred pamphlets that had Benedum Hall switched


SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-APRIL, 1972

with State Hall. Jeffery kept saying don't worry, no
one would know the difference even if he walked in
the wrong building, but I knew that there would be
some important people there, you know, friends of
the Dean and all, and anyway I didn't feel like getting
transferred to the Johnstown campus.
     The bus we were on stopped in front of the
printers and as we were getting off Jeffery grabbed
the driver's hat and threw it in the street. I don't
know why I loaf with that kid, he's got no goddamn
manners. It was kinda funny, though.
    But the pamphlets weren't there; the printer
sent them to the school the day before.
    So we went to face the music, but here, no one
noticed the mistake; not the Dean, or any of the
faculty, or anyone. Even the engineering cabinet
officers missed it. Well, to tell the truth, I guess that
didn't really surprise me that much; with all of the
overlooking everyone does at Pitt, no one would
ever miss a building or two.
    So we forgot all about the pamphlet and headed
for home. I was going to cut classes the next day,
Friday, but Jeffery reminded me that they were going
to start tearing down State Hall so I figured I'd go
after all - maybe even learn something.
    The next day when I got to school there was this
big wrecking crane parked in front of Benedum Hall.
                                   9-7


It had one of those big iron balls, you know, about as
big as an elephant and as heavy as your sister's purse.
They had the engine all revved up and ready to go,
and I asked one of the hardhats what they were
doing and he said, why tearing down old State Hall,
of course, and he pointed at Benedum. Well, I al-
most died trying not to laugh, and I couldn't wait to
see them get started, when I saw something that al-
most choked me.
     He was holding one of those damn pamphlets
 with the map that Jeffery goofed up, and then I
 guessed what happened: someone sent them a map
 showing them where State Hall was, and our map
 must have been handy at the time.
    Well, Jeffery and me couldn't have come up
with fifteen dollars in as many weeks, let alone fif-
teen million for a new engineering building, and I
knew if they started playing tenpins with Benedum
Hall it would be Mexico for me.
    So I ran and got Jeffery and we came up with an
idea. His roomate's in ROTC, see, so between the
two of them they have one clean shirt: his roomates'
