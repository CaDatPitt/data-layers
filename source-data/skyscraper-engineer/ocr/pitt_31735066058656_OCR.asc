Dean G. R. Fitterer has been the
Dean of the School of Engineering
and Mines since September 1, 1951.
Previous to this appointment, he had
been a professor and dean of the de-
partment of Metallurgical Engineer-
ing since 1939.

He graduated from the Rose Poly-
technical Institute in 1924 and during
the next 21/2 years worked as a metal-
lurgist for the American Chain Com-
pany in Terra Haute, Indiana and
the Stanley Works in New Britain,
Connecticut.

Dean Fitterer received his Master
of Science degree in Metallurgy from
the Carnegie Institute of Technology
in 1937. During this time, he was a
fellowship student with the metal-
lurgical advisory board of the physical
chemistry and steel making program
at the U. S. Bureau of Mines. He re-
mained in this program until 1931
when he became head of the metal-
lurgy department at the Pittsburgh
station of the Bureau. Dean Fitterer
continued his studies during this time
and received a Doctor of Philosophy
degree from the University of Pitts-
burgh.

In 1934 he left the Bureau to organ-
ize the Fitterer Pyrometric Company
and in 1935 he became a metallurgy
lecturer at the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Dean Fitterer’s work in research is
well known in the steel industry. He
developed an electrolytic method for
determining the amounts and types of
impurities in steel and did the dis-
covery work of the manganese-silicon
steels now in general use. The Dean
also developed an instrument for de-
termining the actual temperature of
liquid metals by direct immersion

As the head of the metallurgical de-
partment during World War II, he
faced a heavy teaching and research
demand. Twenty-two hundred steel
inspectors were trained by his depart-
ment and research was carried on for
several companies, research associa-
tions, and the Navy.

THE DEAN REPORTS»

For his work, Dean Fitterer was
cited for achievement by the Navy
and was selected as awardee and
Campbell lecturer by the American
Society for Metals in 1944.

More recently his work as Dean of
the Engineering and Mine School has
included fund raising and the plan-
ning and erecting of new facilities.
When Dean Fitterer ﬁrst began his
job as Dean in 1951, he was allowed
to go before the Board of Trustees of
the University to present his ideas on
the needs of Engineering Education
at Pitt. The result of the work was
the completion and occupation of our

1.5 million dollar Engineering Hall
in August of 1955.

The next major program was the
fund raising of $614,000 to renovate
the Mineral Industries Building and
Pennsylvania Hall to provide more
room for the growing engineering
body. The campaign was very success-
ful in that four times as many alumni
gave three times as much as ever
before.

Dean Fitterer has given the Schools
of Engineering and Mines a new goal
and is providing the means to achieve
it. This goal is to become the finest
engineering school in the country.

of the Engineering programs at Pitt. A complete review
would fill a book so that many items of interest will be

necessarily missing from this report. However, inquiries
will be welcome and prompt answers provided.

HISTORY—Engineering education at the University of
Pittsburgh has played a vital role in the growth and de-
velopment of one of this country's greatest industrial
regions. And, today, more than ever, demands are being
made upon it as a major integral part of the leading edu-
cational institution of this region which is undergoing a
physical, social, and cultural renaissance.

The University’s Schools of Engineering and Mines
strove alone in this area to meet the need for professional
competence through much of the period when the region
was acquiring its character of one of the world’s greatest
industrial concentrations.

The University has been granting baccalaureate de-
degrees in engineering continuously since 1846, making
it the ﬁrst or second engineering college west of the Alle-
ghenies and, indeed, one of the earliest anywhere. At
that time, Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth were still sev-
eral years away from graduating engineers and Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology was not to be founded
for another two decades. W'ithin this region, the Uni-
versity’s program was the only one until Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology began granting engineering de-
grees some sixty-ﬁve years later.

In those early days many of the science departments
were integral parts of the Schools of Engineering and
Mines and, by 1894, Pitt already had 45 engineers in its
graduating class and numbered among its faculty such
men as Dean Daniel Carhart, (applied mathematics);
Samuel P. Langley, (aerodynamics); Professors Reginald
A. Fessenden, (electronics); and Reid T. Stewart, (me-
chanics). In 1910, Dean F. L. Bishop introduced the Co-
operative System of Engineering Education, making this
University one of the ﬁrst two in the world to do so.
Graduate work in engineering began in a small way as
early as 1916, received major impetus from a cooperative
agreement with the M/estinghouse Electric Sc Manufac-
turing Company in 1926 and by 1930 enrolled 300 stu-
dents. The first Graduate Work in Industry program in
the country was started here in 1927, by Dean E. A.
Holbrook. Until given separate status in the late thirties,

OCTOBER 1961

the renowned Mellon Institute of Industrial Research
served essentially as the University’s engineering-science
experimentation station. Meanwhile, the variety of the
University’s engineering programs had increased in keep-
ing with the growing complexity of the region’s economy.

CURRENT ENROLLMENT———Today, the engineering
programs of the University are among the largest of the
privately endowed engineering colleges of the country,
and all of its eight departments are accredited by the
Engineers’ Council for Professional Development.
Undergraduate enrollment in the eight departments
has averaged in excess of 1700 over the past several years,
and engineering students constitute about one-fourth the
total undergraduate enrollment of the University. Dur-
ing the 1960-61 school year, 388 B.S., 62 M.S. and 16
Ph.D. degrees were granted. The 16 doctorates granted
were exceeded by only six other privately endowed en-
gineering schools and by eight state universities. The
continued growth of the engineering programs at the
University can best be illustrated from the following data:

Since 1910, the undergraduate degrees granted have
nearly doubled every ten years. The steady growth of the
graduate program is also striking because of the num-
ber of degrees granted per year now constitute more
than 15 per cent of those receiving the B.S. degree. In

addition, if the graduate programs continue to grow

proportionally as in the past, as many as 650 M.S. degrees
and 125 Ph.D. degreess can be anticipated during the
ten year period from 1960 to 1969. This will nearly be
equal to all the M.S. degrees granted to date and will be
more than one and one-half times the number of Ph.D.
degrees granted in the past forty years. Analysis of cur-
rent enrollment indicates that this may be a conservative
estimate.

All but a very few of the undergraduate engineering
students currently on campus were in the upper two-
ﬁfths of their high school classes. No student has been
admitted with entrance deﬁciencies in the last ten years.
As a private institution, the University can and does use
stringent selective standards. Of the 417 graduate stu-
dents enrolled last year, the 376 M.S. candidates came
from 108 schools and the 41 Ph.D. candidates were from
29 different institutions.

FACULTY—The faculty includes 79 full-time staff mem-
bers (23 full professors, 18 associate professors, 19 assist-
ant professors, and 19 instructors), in addition to 27
graduate student assistants and numerous adjunct pro-
fessors from the industries in the area who are distin-
guished persons serving as special lecturers.

”THE HILL," as it is known to Pitt engineers, includes all the en-
gineering buildings of the University of Pittsburgh.

Of the full-time staff, 29 per cent hold Ph.D. degrees
and 83 per cent have M.S. degrees. Seventy-ﬁve per cent
hold State engineering licenses. Five faculty members are
currently off campus on NSF or other grants to obtain
their doctorates, and others are engaged in part-time study
toward doctorates. Institutions represented by the gradu-
ate degrees held by the full-time faculty are Brown, Car-
negie, Columbia, Cornell, Gottingham (Germany), Har-
vard, Imperial College (London), Kansas State, Lehigh,
M.I.T., Michigan, Missouri, New York University, North-
western, Notre Dame, Purdue, and Rensselaer.

The Schools of Engineering and Mines are housed in
six buildings on the University's Oakland campus and
additional space, used especially for research, is rented.
Contracted research amounts to some $800,000 per year.
The physical facilities are recognized as inadequate even
for the present programs of the eight departments of
Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical, Metal-
lurgical, Mining, and Petroleum Engineering. An Aero-
nautical option is given in the Mechanical Engineering
Department.

THE ALUMNI—For more. than 100 years, graduates of
the University’s Schools of Engineering and Mines have
distinguished themselves in the ﬁelds of engineering,
research, education, and business management. And the
great industrial region centering on Pittsburgh, always
has looked to the University for a major portion of the
engineering talent and research leadership it needs.

A survey of the engineering alumni and the positions
they hold gives one a pleasant surprise because little or-
ganized publicity has ever been given its graduates. This
survey indicated that the engineering educational pro-
grams at this institution have succeeded to develop lead-
ers not only for industry but scientiﬁc research, education,
public and international service as well.

The Schools of Engineering and Mines can count
among their graduates at least four presidents of steel
companies, several directors of the largest research labora-
tories in the United States, as well as deans and depart-
ment heads in various engineering colleges in the country.

The Petroleum Engineering Department alone has
found that some twenty of its graduates were presidents
or vice presidents of oil companies.

A review of the alumni employed by the U.S. Steel
Corporation a few years ago revealed four vice presidents,
and more than 100 others in its top managerial or tech-
nical positions.

Considerable effort has been expended in the past two
years to locate the engineering alumni and to ﬁnd means
of recognizing them for their accomplishments. More will
be heard about this in the months to come.

ENGINEERING BUILDINGS—(1900-1938) —At the
turn of the century, Pitt was known internationally for
its engineering school and the bulk of the students at the
University were engineers. Carnegie Tech did not yet
exist. In fact, Andrew Carnegie was on the Pitt Board of
Trustees and was listed as a lecturer on the subject of
“How to Succeed in Business.” For many years the Ameri-
can Society for Engineering Education had its national
headquarters here.

Pitt was known in the early days as the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania and all of its buildings were
located on Pittsburgh’s North Side. However, the State of
Pennsylvania was highly interested in the School of Mines
and donated funds for the construction of State Hall to
house this school. This was the ﬁrst building on the Oak-
land campus and shortly thereafter the Thaw family
donated sufficient funds to build Thaw Hall for the
School of Engineering.

The engineers were not destined to occupy their build-
ings, however, because the administration and the other
divisions of the University moved into them upon their
completion. Instead, the Engineering divisions were
housed partially in Thaw Hall and in various temporary
buildings until 1938. At that time, the Cathedral of
Learning was sufficiently completed so that State Hall
was ﬁnally returned to the engineers.
1938-1956——During this period, the engineering divisions
were housed in State Hall, about one-half of Thaw Hall,
and two small buildings on top of the “Hill”.

OCTOBER 1961

In 1947, the Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
Departments suffered a great loss of their laboratories
when the Mines Building burned to the ground. More
than a half million dollars in equipment was lost, not to
mention research data, graduate thesis material, etc. Be-
cause of this, and the ever increasing engineering enroll-
ment which is evident in the previous table, the remaining
engineering laboratory space was highly inadequate, to
say the least. Then, in 1951, permission was given the
engineers to plan a new building. One million dollars was
allocated from previous unrestricted gifts, and the Buhl
Foundation gave $500,000 as a matching fund for a Buhl-
Langley Wing on the east side of the new building. A
fund-raising drive was started and in September 1955,
Engineering Hall was completed and occupied. Through
the matching funds some $384,000 in new equipment was
installed and the space problem was alleviated somewhat.
During this same period, it was through the generosity of
Dr. George M. Bevier (Min. '13) that engineering ob-
tained its ﬁrst library facilities. Also, through proposals
submitted by the faculties in the Chemical, Electrical, and
Mechanical Engineering Departments, some $218,000 was
received from the Atomic Energy Commission for equip-
ment, such as analog computers, a large heat loop, reactor
similators, infra-red spectrometers, etc.
1956-date———More recently as the Health Schools moved
to their new buildings, Pennsylvania Hall and the Upper
Dental Building were made available to the engineers

ENGINEERING HALL, the main building of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines, was completed in September of 1955.

so that at the present time the various divisions are lo-
cated in State, Thaw, Engineering, and Pennsylvania
Halls, as well as the Chemical Engineering and the Min-
eral Industries Buildings.

THE DRIVE FOR FUNDS—The current fund-raising
drive has involved some $600,000 for rehabilitation of
the old Health School buildings, State and Thaw Halls,

Energy Commission.

and for new engineering laboratories, as well as about a
million dollars for new equipment.

The drive was launched about a year ago with an open
letter to alumni and industry by Mr. Gwilym Price, Chair-
man of the Board of Trustees. Dr. E. R. -Weidlein, retired
Director of Mellon Institute and Trustee of the Univer-
sity, has been the General Chairman of the Engineering
campaign. As such, the University's administration, the
faculty, the alumni, and the students owe Dr. Weidlein a
debt of gratitude for the tremendous amount of time and
energy which he has spent on the project. Because of his
wide acquaintance among top industrialists in the coun-
try, many of whom had at one time been located at
Mellon Institute, the Engineering story at Pitt was pre-
sented to many executives who otherwise would have re-
fused to listen. Dr. Weidlein’s efforts contributed much
to the University's public relations.

Initially, the drive involved the alumni and their re-
sponse was exceptional. Teams of well-known alumni
were established in various centers of alumni concentra-
tion throughout the country. Incidentally, 75 per cent of
all the engineers in the United States are employed in a
parallelogram extending from Milwaukee to Boston, to
Norfolk, Va., and St. Louis, Mo. Almost exactly the same
percentage of Pitt engineering alumni are also in this

10

area. However, others are located in such areas as New
York, Baltimore-Washington, Birmingham, the Texas-
Oklahoma region, and the West Coast. Alumni teams
located in strategic spots over the country were most help-
ful in contacting alumni and in arranging interviews with
industrialists.

Also, the faculty staged a “phonorama” during the drive
in which a great many of the alumni in this county and
some across the country were contacted by telephone.
Many alumni later expressed their appreciation for hav-
ing had a chat with a former professor.

As a result of the alumni drive, some four times as
many alumni gave three times as much as ever before
and the engineers are now among the top groups of
alumni in the University for their generous giving. This
assistance is greatly appreciated by everyone on the
campus.

Initially, the drive for corporate and foundation dona-
tions was restricted to areas outside of Allegheny County
because of the pending University Health Schools—Hos-
pital drive. However, starting last May, Dr. Weidlein and
the dean visited most of the presidents of the large Pitts-
burgh corporations.

THIS ANALOG COMPUTER was donated by the Atomic Energy Com-
mission. Dr. James Coull demonstrates operation procedure.

Some executives spontaneously reacted by praising the
calibre of engineers from Pitt and one president stated
without hesitation, when he saw his list, that three of
the alumni were without question the top three execu-
tives of his company. Undoubtedly, other engineering
colleges have had similar experiences, but it was heart-
warming and reassuring to receive this reaction from such
outstanding executives.

As a result, some of the persons contacted stated im-
mediately that they would support the drive within the
educational support policies of their companies. Others
promised to submit the problem to their educational com-
mittee, and some promised outright to give something.

As a result of these and other efforts, considerable
equipment (perhaps $200,000 value) has been given to
the Schools and the needed rehabilitation funds have
been reduced to less than $200,000. Additional gifts are
anticipated this fall, so that this particular drive may be
concluded by the end of this calendar year.

It was a rare privilege to be able to tell the engineer-
ing story at Pitt to these top industrialists and the in-
terest which they exhibited was genuinely enthusiastic.
Because of the lack of organized publicity given engineer~
ing at Pitt, many of these individuals were unaware of,
but undoubtedly impressed, with the records which Pitt
engineers have made. During these interviews each execu-
tive was presented with a list of Pitt almuni employed by
his company. A great many executives were surprised to
ﬁnd that their “right-hand” men were Pitt graduates.
Some even found that their predecessor was from Pitt.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
CURRICULAR STUDY—For nearly six years now the
Dean and the members of the faculty have been working
on the modernization of all curricula. As a result, the
current undergraduate and graduate programs are on a
level with the top engineering schools in the country. In
fact, several programs are so much in advance of develop-
ments at many other schools that they are now being
adopted elsewhere.

But the engineering faculty has not been content with
this. One must consider that the students in school today
will be mature engineers in the year 2,000. All courses
and curricula must be considered in this light.

One of the studies referred to above involved a con-
sideration of what areas of the engineering sciences should
be emphasized by each department in the future and what
new courses will be needed. The question was raised as
to whether the present faculty was sufficient or should
additional people be obtained to develop the necessary
areas of emphasis. Following these decisions, new courses
need to be developed, text books written, and new lab-
oratories constructed.

During the past year, Dr. S. C. Hollister, formerly Vice
Chancellor and Dean of Engineering at Cornell, has
served as a consultant in curricular development. He has
raised the question as to what the engineer of the future
(i.e., 2,000 A.D.) should know. The pursuit of this ques-
tion has been very rewarding and some of the factors were
outlined by Dr. Hollister at the Alumni Meeting last June.

As a result of these studies, faculty committees have
been established with engineering teachers and members
of the respective ‘staffs of other areas of the University.
These are the Humanities and Social Sciences, Mathe-
matics, Chemistry, Physics, Geology, Biology, the Schools
of Public Health, Public and International Affairs, the
Computer Center, and an Engineering and Science Li-

brary Committee. All of these committees have been asked
to explore the impact of their discipline on the engineer
of the future; what changes can be expected in each of
these disciplines, and which, if any, should be included
in engineering curricula now so as to prepare the engi-
neer for the year 2,000 and beyond.

Sufficient work has been done to reveal the possibilities
of such studies and to encourage the staff to submit a
proposal for the support of these curricular studies to the
Ford Foundation last August.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT——It has been decided
by the administration that Engineering and Science will
be the recipients of the next large development program
on this campus. As a result, considerable study has been
made of space and it has been decided that some 350,000
square feet of new space would be required by the engi-
neers. A rough estimate has placed the cost of the build-
ing at about $13,000,000, and the Logan Armory site is
being considered. The University now has an offer to buy
these grounds.

In addition to the above, it is estimated that approxi-
mately $1,500,000 of additional equipment will be needed.

OTHER NEEDS—Certainly some of the most important
and pressing needs are funds for faculty salaries, new staff
members, visiting professors, faculty research, non-faculty
personnel, such as secretaries, and technicians. These
needs have been studied and estimated to total some
$1,200,000 for the next eight or ten years.

From this summary it may be seen that much dynamic
effort is going into the advancement of the engineering
programs. At the same time, changes are being made
cautiously so that the entire program is always kept into
proper perspective.

Sufficient work has already been done by the faculty
to indicate that if adequate ﬁnancial support is provided,
the engineering program at Pitt will be recognized by

11

the engineers of the future as being among the best
anywhere.

INTERNATIONAL SCOPE—In 1952, while attending
a steel making meeting of the Economic Commission for
Latin America (Division of the United Nations), the Dean
arranged a 3-2 cooperative program with the University
of the Andes in Bogota, Colombia. Their students spend
three years in preparation on their campus and two years
at Pitt. To date, some twenty-ﬁve Colombians have re-
ceived their degrees in engineering from Pitt.

Partially as a result of this same trip, the Schools of
Engineering and Mines are currently assisting in the de-
velopment of engineering and engineering aide training
in two schools in Chile through a contract with the Inter-
national Cooperation Administration with our State De-
partment. Actually ten schools are involved, nine of which
are operated by the State Technical University and the
other by the University of Santa Maria. At the latter

school, which is a privately endowed school, the first
doctoral engineering program in Latin America is being
developed. Four staff members and their families are cur-
rently in Chile. In addition the dean has visited the
schools twice and Dr.  F. Calvert (Chairman of the Elec-
trical Engineering Department), Professor N. L. Buck
(Chairman of the Mechanical Engineering Department),
and Dr. Charles Scott (Chairman of Vocational Education)
have also been to Chile on the project.

Since entering into this venture Dr.  A. Berger (Chair-
man of Metallurgical Engineering Department) has been
to Argentina at which time a program to train steel execu-
tives from seven countries in Latin America was estab-
lished and later successfully completed. Also Professor N.
L. Buck has since returned to Chile to advise on the de-
velopment in the University of Concepcion. The dean
has also been asked to serve on the President’s Advisory
Panel on the Development of Engineering Education in
Latin Americag

Some straight talk
about or career

at American Oil

“This Company recognizes the Value of varied
experience, and encourages you to broaden your
knowledge.”

Roger Fisher, B.Ch.E. from Cornell and Ph.D.
candidate from Princeton is one of many young
scientists and engineers at American Oil shaping
the future for himself, his Company and the
industry. At 26, he has earned a Fulbright
Scholarship and will take a year’s leave of
absence to continue his graduate research on
solids mixing at the University of Osaka, Japan.

“American Oil is looking for broad—gauge
research people,” Roger adds. “In the long run,
the Company beneﬁts as well as the professional
who continues to grow in his own or in several
ﬁelds of research.”

Roger’s present assignment at American Oil
involves applied research——to plan, design, build
and operate bench scale lab equipment, to study
the kinetics of catalytic cracking. His is one of
many diversiﬁed projects at American Oil Com-
pany. Chemists, chemical engineers, physicists,
mathematicians and metallurgists can ﬁnd inter-
esting and important work in their own ﬁelds.

The ability of American Oil to attract bright
young scientists and engineers like Roger Fisher
might have special meaning to you. For complete

l\/Ir. \Villiam A. Steele is of particu-
lar interest since he received his de-
gree in metallurgical Engineering.
Following his graduation in 1923, Mr.
Steele became associated with Cru-
cible Steel Corporation at Midland,
Pennsylvania. He was in the opera-
tions division, serving as blast furnace
superintendent from 1930 to 1941 and
as assistantigeneral superintendent
from 1941 to 1943. After being asso-
ciated with Wickwire Spencer Steel
Company in Buffalo, New York, in
1943, as general superintendent, Mr.
Steele joined Wheeling Steel Corpora-

tion.

He was general manager of Wheel-
ing Steel plants at Benwood, VVest
Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio in
the period from 1943 to 1955, when
he was elected Vice President in
charge of operations. After serving as
executive vice president from 1957 to
1958, Mr. Steele was elected President
and Chief Executive Officer of Wheel-
ing Steel Corporation in April, 1958.
He recently became Chairman of the
Board of Directors, and has served on

the Board since 1955.
Mr. Stee.le has also been active at

the University. He has been a mem-
ber of the Engineering Advisory
Council for some time. Speaking for
the Engineering faculty, Dean Fitterer
commented, “We are all very much
impressed with Mr. Steele’s ability,
and the breadth of his understanding
of engineering and engineering edu-
cation. It has been a pleasure to work
with him on various projects and we
are all very happy that the University
has taken this occasion to honor him‘

Frankly, there is no practical substitute
for the wheel today. But at Ford Motor
Company, our scientists and engineers
refuse to give "no" for an answer. They
are tackling, among others, the problem
of wheelless vehicles for tomorrow.

Is "tomorrow" really far off? Not according
to the men at Ford. Already they've devel-
oped the Levacar as one possibility. It
replaces the wheel with /evapads, per-
forated discs which emit powerful air jets
to support the vehicle. Air suspension—if
you wi|l—of an advanced degree. Imagine
traveling swiftly, safely at up to 500 mph,
riding on a tissue-thin ﬁlm of air. Guided
unerringly by a system of rails. Propelled
by powerful turboprops. This is the
Levacan

Meanwhile we've still got the wheel. And
the job of building better cars for today.
So we hope you won't mind riding on
wheels just a little longer while we con-
centrate on both tasks.

A PROFESSIONAL CAREER

.1.‘-

Recently Ohio University made a man—on-the street sur-
very to find out what the public thinks about engineer-
ing.‘ “What is an engineer?” was the question posed.

“An engineer is a normal person who is more than
normally interested in what seems to be a dull job to an
outsider,” was one answer. “His tools are his brains and
his hands, but he works without a well-rounded per-
sonality,” said another. Other interesting answers were,
“A well-learned person, but sometimes one-sided,” and
“Engineers are too wrapped up in their work to have a
normal social life.”

On June 11, 1951, the magazine, NEWSWEEK, pub-
lished the following comment from a reader:
“ENGINEER SHORTAGE: An item in NEWSWEEK,
May 21, says that there is a shortage. of ‘engineers.’ This
problem can be easily licked. There is not much to the
average American ‘engineer’ anyway. A good shop fore-
man or machinist could be trained in a few weeks to do
anything that most engineers do. The mass-produced
American ‘engineer’ is not a creative type like Gottlieb
Daimler or Rudolf Diesel. In fact, he is coming to be
noted far and wide for the jejune sterility of his mind . . 

The fact that NEWSWEEK gave space to such observa-
tions, and the fact that Ohio University’s random sam-
pling of a group whose occupations represented nearly

‘every economic and social level in the United States pro-

duced such answers, points up the fact that not everybody
recognizes the engineer as a professional.

Before we discuss the question of building a profes-
sional career, let’s take a long look backward into the past
and see how the ancients regarded engineering.

It has been said that the history of civilization is the
history of engineering. Certainly, the Egyptians could not
have built the great Pyramid in 3000 B.C. unless they had
reached a relatively high level of engineering skill. The
Coliseum in Rome and the Parthenon in Greece are en-
gineering monuments to cultures that followed the Egyp-
tian civilization. Bridges, highways, canals, docks and har-
bors remain as enduring monuments to the ancients. We
can still see the remains of the aqueducts of ancient Rome,
and the principles of paving and drainage established by
the road builders of the Roman empire were used for
centuries.

Some of you may recall a story in THE LOS ANGELES

OCTOBER 1961

TIMES not very long ago concerning an irate villager in
England. Apparently, the old Roman road ran through
his village and badly needed repairs. After several years
of fruitless correspondence with his local County Council
he ﬁnally wrote the City Council of Rome in Italy:
“Gentlemen:
The road which runs past my home, constructed
some time ago by your engineers is in a disgrace-
ful state of disrepair. I request that you take
immediate action to remedy this. If there is no
appropriation in your budget for this type of
situation, I suggest that you send the bill to the
British government.”
His local council was incensed at the wide publicity given
to his letter, but they repaired the road in a hurry.

In ancient times the word, “engineer,” was unknown.
The ancient Greeks used the word, “ARCHITEKTON,”
to refer to a master builder, but the ARCHITEKTON
was what we would cal.l a civil engineer as well. However,
progress in engineering was limited because of their tra-
ditional contempt for manual labor, which they consid-
ered degrading. Even Archimedes felt that engineering
was “sordid and ignoble,” according to Plutarch. He apol-
ogized for his inventions such as catapults, pulleys and a
screw pump, which he regarded as mere diversions.

The Roman engineer the ARCHITECTUS—was a
practical man who helped to make technology a dominant
force in the Roman empire. While they contributed noth-
ing really new to basic engineering theories, they estab-
lished many practical techniques in construction that were
in use up to the 19th century.

In the non-industrial middle ages we ﬁrst come across
the parent word for “engineer”———INGENIATOR, mean-
ing one who designs and directs engines of war. So, en-
gineering in the middle ages, and, in fact, until the 19th

century was almost entirely a government-controlled en-
terprise. For the most part, it involved the construction
of public works and military engineering.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, France provided
an era of important advances which laid the foundations
of modern engineering science. It was not so much the
beauty and design of their bridges or the excellence of
construction in their canal building as the theoretic for-
mulations of such ‘men as Coulomb, Navier and Chezy

19

 

which helped transform engineering from an empirical
craft to an exact science. The French were also the'ﬁrst
to give professional recognition to engineers by establish-
ing the ﬁrst civil engineering school in the world in 1747.2

The industrial revolution in England, created for the
ﬁrst time in history, a need for engineers by private in-
dustry. It was these engineers who laid the groundwork
for modern assembly—line production; and the need for
engineers in the manufacture of heavy machinery and in
the generation and harnessing of power produced, in
time,‘ a diversity of engineering specialties.

The British textile industry became the largest in the
world, thanks to engineers who increased production
speeds enormously by developing the fly shuttle, and
then the spinning jenny and the spinning mule.

In 19th century Britain we begin to see the beginning
of professional recognition for the engineer who had pre-
viously been looked upon as little better than a common
laborer. Back in the 18th century John Smeaton was the
ﬁrst engineer to use the word, “civil,” to distinguish his
calling from that of the military engineer and, in urging
the recognition of engineering as a regular profession, he
helped organize the first society of engineers. The ﬁrst
society comprised entirely of civil engineers—the Institu-
tion of Civil Engineers of Great Britain—was not founded
until 1818, however; and then in 1847 the next specialized
society to be established was the Institution of Mechanical
Engineering. Here we see for the ﬁrst time the emergence
of mechanical engineering as a separate profession.

Until the l9th century engineering inventions and dis-
coveries were not, for the most part, the result of scientiﬁc
analysis. Usually the invention came ﬁrst and the scientiﬁc
explanation came later. The inventor of the steam engine,
for example, had no knowledge of the thermodynamics on
which it was based. Now, however, along with practical
techniques engineering theories were developed to ex-
plain those techniques and to guide engineers in the de-
velopment of new methods.

How about engineering in our own country? Well, in
the United States, it was at ﬁrst little influenced by foreign
ideas and techniques. In the early 19th century most
American engineers were itinerant craftsmen and design-
ers who, in spite of their lack of formal training produced
some remarkable results. It makes you stop and wonder

20

when you consider that the ﬁrst great engineering feat
accomplished in the United States—the building of the
Erie Canal—-—was the work of pioneering, untutored men
whose knowledge of engineering techniques was almost
entirely based on empirical rules.

However, as iron and steel replaced wood, trained civil
engineers became necessary and the mechanization of in-
dustry fostered the need for mechanical engineers. As the
demand rose, more and more engineering schools came
into being. The ﬁrst college course in civil engineering
was started at Norwich College, Vermont, in 1819. Rens-
selaer began its engineering course in 1825 and it was
not until 1865 that M.I.T. started operations.

After the turn of the present century both electrical
and mechanical engineering expanded tremendously and,
as engineering problems became increasingly complex, the
profession became divided into many specialties. These
required more thorough professional training and, with
this, came increased social recognition for the American
engineer. The rising demand for highly trained men led
to strict professional qualiﬁcations and regular standards
in every state of the union.

Previously I stated that engineering did not spring
originally from scientiﬁc research. Today, however, en-
gineering is being increasingly inﬂuenced, and even
shaped, by the discoveries of research scientists. More and
more, the gap between the scientist as THINKER and
the engineer as DOER is being narrowed. Today the en-
gineer must be a scientist . . . this is the engineer of the
future.

Now, let us turn from a historical review of engineer-
ing and consider some practical steps toward building a
professional career. As the engineering student approaches
the threshold of his college career and prepares to step
into the business world, it is time to pause and take stock.
In the ﬁrst place he is emerging from an area which has
become secure and well known to him into an area where
once again he must assume a freshman role. He may be
confused by the variety of opportunities which confront
him and by the qualities he needs to seize these oppor-
tunities.

What are some of these qualities which will help him?

Two of the most important are COURAGE and INTEG-
RITY. Since it is rarely possible to ﬁgure out a dead-sure
answer to an engineering problem in advance, he must
be willing to take a calculated risk. He must avoid any
tendency just to “get by,” since human lives may depend
on his judgment. The laws of nature with which he deals
are ﬁxed and inescapable, so he must have complete
honesty in thought and action. No amount of brilliance
will enable him to triﬂe with or ignore the laws of nature.
Straight thinking and honest action are essential to the
engineer.

The individual who hopes to succeed in professional
life must have a sustained THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE.
The engineer in particular must have a natural inclina-
tion to explore the fundamental truths of mathematics
and physics. A prominent educator puts it like this——“the
acquisition of knowledge is like holding a torch aloft in
the dark—the larger the torch, the more darkness can
be seen.”

I/Villiam Wickenden says that “IMAGINATION of
conception, a strong native sense of quantity and form,
properly may be called one of the factors most vital to
successful engineering.”3 Most major accomplishments
have started out as lowly ideas to which have been applied
imagination and creative thinking.

SOUND JUDGMENT is an inherent trait but it may
be reﬁned and sharpened and further developed. An en-
gineer must be able to analyze and evaluate a problem,
to place a proper value on each aspect of a situation and
to foresee the probable consequences resulting from each
step in the solution of the problem. It is this capacity for
sound judgment which enables him to differentiate be-
tween feasibility and mere speculation.

AN INSTINCT FOR ECONOMY is another major
requisite suggested by Wickenden. Anyone who has man-

OCTOBER 1961

aged an engineering project will attest to the importance
of this. And let us differentiate here between cheapness
and economy. In an engineering project, the cheapest way
of doing it is not necessarily of prime importance, but
rather the way which gives the most effective results or the
largest useful return for the ﬁnancial outlay and the
effort expended.

APTITUDE FOR LEADERSHIP becomes more and
more important to the engineer of today. The ability to
work with people of diverse views is essential. The ability
to “sell” ideas and projects with convincing logic and
understanding tolerance is a serious factor in modern
industry.

THE ABILITY TO THINK AND SPEAK LUCIDLY
is a quality of paramount importance to engineers and
one which is receiving increasing attention. How else can
the engineer transmit the results of his thinking to others?
How else can he prepare proposals and make presenta-
tions to his superiors and to the customer?

THE CAPACITY FOR HARD WORK as a quality
for success may sound trite but, believe me, it isn’t! Suc-
cess just doesn’t happen, and the young engineer can be
sure he will never achieve greatness or prominence with-
out continuing study and a generous amount of hard
work.

Now, I’m sure that there are other qualities which will
occur to many of you but I give you these to start you
thinking as you review your plans.

Your next question in considering your professional
career is, “Just where will I ﬁt into the engineering pro-
fession?” I/Vell, this is a hard question for anyone else to
answer for you but there are a few pointers to bear in
mind.

In the ﬁrst place, don’t sit back and wait to be sought
after. Look the ﬁeld over with care and choose your ﬁrst

21

job with discrimination. Decide whether you want to work
for a large company or a smaller one and weigh the ad-
vantages of each. Consider whether you are choosing with
a View to permanence or with the intention of shifting
about. Most engineers will ﬁnd that a certain number of
well-timed changes are important to their development.
Can you get those beneﬁts in a single, large organization
or must you shift from one to another? Two things are
important: one is that experience, however varied, must
be cumulative, adding up to something coherent, and
steadily rise in its levels of responsibility; the other is that
it should not be allowed at any level to bog down into
sheer routine.

Your choice of a curriculum in college has decided your
general career. There are no great differences between the
major branches of engineering as far as your inborn gifts
and aptitudes are concerned. Within each area, however,
there are different functions which demand fairly distinct
types of individual interest and ability. Wickenden char-
acterizes them in this way:4 One group centers around the
task of INVESTIGATION—experimental, analytical or
economic; another, around the task of TESTING AND
DEVELOPMENT; another, around the task of PLAN-
NING the programs of construction; another, around the
SUPERVISION of operations; another, around the AP-
PLICATION of products or services; and another, around
the closely related SELLING of goods and services.

He suggests that, in ﬁtting himself into this complex,
the young engineer’s task is to match what it takes and
what he has. One way to approach it would be to lay out
a chart on the checkerboard plan, with divisions on one
axis corresponding to a list of functions such as those
enumerated above and with divisions on the other axis
for a group of distinctive abilities which all engineers are
supposed to possess in some degrees. These might be (1)
mathematical, (2) experimental,  critical, (4) visualiz-
ing, (5) inventive, (6) organizing, (7) expository, (8) per-
suasive, etc. Then the next step would be to try to think
out on a scale of 1 to 5—or perhaps 1 to 10—the relative

importance of each of these abilities in performing each
of the functions. Having done this, he would then have
to make an honest appraisal of his own abilities on the
same scale and to try his individual proﬁle against those
of the several functions.

Assuming that you have now found your niche in the
engineering world, your task in building a professional
career has only begun. One of your major tasks now is to
KEEP KNOW'LEDGEABLE.

The most singular mark of a professional man is his
continuing interest in education as a medium of profes-
sional growth. You must recognize early in your career
that the responsibility is yours for establishing your edu-
cational objectives and planning a program to work to-
wards those goals. Most companies will assist you by help-
ing to ﬁnance your educational costs but you must take
the step. Experience has shown that, unless you prepare
your plan soon after leaving college, you are not likely
ever to do so.

Obviously you must keep abreast of technical develop-
ments. If you neglect this, you will soon be left far behind
in your ﬁeld. You should consider, too, as we mentioned a
short time ago, improving your communications skills. A

broader appreciation of the business and social institu-
tions of our environment will also be valuable to you.
Your choice of achieving your educational goals is
varied. University extension courses are the most obvious
means but don’t neglect a continued review of the pub-
lished literature in your field. The other major means of
continuing education is, of course, your technical societies.
Here is another major step towards building your pro-
fessional career——affiliation with a professional society. As
an engineer you need your profession for your personal
advancement, perhaps most of all at the beginning of your
career. You need for your growth wider sources of infor-
mation, more varied personal associations, broader stimu-
lation to achievement and less formal contacts with your
seniors than you would normally ﬁnd on the job. By no

other means can you acquire so much for so little than by

becoming afﬁiliated with and active in the professional
engineering society which embraces your technical spe-
cialty.

Where else for so small a sum can you buy a year’s
“ticket” to the local technical meetings where fellow en—
gineers in your chosen ﬁeld discuss the advances and ques-
tions on the problems of the day; a year’s supply of the
most authentic and up—to-date literature of current tech-
nical developments in your chosen ﬁeld; a year’s “ticket”
to the social comradeship of your fellow engineers?

By taking an active part in your society, you can in time
gain outside recognition and you will ﬁnd, as men mature,
they come to value professional rewards as much and
often more than ﬁnancial rewards.

I/Vith a professional career come professional obliga-
tions. Every professional man must be aware of his obli-
gation to contribute to the advancement of his group.
Many of you have undoubtedly read Wickenden’s famous
address, “The Second Mile.” You will recall that the title
is taken from the biblical injunction, “Whoever shall com-
pel thee to go one mi.le—go with him twain.” He points
out that every calling has its mile of compulsion, its
round of tasks and duties, its prescribed man—to-man rela-
tionships, which one must traverse daily if he is to survive.
Beyond that is the mile of voluntary effort where men
strive for special excellence, seek self-expression more than
material gain and give that unrequited margin of service
to the common good. The best fun in life, he says, and
most of its durable satisfactions lie in this second mile,
and it is only here that a calling can attain the dignity
and distinction of a profession.

The full-scale professional man is not content to stop
in the first mile in making his contribution to the ad-
vancement of his group. He still has a debt to the past—

OCTOBER 1961

a repayment for the inheritance of knowledge and tech-
niques willed him by past generations. He can pay this
debt only by passing his knowledge on to the future—by
publishing freely the results of research and by sharing
the advances in professional technique.

Equally important in your professional development is
the assumption of your responsibilities as a citizen, your
participation in community affairs and in sharing your
responsibility in establishing and maintaining our de-
mocracy.

One of the best ways of becoming an integral part of
your community is by making a personal contribution to
its affairs. Possibly the best measure of good citizenship is
the service which the individual can render. But the ﬁelds
of service should reﬂect your genuine interest and inclina-
tions—social or religious, educational or political.

The professional man usually commands the respect of
those around him—his friends, his neighbors. Many suc-
cessful engineers are rendering valuable service on boards
of education, industry-education committees and other
civic committees. Some engineers are among our country’s
outstanding statesmen. You should begin by volunteering
for some service during the ﬁrst few years of your career.

Engineers are frequently critical of the shortcomings
of solutions to community problems, but these same en-
gineers have frequently been unwilling to share the bur-
den of working together to have better answers accepted.

Let us summarize then the major points we have con-
sidered towards building a professional career:

First, I suggested that, as you cross the threshold of col-
lege to industry, you stop and conduct a self—appraisal, and
I offered some desirable qualities for your consideration. I
suggested that you review your plans of where you want
to ﬁt into the engineering profession. And I would advise
that you keep your plans under constant review both early
in your career and as you progress.

Second, I pointed out that you must plan to keep
knowledgeable throughout your career. You must keep
up—or stagnate.

Third, I indicated to you the great importance of the
professional society in your professional advancement. I
hope you will seriously reﬂect on the beneﬁts that can
accrue from this.

Finally, I have outlined some of the‘ obligations which
go with a professional career——obligations to pass on your
knowledge and to play your part as a worthwhile citizen.

In closing, I would like to commend to you this para-
graph from “Faith of the Engineer,” as a thought to con-
sider throughout your career: “When needed, my skill and
knowledge shall be given without reservation for the pub-
lic good. From specialicapacity springs the obligation to
use it well in the service of humanity; and I accept the
challenge that this implies.” .

Things

tomorrow:

Man is like a Goldfish in 8. Bowl Of Ink. . .1-Iis view of the "ultraviolet universe" is
shut off by the blanket of air which surrounds him.

The earth's atmosphere is like the ink in a goldfish bowl. It absorbs so much of the ultraviolet
light from outer space that little gets through to show us what lies out there.

But now, an electronic imaging tube, sensitive to this ultraviolet light has been developed by
Westinghouse Research scientists. Westinghouse is working with the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to mount these tubes in satellites so that they can
"see" in outer space and radio their findings back to earth.

Every time mankind removes the limitations on human sight...with the telescope, the microscope, the
fluoroscope and electronic imaging tubes...we find things which have a profound effect upon our lives.

This is just one of the exciting things going on at Westinghouse, one of the many reasons why
Westinghouse is the best place for talented engineers. See our representative when he is on your
campus, or write to L. H. Noggle, Westinghouse Educational Department, Pittsburgh 21, Pennsylvania.

5 4.’. --..

The undergraduate engineer may wonder what im-
portance a paper dealing with management methods has
to him. After all, he is in training to become skilled in
the area of his specialty. The reason is simple enough.
More and more in recent years executives have been look-
ing into the engineering ranks to select men for man-
agerial positions—not just in the area of the men's
specialties, but in general management as well. Thus, it
is important that engineers have a good understanding
of the managing process whether it be the management
of a small group of men or the over—all direction of an
enterprise.

Some years ago, during the course of a consulting en-

OCTOBER 1961

By WILLIAM M. AIKEN

gagement with a very successful company, I had a number
of occasions to talk with the general manager of the com-
pany. During one discussion, he pointed out that his
management philosophy was based on a simple three-step
formula. This formula was “Plan your work, work your
plan, and follow up.” This, in a few words, was a ﬁne
description of a very good manager's approach to his job.
And it is also an engineer's approach.

Unfortunately, there are engineers and managers in
American industry who do not have even this simple
understanding of their jobs. If businesses are to be suc-
cessful, these people must ﬁnd ways of managing more
effectively. But ﬁrst, they must be able to recognize when
they are managing and when they are not——when they
are doing work of a management nature and when they
are doing something else. Perhaps the ﬁrst thing they must
determine is just what managing is and how it is done.

Until recently it has been diﬂicult for engineers to get
much information on the subject of managing as such.
They attend all sorts of meetings, but almost invariably
these meetings are devoted to speciﬁc subjects, such as
sales programming, cost reduction, inventory controls, and
the like. It is very unusual for any company meeting to be
devoted to the subject which concerns us most—the act
of managing. Perhaps this is due to the fact that managing
has not been recognized as a distinct kind of activity quite
apart from such functional tasks as marketing or engi-
neering. But today, progressive people realize that man-
aging is something separate—and that it is subject to
study and improvement just as engineering and other
forms of activity. The engineering student who would
progress must understand this.

It is interesting to note that an engineering analysis
has shown what a manager must do to help his company
by improving his own performance. Recently, ACME, the
Association of Consulting Management Engineers, under-
took a thorough study of the manager's job. They wanted
to determine the elements in the managing process that

29

successful managers follow, either consciously or subcon-
sciously. They arrived at the following eleven elements.
1. GATHER INFORMATION. Collect all
data pertinent to a situation or problem.
2. SYNTHESIZE INFORMATION. Put to-
gether all existing facts and data in order
to develop a clear picture of the situation
or problem.
3. PLAN. Consider the existing situation, the
goals to be attained, and possible alterna-
tive actions.

..-.a.--

pated. (This can lead to the establishment
of a new objective or objectives.)
DEVELOP PEOPLE. Assist individuals to
reach their full potential.

11. CREATIVE LEADERSHIP. Promote in-
novation by introducing progressive ideas
and stimulating actions.

Graphically, the elements of managing can be shown
as a continuously driven wheel. The manager establishes
an objective by gathering information, synthesizing the
information, planning approaches, and deciding on the

4. DECIDE. Select the course of action which

5. ORGANIZE. Lay out the program and the
assignments necessary to complete the pro-
gram.

6. COMMUNICATE. Advise individuals or
groups of their assignments.

7. MOTIVATE OR LEAD. Instill in individ-
uals or groups the desire to attain speciﬁed
results.

8. DIRECT, GUIDE, OR COUNSEL. Aid
progress to the goal by giving directions,
suggestions, and orders.

program. He directs the attainment of the objective by
assigning responsibilities, explaining the program, moti-
vating the people who do the work, and leading them
toward the completion of the program. Finally, the re-
sults are measured and evaluated. From the results, the
manager plans the next objective. Over and over the man-
aging process repeats with the manager following the
same basic elements.

How can the manager of a business put these elements
of managing to practical use? Since time is his principal
asset, he must concentrate on how he can make the best
use of his time. A manager knows that he has a great
variety of tasks. He may undertake tasks because he feels
that they are unavoidable, or he may do them because he
ﬁnds them interesting. Because he more or less directs

his own time, he can spend it managing or he can spend
it doing other things. This misuse of time does not apply
just to managers. It applies to many staff activities. Engi-
neers unfortunately are often in this category. Whole
engineering departments have been evaluated where the
total time devoted to real engineering work constituted
only 20% of the total available time.

Often a manager feels that he spends all of his time
managing when actually this is far from being the case.
For example, when the manager takes some visitors on a
tour of the premises, that is not managing. He is perform-
ing either a sales function or perhaps a public relations
function. When he signs payroll checks he is performing
a clerical function rather than managing. Of course, it is
not possible or desirable for most managers to spend all
of their time managing. In a small company, the presi-
dent has many speciﬁc responsibilities because there is no
other person available to handle them. He should, how-
ever, be conscious of the time he spends managing and
the time he spends not managing. He should be sure that
his managing work, which is by far the most important

part of his job, gets done before he gets involved in
speciﬁc tasks. Every manager must guard against the
natural tendency to spend time on pleasant non—demand-
ing tasks at the expense of time devoted to the hard work
of managing.

It would be most helpful if all of us really knew in
detail how we spend our time. Fortunately, with statistical
sampling techniques available, we can make a good study
of our own work to see how we spend our time. In the
course of a few weeks, and with very little effort, we can
develop a picture of how we spend our time.

Recently the president of a company became concerned
about how his own time was being spent. His company
which had an annual volume of $5,000,000 was having

OCTOBER 1961

difficulty showing proﬁt. Consequently, he decided to
make an analysis of his own job and he found this start-
ling picture of his own time utilization.

1. General management .............................. .. 1%

2. Activity area management

a. Research and development_... 0%
b. Production .............................. .. 8
c. Marketing .............................. .. 22
d. Finance and control .............. .. 0
e. Personnel ................................ .. 7
f. External relations .................. .. 3
-— 40%
3. Solving special problems .................. .. 2%
4. Clerical or routine work .................. .. 57%

With this information before him, this president had no
diﬂiculty ﬁnding out why the business was in difﬁculty.
He saw immediately that in spending only 1% of his time
in general management, he was not managing the over-all
business at all. The 40% of his time spent on speciﬁc func-
tions was probably satisfactory for a business of this size.
However, the 40% was not distributed equitably. Because
he was an ex-salesman who liked to deal with people, he
spent 32% of the 40% on sales, personnel, and external
relations work. Production received the remaining 8%,
presumably because he recognized that he had to spend
time here if he were to have products to sell. However,
the very important functions of research for new products
and services and the control of costs and proﬁtability re-
ceived none of his attention.

This is by no means an unusual situation. Several years
ago our ﬁrm made a study of how some 50 presidents of
successful companies spent their time. We found a strong
tendency for all of the presidents to continue to take an
active interest in and to devote a good deal of his personal
time to the function in which he had the majority of his
previous experience. Certainly there is nothing wrong
with this as long as the other important functions are not
neglected. But if the former salesman feels that the com-
pany’s only major problem is sales, then other functions

31

wil.l receive less attention than they should. A company is
not in business to perfect the manner in which any single
function is handled. All functions must be given atten-
tion in proportion to their importance.

Properly, this president was spending very little of the
time (2%) on solving special problems. This is the work
of the technician or specialist. If, for example, the presi-
dent should decide that work measurement should be
introduced into his company, he should obtain experts in
work measurement. They will do the technical work while
the president concerns himself with the way the work is
organized, and with motivating both his management stalf
and his workers to accept it willingly.

In the fourth category—clerical and routine work—the
president could make an immediate improvement. He was
spending 57% of his time on work that could be delegated
to clerks and others. He had fallen into the trap that
many managers have—doing the easy work that required
no creative effort. He recognized that the business was
suffering because he was spending his time foolishly on
work that could be done just as well by others.

Just how foolishly his time was being spent might be
illustrated by attaching money values to the work he was
doing. Assume that the going salary for general manage-
ment work is $4,000 per month; for activity area manage-

$1,000 per month; and for clerical work $400 per month.
If these salary levels. are applied to the president’s time, he
will be worth to his company $40 per month for general
management, $600 per month for activity area manage-
ment, $20 per month for solving special problems, and
$228 per month for clerical and routine work. Thus, his
total worth to the company is $888 per month. Any salary
scale can be substituted into these calculations, but the
fact remains that the president who receives a president’s
salary for doing low level work is not giving value re-
ceived to his company.

It is important that engineers continue to improve the
productivity of production and office people. But, it is
even more important, I feel, to improve the effectiveness
and productivity of managers. Management talent is still
one of the greatest shortages that American industry faces
today. It behooves any engineer who becomes a manager
to study his job, apply the elements of managing, and
strive continuously to devote his time to managing be-
fore permitting himself the luxury of doing non-managing
work. That is the one sure way that they will contribute
to their own personal success, as well as to help raise the
level of management in our nation. And by raising the
level of management, we will strengthen private enter-
prise—the cornerstone of o11r free way of life. This, then,

ment $1,500 per month; for solving special problems is the challenge faced by the young engineer of tomorrow.

A computer system must be versatile. The IBM 1401 sys-
tem, for instance, might go to work in a radiation lab, a
stockbrokerage office, an air operations center, a refinery,
or any one of a hundred other places. Demands upon the
individual units of the system will vary widely.

Paul Farbanish analyzed the loads placed on the system by
different applications. One of his assignments was to de-
sign new and alternate ways for data to move from unit to
unit with the greatest speed and reliability.

Like many an engineer at IBM, his responsibility ranges
overa wide technical field. To do his job he became familiar
with many challenging areas of electronics. Within the
1401 system alone he dealt with circuits, data flow control,
input-output, storage, etc.

If a young engineer wants to move rapidly into the most
advanced areas of electronics, he would do well to consider
IBM. In the fast-expanding world of data systems and its
many peripheral fields, a man is given all the responsibility
he is able to handle. New ideas and new ways of doing
things are not only welcome but actively encouraged.

The IBM representative will be interviewing on your campus

You’ll be on a working assignment
from your first day at Hamilton Standard . . .

From the start, you’ll be working as a full member of
a group, and your training will be mainly on-the-job
training. Your particular group may be concerned
with design, or analysis, or development work. Your
fellow members will be men of varied experience . . .
some will be leading men in their ﬁelds.

Coming to us from college, you’ll bring a formal
scientiﬁc education, a knowledge of the derivative
sciences and of design techniques, and the ability to
plan, organize and analyze. But——most important
of all perhaps—you’re bound to have a fresh view-
point and a new approach to the problems we’re
facing, and this is one of the immediate contribu-
tions you can make.

Your group is going to count on you to bring the
full force of your knowledge, your ideas, and your
creative abilities to bear on the working assign-

ments you’ll have here from the very beginning.
They won’t expect the impossible from you, nor
ask you to contribute beyond your experience.
Remember, their wide experience is there for you to
call on. When you get speciﬁc assignments that
seem unusually difficult at ﬁrst, you’ll ﬁnd that
suggestions from your colleagues will clear up many
a dark area.

We believe you’ll like this group Way of working.
It gets you into things immediately—and time and

MOLECULAR SLIDE RULE

A tiny device developed by Westinghouse scientists electronically per-
forms multiplication and division by a process similar to that used in
the familiar mechanical slide rule. The device has no conventional
electronic components or circuitry, but is simply a solid slice of silicon
about the size of the head of a thumbtack and as thick as a few
sheets of paper. The silicon is a solid semiconductor crystal with its
internal structure rearranged to produce the some electronic behavior
as an entire electronic system.

TRANSPARENT STEEL

A necessary component in today's color television tube is a trans-
parent sheet of steel called a ”shadow mask." The steel used for the
mask is rolled to a mere 6/I000 of an inch thick by U. 5. Steel.
Transparency is then achieved by automatically etching exactly
441,222 perfect holes in the paper-thin piece of steel. The etching
is done by a photoengraving firm, the Buckbee Mears Company.

CIRCUIT BOARD HOLDERS

A new type printed circuit board holder used in electronic components
is being fabricated as a welded wire assembly by E. H. Titchener {'7
Co. Accurately spaced guide wires in the holder form natural slots
into which the circuit boards are inserted, held firmly in place by the
natural resilience of the wire. The main advantages of the holders
are improved air circulation and better heat dissipation, and improved
visibility for trouble shooting.

It all started like this . . .

 

OCTOBER 1961

For thirty centuries men fought—and many died—for the right to vote
for their leaders and their laws in secrecy, without fear or compulsion,
for this is the very heart of freedom. Long ago men voted by casting a
little ball into an urn, as shown above. (Our word “ballot” comes from
this ancient use of the Italian “ballota”—1ittle ball.) Other groups “bal-
loted” with shells and bronze disks of different sizes. The ﬁrst written
ballot was used in Rome in 139 B.C., and in America seventeen hundred
and sixty-eight years later.

All of these early methods of voting had one serious weakness in
common: There was no secrecy for the voter. The “Australian Ballot,”
brought to this country in 1888, did provide a degree of secrecy—but
did not eliminate the possibility of errors either in marking ballots, or
in counting them.

Thomas Edison was a pioneer in engineering a better way of voting,
and his work helped later inventors and engineers. In 1896, the United
States Voting Machine Company of Jamestown, New York, marketed
an improved device which soon was used widely throughout New York
State. This was the parent of our Automatic Voting Machine Division.

In the last election, twenty-ﬁve million men and women voted on
Automatic Voting Machines built by our AVM Division. They knew
their votes could not be thrown out because of the technical errors so
prevalent when paper ballots are used. They also knew there was no
way for anyone to tell how they voted, nor could the ﬁnal count be
tampered with.

It was engineers, of course, who developed our modern Automatic
Voting Machine into a device capable of being entrusted with man’s
most precious possession: the right to vote. And engineers will continue
to improve it, just as they play an important part in all of the 19 prod-
uct lines that Rockwell makes for 28 basic industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like to work
for, buy from, and invest in.

In keeping with our policy of ex-
posing all the false information we re-
ceived in high school geometry, we
would like to prove to you today that
actually, all triangles are isosceles.
The proof is as follows:

Given, any triangle ABC.

Draw ME perpendicular to AB at
the mid-point of AB; and draw CO,
the bisector of the angle C, intersect-
ting the line ME in O.

Draw the perpendiculars, OF and
ON, to the sides AC and BC, respec-
tively.

Then ON equals OF.

Therefore CF equals CN.

Join A and O; also join O and B.

Then AO equals BO.

Therefore the triangles AOF and
OBN are congruent. (Being right tri-
angles having AO equal to BO and
OF equal to ON.)

Therefore AF equals BN.

Therefore AF plus FC equals CN
plus NB, or AC equals BC.

Three men who had a monkey
bought a pile of mangoes. At night
one of the men came to the pile of
mangoes while the others slept and,
ﬁnding that there was just one more
mango than could be divided exactly
by three, tossed the extra mango to
the monkey and took away one third
of the remainder. Then he went back
to sleep. Presently another of them
awoke and went to the pile of man-
goes. He also found just one too many
to be divided evenly by three, so he
tossed the extra one to the monkey,
took one third of the remainder, and
returned to sleep. After a while the
third arose also, and he too gave one
mango to the monkey and took away
the number of whole mangoes which
represented precisely one third of the
rest.

Next morning the men got up and
went to the pile. Again they found
just one too many, so they gave one
to the monkey and divided the rest
evenly. What is the least number of
mangoes with which this can be done?

I have long been an ardent chess
player, yet my twelve-year-old daugh-
ter scarcely knows the moves. (The
reader may be assured; he need not
know them either.) Recently two of
my friends, who are chess experts,
came to dinner. After dinner I played
one game with each of them and lost
both games. Just as we ﬁnished, my
daughter came into the room. On
learning of my ill success she said:
“Daddy, I’m ashamed of you. I can
do better than that. Let me play
them! I don't want any advantage——
I’ll play one game with white pieces
and one with black. (In chess, the
white pieces always move ﬁrst.) And
I’ll give them an advantage by play-
ing both games at once. Still, I shall
make out better than you did.”

We took her up immediately on
this. To my mingled delight and cha-
grin, she made good; she did better
than I had.

But how did she do it?

Monorail "Airtrain"— a compact, high-
speed transportation system that will be
automatic and practically noiseless.
Construction is now being planned by
leading U.S. cities to provide eﬁicient,
low-cost urban transit. Lightweight

Monorail design demands strong,
weight-saving metals. Logical choice:
Nickel—containing materials such as
nickel steels for the basic structure,
nickel steel ca-stings for underframes,
trucks, other load-bearing assemblies.

And Nickel Stainless Steel is a natural
for skin and trim on cars—its excellent
strength-to-weight ratio permits th-in-
ner gauge body shells for dead-weight
reduction, its handsome finish stays
virtually maintenance—free.

How Inco Nickel helps engineers make new designs possible and practical

When engineers design a transit
system, a nuclear ocean liner, or a
gas-turbine car, chances are Nickel,
or one of its alloys can help the equip-
ment perform better. Nickel—contain-
ing metals can provide valuable
combinations of corrosion resistance,
ductility, workability, and strength
at extreme high and low tempera-
tures. Over the years, Inco has
developed new alloys and gathered
data on the performance of materials
under demanding service conditions.
This data is available to help solve
future metal problems.

tions of 200 Inco publications cover-

used in steel members provided high
strength at minimum weight to support
the giant reﬂector.

alloy shifts magnetization direction
from longitudinal to a helical path.

Interview with General Electric’s Dr. J. H. Hollomon
Manager—GeneraI Engineering Laboratory

Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?

A. There are four signiﬁcant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.

1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
and adequate water resources.

2. The shift in our economy from agri- -_

culture and manufacturing to “serv-
ices”: today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,

and recreation are new needs. They'

require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.

3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.

4. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the “haves” of our society must
provide the industry and the tools for the
“have-nots” of the new countries if they
are to share the advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.

We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric’s future growth
and contribution.

Q. Could you give us some examples?

A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for

"handling it in computers.

DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric’s centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adjunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Dr. Hollomon’s opinions.

example, new methods of purifying
salt water and speciﬁc techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa, South America, and
Southern Asia.

We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve

._their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-

information, or
We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing

industries.

Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?

A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men, the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
—how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.

For scientists, look to those new ﬁelds
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world

in which we live.

But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored by
the company for which you work.

Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?

A. General Electric is a large diver-
siﬁed company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as Well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

A recent address by Dr. Hollomon
entitled ”Engineering’s Great Challenge
— the 1960's,” will be of interest to
most Juniors, Seniors, and Graduate
Students. It's available by addressing
your request to: Dr. J. H. Hollomon,

What it is and how it works

The Loop Course is our program con-
ducted annually for selecting and train-
ing qualiﬁed college graduates for
careers with Bethlehem Steel. It was
established 40 years ago. From the
very beginning, it included an observa-
tional circuit (or “loop") of a steel
plant, ergo the name. Many men hold-
ing key positions with Bethlehem to-
day entered the company through the
Loop Course.

Promotion from IVithin—The Loop
Course is speciﬁcally designed to pro-
vide management personnel. Since it is
our policy to promote from within, it
is vital that competent men, well-
grounded in our practices and policies,
be available to ﬁll management open-
ings as they occur. And, due to Bethle-
hem’s steady growth, there has been
no lack of opportunities to advance.

The Basic Conrse—Every looper at-
tends the initial ﬁve-week course held
at our home olﬁce in Bethlehem, Pa.,
beginning early in July. He attends
orientation lectures, listens to dis-
cussions by management men on all
phases of company operations, and
makes daily trips through the local

Sr

steel plant. At the end of this period
he has a sound basic knowledge of
the Bethlehem organization.

Their First Assignments—At the end
of the basic course, loopers receive their
ﬁrst assignments. Ordinarily a large
majority report to our steelmaking
plants, where they attend orientation
programs much like the initial one at
Bethlehem, but more specialized. Dur-
ing this period plant management
closely observes each looper’s apti-
tudes and interests, with the objective
of assigning him to the department or
job for which he appears to be best
ﬁtted, and corresponding as closely as
possible to his educational background
and work preferences.

Specialized Training—Loopers select-
ed for sales, mining, shipbuilding,
research, and the company's adminis-
trative departments, proceed from the
basic course to specialized training
programs varying according to the
type of work.

Preparing for Aa’oancement—As the
looper gains in ability, experience, and
knowledge, and as openings occur, he
is moved into positions of increasingly

greater responsibility. The company
expects and encourages the looper to
produce, to make steady progress.
Regular reports as to his work and
progress are made to department heads
—and annual reports to divisional
vice-presidents—throughout his career.

Emphasis on Technical Degrees —
Because of the nature of Bethlehem’s
activities, the greatest demand is for
men with technical degrees, especially
those in mechanical, metallurgical, in-
dustrial, electrical, chemical, civil, and
mining engineering.

Read Oar Boohlet—The eligibility
requirements for the Loop Course, as
well as a description of the way it
operates, are more fully covered in our
booklet, “Careers with Bethlehem Steel
and the Loop Course.” It will answer
many questions undergraduates may
have. Copies are available in most college
placement oﬂices, or may be obtained by
writing to Manager of Personnel, Beth-
lehem Steel Company, Bethlehem, Pa.

All qualiﬁed applicant: will receive comideration for employment without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin.

Bendix answers your questions

WHAT COMPANY 
SHOULD I JOIN?

When there is a choice of employment opportunities, most
graduating engineers and scientists make some sort of list of the
advantages offered by each prospective employer.

  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
   

Some men put salary at the top of the list. Many lean toward the
company offering them the best chance at creativity . . . the widest scope
for developing their interests and increasing their professional stature.
Others favor job security, company size and stability, or geographic
location. The ﬁnal choice generally is made on the basis of the
biggest “package” of advantages offered.

Probably no organization today can offer a longer list of
employment advantages than The Bendix Corporation.
One of the world’s most highly regarded, stable,
and diversiﬁed engineering-research—manu—
facturing corporations, Bendix has 25
divisions which produce, literally, “a
thousand diversiﬁed products.” The
wide geographic spread of these
divisions can be seen in the

listing below.

Starting salaries paid by Bendix are
competitive with those offered by
other companies—-naturally, better
talents are more highly rewarded.
Bendix readily recognizes achieve-
ment, and gives the developing
engineer and scientist wide lati-
tude in his ﬁeld of interest.

Ask your Placement Director
about Bendix—where you can
build your career to suit your
talents. If you can’t arrange a
personal interview, write to
C. C. Cleveland, The Bendix
Corporation, Fisher Building,
Detroit 2, Michigan, for

more details.
