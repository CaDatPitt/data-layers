Even though this BBS was only established in April of
this year, The Mother Board has become one of the most
popular BBSs in the Pittsburgh area. This system takes
on an interesting format as the Sysop takes on the role
of Mother and all of the system users are her children.
The message areas deal with many different subjects,
such as: THE MAILBOX, general messages, DEAR MOM,
an area where the users type in their problems and the
Sysop and users reply to them, and COMPUSEX, an adult
area. The Mother Board is a member of FidoNet and
usually transmits trans-BBS messages once a night. This
BBS has had a running game of What’s My Line (WML)
since last June.

When initially logging on to the Mother Board, you will
be asked for your first and last name. The BBS will then
search the user file and once it notices that you are not
on the file, it will address you as a new user. When first
registered with the Mother Board, you will have Regular
access. This allows you to access the three main message
areas of the board and the FidoNet. If you're 18 or older,
you can write a letter to the Sysop requesting regular
status. Like most BBS nationwide networks, you must
have an account registered with the sysop before sending
trans-BBS messages. All messages a user sends can be
either public or private.

And now for a BBS completely different...

Name of BBS: The Softworx TBBS
Phone No.: (412) 221-3564
Baud Rate: 300 only
Hours: Varies, usually about Monday-Friday 6:00 pm to
Midnight, 24 hourslday on Weekends.
Name of Sysop: Marcel J. Schmelzer
Location of BBS:
P.O. Box 12831
Pittsburgh, PA 15241
(Upper St. Clair)
Access Levels: 255 all together
Up/download Abilities: Capable of upward and downward
transfer of programs for most brands of home computer.
Nation-wide Network Linkage: TBBS Software (Bread
Board System)
Memory-Computer: TRS-80, 48K
-Other: Four 200K Floppy Disk Drives, One 5.0 M Hard
Disk

This BBS has an extensive message base and a whole
lot more. To initially use the Softworx, you must write a
letter to the Sysop at the above address. in a few days
you will get a letter containing your initial password and
an instruction book on how to use this BBS. This BBS has
a unique menu structure which makes it very flexible to
move from one operation to another. The themes of the
message areas are such as Technical, Science Fiction,
JokeIHumor, and individual messages for each major
brand of home computer. Access to all these areas are
controlled by a complex system of letting the user have
access to a certain amount of the data sections. One of
the most interesting sections of this BBS is the Software
Mail. Here users are able to send programs to each other
without them being stored through the Sysop.

Just what does it take to put together and run a BBS?
A person can usually start a BBS by having six essential
pieces of equipment: a phone line WITHOUT call waiting,
a home computer, an automodem, a display screen, a disk
drive, and the proper software. A printer is optional but
the author highly recommends one for its use. There are
various software packages available for running a BBS
with prices ranging from $50 to $300. An entire system
can be set up for as little as $350 or as extravagant as
$3000 for an extensive high memory system. Cost of
upkeep is usually minimal. Routinely, all that has to be
paid for is new storage disks and the utility bills. But
catastrophies can occur. This summer, the Mother Board
had its automodem blown up by a lightning storm ——
twice —— which resulted in costly replacements.

A Sysop should be well experienced in the computer
system he/she is using for a BBS. A knowledge of pro-
gramming is not necessary but is highly recommended
by the author. One other thing that is needed to run a suc-
cessful BBS is really twofold: time and imagination. A
Sysop may spend up to 15 hours a week working on the
BBS doing things such as: approving access levels , reply-
ing to Sysop mail, deleting old messages, refereeing or
playing in games, working out system bugs, and enforc-
ing system rules. Also, a Sysop could be considered a
Grand Master of a small circus. He/she brings attention
to the events going on, and helps with the organization
of present and future events.

...I keyed in for the next message. It read:

I replied to that message and a couple more. I shot a
few questions at the Mystery Guest this round. I also read
the latest messages left by other users. I learned about
how to properly guess a person ’s age and that Apple may
be coming out with a color screen Macintosh by the end
of the year. I then looked over at the clock and I felt like
the time — 2:16 a.m. I went up to the main menu and logg-
ed off. I then powered down my system and filed away
the disks in my trusty old shoe box. In the next ten minutes,
after saying my prayers, I dozed off thinking of what color
graphics would look like on a Macintosh.

sburgh area may be intentional.)

Operations

Research

by Laurel Jamieson

and Michael Udavchak

Operations Research (Management Science) is the
general name of the family of mathematical/statistical
techniques used by professional planners to guide them
in managing scarce resources effectively. industrial
engineers and other planners use these methods to find
a good and often the best way to choose complex system
parameters, such as locations and number of supply
depots, warehouses, visual displays in aircraft cockpits
and off-ramps on highways, or percentage of sand in
concrete.

Operations Research (OR) is commonly broken down
into sub-categories. This article attempts to give the reader
a taste for the flavor of OR by sharing the essence of some
of the subcategories, namely Optimization, Forecasting
and inventory Control.

Optimization

Finding the best answer to a problem is not always easy.
In Calculus, one learned how to find maximums and
minimums. The branch of Optimization OR that seeks to
describe processes in terms of mathematical equations
that can be optimized using Calculus and Differential
methods is titled Classical Methods. Because many dif-
ferential eqquations cannot be solved, Classical Methods
sometimes fail to produce results.

Mathematical Programming

Mathematical Programming is a relatively new group
of optimization methods. Major advancements were
achieved during World War II as the military learned to
calculate the optimal location for supply depots and other
military type things. These optimization techniques also
seek to describe processes or systems by using
mathematical equations or inequalities, but the techniques
of solving can be successfully applied to a much broader
spectrum of problems.

10

The word Programming in Mathematical Programming
does not mean “writing computer algorithms,” but rather,
choosing the best program or course of action. Computers
are used, however to do the number crunching inherent
in Mathematical Programming.

Linear Programming

An example of a Linear Programming problem is
presented below in a box. Linear Programming techniques
are used when the process of system can be described
using linear equations or inequalities.

The graphical method of solving the two dimensional
example presented can be thought of as a metaphor for
the higher dimensional problems. It can be shown that the
objective function will be optimized at a vertex (corner)
of the feasible polygon (2-D) polyhedron (3-D) or  if two
or more vertices yield the optimal value, then any linear
combination of their co-ordinates will also give an optimal
policy.

The sample presented is a very small problem. Imagine
the size and number of equations General Motors has to
write when they have scores of production lines, many
models of cars, each with thousands of component parts,
each with different supply schedules. Matrices in many
dimensions with thousands of elements are common. That
is when the power of Linear Programming becomes
apparent.

Other Techniques

Other Mathematical Programming techniques are Non-
Linear and Dynamic Programming. Non-Linear techniques
must be used when variables are interdependent or when
they occur raised to a power higher than one (X1 x X2 or
X12 ).

Sometimes a system or process to be described re-
quires integer inputs or solutions. Zenith cannot sell
2.7182 televisions or buy 3.1416 picture tubes. This is
when Integer Programming techniques are used to sup-
plement the other techniques.

Mathematical Programming is used to find optimal solu-
tions. Once these optimal solutions are found, valuable
information can be gained by studying how changes in
constants and coefficients alter the optimal policy. This
research technique is called Sensitivity Analysis.

Other Topics

Other topics in Operations Research include the ideas
of Forecasting and Inventory Control. These topics are
stressed in Manufacturing Engineering, which some
schools offer as an option in the Industrial Engineering
Department.

It is the opinion of this author that Pitt will have a
Manufacturing Engineering cirriculum available to its
students in the not too distant future. The above opinion
is a forecast.

Forcasting is the process of estimating future demands
in terms of quantity, quality, timing and location. The three
basic types of forecasting methodologies are: Predictive,
Casual and Time Series.

The Predictive method of forecasting is subjective. This
method is typically used when no historical data is
available. Thus, the data includes such items as surveys
and intuition.

The Casual method is often used by economists who
keep track of the leading indicators, the coincedetal in-
dicators, and the lagging indicators. For example, a
business may check into such items as consumer spend-

ing, liquid money, unemployement rates, the prime rate,
etc. before making a forecast for his decisions.

The Time Series method is used when historical data
is available. The components used in a time series
forecasting model include trend, cycle, seasonality and
random fluctuations.

In controlling inventory, one has to make three basic
decisions: How often to review, When should items be re-
ordered, and How many to re-order. However, these deci-
sions are not as simple as one may think. For example,
if one does not re-order parts until one runs out, then one
will not have any during the time it takes for the new parts
to arrive. This could cause losses in sales or lack of pro-
duction. On the other hand, if one orders too many too
soon, the money one spent on them sits and collects no
interest while the part sits in storage, consuming costly
space. Thus, a good inventory control system can save
a lot of money. One common inventory control system is
the economic order quantity (EOQ). A method that has
been found to be successful in Japan is the Kanban
system. (The details of these are beyond the scope of this
article, however, M3 will gladly discuss them with any in-
terested party.)

A classic, simple and very small Math Programming
case might go like this:

Mainak mixes sidewalk concrete and basement con-
crete. He, being a regular sort of guy, wants to make
as much profit from-his business as possible. Mainak
makes $S profit for each kilo of sidewalk concrete he
produces, and $B profit on each kilo of basement
concrete.

His profit is therefore:

P = $S x X1 + $8 x X2 let X1 and X2 be kilos of
sidewalk and basement concrete

If someone told Mainak, “Make an infinite amount of
each and you’ll make infinite profit!”, he would laugh
at them. “Life is never that easy my dear friend, I have
limits on how much I can produce with my finite time
and supplies.”

The profit equation is called the objective function.
The limits Mainak spoke of are called constraints. Here
are his constraints: Because of the tight market, he can
only get R kilos of rock dust and C kilos of cement a
week. He can only work H hours a week. He needs r1
kilos of rock dust and c1 kilos of cement for each kilo
of sidewalk concrete and r2 kilos of rock dust and c2
kilos of cement for each kilo of basement concrete.
Both concretes take h hours per kilo to measure and
mix.

Mixing Concrete
An Optimization Problem

Linear programming provides the method of optimiz-
ing Mainak’s operation. The constraints may be put into
inequalities as follows:

r1 x X1 + r2 x X2 less = Fl (only Fl kilos are available)
c1 x X1 + c2 x X2 less = C (only C kilos are available)
h x X1 + h x X2 less = H (only H hours are available)
X1 and X2 grtr=0 (cannot make -5 kilos)

Since this problem has only two variables (X1 and

X2), it can be presented graphically.

x2 objective function

Any point in the shaded area is a possible produc-

or points in the feasible region whose co-ordinates
make the objective function (profit equation) assume
the greatest value.

The Loss of a Professor

Dr. Albert G. Holzman, Professor and Chairman of
the Department of Industrial Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, died suddenly on Wednesday,
May 1, while attending a professional society meeting
in Boston.

Dr. Holzman, who was 63 years of age, was a native
of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where he worked as an
industrial analyst for Bethlehem Steel Corporation
prior to joining the University of Pittsburgh faculty in
1951. He was appointed department chairman in 1965
and, from 1965 to 1972, served also as a director of
engineering operations for the University's NASA
Technology Transfer Center.

As chairman, he built the Department of Industrial
Engineering to one of high national ranking and
became internationally known for his work in indus-
trial engineering and operations research.

In 1984 he was the first industrial engineer to be
elected as a member of the National Academy of Engi-
neering of the United States — the highest profes-
sional distinction that can be conferred on an
engineer.

He was a fellow of the Institute of Industrial Engl-
neers and also significantly involved in the activities of
the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technol-
ogy, the Operations Research Society of America,
Institute of Management Sciences, the American
Society for Engineering Education, and the honorary
societies Omega Rho and Alpha Pi Mu.

A registered professional engineer in the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, he was greatly respected by
the industrial community, and served as a consultant
to Westinghouse Electric Corporation, United States
Defense Intelligence Agency, Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Company, Climax Molybdenum Company, the
United States Steel Corporation and Maynard Man-
agement institute. He was a member of the Board of
Directors of On—Line Systems, Inc.

Dr. Holzman authored numerous publications in the
areas of multicriteria decision-making, information
systems for education, linear programming, non-
linear programming, and optimization theory.

He received his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from
the University of Pittsburgh. He was a member of St.
Bonaventure Church in Glenshaw.

The Freshman Office Changes

Some changes in the freshman department have
occurred. Dr. McCormick is now back in the EE depart-
ment, and Lori Shuff is the sole advisortothefreshman
class. Besides all that the freshmen office has done in
the past, they are taking on the recruitment of graduate
students, developing better relations with the alumni,
and creating an alumni network to obtain equipment
and funds. There is particular interest in developing
some co-ops and internships for undergraduates.

One internship that started this summer involved
lE’s, ME’s, and EE’s. Twelve juniors in these depart-
ments worked for Packard Electric, a division of GM,
on various projects this past summer. Now that they
are back in school, they will work with faculty advisors
and finish their projects as senior projects here at Pitt.
This is just one of the programs being developed to
give practical experience to engineering students.

Alumni Seek Good Health

The University of Pittsburgh’s Engineering Alumni
Association is sponsoring a Wellness Conference that will
be held on November 2, 1985 at 9 a.m. in Benedum
Auditorium.

Dr. Carroll Curtis, MD, the corporate medical director
at Westinghouse, and a faculty member from the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh will lead a team of experts that will pro-
vide helpful techniques regarding stress management,
nutrition, weight control, exercise and smoking cessation.

The recommendations and ideas resulting from the con-
ference may improve the lifestyles of students, employees,
and their respective families, as well as improving their
place of work.

Following the seminar, a luncheon will be served at the
University Club. During the luncheon, a Pitt football coach
will shed insight on the Pitt vs. Syracuse game that will
be played that afternoon.

Be there for a stimulating seminar, a great luncheon,
and a spectacular football game! Reservations can be
made with the University of Pittsburgh Engineering Alumni
Association, Gardener Steel Conference Center, Pitts-
burgh, Pa. 15260, attention: Sandra Klinzsing. The admis-
sion for the seminar is $2; the admission for the luncheon
and the football game are separate.

SWE Wins

The Society of Women Engineers(SWE) recently
won Best Student Section, which places Pitt’s chapter
in the top six chapters in the United States. To con-
tinue in the winning tradition, SWE has many new
ideas to incorporate new members and to add new
programs. Along with the yearly resume book, SWE
has tried to improve and expand its Big/Little Sister
Program.

The student chapter has also had contact with the
Pittsburgh section of SWE. A joint meeting is being
scheduled for October 23.

If anyone is interested in becoming a member, he or
she should stop by the SWE office on the ground floor
of Benedum. SWE holds its regular meetings Fridays at
noon, but you can still be involved with committees
that meet at other times if you can’t attend the general
meeting.

Freshmen Follow
National Trend

The freshmen class this year has 411 students. Pitt
followed the national trend this year with a decline in
the enrollment of women. Women compose only 16%
of this year’s freshman class.

Some freshmen of special recognition arethis year’s
Chancellor's Scholars — Ralph Jones and Lisa Steel.
Also of special recognition are this year's winners of
the Fessenden-Trott scholarships —— Robert Holmberg
and Deepak Boggavarapu.

PEP Program Continues

On October 12 the University sponsored the Pitt
Engineering Preview (PEP) Program. High School stu-
dents interested in engineering were invited, along
with parents and counselors, to a morning seminar.
Participants talked with faculty,visited labs, and saw
demonstrations related to their field of interest. The
program ended at the stadium with all the guests being
invited to the Pitt vs N. Carolina State Homecoming
game.

Summer Job Search Starts Now

by John C. Gargani

Believe it or not, now is the time to start thinking about
getting a summer job. Some interviews will be on cam-
pus as early as the beginning of October.

The best place to get a technical summer position is
through Pitt’s Employment Service located in the Student
Union (the Schenley Hotel for those like me who can
remember). By stopping there you will be informed as to
what must be done in order to facilitate the interviewing
process.

A short synopsis of what will occur is as follows. You’ll
be asked to set up an appointment to interview with one
of the counselors. At this interview you will be informed
as to how the job service is to be used, including resumes
and how to sign up for interviews.

Assuming that you have now had your counseling ses-
sion, and you have already signed up for an interview, it
is time to get ready for the interview. The best approach
is to be confident about yourself, and this can be done
by being prepared. Do at least some research on the com-
pany. You'd be surprised how much you can learn by ask-
ing a few questions of someone who had your desired job
the summer before. Also, wear your best clothes for the
interview and be as neat as possible because, believe me,
they do notice...

Congratulations! You now have your summer job! You
are ready for the real world, right? If you are lucky your
new position will put you in a geographical location that
you are familiar with. However, how many people know
anything about Kingfisher, Oklahoma, Pop. 4024? That's
where I spent my first summer.

15

Housing should be one of your primary concerns. As
soon as you know where you are going to be this sum-
mer, write to that city's Chamber of Commerce requesting
information on apartment buildings, dormitories and any
other information they may have. The Chamber will be
happy to help because they want you to like their town
and they want you to spend your money there. At least
you’ll have a few ideas of where to look in your new loca-
tion once you get there....

That was very smart getting to town a few days early
so you could look at a few apartments and pick out the
best one. I’m glad to hear you really love the area as well.
However, it is now time for your first day of work.

Relax... that’s much better.

There are two things to remember with any summer job.
They are going to ask many questions, and you must be
ready to work. The company that hired you wants you to
learn as much as possible and they do understand that
you probably know very little about what you're doing. The
best way to remedy this situation is to ask a question
whenever you come across something that you don't
understand. The best way to turn off your employer is to
come off as lazy, so work as hard as you can while you
are asking those questions. It will probably take about a
week to really know what is expected of you. Listen
carefully to everything, and it's guaranteed you’ll be a
working machine within a short while!

Boy, that summer went by really fast didn’t it? Well,
school is going to be a little tougher this year, but you sur-
vived last year and you’ll get through it again. You'd bet-
ter start looking for a summer job for next year, but this
year you’ll have that summer job to add to your resume.

French Fry Factory

If you are one of the many people on campus who
develops an insatiable urge for crisp delicious fries
whenever study time rolls around, then the French Fry
Factory may just be the place for you. The French Fry Fac-
tory opened in mid-June of this year, and is conveniently
located at 117 Oakland Avenue. The menu includes a
variety of items but the specialty is, as you might guess,
french fries. Any employee is quick to let you know: “we
have the best fries in Oak|and!,” but the end result speaks
for itself. From their beginnings as unskinned Idaho
potatoes the fries are cooked in fresh peanut oil, and after
a touch of salt they are really delicious. There is a wide
variety of toppings available ranging from sweet ’n sour
to chili and cheese. The-prices are competitive with other
local restaurants, with a large fry costing $1.49 and a small
$1.29. As for the toppings, they range from 10 cents to
50 cents extra. I myself tried a large order topped with
nacho cheese and thoroughly enjoyed them.

The Oakland restaurant is actually a member of the
French Fry Factory franchise, with other stores located
at l.U.P. and the Century lll Mall. After a slow start in June,
business has continually increased since the start of
classes. As you might expect, the service was prompt and
friendly, and the atmosphere was casual. Due to a limited
amount of space, however, the only dining space available
is stand up counters. in addition to french fries, other items
such as baked potatoes, burgers and specialty sand-
wiches are available. The prices of these items are also
quite comparable to other fast food restaurants. As for the
hours of operation, the store is open from 10 a.m. to 10
p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Satur-
day and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday.

If you’re tired of the same old places and you’re looking
for something new, then take a walk over to Oakland
Avenue and give the French Fry Factory a try. You'll be
glad you did.

Peppi’s

Located at 210 Oakland Avenue, Peppi’s is Oakland’s
newest “Old Tyme Sandwich Shop." Peppi’s has been
in Pittsburgh for three years but until this past summer
was located only near the Allegheny Community College
Campus on the North Side. The third week in June saw
the grand opening of Peppi’s in Oakland, and in August
another appeared in the Strip District.

Peppi’s specialty is the steak sandwich; of which the
menu includes nine varieties. For those from Philadelphia,
there is the South Philly Special and then there is the Piz-
za Steak for the portion of the population whose tastes
are Italian. Peppi’s also serves hot sausage sandwiches
and burgers for those full-blooded Americans who dare
not venture from the norm.

All sandwiches are made right in front of the customer,
so if something falls to the floor, the customer knows it.
None of the food can be considered “fast food” for each
sandwich gets individual attention and is made to order
for everybody.

Jim Trebac, the proprietor of Peppi’s, gives personal-
ized attention to each store. He knows regular customers
by name and deals directly with all of his employees. Mr.
Trebac’s intent for Peppi’s was to create a college at-
mosphere, where he can sell “very good sandwiches at
a reasonable price.” Almost all of his employees are col-
lege students. The dining area even includes a blackboard
and chalk where customers can write whatever comes to
mind. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed.

Peppi’s has gained notoriety in Pittsburgh over the past
three years. Franco Harris is one of Peppi’s investors and
Mr. Trebac talks of plans of Franco doing advertisrhents
for Peppi’s. Evening Magazine called Peppi’s “Pittsburgh
Number One Sandwich Shop.” But the best notoriety Pep-
pi’s can have comes from its customers. So come on
down to Peppi’s, leave your mark on the blackboard and
enjoy Pittsburgh's finest sandwiches.

From the editor

/\

Well, here it is... The first Skyscraper with yours truly
at the helm. Actually, there are many new faces on the
staff this year, and this is a year of change for the
magazine. A brief history of Skyscraper describes how the
magazine has developed into what it is today.

Skyscraper Engineer was established in the early 50’s.
During this time, the magazine was very successful, but
later on in the 70's, a lack of interest among the engineer-
ing students forced publication to stop.

About four years "ago, however, a group of students
became interested in starting up the magazine again.
They organized into a staff and eventually produced a
short magazine in January of 1982. Since then, the quality
of the magazine has continuously increased.

And so now I’m in charge. As I said, this is a year of
change for Skyscraper. We have a much larger staff made
up of great people, and we are all working to get
everything done as efficiently and as well as possible.

Another important part of the Skyscraper story is that
we are now an associate member of Engineering College
Magazines Associated. ECMA is an organization of
magazines from across the country. They promote ex-
cellence in engineering college journalism through
seminars, awards, and through the exchange of
magazines between members.

Although there are changes occuring with the
magazine, one thing remains the same. Skyscraper
Engineer is here for you. We try to address issues and
include subjects that are of interest and use to the
engineering students at Pitt. We welcome comments, let-
ters to the editor, articles, photos, and artwork for prin-
ting. Any input you have to offer will be accepted in the
ESC office, 125 BEH.

So grab a hot cup of coffee, kick off your shoes, relax
and enjoy the magazine! _

Oh, by the way... lwould like to thank Mike Udavchak
( M3), author of Skycaper for the past three years, for the
tremendous amount of help he has provided me in the
early part of my collegiate career. It was he who initially
got me involved with Skyscraper Engineer and suggested
that I become editor. I am both glad and proud to have
M3 as a friend. (He told me to write this, of course.)

by Maurice Rickard

Author’s note: Bed Magnetology is a relatively new field,
with most of its leading researchers yet to publish their
theses, due to unforseen circumstances. As a result, it is
difficult to obtain enough numerical date to project the im-
age of knowledgeabi/ity. Hey, I tried my best.

By the angle of the sun over the southern horizon, I can

see that we are at the beginning of a whole new term. This”

means that it’s the perfect time to tell you about some-
thing that has concerned me for quite some time now,
Yes, that's right. I’m talking about bed magnets.

The phenomenon of bed magnets seems to have been
with us since time immemorial, or at least most of my life.
Anyone can be plagued by problem bed magnets: Pat Sa-
jak, Richard Feynman, Foge Fazio, President Reagan,
even you.

Perhaps you've noticed that, as each term goes on, it
becomes harder and harder to get out of bed in the morn-
ing. The alarm goes off, you roll over, shut it off, think “five
more minutes,” and go back to sleep. indeed, you might
never get up unless your roommate or bed partner hits
you over the head repeatedly as an incentive. If you live
alone, you may not wake up for hours, if at all.

Maybe you’ve been sitting upright, studying on your
bed, then decide to get a little more relaxed, first by
slouching a little, then by assuming a reclining position,
then a horizontal position, then, finally, you fall asleep.

Most of you have probably just attributed these sorts
of occurrences to fatigue or just plain laziness, but a re-
cent study conducted right here at Pitt has revealed a
whole new reason for these phenomena: the existence
of bed magnets.

This phenomenon was first brought to the attention of
the Engineering department six months ago when one of
its most prominent professors was found to have been
missing for a period of 4.3 days. An extensive police
search of the Oakland area found him at home in bed,
deep in REM sleep. Further investigation revealed that
he had been asleep for the entirety of the 4.3 day period.
Five hours and fifty-two minutes after the police removed
him from his home, he woke up, unable to account for the
missing time.

It was at this point that Dr. Guido von Hudson, univer-
sity psychologist and part-time nuclear physicist, was call-
ed in. He immediately suggested an experiment involving
the large particle accelerator in the Nuclear Physics lab,
the bed in question, and the unfortunate professor’s brain.

First, the professor was seated between the two large
accelerators, with his mattress 13.9 meters away,
screened by a lead shield. A sample of radioactive thorium
was placed securely in the professor’s mouth and bom-
barded with beta particles for 17.2 minutes, which is, coin-
cidentally, just long enough to heat up a coffee pot placed
behind the professor’s head. Measurements conducted
on the sample and the professor’s head revealed nothing
unusual. Then, the professor, the thorium sample still in
his mouth, was seated upon his mattress for another bom-
bardment. Strangely enough, this time, the thorium sam-
ple was shown to be composed of cheese and moving at
a speed of 57.362 km/h in four unspecified directions at
once. Even more surprising was the effect of the mattress
on the professor’s head. 2.7 seconds after he was plac-
ed on the mattress, the professor’s brain began to emit
stage four alpha waves, which usually occur immediately
before REM sleep. Clearly, the mattress was affecting the
professor’s brain.

Dr. von Hudson substituted twenty other mattresses for
the professor’s, and found the same effect, albeit to a
lesser degree, with 45 percent of them. It was then that
Dr. von Hudson thought to look for a cause inside the of-
fending mattresses.

He decided to conduct this dissection in a specially
sealed room deep below Benedum Hall. Assisting in the
procedure were a number of representatives of the univer-
sity’s research commmunity. The senior members of the
Skyscraper staff, always finding new ways to avoid poten-
tial personal danger to themselves, sent me along as an
observer. The professor’s mattress was cut open, initial-
ly revealing nothing more than normal 100 percent
polyester filling. Bured in the exact geometric center of
the mattress, however, was a magnet measuring
2’ x 4’ x 3”. Once the magnet was removed from the mat-
tress, the strength of its field became noticeable, but was,
unfortunately, unmeasurable. Dr. von Hudson is current-
ly applying for a government grant to cover the expense
of developing a means to measure the strength of a bed
magnet’s field. For the moment, however, Dr. von Hud-
son is certain that the field of the bed magnet observed
had a magnitude of F. The research team was able to stay
awake by turning on the huge electromagnet circling the
lab, polarized 180° opposite to the bed magnet, cancell-
ing its effect.

The magnet itself appeared to be composed of iron,
although spectrographic analysis proved that it was made
of a 60-40 percent compound of polyester and

magnesium. The fact that magnesium is not known for
its magnetic properties means that the magnetic part must
be originating with the polyester. This in itself was stag-
gering and two of the research scientists had to be revived
by mouth-to-mouth administered by a group of Golden
Girls. I found this also quite staggering, but I was only
splashed with cold water (total dissolved solids = 505
ppm., temperature: 15° Celcius).

The research team was unable to explain the presence
of the magnesium or the development of the magnet, but
was able to come up with a dandy thesis that should en-
courage further investigation and, as a result, further fun-
ding. The thesis is something like this: Over a period of
time, some mattresses, usually the less expensive ones
(although no mattresses are safe from this condition), grow
a number of magnets during their operational lives. These
magnets upset the electrochemistry of the human brain
in such a way that, within a short time of exposure to the
magnetic field, the brain emits stage I alpha waves. Fur-
ther exposure brings the brain closer and closer to the
dream state.

This could change our entire way of thinking about elec-
tromagnetism and biology, let alone cheap mattresses.

The known history of bed magnets is somewhat limited,
seeing how this is the only published record of them. I was,
however, able to obtain some irrelevant but nonetheless
very entertaining government documents under the
Freedom of Information Act that put me in the proper
mood to fabricate the rest of the bed magnet’s history.

It would seem at first glance that these bed magnets
have appeared out of nowhere, perhaps provoked by our
modern technological society, perhaps by weasel killings
in the paper mill upstream. This is, in effect, correct. This
phenomenon has been documented in a number of
movies and TV shows, which didn't really exist before this
century. ’

Current scientific theory states that, as long as no one
sleeps on them, thereby depleting them of the kind of brain
waves they need most, the bed magnets will cause no
harm. It is very nice of the scientific theorists to tell us this,
but, as I was able to discover, every last one of the scien-
tific theorists who say this sleep on waterbeds, where bed
magnets rarely, if ever, form. These scientific theorists are
really going to get theirs one day, if I have anything to do
with it.

The fact remains that this problem is becoming more
serious by the minute. Some mattresses on campus have
grown magnets of tremendous strength. There is one case
in McCormick Hall of a bed magnet so powerful that it
literally pulls people onto it from great distances and keeps
them there. No way has been found to remove it, because
all the people sent to take care of the problem are now
asleep. The magnet is believed to be growing larger, and
by 1987, all the residents of McCormick will be deep in
a seemingly permanent REM sleep. It has been theorized
that, by 1992, the entire Schenley Quad area will be ir-
reversibly unconscious. My roommate says he looks for-
ward to this, but I believe this will cause more problems
than it will solve: lines in the Book Center will never ad-
vance again, for example.

The impact on the individual is also quite thought-
provoking. My roommate has spent 57 percent of his adult

waking life asleep. His bed magnet must be awfully strong.

One of my friends has his roommate, who presumably,
has no bed magnets, administer house current to my
friend’s lower abdominal region every 5.2 seconds until
he gets up. It would seem that the bed magnets are
radically affecting our minds. Is there no solution to this
menace?

I am proud to say that as a result of my research into
this phenomenon, I came upon what may be an effective,
if temporary, solution. One person I talked to says that
as the term goes on he finds it easier to get out of bed.
Maybe his mattress is upside down. This would mean that,
if you have a bed magnet and are not asleep right now,
you may be able to stave off the inevitable by turning your
mattress over. The only problem with this is that soon the
phenomenon would swing the other way and no one would
be able to sleep. Then the incredible surplus of free time
might drive people to other extremes. Which extreme is
better? Who can say? My roommate says he knows, but
he's lying down right now and his eyes are shut. Dr. von
Hudson tells me that he is having trouble fitting the beatific
smiles of the magnetized into his equations, so it would
seem that further research is required to resolve this
dilemma. If you will excuse me, I think I’m going to col-
lect some more data now

Leisurelu Log Ons

by Stephen R. Sabram

It was a hot Monday night. I walked into my room and
turned on the TV set, disk drive, and of course, stereo. I
then opened up my desk drawer and removed the modem
contained inside. I plugged the modem into the back of
my computer and turned them both on. The disk drive whir-
red for a second and the black and white chaos that was
previously my screen was now a light blue screen display-
ing a single work —— READY. I stepped over to another
part of my room, opened a shoebox that was beneath my
bed, and started paging through 5% ” floppy disks of
various brands until I found the program I needed. I walk-
ed back to my computer set-up and sat down in an old,
comfortable, office chair in front of it all. I opened the door
of my disk drive, slipped in the disk I had acquired, closed
the door and moved to my keyboard. There I typed LOAD
“TERMINAL”, 8, 1 and hit RETURN.

The cursor disappeared from the screen and the disk
drive started a frantic whirr. I then waited. An old Billy Joel
song played in the background. After about a minute, the
familar READY accompanied by a flashing cursor ap-
peared again. I then typed RUN and hit RETURN. The
previously light blue screen was now grey with black text
displaying * *DA TA CARRIER LOST* *.

Knowing that my end of the network was ready, I reach-
ed into the same drawer from which Igot my modem and
picked several sheets of paper with one word names and
phone numbers listed on them. As I read these sheets, I
thought to myself, “HMMMMMM. I wonder which boards
are open at this hour.” Thinking on that, I decided upon
a number, reached for my phone and dialed it. Busy. I tried
another one. After a single ring, I started to hear that familar
high pitched squeal of a data carrier signal. I detached the
phone ’s plug that stuck into the receiver and plugged that
into the back of the modem. Then I struck RETURN on the
keyboard.

Text started to scroll onto my screen at the familar rate
of about forty characters a second. The screen read,
“WELCOME TO THE MO... ” I hit CTRL-C to skip the rest
of the introduction that I was already familiar with and didn ’t
want to read again. The computer thatl was now in com-
munication with printed the following on my screen:

YOUR FIRST NAME:

I entered it and hit RETURN.

It then replied with, YOUR LAST NAME:
I entered that also.

After a few seconds of waiting as the board searched
to find my access, it finally printed, PASSWORD:. I typed
that in while asterisks appeared on my screen instead of
the letters. Immediately after that, it printed * *PA SSWORD
VER/FIED**. I was now on-/ine. I then switched to the
message section of the board and instructed the computer
to search for any new mail addressed to me since my last
/ogon. Since it usually took a minute or so for the computer
to search for my mail, I sat back and thought to myself,
“I wonder ifl got any mail on programmable calculators. ”

A few seconds later, the board indicated that there was
indeed some new mail for me, accompanied with a string
of message numbers for me to page. I moved to the
reading mode and read my first piece of mail. It said:

DEAR STEVE,

IF YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND
AROUND $70.00 TO $100.00 FOR A PRO-
GRAMMABLE CALCULATOR, I MUST RECOM-
MEND THE H .... ..

The above simulation is a self-description of some of
the times I spent this summer using my home computer
and telephone to logon to the various computer bulletin
board systems (BBSs for short) in the Pittsburgh area.
With the increase in affordability of home computers and
its complementing equipment, a lot of home computer
hobbiests across the country have set up their own in-
dividual local BBSs. Unlike other commercial recreational
computer systems (Copuserve, The Source) the only thing
you have to pay for is the electricity and phone service!
Some of the operators of these BBSs have set up nation-
wide communication networks for the transfer of programs
and messages. This service does cost the user money due
to the expense of long distance phone calls. This article
will deal with the introduction of a BBS, a review of two
local BBSS in the Pittsburgh Area, and the technical
details of running a BBS.

The end of the above narration shows you an example
of accessing the centerpiece of almost every BBS: the

message base. Here you can read messages left by other
users, the system operator (Sysop), or yourself. Unlike
larger mainframe computer systems, a BBS can only have
one user logon at a time. Thus, all you can directly com-
municate with is the computer and software that form the
BBS, and the Sysop, if he/she is around. Typically, a
message section is broken up into different areas with
each area having a specific theme. This could be anything
from a specific age group, or computer programming, to
advice columns, music, science fiction,‘adult’ subjects,
or just about anything else. Your ability to transfer from
one message area to another is dependent upon which
BBS you are on and your access level. My younger brother
once described the message section of a BBS as a “com-
puterized pen pal system” and in a way, it is. Over the
summer, I have ‘conversed’ with people through the BBSs
in the Pittsburgh area. I ended up finding that two of these
people I wrote messages to are freshmen here at Pitt. We'
got to know each other as much as you can through com-
puterized correspondence and eventually managed to
meet on campus. All of this was done without a single
word spoken or us seeing each other. One user this sum-
mer was able to organize a science fiction club and have
an initial meeting place established all through the use
of Pittsburgh's local BBSs. I once had a little trouble with
programming my computer this summer. I decided to write
a message in one of the local BBSs about my problem
and did. Within three days, I got replies from those who
had solved similar problems and their advice helped me
out a lot.

BBSs usually have its users play games. On one local
BBSs (The Mother Board, see below) has a running game
of What's My Line? One user gets to be the Mystery Guest
and all of the other users ask the guest yes/no questions
until someone gets the famous person identity that the
user has taken on. The winner gets to be the next Mystery
Guest and so on. There are also write-on stories. One user
starts an unfinished story and expects another user to con-
tinue it. This often leads to interesting or often funny
results. Rarely are these stories finished. They just die off.

....LET ME KNOW WHICH CHOICE OF
CALCULATOR YOU MAKE.

“Well, that’s a nice piece of advice!”, I thought to myself.
/instructed the computer to display the next letter. It read:

HEY STEPHEN!

I JUST GOT DONE WITH A NEW
MODIFICATION ON THE ‘HAMSTER’ PRO-
GRAM WE DID LAST MONTH. I HAVE A VER-
SION UPLOADED ON THIS BOARD FOR YOU.

Right after reading that message, I moved up to the main
menu and down into the Program Transfer section. After
I cued the BBS for a download, it replied with, ENTER
NAME OF PROGRAM TO DOWNLOAD. I typed in
HAMSTER and hit RETURN.

PLACE DISK TO STORE PROGRAM IN DISK DRIVE,
THEN HIT/RETURN/, displayed the text on my TV screen.
So I replaced the disk in my drive with the one I usually
use to download. Right after I hit RETURN, the disk drive ’s
red light turned on and I heard that familar whir of my disk
drive. After five minutes, Ihad the new HAMSTER on my
disk. I moved back to the message section to read the rest
of my mail.

Another aspect that a good amount of BBSs have is the
ability to transfer programs through the phone network.
Sending a program to a BBS is called uploading, while
receiving programs from a BBS or any other network is
called downloading. When programs are transferred, they
can only run on one type of home computer system (i.e.
Commodore, Atari, Apple, IBM, etc.). Typically a single
BBS is only capable of transferring programs for one type
of computer system. There are exceptions, though (see
below). When a program is being transferred, the path
usually is from the disk drive to home computer, to
modem, to telephone network, to BBS. The direction of
the path is dependent upon whether the network is
uploading or downloading. When involved in transferring
programs on a BBS, users should make it a habit to try
to upload one program for every three that is download-
ed. These programs could be acquired through other
BBSs or ones that you write yourself. This is the recom-
mendation of the author. Remember, there is another
human being ultimately on the other side of the phone.
Don’t be rude.

With the introduction of a BBS concluded, I present the
following reviews of two local public BBSs in the Pittsburgh
