At the time this issue went to press, no announcement was
released other than that the committee appointed by the Founders’
Societies have recommended that Pittsburgh be chosen as the New
Engineering Capital of the World.

What will this mean to the engineering student who study
in our city? We will be in close contact withmen who are out-
standing in their fields and who are deeply interested in the ad- . .
vancement of engineering education. We will be able to work e  
directly with our national offices as far as our seminar program
goes. We will be able to improve a somewhat horrible use of
the seminar hour and make it interesting and informative to the
student who would much rather be eating his lunch and often
times is doing just that. We would be able to plug up that leak
in enthusiasm that seems to hit an engineer when he knows that
his seminar program is going to be another series of “join this”,
“come to that and “buy this;” an engineer wants to make his own
decisions and not be high pressured into joining, buying, or go-
ing to anything. The Founders’ Societies being in the city and
their men visiting or speaking at a seminar without saying that
you aren't much of an engineer if you don't belong to our society,
could increase enrollment in those societies ten times more than
a professor standing up and lecturing for an hour about how
wonderful it is to be a member. We know that the purposes are
good but we don’t like to be high pressured into anything.

Now that we have had o-ur little say about seminars and life
at school, lets look at the western migration of the Founders’
Societies from a different point of view. What will they do for
Pittsburgh? Will they help us to eliminate our parking problems?
Will they help us to work out the transit situation? Will they
help us to repair our roads and alleviate our traffic problems?
These things are basic fundamentals of civil engineering. Can
you think of anyone better qualified to answer these problems
than a civil engineer? We would have a group of the finest en-
gineers in the country coming to Pittsburgh periodically to visit
and to do business.

They would bring new business to our city and business means
tax money to be used to improve the situations mentioned above.

The resettlement of the Founders’ Societies is not certain as
yet but if they do move it would be a shot in the arm to Pittsburgh
and to us as engineering students.

FROM COW-PATHS TO CI.OVERI.EAFS . . .

The narrow, twisting, rut-ridden roads of yesteryear
are being replaced by new multi-lane, high-speed
highways. Crossroads have been bridged and clover-'
leafed . . . hills have been leveled . . . curves lengthened.

These changes have happened in the half century
since the advent of the automobile. For more and
better cars and trucks demand faster, safer roads
and turnpikes.

SPACE FOR SPEED . ..

The traffic that flows over America’s three-million
mile network of roads represents the very life stream
of our progress. Nowhere else in the world do people
travel so far and so freely . . . nor do so many trucks
deliver such a wide and plentiful supply of merchan-
dise so fast and to so many places.

AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT...

Here in America we have men who dare to dream and
build for future needs . . . machines to move moun-
tains . . . materials to make roads . . . and an all-seeing,
all-hearing, and reporting Inter-Communications
System that acquaints every branch of science and
engineering . . . every technical skill . . . with the
needs and the accomplishments of every other ﬁeld
of endeavor.

THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM...

Complete communication is the function, the unique

contribution of the American business press . . . a
great group of specially edited magazines devoted to
the specialized work areas of men who want to
manage better, research better, sell better, buy better.

COMMUNICATION IS OUR BUSINESS...

Many of the textbooks in which you are now study-
ing the fundamentals of your specialty bear the
McGraw-Hill imprint. For McGraw-Hill is the
World’s largest publisher of scientiﬁc and technical
Works.

After you leave school, you will want to keep
abreast of developments in your chosen profession.
Then one of McGraw-Hil1’s many business magazines
will provide current information that will help you
in your job.

1955—Solving complex engineering problems with Boeing computer

The best research facilities are behind Boeing engineers

The Boeing—designed electronic comput-
ers shown above solve in seconds prob-
lems that once required weeks—typical
of the advanced “tools” that help Boeing
engineers stay at the head of their ﬁeld.

Boeing engineers enjoy such other ad-
vantages as the world’s fastest, most
versatile privately owned wind tunnel,
and the new Flight Test Center—the
largest installation of its kind in the coun-
try. This new Boeing Center includes
the latest electronic data reduction equip-
ment, instrumentation laboratories, and
a chamber that simulates altitudes up to
100,000 feet. Structural and metallurgi-
cal research at Boeing deals with the heat
and strain problems of supersonic flight.
Boeing electrical and electronics labora-
tories are engaged in the development of

automatic control systems for both
manned and pilotless aircraft. Other
facilities include hydraulic, mechanical,
radiation, acoustics, and rocket and ram-
jet power laboratories.

Out of this exceptional research back-
ground engineers have developed such
trend—setting aircraft as America's first jet
transport, and the jet age’s outstanding
bombers, the B-47 and B-52. Research
means growth—and career progress. To-
day Boeing employs more engineers than
even at the peak of World War II. As
the chart shows, 46% of them have been
here 5 or more years; 25% for 10, and
6% for 15.

Boeing promotes from within and
holds regular merit reviews to assure
individual recognition. Engineers are

Although it is not yet a fact, Pittsburgh came one
step closer to being selected at the home of the nation-
al engineering headquarters.. The five former presi-
dents of the Founders’ Societies voted unanimously
to locate the headquarters here. This group const1-
tuted an executive committee which was originally
appointed to make the selection. However, it remains
for the respective trustees of each Society to ratify
the decision.

There will be dissenting votes among the trustees
but Pittsburgh stands a good chance of getting the
headquarters in the end. If and when this decision is
finally made, the next problem will be to select one
of the seven sites for the construction of the new
building. Although there is one site in the Point or
Gateway Center area and three sites offered in the
Downtown civic center (or Lower Hill Development),
it is not impossible that the Societies will ultimately
select a site in the Oakland or University area.

One of the mistakes made by those who speculated
on the possibility of the headquarters coming to Pitts-
burgh was to assume that we did not have a chance
because we lacked entertainment, night clubs, etc.
on the scale available in New York or Chicago. It
may come as a surprise to some that this was never
a strong factor because the engineers were selecting
a place to work — not play. Conventions will still be
held in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Fran-
cisco, etc. The Societies are run by committees work-
ing in the headquarters and the committee members
are centered around Pittsburgh.

The three Oakland sites shown in the sketch show
the many advantages of locating near the University
area. The University area offers a central location be-

tween business offices, research laboratories, technol-
ogical libraries, two engineering schools, a central
heating plant, and various home sites.

It is not impossible that the site at the entrance to
Schenley park ultimately will be selected. If so, there
is plenty of room for inviting the American Chemical
Society, the American Society for Testing Materials,
the American Iron and Steel Institute, and many
other societies to join with the Founders’ Societies in
their headquarters. Also, a six-story parking garage
may be easily incorporated with the new building
without excavation if it is located there.

Pitt played a good part in making the Oakland
sites available and the location of the engineering
headquarters in Oakland will be a great boost to the
Schools of Engineeering and Mines in many small
but definite ways.

Robert L. Land, Jr., Class of ’SI,

speaks from experience when he says,

U.S. Steel offers thorough training . . .
exposes the graduate engineer to many
interesting phases of the steel industry

ROBERT L. LAND, JR., graduated with a

B.S. in Chemical Engineering in Febru-
ary 1951. He had previously been inter-
viewed by U.S. Steel college recruitment
representatives and had been offered a job.
He began working in the Coke Plant at the
Gary, Indiana Works of U.S. Steel immedi-
ately after graduation.

After extensive training and several pro-
motions, Bob was made General Heater
Foreman on November 1, 1954. This ex-
ceedingly important job makes him re-
sponsible for the proper heating and the
quality of all coke produced at the Gary
Works——the second largest coke plant in
the world—with 16 batteries of coke ovens
producing 15,000 tons daily. He has a crew
of 60 and 8 foremen working under him.

Bob feels that U.S. Steel really gets the
young graduate engineer off to a good start

with a well-planned and complete training
program. He says, “US. Steel offers the
graduate engineer an excellent chance to
work in a number of different ﬁelds.”

This enables the graduate who has not
decided on his exact ﬁeld to look around
the big steel industry from within and to
ﬁnd the type of work that suits him best.
After a man is given the chance to really
ﬁnd himself and has been adequately
trained, “U.S. Steel oﬁers security and an
unlimited possibility of advancement pro-

On a warm summer day during the Korean War,

a flight of Skyraider bombers was just returning from
a mission over Korea. As the last bomber landed on
the carrier deck, a bomb broke loose from its sus-
pension device, hit the deck and exploded. Cost —
two killed, 15 injured and a gaping hole in the flight
deck. Although this bomb could not be released over
the target area, when the plane was brought to a
rapid standstill on the deck, the bomb was jarred
loose.

This kind of tragedy is just what one of the less
publicized parts of the University of Pittsburgh, the
Engineering Research Division, is helping to prevent.
The Engineering Research Division, was established
in the early part of World War II to conduct research
investigations in various fields. Some of the first work
done was through contracts from the Armed Forces.
At the end of the War, most of the contracts with the
Armed Forces were terminated, but research con-
tracts were obtained from local industries. Then, at
the beginning of the “Korean Police Action” in 1951,
the Naval Bureau of Aeronautics requested that the
University of Pittsburgh run production qualification

tests on bomb suspension equipment. At the termin-
ation of this contract with the Navy, new contracts
were negotiated so that this Division is still testing
such equipment.

The items to be tested we-re originally designed and
developed by the Navy to conform to certain stand-
ards dictated by the conditions under which such
items would be used. After the item had been refined
to a point where it met the applicable specifications
and could be produced at a reasonable cost, contracts
are let out to various manufacturers for the produc-
tion of the item, a condition being that a number of
these items must pass certain qualifying tests specified
by the Navy. The number of these items to be tested
was statistically determined from the conditio-ns of
production and other physical variables so that these
samples would give a true overall representation of
the lot being produced. The samples are selected
at random by a Naval Inspector at the production
facility and sent to the Engineering Research Division
(ERD) for testing

The Navy supplies the specifications that state
which tests are to be run, how they are to be run,
and what constitutes a failure. The Navy does not
specify or even describe any fixture to be used to run
these tests so that there is plenty of opportunity for
engineering aptitude and know-how in the design and
development of the testing fixtures themselves.

Each of the tests specified by th Navy simulates to
a certain extent at least one condition under which
the items will operate in actual use. One such test
is the salt spray test, in which the item is subjected
to a fine spray of salt water for a specified length of
time after which a functional test is run on the item
to determine whether or not it will still operate. This
simulates the use of the item on a win.d whipped ocean.

Other tests are the service life test, in which the

item is functionally operated for a prescribed number »

of cycles to determine its service life; lag tests, in
which the time for the item to release is measured;
overload and destructive load tests in which the yield
and ultimate loads are applied to the item; overload
(hi - g) release tests which determine whether an item
Wlll release a load much greater than normally ap-
plied.

(_)ne of the more elaborate tests is the shock test in
which the item with its normal load applied is given
a sudden deceleration in each of its major axes as

prescribed by the specifications. This simulates a con-
dition comparable to when a plane lands on a carrier
deck and is suddenly stopped during an arrestation,
or when a plane makes a sudden turn or le-vels off
from a power dive. Each of these cases involves a
sudden deceleration loading in some direction on the
test item. At present, three shock tests are in working
order. One is a small rig which will apply a sudden
deceleration of as high as 1,000 G’s for short intervals
to the items of one to ten pounds. Another rig is one
which will handle loads up to 500 pounds and apply
a loading as high as 50 G's for five milliseconds. Oui
largest shock rig will handle any item and its assoc-
iated loads of from 100 pounds to 4000 pounds and
will consistantly give leadings of from two G's for 60
milliseconds to 15 G’s for ten milliseconds.

he same instrumentation is used for all of these
tests. This instrumentation consists of an assortment
of unbounded resistance wire strain gage accelero-
meters with full scale ranges from ten to 750 G’s, a
four channel carrier amplifier and either a recording
oscillograph or more immediate results, two polaroid
camera equipped oscilloscopes. With such an ar-
rangement it is possible to mount accelerometers at
four critical positions on either the test rig or the

load and to record individually the decelerations at
these positions. All of these shock rigs and the instru-
mentation setups were designed and developed by the
Engineering Research Division.

Another interesting facet of the testing done is the
vibration test. Since vibration cannot be completely
eliminated from a machine as large as an airplane,
it becomes very important that the test items be oper-
ative under conditions of vibration expected to be
encountered in actual use. Several vibration systems
were designed employing electric vibration heads.
One system serves for both longitudinal and lateral
directions of vibration,while the other serves for the
vertical direction. The amplitude obtainable from
each of these systems is dependent upon the natural
frequency of the system. The most versatile and ef-
ficient of these is a free-free beam. It consists of a
steel slab two inches thick by 12 inches wide by seven
feet long freely supported at two points. It is excited
at one end by a vibration exciter and the item, loaded
or unloaded, is placed in the middle. With this ar-
rangement it is quite possible to get amplitudes of
1/2” at 50 cps. The specified amplitude is only 1/16"
at that frequency.

item is in the middle of the free-free-beam.

Young enough to be thinking of tomorrow to-
day and old enough to be backed by fifty five years
of solid know-how, Crucible Steel Company of Amer-
ica is a world leader in the production of special
purpose steels.

Organized in 1900, the Company takes its name
from the method by which fine tools and alloy steels
were made until after the turn of this century. The
method, called crucible melting, was invented in
1740 in Sheffield, England.

Iron, selected scrap, and various alloy elements such"

as nickel, silicon, maganese, and chromium were care-
fully measured into small ceramic containers called
crucible pots. The pots were capped and placed side
by side in a furnace pit where the metals were fused
and melted into steel. Then in an action wonderful
to watch but back—breaking to do, one workman, cal-
led a “puller-out”, reached into the pit with long
tongs, gripped the white-hot 100 pound pot of molten
steel and in a continuous motion passed the load-
bearing tongs to a “teemer” who poured the metal
into a ladle or ingot. Fortunately, modern steel-
making techniques have done away with the need for
that kind or heavy labor.

The formation of Crucible Steel Company of Amer-
ica in 1900 united the largest and best crucible steel
process plants in America. Many of these founding
companies found root before the Civil War and one,
Sanderson Brothers of Syracuse, New York, traced its
origin to England prior to the American Revolution.
Each had a rich heritage and a well-earned reputation
in the traditions of fine steel making, a spirit which
continues with Crucible today. Then, as now, Cru-
cible craftsmen took pride in practicing all the known
arts of melting, heat-treating, and working alloy tool
and other specialty steels.

The greatest advance in the manufacture of special
purpose steels since the invention of the crucible
process itself was the use of the electri_c arc furnace.
It was introduced in America in 1906, in Syracuse,
New York by the Halcomb Steel Company, now an
integral part of Crucible. The furnace was installed
by its inventor, Paul Louis Toussaint Heroult, the
French scientist who along with, but independently of
Charles Martin Hall, invented in 1886 the electrolytic

process for the production of alumium from bauxite.

;'F he introduction of electric melting signaled a new

era in American steel making. Here was a revolution-
ary new process capable of turning out by the ton
the same kind of high quality steels formerly lim-
ited to the l00—pound “heats” of crucible pot steels —
a most significant contribution to the advancement
of American industry and the betterment of Amer-
ican living.

The crucible method continued for another gener-
ation but on a steadily declining scale. Crucible’s
historic LaBelle Works in Pittsburgh, now perman-
ently shut down, operated the last crucible melt shop

Steelmaking in the United States, capable of pro-
ducing well over 120 million tons a year, is the
world's leading industry. Most of the steels made in
this country and elsewhere are “tonnage steels”. These
are the steels made in great volume by automatic
equipment or highly mechanized processes. The metal

tion furnaces for making high-alloy grades of special
“non-iron” alloy metals.

The Company operates its own primary steel pro-
cessing equipment: blooming mills, billet mills, bar
mills, sheet mills, and strip mills. We also operate
many types of forges, presses, casting equipment, ma-
chine tools, grinding, drawing, polishing and finishing
machines.

One or more several qualities serve to make these
steels truly special purpose. Many are special purpose
because they contain alloying elements such as nickel,
chromium, tungsten, vanadium, or others of a long
list available from modern metallurgy. Alloying makes
steel hard, or pliable, or rustproof, or tough — or a
desired combination of such qualities may be gained
by alloy combinations. Other steels are special pur-
pose because they are processed into particular forms
or shapes, — finely drawn stainless and alloy wire,
precision-made tool bits, agriculture plow steels, and
harrow discs, hollow drill steel, cutlery steels. Others
are made special purpose by processing — mirror fin-
ished stainless sheets and strip, forged auto parts
nearly ready for use, precision cast parts for aircraft
engines and industrial equipment cast tools.

buildings and bridges, pipe wire and fencing, nails,
railroad track, ships, auto bodies, “tin” cans — and
thousands of other articles requiring good, strong,
durable material.

Crucible is a fully integrated steel company. This
means that it supplies itself, through ownership in
mines, with its own basic raw materials — iron ore
and metallurgical coal — and goes on to complete
all steps of steelmaking from furnace to finish.
Crucible makes its own coke and in part, its own fuel
gas and other coal by products used in steel making.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER I MARCH I955 23

A short history of Engineer’s Week . . .

St. Patrick was an engineer. This fact has been pro-
claimed by engineering schools throughout the west
and midwest for the past fifty years, and has just re-
cently been historically proven. An ancient document
dating back to the time of St. Patrick was recently dis-
covered in Ireland and it contained the words which
every engineer knew it would. “Erin Co Bragh,” which
translated loosely means, “St. Patrick was an engi-
neer.

Of course, it’s a rather loose translation, but it has
some basis. Didn’t St. Pat drive the snakes out of
Ireland, and wasn’t that the first worm drive! There-
fore, St. Patrick was an engineer. Simplelll

fSome of the Arkansas engineers whoop it up with their ”potater"
still.

4-Engineers bow during the Knighting Ceremony in I905 at the Uni-
versity of Missodri. This was the third celebration of St. Pat's birth-
day and the first one not to be rewarded by disciplinary action.

Well, anyway, that’s the way it started back in 1903,
fifty one years ago, by the engineers at the University
of Missouri. At that time there was little proof that
the Irish saint ever had any connection with the pro-
fession. But needing a vacation, a group of students
from that campus claimed that they had received
knowledge of the saint’s field of endeavor in what they
called a “revelation,” and celebrated his birthday that
first year by cutting all their classes and engaging in
various forms of merriment.

24

As a result of the disciplinary action which followed
shortly thereafter, several of the more active cele-
brants were absent from their classes for a much
longer period. Two years later, however, the celebra-
tion of St. Patrick’s Day by the engineering students
was officially recognized by the university administra-
tion.

Iowa State College and the University of Arkansas
followed Missouri’s lead by establishing a special day
of festivities in 1909. It was not long before most of
the engineering schools west of the Mississippi took
up the cry, and now the “Er'1gineer’s Day” or “Week”
is a very celebrated occasion around those parts. The
east-of—the-Mississippian schools have been somewhat
behind their “younger” brothers to the west but they
are now carrying on the tradition. There is a trend to
hold this festive occasion on Washington’s birthday in
February, he being the first American engineer, but
for this year it’s March 17.

Most of those “westem” engineering schools have a
week of celebration filled with such events as float
parades, special Church services, lab exhibits and
Open Houses, barbecues and parties, professional so-

   
   

ciety meetings, beard growing contests, tea parties,
senior banquets, campus stunts, Engineers Carnivals,
and last but not least, pre-election political rallies put
on by the candidates for St. Patricia, usually in the
form of a “cheesecake” show. St. Patricia, is then
crowned at the Engineers Ball.

The big occasion for most of these schools (besides
the climaxing dance) is the arrival of St. Patrick
dressed in green and gold robes and sporting a beard
which would put Rip Van Winkle to same.

Here is an Arkansas girl who went all out in her laid

for St. Patrick last March.

Each year he arrives by a different mode of trans-
portation, using anything from an airplane to a steam
shovel. His favorite “carriage”, however, is the rail-
road handcar. It is said that back in 1914, the actual
body of St. Patrick was resurrected from his grave
in Ireland and brought to the Iowa State Celebration.
After being carried around in a parade, St. Patrick was
called upon to make a speech to the students. Since
being interred for quite a few years and not up on the
latest talk, he was only able to say a few words. ‘Tm
glad to be here.”

the

blarney
stone

“To the unsophisticated the conglomeration of hiero-
glyphics appearing in the accompanying cut means
nothing but to those who have dived deep into hidden
things it means much. It is a facsimile of an inscription
found upon a slab of green marble dug up some three
years ago while excavating for the foundations of the
Engineering laboratory. The characters, more compli-
cated by far more than any ever carved into sphinxes
and mummies of ancient Egypt, have long been a
stumbling block to guns and sons of guns of trans-
lators and even now their meaning is obscure to all
except the Faithful. Ever since the stone was un-
earthed scores of engineers have burned the mid-
night kilowatt and Bull Durham trying to Sherlock
the riddle. They applied to it every known law of
mathematics from the three fundamental operations
to the Theory of Functions and the flow of liquids
down smooth pipes. The last mentioned law was pas-
sed by the city council with the malicious intent of
driving the “friend of the students” out of business.
The Faithful found that this law is very detrimental
to the solving of problems and, in fact, to all student
activity.

“Ever and anon while this great struggle was going
on, in spite of the above difficulty, those interested in
fossils and things primeval have gone to lectures,
dissertations and elaborations on ‘Excavations in the
Far East,’ ‘The remains of Babylon’ or the ‘Origin of
the Brick Bat’ (said lectures being infinitely deader
than the fossils), little dreaming that in their very
midst was an excavated puzzle that could give ‘Recent
Discoveries in Crete’ cards and spades and beat them
balling-up translators. While these poor misguided
seekers after truth were trying mightily to decipher
the trade marks on a few old crocks and broken tea-
cups dug up in the Garden of Eden or some modern
backyard, the Faithful were slowly but surely unlock-
ing the secret of the great green slab. Only a few days
since was the last kink straightened and the last knot
untied. By an ingenious operation, in which he com-
bined the orthographic projection of three leaves of
a shamrock and the chemical affinities of cork into an
infinite series converging four degrees and twenty
minutes northwest of Dublin, Wray Dudley dis-
covered that the snake and hod, being interpreted,
mean ‘Saint Patrick.’ This was the opening wedge.
Sunny Jim Barnes immediately applied the theory of
least squares to Dudley’s series and, integrated from
Ireland to the bench mark on the Engineering build-
ing and adding a twist of long green for a constant,
found the word ‘Engineer’. The rest was easy. Using
the key so long sought the Faithful of Saint Patrick’s
department quickly finished the work. Interpreted,
the Sacred Tablet reads as follows:

 e are all aware that the word engineer connotes

hard work, unceasing determination, and service to
humanity. Here at the University of Pittsburgh, this
would be typical of Dr. Donald E. Swarts, who is to
be proclaimed an honorary engineer and Knight of
St. Patrick at the Engineering 8c Mines Spring Dance.

Dr. Swarts, who is well known to students here at
Pitt, has compiled an admirable record. His formal
education comprises a B. A. degree from Duke Uni-
versity, and M. A. and Ph. D. degrees at the Univers-
ity of Pittsburgh. Recently he was tapped to Omicron
Delta Kappa, the national honorary leadership fra-
ternity, as a tribute to his leadership, scholarship and
fellowship.

After receiving his bachelor degree, a roving foot
and an urge for further education took him to Paris,
France. There he studied European culture, music,
art, and philosophy for five years, and served in the
capacity of Secretary and Manager of the United
States Students and Arts Club.

Recrossing the Atlantic, Dr. Swarts returned to his
native Aliquippa to teach English at Aliquippa High
School. He had nearly become settled when he re-
ceived a new and different challenge. Called into the
service of his country, he spent four years teaching
gunnery at Fort Knox Kentucky.

Following the war Dr. Swarts again began a norm-
al pursuit of life, simultaneously earning Masters and
Doctors degrees. In 1953 the University, realizing his
qualities of leadership and personality, appointed
him Director of Student Publications. His complete
and unselfish service to the Pitt News, Skyscraper
Engineer, and Owl, has been reflected many times.
Last year the Pitt News was awarded an ‘‘All Amer-
ican” rating in its class; the Owl’s financial success
enabled the renovation of its offices and the Publi-
cation’s wing of the 8th floor in the Cathedral; and
the Skyscraper Engineer, just a dream three years
ago, is now well established as the official publication
of the Schools of Engineering and Mines. No one can
miss the efficiency and espirit de corps of the student
publications group. Dr. Swarts has kept his student
working, but has kept them laughing as well.

He also serves as the advisor to Pi Delta Epsilon,
the national honorary journalism fraternity. This
fellowship and leadership was an apparent factor in
his subsequent appointment as Secretary of the Pub-
lications Board at Pitt.

Among his interests and hobbies are writing, music,
(Dr. Swarts is an accomplished organist), leading the
boys’ choir in his home town church, and cooking.
In his travels through Europe, Dr. Swarts became a

connoiseur of foreign foods. In fact, out of sheer
interest in cooking, he attended courses at Cornell
in restaurant management.

Of course, Dr. Swarts main interest is Mrs. Swarts,
who holds a professorship at Indiana State teachers
College. They have been married for 8 years.

Here at Pitt, Dr. Swarts conducts classes in tech-
nical writing for engineers, business English for a
large group of Army and Air Force officers, and in-
structs in newspaper and magazine practice. Out of
class, he has been of considerable help to students
through his capacity of Freshmen Counselor in which
he planned and directed the freshmen orientation
program. No school dance was ever complete without
Dr. and Mrs. Swarts to lighten the evening. And even
with all his burdens, he is still able to leave his door
open to his students and their problems.

Designing, creating, improving, setting standards,
these are the duties of the engineer, Dr. Swarts has

Engineers week, a tradition at midwestern schools

is fast becoming a tradition at Pitt. Last year we had
one of the most successful weeks ever held at the
University and this year promises to be even better.
St. Pat. will be on hand again to give unworthy
fellow engineers his blessings and he will headline
the whole week. Engineers all over the world have
taken St. Patrick as their patron saint because he was
the first engineer, after all he created the first worm
drive and that in itself was quite a job considering
the lack of technology in his day.

Fifty two years ago at the University of Missouri
the engineers on campus decided that they needed a
vacation from the ardous labors of going to school
and come St. Patricks Day they celebrated by cutting
all of their classes and engaging in all the forms of
merriment that their little hearts desired. As a result
of their activities some of the more active celebrants
were missing from their classes for a much longer
period than the one day that was originally planned.

Today most of the engineering schools west of the
Mississippi have an engineers day or week filled with
festivities such as we have planned for the second
annual Engineers Week at Pitt. Each school has a
variety of events that have become somewhat tradit-
ional and they all have the one crowning event, the
Engineers Ball.

30

an engineer

The schools also have made the arrival on campus
of St. Patrick one of the big events of the week. He
has arrived by many means but the most popular
seems to be on a railroad hand-car. Everything from
airplanes to zebras have been chosen as a means of
transportation to bring the Good Saint to the various
campuses. This year at Pitt we have planned one of
the best arrivals of any for the Good Saint and we
think that you will approve when you welcome him.
One of the main things is that you are present at the
arrival of St. Pat at 1:15, Tuesday, March 15. You
will be amazed and pleased by the full scale demon-
stration planned to let the people of Pittsburgh know
that we have an engineering school at Pitt.

One of the stock phrases used throughout the en-
gineering world today is “Erin Go Bragh” when loose-
ly translated it means “ST. PATRICK WAS AN
ENGINEER”. Remember this phrase during engin-
eers week as it may be useful to you. When the
instructor calls the roll in class the answer to be given
by all good engineers is “Erin Go Bragh". Any good
instructor will accept no other answer. Remember
engineers week is just as good as you make it and
there would not be an engineers week without your
help and support of the weeks activities.

ERIN GO BRAGH

an introduction to

living the good life

Realizing that the strenous routine of an engineer-
ing education provides no time for a student to ab-
sorb the culture side of life and enjoy the “good
things”, we of the SKYSCAPER ENGINEER staff,
who are known the world over for our culture, have
decided to aid and abet engineering education by
presenting this special section entitled “LIVING
THE GOOD LIFE”.

With this we hope to be able to reach even the
most mundane member of the faculty and the most
illiterate student. We wish to give all of you the op-
portunity to gain some culture by reading of our
experiences and from them, learn how to LIVE THE
GOOD LIFE.

We have placed much time and effort on this sect-
ion in order to give you, the student, a better chance
to benefit by our experience and research along the
lines of the 5 subjects that we feel are most important
to “LIVING THE GOOD LIFE”.

The five sections subtitled: Wearing the good
Clothes, Mixing the Good Drink, Driving the Good
Car, Making the Good Date and being the Good
Host, are designed to give you a better chance to
enjoy Engineers Week and every week throughout
your life.

In order to give you a better idea of the work in-

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

volved in compiling this section we will show you
just how much work it took to do so-me of them. The
mixing the good drink section required 42 days and
nights of constant research to perfect the processes
involved. Six of our staff members spent countless
hours working on the Making the Good Date section
and have come up with astounding results. The staff
“cat” toured the downtown stores in order to make
the \/Vearing the Good Clothes section the fine thing
that it is. You all should take the ideas.formulated
in this section and try them out. Every engineer either
has or wants a car and we have tried to give you some
tips on owning or buying a car in the Driving the
Good Car Section. If these tips are followed the dis-
trict roads should be a much better place to drive on.
The being the Good Host Section is one that you
will be able to use all your life and has been written
with that purpose in mind. Everyone at one time or
another in his life has to be a host and sometimes
being a good one is quite a job, we are doing our
best to see that this job is made easier for you.

After all the hours spent in making this project
possible we sincerely hope that you will be willing
to spend 1/» hour of your time in reading the first
section of its kind anyone ever dared to publish here
here at the University.

TO

Drinking, although it may not be accepted in all
circles, is fast becoming a national pastime. Hence
all engineers should know all the qualities of “mixing
the good drink”. No one ever knows when he will be
called upon to entertain the boss or some other busi-
ness associates or even in some cases friends. This
holds true with one exception, if you intend to go
into teaching engineering you will have no friends
and the boss isn’t allowed to drink (university rules
you know). We have spent many hours perfecting
the processes involved in mixing the good drinks and
we hope that you all will at one time or another,
have a chance to try out our recipe’s. We have one
stipulation though. You must invite the editor of the
Skyscraper engineer to test out all your mixtures so
that you don't get anything wrong. We wouldn't want
you to get anything wrong you know.

The first drink we feel that you all should know
about is the dry martini. This little concoction may
be made in to a regular staple in the family diet if
need be. The best recipe that we have found for a
martini is as follows: Fill one large bathtub full of
gin (dry). Close the bathroom door and walk ten paces
away from the door. Put an X on the floor at this
spot and run to the ice box and get the Vermouth
bottle and return to the X. Quickly open the ver-
mouth and take the cork in your right hand and
rotate yourself 360 degrees as quickly as possible
while remaining on the X. Quickly put the cork back
in the bottle and return to the ice box. Now open the
bathroom door and place three cubes of ice in the
tub. When the ice melts take off your right shoe and
sock and place your foot in the tub and stir. Then
serve. (serves 6)

If you happen to be the type that likes your mar-
tinis dry use the same mixture but instead of going
10 paces, run across the street and just pop out. the
cork and return it at once. Serve chilled (Still serves 6).

32

mixing the
good
  drink

Another drink that will come in handy is the Old
Fashioned. This is quite a concoction but the time
involved is well worth the trouble. Another good
thing about an old fashioned is that you can use cheap
whiskey and no one will ever know the difference.
The first step in mixing the old fashioned is to take
one teaspoon of sugar and place in a large glass, add
to this two shakes of bitters. Then add 5 jiggers of
whatever rotgut you have laying around. Stir this
mixture again. Then place a couple of ice cubes in
this mess and add a slice of orange, a slice of lemon
and one cocktail cherry. This is one of the worlds
favorite drinks and sometimes it is used in place of
the martini. This drink mixture can also be changed
around to suit the taste but the staff taster worked
for 24 days perfecting this mix we also think that it
is quite astonishing. The last thing that we shall
mention is the qaint old mixture called “2-2-1" by
some and some unprintables by others. This is a
simple little drink made up of 2 parts gin 2 parts
grapefruit juice and one part ice. Slosh this around
a little bit and drink. This is the type of drink to use
when you really want to get loaded and fast. You
will gently slide down the side of the wall you hap-
pen to be leaning on but you will still hold up your
glass for a refill when it comes time to do so. You
will be able to drink this till you pass out.

Well friends we hope that we havn’t lead any of
you astray and we also hope that you will invite us
in, whenever you decide to use some of these mix-

tures, so that we can help you in your mixing prob-
lems.

living the good life

wearing

the good clothes

One of the fundamental requirements for being a
connoisseur is a good wardrobe and a fine choice of
what to wear and when to wear it. We have spent
countless hours looking into the things that an en-
gineer wears and what we think that he should wear.
We have done this only for the male engineers, when
we tried to look into what females wear we got slap-
ped. Although we wish that this report could have
been complete and are truly sorry that the girls feel
that way, we shall‘ go on with the material at hand.

We shall start from the ground up — shoes — we
know that most people wear them but have on many
occasions been out with girls who don't. All engineers
should have at least two, preferably dirty white ones.
One can be made to do as long as you wear thick
socks. Socks are a very important item. They should
be heavy knit ones if possible and they should con-
tain chlorophyl. (especially of you have only one shoe)
You should always be careful to see that the holes
in your socks are not visible. You will find when you
go out in the business world that the good engineer
usually has two pairs of socks, one for formal occasions
and one for every day wear. All student engineers
should try to attain this goal.

Undies are the next thing on the list and they are
handy at times and prone to get in the way at other
times. You should try to have at least two suites of
undies, one for everyday and one for dates. The date
undies should be loud and flashy in color, immagine
the look on your dates face when she sees your purple
polka-dot shorts. Now you woldn’t want her to think
you ignorant and she would if you were wearing just
the plain common ordinary type of shorts.

Pants are a good thing to have three pairs of. They
too are handy to have although they also tend to get
in the way at times. You will need three pairs one
for formal wear, one for school wear and one to wear
in those cruddy old labs. Charcoal gray would look
well with your dirty white bucks.

Now we come to the shirts you should have, here
again you need three of them. One for formal wear,
one for school and one for those cruddy old labs.
French cuffs on the shirt would be impressive. Make
sure that you get a shirt that doesn't show lipstick
stains as some girls have the nasty habit of spreading
their rosey red lips all over nice white shirts and the
nextday in ‘school the faculty frowns upon know-
ing that you were out living the good life the nite
before.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

The tie is an unnecessary evil for the modern stud-
ent while in school but they are very handy when
dining out as we have found nothing better to keep
stains off a shirt than a tie. The modern student can
save himself considerable money if he buys a shoe-
string and uses it as a tie for dates and we think that
this loooong thin type of tie is best for them. Mfhen
dining out, though, we think that the wide, bright,
flashy, crazy man crazy type of tie is best because, as
we said before, soup stains don't show on them.

Vests are on thing that the good engineer needs,
but you must be sure of the type that you buy, usually
the loud plaid type is the best but remember not to
wear them in those cruddy old labs. These vests are
also a great thing to hang your key chain on and
every engineer needs a keychain to hold all those
keys that one has a habit of picking up during these
many many years we spend here at the University.

Sports coats are another need for the engineer.
Faculty members won't be able to tell you from them-
selves and they will think that you are just observing
their class’ and they don't even bother you. This is
only one of the many advantages of wearing a sport-
coat. The inside pocket is a dandy place to- carry that
old pocket flask of yours that you need at times when
you get those quiz results back. You know, that little
“pick-me—up!!!”

A hat is also some thing that each engineer should
have one of, after all who would look collegiate with-
out the homburg. If you wish to play the part of a
dept. head or a (lean you must use the homberg, how-
ever if you just want to look like the common ordin-
iary instructor by all means use the porkpie. We
however, like the homburg as we have aims in life.

Clothes alone however do not make a good en-
gineer, you must wear just the right type of after
shaving lotion. Now we have sampled-many types
which we thought suited to the engineer. However,
we found that Herrs Island No. 5 was about the best
with just the smallest wee smidgin of sheep dip added
to give it that lasting quality. This alone enhances the
bouquet, giving you that manly, masculine, engin-
eerish smell.

VVell this was just a short dissertation on what we
found to be the best clothes for the young engineer
to wear and we hope that you take heed of our dandy
advice. Pitt will be an unusual school if you do.

being the good host

This is the one phase of living the good life that
makes or breaks one socially. You as engineers, will
entertain in your lifetime many people; business
friends, girls, salesmen, girls, personal friends, girls,
and many others. You must learn how to be your best
at those trying times. (Like when one of your guests
makes some remark about the quality of the drinks
that you mix or the type of food that you offer).
lnstead of belting him you must belt him verbally
with a remark that will make him seem to be the
scum of the earth. This always goes over with your
other guests and makes your party even more enjoy-
able, but there is a time when this will have to stop
or you will have nothing but a giant insulting session
going on. You should always try to be the master of
the situation and when someone mentions something
or someone you should already know all about it and
take over the story from there. This makes your
guests feel that you know everything about everything
when you really know nothing about nothing. People
whether they admit it or not will always feel that you
are a brilliant engineer and we need them.

When entertaining girls, always try to be the ulti-
mate of self control and they will think you to be
something that 10 to 1 you are not. Always be ready
to give them a quick reply to whatever they might
ask and be ready to back it up. They will think that
you are the most brilliant man in the country and
will act accordingly and boy will you ever make out.
There is nothing better than to earn the respect of
people, especially girl people.

Then there are the times that you will be enter-
taining business associates. You want to make a big
impression on them so you had better prepare your-

36

self to dominate the conversations and to know all
about anything that is said and if you can't be saying
it just sit there and nod your head like you knew it
all the time. Nothing makes this type of people like
you more and respect you more than thinking that
you know everything.

One other thing that you should remember about
entertaining is to make sure that your liquor supply
does not run out before your guests do and to re-
member that you have to be able to out-drink all
your guests and still end up in sober a enough con-
dition to carry them to the door. Drinking is an im-
portant part of entertaining today and you should
make your parties no exception. Always make sure
that your guests leave loaded to the gills. They will
think that you throw the. best parties in town. Always
make sure that the drinks you serve are of the very
exclusive type and that each guest gets the recipe.
This makes them think that you are a real conno-
souire of fine drinking.

There is one at every party who doesn’t drink, smoke
or ]O1I‘l 1n the conversation and sits there with a dumb
a-nd dazed expression on his face. You must make it
your business to make this character do one of two
things, either feel that a party pooper isn’t wanted
or to enter into the group. Generally a statement
such as “Why in hell don't you go home” is the best
thing to say to a character of this sort but sometimes
it doesn’t work so you can always give him to job of
washing dishes at 75¢ an hour and make him feel
wanted. _

All in all, being a good host requires just a little
thought about the feelings of others and if you do
this you are sure to be a success.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

A MESSAGE TO

COLLEGE ENGINEERING
STUDENTS

from C. H. Weaver, Manager,
Atomic Power Division,

VVestinghouse Electric Corporation

University of Pennsylvania, 1936

 
 
 
  
 
 
    

To you who want to help create the atomic age

You’re looking at the practical beginning of an atomic age.

This is a model of the land-based prototype for the first atomic
submarine engine, designed and built by Westinghouse—work-
ing with the Atomic Energy Commission and the U. S. Navy.

And now, Westinghouse is developing the world’s ﬁrst atomic
power plant to harness this vast power for peacetime use. Its
output, enough for a city of 100,000 people, will go into a
utility’s power system.

Since 1948, Westinghouse has had an Atomic Power Division
for atomic energy development . . . and it now has an Atomic
Equipment Department to develop apparatus for atomic power
installations. These are typical of the steps our forward-looking

you CAN as SURE ...u= its

VVestinghouse

 

\/Vestinghouse management is constantly taking in leading the
way toward development of new sources of energy and new
products.

Wouldn’t you like to be with Westinghouse . . . helping to
create this new era?

VVe at Westinghouse are interested in you as an ina’z'via’ual . . .
interested in your ambitions as well as your technical ability.
For your professional development, there is a Graduate Study
Program, available in 19 universities, and leading to your
Master’s and Ph.D. degrees. And there are other Westinghouse
programs to ﬁt your individual needs . . . all aimed at helping
you reach your goal. u-1oz31

living the good life

A student in the School of Engineering derives a

a vast well of knowledge in his subjects. -Every in
structor recognizes that his knowledge must be used
practically (eg pulling out every wire in your home
and then trying to put them back in working order).
For the Engineer, this knowledge is invaluable in the
selection, maintance and propulsion of his car. Unlike
other students in a university, you as an engineer must
be more concious of the type of car you buy. When
you go down to a car lot, inspect the prospective car
from all angles. Make sure that it has 1. wheels, if
these are missing an unreasonable amount of hard-
ship will be felt. 2. a body. This is a must unless you
intend on living in Equitorial Africa. 3. A roomy
interior. Every Engineer knows that necessity of hav-
ing a large front and back seat to lay his books, draw-
ing equipment and other such things on.
4. A motor. Of course this is not needed if you are
intending to go into glider research. If the car is an
unusually good buy some of these things can be pick-
ed up later. However when I say pick up later I do
not mean it in the sense of appropriating from some-
one elses vehicle. An ex engineering friend took it in
that sense and is now serving time in a local penial
Institution.

Stress should also be placed on the car potential-
ities. Will it run is an important feature. Will you
receive optium results in “Dragging” with fellow en-
gineers Rolls Royces. Are you able to fit six of your
friends into the car with all of their engineering
drawing equipment? Will the back seat be large

38

driving the good car

 

AW-/‘\ \\

‘@‘§t2.9§J\'

enough to hold all of the liquid refreshments for an
engineers week party? If your car can meet all these
requirements don't buy it; its probably too expensive.

After you buy your car you must become familiar
with its care.

Many authors have compared inatimate objects with
a girl. Not wanting to ignore great authors and hav-
ing new comparisons myself, I shall compare a car
to a girl. You have_ to feed it to keep it running, like
a girl you have to keep it well oiled to get any fun
out of it. You have to keep puttering around with it
and not lose interest in it if you expect to keep it
around very long. Lastly you must not disturb the
internal workings because of the developments that
might result.  to obtain results, do not manhandle
or mlstreat 1t 1n any way.

It is important for the good engineer to drive the
good car in a good way if said engineer expects to go
on living the good life. In this mechanical age there
are many road hazards such as holes in the roads,
holes in other drivers heads and pre med students.
Many drivers like to drive with one arm around a
girl. This practice has no fault except for the fact
that some drivers have their arms around reluctant
girls sitting at the other end of the car. This practice
1s not only dangerous but leads to many dislocated
shoulders. This can be easily fixed though if you
don't go out with reluctant girls. If these faults are
overcorne the engineer can look forward to a long and
good l1fe..But whether the car be a death trap or a
passion pit, 1ts n1ce to own a car.

AUTOMATION at

One of Western Electric’s automatic produc-
tion lines used in making the revolutionary
new wire spring relay.

So great was the departure in design of the new Bell System
wire spring relay as compared with conventional relays that
it posed a major undertaking for development engineers at
Western Electric, the manufacturing and supply unit of the
Bell System. Indeed, it was an undertaking that called for
new machines and new methods because none was available
to do the job.

Longer life, higher operating speed, lower power con-
sumption, and lower manufacturing cost were some of the
advantages promised by the new relay design. Engineers
reasoned that a lower manufacturing cost could be achieved
through greater precision in manufacture (which would cut
adjustments) and through extensive use of automatic
processes.

One of the products of this reasoning is pictured at the
top of this page. This battery of equipment, developed by
Western Electric product engineers, constitutes one phase
of wire spring relay manufacture, which automatically per-
forms several separate operations. Its function begins after
one of the fundamental elements of the new relay has been
fabricated. This element, known as a “comb,” consists of a
multiplicity of small diameter wires in parallel array im-
bedded for part of their length in molded phenol plastic.

These molded elements, of which there are two types used
in the new relay, are delivered to this line of machine units
in magazines. By fully automatic means they are removed
from the magazine, carried by. a reciprocating conveyor
through each of the several processes and, when completed,
placed into another magazine to await further assembly.

Between the ﬁrst and ﬁnal magazine the automatic bat-
tery of equipment does the following operations: clips wire
ends, attaches palladium contacts to wire ends by means of
percussion welding, sizes contacts, forms terminal, tension
bends wires, ﬂuxes and tins terminals.

Most remarkable of all is the fact that this is a precision
operation throughout. For example, the small block con-

1. By drilling a one inch diame-
ter hole through a cubical block of
steel, parallel to the faces of the
block, 0.0019635 part of the steel
was cut away. What are the di-
mensions of the block?

2. Is the Centigrade and Fahren-
heit reading ever the same? If so,
for what temperature?

3. The weights of two balls are
as 9 to 25, but the weights of a
cubic foot of the metals of which
these are made are as 15 to 9. What
is the ratio of their volumes?

4. An amoeba reproduces by di-
viding into two every hour. At the
start we have one, at the end of
one hour we have two at the end
of two hours we have four, and so
on. ll it takes 100 hours to cover
a certain area, how many hours
would it take to cover the same
area if at the beginning there had
been four amoeba instead of one?

5. This problem is especially for
the Chem Engineers. However, I
suppose that anyone who could get
through Chem E 9 has qualified
to work this, so even you ME’s
should be able to obtain a solu-
tion. (To obtain a solution just
dissolve this in water.)

One morning a certain chemical
reaction started at exactly a quarter
of the hour. The chemical reaction
finished precisely at the first meet-
ing of the minute and hour hands.
If the reaction took more than an
hour, what was the exact time it
started and how long did it take?

6. In what way can 1000 be ex-
pressed by the sum of two or more
consecutive numbers.

40

7. This and that and a half of
this and that is what per cent of
three fourths of this and that?

CHESTERFIELD
BRA INBUSTER

The brainbuster this month
is to find three numbers.
There is a seven-digit number
which, multiplied by 27,
yields itself framed in l’s at
the beginning and the end.
By framing an eight-digit
number by two pairs of l’s
you will obtain the number
multiplied by 29. Finally,
there is a ten-digit figure
which, multiplied by 33,
yields itself framed in two
pairs of l’s what are these
numbers?

A carton of Chesterfield ci-
garettes will be given to the

8. Does 11 and 2 make I?

9. If five quarters are tossed in-
to the air at the same time, what
are the chances that at least four
of them will turn up all heads or
tails?

10. In setting up 2 :9 the printer
got it 2592. Strange to say this
blunder did not affect the value
of the result. Can you find another
number of few digits which has
this pecuiarity?‘

11. Divide the twelfth power of
89,798 by the eleventh power of
the same number and multiply the
quotient by the number whose
square root is equal to its cube
root. What number do you arrive
at?

12. Imagine a cube with each of
six faces painted in any six differ-
ent colors. In how many ways may
the six colors be arranged?

ANSWERS

l. The cube is 20 inches on edge.

2.Centigrade equals Farenheit at
minus forty degrees.

3. The volumes are as 9/15 times
9/25 or 27/125.

4. It takes two hours less to co-
ver the area when starting with
four, that is, 98 hours.

.5. The reaction started at a quar-
ter of nine and lasted 64 minutes,
20 seconds.

6. This can be done in three Ways.

SLIDING DOWN THE WAYS at Groton, Conn., goes the USS Nautilus,

 
   

Ix.‘ ,.

newest and fastest member of our underseas ﬂeet. During welding,
Worthington heavy-duty turning rolls rotated the hull sections.

How the world’s first atomic suh was welded

Welding the hull of the USS Nautilus, world’s ﬁrst
atomic submarine, presented a tough problem.

Submerged-arc automatic welding seemed to be ideal
for the job. Question was—could you rotate the hull
sections of the Nautilus to take advantage of this fast,
high-quality welding method?

Worthington’s answer to General Dynamics Corpo-
ration’s Electric Boat Division, builder of the Nautilus,
was the largest turning roll ever built.

The result? Welding of the Nautilus hull was accom-
plished in record-breaking time — and cost less than
originally estimated. Unchanged, the Worthington roll

set-up is also being used in the construction of the
nation’s second atomic sub, the USS Sea Wolf.
Turning rolls for submarines aren’t all that Worth-
ington m'akes. The long list of Worthington-designed,
Worthington-built equipment includes air conditioning
units, construction machinery, compressors, Diesel en-
gines, steam power equipment and, of course, pumps
of all kinds. For the complete story of how you can ﬁt
into the Worthington picture, write F. F. Thompson,
Manager, Personnel and Training, Worthington Cor-
poration, Harrison, New Jersey. You may be glad

you did.

You’re looking at a kilowatt-hour* of electricity in its
raw state—coal. This lump of coal weighs only 12
ounces. Not too long ago, the amount of coal required
to produce a single kilowatt-hour of electricity was con-
siderably larger and weighed 5 pounds. The difference
between yesterday’s 5 pounds and today’s 12 ounces lies
in improved steam technology, in better boi1ers—operat-
ing at higher pressures and temperatures—to make the
steam that spins the turbines to make electric power.

Impressive as this progress appears, it represents only
the current level of accomplishment in the quest for more
and still more eﬂiciency. Thanks to America’s power en-

ers. Temperature regulation is either automatic or
manual for any temperature within these extremes.
This regulation is accomplished by means of a ther-
mostat and a series of relays and switches.

gineers, continuing advances in the ﬁelds of metallurgy,
combustion and design will make it possible to squeeze
even more energy from a lump of coal.

*A kilowatt-hour will give you the power for, among other things, 10
solid hours of radio and recorded music, 14 hours of fan-cooling,

better than 4V2 hours of refrigeration operation.

An important part of production testing is the life test. This
set-up is used to test bomb release mechanisms. The item in the
foreground is loaded with a 2,000 pound bomb. In the left rear
is the electrical and hydraulic control panel.

A complex test setup is a pneumatic system for
testing pneumatic gun chargers. In flight these
chargers insert the first shell in the cannon so that
accidental firing will not occur when taking off. After
the first shell is loaded, the cannon itself is an auto-
loading device so that the charger is not used again.
The test setup consists of two compressors, one a high
pressure precision aircraft type for pressure up to
3700 psi and the other, a high Capacity compressor
for pressures up to 2500 psi. Included are all the
necessary valves and pressure regulators for running
the tests. The aircraft compressor is used only for a
burst test which is conducted under water. The other
compressor is used for the functional tests and the
life test. The life test is automatically run by a se-
quence of relays and a solenoid operated valve.

Quality control and metallurgical tests start at the
mines and accompany every step of operation, inspec-
tion, and shipment. Plant tests simulate field con-
ditions to assure customers of qualities they need.
Working with customers, Crucible experts study our
steels in use. If new types of steels are needed, we
develop and test them, then introduce them.

We operate five basis plants at Midland, Pa., Syra-
cuse, N.Y., Harrison, N. and two in Pittsburgh, Pa.

Midland VVorks is the “Integration” plant. It is the
dual purpose center that produces both iron and spe-
cial purpose steels in large volume. Its steel products
go in direct shipment to industry and to the Crucible
Vllavehouses. Midland steels also go to other plants
for further processing work.

Coal and coke come together at the three Midland
Works blast furnaces, representing a total annual
capacity of 895,000 tons of iron per year. Molten
iron from the blast furnaces goes to the Midland
open hearth furnaces, which have a capacity of a
million tons of alloy and carbon steels a year. The
electric furnace department has an annual capacity
of some 300,000 tons.

Park Works, in Pittsburgh, enjoys a fine industry
wide reputation for its ability to produce a wide var-
iety of products. Its versatility has earned Park the
name of the “tailor shop of steelmaking”. Besides
being a leading producer of hollow drill and drill
steels for mining, construction, and quarrying in-
dustries, it was the experimental site for much of the
Company's production research on titanium and ti-
tanium alloys. Its laboratories are staffed for large
scale service ‘testing work on a cooperative basis with
customers. Drill steels, saw blade steels, and other pro-
ducts are put to the test of simulated field conditions
at the plant. Testing determines exact qualities and
methods of use for the benefit of steel users.

Spaulding Works, in Harrison, demonstrates per-
fectly our principle of “tons of craftmanship going
into pounds of special purpose steels.” Spaulding has
two departments: Cold Rooled and Special Products.
Cold rolled products include steels for cutlery, razor
blades, business machines, auto trim, industrial saws,
hardware steel and hundreds of other items. Special
Products makes castings of non-ferrous alloys; and
Rexweld, a hard-surfacing welding rod for metal parts
and structures that resist wear and engine parts that
resist temperature.

Compliments

of a friend

 

When customers of the steel industry in late 1954 began
demanding shorter lead time on orders, the elapsed time be-
tween placing an order and receiving delivery, the extensive
warehouse system and modern facilities of Crucible Steel Com-
pany, such as this new structure in Milwaukee, were able to fill
many sales from stock.

Sanderson-Halcomb Works, in Syracuse, N. Y. the
tool steel center of Crucible, is the largest plant of
its kind anywhere. The plant turns out the finest
quality tool and high alloy steels. Its electric melting
department, producing the “Tiffany” grades, has a
yearly capacity of more than 50,000 tons. A part of
the plants monthly shipments of high speed steel is
in the form of ready-to-use tool bits. An extensive
wire mill processes tool, alloy, and stainless steels into
a broad range of products. Sanderson-Halcomb has
played a maor part in the development of Crucible’s
commanding position as a supplier of the super alloys
required in atomic energy, jet propulsion, and other

such an arrangement, the accelerometers can be cali-
brated to their rated accuracy of one per cent.

Another development project which is nearing com-
pletion is a system utilizing a ten turn helipot to
indicate the tensile load on a specimen. A load cell
with resistance strain gages mounted in the form of
a bridge is used as a transducer to transform strain
on the load cell to an electric signal. The pot is placed
within the bridge so that the slider on the pot will
null out the signal produced by the load. By suit-
ably adjusting the circuit parameters, the position of
the shaft on the pot can be made equal to the applied
load in pounds, divided by some power of ten. Event-
ually several load cells of different ranges will be
used with the same instrumentation circuit for com-
plete load coverage.

Part of the Engineering Research Division is lo-
cated in the Metallurgical Engineering Laboratories
in State Hall. There, various metallurgical tests are
run on the structural members of the bomb suspen-
sion equipment. Such equipment as the Sonntag test-
ing machine which can superimpose a sinusoidally
varying load of peak amplitude as high as 2500 pounds

   
   

Gun chargers operated uncle" high pressure are tested by this

on a static load as high as 5000 already applied on a

with the present contract.

Most of the necessary facilities for designing and
building of this equipment are available at the En-
gineering Research Division. There is a well equipped
machine shop, welding machines and torches. All of
the equipment necessary for designing, developing,
maintaining and servicing the electrical and electronic
equipment used at the Engineering Research Division
is available. In addition there is a darkroom com-
pletely equipped for processing strip film, paper,
and plate film.

The Engineering Research Division, presently lo-
cated at 2637 Fifth Avenue, is a part of the Schools
of Engineering and Mines under the direction of Dr.
G. R. Fitterer, Dean of the Schools. The staff con-
sists of two part time and eight full time employees.
The tests are run by approximately 30 part time tech-
nicians most of whom are undergraduates in the
Schools of Engineering and Mines. Secretarial offices
for the Engineering Research Division are located in
State Hall.

highly specialized industries.

Spring Works, in Pittsburgh, produces the world-
famous Crucible steel springs for railroad locomo-
tives, freight cars, and passenger cars. At the plant,
bars are shaped into coiled springs, and flat stock is
cut and formed into elliptical,, or leaf springs.

Substantial as Crucible’s research and development
has been, future plans for the activity promise to
exceed all past effort. In December of 1954, we an-
nounced the appointment of Dr. Maurice  Day, an
outstanding scientist with a rich metallurgical back-
ground, as its first Director of Research and Develop-
ment. To join Crucible, Dr. Day resigned his pos-
ition as Assistant Director of Program Development
for the Armour Research Foundation of the Illinois
Institute of Technology. In January of this year
Crucible announced that it had acquired a 30 acre
tract in a suburb just west of Pittsburgh as a pos-
sible site for a new research laboratory.

In addition to maintaining laboratories at all of
its plants, Crucible operates a number of specific cus-
tomer service research centers. Two of these are the
Customer Corrosion Laboratory at Midland and the
Tool Steel Research Division at Syracuse.

The Corrosion Laboratory conducts a full scale re-
search program dealing with the problems of cor-
rosion in the pulp and paper, the chemical, and other
process industries. Established as a customer service
to help fight steel’s number one enemy, the labora-
tory is concerned with the various phases of the prob-
lem including chemical, spectroscopic, and micro-
scopic studies of the steels involved, studies of the in-
herent corrosiveness of the various cooking liquors,
woods, gases, and other matters, and studies of the
effect of protective films.

Establishment of the Tool Steel Research Division
has been a significant addition to Crucible’s Sales or-
ganization. It was formed to assist the users of tool
steels, to promote the development of improved or
new grades, and to increase performance or to meet
new applications as they arise.

In the highly technical atmosphere which neces-
sarily surrounds the diversified operations at Crucible,
the need for capable engineers with university de-
grees in constant. The even broader and more com-

New RCA Radar “Weather Eye”

Sees Through

In our time, Man has won round after round in a contest
against the elements that started thousands of years ago.

The most recent scientiﬁc victory is something new in
Radar—an electronic “Weather Eye” developed by RCA.

In airplanes, this supersensitive instrument peers miles
ahead. It gives advance Warning of Weather disturbances. The
signals on its radar screen point the Way to a safe course
around storm areas, or even through them.

The leadership in electronic research that made the
“Weather Eye” possible is inherent in all RCA products and
services. And at the David Sarnoff Research Center of RCA,
Princeton, N. J ., scientists are continually at work to extend
the frontiers of “Electronics for Living.”

With teeth cut into it, this gear blank becomes
an engine part. One manufacturer thought
these blanks were costing him too much to
make. The center hole had to be bored out of
solid bar stock. It took one hour to make 29
blanks. A lot of steel was wasted in the proc-
ess. He took his problem to Timken Company
metallurgists. After study, they recommended
a change in production methods together
with the use of Timken® seamless steel tubing.

How 'l'IMKEN® seamless Iulaing helped
quadruple production

Because the hole’s already there in Timken
seamless tubing, it doesn’t have to be bored
out. No steel is wasted. Finish boring is now
the manufacturer's ﬁrst step. He can turn out
120 to 130 gear blanks per hour with a 50%
cut in machining costs. This is another one
of the hundreds of problems that have been
solved by Timken ﬁne alloy steel.

On these occasions, St. Patrick is assisted by the
Guard of St. Patrick, a group of outstanding engineer-
ing students who are tapped to this honorary society.
Pledges to the group are called “Squires” and members
of it are known as “Knights.”

The Squires are initiated to the Guard of St. Pat-
rick on the evening of the Engineer’s Ball by being
“knighted” With a two foot slide rule by St. Patrick

and they show their faith by kissing the “Blarney
Stone.”

 

Since the Squires are required to kiss the Blarney
Stone before they become Knights the stone has
caused no little excitement in some of the Universities.
It seems that some of the boys from foreign schools
(any school other than Engineering or Mines) have
made strong attempts to steal it from the Engineers.
But under the protection of the Squires, it has been
kept out of mischievous hands.

A fine thing about these weeks at other schools is

St Pat chose a dirt scoop as his mode of transportation in 1951 at
the University of Missouri.
the fact that all the students take part in the week and
at least 50% of them are in on the planning of it or at
work on the departmental displays. That is what
makes the week what it is—an Engineer’s Week.

VVhat will Pitt’s be like? It’s hard to say. The cen-
terspread of this magazine holds the program which
has been planned——it’s up to you to make use of this
program and to get up a little spirit on your own.

up the river of time to my grateful ears. But who is
that approaching with such gas-engine snorts and
cornﬁeld strides? Why looketh he so wild and why
paweth he the air so frantically with his hand and a
half? What do I hear him say? “Upon whose authority
do you blow a band upon the campus to-day?” (He
talks as though some one were smoking and blowing
rings.) I seem to hear him further say: “Rowdies, go
to town, gentlemen, go to classes; murder college
spirit." Alas, that my day should be profaned by such
a poor misguided creature as he. Why should he want
tllie Fapithful to murder College spirit by going to
c asses.

“ ‘Methinks I see some other things that make the
angels weep.lI see members of the Faithful canned for
lifting up their voices and blowing a band. By the for-
mer snakes of Ireland, it maketh me wild. But in the
sweet bye and bye shall they get their reward, for veri-
ly I say unto you, many cold bottles are laid up for
those who suffer for my sake. Much shall they eat and
drink where faculties cometh not, neither do city ordi-
nances butt in and say a student may not buy, for in
the happy land prepared by me great cataracts of Bud
do flow without money and without price and whoso-
ever getteth in may dip it up in a can. Yea, verily, with
their cans shall my F aithful dip and drink while dis-
cipline committees gasp across the great gulf for just a
little foam to cool their blistered gaspers. But the faith-
ful shall say unto them “Nay, nay, Pauline & Co.; de-
part from me: go chase yourself: I know you not. You
giacy smoke but not drink for the deeds done in the

“ ‘A year has passed and my followers are still strong

in the faith though divers members of the faculty tell

them I am mythical as Santa Claus and differ from
him only in that I bringeth flunks, kerflops, much cus-
sing, and gnashing of teeth instead of peanuts. And
here must I pause to weep for those who went astray.
For verily some of my followers, even the tribe of
mechanics, though they were slaves to the Greene,
did murder college spirit by going to classes. Yea,
verily, their hearts became as those chickens.

“ ‘Although ingratitude tireth me like Doctor
Brown’s lectures and giveth me a pain like freshman
English, yet will I forgive them for their loyalty when
I again appear in the world. For, verily, I say unto
you, at the third great 'amboree of the Faithful will I
be among them in the flesh. Yea, even I, the first engi-
neer, shall walk the earth once more and carry my
good instrument that made the profile of the Emerald
Isle. Down Ninth street shall I run my line and show
the editor of the catalogue how to build a walk there-
upon for the lack of which I see the Faithful are sorely
vexed. I shall also demonstrate that matter is indes-
tructible and that there is, therefore, a better way of
getting rid of undesirable dirt than by trying to wear_1t
out by moving it from place to place and back again.
I must run the snakes out of the buck-bushes around
the campus and last, but not least, I must bless the
Faithful. Yea, verily, shall I stand upon the steps of my
temple and they will bow before me and then shall I

stretch forth my hands and bless them muchly and
vanish from their sight. But each year shall I return
again upon the day set apart for me and admonish
each of the faithful to remember that day to keep it
holy if he would dip his can in the river of Bud and
drink with me under the Bushes. I havei{sp%l§en.

Successful Engineers
must know how to cut costs

WELDED STEEL
DESIGNS ALWAYS
LOWER COSTS

By knowing how to use welded steel
in modern product designs, you can
lower manufacturing costs up to 50%.
Here is how:

Material Cost is l.ess—It’s a fact .

steel is three times stronger than
iron, two and a half times as rigid.
Where strength alone is needed, one-
third the metal is necessary. When
rigidity is important, less than halfthe
material is required. But steel costs
only one-third as much per pound.
Steel is more easily placed where it
can carry more load per pound of
metal. As a result, ultimate savings
with steel are limited only by the
resourcefulness of the designer.

Manufacture is Simpler—Fewer man-
hours . . . simpler, less costly produc-
tion tools are needed to manufacture
products from steel. By proper de-
sign, many operations needed for
machining castings can be eliminated
entirely. Assembly operations can
be simpliﬁed . . . ﬁnishing and clean-
ing manhours reduced substantially.

Products designed in steel have a
modern appearance to improve sell-
ing appeal while reducing costs on
an average of 50% according to field
reports.

 

Welded Design Saves 50% on ‘I710!/H‘ _gear

you have called on a pretty young
woman. You are seated at on end
of the sofa and she is seated at the
other end. You move half way to-

the remaining distance toward her.
And again you reduce the distance
separating you from her by fifty
percent. Continue this for some
time. Theoretically you will never
reach the girl. On the other hand,
you will soon get close enough to
her for all practical purposes.”

his pockets for a cigarette and a
light. He managed to get the cig-
arette in his mouth, but he could-
n’t find a match. He asked his
companion. “Shay, ole buddy, you
got a light?”

“I think so.” replied the other
“Lemme see.”

He reached in his pocket, drew

out a match, and tried to light the
wrong end by rubbing it against
the lampost.
“Sno good,” he said, and took an-
other out of the box and went
through the actions and again fail-
ed to light the match and the third
time he managed to light the right
end. However, he immediately
blew it out and put it back in the
box.

The other -drunk yelled out,

This is the kind of problem that constantly chal-
lenges IBM engineers.

It challenges their knowledge, their skill, and
their ingenuity. It challenges them to “throw
away the book” and, starting from scratch, come
up with solutions that are unorthodox—both in
concept and execution.

In this stimulating atmosphere, the young engi-
neer quickly discovers that fresh new ideas are
not only in demand, but are given the chance to
pay off in practical application.

It had been a busy day for mo-
ther and to make matters worse her
small son came running in to the
house with his pants torn.

“You go right to your room and
mend those pants yourself,” she
ordered, “and don't let me see you
out here until the job is done.”

A little later she went in to see
how the job was coming along.
The pants lay on a chair and the
door to the cellar, usually closed
was open. The mother called down
sternly: “Are you running around
down there without your pants
on? A deep voice answered, “No

The one-ring circus was visiting
a town in the hills. The folks there
recognized all the instruments in
the band except the slide trom-
bone.

One old settler watched the play-
er for quite some time, then, turn-
ing to his oldest son, said. “Don’t
let on that you're watching him.
There's a trick to it; he ain’t really
swallerin’ it.”

V

The dam burst, and the raging
flood quickly forced the town peo-
ple to flee to ‘the hills.

As they gazed down sadly at their
flooded homes they saw a straw hat
float gently downstream for about
fifty feet. Then it stopped, turned
around and plowed slowly up-
stream against the rushing waters.
After fifty feet, it turned and
moved downstream again. Then
upstream again. Then downstream
again.

“Say” said one of the townfolk,
“T/Vhat makes that hat act so durn
funny?”

“VVell, I ain’t sartin sure,” spoke
up a youth, “but last night I heard

The man at the bar had just fin-

“Turn left, and walk down to

The young engineer did as he
was told and in due time returned
to his seat.

“Is the second act over yet?”

''I needed to ‘Find’ Myself-
thufs why I picked Allisulmers,”

says A. J. MESTIER
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sc. B.—1943
and now Manager, Syracuse District Office

“I WAS LOOKING for an engineering job,
but I wasn’t very sure just what phase
of this broad ﬁeld would interest me most.
I didn’t know whether I wanted straight
engineering, sales engineering, production
or some other branch of industrial engi-
neering.

“Al1is-Chalmers Graduate Training
Course gave me a means of working at
various jobs—seeing what I liked best-
and at the same time obtaining a tremen-
dous amount of information about many
industries in a very short time.”

Experience Typical

“My experience is typical in many ways.
I started the Graduate Training Course in
1946, after three years in the Army. My
ﬁrst request was to go to the Texrope
V-belt drive department. From there I
went to the Blower and Compressor de-
partment; then the Steam Turbine depart-
ment. By the time the course was completed
in 1948, my mind was made up and I knew
I wanted sales work. I was then assigned
to the New York District Office and in
1950 was made manager of the Syracuse
District. The important thing to note is
that all Allis-Chalmers GTC’s follow this
same program of picking the departments
in which they want to work.

“Best of all, students have a wide choice,
for A-C builds machines for every basic
industry, such as: steam and hydraulic
turbine generators, transformers, pumps,
motors and other equipment for electric
power; rotary kilns, crushers, grinders,
coolers, screens and other machinery for

mining, ore processing, cement and rock
processing. Then there is ﬂour milling
machinery, electronic equipment and
many others.”

A Growing Company

“In addition, new developments and the
continuing growth of the company offer
almost endless opportunities for young
engineers.

“From my experience on the Graduate
Training Course, I believe it is one of the
best conducted in the industry and permits
a young engineer to become familiar with
a tremendous variety of equipment—both
electrical and mechanical—which will
serve him in good stead in his future pro-
fession.”

 PHOTOGRAPHY AT WOR

Richmond Station of the Philadelphia Electric Co.

Weeks of work shrink to days as
photography weighs mountains of coal

Aero Service Corporation takes stereo pictures
of the coal piles at a utility’s 10 storage sites—reports
the fuel reserves on a single inventory date at
25% lower cost than with other methods

It used to take a surveying crew weeks to measure and
ﬁgure the contents of the Philadelphia Electric Co.’s big
coal piles. Now a camera and an airplane work together
to cut the time to days. Overlapping pictures are taken
from the air. Then with stereo plotting equipment the
volume of the heap is calculated.

Streamlining the inventory job is a natural for pho-
tography. It’s being used to count metal rods, automotive
parts, telephone calls as well as tons of coal. But pho-
tography works for business in many other ways as well
——saving time, reducing error, cutting costs, improving
production.

Graduates in the physical sciences and in engineering
ﬁnd photography an increasingly valuable tool in their
new occupations. Its expanding use has also created
many challenging opportunities at Kodak, especially in
the development of large-scale chemical processes and
the design of complex precision mechanical-electronic
equipment. Whether you are a recent graduate or a qual-
iﬁed returning service man, if you are interested in these
opportunities, write to Business & Technical Personnel
Dept., Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester 4, N. Y.

Aero Service Corporation takes its stereo photographs and
translates them into a contour map of 1-foot

- intervals. Each 1-foot stratum of the coal pile
can then be measured with a planimeter
and its volume computed.

The Torrington Needle Bearing

proper housing design is essential to proper performance

The Torrington Needle Bearing
offers many design and opera-
tional advantages for a great
variety of products and equip-
ment. For example, a Needle
Bearing has greater rated radial
load capacity in relation to its
outside diameter than any other
type of anti-friction bearing. It is
extremely light in weight. And it

is easy to install and lubricate.

Housing Maintains
Bearing Roundness

The housing is an essential part
of the Needle Bearing assembly.
Care should be taken to provide
a straight, round housing bore to
the recommended tolerances.
The thin, surface-hardened
outer shell of the Needle Bearing
acts as the outer race surface as
well as a retainer for the rolls.
This shell assumes the shape of
the housing into which it is
pressed. Consequently, the hous-
ing bore should be round, and the
housing so designed that it will
carry the radial load imposed on

the bearing without distortion.

Housing Material
Determines Bore Size

The speciﬁed housing bore dimen-
sions for any given material
should be maintained in order to

give the proper running clearance

 

Needle Bearings require simple
housings. If the housing bores are
held to proper size, accurate oper-
ation and high radial capacity are
assured.

   

STEERING GEAR

between the needle rollers and
the shaft, and to assure sufﬁcient
press ﬁt to locate the bearing
ﬁrmly.

When designing housings of
materials that are soft or of low
tensile strength, allowance should
be made for the plastic flow of the

material when the bearing is

pressed into place. Bore dimen-
sions in such cases should be less
than standard. Needle Bearings
can be pressed directly into phe-
nolic or rubber compounds, al-
though metal inserts are recom-
mended.

The new Needle Bearing cata-

log will be sent on request.
