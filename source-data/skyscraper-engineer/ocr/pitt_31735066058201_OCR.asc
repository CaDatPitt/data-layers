THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER























                          A MAN by the name of Aristotle,
who was quite a guy in his time some 2300 years ago, wisely observed
that happiness is an activity, not a passive thing. In more everyday
words he would have said that nobody ever gets happy just lying
around waiting for some diversion to make him happy.
     Sure, the classroom becomes a grind at times and we need some-
thing to take our minds off it; something we can get a little fun out
of; some diversion which we won't find lying around. We aren't get-
ting a real education without these deviations, either.
     What a lot of students don't realize is that a University is the
best place in the world to find these antithesis from the everyday
classroom-the best place in the world to get an education and have
fun, too!
     And an education is a lot more than just going to class and do-
ing homework, just as school spirit is a lot more than cheering at pep
rallies and football games. Sure they have quite a bit to do with it,
but it takes a lot of other things, too: Tuck Shop bull sessions; school
dances, parties and picnics; the Pitt news; seminar field trips; stu-
dent organizations and activities; fraternities and sororities, etc., etc.
They all contribute to an education. The kind of education you won't
find in a classroom.
     But they won't come to you, you have to go after them; you
won't find these modulations if you lie around waiting for them.
Here is something to think about-there are more than 100 organiza-
tions on the Pitt Campus! 100 organizations that can teach you any-
thing from editing a newspaper to taking a good photograph or the
latest square dance reel. If you have the spare time for them, they
have an education for you. It's up to you to make use of them.

William Carpenter was originally a sales repre-
sentative for Columbia-Southern, working out of
the St. Louis district sales office, and is now
Acting District Sales Manager. His job is an
interesting one and a vital one in the fast-growing
Columbia-Southern chemical business.
Bill studied engineering with the thought in mind
of becoming a salesman. He has some sound
reasoning to offer to the graduate. But let's start
at the beginning of his story.
Bill entered Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Pa., in
1942 but the war interrupted his college education
for two years. He graduated as a chemical engineer
in 1948.
He wanted to get into sales rather than production
or engineering. He felt then, as he does now, that
an engineering background is becoming an increas-
ingly important one for the man who wants to
move ahead in the field of selling. He believes that
the vast amount of initiative and imagination in
specialized sales work is based on a foundation of
technical knowledge.
Bill looked around for quite a bit after graduation
to find the right spot for his talents. He had many
interviews but finally settled on Columbia-Southern.
He was impressed with the caliber of people at


Columbia-Southern . . . the type with whom he
liked to work. He found Columbia-Southern a
progressive, rapidly expanding company. He real-
ized that the sound sales training program, super-
vised by the Technical Service Department, guar-
anteed complete understanding of his products.
The program called for actual plant work in
production, engineering, research and shipping-
providing him with the thorough background
which would be demanded by his customers.
Bill is glad he decided on Columbia-Southern. He
now has full responsibility for all accounts as
Acting District Sales Manager in the corporation's
St. Louis office.
Bill has this to say to the graduate: "Look for a
company that is growing. Look for a company
that will give you the opportunity to do the work
you are best suited to do. Look for the organization
which offers real opportunity for advancement."
Columbia-Southern has opportunities for graduates
in all business and technical fields including engi-
neering, research & development, sales, plant design,
mining, construction, maintenance, production,
accounting, transportation and related fields.

tion to our Pittsburgh address or any of the plants.

... ON THE DANGER OF UNIONIZING ENGINEERS



                                            by Dr. G. R. Fitterer


  One of my grandfathers was a building contractor. He
not only was the architect for the construction, but he
served as his own contractor and had a planing mill in
which he built window frames, doors, etc. It always
struck me as being interesting that in addition to this, he
was also a member of the carpenter's union. He was able
to work right along with the union men until the build-
ing was completed. Many of our old contractors oper-
ated on this basis and it is doubtful if this is possible to-
day. However, the union personnel were perfectly willing
to accept him as an equal because he had been through
the apprenticeship required for membership in the union.
This meant that he had spent years of his early life under
a master carpenter learning the trade and no one ques-
tioned his skill and ability in this trade.
  In the last twenty years there have been many changes
in the unions and the requirements for membership. In
certain trades a certain amount of apprenticeship and
exhibition of skill are still required prior to the granting
of full membership. However, there are many unions to-
day which require little or no skill for membership. Pro-
gression in status is merely a matter of seniority instead
of attainment of skill. Such unions, of course, tend to
grant the unskilled the same pay and other benefits as it
does the highly skilled.
   Recently there has been developing in some industries
a new type of unionization which greatly affects the pro-
fessional status of the engineer. For example, during the
early war years in the steel industry, engineers were
placed in so-called "observation corps." Actually they
performed many duties of an engineering and supervisory
nature which involved the technical operation of the steel
mill. However, because of the fact that the young engi-
neer was given the title of "observer," he was soon drafted
into military service. The draft boards felt that "observ-
ers" were not essential personnel.
   Soon the shortage of engineers became critical and it
was necessary for the steel industry to hire high school
graduates to be trained in the "observation corps." Their
titles were changed to "metallurgical engineers" and as
such were deferred from military service. This title indi-
cated more correctly the work which was actually done
by this group. However, these individuals were not grad-
uate engineers and by the end of the war many such

        A riveter walks out on an unfinished end span

 taken by Mr. Hare of the Pitt Photographic
      Library in 1951 while the bridge was still under
      construction.


technical groups had become unionized. Consequently,
the young engineer today is often required to join a union
as he enters the industry.
   This is highly undesirable from the standpoint of de-
 velopment of engineering as a profession and is typical of
 the situation which exists in many other industries besides
 steel. There is a very active trend to unionize the engi-
 neer and mapy of the students now in school will be re-
 quired to join unions as they enter industry. Even though
 he does this, he should constantly remind himself to re-
 tain his engineering skill. As soon as possible, he should
 progress in the company to supervisory work at which
 time he is no longer eligible to remain in the union. At
 that time he should renew his interest in his professional
 status and do all he can to prevent further unionization
 of the engineer.
   The young engineer should not be fooled by the titles
 of the unions which are currently attempting to unionize
 the entire engineering personnel. They nearly all use the
 word "professional" in their titles. For example, there are
 the organizations of: Association of Professional Engi-
 neering Personnel, National Professional Association of
 Engineers, Architects and Scientists, and Northwest Pro-
 fessional Engineers. These organizations will take anyone
 as a member who calls himself an engineer. They do not
 require, for example, a college diploma from an accred-
 ited engineering school nor a State license in professional
 engineering.
   Certainly the trend of engineering education in this
 country is not toward the development of tradesmen. In-
 stead, all colleges today are concerned with the develop-
 ment of engineers who will eventually become high-level
 administrators in industry. It is not fair for the engineer
 who has received his Bachelor of Science degree to join
 a union in fellowship with men who have neither been
 qualified nor willing to undertake the long and difficult
 technical training required of the engineering graduate.
 It is no more fair than for a concert pianist to be required
 to join a musician's union in association with those who
 can play chop-sticks with difficulty.
   Those older engineers who have already attained pro-
fessional status also have a big job to do to prevent fur-
ther unionization of the engineer. Most effective is a cam-
paign to get industry to renew their administrative flow
sheets. Jobs all the way up the ladder should be designated
specifically to be filled only by engineering graduates.
Many channels should be indicated which will direct a
constant flow of engineers to top management. Without
this American industry is even now at a serious cross-road
beyond which there is no return.

   the Concrete Slab


In practical engineering, art can be successfully employed without losing


desirable design characteristics.

  The famous English engineer, Tredgold, once defined
engineering as the art of directing the great sources of
power in Nature for the use and convenience of man.
Through the years, engineers have more than verified
this statement by building dams, power plants and better
roads, by developing new materials and methods of de-
sign. Yet, the art in Tredgold's definition still remains
the "art of directing." In relatively few instances does
the engineer have anything to do with art except this "art
of directing." Usually the art part is left to the architect.
Rarely does the engineer take it upon himself to cast
aside this twentieth century tradition and use his knowl-
edge and precision to dictate outer form as well as inner
stability of the structure. Many times, however, the engi-
neer finds he must take command of a complete design.
In the field of bridge design this is especially true, since a
very high degree of technical knowledge and skill is re-

 quired. When an engineer finds himself in this position
 his usual design would be a truss type bridge, because of
 the ease of design and fabrication.
   A reinforced concrete design is often disregarded be-
 cause of high construction and labor cost. Yet reinforced
 concrete is a material that can be molded to any desired
 shape in order to produce a truly fresh and stimulating
 design. Handbook bridges are usually dull and monoton-
 ous to the eye. A good engineer is not a slave to formulas.
 He is an artist who uses his calculations to produce struc-
 tures that blend into nature's surroundings. One such
 man was a Swiss structural engineer named Robert Mail-
 lart. In Maillart's hands, reinforced concrete was given
 a new role in construction, completely free from its tra-
 ditional use. Maillart was a constant experimenter. The
 results of his experiments and research enhanced his
 knowledge of using the reinforced concrete slab, not only
 as a roadway surface but also as a structural member.
   The reinforced concrete slab is probably the easiest
concrete shape to make. The process consists of mixing
the proper materials with cement and water, pouring
this mixture into wooden forms and allowing it to hard-
en. The steel reinforcing is usually erected and put into
place first. Proper bending and placing of the reinforcing
bars is of utmost importance. Wooden formwork is then
placed around the reinforcing bars. A concrete mix con-
sisting of water, cement, gravel and sand, all blended to-
gether in specified amounts is then poured into the form-
work. When the concrete is hard the formwork is re-
moved. To obtain additional strength, wet burlap sacks
are placed on the slab for a length of time. This is called
curing the concrete.
  It can readily be seen that a great deal of labor must

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER



be used in the construction of reinforced concrete struc-
tures, as illustrated by the fact that this simple slab takes
so many separate operations. The added labor has been a
major argument for the opponents of reinforced concrete
construction. Maillart did most of his work in Switzer-
land where labor is less expensive than it is in this coun-
try. His bridge designs in many instances were chosen in
place of a design in steel because of their unquestionable
economy. Many public officials and judging committees
were unsympathetic to Maillart's unorthodox designs,
and there were times when he had to alter his designs
because of this resentment. The public was used to see-
ing designs imbellished with the traditional architectural
ornamentation. But were Maillart's designs really radi-
cal, or was he just expressing a more efficient and aes-
thetic use of a new material?
  At the turn of the century art was receiving a general
face lifting. Artists were experimenting with various me-
diums with which to express themselves. Impressionism,
cubism, and fauvism were some of the different methods
of expressing their feelings. All of these schools of art
emphasized the new use of an old material, oil paint. It
is not surprising then to find that some engineers were
also searching for a new means of expression with an old
material, concrete. Reinforced concrete was still rela-
tively new. The older engineers believed in making the
structure as thick and massive as possible. They believed
that thick and heavy arches and pillars assured the pub-
lic's confidence in the structure. Thin and light struc-
tures, although more graceful than the massive struc-
tures, caused much public resentment because such a
structure looked as if it were not heavy enough to sup-
port any amount of weight. This has been proven false
time and time again. A light and thin design is in reality
a great deal safer than the thick and heavy design. In
the "thin" design the dead load is reduced considerably,
thereby lowering the weight of the structure. The less
weight the structure has the less it will settle, thus lessen-
ing the chance of setting up stresses in the members.
Also, in a "thin" design the thermal stresses are reduced,
decreasing the possibility of cracking the concrete due to
temperature changes. It was concerning these various
principles that Maillart experimented and designed.
  Robert studied at Eidgenossischen Polytechnikum in
Zurich, Switzerland from 1890 to 1894, receiving his
diploma in Structural Engineering. During the ensuing
years he constantly worked and experimented with rein-
forced concrete designs. In designing a bridge Maillart
eliminated everything that had no function; thus all that
remained was functional. He integrated the roadway slab
with the arch. Many times he turned the slab on its ends
and made it a column. An example of a completely inte-
grated roadway and arch design is the Tavanasa Bridge
over the Rhine (Figure 1) completed in 1905. This bridge
is a box-section three-hinged arch, the box being made


up of reinforced concrete slabs. The roadway comprises
the top section of the box. With this integration Maillart
achieved an aesthetic effect as well as an economic de-
sign. The thinness and lightness of the structure blends
in well with the natural surroundings of the area. The
bridge leaps across the water in one smooth jump. This
bridge was destroyed by a landslide in 1927 and no longer
exists.
  Between the years 1905 and 1933 Maillart built many
bridges and aqueducts, employing the slab as the basic
element of construction. In many situations Maillart used
the slab as a column. The bridge crossing the Thur River
at Henan-Uzeil, Switzerland (Figure 2) is an excellent
example of this. The thin vertical slabs combine with the
horizontal and arch slabs produce a stimulating effect.

  Figure 3: A graceful design crossing the Toss River. Maillart
in 1934.
To eyes schooled at looking at modern art the bridge no
longer remains just a piece of dull, lifeless construction,
but a work of art to be enjoyed by all that travel over, or
pass by, the bridge. Technically speaking, the bridge is
built of twin-hollow ribs and is three-hinged pointed
arch type of construction. In building the bridge the con-
crete centering was used twice.
  Centering is a network of wooden or metal posts so
connected to act like a truss in supporting the weight of
concrete until it has hardened. In building a reinforced
concrete structure the design of the centering is almost
as important as the structure itself. It not only supports
the wet concrete and holds it in place, but also acts as
scaffolding from which the workers can do their work at
high positions on the structure. In constructing a rein-
forced concrete bridge the most important centering is
the arch centering. The more often it can be used the
more economical the structure will be.
  Maillart's extreme care in trying to effect economy can
be seen in all of his work, and in simplifying his bridges,
he also achieved a lighter bridge and created a beautiful
work of art. The slender slabs enhance this beauty. Mod-

:mates, as well as data with regard to capacities, outputs,
and operating costs takes place, in most cases, at plant
level, with operating, maintenance, and engineering
forces participating.
  Under the supervision of plant management and with
the assistance and guidance of the general office staff,
budgets are prepared and appropriation requests are
written, Upon executive authorization, specifications and
designs are completed, contracts are executed, orders are
placed, and construction is carried out. This work is al-
most entirely the function of the plant engineering de-
partment.
  For example, in Central Operations the development
of a proposal to add a series of new annealing furnaces
would, after approval of management, be taken in hand
by the Chief Engineer who would first assign Project
Engineering to the task of investigating the proposal.
The Project Engineer's report would include specific de-
tails as to estimated cost, location, added productive
capacity, materials, safety improvements and required
construction time for the proposed addition.
   This report would be studied carefully by top manage-
ment, and, if approved, would be given to Design Engi-
neering for preparation of plans for the project. Cou-
struction Engineering would direct the work, with Con-
trol Engineering looking on to ensure that the approved
plans are followed. The operation of the equipment,
after it is built, would fall within the responsibility of
engineers in operations and in maintenance. In short,
engineers are needed to plan and build, and then to oper-
ate and maintain.
   The high degree of mechanization in steel mills has
 made it necessary for the maintenance department to
 make sizable increases in the number of engineers in-
 cluded among its personnel. It is estimated that the cost,
 per employee, of building and equipping a modern inte-
 grated steel plant is about $75,000. Thus it is imperative
 that capable engineers be available to ensure continued
 efficient operation of facilities and to make improvements
 on equipment wherever possible.
   The growth and importance of research activities in
 U. S. Steel have strongly paralleled the growth of the
 Corporation as one of the world's major producing or-
 ganizations. A system of planning and executing investi-
 gations has supplanted the former, and often more spec-
 tacular method of research at random. Today, most in-
 dustrial research is conducted in orderly sequence that
 begins with a group conference of experts in a certain


field and arrival at a working hypothesis. This is followed
by critical experimentation which continues until the
hypothesis is either declared impractical, or leads to re-
sults which may be crystallized into a new or improved
discovery or idea.
  Many opportunities exist in this field for graduates in
various branches of engineering, particularly those whose
talents and inclinations direct them into the more scien-
tific engineering activities.
  The research activities in U. S. Steel now are concen-
trated largely in the laboratories at Pittsburgh, Pa.,
Kearny, New Jersey, and in the laboratories of some of
the Divisions and Associated Companies at other loca-
tions. Early in August of this year, ground was broken
for a Research Center to be located in a rural area of
Allegheny County, near Pittsburgh. The new Center,
which will have combined floor area approximately 132,-
000 square feet in its three buildings, is expected to be
completed late in 1954.
   "In the new Research Center, U. S. Steel's scientists
and technologists will be able to carry out more efficient-
ly the traditional practice of developing better steels for
our customers," B. F. Fairless, Chairman of the Board,
said at the time these new research facilities were an-
nounced.
   Engineers are needed in small numbers in Corporation
activities, other than steel-producing, which are equally
essential to the efficient and profitable conduct of busi-
ness. Some engineers are required in transportation oper-
ations including the giant steamers moving iron ore from
the Mesabi range in Minnesota to Great Lake ports for
reshipment to the plants; and the river boats used to
transport coal and other raw materials.
   Engineers are employed, to some extent, in the sales,
accounting and purchasing departments performing du-
ties which may require considerable technological train-
ing. Also, experienced engineers are added periodically
to the General Offices Engineering staff which assists
plant engineering departments, and serves as a coordin-
ating force for engineering activities throughout U. S.
Steel.
   Opporunities for engineers are available also in the
coal mining operations of U. S. Steel, whose entire pro-
duction is used in the Corporation's manufacturing pro-
cesses. Here, the safety aspect of engineering plays an
important role, since rigid safety standards and the in-
creasing use of machinery in mines have combined to
create many new opportunities for engineers.
   The various states have enacted legislation setting
forth standards for training and experience requirements
of supervisory personnel. Mining engineers who aspire to
supervisory positions within the mines must, in several

considered in building a radio-controlled model


BY THOMAS WIDMER, M.E. '54


   Shortly before World War II, military men became
interested in the possibility of remotely controlling air-
craft by radio. Some experimental work had been done
by model plane builders in the late 1930's, but the equip-
ment available had been too bulky and unreliable for
consistent operation. This preliminary investigation by
amateurs, however, provided a starting point for full
scale war time research into the problems of radio control.
Because of the intensive study conducted by the govern-
ment since that time, the modern guided missiles, auto-
matic landing devices, and pilotless drones have been
developed. Model builders have benefited from this re-
search, and now have at their disposal a variety of com-
mercial radio installations as well as components for
building original circuits. Recognizing the value of the
work being done by model plane designers, the Federal
Communications Commission recently approved the use
of two free radio bands exclusively for the unlicensed
operators. Now it is possible to design and fly radio con-
trolled planes without the trouble of obtaining an ama-
teur radio transmitter license. This article will be con-
cerned with some important elements in the process of
designing such a plane specifically for radio control.
  The first and most important consideration is inherent
stability. Inherent stability means that the plane must fly
itself when no control is being applied. Obviously, if the
principal forces acting on the plane are correctly ar-

  ranged, stability will result. It follows then, that the
  position of the center of gravity, thrust line, center of
  lateral area and maximum wing camber will influence
  stability. Other factors such as airfoil shape, angle of at-
  tack, nose and tail moment arms, and dihedral angle
  must also enter into the design analysis. Principal centers
  and lines of action in this particular design were located
  according to figure 1. It would be difficult to show how
  each detail of the layout was determined, but an analysis
  of the effect of location of each force center will help to
  explain why the position was chosen, and serve as a ref-
  erence for a designer in formulating his own force layout.
    Location of all forces should be with respect to the
  thrust line of the power plant and the moments of the
  forces about the center of gravity must be balanced for
  equilibrium. Wing incidence (angle of attack) must be
  kept slight in the design in order to reduce climbing angle
  under full power and prevent stalls. The maximum cam-
  ber of the airfoil is unusually far back on the wing chord
  so that the resultant lift exerts a nose-down moment
  about the center of gravity, further assuring a shallow
  climb with longitudinal stability. Both of these nose-down
  moments are required to balance the nose-up couple
  caused by the drag of the wing and the thrust of the
  power plant. It is best to minimize the latter by passing
  the thrust line through the center of gravity as is done in
  this design.

   A number of devices are employed to assure lateral
 and directional stability. One of these, the effect known
 as washout, gives extremely stable flight at low speeds.
 Washout is the term applied to warping a wing panel so
 that its angle of incidence with respect to the engine
 thrustline is decreased near the tips. The warp must be
 built into the structure before covering is applied to
 insure accuracy and equality of angle on both wings.
 Because of their lesser angle of attack to the airstream,
 the wing tips will still be flying at a favorable incidence
 to provide lift, even though the rest of the wing may be
 in a stall with no ability to generate lift. Since the wing

tips can still maintain stability, even in a stall, the plane
will drop smoothly into a normal flight path without the
tendency to fall off on one wing and develop a spin. Fur-
ther lateral stability in turning is supplied by the low cen-
ter of lateral area which causes a force arrangement like
that shown below. Another effect which must be com-

pensated for to provide lateral stability is the engine

   Selecting the relative lengths of nose and tail moment
arms is mostly a matter of experience. It is generally safe
in radio control models to make the tail-moment equal to
twice the nose-moment and 40% of the wingspan, so that
the turning effect of a small rudder will give adequate
control of the plane. For these moment arms, a stabilizer
of 30% of wing area and a fin of 8% wing area provides
sufficient longitudinal and directional stability. Wing di-
hedral angle as well as aspect ratio (wing span divided by
wing chord) must be moderate so that the plane will not
resist banking in turns with only rudder controls applied.
An aspect ratio of 5 or 6 to 1 and a dihedral rise of 3/4
inch per foot of span is usually a safe combination for
radio control planes. It must be remembered, however,
that the details mentioned here are only starting points
for the prospective designer. Every individual will foster
original theories about force arrangements and design
layouts after he has conducted tests and actually flown
radio controlled planes.


  Once the relative proportions of a particular design
have been agreed upon, the next step is to select the wing
and power loadings which will produce a precise flight
path. A good design must be able to fly under adverse
weather and still be controllable. Wind and thermal
updrafts have a tendency to take control of a small plane,
so that it is necessary to have a fast sinking speed in the
glide. In order to stay in sight of the transmitter opera-
tor, the plane may have to fly into a strong wind, even
while gliding with power off. Furthermore, the rate of
climb under power must be slow so that the plane will
not quickly fly out of sight overhead. These requirements
point to the necessity of high loadings in a successful de-
sign. In spite of any past experience with wing and power
loadings, a designer must realize that for the particular
functions of a radio model, weight is an important re-
quirement.
  A wing loading of 20 ounces per square foot of wing
area was chosen for the design described in this article.
Since the weight of radio equipment amounted to 19
ounces, a total weight of 3 times that amount, or 57
ounces was anticipated as the gross flying weight of the
completed plane with adequate structure. This estimate
of a 33% payload was made on the basis of past experi-
ence, but should serve as an index to the load carrying
ability of most heavily constructed models.. The esti-
mated weight and loading determined a necessary wing
area of about 3 square feet, or 432 square inches. Aspect
ratio, having been placed from stability considerations at
about 5/2 to 1, fixed the wing span at 49 inches and the
average chord at 8.8 inches.
Span X Chord - Area and Span/Chord = Aspect Ratio
              - 432                   -5.5
The 40% tail-moment arm of 19.6 inches requires a 9.8
inch nose moment, fixing the overall dimensions of the
fuselage at 19.6 plus 9.8 plus /2 (Stabilizer Chord) or
about 33 inches. Obviously, depth and width of the
fuselage must be sufficient to accommodate the proposed
radio installation, but these dimensions should be kept to

a minimum to reduce drag on the fuselage frontal area.
   Having determined the overall size and weight of the
 plane, the designer must select a powerplant on the basis
 of desirable power loading. Since the requirements are
 slow climb and equal power-on and power-off flight
 speeds, a high power loading is specified. Through ex-
 perience, a loading of about 500 ounces per cubic inch of
 piston displacement has proven ideal. Using this loading,
 an engine displacement of 57 ounces/500 ounces per
 cubic inch, or .114 cubic inches was found. The nearest

 diesel of .12 cubic inch displacement was used; but any
 of the high speed glow plug or diesel engines from .09 to
 .14 cuubic inch may be used successfully in a plane of
 this size. A low pitch propeller of large blade area must
 be used on such a heavily loaded plane to give sufficient
 thrust for take-off. Although various pitch and diameter
 combinations must be tried in flight on any particular
 design before a final selection can be made, a good start-
 ing point would be a wide bladed eleven inch diameter
 propeller with 4 or 5 inches of pitch. It is important to
 remember that every individual engine will have its own
 special requirements for propellers, and the designer must
 experiment to find the best combination for his power-
 plant.
   From the series of requirements for stability and pre-
 cision, the definite proportions and size of the airplane
 have been developed. With these factors determined, it
 remains for the designer to lay out the actual structure.
 Because of its high strength to weight ratio hard balsa
 was selected for most of the structural elements in this
 design. Oak spars and spruce plywood bulkheads were
 used at points of heavy stress concentration.
   Since the flying qualities of a plane depend largely on
 the wing and tail surfaces, these parts must be accurately
 constructed to prevent unwanted warps. Hard balsa ribs
 are cut to the airfoil shape and spaced no further than
 22 inches apart along a series of three or four oak spars
 running span wise of the wing and tail. A .hard balsa
 leading edge is notched into the nose of each rib, and the
 front of the airfoil to about 1/3 chord is planked with
 1/16 inch hard veneer. An overlapping sheet balsa cover
 completes the trailing edge of the airfoil. Balsa cap strips
 1/16 inch deep by 4 inch wide are fitted between the
 leading edge planking and the trailing edge cover to
 provide a wide surface of attachment for the covering.
 After all the joints have been glued twice and have
 thoroughly dried, a light grade of silk is doped over the
 entire surface and shrunk taut with clear laquer. At the
 center section of the wing where the longitudinal spars
 must be cut to fit the dihedral angle, heavy reinforce-
 ment is necessary. Plywood overlays are applied to each
 spar joint and the whole connection wrapped securely in

linen tape soaked with slow setting glue. Flying surfaces
must be attached to the fuselage in such a way that they
will not be damaged in rough landings. Some form of
shock mounting is usually used. Elastic bands stretched
over the center section of the wing and tail and attached
to pegs in the fuselage will allow the surfaces to be
knocked free in a crash.
  In order to hold the flying surfaces in their proper
position and protect the radio equipment, the fuselage
should be a strongly built unit. Fuselage structure must


be solid enough to protect the radio receiver from dam-
age in a crash landing. For this reason the fuselage is
built around a strong oak-framed central cage which
houses the controls directly under the wing. Four oak
longerons are attached, two to each side of the cage and
reaching from the engine firewall to the rudder post.
Plywood bulkheads are placed at 4 inch intervals along
the entire length of the fuselage longerons. Oak engine
mounting beams anchor to the first 3 plywood bulkheads,
and the landing gear assemblies are bolted to the second
and fifth bulkheads.
  The landing gear, an important part of tbe fuselage
structure, must be well designed to absorb most of the
shock of landing without damaging the framework of
the airplane. In tricycle landing gear systems, which are
desirable for their stable ground handling characteristics,
the nose wheel assembly must be carefully constructed to
keep landing impact from reaching the main fuselage
structure. Usually some system of springs or elastic bands
is used to absorb this shock. Any flexible installation will
work well.
  Thus far, only the airplane itself has been considered.
Anyone interested in model planes, however, would have
to decide on some control system, either of original de-
sign or commercial. Since so many good reliable systems
are available, it is hardly worthwhile for the novice to
attempt construction of an original unit until he has
gained considerable flying experience. Commercial radio
apparatus may be bought for either of the two license
free bands, 465 megacycles and 27.255 megacycles. A
description of one such radio system, the Citizenship
Control, points out the various parts needed and their
approximate cost.
  Citizenship 465 MC Receiver: A complete radio fre-
quency signal generator with a plug in antennae and
built in battery compartment. This unit is normally held
in the hand while flying and it sells for $39.75.
  Citizenship 465MC Receiver: A complete single tube
receiving system including built in loop antennae and
relay.
Weight 5/2 ounces. Price $29.95
  Citizenship escapement: A light weight sequence servo
for operating the control surface; powered by rubber
band drive and controlled by the relay of the receiver
through a built in coil and armature.
Weight 1 ounce. Price $9.95
  Citizenship combined RC Test meter: A complete DC
meter for checking battery voltages and receiver tube
plate current.
Price $19.95
Batteries Required:
Transmitter:  2-67/2 volt 'B' cells..............  $5.20
              1-6 volt 'A' cell ................. $ .90
Receiver: 2-30 volt 'B' cells.................. $4.00
          4-1/2  volt 'A' cells................. $ .60
Escapement: 2-V1/2 volt cells.................. $  .30
Life of 'B' batteries is about two to four months depend-
ing on use. Filament batteries (A cells) should be re-
placed before every day's flying. Voltage of all cells under
load must be checked before every flight to prevent fail-
ure in flight.
  In addition to the cost of the radio equipment, the final
cost of the model is made up of such items as construction
materials (wood, glue, laquer, dope, hardware, engine
and accessories, wheels, etc.). Usually, a completed plane
represents an investment of about 200 dollars worth of
parts and 100 to 150 hours of work. The value of such a
plane, however, can only be measured by the experience
which the builder gains in learning by doing.

                                      Dr. David Halliday received all his education at the
                                    University of Pittsburgh, his undergraduate program
                                    being in the Engineering School. During the war he was
                                    active in the development of radar devices at the Radia-
                                    tion Laboratory at M.I.T. In 1946 he returned to the
                                    University and is now head of the Physics Department.
                                    He is the author of a text-book in nuclear physics and
                      X             co-author of two other books. He is interested in nuclear
                                    and solid state physics and has published some fifteen
                                    research papers. This article was written by special re-
Halliday                            quest.


Close harmony helps these related scientists to flourish.


  The urge to put labels on people or things is deep-
seated in most of us. Labels unfortunately often conceal
bewildering variety and suggest cast iron permanence
where change and development are the order of the day.
A scholar from the middle west has just told us, at $8.00
a copy, that there is no such person as an average woman.
Neither is there an average engineer or an average physi-
cist! There are physicists who work on relativity theory,
physicists who design computing machines and physicists
who dream up new treads for automobile tires. There are
engineers who work in the highly mathematical field of
information theory, engineers who design cyclotrons and
engineers who sell machine tools. In short, if you seek a
sharp boundary between these fields you will not find it;
neither will you find a "typical behaviour pattern" in
either field, even if you are a social-psychologist! We are
dealing with two whirlpools in the ocean of knowledge
which merge continuously into each other and whose
substance, ever changing, flows from one to the other,
sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another.
(If we must have metaphors, let us not stint ourselves.)
  We must not deny however that we can recognize in
each field a few characteristic central ideas. The physi-
cist, for example, works at the edge of existing knowl-
edge; he looks for new facts or tries to find hidden rela-
tionships among facts that others have found; he contin-
ually scrutinizes the structure of law and theory that
has been built up through the years and tries to "boil it
down" knowing, as he does, that man does not always
see the beautiful simplicity of nature the first time he
looks at it.
  All of this good and necessary work has this important
feature: you can never predict beforehand what you are
going to find when you start an investigation. You must
deliberately avoid the temptation of a fixed goal but


must be motivated by curiosity, by the explorer's itch
to be the first man into new territory. This sounds very
inefficient and unbusinesslike but indeed it is not. Planned
or programmed science is sterile science as the Russians
have learned where they have tried it. If someone had
said to Maxwell, "Please develop a device that will allow
the voice of a man to be heard around the world," would
he have discovered the principles of radio? If someone
had said to Roentgen in 1898, "Please make something
to help surgeons to set broken bones," would he have dis-
covered X-rays? Tinkering in physics laboratories in the
1930's led, for better or for worse but, in either case, most
unexpectedly, to atomic energy. Basic research in solid
state physics at the Bell Telephone Laboratories led to
the transistor. Incidentally, profits from transistor sales
in two years alone have already paid the entire cost of
operation of this large laboratory from the day of its
founding; that sounds very businesslike to me. This tech-
nique of the construction of a body of theory based on ex-
periment, the whole guided by the free play of curiosity
and intuition, is actually not very old. Galileo, who
worked about 1600 A.D., can be said to be the first physi-
cist. We have but to think of the pyramids to realize that
engineering is much older. The oldest profession has al-
ready been spoken for but certainly engineering has a
good claim on second place.
  What now of the modern engineer? His job is to take
the basic relationships of science and put them to work
for the benefit of man. This is an inspiring mission and
one that calls for ingenuity of the highest order. The en-
gineer must improve the old and devise the new. Effici-
ency is his watchwold and he can never afford to be satis-
fied. There is real beauty in, say, a transformer or a
machine part that has been perfectly designed for maxi-
mum efficiency and minimum cost. The beauty only

Ac~


     College boys, graduating with technical degrees
   never had it so good. Industry woos them. Pay
   often starts at $400 a month.

     Are these youngsters any better than their fa-
   thers-or as good? How long will the demand last
   for engineers? What other fields look promising
   as careers?
     Answers to these above questions are given in
   the following interview with Maynard M. Boring,
   manager of the General Electric Company's Tech-
   nical Personnel Divisions.

     Mr. Boring has interviewed more than 100,000
   students for jobs since 1922.

     "Reprinted from 'U. S. News & World Report,' an in-
   dependent weekly news magazine published in Washing-
   ton, D. C. Copyright 1953. United States News Publishing
   Corporation."


   Q Just how high are starting salaries for college
graduates these days, Mr. Boring?
  A Well, the national average of 200 companies last
spring was about $325 per month. The lowest we heard
of was $278 a month and the highest was about $450.
Now, this year, the average is about $350, with some
cases of $500 a month and up being reported. That $350
average is the starting salary for a typical 21-year-old
bachelor in engineering. It doesn't seem possible to some
of the old-timers who got out in the depression.
  Q What about accountants, lawyers, other graduates?
  A They don't get the premiums that the engineering
and science graduates are collecting these days, of course.
The good technical man has always had an edge, in start-
ing salary, over other college graduates. But graduates in
all fields are doing very well-except those going into
teaching. The teaching pay scale is still low.
  Q Are pay rates still headed up?
  A Starting rates apparently are stabilizing a bit, now.
  Q What about the Ph.D's?
  A The average going rate for a Ph.D. as green as grass
is about $6,800 a year. That is for one who has done noth-
ing but go to school for a number of years.

  Maynard M. Boring, manager of General Electric Company's
Technical Personnel Divisions, being interviewed in the Con-
ference rooms of U. S. News and World Report.

  Q Is that more than the professors average?
  A Yes, and that causes a serious problem-some stu-
dents are going out and making more than their profes-
sors are making and the profs want to go along.
  Q Do the college boys feel pretty independent when
they are in such short supply?
  A They do, indeed.
  Q Is there a nation-wide shortage of young tech-
nicians?
  A Yes, I am chairman of the Survey Committee of
Engineers Joint Council, which is supposed to keep its
fingers on supply and demand of technical people. A
year ago our survey indicated the country was short about
80,000 engineers. The shortage is less now because indus-
try has learned to do a better job in using the engineers
it has, and because the tooling up for defense is fairly
well along.
  Our latest survey indicates that we should have a sup-
ply of about 30,000 new graduate engineers each year for
normal industry operation, plus another 10,000 to 12,000

graduates to take care of defense needs. That's a total of
about 42,000 needed. The colleges are actually gradu-
ating about 21,000 this year.
  Q Those are engineers alone?
  A Yes. As for scientists, there are about half the num-
ber of scientists in the country as there are engineers, and
the shortage of scientists is just about as serious.
  Q So engineering is still a very promising field for a
young man to enter?
  A Extremely so. The long-term trend still favors the
engineer. In 1890, we had 290 workers for each engineer.
Now, we have 50 workers per engineer. Today's defense
effort, the advent of atomic energy, the increase in en-
gineered things that go in our homes-all-electric kitch-
ens and so on-all make for a tremendous rise in the
amount of engineering needed.
   It's a very complex problem to provide the scientific
and engineering man power needed for this expanding
nation.


  Job failures are not from lack of technical ability, but in-
ability to handle the human-relations problem.

  Q Are the schools at capacity now?
  A No, not in the upper classes. The freshman load is
very heavy, however. In the high schools they have been
encouraging too many unqualified students to go into
engineering. We haven't been selecting them carefully
enough.
  Q The attrition rate among freshmen is pretty high?
  A Yes-above normal. One of the reasons for the high
losses at the beginning college level is that the boys are
not properly prepared in today's high schools.
  Q High schools do not offer enough math and sci-
ence?
  A Well, the subjects are there, but with so-called
progressive education, we have been losing sight of two
of the most fundament things that we ought to teach our
children; that is, to work and to think. When you make
everything a game, as they do in the present secondary
education, and when they emphasize so-called social
studies which require very little thinking, it just is not
very good training.
  Various signs show up. At the Oregon State College,
for instance, 56 per cent of the students who applied for
engineering were deficient in mathematics. We find at
the University of Illinois, as an example, that they are
having a terrible time. The high-school students just
can't handle the work. At City College in New York they
told me recently that, of 432 students who applied for
engineering, 300 couldn't handle the work. Another
place says 70 per cent of its beginning engineering stu-
dents are deficient. A survey made by the U. S. Office of
Education last year shows that, in the 28,000 high schools


in the United States, less than 20 per cent of the young-
sters are taking any mathematics beyond arithmetic. Less
than 15 per cent are taking chemistry. Less than 5 per
cent are taking physics. And yet, we expect a heavy drift
of those people to go into science and engineering.
  Many will just not be ready for it, unless there is some
work done at the high-school level.
  Q Do we need more technological high schools?
  A Yes. However, I do not think it is necessary to build
a lot of new school buildings. We have the facilities. We
are terribly short of teachers, largely because the pay
scale is relatively low. New York State alone is short of
1,700 science teachers. We as a nation are going to have
to recognize that we are processing the most valuable
raw material we have, our young people. And, if we
don't get busy and make it attractive for both men and
women to go in for education, we are liable to fall flat on
our faces, especially since the evidence is very clear that
Russia is producing many scientists, possibly with longer
training than ours.
  Q In your experience over the years, have the atti-
tudes of these youngsters changed? Do they make poor-
er engineers now, or better ones?
  A I would say basically they are better. I am all for
the young fellow of today. I think he is two-fisted, willing
to fight for his rights-sometimes too much so. I believe
our future is assured as long as we keep on driving to im-
prove their education. Most of the things they have
trouble with are things they should have learned at their
mothers' knees when they were 5 or 6 years old.
  Q Do they need more coddling? Will they work as
hard?
  A I would say at the time they get out of school they
are very cocky. They are in the driver's seat at the mo-
ment. But it doesn't take very long to get them down to
normal, and by giving them a good example and by
throwing a job at them that has to be done in a specific
time, they blunder through and get it done.
  Q Do your engineers get enough of the humanities-
do they know why they are doing the things they are
doing?
  A No, that is one of the lessons that we have neglected
most. Since I've been in this game I have brought in over
12,000 men and I've known them all pretty well. I have
never seen one fail through lack of technical ability
Their failures are always in their inability to handle the
human-relations problem in one form or another. And,
as you trace down the difficulties of the man, you usually
find it's the women of the men who cause the trouble.
Basically, we always hire not a man, but a family. And
money worries, sickness, quarrels at home always affect
the job.
   Q Do you get draft deferments for some graduates?
   A Yes, we do. We are getting excellent consideration
from Selective Service boards when we present an honest
case-and they are the only kind we will present.
   Q What do you call an "honest" deferment?
   A There are any number of them. Let's look back at
one which is a little spectacular, but typical. During
World War II we developed-and I can give you parallel
instances today-a gadget known as a "flight engineer,"
a synchronizing device for tying the motors of a four-
motored bomber together.
   We were asked to send a fellow over to England to
show the British how to use this. We had a bad time with
Selective Service because we had to send a fellow 23 years
old. The reason we sent this boy is that in his mind, and
in another mind of the ripe old age of 26, was all the
information in the United States on this gadget.
                                (continued on next page)


JANUARY, 1954



   Q And there are similar instances today?
   A Many. Jet engines and the electronic business are
young men's games all the way.
   Q How do you request deferment in a typical case?
   A We tell the boy's local board what our plans are for
the boy. We are likely to have any number of spots where
an engineer is needed and we tell the board exactly what
the man is going to do. By and large, the boards have
been very fair with us. They turn down about 20 per
cent of our requests.
  We do lose some tough ones, of course. One boy is go-
ing into service next month. He was a Purdue graduate,
very capable, with all the specifications, and his specialty
is guided missiles, as critical as anything we have in the
country.
  Yet, his local board, the State appeal board and the
national appeal board have thrown him into 1-A. So that
is the end of that fight. Snooping around to find out
what was wrong in this case, we discovered that appar-
ently there was an anonymous letter in the boy's draft
folder-and there are in a great many-where someone
made the remark: "My boy had to go, why shouldn't
this guy?" And the whole deferment system breaks down,
and he goes. But that case is a rare exception, really.
  Q You say there are about 21,000 engineers gradu-
ating this spring?
  A Yes.
  Q About how many will you get for civilian industry,
after the draft and ROTC take their shares?
  A About 10,000. That will be the total of engineers
available to the 5,200 companies that are recruiting engi-
neers and other specialists this spring. My company comes
along to look for 600 men, Westinghouse needs some. So
do A.T.&T., General Motors, RCA and all the others.
We're all in the same boat.
  Q About the men who go directly to military duty-
are they used in scientific and engineering branches, or
do most of them end up in the infantry?
  A The military gives some attention to putting men
where they can best serve, but there are many cases where
this isn't done. There is no question but that we could do
a much better job at the reception centers in identifying
these young people and then trying to use what they have
to the best advantage.
  Q Does the average man forget what he learned at
college after two years in service?
  A No.
  Q You have seen many come back?
  A Yes, and by and large those who have done some
kind of technical work while in service are right up to
date and in good shape. Those who come back from the
infantry or similar assignments have learned other things
that help toward maturity, so that eventually they bal-
ance out. Some of the boys are pretty bitter about their
experiences, of course.
  Q About the loss of time?
  A That's right.
  Q Is a boy coming back from service better off to go
right into private industry, or should he go back to
school for a year or two to brush up?
  A You have to generalize in answering that question.
But, broadly speaking, I feel that too many boys are going
out for graduate work. The average man might be better
off to jump right into a job.
  Q Do you pay a returning veteran more than you offer
the youngster just coming out of college?
  A Yes, we're trying to balance out his military experi-
ence. I think the idea is spreading very rapidly through-
out industry: We've got to recognize that we cannot
penalize the people who fight our wars. So, what we are


trying to do is to adjust the rate, to give a man credit for
service time, to bring him up closer to his own age group
inside our organization.
   Q You don't give exactly as much credit for two
 years in the military as for two years with your company?
   A No, but we give enough so that in a relatively short
 time they will balance up. The greater maturity of the
 boys coming back from service, especially those who have
 been in battle, tends to offset the gain made by those who
 stay at home, rather quickly.
   Q Aren't many technically trained people coming
 back from service now, with their two years completed?
   A Yes, but one problem we have is trying to find these
 fellows at the military separation centers. If there is a
 basic plan for assisting these men to find jobs, I haven't
 seen any evidence of it. And, judging from their con-
 versations, many of these returning boys are resentful be-
 cause they haven't seen any evidence of planning either.
   Q Why shouldn't they go out looking for jobs on
 their own?
   A They are, but this is the problem: The youngster
 has been away from home for two years, he wants to get
 out of the mess and back home as quick as he can, so he
 just ups and bolts for home. And that means that these
 boys are scattering to every town and hamlet in the coun-
 try before we have a chance to contact them and get
 them interested in jobs where they are needed most.
   Our military must set up some pattern to give these
 boys-the college graduates with technical training-a
 free flow back through to industry.
   Here is a special twist on the situation: Last October
 and November, when large numbers of the first Korean
 draftees and Reservists were coming home, we were not
 permitted to interview any of these people at the separa-
 tion center until Civil Service was all through with them.
   Civil Service recruiters made some very interesting
 offers-at taxpayers' expense, of course.
   As an example, a boy who had had less than 18 months
 of military service was started off at $410 a month. If he
 had over 18 months, it was $492. In addition to that, at
 Monmouth, N. J., for instance, the boy was offered the
 opportunity to go to Rutgers University at $5.50 a credit
 hour for his masters' and doctor's degrees, half on Gov-
 ernment time and half on his own time, and the Govern-
 ment paying all the rest in order to keep him on that
 same job. He had an obligation to stay on the job 10
 months after he got his doctor's degree.
   Q What was the job?
   A He may have been working on some gadget for the
 Signal Corps, as an example. They like to keep the same
 fellow on the same job. So they tried to turn him from
 the military to the Civil Service, using as bait this op-
 portunity to get the advanced degree with subsidized
 schooling.
   Q So the Army is skimming the cream of the crop as
 the boys come home?
   A They are trying to-I don't think they are too suc-
 cessful.
   Q Are they offering higher pay than industry?
   A Sure. The average offer in industry is about $350,
 and they offer $410 as a minimum.
   Q We've talked mostly about engineers-what about
 other fields?
   A As far as technically trained people are concerned,
 it's all the same. Demand is much higher than supply.
 That applies in any of the so-called physical sciences:
 physics, chemistry, metallurgy, ceramics, and so on.
   Q Are many boys with engineering training leaving
 th field because it doesn't pay enough?
                                 (continued on page 42)

 from the engineering school dashing
 through the corridors of a hospital
 in the Medical Center of the Univer-
 sity of Pittsburgh, don't be startled or
 confused. No, he is not a patient nor
 has he transferred to the medical
 school. He is probably gathering data
 for a flow diagram or a process chart
 in an attempt to improve and sim-
 plify present inefficient practices
 utilized in hospitals.
 The Industrial Engineering De-
 partment has accepted the dhallenge
 of work simplification in hospitals by
 contributing to the HOSPITAL SCIEN-
 TIFIC MANAGEMENT PROGRAM at the
 University of Pittsburgh. The prime
 targets of this program may be sum-
 mated as follows:
   Target I-Economy of opera-
 tion, the same goal of the indus-
 trial executive. Despite what seems
 to be exorbitant hospital fees, most
 hospitals are not self sustaining.
   Target II-Better patient care,
 probably the more important ob-
 jective.
 Impetus for this project resulted
 from  the  WORK    SIMPLIFICATION
 CONFERENCE conducted at the Uni-
versity of Connecticut in July, 1952.
The conference, which was spon-


sored by the Kellogg Foundation, in-
cluded 29 participants from various
areas of the country. The nucleus of
this group was composed of Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh hospital and nurs-
ing administrators, and representa-
tives from the Schools of Pharmacy,
Business Administration, and Engi-
neering. Also in attendance were rep-
resentatives from Wayne University,
U. S. Air Force Nursing Corps, U. S.
Department of Public Health, Mon-
tefiore Hospital, Shadyside Hospital,
Veterans Hospital of Aspinwall, Uni-
versity of Michigan, and University
of Connecticut.
  This meeting was precipitated by
a series of discussions between Dean
Ruth P. Kuehn, School of Nursing
at the University of Pittsburgh, and
Dr. Lillian Gilbreth, wife of the late
Frank B. Gilbreth, the "Father of
Methods Engineering." Mr. Gilbreth
had done motion study pioneering
work in hospitals during the early
twenties, but his untimely death re-
sulted in his projects being held in
abeyance for several decades.
  The dual purpose of the Con-
necticut Conference was, first, to ac-
quaint the hospital and nursing ad-
ministrators with some of the basic
tools which had been utilized ad-
vantageously by the industrial engi-


neer in industry and, secondly, to
have these administrators evaluate
the feasibility of their application in
hospitals. It would be fruitless to de-
sign a program of motion economy
for hospitals if the administrators
were apathetic to the procedures em-
ployed. However, it was concluded
unanimously that the industrial engi-
neer can perform a great service in
the hospital field.
  In the 1952-53 fall semester3 the
Industrial Engineering Department
initiated a basic work simplification
course specifically for hospital per-
sonnel. The following breakdown of
the class members reveals the inter-
est of key hospital personnel in a
scientific method of economizing hos-
pital operation.
Director of Nursing Education... 4
Director of Nursing Service...... 7
Assistant Director of Nursing
  Service  ....................  5
Hospital Supervisors ........... 4
Public Health Nursing.......... 2
Faculty, University of Pitts-
  burgh School of Nursing...... 8
  Enthusiasm was high throughout
the course. In fact, many excellent
scientific management projects crys-
tallized as a concomitant of this
course.
  Concluding, it must be realized
that industrial engineering is not a
panacea to the wiping out of the red
figures on the balance sheet of a hos-
pital. But, this branch of engineering
can render a valuable service to the
hospital administrator in his unsati-
able desire to improve patient care
as well as to reduce operating costs.
  While this article expounds on the
industrial engineer in hospitals, it
should be emphasized that other
branches of engineering have also
spearheaded projects in the human-
itarian field. Yes, the engineers have
proven that their training and ex-
perience are of intrinsic value in the
non-industrial areas as well as in in-
dustry.

You may not see it in their outward
appearances - but there's a big dif-
ference between these young men.
One has held three jobs in the five
years since graduation. He's still
looking for a job that offers him a
lifetime career. The other has been
with a Bell Telephone Company dur-
ing that time. He's on his way up!
  Seventy-five per cent of college
men hired by the Bell Telephone
Companies since World War II are
still with these telephone companies
after five years! Here's why:
Telephone Work Is Interesting- As
an engineer, you'll be planning tele-
phone facilities or supervising construc-
tion, installation and maintenance.


You'll work with the newest develop-
ments in electronics and communica-
tions as you help expand and improve
the world's best telephone service.
There Are Places to Go-Each year
the number of college people hired is
related to estimates of the number of
future management positions expected
to be available. We are looking to the
future-yours and ours.
You Grow with a Growing Business
-The Bell System is one of the fastest
growing businesses in the world. Since
the end of World War II, it has spent
about nine billion dollars for new con-
struction. The past five years have seen
the introduction of network TV trans-
mission, dialing of Long Distance calls
and the development of the remarkable
transistor.

              BELL TELEPHONE


You'll Be Happy-Not only because
of the interesting and rewarding work,
but for many other reasons. For in-
stance, Bell Telephone Companies are
located in all parts of the country. So
you may be able to start where you
want to live. And what about salaries?
It is the basic policy of the telephone
companies to pay salaries that compare
favorably with those positions of similar
responsibility in other fields.
  No matter what your military
status, it's worth inquiring about
Bell System employment opportu-
nities. Your Placement Officer has
the details. And be sure to talk to
our employment representatives
when they visit the campus. The
time to plan your future is now!

    This is an aluminum

   buildings in 1953. Twenty
        years ago, it was just an idea in the
  mind of an Alcoa development engineer. Ten
      years ago, only a few thousand were made
    annually. Now, production is increasing
       at the rate of over half a million a year.
 This is just one of a torrent of new uses for
      aluminum which means that Alcoa must
   continue to expand. Consider the opportunities
        for you if you choose to grow with us.

  What can this mean

  as a career for you?

This is a production chart . . . shows the millions of
pounds of aluminum produced by Alcoa each year be-
tween 1935 and 1952. Good men did good work to
create this record. You can work with these same men,
learn from them and qualify yourself for continually
developing opportunities. And that production curve-
is still rising, we're still expanding, and opportunities
for young men joining us now are almost limitless.
  Ever-expanding Alcoa needs engineers, metallurgists,
and technically minded "laymen" for production, re-
search and sales positions. If you graduate soon, if you
want to be with a dynamic company that's "going
places", get in touch with us. Benefits are many, stability
s a matter of proud record, opportunities are unlimited.

  During the 1953-54 fall semester
the student chapter of the A.I.E.E.
and I.R.E. at the University of Pitts-
burgh has attempted an ambitious
program to increase the interest of
the undergraduate students both in
the A.I.E.E. and in the electrical en-
gineering field, and to establish in
the student's mind the role of the
engineer in the community. To at-
tain these goals various methods
were used.
   1. An informative talk on what


the A.I.E.E. is, and how it now af-
fects and later will affect the under-
graduate was given to all electrical
engineering freshmen.
  2. An intensive membership cam-
paign was held to increase the stu-
dent membership in A.I.E.E. and
I.R.E.
  3. An excellent program of speak-
ers was arranged to increase the in-
terest and knowledge of the students
in the electrical and allied fields.
  4. An interesting film was shown
which explained the redevelopment
of Pittsburgh, telling of difficult en-
gineering, financial, and social prob-
lems involved.
   5. An important social program
was established, through which the
students would become better ac-
quainted with one another, with the
faculty, and with engineers of indus-
try.
  An important training aspect of
student engineers which is not cov-
ered by any textbook is his sociability.
To help some students to look at our
University as something more than
a factory of knowledge, since the
University is more a commuter
school than a campus school, an
active program was initiated. This
program provided a means to pub-
licize all social functions of the Uni-
versity, all meetings of the Pitts-
burgh Chapter of the A.I.E.E., and
to increase the number of social
gatherings of the student chapter of
A.I.E.E.
  To date, a four-team touch football
league was started in our Electrical
Engineering department, which has
completed its season of elimination
football. Also a square dance was
held with a great success. A good
time was had by all.

Asthetics-     (continued from page 15)
ern artists have long been painting planes and slabs
juxtaposed on canvas. This school of art calls itself cub-
ism. Artists following this school of thought say that these
basic shapes constitute the elements of form and possess
a naturalness with their surroundings. Maillart's bridges
fit perfectly into their surroundings and, at times, seem
as if they were grown at the spot where they stand.
  The foot-bridge over the Toss in Winterthur-Wulf-
lingen, Switzerland (Figure 3), is a pleasing example of
this naturalness. Since no large loads come on to the
bridge an extreme economy could be achieved in the
design of the members. This bridge is a stiffened arch
slab type bridge. The thickness of the arch slab at the
center of the bridge is only five and one-half inches. The
slender steel handrails also add to the elegance of the
bridge. Only a designer completely free from the tradi-
tional use of concrete could achieve such harmonizing
beauty. So many bridges today lack this basic quality.


                                  Z-        -   -
                              Courtesy of Museum of Modern Art
  Figure 5: A view of the Arve River Bridge showing the three
sectioned arch and the seemingly fragile columns.
  In Maillart's bridges, not only are these basic qualities
strictly adhered to, but each succeeding bridge becomes
an entirely new and independent solution. With each
new bridge the slab is formed into new shapes. In the
bridge over the Arve, near Geneva, Switzerland (Figures
4 and 5), Maillart achieves a truly expressive structure.
Its originality and freshness is unquestionably interesting.
The new shape that the column slabs acquire gives the
bridge a definite organic or life-like quality. The road-
way slab is continuous over the supports. The bridge con-
sists of a triple three-hinged arch of box-section. Here as
in the bridge across the Thur the centering can be used
more than once. The entire structure is one that suggests
harmony as well as unity.
  Although Maillart designed many buildings and aque-
ducts, his most impressive work was done in the field of
bridge design. His revolutionary use of the slab did much
to encourage further experiment. It also caused a wave
of criticism. The officials did not approve of his radical
designs and as a result his bridges were built over remote
alpine valleys and waterways. They tried, in other words,
to hide them. But, Maillart was a continual experimenter
until his death in 1940. He proved the validity of his de-
signs many times. Most of his bridges have been standing
now about thirty-five years and they are all still in excel-
lent condition. In 1947, the Museum of Modern Art ex-
hibited many photographs and drawings of Maillart's
work which caused much excitement and enthusiasm.
Still, the full impact of his work may not be felt for many
years to come. But whatever the outcome, Robert Mail-
lart will be remembered as the man who made engineer-
ing "the art of beauty" as well as "the art of directing."

Assistant Dean Appointed


   W. R. Turkes, Head of the In-
 dustrial Engineering   Department
 and director of the Graduate Work
 in Industry Program at the Univer-
 sity of Pittsburgh, has been appoint-
 ed Assistant Dean in the Schools of
 Engineering and Mines at the Uni-
 versity of Pittsburgh. Dean Turkes
 will work directly with Dean G. R.
 Fitterer in the administration of the
 Schools and the academic guidance
 of the engineering students.
   Dean Turkes received the degrees
of Bachelor of Science and Master
of Science at the University of Pitts-
burgh. During World War II he was
coordinator of the Army Specialized
Training Program and Director of
Engineering, Science, Management,
and War Training at the University
of Pittsburgh. Prior to his coming to
the University, Dean Turkes worked
as an industrial engireer with Talon,
Inc., and the United States Steel
Company. Through his many con-
tacts with industrial leaders, he is
well known in industry and engi-
neering.
       Reading Proficiency Exams
  All new freshman students in the
Schools of Engineering and Mines
are required to take reading profici-
ency examinations designed to test
their speed, accuracy, and compre-
hension. This reading test is also re-
quired for all Engineering and Mines
students on probation. Students who
need corrective action in this field
must schedule a remedial reading
course in the 1953-54 spring semes-
ter.
     Alumni Meet in Dallas, Texas
  Professor H. G. Botset, head of the
Petroleum Engineering Department,
attended the annual A.I.P.E. Petrol-
eum Research meeting in Dallas,
Texas. A Pitt petroleum engineering
alumni luncheon was held in con-


nection with the meeting. At the
luncheon Mr. Botset discussed the
present and future plans for the
School of Mines, and distributed
several copies of the SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER.
   Professor Jones Has Paper Published
   A paper by Associate Professor
 George E. Jones, Jr., of the Chemical
 Engineering Department entitled, "A
 Low Distortion Audio-Signal Gen-
 erator," appeared in the October,
 1953, issue of the South American
 publication Antenna in Spanish. The
 paper originally appeared in Radio
 and Television Engineering, July,
 1953 and was one of several of his to
 be published. Professor Jones re-
 ceived both his Bachelor of Science
 and Master of Science in Chemical
 Engineering at the University of
 Pittsburgh.
 American Society of Metals Scholarship
   R. Ronald Netoskie, a senior at
 the University of Pittsburgh, receiv-
 ed a scholarship from the American
 Society of Metals Foundation for
 Education and Research. Mr. Netos-
 skie, who has worked during the
 summer at the Aluminum Research
 Laboratories in New Kensington, is
 one of 41 students in the U. S. and
 Canada to have been granted one of
 these scholarships.
    Petroleum Conference Attended
    Mr. F. L. Convers and Professor
Paul F. Fulton of the faculty of the
Petroleum Engineering Department
attended the Seventh Technical Con-
ference on Petroleum Production at
the Pennsylvania State College. The
annual conference is held for the
purpose of presentation and discus-
sion of technical papers on petroleum
production research with special em-
phasis on secondary recovery of oil

Engineers & Physicists-        (continued from page 21)
endures, alas, until another engineer points out how to do
the same job in a simpler way at less cost. The engineer
is part and parcel of our economic life; he is a corner-
stone of organized society as we know it in the Western
world. India, for example, has many excellent physicists,
whose insights into the basic principles of science are just
as deep as those of physicists in other lands. She does not,
however, have enough engineers to vitalize this abstract
knowledge and bring it into the service of her people.
  Now that we have discussed engineering and physics
separately, let us have a look at the relationships between
them. We know that technology feeds on basic science.
Today's laboratory curiosity appears tomorrow on the
production line. When Michael Faraday made his first
"flea power" motor, had he any vision of our modern
electrical industry? He probably did because when a
politician asked him what good his little toy was he re-
plied, "Some day, sir, you will tax it." The area now
called electrical engineering has passed almost complete-
ly from the domain of physics into that of engineering.
The field of nucleonics is now in the transition stage.
Solid state physics and metallurgy are moving in each
other's direction. During your lifetime there are certain
to be considerable changes in the structures and inter-
relationships of both engineering and physics. If you are
aware of the dynamic nature of this process, you will be
a better engineer.
  Superimposed in this flow of subject matter from
physics to engineering is an equally important flow of
ideas, techniques and materials in the reverse direction.
Probing nature is not a very simple job these days and it
can no longer be done with string and sealing wax. It
takes vacuum tubes, pumps, motors, machine tools, and


special materials of all kinds. The poor physicist could
not operate without these products of engineering enter-
prise. He would not dream of trying to build a cyclotron,
a chain reacting pile or a 200 inch telescope without the
active collaboration of his engineering colleagues. The
physicist is aware too of the stimulation he often gets
from problems that turn up in engineering practice. So
often a chance observation has opened up a whole new
field of study. The physicist knows too that engineers
from Carnot to Steinmetz have made vital contributions
in their own right to the body of new knowledge. These
interesting feedback processes are a vital feature of mod-
ern basic research.
  As time goes on, engineers and physicists are called
upon to work closer and closer together. In the last cen-
tury a new physical principle might lie on the shelf for
fifty years before organized society got any benefit from
it. Not so today! It was only four years from the discov-
ery of fission to the chain reacting pile, only two years
from the basic theory of the transistor to its appearance
as a commercial product. This fruitful collaboration of
physicists and engineers is a modern, almost a post war,
development. It seems bound to flourish and can do
nothing but enrich both disciplines.
  On the local scene we in physics share with the rest
of the University a quiet pride in the fine development
of your School of Engineering. Cooperation between en-
gineers and physicists is traditional in American universi-
ties. We regard the part that we play in your education
as one of our most important jobs; we hope that we are
teaching you not only physics as such but something
about the nature of basic science and its ielatiunslhip uo
your chosen profession.

 states, acquire three years of mining experience in order
 to qualify for the required state examination. Require-
 ments for other positions of comparable responsibility
 vary according to the position and the individual.
   Opportunities are available also to engineers in the ore
mining divisions whose activities are concentrated in the
Mesabi area, in parts of the south and west, and in Vene-
zuela where development of the rich Iron Mountain ore
fields now is in progress.
   It is evident then, that there are opportunities, many
of them, for engineers in U. S. Steel. And the Corpora-
tion's personnel consultants conduct a continuing search
for talented engineering graduates to begin one of the
most intensive training programs from which occupants
of advanced positions are drawn.
   Indicative of the various training programs offered to
these young engineers is the two-year Training Program
for Engineering Management Candidates, which is con-
ducted by General Office Engineering in cooperation
with the Industrial Relations training staff. Many train-
ees accepted for this program are engineers immediately
out of coilege, while others are gractuate engineers who
have been in the employ of the Corporation, perhaps in
one of the plants, for several years.
  The objective of the program, as its name implies, is
to prepare promising young men for positions of leader-
ship and major responsibility in the plants and later,
perhaps, as members of the General Office staff.
  Explanation of the program is best achieved by tracing
the progression of an engineering trainee through the
program and into placement in one of the many engi-
neering activities of the Corporation.
  Richard S. Patton, who was graduated with an Elec-
trical Engineering degree from the University of Pitts-
burgh in February, 1950, entered the program with a
group of eleven other trainees in June of that year.
  Dick's intensive training program began with a two-
week orientation which was sparked by a series of lec-
tures delivered by some of the Corporation's specialists
in various phases of engineering. Three additional weeks
were spent in touring U. S. Steel plants in the Pittsburgh
area. The extensive tour was designed to give the trainees
an over-all picture of operations.
  "It was in the next portion of the program that we
really began to learn about steelmaking," Dick said. "We

 were divided into groups of three and rotated, for the
 next five months, through the principal plants. During
 this time, we studied operations at blast furnaces, open
 hearths, rolling mills and other processes. They tried to
 give us an accurate idea of the what, how, when, and
 why of each phase of steelmaking."
   "We weren't merely guests on these tours," he con-
tinued, "we were required to submit periodic reports
complete with diagrams, drawings and charts showing
details of operations we had observed. Also, at each plant
we were given a list of 50 to 100 questions concerning
steel processes at that plant. If we couldn't answer them,
they were answered for us."
  Considerable emphasis was placed on the necessity for
cooperation and correlation of activities among the engi-
neering, accounting, purchasing, industrial engineering,
industrial relations and other departments with those of
the production forces.
  The third section of the program was divided into four
parts of six weeks each on assignment from General Office
Engineering. Dick was scheduled to work first with the
contract group, then with the construction section of
Clairton Works' Engineering Department. This phase of
the training program was concentrated on engineering
in steelmaking.
  In April, 1951, he was assigned to work with the Con-
struction Engineering Bureau at Fairless Works to assist
in the construction of that plant, and simultaneously to
secure experience in plant construction. The variety of
engineering duties to which Dick was assigned at Fairless
Works illustrates both the flexibility of the training pro-
gram and the extensiveness of the work experience ac-
quired by the engineering trainees.
  At the termination of his two-year training period in
September, 1952, Dick was promoted to the management
position of Engineer with the Construction Engineering
Bureau. Then in April, 1953, he was invited to the
Youngstown plant for discussions concerning a position
as Engineer in electrical engineering design which he
promptly accepted.
  Like many other engineers, Dick chose a future with
U. S. Steel. He found his opportunity with an ever-ex-
panding industry, improving its methods, machinery and
facilities to meet demands for steel from industries and
imaginative people.

       Artificial Solar Rays

   Solar rays found only in the outer
atmosphere   are being reproduced
artificially by a new device which
will simplify scientific exploration in
a little-known region of fundamental
research.
  The device, developed by engineers
of the General Electric Company,
records the reaction of various crys-
tals to vacuum ultra-violet radiation,
the more powerful cousin of ordi-
nary ultra-vialet rays that cause sun-
burn.
  A characteristic peculiar to vacuum
ultra-violet light is its rapid absorp-
tion by air, with the result that the
rays never penetrate the earth's layer
of atmosphere.
  G-E scientists say that although it
produces radiation found only at alti-
tudes of 150 to 200 miles, the new
research tool is not intended as a
means of studying the problems of
space travel.


   They say the extensive basic re-
search made possible by the device
may lead instead to such develop-
ments as an improved phosphor for
television picture tubes, better fluor-
escent lamps, new electronic devices,
and a better device for measuring
the exposure of human beings to the
damaging radiation  from  atomic
bomb blasts.

and 25 feet high when the full

gineers who designed it say the
switch is capable, of handling 330-kv
and of withstanding a power surge
such as might be caused by a light-
ning stroke of 1.3 million volts. The

isolating other electrical equipment
to permit inspection and mainte-
nance in complete safety.

     THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL HELICOPTER


Just two years before Pearl Harbor, Igor Sikorsky
took the controls of a weird-looking machine -
culmination of a dream of thirty years. Moments
later it rose from the ground. Though the flight
lasted only a few seconds, the VS-300 became the
first practical helicopter in the United States.
  Less than six months after Pearl Harbor, the Air
Force took delivery of the first military Sikorsky.
  Since then, rapid developments prove that the
helicopter, most versatile of military aircraft, has
tremendous commercial potentials.
  Helicopters of the future will be the product of
tomorrow's engineers. Sikorsky is young and grow-
ing. It offers life-time opportunities to young men
who choose work where their skills and abilities will
be constantly challenged.


  Perhaps you belong at Sikorsky - in the research
departments, the drafting rooms, the engineering
laboratories.

  WELDED DESIGNS


  CUT COSTS 50%

Y using steel instead of cast iron,
design engineers today make their
products more efficient . . . many times at
half the cost. Product designs are strong-
er, more rigid, take less material to build.
  Too little attention is usually devoted to
simplification of product designs to elim-
inate costly manufacturing manhours
once a basic design is established. Where
designers reappraise product details for
welded steel construction, production
costs are being cut an average of 50% com-
pared with manufacture using castings.
  Manufacturing operations are simpli-
fied with welded steel design. Rejections
due to inferior metal are eliminated. Less
machining and finishing are required.
Finished machines are streamlined, more
modern in appearance.
  In the example below, an economy-
minded design engineer lowered manu-
facturing cost on a machine arm and cut
weight of the arm.
  Before conversion to steel, the machine
arm required 182 pounds of gray iron
and cost $38.25 to cast and machine.
Welded steel design weighs only 86.8
pounds ... costs $20.06.

       Seeing the Invisible
   At the American Photographers'
Association   Convention  recently,
Norman F. Barnes, General Electric
Company engineer, said that photog-
raphy is making possible the explora-
tion of a vast invisible world by using
special precision photographic de-
vices to study such unseen things as
ultra-violet rays, gamma rays, the be-
havior of atomic particles, and the
effect of a plane passing through the
sound barrier.
  A photographic device known as
the X-ray microscope magnifies and
at the same time "sees into" the
depths of objects being studied. To
illustrate the result, a slide picture of
a common housefly taken with the
X-ray microscope was shown. Brain,
organs, and even wing muscles stood
out clearly on the screen.
  Another photographic device, the
electron microscope is used to exam-
ine minute metallurgical, biological
and medical specimens. Using elec-
trons instead of light, the instrument
is 100 times more powerful than ord-
inary   light microscopes.   Photo-
graphic techniques such as these are
used to study the behavior of atomic
particles.

How to keep buried wheels

          turning smoothly
Hidden under the pile of dirt (see arrow) is a 4-wheel
truck that backs up this ditch digger's whirling buckets.
To prevent breakdowns, the wheel bearings had to be
able to absorb the shocks of boulders and the digging
action itself. And they had to be protected from the dirt.
The engineers who designed this application licked both
problems by mounting the truck's wheels on Timken®
tapered roller bearings. Timken bearings absorb the
shocks because they have tough, shock-resistant cores
under hard, wear-resistant surfaces. And Timken bear-
ings make closures more effective.


How TIMKEN' bearings help

keep dirt out-lubricant in
Timken bearings make closures more effective because
they hold the housings and shafts concentric. As a re-
sult, dirt can't get in-lubricant can't get out. Main-
tenance is minimized. Continuous, trouble-free opera-
tion is assured.

1. A man had 8 half-dollars, one of
    which was a counterfeit and
    slightly heavier than the rest.
    Assuming that the men had a
    good pair of scales, how can he
    find the bad half-dollar in only
    two weighings?
 2. A grocer has a scale and four
    weights. If nothing in his store
    weighs more than 40 lbs. and
    these four weights enable him to
    weigh every single lb. from one
    to 40, how    much does each
    weight weigh?
 3. Take a fraction plus half that
    fraction, times that fraction
    equals that fraction. What is the
    fraction?
4. What is the smallest number in
    which the digits are reversed
    when 2 is added to its double?
5. How high above the earth's sur-
    face (radius 4000 mi.) would a
    pound weight weigh but one
    ounce avoirdupois by a scale in-
    dicator, corrected for change of
    elasticity by temperature? Easy?
    -Yes!
6. Two men were born at the same
    moment and died at the same
    instant, yet one was 100 days
    older than the other. How can
    this be accounted for?
7. If I had as many more dollars,
   twice as many more dollars, and
   one half as many dollars less
   $9.00, I would have nothing.
   How much have I?
8. A little girl said: "I am five years
   old, grandpa. How old are you?"
   The   old   gentleman   replied:
   "Your father is 11 times as old
   as you are, and I am as many
   years old as he will be when you
   are one third my age. Do you
   know how old I am now?" Can
   you help the little girl out?
9. Suppose 48 inches are added to
   the earth's equator. What change
   will be made in the earth's ra-
   dius?
10. A farmer having a garden 10
   rods square wishes to know just
   how many posts will be required
   to inclose his land. The posts are
   to be exactly a rod apart. How
   many will be required?


11. The antecedent of a certain ratio
    is 10. The inverse ratio is nine
    times the direct ratio. By what
    must the consequent be multi-
    plied that the direct ratio may be
    nine times the inverse ratio.
 12. A boy noted the position of the
    hands of a clock and went for a
    swim. Between two and three
    hours later he came back and
    found that the hands had ex-
    changed places. How much did
    the swim exceed the two-hour
    limit set by the boy's mother?
 13. Reversing the digits of A's age
    gives B's age. The difference be-
    tween A's age and B's age is twice
    C's age. B's age is 10 times C's
    age. Required, the age of each.

   Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robin-
son were married to Minnie, Maggie,
Maud and Mabel, but not in that
order. On a recent cruise to Hawaii,
each one bought as many pineapples
as he or she paid cents apiece for

many as Mr. Jones, and Mr. Brown
paid three cents apiece more than
his sister Maud. Each wife spent
$1.05 less than her husband, and

1. He divides the group into three
   parts of three, three and two. He
   then weighs the three against the
   three, if they balance the bad
   coin is one of the remaining two.
   If they do not balance, he weighs
   two of the group of three that
   were heavier on the first weigh-
   ing. If these two balance, the bad
   coin is the one left out. If they
   do not balance, the bad coin is
   the heavier of the two.
 2. The weights are 1, 3, 9, 27.
 3. The fraction is %.
 4. 25; (2 X 25) + 2 = 52.
 5. For bodies above the earth's sur-
    face the weight varies inversely
    as the square of the distance from
    the center. Hence, to weigh X6
    as much as at the surface, the
    body must be the square root of
    16, or four times as far from the
    center.  The  required  height
    above the surface is therefore
    3 X 4000 mi., or 12,000 miles.
6. Each one made a tour of the

important wire on a hot subject...


Even at temperatures of 15000 -
speeds of 12,000 rpm -this tiny
wire grid reports to our engineers
on the strains in jet turbine blades.
It gives them accurate measure-
ments for calculating stresses
caused by resonance and flutter.

  This basic information, in turn,
permits the design of blades that
combine the optimum aerodynam-
ic characteristics with structural
integrity.

  Strain gages are not new. But
our engineers had to advance the
art considerably to get readings


at these high speeds and tempera-
tures. It required the development
of improved cements, instrumenta-
tion, slip rings ... new application
techniques and calibration curves.

  Nothing can be left to chance
in the design of aircraft engines
for supersonic flight. Thus we use
- and frequently improve on -
every advanced technique and en-
gineering tool. This straight-for-
ward approach to engineering
problems is one of the reasons
many outstanding engineering
graduates decide on a career at
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

What's Ahead- (continued from page 24)
  A I would say that the pay is high enough. The latest
figures published indicated that the average doctor made
about $14,000 a year before taxes, and before he had
paid certain expenses. But it looks as though medicine is
the highest-paid profession:
  The next highest would be engineers and .scientists.
Then come dentists, lawyers and the rest of them on
down. Engineers usualy compare themselves with doc-
tors, in figuring out the income they ought to make or
would like to make, forgetting that doctors spend 12
years on education as compared to the four for the engi-
neer. And the doctor has a tremendous investment in
equipment, a shorter life expectancy, a shorter time in
which to earn, and so on.
  Q What can the average young engineer expect to
earn in, say, 20 years?
  A I would say the median fellow under today's opera-
tion would probably pass the $10,000 mark in 15 to 20
years.
  Q If business declines, would there be a tendency to
discharge proportionately more engineers than other
people?
  A No. At present, with the defense activity making
one third of our total operations, the need for present-
day production prevents much planning for the future.
So that in a recession it will be a relief, in a way, to be
able to again use our technical force on long-range de-
velopment which we cannot do today.
  Incidentally, I don't think we have recognized in indus-
try the real use of the industrial or manufacturing engi-
neer who is on straight production. That is a field that is
going to grow very rapidly in the next few years because
production has become so extremely complex. You simply
cannot depend on the fellow coming up through the
machine shop to take over the complexities of today's
production. It's a big new field for new engineers.
  Q Are engineers being retired at 65 in most cases?
  A There is a strong trend to keep them on-the good
ones, of course. It's done on a selective basis. The diffi-
culty is that most of them don't want to stay.
  Q Are engineers covered by unions?
  A Not generally, but there has been a strong tendency
during the last few years for engineers to unionize. There
is an organization called the ESA, the Engineers and
Scientists of America. Some of us who are, we believe,
professional in our thinking, believe that unions very
definitely tend to improve the status of the low-grade
fellow at the expense of the high-grade. They claim a
membership of about 40,000. We have in the United
States about 450,000 engineers. ESA members are con-
centrated primarily in the airplane industry.
  Q You mentioned Russia: Is Russia training more
engineers than we are?
  A I have heard various estimates of their training pro-
gram. The most common estimate is that they are produc-
ing 30,000 engineers this year, where we are training
21,000. There are also estimates that Red China is step-
ping up the training of engineers.
   We do have to watch our competition. The Russians
are going to put it all over us if we get in a war, and the
trend continues as it is. We don't know exactly how well
they utilize engineers, but we're pretty sure their produc-
tion is high. We know their typical engineers and scien-
tists are well trained. We know their production of the
so-called "two-year type" of technical-institute fellows is
a great deal ahead of us. Some of their equipment is not
so good. But we've got to keep on our toes to keep ahead.
I 'have faith that young America will come through.



THE     SKYSCRAPER              ENGINEER


















This article was stolen from the May 1953 issue of the Iowa Transit


  This manuscript was submitted to
the SKYSCRAPER office on the day of
December 10, 1953. The editorial
staff gave this object the full benefit
of its careful powers of scrutiny and
it was decided that the author had
revealed a heretofore hidden talent
in regard to his ability to interpret
and record the proceedings of a typi-
cal engineering experiment. The staff
also felt that other engineering stu-
dents might benefit from this dis-
sertation. To this end we hereby pre-
sent this outstanding example of stu-
dent endeavor, unshortened, uncor-
rected, unethical, unpardonable, un-
believable, unplanned and unsightly
electrical engineering laboratory re-
port.


         THE AUTHOR
  J. "Fudge-Factor" Flashback en-
tered the School of Engineering and
Mines in September 1945. Since that
time, he has participated actively in
the National Society of Fuse Blow-
ers, the confederation of associated
prevaricators, and is past president of
the "THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY"
Club. He has also been pledged to
Tau Beta Why since June, 1951. Mr.
Flashback plans to receive his bach-
elors degree in Commerce this June.


     Object of the Experiment
  This investigation was originally
designed to present a chaotic repre-
sentation of the complex relationship
of a somewhat dubious current flow
through an assumed resistance to
support the hypothesis that the po-
tential drop through the resistance
was somehow dependent upon a mu-
table function of current and resis-
tance.
            Procedure:
  It was first necessary to enlist sev-
eral able students; one who was able
to write coherently became "data
taker." A student with the ability to
read numbers from 1 to 10 was pro-
moted to fulfil the function of the
"meter reader." The remaining il-
literate students were instructed to
group   around  conspicuously  and
make any astounding observations
beneficial to   the  group.   Such
astounding observations were re-
required to be pertinent to the ex-
periment being performed and not
irrelevant comments such as "Why
is that meter hand wrapping itself
around the peg?"
              Report:
  On the 10th day of December,
1953 B.C. our group of eager schol-
ars (both literate and illiterate) met
to discuss the proposed experiment
and to perform same. The power
generators were first activated and
power leads were connected to the
output terminals. It was noted that
these leads produced a very inter-
esting and large spark when joined
together and hence the generators
were assumed    to be functioning
properly. A large conglomeration of
ammeters and boltmeters was then
produced by our capable instructor
and the group immediately pro-
ceeded to connect same according to
the circuit diagram.
  It was further noted that Amme-
ter No. 1, connected across the pow-
er lines, immediately produced a
mushroom-shaped puff of smoke.


This had the effect of drawing sev-
eral comments from the observers
such as "It would outwardly appear
that a member of our group has com-
mitted an error in the connection of
the circuit." It should be mentioned
here that no readings were taken at
this point due to low visibility be-
cause of the smog surrounding the
ammeter. Later it was observed,
however, that the meter was of an
inferior grade because the needle
had thrust itself through the side of
the case. The opinion of the group
was that the EE department should
exercise more caution in the pur-
chase of meters and should attempt
to avoid the lower priced variety.
   The resistance unit, RR1, was then
inserted at points A and O as indi-
cated on the diagram and a
       1     w
         c    h
           5     y
 very impressive set of data was re-
 corded by changing the current,
 changing the voltage, changing the
 resistance, and changing the instruc-
 tor. At this point it was observed
 that the boltage drop across the re-
 sistor was equal to twice the line
 voltage. After a rather heated dis-
 cussion it was decided that the re-
 sistor should be shunted with a Fine-
 line pencil to reduce the voltage
 drop. After a few casualties this was
 accomplished  and   the generators
 were noted to be emitting a slight
 cloud of smoke. This cloud increased
 very rapidly in dimensions and then
 suddenly the generators ceased to
 function. The opinion at this rather
 crucial point of the experiment was
 that the EE department should be
 reprimanded for purchasing such
 obviously inferior equipment. Since
 the equipment was in such a state as
 to discourage further investigation,
 it was decided that the group should
 hold their regular meeting at Gus-
 tine's and proceed to fudge data.
 Meeting adjourned.         2

   When the ventriloquist visited his
 friend on a farm it was only natural
 for the farmer to take him out to the
 barn at milking time. There the ven-
 triloquist amused himself by talking
 to the cows and having them talk
 back to him.
   It was amusing to say:
   "Well Brownie, and how are you?"
and have a voice seemingly come
from the old cow in reply:
   "Oh not so bad. Of course, I don't
like this last lot of hay as well as that
nice green hay we'd been getting, but
I'll get along."
  And so it went, down the row of
stanchions.
  "And Spot. How are you making
out?"
  "Well if you must know the truth,
they seem to be awfully skimpy about
the bedding here, considering all the
straw they have on hand."
  "Roan old girl, you look hungry."
  "Well mister, I'm carrying an 80-
pound calf, eating for two tl&ese
days, so I'm always hungry."
  The hired man, tending the milk-
ing machine, opened his eyes wider
and wider as this went on. Finally he
dropped the equipment and dashed
toward the barn door. But he
stopped just long enough to grasp
the ventriloquist by the arm and
plead in an agonized voice:
  "When you come to that little red
heifer at the end, mister, don't be-
lieve a damn word she says!"


   An engineer is a guy who is edu-
cated in the art of developing new
and different ways of making the

   The scene is a train compartment
 in Romania. The characters: A
 Russian officer, a Romanian, an old
 lady, and an attractive girl.
   The train enters a tunnel. The
passengers hear first a kiss, then a
vigorous slap.
   The old lady thinks: "What a
good girl she is, such good manners,
such fine moral character!"
  The girl thinks: "Isn't it odd that
the Russian tried to kiss the old lady,
and not me?"
  The Russian thinks: "That Ro-
manian is a smart fellow; he steals a
kiss and I get slapped."
  The Romanian thinks: "Am I a
smart fellow! I kiss the back of my
hand, hit a Russian officer, and get
away with it."


   It's sad for a girl to reach the age
when men consider her charmless,
but it's worse for a man to attain the
age when the girls consider him
harmless.

   "Darling, I could sit here and do
nothing but look at you forever."
   "That's what I'm beginning to
think."

  The fellow    and  girl charged
around a corner and bumped smack
into each other. They stepped back,
apologized, and started up again.
But they both dodged in the same
direction, and bumped once more.
Again they started up, bumped, and
apologized. This time the fellow
stepped back, raised his hat and gal-
lantly remarked, "Just once more,

TORRINGTON NEEDLE BEARINGS

  help make products more compact


These days, design engineers have
to consider sales charts as well as
blueprints and specifications.
  Two portable electric drills,
for example, may have the same
capacity, the same speed, the
same chucks and the same price,
yet one may outsell the other.
Factors like overall appearance,
compactness, and light weight
often contribute to product
success.
      Unique Design
         Promotes
    Compact Designs
The Torrington Needle Bearing
has been used in many products
because of the weight and space


savings it affords. Its unique de-
sign-a thin hardened outer shell
retaining a full complement of
small diameter rollers-gives it
maximum capacity in minimum
space. In fact, for its size and
weight, the Needle Bearing can
carry higher radial loads than any
other type of anti-friction bearing.

    Permits Reduction
    in Size and Weight
    of Related Parts
In the electric drill shown here
the small size of the Needle Bear-
ing permits close shaft center
distances to make for overall
compactness. And, since Needle


Bearings are press-mounted in
plain round housing bores-with-
out retaining rings or shoulders-
housings can be made smaller and
lighter. The fact that Needle
Bearings require no inner race
when running on hardened shafts
results in further savings, without
sacrificing capacity or durability.
  Needle Bearings are in use on
many other products where com-
pactness and light weight are im-
portant design factors. Aircraft,
small gasoline engines, hydraulic
pumps and materials handling
equipment are just a few of the
products that utilize the Needle
Bearing's high capacity and small
size to good advantage.

* ALBANENE,* a K&E product, is the preferred tracing paper
in thousands of drafting rooms. It is transparentized, not with
messy oils that leak, but with a special synthetic trans-
parentizer developed by K&E. ALBANENE does not turn
brittle or lose its transparency with time. After years it is as
good as new.                        *Trade Mark@


Jokes-      (continued from page 44)
Spring is sprung
Fall has fell
Winter is here
And it's cold as (it was last year).

  Little boy watching milkman's
horse: "Mister, I bet you don't get
home with your wagon."
  Milkman: "Why?"
  Little boy: "Cause your horse just
lost all his gasoline."
  You can't tell a farmer's daughter
that a stork brings baby calves, be-
cause she already knows it's the bull.

  It's amazing what some women
get away with and still keep their
amateur standing.

  First engineer to second engineer,
"You drive, you're too drunk to
sing."













"Look,       o,f oU don '
   like if, Jmt say so /"

   Mother: "Well, son, what have
you been doing all day?"
  Son: "Shooting craps, mother."
  Mother: "That must stop. Those
little things have as much right to
live as you."

      Seven National Crimes
   1. I don't think.
   2. I dont' know.
   3. I don't care.
   4. I am too busy.
   5. I "leave well enough alone."
   6. I have no time to read and find
     out.
  7. I am not interested.
           ve never been dated
  I've never been dated
  I've never been kissed
  They said if I waited
  No man could resist
  The lure of a pure, innocent Miss,
  The trouble is-I'm fifty.

  The telephone rang late one night.
  "What is it?" asked the tired C.E.
  "It's a long distance from New
York," replied the operator.
  "I know it is," said the C.E. and
back to bed he went.

"I


chose


    Worthington

                for

   opportunities

in international

            trade"


* "Worthington was my choice," Mr. Berger says, "be-
cause of the excellent training and the unusual experiences
that are possible with a manufacturer having a worldwide
reputation, and worldwide distribution. Then, when a
company has seventeen divisions, including air condition-
ing, refrigeration, turbines, Diesel engines, compressors
and pumps of all kinds, construction machinery, and
power transmission equipment, a graduate engineer's
chances for getting into his chosen field are even better.
  "Supporting these divisions are research, engineering,
production, purchasing, and sales, domestic and export.
The real opportunity, however, is in Worthington itself.
This is a company that is growing, just as it has for more
than a century. It is always looking for new, related
products and good men to engineer, produce, and sell


them-at home and abroad.
  "I began my career with Worthington's training pro-
gram in the Research and Development Laboratory, where
full-scale equipment is designed, tested and improved.
This experience gave me an understanding of the tremen-
dous part the company plays in the everyday life of mil-
lions of people. Within fourteen months I was sent to
Mexico to inspect the facilities of our distributors there.
  "The opportunities for first-hand laboratory experience,
sales training and contact, travel and field trips, among
many others, make Worthington a first-rate company for
the young engineer with a desire to learn and progress in
his work."
  When you're thinking of a good job, think high-think
Worthington.

Hercules® explosives are used by geophysical crews to locate potential oil
deposits. Hercules also makes cellulose and rosin derivatives that serve the
petroleum industry in several ways-as in oil well drilling muds, corrosion
inhibitors, and as additives in secondary recovery operations.


HOW HERCULES HELPS...



   Lotions for tender baby skins benefit from
   Hercules research in cellulose. Hercules
   cellulose gum-a water-soluble colloid-
   serves as ain emollient, thickener, and
   suspending agent in lotions of many types.
   It's also found in toothpastes, face creams,
   and pharmaceuticals.









        Hercules' business today helps
        almost everyone's business. It
 embraces the production of synthetic
 resins, cellulose products, chemical cot-
 ton, terpene chemicals, rosin and rosin
 derivatives, chlorinated products, and
 many other chemical processing mate-
 rials-as well as explosives. Through
 close cooperative research with its cus-
 tomers, Hercules has helped improve the
 processing or performance of many in-
 dustrial and consumer products.


Livestock sprays made with Hercules Thanite® offer
quick knockdown and high kill of houseflies, horn flies,
stable flies. Thanite also fortifies household and aerosol
formulations. Another Hercules toxicant-toxaphene-
is widely used in agricultural insecticides.
