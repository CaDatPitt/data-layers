From the editor

With this issue, Skyscraper Engineer enters a new and,
it is hoped, successful era. Since its beginnings in 1951,
Skyscraper has passed through many phases. From a
technically oriented journal in the fifties, to a broader bas-
ed, more controversial magazine in the late sixties and ear-
ly seventies, Skyscraper has been a leader in college jour-
nalism. Revived last year after a period of inactivity, the
Skyscraper staff is now working to create once more the quali-
ty college magazine that has won awards in previous years.

But we need your help. Skyscraper can be a means of
both communication and expression but to do this it needs
your ideas and contributions. We invite any engineering stu-
dent, faculty member or any other member of the university
community to contribute articles, photographs, artwork, ideas
or criticism. If you have a news story, a technical article, a
story about a student or faculty member, a fictional work or
an interesting photograph, we welcome your contributions.
If you have a complaint that isn't being resolved, a new ap-
proach to a problem or any other ideas or criticisms, drop
off a letter to the editor. We only require that any submis-
sion must be signed by the author.

Material for the Skyscraper may be brought to the
Engineering Student Cabinet office, located on the ground
floor of Benedum Hall. We also strongly encourage anyone
who would like to become more involved with the magazine
to join the Skyscraper staff. We need writers, photographers,
artists, typists, salespeople and anyone with an interest in
journalism. Whatever your literary or artistic interests may
be, you can help to create a quality publication.

In the past the Skyscraper has held a renowned position
in college journalism, not just as an engineering publication,
but as a university student magazine. It should showcase the
ideas and work of both the students and faculty of the School
of Engineering, people who are talented, diversified and
creative. Skyscraper hopes to inform,to entertain and to ex-
press the creativity and individuality of the university com-
munity. We welcome your contributions, ideas and support.

A Letter
From the Dean

By Dean M. L. Williams

In the 1980's colleges and universities will strenuously
recruit highly qualified students to fill a rather constant
number of vacancies in freshman engineering classes. In fact
college recruiting in the late 70's had absorbed so many
engineering majors that many universities’ public images
resembled a production line stimulated by a high—power mass
advertising campaign! At the same time, the classical enter-
ing engineering student, whose education is traditionally
embedded in the principles of natural science, encountered
the electronic revolution represented by the increasing use
of hand-held calculators, microprocessors and an unparallel-
ed access to sophisticated computer technologies. These new
tools have drastically altered the content of many engineer-
ing curricula, including the one here at Pitt.

The 1982 freshman engineering class will be the first to
participate in the revised freshman curriculum. Engineering
11 and 12 have been combined into one continuous two-
semester course known as Engineering 9 and 10. The ad-
vantages of this restructure are two-fold. Computing is now
an integral part of engineering work. Instruction in computer
programming along with immediate application to engineer-
ing problems will emphasize the value of programming as
a useful tool in engineering problem solving.

Furthermore, with the continuous engineering course for-
mat, aided by the redistribution of the physics and chemistry
courses, it is now possible to integrate some related topics
covered in calculus, physics and chemistry into the engineer-
ing course. Thus the student can obtain an insight into
engineering implications and applications of the principles
covered in these basic science courses.

The University of Pittsburgh School of Engineering has
had its own Undergraduate Student recruiting program since
1973 for the purpose of attracting academically qualified high
school students to careers in engineering, and more
specifically into the undergraduate programs of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh's School of Engineering.

Under the direction of Lori Shuff Vozza, Director of
Engineering Career Guidance, the 1982 freshman numbers

are approximately 450. Because of our limit on freshman
registrants, as one way of maintaining reasonable class sizes,
Mrs. Vozza’s main objective was to assure that the registrants
with the best academic profiles were admitted. For this pur-
pose she visited many high schools, conducted many per-
sonal interviews, and sent out personal mailings to the
students at varying stages in their application process. We
are most pleased to find that this year's freshman class
average SAT score was increased by forty-four (44) points
over that of last year's. Seventy-four percent (74%) of the
freshmen were in the top 20% of their high school classes.
Geographically the majority of the students were from public
high schools within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It
also appears that the University of Pittsburgh's School of
Engineering is maintaining its high appeal to women intersted
in engineering careers; the freshman class is approximately
25% female.

To accomodate the increasing interest in engineering
education and the importance of the computer in today's
society, the University of Pittsburgh has also made some
physical changes in Benedum Hall. During the summer
months the tenth floor Remote Job Entry (RJE) Center was
enlarged significantly. The rennovation included the addi-
tion of thirty-six new CRT’s (Dec VT 31); carpeting on the
walls and floor to reduce noise; a partition so that instruc-
tors can use part of the room for classroom demonstrations;
and additional air conditioning. In the near future a projec-
tion screen will also be added. Two additional changes in
Benedum are the newly remodeled lecture rooms on the fifth
and tenth floors. Each classroom can accomodate up to 120
students.

These changes in the Engineering School are intended
both to improve the quality of education provided for our
students and to expand the resources available to them. The
measures described above are part of our continuing effort
to provide the highest quality education possible for our
students and to foster an environment favorable for educa-
tion, research, and personal growth.

News From Benedum Hall

Terri Leaves Engineering School

Terri Butko, who was employed by the School of
Engineering for nearly three years, has left the University and
is now residing in Idaho with her new husband, Kent Rot-
chy. Terri held the position of secretary for the directors of
the offices of Student Affairs, Freshman Programs, and Career
Guidance. In addition to capably handling office tasks, Terri
was helpful to the students who came into the office, and
she was especially sympathetic to the needs of freshmen who
were not yet familiar with the University's procedures.

Terri was married from Saint Margaret's Church in
Munhall on Saturday, September 11, after an engagement
of 21 months. On Monday, September 13, Terry and Kent
left Pittsburgh in their new pick-up truck pulling a U-Haul
filled with their belongings, and they headed for Idaho. They
planned stops along their route to visit Yellowstone National
Park, Mount Rushmore, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in the
Rocky Mountains.

Terri and Kent decided to move west after visiting
members of Kent's family in that part of the country while
on vacation last year. Kent, who is a draftsman, will be
employed in either Boise or Idaho Falls, and Terri will look
for secretarial work after they are settled.

Terri's cheerful efficiency will be missed by the students
and faculty of the School of Engineering. The Skyscraper staff
wishes Terri and Kent the best of luck for their new life in
Idaho.

Todhunter Joins EE Faculty

John Todhunter, who received his Ph.D. from the
University of Pittsburgh, has joined the faculty of the Univer-
sity as Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering. He is
teaching computer applications and is among the faculty
members who are involved with the newly—formed Computer
Engineering program. He is involved as an instructor for EE
7, an introduction to PASCAL.

Todhunter is currenlty researching image processing and
three-dimensional reconstruction and parallel processing.
This research involves experimenting with digital techniques
which can enable a computer to visualize an image, much
as the human eye and brain would view a photograph. His
research is funded by two grants from the National Institute
of Health. Todhunter also periodically consults. for
Westinghouse.

Todhunter chose his faculty position over a career in in-
dustry due to his research. He finds that laboratory equip-
ment and facilities, flexible hours, and the dynamic environ-
ment of an academic center are all conducive to indepen-
dent research.

BEC Enhances Studies

Three programs aimed at enhancing academics have
been scheduled by the Black Engineering Council. On
November 4, BEC will sponsor an industrial seminar. This
will provide a look at where present academic ac-
complishments can place one in the future. The speaker will
be an alumnus of BEC who is currently employed in some
technically-oriented field in industry.

BEC is also holding a motivation workshop. The
workshop, which is scheduled for November 18, is reputed
to be especially beneficial for freshmen.

In addition, BEC has a tutorial program which is in ef-
fect throughout the term. This tutoring service is availabe to
all blacks who are majoring in engineering or another
technical discipline. Tutors are available for most basic math
and science courses.

SWE Activities Outlined

Members of the University of Pittsburgh's Student Sec-
tion of the Society of Women Engineers are currently work-
ing on a number of projects. The first is the compilation of
a resume book which will be distributed to over 200 com-
panies across the nation. Typewritten resumes are now be-
ing accepted for publication from all engineering
undergraduate and graduate students. All resumes should be
submitted to the SWE office.

On October 30 and 31, selected SWE members will
travel to Case-Western Reserve University for the Regional
SWE Conference. The representatives to the conference will
contribute to legislative decisions of the organization and ex-
change ideas with student members from other colleges.

Two professional recruiters from the Proctor and Cam-
ble Company will conduct an Interviewing Techniques
Seminar sponsored by SWE on November 4. They will
discuss the do’s and don’ts of being interviewed and offer
suggestions on how to conduct oneself at an interview. -

SWE’s Corporate Banquet will be held on November 11.
The banquet allows the Society of Women Engineers to
recognize the accomplishments of the student section and
its members, and it provides an opportunity for student in-
teraction with the company representatives who will also at-
tend the banquet.

Shah Takes Sabbatical

Dr. Yatish T. Shah, Professor and Chairman of Chemical and
Petroleum Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, is on
sabbatical at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Shah
is researching chemical reactor design, particularly the design
of reactor systems for coal liquification and gasification. Until
January when Dr. Shah will return to the University of Pitt-
sburgh, his position is being filled by Dr. John W. Tierney,
Professor and Acting Chairman of Chemical and Petroleum
Engineering.

by Joe Samosky

You are surrounded by total darkness with your chin
resting on a comfortable support. A signal is given and you
pick up two switches, one in each hand, and rest your foot
on a third switch. As you depress your foot, computer
generated geometric figures suddenly appear on an
oscilloscope screen in front of you. The patterns appear in
rapid succession, each figure lasting for less than a second
and followed by a random scatter-pattern. You respond as
instructed and after several minutes the ordeal is over. A
black drape is pushed aside and you walk out into the bright-
ly lit Visual Information Processing (V.l.P.) Laboratory run
by Dr. Richard Hall.

You have just experienced one of the many experiments
developed by Dr. Hall and his associates for research in
visual perception. Hall, an associate professor in Pitt's elec-
trical engineering department, has been involved in visual
biomedical research at the University of Pittsburgh since
1975. His lab, located on the second floor of Benedum, is
equipped to run visual perception experiments, analyze and
process data and develop the necessary hardware and
software.

Richard Hall is a graduate ofjohns Hopkins University,
where he received a Bachelor of Engineering Science degree
in Electrical Engineering. He received his Master’s_ degree
and Ph.D. at Northwestern. Hall also lectured at Nor-
thwestern during his final year before coming to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh in 1975. He currently teaches two courses
in the Electrical Engineering Department, EE 32 and EE 151,
in addition to the graduate course, ’’Analysis of Biological
Systems” EE 384.

Hall's interest in the human visual system was an
outgrowth of an eclectic background. Early in his life and
while an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Hall had a
keen interest in artificial intelligence, a blossoming new field
in the 1960's. He worked in a cooperative program with the
Westinghouse Space and Defense Center in Baltimore and
dealt extensively with digital signal processing. Hall became
interested in computerized pattern recognition techniques,
and later realized that mammalian visual perception was a
prime example of a self-organizing pattern recognition sytem.
Having done much theoretical work on the subject, his broad
background in digital electronics paved the way for practical
experimentation in visual perception.

Dr. Hall has recently completed a research project in
cooperation with Dr. Jay D. Glass, formerly of the Depart-
ment of Pharmacology at Pitt's Medical School. The experi-
ment examined the manner in which the brain processes
visual information. Much is known about the eye and the
manner in which visual data is perceived, but'very little is
understood about the manner in which the brain actually
handles this vast amount of visual information. The techni-
que utilized by Dr. Hall was to monitor the electrical activi-
ty in the visual cortex of a cat's brain, as the cat was sub-
jected to patterned or diffuse visual stimulation. Dr. Glass,
working at Pitt's Medical School, implanted electrodes into
the cat's vision centers and recorded the patterns of electrical
activity generated as the cat was exposed to either a diffuse
light or a checkerboard pattern. The data thus collected was
then processed at Dr. Hall's lab, utilizing the extensive com-
puter facilites of Pitt's DEC-10 system.

Dr. Richard Hall demonstrates the operation of the Visual
Information Processing Lab's computer. Behind Hall are the
computer mainframe and several of its peripheral devices.

  

These oscillographs are of images generated by the LSI-11's
vector generator. The figure on the left is a scatter pattern
which appears immediately after an image is seen in order

As a result of Hall's investigations, a relationship was
identified between patterned stimuli and slow-wave electrical
activity in certain areas of the brain. (Cortical areas 17, 18,
and 19). In the experiment, certain electrical signals were
observed in these areas when the cat viewed a checkerboard
pattern. These signals were much different when the test
animal was exposed to a diffused white light. These areas
of the brain are thus apparently involved in pattern recogni-
tion and the processing of visual information. Such informa-
tion may aid in the understanding of human visual disorders
and human visual perception in general.

Other areas of Hall's research include an investigation
of the role that early visual experience plays in determing
future visual perception, and a project to optically monitor
eye movements of primates. In experiments currently under
development, it will be necessary to present visual images
to primates such as monkeys. These images need to be posi-
tioned precisely on the monkey's retina. An image presented
on a video screen can be easily positioned by a computer,
but it is also necssary to know the position of the primate’s
eyes. This is accomplished by placing a small white tattoo
on the primate’s cornea. This tattoo can then be tracked us-
ing a video camera, computer, and a specially developed
search pattern program. (This program, which generates a
spiral-like search pattern within a bounded rectangular
region, is a spin-off of Hall's work which has numerous other
applications for image tracking and pattern recognition.) The
computer can then precisely determine the location of the
animal's cornea and adjust the location of any presented pat-
terns so that they always remain aligned at known locations
on the animal's retina.

Another current project is an attempt to bridge the gap
between animal and human research. Higher animals serve
a valuable role in visual perception research since their eyes
and brain act similarly to those of man, but the ultimate goal
of this research is an understanding of the human visual

to ”erase” that image from the retina. The two figures on
the right are images from the Triangle Inclination experi-
ment described in the beginning of the article.

system. Rather than use implanted electrodes, Hall plans to
examine human brain electrical activity using an Elector-
Encephalograph (EEG). He is currently developing an in-
dependent PDP 11 microprocessor system to process EEG
data from experiments similar to the one described at the
beginning of this article. This setup will make possible the
simultaneous monitoring of reaction times and evoked EEG
responses of the people serving as subjects in the experiment.
It is hoped that this will give more direct insight into the work-
ings fo the human visual cortex.

Dr. Hall, in addition to his extensive work in the lab,
enjoys teaching the students at Pitt. ”What makes teaching
enjoyable for me is the challenge of expressing ideas in new
ways. I love it when my students teach me something. I like
to give students the responsibility to do work, and to stimulate
their interests. I rely a great deal on the independence of the
student. l’m frequently pleased. I'm frequently not pleased.
(pause and smile) I accept that.” Hall strongly believes in
close communications between students and faculty. ”The
students should take more responsiblity to educate the facul-
ty. We need the feedback and the ideas, too."

As far as Pitt's undergraduate electrical engineering pro-
gram is concerned, Dr. Hall is generally pleased but sees it
being too compressed. ’’I’m interested in a 5-year program
for EE. Technology has advanced so quickly in just the past
few years. The classical basis remains the same, but there
is so much more today that wasn't there ten or fifteen years
ago that it's just too much for four years. I'm highly in favor
of that (a 5-year program).”

Hall concludes, ”Society has put too much of an em-
phasis on the job status of an education. The university is
not a professional school; it is a community of people who
get together to expand knowledge, both personal and
general. We need to remind ourselves of the intellectual pur-
pose of the university. There is no way you can survive in
engineering and not be a student all your life. If you stop
learning, you stagnate.”

CONVENTIONAL scientiﬁc
thought treats virtually all
of the valence electrons found in
the surface atomic layer of a
metal as if they are free to roam
throughout the metal’s interior.
The work of three physicists at
the General Motors Research Lab-
oratories suggests otherwise.
Through calculations conﬁrmed
by experimental data, the
theorists have shown that more
than a quarter of the valence elec-
trons in the top atomic layer of
some metals are effectively

trapped in the surface. The pres-

71

ence of so many "surface state
electrons must be considered
when analyzing physical and

chemical surface phenomena, in-
cluding such surface events as ox-

idation leading to corrosion.

The Surface Contingent

A recent ﬁnding at the General Motors Research
Laboratories has changed scientiﬁc thinking about
the behavior of electrons in metal surfaces. This discovery
provides a greater understanding of the fundamen tal
physical processes involved in such surface events as
adhesion, corrosion and catalysis.

Drs. John Smith, Jack Gay
and Frank Arlinghaus applied
their theoretical analysis to the
(100) surface of ﬁve metals: cop-
per, nickel, silver, rhodium and
palladium. They made bold predic-
tions concerning the percentage
of electrons in the surface atomic
layer to be found in surface states:
Cu(36%), Ni(23%), Ag(23%),
Rh(23%) and Pd(19%). The ratio of
the shaded area to the hatched

area of figure 1 gives the percent-

age for copper.

Electrons in surface states
are not only abundant, but also
highly localized on the surface.
Chemisorption on a metal is also

conﬁned to the surface region.

Figure 2 shows what happens in
the case of nitrogen chemisorbed
on copper. The two contour maps
coincide except in the surface
layer, where the interaction is
largely exhibited. Localization of

the interaction holds for the chemi-

sorption of other gases, including
oxygen in the initial stage of

metal oxidation. These observa-

tions led the physicists to conclude
that surface states are important
in chemisorption.

One way to probe electrons
in surfaces is to chemisorb atoms
on a clean metal surface and look
for changes in photoemission
spectra. Such an experiment was
performed at GM for fractional
monolayers of nitrogen, oxygen

and sulfur on Cu(100). The domi-

nant change in the photoemission
spectrum was the disappearance
of a large peak whose shape and

energy location was independent
of the chemisorbed atom. It was of
special interest that the shape and
energy location of this peak was
nearly identical to the envelope
around the surface state peaks in
figure 1. This suggests that sur-
face state electrons play a major
role in the chemisorption process.

HE THEORETICAL ad-
Vance at the heart of the dis-

covery is the "Self-Consistent
Local Orbital (SCLO) Method” for
solving the Schrodinger equation.
This new mathematical method
was devised by the GM theorists
to handle the classic dilemma
posed by the self-consistency re-
quirement. The characterization of
electron behavior used to com-
plete the equation must be consis-
tent with the behavior predicted
by the equation. In other words,

one almost needs to know the an-
swer in order to make the calcula-

tion.

Self-consistent solution of
the equation for a metal surface is
made exceedingly difficult by the
three-dimensional nature of the
electron density distribution. The
theorists dealt with this challenge
successfully by dividing the elec-
tron density distribution into two
parts—the ﬁrst part due to over-
lapping atomic density distribu-
tions; the second part equaling the
difference between this atomic
contribution and the exact density
distribution.

One of the more stringent
tests of the accuracy of the SCLO

method was an angular photo-

emission experiment conducted

by Heimann et al., at the Univer-
sity of Munich subsequent to pub-

lication of the GM research. The
German research team conﬁrmed
a prominent surface state band

predicted by the three GM physi-

cists. This was the ﬁrst time a
surface state band on a solid had
been calculated prior to its being
seen experimentally. The SCLO
method makes possible something

that could not be done before—ac-
curate prediction of the actual be-

havior of electrons whirling
around nuclei at the surface of a
metal.

"The large body of surface

states we found on metal sur-

faces,” says Dr. Smith, "may be a

controlling factor in many physi-
cal and chemical surface phenom-

ena. By replacing conjecture with

calculation, the new surface theo-

retical methods give us the means
to make major steps forward in

the analysis of surface and inter-

face properties.”

A Panorama of Technology

and Culture:

The 1982 World’s Fair

by Diane Momchilovich and Charlene Kozlouski

The glowing Sunsphere, the towering landmark of
the 1982 World’s Fair, symbolically represents the
energy concerns of the world.

Knoxville, Tennessee, is currently providing the setting
in which 21 countries are exhibiting an extravaganza of
cultures and ideas concerning the present-day energy situa-
tion. With energy as the central theme, each participating
country is contributing its theories on energy conservation
and its ideas for innovations in the future. At the same time,
the fair is enabling each country to display aspects of its socie-
ty and history which make that country unique.

The technological, cultural, and promotional exhibits of
the Knoxville 1982 World's Fair are housed in the domestic
and international pavilions. Although the cultural exhibits
are the most attractive, the focus of the Fair is on energy and
energy conservation.

This view of the upper part of the park includes the flags
from the nations represented at the fair and, at far left, the
American Pavillion.

Energy and the Future

The International Energy Symposia Series was the prin-
cipal educational activity of the 1982 World's Fair. The pur-
poses of the Symposia Series were to provide an opportuni-
ty for experts in energy-related fields to identify and discuss
crucial energy issues, to evaluate current international energy
policies, and to formulate constructive solutions for increas-
ing productivity in energy production and consumption. Sym-
posium I, conducted on October 14, 1980, focused on defin-
ing the extent of the world's energy problem. At Symposium
II, on November 3 through November 6,1982, participants
from thirty-five nations conducted an in-depth analysis of the
world's energy problems. The last symposium provided
distinguished experts a chance to ratify the findings of the
first two symposia.

In the International Pavilion, ’’talk back” computers giv-
ing information about energy are among the numerous at-
tractions. Along with the computers, the United States is ex-
hibiting the new IMAX motion picture screen that dwarfs
even the standard 70 mm screens. The Sunsphere, the glow-
ing tower that is the prominent landmark of the World's Fair,
expresses the proportionate uses of energy in four major
areas: industry, home, transportation, and commerce. The
United States also shows six historical exhibits to summarize
the changing roles of various energy sources in American
history.

The exhibits of many foreign nations focus on specific
energy-related issues. Italy is celebrating the fortieth anniver-
sary of the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction by the
dedication of an exhibit to Enrico Fermi, the Italian-born
physicist who led the experiment. Italy also features
renewable sources of energy in their geothermal, agro-
industrial display. The French Pavilion is dedicated to the
conservation of energy in transportation. One French exhibit
features the development of the world's fastest train, the TGV,
which goes as fast as 235 mph between Paris and Lyons. It
has been calculated that the cost of carrying one passenger
on the TGV is equivalent to the cost of fuel needed to carry
one passenger by air. The Federal Republic of Germany
presents a balanced discussion about the advantages and
disadvantages of three of the most controversial types of
energy: solar, wind, and nuclear energy. In a technological
exhibit at the Japanese Pavilion are the performing industrial
robots which have increased productivity in Japanese fac-
tories remarkably in recent years.

Exhibits such as these provide the foundation on which
the theme of the Fair is presented to the visiting public. It
is hoped that such interest in what lies ahead will stimulate
public awarenss of energy issues and perhaps spark some
creative genius to solve the world's present energy problems.

The World's Fair serves not only as a medium for new
energy innovations to be showcased, but also as a way for
the 21 countries to share such intriguing aspects of their
culture as art, religion, and history. Much of the atmosphere
and excitement of the Fair is provided by the wide variety
of cultures represented. These cultural aspects are here ex-
emplified by the Peruvian, Saudi Arabian, and Korean
exhibitions.

Cable cars bring visitors from the main entrance directly
to the base of the Sunsphere.

A Diversity of Cultures

The Peruvian Pavilion displays the exquisite gold art-
works which are landmarks of Peruvian history and culture.
The fame of Peru's gold began with the discovery and con-
quest of Tahuantinsuyo. News of this conquest led to exten-
sive pillaging of Peruvian wealth by the Spanish who hoard-
ed many pieces of the Peruvian artwork. A number of pieces
recently recovered by the efforts of Miguel Mujica Gallo and
the foundation he established in 1966 are displayed for
public viewing at the World's Fair. Some pieces of this man's
vast collection date back thousands of years and provide the
viewers a unique historical account that chronicles the ac-
tivities, genius, suffering, and glory of man for centuries. Most
pieces are comprised primarily of gold, but silver, turquoise,
emeralds, rock crystal, feathers, and bones also contribute
to the captivating nature of many of the artworks. Each of
the hundreds of unique pieces on display provides people
with a dazzling sight, as well as an original angle from which
a rich, vibrant history may be viewed.

Islam, the primary organized religion practiced by the
people of Saudi Arabia, provides the centralized core of the
Saudi Arabian Pavilion. The centerpiece of the Saudi Ara-
bian Pavilion is a 400-square-foot display featuring an
animated model of the Grand Mosque of Mecca surround-
ed by the Kaaba, a black, cube-shaped building which is the
focal point of prayers for the world's 800 million Muslims.
With such a display as the highlight of the Saudi Arabian
Pavilion, one cannot fail to see how the Islamic religion
dominates the Muslim's culture. Today, this legacy of Islam
— the need for learning, the respect for knowledge, and the
tolerance of difference — helps to guide Muslims in all
aspects of their lives: social, cultural, legal, economic, and
religious.

Large crowds gathered everywhere at the fair, including
here to enjoy the music of a marching band.

13

What appears to be a temple is actually a striking Oriental
tapestry in the Chinese Pavillion.

A unique combination of technology and ancient tradi-
tions make the Korean Pavilion a special treat to visitors.
Korea is a country in transition. It is still in the throes of a
past that reoccurs with marked consistency in its present-day
culture and also in its plans for the future. In the section of
the Korean Pavilion devoted to displays describing the past,
visitors look upon colorful folk dances, beautiful art pieces,
and the architecture which has remained a steadfast portion
of Korean culture over many centuries. Within the confines
of the present-day section of the Korean Pavilion, onlookers
view a shimmering pond with its impressive waterwheel
representing the importance of hydraulic power to the cur-
rent Korean society. A seven-minute, multi-image produc-
tion presents a panoramic view of the cultural, industrial, and
economic aspirations of the Korean people for the future.
By combining the past, present, and future in its displays,
Korea allows many people to see the culture of Korea as it
exists today — carrying its traditions into a promising future.

The 1982 World's Fair provides for thousands of peo-
ple the unique opportunity to view many cultures as they
appear for the natives of those cultures. The Fair also gives
each represented country a chance to identify itself as an in-
dividual, a chance to show to the world what makes that
country most proud, whether it be a nation's religion, art,
or history.

As a center for industrial, cultural, and social growth,
the 1982 World's Fair has provided 21 countries with the
opportunity to share ideas on energy conservation, develop-
ment, and future plans, as well as laying the foundation for
a better understanding of foreign cultures and traditions. At
the World's Fair, countries can move beyond past problems
and join together to accomplish "a common goal, the
organization of an international center for the sharing of
cultures and ideas. The Fair also provides an opportunity for
members of a world-wide community to share a universal
emotion — pride in one’s homeland.

Computer Engineering at Pitt

reported by Mike Udavchak

This term a new program is making its start in the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh's School of Engineering. Within the Elec-
trical Engineering department, under the direction of Marlin
H. Mickle, is the recently developed Computer Engineering
program. While some universities have had such a program
for three to five years, the University of Pittsburgh has not
found it necessary to start Computer Engineering until this
time. This does not imply that the University of Pittsburgh
is behind the times. As Mickle explains, the University of
Pittsburgh is a leader in the digital area, and its Electrical
Engineering curriculum has offered its students a great deal
of computer exposure. But today, with the rapid changes in
microelectronics, and the development of relatively inexpen-
sive home computers, an even more extensive familiarity
with computers is needed for those students planning to enter
the computer field.

Mickle says that the enrollment into the Computer
Engineering program is limited since each student must have
”hands on” experience with computers. In order to be ac-
cepted into the program, a student is required to submit a
brief letter describing his or her special interest in computers
and computing, special experiences and background which
he or she may bring to the program, and general academic
performance.

Upon graduation the Computer Engineers will receive
the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.
This general background will qualify the students for work
in any area of Electrical Engineering. Computer Engineering's
main difference is in the concentration on computer related
topics, extra-curricular projects, and a closer student/faculty
advising effort.

Computer Engineers will take either CS 7 or EE 7 instead
ofan elective and will be given a computer to work with
in their spare time. CS 7 and EE 7 are both introductions to
PASCAL. Having a personal computer gives the students as
much practical experience as is possible. in the future the
Computer Engineers will take additional computer related
courses and will also be exposed to computers in industry.
According to Mickle, industries will be anxious to have these
students visit their plants because they are interested in hir-
ing people with a broad based knowledge of the digital field.

Engineering program.

Computer Engineering is not Computer Science. A Com-
puter Scientist is concerned with programming a computer.
A Computer Engineer deals with every aspect of the com-
puter. Therefore, a Computer Engineer will learn basic digital
electronics, the organization and actual construction of
microprocessors and computers, and the interfacing and ap-
plications of computers. In addition, the students will learn
how to program in several languages.

In a relatively short period of time, the computer has
become an extremely important tool. It is likely that man will
apply computers even more extensively in the future as they
become faster, more versatile and able to handle larger
amounts of information. It is becoming increasingly impor-
tant that engineers in the digital field have an extensive
education in both the hardware and software of computers.
The Computer Engineering program offers a broad
background in computers to students interested in this rapidly
developing field. The program will also help to keep the
University of Pittsburgh among the leaders in the digital area.

(1) Refer to Figure A. A screw is 3 inches long with a shaft
that is 1/4 inch in diameter at the head, tapering to one one-
thousandth inch diameter at the point. The diameter of the
head is 1/2 inch. The threads of the screw are spaced twen-
ty per inch, start 1 inch from the top of the screw and ex-
tend to the tip. The head is 1/4_ inch from top to base. If the
tip of the screw is initially touching the wall, and the screw
is then turned fully into the wall (perpendicular to the wall),
how far does the point of the screw travel?

Expand the mind
of the microchip.

Remember when electronic
calculators were considered
a luxury? Well, consider this
sign seen recently outside a
gasoline station in Schenec-
tady, New York: “Free calcu-
lator with an oil change.”
That’s just one sign of the
enormous impact micro-
chips have had on the way
we do everything — from
banking to game-playing.
But how will we use micro-
chips that are smarter,
faster, more reliable, and
less expensive to design?
How will these new micro-

chips be used to improve
systems, products, and pro-
cesses? As one GE engi-
neer puts it, “The sky's the
limitl”

That sky is replete with a
number of integrated circuit
concepts that GE is apply-
ing right now.

There’s the custom IC, a
chip that performs highly
specialized functions. Tradi-
tionally, creating this chip
has been an expensive,
_time—consuming job. -So
we're working on ways to
cut design time and cost.

We're using computer-
aided design (CAD) to
design and simulate chips
right on computer screens.
We're also developing
gate arrays, a system that

allows you to build inexpen-
sive prototype chips that
can be ‘‘played’' in systems
before the final design is
fixed.

Another area that GE is
developing is VLSI (Very
Large Scale lntegrated)
circuits. These |Cs will
eventually squeeze one
million transistors onto a
single chip.

Where will all this super
electronic power be
applied? GE engineering
manager Don Paterson
sees it this way:

“At GE you can innovate
from the system down to the
chip to create. . whatever
ignites your imagination."

In other words, you can
dream it. . .and do it.

WE BRING GOOD THINGS TO LIFE

An equal opportunity employer.
