DR. FITTERER ATTENDS U. N. CONFERENCE

Dean of the School of Engineering gives speech on the Acid Open
Hearth Process

Dr. G. R. Fitterer, dean of the Schools of En-
gineering and Mines, will attend a conference of
the Economic Commission for Latin America
(United Nations) on Iron and Steel Making, at
Bogata, Columbia, during the week of October
20.

Dr. Fitterer, director of research for the
Acid Open Hearth Research Association, will pre-
sent one paper on the Economics and another on
the Products and Specifications of the Acid Open
Hearth Process. Members of the Acid Open
Hearth Research Association are Atlantic Steel
Castings Company, Continental Foundry and
Machine Company, Commercial Steel Casting
Company, Erie Forge Company, Heppenstall Com-
pany, Macintosh-Hemphill Company, Mesta Ma-
chine Company, The Midvale Company, Ohio Steel

Foundry Company, and the United States Steel
Company.

Experts from all over the world will review
the processes of steel making with special refer-
ence to South American problems.

The first papers on the agenda will discuss
the raw material situation in South America in-
cluding the availability of scrap, ores, high-grade
fuels, and flotsam materials. A considerable por-
tion of the material will involve the problem of
reducing the available iron ores to produce a pig
iron suitable for general steel manufacture in
South America.

A considerable amount of discussion will also
involve steel making and various processes which
might be used in South American countries, The
latter portion of the program will involve a dis-
cussion of specifications for steel for numerous
types of industrial applications.

Dr. and Mrs. Fitterer Will fly from Pitts-
burgh to Miami, thence to Jamaica and Bogata,
Columbia. On the return trip they plan to take a
cruise on a boat of the Grace Line, which will stop
at various ports in the Caribbean Sea.

VACUUM-LESS

Electronics in the future will be
built around a device employing
the semi-conductor germanium
and capable of performing near-
ly all the functions of a vacuum
tube.

History even repeats itself in the field of elec-
tronics! Yesterday, “radio” was the crystal de-
tector, tomorrow, the crystal amplifier. The
“crystal” of tomorrow is the transistor, a device
employing a germanium crystal and capable of"
performing efficiently nearly all the functions of
a vacuum tube. After vacuum tubes became suf-
ficiently low priced for experimenters to afford
them in numbers, the crystal became somewhat.
of a novelty in radio. Recently, however, in the
course of fundamental research into the electrical
properties ‘of solids, an entirely new physical
principle was discovered. This principle made
possible the transistor, a vacuumless filamentless,
miniature triode.

The transistor principle rests basically on the
possibility of controlling the resistances of a ger-
manium crystal. Germanium is a crystal semi-
conductor of the silicon, a selenium type having
low resistance to current flow in one direction
and high resistance in the other. By applying
electric fields these resistances, under favorable
conditions, can be controlled and a change in the
voltage-current. relationship of one will be affect-
ed by a controlled current in the other. There are
two ways in which this effect can be accomplish-
ed. This article will deal with some of the basic
theory of the first method discovered by Bell Tele-
phone scientists, and that which is being put into
trial use in the Bell system this year. The origin-
al transistor employs two point contacts in close
proximity upon the same surface of a wafer of
germanium. These two point contacts are essen-
tial to the theory of transistor action in this type
of transistor. Further development led to a
second transistor consisting of different conduc-
tivity types of germanium, placed in such a man-
ner that transistor action phenomena occurs be-
tween surfaces of conductivity types, and is in-
dependent of the electrical contacts which are
made to the outside surfaces.

Before a treatment of transistor action in the
Type A or point Contact transistor is attempted,
the conduction phenomena of a semi—conducting
crystal will be discussed, since this phenomena is
responsible for transistor action. For all practi-
cal purposes, substances are divided electrically

into two main classes, conductors and insulators.
In metals which are good conductors there is ap-
proximately one current-carrying electron to
every atom, while in insulators there are prac-
tically no such electrons and therefore little con-
ductivity. Semi--conductors are intermediate in
property between these two. The most common
semi-conductors are sillicon, selenium, certain
metallic oxides and germanium. The conductivity
of germanium can be increased by the addition of
certain elements to the germanium. Added ele-
ments further classify germanium as to the type
of conductivity they produce in the germanium.
Elements with an unstable outer electron shell
will readily donate an electron to the germanium,
producing n-type (negative type) conductivity.
This donation of free electrons comes about
through normal electron bonding. The addition
of electrons does not, however, give a net nega-
tive charge to the germanium. If an added atom
were electrically neutral when added, it will re-
main so once in the germanium. The net result
is that adding these impurities results in more
free electrons available to carry current; the
classification n-type indicates that the conduction
is by electron flow. A p-type (positive) german-
ium is also possible, but a discussion of it is not

relevant to this article since the transistor under
discussion employs the n-type.

A basic property of the germanium under con-
sideration is its ability to carry current in two
distinctly different ways. In addition to its nor-
mal electron flow current there may exist within
the crystal a deficit conduction or conduction by
so called “holes”. Of primary importance is this
hole current. Holes are the result of fixed elec-
trons in the crystal lattice being taken from the
lattice, leaving behind a net positive charge. This
action greatly differs from the ordinary conduc-
tion action. In ordinary conduction if two ter-
minals are placed at the ends of a conductor the
conduction consists of electrons flowing in one
terminal and out the other. Electrons do not move
with the speed of light; the electrical impulse,
however, does. The electrons flowing out of the
terminal are not the same ones that flowed in
necessarily. They are the result of the electrical
signal, transmitted the length of the conductor,
and consist of the free electrons which are locat-
ed progressively nearer the positive terminal of
the conductor. At all times, however, the total
number of electrons in the conductor is constant.
Now consider a rectifying point contact made to
a sample of n-type germanium. When current
begins to flow the electronic equilibrium is upset
at the positive terminal. Instead of the free elec-
trons leaving the germanium at this point, elec-
trons are drawn out of the crystal lattice, leaving
behind a hole or a net positive charge. For the
scope of this article it will suffice to say that this
behavior occurs; how this behavior was employ-
ed to produce an amplifier is of primary con-
sideration. Once these holes have been produced
they will drift in a direction opposite to the direc-
tion of electron drift, since they represent a net
positive charge. These holes will drift or diffuse
away from the point contact through the lattice.
If they are made to come under the influence of
a second electric field they will constitute a com-
ponent of current that is additive to the electron
flow of this second field. Once the exciting field
source is removed, the crystal will return to its
normal state; electrons will fill the holes and
neutralize the charge.

Transistor action in a germaniu:n crystal is
the result of the influence this hole current will
exert upon an impressed field other than the field
that produces the holes. In the Type A or point
contact transistor developed in the Bell Telephone
Laboratories, two phosphor-bronze point contacts
are placed in close proximity (.005 — .025 cm.
d-istant) on the upper face of a small block of ger-
manium. In the simplest analogy one of these con-

tacts may correspond to the grid terminal of a
triode and is called the emitter. The other is
called the collector and may be equivalent to the
plate of a triode. A large area, low resistance
contact on the base of the germanium is the third
element of the triode. When connected separate-
ly through an external circuit, each point contact
has characteristics similar to those of the ordin-
ary germanium crystal diode rectifiers, which
have high resistance to current flow in one direc-
tion through the crystal and low resistance in the
other. When the emitter and collector contacts
are distant from one another on the germanium
surface their currents through external circuits
are independent of one another. Transistor ac-
tion, however, depends on their proximity and
while the mathematical and physical considera-
tions of proximity effects will not be dealt with,
a simiplified explanation of the action will be con-
sidered when the point contacts are in close prox-
imity.

When the two point contacts are in close prox-
imity, there is a mutual influence of the fields pro-
duced by external circuits that makes amplifica-
tion possible. In operating the transistor as an
amplifier, the emitter or input circuit is biased
in the direction of easy flow or low resistance
direction. With the emitter electrically positive,
a large part of the emitter current consists of
holes flowing away from the emitter contact. The
collector is biased in the reverse direction. The
collector current is largely electron flow from the
contact to the base electrode. Biased in the re-
verse direction, the collector is negative with re-
spect to the emitter. Because of the relative
nearness of the collector to the emitter, with re-
spect to the base electrode, the collector attracts
the positively charged holes flowing from the
emitter. To fill these holes the collector electron
current could increase. In this manner the holes
could be considered directly additive to the col-
lector current. Now if these holes only added to
the collector current and no other phenomena
were present, the collector current would vary
directly as the number of holes present. Then

the University of Illinois in 1944. After
studying Marine Engineering at the Naval
Academy, he received his commission in
1945. He attended Pre-Radar School at
Bowdoin College, after which he served
as an engineering officer on an AKA. He
started teaching in the Electrical Engin-
eering Department at Pitt in September
1946. In 1950, he was awarded his M. S.

of last semester he left Pitt to become

Division of the National Carbon Com-

pany.

One question which may arise in the
mind of an engineer with a profes-
sionally mature outlook is how he
may enhance himself and his profes-
sion through service to mankind. To
such a man, the world today offers
many answers, with both challenge
and opportunity. To cover all ser-
vices in a few paragraphs would be
impossible, but among them exists a
group often overlooked by those
whose training has adhered to a spe-
cialized field. This group stems from
the need for co-operation with other
professions, professions which can
benefit through the application of en.
gineering techniques, products and
services.

Such co-operation already exists be-
tween the professions of Engineering
and Medicine in the embryonic field
of medical electronics, Most of us are
aware of the electrocardiograph, elec-
tro-encephalograph, and X-ray since
they have been in use for a number of
years. Perhaps less well known is the
instrument developed by Professor
J. F. Pierce of the University of Pitts-
burgh for the administration of pre-
cise doses of electro-shock. There is
the use of the cyclotron and other
atom smashers for the activation of
substances to be used as biological
tracers and in certain types of ther-
apy. And there is, of course, the fami-
liar hearing aid. Only a few of many
noteworthy contributions have been
mentioned; even so, many more still
need to be made. There is as yet no
instrument which measures pain in-

12

   

dependently of individual stoicism.
The X-ray is at present capable only
of still photography, but there is a
need for rapid sequence or motion
X-ray photography. If an audio am-
plifier can help the deaf to hear,
might not a miniature television cam-
era, properly adapted, restore at least
partial vision to the blind? Might not
an amputee, who is deprived of the
kinesthetic sense, which was present
in the skin of his lost limb, be given
an electronic substitute to aid him in
moving with greater assurance?

One of the great problems confront-
ing man today is the so-called “cul-
tural lag,” the advancement of the
physical sciences beyond the social
sciences. Man stands in possession of
a knowledge of atomic energy and
bacteriology which, in the opinion of
some, could bring about his extinc-
tion. Unfortunately his cultural posi-
tion does not preclude the use of this
knowledge for that purpose.

The social scientist, whose prob-
lem is man’s cultural position, blames
this lag, in large measure, upon the
difficulty of running controlled ex-
periments in his field. This difficulty
leads to a shortage of adequate data,
hence to serious trouble in analyzing
a problem, so that the solution may be
viewed with confidence. Some relief
from this dilemma is offered by the
statistician who establishes, in a scien-
tific manner, just how much confi-
dence may be placed in any conclu-
sion. Is it not possible that the engi-
neer could produce instruments

 

capable of precise measurement of
hitherto unavailable quantities? If
so, he may increase the data" avail-
able from each sample, and so increase
the reliability of each conclusion.

Norbert Weiner in his book, Cyber-
netics, brings out the fact that the
processes of controlling various phys-
ical systems are described by the same
mathematical laws as the control pro-
cesses carried on in the brain and
nervous system of an animal. He fur-
ther describes the case of an electron-
ic scanning device which was devel-
oped to ‘convert the information con-
tained on a printed page to audible
signals, in order that the blind might
read. The diagram of this device was
shown to a surgeon who supposed it
to be a section of the visual cortex
of the human brain. If such analogues
exist, and if accurate measurement
is possible in the physical case, does
it not suggst the possibility of such
measurement in the physiological
case? If these measurements could be
made and used for the improvement
of our understanding of human be-
havior, the service to our entire so-
ciety might be enormous.

Does the idea seem beyond belief?
Recall how impossible human flight,
or television, or atomic energy would
have seemed even to our recent an-
cestors. Yet this challenge was ac-
cepted by men with vision, ability,
faith and determination. They have
overcome tremendous obstacles to
give us these scientific gifts which
we now enjoy. Was their challenge
any less than yours?

OCTOBER, 1952

A new source of energy comparable in magni-
tude to atomic fission may soon be added to the
world’s fuel reserves. This source is the under-
ground gasification of coal, a process conceived
nearly a century ago by the Russian chemist Men-
deleev, but which is just now being investigated.
Hitherto, a bountiful oil and coal supply had led
the world’s technologists to scorn a process that
demanded such a great deal of testing and ex-
perimenting; two world wars and a rapidly
dwindling fuel supply have changed their atti-
tude. Now engineers in the United States, Rus-
sia, France, Sweden, Belgium, and Italy are in-
dustriously applying themselves to the exploita-
tion of this effortless fuel production, and their
findings, although not conclusive, are encouraging
indeed.

The chemistry of the process is not involved.
Coal is burned underground in a deficiency of
oxygen. In the normal combustion of coal, carbon
dioxide gas is produced by the actual burning,
and other volatile substances such as methane

gas and hydrogen gas are liberated by the heat
and burn also. In an oxygen-deficient atmos-
phere, however, the carbon and oxygen combina-
tion forms a high percentage of highly inflam-
mable carbon monoxide gas, and the oxygen de-
ficiency prevents further combustion of the hy-
drogen and methane gases. The result is a gas-
eous mixture that has a calorific value of up-
wards to 300 Btu per cubic foot (as compared to
the 1000 Btu value of natural gas) .

In practice, of course, the procedure is not
so simple, and such technical problems as the
proper mixture of air and oxygen, the pressure
at which the blast should be administered, and the
most efficient combustion rate have still to be
completely solved. At present two methods of
underground gasification have been thoroughly
investigated, and a brief description of each may
further emphasize the basic technicalities of the
general process,

First, the stream method of underground gas-
ification is now in commercial operation in Russia
and has been tried on an experimental scale in
America. In Russia, two or more holes, in pairs,
about three hundred feet apart, were bored down
to the floor of the coal seam, where they were
joined by a horizontal entry, as in Figure 1. Com-

bustion was started at the base of the blast shaft
and the gases withdrawn through the other shaft.
Reversal of flow was necessary at intervals to
avoid burning out the panel unsymmetrically.
When an air blast was used, the gas produced was
of low quality; however, when the blast was en-
riched with oxygen, an improvement in quality
resulted approximately in proportion to the in-
crease in oxygen content. Further experimenta-
tion led to the use of a mixture of enriched air and
steam, which produced a gas having a calorific
value of 295 Btu per cubic foot.

The second method, shown in figure 2, illus-
trates the percolation method of underground
gasification. This method depends on the perco-
lation or filtration of gas through fissures and
shrinkage cracks formed in the coal when it is
heated. In practice, boreholes about 18 inches in
diameter are driven from the surface in a regular
arrangement. Combustion is maintained by oxy-
gen-enriched air supplied at a pressure of 3 to 5
atmospheres through the central pipe. At first
the gases pass up the annulus around the central
pipe, but eventually fissures and shrinkage cracks
form to an extent sufficient to permit the gases to
percolate through the seam to an adjacent bore-
hold. As the reaction spreads, surrounding bore-
holes are fired until the continuous process has
gasified an entire seam of coal. It is believed that
the percolation method will develop into a practi-
cal gasification method. Russia is even now pro-
ducing 100 million cubic feet of gas per day by
this method, or a volume that is approximately

Russia’s production, on a commercial scale
shows that their gasification process has been de-
veloped to a much higher degree of efficiency
than that attained by other countries of the world.
However, the Russian “Iron Curtain” policy has
made it impossible to fully ascertain either their
degree of efficiency or the technology of their
processes. We must, therefore, examine instead
experimental operations in America and abroad
to determine the feasibility of underground gasi-

ication.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Possibly the most important of the world-
wide tests is the experiment being conducted
jointly by the U. S. Bureau of Mines and the Ala-
bama Power Company near Gorgas, Alabama.
To date, two test operations have been completed.
The first one, in 1947, employed the stream meth-
od and produced gas having a maximum calorific
value of 286 Btu per cubic foot. Data on the sec-
ond test, which employed the percolation method,
proved conclusively that combustion and gasifica-
tion can be maintained until the coal is completely
consumed in place underground. As revealed by
subsequent examination of the panel, there were
no segregated islands of unburned coal in the ash
or clinker portions.

Difficulties, however, in attaining good con-
tact between the forced air and the burning seam
caused the Gorgas engineers to turn to a method,

somewhat different from the two previously used,
that has been tested by the University of Missouri
at a test site near Hume, Mo. This method em-
ploys the use of electric current to fire the coal and
is known as the electro-carbonization technique.
In practice, boreholes are sunk to the floor of the
coal seam and six inch steel casings carrying elec-
trical conductors are inserted. At the bottom of
each casing is an electrode. Then a current flow
is established between pairs of electrodes and
maintained until a burn path is set up between the
two electrodes. At this point the current is turned
off and air is forced down one borehole to gasi-

fy the underground coke. Gas is then forced up
the companion hole. With this method, gas having
an average heating value of 186 Btu per cubic foot
has been obtained. Periodically, the airflow is
reversed, and Gorgas engineers are also experi-
menting with using preheated and compressed air
in order to raise the Btu value of the product. The
important advantage in the electro-carbonization
technique is the porosity obtained by the electric
carbonization of the coal. This porosity permits
a flow of forced air to circulate easily between
the boreholes and produce the manufactured gas.

French experiments in underground gasifi.
cation have not been concluded, but work is being
carried out in the Djerada anthracite field in
Morocco. The fact that anthracite coal contains
only 5 per cent of volatile matter (as compared to
31 per cent volatile matter in bituminous coal)
will necessitate somewhat different technical pro-
cesses than our own, for the problem will largely
be the conversion of coal into carbon monoxide.
It is expected that the French findings will be
valuable in formulating plans for the gasifica-
tion of American anthracite coal.

ATOMIC ENERGY REACTOR

The first atomic energy reactor to
operate in California was revealed re-
cently when North American Avia-
tion’s water boiler neutron source
was demonstrated at the company’s
Downey plant.

Designed and built by North Am-
erican’s Atomic Energy Research De-
partment, the “baby” reactor is being
used to further the development of
reactors and associated projects.

While the water boiler reactor is
quite small in comparison with reac-
tors for producing fissionable mater-
ials or useful power, from it may be
obtained information of value in de-
signing improved reactors for various
purposes. The water boiler is a part
of a facility for making reactor phy-
s1cs measurements to enlarge the
basic information upon which reactor
development is based. The water
boiler neutron source will supply the
neutrons needed for these measure-
ments.

The reactor is generally similar in
construction and physical size to
other low power water boiler reac-
tors in the United States. A differ-
ence is that the very low power of the
reactor at North American, less than
one watt, makes a cooling system un-
necessary. A reactor of such small
power is not used as a producer of
fissionable materials.

The exterior of the reactor is shield-
ed by a housing of two-foot thick con.
crete blocks each weighing 1,000
pounds, forming a structure about the
size of a single car garage. The con-

OCTOBER, 1952

crete surrounds a cylindrical graphite
reflector five feet in diameter and six
feet high, formed by stacking graph-
ite bars horizontally inside a steel
tank. The reflector surrounds the re.
actor core, a stainless steel sphere
one foot in diameter. The production
of atomic energy takes place inside
this sphere which contains a Uranium
235 enriched uranyl nitrate solution.
It is from the nuclear fission of this
material in a water solution that the
reactor derives its power—-and its
name “water boiler."

The rate of fission, the production
of atomic power, is controlled by a
system of control rods which can be
moved horizontally through the con-
crete and graphite to the core. These
rods, made of cadmium, boron, and
aluminum, have a retarding effect up-
on the nuclear fission inside the core.
Depending upon their nearness to the
core, the rods can control the fission
from a “stop” to “wide open” rate of
reaction. The graphite reflector
“bounces back” neutrons which come
from the core. Any stray neutrons
which escape the reflector are trapped
by the concrete and engineers working
outside the reactor are shielded from
any harmful effects of atomic radia-
tion.

The water boiler type reactor is
unique in its safety features. Although
the reactor is constructed to be com-
pletely controllable by mechanical
means, it has inherent features which
contribute to its safety. If the mech-
anical controls were to fail and a “run
away” fission process resulted, heat

produced by the process would raise
the temperature of the water solu-
tion sufficiently to stop power pro-
duction. At this point emergency
control rods could be employed to re.
store the reactor to a neutral condi-
tion.

Materials to be bombarded by neu-
trons and thus made radioactive can
be placed inside the core by means of
a hole which connects through a chan-
nel to the outside of the reactor. An
instrument panel near the water boil-
er records the amount of radiation
for these experiments. The control
rods to regulate the rate of power
production are also operated from
the instrument panel_

Draw ME perpendicular to AB at

bisector of the angle C, intersecting
the line ME in 0.

Draw the perpendiculars, OF and

Then ON equals OF.

Therefore CF equals CN.

Join A and 0; also join 0 and B.

Then A0 equals BO.

Therefore the triangles AOF and

Therefore AF equals BN.

Therefore AF plus FC equals CN

CARBONIZATION

A new coal chemical industry

bids for recognition.

Ever since the successful introduction of
coke as a reducing agent in the steel industry in
1835, scientists have been concerned with the
chemistry of coal. Long used as a fuel, coal has
grown in importance in the advancement of mo-
dern science in the drug, dye and plastic indus-
tries. During World War I, the supply of such
common household items as aspirin and dyes was
seriously short. Salicylic acid, the basic ingredient
of aspirin and benzene from which aniline dyes
are derived, were produced by the German coal
chemical industry. Since then, the coal by-pro-
ducts industries of the United States have made

notable strides, The flourishing steel industry .

has given added impetus to the economic utiliza-
tion of the rich vapors given off when coal is dis-
tilled to coke at temperatures around 2,000° F.
The products of this high temperature carboniza-
tion process are coke, ammonia, fuel gas, and coal
tar. The tar fraction is separated by distillation
and extraction into benzene, toluene, xylene, cre-
sylic acid, and phenolic compounds in demand for
the manufacturing of plastics having a phenol-
formaldehyde structure such as bakelite. As an
indication of the importance of these by-product
chemicals, during 1950 the receipts for the coal
chemicals amounted to 274 million dollars, while
the value of the coke produced was 77 million dol-
lars. Thus with such a flourishing high tempera-
ture carbonization industry you might well won-
der why the necessity of low temperature carbon-
ization.

The high temperature coke process requires
a high grade metallurgical coal as a raw material
and the coke product is not easily ignited. In con-
trast to this, the low temperature carbonization
process uses the pulverized slack soft coals which
have little market value and would otherwise be
a loss to the coal companies. Mechanical mining
methods in popular use today produce a greater
percentage of this pulverized coal than older

methods of mining. If the coal companies could
find a use whereby the return for this otherwise
unmarketable coal would pay for the overall costs
of cleaning and mining, the larger sizes of this
firm structure coal would carry the profit burden.
With this incentive the Pittsburgh Consolidation
Coal Company embarked upon a research program
for developing the L. T. C. process so that it
might be carried out on a commercial scale.

It has been known that for all coals there is
a well defined decomposition point between 1300°
and 1400° F. which corresponds to a marked in-
crease in the quantity of hydrogen gas envolved.
Below 850° F. a large percentage of the gases
given off are ethane and higher members of the
paraffin series. Therefore, by using reduced tem-

peratures, that is, temperatures ranging between-

800° F. and 1300° F., it is possible to keep the sec-
ondary decomposition of the volatiles at a mini-
mum. Such a process produces a relatively low
yield of gas rich in B. T. U. content; a maximum
yield of coal tar; and a semi-coke residue of active
carbon which is readily combustible.

Many L. T. C. plants have been built in this
country, but at the present time only two are op-
erating on a full time commercial basis. The Le-
heigh Briquetting Company of Leheigh, North
Dakota uses the Lurgi process, the Pittsburgh
Consolidation Coal Company at Imperial, Penn-
sylvania uses the Wisner process. The P. C, C. Co.
plant was completed in 1949 after an investment
of over 3 million dollars. Although the theory of
L. T. C. was well developed, the conversion to
actual practice was an expensive trial and error
project.

Essentially the carbonization cycle consists
of mixing the fine coal with breeze (very fine
processed.di_sco)_, preheating in a roaster-storage
system, _distillation in the carbonizer, and finally
the semi-coke 1S discharged from the carbonizer
and allowed to cool.

19

The mixing of the coal with breeze must be
in a definite ratio so that the plastic mass formed
in the carbonizer does not become too liquid. The
mixture is then roasted for forty minutes so as to
drive off all the moisture and raise the tempera-
ture of the coal to 600° F. before delivery to the
retort. The heating in the roaster is accomplished
in stages. The raw charge is admitted on the
lower deck where the temperature is raised gradu-
ally and air admitted to allow some oxidation. On
a conveyor system the charge moves on to a second
and third grate while the temperature increases
constantly. By the time the mixture has reached
the top grate the temperature has increased to
600° F. It is imperative that the temperature in
the roaster should not be allowed to go above 640°
F. since this hot material is highly reactive and
will fire easily. Above the lower grate oxidation
is not permitted. The heated coal is maintained
at 600° F. in the roaster-storage decks until being
charged into the carbonizer.

Because of the extremely poor conductivity
of coal and its tendency to cake when it becomes
plastic through heating, the problem of over-and-
under-baking was a serious one. In order to pro-
duce a marketable semi-coke, it was necessary to
develope a rotating type carbonizer which would
turn out regular shaped fuel having consistent
decomposition state, and ranging in size from two
to three inches, During the experimental work
in determining the temperature range and the
duration of the distillation time, it was found that
as the gasket seal on the carbonizer became more
and more worn, the tendency to form small indi-
vidually rounded pieces increased. Consequently
the design of the Wisner carbonizer was changed
to allow slight oxidation to take place by allowing
an opening to the atmosphere at one end of the
retort. The slight oxidation burns out some tar,
making the disco harder and less smokey. The
vapors are removed at the opposite end by re-
duced pressure.

The size of the disco was further found to be
a function of the diameter of the carbonizer and
the depth of the charge. As shown in the dia-
gram, the carbonizer consists of two concentric
cylinders, The charge is placed in the inside cyl-
inder and the heating is accomplished by the pass-
age of hot gases through the annular space.

During the distillation, the carbonizer rotates
with a peripheral velocity of 75 fpm. This rota-
tion effects mixing and the conveyance of the
charge through the carbonizer. While in the car-
bonizer the coal and recycle breeze pass through
a dry-wet-dry cycle. The mixture is raised from

600° _F. to its softening temperature of 800° F.
in thirty minutes. lt remains in the plastic state
for_ about fifteen minutes. The plastic mass then
solidifies sufficiently for individual pieces formed
during the rotation to_ retain their identity. This
solidifying stage requires about ten minutes dur-
ing which the temperature is raised to 875° F.
A cold extension is provided as a part of the car-
bonizer_where the hot disco cools to 800° F. before
being discharged. Each ton of dry coal processed

INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING

The Pittsburgh Senior Chapter of
the American Institute of Industrial
Engineers held a reorganization meet-
ing on October 14 at 8 p.m. A talk
entitled “Pittsburgh Builds for the
Future” was given by a prominent
speaker.

At this meeting plans were consid-
ered to have Warren Lamb address
the November meeting. Mr. Lamb, a
noted English expert on management
techniques, is currently making a
speaking tour of the United States.

Andrew Strenio, I. E. ’49, has been
promoted to head of the Salvage De-
partment of the Erie Works of the
General Electric Company. Mr. Stre-
nio, upon graduation, accepted em-
ployment with the General Electric
Co. and participated in their Super-
visory Training Program.

The Delco division of General Mo-
tors Corporation at Dayton, Ohio, has
been attracting quite a few Pitt grad-
uates in the Industrial Engineering
field. Recent graduates employed by
GM there include Harry Bailey, Ern-
est Barbaro, Joseph Gwozdy, Daniel

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING

Edward L. Keller and the Meter
Division of the Duquesne Light Com-
pany are synonymous. Mr. Keller
began his service with the Company
in 1919, and, in 1925, became Fore-
man of the Standards Laboratory of
the Meter Division. He entered night
school at the University of Pittsburgh
in 1925 and was graduated with a B.S.
degree in Electrical Engineering in
1932. His advancement to the position
of Superintendent of the Meter Divi-
sion occured in 1948.

As Superintendent of the Meter
Division he is responsible for all the
work done by this Division. It is the
responsibility of this Division to see
that an accurate measurement is
made of the electric energy consumed
by each of over 400,000 customers.
It also is responsible for the main-

OCTOBER, 1952

tenance and accuracy of all other
electrical instruments used by the
Company.

The Meter Division is subdivided
into eight sections. The Standards
Laboratory, High Tension Laboratory,
Meter Shop, and the Single Phase
Test, Field Test, Installation, Demand
Reading, and Meter Service Sections.

Ed Keller has spent most of his
years of service in the Standards
Laboratory. Primarily through his
efforts this Laboratory is one of the
best equipped electric utility labor-
atories in the United States. Its equip-
ment is such that measurements of
a thousandth of a volt or a million
volts, a millionth of an ampere or
50,000 amperes can be made with a
high degree of accuracy.

The Standards Laboratory main-
tains primary precision electrical
standards, and calibrates and repairs
all electrical instruments and bridges
used by the Company. Special tests
and development work are a further
important part of its activities.

It is in this latter field that Ed
Keller has devoted most of his time
and energy_ The result of his work
has been the development of a num-
ber of measuring devices and im-
provements in electric meters.

One of his outstanding develop-
ments is a mechanical high speed
timer that can time intervals in the
order of five millionths of a second.
Several of these timers are now being
used by the University of Pittsburgh
in their work for the U. S. Navy.

Another important contribution
was his early work in adapting a ther-
mal demand register as part of a
watthour meter.

In the field of protective equip-
ment he has developed two simple
and inexpensive means of protecting
a meter from damage by lightning
surges. One of these is an aluminum
shield that is inserted inside the
glass cover of a watthour meter.
Today, this method of protection is
being used by utilities throughout
the United States.

The other and more recent devel-
opment is a set of surge pins that
are inserted in the base of a socket
meter to protect the potential coil
from damage by lightning surges.

Ed Keller is well-recognized for

his contributions in the field of elec-
tric metering. He is a member of
state and national metering commit-
tees.

Much of Ed Keller’s time is now
taken up with policy determination,
personnel, and paper work, which are
involved in the superintendent's
office, but his first love in still the
work of the Standards Laboratory.

CHEMICAL ENGINERING

Mr. Thomas J. Regan was graduated
with high honor from the Chemical
Engineering Department of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in February of
1949. At that time, as was the case
during his entire undergraduate
career, he was engaged in part time
employment on the fellowship of the
Carbide and Carbon Chemical Com-
pany at the Mellon Institute of Indus-
trial Research. Shortly after gradua-
tion he joined the Research and De-
velopment Division of the Pittsburgh
Consolidation Coal Company which
was, at that time, investigating in col-
laboration with the Standard Oil De-
velopment, the possibility of utilizing
fluidized gasification of coal as a
source of cheap synthesis gas for
liquid fuels. His first duties were
that of a Shift Supervisor in the pilot
plant which was located in Library,
Pennsylvania. This program was ter-
minated in the early part of 1950. At
that time Mr. Regan assumed the
duties of a Shift Supervisor on a pro-
ject to develop a process involving
low temperature carbonization in a
fluidized bed. He was actively en-
gaged in this work until the fall of
1950 when the company decided to
investigate the feasability of trans-
porting coal in slurry form via a pipe-
line as a means of circumventing the
ever increasing freight rates. As a
result, Mr. Regan was entrusted with
the responsibility of directing the
pilot plant work for this venture. The
answers looked very promising both
from an operating and an economic
standpoint so the company subse-
quently erected a full scale demon-
stration plant near Cadiz, Ohio. At
present, Mr. Regan is in charge of
this project which has been in opera-
tion since November, 1951.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

In the operation of a radar system, the amount
of energy reflected from small targets is
very minute. The over-all sensitivity and
range of radar depend equally upon effec-

 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

tively generating and transmitting consid-
erable power at microwave frequencies-
and upon effectively receiving and ampli-
fying very weak echo signals. ’

An important limitation in receiver sensi-
tivity is imposed by noise that is created
within the receiving tubes—and caused by
random motion of electrons. Because the
reduction of tube noise could make avail-
able improved techniques to the designer
of many types of microwave systems, a
project is under way at Hughes Research
and Development Laboratories to expand
our understanding of noise phenomena at

high frequencies.

Studies in tube noise are being made with
the newly developed traveling-wave tube,
shown on this page in actual size. This tube
has the unique ability to amplify micro-
wave signals over a wide frequency range,
but its excessive noise has hitherto pre-
vented its extensive use. Methods of re-

ducing noise in the traveling-wave tube
are being devised and tested at Hughes,
and the recently obtained noise ﬁgure of
13 decibels at a frequency of 10,000 mega-
cycles is proving of considerable interest
to systems designers.

if amplification is to result. If these holes, in-
stead of merely adding to the collector current,
are considered to alter the space charge present
at the collector surface junction, the collector
current may change more than any change in the
emitter current. Scientists believe that this hole
current increases the space charge density and
field strength about the collector in such a manner
that it is actually easier for electrons to flow out
of the collector. If more electrons flow out then
the current has increased. But Ohm’s Law must
be served. If the source voltage remains constant,
as it does, and the current increases then only one
thing can have occured. The high resistance
within the crystal has been reduced. If this hole
current is varied in some prescribed manner, the
decrease in resistance and corresponding increase
in collector conduction will vary with it and in
such a manner that amplification results, since
the increase in conduction is many times greater
than the hole current that produces it. Such de-
sired variation would be realized with an a. c.
signal source in the emitter circuit; this varia-
tion would act as the control grid signal in a
vacuum tube triode and as in a vacuum tube pro-
duce identical variations of larger amplitude in
the plate or collector circuit.

The theory of current amplification occuring
in the collector circuit is well understood. But
the design of an actual circuit to utilize this phe-
nomena is another matter. It is not just a case
of exchanging the two elements in a conventional
amplifier circuit. The vacuum tube and the
transistor are different in many important re-
spects. The ordinary grounded cathode tube cir-
cuit, most common in the range of frequencies
that can be handled effectively by a transistor, is
essentially a voltage amplifying device with a

26

high input impedance and a relatively low output
impedance while the grounded base transistor
circuit exhibits the opposite properties. Consider
further the grid to emitter and plate to collector
analogy, although this analogy may be varied de-
pending on the function of the circuit desired. A
vacuum tube grid is biased in the reverse direc-
tion or negative with respect to the cathode and
in the ordinary amplifier no grid current is
drawn. The n-type transistor emitter is biased
in the forward direction or positive with respect
to the base electrode and transistor action de-
pends on the hole current flowing in this circuit.
The vacuum tube plate and the collector voltage
relationships are also reversed. In addition the
transistor is a current amplifier and has no phase
shift between input and output. Since the in-
ternal structure and external parameters are so
markedly different for the two elements, to re-
place the one by the other is to say that the ex-
ternal network for a transistor must essentially
reverse the holes of voltages and currents in addi-
tion to relating the impedance differences for the
two. That this has been successfully done is
evidenced by the wide variety of functions in
which the point contact type transistor is replac-
ing the vacuum tube in modern electronic cir-
cuitry.

What are the criteria for selecting the tran-
sistor over the vacuum tube for a specific circuit
function? No one factor alone, unless it be min-
iaturization, is sufficient reason for the apparent
desirability for transistors in electronic circuits.
Performance, reliability and economy are factors
that must be considered. The Type A transistor
is roughly 1/2 inches long and 3/16 inches in
diameter. It is smaller and lighter than any
available vacuum tube.
needs no filament. Durability and life far ex-
ceed any vacuum tube. No specific performance

attempted to present some of the fundamentals
behind transistor action. In the final analysis
Bell Telephone announced recently that their lab-
oratories have made transistors of this point con-
tact type that are as uniform in performance as
vacuum tubes, and that they will be used in the
equipment for the current long distance dialing

It sparked an

electronic revolution!

 

Perhaps you've heard something about the
transistor—a tiny and mechanically simple elec-
tronic device based on an entirely new prin-
ciple. It can do many things a vacuum tube can
do—yet its greatest possibilities may lie in ap-
plications where vacuum tubes have not been
used.

A few years ago this revolutionary device was
invented and experimentally made by scien-
tists at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Today,
several types of transistors are in production
at Western Electric——manufacturing unit of
the Bell System.

This didn't just happen! Its manufacture is the
result of a lot of teamwork by Western Electric
engineers of varied skills and training.

Transistors are unimpressive looking little
things, but don’t let that fool you! The most

are required in their production. In one type of
transistor there are three thin adjacent regions
of germanium, each region containing chemical
elements in exact quantities, the whole unit
being no larger than the head of a match! Suit-
able leads, or wires, must be positioned in proper
relation to these layers with utmost accuracy,
using microscopes and oscilloscopes.

Transistors can do many things: transform
radio energy for driving a telephone receiver or
loudspeaker—amplify weak signals——generate
a-c current——convert a-c to d-c—respond to
light——increase, decrease or halt the ﬂow of
current. Small and rugged, they’re going to work
today in the Bell System and in varied types of
military equipment.

Quantity producing these mighty mites——with
laboratory precision—is typical of many for-
ward-looking engineering projects at Western

pounds is given off in gases, vapors, and coal tar.
The tar fraction is sixteen to seventeen gallons.
Gases evolved from the carbonizer are scrub-
bed with sulfuric acid causing ammonium sul-
phate to precipitate out. The gases and vapors
are then further cooled causing the vapors to
condense and the fuel gases pass on through where
the excess gases are removed and the remainder
is used in the heating plant. It is interesting to
note both the difference in quantity and quality
of these by-products as compared with high tem-
perature carbonization. The ammonia gas pro-
duced by L. T. C. is considerably less than by high

temperature carbonization. However, the profit-
able recovery of ammonia today, produced by
either carbonization process, is a real problem
due to the availability of low priced synthetic
ammonia.

The by-product heating gas recovered is more
than sufficient for the heating cycle. Although
less in quantity than the gas evolved by high tem-
perature carbonization process, it is of much high-
er calorific value owing to its unusual richness
in saturated and unsaturated paraffin hydrocar-
bons. It may be used to enrich low B. T. U. pro-
ducer gas. At the present time no further use of
this gas is being made, but it has been suggested
that polymerization of the fuel gases would pro-
duce marketable organic compounds among which
motor fuel would predominate.

The cola tars resulting from L. T. C. are
greater in quantity and of more complex structure
than high temperature tars. The high tempera-
ture tars are benzenoid in character and the meth-
ods of separation and use of these aromatic com-
pounds is well established. This is not the case
with low temperature tars. Two main types of
compounds have been identified in L. T. C. tars.
The first is classified as neutral hydrocarbons
resembling paraffin-based crude petroleum. The
second is classified as phenolic compounds which
contain one or more hydroxyl groups. These pro-
duct tars have been the object of many ambitious
schemes which have not been realized as yet. Un-
til such a time as complete separation of these
organic compounds can be accomplished, the L. T.
C. tar fraction will continue to yield the ordinary
distillation products such as cresylic acid used in
the plastics industry, for disinfectants, and flota-
tion reagents; the phenolic fraction used for mer-
cerizing cotton and the manufacture of plastics;
creosote oil used for treating timber; benzene used
for increasing the octane rating of gasoline and
the manufacture of dyes; and a distillate suit-
able as a fuel oil, The pitch residue may be fur-
ther refined to produce electrode carbon for com-
mercial electrolysis.

Even the charred “Disco” residue of the car-
bonization may be further refined. High tem-
perature coke is a graphitic form of carbon which
is not highly reactive as is low temperature semi-

28

coke. This low temperature char is a reactive
form of carbon. When steam at 17 42° F. is passed
over fluidized semi-coke, 75% of the fuel is gasi-
fied. This gas, known as synthesis gas, may be
utilized as a fuel gas or may be further reacted
in a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactor for the pro-
duction of synthetic gasoline and chemicals. 'I‘he
remaining 25% residue is activated carbon use-
ful in gas respirators, solvent extraction, and de-
colorization of crude sugar and edible oils.

At the present time, even with our lack of
knowledge of fractionalization of low temperature
tar, the carbonization of slack has raised the
value of the low grade coal from $4.75 per ton to
between $8 and $9 per ton. However, in View of
the increasing conversion by domestic consumers
from solid fuels to gas and oil-fired burners, the
coal industry is faced with the necessity of adapt-
ing ther carbonization products to the industrial
market.

The Research and Development Division of
the Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company is
presently investigating methods of adapting L.
T. C. char for use in the iron and steel industries.
The steel companies stand as obvious prospective
consumers of this semi-coke except for one im-
portant obstacle. The blast furnaces of this coun-
try require the use of a coke having a firm struc-
ture capable of withstanding heavy pressures
without crumbling. The char produced by exist-
ing methods does not have this property, Adapta-
tion of L. T. C. char to the iron industry therefore
necessitates a change in the method of briquetting
such that the char product would incorporate the
desired structural strength.

Still there remains another industry Whose
coal consumption has risen steadily and conse-
quently merits investigation for possible substi-
tution of char in place of coal. Today the electric
power industries use more coal than any other
single group. _

In order to find the power industry an inter-
ested consumer, the cost of the char must neces-
sarily be reduced considerably below its present
price. This could only be possible if the tar pro-
ducts of the carbonization Were capable of realiz-
ing greater value.

Experimental research on fluidized carbon-
ization and subsequent distillaton and extraction
of the coal tar product has now reached the pilot-
plant stage, the P. C. C. Co. expects to acquire
the data necessary for extrapolation of the fluid
ized process to a full scale commercial plant. The
future of low temperature carbonization is heavi-
ly dependent upon the success of this latest ven-
ture.

An investigation of the economic aspects of
underground gasification is of course a necessity
when trying to ascertain the commercial y__alue of
the process, and although commercial gasification
has not yet been tried in the United States, Rus-
sian claims and American findings combine to
form a definite economic picture. From a com-
mercial standpoint, Russian figures are perhaps
the more valuable; they show that gas having a
calorific value of 150 Btu per cubic foot was pro-
duced by underground gasification at a cost of
about one-third of that of normal producer gas.
The capital investment for underground gasifica-
tion by the stream method is given in the same
source as 60 to 70 per cent of that for a normal
producer plant of equivalent capacity, whereas
gasification by the percolation method gives a
further saving of 15 to 20 per cent over the capi-
tal cost of the stream method. However, experts
have commented on the economics of underground
gasification in the United States and concluded
that costs would be prohibitive in the present state
of our fuel economy and our knowledge of fuel
technology. They point out that the Russian

lans call for a concentration of fuel-consuming
industries in the coal fields, thereby using the
low-quality gas to advantage; in the United States
a good percentage of the production would be in-
tended for consumption at a considerable distance
from the mines, Since in practice the cost of
transmission over any sizable distance is prohibi-
tive for producer gas and water gas, it is thought
that the delivered cost of enriched gas from un-
derground gasification would also be prohibitive.
The potential utilization of gas from underground
gasification then appears to lie in processes which
can make direct use of the gas as it flows from the
coal field. Under this classification would fall
the gas turbine production of electricity and__ the
new, vitally important synthesis of gasoline and
liquid fuels. Synthetic fuels are made by two
German processes. In the Bergius process the
cost of the “feed gas” represents 50 per cent of
the cost of the finished product, and in the Fisch-
er-Tropsch process it represents 60 to 70 per cent.
Synthetic gasoline plants placed over under-
ground gasification fields would obtain feed gas
for about one-fifth the cost of coal gas produced
in above-ground plants. This should cut the price
of gasoline from coal by nearly one-half, enough
to make synthetic gasoline as desirable as the
natural product from the standpoint of price as
well as of efficiency.

Thus it appears that at the very least, the
underground gasification of coal points to the
exploitation of coal seams presently too thin, im-
pure, or deep for mining commercially, and to
worked-out mines in which some coal remains.
Dominant research interest, however, concerns
the production of feed gas for manufacturing
synthetic gasoline and liquid fuels. It is becom-
ing more apparent every day that the United
States must have a tremendous supply of gasoline
and liquid fuels to maintain its position as world
leader. The conception of a new source of cheap,
accessible raw material for synthesis might well
be of vast importance to us in the years to come.

How agricultural engineers solve
3 design problems at once

   

Designing farm machinery applications like the through
shafts of disk harrows presents three big problems to
agricultural engineers: 1) combination loads, 2) dirt,
3) ease of operation. Engineers solve all three problems
at once by designing the shafts on Timken® tapered
roller bearings. Because they are tapered, Timken bear-
ings carry both radial and thrust loads in any combina-
tion. They keep housings and shafts concentric, making
closures more effective. Dirt stays out—lubricant in.
And they keep shafts turning easily because of their true
rolling motion and incredibly smooth surface ﬁnish.

How to mount disk
harrow slralts on TlMKEN®bearings

Two single-row Type TS Timken bearings are indirectly
mounted on a stationary shaft in a rotating disk assembly.
The bearing cups are press-ﬁtted against snap rings. The
bearings are adjusted by means of shims between the bear-
ing cone and shaft shoulder. A special spring-backed rub-
bing seal assures maximum protection to the bearings. The
rubbing seal itself is protected by a shield ﬁtted about the
closure assembly.

ANSWERS TO SKYCAPERS

We hope this isn’t necessary, but eighty min-
utes is the same as an hour and twenty minutes.
The engineering student would have saved 536,
870,912 pennies and the traveler should have
gone only 25 miles. The geometry expose is self
explanatory (?), while the three gamblers start-
ed out with 39, 21 and 12 dollars respectively,

The book problem is a little more difficult,
but letting x be the number and price of the
books bought by a father and y the number and
price of the books bought by his son, we find that
in each case x2 -|— Y2 equals 65. The possibilities
of solution are 8 and 1 or 7 and 4. The latter is
eliminated because Dick only bought one book,
and deductive reasoning leads to the conclusion
that Peter is Dick’s father.

Continuing, the number of mangoes bought
was 79, it would take 29 days to cover the area
with lentils, and the gun should be packed in a
square flat box one yard on a side. In the case of
the telephone line around the earth, the man
could Walk under the wire on stilts, if he wished,
for the difference in diameter of the two circles
would be about 32 feet, or the poles 16 feet high,

The daughter, while no chess player, was
quite a sharpie. When the first man opened
against her, she merely observed the move and
employed it against the second expert, and then
used the second’s countermove against the first.
In this manner the match was cleverly switched
to a battle between the experts, with the girl as
the go-between. So, unknown to anyone but her,
the daughter could either win one of the two
matches or draw both of them, either result being
better than the fate of her father.

ATOMIC REACTORS

Two engineers are required to put the reactor
into operation and bring it to the “full power”
stage. Only one engineer is needed to keep the
reactor in operation, while an additional engineer
conducts the test work.

Although the Atomic Energy Commission
authorized North American to build the water
boiler primarily for reactor research, associated
secondary studies in atomic energy technology
can also be performed with the aid of the reactor,
with applications to medicine, industry and aca-
demic research.

MOVIES IN THE DARK

A new infrared-sensitive motion picture film
which literally permits motion pictures to be made
in the dark with infrared illumination, or in the
semi-dark without, has been announced by the
Eastman Kodak Company.

The new film has been described as having
a total “red speed” greater than any other ma-
terial on the market. The company said that in
tests conducted at the University of Rochester,
successful motion pictures were made of audience
reactions when house lights in a theater were
dimmed to 1/70th of normal room illumination.

The new film can be used in any standard 16
or 35mm motion picture camera accepting roll
film or 16mm magazines. It will not, however,
be available in 35mm cassette loading for 35mm
still cameras. Lengths over 100 ft. will require

records automatically. Slip it off, and play records
at other speeds.

Permanent spindle and changer
play stacks of 33% or 78 rpm
records automatically.

 
  
   
   

  

A ﬂick of the ﬁnger and you
have the right needle to play
45, 331/3, or 78 rpm records.

   
 
 
   
     

W01'1d’s simplest 3-speed changer,
this versatile Victrola combines new
playing ease with the finest reproduc-
tion of sound. And it changes “45”
rpm records correctly, on the same
turntable used for other speeds.
Key to this advance is RCA Victor’s
slip-on “45” spindle, which fits over the
permanent spindle and locks in place.
No plugs or extra gadgets. Simply stack
your “45” records on this fine instrument,
an(l play up to fourteen of them—at the
twist of a knob. Then, whenever you
wish, remove the “45” spindle, flick the

needle and speed controls, and the same
Victrola changer will play records auto-
matically at 33‘/3 or 78 rpm.

More than a year of research and engi-
neering went into this changer—further evi-
dcnce of the leadership which assures you
ﬁner performance in any product or service
of RCA and RCA Victor.

METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING

On Wednesday, October 22, the Pitt Metal-
lurgical Alumni held a reunion luncheon at the
Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Philadelphia, The
alumni discussed new developments at the Nation-
al Metals Congress sponsored by the American
Society for Metals where exhibits were located in
Convention Hall. Approximately 100,000 people
working in the metal industries attended the
metal show to see new developments in metal cut-
ting, welding, drilling, fabrication, and materials
handling. Technical talks were held simultan-
eously on new jet alloys and armament metals
necessary for the defense effort. Some of the
Pitt Alumni present were Stephen Poch. ?39, the
plant metallurgist of Driver Harris Company, Mr.
Harry Iohnstin, ’26, Vanadium Alloy Steel Com-
pany of Latrobe, Mr. Howard Grim. ’23, Heppen-
stall Company, and Mr. Bill Rodgers, ’28, Repub-
lic Steel Company. Dr. I. Alfred Berger, head of
the Metallurgical Engineering Department here
at Pitt, was also present.
PETROLEUM ENGINEERING

Mr. William L. Homer, ’28, has recently been
appointed vice president of the Sunray Oil Com-
pany, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Following his gradua-
tion, Mr. Horner worked with the Forrest Oil
Company in Bradford. He then became co-found-
er and vice president of Core Laboratories, Inc.,
now a large petroleum consulting firm through-
out the West. He later became chief engineer of
the Barnsdall Oil Company and following the
merger of this company with Sunray became
chief petroleum engineer with the latter company.
As vice-president, he will be responsible for all
secondary recovery operations of the Sunray Com-
pany. In addition to his B. S. degree from the
University, Mr. Horner has received from the
University the two professional degrees of Pet-
roleum Engineer and Geological Engineer.

Known as Kodak Spectroscopic I-N Film, the
new film was orginally intended for use by spec-
trographic laboratories. It is now, however, be-
ing used for many other purposes such as audience
reaction and ultra high-speed camera photography
where its sensitivity to the infrared range of the
spectrum makes it particularly valuable for re-
cording—without supplemental il1umination—the
flow and action of molten or hot metals.

The new film will not be processed by the
Eastman Kodak Company, Recommended devel-
opment is 4 to 8 minutes in Kodak Developer D-
19. Development results in a photographic nega-
tive which must be printed on another piece of
film to produce a positive print for projection
purposes.

Easy way to get rich

UPPOSE, as you enter a grocery store, you
S suddenly ﬁnd the denomination of every bill
in your pocket has doubled! You’re rich! Until
you find that the same “magic” has doubled the
price of everything in the store.

That’s the sort of “prosperity”America has
been “enjoying.”

Most Americans feel they’re worth more today
than a few years ago; actually their savings have
been whittled away 23% in the 7 years since the

War. More money without more goods always bids
prices up and up to the sky.

If you like what's been happening to you, if
you think this is prosperity, let’s make a good job
of it; let’s make every bill a million dollar bill-
or a billion, as Germany did. If inﬂated money
makes everybody happy, let’s be hysterical!

But Germany didn’t find it much fun, the
morning after.

drive for airplane accessories as an integral part
of the engine. This revolutionary feature will per-
mit designers to make substantial savings in
weight and space in new planes, both vital factors
in maintaining aircraft superiority.

The new aircraft power plant has just suc-
cessfully completed the Defense Department’s
grueling 150-hour qualification test, which all
new engines must pass to be eligibe for quantity
production. The test was equivalent to more than
75,000 miles of actual flight, or three times
around the world at the equator.

Several new fighter planes, all of which are
scheduled for early production for the U. S. Navy,
are expected to be powered by the new engine.
These will include the McDonnell F3H “Demon”
and the Douglas F4D “Skyray.”

The new engine is an outgrowth of the origi-
nal Westinghouse J40 engine which, when an-
nounced last year, was the most powerful turbo-
jet in the world to qualify for production. The
new engine thus assumes the role of leadership
previously held by the earlier model.

The tremendous power of the new J40 is
partly developed through the use of an after-
burner which reheats the exhaust gases t after
they leave the turbine but before they emerge as
a jet stream.

The new engine, like all Westinghouse jets, is

* of the axial flow or straight-through design. Al-

most 25 feet long and about 40 inches in diameter,
it is exceptionally light and produces more thrust
per square inch of frontal area than any other
turbojet.

This single engine is two and one-half times
as powerful as the combined four engines on a
B-29 Superfortress but its weight, approximately
3,500 pounds, is less than that of only one of the

famous bomber’s engines and propellors. Still
more powerful versions of the J 40 are under de-
velopment.

Substantial amounts of two of the most criti-
cal metals—columbium and cobalt—have been
eliminated in the new J 40. Even greater savings
of these and other scarce materials will be effected
in newer versions of the engine.

Since a new low-cost fuel especially developed
for use in high-flying jets and designated as “JP-
4,” was used throughout the qualification test,
the new J 40 becomes the first Navy-sponsored
turbojet to qualify on the new fuel.

Scoring and cutting rule steel is a cold-rolled
specialty steel for use in preparing dies for cutting

paper, leather, rubber and other materials.

It is a pre-tempered product manufactured by
skilled workmen, using precision rolling and hard-
ening equipment, to close limits for chemistry,
grain size and hardness. This product must also be
capable of meeting intricate bend requirements in

the hardened and tempered condition.

This specialty is furnished with round edges and
in coil form to the rule manufacturer who grinds
the edges — the one edge square and the other to a
knife edge as well as cutting the material into de-
sired lengths. This is sold to a die-maker who bends
the rule to the required shape. This is then the
nucleus of a pre-hardened die, which when properly
brazed and supported is used to cut out material for
display cards — aircraft parts — pocketbooks —

wallets — gloves — gaskets — washers.

The T orrington Needle Bearing
...designed for easy, effective lubrication

The Torrington
Needle Bearing of-
fers many design
and operational ad-
: . vantages. High
rated radial load capacity is com-
bined with compact size and light
weight. Installation is simple and
fast. And one of the major advan-
tages inherent in the Needle Bear-
ing design is the ease with which it
can be lubricated.

The full complement of small di-
ameter rollers continuously carries
a thin ﬁlm of lubricant to all contact
surfaces. The turned-in lips of the
outer shell act as a retainer for lubri-

cant within the bearing and effec-
tively seal out foreign matter. Needle-
Bearings in many applications run
for long periods of time without fur-
ther attention to original lubrica-

tion.
Methods of
Relubrication

When Needle Bearings are shipped,
they are normally protected with a
high-grade slushing compound
which has lubricating value at ordi-
nary temperatures. This compound
is left in the bearings in most appli-
cations.

There are several methods of
providing additional lubricant to
Needle Bearings:

1. When lubricant is to be deliv-
ered through the housing, as in Fig-
ure 1, an oil hole is furnished in the
middle of the outer shell. Care
should be taken to place this hole
outside the load area.

2. If it is necessary to lubricate
through the shaft, a hole drilled
along the shaft axis with a cross hole
leading under the lip of the Needle
Bearing is satisfactory. (See Figure

. lip of the bearing rather than in the

roller contact area.

3. When speeds are low and loads
light, Needle Bearings may be
packed with grease, which often
lasts for the life of the unit. Such an
application is shown in Figure 3.

4. For high speeds and heavy
loads, a circulating oil system is pre-
ferred, as it aids in carrying away
heat as well as in providing a con-
tinuous supply of lubricant for the
rollers to carry to the bearing con-
tact surfaces. (See Figure 4.)

Selecting A Lubricant

While oil is the best lubricant, it is
difﬁcult in many cases to retain it in
the bearing housing. In such cases,

by the Needle Bearings in this valve rocker arm
of a large Diesel engine. Circulating oil lubrica-
tion assures a steady supply of lubricant.

grease offers the best means of lu-
brication. In general, a soda base
grease is used in the absence of mois-
ture and a lime base grease when
moisture is present. It is usually ad-
visable to consult with a grease
manufacturer before making a ﬁnal
decision for a particular application.

tion on the use of Torrington Needle

Chalmers. Perhaps a quick review of my
own experience will show why I feel that
way.

After graduating from Iowa State
in 1949

I started the Allis-Chalmers Graduate
Training Course on the Steam Turbine
erection ﬂoor. From there I went to the
switchgear and pump departments to
familiarize myself with other utility equip-
ment; and from there, to the Motor and
Generator section, which at the time was
my goal.

OCTOBER. 1952

. :-

Brain of a giant 107,000—kw steam turbo-generator is this complex

Regulex voltage control. Clark ﬁnds such control a fascinating problem.

Arrange Your Own Course

From this, you begin to see the freedom
21 GTC student has at Allis-Chalmers.
You not only have complete freedom in
arranging your course, but you can change
your course as you go along and your
interests develop. Best of all, you have a
wide choice, because Allis-Chalmers builds
such a wide line of products.

Even after getting to the Motor and
Generator section, which had been my
original goal, I had a chance to change my
mind. While I found a certain glamour to
the big motors and generators, I became
really intrigued by the electrical brains of
these giants, and decided to go to the
control section to learn more about them.
I have been working there ever since.

Today, I am in charge of pricing, apply-
ing and promoting the sale of three lines
of control devices: Rocking Contact volt-
age regulators; Rcgu/ex voltage regula-
tors; and liquid rheostats. Part of my
time is spent traveling . . . visiting cus-
tomers and helping district oflice salesmen.

The time spent in other departments
has paid off too. It not only helped me
ﬁnd the work I liked best, but I met people
in departments all over the plant that I
now work with in coordinating jobs for
utilities. Even time on the Steam Turbine
erection ﬂoor proved valuable, because it
helps me in talking shop to utility men.

Wide Choice at A-C

One reason you have such a wide choice
is the fact that Allis-Chalmers makes
equipment for every basic industry, in-
cluding electric power, cement, mining,
rock products, flour milling, and steel.
Just to give you an idea, here are some of
the products you might some day re-
design, build or sell: transformers, steam
condensers, pumps, motors, blowers, unit
substations, steam and hydraulic turbines
and generators, crushers, kilns, grinders,
coolers, rolling mills, Sifters, and. many
others.

That diversity can mean a lot to you in
helping you ﬁnd the job you want. It cer-
tainly helped me make my ﬁrst job count.

Advanced Production Techniques and
Experience—l50 Years of lt—Are Doing
Big Things with Pressure Vessels

Although established in 1802, Scaife Company never has
allowed itself to “grow old.” A unique combination of
engineering skill, production experience and modern
equipment—coupled with Scaife’s intensive research pro-
gram—has resulted in many signiﬁcant accomplishments
in the manufacture of pressure vessels for air, gases and
liquids. For example, one of the most interesting methods
of cold-forming metal in use in this country today is the
Scaife Reverse-Draw Process, a revolutionary method of
forming deep-drawn shapes.

We invite engineers to contact our Personnel Director
for information about the opportunities with the
Scaife Company.

INK FROM THE

The new editors hope that engineering stu-
dents will again be interested in Pitt’s only maga-
zine intended primarily for engineers. An even
greater interest can be acheived in a number of
ways.

First, a fair estimate shows that if all the
students in the engineering schools bought a mag-
azine, our circulation would be nearly doubled.
With this larger circulation the quality and size
of our magazine could be increased.

Second, it is known that many students can
and do write articles that are suitable for pub-
lication. If these students would bring these
articles to us, we could edit them and put them
in our magazines. A greater variety of articles
to choose from would increase our quality and
possibly mean more articles in each magazine.

Third, if we heard from our readers on the
impressions, good or bad, you get from reading
the magazine, it would aid us in selecting the
proper material for the magazine. We want to
emphasize that we welcome any criticism. Indeed,
a “Letters to the Editor” column could be used for
voicing gripes about anything in the school. Such
a column could be used to push worthy projects
such as Sigma Tau’s proposed engineering mem-
orial near State Hall, IRE’s project of a Radio

EDITOR'S

PEN

Club, and an engineer’s open house day when
every department would put on a display, such
as Julius Pe1ine’s ram jet and displays of high
voltage electricity. Our readers’ gripes, sugges-
tions, criticisms, or letters of approval or disap-
proval would be welcomed. One requirement to
get letters published: the writer should sign his
name.

Fourth, there are many jobs open on the
magazine. These jobs teach any special skill need-
ed. A great many of our readers might have time
and-energy to spend enjoying the experience. We
especially need typists, artists, and cartoonists,
but there are jobs on the production staff, busi-
ness staff, circulation staff, advertising staff, and
even a few positions on the editorial board, If
any reader would like to work on the magazine,
he should see one of the staff members or come up
to the office on the eighth floor of the Cathedral.

Since we are soliciting help from you readers,
it is only fair to state the policies we will try to
follow this semester. We shall try to stimulate
interest in research and original investigation,
to provide an outlet for articles by students and
faculty, to disseminate news of engineering activ-
ities to all departments, to create a closer con-
tact between alumni and undergraduates, and to
increase the prestige of our engineering school.
