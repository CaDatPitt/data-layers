MOON SHELTER3

BY JOHN A. CAMPBELL

SK YSORA PER ENGINEER

'\?‘

Manned exploration of the moon
is already taken for granted, years
before the actual fact. Much creative
and experimental engineering remains
to be done, however, before space-
suited astronauts can explore the sur-
face of the moon on foot. Of tremen-
dous importance to this mission is
the design of a shelter to provide the
astronauts with needed protection,
atmosphere, power, water, food, and
waste disposal.

A temporary base of operations will
be needed for a period of a few days
or Weeks while two astronauts carry
out a program of observation. On
initial ﬂights, the spacecraft itself
might serve as the base. Later, a
shelter speciﬁcally designed for the
lunar environment will probably be
required.

Successive stages in the assembly and deployment of a lunar
shelter are shown from right to left.

In all likelihood, the shelter will be
landed on the moon in pack form in
an unmanned space vehicle, and re-
main packed until the astronauts, on
a later ﬂight, assemble or errect it and
put it into operation. This two-stage
sequence permits effective use of
space and weight allowances on board
the manned vehicle.

Such a shelter could serve as tem-
porary housing during the construc-
tion of a permanent lunar base. It
might, of course, serve in an emer-
gency should there be a failure in
other life-support elements. Ideally,
the shelter should should lend itself to
interconnection with other shelters to
from a complex.

The word “shelter” is closely asso-
ciated with the phrase “protection
against the elements." Since the moon

has an environment that is ﬁercely
hostile to any form of life, that phase
takes on monumental overtones. In
the remainder of this article, we will
discuss some of the problems pre-
sented by the lunar environment as
they affect two fundamental decisions
in shelter design: selection of the
over-all configuration and selection of
the basic material of which the shelter
will be constructed. Enviornmental
factors, of course, are not the only
ones inﬂuencing these decisions, and
the ﬁnal solutions ,to the problem of
shelter design must take into con-
siedration the total system.

Environment

It should be pointed out that little
direct information is available on the
lunar environment; a great deal has

of a. feasibility study for NASA.

been deduced, but very little has been
measured. The moon is generally
believed to be almost completely
without atmosphere; the atmospheric
pressure on the lunar surface is esti-
ated at 104‘-’ to 10'“ torr (1 torr is a
pressure equal to 1 mm Hg). Lunar
gravity is approximately one-sixth
that of the earth, the acceleration on
the surface being 5.32 feet per second
per second. The lunar surface tem-
perature varies from about -l-250° F.
in the lunar day to about —250° F.
during the lunar night.

The lunar surface is subject to
bombardment from high-energy galac-

‘I2

 

tic and solar cosmic rays. Although
ultraviolet radiation represents only a
very small portion (less than one per
cent) of the total solar energy, the
lunar surface is exposed to this full
amount, an important consideration
for some materials.

Since the moon has no protective
atmosphere, its surface also is con-
tinually being bombarded by particles
of space debris. Some of these mete-
oroids are of cometary origin and are
quite light; others are of asteroidal
origin and have densities ranging
from three to eight grams per cubic
centimeter.

The moon’s long history of mete-
oroid bombardment makes it unlikely
that ﬁrm, hard rocks will be present

over any signiﬁcant portion of the K

lunar surface. The hypothesis that
the surface is covered with a deep

a"

dust layer has been largely dis- 

counted, although a shallow dust
layer several inches or more thick is
one of the probable features. Both
the lunar continents and maria (lunar

“seas”) are probably covered with d

rough, loose material, with many cra-
ters from primary and secondary
meteoroid impacts. Loose rocks as

:4

large as two to three feet in diameter ‘~

are likely to be present on the surface
of the maria; even larger rocks will be
found on the continents.

General Configuration

Owing to the great variation in sur-
face features, the shelter should be
suitable either for a hard, unyielding
surface or for a dust surface where
some penetration will occur. Because
of the vacuum condition of the moon,
the shelter can be considered a pres-
sure vessel; its most efficient shape
would be one that provides the maxi-
mum usable interior volume with the
maximum surface area. From the
point o-f View of the shelter’s inhabi
tants, a variation on the cylinder or
cone would be the most practical in
terms of usable space. Furthermore, a
cylinder or cone would have only line
Contact with the lunar surface, re-
quiring little site preparation.

Since the lunar shelter would be
transported to the moon in as small a
package as possible, it would be de-
ployed by the astronauts. From the
standpoint of compactness, it would
be desirable to have as few rigid mem-
bers as possible. This immediately
suggests the possibility of using an un-
supported, inﬂatable structure. Such
a shelter would have obvious ad-
vantages; it would, however, be
unable to support concentrated loads
without sagging. More important, it
would collapse in the event of a pres-
sure loss. For these reasons, the use
of rib bracing appears promising. Ribs
would enable the shelter to retain its
shape even in the face of a pressure
loss, and the ribs could be used to
support internal ﬁxtures.

SK YSCRA PER ENGINEER

(

G3

The most promising shape appears
to be that of a truncated cone, rib
supported, in which the air lock is
located at the small end of the cone.
The large end of the cone could be a
rigid dish against which the folded
shelter could be packed. Because of
the conical ﬁnal shape, the folds (per-
haps three in number) would nest
concentrically. The shelter would be
deployed by an automatic mechanical
system. A particularly advantageous
feature of this concept is that a num-
ber of shelters could be arranged in a
circle with their air locks facing in-
ward and interconnected by means of
a small compartment located in the
center of the circle.

Assembly

The shelter design must permit quick
and easy assembly without special
skills. During assembly, the astro-
nauts will have to depend on the
portable life-support systems they will
carry on their backs. This is one of
the few instances where the lunar en-
vironment will help the astronaut.
The force of gravity is one-sixth that
of the earth and, although this ﬁgure
should be used with caution because
of many complicating factors, the
astronaut will be able to lift or push

heavy shelter components without,

undue fatigue.

The space-suited astronaut has very
distinctive limitations as to move-
ment. These involve such matters as
wrist rotation, elbow bend, waist
bend, and knee bend. Even under the
most sirnpliﬁed type of shelter erec-
tion program, a complete understand-
ing of these limitations will be neces-
sary to avoid assigning the astronaut
a function that he will ﬁnd physically
impossible to perform.

Material Selection

Selection of the best material for the
surface of the shelter is subject to an
unusual number of considerations. In
common with all other elements of the
shelter, the material must lend itself
to compact storage and must not de-
teriorate with long storage. Since the
interior atmosphere will be oxygen
rich, the material must not deteriorate
or be ﬂammable under this condition.

In addition to retaining the internal
atmosphere, the shelter must also pro-

vide adequate thermal protection for
its inhabitants. Since the moon has
no atmosphere, the only way the
shelter can receive heat is by radia-
tion. If the shelter exterior is given
an efficient 1'eﬂec-ting surface, very
little of the sun’s heat will penetrate
into the interior. Lunar night con-
stitutes less of a problem, because
even with an outside temperature of
—250° F. the interior will have suffi-
cient heat (from the astronauts’
bodies, equipment, etc.) to require
cooling.

Radiation

Insofar as possible, the shelter should
protect the astronauts against cosmic
rays, whether of galactic or solar
origin. Galactic cosmic radiation is
low in ﬂux and hence presents no
hazard. Solar cosmic radiation par-
ticularly at times of solar ﬂares, can
be extremely intense and constitutes
an important threat to the safety of
astronauts on the moon. The particles
ejected from the sun during a solar
ﬂare are known to be primarily pro-
tons, with energies ranging from less
than 10 Mev (million electron volts)
to several Bev (billion electron volts) .
These particles reach intensities many
thousands of times greater than galac-
tic cosmetic ray intensity. Some 30
times in the past six years, large
ﬂuxes of energetic particles at or
above the top of the earth’s atmos-
phere have been detected; it has been
possible to correlate the occurrence
of these proton ﬂuxes with solar ﬂares.
Since there is a time lag between the
optical event and the arrival of the
radiation associated with it, astro-
nauts on the moon could take pre-
cautions. One possibility is a specially
protected area that could be formed
inside the shelter, acting as a radiation
“storm cellar.”

An estimate of the radiation dose
received by a crewman has been made
by utilizing a hypothetical hemis-
pherical carbon shield whose weight
is equivalent to the weight of the
lunar shelter and its internal equip-
ment. If this weight is assumed to
be 1000 pounds and the internal
radius of the hypothetical shield to
be 3 feet, the shield will absorb all
protons with energies less than 100
l\Iev.

It is evident from calculations that
sufficient mass exists in the type of
shelter envisioned to provide ade-
quate protection against normal
radiation against the more intense
radiation present during a solar ﬂare.
If the protons have a path that is
strongly directional, a more efficient
shield could be designed.

The energy spectrum used to make
the calculations applies to the imme-
diate Vicinity of the earth. To what
extent this spectrum is valid for the
vicinity of the moon is not known.

Mefearoid Hazard

Most particles of space debris bom-
barding the moon are minute. Larger
particles of debris, with masses of a
kilogram or more, are so infrequent
in space that forall practical pur-
poses they can be ignored. Most
meteoroids are probably of cometary
origin and low in density (0.5 grams
per cubic centimeter). About 10 per
cent of the meteoroids are of aster-
oidal origin with a density of about
3.5 grams per cubic centimeter.

When meteoroids strike the moon,
a spray of lunar material is ejected
from the surface. The quantity of the
ejected particles is estimated to be
three to ﬁve orders of magnitude
greater than that of the incoming
particles. One should therefore con-
sider both primary and secondary
impacts.

Although the continual bombard-
ment of meteoriod particles can have
a variety of damaging effects on the
shelter, penetration is the only one of
importance in considering shelter
occupancy for a short mission. Pene-
tration would be by high-speed parti-
cles from the primary meteoriod ﬂux
and low-speed particles of secondary
lunar ejecta. Considerable recent
work has been done in the ﬁeld of
hypervelocity impact. Unfortunately,
the maximum experimental velocity
that can be attained presently is
about 8 kilometers per second, whereas
meteoroid velocities may be as high as
72 kilometers per second. In addition,
most of the data have been obtained
with metallic target materials, rather
than with the type of material which
would probably be selected for shelter
construction.

‘I3

The tiny glass ball at the end of the pencil point simulates a meteoroid in hyper-
velocity impact tests. The plastic carrier which holds the ball is called a sabot,
and seals the barrel of the hypervelocity gun during launching. The ball separates
from the sabot during launching, so that measurements can be made on the effects

of the impact of the ball alone.

Based on hypervelocity studies and
structural considerations, the most
promising wall material appears to be
a low-density silicone foam or a glass
wool, two inches thick, contained
between thin inner and outer ﬁber-
glass fabric walls. From the data col-
lected, it seems that penetration
efficiency measured on a penetrated
weight basis generally improves as
filler density decreases. The primary
function of the outer wall is to frag-
ment the impacting particles into
many sub-particles and to disperse
them over as large an angle as pos-
sible in order to reduce the energy
concentration. Since the ﬁller mate-
rial will have the effect of slowing
down particles, low-velocity penetra-
tion resistance will be the most im-
portant property of the inner skin.

Much of the data was developed
using glass sphere, 1/16" in diameter,

‘I4

traveling at a nominal velocity of
23,000 fps. The density of the glass is
2.8 grams per cubic centimeter.
Although a wall can be designed
with a very low probability of pene-
tration, damage should be detectable
and repairable if penetration does
occur. Repairs should not be difficult
to make: one problem, however,
might be locating a small hole. For
this reason, an automatic zone type
alarm system is desirable to signal
penetration of the inner wall.

Effect on Materials

The lunar environment has a deﬁnite
and important effect on certain mate-
rials. Vacuum exposure can cause
sublimation of plastic materials, or
vaporization of the plasticizer in the
material. Solar ultra-violet radiation
has signiﬁcant effects on polymeyers
and other synthetics. The combina-

tion of ultra-violet radiation with in-
termittent stress can be particularly
harmful since any thin, brittle layer
that would be formed through ultra-
violet radiation effects would likely
fail under intermittent loading. Most
of the damage to plastics would come
as a result of ionization initiated by
the ultra-voilet radiation.

The most important consideration
for metallic materials will be varia-
tions in temperature. Since a varia-
tion of 500° is possible, the differen-
tial expansion of dissimilar materials
will be important.

Metals slowlysublime in a vacuum.
For a fairly short mission, the process
would proceed so slowly as to make
no difference, but cadmium, zinc, and
pure magnesium should be avoided
since they have relatively high sub-
limation rates in a vacuum.

Flammability

In the shelter design, the ﬂammability
of materials is a very important con-
sideration, since any ﬁre in a conﬁned
space is extremely hazardous. Selec-
tion of materials should be limited to
those which are either non-combusti-
ble, self-extinguishing or slow-burning,
and which do not produce noxious or
toxic gases when undergoing thermal
decomposition. Metals normally con-
sidered incombustible, except in ﬁnely
divided form, may react violently
when in contact with high-pressure
oxygen. Titanium and magnesium are
among the most active and should be
avoided.

 

As with many other areas of space ex-
ploration, moon shelter design pre-
sents a vast array of special problems.
One of. the most intriguing, from the
designer’s point of view: is the need
to provide protection against environ-
mental conditions that may not be
fully understood until the astronauts
who use the shelter have had an op-
portunity to collect deﬁnitive data.
In spite of problem areas and un-
known quantities, however, a com-
plete lunar shelter system can be
developed and fabricated using mate-
riaIs,‘components, and techniques that
are currently at hand or that can be
expected. to .be available within the
next few years.

“we explore freely . . .

and no restrictions are set upon
our imagination."

The speaker was a brilliant young Navy
scientist discussing his work, and he might
well have been referring to the Naval Ordance
Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland, where
technological explorations are pursued to the
ultimate advantage of the nation’s posture
of defense.

Who would have thought, especially before
the advent of POLARIS, that a submarine
could someday ﬁre what appears to be an
ordinary torpedo which would, a few seconds
later, take off upwards into a ballistics tra-
jectory . . . drop its rocket motor somewhere
down-range . . . re-enter the water intact at
supersonic speed . . . automatically arm itself
. . . and let loose a nuclear blast that will
decimate any numberof submerged hostiles?

Today, SUBROC promises to be the deadliest
anti-submarine warfare weapon ever devised,
but when it was ﬁrst dreamed up by NOL
scientists back in 1957 it presented the
thorniest set of problems yet to face the still-
young missile age. That SUBROC itself,
together with its sonar detection system and

special digital computer ﬁre control system,
are almost ready for ﬂeet use is a real tribute
to NOL’s creativity, technical direction, and
test & evaluation capabilities.

But SUBROC—although an undertaking of
incredible proportions—is just one in a long
series of NOL projects in anti-submarine
warfare, air and surface weaponry, aerobal-
listics, chemistry, explosives," and materials
research. Many such dreams have become
reality at NOL—seven new magnetic ma-
terials that have sharply upgraded magnetic
ampliﬁers, magnetometers, and electromag-
netic transducers . . . new ways to measure
drag, stability, and heating effects of missiles
traveling in excess of Mach 10 . . . the arming
and fuzing devices for POLARIS . . . a new
data reduction method for underwater
acoustics that opens the door to passive sonar
ranging . . . two new nuclear depth bombs . . .
and literally hundreds more.

There are more than 1,000 graduate profes-
sionals at NOL-White Oak today, but the
Laboratory is always interested in talented
explorers—especially those delving into aero
and electro technologies. And, to help you
explore more. freely (and productively), NOL
offers:

0 assignments of national importance

o the ﬁnest equipment and facilities to be had

(900 acres of them)
0 several programs for advance degrees in

cooperation with Washington-area uni-
versities. The University of Maryland even
holds some courses on NOL premises
which you may attend during working
hours. (NOL has always been fertile ground
for PhD theses.)

0 the stimulus of working with top people in
their specialties, many of whom are staff
members and lecturers at colleges and uni-
versities.

0 the added stimulus offered by the Wash-
ington environment, now one of the top
four R & D centers—private as well as
government—in the country.

The same young Navy scientist we quoted

earlier also remarked: “. . . (fa scientist wants

the freedom to satisfy his intellectual hunger
and open doors now closed to him, his best bet
is to work for the Government.”

Twelve years ago Dr. C. W. Char-
dach of Buffalo, New York and Mr.
Wilson Greatbatch, an electrical en-
gineer, also from Buffalo developed
an “energy pulse generator” which
forces an erratic human heart to
behave properly. This generator,
which provides a stimulus that re-
places a natural nerve signal that has
failed, causes the heart muscles to
contract in a normal fashion and at a
stabilized rate thereby providing the
necessary blood pumping action.
Originally, this generator, which is em-
planted inside the body had an exter-
anl power supply. However, infection
through the electrode entrance and
the difficulty of taking a bath and
exercising made .an outside source
undesirable. Also, the superfluous ap-
pearance of this apparatus made
many patients feel abnormal. Finally,
General Electric built an implantable
power supply which consists of 5 mer-

 

Although these hat-
are of high standards and
reliability and premature battery run-
down is rare, there is still an element
of doubt and hesitance about their
performance. This possible unreliabil-
ity of the mercury batteries led en-
gineers and doctors to seek the body’s
own electricity as a possible power
supply.

It is a well-known fact that elec-
tricity is generated in living orga-
nisms. One can demonstrate this by
placing electrodes at different sites on
an animal body and observing the
difference in potential. It is also
known that one part of the body may
have a higher or lower potential than
another. These “Bioelectric Poten-
tials” have been used primarily for
diagnostic purposes such as in elec-
trocardiograms and electroencephalo-
gram devices which amplify and
record potential variations. However,

tion and the invention of implanted

electronic devices such as the “energy
pulse generator” discussed previously,
suggests that B. E. P.* can be used
as a valuable source of electrical
power.

Nevertheless, problems arise when
one attempts to transmit this electric-
ity through animal tissue. Human tis-
sue behaves like a complex electrical
circuit which can either aid or impede
electrical conductance. For example,
an exposed nerve can be stimulated
by a fraction of a volt, but it takes
approximately 100 volts or more when
the nerve is embeded within human
tissue. A diagnosis of tissue shows
that it has characteristics of capaci-
tance and resistance (medical scien-
tists tend to disregard any inductance
characteristics). For instance,  I
shows an electric pulse generator con-
nected to a person’s skin. This pulse
is transmitted through the body's tis-
sue by electrol_vtes (ions) to give
stimulus to a nerve. A very elemen-

Scientists are listening to sounds from the stars

Almost all we know about deep space we
learned by studying light . . . the faint,

suddenly, a whole new universe is opening
up to us through sound from the stars. it
comes via a satellite in which the British

a share.

This sound comes from millions of stars
which we never knew before, because they
emit no light. We couldn't hear them,
either, because the earth’s atmosphere
shut off these noises, but now we can.

The satellite, Ariel II, also tells us how the

cated analysis reveals the appearance
of capacitance in tissue. Fig. 3 shows
the assumed equivalent circuit for a
single celled substance such as Fliesh-
man’s.yeast. Because a piece of tissue
has many cells, this tissue can be
thought of as having many very small
capacitors and resistances. The capac-
ity is brought about by the cells’
ability to store a charge.

Changes in R and C values take
place as the tissue changes metabol-
ically or as it responds to stimuli such
as heat or pain. Because capacitors
tend to alter the amount of time a
certain intensity of current will last
Whe nthe current is pulsating, such as
is found in a pulse generator, it is
‘important that tissue capacitance re-
main predictable so that scientists can
establish the minimum duration of
useful stimulating current. These and
other important problems must be
dealt with when using B. E. P. How-
ever, the most pertinent question
which arises is: what is the source of
this “bioelectrical potential?”

Even since 1935, scientists have

' known that the interior of a cell con-

18

tains proteins, potassium, sodium and
chloride ions and many other ions.
Moreover it seems that, contrary to
most of nature, the cell has an
unbalance of electrical charge. To
explain this charge unbalance, scien-
tists observed the K+ ion concentra-
tion in cells. It appears that the
inside of the cell has a K+ concentra-
tion which is about 20 times greater
than the concentration in the material
outside the cell. Na+ concentration
is also greater inside the cell. Every-
one knows that a temperature differ-

ence will cause heat to flow from the
point of high temperature to the point
of low temperature. Similarly a con-
centration difference will ca11se matter
to flow from a point of high concen-
tration to a point of low concentra-
tion. Thus, because of this difference
of concentration the ions difl"use out
of the cell. Because K+ are smaller
and more mobile than the other ions,
they are the ions which diffuse the
fastest. However, their rate is very
slow. The slow difl"usion rate is caused
by the tough, nonporous membrane
surrounding the cell. Although this
diffusion is very slow, it nevertheless,
causes an overall negative charge in-
side the cell and an induced positive
charge surrounding the outside of the
cell. Eventually the cell and its im-
mediate surroundings attain electrical
equilibrium and the potential becomes
constant. However, there are certain
enzymes which tend to reduce this
potential when they come into con-
tact with the cell. This somehow
reduces the toughness of the mem-
brane and allows Na+ to diffuse into
the cell thereby reducing the negative
potential. This reduction in potential
further reduces the toughness of the
membrane and allows more Na+ to
come in and eventually the membrane
completely breaks down.

This breakdown is followed by a
reversal of potential because too much
Na+ enters the cell and causes the
overall charge to become positive.
This positively charged cell now
affects cell in the same manner as the
enzyme and starts a chain reaction.
In the process of activating its neigh-
bor, the cell recovers and returns to

its normal potential. Moreover, this
process which the cell goes through
agitates ion concentration gradients
around the cell and therefore, distrubs
the electrical equilibrim. As a result
of this agitation, the cell membrane
breaks down again. This breakdown
and recovery continues over and over
again for a relatively long period of
time causing the tissue to become
“active tissue.” When an electrode
comes into contact with “active tis-
sue” and another electrode contacts
an inactive area, a potential drop re-
sults. This potential drop is the so
called “bioelectric potential.

Now that the source of B. E. P. has
been revealed, another question arises:
How much power can B.E.P. supply?
To answer this scientists at “General
Electric Space Sciences Laboratory”
measured B. E. P. in white mice. They
found that a constant power output
of 90 watts at a current of 300 amps
could be obtained from a 200 gram
white rat. Moreover, a small 500 kc
sine wave oscillator was operated by
the B. E. P. of this rat. Thus, it is
possible to utilize the B. E. P. of

for determining structural design of Asphalt
pavements for roads and streets

Today, as more and more states turn to modern Deep-
Strength* Asphalt pavement for their heavy-duty highways,
county and local roads, there is a growing demand for engi-
neers with a solid background in the fundamentals of Asphalt

technology and construction.

Help to prepare yourself now for this challenging future by
getting the latest information on the new Thickness Design
Method developed by The Asphalt Institute. Based on exten-
sive statistical evaluations performed on the IBM 1620 and
the mammoth IBM 7090 computers, accurate procedures for
determining road and street structural requirements have

been developed.

All the facts on this new method are contained in The As-
phalt Institute’s Thickness Design manual (MS-1). This help-
fulmanual and much other valuable information are included
in the free student library on Asphalt construction and tech-
nology now offered by The Asphalt Institute. Write us today.

small animals to operate electronic
apparatus such as those used in tele-
metering devices as well as utilizing it
to operate implanted electronic
devices.

Although the use of B. E. P. must
revolutionize many aspects of design
and operation of electronic devices
implanted in the human body, it has
been proposed that use of it will elimi-
nate the need for batteries; the
implant will be very small and light-

weight; the dependability and reali-
bility will be unprecidentably excel-
lant and a number of different devices
may be implanted in a single person
without undue traumatic effects.

Thus, it is seen that bioelectric
potential is a convenient source of
electricity for small power require-
ments, and an important tool in
developing a better understanding
between engineering, medicine and
basic biological research.

He found it at Western Electric

T. R. Thomsen, B.S.M.E., University of Nebraska, '58,
came to Western Electric for several reasons. Impor-
tant to him was the fact that our young engineers play
vital roles right from the start, working on exciting
engineering projects in communications including:
electronic switching, thin film circuitry, microwave
systems and optical masers.

The wide variety of Western Electric’s challenging
assignments appealed to Tom, as did the idea of ad-
vanced study through full-time graduate engineering
training, numerous management courses and a com-
pany—paid Tuition Refund Plan.

Tom knows, too, that we'll need several thousand
experienced engineers for supervisory positions within
the next few years. And he's getting the solid experi-

ence needed to qualify. Right now, Tom is developing
new and improved inspection and process control
techniques to reduce manufacturing costs of tele-
phone switching equipment. Tom is sure that Western
Electric is the right place for him. What about you?

if you set the highest standards for yourself, enjoy
a challenge, and have the qualifications we're looking
for—we want to talk to you! Opportunities for fast-
moving careers exist now for electrical, mechanical

CABINET MINUTES

President Yingling started out the first meeting of
Cabinet by making several suggestions to increase school
enthusiasm. He suggests that Cabinet sponsor a writing
contest for engineers and a fall social such as a picnic.

He also suggested that the election of the executive
committee of the Cabinet be left to the student body
instead of the Cabinet electing its own officers.

Cabinet has also been working on a way to improve
the lounge. The plant director, Jim Gallager is trying to
ﬁnd some new furniture for it. It has even been suggested
that some of the members get together and give the lounge
a good scrubbing to show how it should look and smell
when it’s really clean.

Cabinet is already investigating ways to improve the
Shamrock Ball. Last year’s ball was a great success, the
only complaint was that the Penn Sheridan wasn’t large
enough. The Social Committee is trying to reserve the
ballroom at the Hilton for this year’s ball.

It has also been suggested that a Xerox copying
machine be installed in the C & M Library. This machine
will reproduce any number of copies instead of just one
copy as the other machines in the University do.

CONGRATULATIONS

On Saturday, September 26, the
School of Engineering and l\/Iines held
its first and last picnic. Students
registered in engineering number over
1200. Those attending the picnic num-
bered under 50. Why? Why? The
gathering was well publicized in the
Pitt News, in the E & ll! Bulletz'n.,.
through numerous posters, and at
every seminar. All knew there was no
admission price and that refreshments
were free. It was too early in the
trimester for tests. Although familiar
Schenley Park is but two short blocks
from the campus, maps with clear
directions were distributed. All the
preparations were in vain.

Saturday dawned fair and warm. a
perfect day for the picnic. Only there
were so disappointingly few picnicers.
For three hours a rock and roll band
played in a near empty shelter. Bats,
Softballs, footballs, soccerballs, and
badminton sets borrowed from the
athletic departmen_t lay untouched
under a bench. The engineers who
attended thoroughly enjoyed them-

FMINDER
OF THE
STEEL AGE

Once or twice in a century a man emerges who is a
powerhouse of inventive energy. He touches noth-
ing which he does not improve in ways never before
envisaged. His mind may be so fertile in ideas that
society cannot keep pace. At his best he will be so far
ahead of» his day that he will be frustrated by neglect
and opposition. His greatness will show in two ac-
complishments, the quality of his inventions and his
ability to mold opinion to accept them.

Such a man was Henry Bessemer. His fame as one
of the pioneers of the modern steel industry has
tended to obscure the fact that his was one of the
most versatile, inventive brains that England or any
other country has produced. He lacked the distant
vision and the potent imagination of Leonardo da
Vinci, but worked in a less poetic and more practical
dimension. Mankind required centuries to catch up
with Leonardo’s visions. They caught up with Bes-
semer’s during his long and fruitful lifetime. He was
a lesser genius, but a more seminal innovator.

Inventive Son of an Inventor

Bessemer’s contribution to steel production was part
of a remarkable ﬂowering of original thought in iron
and steel technology in the middle decades of the
nineteenth century. This was a period of great inno-
vation, a kind of “golden age” of industrial develop-
ment in which men of inventive genius ﬂourished.
Their backgrounds and training were different, but
they were alike in this: all were men of broad vision
and unfettered imagination. The Siemens brothers

were engineers; Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, who com—.

leted what Bessemer had be un, was ad olice clerk
P _ 8 P
and self-taught chemist; Bessemer had an elementary
education and an early acquaintance with non-fer-

rous metals through surreptitious delving into the

secrets of his father’s workshop. V

The elder Bessemer was a talented inventor and
metalworker; successively inventor of a_ machine for
engraving dies of any size from a larger model; manu-
facturer of lightweight gold chains; producer of let-

Sir Henry Bessemer, the man whose inventive genius first gave
the world economical and reliable steel in quantity.

ter punches for the famous type founder Henry Cas-
lon; and, ﬁnally, discoverer of an improved alloy for
making printing types, which he applied in his own
type foundry at Charlton, near Hitchin, where his
son was born on January 19, 1813. When Henry was
seventeen years old, the family moved to London.
Almost immediately the youth launched out on a
career as a professional inventor. Using what he had
learned in his father’s business about casting metals,
he devised a method of casting leaves and other nat-
ural objects in white metal, and later of copper plat-
ing them by a process which was a practical appli-
cation of electroplating. Next, he rediscovered the
ancient lost wax process of metal casting, jealously
guarded by its practitioners on the Continent. This
was followed by a method of stamping reliefs on
cards and leather. He was a good draftsman and his
embossed products sold well.

While experimenting with dies, he hit upon a
method of producing thousands of facsimile impres-
sions of embossed stamps, and was appalled by the
criminal advantages it might present to unscrupulous
hands. He had heard that the Government had been
losing £100,000 a year by the fraudulent transfer of
Inland Revenue stamps from one document to an-
other, and offered his invention, to the department
concerned. It was accepted and Bessemer was prom-
ised the job of Superintendent of Stamps. But a fer-
tile mind controlled by a character of great integrity
proved incompatible with self—interest. He discov-
ered a better method, a simple system of perforating

 

and therefore canceling stamps with the date, which
could be operated by the existing staff. Though it
would rob him of a job, on the strength of which he
had hoped to marry and buy a house, he felt in honor
bound not to withhold it. The Government adopted
the idea and not only defaulted on its promise of a
job, but failed to pay even a penny as reward.

Fascinated by the New

This was the inventor’s ﬁrst experience of oﬂicial in-
gratitude. Others were to follow. The injustice ran-
kled for half a century, till he was already famous as
the inventor of the Bessemer process and owner of
a prosperous steel works. When the British Ambas-
sadoriin Paris had for the second time refused him
permission to accept the Grand Cross of the Legion
of Honor, awarded by the Emperor, he took up this
and earlier grievances in a personal letter to the Prime
Minister, Lord Beaconsﬁeld, and a letter for the pub-
lic’s information in The Times. Amends, though
much belated, were immediate and generous. He re-
ceived the additional honor of a knighthood in recog-
nition of all his services to the nation.

Bessemer would have made an indifferent public
servant. His mind was too restless, his curiosity irre-
sistible. In his autobiography he says, “I but too read-
ily allowed my attention to be directed to new sub-
jects, which always exercised a sort of fascination
over me; this tendency I found diﬂicult to control,
but invariably made myself believe that as soon as I
could strike a good vein, I should work it to full ca-
pacity, and never again be tempted to turn aside
after mere novelties.” There was much truth in this
self—appraisal. The vein was still to be located, but
most of the intervening enterprises pointed the way.

Merely to list his inventions would take a large part
of a page. In the ﬁfty most active years of his life he
took out patents at a rate of more than two a year.
He invented a machine for cutting graphite into thin
strips for making pencils, and when the manufac-
turers refused to release the raw material, he found
a way of compressing graphite waste into pencil
leads. He designed a typecasting machine and sold it
to a firm of type founders, but it was killed by trade
jealousy. He received a private commission, at a con-
sultation fee of a guinea a day, to design a keyboard
machine for setting type. It was so simple that a girl
could operate it at a speed of 5,000 types an hour. It
was used successfully, but the threat to male employ-
ment was obvious and the machine was suppressed.

His inventions were not ﬂashes of intuition, but the
result of keen observation and intensive study; For
instance, in seeking a method of embossing patterns
on Utrecht velvet, a peculiarly resistant material, he

To combat seasickness, Bessemer experimented with a steamer

studied the nature of hair and wool. When commis-
sioned by a sugar planter to produce an improved
process of sugar extraction, he imported some cane
from the West Indies, noticed in a series of experi-
ments that the resilience of the cane caused a propor-
tion of the juice to be sucked back after pressing, and
produced a simple expedient for preventing the loss.

All these patents brought him fees, but one unpat-
ented invention developed into a business, and though
unrelated to steel, proved decisive for the steel indus-
try, because the proﬁts from it ﬁnanced the experi-
ments with the Bessemer converter. This was the re-
discovery after long and laborious experiment of the
method, known for 2,000 years in the Far East, of
making bronze powder. The secret had been so
closely guarded that, as Bessemer said, “There were
not even the details of former failures to hold up the
ﬁnger of warning.” He designed entirely new pro-
duction machines and had them built in separate sec-

matter how badly the ship rolled in stormy seas.

tions by engineering ﬁrms in different parts of the
country so as to preserve secrecy. In partnership with
his brothers—in-law he was able to manufacture and
market bronze powder at a price that no foreign pro-
ducers could approach. Years later, when his steel
business was ﬁrmly established, Bessemer generously
presented his bronze powder interests to his senior
family partner in recognition of his hard work and
loyalty.

Believing that an invention could not be patented

without making the details public and so inviting
theft, Bessemer had decided to protect his process
with secrecy. There was an amusing sidelight on this
policy. A German manufacturer tried to bribe one
of the ﬁrm’s employees to procure him the secret.
Bessemer, under an assumed name, made an appoint-
ment with the spy at an accommodation address, and
solemnly presented him with a completely ﬁctitious
and unworkable process.

Out of the proceeds of worldwide sales of bronze
powder and its derivative gold paint, Bessemer
bought himself. a handsome house in London and
equipped a‘ laboratory for metallurgical experiments.
He conducted a series of experiments on gun barrels
and projectiles. He discovered a method of giving
rotation to a heavyielongated projectile of his own
design shotfrom a smooth-bore gun, then produced
a formula for a gun metal strong enough to withstand
the strain. For years he tried to persuade the War

He was deﬂected from this project by a chance
effect, produced during one of  experiments,
which he recognized at once as foreshadowing the
crowning achievement of his work and the dominant
preoccupation of the remainder of his working life.

31

Son of an inventor and metalworleer who produced letter
punches for the celebrated type founder Henry Caslon, Bessemer
was naturally intrigued with the problem of typesetting. He de-
signed a typecasting machine controlled by a keyboard.

32

While melting pig iron in a reverberatory furnace,
he noticed that some pieces had remained unmelted
despite the great heat. They proved on examination
to be thin shells of decarbonized iron, the carbon
and silicon having been burned out by the air blast.
Apparently air alone, without the use of any other
fuel or need for skilled manipulation, could be made
to combine with the carbon in crude iron to produce
very high temperatures and yield a completely de-
carbonized metal. Bessemer conﬁrmed the result in
a larger laboratory test and then mounted a full—scale
trial in his laboratory yard, melting half a ton of iron
in an ironfounder’s ordinary cupola and tipping it
into a converter of his own design ﬁtted with six
tuyeres to admit the air blast.

The result was dramatic. The oxygen in the blast,
uniting with the carbon in the molten steel, caused
a series of explosions which turned the converter into
a volcano of ﬂame and molten metal to the great dan-
ger of adjacent buildings. When the eruption had
subsided, and the metal was tapped into a ladle and
formed into an ingot, it was foundto be substantially
pure iron, having excellent ductility.

“It is impossible for me to convey,” said Bessemer,
“any adequate idea of what were my feelings when
I saw this incandescent mass rise slowly from the
mold, the ﬁrstlarge prism of cast malleable iron that
the eye of man had ever rested on.”

Having puriﬁed the iron, he could now put back

carbon in controlled quantities to make various qual-
ities of mild steel. Up to that time it had been impos-
sible to produce steel cheaply enough, or of the qual-
ity and in the quantities necessary, for use as a con-
structional material. The only steel was crucible
steel, used for tools, cutlery, watch springs and simi-
lar small objects. Henry Bessemer made possible the
mass production of steel for rails, locomotives, boil-
ers, ships’ "plates and other modern applications. His
famous address to the British Association in 185 6, On
the Manufacture of Malleable Iron and Steel IVth-
out Fuel, marked the ‘end of an epoch. It also marked
the beginning of a new, and for a time turbulent,
epoch for the great pioneer.

Applications for licenses to operate the Bessemer
process poured in from ironfounders with more zeal
than competence. There were many failures, through
misunderstanding of the techniques or the use of un-
suitable material. Bessemer set out to improve his
converter and other equipment and produce results
that would convince the skeptics. Even his friends
thought he had failed and urged him to abandon the
struggle. His answer was to open his own steel works
in 185 9 and offer steel at £10 to £15 a ton less than
current prices. The only reason that his works es-
caped the traditional form of sabotage (a bottle of
gunpowder in the furnace ﬂues) was that none of his
competitors believed the business would survive.

Gradually, sales and proﬁts built up. There were

dishonest attempts to discredit him by exhibiting, as
Bessemer’s, certain steel products that had been
botched by bad workmanship. VV1ldcat speculators
ﬁled spurious patents in the hope of being bought out.
One challenge was more serious. It came from Rob-
ert Forester Mushet, a distinguished steel pioneer,
who tried to patent a reﬁnement of a process which
Bessemer had earlier patented. Mushet, however, did
not take enough care inediting his patent, as George
Delbart pointed out in a lecture on Bessemer before
The Iron and Steel Institute in Paris in 195 6, and it
was rejected. Nevertheless Bessemer, of his own free
will, later granted Mushet, fallen upon hard times, a
substantial pension for the last thirty years of his life.
The ﬁrst Bessemer steel rail was laid at Crewe in
1861. At the International Exhibition of 1862 in Lon-
don, Henry Bessemer’s exhibit included specimens
of his steel deliberately and drastically bent and
twisted to demonstrate their ductility. VVithin a few
years, Bessemer steel had spread over the railway net-
works of Europe and America. The process had been
adopted by every steelmaking country and was pro-
viding the raw material for dozens of industries.
Bessemer’s triumph was complete. He received the
Albert Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in
1872. He had helped to found the Iron and Steel In-
stitute in 1868 and was its president from 1871-73.
He endowed the Bessemer Gold Medal for the Insti-
tute and—a happy termination to the most bitter con-

troversy of his life—approved its award to Robert
Mushet in 1876.

Sir Henry Bessemer’s brain did not lie fallow in
retirement from business. He constructed an observa-
tory and a telescope on the grounds of his house,
planned a solar furnace, and experimented with a sus-
pended ship saloon which would remain horizontal
in all conditions and save passengers from seasickness.
Of more practical value, he devised improved meth-
ods of diamond cutting and polishing. He died in
1898, having almost spanned the century.

The Bessemer process was one contribution among
many to the nineteenth century revolution in steel. Its
progress was accelerated by Sidney Gilchrist
Thomas’ discovery in the late 1870’s of a method of
removing phosphorus from the metal in the Bessemer
converter, thus making it possible for good steel to
be made out of low-grade ore. Sir William Siemens,
in 1865, developed a regenerative method of steel-
making, which used the hot gases from the ‘furnace to
heat the incoming air. The higher temperatures thus
generated enabled scrap steel to be used in the fur-
nace, and gave rise to the modern open—hearth proc-
ess which has largely superseded the Bessemer sys-
tem. Another outgrowth is the comparatively recent
basic oxygen process. But it was Bessemer’s genius
which ﬁrst gave the world economical and reliable
steel in quantity. To him, above all others, belongs the
title, Founder of the Steel Age.

The man who said

"you can’t take it with you”

was born a long time before Garrett

started making life support systems.

   

A s a matter

of fact,

unless man does take his earthly
environment with him into space,
he hasn’t got a chance.

For here’ is a world that has no
oxygen, no pressure, no gravity.

To live and work for weeks and
months in orbital ﬂight—a need
dictated by urgent space
projects now in progress —
man must have the most
sophisticated life support
system ever built.

It has to provide him
with oxygen, water,
pressurization — complete
climate control. I

Ithas toguard him 
against temperatures that
range from near absolute T
zero to the re-entry heat of
thousands of degrees.

It has to be a miracle package.

The question becomes: Who is
now building such an environ-
mental system?

The answer is, of course, Garrett.

 

 

As long ago as 1941, Garrett
management saw that man could
go no higher, no faster, without
pressurization of aircraft. When
Garrett’s AiResearch division
delivered the first systems,
suddenly the ceiling was
off the world.

Today over 90% of the
free world’s aircraft carry
Garrett environmental
systems. Millions of hours
of operation have been
accumulated by heat trans-
fer equipment, turbomachinery,
controls.

This experience led Garrett to
build the life support systems
that protected our astronauts on
the recent Mercury ﬂights.

   
 
  
  
  

  
 
 
  
  

The same know-how is now at
work supplying “shirtsleeve” envi-
ronments for Gemini and Apollo.
These systems will keep man alive

for weeks in space. Now

longer flights
are being
planned-
manned
orbiting

laboratories and space stations.
Garrett already knows how to solve
life support problems for months
in space. Much of the system work
is completed and components built.

What are the reasons for this

unique capability?

The most-experienced men
are Garrett men. The most
advanced facilities are

Garrett. The only applied
system for outer space is
Garrett built.
When the problem is
environmental, the solu-
tion comes from Garrett
because. . .

Highway trafﬁc posts made out of rubber are carving out an impressive
records in reducing vehicle damage, personal injury, and even death at highway
danger spots. The highway posts, produced by Good Year, are hollow rubber
cylinders, seven inches in diameter. They are anchored in cement by means
of a steel pipe that extends part way into the rubber, but only three inches
above ground level.

Patterned after rubber dock fenders that protect ships and piers from

what’s new

damage, the guard posts are made of a high tensile rubber compound. Normally,
they extend three feet above the ground after installation, but they can be

customized to ﬁt speciﬁc safety requirements.
At Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the ﬂexible posts have eliminated two trafﬁc

hazards that had maimed motorists and damaged their cars for years.

The task of building and sustaining superconductive
magnets with over 100,000 gauss ﬁeld density has in the
past been hindered by two major obstacles: ﬁrst it has
been difficult to put enough direct current (over 500
amperes) in the superconductive magnet——-through heavy
conductors—to make 100,000 gauss magnets practical;
second, the current ﬂowing through these ordinary con-
ductors, and the cryogenic system can cause a tremendous
“heat leak” which dissipates the low temperature environ-
ment and hence, the high gauss ﬁeld density.

However, high gauss cryogenic magnets should no
longer be difficult to build and sustain due to a new
“flux—pump” developed at one of General Electric’s labora-
tories in Schenectady, New York.

The electric ﬁux pump transforms a small input of
alternating current—through small conductors—into a
large output of direct current without moving parts at
42° Kelvin. The pump is put into the cryostat with the
superconductive magnet. The new kind of d-c power sup-
ply can produce up to 500 amperes, maintain its ﬁeld by
induced, loss-free superconduct.ive currents, even though
the power supply is disconnected and create no heat leak
in the process.

Heat shield swings away as the ladle car of clean steel emerges from
degassing chamber at the Babcock and Wilcox Company’s Tubular Products
Division, the nation’s ﬁrst car-type vacuum degassing unit. With an average
tap-to—teem time of 33 minutes, the process is said to have one of the fastest,
most efficient ladle degassing cycles in the industry.

In what amounts to straight-line fashion molten steel in a ladel car enters
through one door of the vacuum chamber, gets degassed, and emerges through
another door ready for teeming. By removing unwanted gases from the melt,
the process produces cleaner, sounder, more reliable steel than is possible with
conventional air melting.

STEP FORWARD
WITH FORD MOTOR COMPANY

An Open Letter to the 1965  
College Graduate
from Donald N. Frey,

   

   Donald N. Frey was awarded a bachelor's degree in metal-
. . . lurgical engineering by the University of Michigan in 1947

   and a doctorate in 1950. One year later, he joined Ford
Motor Company as manager of the Metallurgical Depart-

ment in the Scientific Laboratory. In 1962, Dr. Frey was

   appointed assistant general manager of the Ford Division

with responsibility for all engineering, product planning
and purchasing activities. He is 41 years old.

America’s automobile industry is in the midst of a challenging era, with pros-
pects of an even more exciting and demanding tempo in the years to come.
Ford Motor Company is determined to achieve leadership in all phases of its
operation. This leadership promises to bring lasting success to the company, its
employes and its stockholders.

It will take people to accomplish this objective. Engineering, ﬁnance, styling,
marketing, product planning, sales——all require people with the knowledge,
judgment and personal drive to avail themselves of the unprecedented oppor-
tunities offered by a great industry.

The automobile business is growing. More cars are being bought now than ever
before. With increases in population and consumer buying power, even more
will be bought in the future. Realizing this, Ford Motor Company seeks to
attract college graduates who have the capacity to grow with the company
and the market.

Right now, our plans call for employing about a thousand of the best 1965
graduates we can ﬁnd, with all types of educational backgrounds. We need
specialists, but we also need persons with broad liberal-arts training who can
handle a Wide variety of assignments. Actually, in our company, many gradu-
ates grow into jobs totally unrelated to their degrees. They have discovered
that Ford offers intellectually challenging opportunities for those with the
ability to seize them. We invite you to make the same discovery.

Contact your Placement Office and arrange to see our representative.

Advancement in a Big Company:

 

C. K. Rieger

I Charles K. Rieger joined General Elec-
tric’s Technical Marketing Program after
earning a BSEE at the University of Mis-
souri in 1936. Following sales engineering
assignments in motor, defense and home

. laundry operations, he became manager of

the Heating Device and Fan Division in
1947. Other Consumer-industry management
positions followed. In 1953 he was elected
a vice president, one of the youngest men
ever named a Company officer. Mr. Rieger
became Vice President, Marketing Services
in 1959 and was appointed to his present
position in 1961. He is responsible for all
the operations of some six divisions com-
posed of 23 product operations oriented
primarily toward the Electric Utility market.

Q. How can I be sure of getting the
recognition I feel I'm capable of earn-
ing in a big company like G.E.?

A. We learned long ago we couldn't
afford to let capable people get lost.
That was one of the reasons why G.E.
was decentralized into more than a
hundred autonomous operating de-
partments. These operations develop,
engineer, manufacture and market
products much as if they were inde-

How it Works

pendent companies. Since each de-
partment is responsible for its own
success, each man's share of author-
ity and responsibility is pinpointed.
Believe me, outstanding performance
is recognized, and rewarded.

Q. Can you tell me what the “promo-
tional Iadder” is at General Electric?

A. We regard each man individually.
Whether you join us on a training
program or are placed in a specific
position opening, you'll first have to
prove your ability to handle a job.
Once you’ve done that, you'll be given
more responsibility, more difficult
projects—work that’s important to
the success of your organization and
your personal development. Your abil-
ity will create a “promotional |adder”
of your own.

Q. Will my develorment be confined
to whatever department I start in?

A. Not at all! Here's where “big com-
pany” scope works to broaden your
career outlook. Industry, and General
Electric particularly, is constantly
changing—adapting to market the
fruits of research, reorganizing to
maintain proper alignment with our
customers, creating new operations
to handle large projects. All this rep-
resents opportunity beyond the limits
of any single department.

An Interview with General E|ectric’s C. K. Rieger,Vice President and Group Executive, Electric Utility Group

Q. Yes, but just how often do these
opportunities arise?

A. To give you some idea, 25 percent
of G-E’s gross sales last year came
from products that were unknown
only five or ten years ago. These new
products range from electric tooth
brushes and silicone rubber com-
pounds to atomic reactors and inter-
planetary space probes. This chang-
ing Company needs men with ambi-
tion and energy and talent who aren't
afraid of a big job—who welcome the
challenge of helping to start new
businesses like these. Demonstrate
your abiIity—whether to handle com-
plex technical problems or to manage
people, and you won’t have long to
wait for opportunities to fit your
needs.

Q. How does General Electric help
me prepare myself for advancement
opportunity?

A. Programs in Engineering, Manu-
facturing or Technical Marketing give
you valuable on-the-job training. We
have Company-conducted courses to
improve your professional ability no
matter where you begin. Under Tui-
tion Refund or Advanced Degree Pro-
grams you can continue your formal
education. Throughout your career
with General Electric you'll receive
frequent appraisals to help your self-
development. Your advancement will
be largely up to you.

Apparatus for continuous vapor
deposition of niobium stannide on ribbon.

Very-high-ﬁeld solenoids capable of generat-
ing ﬁelds of 100,000 gauss now made with cop-
per winding require about 100 tons of equip-
ment and dissipate more than one megawatt of
power as heat. Some superconductors, in par-
ticular the compound NbaSn, can carry large
electric currents with zero power dissipation
even at high magnetic ﬁelds.1 Hence, they can
be used for the construction of light weight
solenoids.

In the past, NbaSn was prepared by metal-
lurgical sintering techniques, which resulted in
a porous and extremely brittle material not
suitable for widespread use. In 1960, scientists
in the Materials Research Laboratory, David
Sarnoff Research Center, developed a vapor-
phase transport process for preparing this com-
pound for the ﬁrst time in a dense crystalline
state—and in forms suitable for widespread use
in both research and application. It consists of a
simultaneous reduction of gaseous mixed chlo-
rides of niobium and tin by hydrogen at 900
to l200°C.2

Based on this process, an apparatus was de-
veloped for continuous coating of refractory
metal and ribbon with NbaSn. The NbaSn
coated ribbon has both electrical and mechani-
cal properties desirable for solenoid construc-
tion. It is very thin (typical cross section is
2 x 90 mil, thickness of deposit about 0.3 mil)
and hence sufficiently ductile to wrap around
diameters as small as 3A; inch and it can support
enormous currents densities: 1 x 106 amp/cm?
at zero ﬁeld, 3 x 105 amp/cm? in a transverse
DC ﬁeld of 92,500 gauss and 1.5 x 105 amp/
cm? in a pulsed longitudinal ﬁeld of 170,000
gauss. By comparison, copper can carry only
1 x 103 amp/cm? safely. Hence, superconduc-
tive solenoids approaching a ﬁeld of 200,000
gauss appear feasible.

Parametric Amplifier

Experiments at RCA Laboratories show that
superconducting ﬁlms exhibit a nonlinear in-
ductance at frequencies extending well into the
millimeter-wave range. Frequency conversion
was observed in tin ﬁlms cooled below their
critical temperature. Now ampliﬁcation and
oscillation have also been demonstrated. A
superconducting “paramp” has been operated
at 6 kmc with 11 db of net gain. Parametric
oscillations at about the same frequency were
also effected.

The superconducting ﬁlm and the varactor
differ markedly in many respects; hence, their
circuit needs also differ. A study of the charac-
teristics of superconducting ﬁlms and paramet-
ric device requirements resulted in the concept
ofthe “modiﬁed dielectric resonator.” The res-
onator, which was used to demonstrate ampliﬁ-
cation, consists of a very low-loss, high-permit-
tivity, dielectric cavity modiﬁed at one of its
boundaries by a superconducting ﬁlm.

The unit is placed in a waveguide where
power is coupled to it with a movable short-
circuit. The resonant frequency of the cavity is
a function of its dimensions, the permittivity of
the dielectric and the impedance of the ﬁlm.

While it may be premature to speculate on
the eventual role of the superconducting
“paramp”, it should be noted that the device,
in principle, offers an outstanding set of fea-
tures not to be found in the varactor or any
other device. First, the frequency limit of super-
conducting ﬁlms may extend into the sub-milli-
meter wave range. Secondly, it is expected that
the noise performance of the device can match
that of the maser. Furthermore, superconduc-
tors can be pumped with considerably lower
power and at a lower frequency than either the
varactor or the maser. Finally, since one can
fabricate large-area ﬁlms (as compared with
lumped varactors), wide-band truly distributed
traveling-wave parametric ampliﬁcation may
become possible.

Superconductive Magnet

 

Recently RCA developed a superconductive
magnet believed to be the most powerful in the
world, in a practical form that can revolu-
tionize many aspects of solid-state electronics
and high-energy physics research.

Success of this magnet and the attainment of
zero current degradation using magnetic ﬁeld
stabilization followed research in superconduc-
tive degradation phenomena.

The device generates a magnetic ﬁeld of
107,000 gauss. When commercially available, it
will enable scores of small and medium-sized
research laboratories to carry out experiments
that now require large multi-million-dollar
facilities in order to generate the immense mag-
netic ﬁelds needed for solid-state, atomic, and
related areas of research. '

Test data obtained under a NASA study
contract played a signiﬁcant part in RCA’s de-
velopment of the 107,000-gauss magnet. The
present experimental unit has a bore of one
inch, offering for the ﬁrst time in a supercon-
ductive magnet a working area large enough
for practical laboratory experiments. The com-
pany is continuing its work for NASA, explor-
ing the feasibility of a 150,000-gauss supercon-
ductive magnet with a one-foot bore, designed
for experiments in space propulsion techniques.

The experimental 107,000-gauss unit was
built at the RCA Laboratories by an advanced
development group of the RCA Electronic
Components and Devices organization.

The experimental RCA magnet weighs 26
pounds and is about the size and shape of a
half-gallon paint can. It is made superconduc-
tive by immersion in liquid helium and is
started with the output of 6-volt storage batter-
ies. By contrast, nonsuperconductive magnets
developing similar magnetic ﬁelds require al-
most 1.5 million watts of power and enormous
water-cooling systems.

Your life at Du Pont one of a series for technical graduates

Would you make a good catalyst ?

With us, creative technical employees are natural catalysts.
They cause reactions. Good ones.

For example, they helped us double our sales to $2.4 billion
in the past 12 years. In the past 28 years alone, their research
efforts helped us develop new products that created 40,000 new
career positions. At this writing they're ironing the wrinkles
out of 200 completely new products, with more on the way.

Technical men and women are happy at Du Pont, too. They
get a chance to move around—to actually change jobs without
changing companies and without losing their accrued benefits.
Their future bursts with promise, because they know we fill
important positions from within.

Would you make a good catalyst at Du Pont? Learn all the
facts by letting us send you more information. Write us a letter
now (or clip and mail our coupon).

Anyone for hydrodesulfurization?

How about it? Want to hydrodesulfurize? Hydrode—
sulfurize oil, that is. Fuel oil. Dr. James Mosby,
Purdue, ’64 does. He experimentally optimizes the
commercial procedure for removing sulfur. He’s been
working on hydrodesulfurization ever since he joined
the American Oil Company as a chemical engineer
last January. That’s his pilot plant behind him.

Even if you’d rather not hydrodesulfurize, there are

literally scores of other science and engineering op-
portunities at American Oil. If you’re interested in a
career in the petroleum industry, write to H. Strange
for information. His address: American Oil Company,
P. O. Box 431, Whiting, Indiana.

A Message
From the Dean
By W. R. Turkes

At the beginning of another academic year it islmy
pleasure to extend to all engineering students on behalf
of the faculty and myself a warm welcome back to the
campus. We hope all of you will have a very successful
year, both personally and academically.

It seems appropriate at this time to present informa-
tion and facts which you may ﬁnd interesting. “A good
citizen is an informed citizen,” and I think an informed
student is likely to be a good student .

The University of Pittsburgh freshman class this year
was between 1,450 and 1,500 students, of which Q56, who
come from 144 different preparatory schools in our 122nd
freshman class, are enrolled in engineering. Approximately
900 of t-he freshmen are men, and about 600 are women,
8 of whom are engineering students. In 1963-64 our
engineering school ranked 16 of 157 accredited engineer-
ing schools in the enrollment of female students. Nine-
tenths of the freshmen were in the top two—ﬁfths of their
high school classes, and two-thirds were in the ﬁrst-ﬁfth.
About 64% of the freshman class are living in the residence
halls. Engineering freshmen rank academically approxi-
mately the same as the total class, but only 45% will
live on campus.

Enrollment on the regional campuses is up with about
740 new freshmen registered. Next fall the Oakland
campus will begin receiving appreciable numbers of ﬁfth-
term students from the regional campuses. This fall by
transfer 73 engineering students entered Pitt from 24
different colleges, includingthe regional campuses.

I recently made a visit to the Greensburg campus to
talk to the engineering students there in their seminar
program. Later on during the term each engineering
department will send a staff man to the Greensburg
campus to describe the department’s particular ﬁeld of
engineering, to aid the students in selecting their ﬁelds
of specialization. Visits to the other reigonal campuses
by the Dean and departmental chairmen are scheduled
for later in the term. _-

In the academic year 1963-64 the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines awarded 253 Bachelor of Science degrees,
63 Master’s degrees, and 8 doctorate degrees. In the 118
years since the ﬁrst engineering degree was earned at
Pitt, 10,606 Bachelor of Science degrees in Engineering
and Mines have been awarded.

Final enrollment ﬁgures for the fall term are not
available, but it is anticipated the undergraduate student
body will be about the same size as last year, with about
952 full-time and 492 part-time students attending
engineering classes.

Of the 261 engineering seniors registered with the
Placement Bureau, all but four have been placed with
the median monthly starting salary of $605.

This fall we have on the campus the ﬁrst students to
hold fellowships under the new National Science Founda-
tion’s Graduate Traineeship Program. There are six full-
time students on this program, which provides a $2,400
stipend for the student plus dependency ‘allowance and
tuition costs. The NSF granted about 2,000 of these
throughout the country this summer in engineering. Next
year Natural Sciences will be included, and about 3,000
will be granted nationwide.

The sponsored-research programs in engineering are
steadily increasing. At the present time there are 19
projects in operation at a total cost of $1,123,149.

Since engineering interests cover such a board areas,
an increasing number of our faculty are being given joint
appointments in other areas of the University. At present,
engineering faculty members hold joint appointments in
the Computing Center, the Graduate School of Business,
Physics, and Chemistry.

The University’s participation in Latin American
education is continuing at an accelerated pace and now
involves Quito University in Eucador as well as Santa
Maria University in Chile. The Schools of Engineering
and Mines pioneered this acitivty for the University with
their faculty team assigned to Chile in 1960.

Dr. Paul R. McCormick, who was director of the
engineering project in Chile for two years, has returned
to the campus and is now Associate Chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Department. Dr. G. E. Klinzing,
of the Chemical Engineering Department, is at present at
Quito, Ecuador, where programs in Chemical and Civil
Engineering are being developed. Dr. Jerry Chang is the
engineering faculty member in Quito responsible for de-
veloping civil engineering programs. At present there are
eleven University faculty members in Quito, and additions
will be made next year.

In the area of facilities and buildings, the item of
major interest to engineering students is the new Engineer-
ing Center, which will be located diagonally across the
street at the corner of Thackery and O’Hara Streets. The
preliminary plans have been approved by the General
State Authority, and the architects and engineering de-
partmental representatives are currently engaged in ﬁnal
design and facility layout problems. In a future issue of
t-he Skyscraper Engineer I plan to report in detail on the
Engineering Center.
