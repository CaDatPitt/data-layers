William Carpenter is a sales representative for
Columbia-Southern, working out of the St. Louis
district sales office. His job is an interesting one
and a vital one in the fast-growing Columbia-
Southern chemical business.

Bill studied engineering with the thought in mind
of becoming a salesman. He has some sound
reasoning to offer to the graduate. But let's start
at the beginning of his story.

Bill entered Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Pa., in
1942 but the war interrupted his college education
for two years. He graduated as a chemical engineer
in 1948.

He wanted to get into sales rather than production
or engineering. He felt then, as he does now, that
an engineering background is becoming an increas-
ingly important one for the man who wants to
move ahead in the ﬁeld of selling. He believes that
the vast amount of initiative and imagination in
specialized sales work is based on a foundation of
technical knowledge.

Bill looked around for quite a bit after graduation
to ﬁnd the right spot for his talents. He had many
interviews but ﬁnally settled on Columbia-Southern.
He was impressed with the caliber of people at
Columbia-Southern . . the type with whom he

liked to work. He found Columbia-Southern a
progressive, rapidly expanding company. He real-
ized that the sound sales training program, super-
vised by the Technical Service De artment, guar-
anteed complete understanding oi) his products.
The program called for actual plant Work in
production, engineering, research and shipping—
providing him with the thorough background
which would be demanded by his customers.

Bill is glad he decided on Columbia-Southern. He
now has full responsibility for all accounts assigned
to him as sales representative in the Corporation's
St. Louis District Sales Oﬂice.

Bill has this to say to the graduate: "Look for a
company that is growing. Look for a company
that will give you the opportunity to do the work
you are best suited to do. Look for the organization
which offers real opportunity for advancement."

Columbia-Southern has opportunities for graduates
in all business and technical ﬁelds including engi-
neering, research and development, sales, plant
design, mining, construction, maintenance, pro-
duction, accounting, transportation and related

ﬁelds.

tion to our Pittsburgh address or any of the plants.

The Torrington Needle Bearing

proper housing design is essential to proper performance

The Torrington Needle Bearing
offers many design and opera-
tional advantages for a great
variety of products and equip-
ment. For example, a Needle
Bearing has greater rated radial
load capacity in relation to its
outside diameter than any other
type of anti-friction bearing. It is
extremely light in weight. And it

is easy to install and lubricate.

Housing Maintains
Bearing Rounolness

The housing is an essential part
of the Needle Bearing assembly.
Care should be taken to provide
a straight, round housing bore to
the recommended tolerances.
The thin, surface-hardened
outer shell of the Needle Bearing
acts as the outer race surface as
well as a retainer for the rolls.
This shell assumes the shape of
the housing into which it is
pressed. Consequently, the hous-
ing bore should be round, and the
housing so designed that it will
carry the radial load imposed on

the bearing Without distortion.

Housing Material
Determines Bore Size

The speciﬁed housing bore dimen-
sions for any given material
should be maintained in order to
give the proper running clearance

Needle Bearings require simple
housings. If the housing bores are
held to proper size, accurate oper-
ation and high radial capacity are
assured.

When designing housings of
materials that are soft or of low
tensile strength, allowance should
be made for the plastic flow of the

material when the bearing is

pressed into place. Bore dimen-
sions in such cases should be less
than standard. Needle Bearings
can be pressed directly into phe-

though metal inserts are recom-

Dr. G. R. Fitterer

Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald announced to a
group of several hundred alumni of the Univer-
sity on February 25, that plans had been approv-
ed for the construction of a new building for the
Schools o-f Engineering and Mines at a cost of
one million dollars. The funds for this building
were solicited from alumni and people in the
Pittsburgh area at about the time of the Mines
Building ﬁre in 1948, at which time the Chem-
ical and Mettalurgical Engineering Departments
lost their laboratories.

The new building which will provide some
38,000 square feet of ﬂoor space will be located
between and back of the old Mellon Institute
building and Thaw Hall. It will be a six story
structure as shown in the artist’s sketch, and
will help materially in providing much needed
space for all departments of the Schools.

Plans for the two schools include the use of
State Hall, Thaw Hall, the new building and
the Automotive Highways Laboratory. If the En-
gineering Research Division maintains its cur-
rent operations, other space such as the new
laboratory on Fifth Avenue. will also be needed.

State Hall, which was the ﬁrst building on

Both of these drawings tell the same story but
draftsmen are now being encouraged to use the
smaller, simpler one at the left. The larger

paper, and eight days of a man’s time to draw
it. The smaller drawing took two days and re-
quired less than four square feet of paper.

the Oakland campus. was built by the State for
the School of Mines in 1908. The next year, Thaw
Hall was built for the School of Engineering
through a popular subscription by the people of
Pittsburgh. At that early date the two Schools
constituted a major portion of the University.
However, the rest of the University expand-
ed so rapidly after the activities were moved
from the North Side to the Oakland site, that
it was necessary for these two buildings to be
used by other divisions.

In 1938 the departments of the two Schools
were partially rehabilitated in State Hall and this
rehabilation became complete following the Mines
building ﬁre on top of the hill.

Thaw Hall is presently shared about 50 per
cent with the Physics Department, but it is hoped
that eventually this department will also get new
quarters, at which time Thaw Hall could be turn-
ed completely over to the Schools of Engineering
and Mines.

The new building will beneﬁt all eight depart-
ments of the .two Schools. Even if a department
is not to be located in the new building, it will
beneﬁt through space which will be released
by some other department.

The various departments have considerable
equipment which is currently not in use because
of lack of space. The most outstanding case is
the Aeronautics division’s Aerolab wind-tunnel
which is valued at about $20,000. This has been
in storage since 1948 and was the ﬁrst one of
its type constructed in the United States. It will
be one of the ﬁrst pieces of equipment to be in-
stalled in the new building.

APPLYING THE WOIIN

Because of its unusual char-
acteristics, the wound-rotor ,;
motor finally comes into its own.

BY RICHARD F. WOLL, E.E. ’37

 

A Typical Squirrel-Cage Rotor

When a man has the job of selecting a motor
for a given task he has, essentially, four choices.
If the machine to be driven must run at con-
stant speed, his choice almost inevitably is a
synchronous motor. This motor requires a source
of direct current for excitation, suitable control,
and is relatively efpensive. At the other extreme,
if a wide range of speed co-ntrol is necessary,
easily and efficiently, and if d-c power is avail-
able, some form of d-c motor is the probable
choice. However the majority of jobs in industry
can be performed by the simple squirrel-cage
induction motor. Its speed falls off only slight-
ly with increasing loads. It has the great merit
of bein_g the simplest of all motors. requires
the least control, and is lowest in cost. But its
speed (on a constant-frequency, constant-voltage
power supply) is dictated solely by the load: it
is subject to no control.

There are, however, many applications for
motors that do require operation over a limited
range of different speeds. For these, particularly
where direct current is not available, the wound-
rotor induction motor is a good choice. Its con-

THE AUTHOR

Richard F. Woll, a na-
tive of Pittsburgh, is an
alumnus of the University
of Pittsburgh. He came to
Westinghouse in 1937 im-
mediately after gradua-
tion with a BS in E.E. He
started on the motor-test
floor in East Pittsburgh
and subsequently was
transferred to the Motor
Engineering Department.
When the whole motor
activity was moved to Buf-
falo in 1946, Woll went
along. he is in the AC. Motor Engineering Section.

While confined by a temporary disability, Mr.

 

trol is fairly simple, and it has no commutator,
with its attendant maintenance problem.

The speed at which an induction motor runs
at a given load is determined by the electrical
resistance in the rotor circuit. The greater re-
sistance the slower the motor runs: or, with
resistance constant. increased load slows the
speed. The two types of motors differ only in
regard to this rotor resistance. In the squirrel-
cage motor, it is ﬁxed; in the wound-rotor motor,
it is adjustable.

As its name implies, conductors in the squir-
rel-cage rotor consist of bars extending axial-
ly through each slot in the laminated core, the
extensions of all bars beyond the rotor punch-
ing being joined to rings at each end to form
a complete permanently ﬁxed rotor circuit. This
rotor is shown in the picture above: typical
speed-torque characteristics are shown in Fig. 2.

The conductors of a wound rotor are composed
of coils placed in the rotor slots in the same
manner as the stator winding. A typical wound
rotor is shown in the second picture. The rotor
coils are suitably interconnected and the leads
brought out to collector rings that rotate with
the shaft. Varying amounts of external resis-
ance can be inserted in the rotor circuit through
brushes that ride on the collector rings.

The amount of rotor resistance in an induc-
tion motor is the factor determining its general
speed-torque characteristics. Hence any squir-
rel-cage induction motor, having ﬁxed rotor re-
sistance, is necessarily limited to a single set of
speed-torque characteristics: thus its use is con-
ﬁned to applications for which the particular
speed-torque characteristics are acceptable. How-
ever, this does not severly restrict the range
of application for squirrel-cage motors. Typical
speed-torque characteristice for two popular types
of squirrel-cage motors are shown in Fig. 1.

A wide range of speed-torque characteristics
can be obtained from a single wound-rotor in-
duction motor by varying the amount of extern-
al resistance in the rotor circuit. For example,
the two families of curves shown in Figs. 2a

Woll found time suddenly plentiful and turned his
hand to article writing, this article being one of those
written at that time.

the difference resulting from the values of ex-
ternal secondary resistance embodied in the two
controllers. The top curve in each family is for
zero external secondary resistance (collector ring
short circuted), the total resistance being that of
the internal rotor winding. The remaining curves
are with successively increasing amounts of ex-
ternal resistance in the rotor circuit, each in-
crement being relatively larger in the case of
Fig. 2b. Intermediate curves are available sim-
ply by inserting the suitable value of external
secondary resistance.

An examination of Figs. 1 and 2 seems to
indicate that. theoretically, a squirrel-cage mot-
or could be designed to have a rotor resistance
such that it could essentially duplicate any one
of the speed-torque curves in Fig. 2. From a
practical standpoint, however, this is not feas-
ible. A duplication of any one of the speed—tor-

que curves on Fig. 2 (or any other intermed-
iate curve desired) could be accomplished with
one squirrel-cage motor. In general this would
be uneconomical and impractical from several
points of view.

From a manufacturing standpoint it would ne-
cessitate an almost unlimited variety of rotor
punchings, conductor sizes and materials, and
end-ring sizes and materials to provide each re-
quired rotor resistance. This obviously would in-
crease the cost and thus nullify one of the great
merits of the squirrel-cage motor. The majority
of applications for squirrel-cage motors can be
adequately served by existing types.

Also, any squirrel-cage motor, whatever its
rotor resistance, has but one speed—torque curve.

possible characteristic curves.

With the foregoing short review of the wound-
rotor motor’s characteristics in mind, its appli-
cation capabilities can be more reasonably anal-
yzed. Obviously, the most common applications
for wound-ro-tor motors are those requiring speed
variations. These can be sub-divided into two
classiﬁcations — variable-torque and constant-
torque applications. _

A good example of a variable-torque applica-
tion is a fan drive. The wound-rotor motor should
be applied to fan drivers in those cases where a
varying volume o-f air is to be delivered. This
is achieved by operating the motor at selected
speeds between full speed and approximately 75-
percent speed. However, where sufficiently accu-
rate control of air delivery can be obtained by
alternately operating the fan at one of two-, three
or four deﬁnite speeds. a multis'peed squirrel-cage
mo-tor should be used. This is accomplished by
reconnecting stator winding or by the use of dif-
ferent numbers of poles. The potentialities of the
multispeed squirrel-cage induction motor for fan
drives or other variable-torque applications is
shown in Fig. 3. These curves show the speed-
torque characteristics of various 60-cycle mo-tors.
each having a top speed of 1800 rpm (4 poles).
Although the detailed. curves would be some-
what different if based on a slower top speed.
the trend would be similar. As the number of
po-has increase the maximum torque available
drops off sharply. This is acceptable with fan
drive because the torque required to drive- a fan
decreases rapidly as fan speed is reduced.

Due to winding-space requirements (limiting
the number of separate stator windings to two),
only certain pole combinations are available in
a given motor, Keeping these limitations of the
squirrel-cage multi-speed motor in mind, com-
parason of curves in Fig. 3 with those in Fig. 2
or Fig. 4 reveals that the available operating
speeds for the multispeed squirrel-cage motor are
in relatively large steps, whereas with the wound-
rotor motor a series of closely spaced operating
speeds is available. enabling closer control of
air volume.

Of course, in many fan ap_plicati-ons the amount
of air to be moved is not particularly critical, for
example. roof ventilators in a factory building.
These applications are properly served by stand-
ard single-speed squirrel-cage motors, and ade-
quate control of the air delivery is simply a mat-
ter of turning the motor -off or on.

It is advisable to stress a limitation in the
use of wound-rotor motors for applications in-
volving speed reduction. Basically, the speed at
which any induction motor runs depends some-
what upon the amount of load it is called upon
to deliver. In Fig. 1 (solid curve). at 175-per-
cent torque, the motor speed is approximately $3
percent of synchronous speed. while at 75-per-
cent torque it is 98 percent. This is a relatively
small change in speed for a considerable change
in load. which is the reason the induction motor
is thought of as an inherently constant-speed
machine. However, whether the speed is 93 per-
cent. 98 percent. or some other value is deter-
mined by the load.

In the case of a wound-ro-tor unit having large
external secondary resistance, this characteristic
can lead to an operating speed quite different
than intended. For example, consider the bottom
curve on Fig. 4a. where the speed at 100-per-
cent torque is 50 percent of synchronous speed.
While this particular setting of external sec-
ondary resistance is commonly referred to as
giving 50—percent speed reduction, obviously the
speed is much greater than 50 percent if the
load is decreased sufﬁciently. Thus, for very light
loads. no appreciable speed reduction can be ef-
fected by adding external resistance in the sec-
ondary circuit.

To explain this point more fully. a speciﬁc
example is illustrated in Fig. 4. The speed-tor-
que curves of a 10-hp, 1150 rpm. wound rotor
motor with adjustable secondary resistance are
plotted, together with the speed-torque curve
of a typical fan. Since the torque requirements
of the average fan vary as the square of its speed,
at slower speeds the required torque diminishes
rapidly. For a given setting of external second-

. ary resistance, the point of operation on the

particular motor speed-torque curve will be where
it is intersected by the fan speed-torque curve.
At the secondary resistance setting that provides
half speed (600 rpm). if normal full-load torque
is required, for this speciﬁc application the speed
is actually slightly less than 75-percent speed
(900 rpm) because the torque demanded by the
fan is much below that of full load. This condi-
tion must be taken into account when applying
wound-rotor motors to fans and similar drives.
Where a variable torque application requires
slow-speed operation. appreciably less than 75
percent of its high speed, a multispeed squirrel-
cage motor should be used.

A good example of a variable-speed, constant-
torque application is a conveyor that must be
driven at different speeds depending upon the
desired rate of loading or unloading. The vari-
able—speed characteristics of the wound-rotor
motor are well suited to this application. How-
ever, the slowest operating speed of the motor
should not be less than approximately half the
synchronous (no—load) speed, for two reasons:
ﬁrst, altho-ugh both rotor and stator losses -of a
wound-rotor motor at a given torque output are
essentially the same at any reduced speed as they
are at full speed, the lessened ventilation at the
slower speeds causes overheating if such opera-
tion is prolonged; second, as Fig. 4b shows. the
curve becomes so steep that a slight change in
load produces a marked change in speed. with

How to turn a high strength steel cup

inside out, cold

OFFHAND, anyone familiar with high
strength steels would say it couldn’t be
done. But one of our customers does
it every day.

Employing a unique reverse—drawing
method and using a US’ S High Strength
Steel especially adapted for this process,
they turn out cylindrical containers of
various kinds that are not only stronger
than those made from carbon steel but
Weigh substantially less.

To accomplish this, the steel has to
meet two entirely opposite require-
ments. It has to be so strong that it
can be used in thinner gages to reduce
weight, and yet must have enough duc-
tility to satisfy the drastic fabrication
method that would be considered se-
vere even for carbon steel.

This method is used to draw cups
for large, low-pressure cylinders. These
cups, 14% in. in diameter and 24% in.
deep, are drawn cold, from 12-gage

steel blanks in one con-

tinuous stroke in a re-

verse draw press. The

diagrams at left show
  how it is done.

Starting with a 38 in. diameter steel
blank (Fig. 1) the press ﬁrst draws the
steel into a shallow cup (Fig. 2). As
the stroke continues, the cup, is literally
turned inside out (Fig. 3) to form the
ﬁnished cup (Fig. 4) which has very
uniform wall thickness. Two of these
cups are then welded together to make
a cylinder.

Made with high strength steel, cyl-
inders weigh about 20 lbs. less. The
maker gets 26% more cylinders from
each ton of steel used. Lighter weight
makes cylinders easier to handle, and
also pays off in lower freight costs-
both on the steel from our mills and on
cylinders shipped. (A customer 500
miles away saves as much as $100 per
carload.)

Developing special steels for special
customer needs is an important job of
United States Steel metallurgists and
engineers. With their tremendous back-
ground of practical experience, they are
ready to work on any problem that in-
volves the more efficient use of steel.

year and completed the past semester. The input
velocity to the engine is 550 MPH and the net
thrust is six ounces. The 550 MPH air stream
is obtained by expansion of air compressed to
300 P.S.I. by the Ingersoll—Rand compressor in
3 Thaw Hall. The compressed air expands through
a 1/3 inch pipe to atmospheric pressure and a
velocity "of 550 MPH. Under these conditions the
air enters the diffuser section of the ram jet and
mixes with the acetylene fuel injected into the en-
gine through a combination ﬂame holder and fuel
injector. Combustion is initiated by a glow plug
in the combustion section of the engine. After
initial combustion, the turbulent flow of gases
gives continuous . burning without continual
sparking. For starting, the velocity of the air
stream must be low in order that the Plug coil
is not cooled by the air stream. Once burning has
started, the air stream may be increased to the
design velocity of 550 MPH and the fuel supply
may be regulated to give Various types of flames
and various thrust quantities. Now under con-
struction is a balance system by whic.h the en-
gine strust can be accurately measured; both a
mechanical and an electrical system are con-
‘ ' ’ “‘ ' templated.

WORLD’S LARGEST ROTATING
MACHINE

The largest rotating machine
ever built is being put together by
the Westinghouse Electric Corpora-
tion. It consists of the ﬁve compres-
sors and drive for the transonic and
supersonic wind tunnels now being
built for the U. S. Air Force in Ten-
nessee.

Four motors with a combined
power of 216,000 horsepower are re-
quired to drive the compressors. Two
of these are synchronous motors,
each being nearly one third larger in

horsepower than the 65,000—hp pump-

motors recently installed at Grand
Coulee Dam.

The supersonic compressor for the
wind tunnel will consist of four com-
pressors in series, while the tran-
sonic compressor will be a single
unit. Statistics on the inlet-stage
blades of the transonic compressor
suggest the scale of this super wind
maker. Each blade is more than two
feet across the face, six feet long,
weighs almost two thirds of a ton,
and rotates at 600 rpm on a spindle
18 feet in diameter. The tip speed
for this great mass is 650 mph and
the centrifugal force tending to pull
each blade from its roots, is 800 tons.

Marine Owes Life to “Shrap Jacket”

BODY ARMOR FOR MARINE
CORPS

U. S. Marine Corps body armor
called “shrap jackets” by American
ﬁghting men, is being produced in
quantity by Plywoods-"Plastics Cor-
poration, a Westinghouse subsidiary.

The “shrap jackets” get their life-
saving properties from the way they
are made, and their two basic in-
gredients, glass cloth and a synthetic
resin. This combination enables the
material, known as Doron, to actu-
ally stop deadly mortar and grenade
fragments and similar low velocity
missiles.

When- a fragment or a small cali-
ber bullet strikes the material, the
layers of impregnated glass cloth
separate as the missile attempts to
smash its way through. This delam-
ination actually sets up a cushioning
effect that instantly reduces the
velocity of the fragment to practic-
ally zero.

Early versions of the armored
vests consisted of ﬂat Doron plates.
However, tests proved that the flat

MARCH, 1953

plates afforded less mobility. As a
result, Doron is now curved so that
it ﬁts the contour of the body. The
plates themselves, one eighth of an

inch thick and 51/4 inches square,‘

are sewn into the pockets of heavy
nylon vests. About 20 plates go into
each vest and overlap each other
like ﬁsh scales.

Doron is made by applying heat
and pressure to layers of resin—im—
pregnated glass cloth. While the ex-
act details of manufacture are with-
held for security reasons, it can be

were, the plates would lose some of
their effectiveness against the mis-
siles they are intended to stop.

The p-resent model of the armored
vest, weighing less than eight pounds,
has been described as the best of its
type ever developed.

PLASTIC MODEL AIDS
VIBRATION ANALYSIS

The technique of using plastic
models to analyze the effects of vi-
bration on electric generators or
other large machinery has been de-
veloped by research scientists of the
Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
This young lady at the Westinghouse
Research Laboratories records the
vibrations of a generator frame
model with the aid of a crystal phon-
ograph pickup. In testing, a varied
range of vibration frequencies are
applied by an electromagnetic
driver-—not unlike the driving ele-
ment of a radio loud speaker. The
method may be used to investigate
vibratory effects on any large com-
plex machinery where it is impossible
to get such information by mathe-
matical computation. Similar in
shape to the actual machine, the
models are inexpensive and save
costly design changes later.

ENGINEERING THE ATOMIC SUB

Many problems were encountered in building the world’s first atomic sub.

Within the sleek hull of our ﬁrst atomic sub-
marine will lie some of engineering’s greatest
achievements. Although our government displays
to the public an attitude of pessimism in mat-
ters of deep security, the startling signiﬁcance
of the atomic submarine was revealed at Presi-
dent Truman’s dedication of the hull last June
at Groton, Conn. There the power plant of the
Nautilus (SSN—571) was heralded as the fore-
runner of atomic power for civilian use.

The man in charge of constructing the Nau-
tilus is Navy Captain H. G. Rickover. Captain
Rickover’s bilateral function is as head of the
Nuclear Power Division of the Navy and as
head of the A. E. C.’s Naval Reactors Branch.
His energetic prodding of the Atomic Energy
Commision yielded a $28.5 million authoriza-
tion in late 1950 for constructing the hull of
the sub. The contract was awarded to the Elec-
tric Boat Division of General Dynamics, build-
er of most Navy submarines. After enlisting the
aid of some of the most brilliant engineers avail-
able, Rickover and his associates established an
atomic submarine school at Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology. Their training completed
there, the atomic submariners traveled to West
inghouse’s huge testing station at Arco, Idaho, to

ines. Two mobile reactors are being_ designed.
The Westinghouse reactor, being built at the
Bettis plant, near Dravosburg, will be a “slow”
reactor, utilizing water as a coolant. General
Electric’s reactor. being tested at West Milton,
N. Y., is an intermediate reactor. using metal as
a heat-transfer liquid. _ _

The atomic engine is essentially a simple ma-
chine for generating heat. A purely theoretical
intermediate nuclear reactor could be describ-
ed as follows: Its core IS a boi_{ of stainless steel,
coated internally with beryllium oxide, _a com-
pound possessing the properties of reﬁecting cer-
tain types of radiation. Within this boig are al-
ternate plates of uranium and graphite. The
uranium is enriched with U-235 or PU-239. The
plates of graphite are machined to close toler-
ances and function as neutron moderators. Both
the graphite and uranium plates are encased
in containers of zirconium. or other substances
incapable of interfering with free neutron flux.
Between the plates of the reactor are void spaces
through which a heat transferent circulates.
This liquid is probably a metal of low melting
point, such as sodium, bismuth or a sodium-po-
tassium alloy. The heat transferent. let_ us say
sodium. is pumped electromagnetically into the

train on a land-based prototype of a ship pro-
pulsion reactor.

Meanwhile, progress on the reactor propul-
sion unit was rapid. The theory behind the
atomic power plant is as old as the first atomic
pile at Chicago, University. A nuclear power
plant utilizes, in short. a controlled atomic explo-
sion. Energyis derived as it is in the A-bomb. the
difference being that the release of energy is
restrained by the introductioneof matrials that
absorb neutrons faster than the ﬁssionable atoms.

It then circulates out of the reactor to a heat
exchanger. where it yields the heat to water.
forming steam. This steam in turn will drive the
main propulsion turbine. and also run turbo-
generators. There is a reason for using a metal-
lic heat transferent. Heavy water, a satisfac-
tory transfer ﬂuid at low operating temper-
atures, cannot function efficiently at the high
temperatures of the intermediate reactor. An-
other ﬂuid. one incapable of absorbing ﬁssion-
sustaining neutrons is necessary. The core of
the reactor is encased in a thick cell of graphite.

other successive layers. all designed of mater-
ials which protect the crew from radiation.
Atoms, the masses of which are similar to that
of the neutron. are effective in this respect. as
they absorb part of the neutron’s “punch”. Such
atoms are contained in hydrogen-rich mater-
ials such as water, sawdust, or paraffin. Several
other sources suggest the use of concrete. lead
or 24-carat gold, substances which halt neutrons
by virtue of their masses. The bulk. thickness
and weight of this shielding presents a big prob-
lem in designing a mobile reactor propulsion
unit.

_ The nuclear reactor generates heat so rap-
idly through the release of atomic energy that
the entire unit would melt if this heat were un-
restrained. Reactions in the atomic furnaces
are controlled by the introduction of materials
that absorb neutorons faster than ﬁssionable ele-
ments. These materials are cadmium and boron-
steel in the form -of plates that are thrust in and
out of the ﬁssionable mass. Sliding the rods in
cuts the neutron density and reduces ﬁssion.
Sliding them in all the Way halts the reaction
entirely. The rods are inserted electrically be-
tween the ﬁssioning mass by amplidynes, con-
trolled automatically by a thermostat. In the
event of a failure within the amplidynes, emer-
gency control rods of boron-steel are driven into
the reaction mass by a hydraulic accumulator.

Each component of this ﬁrst nuclear power
plant had to be engineered from scratch. A pump
had to be developed—a. pump that required “zero”
maintenance —one that had to pump hot radio-
active liquid efficiently. without noise, leakage or
lwbrication. An ingenious electromagnetic pump
that has no -moving parts was devised. It has
great possibilities in industry.

Carbon dioxide may be removed from the
artiﬁcial atmosphere of the Nautilus by such
chemicals as lithium hydroxide. Odors will be
removed by activated charcoal ﬁlters. Smoke
and dust particles will be precipitated by elec-
tric Precipitrons. A device to extract oxygen
from sea water has recently been perfected. It
will eliminate bulky oxygen storage batteries.

Other engineering achievements include among
other items, lightweight shielding. perfect stain-
less steel welds and weight distribution of the
heavy propulsion unit. For the reactor to develop
maximum efficiency, its core must be construc-
ted of metals that have high heat resistance and

are non-absorbent of the neutrons needed to
sustain the reaction. Experiments revealed that
zirconium would fulﬁll this need. Before the ex-
periments pure zirconium was practically un-
heard of. It was of some value as a vacuum
tube “getter”, in alloying certain types of steel
and, when alloyed with iron, as an agent of
grain-size control and scavenger in steel casting.
In view of its use as a getter, one might as-
sume that zirconium would be of little value in
a reactor, but exhaustive research proved that
zirconium of sufficient purity no longer bore pro-
perties of gas consumption. The preparation of
zirconium is difficult. None was being produced.

A Sketch of the Sub’s Power Plant

Within a year. engineers and metal processors
found ways of extracting zirconium in quantity
from its -oxide and silicate ores. Now, vital por-
tions of the reactor are being constructed of
pure zirconium.

Other engineering developments were neces-
sary. Extra power plants had to be housed in a
hull crammed with machinery. The crew had
to be kept happy. Recreation rooms, music, sooth-
ing colors and illumination, and good food are
musts during the long months beneath the sur-
face. All these problems were solved so rapidly
that even the Atomic Energy Commission was
surprised.

Perhaps the most important function of the
Nautilus will be as an anti-sub submarine. Sec-
ondary uses are foreseen in mine-laying, rocket-
launching, weather reporting and rescue work.

er faired-in as sleek as a jet engine. Only the
stamina of the crew will limit its inﬁnite ‘range.
Her crew, perhaps 70 officers and men, will be
picked by the Bureau of Naval Personnel. The
A-sub can be “ﬂown” by her skipper by means
of an airplane-type joy stick at speeds exceed-
ing 30 knots. Spare reactors will be on hand at
the- Nautilus’ base to replace the whole pro-
pulsion unit in case overhauling is required. Al-
ternate power systems will be on hand in case
work on the reactor is necessary. The Nautilus
will certainly be a deadly weapon. Her power
plant will be something more—a milestone in
engineering progress.

A letter to all seniors from the former head of the University Placement Bureau.

BY WILLIAM F. SAALBACH. MET.E. ’43

Looking for a job? During March, April, and
May, you ‘will visit the University Placement Of-

eighth ﬂoo-r of the Cathedral from one to ten
times. Even if you are in ROTC, you will or prob-
ably should do this. You will be searching for a
buyer for the most important thing in the world
—you. You won’t want just any old buyer; you’ll
want the one who is going to use you and your
engineering education in a way that will permit
you to develop to your greatest stature, the one
who will help you realize and use all the potenti-
alities you know you possess. You have studied
engineering for four years to prepare yourself for
the job you may win or lose in ﬁfteen minutes.
How should I go about preparing myself for my
company interview? What should I know? How
should I dress? What should I ask? How should
I speak? How do I sell myself ?—these are some
of the questions you should be asking yourself.

Your ﬁrst step should be to have a bull session
with yourself to evaluate your interests and your
talents. '1lh.en you ought to visit the Placement

from several hundred companies. This will raise
a few questions about various companies which

Mr. Sherwood, your Department Head, and other
faculty members can help you answer. They and
you together can decide which half dozen com-
panies you ought to interview.

Some comp-any recruiters will prefer that you
have completed a company application blank to
present to them the minute you walk through the
doorway for the interview: the Placement Office
has a large supply. If they don’t have the appli-
cation blank you need, it would be wise for you
to prepare a resume which you can surrender to
each interviewer you meet. It should be one page
long; it should bear an attractive, true, but not
glamorous photograph of yourself; it should list
personal data (age, height, weight, physical de-
fects, etc.), education, experience, extracurricular
and civic activities (including the offices you have
held), honors and awards, and references (pref-
erably professors and former supervisors). Your
resume or completed application will introduce
you professionally to your interviewer and will
save several valuable minutes of interviewing
time. Every recruiter will be ﬂattered just enough
to be kindly disposed toward you if you know a
little about the company he represents. This point
is rarely crucial, but you are certainly off on the
right foot if you know something about the com-
pany's products, the location of some of its plants,
and can talk intelligently about a recently pub-
lished newspaper or journal article about the com-
pany. Little bits of information like this, if they
are accurate (don’t bluff), do not tell the inter-
viewer that you are “on the ball,” but they do
tell him that you may be “on the ball.”

Let’s assume that you have completed a resume
or application blank and know just a little about
each company you are to- interview. You wonder
what kind of a fellow this visiting recruiter is.
He may be your potential supervisor. Some com-
panies send out the boss to seek his own men. He
may be a potential co-worker, an alumnus of Pitt.
He may be a personnel man who does little else
but interview potential employees the year round.
It will help you a little to know which he is. Paul
Sherwood may be able to tell you. Whatever he is,
you aren’t the only ﬁsh in the sea that he is look-
ing at. He saw others at Pitt before you this morn-
ing; he will see others this afternoon. Yesterday

he was at Tech or West Virginia; tomorrow he’ll
be at Ohio State or Penn State or Cornell. Next
week he’ll go to M.I.T., Harvard, Yale. He doesn’t
like it that he will have to decide whether or not
you should be considered seriously for a job after
a 15-30 minute interview; but he’ll make that de-
cision nonetheless on the basis of the interview,
the luncheon discussions with. your faculty mem-
bers, your resume or application and your refer-
ence checks. He pro-bably won’t be able to offer
you a job on the spot; ordinarily his job is merely
to serve as a preliminary screen, though some
supervisors who recruit do have the authority to
hire at first sight. No matter how much, you have
boned up, he will be prepared to tell you some-
thing more than you already know about his com-
pany. He may or may not volunteer this informa-
tion; if he doesn’t, it is probably because he wants
to see if you have sense enough to ask for it.

, Now is the appointed hour. You are called by
the intenviewer. What will he look at? He will
study your appearance. your bearing, your man-
ners—all this in 60 seconds or less; then he’ll ex-
plore your history, your experience, your extra-
curric.u‘lar activities, your brain power, your am-
bitions, your goals, your creativeness during the
next 15-30 minutes. Need I say that you should
be dressed conservatively in a pressed suit, that
you should wear a sincere smile, that you should
look like you are on top o-f your problems rather
than overwhelmed by them. that you should be
punctual? The fact that you ignore these time
worn suggestions does not necessarily make of
you a lousy engineer, but it may make you seem
to be a poor risk as an employee. None of the com-
panies you will interview are hiring Hollywood
leading men, but everyone of them is hiring a po-
tential representative to a dealer, to a customer,
to a convention, or to a Pitt engineering seminar.
What should you say and how should you say it?
You ought to be natural, be yourself. be relaxed,
feel at ease. The interviewer wants to know
where you’ve come from, where you are, and
where you want to go. Your resume or applica-
tion blank will help answer the ﬁrst two ques-
tions; you are almost sure to have to treat the
third, “where you want to go,” right here—ver-
bally—during the interview. So be prepared for
it. If you don’t know exactly what kind of a job
you want, at least have some notion of the direc-
tion you want to go. Is it technical sales, design,
research and development, technical service or
production? In telling your story, don’t ramble.
Tell crisply but completely what experience, what
hobbies, what courses you have had that tend to
point you in the direction you say you want to go.
Practice your story in advance, but avoid devel-
oping a “canned” tone. When you have told your
story via resume and discussion to the apparent

MARCH, 1953

satisfaction of your interviewer. this is the time
to ask him a few questions about his company.
You should learn something about salary policy
and fringe beneﬁts, but I wouldn’t dwell on this.
Better to spend your valuable minutes learning
something about the functional organization of
the company. its plans for meeting a changing
technological environment. the progress of your
Sigma Tau brother who graduated in 1951.

There is one very important impression that
you’ll want to leave behind—that you are alive.
that you are very sensitive to all kinds o-f stimuli.
There is some scientiﬁc evidence tending to show
that top executives or top scientists are rarely
one track minders. True, they are usually very
proﬁcient in some one or two ﬁelds; but there are
many people who are. In addition the top execu-
tive, the industrial president, vice president, plant
manager. the director o-f research and develop-
ment is the engineer who can also enjoy a sym-
phony, the chemist who understands a painting,
the accountant who writes poetry and who enjoys
reading Shakespeare. I have yet to meet an im-
portant executive who can’t more than hold his
own in a discussion of geography, politics, litera-
ture or football. Top executives are whole men;
they are interested in many things, sometimes it
seems in everything. They probably paid more
attention than you to their courses in History,
Business Law. Economics. and English for En-
gineers. Almost any company you choose will hire
you quickly if you can show that you are one of
those rare connoisseurs who isn’t just existing,
but whose every muscle, tendon, and sense is
tuned to the thousands of stimuli; scientiﬁc, artis-
tic philosophical that may escape you every day.
I can’t tell you how to demonstrate this quality
during an interview if you don’t have it; but if
you do have it. you know it.

Unfortunately, whether or not you accept some
of these hints, you will probably receive several
offers of employment. I say “unfortunately” be-

A new method greatly speeds concrete building.

BY WILLIAM J. ZEHALA. C.E. '53

Tilt-up construction _is a special form of pre-
cast concrete construction. It is considered a rel-

‘ atively new development, since most construction

of this type has taken place in’ the past ﬁve years.
Since. construction is limited to walls cast on the
S1‘l'.€.1l1 a horizontal position and tilted to the
vertical position, it has derived the name “tilt-
up” construction.

Most buildings constructed by the tilt-up
method are one story in height although there are
some up to eight stories. The multistory build-
ings have generally been constructed by tilting
the walls for one story, placing the ﬂoor above.
and then repeating the process. In some instances.
walls two stories in height have been cast and
tilted as a unit.

_ Concrete walls in the tilt-up method are cast
in a horizontal position, therefore, a suitable cast-
ing surface must be provided. Some of the most
suitable surfaces are earth, which should be fair-

ly smooth and compact ﬂoor slabs of the struc-
ture or auxiliary concrete area. which is not so
economical, and plywood sheeting uniformly sup-
ported.

Earth is an economical and practical casting
platform. However, weeds and organic matter
must be removed as well as top irregularities and
dust. Earth is most suitable and economical only
when the wall slab will be covered by backﬁll.

The most ideal casting surface is the ﬂoor slab
of the structure itself when it is level and trow-
eled smooth. Whenvthere is insufficient room on

the floor slab to cast all the units and erect them

in proper sequence, an auxiliary casting platform
is necessary. When the ﬂoor slab itself is being
used as a casting platform, special attention must
be given to its construction since it must support
heavy", concentrated loads due to motorized cranes
used in tilting up the wall slabs. The primary
essential is to properly consolidate and insure a
compact subgrade. It is necessary to provide an
adequate thickness of ﬂoor slab usually at.least
six inches. High strength concrete is used with or
without steel reinforcing, depending mostly on
use after erection of the wall slabs. Usually 3000
p.s.i. ‘concrete is preferred. Since the concrete
is placed rather dry it should be vibrated to in-
sure uniformity.

An alternate method used when sufficient space
is not available is plywood platforms. In this case,
no bond-breaking agent is needed but since ply-
wood bends under heavy loading. such as con-
crete, it is important to evenly support the mold.

The picture below shows the horizontal wall
slab ready for concrete. The edge forms have been
placed on the concrete ﬂoor slab and bond pre-
vention material was sprayed on the floor slab
to prevent adhesion of the horizontal wall slabs
being formed on the concrete ﬂoor.

An important item in tilt-up construction is
the bond-breaking agent. It is used only when
the concrete floor slab of the structure is used
as a casting platform. The agent prevents the
adhesion of the wall slab to the concrete ﬂoor

slab and allows the wall to be easily tilted into
a vertical position.

Bond preventive materials may be divided into
two general groups —— sheet materials and liquids.
The liquids are by far the more generally used.
The sheet materials consist of paper, felt, can-
vas. metal and rubber or plastic sheeting. Paper
and felt prevent bond, but they are not used
where contact surface of the panel is to be left
exposed or simply painted. Wrinkles invariably
occur in the paper and disﬁgure the contact sur-
face of the panel. Paper an-d felt also usually
stick to the panel and in some cases are difficult
to remove. Canvas has been successful and gives
a very pleasing texture when properly treated.
The canvas should be dusted with cement or
sprinkled with water just prior to placing the
concrete. Metal and rubber or plastic sheeting.
when oiled or otherwise properly treated. are ef-
fective in preventing bond and may be re-used
many times.

The liquid categories of bond-preventive agents
are quite numerous. but Mr. F. Thomas Collins
recommends “Hunt’s process solution Bx 112 TU
Techkote tilt-up compound”. It is the most econ-
omical and widely used. Other liquids are oil,
grease, lard, stearic acid. castor oil, fuel oil. liquid

soap. and concrete curing compounds.

Some general rules apply to the use of all liq-
uids for bond-prevention. A sufficient quantity
must be applied to seal the ﬂoor surface and pre-
vent bond with the wall panel. A considerable
excess should be avoided as it tends to discolor
the wall panel. The material should be applied in
two or more coats. The ﬁrst coat or coats should
seal the floor surface completely and leave no
dry spots. The ﬁnal coat should be applied only
a relatively short time before the concrete is
placed so that material and workmen will not
scratch or scuff the ﬁnal ﬁlm. Marks and foot-
prints on this film may show -on the finished
panel. The material may be applied with a swab,
brush or spray. The liquid must be kept off re-
inforcement so that bond between the concrete
and reinforcement will not be reduced.

E.dge _forms must be sufficiently stiff and well
braced to remain in good alignment. This is re-
quired since the walls must be plumb when tilt-
ed to the vertical positi-on. Forms for the sides
of panels are usually made of two inch lumber.
but in a few cases steel angles or channels have
been used. Edge forms for the sides must have
holes for the dowels which extend into the col-
umns. The holes should be 14 inch larger than
the dowels to permit easy stripping. Sometimes
the forms are split on the line of these holes to
make removal easier. If this is the case, lumber
is deﬁnitely more suitable and economical.

Much care must‘ be taken in tilting the wall
slabs into their vertical position. To prevent the
slabs from cracking, the three point method of
pick-up is used most extensively. The photograph
shows the three point method of pick-up in use.

The Three Point Method of Pickup

Notice that the point of application is not the
top of the wall but part way d-own the panel.
This is practiced since the moment at the upper
end, caused by lowering the point of application,
tends to balance the moment at the lower end.
thus. reduces the stresses and prevents crack-
ing. At the points of application. eyebolts are
used as pick-up inserts. T-hese consist of sleeves
welded to the reinforcing into which the eye-
bolts are screwed. This method permits easy re-
moval of the eyebolt from hardened concrete.

BY PHILIP DI BARTOLA, A.E. ’53

We are all aware of the rapid advancement of
aviation in the past few years. The invention and
development of the jet engine, the first radical
change in means of propulsion for aircraft, is re-
sponsible for the tremendous speeds of today’s
aircraft. This great invention. as well as giving
man the power to ﬂy faster than the speed of
sound, has also confronted him with many baf-
ﬂing problems. If man is to propel himself
through the atmosphere at speeds of some 1000
miles per hour, he must better understand the
ﬂow of air at thse velocities.

Means of studying air ﬂo-w at subsonic speeds,
as compared to those at supersonic speeds. are
easily constructed. A supersonic wind tunnel re-
quires a tremendous amount of power Let the
following be an example of the power needed
to push air through a tunnel. The wind tunnel at
the NACA (National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics) laboratories in Cleveland can only
be run at night. The power requirement is so
great that there is not enough for both the NACA
tunnel and the city of Cleveland when its many
industries are in full production. Because of this
great need for electrical power, most of to-day’s

supersonic wind tunnels are small.

There is. at present, one method of studying
supersonic conditions without the great expense
of high speed wind tunnels. This method makes
use of the shock tube. At present the Aeronauti-
cal Engineering Department at the University of
Pittsburgh is in the process of building a shock
tube. The purpose of this shock tube is to allow
future students to study the little known prin-
ciples of supersonic air ﬂow.

A shock tube is essentially a rectangular tube
or channel some twenty feet long. eight inches
high. and two inches wide. The tube is separated
into two main compartments by a membrane
called the diaphragm. One chamber is evacuated
with a vacuum pump. The diaphragm is then
punctured. allowing the air to rush into the pre-
viously evacuated chamber. The air rushing into
the vacuum chamber will move faster than the
speed of sound. providing a means of studying
supersonic air ﬂow with a very small power re-
quirement.

The building of this shock tube has been brok-
en down into various parts and assigned to dif-
ferent students as thesis projects. The following
paragraphs will explain the principles of, and
describe the operation of, the sha.dowgraph me-
chanism for this future shock tube.

The shadowgraph mechanism, in this case,
is a means of photographing the invisible shock
waves. A shock wave may be deﬁned as a bound-
ary layer between a high and low pressure area.
It is an imaginary line. The shock tube will pro-
duce shock waves due to the rapid expansion of
the air into the vacuum chamber. The purpose

of the shadowgraph mechanism is to make a
pictorial representation of the shock conditions
in the tube at the time of ﬁring.

Since a shock wave is invisible; a shadow-
graph is more than just a photograph. Parallel
light rays from a point source of light are pass-
ed through the test section of the shock tube
at the exact time the shock wave appears. Since
the rays are parallel. if nothing were in the
shock tube, they would evenly darken a sheet
of photographic ﬁlm placed in their path on the
other side of the test section. Now consider
the shock wave between the light rays and the
ﬁlm. As explained before, a shock wave is an
imaginary line between a high and a low press-
ure area. From physics it is known that light
rays passing through any substance are de-
ﬂected according to the density of the substance.
The degree to which a substance will deﬂect
rays is termed its index of refraction. The old
story of seeing‘ a ﬁsh in the water where he
_isn’t is explained by this principle. The water
is more dense than the air through which we
normally see things. Therefore. the light rays
coming to us from the ﬁsh under water are
deﬂected more than if the ﬁsh were out of water.
Consequently the ﬁsh appears to be in a different
position that where it actually is. To get back
to the shock wave, the light passing through the
high pressure side of the shock wave is de-
flected more than the light passing through
the low pressure side. This deﬂection is because
the higher the pressure, the higher the density
of the air. Consequently the ﬁlm will be dark-
ened more in some regions than others. This
line between the darkened area and the less dark-
ened area is therefore the “shadow” of the shock
wave.

Shock Waves

The shadowgraph is made up of three main
parts: the point source of light. the lens, and
the ﬁlm. The point source of light is the heart
of the shadowgraph mechanism. To take a pic-
ture of something moving fast it is necessary
to “stop” the movement. To take a picture o-f a
fast moving auto we use a fast camera and a
short exposure time. To “stop” the movement
of an airplane propeller we use a stroboscopic

- light. Both of these are to “slow” to “stop” air

moving at the speed of sound. It was decided
to use a high voltage spark as a point source
of light. The duration of a spark of this na-
ture at some 5000 volts is approximately 0.2

microseconds. In order to get this high volt-
age it was necessary to build an original power
supply unit. An electrical diagram of the power
supply unit is given in Figure 1. Two 2X2 tubes
are used to double and rectify the output of a
2400 volt transformer. Two 2.5 volt ﬁliment
transformers are used to heat the ﬁliment of
the tubes. A thermal delay tube is used to allow
the 2X2 tubes to warm up before the 2400 volt
transformer is turned on. This delay tube was
found necessary after failure of the unit was
found to occur by impressing the 2400 volts
on the plates of the 2X2 tubes before allowing
them to warm up. This high voltage is then used
to charge two 0.9 micro-farad capacitors. This
charge in turn charges a 0.1 micro-farad capaci-
tor through a 3.9 megohm current limiting re-
sistance. A 10 megohm resistor is placed across
the 0.1 micro-farad capacitor as a “bleeder” to
allow the charge to “leak off” when it is not need-
ed. This charge, when discharged across an air
gap. is the point source of light. A triggering
mechanism is necessary in order to ﬁre the spark
at exactly the right time. The triggering me-
chanism devised operates the same as a spark
plug in an automobile. The ﬁring of the trigger
spark “breaks down” the air gap. This makes
is possible for the main spark to ﬁre and take
the picture.

When this point source of light is placed at
the focal point of a lens. the light rays emitted
from the lens will be parallel. This is a law of
optics and can be found in any physics textbook.
These parallel rays are directed through the
test section of the shock tube. The rays are then
deﬂected according to pressure differences around

29

the shock wave. Finally after passing through
the test section the rays fall on the ﬁlm to form
the shadowgraph. A f2.5 lens of 3 inches in di-
ameter was used. The ﬁlm used was Kodak
Super XX.

The essential parts of the shadowgraph me-
chanism were completed on December 3. The
shock tube not being completed as yet. it was
decided to make a preliminary test of the shadow-
graph mechanism itself. An attempt was made
to take a shadowgraph of a heated soldering iron.
It was thought that the pressure differences caus-
ed by the expanding hot air around the iron
might be. although small, strong enough to be
shadowgraphed. The results of this test were
unsatisfactory. There were no pressure grad-
ients visible. On December 4, the shadowgraph
mchanism was taken to room 3, Thaw Hall.
It was decided to use the Ingersoll Rand air
compressor in the laboratory as a source of high
pressure. The maximum pressure the compress-
or can deliver is 250 psi (pounds per square inch).
Air at this pressure when expanded through a
converging nozzle would be sure to produce su-
personic air flow. T-he strength of a shock wave
is deﬁned as the pressure ratio across it. Hence.
if air at 250 psi were expanded to atmospheric
pressure (14.7 psi). the strength of the shock
wave produced would be approximately 16. This
ﬁgure is inaccurate because of losses due to
friction and turbulence in the piping making
it impossible to have 250 psi at the exit. Never-
theless. a pressure ratio much less than 16 would
be sufficient to produce shock waves. If the
vacuum chamber in the shock tube would be at

1.0_psi. which is a fair vacuum. the pressure
ratio would be approximately 15. This ﬁgure
comes from the_ dividing the pressure in the
high pressure side of the tube (atmospheric)
by 1.0 psi.

. The test had to be run at night because a light
tight case for the mechanism has yet to be built.
The discharge valve on the compressor storage
tank was opened the whole way. This allowed
the air to rush out the nozzle. The ﬁlm was then
exposed by_ closing the switch on the trigger-
ing mechanism. This in turn ﬁred the main spark
gap, supplying the point source of light. The
parallel light rays passing through the area
around the nozzle were deﬂected according to
the pressure gradients and fell on the ﬁlm. This
preliminary test was a success. After develop-
ing the ﬁlm in DX 19 developer for 15 minutes,
it was evident that the ﬁrst supersonic shock
waves at the University of Pittsburgh had been
made. The prints on the following pages are
the results of that night’s work.

_ The completion of the shock tube will make
it possible to take much better shadowgraphs.
Supersonic air ﬂow in the absence of turbulence
due to piping and rough surfaces will give bet-
ter results. Also the ﬂow in the tube will be two-
dimensional (ﬂow in the horizontal and Vertical
planes but none in the transverse plane) which
will give clearer shadowgraphs. When the shock
tube is completed there will be an opportunity
for students in Aeronautical Engineering to learn
something about supersonic air ﬂow besides that
which is found in the textbooks.

Further proof of this leadership is the
new RCA “Deep Image” picture tube with

its micro-sharp electron beam and superfine
phosphor screen which ensures the finest
picture quality. It is also seen in reception
at a distance—as well as in automatic tuning
of all channels, both VHF and UHF.

Today’s RCA Victor receivers result
from the same research and engineering

It took a lot of engineering to
make a better “grasshopper”

Engineers at Western Electric’s St. Paul Shops
are well pleased with their new-style “grass-
hopper” fuse—a small fuse used in Bell tele-
phone central ofﬁce equipment. The former
model—in production for years—had been
gradually reﬁned ’til it seemed almost beyond
further improvement. It was simple, inexpen-
sive, efﬁcient, came off the line fast. But . . .

It's an old Western Electric engineering custom
to keep trying to make Bell telephone equip-
ment still better, at still lower cost. The “grass-
hopper” was studied by a young engineer out
of the University of Minnesota, Class of ’40,
who joined the Company in 1946. His studies
indicated the most effective way to improve
efficiency and cut costs further was to change
the design.

Pursuing this lead the engineer and his group
saw their opportunity to make an important
contribution. They investigated the latest tool-
ing techniques, new metals, ﬁnishing materials
and methods, all of which are constantly under
study by engineers at Western Electric plants.
A simpliﬁed design, which permitted the use of
the most modern tooling methods, resulted in a
better fuse at lower cost that is saving thou-
sands of dollars a year for Bell telephone
companies.

There's an endless stream of such challenging as-
signments at Western Electric. Engineers of
varied skills—mechanical, electrical, civil, chem-
ical, metallurgical—ﬁnd real satisfaction in
working together on the important job of pro-
viding equipment for the best telephone service
on earth.

How the grasshopper
fuse Works

Small fuses like this are used by the millions
to protect certain telephone central oﬂ"1ce cir-
cuits against current overloads. Odd in appear-
ance, the fuse is called the “grasshopper” be-
cause of its spring which is released when the
fuse blows, displaying an indicator “ﬂag” in
open View and tripping an alarm so the trouble
can be spotted and corrected at once.

to-rque characteristics for constant-torque multi-
speed squirrel-ca_ge motors are shown in Fig. 3b.
Pole-combination limitations are identical to those
of the variable-torque multispeed motor, as is the

relative spacing of the available operating speeds.

as compared to the wo-und-rotor motor.

Another common application for wound-rotor
motors is that requiring smooth acceleration com-
bined with high torque. This application is exem-
pliﬁed by the large overhead crane. Both the
hoisting and trolley movements are properly pow-
ered by wound-rotor motors, taking advantage -of
the low starting torque (see Fig. 2b) with_ maxi-
mum external rotor resistance, then changing the
external rotor resistance to successively lower
amounts for increasing the speed and torque out-
put of the motor until the desired rate of hoisting
or trolley motion is attained. Wound-rotor motors
in hoist service are usually employed only in the
larger cab-operated cranes that lift heavy loads,
where a severe jolt at starting could be hazardous
to personnel or equipment, and where a choice of
hoisting speeds is desirable or necessary.

For smaller cranes operated from the ﬂoor and
having only the hoisting movement powered, and
where hoisting at only full speed is acceptable.
high-slip squirrel-cage motors are almost univer-
sally used, since any jolting at start is of less con-
sequence with the lighter loads.

_Inserting resistance in the primary circuit of a
high-slip squirrel-cage motor produces a family of
speed-torque curves as shown in Fig. 5. These
speed-torque characteristics are reasonably equiv-
alent to those of the wound-roto-r motor of Fig. 2.
While it would provide the smooth acceleration
required for larger cranes, the squirrel-cage
motor would overheat if slow-speed operation
were long continued.

F’or certain applications the characteristics of
the wound-rotor induction motor make it the pre-

34

ferred drive. For example, take a cable-reeling
machine. Cable is wound on a reel driven by a
suitable constant-speed motor. Consequently the
linear speed at which the cable moves increases
as the reel ﬁlls up. The cable must be kept under
slight tension as it is wound to prevent crossing
or tanglin_g on the reel. Further, while the amount.
of tension need not be perfectly constant. it
should remain fairly uniform in value to prevent
too much stretch or too much slack. To accom-
plish this, the cable is controlled from an auxili-
ary drum connected to the shaft of a wound-rotor

Cage Motor with Varying External Resistance

motor having very high external rotor resistance.
such that its speed-torque characteristics are
similar to, say, the lowest curve on Fig. 2. The
speed at which the wound rotor motor runs de-
pends on the linear speed of the cable, and even if
this were to vary as much as two to one, the ten-
sion applied to the cable by the wound-rotor
motor would be satisfactorily constant. Thus the
steep slope of this speed-torque curve, which
causes undesirable instability in some applica-
tions, becomes an asset. ,

In applications requiring development of tor-
que at zero speed for any appreciable length of
time, the wound-rotor motor can be used, al-
though locked operation is not too desirable for
any motor because of the large losses of heat
present under locked conditions. The wound-rotor
motor is superior to the squirrel-cage for these
applications for two reasons: ﬁrst. the major por-
tion of the rotor loss is dissipated in the external
resistors with-out producing heat in the motor
proper; second, extremely high rotor resistance
gives minimum stator loss for a given locked
torque

Where capacity of the power supply is limited,
the wound-rotor motor can be used for applica-
tions normally assigned to squirrel-cage motors.
because it has the lowest starting current for a
given starting torque of any induction motor.

Because their characteristics are somewhat
similar, the choice between squirrel-cage and
wound-rotor motors should be made carefully.
Each has its own ﬁeld.

A Bearing Theory
with a bearing on
your job future

The futuristic-looking object in the picture above is a
demonstration model of Maxwell’s distortion energy
theory concerning the yielding of ductile materials.

And it’s used by our General Motors research
engineers in their study of “bearing fatigue.”

From this study they have succeeded in discover-
ing new facts about the “thick and thin” of bearing
surface metals—and thus added to wearing qualities of
journal and engine bearings.

We publish it here to point up a fact that should
not be overlooked by the engineering student with a
bent for research.

That fact is the wealth of opportunity for the
research-minded engineer to function creatively at
General Motors.

Yet research engineering is only one of the oppor-
tunities at General Motors for the graduate engineer.

For GM is not only a leading producer of motor-

cars and trucks. It also manufactures many other types
of civilian goods from heating and air conditioning
systems to refrigerators, from fractional h.p. motors
to Diesel locomotives.

And, as a top defense contractor, GM builds every-
thing from rockets and range ﬁnders to jet and Turbo-
Prop airplane engines.

So there’s plenty to work on at GM. And plenty
of engineering brains to work with.

Our many graduate engineers in top management
prove that the engineer with the ability to make real
use of what GM has to offer can build himself a very
satisfying future in the GM family.

GLEN G. GRAY

Glen G. Gray, senior development
engineer of the Eastman -Kodak
Company, is one person who will
never forget the ﬁrst few days Of
February, 1943. For him this period
is memorable for several reasons.
On February 1, he was graduated
from the University of Pittsburgh,
with the degree of Bachelor of
Science in Chemical Engineering-
February 5, 1943 was also an event-
ful day in his life, for it was the date
of his marriage to Mary Jane Cook,
a Penn State Coed. February 8 saw
the beginning of his career at East-
man-Kodak in Rochester, N. Y.,
where he began by studying paper
mill problems.

Glen says that he found his work
intriguing right from the start. As
one of a staff of six in those days,
he was soon deep in the chemistry of
sizing photographic p-aper. Glen's
technical ability and agreeable per-
sonality were soon noted by the com-
pany and he advanced rapidly and
steadily in his chosen ﬁeld. Ten short
years later, Glen became leader of a
special projects group devoted to the
improvement of the quality of photo-
graphic paper. The paper service
division also has grown, and now has
a staff which numbers 70 persons.

During his ﬁrst 15 months at East-
man—Kodak, Glen worked on a vari-
ety of paper mill problems. He then
transferred to Oak Ridge, Tennes-
see, where, after a period of train-
ing, he became assistant technical
supervisor of a production plant in

38

the electro-magnetic process division
operated by Eastman-Kodak in con-
nection with the nation’s atomic
energy program.

Eighteen months later, he returned
to Rochester, N. Y. and rejoined the
staff of the paper service division.
Upon his return, he went to work on
various problems, including the
chemical staining of photo paper.

During 1947 he was promoted to
group leader in charge of the coat-
ing group, paper service division.
Under his direction, this group
worked on the development of spec-
ial paper coating techniques and on
the design and construction of ex-
p-erimental coating machines. Three
years later, he took charge of a
special products group which was
concerned with paper quality devel-
opment and the design and develop-
ment of new instrumentation for
testing paper.

Glen, Mary Jane, and daughter
Carol Jean are now happily settled
in the new home they purchased in
1949. There, in a basement wood-
working shop, Glen indulges his
hobby of turning out furniture and
ﬁttings for his home.

Though his family, job and hobby
have kept him busy, Glen has found
time to broaden his education. East-
man-Kodak has made this easy, by
sponsoring courses such as statistics
and photographic science.

Glen was graduated cum laude
from the University of Pittsburgh,
and was elected to three honorary
fraternities, Sigma Tau, engineering,
Phi Lambda Upsilon, chemistry, and
Phi Theta Kappa, the junior hon-
orary. Previous to entering Pitt, he
studied at Johnstown Center.

JOHN N. TROXELL

John N. Troxell has been promoted
to General Manager of the Produc-
ing Department of The Texas Com-
pany effective January 1, 1953, suc-
ceeding E. R. Filley, who has been
moved up to Vice President of the
company’s Domestic Production 013-
erations.

Mr. Troxell, the son of Laura S.
and Joseph N. Troxell, was born in
Ridgeway, Pennsylvania. He attend-
ed grade and high schools in Ridge-
way, and, following his ﬁrst year at
the University of Pittsburgh, he en-
listed in the army and served in
France and England with the 116th
Engineers, 41st Division. He then
returned to Pitt and was graduated

in 1922 with the degree of Petroleum
Engineer.

On August 12, 1922 he entered he
employ of The Texas Company at
Tulsa, Oklahoma, as a junior geolo-
gist, and he served as a geologist in
the Oklahoma Division until July 1,
1932, when he was transferred to the
Geological Department of the South
Texas Division in Houston. In Feb-
ruary, 1934, he returned to Tulsa as
Division Geologist. He remained
there in that cap-acity until July 1,
1938, when he was transferred to
Houston as Geologist on the staff of
the Manager of the Producing De-
partment.

On September 1, 1943, Mr. Troxell
was made Department Geologist for
the Producing Department, Domes-
tic; Assistant Manager-Departmental
Geologist on April 1, 1947; and
Assistant General Manager on Feb-
ruary 1, 1952, with headquarters in
Houston, Texas.

He is a member of Delta Tau

nity; Geological Society of America;
American Association of Petroleum
Geologists; Houston Geological So-
ciety; American Petroleum Institute;

Mr. Troxell was married in 1923
to Miss Janice Kimball of Tulsa,
Oklahoma. They have three children,
Helen, John, Jr. and Richard. Mr.
Troxell’s hobbies are ﬁshing, hunt-
mg. and bowling, and he is an ar-
dent baseball and football fan.

A Second Method of Picking the Slabs Up

The three point pick-up method is applicable es-
pecially for very high walls.

Here another pick-up method is shown. This
hand operated tilting mast is simple and is very
good for small panels. It consists of a short 6” x
6” angle used for attaching the equipment to
the panel. This method does little to distribute
the pick-up stresses indicating that any method
of direct attachment to the top edge is satisfac-
tory with small panels. A slight modiﬁcation for
wider lateral distribution of pick-up load would
be advantageous.

Even though tilt-up construction is relatively
new, “package erection services” do exist. Their
existance is most predominant in California and
other western states wherethis type of construc-
tion is being used more extensively. If the method
of erection is standardized for each area, there
is no reason why “packaged erection” cannot be
used most economically.

Tilt-up is adaptable to a wide range of uses
and architectural effects. It has been used for
many types of structures from private homes and
garages to multistory office buildings, although,
by far its greatest use has been for one story
industrial and commercial buildings. One of the
great advantages of precast concrete slab con-
struction is the great savings in forming labor
and material compared to cast-in-place concrete.
It is evident that success in tilt-up construction
depends directly on thorough planning and ef-
ﬁc'ient use of erection equipment. The ability to
improvise and develop new methods to improve
the quality of work is important not only to this,
but to all ﬁelds of construction.

gral part of our national life that young
graduates can enter it with full expec-
tation of a rewarding, long—term career.
Boeing, for instance, is now in its 36th
year of operation, and today employs
more engineers than at the peak of
World War II.

Boeing engineering activity is concen-
trated at Seattle in the Paciﬁc Northwest
and Wichita in the Midwest. Both com-
munities ofter ﬁne ﬁshing, hunting, golf,
’boatino and other recreational opportu-

o
nities. Both are fresh, modern cities with

fine residential and shopping districts,
and schools of higher learning where en-
gineers can study for advanced degrees.

There are openings in ALL branches
of engineering (mechanical, civil, electri-
cal, aeronautical and related fields) for
work in aircraft DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT,
PRODUCTION, RESEARCH and TOOLING. Also
for servo—mechanism and electronics de-
signers and analysts, and physicists and
mathematicians with advanced degrees.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

   
  

“ ’v1~: ALWAYS been interested in the basic

problems of engineering. But when I
got out of school, I needed additional
courses to do the things that interested me.
More mathematics—more mechanics were
required. Since joining Allis-Chalmers,
these gaps have been ﬁlled.”

Variety of Experience

“I became interested in the Allis-Chalmers
Graduate Training Course during a plant
tour in my Senior year. As I watched men
building steam turbines, electric motors,
transformers, pumps, rotary kilns, crush-
ers, and many other products, I was im-
pressed by the variety of experiences to be
obtained at A-C. It looked to me like a
cross-section of heavy industry. When I
found that GTC students choose the de-
partments they work in, as well as the type
of work, I decided to join Allis-Chalmers.

“As a GTC student, I was given every
opportunity to work in many departments.
However, the basic problems involving
aerodynamics, mechanics and elasticity
appealed to me and I chose to work pri-

Aided by Experts

“Since joining A-C, I have had the oppor-
tunity to work with the company’s leading
consultants, and was encouraged to attend
evening courses at the University of Wis-
consin, in Milwaukee, which led to a
Master’s degree.

“In 1949 the company awarded me a
graduate fellowship for 12 months’ resi-
dence study at the University of Wisconsin
and I got my Doctor’s degree in Mechanics.

“So you see, whether you want to do basic
engineering or be a sales engineer, de-
signer, production or research engineer,
Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training Course
oﬁfers a wonderful opportunity.”

New Ideas
To Keep America Strong in the Air

Aviation progress requires new ideas—and plenty of them. And that’s why North
American always has career opportunities for young engineers who do fresh
thinking. North American is a company that thinks in terms of the future. That’s
why it has been an industry leader for 24 years, designing and developing the
leading planes of World War II, the B-25 Mitchell and F-51 Mustang, and
America’s present day front—line ﬁghters, the F-86 Sabre Jets. Today, North
American is pioneering in many new ﬁelds——guided missile, jet, rocket, electronics,
atomic energy—thinking ahead to keep America strong in the air.

When you are prepared to enter the engineering profession, consider the career
opportunities at North American. In the meantime, feel free to write for any infor-

What's Happening at CRIICIBLE

about clicker die steel

what it is

Clicker die steel is a special cold rolled alloy steel. It is used
in making clicker dies for cutting leather, rubber, plastic,
felt and fabrics of other compositions that

go into the making of shoes
and similar products.

Some of the clicker die steel standard

 
 
 

Wider shapes are used when dies are
sized by surface grinding after form-
 ing and welding. Standard widths are
 provided when the dies are not to be
' surface ground.

how it is used

Clicker die steel is furnished to the die maker in either
single or double edged form in one of several standard
shapes. The die maker first shapes the die by bending
the die steel to a pattern that provides the desired con-
ﬁguration, and then welds the two ends at a corner. He
ﬁnishes the die by grinding a bevel ‘on the outside of the
cutting edge and ﬁling the inside edge. Before the ﬁn-
ished die is hardened and tempered, the die maker
forms identiﬁcation marks — combinations of circles
and squares — in the cutting edge so that the material
cut from it may be easily identiﬁed as to its size and
style.

In the cutting operation, the leather or other material
is placed on an oak block in the bed of the clicker
machine. Then the die is placed by hand on the material
which is cut as the aluminum faced head of the machine
presses the die through it. The clicking sound which
the head makes as it strikes the die is where the term
“clicker machine” derived its name.

what it is composed of

Clicker die steel as produced by the Crucible Steel
Company of America is a controlled electric steel in
which the combination of carbon and alloy is designed

for maximum toughness and proper hardness after heat
treatment.

Experience has proved that cold ﬁnished clicker die
steel _is superior to hot rolled material for sizes ap-
proximately 3/, inch and narrower because of its lower
degree of surface decarburization which permits the
use of slightly thinner sections. Cold ﬁnished material
also has a better surface ﬁnish with closer width and
thickness tolerances and thinner edges that require
less grinding and ﬁling to complete the die.

i.'Hlll.'lBLE’S engineering service

As with clicker die steel, the Crucible Steel Company of
America is the leading producer of special purpose
steels. If yoh have a problem in specialty steels, our staff
of ﬁeld metallurgists with over 50 years experience in
ﬁne steel making is available to help you solve it.

Advanced Production Techniques and
Experience—l50 Years of lt—Are Doing
Big Things with Pressure Vessels

Although established in 1802, Scaife Company never has
allowed itself to "grow old.” A unique combination of
engineering skill, production experience and modern
equipment-coupled with Scaife’s intensive research pro-
gram—-has resulted in many signiﬁcant accomplishments
in the manufacture of pressure vessels for air, gases and
liquids. For example, one of the most interesting methods
of cold-forming metal in use in this country today is the
Scaife Reverse-Draw Process, a revolutionary method of
forming deep-drawn shapes.

We invite engineers to contact our Personnel Director
for information about the opportunities with the
Scaife Company.

The Scaife Reverse-Draw Process

Shown above are some of the deep-drawn
shapes that may be made by the Scaife
process, and the press employed for the
pressing operation. This is how it is done:

Starting with a circular

MY QUESTION TO THE G-E STUDENT INFORMATION PANEL:

“How does your business training
program prepare a college graduate

for a career in General Electric?”

...CHARLES O. BILLINGS, Carnegie Institute of
Technology, 1954

The answer to this question, given at a student information meeting
held in July, i952, between G-E personnel and representative college
students, is printed below. lf you have a question you would like an-
swered, or seek further information about General Electric, mail your
request to College Editor, Dept. l23-2, General Electric Company,
Schenectady, New, York.

R. J. CANNING, Business
Training Course . . . General
Electric’s business training
program offers the college
graduate the opportunity to
build a career in the ﬁeld of
accounting, ﬁnance, and
business management in one
of the most diversiﬁed com-
panies in the country.

 

Since its beginning in 1919, more than 3,000 students
have entered the program—one of the ﬁrst training
programs inbusiness to be offered by industry.

The program’s principal objective is to develop men
well qualiﬁed in accounting and related business studies,
men who call become administrative leaders in the ﬁnan-
cial and general business activities of the Company.

Selection of men for the program is based on inter-
views, reviews of students’ records, and discussions with
placement directors and faculty members. Selection is
not limited solely to accounting and business administra-
tion majors. A large number of men in the program are
liberal arts graduates, engineers, and men with other
technical training.

_Whe11 a man enters the program he is assigned a full-
time office position iI1 accounting or other ﬁnancial work
and enrolled in the formal evening education program.
This plaiéned classroom work is a most important phase
of the p1'og‘i'am. The material presented is carefully se-
lected and well integrated for the development of an ade-
quate knowledge of accounting and business theory, pro-
cedures and policies followed by the Company, acceptable

 

accounting and business practices of the modern eco-
nomic enterprise, and as a supplement to the practical
experience provided by the job assignment.

In general, the program trainee is considered in train-
ing for three years during which time advancements are
made to more responsible types of accounting work. After
completing academic training the trainee’s progress and
interests are re-examined. If he has demonstrated an apti-
tude for ﬁnancial work he is considered for transfer to
the staff of traveling auditors or to an accounting and
ﬁnancial supervisory position. From here his advance-
ment opportunities lie in ﬁnancial administrative posi-
tions throughout the Company. Trainees showing an
interest and aptitude for work other than ﬁnancial, such
as sales, purchasing, community relations, publicity, etc.,
are at this time considered for placement in these ﬁelds.

Today, graduates of the program hold responsible posi-
tions throughout the entire organization. Management
positions in the accounting and ﬁnancial ﬁeld throughout
the Company, such as Comptroller, Treasurer, ﬁnance
managers, secretaries, and others, are held in large part
by graduates of the course. Men who have transferred to
other ﬁelds after experience in ﬁnancial work include
public relations executives, managers of operating divi-
sions and departments, presidents of affiliated Companies,
officials in personnel, employee relations and production
divisions, and executives in many other Company
activities.

This partial list of positions now ﬁlled by former busi-
ness training men is indicative of the career preparation
offered by the business training program, and of the
opportunities that exist for qualiﬁed men interested in
beginning their careers in accounting and ﬁnancial work.
