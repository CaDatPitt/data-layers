THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE


OPERATIONAL


PHILOSOPHY


                 IN MODERN PHYSICS



Many of the concepts of physics which were erroneous or
     unexplainable due to lack of a counterpart in experience have been
         explained and clarified by the operational philosophy.


                                                             By WALTER        MRUK


  Modern physics begins about 1900. Before
that year Newton's Principia had so satisfac-
torily considered  dynamical situations   that
further development along these lines seemed im-
possible. In fact, what we have come to consider
as classical physics is built upon the structure
set up by Newton.
  At the beginning of the century, however, dif-
ficulties arose in trying to develop a suitable
model to describe atomic systems with classical
physics. To add to these difficulties, the prob-
lem of adequately describing (mathematically)
X-rays, radioactivity, blackbody radiation, the
photoelectric effect, and the specific heat of solids
led to conclusions which were not only ambiguous,
but also completely without a counterpart in ex-
perience. For example, the classical equations
describing the radiation of heat energy from a
body at a given temperature held for the long
wave components of the radiation and agreed
rather well with experiment. On the other hand,
for the short-wave components of radiation, the
classical equations failed entirely. Whereas ex-
perience shows that the intensity of the radiation
reaches a maximum value at a definite wave
length (or frequency) and then decreases, the
classical equations claim that the radiation in-
tensity not only fails to reach a maximum but
also increases indefinately as the frequency in-
creases, going, in fact, as the square of the fre-
quency.
  Numerous other such catastrophes added to the
haze enveloping the physics frontier. Such para-
doxes as the Michelson-Morley experiment, which
was designed to detect a relative motion between
the ether and the earth, led to ad-hoc descriptions
-descriptions which were supplied to account
only for a given paradox. In due time, the need
for a revamping of the basic ideas and concepts
of physics became necessary, and demanded the
attention of the great physicists. One of the first
of these physicists was Max Planck. It was Planck
who first proposed (1900) the daring hypothesis


of the quantum theory when he was able to ex-
plain the black-body spectrum in terms of as-
sumed emission and absorbtion of elecgromagne-
tic radiation in discrete quanta. Each quantum
consisted of an amount of energy equal to a con-
stant (which is now appropriately called Planck's
constant) multiplied by the frequency of the ra-
diation in question. The quanta were supposed
to fly through space with the velocity of light
like a hail of shot. Particular conditions were
established under which a system could emit or
absorb the quanta and these conditions accounted
for the black-body radiation very well.
  Einstein in 1905 went even further than Planck.
Not only did he incorporate Planck's quantive
hypothesis, but also insisted that such properties
were inherent in the nature of radiation itself.
There exist a series of experiments which the
classical wave theory is scarcely capable of de-
scribing but which are readily intelligible from
the Einstein standpoint.   Perhaps the most
straightforward of these is the protoelectric ef-
fect, which states that when suitable radiation is
made to impinge upon a metal surface in a high
vacuum, the surface is observed to become posi-
tively charged. One way for the surface to be-
come so charged is by the emission of photoelec-
trons (or electrons). With suitable apparatus,
these electrons can be captured and will thereby
yield current. The velocity of the electrons can also
be measured appropriately . On classical grounds,
certain predictions were made concerning the
relation between the intensity and frequency of
the incident light source, the velocity of the
emerging electrons, and their number. Yet ex-
perience showed that these predictions were not
at all true. By means of the quantum theory,
however, all the classical shortcomings were re-
moved.
   Such astounding paradoxes and their quantum
 behavior made it necessary for the physicist to
 submit to closer scrutiny the basic concepts of his
                         (Continupd on page 28)

AN


EXPLOSIVE


BULLET


The limitations of low velocity revolver bullets have been success-
fully overcome by utilizing potential energy in the form of an ex-
               plosive charge in the nose of the bullet.

  Killing power of a bullet is dependent on three
things; kinetic energy, penetration, and expan-
sion. The kinetic energy of a bullet when it
reaches its target is a function of the mass of
the projectile and its velocity at that point, and
may be represented by the familiar formula;
   KE=I/2L UVt       Penetration of a bullet is
directly proportional to the weight and velocity
of the bullet and inversely proportional to the
effective resistance or density of the target body.
  Several factors are responsible for the expan-
sion of a bullet. First and most important is the
velocity with which the projectile strikes the
target. At high velocities the impact received
when entering the target body causes an expan-
sion or upsetting of the nose of the bullet which
is better known among ballisticians as mushroom-
ing. Another important factor which contributes
to the mushrooming of a bullet is the centrifugal
force acting on the periphery of the projectile.
This centrifugal force is produced by the rotation
of the bullet, the rotation being received by the
rifling of the gun barrel, and causes expansion to
proceed in a radial direction. It is interesting to
note that the speed of rotation is also governed
by the velocity of the bullet as it passes through
the bore. For argument's sake, assuming a con-
stant bullet weight, killing power is primarily
determined by bullet velocity.
  In rifles today, velocities above 4,000 feet per
second are not unusual, but because of their in-
herent design revolvers are limited as to these
ultra-high bullet velocities. This natural handi-
cap typical of revolvers impairs their ability to
equal rifles in terms of killing power. However,


special bullets such as hollow points, when used
in revolvers greatly increase their killing power
and wound producing ability. Unfortunately,
unless these bullets are driven at very high velo-
cities, they are incapable of expanding or mush-
rooming properly. At this point it may be well to
define high velocities with respect to revolvers.
With the exception of the .357 Magnam cartridge
and revolver it is difficult and dangerous to pro-
duce bullet velocities in excess of 1,000 feet per
second in revolvers.
  Realizing these limitations, the author has en-
deavored to design a revolver bullet which will
perform efficiently and destructively at velocities
as low as 800 feet per second.
  For a bullet to expand properly at these low
velocities something other than an ordinary hol-
low-point bullet is desired. By adding the lack-
ing velocity energy in a form of potential energy
the desired mushrooming and expansion of the
bullet is obtained. This is accomplished by the
use of an explosive charge in the nose of the bul-
let. "What," you may ask, "an explosive bullet?"
Exactly. The idea is nothing new but when ap-
plied to a revolver bullet it produces amazing re-
sults. This type of explosive bullet is capable of
terrific expansion and can produce wound cava-
ties superior in many respects to those made with
some high power rifles!
  All bullets used in the development were hand
cast in a Keith hollow-point mold block using a
special plug desig aed to enlarge the hollow-point
cavity to the proper dimensions in order to receive
the explosive charge and its components. Bullets
were cast from an alloy of I part tin to 20 parts
lead and were sized to a diameter of .358 of an

inch and lubricated before charges were inserted.
The explosive charge itself consisted of three
separate components; a cap or primer, an anvil,
and the explosive powder charge.     Aluminum
tubing 5/32 of an inch in diameter was used as
the anvil to detonate the cap and formed the con-
tainer for the powder charge. The primer cap,
of the small percussion pistol type, was slipped
over one end of the anvil and the tube was then
filled with Hercules Bullseye powder. Powder
charge averaged 1.3 grains by weight. The as-
sembled unit was then pressed into the bullet
cavity until seated on the bottom of the cavity.
When properly seated, the cap was slightly lower
than the rim of the bullet nose. This raised rim
served as a safety precaution to prevent detona-
tion of the charge in case the finished cartridge
is accidentally dropped on its nose. The rim of
the bullet nose was then crimped in slightly by
bringing an ogive die down over the bullet. This
crimp holds the explosive components in firmly
and prevents their jarring loose from the recoil
when in the chambers of the revolver. After
these operations were completed, the bullet was
ready for loading in the cartridge case and that
procedure was the same as for any other bullet.
Figure 1 shows the bullet components and a cross
section of the finished bullet. The finished bullet
weighed 145 grains and propelling powder charges
were developed from standard loading tables
using this weight bullet.
   Since there was no way of knowing just how
rapid an acceleration the bullet could stand be-
fore exploding in the gun barrel, it was decided
to proceed with the utmost caution to prevent this
possible danger. Several cartridges were loaded
and fired in succession. Each successive bullet
was fired with an increase in velocity over the
previous ones. Bullet velocities were increased
from 100 feet per second to 950 feet per second
and slightly over. Two bullets were fired at each
separate velocity. The first ones contained only
the cap and anvil. The second contained cap,
anvil, and powder. These progressive tests were
all fired from behind the protection of a large
piece of 1/4 inch steel armor-plate, lest an ex-
ploding bullet wreck the gun. The handgun used
in the development and testing of the "OPX"
(Open Point Explosive) bullet was a standard
Smith and Wesson .38 Special military and police
revolver with a 6 inch barrel.

  In order to study the explosive effect, penetra-
tion, and wound cavities, each bullet was fired
into horizontally stacked newspapers. This facil-
itated easy recovery of each bullet as it was tested,
the target being located 5 yards from the firing
point. Tests showed that bullet impact was in-
sufficient to detonate the charges below velocities
of 500 feet per second. The most efficient ex-

By PROF. R.C. GORHAM


  Modern civilization finds it neces-
sary to regulate the practices of per-
sons whose activities deal with the
protection  of human     life, health,
rights and property. The professions
of medicine, law and engineering are
primarily intrusted with the respon-
sibility incident to such activities.
The elimination and exclusion, as
matters of public welfares, of the dis-
honest and unqualified from the prac-
tice of these professions are unde-
batable tenets.
  The first engineering registration
law was established for the District
of Columbia. During this time engin-
eering registration came to the United
States, laws have been enacted in
each state, and today every state,
territory, possession, and district of
the nation has a statute defining and
governing the practice of engineer-
ing. There are some 400,000 engin-
eers in the U. S. A., while some
160,000 are registered under these
laws. Certainly the time will soon
come when the entire profession will
be registered.
   While engineering registration laws
derive their primary justification from
considerations of public safety and the
protection of public interest, they are
also necessary for the protection of
the good name of the profession and
it's standing in public confidence.
Registration laws make it possible to
(1) stop the practice of engineering
by the unqualified; (2) stop the mis-
appropriation and abuse of the desig-
nation engineer; (3) oust from the
ranks of professional engineers those
who prove themselves to be unworthy
and incompetent; (4) preserve for the
worthy engineer his rights of prac-
tice against restriction, encroachment
and unqualified competion. A Penn-
sylvania court recently ruled that a
person holding himself out to be an
engineer, but not registered, has no
standing in a court of law attampting
to force payment for his services. The
court, in fact, ruled that the services
of the non-registrant had been illigal-
ly rendered contrary to the pihibiic
policy of the state as declared by 1f.i
legislature.
   The term "professional engineer"
 Within the meaning and intent of
 Pennsylvania Act No. 367, page 2 (d)
 "means an individual licensed and
 registered under the laws of this
 Commonwealth to engage in the prac-
 tice of engineering."


  Briefly the term "practice of en-
gineering" means any professional
service or creative work requiring en-
gineering education, training, and ex-
perience and the application of spe-
cial knowledge of the mathematical.
physical and engineering sciences to
such professional services or crea-
tive work as consultation. investign
tion, evaluation, planning, design, and
supervision of construction for the
purpose of assuring compliance with
specifications and design, pertaining
to any private or public utilities,
structures, buildings, machines, equip-
ment, processes, works or projects.
  In general, the requirements for
registration as a professional engin-
eer emphasize character. education
experience, and the passing of pre-
scribed examinations. Three succes-
sive steps are required in most states,


  EDITOR'S   NOTE: Professor R. C.
Gorham   of the Electrical Engineering
Department is the first faculty guest con-
tributor, initiating a series of articles
pertaining to faculty activities beyond
the lectern. Professor Gorham received
aI B. A. degree [rom Nebraska-Wesleyan
in 1917, an E. E. degree from Cornell
University in 1924 and a M. S. degree
from the University of Pittsburgh in 1941.
  Professor Gorhamn is well qualified to
write concerning   engineering registra-
tion; he was appointed by Governor
Duff in July, 1950 to membership on the
State Board for Professional Engineering
Registration.


(1) graduation  from     an approved
course in engineering of four years
or more in an accredited school or
college; (2) completion of an addi-
tional four years or more of active
experience in engineering work of a
grade character satisfactory to the
board of examiners; and (3) passing
the required written examination. For
the non-graduate from an accredited
school, more years of experience, in
some cases 10 years instead of four
years, are required for admission to
the examination.
   In Pennsylvania a degree from an
 accrediated engineering school, a ten
 dollar fee, and a favorable reply from
 five qualified references, qualifies one
 for an "Engineer-In-Training" certifi-
 cate. Four years later, after having
 practical engineering experience, the
 "Engineer-In-Training" becomes eli-


gible for the final examination in his
own field, on the practical applications
of fundamentals in that field. The
"Engineer-In-Training" certificate ex-
cuses the holder from the first day's
examination   in fundamentals. One
having a degree from an engineering
school of recognized standing and
four years of acceptable practical ex-
perience may become eligible for the
final examination after he has made
application for same, paid the $25.00
fee, and five qualified references fa-
vor the applicant. The holder of an
"Engineer - In - Training"  certificate
pays only $15.00 for the final examin-
ation. Other advantages and objec-
tives for the Engineer-In-Training cer-
tificate holder are: (1) it gives the
young graduate professional identifi-
cation and consciousness; (2) it as-
sists him in obtaining professional
qualifications and recognition; (3) it
protects him from the inroads of
unionization through his professional
identification; (4) it facilitates rela-
tions of guidance, counsel and co-
operations by older engineers and
(5) it expedites and facilitates the
attainment of Full Professional Cer-
tification.
   Members of engineering registra-
tion boards are Professional Engin-
eers of high standing, nominated by
their Professional colleagues in each
state; their service is one of devotion
to the Profession, self sacrificing and
non-lucrative. There is no inducement
to make the appointments a political
consideration. Examinations, registra-
tions and revocations are all handled
by boards of examiners. Cases of un-
lawful practice are decided in court.
Therefore, the administration of the
registration law is kept on as high a
plane as the standards of the Profes-
sion itself.
   Registration has been used by other
professions as a powerful instrument
for raising educational qualifications,
electrical standards; Professional sta-
tus, and public recognition. It will do
the same for the engineering profes-
sion if the young graduate engineers
proceed at once to work at it to that
end. The ultimate goal is for all grad-
uate engineers to apply for the En-
gineer-In-Training certificate imme-
diately following their graduation, and
help prove to the lawmakers, officials
and the public that they mean busi-
ness in Engineering, which is a learn-
ed Profession.

             THE AUTHOR

  Ronald Williams, a
senior in the Mechani-
cal Engineering   De-
partment, is not a new-
comer to   Skyscraper
readers. His   article,
"Atomic Power In the
Home", appeared in the

is currently Vice Chair-
man of the ASME and

  Is the engineering training that we receive at
Pitt too theoretical? Probably many of us have
asked ourselves that question before and have
come up with an answer-yes. Perhaps there is
too much bookwork and not enough chance for the
individual student to investigate and work on a
practical problem or test of his own liking or
creation. Of course our lab work helps some, but
offers very little chance for individual study or
self-expression.
  However, it has been a long standing policy in
the Mechanical Engineering Department to en-
able all interested students to do some practical
work or research on a project of their own choos-
ing. It was for this purpose that the courses
M.E. 97 for Mechanicals and A.E. 97 for Aero-
nauticals were created. Here the student picks
the project that he wishes to work on, gains first
hand information and experience by working on
it, and also receives credits for his efforts. In
the case of the Aero students, this work can also

be used as a partial fulfillment of the thesis re-
quirements.
  Although the students are encouraged to work
Completely on their own (and they rarely want
help to begin with), they do at times reach an
impasse and need assistance. Professor Norman
Wackenhut is always around to assist the Mechan-
cals, and Mr. Richard Erdlac is never too busy to
aid one of the Aeros. They will often give ad-
vice and information, but will urge the students
to call upon their own ingenuity to solve the prob-
lem at hand.
   All the work on the project is done in the
 Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in 3 Thaw
 Hall. Here the students have the use of all the
 available machines and testing equipment and
 have access to many parts that they may need in
 their projects. The students are also urged to do
 their own machining and to set up their own
 equipment, but in case of difficulties they can al-
 ways get willing help from the laboratory techni-
 cians, Jim Snyder and Bob Fair.
   Now let's take a look at some of the work that
has been accomplished recently by some of the
students in these courses of practical engineering.
              CHARLES PHOEBE
   "Just like downtown" is an expression that
suits Chuck Phoebe's experiment to a T. Chuck's
research on the pressures created in the combus-
tion chamber of an internal combustion engine is
exactly the type of research work that is being
conducted by all the large producers in the auto-
motive industry. Chuck, who is an avid automo-
tive enthusiast, got the idea for his project from

  up his engine and

    checks the scope
       Sa,oo


an SAE seminar meeting on the effects of alcho-
hol-water injection. He is now putting his sec-
ond semester of work on it.
   Chuck's equipment includes a 5 HP, one cylin-
 der gasoline engine loaded down by a 2 HP elec-
 tric motor, a piezoelectric cell which converts the
 impressed pressures into an electric signal for in-
 dicating pressure magnitudes, and an angular
 sweep mechanism to indicate the position of the
 crank during the stroke. The signals from the
 piezoelectric cell and the angular sweep mechan-
 ism are fed into an oscilloscope for a visual record
 of pressure versus crank angle. There is also
 photographic equipment on hand to make a per-
 manent record of the results.
   Chuck's present aims to get the set-ups work-
ing perfectly and record the pressure variations
that result. Eventually he plans to use the equip-
ment to study the effects of alchohol-water injec-
tion acting as an anti-detonant in the gasoline
engine.
              FRANK BALTAKIS
  Frank Baltakis, last semester's outstanding
Aeronautical Senior, has been working on a pro-
ject that will benefit both himself and many stu-
dents in the future. Frank completely designed
and built a flow tank having a horizontal testing
channel. He also designed and machined the
axial flow pump which operates completely sub-
merged in water. The pump circulates the water
in the tank and passes it up through the horizon-
tal channel which is open for observation and
testing. The pump is capable of delivering 50 gal-
lons of water per minute with velocities up to 2

feet per second in the test section.
  The importance of the equipment rises from the
fact that waves formed around a model placed in
flowing water are very analogous to supersonic
shock waves. In fact the water with a velocity
of 2 feet per second corresponds to air flowing
at about 3000 miles per hour. Frank's equipment
can therefore be used in the future as an aid in
teaching supersonic aerodynamics, especially as
demonstration equipment. The fact that the en-
tire unit is only 40 inches long and can be used
for demonstration purposes in place of the mas-
sive air tunnel required to give a velocity of 3000
miles per hour, again shows the value of this
equipment.
  By designing and constructing this flow tank
and pump, Frank has indeed demonstrated how
the student may put to practical use the know-
ledge that he gets out of his classwork.
            RALPH GIMERA AND
            WILLIAM KALASKI
  Since the advent of the gase turbine and jet
engine, engineers have been devoting much re-
search to the study of combustion factors which
affect the burning of fuels. Among their dis-
coveries was the fact that sound waves impressed
upon a flame could affect it in many ways. They
can set up the turbulence that is needed to get
proper combustion, but if left uncontrolled, they
can cause rough burning and even blowoff of the
flame. This discovery was found to be especially
useful in studying the effects of sounds set up in
jet engines upon the combustion characteristics.
   In one of the projects carried on by students
apparatus was built that could be used to deter-
mine the effects of sound waves upon the combus-
tion of a fuel. It is essentially a burner tube with
provisions made to impress a sound wave of up
to 30 KC upon the mixture to be carried to the
flame. Also provisions were made to measure the
air to fuel ratio and temperature of the mixture
as well as the temperature of the flame surface.
The effects will be determined by means of high
speed photography.
   The original design was done last year by Ralph
Gimera and last semester Bill Kalaski finished
the design and started construction. In the fu-
ture other students will complete the instrumen-
tation and calibration of the unit,
   In addition to its basic purpose, the apparatus
seems to be flexible enough for more general com-
bustion experiments such as basic tests on fuels,
mixtures, additives and flame propagation velo-
cities.
               JULIUS PELINE
   Right in line with the recent developments in
jet engines is the model ram jet being constructed
by Julius Peline. Last year Eugene Hoffman be-
gan the design and last semester Julius finished
the design and began construction of the model.
Next semester Lee Noga is going to design a sys-
tem to measure the thrust and internal drag
created by the model.
   When completed the plans are to use the model
 in demonstrating its operation to future aero-
 nautical classes. It will also be used to indicate
 the thermodynamic cycle of such a ram jet.
   Jule demonstrated his ingenuity when it came
to machining the inside of the model containing
the diffuser, combustion zone and nozzle. This
section contains many difficult curved interior

sections that had to be machined very carefully.
By cutting brass templates of the inside surface
and by using an Ames dial to guide his cutting,
Jule was able to successfully complete the machin-
ery that was necessary. He also designed and
completely machined the combustion system.
   For a complete coverage of the design of this
 unique model ram jet, see Jule Peline's article in
 the January, 1952 edition of the SKYSCRAPER
 ENGINEER.
           ROBERT FRAYER AND
             THOMAS SULLIVAN
   No doubt all of us have seen a carburetor.
Probably very few, however, have had the op-
portunity to see just what happens in a carbure-
tor while it is functioning. Maybe late this se-
mester you will be able to see right into the heart
of a carburetor while it is in operation. If you
do, it will be due to the efforts of two Aeronau-
tical students, Bob Frayer and Tom Sullivan.
   Bob started the project by cutting rectangular
 holes into a Carter Carburetor and removing the
 vaporizing venturi tubes and their supports. Tom
 is now completing the project by inserting plexi-
 glass windows into the carburetor so that the
 operation within it can be seen. In addition Tom
 is replacing the metal venturi tubes and braces
 with ones of plexiglass so that the vaporization
 and flow of the fuel can also be seen. All the
 plastic parts had to be machined very carefully
 and then sealed into place. The machining of the
 plexiglass was not easy; the windows were ap-
 plied to curved surfaces and required precise cur-
 vature. But this situation gave Tom a chance to
 stretch his imagination and he came up with a
 good solution to complete the job.
   It is hoped that upon its completion the car-
buretor can be attached to one of the engines in
the lab for use in demonstrating the principle
and operation of a carburetor to future students.
             ERNEST WILLIAMS
  Another project whose results will benefit
future students was the construction of two Wag-
ner Type or Tension Field beams. The project
was started by Dom Maglore and completed last
fall by Ernie Williams who constructed the beams.
  The beams are primarily used in aircraft struc-
tures. Their chief advantage is that they are
light and very strong in bending, while being
weak in torsion. The beam has a web which
buckles when the beam is loaded in bending, en-
abling the beam to carry the shear load in the
web as a tension load. By this means it is able
to resist the shear loading in the web and by de-
sign is inherently strong in bending.
  In the future the beams can be used for dem-
onstrating to classes the manner in which this
important type beam carries and distributes the
loads placed upon it.
  The application of theoretical knowledge to a
practical project is not limited to students within
the Mechanical lab. Mr. Robert Jackson, an in-
structor, is doing some advanced and important
work in the lab under a fellowship from the Pitts-
burgh Piping and Equipment Company. His pro-
ject includes the experimental determination of
forces and moments set up in complicated piping
systems. A complete report of Mr. Jackson's
interesting work can be found in the May, 1951
issue of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.

BRIDGE LIGHTING
   An illumination level of 2.9 foot-
candles makes the new Monongahela
River Dravosburg bridge near Mc-
Keesport, Pennsylvania one of the
best lighted bridges in the nation.
   Seventy-one units are mounted at
 a height of 3112 feet above the 50
 foot roadway on poles spaced 100 feet
 opposite. Oval shaped Westinghouse
 OV-20 luminaires make possible the
 highly efficient horizontal operation
 of 400 watt, 20,000 lumen mercury
 vapor lamps.
 LEVITATION MELTING
 No support for melting metals? It's
 not the age of old Indian rope trick
 but something just as incredible,
 Westinghouse   Electric Corporation
 announced recently. Solid aluminum
 was placed between two slightly con-
 ical horizontal coils of copper spaced
 a few inches apart and supplied with
 energy at 10,000 cycles. Once the
 coils were energized the aluminum
 floated up into space between the
 coils. It spun furiously and bobbed as
 though supported on invisible soft
 springs. It became red, softened and
 finally turned into a bright liquid, as-
 suming the shape of a rapidly turning
 toy top as it did so. When the coils
 were deenergized the molten alumi-
num dropped into a crucible and solid-
ified almost instantly.
  This type of melting, levitation
melting, is the outcome of efforts of
research engineers to prepare more
nearly pure metals. When a high
temperature metal such as zircon-
ium, vanadium, molybdenum or ti-
tanium is melted in a crucible there
is inevitably some reaction with the
refrectory materials. But obviously if


the metal could be melted without
touching anything except molecules
of gas-as if done in a sufficiently
high vacuum-greater purity would
be obtained. Thus a metal could be
rid of volatile impurities without ab-
sorbing others in the process. Also,
alloying agents could be added to the
molten metal while still suspended.
The induced currents would auto-
matically provide thorough stirring of
the molten mass.
  So far this process has been applied
successfully to laboratory melts in-
volving small samples, and to a very
limited number of metals. Neverthe-
less, float melting has been employed
to advantage in research for metals
in lamps, electronic tubes and other

high temperature applications, partic-
ularly where it is not necessary to
carry the temperature of the metal
beyond its melting point. Investiga-
tions are being continued with the
aim of surmounting such problems
as power requirements and physical
forces related to the general problem.

COLOR TELEVISION
  Disclosing the vast scope of its re-
search and engineering in developing
electronic picture tubes for color tele-
vision, the   Radio  Corporation   of
America announced in October, 1951,
that it has built five types of tri-color
tubes, each one capable of operation
on all known television systems.
  The five types of tubes illustrate
basic designs covering a wide range
of principles. Among the principles


MARCH, 1952


employed are screens formed of color
phosphors arranged in patterns of
dots, lines and checkerboard. Al-
though the dot structure has been
adopted for the tri-color tube now
used experimentally in the RCA com-
patible color television system, other
designs can incorporate any one of
the several screen textures of varia-
tion of them without affecting the
system.
  The tri-color tube of the dot struc-
ture screen design reproduces color
pictures when color signals are broad-
cast, or it will produce black and
white pictures when the signal is in
standard black and white.
  On a black and white receiving
tube, or kinescope, the inside of the


face plate is covered with a solid coat-
ing of sensitive phosphorescent ma-
terial. In the tri-color tube the screen
assembly, or face of the tube, consists
of an aperture mask, spacer frame
and tri-color phosphor dot plate which
acts as the direct view color screen.
  The dot plate is flat glass on which
600,000 small closely spaced phosphor
dots, each .014 inches in diameter,
are arranged in triangular groups.
Each group consists of three dots
which glow in the three primary
colors when hit by a scanning elec-
tron beam.
  Behind the phospher dot plate is
the aperture or shadow mask. This is
a thin metal sheet perforated with
200,000 tiny holes, one for each tri-
angular color group, that acts as a
mask so that, in scanning, each elec-
tron beam can "see" only one dot
of each color group. The mask is kept
at the correct distance from the phos-
phor dot plate by means of a spacer
frame.
  In the neck of the tube are the
three electron guns which generate
the beams for scanning the phosphor
dot plate.

HEAT


TREATING


BERYLLIUMt


The many properties which may easily be realized from beryllium
       copper make it a leader among the non-ferrous metals.


  How would you feel if you had to replace the
radiator in your care every year?  No doubt
you would complain endlessly. But you don't have
to replace your radiator every year. In fact you
should never have to replace it. Why? Because
copper is the material used for your radiator. If
ordinary steel were used there would be the yearly
replacements.  The corrosion resistant copper
radiator usually out lives your car. This is only
one example where a non-ferrous material gets
the nod over steel. Because of the varied proper-
ties obtainable from non-ferrous metals, these
materials have been developed to meet many of
industry's specialized needs. The development of
beryllium copper is a good example. In 1931
beryllium copper was first produced commercial-
ly in the United States. At that time, this alloy
was so rapidly and highly publicized that the re-
sult was a misunderstanding of its properties and
a consequent failure of the material for the uses
to which it was applied. Since then, however, the
alloy with development and proper application
has become a valuable commercial product. Its
high strength and hardness, excellent corrosion,
wear, and fatigue resistance, along with good
electrical and thermal conductivity have resulted
in the wide application of beryllium copper. It
is most familiar as a spring material but has be-
come popular for use as bushings, bearings, cams
and elements in precision instruments. The de-
velopment that has made this wide application
possible is the heat treating technique that brings
out the optimum physical properties of this age
hardening alloy.
   Copper and small percentages of beryllium
form a partial solid solution type alloy. A copper
alloy of two percent beryllium, for instance, is a
single phase, solid solution structure in the range
13850 to 1650' F. At room temperature, under
equilibrium conditions, the structure consists of
two phases, the solid solution phase rejecting a
second phase upon equilibrium cooling. However,
if the alloy is cooled very rapidly, as in a water
quench, from the solid solution field, this single
phase structure is preserved at room temperature.
The structure at room temperature is then con-
sidered a super saturated solid solution. In beryl-
lium copper this single phase condition will re-
main indefinitely if the temperature is not raised
appreciably.  Raising the temperature to the
range 600' to 9000 F. and holding causes the solid
solution, tending toward equilibrium, to reject or
precipitate a second phase. These features of the
physical structure of beryllium copper are the
points that are significant in the alloy's heat
treatment. Proper control of these phenomena
results in a material with excellent properties.


  Quenching beryllium copper from the solid
solution temperature range results in a soft struc-
ture that is easily worked and formed, while sub-
sequent heating to the 600' to 9000 F. range and
holding hardens the material and brings out the
desired physical properties. This first step is
known as a solution anneal while the second treat-
ment is called age hardening. The desired pro-
perties of the material determine the manner in
which these operations are carried out. The
significant factors in each operation will be dis-
cussed.
          SOLUTION ANNEALING
  The two main factors that must be considered
for proper solution annealing are time and tem-
perature. What temperature should be employed
and how long should the alloy be soaked at this
temperature? Time and temperature are im-
portant because they control the grain size of the
structure and the completeness of solubility of
the beryllium in the copper. Complete solubility
with small grain size is desired. Higher soaking
temperatures and longer time periods are 'sug-
gested for best solution effect. However, these
conditions promote grain growth. A compromise
in time and temperature is the usual adoption.
  John T. Richards, development engineer for the
Beryllium Company, suggests a solution anneal
for a typical high strength 2% beryllium alloy
(25 alloy) of one hour per inch or fraction of
inch of section thickness at 1450' F. A water
quench from this temperature is the general prac-
tice.
              AGE HARDENING
   As in solution annealing, the basic factors con-
sidered in artificial age hardening are time and
temeprature. Again it should be emphasized
that the particular properties desired in the hard-
ened material determine the hardening practice.
The effect of the time and temperature variables
can most easily be illustrated by reference to fig-
ure #1, showing the relationship of tensile

strength, which varies directly with hardness,
and aging time at various temperatures. Of sig-
nificance is the fact that as temperature of treat-
ment is increased the time factor becomes critical.
That is, at the high temperatures the maximum
tensile strength is obtained quickly but also drops
off quickly. The decrease in tensile strength is
known as "over aging." Although the lower tem-
perature treatments require longer aging periods
the maximum tensile strength is higher and the
over aging effect is more easily avoided. Effect
of cold working the solution annealed material
prior to aging is clearly shown by comparing part
(a) and (b) of figure one. The cold working
raises the maximum tensile strength and de-
creases the aging time required to reach this max-
imum. Of course, the cold working gives the alloy
an initially higher tensile strength.
   There are two types of hardening treatments
in general use. According to Richards they are
the standard low temperature type and the short
time, high temperature type. The processes vary
depending upon whether a high strength alloy or
a high conductivity alloy is desired. If the high
strength alloy is desired by the standard low
temperature process, Richards suggests a com-
position of greater than one per cent beryllium
held for one to three hours at 6000 to 650' F. For
a high conductivity alloy a composition of less
than one percent beryllium, held for one to three
hours at 850' to 9000 F is recommended. The
high temperature process is not applied to high
conductivity alloys, but for a high strength alloy,
Richards recommends holding for fifteen to nine-
ty minutes at 6500 to 7250 F. These suggested
practices should be considered only as a guide.
   The properties desired determine the treat-
ment. This might best be seen by referring to
figure two. As Richards points out, each treat-
ment has its advantages. If good resistance to
wear is desired, thirty minutes heating time
(number one) will result in maximum tensile
strength and hardness. For maximum stability,
which is desirable in spring applications, a forty-
five minute hold, which will result in minimum
drift is specified (number two). For dimension-
al control, the heating time should be sixty min-
utes (number three), so that the tension modulus
is a maximum. Bear in mind, though, that these
times apply only for an aging temperature of
6600 F.
   Clearly then, the value of beryllium copper
 stems from its responsiveness to heat treatment.
 Its many uses depend upon the properties obtain-
 able by particular heat treatments. These treat-
 ments are simple to apply and can be depended
 upon to give consistant results. As industry is

rapidly developing new machines and instru-
ments, especially in the field of electronics, strong
materials of high conductivity are more and more
in demand. Beryllium copper might very well
become even more popular in the future.

   Major Nuisance, the eminent mili-
 tary strategist once set about to test
 the intelligence of some recruits
 (from board 19, I believe). He took
 five of them out onto the drill field
 and lined them up behind each other
 in such a way that each man could
 see all the men in front of him, but
 could not see any of the men behind
 him. The major then blindfolded the
 men and said to them, "Men, I have
 here five hats, three of which the red
 and two of which are white. I shall
 put a hat on each of you." (which
 he did). He then removed the blind-
 folds and said to the third man from
 the front( or was he third from the
 rear??), "Do you know the color of
 the hat which you now wear?" The re-
 cruit answered "No, sir." The major
 repeated the question to the man in
 front of him (second from the front)
 and after a few seconds received the
 same answer. He then asked the front
 man the same question, and the front
 man answered "Yes sir." Assuming
 that the first two men addressed
 were intelligent enough to have fig-
 ured the color of their hats had it
 been possible for them to do so, what
 was the color of the front man's hat,
 and how did he know?
 With the forthcoming primaries re-
 ceiving so much attention nowadays
 we are reminded of this one. The Re-
 publicans were figuring their possi-
 bilities, and found that if all but four
 of their senatorial candidates won,
 they would have a majority of two in
 the Senate. What would be their ma-
 jority if all of their candidates won.
 A card shark can deal himself any
 hand he wants to as often as he wants
 providing, of course, that he doesn't
 get caught in the act. If a novice who
 knew none of the tricks of the trade
 wanted to be sure that he had four of
 a kind, how many cards would he
 have to deal himself?
 Now a quickie: A certain worm we
 know tried to climb a post ten feet
high. If the worm ascends three feet
in the day and falls back two feet at
night, how many days will it take him
to reach the top?

  Of all the combinations of three
numbers which will multiply to 1296,
only two combinations add to the
same sum. These combinations are
72, 18, and 1 and 81, 8 and 2. Since
the census taker knew the total (the
house number) but did not have
enough information, the total must
have been 91. The census taker then
asks, "Are you the oldest?" He is
answered, "Yes", and from this in-
formation is able to deduce the ages
of the other three members of the
household. Had the man been older
than 81, the census taker would have
learned nothing by the answer, but
since he was able to deduce the ages,
the man must have been younger
than 81, eliminating the second com-
bination. If you still don't understand,
we'll tell you that the house number
is 91 and the other members of the
family are 72, 18, and 1 year old.

   This semester, again, the Pitt Student
 Branch of the American Institute of Elec-
 trical Engineers has a program designed to
 supplement the regular curriculum.
   Illumination Engineering, telephone cir-
cuit aspects and electronics for neurologi-
cal research are topics for the departmental
seminars.






  The student section of the American In-
stitute of Industrial Engineers plan a full
year of interesting   programs. Included
among these are various speakers from the
Pittsburgh district.
   Outstanding event of last semester was




   Among the outstanding speakers pre-
sented by the American Society of Civil
Engineers were Mr. G. S. Richardson, Con-
sulting Engineer, who spoke on the "Penn
Lincoln Highway", Mr. C. K. Hertrick, H. M.
Robertson Company, who spoke on "Q-
Flooring", and Mr. H. L. King, Assistant Re-
siden Engineer of the Veteran Administra-
tion Hospital, who spoke on the "V. A.
Hospital Center".




  The American Road Buliders Association
was very fortunate in having several very
fine speakers during the last semester.
Among them were Mr. J. McKnight of the
Portland Cement Association whose topic
was "The Pennsylvania Turnpike" and Mr.




  The Society of Automotive Engineers got
off to a fast start with a field trip to the
Alcoa works in New Kensington on Thurs-
day, February 21. The men who attended
spent an interesting afternoon watching all
phases of the production of aluminum. The
SAE's also turned out in force at the month-
ly dinner meeting of the Pittsburgh re-
gional chapter on February 26, at the Web-


brought about. There will be more repairs
in the future whenever the budget permits.
All societies are urged to enter the- FE&M
intermurals this spring. In addition to soft-
ball there will be competition in gymnas-
tics, track, golf, and swimming.
   The study hall schedule will again be
posted as soon as the class schedules are
available.




   The student AIEE took an active part in
 the Religion-in-Life program by contributing
 to the fund raising drive, and in addition
 the Religion-in-Life theme was developed
 for the students by a guest speaker.
   Meetings have also been set aside for
 the developement and presentation of stu-
 dent papers and, as in the past, for an em-

 versatile President, entertained the group
 with his feats of magic. The affair was
 extremely successful, and a repeat per-

 semester.




   The group has been very active in intra-
 mural sports. Two Civil teams each won
 their section in touch football, and the Civil
 "A" team is currently undefeated in basket-
 ball.
   In the near future are a dance and a
 picnic. Also in the offing is a trip to the

  This semester the members of Sigma
Gamma Epsilon have gone all out in pre-
senting  a varied  agenda of activities.
Among the speakers have been Dr. G. R.
Fitterer, who spoke on "The Importance of
Engineers", Mr. John Chickerno, who spoke
on "Foreign Employment", and Professor
H. G. Botset, who spoke on the "Advant-
ages of an Honorary Fraternity".




   Last semester, the first under the guid-
 ance of Mr. Stuart, saw Sigma Tau complete
 a busy schedule highlighted by an informal
 dance held in January.
   As is customary, the initiation of new
 members will be the first item of business
 on the Sigma Tau calendar for the spring
 semester.
   Plans to construct a monument on the
 Pitt campus will be furthered this semester.




   The Pitt Student chapter I.R.E. is under-
going a reorganization of its functions. The
first meeting of the new semester resulted
in election of the above officers. Plans for

annual university Tap Day. Recipients of
the awards will be the two students who
attained the highest scholastic averages
during their freshman year.

J HAHNE I E. '52


     Editor's Note: Mr. Hahne is presently one
   of the most active men on the hill, serving
   as Chairman of the student AIIE, president
   of Scabbard and Blade Military Science Hon-
   orary, and vice president of Sigma Tau.
   During the summer, Bill worked at Penn
   State where he helped test welded joints on
   pipe lines for the much publicized water
   tunnel.
   Today, nearly all manufactured parts receive
careful inspection, and it is essential that these
parts be inspected through the use of non-de-
structive methods. This inspection coordinates
surface appearance, tolerance limitations and
composition rquirements. An equally important
requisite of structures to most inspectors is the
character and homogeneity of the composite sec-
tions. There is an ever increasing desire to see
and to know what lies below the surface of the
metal object. The exacting service requirements
of machine parts and the necessity of weight
limitations has made it imperative that these
parts be of a uniform high quality. In the past,
most of the non-destructive inspection has been
done with the X-ray machine, but in 1930 the
Navy used radium as its source emaninating
gamma-rays for the first commercial radiograph-
ic examination. The sternpost of the cruiser
"Chester" was examined. Today, because of such
advantages as constant activity, simplicity of op-
eration, portability, minimum of scattering and
good penetration, radium radiography proves
more practical than the X-ray machine in many
cases.
  What is a radiograph? It is a photographic
record of the passage of X-rays or gamma rays
through an object onto a film. The diagram in
Figure 1 shows the essential features in the pro-
duction of a radiograph. The focal spot is a small
capsule containing the radium salt which is used
as the source of radiation. The radiation pro-
ceeds in straight lines to the object; some of the
rays pass through and others are absorbed--the
amount transmitted depending on the nature of
the material and its thickness. If the object is a
steel casting, for example, and a void, which was
formed by a gas bubble, exists, more radiation
will pass through the section containing the void
than through the surrounding area because the
void results in a reduction of the total thickness
of steel to be penetrated. A dark spot, corres-


the non-destructive testing of castings.


ponding to the projected position of the void, will
therefore appear on the film when it is developed.
Thus, a radiograph is in reality a shadow picture
of an object-the dark regions on the film repre-
senting the more penetrable parts, and the lighter
regions the more opaque.
  Photographic films are sensitive to the direct
action of the x-rays, but the exposure time neces-
sary may be decreased very appreciably by the
use of a fluorescent chemical, e. g., calcium tung-
state, in contact with both sides of the film. Such
a powdered chemical is mixed with a suitable
binder and coated on cardboard to form an inten-
sifying screen. Its action depends upon the fact
that it converts some of the X-ray energy into
ordinary light to which the film is also very sen-
sitive.
  In order that a radiograph may be of maximum
usefulness in determining the homogeneity of the
object inspected, it should have four characteris-
tics: it should be free from distortion or deforma-
tion of the shape of the object; it must contain a
sharp and well defined shadow of the object;
there must be sufficient contrast in the darkening
of the film to permit its interpretation; it must
be free from chemical stains, misleading process
markings, or abrasions.
   The conclusion that with a radium capsule,

   Radium is currently gaining prominence

some film and film holders, and a darkroom, any-
one can make a radiograph is not far from wrong.
A small radium capsule is placed in a cartridge
supported by a clamp or string in front of the
specimen to be inspected. Films in light-tight
holders (casettes) are fastened to the back of the
specimen to be radiographed.
   Radiograph technique is usually checked by
the use of a sensitivity gauge known as a penetra-
meter. The penetrameter is a strip or a step-
wedge of the same material as the structure be-
ing radiographed. The thickness of the penetra-
meters is a definite proportion of the structure
section. The penetrameter is placed on the face
of the object to be radiographed that is nearest
to the radium. The radiographic technique is
considered satisfactory if the outline of that por-
tion of the penetrameter wich is 2% of the sec-
tion thickness is shown clearly on the radiograph.
The radiographic technique is said then to be of a
sensitivity of 2 per-cent. There are times when,
due to the small size of the objects being radio-

graphed, it is not practical to place penetrameters
on the item being radiographed. In such cases, it
is permissible to place them upon a block of metal
of the same kind, density and thickness as the
structure being radiographed. Such a block is
usually placed upon that part of the film farthest
from the source of radiation.
   In planning radiographic exposures, informa-
tion should be available to the radiographer re-
garding specifications covering objects to be in-
spected.   In certain specifications, methods of
inspection are detailed, areas to be radiographed
are specified and sensitivity required is stipulat-
ed. After the radiographer has decided on the
view he will take, he should mark out on the ob-
ject the area to be radiographed, in such a man-
ner that the films may be easily identified. If no
individual sections are to'be radiographed he must
decide what view will supply the most useful in-
formation, by covering various planes to the best
advantage. It is suggested that sketches be made
showing varying section thicknesses, which will
assist him in determining the possible limits of
one exposure. Lack of varied experience pre-
vents the author from determing the maximum
length to be radiographed with one exposure, but

 calculations and experience of others have shown
 that the maximum length that can be inspected
 with one exposure without having any part of the
 film receive more than twice the normal expo-
 sure is equal to:
   2D for steel 1/2" thick.
   1 3/4 D for steel 1" thick.

   Next the casting should be examined for any
external marks or flaws which will be within the
area of the radiograph, as these might be mis-
taken for internal defects. Having made all the
necessary descriptive notes and. recorded the loca-
tions of the radiographs on blue prints, then the
radiographer is ready to place the exposure. A
suitable size of film should be chosen to record
the areas planned. The object to be radiographed
is now ready to be placed on the film holder if the
object is small, or in the case of large castings or
fabrications, the film holder is tacked to the ob-
ject by any method that will insure the close con-

(Continued from page 9 )
attitude toward nature. Herein lies the great
genius of Einstein. It was due to his work on the
photoelectric effect, the specific heat of solids,
and relativity that the modern physicist had to
retreat and take stock, so to speak, of his funda-
mental attitude toward nature in order to avoid
another mental revolution such as the one per-
perated by Einstein. In effect, the modern physi-
cist wishes to remove the necessity of another
Einstein by formulating a basic attitude which is
entirely flexible to new situations, for another
mental revolution, besides being costly, would
prove very embarrassing.
   The fruit of the Einstein revolution is that it
has produced what has become known as the
operational philosophy. True, this philosophy
has its origin in the works of Ernst Mach as
logical positivism and Einstein was greatly influ-
enced by Mach's writings, but the fact remains it
was Einstein who formulated much of the basic
principles in his work on relativity.
   In the first place, the operational philosophy
demands that the attitude of the physicist be one
of empiricism. The limits on new experience be-
came infinite and experience is determined solely
by experience.    Previously, physical concepts
were defined in terms of their properties so that
physics assumed an abstract character in analogy
with mathematics as is evident by Newton's three
laws of motion where one begins with a given set
of axioms and postulates and proceeds from there,
not caring whether or not any conclusions which
result have actual physical meaning or a counter-
part in nature, as long as the basic axioms and
postulates are not violated. It was the task of
the physics experimenter to ascertain whether
the concepts as defined orginally actually had a
counterpart in nature and all too frequently no
counterpart existed. Consequently, the new atti-
tude which arose through the operational philo-
sophy and is completely flexible to new concepts
and experiences insists that the concept be syn-
onomous with a given set of physical operations.
These defining operations must be unique in
order to remove any possibility of ambiguity in
practical experience; therefore, the physicist
readily admits the possibility of new kinds of
experience outside the realm of his present know-
ledge, but he is now mentally geared for whatever
facts present themselves.
  As defined by Halliday, the main features of
the operational philosophy can be stated as:
  1) Concepts are not considered as things in-
tuitively understood; concepts are defined as the
objective results of certain carefully prescribed
operations that can, at least in principle, be car-
ried out in the laboratory.
  2) These operational definitions give rise to
sets of pointer readings of one sort or another.
Such pointer readings are the "irrefutable facts
of nature".   Quantities for which operational
definitions cannot be given are unobservable;
they do not belong to the realm of science.
  3) Physical laws are relationships between
operationally defined physical quantities that al-
ways seem to occur when certain experiments are
performed.
  4) It is the role of theory to give, on the basis
of a few hypotheses, a simple unified description


of as many experiments as possible. The question
of the ultimate truth of either hypotheses or
theory simply does not arise.
   5) Theories and hypotheses may be replaced
at any time by more useful ones; that is by ones
that describe the same experiments in a simpler
way. In point of fact, many scientists identfy
"reality" with the economy with which a logical
positivist describes the sense perceptions that
come (or can be made to come) within his ex-
perience.
   To appreciate the beauty of the operational
philosophy an example of its application will now
be considered. A basic concept fundamental to
physics is that of length. The question arises as
to what we mean by Ingth. Since we admit the
operational philosophy, the question of what is
length can be rephrased as, "What are the opera-
tions which define length?". In the case of mea-
suring concrete objects familiar to everyday liv-
ing, such as a room in a house, the operations in-
volved in measuring the length of the room con-
sist essentially of taking a yardstick (or other
length measuring device), laying it on the floor so
that one end of the measuring stick coincides
with one end of the room, marking the floor at
the point where the other end of the measuring
rod terminates, then proceeding from the new
mark in a similar fashion until the entire room
has been covered from one edge to the other, and
stating that the length of the room is the number
of times the measuring rod was laid along the
room edge. On this basis, it would seem that the
operations defining the length of the room have
been uniquely determined. However, in the case
of measuring the distance from the earth to the
moon or to any of the stars, a breakdown in the
operational definition occurs. To measure the
distance from the earth to the moon according to
our definition requires an observer to take a
measuring rod and to apply it in the same manner
as when measuring the room. Up to this time,
such a procedure seems indeed impractical; con-
sequently, a revision of the original definition
seems necessary. But must the original defini-
tion be revised? In fact, what is meant by the
statement, "The moon is 285,000 miles away from
the earth"? It means that light beams have re-
placed the previous measuring rods; that by the
methods of trigonometry and angle measurement,
the distance to the moon has been calculated. The
trigonometric methods employed assume that Eu-
clidean geometry applies to very great distances,
but this assumption itself has been open to ques-
tion for some time. The measurement also as-
sumes that Newtonian mechanics is valid at such
great distances, and it is further assumed that the
light beams can indeed be unequivocally substitut-
ed for the original measuring rod. In effect then,
the direct concept of length has developed into an
entirely different complex concept of length, and
to remain completely rigorous on the grounds of
the operational philosophy, this new length should
be called by another name. The operations in-
volved here differ radically from the original de-
fining operation and could justify a new name.
  Such operational concepts have been utilized by
Einstein in his relativity theory to establish a
meaning to the length of a moving body (moving
with a speed which is appreciable compared with

Where engineering and


                   pioneering go together


The transmitter-receiver bay unit being worked on by a Western Electric tester,
is part of the complex equipment installed in the Bell System's coast-to-coast
microwave relay towers. Special testing equipment is at the left.


C OMPLETION last Fall of the Bell Tele-
   phone System's coast-to-coast radio
relay route climaxed a production feat
that involved doing many things never
done before.
  The engineers at Western Electric-
manufacturing unit of the Bell System-
were treading on uncharted ground
when they tackled the challenging job of
making the highly complex equipment.
  This radio relay equipment - which
transmits telephone and television sig-
nals at a.carrier frequency of four thou-
sand megacycles per second - called for
many components never made before and
for which no machinery, no tools, no as-
sembly processes were known. Some
components required almost unbeliev-
ably tiny parts-and fantastically small
tolerances.


  Manufacturing facilities and tech-
niques had to be developed to assemble
and wire the complicated equipment
which receives signals having less than
1/10 millionth of the power of an ordi-
nary flashlight bulb-at frequencies ten
times as high as those used in television
sets-amplifies these signals 10 million-
fold and transmits them to the next
tower some 30 miles away.
  Finally, Western's engineers were re-
sponsible for installing the equipment in
107 towers across the nation.
  In all phases of this job, engineers of
varied skills worked closely together as
a team which just wouldn't be stopped
merely because "it hadn't been done be-
fore." That's typical of work at Western
Electric-where engineering and pio-
neering go together.

that of light). In order to determine the length
of a body traveling with a high velocity, Einstein
has developed a world of four-dimensional co-
ordinated geometry in which events and places
are intimately related by the mathematics of the
Minkowski space. Always the observer ispresent
and he reduces motions and events in space and
time to motions relative to himself. This reduc-
tion to a common observer contains the essence of
the operational philosophy, for the observer in-
sists upon operations occuring at times and places
with origins he can account for. Lengths as
measured in the Einstein way are not synonomous
with lengths by our original definition; they are
different. In the limit of small velocity of the
measuring system, however, the two definitions
approach one another by convenience, and this
constitutes a requirement of a good operational
definition; that two such different definitions do,
in the limit, correspond to the same thing.
   Another interesting ramification of the opera-
 tional definition concerns meaningless questions.
 As stated earlier, unless a unique set of operations
Sdefines a quantity, it is labeled unobservable, or
what is the same thing, meaningless, and there-
fore does not belong to the realm of science. One
question which has occurred to most people can be
stated somewhat as, "Is the sensation which
registers in my mind as blue the same sensation
of blue which registers in the mind of my neigh-
bor?" The answer to this question must, of
course, be reducible to a set of operations where-
by the sensations registered by the two indivi-
duals may be conclusively compared.
   It is readily observed that much daily conver-
sation reduces itself to such meaningless state-
ments and questions. The modern physicist must
be continuously aware of the dilemma of mean-
ingless questions as he pursues his thoughts down
new avenues. Obviously the operational philoso-
phy gives him a foothold from which to operate.
  A final interesting ramification of the opera-
tional philosophy concerns the spiritual or reli-
gious. Unless one can perform operations upon
a world which may exist entirely apart from the
real physical world about us, the question of a
spiritual world remains outside the realm of
science; consequently, the age-old "battle" be-
tween science and religion, as viewed from the
operational viewpoint, really does not exist.
   The host of physical laws which the modern
physicist uncovers places him in the class of the
artist except that the two are diametrically op-
posed in motivation. For where the artist wishes
to particularize a general concept such as an
emotion or beauty in a painting, drama, or musi-
cal composition, the physicist wishes to reduce the
myriad of observable physical phenomena to gen-
eral principles. They are alike in that each uses
constructs and inventions to accomplish hs end.
And this must be born in mind when the physicist
announces his discoveries-that he is dealing
with constructs and inventions by means of which
he uncovers relationships between operationally
defined physical quantities that seem to occur al-
most invariably. These relationships constitute
the essence of modern physics development; they
are labeled physical laws.
  By means of the new attitude resulting from

THE     SKYSCRAPER            ENGINEER




the operational philosophy, modern physics has
developed to its present stage of cyclotrons, syn-
chrocyclotrons, betatrons, bevatrons, thinking
machines, and even television. More than ever
before, the modern physicist has incorporated the
basic kernel of what Lord Kelvin once said: "If
you can't measure what you're talking about, you
don't know what you're talking about!" What
future physics development holds for humanity,
one cannot say, but one thing is certain-the
physicist has a philosophy which will keep him
mentally conditioned for anything which he may
uncover in natue.

ploding and expansion were evidenced at veloci-
ties at the 900 feet per second level. Examination
of the retrieved bullets showed amazing results.
The bullet had completely disintegrated to the
base of the cavity and produced over 16 frag-
ments, the largest being the remaining base which
continued to penetrate to a depth of 8 inches. Cap
and anvil had completely fragmented. Expansion
or detonation of the bullet began at a depth of less
than 2 inches and continued to a depth of 8 inches.
The fragments tunneled a wound cavity 4 inches
in diameter and reduced the newspaper to fine
confetti. A terrific black powder char was also
noted and the wound cavity smoked for several
seconds.


      Mushrooming effect of OPX which was fired into
               dirt at thirty-five yards.
  To further test the performance of the "OPX"
bullet, several different target bodies were used.
It was discovered that only 1/4 inch of soft pine
was required to detonate the charge. A number
of water filled tin cans were fired at in order to
test a medium of composition approximating that
of animal tissue. Figure 3 shows these results.
Cans 1 and 2 show exit holes from a standard
round nose solid bullet. Can 3 shows exit hole of
a regular Keith hollow-point bullet. Note negli-
gible expansion. Cans 4 through 10 show exit
holes of the "OPX" bullet. Note the bulged ends
of cans and gaping exit holes.
  At the time of this writing, the "OPX" had not
been tried on game but the author tested the bullet
on two diseased chickens. Results were as ex-
pected. Both chickens died instantly as bullets
passed through their bodies. Impact moved one
chicken back two feet. Post mortems revealed
horrible and complete distruction of internal or-
gans and shattered bones throughout. Strange-
ly enough all bullet fragments passed completely
through both birds, Needless to say, these tests
proved very successful although if used as a game
bullet, the "OPX" would be a bit too destructive
to some edible meat.     (Continued on page 32)

         Expansion Tests On Water Filled Cans
  Over 200 "OPX" cartridges have been loaded
to date by the author and have been experimental-
ly tested on wood, armor-plate, soap, clay and
other mediums. The results are rather uniform
and accuracy leaves nothing to be desired. The
bullets are quite safe and will not start ground
fires. They do, however, require more care and
time in manufacturing than other .38 special
cartridges. Although the "OPX" lacks the pene-
tration of high power rifle bullets, it approaches
their killing power closer than any other com-
mercially produced bullet with the exception of
the .357 Magnum cartridge. This explosive bul-
let more than duplicates the expansion of rifle
bullets and at unusually low velocities. The real
beauty lies in the fact that expansion starts at
very shallow penetration, something which few
rifle bullets can do. For stopping varmints and
medium sized game, this revolver bullet has no
equal.

ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY
   A new combination of three letters-UHF-
is being added to the vocabularly of television
viewers. They stand for Ultra High Frequency.
which is radio engineers' language for a certain
band in the radio spectrum. To the average
American they mean more television stations and
better television service.
   The opening up of the UHF band, in the words
of Dr. C. B. Jolliffe, Vice President and Techni-
cal Director of the Radio Corporation of America,
which pioneered in the exploration of this field,
"means the advent of a truly nation-wide televi-
sion service, with more than 2,000 stations from
coast to coast!
   Extensive tests by RCA and NBC prove the
following points about UHF.
   Television reception on UHF can be just as
clear and stable as on VHF. In some instances it
is even better, for UHF pictures are not bothered
by nearby X-ray equipment, auto ignitions, neon
signs or home appliances, which have been known
to play hob with VHF pictures.
   Present television sets made by RCA Victor
and other manufacturers can be readily adapted
to receive both UHF as well as VHF telecasts.
Many television :manufacturers, including RCA,
have already demonstrated simple converters
which can be readily attached to present sets.

No. 4 of a Series


                 A FABLE





     One day three men, a Lawyer, a Doctor, and an Engineer, ap-
 peared before St. Peter as he stood guarding the Pearly Gates.

     The first man to step forward was the lawyer. With confidence
 and assurance, he proceeded to deliver an eloquent address which
 left St. Peter dazed and bewildered. Before the venerable Saint
 could recover, the Lawyer quickly handed him a writ of mandamus,
 pushed him aside, and strode in the open portals.

     Next came the Doctor. With impressive dignified bearing he
 introduced himself: "I am Dr. Brown."  St. Peter received him
 cordially. "I feel I know you, Dr. Brown. Many who preceeded you
 said you sent them here. Welcome to our city."

     The Engineer, modest and diffident, had been standing in the
background. He now stepped forward. "I am looking for a job." he
said. St. Peter wearily shook his head. "I am sorry," he replied;
"we have no work here for you. If you want a job you can go to
hell." This response sounded familiar to the Engineer, and made
him feel at home. "Very well," he said; "I have had Hell all my life
and I guess I can stand it better than the others."

     St. Peter was puzzled. "Look here young man what are you?"
"I am an Engineer" was the reply. "Oh yes," said St. Peter; "Do
you belong to the Locomotive Brotherhood ?" "No, I am sorry," the
engineer responded apologetically. "I am a different kind of en-
gineer." "I do not understand." said St. Peter. "What on earth do
you do?" The Engineer recalled a definition and calmly replied:
"I apply mathematical principles to the control of natural forces."
This sounded meaningless to St. Peter, and his temper got the best
of him. "Young man," he said; "you can go to Hell with your math-
ematical principles and try your hand on some of the natural forces
there!" "That suits me," responded the Engineer. "I am always
glad to go where there is a tough job to tackle." Whereupon he de-
parted for the nether regions.

     And it came to pass that strange reports began to reach St.
Peter. The Celestial denizens, who had amused themselves in the
past by looking down upon the less fortunate creatures in the In-
ferno, began asking for transfers to that other domain. The sounds
of agony and suffering were stilled. Many new arrivals, after see-
ing both places, selected the Nether regions for their permanent
abode. Puzzled, St. Peter sent messengers to visit Hell and to report
back to him.

    They returned all excited, and reported to St. Peter: "That En-
gineer you sent down there," said the messengers, "has completely
transformed the place so that you would not know it now. He has
harnessed the Fiery Furnaces for light and power. He has cooled
the entire place with artificial refrigeration. He has flung bridges
across the Bottomless Abyss and has bored tunnels through the
Obsidian Cliffs. He has created paved streets, gardens, parks and
playgrounds, lakes, rivers and beautiful waterfalls. That engineer
you sent down there has gone through Hell and made it a realm of
happiness, peace and industry!"

     "Well, I'll be damned," exclaimed St. Peter as he started pack-
ing his grips.

uYou bet it is! An electrical
      conduit has to bend easily,
yet not collapse, flake, chip or
crack. And when it's bent it must
retain the full bend. That's why
Sherarduct is so widely used
throughout the electrical indus-
try. It meets all of these require-
ments and more.

Sherarduct is made of mild, high-
grade steel that is Spellerized to
assure a fine, even-textured con-
duit. Because of its malleability
and ductility, it is easily bent,
with no spring back. When
Sherarduct is bent to 900 it stays
at 900!

Sherarduct is speedily installed,
permits symmetrical conduit runs
and banks. It prevents costly hold
ups on the job, labor kick backs,
erratic flow of materials. When
you use Sherarduct, the whole
conduit installation goes up
faster, easier, more economically.

KODAK REPRODUCTION PAPER
  A new document reproduction paper designed
to provide the best results in the reproduction of
extremely fine detail has been announced by the
Eastman Kodak Company.
  The new paper, Kodagraph Contact Fine-Line
Paper, is expected to prove especially valuable
for reproducing originals with very fine detail,
drawings and documents in poor condition and
printed half-tone originals. In addition, the
company claims that it will make the highest
quality negatives from which top quality cloth
prints or offset plates can be produced if desired.
It is suitable for use with all types of contact
photocopying equipment and will be available in
a wide range of standard sheet and roll sizes in

HUNTING BETAS AND GAMMAS
  A special age requires special instruments.
Already   several types  of  radiation-dection
(radiac ) devices have appeared as a result of both
peaceful and military aspects of nuclear energy.
Two portable types, each completely self-contain-
ed and weighing about 11 pounds, are being de-
veloped for the Army and Navy. One employs
the ionization principle, as distinguished from the
familiar Geiger counter. This type of radiac
gives a true measure of Roentgen energy from
0.08 to 2.0 million electron volts over the entire
spectrum-which the Geiger cannot do. The new
instrument has the extraordinary range of six
decades, from 0.005 Roentgens per hour to 500
Roentgens per hour, which latter extreme inten-
sity might follow an atom-bomb disaster. The
readings are provided as indications on a special
change-scale instrument, not as clicks heard in
earphones.  Although the range is extremely
broad, the accuracy is as good at the low settings
as the higher ones. The electrometer principle

AFAMILY had failed to make a living on a worn-out
    New England farm. Did they demand government
subsidies, checks for crops they didn't raise, high prices
for crops to be burned?
  They would have scorned such things - scorned and
feared, for they knew from days under a foreign despot that
where government money goes, government control goes, too.
  No, this family put everything they owned in that wagon,
and walked beside it 2,000 miles, westward. They didn't
know what was ahead, but they were determined to keep
on going until they found a place of freedom where they
could keep their self-respect.
  They were English, Scotch, Dutch, Italian, French--
people from many places-all, now, Americans. They knew
that the only happiness is from self-respect, and the only
way to self-respect is to earn your own way, not whine
for something for nothing.
  Their sons and grandsons started grocery stores, became
mechanics, saved their money and started factories.
American machines bought by American thrift made the
factories grow.
  And that's America. Made by people willing to walk
2,000 miles beside a wagon-to find opportunity. If such
people are gone, if all we've got left are soft weaklings
who want to be taken care of, then in truth American
manliness is dead, that 2,000 mile walk was wasted, and
there is nothing left of America but a hollow shell.

The distance used in practice will depend upon
the number and size of the objects that are to be
radiographed at one time and upon the definition
(the sharpness of the image) that is desired.
  The developing process for the gamma-ray
films is the same as the X-ray processing and this
process is similar to developing negatives from
films used in the commercial camera. No posi-
tives are made from the radiograph negative as
there is no need for them.
  The last phase of radiograph, and I think the
most important, is the interpretation of the ra-
diograph. Densities at defects are measured on
a densitometer and compared with densities cor-
responding to known thickness of the specimen
on the same film. A curve is plotted of density
vs. thickness for the given film. From this it is
easy to read off thicknesses corresponding to the
densities at the defects. While such a determina-
tion is not difficult or lengthy if appartus is avail-
ble, sufficient information can generally be had
by simply estimating defects by eye. Choosing
spherical gas bubbles for comparison, one can
often judge the depth of the defect by comparison
with these; sometimes surface marks of known
dimensions can be used for comparisons. Of
course experience in comparing radiographic
markings with actual physical examination of
sectioned specimens is of great value in such
work, and is perhaps even more to be desired than
actual quantitative measurements on a densito--
meter. Thus completes the process of radium ra-
diography, the modern method for non-destruc-

  employed has a longer time constant than other

  quite as rapid.
    The other portable radiac employs a newer
  principle, developed by Westinghouse Research
  Laboratories, that of photoelectric detection and
  multiplication of the light given off by phos-
  phors struck by the nuclear radiation. It is a
  little faster in response than the ionization cham-
  ber type, very easy to use, and its warm-up time
  is less but is not as sensitive. It is direct reading
  too, but only for the four higher ranges-from
  0.5 to 500 Roentgens per hour.

     ,WANTED                IE 'S
   Are you seriously trying lo prepare your-
self for a successful career in industrial
engineering? If you are, then you might be
interested in a student organization that
could offer you certain advantages that
would be of benefit to you in the future-
the Pitt chapter of the Society for Advance-
ment of Management.
   The industrial engineers at Pitt, in partic-
ular, lack an effective organization of their
own through which they can express their
views and ideas in the field that they are
preparing for. They need an organization
that will enable them to establish contacts
with other students, as well as professionals,
in industrial engineering. The S.A.M., a na-
tional organization with professional and
student chapters throughout the country,
could provide them with such benefits. Many
of the professional members of this Society
are industrial engineers.
   The Society of Industrial Engineers had
been founded to promote and develop the
principles of that profession, while the Tay-
lor Society had been organized to forward
the concept of "Scientific Management" as
developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor. A
third organization, the Industrial Methods
Society, merged with the S.A.M. in 1946.
Thus, the S.A.M. is an expanding and active
organization, well-represented in the field
of industrial engineering. The professional
and student chapters in Pittsburgh are
among the Society's largest and most active.
Many projects, conferences, and other events
are held by the student chapters at both Pitt
and Duquesne University. The Pittsburgh
professional chapter, representing the in-
dustrial center of the nation, is very power-
ful within the national organization, and
some of the country's largest firms, business,
and industries are represented by its mem-
bers.
  As student members of the S.A.M., you
would be entitled to many advantages of-
fered by the Society. Among these are na-
tion-wide contests for student members, in
which promising students can receive recog-
nition for their work, and also the advantage
of future membership as a professional,
which could be of help to you in your careers
as industrial engineers. As students who
seriously want to prepare themselves for
their chosen profession, it would be to your
best interests if you were to join your Pitt
chapter of the Society for Advancement of
Management. Our school chapter is at pres-
ent composed largely of students in Business
Administration, but it could offer as much
if not more to students in industrial engin-
eering because of the importance and em-
phasis placed on that field by the Society.
If any are interested in joining the S.A.M.
they can apply for membership at the Stu-
dent Desk, Ground Floor, C. L. An annual
fee of five dollars is the only major expense
involved. For further information call Matt
Cassady-(HA. 1-8235).

tact of the film holder with the object. The use of
wire, tape, wedges etc., can be used so that this
object is accomplished. The penetrameter is then
placed in its proper position. Often a number of
small and similar objects may be required to be
radiographed on one film, in which case they may
be attached directly to the film holder or mounted
on heavy cardboard. Any identification, letter-
ing or figures which may require reproduction
on the film, should be placed on the film holder
either around the object or between the object
and the film holder. Lead letters and figures
have proved to be excellent for this application.

   Since the rays from radium go out from the
capsule in all directions, small castings may be
grouped around the radium capsule in all direc-
tions at the required distances such as shown in
Figure 3.
   There are often an infinite number of ways of
placing radium and films to radiograph a large
object. To choose the proper technique from the
many possible ones is sometimes of considerable
importance; the wrong choice may multiply the
cost or time required many fold.
   The chart in figure 2 illustrates the exposure
times required with varying distances at a source
intensity of 100 milligrams or radium. The chart
indicates the correct exposure for steel with a
given source for varying thickness at distances
ranging from six to forty-eight inches. The ex-
posure time varies inversely with the amount of
radium used. Therefore, the exposure required
when 200 milligrams are used would be one-half
those given in the chart for 100 milligrams. To
obtain the required exposure for any thickness of
steel it is only necessary to follow a horizontal
line, indicating the thickness of steel to be pene-
trated, across the chart until it intersects the
diagonal line representing the distance from ra-
dium to film that is to be used. A vertical line
extending from this point to the lower margin of
the chart will indicate the necessary exposure in
hours. It should also be noted that exposure time
varies directly with the density of the material to
be radiographed. This makes it possible then to
use this chart for other materials by multiplying
values found for steel by the ratio of density of
the material examined to the density of steel.
When distances other than those given are to be
used, the exposure necessary for a radium-to-film
distance of (D) can be obtained from the expo-

The Torrington Needle Bearing

The many lineal inches of contact
provided by the larger number of
small diameter rollers give the
Torrington Needle Bearing an un-
usually high load rating. In fact, a
Needle Bearing has greater radial
capacity in relation to its outside
diameter than any other type of
anti-friction bearing. This is illus-
trated in the table below, which

   Here is why locomotives are called

   They wear packets and yokes, pins,
 shields, and stays. They have sprung
 aprons and laps. Not only do they
 have shoes, but drag trains behind
 them. They also attract attention with
 puffs and mufflers, and sometimes
 refuse to work. At such times they
 need to be switched. They need guid-

 They all smoke and are much stead-

the fence?"
  "Sorry," replied St. Peter, "my men

When You Find the Work You Like



            STAY WITH IT!

GORDON W. CLOTHIER


THAT'S a good plan, but there's just one
   little catch in it; sometimes it takes a
good while to find the work that's right
for you. If you're worried about that,
perhaps my own experience will point out
a practical shortcut.
  I got my E. E. at the University of
Washington in 1935, and went on with
graduate work and teaching for another


other types of products and work at
Allis-Chalmers.
  In 1941 I became engineer in charge of
transformer sales, and in 1947 was made
manager of the transformer section.
  This field offers both challenges and
rewards. It needs and seeks men of su-
perior intelligence, imagination and crea-

      to detect flaws. Here a technician is setting up motor specimen for radiography.

year. Then-into the practical business
world. That's when I found the shortcut.
I enrolled in the Allis-Chalmers Graduate
Training Course in 1936, and very soon I
got interested in the big transformers. I've
been with them ever since, and they've
given me a lot in accomplishment and
satisfaction.
            Back to Stay
Of course, during two years in the Gradu-
ate Training Course I got around a good
deal in the big West Allis works. Had "
some time in the shops, got acquainted   '                T
with the work of many departments, tried
my hand at design, test, sales application
work. But I came right back to trans-
formers and have always been a lot more
satisfied because I'd seen a broad range of



   ALLIS-CHALMERS 4


tive ability-men who will strike out into
new paths of study and development.
  If you think a transformer is an inert
mass of iron and copper windings in a
tank of oil--look closer. There are ad-
vanced problems in magnetostriction that
if solved, will eliminate transformer hum
and revolutionize the business. It's the
same with problems in metallurgy, insula-
tion, measurement and control of electric
field shapes and the effects of time on
materials. Perhaps some young engineer,
even during his Graduate Training Course
days here, may make important contri-
butions. The opportunity is waiting.

     What Do You Want to Do?
It's the same in other departments at
Allis-Chalmers. Ore processing methods
and machinery-electronic equipment-
public works-steam turbine and genera-
tor design-hydraulics-manufacturing
-research-sales-they all hold oppor-
tunities. Here you'll have a chance, as a
Graduate Training Course engineer, to
look over the widest range of industrial
fields covered by any manufacturing firm
in the country. You can help plan your
own course, get advanced degrees. It's a
shortcut to finding the work ofyour choice.
  Write for information and literature, or
call on the Allis-Chalmers district office
in your locality.

  Advanced Production Techniques and

Experience-150 Years of It-Are Doing

    Big Things with Pressure Vessels

Although established in 1802, Scaife Company never has
allowed itself to "grow old." A unique combination of
engineering skill, production experience and modern
equipment-coupled with Scaife's intensive research pro-
gram-has resulted in many significant accomplishments
in the manufacture of pressure vessels for air, gases and
liquids. For example, one of the most interesting methods
of cold-forming metal in use in this country today is the
Scaife Reverse-Draw Process, a revolutionary method of
forming deep-drawn shapes.
      We invite engineers to contact our Personnel Director
      for information about the opportunities with the
      Scaife Company.


   The Scaife Reverse-Draw Process
Shown above are some of the deep-drawn
shapes that may be made by the Scaife
process, and the press employed for the
pressing operation. This is how it is done:


Starting with a circular
sheet of steel-

a cup is formed by a con-
ventional drawing opera-
tion.


A continuation of this
pressing operation turns
the cup "inside out" with-
out removing it from the
dies-

completing-in a single
stroke-the deep-drawn
shape.

INK FROM THE EDITOR'S PEN


   With registration six weeks behind us, and
the second semester now in full swing, spring
fever and the forthcoming baseball season team
up to make calculus, thermo, and TAM more dif-
ficult than ever. But if the student in Engineer-
ing or Mines can manage to overcome these ob-
stacles and still have a little ambition left, he will
find spring the season of golden opportunities.
   The most golden of these opportunities are the
 conventions which are so popular in March, April,
 and May. These conventions cover all phases of
 engineering and give any student who attends a
 chance to do a good turn for himself as well as
 his school. First, much is to be learned by at-
 tending these conventions. It gives you an op-
 portunity to get out and see how the other half
 lives, for a tour of the host school's campus is
 always a part of the program. Here you will see
 what some other school has to offer in the way
 of labs, curricula, and campus activities. In the
 past, these tours have opened the eyes of many
 Pitt men who have either bragged or complained
 about the facilities here at Pitt. From the bull
 sessions between meetings you will learn how
 other schools function, and bring back ideas that
 will add new life to your own campus organiza
 tion and broaden its program.
   Second, it gives you a chance to represent your
school. A large turnout by a school will nuicklv
identify it as a "live wire outfit", as the Pitt men
who attended the AIEE convention at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania and the Pi Tau Sigma Con-
vention at the University of Kentucky last fall
found out.
  Unfortunately, some instructors have been
known to hold reviews for major tests or cover
material that the student can't get himself upon
finding that a large number of their students
have found a convention more important than
their class. These instructors are apparantly too
short sighted to see that their position as lecturer
or professor at our schools carries no more pres-
tige than the name of the school itself. and the
missing students are helping to build that pres-
tige. Fortunately these incidents are relatively
rare, and we can only hope that in the future
they will cease.


   The third and most important aspect of a con-
 vention is the prize paper contest which is almost
 always the climax. These contests give you a
 chance to bring back the bacon for your school,
 and to a much larger extent for yourself. By
 merely entering such a contest you will put your
 name on the program and your face before a
 group of men who both now and in the future are
 the big wheels in your profession, and establish
 yourself as a competitor who is not afraid of
 competition. When you win a prize, your name
 and possibly your picture will appear in a pro-
 fessional journal where students, professional
 engineers, and future employers will see them.
 To make matters even better, the competition in
 these contests is not nearly as tough as you think.
 That paper you had to write for English 39, with
 a little expansion and research, can do very well.
   Speaking of research, there is no call for com-
 plaint about lack of facilities. True, there is
 much room for improvement in our existing lab-
 oratories, and the class of 1960 will be much bet-
 ter equipped than the classes of 1952-55. But
 there are many existing facilities in our present
 labs that most students fail to realize. A glance
 at the articles in the January and present issue
 of this ,magazine should quickly convince all
 Chemical and Mechanical engineers of this fact.
 The Metallurgical Engineering laboratory located
 on the ground floor of State Hall is our most out-
 standing engineering laboratory, and one of the
 best met labs in the country. A glance at the Elec-
 trical Engineering labs in Thaw Hall should con-
 vince any man in that department of his oppor-
 tunities. The same is true of the other depart-
 ments. Unfortunately, some instructors have
 been known to discourage research on the part of
 the student, but if you really want to work and
 have something worthwhile in mind, you will not
 be stopped.
   You can't spare the time for research or for the
 conventions? You can if you start planning now.
 Since most conventions are scheduled near the
 weekend the most that you will miss is two days'
 classes, which is a reasonable investment con-
 sidering the large return. Start in now to make
 your spring semester a worthwhile experience!

MIND OVER METAL ...                            THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM...


It's just a bit of cold metal, this piece of printers'
type ... worth about 350 a pound. Yet it is the
means by which an idea can be put on paper and
spread a millionfold.
  If America's printing presses were to stop, con-
sider what would happen . .. to our educational
system... to commerce... culture... commu-
nications ... to civilization itself.

PROGRESS UNLIMITED . . .
We've come a long way from the printing tech-
niques of the early Gutenberg 42-line Bible to
the phenomenally fast presses of today. Thou-
sands of craftsmen in the field of graphic arts
have contributed to your education, enjoyment
and enlightenment. Designers of hundreds of
type faces. Researchers in metals, inks, paper and
processes. And other skilled craftsmen utilize
these materials and processes to bring you the
printed word.
  The Business Magazines to which men look for
help with their jobs are an important segment of
America's all-seeing, all-hearing and reporting
Inter-Communications System.


Complete communication is the function, the
unique contribution of the American business
press ... a great group of specially edited maga-
zines devoted to the specialized work areas of
men who want to manage better, design better,
manufacture better, research better, sell better,
buy better.

WHY WE HAPPEN TO KNOW...
The McGraw-Hill business publications are a
part of this American Inter-Com System.
  As publishers, we know the consuming insist-
ence of editors on analyzing, interpreting and
reporting worth-while ideas.
  As publishers, we know that advertisers use
our business magazines to feature the products
and services which they offer in the interest of
increased efficiency, and lower production costs.
  As publishers, we know that people subscribe
to our business publications to keep abreast of
what's new in their field and in industry as a
whole. For the editorial pages tell "how" and the
advertising pages tell "with what."

Easy-On, Fast-Dry


CHEMICAL PROBLEM...                                                           i
  ... to help make enamels that
  combine fast drying and easy
  brushing-advantages not always
  found together in the two types
  of enamels most used today. One
  type of enamel brushes easier, the
  other dries faster.

SOLUTION...
   . . a new Hercules resin, Pen-
   talyn® B-56. It reacts chemically
   with the other paint ingredients
   to favor neither drying speed nor
   brushing qualities unduly, but to
   provide the very best combina-
   tion of both.

COLLEGE MEN...
   This is but one example of the
   far-reaching chemical develop-
   ments in which you could partici-
   pate at Hercules-in research,
   production, sales, or staff opera-
   tions. It suggests the ways Her-
   cules' products serve an ever-
   broadening range of industries
   and end-uses.                                ....,:i:iiii

   Hercules' business is solving problems by chemistry for industry...
          ... paper, rubber, insecticides, adhesives, soaps, detergents, plastics, paint, varnish, lacquer, textiles,
          to name a few, use Hercules® synthetic resins, cellulose products, chemical cotton, terpene chem-
          icals, rosin and rosin derivatives, chlorinated products, and other chemical processing materials.
          Hercules® explosives serve mining, quarrying, construction, seismograph projects everywhere.

The twelve-month project


that improved no-shift driving


ANOTHER ALCOA DEVELOPMENT STORY:
One automobile manufacturer set out to improve
his fluid coupling to the Nth degree.
  Torque converters had been made by machining
cast or forged blanks, or by assembling stamped
parts. But these engineers wanted better perform-
ance. This meant their converters must be stronger,
lighter, more intricate. They asked, "Can we do
it in aluminum?"
  Our Research specialists saw the chance to
show the economy of a little-known process called
plaster casting. A process in which plaster, instead
of sand, is used for cores to provide more intricate
and smoother castings-castings that require no
machining of the blades. It promised results that
might even exceed the auto maker's requirements.
  Final design refinements were made. Then we
cast the first samples. They came from the molds
smooth and clean-perfect in detail.


  While the auto manufacturer machined them
to finished dimensions, we set up to test them for
strength at high speeds. Coating the parts with
brittle lacquer, we spun them in our whirlpit up
to 10,000 rpm-over twice their normal operating
speed. Cracks in the brittle lacquer told us where
strains concentrated. Designs were modified. New
samples cast. Tests repeated. The final castings
are smooth, faithful in detail, exceed every
strength requirement.
  This is typical of the development jobs we do
at Alcoa. Others are under way now and more are
waiting for mechanical, metallurgical, electrical,
chemical and industrial engineers having the
imagineering skill to tackle them. Perhaps you
may be one of those men.
