PIPING FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS

BY THE MODEL TEST METHOD

by ROBERT W. JACKSON
Lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh

and Research Engineer, Pittsburgh Piping
& Equipment Co.

D uring the past decade the adoption of high
pressure-high temperature piping in steam,
oil, and chemical plant designs has brought a need
for large diameter pipe lines. Because of this
trend toward higher pressures and temperatures,
with a corresponding increase in the thermal e_x-
pansion to be provided for in pipe lines, the prob-
lems of taking up this expansion became increas-
ingly important. More accurate and reliable
methods of solving for stresses and reactions in
piping systems were found to be necessary.

Theoretically, the solutions for stresses and re-
actions in piping systems of any complexity, com-
posed of any number of different materials, and
subjected to any combination of temperatures,
can be obtained by a mathematical solution} This
type of solution remains a time consuming prob-
lem, even with all the simplifications that have
been published since W. H. Shipman first eased
the mathematical solution for single plane sys-
tems by a method using pre-integrated shape
coefficients?

Because of the high cost of materials and labor,
a more rapid and accurate method for obtaining
the end reaction of pipe systems_ was necessary.
During mathmetical calculations, engineers would
bend paper clips or pieces of wire to the shape of
the pipe system to visualize the end reactions.
Through this bending, some engineers conceived
the idea that by using a model, the solutions of
analyzing piping systems for flexibility character-
istics would be simplified.

At present there are three types of model test
units known to be in use for testing scale models
of high temperature pipes:

(1) Westinghouse Electric and Manufactur-
ing Company Unit3——end reactions are
measured with calibrated springs.4

(2) M. W. Kellogg Company Unit1—end re-
actions are measured with electrical
strain gages.5

(3) Pittsburgh Piping -and Equipment Com-
pany Unit—end reactions are measured
with electrical strain gages.

Through a fellowship grant by the Pittsburgh
Piping and Equipment Company, a device, which
is known as the “Six—Component Force Measur-
ing Unit,” was designed and built by the author.

DESCRIPTION OF TESTING DEVICE

This unit uses scale models for testing high
temperature piping and employs electrical strain  ,_
gages for measuring reactionary forces and mo- ._j~* ' 
ments exerted on the fixed end of the model.  I
These forces and moments are caused by the de-
flections of the free end of the model in the three
coordinate directions to some proportional amount
of the thermal expansion.

The moment arm, Fig. 1, which is attached se-
curely to the fixed end of the model, is supported
only by pivoted struts that are held in place by
the tension of the measuring heads. These meas-
uring heads, Fig. 2, consist of calibrated mem-

bers on which are mounted the electrical strain
gages. The measuring heads can measure forces
to a hundredth of a pound.

F/xso END or Moon

Moment arm which hold; the flxed end of the pipe.showino the six
equivalent forces, all of which can be measured.

FIG. I

The deflection or displacement of the free end
of the model in the three coordinate directions is
obtained by the movement of a micrometer cross-
head with a vertical micrometer attachment
mounted on the top of the crosshead. Dial indi-
cations measured in thousandths of an inch are
used to check the micrometer displacements. The
deflections at any other point along the piping
system are obtained with dial indicators.

The electrical strain gage on each measuring
head is connected to a multiple channel switch-
ing unit and it is in turn, connected to a Baldwin
SR-4 Portable Strain Indicator, Type L, from
which the strain readings are recorded.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SCALE MODEL TEST

The following procedure has been used by the
author in the piping flexibility analysis of high
temperature piping systems by the model test
method:

1. Presentation of the layout data sheet for

the actual pipe system.

2. Calculation of the model size and length

scale.

3. Presentation of the layout data sheet for

the model.

4. Fabrication of the model pipe system.

5. Testing of the model and recording test

data.

6. Converting test data of the model to the

actual pipe system. -

After the scale model of the pipe system has
been fabricated, the fixed end is placed in the mo-
ment arm and clamped securely to prevent any
rotations or linear movement between the moment
arm and the fixed end of the model. The next
step is to clamp the free end of the scale model
in the micrometer deflecting unit.

Each of the measuring heads on the “Six-Com- V

ponent Force Measuring Unit” is balanced, and
a zero load reading is recorded on special data
sheets. The free end of the model is then moved
some proportional amount of the thermal expan-
sion, and again the measuring heads are balanced.

THERMISTORS

AND

TEMPERATURE

COMPENSATIONS

HOWARD R. STILLWELL, EE, '52

E'ditor’s Note: This is a paper presented
to the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers at Mellon Institute, in com-
petition with papers from Penn State,
Carnegie Institute of Technology, and
the University of West Virginia. The
paper placed among the prize winners.

thermistor is a thermally sensitive electri-

cal conductor with a high negative tempera-

ture coefficient of resistance. Specifically, this

means that a rise in temperature of the ther-
mistor, the electrical resistance decreases.

This physical property of conductors is not
new; for both negative and positive temperature
sensitive electrical conductors have been known
to scientists for many years. Faraday reported
the measurement of a high negative temperature
coefficient of silver sulphide over-a century ago
(about 1834). Other European scientists, par-
ticularly the Germans and the English, studied
such temperature sensitive materials and made
resistors with both positive and negative tempera-
tures coefficients of resistance. The early nega-
tive types were made of uranium oxide. Magne-
sium-titanium oxides, and copper oxide were also
employed in following years. The fractional re-
sistance change, or temperature coefficient of
early negative types, was between 1.5% and 2.5%
per degree centigrade at 20°C; but major diffi-
culty in widespread use of the metallic oxides
with their high negative coefficients was the dif-
fig.-ulty'in producing them with stable character-
istics, fixed specifications, freedom from polari-
zation and other undersirable effects. Thermis-
tor units manufactured under apparently identi-
cal conditions had widely varying properties, and
in many cases the characteristics of the compon-
ents produced varied considerably with exposure
to moderate temperatures or with the passage of
current. Because of early manufacturing dif-
ficulties, the use of these devices was limited to
experimental work.

In the early nineteen-thirties, Bell Telephone
Laboratories sought a device to compensate for
the variations of resistance due to temperature
changes of telephone transmission lines. In
studying ‘the problems involved, they concentrated

18

on the properties of a few carefully selected basic
materials. As the result of several years of re-
search and development, chemically and electrical-
ly stable thermistors are now made in a wide
variety of shapes and sizes. They also have per-
manent electrical contacts, are mechanically
rugged, and cover a wide range of resistance, tem-
perature coefficients and power dissipation.

Uranium oxide was used in two early types of
thermistors designed for time delay circuit ap-
plications in the telephone system. Polarization
of uranium oxide in direct current circuits pre-
vents the use of these thermistors in direct‘ cur-
rent applications. The oxides of nickel, man-
ganese, and cobalt are suitable for both alternat-
ing current and direct current application.

Thermistors are manufactured by mixing the
suitable oxides with an organic binder and a sol-
vent. The mixture is then heated just to the point
of fusion of the metallic oxides. The solvent is
evaporated in the process. The resulting surface
is similar to the glazed surface on china ware.
The principal difficulty in the manufacture of
thermistors is in controlling the conditions under
which the oxide mixture is heated to the point of
fusion. .

There are five basic shapes of thermistors
being manufactured: beads, rods, disks, washers
and flakes. The bead is a thermistor suspended
by two leads in a glass envelope. The diameter
of the bead is less than two-tenths of an inch.
The rod thermistor can be compared to a stick of
pencil lead. It is less than two-tenths of an inch
in diameter and about one and one-fourth inches
in length. For the washer and disk thermistors,
the over-all dimensions are approximately equal,
the outside diameter varying from one-tenth of
an inch to seven-tenths of an inch and the thick-
ness being approximately one-tenth of an inch.
The flake thermistor is an experimental type in
which the oxide flakes are obtained by evapora-
tion. The flakes are very thin and have maximum
dimensions of less than one-tenth of an inch.
Figure (6) and Figure (7) illustrate the bead
type thermistor (A) and the disk thermistor
mounted and unmounted (B).

The most important physical property of ther-
mistors is the high negative temperature coef-
ficient of resistance. A typical thermistor cali-
bration curve is shown in Figure ( 1). The curve
was obtained by controlling the temperature of a
bath to within O.1°C. Resistance measurements

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

were made with a resistance bridge to an accuracy
of 0.5%. Both temperature and resistance read-
ings were taken on rising and falling bath tem-
peratures at each of the controlled temperature
points.

The calibration curve approaches a straight
line when plotted on semi-log paper. This sug-
gests an equation of the form y = be-ax Substi-
tuting the variables in question, the equation can
be written

K :: 10 C0 interval

Slope, Log Plot

Rt Rge K(T'To) ’ T O = initial temperature
R0 : initial resistance

Rt = Res. at temp. T

0 Since the curve can be considered linear for a

10°C interval, K can be determined directly from
the curve. By differentiating the above equation
it may be shown that:

1 d Rt
= —— x ———
Rt d T
For most thermistors

K = .04 -—.

More accurate equations have been used to de-
fine the resistance of a thermistor in terms of
temperature. For practical applications, how-
ever, the equations used here simplify the develop-
ment of the network equation which will be in-
troduced later.

Another characteristic is the static voltage-cur-
rent curve, Figure (2). The_ important feature
of this curve is the fact that a thermistor will
heat when a small amount of current is passed
through it. The thermistor will continue to heat
with an increase in current until a point is reach-
ed where the (IR) Voltage drop across the ther-
mistor begins to decrease. Since this system is
unstable, it is necessary to calibrate the thermis-

tor in series with a load resistor at the same cur-
rent which it will carry in some specific applica-
tion.

 

Due to the manufacturing difficulties previous-
ly mentioned, it is virtually impossible to secure
a thermistor which will meet definite specifica-
tions of over-all resistance and resistance varia-
tions needed in the circuit, and a simple network
circuit must be used to obtain these specifications.
A versatile circuit and a mathematical develop-
ment are illustrated below. The developed equa-
tions utilizing the network elements can match
definite specifications of over-all resistance and
resistance changes due to temperature variations.

UTILIZATION OF ABANDONED OPEN .
CUT MINES FOR DEFENSE NEEDS

E. R. PALOWITCH
Min. Engr., ’5l

ue to the unstable world conditions and the
D possibility of a mass air attack on vital in-
dustry by an agressor nation, much thought has
been given to the movement of strategic industry
underground. Should such an emergency de-
velop, the mining industry would be charged with
a large share of the responsibility. Although the
suggestions set forth here may not be applicable.
to all regions, it is felt that there are numerous
localities faced with the same problems as the
area here cited. I

In areas where iron, lead, salt, and similar min-
erals are mined, extensive underground excava-
tions of sufficient height and breadth lend them-
selves well to the movement of industry under-
ground with the minimum of time and expense.
But what of areas where only coal is mined and
hence have no large underground excavations
aside from those resulting from the normal min-
ing of the coal seam? Should the need arise,
where could local industry go; how long would it
take to get there; how much would it cost?

An example considered is at St.'Marys, Elk
County, Penna., where a sizable portion of the
carbon industry is centered. During the last war
this industry produced carbon products for a
variety of ‘military needs.

The underground excavations in this area are
limited to thicknesses ranging from 30 inches to
40 inches. It has been shown by experience that

it is impossible to brush the roof to make large
rooms available since the shaley overlying strata

will not permit excavations in excess of 15 feet
without extensive timbering. Some of the other
problems inherent to the utilization of old aband-
oned mines are the highly acidic mine water,
forced ventilation, high maintainance costs, and
crude transportation systems. To excavate, build_
a factory, and cover again would be a— costly and
time consuming project. In the St. Marys area
there are many miles of old abandoned open-cut
mines that follow the contours of the hills where
coal outcrops. They have these average dimin-
sions; width——100 feet, highwall—50 feet, spoil
pile—30 feet. The strata that is exposed is fairly
stable, only the mantle rock above the hardpan
being inclined to slide. A series of interconnect-
ing roads is built atop the spoil pile. These roads
cut through the spoil pile at various points, mak-
ing all points of the pit easily accessible.

Since the excavating is already done, the build-
ings could be built and covered over with the fill

MAY, 1951

from the spoil pile. This could be done by bull-
dozers getting downhill from the pit and pushing
the loose dirt on top of the building.

A proposed factory is shown on the accompany-
ing drawing. The building could be built either
continuously, or in separate units as needs indicat-
ed. It would be of simple design and construc-
tion. Piles would have to be driven through the
fireclay upon which I-beam columns would be set.
The walls and roof would be of reinforced con-
crete, waterproofed on the outside to prevent
seepage. Heating would be accomplished by gas
heating units hung from the ceiling or by a cen-
tral heating plant if gas were not available. Fresh
air would come in from the various passageways,
which would also serve as a means of ingress and
egress for employees and shipping and receiving
centers, and go out through ventilators.

Camouflage of these underground buildings
could be attained by either planting vegetation
and/or pushing trees atop the fill.

This paper does not attempt to answer the im-
portant problem of What to do in case industry is
threatened; it attempts only to suggest one idea
of what might be done in areas where conditions
aresimilar to the area cited.

Mr. E. A. Dines,

Acting Head, Mining Engineering Department,
University of Pittsburgh,

Pittsburgh 13, Pa.

Dear Mr. Dines:

The attached map and paper on Utilization
of Abandoned 0pen—cut Mines was given to me by Mr. Leffler
and I have just finished studying this report. It is
very interesting and I have no doubt but that something of
this type will be used in the very near future.

I am keeping a memorandum of this report,
as I shall probably contact you later concerning it.

Sincerely yours,

PIPING FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
(Continued from page 11)

The forces are obtained from calibration curves
of each measuring head by finding the differences
in the load values for the two sets of indicator
readings for each head. These model loads are
then converted to the actual pipe forces and mo-
ments.

CONVERSION OF MODEL REACTIONS
The values obtained by the “Six-Component
Force Measuring Unit” are the reactions of the
model and are denoted by Rx, Ry, Rz, Rxz, Rzx,
and Ryz. The model forces and moments‘ are
easily calculated. The positive directions are
taken as shown in Figue 1.
Px :_ Rx + Rzx — Rxy
Py :. Ry — Ryz

PZ : RZ

Mx : Ryzxd
My —_— Rzxxd
Mz = Rxyxd

where
P = Model Forces in pounds
M : Model moments in inch pounds 4
R = Unit reactions in pounds '

The conversion constants of changing the model
forces and moment to the actual pipe system’ are
found by applying the principle of similitude to
beam-deflection formula used in pipe calculations.

Force constant --

Moment constant —

where

P = Force on system

E :. Modulus of elasticity

I : Moment of inertia

: Deflection of free end

L 2 Length of system
Subscript In = Model
Subscript p = Actual pipe system

Since the end reactions are known, the calcula-
tion of bending moments throughout the remain-
der of the system is a relatively simple task.
Stresses are found by simple calculations and the
analysis of the system is complete.

The author expresses his gratitude to Professor
T. G. Beckwith and Professor N. Lewis Buck for
their suggestions and aid in the design of the
“Six-Component Force Measuring Unit.”

It should be noted that in its present stage of de-
velopment, a thermistor may not be the best com-
ponent to use in every application for which it
could be utilized. In infrared spectrometry, for
example, bolometers are more suitable than ther-
mistors because of their lower noise level and
stability.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

, Time. delay devices based on thermistors can be‘

controlled from several milliseconds to a number
of seconds, by utilizing thermistor current—time-
heating characteristics shown in Figure (2). As-
suming a one-milliampere relay were placed in a
circuit with the characteristics illustrated in Fig-
ure (3), the relay response could be controlled
from nine seconds to a fraction of a second.

An application in which the author has made
use of a thermistor was that of temperature com-
pensation in conductivity measurements. The
conductivity cell is located in one leg of a Wheat-
stone bridge, while the thermistor is placed in an
opposing leg in such a manner that any changes
in the resistence of the cell due to temperature
changes will be compensated by an identical
change in the thermistor network resistance. In
order that one thermistor could be used effective-
1y over a wide range of conductivities, and for
various temperature characteristics of electro-
lytes, it was found most useful to utilize the ther-
mistors in a resistance network consisting of a
variable resistor in parallel and another in series
with the thermistor. By proper adjustment of
the parallel and series resistors, the resistance of
the network could be made equal to the cell re-
sistance over a fairly wide temperature range as
described in detail previously.

In making conductivity measurements the re-
sistance of the cell can be accurately described by
an equation of the form

Rc‘:Rco (1 4' OCT)

where RC0 is the resistance at base temperature
To, and AT the difference from the base tem-
perature and the actual temperature at Which

measurements are made.

0( may be defined as the
per cent change in resistance per unit tempera-
ture change.

The use of a thermistor as a compensation com-
ponent of a circuit is shown in Figure (4). The
curve Re is of the form y = y (x). Therefore,
values were substituted in the equation Ra :
R3 -1- R” AT(Eq. (4),page 22 and the thermis-
tor network resistance values, R1 and R2 were
found. The thermistor network curve Ra, Fig-

ure (4) coincides with a conducting solution.

curve Rc from 25°C to 35°C. This means that
the thermistor will compensate for resistance

_ changes due to variations in temperature in the

solution between 25°C and 35°C. The curves il-
lustrated in Figure (4) were obtained by con-
tinuous recording of resistance variations due to
temperature changes. The resistance readings
were accurate to 0.5% and the bath temperature
controlled to within +O.1%°C. Temperature
readings were taken both on rising and falling
bath temperatures.

Curve A, Figure (5), illustrates the actual com-
pensating characteristics of a thermistor network

which was used in conjunction with the con-
tinuous recording of the conductivity of an elec-
trolyte. Curve B, Figure (5), is the variation in
conductivity over the same temperature range
without compensation.

Two methods of mounting thermistors for plac-
ing in a bath or pipe line are shown in Figure (6).
The well (C) is used for the disk-type thermistor
mounted on the plate (B).

The most important characteristics of thermis-
tors have been discussed. However, in consider.-
ing a thermistor for some specific application,
there are a few major points which should be em-
phasized. Thermistors have a high negative co-
efficient of resistance approximately .04 1 . Be-
cause of the high temperature coefficient of re-
sistance and the high manufacturing tolerence
of about +1572, thermistors must be used in con-
junction with a compensating network. They
have a wide range of application, although ther-
mistors are limited in their use in industry and
communication. There is considerable informa-
tion available in their physical properties, but
only a limited amount on their applications, thus

leaving a wide range of openings for further de-
velopments.

he students, Engineering and Mines
Association, and staff of The Sky-

scraper Engineer Wish to take this op-
portunity to express their gratitude to the
Publications Board of the University of Pitts-
burgh, the Dean and Department Heads of the
School of Engineering and Mines, the Faculty
Advisors of this magazine, the editors of the
Pitt Quarterly, Pitt News, Pitt Panther, and
Carnegie Technical of the Carnegie Institute
of Technology, and the advertisers for their
support, council, and encouragement Which
aided so materially in the publishing of this
initial issue of The Skyscraper Engineer.

his is the first issue of a new enterprise at

Pitt. This undertaking has been desired and
even attempted many times, but was never com-
pleted until this year. In order to acquaint the
reader with the difficulties encountered and the
goals attained I state the following.

In 1925 one issue of a technical magazine was
published. The reasons for discontinuing this
magazine are not generally known. Approxi-
mately three years ago, in 1947, an attempt was
made to publish another technical magazine. At
that time the Dean of the Engineering School felt
that the project should not be undertaken. Even
though he was very much in favor of a technical
magazine, he felt that because of the accelerated
program a satisfactory magazine could not be
published.

In May, 1950, the Engineering and Mines Asso-
ciation appointed Roy Neer chairman of its maga-
zine committee. Mr. Neer made a long investiga-
tion and in December, 1950, the details were pre-
sented to the department heads at a staff meeting.

A vote was taken by these men and the result
at that time was six to two against the project
mainly because of the world crisis.

In January, 1951, Mr. Neer was graduated and
submitted a complete report of his findings to the
Engineering and Mines Association.

In February, 1951, the present editor was ap-
pointed. A staff was organized and a plan of
attack established.

Several months were spent finding solutions
to the objections encountered. Financial backing
was obtained and material collected for publica-
tion. When sufficient data had been collected to
prove beyond a doubt the practical feasibility of a

MAY, 1951

INK FROM THE EDITOR'S PEN

technical journal at the University of Pittsburgh,
the findings were presented to the department
heads on May 9, 1951. The vote was unanimously
in favor of the magazine, and for publishing the
first issue May, 1951. One day later the project
was approved by the Board of Publications of the
University, and the magazine was an official
publication.

The purpose of the magazine is five fold:

1. To fill a need expressed by the students
of the school of Engineering and Mines.

2. To stimulate interest in research and
original investigation.

3. To create a closer contact between alumni
and undergraduates.

4. To disseminate news of engineering ac-
tivities to all engineering departments.

5. To increase the prestige of our engineer-
ing school.

The publication is primarily a student publica-
tion. Its first purpose is to serve the needs of the
student and to better his status through the me-
dium of technical expression. The magazine will

also provide a better cohesive bond between de-
partments through its activities page.

Keeping these points in mind the students must
not let the project fail. Each issue must excel its
predecessor and student support must be unani-
mous.

If the aforementioned five points are continual-
ly kept in mind and keen foresight exercised as
to their attainment, the Skyscraper Engineer can
become a creditable magazine to a great univer-
sity.

IN THIS ISSUE

An appropriate article, "To Our Future Engineers", has been written by
Mr. Blackburn in an effort to assist us in the launching of a new magazine.

Dr. Allen gives a brief survey of the history and operation of Pitt's
Cyclotron. We learn that our "atom smasher” compares with the best of
them.

Piping flexibility analysis has become a new test method that enables
high temperature piping strains to be studied by means of scale models
using suitable loads to create equivalent thermal stresses. This procedure
can be done at a considerable saving and has been under investigation for
several years at the University.

Mr. Busse, an instructor in the evening school, has become a pioneer
on theatre—television and has engineered the installation of screen TV at
the Fulton Theatre here in Pittsburgh.

Mr. Stillwell, an electrical engineering student who is also affiliated
with the Mellon Institute, has presented several papers which have won
prizes two successive years at the AIRE conferences. Presented here is
last year's prize paper on thermistors. I

A heretofore unthought of use for the unsightly canyons left by strip
mines draglines has been investigated by Mr. Palowitch. This paper was
presented to the U. S. Bureau of Mines and received favorable comment.

IN THE NEXT ISSUE

The first fall issue will feature a synopsis of gas turbine development,
an interesting story of the University of Pittsburgh's own coal mine, and an
account of our 275 mile per hour wind tunnel.

n our chosen profession all of us are in-

__ -terested in the various facets that make up
the field of our careers. While the profession of
Engineering is primarily centered on our academ-
ic education and on our experience in its prac-
tice, other factors of social and economic import
must not be overlooked in the development of a
true appreciation of the vocation you have select-
ed for your life’s work.

Most of us are aware that in so far as our col-
leges and universities are concerned the profes-
sion of engineering received its educational im-
petus about the turn of the Century. Prior to

that time few baccalaureate degrees were con-

ferred in engineering; instead, only the study of

the physical sciences received recognition. How-
ever, for the past fifty odd years the study of en-
gineering, that is, the study of the practical ap-

plication of the physical sciences, has received‘

increasingly more attention in the educational

centers of the ‘country. Now universities give,

many different engineering degrees in order to
fill the needs of the many specialized types of
engineering endeavors created by our highly de-
veloped industrial state.

As is apparent the educational institutions have
successfully met the challenge of our industrial
system by turning out the technically qualified
craftsmen required to turn the wheels of our
industrial machine. It is not so evident that the
training of engineers has been as complete in the
social and professional phases so necessary for
their complete development. The educational
facilities of the country are now realizing the
necessity of additional training in order to pro-
perly fit the embryo engineer into his proper
niche in society. Some schools have felt that five-
year curricula is the answer; others have expand-
ed their 4-year study to encompass some of the
social and economic courses. The problem has
been attacked realistically and engineers of the
future will have better backgrounds to meet the
ever-changing requirements of our society’s eco-
nomy.

In the past the term “engineer” has been rather
loosely used to designate almost anyone who would
like to cloak himself with technical competence in
his field. This tendency is high subtle praise to
the engineering profession for their success in
establishing professional qualifications of suffi-

cient degree as to encourage imitation. Never-
theless such usage must be treated by engineers in
the same manner that “quacks” and “shysters”
are treated in other professions. Engineering is
also irrevocably interwoven with the protection of
life, health, rights, and property. For these rea-
sons an dothers equally important all states have
enacted laws registering and defining the practice
of engineering. Our Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
Vania “Professional Engineers Registrat-ion'Law”,
Act No. 367, under Section 3, proclaims as fol-
lows:

“Practice of Engineering or Surveying With-
out Licensure and Registration Prohibited.
In order to safeguard life, health or property
and to promote the general welfare, it is un-
lawful for any person to engage, or to offer
to engage in the practice of engineering in
this Commonwealth, unless he is licensed and
registered under the laws of this Common-
wealth as a professional engineer, or for any
person to engage or to offer to engage in
the laws of this Commonwealth as a surveyor,
or as a professional engineer. It is unlawful
for any person to use in connection with his
name or to otherwise assume, use or adver-
tise any title or description tending to convey
the impression that he is a professional en-
gineer, or a surveyor, or that he is engaged
in the practice of engineering or surveying
unless such person is licensed and registered
with the board.”

As you can see from the above every effort is.

being made in your behalf so that you can prac-
tice in your chosen profession safe from unquali-
fied and unscrupulous competition and with your
title esteemed by your fellow men. These efforts
to enhance the social and economic status of our
profession have been a result of the unselfish
work of many engineers in all branches of the
profession working together to raise our profes-
sional standards and to achieve economic and
social benefits commensurate with our contribu-
tion to society. We are sure that you also will
work toward the betterment of your profession
and that the future status of engineers will give
evidence of your success.

In a society of humans there are few things
that can remain static or stationary. The bene-
fits and respect due a profession can only be re-
tained by diligent work and constant vigilance.
We are confident that the interest and enthusiasm
that you will show in the practice of your profes-
sion, both in the technical and professional phases,
will result in a continued improvement of the
overall status of engineers.

The development of our industrial establish-
ment over the past 20 years has witnessed the rise

of labor unions. These unions, while undoubtedly
serving well the causes of labor, have sought to
extend their field of operations to include the
technicians, engineering craftsmen and even en-
gineers. The duties of a professional engineer,
whether in industry or private practice, are not
compatible with membership in a labor union.
Engineers by the very nature of their work in
overseeing the design of plant expansion, develop-
ing process manipulation, synchronizing the flow
of plant materials, and their many other varied
duties, are an important part of management.
It is true that a young engineer’s share in man-
agement is small during his early professional
career, but in a relatively short time his work be-
comes of sufficient importance to make him a
valuable asset to management. In fact, the Na-
tional Society of Professional Engineers has taken
cognizance of this situation and has declared un-
der a “Statement of Principles” the following:
“1. It is definitely unprofessional for a pro-
fessional engineer, professionally employed,
VOLUNTARILY to join a heterogeneous la-
bor union, dominated by, or obligated to, non-
professional groups. As stated by the So-
ciety, through its Board of Directors at Okla-
homa City in September 1948, “The indivi-
dual responsibility and independent judg-
ment required of a Professional Engineer are
- incompatible with the regimentation funda-
mentally inherent in unionization.”
Nothing in this statement of principle shall
be construed as a criticism of engineers
who may be forced to join a labor union,
against their will, but engineers in this
predicament should seek to extricate them-
selves by due process of law.
Nothing in this statement of principle shall
be construed as a criticism of engineers-in-
training, who voluntarily join a labor union
when, as a step in their practical engineer-
ing training, they are temporarily employ-
ed in nonprofessional or subprofessional
work, where their fellow workers are or-
ganized. When promoted to professional
responsibilities, however, the engineer can-
not continue his labor union affiliations
without sacrifice of professional status.”
The opportunities for engineers and their es-
teem in the public mind have never been greater
than in the present decade. Therefore it behooves
all young engineers to strive for professional
competence as well as technical competence. The
first step in this direction is the registration un-
der the law of the Commonwealth as an Engineer-
in-Training. This step will place you firmly in

’ the path to becoming a Registered Professional

Engineer, a credit to the community and to the
profession.

THE CYCLOTRON LABORATORY

‘Ll_N|VRS|TY OF PITTSBURGH

by DR. A. J. ALLEN

E'ditor’s Note: Dr. Allen is the West-
inghouse Graduate Professor of Industry
and is also director of the Sarah Mellon
Scaife Laboratory.

he Sarah Mellon Scaife Cyclotron Labora-

tory of the University of Pittsburgh was
made a reality in 1942 by the generous gift of
Mrs. Scaife. The purpose of the Cyclotron Lab-
oratory was to stimulate the researchers in science
and nature in the University of Pittsburgh.

The building was constructed in the hillside—
3939 O’Hara Street——between the old Mellon In-
stitute and the Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic. During the last war it was used for Navy
headquarters and soon after the war was over
the construction of the Cyclotron was started.

The Cyclotron has been in operation for more
than three years and is now operating 24 hours a
day most of the time. The Cyclotron produces
high energy particles: 8 million electron volt Pro-
tons, 16 million Deutrons and 32 million volt
Alpha particles. These high energy particles are
being used in fundamental research to determine
the forces of structure of the nucleus of the atoms.
For instance, it is not well understood how two
protons and two neutrons can be put together in
a nucleus to make helium. If this process could
be efficiently carried out it would be a tremen-
dous source of atomic power. Fundamental
studies of this nature are being financed by the
Office of Naval Research.

The funds provided by the Navy enable us to
purchase the elaborate physical equipment re-
quired for this work and also provide funds for
supporting a number of graduate students who
are doing their Ph.D. research theses. They also
provide part—time employment for other students

who operate the Cyclotron and do technical work
around the laboratory.

The facilities of the laboratory are available to

numerous industrial concerns in the Pittsburgh
area. A number of studies on the properties of
glass are being investigated in the Pittsburgh
Plate Glass Company’s laboratory, using the facil-
ities of the Cyclotron Laboratory. Important
studies on the development of an atomic reactor
at the Westinghouse Reactor Division are being
facilitated by the use of our Cyclotron Laboratory.

There are certain isotopes which cannot be
manufactured in the atomic piles of the Atomic
Energy Commission, and we have been supplying
a number of these radio-active isotopes to the
Atomic Energy Commission so that they may in
turn distribute them throughout the United States
to various physical, biological and medical re-
searchers. A great many isotopes are supplied
directly to a number of organizations in the Pitts-
burgh area to various researchers.

When radioactive phosphorus and iodine were
not available from the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, they were manufactured with our cyclotron
and supplied to our Medical School for research
in and treatment of diseases. Short-lived isotopes,
which cannot be procured from the Atomic En-

MAY, 1951

ergy Commission, are also being manufactured
for local researchers.

. A project, in cooperation with the Addision H.
Gibson Laboratories, for studying the production
of cataracts in animals with carefully measured
doses of high energy neutron, is being carried on
and is supported by the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion.

Recently a shielded room buried in the hillside,
was provided by the Sarah Mellon Scaife Founda-
tion for carrying on a fundamental research pro-
gram on the precision scattering of nuclear par-
ticles. The facilities of this laboratory are unique
in that they are not available in any other lab-
oratories.

Within the past year, The Sarah Mellon Scaife
Foundation again provided funds for additional
space to carry on our many researches. The
space was provided by making a rather elaborate
addition to our original building. The building
is now occupied by a staff of more than thirty
people, consisting of university professors, grad-
uate students, under-graduate students, techni-
cians and others. They are all very busy carrying
on research, providing well trained graduate stu-
dents and enlightening civilization as to the many
secrets of nature.
