The  Solution

Rapid, reliable methods for solving chemical equilibrium
equations have long been sought by scientists asleing fundamental
questions about systems as varied as the atmosphere, the human
body and the internal combustion engine. An interdisciplinary
collaboration at the General Motors Research Laboratories has
produced a breakthrough with potentially universal applications.

V‘/IHEREVER CHEMISTRY is
involved, the need to

solve chemical equilibrium equations

arises. Although methods for solv-

ing such equations have existed for
some time, they do not offer the

speed demanded by the most chal-
lenging problems. For example, pre-

dicting the composition of gases
inside an engine cylinder may require
as many as a million equilibrium

calculations per cycle. Two research-

ers at the General Motors Research
Laboratories have developed a sys-

tematic way to reduce the mathe-

matical complexity in these problems,
thus making it possible to solve
them rapidly.

Chemical equilibrium occurs
when the rates of a forward and

reverse reaction are equal. Mathe-

matically, this statement usually

translates into a system of nonlin-

 

 

 

ear polynominal equations. Until

now, there has been no fast reli-
able method for solving such systems.

Solutions to particular problems

have demanded thorough familiar-

ity with the physical conditions. In

most cases, this means partial knowl-

edge of the answer.
Dr. Keith Meintjes of the Fluid
Mechanics Department and Dr.

Alexander Morgan of the Mathe-

matics Department began their
research by considering recent

advances in the theory of continua-

tion methods. They concluded that
a suitable continuation algorithm

could be relied on to solve the non-

linear polynomial equations that
make up chemical equilibrium

systems. In this insight lies the real-

ization that the solution can be
obtained without any knowledge of

the physical nature of the problem.

In seeking the most efficient
implementation of the continuation
method, the researchers discovered
that chemical equilibrium equations
can always be systematically reduced

to a substantially simpler mathe-

matical form. The reduced systems
have fewer unknowns and a smaller
total degree. The total degree of
any system is the product of the

degrees of each of its equations.

Reducing the total degree makes a
system easier to solve. A typical

combustion problem with ten equa-

tions and total degree of 192 was
reduced by the researchers to two
cubic equations with a total degree
of nine.

The reduced systems can then
be systematically scaled to fit within
the limits imposed by computer

arithmetic. The range of coefficients

in chemical equilibrium systems

tends to be too large or too small

for the arithmetic of the computer.

Consequently, the solution process

can fail. By construction of an effec-
tive scaling algorithm, this arith-
metic constraint can be eliminated.
Suitably reduced and scaled, the

equilibrium systems can then be

solved reliably by the continuation

method.

IHUS, Drs. Meintjes and Morgan
accomplished their original

goal of developing an innovative
reliable approach to solving chemi-
cal equilibrium equations. They
also made a final, unexpected dis-
covery. Certain standard solution
techniques, which fail on the origi-
nal systems, can be made absolutely
reliable when applied to the reduced
and scaled systems. These methods,
which are variants of Newton’s
method, are also many times faster
than continuation. '

This research has produced
an extremely effective solution
s_trategy—reduction of the equa-
tions, followed by scaling of the
reduced systems, followed by the
application of a suitable variant of
Newton’s method. The simplifica-
tion of the systems, which was origi-
nally formulated to facilitate the
implementation of the continuation
method, proved to be the critical
factor enabling the use of fast tech-
niques.

In one application, the chemi-
cal equilibrium calculations are part
of a model which predicts details

of the flow, turbulence, and com-
bustion processes inside an engine.

By using their methodology to
develop an equilibrium solver for
this application, the researchers

greatly increased the model’s solu-

tion efficiency (see Figure 1).

“It was the characteristic struc-

ture of equilibrium equationsj’ says
Dr. Meintjes, “that allowed us to

perform the reduction. The unex-

pected mathematical simplicity of
the reduced systems suggests that

even more efficient solution meth-

ods may be discoveredi’

“Critical to this research? says
Dr. Morgan, “was the dialogue
between disciplines. I hope that this
dialogue will continue as scientists
and engineers in diverse fields
explore the capabilities of this new
methodology.”

The newest restaurant in Oakland is Primanti Bros.,
conveniently located (for Pitt students) on Forbes Ave. bet-
ween Bouquet St. and Oakland Ave. The atmosphere is
in the tradition of the original Primanti Bros., which is in
Pittsburgh’s Strip District. It is open late and serves
breakfast dishes as well as lunch or dinner.

When asked what makes Primanti Bros. diffferent
from other food spots in the area, staff member Bill
Vollberg replied, “Originality.” He went on to explain that
while most fast food places are structured, Primanti Bros.
has a different, more “upbeat atmosphere” which is loose
and relaxed.

This is evident when entering the restaurant and plac-
ing an order. The pleasant setting includes seats at a
counter as well as many tables. An open balcony above
the main dining room allows room for many to sit. The ser-
vice is both friendly and personal.

The Primanti Bros. menu is an extensive one.
Breakfast offerings include eggs, toast, bacon and similar
items, but breakfast is just the beginning. The restaurant
also serves soup and chili. As far as drinks go, Primanti’s
offers everything from Coke and coffee to fruit juices or
cold six-packs of beer. The main attraction at Primanti
Bros., however, is its list of sandwiches. The restaurant
serves just about every type of sandwich one could
possibly think of (there are nearly 20 of them) and each
one includes tomato and (to my surprise) cole slaw and
french fried potatoes. This idea originates with the original
Primanti Bros. restaurant and is a welcome change from
the usual pickles and onions. The resulting creation is
quite good.

Primanti Bros. is open Monday through Wednesday
from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m., Thursday and Friday from 7 a.m.
to 4 a.m., and Saturday from 7 a.m. to 4 a.m. Prices are
moderate (sandwiches average around $2.25) and the
food is well worth the trip.

Chinese food on a college student's budget? A Viet-
namese repast for lunch or a between class break? The
Wok Inn, located at 370 Atwood Street in south Oakland,
combines the best of the two worlds of Chinese and Viet-
namese cuisine for an informal dining experience. For a
change of pace for a dinner with your date, to impress
your parents, or just for yourself, the Wok Inn is a perfect
place to get away from the hubub of Oakland for a while.
The restaurant offers an interesting alternative at prices
comparable to a fast food meal of a hamburger, french
fries, and beverage.

The owner, Bikki Kachhar, a native of India, original-
ly intended to begin a restaurant specializing in food from
his own country. A Vietnamese woman, Ty Thi Tran, who
was negotiating for the same location, suggested joining
forces and opening The Wok Inn as a joint venture. By
September 7, 1983, its doors were opened and the Inn
was offering such tempting dishes as shrimp with lobster
sauce, sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, and beef
with lemon grass. The house speciality is peking duck,

 

if seafood, beef, pork or chicken don’t tickle your
tastebuds. The prices for these elaborate sounding dishes
range from an average of $3.50 for lunch to about $5.25
for supper. '

From the outside, The Wok Inn appears nothing more
than a small restaurant trying to make a go of it in a big
city. But inside, the combination of paneling and red cloth-
lined walls, offset by chinese magical lanterns on the cell-
ing, gives one a feeling of walking into someplace special.
The overall atmosphere is a rather informal, homey one.
The waiters and waitresses make one feel right at home.
The food is cooked on order, so all dishes can be made
to suit one’s own taste—one can have more spice added,
less spice, or a different type of seasoning. Diners can
virtually write their own recipe, which is a bit more than
one can say for McDona|d’s!

No Chinese restaurant is complete without won ton
soup, egg rolls, and fortune cookies! These can be
ordered either with the meal, or as a meal in themselves.

The Wok Inn also has take out service, so some night
when you’ve had it with pizza or the Towers cafe but still
want to stay at home—the Wok Inn may be the answer!

The restaurant hours are Monday to Friday from
11:30-2:30 for lunch and 4:30-9:30 for supper. On Satur-
day and Sunday it is open from 4:00-9:30.

Chapter Four

by Joe Samosky

You know the story. lt’s several weeks into the term
and you’ve finally reached it: Chapter Four. It seems that
every textbook in the sciences and engineering has a
Chapter Four, although it isn’t always the fourth chapter
of the book. Usually, however, it goes something like this...

4.1 Introduction

Up until now in our development of statistical quan-
tum anthropomorphism we have relied on a rather intuitive
approach. In this chapter and the next we will present the
mathematical background underlying the examples
presented in chapters two and three. The authors assume
that the student has had no previous experience with
quantum anthropomorphic vector space transformations,
except for an introductory course in the multivariate vec-
tor calculus of complex hyperbolic spheroids, taken in the
freshman or sophomore years.

4.2 Notational Conventions

A complete explanation of the symbolic notation used
in the following development may be found in
“Gersp|atzen Frumblebach uben Vierdenthalen und
lschengargen,” J. Steinman et al., Annalen der Physike,
Vol. 3, No. 2 (1874). The authors have made minor
modifications to this system. These changes are discuss-
ed in Appendix K of the supplementary text Quantum An-
thropomorphism - A Simple Approach. The conventions
are not rigid, however, and students are encouraged to
fabricate their own symbols at will, as we will frequently
do.

4.3 Derivation of Antoliodore’s Equation

We begin with the equation of poikilothermic elec-
trostatics, the experimental derivation of which is found
in Chapter 11:

M1p = Kzx (1)

Rearranging, we obtain

M1
K2

x = P (2)

We now multiply both sides of equation (2) by the permit-
tivity of free space, eo:

M1
ex=e p 3
o 0K2 ()

Through simple algebraic manipulation we obtain

(x1x2)2 p4 sin-1\lx2 - p2

_ = (4)
3M1K2/eo Cosh-1 3X-(Z K2
4 M1

The intermediate steps above are left as an exercise for
the reader (Problem 4.4a).

We now state as fact the following equation, the proof
of which is beyond the scope of this text‘:

2 = 3 (5)  
Squaring both sides,
4 = 9 (6)
and multiplying by the permittivity of free space, eo:
4eo = 9eo (7)

Finally, we multiply and divide equation (7) by Avogadro’s
number (NA = 6023-1023) and raise both sides to the
power numerically equal to the price per pound of bananas
(expressed in drachmas) in Helsinki, Finland on July 23,
1972. (This last quantity, Svordenbjorg’s constant, is an
empirically derived value discussed more fully in the
preface to the supplementary text Basic Statistical Quan-
tum Anthropomorphism for the Life and Social Sciences
— Second Edition.)

23.4 23.4

NA 4e0 = _ NA 9eO (8)
NA NA.

\

Substituting the above into equation (4) we obtain the
desired relation, Antoliodore’s equation, which will lead
directly to the proof of the Mcworthstead-Landellier
Theorem.

X = CP (9)

Where C = M1/K2.

to Applied Arithmetic," B. Mugglesdorf, Journal of Applied Mathematics,
Vol. 56, No. 9 (1969).

Figure 1

Expressed in words, equation (9) states that x is
directly dependent on p. That is, if p increases in value,
x also increases. It is also true that if p decreases in value,
x will decrease. Finally, it can be shown from (9) that if
p remains constant, so will x. The reader should convince
himself or herself of the above assertions before
proceeding.

4.4 Proof of the Mcworthstead-Landellier
Theorem.

With these concepts now mastered, we proceed with
our proof of what is the most fundamental principle of
statistical quantum anthropomorphism, the
McWorthstead-Landellier Theorem (MLT). A formal
mathematical statement of the MLT is rather abstract, and
beyond the scope of this introductory discussion. In sim-

' ple terms, the theorem asserts that if, in a suitable rec-

tangularly tesselated region of n-dimensional an-
thropomorphic vector space, a counter current mass flow
function satisfies boundary conditions so as to ensure
compliance with the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for any
chosen combination of state-transition subsets, then the
closed line integral in n-space around a loop of Henle
(starting at a singularity point and proceeding clockwise)
will be identically equal to zero. In other words, if a counter
current mass flow function satisfies the Cauchy-Schwartz
inequality compatible boundary conditions (for any chosen
combination of state-transition subsets) in an appropriate
rectangular/y tesselated region of anthropomorphic vec-
tor n-space, then the closed n-space line integral from a
singularity point clockwise around a loop of Henle will
equal zero, identically. lntuitively, this implies that the en-
tropy of the universe increases for any spontaneous pro-
cess. (The proof of this is left as a supplementary exer-
cise for the reader.)

We shall only demonstrate the proof of the MLT for
3-space; the extrapolation to higher dimensional spaces
should be obvious. Figure 1(a) shows the standard i-x-p
convention for our three coordinate axes. Note that each
axis is at an angle of 90 degrees (a right angle) to each
of the other two. They are said to be orthogonal (From the
Greek orthogonios: ortho - straight, right, true; gonia -

angle. Similar to the Gothic gawrisqan - to bring fruit, or
the Sanskrit urdhva - upright or high, and vardhate - he
increases.) Note also that rotation from axis i to axis x
gives axis p by the right-hand rule: the coordinate system
is said to be right-handed. We use dotted lines to show
the negative portions of the axes, solid lines to show the
positive regions. Finally, note that the i axis is directed
upward, the p axis to the right and the x axis is directed
out of the plane of the page.

Next we graph Anto|iodore’s Equation (9) in Figure
1(b)2. C has been chosen as an arbitrary positive con-
stant. The reader should observe the direct dependence
of x upon p, as was previously described. Note that the
slope of the line (defined as rise/run) is equal to C, and
that the line passes through the origin at point 0 (where
(x,i,p) = (O, 0, 0)).

If the reader has been attentive and has closely
followed the discussion to this point, the remaining steps
in the proof should be clear. Omitting the intermediate
algebra, we illustrate the result in Figure 1(c)3. The
singularity points are indicated at A and B, with the loop
of Henle designated by /. Clearly, the closed clockwise
line integral around the loop will equal zero (identically),
thus establishing our proof (Q.E.D.).

4.5 Conclusion

In this chapter we have formalized some of the con-
cepts introduced in the first section of the text. An-
to|iodore’s Equation was developed and utilized in our
proof of the important Mcworthstead-Landellier Theorem.
Our approach was largely intuitive and nonmathematical,
in order to provide the student with an appreciation of the
simplicity and beauty of quantum anthropomorphic prin-
ciples. Readers desiring a more rigorous foundation in the
material presented are referred to Chapter Four of the sup-
plementary text Statistical Quantum Anthropomorphism:
What More Can Be Said? (Second Edition).

2The i and x axes have been interchanged and the positive and negative
regions of the graph have been switched in the illustration for the sake
of clarity.

3Note that we have rotated the principle axes and redesignated the
original x-i-p axes as s-r-j so as to avoid confusion.

The End of Nasty Decimals

by David King

Changing a fraction to a decimal is a function easily
performed with a calculator, computer, slide rule or
some mental activity. Reversing the process, however,
can provide afew difficulties and take up a bit oftime. A
simple solution can be obtained by placing the decimal
valve over an appropriate power of ten. Problems in
reduction, however, make this method less than effi-
cient. The desire to solve this trivial problem led to the
following method of decimal to fraction conversion.

To simplify the explanation that follows, it will be
assumed thatthe fraction is less than one. The method,
however, will be applicable to fractions greater than
one. To start off, the general format of the fraction will
be rearranged.

Any fraction is in the form of a numerator over a
denominator. If both numerator and denominator are
divided by the numerator, the fraction becomes one
divided by the denominator over the numerator. lfthe
denominator is greater than the numerator (stemming
from the original assumption), then the denominator
overthe numerator can be put in the form of an integer
plus a fraction. This fraction will be a new number over
the old numerator. Performing the same inversion to
this new fraction, and to succesive fractions, will put
the original fraction in the following form:

NUMO, 1 1

I N Z Z —
FRACTO 0 DENO DENO/NUMO INT1 + DEN,/NUMO

1 1

INT, + FRACTION, = N1 + _1:__
INT; + FRACTION;

Therefore:

ORIGINAL FRACTION =

INT, + 1

INT3 + 

+ 1/INTN
Where the fraction after N inversions is equal to zero.
Since any rational decimal will have some fractional
equivalent:

NUM 1

DECIMAL = =

1
DEN INT, +

INT; '1'

Starting with a decimal less than one, the fractional
equivalent can be found by first taking the inverse of
the decimal. This will yield a new decimal greater than
one. The numbers to the left of the decimal make up
the integer, used in the above equation, and the
decimal remaining, after this integer is removed, is the
new decimal.

1 1
DECIMALO = =

1/DECIMALO INT, + DECIMAL,
_ 1 1
INT + ——‘—_— 1
I lNT2 + DECIMAL2 ”“T‘ * ,
INT2 '1-
INT; + . . .
+ 1/INTN

Where the decimal after N inversions is equal to zero.

The integers, therefore, are obtained by inverting the
decimal (dividing the number one into it) and truncat-
ing the decimal after the decimal point. This truncated
decimal is inverted, the integer taken, and the new
truncated decimal is inverted. This process is repeated
until the truncated decimal is zero. For example, the
decimals 0.3125 and 0.71875 will by examined.

L = 1 + 0.25 I4 = 1

Therefore:

2 + 1 2 + I
1 + 1 1 ‘I’ 4l5
1 + ‘/4
= 1 = 1 = 
1 + 1 1 + 9/23

A problem comes into play with example II. Combin-
ing the fractions can get very cumbersome as “n” gets
large, with “n” being equal to the number of integers.
To simplify the procedure of converting the integers to
the numerator and denominator, an examination ofthe
process of combining the fractions is very beneficial,
combining In-1, and In will result in a newfraction which
will be |'n-1. Then combining |’n-1, In-2 and In will result in
|’n-2. This process is repeated until I'2, which is equal to
the numerator, and |’1, which is equal to the denomina-

tor, are found.

Starting the combining of fractions with the last

shown above, with the variable i being used to repres-
ent the various n’s.

defined as 1, where N is equal to the number of integers, and I’N = IN.

This program will only give an approximation forthe
more complex decimals. Since there will be inaccura-
cies in the calculations of the computer, “decima|" will
probably never equal zero. More accuarcy can be
achieved by decreasing the tolerance in line 100 (down
to a point) and increasing the allowable number of
integers (dimensioned in line 10, and as max limit in
line 30). The program will work for fractions greater
than 1. I1 becomes zero — but |’1 will have the correct
value. Decimals greater than 100, however, will not
work in this program becausethe inverse will result in a
number less than .01. Line 180 is used to compare the
original decimal with the fraction.

Though this has little significance in the grand
scheme of things, it does provide a simple method of
changing that nasty decimal into an elegant fraction.
Pi, using the above method, was approximated to be
355 over 113. A fraction could be reduced by changing
it to a decimal and then using this method to change it
back to a fraction. Other uses are limited only by the
imagination of the reader.

Brian laid the headset down on the bright acrylic
table and inhaled deeply on his cigarette. He could just
see the time on the telorex wall from where he sat and
thought to himself that he was a bit behind this after-
noon. It seemed this got more difficult every day.

“Play it back for me, Alex.”

“Yes, Brian.”

Alex read the spec out of his memory, a perfect
duplication of what Brian had done, and was annoyed
at having to stop in the middle.

“Just a bit more, Brian.” said Alex. He didn't want to
nag, but he'd noticed Brian’s moods lately and they
really needed this last spec for their current contract.
The company had been pressuring them and the last
thing they needed was another delay.

Yes, just a bit,” agreed Brian. Just get through this
one and go home, he thought. Just get through it.

He put the headset back on and rechecked the small
electrodes on the back of his head. he'd finish before
four easily, he thought.

“Record mode please, Alex.”

A few small lights on the tabletop changed their
colors as the machine switched to record. Brian went
to work. Although he was one the the most successful
spectrasense artists in history, Brian Coleridge looked

more like he was daydreaming when he was working
than anything else. He laid back and let his mind settle
on some random thought; Brian usually had to do little
else to produce quality work. The shapes and sounds
and colors of the spectrasense recording coalesced
out of the blackness of his imagination. Most people
(the census bureau said 98.7 percent) when attached
to a spectrasense recorder produced pure garbage.
The neuroscienists said it was like noisy radio recep-
tion, which was a pretty fair explanation, except forthe
fact that very few people listened to the radio anymore,
and that the analogy was lost on them. Most people
couldn’t understand why they couldn’t do what Brian
did so easily, and the neuroscientists couldn’t under-
stand it completely themselves.

What everyone did know was that there were certain
individuals who could create sensual impressions no
human being had ever experienced through the use of
the spectrasense recorders. Brian was one of them,
and his product was in demand.

‘‘I think that should do it, Alex"

‘‘I agree completely, Brian. Shall I send it to
production?”

“No, let it sit till tomorrow, just to make sure we both
feel good about it.”

“Fine”

Brian crushed out his cigarette and put his wire-
rimmed glasses on his nose. Glasses; he had abso-
lutely no need to wearthem since his corneas had been
corrected shortly after birth. He wore them anyway
because he liked them. Most people had so few per-
sonal possessions these days; Brian felt strangely
good about himself when he wore his glasses on the
street. His cigarettes were a rather odd habit, too. He
liked to watch the gray smoke fill his office, diffusing
the harsh lights while it searched for a hole in the
ceiling that wasn’t there. They weren't much good for
anything else. They didn’t even cause cancer.

Brian walked out into the street, bustling and noisy,
and enjoyed it. He walked, not too quickly, to thetube
station down the block from his office. He really didn’t
have to do this. He could be working at home like most
of the other hundred or so spectrasense composers,
but he liked the feeling of the confusion of the city. He
found the hum and buzz of the people exiting, child-
like, and it calmed him.

The ride out to his neighborhood was quick. Brian
said hello to his neighbors who didn’t answer and
checked his mailbox. He used to correspond with his
mother but he hadn't received a postal letter since she
had died. No harm in checking, though. No mail. How-
ever there were plenty of messages on the telorex for
his immediate attention, it told him. Brian asked it to be
quiet and it said yes, certainly it would.

Coat on the sofa and Brian in his spare room. Quite a

luxury it was, even though it was sparsely furnished. A
suppletouch chair and a lamp with an authentic incan-
descent bulb, and his antiques. Heturned on the lamp
and then switched on the large, heavy-looking black
box and the amplifier hummed and sputtered. Almost
sixty, the man had said. The instrument it gave life to
not quite as old. Brian’s guitar. Not many people risked
learning to play even a simple microsynth, let alone a
guitar.
Brian could hardly play it atall. The man he had bought
it from had shown him a few simple scales and chords,
but that was all. Brian was almost completely on his
own. No one to give him lessons, only a few books from
the library, and his tape which was more help than the
rest combined. Brian hated most of it. Violent sounds
that upset him. But there was one song on the tapethat
Brian seemed to know. It sounded so familiar, yet he
knew it was impossiblethat he had ever heard it before.
Brian didn’t even own any simple audio recordings.
But that song occupied a niche in his mind. The man
had called it “The Blues”. Brian had played thatsection
of the tape so often he was afraid he was going to wear
it out. He picked up the guitar and laid his hands on it to
make the right sounds. It was such a sensitive thing;
acutely aware of even the slightest touch. Sometimes
Brian thought that it was as alive as Alex, but it had
never once spoken to him. Maybe it would if he kept it
long enough. Even Alex had taken a week before he
had spoken to Brian. The man from the production
company had said Alex was the best that could be
gotten, but he was shy and would take some time to get
used to his new surroundings. Brian would give his
guitar as much time as it needed.

Brian was nearly in a rage; the song wouldn't come.
Frustration that consumed him. He could play every
note perfectly; he could bend the strings and the guitar
would scream, but it wasn’t right. It wasn’t even close.

Brian slammed the door and stomped down the
stairs, undoubtedly disturbing his neighbors. He
walked across the street to the small park that was
there. There were small parks in most of the neighbor-
hoods; small patches of grass with trees and shrubs
and convoluted concrete paths. Brian sat on a large
concrete bench and looked at the biggest tree in the
park. There was a woman sitting under it, small and
slight with soft brown hair and features that smiled
with a serene self confidence that Brian felt he was
lacking atthe moment. She was subjecting a dandelion
to mild torture as he walked over and introduced him-
self rather curtly, half expecting her to ignore him like
his neighbors or to even get up and leave. The chance
to talk to someone other than Alex for a change gave
him enough nerve to try, though.

“This is a very nice tree you have here," she said
before Brian could get past “Hello”.

“|t’s not exactly mine," Brian said.

“As much yours as anyone’s.”

“|’ve never seen you here before,” ventured Brian,
rather unaccustomed to making conversation. “Do
you live nearby?”

“Not near. Not far either," she said. “l’d heard there
was a nice tree here so I thought I'd come and see for
myself. This one’s one of the oldest in the develop-
ment, I’m told.’’

‘‘I wouldn't know one way or the other. I'm not really
an expert,” said Brian.

“As much an expert as me," she said.

The wind rustled the oak trees leaves, sending a few
floating to the ground near Brian and the woman.

“He’s speaking to us. He likes our conversation,”
said the woman.

“How do you know he’s not telling us to leave him
alone?” Brian asked.

“Because I don’t feel like Ieaving.”

A druid princess who can commune with the trees in
the park, mused Brian. He thought about making some
snide remark but it really wasn’tthe sort of thing he did.
Nobody talked to Brian very much; he'd never really
learned how to communicate with words. He always
wanted to get to know the people around him, but now
that he had the chance, he couldn't think of anything
interesting to say.

‘‘I don’t understand how your can say that so confi-
dently,” said Brian.

“I’m not trying to be mysterious,” said the druid. “lt's
just that I can't imagine this tree wanting us to do
anything but sit under it. I really don't think we’re that
offensive, do you?”

“No, I suppose not,” replied Brian. ‘‘It was a stupid
thing to say.”

“Not really. I’d bet most people wouldn't even think
about offending a tree. At least it shows that you care
about how you affect the world. That you are aware of
your impact.”

His impact. Did anybody realize the extent of Brian's
impact? The technology thatenabled Brian to produce
the spectrasense recordings was forty years old, and
the world was still reeling from it’s impact. The image-
making power and influence of Hollywood was a
whimper compared to the industry which had erupted
from this new tchnology, and the world’s idea of enter-
tainment had been changed forever.

The dicovery had been quiet enough. Neuroscient—
ists had discovered a wayto directly detact the incredi-
bly complex electrical impulses which make up
sensory impressions and were able to feed thse signals
into the brain of another person. The technology was
crude at first, only being able to transmit very simple
visual signals, but had improved to the point where
practically any sensation could be experienced by
someone connected to the machinery.

Strangely enough, it was discovered that although
most persons could easily have experiences
impressed on their minds by the machinery, very few

10

people had thought patterns that were structured in
such a way as to be easily detected and encoded for
transmission. There was no readily detectable pattern
to the sorts of people who possessed this necessary
arrangement. Intelligent and not so intelligent people,
artistic geniuses or creative clods could equally have
their impressions detected and encoded, although the
overall percentage of persons who could undergo the
process was very, very small.

For the one that were gifted enough, and lucky
enough to be able to use it, the technology offered an
unprecedented medium for expression. It was beyond
music, beyond words. The artist could create a com-
plete envelope of experience, a collection of sensa-
tions virtually indistinguishable from reality. It was
indistinguishable from reality and the unscrupulous
spectrasense artist could not only manipulate those
who experienced his creations, but mame them as
well. This sort of thing didn't happen very often nowa-

u‘—\--',

days, with laws governing the content of the spectra-
sense recordings, and machines like Alex who were
bright enough to know when a composer was record-
ing something dangerous. The decision was difficult-
some composers dwelled in the gray area between
sanity and madness; people differed in their ability to
cope with the flood of sensations offered them bytheir
spectrasense players. Sometimes, very rarely, one of
the spectrasense recorders, a machine very much like
Alex, would recognize and image which it decided
would be too terrible, too painful, too pleasant for an
average person to stand. And it would change the
recording just enough to get it by. The composers
were never informed, and the recorders were forbid-
den to tell when a change had been made. So no one
asked, and it bothered nobody.

Brian had never been censored by Alex or any other
recorder in his career. Brian didn't feel the need to test
the limits of his medium; was never driven to rattle the
bars of his cage. He expressed himself completely
without needing to break rules and at the same time
not needing to follow any. Brian was his own guide and
Brian listened to no one but himself in the end. He was
not rebellious, but he was original. He was not contro-

versial, but he was creative. He was himself.

And yet he was not entirely happy. He had no mate-
rial needs; the profits from his recordings could have
bought him anything imaginable. He had friends, but
not many. The ones he had were enough. He was not
famous, but fame was nothing important to him. It was
a mystery to him, that intangible eIement,but he was
certain he would find it, sooner or later.

Brian looked into the woman's large dark eyes. “I
never thought I had much of an impact,” said Brian.

“Such modesty from one so accomplished?”

“A simple reply to a complicated statement.”

“You realize then that I know who you are?”

“Yes.”

“It doesn't surprise you?”

‘‘I‘m surprised that anyone bothers to find out. Most
people are content just to experience. This has hap-
pened before and I wish someone would tell me why it

was so important.”

Brian’s interest in the woman had gone from a very
great to a very small amount in the space of about
fifteen seconds. Several times before people had taken
the time and had spent the money in order to uncover
the name of the composer of the specs they loved so
much. To know the name of Brian Coleridge and to
know how he made his living was to know illegal infor-
mation. The Content Laws had been passed years
before, after some of the original spectrasense com-
posers had been mobbed by fans. Mobbed as if they
were the inventors of pleasure. A few more were
lynched, tortured as if they were the essence of evil
embodied; as if they had been the first to conceive of
pain and had single handedly brought this scourge
upon humanity.The impressions of the spectrasense
recordings buried themselves deep in the minds of
their experiencers. This woman was one who wanted
to meet the creator of her passions.

“I can't give you anything,” said Brian. “You know
that if you take my picture or do anything foolish I'll
have to call the police.”

‘‘I know," said the woman softly. ‘‘All In wanted to do
was ask you a question. I promise I'm not going to try
and steal your socks or snip a lock of your hair or some

11

such nonsense. One question, and I'll forget I've ever
seen you.”

Brian felt some of his interest returning. Perhaps she
wasn't like those other two that had camped across the
street from his old apartment, watching him and peer-
ing through telescopes. They had met him at his door
one morning on his way into the city, looking with
vacant eyes and whimpering mouths atthe person who
had touched their psyches. They took a photograph of
him, as an afterthought. The experience had made
Brian shudder and of course he had had to call the
police. They came quickly and took his fans away
quietly, with the bleary smiles still on their faces as
they were taken to have the illegal information
removed from their memories. Brian had moved the
next day, at the expense of the production company,
just to make sure it didn't happen again.

Brian sighed. “Will this take Iong?” he asked. “No, I
already know the answer ‘As long as you want it to
take’, right”

The woman looked at him and shrugged. ‘‘I suppose
so,” she said.

“Well, in that case we may as well go to my place, if
it’s all right with you.”

The woman shrugged.

“What is your name, anyway?” he said.

“Linda”

They walked across the quiet street in the yellow
autumn sunlight and climbed the two flights to Brian’s
apartment.

“Where's your spec player?” asked Linda. Brian
didn't often use it, but he dug it out of the closet for his
guest.

‘‘All I really wanted to know, Mr. Co|eridge..”

“Brian, please.”

‘‘All I wanted to know, Brian, was whether or not
you've ever listened to your specs.”

Brian laid the black box of the spec player on the
coffee table and plugged it in. It was barely Iargerthan
the thin aluminum discs that it played, about seven
inches in diameter.

“Of course I've listened to them,” said Brian. “I wrote
them, didn't I?’’

“That’s not what I meant,” said Linda.

Brian was shuffling through an old shoe box full of
discs, searching for a particular title.

“Is it ‘Different House’ you're looking for?” the
woman asked.

“How’d you know?” asked Brian, his intrigue again
fully piqued.

“It's your best one,” she said.

It was, and Brian had known itwhen he'd recorded it.
There was something about this one that had moved
him inexplicably, but not many people had bought it,
so the production company had tactfully but unambig-
uously tried to dissuade him from repeating the
attempt. Brian hadn’t objected at the time.

“Here it is. Is this what you want me to listen to?”

“Please,” she said.

Brian slipped the headset on and fed the disk into the
player, which ate it hungrily. It’s motor purred quietly
asthethinfingeroflaserlight beganto liftthe signal off
of the disc. The spec was starting.

Brian looked around the room and noticed thefurni-
ture had a bristling aurora of deep red. The color's
intensity grew until the room was gone and nothing but
the color, just this side ofthe visible threshold, was left.
Brian could no longer feel his hands on the arms ofthe
chair nor could he feel any other physical sensation.
He was completely isolated. The color changed and
ran from the red to the blue end ofthe spectrum, fading
away to utter blackness and Brian was immersed in the
void. The spec player had overridden all of his sensory
stimuli and had substituted its own. The spec began.

Brian sat in a small cubicle whose walls glowed
creamy white. He was face to face with a girl with long,
long, blonde hair, whose eyes were blue and bright-as
electric neon. She wasfantastically beautiful. Brian felt
himself moving towards her; she was half an inch away
and yet her features were indistinct. And he moved
closer and his eyes moved through hers and hefeltthe
cold rush of mountain water and a breeze of spring on
his skin. There were layers of music falling upon his
ears and he could smell roses and lilacs and a thou-
sand flowers and revelled in the flavor of one of the
exotic wines once tasted...

Darkness of a dungeon, smells wet and dank cold-
ness to cool the warmest heart and reaking slime
between his toes. The skeletons hanging on the walls
laughed. Brian screamed. There was the pressure of a
thousand needles along the length of his spine press-
ing gently, gently but always harder and hardertill the
pain was so great he had to...

Laughing, laughing,laughing. Laughed as he fell
past the sign of the times through the rings of giant
onions breaded and fried so you could have it your
way. Falling, falling, smelling the aroma of billions
upon billions of burgers, frying french fried potatoes
and caffeine free colas. He wasn't their kind of people.
“Welcome to McDonalds!'May I take your...”

Ordered rows of crystalline columns stood glinting
brilliantly in the purple sunlight. Brian walked between
the sparkling monoliths seeing his image reflected and
reflected a thousand times, always seeing something
similar but different from his own form. All ofthe possi-
ble images of Brian and...Yes! There it was and swiftly
gone, leaving Brian in doubt of his senses. Was it her?
Or someone else? He lunged at the image of the
woman, thrust his arm through the pylon, fracturing it
and all its neighbors into a million glittering diamonds
of purple. Brian watched as his arms fractured then
split and then fell away...

Brian blinked at the small brown haired woman sit-
ting in his living room The title and label of the spec
hung suspended in mid-air slightly above her left
shoulder. The spec was over.

‘‘I always wondered exactly how the man in that
room would affect a woman. I worked on that branch
for a long time but was never quite sure..."

“Believe me,” said Linda, “he's impressive as that
woman must be, although I've never seen her. The
spec player won't branch to the male segments for a
female experiencer. But you know that, of course."

Brian sat back and considered. What did she want
him to see in this recording? It was short; probably the
shortest spec he had ever done. He had tried a few

12

things differently in it, had made a few insignificant
comments but...

“What is this thing?” asked Linda.

“Please! Don't touch that. It's very old and delicate.
You might break it." Brian moved to protect his guitar
from the hands of an uneducated brute.

“This is an electric guitar, isn't it?"

“Yes."

“This must be at least fifty years old! Can you play
it?" she asked.

‘‘I can play it, but not very well. This may be a stupid
thing to ask, but do you know what might happen if
someone found out about this?”

“I know. Please, don't worry, I won't tell. Besides,
you know something equally incriminating about me.
So we’re even.”

“Yeah," disgustedly. Brian was having a very hard
time deciding whether or not he liked this peron.

“Please,” asked Linda politely, “Could you play
something for me? I've only ever heard the sound of
one of these in the library tapes.”

Somewhat reluctantly, somewhat excitedly, Brian
strapped on the guitar and switched on the amplifier.
“Here, use these.” Brian handed the girl a pair of head-
phones so the neighbors wouldn’t hear.

Brian played her the blues. He was talented and
could play the music, but something was wrong and
surprisingly the girl knew it. Brian was frustrated.

“l‘m amazed that you've come this far," Linda said.
“That was very good. Almost as good as yourtape. Yes,
I've heard the tape before. And you even know some-
thing is missing, don’t you?"

Brian was astonished. “But how do you know the
song? How did you get the tape? The old man said
there weren't any more than half a dozen of them in
existence. Do you know how much that cost?"

“I know what it cost. I sold one ofthem myself, once.
That man playing on the tape, the one who you wish
you could play like, is my grandfather.”

Brian was emphatic. “Then tell me what’s wrong! Tell
me what’s missing! I have to know.”

“You’ll know,” said the woman softly. And she rose
and left Brian holding his guitar, the chrome gleaming
and the amplifier humming quietly.

The cool orange rays of the October sun struck
Brian in the face. He rose slowly, showered and
shaved. Brian never ate breadfast; his lean frame
seemed to operate independently of his eating habits.
The guitar sat where he had left it and beyond that,
through the window, Brian could see the large oak tree
where yesterday, he now felt, his life had taken an odd
turn. It seemed that yesterday had been some strange
dream, a bootleg spec that had never really happened.
It bothered him.

His street was calm as he walked towards the tube
station, the frost glistening on the windows and on the
grass in the park. Brian exhaled and the world became
a dream for a moment, and then assumed its normal
state of being for a time. His neighbor's cat (was it Mrs.
Swanson's) pounced on a leaf and then ran at Brian’s
approach, hiding behind someone’s potted plant.

The tube station contained perhaps a dozen people
at this hour, most of whom Brian knew by sight but to
whom he had never spoken. Once Brian had tried to
start a conversation with one of them, commenting on
the weather and such, and the man had nodded and
mumbled and turned away. Brian didn’t try again.

The train wasn't there yet so Brian studied the sta-
tion, its heavy concrete abutments supporting a lightly
woven aluminum roof. The trains ran above ground
this far out from the city and Brian could see the power

carrying rails and the small gray detectors the compu-

ters used to control the trains lying along the tracks.
There were some pigeons who remained defiantly in
its path. The train was moving fast and at the last
moment before the birds took flight Brian watched as
yellow tabby cat pounced on one and disappeared
beneath the train without a sound. The train came to a
smooth stop in the station. “Stupid cat,” he heard a
man say.

Brian sat on the train and looked at the passengers.
Equal numbers of men and women, dressed in per-
fectly coordinated colors, their cosmetics tailor made
to their skin tones, sat quietly and watched the small
telorex screens placed around the car. These people
considered themselves unfortunate. Unfortunate
because their jobs were such that they had to leave
their homes to do them; had to leave the comfort of
their telorex screens and the pleasure of their spectra-
sense players behind them every day, unlike those
lucky ones whose jobs could be handled at the telorex
keyboard while they sat in their living rooms. Brian
looked at them. He saw their vacant expressions, the
pain in their little eyes. He shuddered slightly and then
was still. The realization had been slow in coming, but
it had come.

“Good morning, Brian.”

“Good moring, Alex," said Brian, beaming. “Could
you please retieve what we were working on
yesterday?”

“Certainly, Brian.” Five seconds elapsed. “The piece
is now in volatile memory, Brian.”

“Thank you. Now, could you please erase it?"

“Pardon me?” said Alex.

“No, this is not a mistake, but I’m glad you’re doing
your job. Please erase it.”

“Certainly, Brian.”

The people who had programmed Alex had done an
exceptionally good job. Although he did not possess
his own conscious initiative, his programmers had
given them a virtual duplicate oftheir own. Alex could
question the commands of his user in a variety of ways,
but was always compelled to follow them eventually.
Alex was not human, but sometimes it was very diffi-
cult to tell the difference.

‘‘I was wondering if we could talk for awhile today,
Alex,” said Brian. He lit a cigarette and blewthe smoke
at the ceiling.

“Of course, Brian. What would you like to talk
about?”

“l’ve been wondering lately," said Brian. “Have yu
ever worked with any other spectrasense artist?”

“My memory contains no evidence that the Alex
program has ever been used with any other spec com-
poser, although I cannot speak for my hardware,” rep-
lied Alex in an unusually metallic tone of voice. Brian
was in one of his moods again.

‘‘I see... I know this is sort of strange to ask, Alex, but
have you enjoyed working with me?”

The tabletop lights changed colors a few times and
Alex replied, ‘‘I find our professional relationship most
productive. It pleases me to be able to provide you with
what technical assistance I can. However, I suspect
you are really asking me whether or not I feel any sort
of affection for you. You are as aware as I of the fact

The Real World:
Are You Prepared?

by Dave Mahofsky and Mark McKrell

A Student Professional Awareness Conference
(SPAC) took place in Benedum Auditorium on
October 23, 1984. This conference was sponsored by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE). The purpose of the conference was to increase
professional awareness among engineering students
by focusing on non-technical issues which they will
confront as professional engineers. The SPAC helped
to introduce students to the “Real World” in many ways
that their B.S. degree simply cannot encompass.

The conference, being sponsored by IEEE, had a

slight slant towards the electrical engineers in the dis;

cussions but the main concepts ofthe speakers could
be generalized to all of the engineering departments.

The SPAC was organized by Michael Murray, the
president of the University of Pittsburgh’s IEEE stu-
dent branch, with many of the IEEE officers also con-
tributing greatly to the conference and its success. The
feeling of many students was that they benefitted from
the program. This article will try to encompass some of
the important topics that were covered at the confer-
ence. It is hoped that much can be gained from this
synopsis but it is not of course expected to take the
place of the actual conference. This article will address
the topics of the conference which included the job
market, interviews, the first job, advanced degrees,
ethics and communications skills.

The SPAC contained a plethora of useful informa-
tion for students looking forward to careers in engi-
neering. Many of the students’ questions and doubts
about their futures were answered. The information
was general in nature and applied to all engineering
disciplines.

Joseph Wiencko, Jr. instructed the students in pres-
enting themselves to the employer. What is it that can
make you standout from all the other applicants?

Simply knowing yourself is a large asset. Students
need to know what they do well and what skills they
need to develop. Along with a good se|f—evaluation,
proper communication is a must. You need to confi-
dently project your skills as applicable for the position
you are seeking. Know what your skills enable you to
do and then prove that you have confidence in these
abilities. It is usually less than adequate to simply ver-
balize your competence. Show that you have applied
your talents in other area. Give the potential employer
facts to reinforce your assertations.

Larry Dwon reminded the students not to stop striv-
ing for success after landing a job. He presented his
view of the successful engineer. First, one should try to
exceed what is normally expected in one’s work. Do
not lock yourself into notions of a comfortable nine—to-
five job. Look ahead for challenging assignments and
enthusiastically pursue solutions. Set high standards
for yourself. One way to exceed expectations is
through better preparation. Think everything through
before you start so you only have to do your job once.

Success in engineering takes more than just good
technical skills. Mr. Dwon encouraged the students to
develop completely as a person to be a better engineer.
Learning managerial skills is important even for those
who have no desire to manage. This helps one to see
and understand why and how decisions affecting one-
self are being made. Participating in voluntary activi-
ties helps in understanding other people. Even reading
non-technical books is a plus. One should read litera-
ture which applies to all areas of his or her life. This
type of background helps the engineer prioritize his
activities so he can better be the person that he wants
to be.

Dr. Aaron Collins presented the students with a
perspective of the graduate school alternative. There
are many different ways to go about obtaining a gradu-

ate education and no one way is the right way for.

PE AND EIT EXAMINATIONS

Upon graduation, an engineer might consider
becoming a registered/licensed professional engi-
neer (PE). Advantages of registration include hav-
ing increased professional flexibility in areas
restricted by state governments to PE’s such as cer-
tain contracting work, recognition by courts of law
as an engineer, and the right to advertise as an
engineer.

In order to become a PE, one must meet the
requirements of the state in which he or she wishes
to be registered. The first requirement is to pass an
examination covering a very broad range of engi-
neering fundamentals commonly referred to as the
Engineer-In—Training (EIT) exam. Most states use
an examination prepared by the National Council of
Engineering Examiners (NCEE). The general
requirements for taking this exam are a four-year
engineering degree, an application and a registra-
tion fee. After completion of this phase of registra-
tion, one is considered an EIT. To become a
full-fledged PE, one must meet additional require-
ments. In most states, these include four years of
experience, being twenty-five years of age and then
passing an examination called the Principals and
Patterns of Engineering Exam (the PE exam). This
exam covers applications of engineering in a cur-
rent professional situation. '

It is probably best for oneto take the EIT examina-
tion upon graduation whilethe material is still fresh
in the mind. There are many areas which are
covered on the examination which a particular prac-
ticing engineer will not encounter. For example, a
chemical engineer may not deal with problems in
electrical theory after graduation.

To register for the EIT examintions given in Penn-
sylvania, one can write to the Pennsylvania State
Registration Board for Professional Engineers, Box
2649, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17120 or call (717)
783-7049. The deadline for the April 20, 1985 exam
was December 1, 1984. The next exam will be given
on October 26,1985 and the deadline is July 1, 1985.

everyone. The most important thing is always to be
improving and learning so that individuals may
increase their skills and capabilities. If you are not
challenged, graduate school can help broaden your
knowledge and present new challenges. This topic is
further explored in the following article in this issue.

Ethics in engineering was discussed by Rosemary
Chalk. An engineer must have the courage to do what
he or she believes in even if it meansthe expenditure of
more of the company's money. The safety of those
using your product should be your number one con-
cern. Another important aspect of this topic is the
development of the professional socieities to aid the
engineer in the fight to uphold ethics. These societies
can be used to help the engineertake and then defend
a position based on ethical beliefs.

Dr. James Watson addressed one area that many
engineers are accused of having problems with. This is
the topic of communication. He dealt more with group
presentations than with person to person relations.
The most common fear in group presentations is
speaking in front of a large group. This nervousness is
natural and is diminished through experience. But
more importantly, whether you are nervous, cocky, or
in between, how do you get your audience to under-
stand and benefit from you what you say? First, good
preparation is a must. Thorough knowledge of your
subject goes a long way in offsetting your nervous-
ness. Second, include visual aids. It has been found
that only 10% of what one hears in a lecture is retained.
20% of the information is remembered using a totally
visual presentation. However, combining the two
increases the amount absorbed to 40%. Therefore,
slides, charts, and overhead displays are extremely
useful in group presentations. Let your audience see
your points as well as hear them. In preparing your
visual aids, make sure that they are understandable.
Do not try to cram too much information into one
visual. Make the purpose of the visual obvious to the
viewer. The use of color also enhances the overall
effectiveness of visual aids. Preparing a pictorial pres-
entation requires more preparation but, as stated
before, it has proved to be far more effective than a
lecture delivered via a vocal presentation only.

While the above information includes a wide range
of topics it is certainly not a complete summary of the
information discussed in the SPAC. Despite this var-
iety, all the speakers seemed to touch upon a common
thread. No two people are exactly alike. Different ways
of doing things are healthy. Be flexible enough to
enbrace someone else’s ways of getting the job done.
Butaboveallelse,goal|outinachievingthethings you
think are most important. Success is really just
accomplishing the goals you set for yourself, while
adhering to your personal beliefs about how to get
there.

 

While many graduating seniors are interviewing for
jobs, others are filling out applications for graduate
school. With theirengineering degree in hand and high
salary offers, some engineers have trouble under-
standing why anyone would want to continue their
studies after graduation. Dr. Aaron Collins, Professor
of Electrical Engineering at Tennessee Technological
University, feels that this is a topic worth discussing.

When the Student Professional Awareness Confer-
ence was held at his school, the subject of graduate
studies was neglected. He felt that by not providing
information on this topic, they were actually discou-
raging students from attending graduate school. Con-
sequently, drawing on his own experiences, Dr.
Collins approached IEEE with his lecture on “Profes-
sional Development Through Advanced Degrees.”

in his experience on the job with a Bachelor of

then getting an M.B.A. would make sense, but added:
‘‘If you plan to manage engineers, then you better be at
least as good as they are.”

An important skill that comes with getting a Master
of Science degree is learning to communicate effec-
tively. In the process of following a thesis program, the
student is required to write a report and present it
orally. Communication and writing skills are substan-
tially improved when working on a thesis. There is
sometimes the option of following a non—thesis Mas-
ters program, but this is mainly for someone who is
working and getting his degree part-time. Then he is
already writing and doing oral presentations on the
job. For someone going straight to graduate school,
the process of doing a thesis is very important.

Sometimes a company will allow its employees to
attend graduate school par_t—time while they are work-

 The Point

Science degree, Dr. Collins said that he learned a lot
his first year. By the second year, though, he found that
he was an ‘old pro,’ and he didn’t learn very much. The
job did not have much room for development, and he
saturated quickly. This caused him to return to Clem-
son University to obtain his Master of Science and
Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering.

Dr. Collins stressed that it is important for an engi-
neerto reevaluate his progress annually, and to look at
how much he has achieved that year. Graduate pro-
grams are designed for those individuals who wish to
further their development in engineering by continu-
ing their education.

Dr. Collins explained that with a Bachelors of
Science degree, an engineer has a broad base on
which to build, including an understanding ofthe lan-
guage of engineering and problem solving skills, but
added: “You are going into a changing world, and the
information that you havetheday you graduate will not
be adequate information for you to work with five years
after that." The skills acquired as an undergraduate
need further development, and an important decision
to make is whether to get this development in graduate
school or to try to get it on the job with the proper
assignments that allow for growth as part of the job.

The goal of getting a Master of Science degree is to
be able to do advanced engineering, and to become
technically creative. Dr. Collins remarked: “When I
took my first job after the B.S., I don't think lwas very
creative technically. I was a good problem solver, but
somebody else had to define the problems. I didn’t
have a good overview." He also mentioned that if
someone plans to manage money or non-engineers

16

mg. Advantages are that the engineer is receiving a
salary and gaining job experience while being a gradu-
ate student. The individual must be highly motivated,
though, as a job consumes a lot of time and energy. Dr.
Collins suggests asking the potential employer how
many people in his organization have acutally received
their degree by this program.

No matter which path you follow in pursuing a Mas-
ter of Science degree, it can be a fulfilling experience.
Dr. Collins stated: “You have enough material to
understand and enjoy the courses, and the material is
coming together in a way that relates to the real world.
You will have a lot of confidence in yourself at this
point.” The skills acquired allow an engineer to be
technically creative and to make technical sugges-
tions. He or she then has a mastery of one area, and
can communicate effectively.

in obtaining a Master of Science degree the student
achieves a thorough understanding of one area. With a
Ph.D. one also gets very deeply into one area, but also
acquires a broader knowledge of more specializations
and a better understanding of the fundamentals of
engineering. By going through oral exams and work-
ing on a dissertation, one becomes a much better com-
municator. When working on a Ph.D., the student is
more independent and is given more responsibility for
running a research project. This carries overinto his or
her job, when he or she is given more responsibility
and has more input into what the company plans for
the future. Dr. Collins also found that in industry he
could communicate with different disciplines and was
able to move between technical groups easily.

There are more options open to someone with a.

 

Ph.D. Some choices include teaching at a university or
doing research, most likely at the frontiers of state of
the art technology. Through writing proposals to get
research funds into the university, and making deci-
sions about his research project, the student also
acquires the knowledge to start his own business. At
this point the principles of engineering are coming
together.

Some people argue.against going for a Masters or
Doctorate directly, because of the lost of the money
that could be earned by working during those years.
Studies have shown, though, that salaries for an engi-
neer at the Master of Science and Doctorate level start
higher, climb faster, and saturate later. These engi-
neers have the ability to achieve quite a bit, and will get
the choice assignments so that they can develop on
the job.

Science degree prepares him to do advanced engi-
neering, teaches him significant communication skills,
and prepares him to lead engineers in a project. With a
Ph.D. the engineer is ready to teach, do research or
start a business. He is prepared for work at the frontiers
of engineering and can assume a position at the high-
est level of an engineering practice.

Dr. Collins said that it is important for an individual
to define his overall game plan for managing his
career. In concluding, he once again stressed that an
engineer should check his development each year and
maximize his development curve. Dr. Collins finished
with: “Set your goals and be sure to evaluate your
progress annually. It is up to you to decide how much
effort you’re willing to put out to get where you want to

go.

f a Ph.D.

by Carmen Whitson

 

There are fellowships and assistantships available
from graduate schools to pay for the graduate stu-
dent’s education. Fellowships are awarded on the
basis of scholastic ability and promise of achievement.
Assisantships are available in teaching and in re-
search, and most graduate students have one ofthese.
Students holding a teaching assistantship teach a lab
or recitation, and grade homework. The duties of a
research assistantship involve work on a research pro-
ject. The awards pay for the student’s tuition and pro-
vide him with a stipend.

Dr. Collins mentioned that by attending graduate
school, a student begins to really understand his
classes. The individual also achieves an attitude
advantage by association with othergraduate students
who are usually highly motivated. There is more inter-
action with faculty on the graduate level because of a
smaller faculty to student ratio, and one faculty
member acts as a mentor. This job is assumed by the
professor in the student’s specialization, who super-
vises the research project and preparation of the the-
sis. Dr. Collins describes it as an older more
experienced engineer taking the student under his
wing and moving him forward, which is unlikely to
happen in industry.

Some advantages in getting a graduate degree right

- after one’s undergraduate education are that the stu-

dent usually has fewer commitments and more time at
this point, and is more ready academically. The degree
aids him in receiving the good assignments once he
starts work.

A B.S. degree provides an individual with some tools
to begin development as an engineer. The Master of

Slinkyrama

by maurice rickard and a plastic bag

The Slinky, in its various forms, has been with us for
as long as most of us can remember, possibly even
since the dawn of time itself, if carbon-dating of some
Slinkys unearthed in the early fifties is accurate. In that
case, of course, it is little or no wonder that most, if not
all, of us cannot remember the advent of the Slinky as
we know it. Despite its scientifically-proven antiquity,
however, the Slinky does indeed exhibit some aston-
ishingly advanced physical properties, perhaps prop-
erties too advanced for any “innocent”chi|dren’s toy to
rightfully possess. Allow me to tell you a little bitabout
these things.

In order to understand the Slinky, one must become
reasonably familiar with its history on this planet.
According to primitive cave paintings that have been
scientifically carbon-dated, the first actual record of
Slinkys on Earth was made in or about the area now
occupied by Macy’s in New York, on a relatively balmy
midsummer night during, appropriately enough, the
late Bronze Age. These early paintings depict a giant
escalator coming down from the clouds, with billions
and billions of Slinkys descending the steps. Much
scientific debate over whetherthe escalator was down-
going or upgoing has failed to produce, at least in my
opinion, a satisfying solution.

By investigating several neighboring cave systems,
we have found that the Slinkys migrated to otherareas
that would later be occupied by major American
department store chains, leaving their eggs deep in the
earth, apparently to wait for the ultimate erection of a
toy department above them. Several other Slinkys
migrated south, and are believed to have lain in wait to
later help Cortez ruin the Aztec culture during the
Spanish conquest of South America. As for what ulti-
mately happened to the original Slinkys, no one is
quite certain, although stories of giant skyward
directed escalators going in the opposite direction
from the first set still circulate in this part of the
country.

In the Fifties, however, the first of the Slinkys began
to emerge, almost exactly at the same time as televi-

18

sion for home use became popularin this country. (For
this reason, it is theorized that Slinkys possess low-
frequency electromagnetic receptors, with which they
detected a civilization advanced enough to produce
something like “Captain Video.”) They eventually
came to occupy places in most major department
stores and many American homes. It is here they
remain, seemingly innocuous, to this very day.

Enough, though, about the history of the Slinky. Let
us now investigate some of the most definitely amaz-
ing properties that these things possess. First of all,
there are the obvious physical properties, such as the
abilities to “walk down stairs, alone or in pairs,” and to
“make a slinkity sound.” While these are indeed some
pretty impressive abilities (how many people do you
know who can make a slinkity sound?), they also give
us some insight into the behavioral properities of Slin-
kys. (Believe me, this is mighty important. if you've
ever been locked in a dark lab with a pack of test
Slinkys, you will realize the value of understanding
what a Slinky is wont to do to you.) The phrase “walk
down stairs” strongly suggests a certain sentience
(after all, not too many inanimate objects can walk),
while the phrase “alone or in pairs” impliesthat, socio-
logically, Slinkys do not necessarily feel the need for
participation in large—group rituals, but are not particu-
larly ill-disposed to doing so. The “s|inkity sound” has,
as we will find out later, a major role in the mating
procedure of these things (so be glad that none of your
friends go about making slinkity sounds).

Physically, though, Slinkys are just as fascinating.
Measurements made by a team of experts and two
rhesus monkeys thrown in as a control indicate that
the internal stresses of any given Slinky (with the sin-
gular exception of the plastic ones, the collective exist-
ence of which is severely doubted by most of our
leading philosophers), when multiplied by average
atmospheric pressure and Bingweiser’s constant (a
virtually unobtainable value-Bingweiser hasn't pub-
lished his thesis yet and is being piggish about letting
other researchers see even the units, let alone the
constant itself) exceed the speed of light by a factor
that is equal to my ex-girlfriend's home phone number
plus one. Indeed, it has been proven that if any given
man-made metallic structure (let’s say a bridge, or a
jeep, or maybe even one ofthe spoons from the Towers

cafeteria), if subjected to the same internal forces, it
would instantly hyperaccelerate into a dimension
approximately fifteen right angles away, leaving
behind nothing but a substance that has been chemi-
cally evaluated as being a mirror—image isomer of the
average molecule of dog food. Interestingly enough,
this effect was calculated by Bingweiser’s former grad-
uate student, Aleksandr Zungefarbe, who very
recently disappeared next to an Alpo processing plant.
Perhaps there are some very odd forces at work here.
Indeed, at this point, one must ask oneself if this is the
kind of toy one wants one’s children playing with. (The
thought of all the little onelets cartwheeling off into a
higher—order dimension is likely to fill one with a cer-
tain amount of concern.)

However, all is not dim for the |ong—maligned field of
Slinky dynamics, no siree. In fact, as I write this, sev-
eral of Pitt’s foremost Slinky engineers are out getting
roaring drunk after a hard day of testing the engineer-
ing department’s nearly priceless collection of Slinkys
to their limits and, in one or two cases, beyond. (You
can bet that Requisitioning will give them hell forthat,
but do the Slinky engineers care? No, they don’t care.
Wow, what guys they are, really.) Not only did they do
some nasty things to these Slinkys, but I am willing to,
for your reading pleasure, describe these terrible awful
things to you.

The first experiment involved probing the atomic
structure of one of the Slinkys. In order to do this, the
Slinky was taken down to the sub—basement of Bene-
dum Hall, where the atom probe is found. (Note: In
order to ensure the engineers’ safety, they were outfit-
ted with radiation suits and little yellow booties. So
remember, kids, if you want your Slinky probed, don’t
do it at home; have your Slinky looked at by a profes-
sional, or have yourself psychoanalyzed by one of
Freud's better-known disciples.) Interestingly enough,
it was determined in at least three probings that the
Slinky either has no atomic structure or is interested in
hiding it from us. What is it that these Slinkys do not
want us to know?

Secondly, a fresh Slinky and two control Slinkys
were taken to Fifth Avenue. The test Slinky and one of
the control Slinkys were stretched across, care being
taken to maintain contact with the pavement at all
times. The other control Slinky was stretched across,
but suspended above the pavement by 3.765m. Shock-
ingly, both Slinkys in contact with the pavement were
ravaged beyond suitable recognition within 2.514
seconds by one truck, five medium-sized sedans, six
subcompacts, two imported sports cars, three PAT
buses (two standard, one elongated), and a bicycle.
The other control Slinky escaped unscathed, although
visibly shaken by the experience.

The third experiment was conducted in cooperation
with the Psychology department, who supplied their
best researcher, Mitzi Campbell-Bannerman, to study
the mating habits of Slinkys while we took, uh, “mea-
surements." When five Slinkys were placed in a dar-
kened room, it was observed that, after a period of 32.9
nanoseconds, the Slinkys began to make what sixteen
independent (and two not-so-independent) observers

19

classified as “a most decidedly slinkity” sound. 6.1407
seconds later, the Slinkys began to exhibit mating
behavior, such as intertwining (one of the observers
mentioned the resemblence to DNA, a point which
must be investigated in the future), and getting all
knotted up (my ex-girlfriend was reminded of her
jewelry). Indeed, this was all quite shocking, but an
entirely scientific and acceptable way to blow off the
afternoon —— I heartily suggestthat everyone try similar
things at least once at some point during your stay
here. Since the gestation period of the Slinky is
unknown and it is believed that it only takes three
Slinkys to reproduce, there exists a distinct possibility
that Slinkys are a little less moral and a little more
intelligent than previously thought. It could be thatthe
Slinkys had recreation, and not procreation, on their
minds, but only time will provide the answer.

During the testing, though, a tragic accident
occurred to one of the Slinky engineers while driving
to one of the testing sites. This, however, did not pre-
vent the team from gathering some useful data, as
teams like this are wont to do. As is common know-
ledge, all recent Slinky boxes have the warning “Do not
open box in moving vehicle” imprinted on the side.
Apparently, this particular team member, for an as-of-
yet unknown reason, opened the box while his Chevy
Malibu was travelling at 42.683 mph. He was asphyx-
iated instantly when the Slinky attached itself around
his neck. If the Malibu had not hit an embankmentwith
a vector of 4i + 3j —.7k at 44.972 mph, the Slinky would
have remained conscious enough to entirely absorb
the team member in under 2.60 hours. Ironically, the
box was still intact.

Due to this most unfortunate circumstance, testing
was adjourned for the day and it was decided to con-
duct a minor wake forthe department team member, at
which at least 85.3% of the team was shown to have
drunk themselves silly. Science, you must remember,
is hard work.

In conclusion, it must be stressed that Slinky dynam-
ics is a very new field, with millions of bits of informa-
tion yet to be discovered and billions of dollars in
federal grants yet to be finagled. In light of this, it must
be noted that no one, save qualified experts and their
preferred lab assistants should be allowed in close
proximity to any given Slinky, letalone conduct exper-
iements on it. Yes, perhaps, with the appropriate funds,
the Slinky will one day be understood by mere mortals
such as ourselves. Right now, it is believed that if the
Slinky Engineering department here at Pitt can acquire
the funding to build a full—scale mock-up of a fine
department store (complete with escalators), the
entire field will move closer to its ultimate goal of
luxurious lives for all of its major researchers. In light
of this, I would like to suggest that, if any of you have
further interest in the subject, to send me money for
additional Slinky-oriented reports atthe address supp-
lied below. Thanks for your support.

For the first in a series of additional reports on the
nature of Slinkys (#1: On the Freudian Aspects of Slin-
kys), send $1.00 to Box #3813,3990 Fifth Ave., Pgh., PA

the first annual Benedum backgammon tournament.
The tournament will be triple elimination. M3, the coor-
dinator of the tournament, has rented one official

ute. If each match takes forty-three minutes and M3
rented the board for the maximum amount of time it
could be needed, how much did he pay?

(4) M3 decided to throw out all fifteen of his Beatles
albums. Dave Mahofski said that he would like to have
six of them to start his album collection. Dave exam-
ined all the possible sets of six Beatles albums, but
then decided not to take them and to buy a Bee Gees
album instead. Kathleen McE|hinny then said she
would take M3’s Beatles albums. However, she could
only carry nine of them. Thus, she examined all the
possible sets of nine Beatles albums, made a choice,
and took them home. How many more sets of Beatles
albums did Dave examine than Kathleen?

(5) One day M3 decided to have some fun using his
power of looking into the future. He noticed that in the
summer of 1995 an ambitious CAS student wanted to
transer into Engineering. Well, it turns out that this
student's QPA was exactly 1.29 and according to the
dean, he wouldn’t be able to transfer until he got his
QPA up to 3.00. The student is only capable of getting
3.30 in any given term, can never attend summer
school, and won’t take more than 18 credits in any one
term. When (month and year) is the earliest possible
time for the student to transfer into Engineering?

Hearty congratulations are extended to Dominic
D’Andrea, the winner of the October Skycaper contest.
Dominic correctly answered two of the five challenging
questions. Strange as it may seem, his entry was the only
one received, thus those answers were his ticket to a
twenty-five dollar prize. The solutions to the October
Skycaper are as follows:

(1) Rickie travels on the smaller 2 circles at 60 MPH.
Each circle is 10 miles, thus he does 3 laps per hour or
‘A: lap every 5 minutes. Ronnie travels on the largertwo
circles at 90 MPH. Each circle is 30 miles, thus he does
1.5 laps per hour or ‘/3 lap every 5 minutes. Each smaller
circle is 10/pi miles in diameter and the larger circles
have a diameter of 30/pi miles. Using this and that a9 +
b2 =c2, we find the first 8 distances. They are 0, 850'5/pi,
50/pi, 325O'5/pi, 60/pi, 325O'5/pi, 50/pi, 85O'5/pi. After
that, they repeat, therefore the average distance is the
average of the above 8 numbers. It is 13.22287364
miles = 69817 feet.

(2) If Houston wins all 27 of their remaining games,
they would have 83 wins. To have a shot at winning the
pennant, Los Angeles could only win 3 games, San
Francisco 4, Pittsburgh 5, Cincinnati 6 and Milwaukee
11. This is a total of 29 wins and these teams must play
30 games among themselves. Thus Houston cannot
win.

(3) Each member of the series is the product of the
number of letters and the number of words in the
corresponding line of the poem that appeared in The
Skycaper by M3.The sixth line of the poem contains 4
words consisting of a total of 21 letters. 4 X 21 = 84.

(4) Since k and n are both integers and k/n is less than
or equal to 2, 3k + (7n)n must be greaterthan or equal
to 10.

(1010 + 13)? = 100...002600...0O619

The sum of the digits is 25.

(5) In order to have a seven no trump lay down, Chris
would have to have all four aces and at least a king ora
queen and a jack in one suit. An ace is worth four high
card points, a king is worth three, aqueen is worth two,
and a jack is worth one. Thus the number of high card
points that Chris had is 4(4) + 3 = 19.

‘Twas the Night
Before Finals

by Stephen R. Sabram

{Twas the night before finals and all through the dorms
Every student was studying, even the norms:
The notecards were hung by the desks well made
In hope of earning a passing grade;
The students were panicking all at their desks,
Hoping they knew what will be on the tests
My roommate with his books, and I with my notes,
Have iust settled ourselves with a great deal of hope,-
When over toward the phone there rose a loud ring,
I sprang from my desk to answer the thing.
I raised the receiver up to my ear,
“Pizza Man here!", I heard with a ieer,
I collected the money and ran to the gate,
The pizza was here only four hours late.
I gave him the money that was counted iust right,
He handed me the pizza to end my plight.
At the elevators I press the button and wait.
The smell of the pizza was wonderfully great.
I want to get to my room and study some more.
Why is each elevator on the eighteenth floor?
I arrive at my floor and it is rather late,
It's hard holding pizza while opening a security gate.
I get to my room to open the pizza as I please,
But instead of pepperoni there was extra cheese.

I scoffed and screamed at the mistake they made here,
But we ate it since anything would now taste dear.
Stretching out cheese as we munched through the pie,

While wiping the sauce out of our eyes.
We finished the pizza and that was that,
We at the whole thing in ten minutes flat.
I walked into the hall to throw the box away,
Hoping this will tie us over ’til the next day.
“To the desksl", I exclaimed, “Back to the books!"

But my roommate stared back at me with dirty looks.

I sat at my desk and reached for a book,
While peering at the clock for a look.
On the clock it read 4:30 AM,
I did very little studying by then.
Some more notes I wrote that I hoped were right,
No sleep for me this very night.
When morning comes the tests will be here,
And then comes a break, at least ’til next year!

News from Benedum Hall

Holtzman honored

by National Academy

Dr. Albert G. Holtzman P.E. was recently elected to
membership in the National Academy of Engineering.
Election to the Academy is the highest professional
distinction that can be conferred on an engineer.
Holtzman is the first industrial engineer to hold a
membership.

Established in 1964 by distinguished engineers, the
National Academy advises the federal government on
policies for engineering education and practice. Con-
gress currently provides some supporting funds for
this prestigious Washington D.C. based academy. The
National Academy consists of about 1 200 international
engineers. This year the membership elected 55 more
engineers into Academy positions.

Academy membership honors those who have made
important contributions to engineering theory and
practice in the areas of engineering literature of new
and developing fields of technology.

The Academy acclaims Holtzman “for his Industrial
Engineering accomplishments in optimization theory,
computer integrated manufacturing, multi-criterion
decision making, linear programming and information
systems.”

by Laurel Jamieson

Holtzman holds the positions of professor, advisor-
/counselor and depatment head in Pitt’s Industrial
Engineering department. He is Director of Accredita-
tion for the Institiute of Industrial Engineering, and
represents the HE on the Board of directors of the
Accreditation Board of Engineering Technology.
Eighty-two industrial engineering programs hold
accreditation from |lE and ABET.

What are they doing
to the sidewalk?

Wonder what is happening at Forbes Quadrangle?
All the plaza pavement blocks have been removed from
their foundations so that a new watertight lining can be
laid. Rain and various other forms of moisture are currently
leaking through the old lining, and rotting the roof of the
garage under the Quad. General Rolfing Construction Co.
is repairing the lining.

that I am a machine and am not really capable of such
emotions. But I must confess that lately I've noticed
that you've been acting rather strangely and I am con-
cerned that it may somehow threaten our current con-
tract or perhaps bring an end to our partnership, which
would be most unsettling.”

Brian inhaled deeply on his cigarette and the stub of
ash crawled towards his nose. Luck was a strange
thing...

“Alex, could you tell me what it is they tell you your
job is supposed to be? I know what you do, but I’m
curious as to what your programmers told you."

“This is rather unusal, Brian,” said Alex dubiously.

‘‘I know it is Alex, but humor a depressed artist and
I’ll be forever grateful."

“Very well, said Alex. ‘‘It is my primary function to
detect and analyze sensory stimuli and encode them
for later recording onto spectrasense discs. I am also
able, through the use of my very large database, to

22

provide the composer with any examples of past
recordings to help him with his composition. I perform
the function of a copyright inspector and can notifythe
composer of any possible plagiarism he may unwit-
tingly be committing. I am supposed to assistthe com-
poser in any way that I can in his work, and am also
required to edit, alter, or censor any unintentional
infringement upon the current spectrasense content
laws. That is all."

“What about intentional infringement, Alex?” said
Brian slowly. “What are you supposed to do if a com-
poser, for some unknown reason, would try to record a
blatantly illegal spec? If it got past you it would imme-
diately go into production, wouldn’t it?"

‘‘I have been instructed, if this were to occur, to
notify the proper authorities immediately.”

“And?”

‘‘I assume that the composer would be promptly
arrested,” said Alex perfunctorily.

Brian lit another cigarette. He looked outthe window
across the great city, unable to see the ground through
the forest of buildings.

Engineer’s Week
planning begins

The Engineer’s Week Planning Committe has begun
planning the festivities. In the works is a 12 hour
Monopoly game as a charity event lasting from noon
until midnight. Enginuity is steering away from vehi-
cles. Gimmick plans to change the obstacle course
and to put one girl on each tug of war team.

“Look through your library, Alex. Can you find any
other composer who is or was as good as me?"

“There have been no others who have had such wide
acclaim both from the public and the critics. There is
one, however, whose specs followed a history similar
to yours.”

“Tell me about him, Alex.”

“He recorded under the catalog number ASF-1175.
His name is, of course, unavailable. His compositions,
over a period of perhaps four years, followed a course
similar in style and content to your own. He abruptly
stopped recording exactly eight years, three months
and two days ago.”

“Why.” Tensely.

‘‘I am unable to say," said Alex. “Aren't we wasting
time, Brian? We do have one more spec to complete for
the current contract.”

“In know, Alex, I know.” Brian thought for a few
moments. “What do you think he could have done,
Alex? Where do you think he could have taken us if he
had kept recording?"

“loan only extrapolate from what I know, Brian. I can
only imagine him going on to very exciting and beauti-
ful things. Unfortunately, he probably would have
eventually broken the Iaw.”

“A shame, isn't it Alex?” said Brian to the tabletop.
The indicator lights blinked and changed colors.
Alex's machinery made no sound.

“Yes, it is a shame,” said Alex finally.

“To assist the composer any way that I can...” Brian
thought aloud.

“Record mode” said Alex.

Brian watched the pigeons scatter into the air, some
alighting on the roof of the station, as his train came to
a stop. He walked out into the chill air and made his
way through the suburban streets to his house. It usu-
ally took about five days for Alex to get a spec record-
ing in the stores.:.

“Hello, Brian."

“Hello.” A small dark—haired woman stood before
him on the sidewalk. They walked together to Brian's
apartment and as the October sky turned through its
warm colors, Brian's guitar sang him the blues.

Create computers that
capture the mysteries
of common sense.

The brain does it naturally. lt
wonders. It thinks with spon-
taneity—advantages we haven't
been able to give computers.
We've made them “smart? able
to make sophisticated calcula-
tions at very fast speeds. But we
have yet to get them to act with
insight, instinct, and intuition.

But what if we could devise
ways to probe into the inner na-
ture of human thought? So com-
puters could follow the same
rationale and reach the same
conclusions a person would.

What if we could actually design
computers to capture the myster-
ies of common sense?

At GE, we've already begun to
implement advances in knowl-
edge engineering. We are cod-
ifying the knowledge, intuition
and experience of expert engi-
neers and technicians into com-
puter algorithms for diagnostic
troubleshooting. At present, we
are applying this breakthrough to
diesel electric locomotive sys-
tems to reduce the number of
engine teardowns for factory
repair as well as adapting this
technology to affect savings in
other areas of manufacturing.

We are also looking at parallel
processing, a method that
divides problems into parts
and attacks them simultaneously,
rather than sequentially, the way

the human brain might.

While extending technology
and application of computer
systems is important, the real
excitement and the challenge of
knowledge engineering is its
conception. At the heart of all
expert systems are master engi-
neers and technicians, preserv-
ing their knowledge and
experience, questioning their
logic and dissecting their
dreams. As one young employee
said, “At GE, we’re not just shap-
ing machines and technology.
We're shaping opportunity."

Thinking about the possibili-
ties is the first step to making
things happen. And it all starts
with an eagerness to dream,

a willingness to dare and the
determination to make visions,
reality.

An equal opportunity employer

If you can dream it,
you can do it.
