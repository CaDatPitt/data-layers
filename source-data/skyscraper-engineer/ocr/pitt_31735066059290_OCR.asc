A new 30 billion electron volt syn-

chroton will enable scientists to

“see” the structure of the nucleus.

BY CARL BEAUMARIAGE , E. E. ’6O

To accelerate minute bits of matter to energies of
the order of 30 billion electron volts (bev), man has
had to build a huge machine. This machine, called the
proton synchrontron and located at the Brookhaven
National Laboratories, Long Island, N. Y., will cost
approximately $25,000,000 and contain more than 3800
tons of electrical grade steel.

Most of this steel is contained in 240 magnets which
were made to within exacting speciﬁcations. Commer-
cial standards were rejected. Magnetic properties with-
in steel vary—not only from one furnace load to an-
other, but from sheet to sheet in the same load. This
is due to unevenly distributed impurities, uneven cool-
ing, etc:

This was taken into consideration by the Brookhaven
Personnel and special devices, and techniques were
devised to compensate for these minor deviations. The
magnets’ cores were fabricated by building up lamin-
ation of steel which were stamped on a 450 ton Hamil-
ton Press to proper outside dimensions——-33 inches. by 39
inches. The larger size magnets each weighed 15%
tons.

At Brookhaven, before the protons go into the syn-
chrotron, they ﬁrst go thruogh a 750,000 ev high volt-
age generator. From there, they go into a linear accel-
erator and by stages are raised to an energy of 50,000,-
000 ev; and then they are injected into the synchrotron.
On each revolution, twelve radio-frequency accelerating
stations give them additional boosts of energy so that
at the end of their travels, they have an energy of
25-30 bev. In one second the particles go around the one-
half mile track some 350,000 times.

The path of the particles is a vacuum chamber seven
inches in diameter and three-and three-eighths inches
high. The magnets develop a magnetic force of 10,000
to 13,000 gauss and will be buried in a subterranean

MAGNETS for the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron will

tunnel 17 feet 9 inches high and 18 feet wide. The
tunnel will be covered with 12 feet of earth.

The proton synchrotron is the latest step in the
evolution of a long line of particle accelerators. These
accelerators are used for two purposes——to “see” fun-
damental particles of matter and to create new ones.

The ability of a microscope to distinguish small ob-
jects depends on the wavelength of the light it employs.
You can see any object that is at least one-half as long
as the wave length of light you are using, if you have
a powerful enough microscope. When the length of
the object is less than one-half the wavelength of the
light you are using, you can not see it regardless of how
powerful a microscope you use. The light waves sim-
ply bend around the particle and none are reflected.

Thus, to “see” the nucleus of an atom, you have to
use light with wavelength of the order 10 to the minus
twelfth centimeters, the diameter of the nucleus. This is
the wavelength of a porton of one mev energy. We have
gone beyond this, however, in the Van de Graff accelera-
tor and the cyclotron. To simply detect a particle the size
of a proton an energy of several hundred mev. is needed.
To see the actual structure of the nucleus as well as we
would like requires an energy of 25-30 bev. This is
why the proton synchrotron is being built.

There is another reason also. Einstein’s equation
tells us that matter and energy are equivalent.
When the wavelength is short enough, new par-

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

ticles can be created. A one mev electron has enough
energy to create an electron and a positron. At 150
mev it can make pi mesons when it collides with a nu-
cleon. Six bev protons are able to create antiprotons,
antineutrons, and still heavier particles such as xi and
sigma mesons. Who knows what can be produced with
a 25-30 bev particle? The proton synchrotron is being
built to ﬁnd out.

Why use a proton synchrotron? These devices, the
cyclotron, bevatron and proton synchrotron all work
similarly. The particles are accelerated by an electric
ﬁeld. However, to accelerate a particle through several
mev would require an extremely long track. So the track
is made into a circle and the particles go around and
around gaining energy on each trip.

This circular motion is brought about by magnetic
ﬁelds. The force acting on a particle in a magnetic ﬁeld
is given by

F=BEV

where B is. the intensity, e is the charge on the particle
and v is the velocity normal to the ﬁeld. This force
produces a radial acceleration thereby causing the par-
ticle to move in a circle. The acceleration is given by

A=F/M=BEV

These equations hold only for non-relativistic par-
ticles, that is, particles whose velocity is much
less than the velocity of light. Einstein’s equa-
tion says that as a particle gets close to the
speed of light, its mass increases. When the mass
increases, the acceleration is decreased and the particle
moves in a larger circle. Therefore, there is a practicle
limit to the energy that a particle can attain in the
cyclotron. The synchrotron, however, takes this into
consideration by adjusting the ﬁeld B, as the mass in-
creases. Therefore, the acceleration remains constant,
and the particle moves in a central or synchronous path.
Now we can see that a particle can attain more energy
since it will stay in a smaller path longer.

In the proton synchrotron, not only is the ﬁeld
varied but the frequency of the accelerating voltage is
also varied.

This varying ﬁeld and frequency focuses the parti-
cles radially but nothing has been said about vertical
adjustment. This is accomplished by a new principle
called strong focusing recently discovered at Brook-
haven. This principle involves a reshaping of the guid-
ing magnetic ﬁeld so that the particles are more re-
stricted to the circular path. It is accomplished by
alternating the curvature of the magnets. The sectors
bowed outward produce sharp verticle focusing and
those bowed inward produce sharp radial focusing. The
overall effect is a more even circular path.

All this energy sounds good but there is one big
disadvantage that has not been mentioned. When a
large object strikes a smaller one, most of the available
energy goes into rebounding the smaller object. If you

MAY 1959

strike a stone with a hammer of the same mass, the
two tend to move off with half the speed of the incom-
ing hammer. Only half the energy went into breaking
the stone. If you hit a small stone with a large hammer,

.uillIl"i'hIh:‘ﬂ|.‘g| I A

in

A NEW CONCEPT of smashing the atom was ma-de pos-
sible because of the magnetic force concentrated in these
magnets.

nearly all the energy goes into breaking or chipping the
stone.

In this respect, relativity plays a dirty trick on us.
As we go up the ladder, the mass increases, and our
“hammer” gets larger. When one bev proton strikes a
stationary proton 57% of the energy is wasted, i.e. only
.43 bev is available for useful purposes; of a 3 bev,
only 1.15 bev is available; of 10 bev, 2.9; 100 bev, only
10.5. An increase from one to one hundred bev in-
creases available energy only 20 times. Thus, to have
30 bev available energy, we would need 500 bev par-
ticles.

This could be avoided by employing the design en-
visaged by the Midwestern University Research Asso-
ciation (MURA). Instead of having a moving particle
striking a stationary one, arrange a head on collision.
Then there is no tendency for the colliding particles to
move one way or the other. All of the energy of both
particles is then available for desired reactions. This
could be arranged by placing two 15 bev accelerators so
that their proton beams intersect and the particles col-
lide with one another. But this is only theory. None
of these machines have been built yet. One may be
built in the future.

Generally speaking, the scientists at Brookhaven
want to break up matter and create matter out of
energy. They plan to do pure research, but what might
eventually develop from the facts gained is not at this
time the concern of the scientists.

Chemistry, biology, space travel, and many others
are certain to be shoved farther and faster along by
knowing some of the answers that Brookhaven hopes
to learn. I

THE 1959

Every spring semester each engi-
neering dep.artment chooses one sen-
ior who best represents that depart-
ment. These seniors personify the
qualities of leadership, scholarship,
character, and service to the Schools
of Engineering and Mines. From
these nine seniors, one is chosen as
the Outstanding Graduating Senior
from the entire Engineering School.

KEN ROTHERT has been honor-
ed by being chosen as the 1959 Out-
standing Graduating Senior.

Kenneth Rothert has been honor-
ed by being chosen as the 1959 Out-
standing Graduating Senior.

In his four years at the Univer-
sity, Ken has established himself as
an exceptionally active student. His
interests have been wide and varied
as his record shows.

In his freshman year, his journal-
istic career started by editing a
small booklet describing Chemical
Engineering for Engineers’ Week.
Ken then became connected with
the Skyscraper Engineer in his soph-
omore year when he joined the edi-
torial staff. He also worked on the
Chemical Engineering publication,
the Steady Stater.

Ken was engaged in numerous
activities during his junior year. He
became copy editor of the Skyscrap-
er Engineer, councelor for Fresh-
man Camp, and also counselor in
the Men’s Conference Program. Ken
was elected to a Junior class position
and vice president of the University
of Pittsburgh student branch of the
American Institute of Chemical En-
gineers. He was also awarded a

“I wanted a job I could ﬂy with—and |’ve got it”

H. James Cornelius graduated from Swarthmore
College in 1954 with a BS. in Electrical Engineer-
ing. He’s been “growing” ever since with the
Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania.

After an initial 44-week inter-departmental
training course, Jim was made Facility Engineer
in charge of the fast-growing Norristown-Potts-
town area. In that capacity, he engineered over
half a million dollars’ worth of carrier systems and
cable facilities between major switching centers
in Pennsylvania.

Today, he is one of 50 young engineers from
the Bell Telephone Companies chosen to attend a
special Operating Engineers Training Program at

Bell Laboratories. This 19-month course of study
—with full pay——deals with advanced techniques
and new concepts in electronics which signal a
new era in telephony. It involves both classroom
theory and practical laboratory applications.

When Jim and his colleagues return to their

Why metals corrode. . . and how to prevent it

The equipment you will design most
probably will have to stand up
against one or more of these 6 differ-
ent forms of corrosive attack:

1. General tarnishing or rusting with
occasional perforations in highly af-
fected areas.

2. Highly localized attack by pitting.

3. Cracking induced by a combination
of stress and corrosion.

4. Corrosion conﬁned to_ crevices, under
gaskets, or washers, or in sockets.

5. Corrosion of one of an al1oy’s con-
stituents leaving a weak residue.

6. Corrosion near the junction of two
different metals.

HOW CORROSION OCCURS
The basic cause of corrosion is the
instability of metals in their reﬁned
state. Metals tend to revert to their
natural states through the processes
of corrosion. For example, when you
analyze rust, you will ﬁnd it is iron
oxide. When you analyze natural iron
ore, you ﬁnd it, too, is iron oxide.

In all of the six forms of corrosion
mentioned above, corrosion has the
same basic mechanism. It’s similar
to the electrochemical action in a dry
cell.

The electrolyte in the dry cell cor-
responds to the corrosive media,
which may be anything from the
moisturein the air to the strongest
alkali or acid.

The plates of the battery correspond
to the metal involved in corrosion.

A potential difference between
these metals or different areas on the
same metal causes electricity to ﬂow
between them through the electro-
lyte and a metallic bridge or contact
that completes the circuit.

At the anode, a destructive altera-
tion or eating away of metal occurs
when the positively charged atoms
of metal detach from the solid sur-
face and enter the solution as ions.

The corresponding negative
charges, in the form of electrons,
travel through the metal, through
the metallic bridge, to the cathode.

Brieﬂy then, for corrosion to occur,
there must ﬁrst be a difference in
potential between the metals or areas
on the same piece of metal so that
electricity will ﬂow between them.
Next, a release of electrons at the
anode and a formation of metal ions
through disintegration of metal at
the anode. At the cathode, there must
be a simultaneous acceptance of elec-
trons. Action at the anode cannot go
on alone, nor can action at the cathode.

l4

CONTROLLING CORROSION

When corrosion occurs because of
the differences in electrical potential
of dissimilar metals, it is known as
galvanic action. Differences in poten-
tial from point to point on a single
metal surface causes corrosion known
as local action.

When you plan against galvanic
corrosion it is essential to know
which metal in the couple will suffer
accelerated corrosion . . . will act as
the anode in the corrosion reaction.

The galvanic series table shown
below can supply this information.
In any couple, the metal near the top
of this series will be the anode and
suffer accelerated corrosion in a gal-
vanic couple. The one nearer the bot-
tom will be the cathode and remain
free from attack or may corrode at a
much slower rate.

HOW TO USE THE CHART

Notice how the metals are grouped
in the galvanic series table. Any
metal in one group can be safely used
with any other metal in the same
group. However, when you start mix-
ing metals from different groups,
you may run into serious galvanic
corrosion of the metal higher on the
list. And the further apart these
metals are listed, the worse this cor-
rosion may be.

But, if you have to mix metals, pay
particular attention to the electrical
contact between them. Eliminate any
metallic bridges or contacts of metal
to metal that will permit the flow of
electrons through them. You can do
this by separating the metals physi-
cally, or by using insulation or pro-
tective coatings. Another factor is
the relative areas of the metals in
contact with each other. Parts hav-
ing the smaller area should be of a
metal with a lower listing on the
galvanic series table than the metal
used for the larger area.

When you plan against local action,
keep in mind that the corrosion proc-
ess is similar to galvanic action . . .
a movement of electrons from one
point on the metal to another. Natu-
rally, the easiest way to avoid local
action is to use a metal with little or
no impurity . . .. or an alloy with con-
stituents that are listed closely on
the galvanic series table. Local ac-
tion on other metals, however, can
be controlled by stopping any ﬂow of
electrons . . . such as with protective
coatings. Environment, too, is a fac-
tor for consideration.

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS

from Donald W. Douglas, Jr.

President, Douglas Aircraft Company

I’ve been asked whether non-aeronautical engi-
neers have good prospects for advancement in
the aviation industry.

The answer is yes, deﬁnitely !' At Douglas many
of our top supervisory people have moved up from
other engineering specialties. The complexity of
modern aircraft and missiles requires the greatest
variety of engineering skills known to industry.

For example, we now have pressing needs for

MAY 1959

mechanical, structural, electrical and electronics
engineers in addition to aerodynamicists, physi-
cists and mathematicians. Whatever your back-
ground in the engineering profession may be,
there are prime opportunities in the stimulating
aircraft and missiles ﬁeld.

K5@Z/ﬂ@Z7’@ you come to them

Clearly there are such bridges. You started to cross one
of them when you tackled a college education. By electing
an engineering course, you took additional steps. It’s the
bridge that takes you from education to profession.

Perhaps several companies on the “profession side” will
beckon to you. Naturally, you’ll try to choose the ﬁrmest and
highest ground accessible to a beginner—ground that leads
to more challenge, more responsibility and greater reward.
Companies situated on the ﬁrmest and highest ground

will be those whose products or services enjoy a lively and
continuing demand.

As a leader in a broad and exciting ﬁeld, Sikorsky Aircraft
is just such a company. And as an organization with its

eye on the future, each year Sikorsky has openings for young
men who show promise of being able to make outstanding
contributions to the development of direct-lift aircraft.

If you’re almost across that education-to-career bridge, write
for information about careers with the world's pioneer
helicopter manufacturer. Please address Mr. Richard L. Auten,

"So then U.S. Steel invested $770 million in us”

An American baby is born every eight seconds-—11,000 every day——4,000,000 a year. Our population will
soon be over 200 million. And as our population grows, our production must grow. We’ll need millions of
new homes . . . new schools and hospitals . . . new highways to carry 75 million motor vehicles by 1970
. . . not to mention countless appliances and conveniences that haven’t even been invented yet!

No temporary setback can stop the growing needs of our population. That’s why United States Steel
has gone ahead with expenditures totaling $770 million to provide more and better steels for tomorroW’s

citizens. This is the practical way that we’ve demonstrated our faith in the future.

PRESENTING

DR. HUTCHESON

Dr. John A. Hutcheson

Dr. John A. Hutcheson is exceptionally well qualiﬁed
to speak on the achievements of Dr. Fessenden. Dr.
F essenden was a leader in the ﬁeld of electrical communi-
cation and was employed at one time by the Westing-
house Electric Company. Similarly, Dr. Hutcheson is
also employed by Westinghouse and has always been
connected with the development of radio and other
electronic equipment.

Dr. Hutcheson was born January 21, 190.5, in Park
River, North Dakota, the son of a Methodist minister.
His interest in radio began early when he constructed
a wireless set from instructions in a one volume encyclo-
pedia of practical mechanics. The remarkable thing
about this feat was that he was only eight years old at
the time.

By the time he was 16 years old, he was in business
as a repairer and manufacturer of radio sets. His earn-
ings from this business helped pay his way through the
electrical engineering school at the University of North
Dakota. After graduating in 1926, he joined Westing-
house through the graduate student training course.
His ﬁrst position was in radio engineering. Radio tele-
phone and broadcasting transmitters for commercial
stations were Dr. Hutcheson’s main job at this time,
but he also worked on some of the most advanced and
complicated of the Navy transmitters.

In 1940, he was made manager of the Radio Engi-
neering Department which was then being increased to
ﬁve times its prewar size due to the increasing pressures
of the impending World War. Here, Dr. Hutcheson dis-
played his outstanding ability in developing and engi-
neering radio, radar, and other electronic equipment of
advanced design. He also provided guidance for many
of the research projects that led. to some amazing war
time electronic accomplishments. He was also connected
with several phases of the atomic energy program both
during and after the war. At the Bikini post-war tests,
Dr. Hutcheson was one of the few civilian observers.

Dr. Hutcheson became Director of the Westinghouse
Research Laboratories in 1949, and Vice-President sev-
eral months later. Although this would be enough work
for most men, he was soon assigned additional duties
for national defense. As a consequence of the Korean
War, he was appointed chaiman of the ordinance com-
mittee on the Research and Development Board. This
Board has jurisdiction over research and development
of ordinance for the armed services. Soon afterwards,

he was also assigned the duty of being chairman of the
Committee on U. S. Air Force Armament.

In 1955, Dr. Hutcheson was made vice president in
charge of engineering. Here, especially, his engineering
background has proved to be valuable since he is ad-
ministering the details of a large research institution
and acting as a leader in both applied and fundamental
research. Although his engineering background has
been largely concerned with applied research, he has

been able to see the value of fundamental research as
a limit on the engineer. Under his leadership of the
Research Laboratory, the amount of funds spent on
basic research has doubled.

It is indeed a rare thing to find such qualities of
leadership and technical ability in one man. Dr.
Hutcheson’s outstanding contributions to the ﬁeld of

THE FIRST FESSENDEN PROFESSOR

Dr. Tsung Wei Sze

Dr. Sze was named the ﬁrst Fessenden Professor in
the Electrical Engineering Department several years
ago. Prior to his appointment, Dr. Sze had a varied and
sometimes uncertain life.

He was born Tsung Wei Sze, son of a Professor of
Biology in Shanghai. His schooling in China was in-
terrupted in his sophomore year by the invasion of
the Japanese. After trying unsuccessfully to continue
his education at Chungking, he was again forced to
move. He then joined the Nationalist Army and in line
of his military duties spent a short time in military
schools in the United States. At the age of 23, he at-
tained the rank of major. After his military release, he
attended the University of Missouri for one and a half
years for his B. S. in Electrical Engineering. Then he
spent two years at Purdue for his M.S. and three more
years at Northwestern earning his Ph.D. There he met
Frances Tung and they later married. Two years later,
in 1954, he came to Pittsburgh and now lives east
of the city with his wife and two children, Debbie and
David.

Dr.Sze has many duties at the University. He follows
the development work on the Electrical Engineering
curricula and on the electrical layout for the new labor-
atories in Pennsylvania Hall. He teaches such courses
as: A.C. Circuits, Servo Mechanisms and Control
Logic Circuitry, and Digital Computer Theory. Dr.
Sze also directs a large number of graduate theses, a
National Science research project, and he regularly
publishes in the technical journals.

Dr. Sze has certainly done a great deal to carry on
the traditions of Electrical Engineering as instituted by
Professor Fessenden |

BY DR. JOHN A. HUTCHESON

Our ﬁrst glance at a new idea is often likely to be the
most important one. If we ﬁnd the thought to be totally
different from any which we have previously encounter-
ed, we do often consider it to be radical and its author
to be a little crazy. At this point, the engineer as sug-
gested by the author of the above quotation should stop,
investigate, and evaluate. It might be the one big idea
of his lifetime.

All new thoughts appear to be somewhat radical at
ﬁrst, but after they are investigated more thoroughly,
they often are found to be simple truths. By this time,
however, everyone is on the “band-wagon” and anyone
who does not understand the idea is now considered to
be uneducated or uninformed.

No person ever had more intellectual curiosity than
Charles Kettering, inventor of the automobile self-start-
er, and many other things. Even in his eighties, he was
a young man with the same intense desire to investi-
gate any new thought. While he was director of the
General Motors Research Laboratory, he would not
leave this investigation entirely to his staff. He looked
into the matter himself. He ridiculed the smugness of the
“status-quo” attitude in men half his age.

More important than investigating the “radical”
thoughts of others, we should learn to investigate our
own new ideas. We often discard ideas because we are
afraid to be considered “off,” or radical by others.

Each of our minds has encountered entirely differ-
ent combinations of experiences; why should they think
the same thoughts?

Following two years as chief chemist in the labora-
tory of Thomas A. Edison, Fessenden in 1889 became
assistant to the chief electrician of the United States
Electric Lighting Company, a branch of the Westing-
house Electric Company at Newark, New Jersey. Here
Fessenden found himself in a laboratory with a ﬁne
reputation in the electrical industry. Here William
Sawyer’s famous “stopper” lamp underwent develop-
ment; here Hiram Maxim, later to invent the automatic
machine gun and change the whole concept of warfare,
did his work on electric lighting; and here Edward
Weston brought perfection to the crude electrical meas-
uring instruments of his day.

In this laboratory Fessenden worked with William
Stanley and here he took out the ﬁrst two of what was
to become a total of more than 500 patents. Fessenden
worked on silicon-iron, on electrical insulation, on alter-
nating current theory; and he must have performed well,
for apparently he caught the eye of George Westing-
house himself.

Fessenden left industry in 1892 and went to Purdue
as professor of electrical engineering. It was there that
George Westinghouse and the Western University of
Pennsy1vania———then minus its Cathedral of Learning,

THE FESSEN DEN MEMORIAL LECTURE

with an infant electrical engineering department, and
occupying a hilltop overlooking Allegheny City———caught
up with Professor F essenden. This account of the en-
counter has been recorded by his wife:

“. . . Fessenden received a letter from Dr. Holland,
Chancellor of the University . . . saying that Mr. West-
inghouse had informed him that he had a particular
regard for Professor Fessenden and wished, if possible,
that he should be offered the newly created chair of
Electrical Engineering at the University.

This was soon followed by a letter from Mr. West-
inghouse enclosing a check for $1,000 and stating that
he wished to take up the gas secondary incandescent
lamp if Fessenden should be offered the chair at Pitts-
burgh.

Mrs. Fessenden reported that the decision was a
hard one. But you who are associated with this great
university will be pleased to know that it was apparently
a wise one, for again I quote:

“University life was rich with engrossing lectures,
laboratory work, keen students, private and public serv-
ice . . . he was given a comparatively free hand in col-
lege work and suﬂicient leisure for private research . . .
They were years that seemed as if they might go on for-
ever, constructively, quietly, comfortable . . .”

I cannot testify to the way of life of today’s professor
of electrical engineering, but I do suggest that this does
not describe the typical routine his graduates can expect
to ﬁnd in modern industry—especia1ly if their duties
are concerned with engineering management.

Professor Fessenden remained at.the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania until the turn of the century—
seven of the most fruitful years of a long and produc-
tive life. Here his scientiﬁc interests were extended to
microﬁlming, optics, medical and industrial X-ray ap-
paratus, lamps and the annealing of steel. Here he
worked with Dr. Keeler of the Allegheny Observatory,
with John Brashear and with S. M. Kintner, who was
both to succeed him at the University and to become
Vice President of Engineering at Westinghouse. And
here he developed the basic concepts that were to
underline his system of radio communication.

And one wonders if during this period, though his
contacts with the young Westinghouse organization,
Fessenden did not also become imbued with some of the
same vision and purpose that characterized the man
who had done so much to bring him to Pittsburgh. For
looking back in history, one ﬁnds a remarkable coin-
cidence in the lives and work of these two men.

George Westinghouse, too, was a proliﬁc inventor.
With that curious insight peculiar to men of his type, he
saw the ﬂaws in a major technological development
which was rapidly becoming entrenched and which, in
existing form, could only lead to technical frustration
and limited public usefulness. Westinghouse’s “dragon”
was the direct-current system for the generation and
distribution of electric power. Almost singlehandedly he
recognized the superiority of a better method, develop-

ed its essential components, championed it against tre-
mendous odds, and saw his alternating-current system
become universally accepted.

Fessenden lived some of this controversy at the Edison
and the United States Company laboratories. With the
lighting of the Columbian Exposition in 1893, his own
patents had helped to demonstrate publicly the super-
iority of the “Westinghouse” current. Some ﬁve years
later, Fessenden himself began a startlingly similar
struggle to repace an entrenched system of wireless com-
munication with the beginnings of radio as we know it
today.

It is not my purpose here to document in detail the
achievements of Reginald F essenden. Rather, I shall
dwell on them only brieﬂy in order to illustrate the tech-
nical insight, the scientiﬁc versatility, the mental stam-
ina, and the moral purpose of the man——for these
things, I believe, have implication in the technological
struggle that lies ahead of the engineers of today and to-
morrow.

At the time Fessenden came to Western University,
Marconi and others already had demonstrated the
feasibility of wireless telegraphy. Indeed an accepted
system had grbwn up: at the transmitter, electric sparks
of short duration generated the familiar “damped”
oscillations; at the receiver, there was a coherer for de-
tecting the short bursts of energy. Essentially, this co-
herer was a glass tube ﬁlled with iron ﬁlings that tended
to stick together and lower the electrical resistance of a
circuit when a burst of energy impinged on it. Between
bursts, a tapper shook the tube and loosened the ﬁlings
in preparation for the next burst. Thus, an electric cur-
rent ﬂowed in the receiving circuit during these short
pulses of energy, permitting the dots and dashes of wire-
less telegraphy.

Looking back, the disadvantages of such a system are
so apparent that one wonders why only Fessenden was
alert to them and why he had to ﬁght as hard as he did
to convince others of the fact. Fessenden recognized the
coherer for what it was—merely a stop-and-go device
useful only for signals which were chopped up into
pieces. In addition, it was either a fully-on or fully-off
device; a weak signal that flipped it on could not be
distinguished from a strong signal which did exactly the
same thing.

In 1897, while working at Western University with
Kintner and two senior engineering students, it became
obvious to F essenden that such a system would never
really be worthwhile. It was unthinkable that its chop-
ped-up signals could ever transmit the human voice,
nor its intermittent cohere reproduce it. Indeed, as Mr.
Kintner later reported, so ﬁrmly was the coherer ac-
cepted in informed circles, that the chief examiner for
wireless matters in the Patent Office stated positively (if
privately) that voice transmission by wireless methods
was impossible.

F essenden realized that the key to future progress in
wireless communication, be it telegraphy or telephony,
hinged on a receiving device that (1) detected wire-
less signals continuously, not intermittently, (2) re-

sponded proportionally to the strength of the received
signals, and (3) had a low resistance so that advantage
could be taken of resonant tuning. Contrary to his con-
temporaries, Fessenden saw the coherer, not as the
magic device that would guarantee the success of wire-
less, but as the major stumbling block impeding its
progress.

It took technical competance, unusual insight, and
more than the standard amount of determination to
face the world of science and business, tell them they
were wrong and demonstrate it beyond doubt. But F es-
senden did just that. The magnitude of his technical
contributions and the speed with which he made them
are even now regarded by the communications engi-
neer with something akin to wonderment.

First Fessenden developed his continuously operative,
proportionally responding detector. Using it, he could
identify the different tones from different spark trans-
mitters, which he properly discribed as due to the dif-
ferences in their individual radiations. This suggested
to him modulation of the transmitter with the human
voice. To obtain a smoother, more continuous signal he
devised a spark interrupter giving 10,000 breaks per
second. John Brashear built it for him. Fessenden in-
serted a telephone microphone into the circuit and lis-
tened with the new detector. Thus, early in 1901, be-
twen two masts 50 feet high and a mile apart, the
human voice was ﬁrst transmitted by electro-magnetic
radiation.

For optimum performance, the Fessenden system re-
quired a continuous source of radio waves. Seeking it,
he conceived the idea of using a high-frequency a-c gen-
erator connected between antenna and ground. It be-
came the standard technique until replaced by the
vacuum tube oscillator.

On January 1, 1906, between Brant Rock, Mas-
sachusetts and Scotland, Fessenden achieved the ﬁrst
two-way trans-Atlantic wireless telegraphic service. And
using his high-frequency alternator, on Christmas Eve
of that year, he made the ﬁrst radio broadcast. It was
directed to ships at sea in the North Atlantic. Fessenden
apparently was both chief engineer and chief perform-
er. As he, in essence, reported it: “First there was a
speech by me, then some phonograph music, then a
violin solo by me, ending up with words of which I sang
one verse, in addition to playing on the violin, though
the singing of course was not very good.”

During this time, Fessenden made another major
contribution — the heterodyne system, which supplied
tone to continuous-wave telegraphic signals by provid-
ing a local oscillator to beat against the incoming wave
at an audible frequency. This idea, carried out at high-
er frequencies, is still in use in every standard radio,
television and radar set in use today. And in 1907, he
anticipated by many years the practice of linking to-
gether telephone lines, transmitter and receiver in radio
broadcasting.

It these things illustrate Fessenden’s technical com-
pentence, his insight, his vision, his courage—then his
later work illustrates one more essential ingredient of

the engineer. I refer to scientiﬁc versatility, a quality
Fessenden exhibited to a remarkable degree. He invent-
ed a turbo-electric drive for ships, a conveyor system
for parking automobiles (because of the phenomenal in-
crease in automobiles, and this was in 1911), an intern-
al combustion engine, the F athometer, a submarine
detector, a wireless compass and various submarine
signaling devices.

These products of Reginald Fessenden’s fertile mind
led others to call him a “Builder of Tomorrows.” And
indeed he was, for the art he did so much to establish
upon sound scientiﬁc principles a half century ago has
had profound effect upon the world we now know,
and will continue to shape the world we will know to-
morrow.

In view of the speed of present technological events,
one hesitates even to predict what that tomorrow will
be like. Nor, in bringing that tomorrow into being, can
one accurately foresee the countless engineering prob-
lems we will be called upon to face. But one can and
should, I think, make some informed guesses as to where
these major problems lie. And one can and should, I
think, begin now to concern himself with their identiﬁ-
cation and solution. I‘

As any engineer knows, the process of extrapolation
provides a means of predicting what will happen in a
given situation based upon what already has occurred.
And, as any engineer knows, this process is not infallible;
but he recognizes and employs it as a useful and rational
approach to problems solving.

By extrapolation, then, we can look at some of the
major problems of today and can expect them to pro-
vide a clue to the probable engineering problems of the
future. I should like to suggest three broad categories
of endeavor wherein I think the engineer of tomorrow
will ﬁnd his most challenging and socially signiﬁcant
problems. I am sure that the solution of these problems
will require all the competence and foresight and ver-
satility displayed by the man we honor here today. And
I am equally sure that the answers to many of them
will likely require the same sort of technological break-
through that charasterized Fessenden’s work in wire-
less communication.

My convicition is that in the years to come engineers
must become increasingly ingenious in (1) the develop-
ment of ways and means for obtaining the basic raw
materials from which our goods will be made, (2) in
the development of new sources of energy, and (3) in
the development of new ways to increase our productiv-
ity of the goods we want and need.

It is obvious that we, and like us, all peoples of the
world, will require basic materials in ever increasing
abundance. It is equally obvious that as we take these
materials from Mother Nature we deplete the supply she
has provided. Consider, for example, two common ma-
terials—copper and iron.

In the 18th century it was considered impractical to
use copper ores in which the copper content was less
than 13 per cent. By 1900 the average grade of copper
ore being processed was about ﬁve per cent. By 1950 the

average grade of ore had dropped to 0.9 per cent, and
ore containing as little as 0.6 per cent was being process-
ed. Although our copper consumption is actually much
less than that of iron, to obtain the copper we use today,
it is necessary to handle each year as much copper ore
as the annual production of iron ore in the United
States.

The situation with iron is similar. At the present time
our iron-producing facilities need ore containing about
50 per cent iron. At our present rate of usage, the sup-
ply of ore of this quality available in the United States
will last some 15 years. Since 1935 engineers have been
developing processes for the enrichment of lower grade
ores, starting with those having as little as 35 per cent
iron. Again, at our present rate of consumption, ore of
this quality will last no more than an additional 25 years.

As we are forced to lower-grade sources of raw mate-
rials we must extend relatively larger and larger amounts
of energy in their conversion into useful form. We
must handle ever-larger, quantities of materials; we
must dig ever-deeper into the face of the earth; we
must transport our ores from more distant points.
All of these alternatives require energy in abundance.

This leads to the second problem which must receive
the attention of our engineers: the production of in-
creasing amounts of energy. At the present time es-
sentially all our energy comes from fossil fuels, includ-
ing coal, natural gas and petroleum. Together these
sources account for 96 per-cent of our energy supply.
Almost all the remaining four per-cent comes from water
power. It is pertinent to look at the world resources
of fossil fuels. We ﬁnd that estimates of these reserves
vary widely, so to make use of them, I have chosen to
take both the most optimistic and the most pessimistic
estimates. Thus, if we translate all fossil fuels into the
equivalent number of tons of coal, the most optimistic
estimate of the world’s resources places them at 8,000

billion metric tons; the most pessimistic estimate is ten
times smaller. At the present world rate of consumption
of energy, the time for exhaustion of the world’s reserves
is 4000 years optimistically, or4 00 years pessimistically.

It must be emphasized that these estimates are
based on consumption of energy by the peoples of the
world at current rates. These ﬁgures allow nothing for
increase in world population or for a rising standard of
living throughout the world. Today’s world population
is over 2.6 billion. By 1980, United Nation’s estimates
place it at 3.6 billion. Suppose a world population of
even 3 billion wanted to achieve a standard of living
comparable to that which you and I enjoy today. In
such case, the optimistic estimate of our fuel reserve
drops from 4000 to 230 years, and the pessimistic esti-
mate drops from 4:00 to 23 years.

One cannot predict what factors will affect this situa-
tion. But it simply is being realistic to recognize that
the trend is such that by the end of this century the
problem of a supply of energy to maintain our standard
of living well may be acute. Whatever the answer may
be—solar energy, nuclear energy by ﬁssion or fusion,
or sources of energy yet to be disc.overed—certainly

‘4\-.J")

‘Ar 

man’s voracious, frenquently wasteful appetite for
energy must be of increased concern to the engineer
of tomorrow.

These two areas I have mentioned, raw materials and
available energy, constitute the basic ingredients of a
nation’s economy. Translated into automobiles and soap
and tractors and TV sets, they ﬁx our standard of liv-
ing. Translated into missiles and radar and thousands of
other fantastically complicated products, they determine
our chances of survival. Perhaps the engineers’ most
critical task in the years immediately ahead will be to
prove that in this nation, under our economic system,
we can meet both obligations simultaneously. Ever-in-
creasing productivity of the things we can and must
have, is a third major problem area of tomorrow’s engi-
neer.

I have said that an exploding world population is a
contributing factor to the insatiable demand for raw
materials and useful energy. The same holds true for the
products of industrial production. We must bear in
mind, however, that these are not linear relationships.
The population of the United States has little more
than doubled since the turn of the century. But the
amount of steel in use in this country has doubled every
20 years; petroleum production has doubled every 15
years; and the production of, electrical energy has
doubled every 10 years since 1900.

Similarly, our demand for goods and services is grow-
ing at a rate which far outstrips our rate of population
growth, and no one can detect a lessening in our col-
lective desire to increase it further. Things which two
or three decades ago were considered luxuries, or were
not available at any price, are today commonplace and
thought of as necessities. I ask you only to consider
such modern “necessities” as electric refrigerators, cen-
tral heating, automobiles, telcphones—yes, and Pro-
fessor F essenden’s radio, for more homes in the United
States are equipped with radios than with telephones.

But our labor force—those who must produce these
goods and services—grows only as fast as the population.
It is evident that if we are to continue to have the
things we want and need, each laborer must become
more productive. This does not imply that he must
work harder or must put in longer hours. Rather, it
means that he must have more and better tools, more
power at his command, that he can produce more in
a given time with the same or less effort.

The provision of these tools has been called automa-
tion. Automation is not really anything new. Far from
it. Rather, it is a present-day word to describe a pro-
cess that has been going on for a very long time, ever
since man’s need for a product began to outstrip his
ability to build it by hand. Consider, for example, the
manufacture of electric lamps, or what most people call
light bulbs. My company makes these at the rate of ten
a second, day in and day out. They are made by ma-
chines with virtually no human effort, and this has been
going on for decades. For this reason, they have de-
creased in cost ever since they were invented and one
shudders to think what one would cost at today’s labor

rates if it had to be assembled by hand.

The point I am making is that this technique we now
call automation has been evolving over a long period
of time. There seems to be little doubt that it must and
will continue to develop if we are to maintain our own
progress and security and help to bring to the under-
privileged millions of the world the fruits of a better
way of life.

I do not suggest that the engineer alone can solve all
the problems inherent in these areas we have been talk-
ing about. Their solution will require the ingenuity of
many groups of people, professional and nonprofession-
al alike.

But the engineer will play a key role. To him lies the
task of translating the obscure concepts of basic scientiﬁc
research into all the multitude of physical things that
constitute the terribly complicated world in which we
live.

And if the young engineer thinks that there are no
intriguing problems to which to turn his mind, I might
suggest that he consider the following proposition:

One hundred tons of granite, one of the most abund
ant of rocks, contain, in addition to other useful ele-
ments,

8 tons of aluminum
5 tons of iron

1200 pounds of titanium

180. pounds of manganese
70 pounds of chromium
40 pounds of nickel
30 pounds of vanadium
20 pounds of copper
10 pounds of tungsten, and
4- pounds of lead.

Also present in these 100 tons of granite are 4 grams
of uranium and 12 grams of thorium; and the energy
available within them is enough to process the entire
mass of rock and obtain from it the quantities of ma-
terials I have described. All we need is the know-how
to do it.

The engineer creates our technological world. Basic-
ally, he is the one who transforms the data Nature
grudgingly discloses in a bridge, a watch, a cathedral—
or a hydrogen bomb.

That is why, it seems to me, his responsibility to
society outweighs even that of the basic researcher. For,
as one who guides the pursuit of basic scientiﬁc know-
ledge, I am increasingly convinced of two great truths:
the ﬁrst is that man, being the kind of being that he is,
cannot stop the discovery of the facts of Nature, even
if he tries; and the second is that no fact of Nature is
of itself a good fact or an evil one; it is only man’s use of
them that are good or evil.

One can hope that those who ﬁx the destinies of na-
tions will ask of the engineer of tomorrow that he use
his talent only to help build a better environment for
men everywhere. For every engineer, or teacher of en-
gineers, would have said of him, as it was of Reginald
F essenden: “His mind illuminated the past and the
future, and wrought greatly for the present.” I

How to keep the world’s
largest clock sign
turning on time

HIS revolving clock sign, the world’s largest,

weighs in excess of 77 tons, has numerals 25 ft.
high. And it turns day and night atop the Continental
National Bank in Fort Worth, Texas. To keep this giant
clock turning, the engineers speciﬁed two double-row
Timken® tapered roller bearings for the Brewster RSH
18" Rotary Table which turns the clock.

Timken bearings are used because the full-line con-
tact between their rollers and races gives extra load-
carrying capacity. Their tapered construction lets them
take both radial and thrust loads in any combination.
And Timken bearings are geometrically designed and
precision-made to roll true. They practically eliminate
friction.

Timken bearings solve countless problems wherever
wheels and shafts turn. Problems that you may face in
your future job in industry. Our engineers will be
ready to help you. And if you’re interested in a
rewarding career with the world’s largest maker of
tapered roller bearings and removable rock bits, the
leader in special ﬁne alloy steel, send for our free

Product Development at IBM

IBM Engineer Richard R. Booth
explores electronic frontiers

to develop new, faster and
larger storage devices

for tomorrow’s computers.

 

Computing time cut from six months to one day

“My job is to design and develop new, high-speed
storage devices for a powerful new computer that
will perform, in one day, operations requiring six
months on present equipment,” said Dick Booth
as he began a typical day recently. A product de-
velopment engineer at the IBM Laboratories in
Poughkeepsie, N. Y., he started his morning with a
conference on a product of great interest to him: a
magnetic core storage device with a nondestructive
read-out feature. For an hour, he discussed with
circuit design engineers the logical devices needed
for the register—such as magnetic core drivers and
sense amplifiers. Should such devices not be avail-
able, the group would work on designs for new ones.

Dick Booth next met with members of the Mag-
netic Materials Group to establish specifications for
the magnetic core memory elements to be used in
the register. He also discussed with the group the
development of equipment to test the memory
elements. “This magnetic core register is based on
an original idea of mine,” he explained. “When you
have a worthwhile idea, you will be given a free
hand in proving it out, backed by lBM’s resources
— plus the assistance of skilled specialists.”

Increasing responsibility

At 10:30, Dick Booth reviewed the status of the
entire project with the two engineers, two tech-
nicians, and one logic designer who make up his
team. “My present position is staff engineer,” he
explained. “|t’s the second promotion I've had
since I joined IBM three years ago with a B.S.E.E.
degree from the University of Illinois. I know that
there are plenty of other opportunities to move
ahead. Furthermore, parallel advancement oppor-
tunities exist for engineers in either engineering
development or engineering management."

Preparing for the future

In the afternoon, Dick Booth went to the 704 Com-
puting Center to supervise some complex preci-
sion computations. “You see how quickly the 704
arrives at the answers,” he said. “The computer
being developed is expected to multiply more than
500,000 fourteen-digit numbers a second and add
them at the rate of one million a second. The-.com-
puter may be used for design computations for
reactors, as well as calculations of satellite be-
havior. Of course it should have hundreds of other
applications."

At 3:30 P.M., Dick Booth attended a weekly class
on Theoretical Physics that lasted until 5:00. After-
ward, he commented, “You know, IBM offers
excellent educational opportunities both in gen-
eral education and for advanced degrees. One of
the engineers in my group has just received his
Master's degree from Syracuse University, after
completing a postgraduate program given right
here at the IBM Laboratory."

 

A chance to contribute

SHOOTING-STAR SNAPSHOTS

Photographs tracking “visitors_ from outer space”
may lead to improved long-range weather prediction.

In a talk on space photography, Dr. Swann, East-
man Kodak scientist, told how pictures of meteor
tracks in the upper atmosphere provide information on
wind velocities at extremely high altitudes. Thisiinfor-
mation, combined with studies of the aurora—the eerie
light in the sky at the North and South Poles—may en-
able scientists to predict weather with increased accur-
acy.

Swann described studies scientists will make in the
future with more reﬁned instruments and techniques.
The studies will include examination of wavelengths of
radiant energy too long or too short to penetrate the
earth’s atmosphere.

Swann said ﬁve objects in space——Venus, Mars, Jupi-
ter, the moon and the sun—wil1 be of particular inter-
est to photographic scientists in coming years. He said
that our entire scientiﬁc conception of ‘these objects and
indeed of the universe, is based upon photography and
of the analysis of eminations from the planets, stars and
galaxies. But our ﬁve closest neighbors are in for much
more intense observation in the near future, ﬁrst perhaps
from picture transmitting satellites.

EIGHTY FOUR INCH MIRROR CAST

The largest glass telescope mirror blank made since
the 200-inch Mt. Palomar disk has just been cast by
the Corning Glass Works. The disk is 84 inches in dia-
meter and weighs over 2500 pounds. It is 13 inches
thick and has a center hole 36 inches in diameter.

Melted down at temperatures reaching approximately
2300 degrees Fahrenheit, the molten blank has been
transferred from the furnace to a specially-built anneal-
ing kiln for scientiﬁc cooling which will continue for
seven months.

The disk was formed by a sagging process in which
separate pieces of glass are placed on the mold and
melted to shape. Nine separate chunks of glass were
melted down to form the big blank. The largest piece
weighed 2,796 pounds.

With completion of the annealing cycle, the disk will
be crated and shipped to Tucson, Arizona where it
will be ground and polished before being hauled to
the observatory site, the 6,875 foot Kitt Peak.

Massive ducts with ﬂex joints are used on the engines
of the Atlas, Thor, Jupiter and Redstone missiles now
under development at Rocketdyne, a Division of North
American Aviation, Inc. The metal, A-286, used in
this duct work is a special high temperature alloy used
for a low temperature application. The alloy is made
by Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation. These special
ducts must carry liquid oxygen from the pump to the
thrust chamber. The temperature changes encount-
ered in doing this, range from a minus 297 de-
grees F. to a plus 700 degrees F. The use of light
weight, corrosion and temperature resistant metals con-
tributes to the ruggedness and reliability of these high-
thrust, liquid propellant power plants. A-286 is unusual-
ly strong at low temperatures as well as at the elevated
temperatures.

A GREAT WEEK

Engineers’ Week activities, the
year’s biggest social and competi-
tive events for the engineering stu-
dents, took place the week of March
16-21. The week commemorates the
birthday of St. Patrick, which is on
March 17.

Engineers’ Week began with the
arrival of St. Patrick on the Uni-
versity campus. In past years, St.
Patrick has arrived by helicopter,
truck, tank, Conestoga wagon and
other contrivances. This year, how-
ever, St. Patrick showed his inter-
est in the space age by coming on
the back of an army missile. Of
course, the missile was fastened to
the bed of an army trailer. The ar-
rival fest-ivities featured Rege Cor-
dic, well known radio comedian, as
Master of Ceremonies.

HOW TO GET

FINANCIAL HELP

Central Scholarship Office Director explains
the University financial aid policies.

Colleges need more money to pay better faculty salar-
ies, build new buildings and buy new equipment. Stu-
dents need more money from home or elsewhere to
make college attendance possible. The country needs
more college graduates to maintain its military, eco-
nomic, and scientiﬁc world leadership. Success in meet-
ing these national, institutional, and individual needs
depends on the speed with which funds can be found to
pay the bill.

Frequently in recent years we have read stories
heralding the fact that many scholarships are lying
idle, begging for recipients to claim them. College
ﬁnancial aid oﬁicers are often approached on this sub-
ject, and in most cases have been able to prove the
fallacy of such a statement.

rector of the Central Scholarship Office, before they are
considered for a s-cholarship.

BY EARL R. FIELDER

At the present time, however,» it is exceedingly im-
portant that misconceptions concerning the ﬁnancial
need of students and colleges be eradicated. We have
come to that crucial point in our higher educational
system where both the student and institution must
adjust to meet the true cost of a college education.

The University of Pittsburgh has in the past two
years taken several steps in analyzing this very ‘prob-
lem. Changes have been made to affect a higher degree
of eﬂiciency in the operation of the total ﬁnancial aid
program available to the University students.

Of particular importance was the establishment of
Central Scholarship Office wherein the administration
of the total ﬁnancial aid program has been placed.
To assist this office in developing common practices
to be carried out by all schools and divisions of the
University, a University Committee on Scholarships
and Student Aid was appointed.

The central scholarship office, located in Room 107,

Schenley Hall, is responsible for administering all
scholarship funds. It serves as (1) the central agency
for the distribution, collection, and recording of all
scholarship and student loan applications, (2) the
central agency for maintaining records of all scholar-
ship and loan funds, (3) maintaining liaison with all
outside sources who lend support to the University’s
ﬁnancial aid program, (4) serving as a counselling
agency for all students desirous of information on
scholarship and student loan matters, (5) maintains
contacts with outside groups who sponsor scholarship
or loan programs for which University students may
qualify, and (6) works in cooperation with each of
the schools of the University in maintaining the ﬁnan-
cial aid program for their students.

The staff of the Central Scholarship Office is avail-

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

able to all students for any such information as it may
be able to supply toward meeting the cost of their col-
lege education.

The University Committee on Scholarships and Stu-
dent Aid is advisory to the Assistant Chancellor for
Student Affairs on all matters to the University’s total
ﬁnancial aid program.

Members of this University Committee, who are
representatives of individual undergraduate and pro-
fessional schools, are also chairmen of their respective
school 0 Scholarship Committees. Professor Walter R.
Turkes, Associate Dean, and head of the department of
Industrial Engineering is chairman of this commi-ttee
for the Schools of Engineering and Mines.

It is the function of the Engineering and Mines
Scholarship Committee to act on all scholarship mat-
ers in which Engineering and Mines students are in-
volved. All upperclass scholarship applications are act-
ed on by this group, whether these be “ﬁrst time” ap-
plications or those up for renewal.

In general, the operating policy of the Scholarship
Committees in relation to upperclass scholarship awards
is as follows:

1. The ﬁnancial aid resources available to the stu-
dents enrolled in the Schools of Engineering and
Mines are intended to be of beneﬁt to students
who need such assistance in meeting their col-
lege expenses. In order to make awards from the

funds available with due consideration to the
applicant’s ﬁnancial need, the Central Scholar-

ship Oﬂice requires each candidate to ﬁle the
Parents’ Conﬁdential Statement of the College
Scholarship Service. All information received on
this form is treated conﬁdentially. Thus, a “needs
analysis” is made on each application in order to
guide the Scholarship Committee in determining
the size of award to be given a candidate if the
Committee ﬁnds he meets the other scholarship
criteria.

2. Any student ﬁling the appropriate application
forms and qualifying under the following criteria
will be considered for a scholarship award:

Entering sophomores should have maintain-
ed a Quality Point Average of at least 2.50
as a freshman.

Junior and seniors should have maintained
a “B minus” Quality Point Average for their
sophomores; 1.75 for current juniors.)
The applicant should also possess those per-
sonal qualities of character and citizenship
which indicate leadership potential.

What does a scholarship mean? The preceding para-
graph indicates those personal, academic, and ﬁnan-
cial qualiﬁcations a Pitt student should have in order
to be considered for a scholarship award. Let us say
that you, the reader, are the recipient of one of these
awards. What does this mean—not only to you alone,
but to the University as well. Is this just a check——a
free ride for partial or full tuition—or what real mean-
ing does it carry? Let’s investigate from two stand-

MAY 1959

points, the University’s and the student’s.

To the University your scholarship award is an indi-
cation of the institution’s willingness to invest in your
future. It is the belief‘ of those people charged with
the responsibility of making this decision that you
possess those qualities which exemplify superior schol-
arship, ideal citizenship, and leadership potential. This
is an honor for any student to carry high. It is not
“just a check,” it is an investment which will bring that
one return—success of an individual for the future bet-
terment of all mankind.

Today we cannot measure the meaning of a scholar-
ship by its dollar value. If your award carried a $400.00
stipend and another student’s only $200.00, it was
once believed that you were twice as good as the other
fellow. All too often, students today give no more

for scholarship aid.

meaning to a scholarship award than to have it as an
instrument of comparison. There is no question that a
scholarship is a distinguishing mark—one of leader-
ship and achievement——but for the individual it should
carry one more feature, that being humility. Humble
to the task ahead, humble to the investment being
made by the University, and humble to the fact that if
the opportunity presents itself you will help some
youngster in the next generation.

How will the trimester affect Pitt students. Begin-
ning in September, 1959 for Freshman and Sophomore
students, a new consideration must be given to meeting
college expenses. _

Students desiring to elect the Trimester Plan will
ﬁnd that in order to participate in the third semester,
funds, which would ordinarily not be spent until the
next fall, must be made available four months early.
Some students and their families will be able to meet
this demand, others will not.

Each applicant for ﬁnancial aid will -be required to
declare in advance his intentions of attending either
two or three trimesters. The Scholarship Committee
will then be able to calculate the student’s total need.

33

Scholarships and loans will be combined in many of
these awards, with each case receiving individual at-
tention.

It is not anticipated that the Trimester Plan will
create any disability to our current scholarship and
loan program. Of great importance though, is that the
student investigate thoroughly his ﬁnancial status to
determine its feasibility in his own case.

A very disturbing problem in higher education today
is the fact that last year about 200,000 high school
seniors who had the ability to go on to college were
unable to do so for ﬁnancial reasons. It is a further
fact that several thousand more college students leave
before receiving their degrees for ﬁnancial reasons.

The nation’s universities and the federal government
have come up with the logical answer to these and
many other ﬁnancial problems of the students through
loan funds.

Repayment terms for student loans are quite liberal
as indicated in the brief description of the three major
loan funds which are available to Engineering and Mines
students, including the government sponsored National
Defense Education Act Student Loan Fund.

Heinz Student Educational Loan Fund—-annual loans
up to a maximum of $1000.00 per year are available
through this fund. The trust fund requires an insurance

policy assigned to the University covering 125% of the
loan as security on each loan. Repayment can extend
through ten years after graduation, the ﬁrst three years
interest free, the fourth and ﬁfth years at 2%, and the
last ﬁve years at 4% on the unpaid annual balance.

American Society for Civil Engineers—a loan fund
established by the Pittsburgh Section of the A.S.C.E. for
civil engineering students only. A maximum loan of full
tuition may be arranged annually from this fund for a
period extending ﬁve years after graduation at a 2%
interest rate beginning with the date of graduation.

Government Loans——These are loans made available
through the National Defense Education Act of 1958.
Students may borrow up to $1000.00 a year from this
source, or a total of $5,000.00 covering both their
undergraduate and graduate studies. Simple interest,
at a rate of 3% annually, beginning one year after grad-
uation and extending over a ten year period. Repayment
may be postponed a maximum of three years for active
duty in the armed services. Students are selected on a
competitive basis, with those maintaining good grades
and demonstrating severe need receiving ﬁrst considera-
tion.

Any student wishing to negotiate any type of tuition
loan should make his application through the Central
Scholarship Oﬁice. I

COMMAND DESTRUCT

The ﬂight testing of second generation missiles—more versatile
and powerful than their predecessors—requires a device for sure
termination of any missile ﬂight that might endanger the test
range or surrounding area.

Ramo-Wooldridge engineers, under a United States Army Signal
Corps contract, have successfully developed and delivered the
first sub-miniature, completely transistorized radio “command
destruct” receivers.

Specifically designed for missile ﬂight safety operations, the
receiver (AN/DRW-11) can actuate safety mechanisms or destruct
devices. It has three command channels, each of which actuates
a control relay.

The “command destruct" receiver accepts frequency modulated
signals in the UHF radio command control band. It is designed
to operate with closer radio frequency and command frequency
channel spacing than has been used to date, thus making possible
more eflicient use of the available radio spectrum._

Compact and rugged, the radio receiver’s modular construction
permits rapid and complete accessibility to all components. One
module houses the basic receiver. The second module contains
the three command channels and relays. This integrated package
occupies 115 cubic inches, and weighs 4 pounds. The receiver
requires no pressurization and operates reliably under the adverse
environmental conditions encountered in missile flight testing.

Engineers and scientists interested in being associated with some
of the nation’s most advanced research and development programs
are invited to acquaint themselves with current opportunities at
Ramo-Wooldridge. The areas of activi listed below are those

By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock & Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&\W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.

Here’s an indication of what's going on at B&\W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world’s
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the ABC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.

These are but a few of the projects—not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.

How is the company doing right now? Let's look at one

Benjamin Franlzlinmon science and humanity

"The rapid progress true science now makes. occasions
my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon. It is
impossible to imagine the height to which may be
carried, in a thousand years, the power of man over
matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large masses
of their gravity. and give them absolute levity, lor the
sake of easy transport. Agriculture may diminish its
labor and double its produce; all diseases may by sure

means be prevented or cured, not excepting even llus.
of old age. and our lives lengthened at pleasure even
beyond the antediluvian standard. 0 that moral science
were in as lair a way of improvement, that men would
cease to be wolves to one another, and that human beings
would at length learn what they now improperly call
humanity!"

Take your pick—water skiing, skin diving, or just
skimming along the surface. Aﬂoat, boats mean fun.
But there’s a big difference ashore. Some boats de-
mand wearisome hours of work——caulking, repaint-
ing, replanking. And here’s where PPG research
comes in. Thanks to hulls made from PPG Selec-
tron® and Fiber Glass, boat owners never have to
worry about upkeep and costly repairs. PPG Fiber
Glass hulls can’t peel, can’t rot or corrode. And what
a beating their one-piece construction can take!
There are no seams. No nails. No screws. No rivets
to rust or loosen. There’s new styling freedom, too.
Boats of PPG Fiber Glass can take any shape, yet
they’re strong, light and durable.

Fiber Glass and Selectron polyester resins arejust
two of a long roster of products developed from the

Here’s how PPG research put more FUN in boating

many facets of PPG’s research. Every day, the
scientists and engineers at PPG work toward de-
veloping new products and new applications for
established products to beneﬁt our living in count-
less ways. Right now, long range research is being
directed toward finding new uses for Selectron res-
ins and Fiber Glass, toward screening and improv-
ing original ideas and molding them into practical
applications. The possibilities are endless.

PPG’s versatile products offer exciting career
possibilities. So, if you want a career with challeng-
ing opportunities and a real and rewarding future,

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

During the past year, SKY-
SCRAPER ENGINEER has pre-
sented articles on a wide variety of
subjects. Technical articles, the
mainstay of the magazine, were in-
terspersed with articles designed to
appeal to the non-engineering as
well as the engineering student.

Foremost among these non-tech-
nical articles was the series entitled
“The Thundering Heard.” In this
series, SKYSCRAPER gave several
Pitt students an opportunity to ex-
press their feelings on a variety of
subjects, from religion to education.

In addition to “The Thundering
Heard” in each issue, the entire
February magazine was devoted to
Pittsburgh’s Bicentennial. In a non-
technical manner, SKYSCRAPER
described the advances made in the
past several years by the Renaissance
City. Articles on speech, E&M Cab-
inet, and Pitt’s New Radio Station
rounded out the year’s non-technical
articles.

In this, the ﬁnal issue of the spring
semester, SKYSCRAPER ENGI-
NEER again presents articles of
wide and ‘lasting interest. The scope
of this magazine extends from re-
ports of happenings and opportuni-
ties on the Pitt campus to scientiﬁc
and technical articles.

As an annual feature, SKY-
SCRAPER announces the outstand-
ing seniors in the schools of Engi-

On the technical side, Carl W.
Beaumariage’s “Brookhaven Explor-
es the Atom” describes the theory
and practices in the building of
Brookhaven Laboratory’s Proton
Synchrotron. Read how scientists
plan to use this particle accelerator
to reveal many of nature’s secrets.

Of particular interest to Pitt stu-
dents in general is “How to Get Fi-
nancial Help,” an article describing
the opportunities afforded students
in the area of scholarship aid. Mr.
Earl Fielder, Director of the Central
Scholarship Oﬂice, clariﬁes the schol-
arship policy of the University as it
affects the Engineering student on
the Trimester Program.

A picture story of this year’s En-
gineers’ Week highlights one of the
most colorful activities on campus.

In these articles, and the many
more which appear in this issue, is
a variety of information which is
sure to be of interest to all.
