GO WESTINGHOUSE,
YO U N G M A N! Zl“§l'§;§cl2°;L“gL“.'l

There was once a college senior named Al Addin who
yearned for his place in the sun.

However, at graduation time so many companies offered
him a job, AI didn't know which one to accept.

Then he met a Mr. Greeley, the recruiter from Westing-
house. Mr. Greeley was a kindly man with a warm smile.
He described to Al how at Westinghouse young men have
their choice of six operating groups* and work in friendly,
tight-knit little teams on the world’s most exciting projects.

“Go Westinghouse, young man,” Mr. Greeley urged.

And Al Addin did. He wanted to be part of Westinghouse
efforts to help the nation rebuild cities," so he joined the
corporation's Construction Group — supplier of the world’s
widest range of products for the construction market.

One day, while Al was polishing a Westinghouse lamp,
a Jeanie appeared. This pretty, warmhearted, intelligent
Jeanie was an engineer with the Elevator Division. (Women
are welcome at Westinghouse, an equal opportunity em-
ployer.) As the daughter of one of the richest men in Amer-
ica, Jeanie was in a position to grant Al Addin three wishes.

Al’s first wish —to help Westinghouse build a municipal
complex of apartments, offices, stores and parks within an
established metropolitan area.

Al’s contribution to the project was to help develop a
computerized environmental analysis technique—an in-
genious system for precalculating the heating and cooling
needs of all the buildings in the complex. Grateful archi-
tects and consulting engineers voted Al the year's most
calculating supplier.

Al’s second wish-—to help develop a total transporta-
tion system for a new housing area being built.

Transportation for the new project would consist not
only of a remote-controlled mass transit system, taking
commuters to and from their places of business . . . but
it would also include sophisticated elevator and electric
stairway systems to be installed within the project's ter-
minal and living areas.

Al's third and last wish—to marry Jeanie.

She consented on the condition that he let her join him
on other major projects and urban systems assignments
undertaken by Westinghouse throughout the world.

Al Addin agreed . . . and they lived happily ever after.
MORAL: All your wishes for a prosperous career can be
granted if you join Westinghouse, where awaiting you are
challenges, hard work, building block education, travel.
adventure, and yes, even romance.

You can be §_u_r§ if it's Westinghouse

For further information, contact the Mr. Greeley from West-
inghouse who will be visiting your campus during the next
few weeks or write: L. H. Noggle, Westinghouse Educa-
tional Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15221.

PRESENTING
CONVAIR

...A Great Name in Aerospace

Dynamics Corporation is one of the
largest and most sophisticated
aerospace and research firms in the
country. It was formed in 1965 through
the merger of two divisions of General
Dynamics: the old Convair Division and the
Astronautics Division, both in San Diego.
The heritage of Convair dates back to
aircraft production prior to and during
World War II. In recent years the former
Convair Division produced the Air Force
F-102 and F-106 iet Interceptors, the 880
and 990 /et transports, and the Little Joe
solid rocket booster. The Astronautics
Division was the home of the Atlas, the first
free-wor/d ICBM, and the subsequent
development of the Atlas as one of the
nation's major space launch vehicles;
many other aerospace and research
programs were undertaken by Astronautics
including Centaur—the first U.S. space
rocket powered by liquid hydrogen.

The Convair Division of General

Company Description

Convair is primarily involved in research.
development and production connected
with the aerospace industry. its primary
efforts are in complete systems and
programs. The spectrum includes space

cial and military aircraft and oceanographic
research.

Major programs include the Atlas space
launch vehicle; the Atlas/Centaur booster
program used to put the Su rveyor space-
craft on the moon; the design and installa-
tion of complete telemetering stations;
conversion programs on Convair military

AIR POLLUTION

Our increasing industrialization and rise in standard of
living can be closely correlated to our increasing problem of
air pollution. Air pollution is a health problem as well as
an econoimc problem. What exactly is air pollution? What
is smog?

In 1959, these words were spoken by a housewife, deﬁn-
ing the air pollution problem she had to live with:

“Occasionally, we are subjected to a fine dust which settles
even on the furniture within our homes, to smokes and
odors, to fumes which discolor paint and sting the eyes and
burn the throat. We can, from time to time, detect the odors
of skunks, dead animals, rotten cabbage — and sometimes, a
sweet and nauseous medicine odor.” I

In many locations throughout the United States, these
problems, or part of them, may be witnessed even today.
During the last century, a smoky area was a sign of industry
and progress. But today, our ideas are different. In the last
twenty years, some of our former smoky cities, such as
Pittsburgh, have solved many of their air pollution problems.

Polttt/on Control.

By

Dennis P.

Santini

Sixteen years ago, the first nationwide conference on air
pollution met. Until that time, smoke prevention was of
some concern. Air pollution control, however, in its broad
aspects, is fairly new.

“There are several ways of looking at air pollution from
a physiological standpoint. They are exposure, location,
frequency and duration.” 3 '

In the course of a day, each of us expose our lungs to
many times more pounds of air than his combined food and
water intake. We have, in the past, done a great deal to
control food and water quality. However, relatively little
on a large scale has been done to purify the air we breathe.

Most of our air pollution problems are associated with
principal locations. These locations are the metropolitan
areas of the United States. Approximately one-half of the
population resides in these areas, which account for only
about 2% of the total land space. Therefore, about
50% of our wastes are pouring out in this fairly small area.

Taking an example, “we know that the frequency of lung
cancer is about twice as great in urban as in rural areas.
There is also a higher frequency for stomach and esophagus
cancer.”3

The standpoint of fre'qu'enc'y and duration is illustrated
by the acute pollution problems encountered in such places
as London in 1952 and 1956 and in Donora, Pa., in 1948.
The immediate physiological effects are easily seen. The

ellects of long—range exposure, however, may take years to

develop.

Relative importance of cigarette smoking and air pollu-
tion in causing lung cancer is, according to some, quite de-
ﬁnite. As one public health expert stated, “It seems quite
probable that inhaled pollutants ﬁnd their way into the
esophagus and stomach via solution or suspension in body
fluids which are swallowed.”

“As evidence,” he continued, “we know that during acute
[pollution] episodes, some people suffered severe gastro-
intestinal disturbances, showing there must have been inges-
tio'n of air—borne pollutants.” 2

Not only is air pollution implicated with cancer, but also
with pneumonia, bronchitis, and emphysema.

Air pollution takes an economic toll also. Crops are
damaged, rubber is embrittled, metals are corroded, and most
generally-used building materials are weathered. Air pollu-
tion, according to a government estimate, is costing the U. S.
between 10 and 12 billion dollars a year in property damage
alone.

WI'Ia‘l' i-s ii’?

A major goal of today’s research on air pollution is to
ﬁnd out what the pollutants are and how they are formed.
The broad classes of major pollutants are sulfur, nitrogen,
various hydrocarbons, dusts, and other solid particulate mat-
ter. In general, the offending materials in a particular com-
munity’s pollution problem are complex mixtures of gases,
vapors, fumes, mists, and solids.

As one can see from the following table, there are safety
limits on certain vapors and gases. The limits on combina-
tions of these are difficult to deﬁne. However, a condition of
pollution exists if these limits are individually or collectively
exceeded.

From /{M/I /lrc/1/z/c.c 0/ Industrial Health, August, 1958.

The chief offenders in the sulfur class of pollutants are
sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, and hydrogen sulﬁde. Sulfur
dioxide (S02) is released into the atmosphere primarily by
the burning of coal and oil. In the Pennsylvania—West
Virginia area, a large quantity of S02 is discharged into
the air by mine refuse.

This “black rock” mine refuse has a low percentage of
coal and a large percentage of ash and sulfur. Through
spontaneous combustion, large quantities of S02 and C0
are given 05. Hydrogen sulfide (I-IZS) enters the air chiefly
through the action of bacteria on sulfur-containing com-
pounds in stagnant industrial wastes.

Sulfur dioxide unites with moisture in the air and is
oxidized to form sulfuric acid (H2 SO 4). The H2 S04 is
blamed for causing respiratory ailments in many areas where
air pollution exists.

Another of the major causes of air pollution is the nitro-
gen compounds. In particular, we have nitrogen dioxide
(N02) and nitric oxide (NO). These compounds are
delivered to the atmosphere primarily in automobile exhausts
and industrial waste gases.

Who} is Smog?

Smog is not caused by the initial air pollutants, but by
the products of an intricate series of reactions between these
compounds. When hydrocarbons, including oleﬁns, (un-
saturated open-chain hydrocarbons with at least one double
bond) are exposed to the sun’s ultraviolet radiation in the
presence of NO and N02, the series of reactions occurs.
The hydrocarbons come mainly from automobile exhausts
and carburetor and fuel tank evaporation losses.

The end products of these reactions include aldehydes,
nitrogen-containing organic compounds, and ozone. The
sharp eye irritants and crop-damaging compounds in these
products are formaldehyde, acrolein, and peroxyacyl nitrates.

In this short article I have attempted to introduce the
air pollution problem of today. Many research, educational,
and industrial organizations are now seeking an answer to
the problem. At present the federal and state governments
are taking a stronger lead in promoting research and prob-
lem solution practice. Within a short time we may very
well see great strides forward in the solution of this very
definite and critical problem.

Of course, if your father's a millionaire, or you're about to marry an heiress,
then you have no problems. But, if not, then there's only one sensible thing to
do. Come to work at Allison Division of General Motors.
There's nothing cold or cruel here. Just the opposite. Particularly if you're an
engineer with big ideas. Aerospace projects? Allison's got them. Turbofan.
 Turbojet. Turboprop. Turboshaft. Military and commercial applications right
across the board.

Maybe you're more down—to—earth. Fine. Some of Allison's advanced motor ve-
to   hicle projects will be more your cup of tea. Like the new M551 General Sheridan,

“Rich Man,
Poor Man,

By

(7716 following is the text of 41 ypeec/1 prc'.»‘c’ntc’z/ by Dr.
Stuart to the Pitt Student C/mpter of 1/16’ National Society
of I’r0fe5si0nal Engineenc on Nozlenzbcr 2], I966.)

Back in 1895, William Allen White was quite famous
for some of his provocative editorials written for the
Emporia, KLlﬂ5tlJ' Daily, and the Gazette. One of these
editorials should he very familiar toiyou. He answered a
letter from a little girl who asked if there was a Santa Claus.
His editorial answer began, “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus . . ." and White went on to rationalize the existence
of Santa Claus in the spirit of people during the holiday
season.

Today I feel a hit like White in discussing the National
Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE). I could title this
talk, “Yes, Virginia, there is an engineering profession."

I plan to develop three main themes; ﬁrst, I feel we must
identify both the term Engineering and then the term Pro-
fession. Second, I believe that I can identify the existence
of an Engineering Profession. Lastly, I hope to show how
NSPE is working toward the solution of the major problem
in establishing engineering as a true profession.

I3

In my terms, engineering is the application of science to
solve mankind's problems with the constraints of economics
and sociology.

It is easy to illustrate these terms with examples. Con-
sider two of our major problems in the United States today,
the problems of water and air pollution. Scientiﬁc solutions
to both problems are readily available. We can provide a
simple scientiﬁc answer to each of these. To clean up the
water, we need only to distill it. This is a sL1re, simple
scientiﬁc solution. An engineer recognizes the futility of
suggesting such a solution when he sees the tremendous
economic problem involved. To clean up our air we could
outlaw all of the automobiles that produce the tremendous
quantities of nitrous oxides which cause hazardous smogs.
An engineer quickly recognizes the interacting social con-
flict if such a solution were attempted. (Engineers are con-
cerned with such things as the “Airport Syndrome”)

Today‘s engineer is, and should be, an applied scientist
within the constraints of economics and sociology.

I believe that a true profession is not created by itself.
A profession is created by all of the people who depend
upon certain members of society to perform a speciﬁc duty
for society, acting only on behalf of the people of that
society.

You may use as many examples as you wish. Consider
all of those who are now professionals and you will ﬁnd
that this rule has not been violated. In each case society
found a problem or duty that could best be solved or per-
formed by a few of its members. It is only after these few
were found to be dependable -— it is only after society found
it could place its full trust in these few that the profession
could come into full existence.

I might extrapolate a bit here and warn the other pro-
fessions analogously, if society no longer needs their services,
or if society begins to distrust them, their profession will no
longer exist.

A good friend, Dr. George of our School of Denistry.
explained that we are now graduating Doctors of Dental
Medicine and not Doctors of Dental Surgery. I suspect the
rising use of ﬂuorides and other preventative measures
would be disasterous to a profession which was limited to
repairing or extracting defective teeth.

Although the need for the services may continue to exist,
if any profession begins to lose the conﬁdence or trust of
society, it may cease to exist. If I were a member of the
medical profession, .I would be quite worried about the
satirical jokes indicating a greater love for golf and income
than for house calls or selfless devotion to duty. These jokes
are a warning that society is registering a protest. These
jokes are a plea — people are asking for a reason for their
continued conﬁdence in the group to whom they have
entrusted this important profession.

Although it is quite recent in our history, society has felt
the need for someone to act for them in applying the results
of the new science. Military engineers have been with us
for centuries. These military engineers were responsible only
to heads—of-state or the military leaders. They were compe-
tent but they were not working for all of the people.

As our technology expanded to affect their lives, the

‘I4

public came to depend upon some civilians to abstract the
best of science and apply "it to solve their problems. From
the data of a recent public opinion pool taken by NSPE, I
ﬁnd that the public is well aware of all of the complex
problems that an engineer must solve. The public has recog-
nized the need for this professional group. With the expo-
nential growth of technology, I think that it is very evident
that the need for such a profession within our society is not
only obvious, but it is increasing.

The next condition which must be met to assure engi-
neering the unquestioned status as a profession in every
sense of the word —— is the identiﬁcation of those people that
the public can trust. I believe this public identiﬁcation of a
group that it may trust to handle its applied science affairs
is the major problem of the engineer today.

From the NSPE opinion survey that I mentioned earlier,
I found that the public is beginning to respect the engineer.
I believe that the engineer ranked in status below the
physician and the clergyman, but I believe he ranked on a
par with or slightly above the lawyer.

It is also interesting at this point to realize that in our
recent popular literature the engineer is a bit more well
respected than the scientist. I’m pleased that there are lots of
“Mad Scientist” stories. Those science ﬁction tales where
the “Mad Scientist” uses ingenious scientiﬁc discoveries
against rather than for mankind. Thank God there are no
“Mad Engineer" stories. Perhaps the public trusts the
engineer a bit, after all.

Because of this indication of some status and a bit of
trust in the eyes of society, I can honestly say, “Yes, Virginia,
there is an engineering zrofession.” My engineering pro-
fessional at this time is as etherial as Santa Claus. Like a bit
of the Christmas spirit showing up among many people, the
engineering professional appears among many. As soon as
society can properly identify qualiﬁed engineers, then the
engineering profession will enjoy full rank and privileges
with the other professions.

This process of public identiﬁcation of the members of a
trusted profession comes slowly. It must be slow and the
identiﬁcation must be earned. We cannot demand it, for if
we do, we will not be accepting the public gift of profes-
sional stature. Demanding recognition will only delay the
public trust. I believe that NSPE is doing the proper things
to gain this identiﬁcation for all engineers. Although it
takes much time, NSPE is trying to tell the public who are
the engineers.

The formation of the ﬁrst National Society to separate
non-military (civil) engineers from the military group began
with the founding of the American Society of Civil Engi-
neers in 1852. The American Institute of Mining Engineers
was formed in 1871, the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers in 1880, the American Institute of Electrical Engi-
neers in 1884, and the American Institute of Chemical Engi-
neers was founded as late as 1908. These ﬁve are considered
the founding societies.

It was only 26 years after the last of the founding
societies was formed that the state engineering societies of
Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut

banded together to form NSPE in 1934.

At present the NSPE includes 50 state societies, Puerto
Rico, District of Columbia, and the Canal Zone. Its 53 mem-
ber societies have some 500 chapters and 55,000 members.
There are a total of 250,000 registered engineers out of about
490,000 qualiﬁed engineers. From these ﬁgures, it is obvious
that NSPE has about 12% of the total qualiﬁed engineers,
and 22% of the registered engineers. Again, only a little
over half of the qualiﬁed engineers are registered.

If all qualiﬁed engineers wore red suits, or if all of them
were registered, or if all of them belonged to a single society,
the public could conﬁdently identify them.

If we had some way of properly testing them to deter-
mine their qualiﬁcations, and if they weren’t so sartorially
selective, the red suit could be used. But, I believe if we
could adequately test them, it would be very easy to hand
each one a registration certiﬁcate. As for all belonging to a
single society, this last one would be possible, if membership
criteria were consistent with qualiﬁcations.

You will ﬁnd that the NSPE is working toward both
goals in its long range planning. Identiﬁcation of qualiﬁed
engineers through registration and membership are inter-
acting problems. NSPE is the only active group speaking
for engineers in matters of state registration, but unfortu-
nately NSPE at this time voices the opinion of just the 12%
of all the qualiﬁed engineers.

To solve this dilemma, NSPE at its Constitutional Con-
vention, July 5-6, 1966, in Minneapolis, has recommended
expanding its membership to include non-registered engi-
neers. Sometime in January, 1967, the membership at large
will vote on this important change to their constitution. It
is my personal opinion that an expanded membership will

be a healthy change for NSPE.

There has been much criticism of our outmoded State
Registration Laws. It is obvious that in the last thirty years

-so many changes have taken place in the engineering ﬁelds,

that the classical division of specialties, and the method of
testing for competency is quite outdated. Each State Society
has been working toward a goal of modern registration laws.
Last year a modiﬁed registration act was introduced to our
legislature. Since the new act did not suit the needs of the
engineer, we feel we were effective in defeating it. We expect
a new form to be presented in the 1967 legislative session and
you can be assured that the Pennsylvania Society will be
active in seeing that this form will suit the engineer.

In conclusion, I feel that NSPE is the only group work-
ing to remove the last barrier to complete professional recog-
nition. NSPE provides a means for public identiﬁcation of
all the members of that profession. Certainly it is up to each
engineer to act ethically and be worthy of the public trust.
But, you can also aid in protecting the public by a joint
effort in identifying all qualiﬁed engineers by supporting an
organization such as NSPE.

I believe I can paraphrase William A. White again and
say, “Yes, Virginia, there is an engineering profession.”
Perhaps little Virginia will change her rhyme as she’s
skipping rope to:

"Rich man, Poor man, Proﬁteer
Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer."

Edward B. S.'|'uar1'. Professor of Chemical Engineering

NASA 1966
SPACE REPORT

A      Completion of the 12-mission Gemini project, a soft land-

ing on the Moon, and startling new photographs of the
Earth and the lunar surface highlighted the United States
# A space program during 1966.

When astronauts James A. Lovell, ]r., and Edwin E.
Aldrin, ]r., splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean Novem-
ber 15 in their’ Gemini 12 spacecraft, a major milestone had
,<_ 12.3, been passed toward achieving the national goal of landing
men on the Moon by 1970.

They and the crews of the preceding six Mercury and
nine Gemini manned flights had proved that men could
withstand the rigors of space, maneuver their craft, rendez-
vous in orbit and carry out activity in the hostile environment.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
1966 unmanned satellite program just as importantly con-

7
92.8’ tinued its contribution to the ultimate lunar landing by

s_wB gathering information necessary to the success of the
manned program.

Surveyor I was vital to NASA because many of its ele-
ments of design and concept are similar to those on the
Lunar Module designed to place U. S. astronauts on the
Moon.

Launched from Cape Kennedy May 30, the Surveyor
dropped gently to the Moon’s Ocean of Storms two and
one-half days later. Its contribution was more than 11,000
photographs of the lunar surface.

THE LUNAR EXPLORATION PROGRAM

Later, two Lunar Orbiter spacecraft were launched to
photograph possible landing sites for the astronauts. Lunar
Orbiter I transmitted the first picture of the Earth made
from the area of the Moon. Lunar Orbiter II, launched
November 6, made on November 23 the ﬁrst close-up (28
miles) pictures of the Crater of Copernicus, one of the most
prominent features on the Moon’s face.

This photograph gave many persons the first lunar pic-
ture they could readily relate to Earth topography.

It clearly showed mountains rising 1,000 feet from the
crater floor with slopes up to 30 degrees. This photo and
others taken by the Orbiter’s telephoto lens will be used in
analyzing potential landing areas before astronauts attempt
their first flight to the Moon.

Also in preparation for the manned Apollo mission -
the ﬁrst is scheduled early in 1967 — the launch vehicle
development program saw three successful firings of the
Uprated Saturn I, predecessor of the mighty Saturn V
which will be used for the lunar landing ﬂight.

Other scientiﬁc, weather and communications satellites
launched in 1966 included the second Nimbus meteorolog-
ical craft, Nimbus II, which was placed in polar orbit, as
well as three Environmental Science Services Administration
(ESSA) satellites. The ESSA launches inaugurated the
operational meteorological satellite system established by the
U. S. Department of Commerce.

An Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (OGO) joined two
others already in orbit to study the relationship between
the Sun and the nature of the Earth’s environment. The
Passive Geodetic Survey Satellite (Pageos I) offered better
geodetic data on the entire Earth than could have been
gained by traditional means.

‘MEASUREMENTS SHOWN IN INCHES

 

Explorers XXXII and XXXIII returned information
about the Earth’s environment with XXXIII looking at
areas in space far beyond the Moon. In addition, Pioneer
VII joined Pioneer VI in orbit around the Sun to continue
a program of measurements at widely separated points in
interplanetary space over the solar cycle.

The Centaur hydrogen-powered launch vehicle was test-
ﬁred twice successfully and launched two Surveyor space-
craft. The vehicle was established as fully operational and
capable of placing large payloads on the Moon and ready
for interplanetary roles in the future.

NASA continued its studies in flight safety and the
rocket-powered X-I5 research aircraft was flown at a new
speed record of 4,223 miles per hour.

An all-solid propellant rocket motor producing 35 mil-
lion pounds of thrust was ground-tested successfully. Mean-
time, a 260-inch-diameter motor with 5 million pounds of
thrust was scheduled for the test stand in 1967.

Flown successfully was the M-2 lifting body, a two-and-
one—half-ton manned vehicle under study to help NASA
establish a technological base for the design of future
spacecraft.

International cooperative space activities carried out

during the year included sounding rocket experiments with
Argentina, the Federal Republic of Germany, Brazil,
Canada, India, Norway, Pakistan and Spain.

In particular, the U. S. cooperated in the launching of
sounding rockets during solar eclipses in May and Novem-
ber with Greece, Brazil and Argentina. An agreement with
France was reached for a joint project to collect meteorolog-
ical data with balloons and satellites.

During 1966, the space agency increased its tracking
facilities around the world in support of manned and un-
manned satellites. It also expanded its Technology Utiliza-.
tion Program: the dissemination of information about
speciﬁc inventions, innovations and discoveries growing out

scientiﬁc investigation of Earth and space phenomena.

In addition to the ESSA satellites launched for the De-
partment of Commerce, NASA also launched Intelsat 2 for
the Communications Satellite Corp. The satellite, in sta-
tionary orbit over the Paciﬁc Ocean, can handle television
data transmissions or voice channels and part of its capacity

will be purchased by NASA for Apollo support.

Notes
From
The

Dean

By Harold E. Hoelscher

20

- — — Since this is the first issue of 1967, I take the oppor-
tunity to wish all of you a happy, prosperous and successful
New Year. We accomplished much in the development of
our faculty, our programs and our facilities during 1966.
We have started many things which will continue to occupy
the time and energy of all of us during this new year and
we have begun to lay plans for the long range development
of the School. I hope you share with me a sense of accom-

plishment for the year 1966 and a sense of excitement for the

year 1967.

— - - Among the most important of our activities is the
search for new faculty and we continue to enjoy consider-
able success in this. Thus, I am pleased to announce that the
following will be new colleagues for present faculty and

new teachers for students in the immediate future:

- — - Of great importance to all of us is the progress on
the new building. Associate Dean Walter R. Turkes, con-
tinues to serve as our liaison with the University Buildings
and Grounds, the Architects and the Construction Company.

He reports as follows:

The Geo'rge A. Fuller Company, the general con-
tractor for the construction on The Michael L. Benedum
Hall of Engineering, encountered unexpected difficulties
in excavation and foundation work. The Firm of A. C.
Ackenheil & Associates, Inc., was engaged as consultants
to assist in evaluating and solving the problem. The
foundation has been redesigned, and the tower building
of the engineering complex will be supported on 138
caissons. Approximately 20 percent of these have been
drilled and poured with_reinforced concrete. Construc-
tion is now behind schedule but it is anticipated that by
effectively using the “PERT" system of scheduling the
construction can be rescheduled and delays controlled to

complete the building as scheduled — Ianuary, 1969.

- - - Profeccor E. A. DeLeo has been appointed Director
of the Engineering Records and Services Office, effective Janu-
ary 1, 1967. Professor DeLeo replaces Professor Harry Wol-
farth who has carried this responsibility for the past ﬁve
years. He now returns to full time teaching and research
as Associate Professor and Associate Chairman in the De-
partment of Industrial Engineering. With Professor DeLeo's
appointment as Director of this office, the traditional informa-
tion storage and retrieval responsibilities of the Engineering
Records Office will be expanded to include the responsibility
for service functions throughout the School of Engineering.
Reproduction of manuscripts and reports, the preparation of
cost analyses relative to the Engineering programs, and
similar functions will become the responsibility of this office.
In addition, the information storage and retrieval functions
will be automated and the service expanded to include stu-
dents, faculty and Engineering alumni. The office will not,
as in the past, counsel students relative to courses and pro-
grams but will retain the advising functions relative to admis-
sion, readmission, transfer, registration and other routine

administrative details.

Contact with the ERSO maybe made by calling Profes-
sor DeLeo on Extension 6132 or 6142.

- - - There are a number of new programs throughout the
School which are of interest and about which you will be
hearing more in the future. In the Department of Chemical
and Petroleum Engineering, :1 program sponsored by the
Gulf Oil Company is in progress for a group of Kuwait
citizens. Professor Stuart, Chairman of that Department,
says of that program:

Beginning with the Winter term fourteen Kuwaiti
Students will be taking special courses in the Chemical
and Petroleum Engineering Department. This program
is being offered by the Engineering School for the Gulf
Eastern Oil Corporation to train Kuwaiti students in the
principles of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering. The
objective of this program is to prepare these men for
positions as technicians in the petroleum industry of
their own country.

The fourteen students are all graduates of secondary
schools in Kuwait. Their ages range from, eighteen to
twenty-ﬁve. Their program at Pitt includes four courses
for the Winter term — Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics
and Material and Energy Balances. During the Spring
term, they will be taking courses in Petroleum Produc-
tion, and Economics, Separation Processes, Process Con-
trol, and laboratory work in both Chemical and Petro-
leum Engineering.

This is an unusual venture for us, even somewhat out-of-
the-ordinary for a University. However, I strongly believe
that our responsibility to the engineering profession includes
the development of and the guidance of such sub-profes-
sional educational programs and I am pleased that we are
involved in this experiment.

- - - The Department of Civil Engineering is active in a
new program with the Graduate School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs. This program is concerned with the field
of public works and is in part sponsored by the American
Public Works Association. Engineers with a Bachelor’s de-
gree in Civil Engineering may enroll in the program for a
Master’s degree in Public Works or, if they elect, for a
program which will lead to a simultaneous Master’s degree
in Civil Engineering and to the Master’s in Public Works.
The problems of our cities and the ﬁeld of urban renewal
has received much well-deserved attention in the recent press
and I am pleased that our Civil Engineering faculty is

entering this important problem area.

— — - With the apopintment of Dr. Britvec, our Mechanical
Engineering Department will begin a program to study the
problems of vibration in and the instability of shells. The
program will include the dynamic and static testing of non-
linear, imperfection sensitive structures that may be stable
or unstable and will require establishment of a new labora-
tory facility. The ﬁeld of non-linear mechanics is one of far

reaching consequences in engineering today.

22

- - - December, 1966, marked the death of Professor John
F. Calvert, who was, for many years, Professor and Chair-
man of our Electrical Engineering Department. Professor
Calvert was an outstanding Electrical Engineer, a noted
educator and a consultant to industry and government. He
came to Pitt from Northwestern University August 1, 1954
and since then played a major role in the development of
his field of specialization, his department and our School.
His passing leaves a void in our ranks and all of us mourn

his loss.

JOHN F. CALVERT

Members of the Electrical Engineering Department have
recommended that we establish the John F. Calvert Hybrid

Computation Center in our new engineering building as a
permanent memorial to his name. Dr. Calvert had been
closely associated with analog computation theory and
practice for many years and three of our Electrical Engineer-
ing faculty were first introduced to this important subject by
Dr. Calvert when they were graduate students studying
under his direction. Thus, this will be done. Dr. Ronald G.
Schultz (Electrical Engineering) has accepted the responsi-
bility for this memorial and will be glad to hear from former
students, friends or colleagues of Dr. Calvert who would like

to make a contribution to the fund.

- - - A new building, new faculty, new programs, change,
change, change! Things continue to happen in Engineering

at Pitt. I will keep you informed.

CAREERS WITH BECHTEL

J. GEORGE THON, Manager of Engineering, Hydro and ’Il'ansportation Division

CIVIL, MECHANICAL AND
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING

One of a series of interviews in which
Bechtel Corporation executives discuss
career opportunities for college men.

QUESTION: Mr. Than, the graduate con-
sidering a position with the H ydro and
Transportation Division of Bechtel is
interested primarily in two things:_ na-
ture of the overall work the Division
does, and what his starting assignment
would be.

THON: In the Hydro and Transporta-
tion Division, as our name implies, we
cover two ﬁelds of engineering and en-
deavor—each one challenging to the
engineer but with a different emphasis.
Brieﬂy, in Hydro work we design and
manage construction of dams, hydro-
electric powerhouses, tunnels, and wa-
ter collection systems. In this work we
integrate efforts of Electrical, Mechan-
ical, and Civil Engineers in the design
of a complete project. In'll'ansportation
work we study, design, and manage
construction of rapid transit systems in
metropolitan cities. A graduate would
start either as an assistant engineer in
a speciﬁc project group or as a member
of one of the Hydrology, Hydraulics, or
Soils supporting groups. In an electri-
cal group he might start working on
one of the radically new systems of
electriﬁcation or automatic train con-
trol presently under development. Sim-
ilarly, in a mechanical group he might
work on the evaluation of hydraulic
turbine efficiencies or a ventilation sys-

tem for an underground station. As you
can see, a wide range of disciplines is
covered.

QUESTION: Would he_have any choice
as to preliminary assignment?

THON: Yes. Both college training and
personal preferences are considered in
making an assignment.

QUESTION: Since Bechtel not only en-
gineers a project but usually manages
construction as well, I assume there
must be close liaison between engineer-
ing and construction forces.

THON: That is right. It is of paramount
importance at all times. We emphasize
the need for this close relationship in
the work of the young engineer. He is
shown why he must learn both design
and construction before he produces a
design that not only is theoretically
sound but also economical. He is given
frequent opportunities to visit project
sites. Transfers to construction are also
made available.

QUESTION: How long does this training
period last?

THON: There is no pat answer to that
question, since so much depends on in-
dividual ability and intensity of appli-
cation. If I were to generalize, I’d say
three to four years.

QUESTION: Can the young engineer
supplement the company's training.
program in any way?

THON: Yes. We recognize the value of
university extension courses in special-
ized ﬁelds. He is encouraged to enroll in
such courses to broaden his knowledge,
and we have a policy of reimbursing
him for tuition fees and incidentals.

QUESTION: To what does he “graduate”
at the end of his training period?

THON: He would be put in charge of one
of the phases of a project. For example,
he might take over a group designing
one of the many types of dams, from a
double curvature, thin arch dam to an
earth or rock ﬁll dam.'He might be re-
sponsible for a group analyzing water
hammer problems in pipelines or pen-
stocks, or be running an economic study
for a regional water collection system.
In the Transportation Group he might
head up a design team for a Rapid
Transit station in the center of a large
city, coordinating his work with archi-
tects and local officials. As a mechanical
or electrical engineer, he might be in
charge of design of a pumping station
or the preparation of a hydroelectric
generator speciﬁcation. I think you will
see from the few aspects that I have
mentioned that there is no lack of vari-
ety in our work. We like to think we
are a young man’s company.

The_Hydro and Transportation Division is one
of eight major divisions of Bechtel Corporation.
Additional opportunities are available in the
Power and Industrial, Mining and Metals, Re-
ﬁnery and Chemical, Pipeline, and the two Inter!-
national Divisions.

The engineer seeking professional challenge and
opportunity and wishing to work on projects of
national and international economic effect, will
ﬁnd interesting beginning assignments and career
opportunities in the dynamic areas of Bechtel
Corporation's activities.

Bechtel Corporation (and its foreign subsidiaries)
designs, engineers, and constructs in addition to
water supply, hydroelectric proiects, and urban
rapid transit systems: conventional steam and
nuclear power plants, mining and metallurgical
processing projects, industrial plants, food proc-
essing plants, missile and space development pro-
grams. petroleum reﬁneries, petrochemical and
chemical plants pipeline systems, community
and regional pi nning, and developmental re-
search in all these areas.

Engineers are employed from many branches of
the engineering profession including chemical,
mechanical, electrical. civil (structural and hy-
dro), mining and metallurgical, architectural, nu-
clear. instrumentation and automatic control. Po-
sitions are also available for graduate engineers
with Masters’ Degrees in Business Adminitration.

Write for new brochures showing the wide variety
of projects Bechtel builds throughout the world.

Drawing shows projected descent of the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) for the Apollo
Mission to the Moon. LEM will descend from the CSM (Command and Service Module)
to the lunar surface, land, and return to the CSM. Two central components of the LEM
system which control the descent to, and ascent from, the moon are the Attitude and
Translation Control Assembly and the Descent Engine Control Assembly. RCA has
designed and produced these systems in addition to other critical electronics systems,
necessary to the success of the mission.

RCA KIIOWS HOW in Aerospace and Defense

The LEM programs are only a small sample of the
many advanced and diverse activities underway in the
ﬁve RCA divisions of Defense Electronic Products.

VVitl1 RCA you could be working on these programs
so vital to national defense and space exploration.

EE, ME and IE opportunities exist for all degree
levels in every phase of research, design and develop-
ment, information systems, manufacturing, and com-
puter marketing.

VVith RCA everyone has the opportunity to join
graduate education programs, training programs, and
in—house courses—all designed to further individual
development.

You owe it to yourself to find out more about the
great range of activities at RCA. Aerospace and de-
fense are only one phase of our continuous drive to
pioneer new areas of electronics. See your college

Is there hope for 26
of the world’s

most misunderstood
characters?

Although graphic communications of
all kinds is our business, making ideas
matter is our main concern. Since this
encompasses every alphabet, numeri-
cal system and other graphic means
known to man, the possibilities are
endless.

For example, LDX (Long Distance
Xerography) has already begun to
demonstrate its immense potential as
a graphic way to put any idea across
continents or oceans . . . in seconds
and with great fidelity.

We think it likely that LDX will do for
facsimile transmission and reproduc-
tion what our 914 copier did for office
copying. Revolutionize it.

And, we expect that, as with the
914, the revolution will come quietly.
Suddenly a world of people will have
ready access to documents that can
help bridge the communications gap.
To press this revolution forward we
are concentrating on exciting corol-
lary concepts like 3-dimensional
imaging, color xerography and the
global transmission of images through
computer systems.

But even as we extend ourselves to
explore and develop the potentialities
of LDX-type systems—such as may
print the morning paper at your break-
fast table some day—we're simultane-
ously giving a lot of thought to a range
of related possibilities. Not least is the
creation of potent, low cost educa-
tional concepts and techniques.

Your degree in Engineering, Sci-
ence, Statistics or Mathematics can
qualify you for some intriguing open-
ings at Xerox, in fundamental and
applied research, engineering, manu-
facturing, programming and market-
ing/sales.

ford, Xerox Corporation, P.O. Box

What’s

Researcher peers through lightweight Fibergl-as honey-
comb before placing it on primary heat shield of Apollo
space craft. The honeycomb is packed with Fiberglas rein-
forced phenolic resin to protect the heat shield from the
20,000 F temperatures encountered when the space craft re=
enters the earth’s atmosphere.

During re-entry, successive layers of the Fiberglas-phenolic‘
compound char and melt or flake off to dissipate the friction-
generated heat.

New In

 

When a number lights up on devices like these, it tells :1

moon-bound Apollo astronaut whether or not his cabin con-
tains a safe combination of oxygen and carbon dioxide. A
liquid silicone rubber compound helps assure reliability of
the vital two-inch long device, called a “Digistrip." Neither
escaped liquids not severe shocks can affect the accuracy of
the “Digistrip’s” performance readings since it is completely
waterproofed and shockproofed by the silicone rubber

(General Electric’s RTV-60).

A new family of lasers that have both the extremely high
output power of a giant pulse ruby laser and the very small
beam divergence of a gas laser has been reported by scientists
at IBM. A wide range of new giant pulse frequencies can
be generated by the devices.

The laser system uses an organic photosensitizing dye in
solution as the active medium. The dye is pumped by a
giant—pulse ruby laser. Because the dye solution is of much
higher optical quality than the crystal in a ruby laser, the
output of the dye laser has the extremely high spatial
coherence previously available only in gas lasers.

The small beam divergence of the new laser is of
potential interest for a variety of giant pulse laser applica-
tions, such as long—range laser radars and range ﬁnders.

The ﬁrst dye tried in the IBM experiment was 3,3’-
diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DTTC) which lases at a
wavelength of 8160 Angstroms in ethyl alcohol solution.
There are hundreds of other photosensitizing dyes of very
similar molecular structure, many of which can be expected
to function as lasers. This family of dyes should make
available giant pulse laser beams of any wavelength between
about 7,000 and 15,000 Angstroms.

The dyes are of scientiﬁc interest as the ﬁrst large group
of materials in which lasing occurs as a result of electronic
transitions in an organic molecule. The only previous true
organic laser was the dye chloro-aluminum phthalocyanine.
Other “organic” lasers involve electronic transitions of
chelated rare earth ions in solution.

The efficiency of the DTTC laser is high: its output was
about 14 percent of the pumping power in early experiments,
and has later been measured as high as 50 percent. The dye
solution has shown no evidence of saturation at pumping
levels of several hundred megawatts, indicating it is capable
of very high output power.

Scientists at IBM have shrunk the size of computer
memory cores —— tiny doughnuts of magnetic material — to
an almost invisible size by using the ancient art of the
candlemaker.

Reducing the size of the memory cores permits more of
them to be packed together, increasing the capacity of the
computer memory. Over the year the size of the units have
shrunk to where today millions can be assembled in a single
computer.

However, as the size shrinks, it becomes increasingly
difficult to form the magnetic doughnuts in a pressing opera-
tion, the commonly used technique for forming the memory
cores. The new experimental cores, just a little larger than a
human hair, would be virtually impossible to form in a
pressing operation.

It was found that they could be formed easily by using
the ancient art of the candlemaker. In fact, the relative size
of the hole in the core could be expanded. The fabrication
process starts with the hole — a “wick” of nylon. In a con-
tinuous operation, a long ﬁlament of nylon is passed through
a bath of varnish and magnetic powder. The magnetic
“taper” then passes through a drying oven and is recycled
until the desired thickness is built up. In a similar opera-
tion, a covering of non—magnetic material is added for
strength.

The magnetic taper is then cut into sections which are
frozen in a block of wax. At this point the nylon ﬁlaments
are withdrawn, leaving hollow tubes of magnetic ferrite
material. The wax block is then sliced on a precision milling
machine. In a single slice, hundreds or thousands of cores
can be cut from the tapers. The slices are then ﬁred in an
oven, vaporizing the wax and sintering the magnetic
material.

in mining and metallurgy here and abroad, at Anaconda American Brass Co.,

Anaconda Wire & Cable Co., and Anaconda Aluminum Co.

    

Extractive metallurgy is a
key to more metal

The metallurgical bubble bath above is
a ﬂotation cell in a new Anaconda con-
centrator. Although it may seem crude
and simple to a layman, the process in-
volvcs complex combinations of colloi-
dal and surface chemistry, crystallog-
raphy, physics, and special grinding
methods adapted to the ores at each
individual mine. It represents one way
Anaconda’s metallurgical research is
helping make more metal available for
our growing economy.

At Butte, Mont., such research, in rais-
ing recovery of metal from low-grade
ores, is making today’s submarginal
material part of tomorrow's ore re-
serves.

As Anaconda’s intensiﬁed geological
research and exploration turns up new
prospective mineral deposits, the need
for metallurgical research and devel-
opment grows. Each deposit must be
analyzed to determine the feasibility of
recovering its metal. And as research
develops more eﬁicient extraction proc-
esses, lower grade and more complex
deposits can become mines.

To accomplish this, Anaconda is estab-
lishing a central extractive metallurgi-
cal research center at Tucson, Arizona.
It is carefully planned and is being su-
perbly equipped. It is near a large uni-
versity staff, which can be consulted as
needs arise, thus offering a stimulating
environment for progressive research
and development. In turn, this means
attractive new openings for a variety of
engineering talents—not only in metal-
lurgy. but also in chemistry, physics,
and mechanical engineering.

Dynamic test yields new data
on copper-metal springs

Copper metals are among the most
useful spring materials known to man.
The role of modulus of elasticity in this
application was studied at the Research
and Technical Center of Anaconda
American Brass for more precise data
and to make possible predicting spring
performance at various ambient tem-
peratures.

Modulus of elasticity can be deter-
mined by physical testing in tension or
compression. But Anaconda found the
dynamic method (below) easier to per-
form and just as accurate.

Results are of prime importance to de-
signers of spring devices. The signiﬁ-
cantly lower modulus of elasticity for
copper metals means that at the same
level of stress, copper alloy components
will deﬂect or extend almost twice as
far as components made of steel-—usu-
ally with no sacriﬁce of maximum
stress. This can mean more sensitive
controls—or “softer” action in the ab-
sorption of energy.

This is but one way Anaconda is reﬁn-
ing and broadening knowledge of the
many useful properties of copper met-

The talents and skills of techni-
cally qualiﬁed men and women
will always be needed by
Anaconda in important positions
in exploration, mining, extrac-
tive metallurgy, manufacturing,
scientiﬁc research, sales, and ad-
ministration.

Bright future for a
bright metal

How do you make containers to hold
motor oil or citrus concentrates at low-
er costs? How can you package airline
in-ﬂight meals to enable reconstituting
of foods at very high temperatures for
fast serving—and retain quality and ﬂa-
vor? These are typical questions asked
and answered in the Packaging Devel-
opment Laboratory of Anaconda Alu-
minum.

A growing factor in the aluminum in-
dustry, Anaconda Aluminum is partic-
ularly strong in packaging-with plain
foil, laminated foil and rigid foil con-
tainer products. And it has developed
several ﬁrsts in the aluminum industry.
One is the patented foil-ﬁbre container
for motor oil and for citrus concen-
trates. Another is foil containers (see
above) for better airline service in the
jet age. Now frozen and refrigerated
meals can be heated rapidly and served
quickly. Anaconda Aluminum has an
outstanding record of developments
which have had a tremendous impact
on the packaging industry.
Anaconda Aluminum is also a produc-
er of primary aluminum. To meet the
growing demand for the metal in pack-
aging, transportation, electrical, and
building products, Anaconda Alumi-
num has been steadily increasing its
output—is currently expanding its pri-
mary ingot capacity by two-thirds. This
expansion involves an investment of
$50,000,000.

Anaconda Alumium is growing, and
will become an increasingly important
factor in the bright future of the bright
metal. For this it needs people—not
only for its packaging laboratory and
foil operations, but also for its other
fabricating plants and reduction opera-
tions. This means growing opportuni-
ties for metallurgists, chemical engi-
neers, industrial engineers, plant engi-
neers, and system engineers. 66125

Instrument Calculates Moments of Inertia of Complex Plane Figures

 

The problem: To provide an instrument that will calculate
distributive—area properties, such as centroids and moments
of inertia, of complex or irregular plane ﬁgures representing
cross sections of structural members. For ﬁgures of this type,
the required properties cannot be obtained from tables or
calculated analytically, as in the case of simple geometrical
ﬁgures. Manual methods, wihch yield approximations of
the true area properties, are laborious and time consuming.

The solution: A calculator consisting of a narrow ﬁeld scan-
ner coupled with a relatively simple preprogrammed
computer.

How i‘|"s done: The calculator uses a servoed X—Y plotter,
with a linear sweep voltage applied to one input axis and a
linear step voltage to the other input axis, to scan the area
in small incremental steps. The output data from the scan-
ner are fed to an analog computer, which performs a series
of discrete summations, closely approximating the exact
integration, to yield the value of the desired property (e.g.,
centroid or moment of inertia).

The area whose properties are to be computed is cut
from a sheet of bond paper and the remaining outline is
cemented as a mask on an electrical conductive base. The

J Bond Paper Mask

—— Cutout Conductive Area

N Area Increment (XAY)

Conductive Base Area

exposed conductive area is then used for incremental
scanning. A linear sweep voltage causes the probe of the
X—Y plotter to scan across the conductive area in the X
direction, and a linear step voltage applied at the end of
each sweep causes the probe to step a constant small incre-
ment (AY) in the Y direction. In this manner, each incre-
mental area (XAY) is swept out over the entire conductive
area. The stepping voltage at any given time corresponds
to the distance from a selected arbitrary reference axis
(which serves as a base for calculation of the desired prop-
erty, e.g., centroid or moment of inertia) to the incremental
area being swept out. As the probe makes one sweep across
the surface, a sweep voltage pulse will be generated as long
as the probe is in contact with the conductive surface. Since
the probe sweeps at constant speed, the time of the sweep
voltage pulse is proportional to each incremental area. The
outputs from the plotter and the conductive surface are fed
to a preprogrammed analog computer which uses an inte-
grator to compute the desired distributed—area property
represented by the conductive area. To determine the area
property with respect to an orthogonal reference axis, the
step and sweep voltage input axes of the plotter are
interchanged.

The problem: To determine the flow rates of various liquid
metals at elevated temperatures. Previous flowmeters have
suffered because the physical dimensions of flow passage have
been dictated by a rather narrow range of expected flow
rates.

The solufion: A flowmeter in which flow rate is determined
by measuring the position and thus the displacement of an
internal float acted upon by the flowing fluid. Viscous forces
cause the float to move from its mounted position, affording
several means for measuring this motion and thus the flow
rate.

HOW “"5 d0|162 The device lends itself to three types of flow
rate measurement: electromechanical, pressure drop, and
viscous drag. Construction consists of a tube that is rigidly
mounted in a passage through which a fluid is flowing.
Fastened to the inside of the tube is a helical ribbon formed
from an elongated strip that has been twisted about its
longitudinal axis to give it spring-like qualities. Rigidly
secured to the free end of the helical ribbon is a solid

cylindrical float having an outside diameter slightly smaller
than the inside diameter of the tube, thus forming an annular
space to allow passage of the fluid. Additionally, the float
may include a center bore to allow passage of the fluid. As
the flow rate increases, the viscous force acts to displace the
float and this unwinds the helix. In addition to transverse
movement of the float, a rotational movement results from
the unwinding of the helix. As the float translates and
rotates, several means for detecting this motion, and hence
the flow rate, are available.

A properly designed solenoid coil covering the region in
which the float moves will detect translatory movement of
the float by change in its self—inductance.

Pressure taps may be located upstream and downstream
from the ﬂoat, and rate of flow determined by pressure drop
as indicated by the output of a differential transducer.

The float may be equipped with a magnetic slug that is
speciﬁcally oriented with the float in the “no flow” position.
Flow rates may then be determined using a gaussmeter that
detects the degree of float rotation.

Helmet System Broadcasts Electroencephalograms of Wearer

The Pl’0blem= To develop an improved system for obtain-
ing electroencephalograms (EEG's) of pilots and astronauts
performing tasks under stress. In the past, electrodes were
cemented to the scalp and were uncomfortable, irritated the
scalp, and took as long as an hour to attach. Furthermore,
the wires to the readout equipment restricted the subject’s
motions.

The SO|lI'l'iOn1 An EEG monitoring system consisting of
non—irritating sponge—type electrodes, ampliﬁers, and a bat-
tery—powered wireless transmitter, all mounted in the subject’s
helmet. No preparation of the scalp is required. After a
quick initial ﬁtting, the helmet can be removed and replaced
without further adjustment. There are no external wires.

HOW ""5 Chile! A flight helmet is modiﬁed to contain the
EEG electrodes and the electronic components. The ele-
ments of the system ﬁt conveniently in the helmet and do
not impair its usefulness as a protective device.

The key element in this system is the EEG eletrode,
which consists of a flexible portion that rests against-they scalp
and a rigid portion that ﬁts securely in the helmet and is con:

nected to the ampliﬁer. The flexible portion consists of a 

hollow—core cellulose acetate sponge impregnated with an
electrode paste. The rigid portion consists of the following:
a disk of ﬁtted glass wetted with a saline solution; a disk of
compressed silver powder; a disk of Ag—AgCl; and a solid
silver contact which connects with the ampliﬁer.

Fitted to the subject, the sponge portion containing the
electrode paste contacts the scalp with a light steady pres—
sure. This member can accommodate a certain amount of
relative motion between the scalp and the helmet without
altering the electrical properties of the connection or dis-
torting the signal.

The remaining elements of the system are a pair of
miniature biomedical ampliﬁers, a pair of commercial avail-
able FM subcarrier oscillators, a miniature PM transmitter
operating at 108 MHz, and standard miniature mercury
cells that provide 90 hours of continuous operation.

But why all the fuss?

Because the integrated circuit is the key to untold electronics
marvels, hitherto impractical. Because its small size, weight, and
power consumption lessen the cost of complex systems and
improve performance. Because it's more reliable, to boot.

At AC Electronics the solar system is our workshop. Some of our work is far out. Like building

the guidance/navigation system for Apollo and LM; or working on SABRE, the new Self-Aligning Boost
and Reentry system for missiles; on the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL); on the Titan Ill-C Space
Booster; and on supersonic and subsonic aircraft of the future.

Some of our work is more down to earth. Like the Ship's Self-Contained Navigation System
(SSCNS) we're working on for the Navy; or the fire-control system for the new Main Battle Tank, a

joint U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany program; and advanced digital computer development for other

military, space and commercial applications.

That's why life is never dull at AC Electronics. If there's anything new under the sun, chances
are we're working on it. And just to make sure you're kept up on what's new, there's our Career
Acceleration Program, which includes “in-p|ant" instruction. There is also a Tuition Refund Plan

available for any college-level courses taken to advance your career.

If you're completing your B.S. or M.S. degree in E.E., M.E., Math or Physics, check into the
exciting career opportunities at any of our three locations — Milwaukee, Boston, and Santa Barbara.

See your college placement office, or write: Mr. R. W. Schroeder, Dir. of Scientific & Professional

Employment, AC Electronics Division, Dept. 5753, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201.

Ph.D.s, please note: positions are available in all three AC locations, depending upon concen-

tration of study and area of interest.

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER

“Industry has gone a long way toward satisfying those human
needs which can be reached through money, beneﬁts, and security.
The future points to the job itself through improved job design
as a source of increased performance and satisfaction.”

That’s what we say in a new paper coming out of
Building 56. It relates the job design function of the
industrial engineer to the sciences that study human
behavior. Such a paper would not have come out of a
company where top management is less than sold on
the beneﬁts of leading the ﬁeld in applying the most
advanced concepts in industrial engineering no less
than in chemical, mechanical, or electrical engineer-
ing. We have a balance sheet to prove that our man-
agement knows which way is up.

Industrial engineers can come into Building 5 6
either from college, from graduate school, from mili-

tary service, or from a well-reasoned decision that

their present employment is not what they want for
the long haul.

Once in and with a little time gone by, choice con-
fronts a good industrial engineer. Does he want to

The world’s foremost center
of industrial engineering
could be Building 56. '

There it is. Would you like to work there?

remain an industrial engineer and enjoy a status in his
profession that may be more diﬂicult to attain for in-
dustrial engineers who practice under conditions less
favorable than prevail at Kodak? Or do multiple re-
gression technique and mathematical model building
and behavioral research mean less to him than swing-
ing over to one of Building 56’s intramural clients and
there starting his way up to where the whole mighty,
fascinating, and gloriously diversiﬁed ship is steered?

The fact that parallel choices have to be made by
those who join us as chemical, mechanical, or elec-
trical engineers will not be mentioned here for lack
of space.

We’d be honored to have a note about yourself.

General Electric
engineers and scientists
are helping to satisfy the
needs of society...

Like rapid transportation

Your technical career at General Electric can
cover a wide range of engineering

innovation. Take today's rapid transit problem
for example. Inquisitive minds in research

and design at G.E. have developed circuitry,
radar controls and propulsion systems

that can run and guide a 150 mph transit train.
Manufacturing engineers have

developed methods and machines

to produce these transit systems as efficiently
as possible. And technical marketing
specialists are working with cities and
government, planning their transportation
networks. Good reasons why at General Electric
innovations start and finish with the

technical man.
