SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

FEBRUARY 1983

 

The Crossed Molecular Beam Machine was designed by Dr.
Siska and is the central experimental tool of his research.

These experiments must be performed in a vacuum in
order to prevent scattering of the molecules being studied
by stray molecules in the machine's chamber which would
greatly reduce the usefulness of Dr. Siska’s data. With a dif-
fusion pump capable of evacuating 5200 liters of gas at stan-
dard temperature and pressure per second, he creates a
vacuum of about 1x108 Torrs. Air and water molecules from
the air, however, are absorbed by the stainless steel walls
of the chamber before the chamber’s evacuation. These
molecules are then slowly given off as the vacuum is being
produced, thus increasing the time need to create the desired
vacuum.

One example of such a scattering experiment perform-
ed by Dr. Siska is the collision of metastable Argon and
Nitrogen gas. An Argon beam is shot at the electrons to pro-
duce a beam of metastable Argon atoms. Then a beam of
N2 is shot at right angles to this beam. Experimental accuracy
is limited by being able to align these beams to within 0.02
degrees. The intensity of Ar* and N2* scattered is determin-
ed for a sweep of angular displacements. This is achieved
by manually rotating a detector, which is sensitive to the
molecule of interest, through the sweep.

In producing the excited Argon, Siska can pulse the beam
in order to determine the velocity of the molecules. He uses
this information to determine the energy involved in the col-
lisions of Ar* and‘N2. The pulsing can be produced in two
ways. First, the electron gun can be pulsed, and the signal
obtained at each angle of displacement can be time-resolved.
Second, a mechanical chopper, which actually works like
a tuning fork, can be used on the N2 beam.

After his experiment is completed, the difficult part
begins. Dr. Siska says that the experiment itself is not dif-
ficult to perform; it is determining the meaning of the data

which is difficult. With this information about the velocities
of the molecules before and after collision determined from
pulsing, and by measuring the angular displacements, a
distribution of reagent and product masses, angles, and
energies can be obtained. This gives Dr. Siska information
on the forces governing collisions between Ar* and N2
molecules, intermolecular forces, and the probability of Ar*
transferring energy to N2. The quantum nature of molecules
is illustrated in his data, which show oscillations in angular
distribution of intensity, arising from de Broglie wave
interference.

In the study of molecular collisions, it is important to
have the ability to collect the data at a very high rate of speed.
Dr. Siska presently uses a DEC PDP—8/E computer in recor-
ding the data obtained from his experiments. He also uses
a strip chart recorder in his laboratory to record the data. With
this strip chart recorder the data are saved in a hard copy
form which can be interpreted very quickly for any surpris-
ing results. This collection of data at such a high rate of speed
is only possible through use of the computer. The computer's
major role in Dr. Siska’s lab is to help in the interpretation
of the data. This requires the solving of the Schrodinger equa-
tion for each guess of the intermolecular forces. One force
law problem gives 100 to 1000 Schrodinger equations to

In this humorous representation of the inner workings of
Dr. Siska’s machine, the North Wind produces the Ar*
beam and the East Wind produces the N-_. beam. The elves
are measuring the intensity of molecules received at various
scattering angles while the trumpeter excites the Argon
beam and the executioner mechanically chops the Nitrogen
beam. The black hole represents the vacuum pumps which
remove molecules from the inner chamber to maintain the
vacuum.

 

solve. To solve the Schrodinger equation this many times
by hand would take several years! With the University's
DEC-10 system numerically solving all of these tedious equa-
tions, Dr. Siska has time to interpret the data that his com-
puter collects.

The process on inputting experimental data from the
PDP—8/E is done either by delayed reading of paper tape or
through a teletype—modem system. A future possibility for
inputting the experimental data is that of the digitizer located
in Forbes Quadrangle. To use the digitizer you simply touch
the peaks and valleys of the graph with a sensitive pencil
which records the data into the DEC-10 system. The reason
that the data are not read directly into the DEC-10 system
from the laboratory is that the data need to be read at such
a high speed that the timesharing system would cause data
to be lost. Note that in the timesharing system the attention
of the computer actually switches among all the terminals
at a high rate. The problem with this lies in that the com-
puter would have to give the data toyal concentration in order
not to lose any. The data must be recorded so quickly that
if the computer looks away at all it will miss important in-
formation. This kind of total attention from the DEC-10
system is only obtained through a direct hardwire hook-up.
Such a hook-up is not easily obtained at the University, and
Dr. Siska so far has not attempted to secure such a computer
set-up for his lab.

In Dr. Siska’s timesharing allotment he is given 3000
blocks of memory to store both programs and data. Of the
3000 blocks approximately 1000 are set aside for data which
he is presently interpreting. The other 2000 blocks are assign-
ed to programs that are currently utilized or being developed
for the interpreting of the data. These programs are written
in Fortran, and all have been written by Dr. Siska and his
students. Along with these Fortran programs the DEC—10
system library has many graphing programs that help to repre-
sent the data pictorially.

The past decade has led to many developments in both
electronics and computer technology. These advancements
have led to Dr. Siska’s PDP—8/E becoming outdated rather
quickly. Not only is the computer less efficient than those
made today, but DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) will
no longer service this model or even suggest ways to repair
it when problems arise. The problem of servicing the
PDP—8/D, along with the necessity of transferring all data in-
to the DEC-10 system before any interpretations can be made
by use of Dr. Siska’s programs, have led Dr. Siska to begin
the search for a new laboratory computer. He is presently
interested in purchasing a new laboratory computer, along
with a special driver to translate the different data formats
so that the laboratory computer and DEC—10 systems can
communicate. This will give him the advantage of being able
to do some data interpretations without transferring his data,
while still enabling him to use the many library functions
found in the DEC—10 system.

Another acquisition Dr. Siska would like to make,
hopefully in the next year, is a laser which would cost about
$70,000. He would insert the laser beam into the chamber
of his machine to intersect the metastable beam. If this were
done before collision, the light could be absorbed by one

of the two states of Ar* which exist because of differences
in coupling of electron spins. This would give him state selec-
tion so he could study each state individually instead of tak-
ing an average as he must do now. At the present time five
European laboratories already have this capability.

Another future plan of Dr. Siska’s is to build a second
Crossed Molecular Beam Machine utilizing a new computer,
more modern technology, and a new detector to analyze the
electrons given off during ion formation. He hopes to do this
in about two years. To facilitate the operation of two
machines, Dr. Siska would need to increase his present
number of three graduate students to five.

Besides his graduate students, Dr. Siska presently has an
undergraduate student helping to conduct research. Dr. Siska
feels that such an experience is very beneficial to students.
To become involved in such a project, students should talk
to Dr. Safford of the Chemistry department. They must then
register for Chem 171 which has flexible credits; Dr. Siska
requires about four hours of laboratory work a week for each
credit earned. The background needed is Chem 141 and
either 142 or 148 or current enrollment in 142 or 148.

Professor Siska currently teaches three classes a year;
they are at present 71/76, 72/77 and a graduate course. The
71/76 and 72/77 courses are honors courses that not only
present chemistry applications, but also generate an
understanding of basic chemistry concepts for the students.
Professor Siska feels it is extremely important for an engineer
to understand the concepts he is using to solve a problem
as opposed to simply plugging numbers into an equation.
He strongly recommends the Honors Program as a solid foun-
dation for an engineer's education.

When asked for words of wisdom, Dr. Siska replied, ’’I’m
not old enough to be wise.”

Dr. Siska attends to an array of monitoring instruments as

Science and Society:

An Optimist’s View

by Andrew Szeri

Mechanical Engineering Class of 1984

With the rise of such sentiments as increased popular
concern over nuclear proliferation, or on a smaller and less
profound scale, worry over the devaluation by our society
of such human aspects of our culture as art and literature,
it is easy to become pessimistic about the current technology
explosion’s effects on our cultural heritage. It is certainly true
that our society is adjusting in a basic way to the new
technologies we have created, but one must not forget that
there are positive as well as negative results that arise from
the interplay between science and society.

When one examines the human condition within the
framework of societal order, it becomes obvious that per-
sonal freedom is an important factor in determining the
overall satisfaction of each element of that society: its peo-
ple. To possess personal freedom is to have the opportunity
to live as a human being should live — to be able to utilize
the skills that humans have in the most efficient and least
se|f—damaging way and to be able to make an informed
choice of recreation when the work of staying alive and com-
fortable has been accomplished.

It is through the use or application of science that we
are able to pursue the ideal of personal freedom. Science
promotes the aims of freedom both as a means to an end
and as a means, valuable in itself.

In its most readily apparent manifestation, science pro-
motes an extra quality of life by changing how we go about
insuring our survival as individuals: how we work. Because
of technological innovations (especially in the current infor-
mational rather than industrial revolution) the quality of the
work that we must do to live has greatly increased. Whereas
the steel mills of the early to mid—twentieth century relied
upon a human worker to risk life and limb in order to col-
lect a sample of molten metal for analysis of composition,
temperature, etc., the steel mills of today are equipped with
remote sensing devices capable of accomplishing the task
at no risk to a human being — to say nothing of the savings
in the discomfort the worker suffered due to heat and fumes.
This is just one example of an industry-wide trend to remove
the worker from dangerous or uncomfortable environments
— only possible because technology has supplied us with

the means to replace the worker. Not only is danger being
reduced, but also jobs which are a repetitious drudgery to
perform are being assumed by automated devices. In this
way, science humanizes work by removing those jobs which
were dehumanizing.

But there is a more subtle extension of this process. It
is true that humans are being replaced by machines in some
jobs, but, more importantly, they are moved to a position
where they govern the machines that do the ”dirty work”.
This is a more humane occupation because it utilizes the
single thing that separates man from the animals: his brain.
Instead of using only the comparatively meager physical
strength at man's disposal, technology prods us into a posi-
tion of creativity in and control of the world around us; we
are set free by technology from the lower plane of physical
toil so that we may occupy the higher plane of creativity and
control.

Accompanying this change is another improvement; the
work we must do to survive is less time—consuming.
Therefore, we have more time for recreation, more time
when we are completely free to determine what we do. At
the peak of the first industrial revolution, twelve to fourteen
hour work-days were not uncommon. Now, few work more
than forty hours a week. Moreover, science has greatly added
to the variety of choices of things to do with our recreational
time. Now we can watch television, fly to Europe, telephone
a friend, etc., where before one could only read a book, visit
a neighbor, or write a very slow-to-arrive letter. Thus, science
has augmented the quantity, quality, and, therefore, freedom
of our recreation.

We have seen how science helps us as a means to an
end, but how does it help as a means in itself? As science
develops and becomes used in technology, it causes socie-
ty to re—examine its moral basis in light of the new
developments. This leads to a redefining of the ethics that
govern the dynamics of a society so that they may include
whatever has been brought on by the new developments.
We then have a better system of morals to help us decide
the choices freedom brings us. As an excellent and current-
ly important example, examine the new war technologies
that have been invented, most particularly nuclear and
chemical/biological weaponry. Society is in the process of
examining these terrible weapons in light of the moral basis
that they have inherited. We find little to help us in our deci-
sion because these weapons are of a new and more in-
humane type than previous weapons (which is not to say
that previous weapons were humane). It seems that with the
recent rise of anti-nuclear groups, we are beginning to add
to our ethics a contempt and refusal of such weapons. In-
deed, this anti-weapon sentiment has spread, among some
people, to a strong anti-war sentiment. In this way science
has called into question and changed the moral basis of socie-
ty, promoting the progress of our system of values to a more
humanitarian form.

The impact of science upon our lives is very large and
undeniable, and this is by no means an exhaustive study.
But I hope that in this essay we are all reminded of the good

that science gives us in this age when we hear so much of
the bad.

The Chromium Mechanism

The ﬁrst comprehensive explanation of electrochem ical activity
during the plating of chromium has recently been formulated at
the General Motors Research Laboratories. This understanding
has aided in transforming chromium plating into a highly
eﬁicient, high-speed operation.

FDR MANY industrial applica-

tions, chromium coatings of
more than 0.2 mil thickness are
required for wear and corrosion
resistance. But the conventional
method of plating chromium‘ is

neither fast nor efficient. Nor, un-

til the recent work of a GM
researcher, had the steps involved
in the century-old plating process
been explained in detail. Through
a combination of theory and
experiment, Dr. James Hoare has
devised the ﬁrst comprehensive

mechanism for chromium plating.

This increased understanding has

helped electrochemists at the Gen-

eral Motors Research Laboratories

develop a system that plates chro-

mium sixty times faster than the
conventional method, while
improving energy-efﬁciency by a
factor of three.

The electrolyte for plating is

a chromic acid solution which
contains various chromate ions:
chromate, dichromate and
trichromate. From a series of

steady-state polarization experi-

ments, Dr. Hoare concluded that
trichromate is the ion important in
chromium deposition.

Sulfuric acid has been recog-

nized as essential to chromium
plating and has been assumed by

some to be a catalyst for the proc-
ess. In this strongly acidic solu-

tion, sulfate should be mostly
present as the bisulfate ion (HSO4)'.
Dr. Hoare found, contrary to
expectations, that the addition of
sulfuric acid to the plating bath
decreased the conductivity of the
solution.

Combining these ﬁndings

with the results of previous inves-

tigations, Dr. Hoare concluded that
the electroactive species was a
trichromate-bisulfate complex (see

Figure 1). From equilibrium con-

siderations, he theorized that the
maximum concentration of this

species occurred at a 100-to-1 chro-

mic acid/ sulfuric acid ratio. The
observation that the maximum rate
of chromium deposition also
occurred at this ratio supports the

conclusion that this trichromate-

bisulfate complex is the electroac-
tive species.

During the plating process,
the complex diffuses from the bulk
solution toward the cathode (see
Figure 2). Electron transport takes

place by quantum mechanical tun-

neling through the potential
energy barrier of the Helmholtz
double layer and the unprotected
chromium in the complex (Cr atom

on the left in Figure 1) loses elec-
tons by successive steps, going
from Cr” to Cr”. Decomposition
of the resulting chromous dichro-
mate complex takes place by acid
hydrolysis to form a chromous—
oxybisulfate complex:

||
+Cr—O<—>H<—+O—.|9'—O_

O

The positive end of this com-
plex is adsorbed onto the cathode
surface. Electrons are transferred
from the cathode to the adsorbed
chromium ion, forming metallic
chromium and regenerating the
(HSO4)‘ ion. Thus, Dr. Hoare’s
mechanism explains how sulfuric
acid, in the form of the bisulfate
ion, participates in the plating
process.

IT HAS long been known that
chromium cannot be plated
from a solution when initially pres-
ent as Cr+" because of the forma-
tion of the stable aquo complex,
[Cr(H2O)6] +“. Yet chromium can be
plated when initially present as
Crf“ even though it must pass
through the Cr +3 state before being
deposited. Dr. Hoare’s mechanism
handles this paradox by explaining
that the chromium ion being
deposited (on the left in Figure 1) is
protected by the rest of the complex
as it passes through the Cr” state,
so that the stable aquo complex
cannot form.

The diffusion of the elec-
troactive complex apparently con-
trols the rate of the process, so that

shortening the diffusion path
increases the speed of chromium
deposition. A high rate of relative
motion between the electrolyte and

the cathode will shorten the path.

This can be accomplished by rapid

flow or by agitation of the elec-

trolyte.
Dr. Hoare found that the rate
of chromium deposition increased

with electrolyte ﬂow until the proc-
ess was no longer diffusion-con-

trolled. He also found that the use
of dilute electrolyte significantly
increased plating efficiency.

"This project is an excellent
example,” says Dr. Hoare, "of how
basic research and engineering
principles can be combined to

develop a new, successful process.
Now, we’d like to take on the chal-

lenge of plating successfully from
Cr +3, which would be an even more
efficient way to provide corrosion
and wear resistance.”

research that helped make elec-
trochemical machining a precision
process.

    

Thoughts and impressions of

Deutchland

It was quite an extraordinary turn of events that allow-
ed me to visit West Germany this past August, 7982. To avoid
boring anyone unnecessarily, I shan’t go into them. In short,
I was on a ten—day crash tour, visiting my brother who is
a lawyer in the U.5. Army. Robert is presently living in a
little Bavarian town near the Czech border called
Eschenbach.

Imagine stepping off of a very crowded charter after a
nice eight hour flight; on the way to the terminal, two things
immediately present themselves to tell you that you're not
in the U.S. The first is quite obvious: two nicely dressed
guards holding automatic weapons. The second is that the
airport junk stalls actually have some interesting items for
sale. (Needless to say, for a rather exorbitant price). Customs
is simple; a rather bored looking fellow watches everyone
walk past his window, while they flash horrid pictures at him
in the shape of U.S. passports.

If you've ever been to an airport, Frankfurt Airport
wouldn't look much different. It is very clean, occasionally
crowded with the exchange windows right in front of where
the foreign flights are let out. (They have, of course, very bad
exchange rates.) There are only two places where I have seen
a higher concentration of army uniforms than on that day
in Frankfurt: my brother's ROTC pictures and Sonny's Surplus
stores. It seemed that about half of my flight was being met
by some serviceman or another.

With all of the English that was being thrown around,
I would have almost thought myself still in the States, ex-
cept I noticed that all of the arcade games had ”1DM” writ-

12

ten on them. (At the best military exchange rates, one Deutch
Mark was about 45¢.) It seems that the Germans have come
up with a very effective way of preventing their kids from
going arcade-crazy: money. I instantly recognized all of the
games, except that the rules were written in German. If I
hadn't been suffering from jet-lag, I probably would have
played one or two. As it was, I never got the chance. It was
no great loss, at least for me.

Eventually I found my brother (evidently there had been
some construction work on the autobahn that had delayed
him). We hauled my baggage through the underground park-
ing lot until we located a squat, slightly rusted, beat up blue
car carrying green military plates, and a round white sticker
bearing the letters ”USA” on it. Through the grime I also
found the words ”Normandy Ford” and ”Pinto.” I couldn't
help but smile as I took in the rest of the scene. I saw all
of my automotive dreams parked around me: Mercedes,
BMW, Fiat, Volkswagon and Porche, just to name a few.
Most of the them bore a ”D” on a sticker much like the
”USA” on my brother's Pinto. He then explained how the
autos carry those stickers to identify the nationality of the
car’s.|icense plate. I imagined seeing cars bearing letters other
than the ”D” for Deutchland, and since I had yet to ex-
perience the rigors of travel, I also imagined going to those
places. ”|” for Italy, ”GB” for Great Britian, ”F” for France,
”H” for Hungary, and ”A” for Austria, are just to name
several of the stickers that I eventually saw.

Both here and on the roads throughout my trip I notic-
ed how most of the cars (excluding the one I was in, unfor-
tunately) showed almost no signs of disrepair. Evidently the
Germans maintain automotive standards even more exac-
ting than those here in Pennsylvania.

Riding through Frankfurt am Main during rush hour is
quite an experience. (There is also a Frankfurt in East Ger-
many, so they are differentiated by stating the river that runs
through the city, in this case, the Main river.) It was interesting
watching the lights turn from green to yellow to red, and then
back again. It reminded me of the commercials one sees for
race courses, where the drivers gun their motors on the
yellow light, in anticipation of it turning to green. it seems
that the Germans like driving like that. I can't imagine anyone
surviving the roads in Europe as a timid driver.

The autobahns were equally interesting. They were very
smooth, but constructed much like our second—rate highways:
There was generally two lanes going in each direction,
separated by a grass median a bit wider than the average ones
here. Until you near a city, they generally traverse the less
populated areas. There are certainly many more picturesque
roads, but for first exposures, the scenes along the autobahns
were more than enough to convince me that Germany is truly
a gorgeous country.

In Bavaria, as throughout most of Southern Germany,
the low, rolling hills are criss-crossed with fields all in various
stages of cultivation. There are occasional wine vineyards,
cornfields, wheatfields, etc., along with the ever-present
hops. The start of almost any excellent beer is in those fields.
(Excuse me, authors are sometimes allowed to be baised.)

Separating many fields, and often lining the roadway
were the German forests. They are quite different from most
U.S. forests, in that most of them are well—kept, with tall, lean
trees. They were dark and ominous at times. immediately
one can understand where witches, hags, and the other
nasties of our Germanic folk tradition originated.

13

Twilight silhouettes the Franciscan Church in Saltzburg.

As I understand it, the Germans are very proud of their
forests. Woe to you if you should run off the road and kill
a small tree. You (or more likely your insurance company)
would legally be expected to pay an irate owner for the
market value of the fu||y—grown tree. Imagine the bills some
lost U.S. tank could (and according to rumor, sometimes
does) run up during maneuvers!

Along the autobahns there are signs of the heightened
military presence. At every bridge there is a little sign stating
the safe weight limits for civilian and military traffic. On the
left side there is a silhouette of a truck, and on the right there
is one of a tank. As it was, I only saw military traffic (con-
voys) after we left the autobahns. it seems there are some
military codes that require columns to move at a low rate
of speed in order to keep the wear on the vehicle down, and
to attempt to reduce the number of military accidents. I would
hate to see what a tractor trailer carrying a pair of A.P.C.s
(Armored Personnel Carriers) would do to your standard
civilian sedan.

Eschenbach is a small town, a few kilometers from the
7th Army Training Corps where my brother works. As I col-
lapsed in a heap (on Army furniture, no less) I heard a dis-
tant, irregular rumbling. I wondered if a storm was ap-
proaching, but it turned out to be the artillery at the base.
It was quite an unnerving experience to be living that close
to real artillery. At home, I could only remember once hav-
ing heard modern artillery firing at an Armed Forces Day

 

As seen from Valhalla, the Danau (Danube) river valley ex-
emplifies the rural side of Bavaria.

demonstration. (They fired inert rounds, of course.) What was
so eerie was that they don't fire practice rounds. It has always
been my experience that people can get used to anything,
and I am certainly no exception. By the time I left, I hardly
noticed the rumbling that the guns made.

Eschenbach also held some very pleasant surprises for
me. One of the more prominant ones was my brother's
landlady, Frau Albersdorfer. While I was there I had the
honor of meeting her husband and children, all of whom
were quite charming and very friendly.

Although they could speak almost no English, it was
quite obvious that Herr Albersdorfer and his wife like the
U.S. Army captain who is their tennant. They told me that
they thought my brother was quite a courageous fellow to
be in the Army — something to be proud of. The conviction
with which they said it was quite surprising to me, though
I don't know why. I had thought that they, of all people,
would have the most reason to resent having the Army so
near them. I couldn't imagine enjoying having artillery go-
ing off all of the time, much less having my hometown crawl-
ing with foreign nationals, especially if they were soldiers.
But then again, I'm an American, from the peaceful state of
Maryland.

I wish that I could have had more time to talk to them,
but as it is, we had a serious communication problem: I don't
speak any German, and they can speak hardly any English.
It was nice to be able to think of them as people just like
me, and not as ”Germans.” I expected them to be different,
and they are, but we had a lot more in common than I had
expected.

My first excursion started the next morning. Under
cloudy skies my brother and I loaded the Pinto and headed
south for Austria. We travelled along the autobahns, stopp-
ing in Regensburg ‘and Passau. According to the Michelin
Tour Guide, both towns have gorgeous cathedrals. Our
observations overwhelmingly confirmed this. We used
Michelin as our bible for the remainder of my stay.

In Regensburg I used my Pitt ID to get student rates to
see a collection of religious treasures, which turned out to
be as ornate as they were beautiful. I'd never seen any
jewelry like that in the States.

14

While we wandered about the churches, I started to-

remember what little bit about architecture I had learned in
grade school: the gothic style, with its impressive spires, and
the ornate (almost to excess) baroque style. I saw many ex-
amples of these and others throughout my trip. I dropped
many a pfenning (the german equivalent of a penny, roughly
one-half cent) in various churches and cathedrals throughout
Germany and Austria, all in the name of architectural
appreciation.

We also visited Valhalla, a temple dedicated to the greats
of humanity by King Ludwig (the crazy). Ludwig is the one
responsible for the storybook castles of Bavaria, including
the one copied by Walt Disney now seen in Disneyland.

 

Ludwig the Crazy built this castle, Schloss Neuschweins-
tein, as his Bavarian capital.

Personally, I don't think old Ludwig was all that crazy.
Even if it is a bit odd to have what looks like a grecian tem-
ple on top of a German hill overlooking the Danau (Danube),
the view of the river is gorgeous. (Not to mention all of the
fees that are collected for parking and admission.) No, I think
Ludwig knew all along that he was making a sound invest-
ment in the German tourist industry.

Seeing the countryside was still a new thing for me, and
words could never suffice for the impression some of those
views left on me. Unfortunately though, I wasn't smart
enough to take many pictures. Part of the enjoyment, I would
suppose, was the relief that the pleasant climate held for me,
in comparison with the heat and humidity I had left behind
in Maryland.

As we were driving along, Robert explained some of the
things that are allowed on the German/Austrian roads. It was
quite a harrowing thought to imagine that anyone can pass
on either side of you (especially on curvy roads that are on-
ly one lane in each direction). I didn't appreciate the thought
of having someone pass me on the left while we were mak-
ing a left turn, either. Bicycles are also legal vehicles, hav-
ing just as much right-of—way as any car. I think the notion
of the ”brave Germans” originated from the people observ-
ing the cyclists always calmly peddling one step away from
disaster.

ln Bavaria they have a custom of placing a cross by the
side of the road where a person or persons were killed in
an automobile accident. There are quite a few crosses along
the roadway.

We crossed into Austria, and headed for Saltzburg. Even-
tually we got there, but only after many long hours on the
Austrian backroads. I had thought the German secondary
roads to be a step down from ours, but the Austrian roads
are two or three levels below them. Part of the reason why
we used the backroads was that we stopped at a Celtic
museum before we reached Saltzburg.

By the time we got there, we had just enough time to
get a map before all of the shops closed. As l quickly learn-
ed, most everyone does their shopping at night, when
everything is closed. That is the reason why so many of the
stores have such extensive window displays. It seems that
everyone windowshops, and comes back to buy things later.
This turned out to be quite interesting, since the streets were
packed. We then spent the night in a gasthaus run by the
military for Americans.

The next morning we drove to Berchtesgarden, which
is in the southeastern corner of the country. Berchtesgarden
is a small town, with a lot of shops, most of which are very
tourist oriented. We wandered through the town before the
shops opened, watching all of the shopkeepers wander off
to their stores. After doing a little shopping, we decided to
visit Mountjenner (pronounced yea—ner) before we headed
back to Saltzburg. Jenner is in the Alps, very near the Austrian
border, overlooking the Konigsee, which is a large, beautiful
Alpine lake. Mnt. Jenner is also very near to the Eagle's Nest,
Hitler's famed mountain retreat.

We took the ride up in an open car, which was very
refreshing (and very cold). It was quite a pleasant change to
leave the early morning bustle of Berchtesgarden for the
almost perfect silence of the Alpine highlands. The views are
fantastic, but the few pictures included here can attest to that
far better than I can in words.

 

Downtown Berchtesgarden provides this scenic view of the
German alps.

From atop Mt. Jenner one can see down into the alpine
crevice that forms the Konigsee.

What turned out to be one of the more interesting aspects
of our visit to the Konigsee and Mnt. Jenner was the fact that
we were probably the only Americans there. Not one other
car had the familiar ”USA” sticker on it. Evidently it is a hot
spot for the Austrian tourists. Personally, I think the Austrians
are really on to something.

Near the top of the mountain (1870 meters) there is a
restaurant and lookout point. Jenner is part of a national park,
but unlike our national parks, is hardly commercialized at
all. The Germans (I think) sacrifice safety for beauty, for most
of the trails that lead to the top of the mountain have no
fences on them whatsoever, which makes for a very beautiful,
unspoiled park. There is a road that leads up to the souvenir
shop/restaurant, but only hea|th~nuts go up that way. The
road (unpaved, of course) snakes its way up the mountain,
going under the more usual form of transport: a cable car.
At some points, I believe the car's ascent reached an angle
approaching upwards of fifty degrees.

Saltzburg is a tourist trap for everybody. Aside from the
Residenz, where a bishop resides, and the various churches,

 every day

The alpine highlands make for beautiful scenery, as seen
here from Mt. Jenner.

one of Saltzburg’s biggest claims to fame is the fact that ”The
Sound of Music” was filmed there. As I understand it, there
is a special tour that (at the cost of many Austrian schillings)
takes the various sight—seers to the places where various
scenes were shot. ”Oh, this is the doorway that was in such-
and—such a scene.” Europeans love to dump on the ‘Dumb
Americans’ but where my schillings are concerned, I'm not
that gullable. Evidently, enough people are.

One of the more tasty versions of commercia|ism—gone—
bezerk finds it's home in Saltzburg: The ever—popular Mort-
zartkugeln. It is a very fine chocolate that is sold over most
of Europe, but it is made in Saltzburg, Mozart's home town,
and thus takes it's name from the famous composer.

Up to this point in ourtravels, my brother and I had been
treated very kindly, especially since I wouldn't say anything,
and my brother speaks fairly good German. Here, however,
we were tourists, and of course not quite so well treated.
I suppose after working all summer in a tourist—haven, I would
be sick to death of foreigners, too.

 

These sheds house some of the boats that cruise on the
Konigsee.

That afternoon, we headed back north, for Eschenbach,
and some rest. As we grew hungry, my brother drove to a
town he knew about, and unfortunately I've forgotten the
name already. The restaurant we stopped at was up on a
ridge, near the ruins of a very ancient castle. It was nice to
back in a place where people were courteous, and where
it was quiet. (And where somebody understood my brother's
Bavarian accent.) The pretty sunset and the good meal were
a nice finishing touch to my first European escapade.

It was well after dark when we arrived at my brother's
apartment. I wandered into my room, and collapsed with
my booty. I still had a few more days to go, but they wouldn't
be nearly as impressionistic as those first days had been.

When I got back to the States, I certainly remembered
the rest of the trip, but most of the things I remember about
them are much more personal. A few of the other places we
visited included the Roman Baths at Baden—Baden, the Black
Forest, the castle at Heidelburg, the Rezidenz at Wurtzburg,
the restaurants of Nurnburg, and the walled town of
Rothenburg.

Germany certainly is a charming country, and I do wish
to return there. If anything, it was a very enjoyable learning
experience, and one I won't soon forget.

gates of the city.

Heaven
and
Hell

It was not a choice; it was a vow. It was a singular deter-
mination to achieve something that he had been told was
impossible. He had been told of those who had tried. There
were those whose reward for trying was a brief moment of
wonder, and then death.

”The chemical alignment within each world is one that
is perfectly fitted to that world's function. You cannot par-
ticipate in a game without adhering to the structure of that
game. Your game here on Midlo is agriculture. You are tuned
to perceive and manipulate the game of agriculture to its
fullest extent. Do you suppose you would function properly
in a machine world? You do not speak their language, and
you do not even see, in a physical sense, in the same way.
Square pegs do not fit round holes.” This was the speech
he received from one of the travelers, the mystical space
truckers whose life was everywhere, whose home was
nowhere. They were able to visit the many individual worlds
because they were tuned for none of them — they were like
blank sheets of paper. ‘

This morning, like every other morning since the gam-
bling trouble at the forest, he lay awake thinking of other
places, the fantasy worlds where no one ever spoke or the
mechanical toylands all but desolate of human life.

Today he would work out at the farm. It would be dif-
ferent out in the open. The forest work was too closed in
~— no air and certainly no sun.

He rose, closing the sleep tank with a customary thud.
He peeled his skinsuit off and showered in the pale green
light. Outside, the lofty swirls of the ammonia streams were
glowing, whispering of the sunrise that lay ahead.

After his breakfast he caught a lift to the work center to
collect the tools issued to him this week: glide shoes, an in-
frared/ultraviolet wormer, and of course, a buzzer. He knew
what the buzzer was for; everyone carried one, but no one
spoke of them. He knew that a 260 pound Tieran cat was
death on four paws. He did not know what good the buzzer
would do if he were attacked. Good luck, and a traveler
might be nearby. He wondered ifthe on-board lasers would
stop a cat. No one ever survived a cat attack, and that was
he cared to believe.

The distributor issued the tools with his usual grunt about
‘bring them back in one piece, right?’. A lovely gentleman,
that one.

Outside the work center, he waited for the lift to the farm.
It arrived six minutes late. As he was boarding, he asked the
driver what the delay was. The driver replied, ”Cats down
by the treesh (02) plant. Two people got it. Control had
everything grounded for a while.”

He took a seat next to a thin, black-haired girl, very pretty
by his standards. He was surprised to see such a girl on her
way to the farm.

”Did you see what happened?” he asked her.

”No.” she replied without turning her eyes from the
window.

”Hmm. Tough cookie,” he thought to himself. Just as
well because he wasn't interested in the typical lift babble
he usually engaged in. His mind was somewhere across the
galaxy.

At the Farm

”All right, listen up: Work details from outside, stick to
sectors K-6 and K-8; details from inside, split into teams and
. . .” so the assignments went on. He activated the shoes,
and skimmed to sector K-6. It seemed ironic that he chose
the farm to avoid trees, so where’d he wind up? Fruit tree
sectors. ‘

He began his work, slowly gliding, circling the trees,
searching for the destructive tinsel worms. By noon the sun
had baked the entire sector so that the air was thick with
peach and apple aroma. He found a nicely shaded spot and
sat for some lunch. In addition to the nice surroundings,
lunch was free — all the apples and peaches he cared to eat.
His thoughts drifted to the outer worlds, thinking how cruel
it was that a simple apple might go as far away as Tris, the
school world on the opposite side of the galaxy, but that he
was bound forever to this miserable world of unending work
rotation.

He was startled by the footsteps that trailed off behind
him. Turning, he caught just a glimpse of the girl from the

18

lift that morning. He got up and started off toward where
she had disappeared into the trees when he heard a
WHOOSH! Dead ahead, not more than 50 yards away, a
glaring white ball was rising into the sun, now just a blip,
now, gone! He was surprised by how fast it had moved.

He was about to continue his search for the girl when
she came gliding toward him.

”Hey, know anything about that?” he pointed.

She said, ”Yea, it goes WHOOSH!, and it moves like
a glide shoe that got loose. What about you?”

”Can’t say I do but —;” she turned and glided away
quickly as if he'd insulted her.

The rest of the day was a blur. All he could think about
was the blip in the sky. The stories he'd heard about pirates
and revolutionaries, he thought, were just that — stories.
There certainly was no chance of a UFO landing, or even
entering the galaxy, without Control knowing about it. The
folklore said that the cats that were such a menace were drop-
ped here by aliens to disrupt the agri-system of this galaxy,
presumably to facilitate an invasion.

The Girl

Later, at his favorite watering hole, he asked around, but
like himself, everyone was void of information.

”How about a drink, Picker?” a woman's voice chirped.

”What the, who was that!?” he asked himself. He careful-
ly moved to the uplifted arm at the table, but the face was
obscured by the smoke and darkness. She was motioning
him to sit down, which he did. There she was, the girl from
the lift.

”Where’d you come up with ’Picker’? No one here
knows the face that goes with that name, both items being
mine. You weren't at the forest. I'd be grateful if you'd
swallow that name. Forever!” Picker said coldly. He didn't
like her so much now.

”All the comps have you tagged ‘Picker’. I must admit,
the face threw me. My congratulations to you. Nobody ever
beat the shell game like you did. You should have realized
that you'd be irritating to the loggers. You did the right thing
in revisualizing yourself. But you ought to swallow your
name yourself, if ever want to get off this rock. By the way,
my name is Kate.”

Picker was dumbfounded. His name, his past, the face
job, his desire to check out of Midlo; she knew it all. He
was insulted, and he demanded an explanation. What she
told him nearly gave him a stroke.

”My name is Kate. I'm from Auseenach. That's right, Au-
seenach, the great galactic pen in the sky. I am part of the
Interstitial Movement. I was not a criminal by nature, like
most of the refuse on Auseenach. I was tired of my routine
on Ben-Thou (ben’tau), and I requested relocation. My work
on genetics on Ben-Thou made me aware that I can go
anywhere I damned well pleased. I threatened the wrong per-
son at Control, so I was rewarded with a relocation — to Au-
seenach. I was not alone. Exactly fourteen of us, twelve years
ago began the Interstitial Movement. We had a great deal
of work to do. The Orion galaxy is very large. Control has
seen to it that most worlds only know that there are other
worlds, but not where or why or what kind. We needed to

catalogue them. We needed the means to travel to the other
worlds. It took us 6 years to simulate the genetic situation
Control has created. We've learned to manipulate brainwave
forms, the alpha and beta only, to the extent that the
waveform detectors that are all over the galaxy can be fool-
ed. The mental discipline associated with travel was not
discovered until ourfirst mission; Hobbs, bless his deft little
fingers, went to the mechanic planet as a stowaway. He
planned to study propulsion by the leptonium process. What
was not known to us was that Control monitored wave con-
tent, not only wave form. He was discovered in two days.
He did nothing to help solve the transport problem, but he
discovered the chink in the Control fence. We've developed
the art of spontaneous psycho—schism, or ’spys’ for short. Very
synonymous with the ancient definition.”

”You want to know how I know so much about you?
You think very loudly. Your concentration is very deep, but
fluidous. Your thoughts are very much association oriented,
rather than construction oriented. I could hear every ’word’
you said this morning on the lift,” Kate said.

”Everything?!?” Picker was embarrassed. He raised his
glass, and took a healthy belt. Kate was smiling. She had been
lonely and on the run for quite a while, like Picker. She
assented to his suggestion that they go somewhere less
crowded to talk. He suggested his apartment, and she agreed.
They did not speak much, however.

At the Farm

On their way to the farm the next day, Picker couldn't
stop talking.

”So it really isn't permanent! All the baloney about
geneosporic degeneration, transitional anomalization, the
whole thing. Just so Control can decorate their lousy base
planet with the profits of over 200 separate planets! It's
incredible.”

’’It’s possible, but it is extremely difficult," Kate said soft-
ly. She was not sure Picker would want to leave. ”Do you
realize the work involved in the mental training you will go
through?”

Picker looked directly at her and said, ’’I will do whatever
I must to leave Midlo.”

They arrived at the farm and immediately glided to the
spot where the blip had appeared the day before.

”Be very still. I must reach out to the pilot. You distracted
me yesterday, and he missed me. My instructions to him must
be perfect. Everything is going to happen in a blink, so
prepare yourself for about a 4—G lift.”

True to her word, it happened in a blink. He could
remember a tingling, like a static charge buildup, then the
feeling that his stomach was going to relocate into his blad-
der, then blackness.

He woke up feeling like dirt.

”Did you have a nice nap?” Kate was asking him.

”Oh, sure, the hangover is a barrel of laughs, too!”

”You blacked out above 200 miles up. Not bad for your
first time.”

He unbuckled himself from his seat and thrust himself
toward the glycene window port.

”Hopefully my last! So long, suckers!” Picker cackled.

”Don't be too hasty. Your life is just beginning. You must
assume a completely new attitude, memory, vocabulary; you
name it, you'll have to replace it,” Kate warned him.

”What happens if I don't? Suppose I miss a detail
somewhere!” He felt very vulnerable and nervous. He
wondered if Auseenach and points beyond would be any
better than Midlo. Then, for no reason, his mind began to
be filled with visions of flowers and oceans. A cool breeze
blowing across his mind reminded him of the night before.
He turned and looked at Kate. She was smiling, and he then
realized that everything would be fine with Kate there to help
him and love him. He had finally traded hell for heaven.

The Skyscraper staff congratulates Ron Kuhn, a junior
in the Electrical Engineering department, who was the win-
ner of the December issue's twenty—five dollar Skycaper prize.
Ron submitted the most correct answers (3 out of 5) and was
the earliest entry received.

The solutions to the December Skycaper are as follows:

(1) The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of each side.

A3 = 12 ush = approximately 853.2 meters
BC = 532 favn = approximately 1000.2 meters
CD = 12 sides of a besana = approximately 610.6 meters
DE = 123 perch = approximately 787.2 meters
EA = 945 yards = approximately 864.1 meters

AB + BC + CD + DE + EA = 4115.3 meters, which equals
about 61 730 gereh gazi sha. Since different conversion tables
round off differently, reasonably close answers were accepted
as correct.

E

Fiburc rut Jraunt to scale.

(2) One pair of brown socks plus one pair of black socks plus
one pair of blue socks sums to three pairs of socks, which
is six socks.

(3) 251, 542, 1262, 2614, , 6842
251 two five one = 10 letters
542 five four two = 11 letters
1262 one two six two = 12 letters
2614 two six one four = 13 letters
= 14 letters
6842 six eight four two = 15 letters

Consider each number of the series as a string of digits
and replace each digit with its word name. Find the number
of letters in each string. The numbers of letters form an
arithmetic progression. Any number in which the number
of letters forming its digits is equal to fourteen will fit the
series, for example: 5192. (five one nine two = 14 letters)

(4) Let sun = y; then mun = 2y2. Let min = 2x; then
sim = 5x. Let sum = 22; then mon =32.

sum = sim + 1
Substituting 22 = 5x + 1
z = (5x + 1)/2
Substituting for 2: sum = 5x + 1
mon = 15x/2 + 3/2
nim = sum
Substituting: nim = 5x + 1

Then the total of all items (sun + mun + min + sim
+sum + mon + nim) is between 40 and 50, inclusive. Thus,
the total (y + 2y2 + 2x + 5x + 5x+1 +15x/2+3/2 +
5x+1), which is equal to (y + 2y2 + 49x/2 + 7/2), is bet-
ween 40 and 50, inclusive. Therefore, (y + 2y2 +49/x2) is
between 36‘/2 and 46‘/2 inclusive.

For each of the above items to be a positive integer, x
and y must be positive and x and y must be integers. For
x greater than or equal to 2, (y + 2y2 + 49x/2) is not less
than 46‘/2. Therefore, x must equal 1, and (y + 2y2) must
be between 12 and 22.

Solving by trial and error for y as shown in the accom-
panying chart, y = 3.

y_ y + 2y2
1 3

2 9

3 21*

4 36

Therefore, the number of mun = 2y2 = 2(3)2 = 18.

(5) The latitude, longitude, and elevation of Benedum Hall
may be found on the base of the statue of George Means
Bevier located just outside the doors of the Bevier Engineer-
ing Library.

Latitude = 40 26’ 38"
Longitude = 79 57’ 32"
Elevation = 979.727 feet

Remember when electronic

That’s just one sign of the

But how will we use micro-
chips that are smarter,

How will these new micro-

On the cover

This issue's cover is a photograph of the diffraction pat-
tern resulting from the projection of a low power helium-
neon laser through a small aperture. The aperture in this case
was a photographic negative of a silhouette of our Skyscraper
logo. The project was originally conceived by Dr. Eugene
Engels of Pitt's physics department. Our artist Dave King
copied the logo onto a clear acetate sheet and then blackened
the interior with ink.

Through the assistance of Dr. Z. H. Meiksin of the Elec-
trical Engineering department, arrangements were made to
photographically reduce the logo by a factor of twenty-to-
one, using the integrated circuit mask-making facilities of the
EE department. Bob Kilgore donated a generous amount of
time to photographing the artwork and developing the
negative. The result of this process was our logo appearing
as a clear spot one millimeter in diameter on a black
background.

Finally, Dr. Joel Falk granted permission for us to use
Benedum’s laser lab to set up the project. A helium-neon
laser was shot through the logo, and a lens was used to focus
the bright red image onto white paper. Skyscraper
photographer Mike Murray then photographed this image.
The lens was then removed, and the small aperture diffrac-
tion pattern was superimposed on the original picture.
Roobik Gharabagi rendered valuable assistance in the
mechanics of arranging the apparatus used.

The Skyscraper staff extends its appreciation to all those
who contributed their time and effort to the production of
our cover.

A matter is currently under consideration in the School
of Engineering which concerns education, cooperation and
university politics. There have traditionally been students in
the School of Engineering interested in pursuing more than
a standard undergraduate engineering program. A student
generally tailors the engineering curriculum to his specific
needs. This may be done through the judicious selection of
elective courses or by taking additional courses in the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences. Some students, however, opt for
an even broader and more extensive exploration of a par-
ticular subject area. Until recently, such a student could ar-
range a double-degree. For example, there are currently
students in the Engineering School pursuing double-degrees
in Chemical Engineering and Chemistry, and Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science. These programs are
generally arranged on an individual basis since a small
number of students are involved and since each student's
particular plans and schedules have to be carefully evaluated.
Soon, however, this approach will no longer be possible.

Formerly, a prospective doub|e—degree student would
first obtain an engineering degree and then complete CAS
requirements during his fifth year. A total of ninety credits
could be transferred to CAS, including eighteen non-CAS
credits. Beginning this year, however, the College of Arts and
Sciences curriculum reform program is going into effect. Ad-
ditional requirements, such as the foreign language require-
ment, are being phased-in over a three year period. In two
more years, up to one—half of a student's credits will be credits
required by CAS. With these changes, it will no longer be
possible for a studentto complete the requirements for both
a CAS and an engineering degree even in five years.

It is here that a cooperative effort is necessary between
the two schools. Unless a five-year dual degree program is
formalized soon, it will not be possible to arrange such a
program on an individual basis. This would be a serious loss
to both schools, since a highly capable student interested
in such a dual—degree program would look elsewhere for the
education he desired. ’

Fortunately, this academic option need not be closed.
Formal discussions between Dean Irwin Schulman of CAS
and Associate Dean William Rudoy of the Engineering
School have been initiated concerning the five-year program.
in addition, Barry Applbaum and Dr. Alec Stewart of the
University Honors Program are willing to coordinate the dual-
degree option through the honors center. Pitt's honors pro-
gram, operating not through any particular school but rather
directly under the Provost, has had considerable experience
in crossing the borders of CAS and engineering to develop
an interdisciplinary program. It seems that this difficulty may
be the greatest obstacle to the successful implementation of
the five-year program.

The difficulty arises from the political and bureaucratic
problems of crossing school boundaries. lnevitably, it seems,
a program in which a student would first register in CAS and
then transfer into engineering will raise accusations of the
program being a ”back door into engineering.” It is time that
the basic reality of the situation be examined: there are a
number of motivated students willing to sacrifice time, ef-
fort and money to obtain a broad undergraduate education.
These are not students merely looking for an ”easy way” in-
to the School of Engineering. They are people who realize
the value of both a CAS degree and an engineering degree.
In addition, Associate Dean Rudoy feels that an equitable
selection process can be established which will in no way
worsen the crowded conditions of the engineering school.

The time has come for action on this matter. The Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences, the honors program and Associate
Dean Rudoy have all asked that interested students contribute

to the formulation of the details of the five-year program. This
is one instance where it will surely benefit the university to
slice through CAS-engineering red tape. Quality students will
be attracted to the dual-degree program, and increased
cooperation between our two schools can only help to foster
a more favorable academic environment. Dean Schulman
and Associate Dean Rudoy have taken the initiative in this
matter and now have a rare opportunity to create a valuable
academic option. It is hoped that this opportunity will be
effectively implemented for the benefit of student and univer-
sity alike.

This month’s Skyscraper Engineer is the third issue
published since our present staff set to work late last sum-
mer. I want to thank this talented and creative group of
writers, photographers and artists for their enthusiastic ef-
forts for our magazine. Many members of the Skyscraper staff
have done far more than their fair share of work, and it is
because of these people that Skyscraper is once again a
viable journalistic enterprise. I also extend my thanks to Mrs.
Lori Shuff Vozza, Mr. Charles Aveni, and the members of
the Engineering Student Cabinet, for the encouragement and
assistance they have provided. Of course, this publication
could not exist without the support of our readers, and your
favorable response has been appreciated. Once again I en-
courage anyone who wishes to contribute in any way to
Skyscraper to join us. You can help us to create a quality
medium for the expression of the creativity and individuali-
ty of the students in Pitt's Engineering School and have a
good time as well.

Collisions in Chemistry

by Debbie Burks and Dave Mahofski

When Dr. Peter Siska, Ph.D., physical chemist at the
University of Pittsburgh, first embarked upon his
undergraduate education, he desired to pursue a career in
physics. His plans soon changed when he was introduced
to professors in both the physics and chemistry departments.
At that time he made the observation that chemists were
crazier than physicists. This attribute, as regarded by Dr.
Siska, attracted him toward gaining his B.S. in chemistry at
DePaul University for he felt he was better adapted to a
chemist’s way of life.

Pitt's DEC-10 computer system is a vital tool for Dr. Siska’s
research.

While attending DePaul University Dr. Siska found his
first motivation for his studies of molecular collisions. This
motivation came specifically from his early chemistry courses
combined with his first physics class on quantum mechanics.
Through his chemistry courses he was introduced to the struc-
ture of complex atoms, while in physics he was introduced
to collisions of nucleons. At Harvard Dr. Siska met a pro-
fessor who was applying the physics of collisions to
chemistry. This fascinated Dr. Siska, who soon joined the
professor's research group. He went on to earn both his
Masters and his Ph.D. in physical chemistry at Harvard
University.

When he arrived at the University of Pittsburgh in
September, 1971, he began at the drawing board. His ob-
jective was to design an apparatus to study the forces and
energetics involved in molecular collisions, a Crossed
Molecular Beam Machine. After three months of drafting
plans, he contracted its construction. After approximately two
years of work, he was able to obtain reliable data and to in-
terpret some of it. In the nine years that have followed, he
has published about fifteen papers on his research with this
machine.

The focus of his research involves scattering experiments.
A beam of excited ”metastab|e” rare gas atoms (such as those
symbolized by He*, Ar*, and Xe*) is collided at a right angle
with a beam of gas molecules such as N2 or NO. A
metastable molecule is one which has an excited electron
configuration state but does not radiate. After the molecules
collide, they scatter at various angles with respect to the
original metastable beam. A scattering detector is then used
to measure the intensity of reception of unreacted metastable
gas molecules or other molecules which may have been
formed by the collision. This dectector can be rotated from
an angle of O to 120 degrees with respect to the metastable
beam.
