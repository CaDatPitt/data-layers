A tennis champion’s powerful backhand looks as smooth and
unhurried as a ballerina’s graceful bow. How’s he do it? By being in
the right position in plenty of time.
“Remember this about the backhand,” the pros advise. “Get both
feet around pointing toward the sideline. And always make sure the right
foot’s forward, so your body doesn’t cramp your swing.”
Getting into proper position early is good advice for college seniors, too.
Here’s the ﬁrst step:
When companies interview on your campus, make sure they interview you. When the
Timken Company representative stops by, don’t let him go without seeing you.

He’ll ﬁll you in on our work (maybe your work) with the aerospace, automotive,
construction, chemical industries. Our openings in production, engineering, sales,
ﬁnance, metallurgy.
So you won’t get caught ﬂat footed when it’s your turn to make your move.

Open Letter

from the Dean

by Dean Harold E. Hoelsher

We did not have a “Dean’s Seminar” at the start of this
academic year, and, I am therefore using this method to bring
you up—to-date on recent developments within our School. The
decision to eliminate most joint seminars, including the
“Dean’s Seminar,” was made on the recommendation of a
joint student/faculty seminar-study group consisting of
representatives from the Engineering Student Cabinet and the
Engineering Undergraduate Administrative Committee.

Table I shows the numbers of students by departments
within the School of Engineering during the 1968-69 fall term.
The 1969-70 data will not be substantially different. We
admitted a smaller freshman class (315 students) for the
1969-70 academic year. We did this primarily because it
conserves space. Benedum Hall is still delayed.

The increase in our faculty this year is shown on Table
II. The rate of new additions to our faculty has also been
restrained for lack of space. Unless our space problems are
soon eased, we may park trailers for faculty offices in front of
Engineering Hall.

Table III summarizes the degrees granted in Engineering
for the past six academic years. We are one of the 190 schools
with ECPD accredited curricula, and we graduate slightly more
than one percent of the nation’s total Bachelor of Science
graduates in Engineering and slightly less than one percent of
the nation’s masters and doctoral students.

Recruiting of our graduates by industry was again
intense, and all of our students received multiple offers of
employment. Starting salaries increased again this year.

As noted earlier, one of our major problems is the delay
in construction of The Michael L. Benedum Hall of
Engineering, scheduled for completion last November. The
building has been topped off and some initial moves into the
subbasement may begin this academic year. My personal
opinion is that we will complete the moving and be
operational in Benedum Hall during the late fall of 1970 or
spring of 1971. I continue to feel that this will soon be one of
the finest facilities for engineering education in our nation.

The undergraduate curriculum is still developing. I spent
the week of June 22 at Penn State for the annual meeting of
the American Society for Engineering Education and had
discussions of undergraduate programming with many
engineering deans from throughout the United States and
other countries. I still believe that our first four terms provide
the finest possible base for an engineering education. You will

recall that we have three common terms -- a sacrifice of .

ﬂexibility in the freshman-sophomore years for much
increased ﬂexibility in the junior-senior years. The first three
terms we call “foundation building”; they are designed to
provide the fundamental information required by all engineers
regardless of their specific professional interests. The fourth is

a transition term wherein a student begins course work in his
selected engineering major. The junior-senior years are
intended to be ﬂexible and to provide a maximum
opportunity to all students for program development in
accordance with their personal interests and motivations as
these have developed during the lower-division years. I would
urge all students to counsel with their faculty advisors for full
advantage of ﬂexibility and individual program development in
the junior-senior years.

The past academic year was marked by a number of
interesting and significant events for us. In October we hosted
the International Conference on Industrialization and
Development, a Conference which drew more than 200
participants from 22 countries throughout the world. In the
spring we hosted an International Symposium on
Thermodynamics, sponsored by the Chemical Engineering
Department, and a Conference on Modeling and Simulation,
which was principally an activity of the Electrical Engineering

The Engineering Student Cabinet continues to be an
important adjunct to the operation and development of our
School. This past year was marked by several new activities of
Cabinet, and present Cabinet officers now find themselves
challenged to meet the standards of their immediate
predecessors. I sincerely hope that all students in the School
will be interested in Cabinet, will support its activities, and
participate in its programs. Table IV presents a partial list of
Cabinet activities last year. The list was prepared by Ed
Levine, the former president of Cabinet.

Additional details of many of the items mentioned in
this letter are contained in the School of Engineering Annual
Report. A limited number of copies of the report are available
and may be obtained in my office. '

Since I did not have an opportunity to talk with you in a
joint seminar, through this letter the departmental chairman
and faculty join me in extending to you our sincere wishes for
a most successful academic year. We look forward to a year of
cooperation and continued progress for the School of

The Canadian-American Challenge Cup has grown from
infancy in 1966 to the most prestigious and richest series of
road races in the world in 1969. This is truly a championship
for drivers as well as equipment. Such names as Denis Hulme,
Bruce McLaren, John Surtees, Jim Hall, and Dan Gurney
frequent the entrants lists, driving some of the most
sophisticated and expensive racing equipment in the sport.
Handsome purses and liberal rules have led to the development
of the fastest road—racing cars in the world for the booming
Can-Am series.

No one knows just how fast they will go, these Can-Am
cars. But they are the fastest racing cars in the world, fastest in
the sense of getting around a road course as quickly as
possible. They have proved it several times, with faster lap

speeds at tracks like Mosport where the Formula I Grand Prix
cars also run. At all the tracks in the U.S. and Canada they’re
geared down for maximum acceleration instead of top speed.
Even so, at Riverside they’ll approach 200 on the back
straight. Considering that the Le Mans Mark IV Fords could do
220 mph with 100 less horsepower and a higher roof line, a
top Can-Am car might be able to go 250 mph with the right
gearing.

I have been quite privileged the past six months to be
permitted to observe and to assist in the preparation of one of
these cars. From my viewpoint as a future engineer and the
experience I have gained, here are some of the ingredients
necessary to be competitive in such a machine.

limitations that stand in the way of building an ultimate racing
car. For instance, there is no limitation on engine size and
type, except for turbines, which are ineligible. There are no
rules for body work except that there be room for a passenger
and the engine must be covered except for the intake and
exhaust systems which may be outside. The wheels must be
inside the bodywork also.

The size of engines used have varied in the past, but now
almost all entrants are powered by huge American V-8 engines.
There have been exceptions. Ferrari has entered cars with
small V-12 engines in the past, but this year they are entering a
6.2 litre V-12, the biggest engine seen yet in a Ferrari. Dan
Gurney tried unsuccessfully to beat the opposition with a
small engine and ultra-light car, but even he is now resigned to
the big engines. Since there is no limitation on weight, the
designers favor the big bore aluminum V-8’s of Chevrolet and
Ford. Most of these engines go about seven liters, 427 cubic
inches or slightly over and produce up to 660 horsepower
revving safely to 7000 rpm. The aluminum block and cylinder
heads cause the engine to lose power compared to an iron
block but they make up for that by slicing off the weight the
power has to push.

Almost all the front runners have gone to fuel injection
which increases the power and gives better response to the
throttle. Bruce McLaren, designer of the seemingly invincible
McLaren cars initiated this in 1967 along with the vaporization
of fuel in the manifold to cool the gasoline in the system,
reducing the chance of vapor lock.

Another important trend has been to dry sump oil
systems. There is an extra big oil pump whose only job is to
suck the oil out of a very shallow pan as it falls from the
engine, and pump it to a separate oil tank. From there the oil
pressure pump sends it to the bearings. The separate oil tank
can hold much more oil than a conventional sump, allowing
the oil to be cooled much more efficiently, helped by the
separate oil radiators that are always used, and a properly
designed tank can extract unwanted air from the oil.

Most Can-Am cars also carry a separate cooler for the oil
in the transaxle, which can get pretty warm carrying high
torques at high speeds. Most cars use five speed Hewland
gearboxes, although some use only four speeds. A very
interesting exception to these manual transmissions is Jim
Hall’s famous automatic box, a three speed.

Some of the most dramatic tire development has taken
place in Can-Am racing, again because there are no limits to
the expansion of tire width. On an open-wheeled car, the tire
offers a lot of the aerodynamic drag. A wider tire can often
slow the car down. Not so in the envelope-bodied Can-Am car.
This year’s tire width has reached 17 inches. This much rubber
on the road increases cornering ability and acceleration and
braking rates. Since tire widths of much more than the present
seem almost impossible due to the lack of room, the next
alternative to increasing traction is four-wheel-drive. Some of
the major competitors have already undertaken development
of this project. Bruce McLaren and Eric Broadley are presently
planning such cars for next year.

What holds all this machinery together? — A great big
fuel tank with a hole in it for the driver to sit in. This is what
is known as monocoque type construction. The two fuel tanks
on either side of the driver are composed of stressed boxes of
very thin aluminum sheet for light weight and strength. The
tubular space frame, once considered the end of the line for a
racing car chassis, is now completely obsolete.

The independent suspension is composed of tubular
links and concentric coil-shock units. For the MSA, McLaren
made a radical departure from his competitors by using the
engine, with some tubular braces, as the rear part of the frame.
The front of the engine was attached to the monocoque tub
and the rear part, where the transaxle was attached, carried the
rear suspension. These developments of a monocoque chassis,
fiberglass body, tubular suspension, and aluminum engines
combined to bring the total weight of a Can-Am car down to
1450 pounds, approximately the same as an MG Midget. With
600 horsepower and this kind of weight, performance is
outstanding. Like zero to 100 mph in a little more than 5
seconds.

Certain aerodynamic aides have become evident in the

past couple of years: a wide scoop-like nose that is as close to .

the ground as possible; an upward flow of air out of the back
of the radiator; vents in the front fenders that keep air
pressure from building up there; and rear wings about 30
inches above the rear deck all combine to help keep the car
glued to the road at high speeds.

So any of you aspiring engineers who would like to earn
$10,000 on a Sunday afternoon, pit your talents against
engineers such as Jim Hall or Bruce McLaren and try designing
one of these $50,000 gems.

If you want to engineer

a better world 

a great place to start is with
one of the most diversified companies
in the world.

Westinghouse thinks its responsibili-
ties are as big as its capabilities—
and that’s big.

And when you’re in everything from
computers to urban development, to
medical science, to mass transit, to
oceanography—there’s action. For
example...

Transportation: Our computerized
transit systems can operate on a 90-
second schedule, and meet the
transportation needs of many cities.

Urban Development: Our new con-
struction concepts will provide bet-
ter communities across the country.

Projects are planned or underway in.

30 major cities.
Health Care: We are using a sys-

tems approach to provide better
medical care for more people. Ex-
ample: electronic equipment that
lets nurses monitor the hearts of
eight patients simultaneously.

Nuclear Power: Westinghouse
leads the way in nuclear power gen-
eration. Seven nuclear plants in op-
eration, 34 in various stages of de-
sign. We’re working on a breeder
reactorto keep us ahead.

That’s a sampling. We’re just get-
ting started. If you’d like to help us

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER _ OCTOBER-NOVEMBER, ‘I969

The chairs are lumpy. You get
edgy. You develop coffee mouth. You're
bored.

In the not-too-distant future, air-
ports may be using an FMC Corpora-
tion machine to disperse fog and all
those attendant miseries. We’ve already
tried it out in Sacramento, California,
and it works. Someday, it may be stand-
ard equipment at airports around the
world.

Actually, you don't know it, but
even now you come in contact with
FMC every day in a hundred differ-
ent ways.

That candy bar you ate at noon-
we probably made the machinery that
wrapped it. We made the Avril® rayon
fibers in your slacks and the Dynacor®
cord in your radial tires.

On a grander scale we are a major
factor in alleviating the world’s food
problems. Harvesting machines, fertiliz-
ers, packaging equipment—FMC is in-
volved in every phase of food production
except actually growing it——but we do
supply seeds.

We even make fire engines.

In this day and age, it’s important
to do what you can to make life more
productive. Naturally, we look forward
to meeting people who are similarly
inclined.

Write or ask your placement direc-
tor for the descriptive brochure, “Careers
with FMC.” FMC Corporation, Box 760,
San Jose, California 95106. We are an
equal opportunity employer.

a bright young engineer
should spend
his most imaginative years on
the same assignment?

Neither do we.

That’s why we havea two-

graduating engineers who
would prefer to explore several
technical areas. And that’s why
many of our areas are organ-
ized by function—rather than
by project.

At Hughes, you might
work on spacecraft, communi-

While still in kindergarten, science was
already moving to make Dennis Twining a
hot property.

”By the eleventh grade they launched Sput-
nik I. The science race was on and I was in
it. I started cramming.

”After high school, I had a chance to
go to the University of Michigan and work
as a research assistant.

”Our projectwas in a cemetery in case
of explosions. Great for dates.

”When I got my metallurgy degree
there were sixty companies with jobs for
six of us. I checked out the top ten and
picked International Nickel. Why?

”Because they gave me the best chance
to stay at the front edge of technology and
also learn the other half of the equation—
business.

”Itworked.

’’I spent the first year in research. Then
moved on to marketing—Chicago, Hart-
ford, and now New York. Fantastic city.

”|’m responsible for development in
mainstream markets—motor freight, con-
tainerization, construction equipment.

”Here I am on Wall Street, past half-
way to my MBA at NYU with a thousand
opportunities in front of me.

”Yes, Sputnik took me quite a way.”

  

Nickel helps other metals resist heat, cold, im-
pact, pressure, abrasion, corrosion...to advance
engineering in vital fieIds—power, desalination,
electronics, transportation, aerospace.

We're doing everything we can to produce
more nickel. Searching around the world—In-
donesia, Australia, Guatemala, Canada. We've
found ways to extract nickel from ores thought
too poor to mine a few years ago.

We count our blessings and respect our sur-
roundings. From nickel ores, we recover plati-
num, palladium, twelve other commercially
useful elements. Make iron pellets for steel.
Convert smoke in our stacks to chemicals for
other industries. On sand left from processing
ore, we grow meadows of hay.

We are 33,000 people hard at work in 18 coun-
tries—miners, researchers, market builders. We

another anonymous entity in a faceless environ-
ment. Forget it. It won't happen with us. If
you want to be you, Sikorsky Aircraft is where
you should be.

You see, we welcome fresh, inquiring minds with
the desire to probe and, above all, participate.
At Sikorsky, you won't see your ideas swept into
a corner . . .orswap your identity for a paycheck.

So, if you're a highly motivated young engineer
with a strong sense of identity, consider these
facts. You'll be your own man . . . helping us to
spark further advances in VTOL aircraft tech-
nology. You'll contribute to writing the book on
Heavy-Lift Skycranes—-Tilt Rotor Transports—-
High-Speed ABC Commercial Transports—and
the exciting shapes of tomorrow.

And as an innovator, you'll find ample creative
opportunities in: aerodynamics 0 human factors

We developed

Buta lot of engineers 
still don't get   
the picture. 

Like, we'll ask a graduating engineer:

”What opportunities do you think an engineer has
if he works for the telephone company?”

And, zap—we get a blackout!

Well, we think the company responsible for
engineering innovations such as the transistor, radio
astronomy, high fidelity and stereo recording,
magnetic tape, synthetic crystals, negative feedback,
sound motion pictures, microwave relay, electronic
switching, the solar battery and telstar deserves a
consideration that's strong and clear.

Black Gold Rush

Introduction

Though most of the excitement about recently
discovered oil fields in Alaska has been stirred up by
exploration on the North Slope, Cook Inlet is also undergoing
rapid development at the present time. In fact, the solutions to
many of the problems that arise because of such a rugged
environment will be found in development of Cook Inlet.
These answers will be invaluable as development of the North
Slope gets underway.

Drilling for oil and subsequent development of oil fields
has gone on for many years on land. From the time when man
dug wells (not necessarily for oil) with a pick and shovel to the
present day when drilling is a science with giant rigs, many
advances have been made. The abundance of oil in certain
offshore areas such as Louisiana, Texas and California enticed
man to expand his technology in drilling to the water. The
first offshore wells were drilled in about thirty feet of water.
The most recent wells have been drilled in water 300 to 400
feet deep. Currently wells are being planned for parts of the
continental shelf 600+ feet under water. Offshore oil
exploration, in itself, is a formidable problem; coupled with
the hazards of the Alaskan environment, it is, perhaps, the
greatest challenge to petroleum engineering.

Cook Inlet provides an assortment of hostilities:
temperatures that drop to -40°F and keep the inlet frozen
eight months out of the year, tides that rise thirty feet and
currents that run seven or eight miles an hour, sixty miles an
hour winds that make fifteen foot waves, plus visibility that
may drop to zero and even occasional earthquakes! All these
problems must be satisfactorily solved if oil operations in
Cook Inlet are to be successful.

The Drilling Platform

In order to efficiently drill wells offshore, the drilling
platform was developed. In general, a platform is a miniature
island on legs with drilling and production decks, a storage
tank to hold the produced oil, living quarters for the workers
and various other necessities (such as a heliport). All the wells

40

in Alaska

by Robert Settle

are drilled from one platform, called directional drilling.
Modern platforms are capable of drilling twenty-four wells in a
radial pattern with the platform in the center.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the offshore platforms are
designed to operate in all kinds of weather, including
hurricanes and tidal waves. This type of structure, called the
Gulf Coast templet structure, however, is not suitable for use
in Cook Inlet because the legs and supports are too small to
withstand the tremendous forces of ice. Likewise a rock-island
type platform and a barge that could be jacked-up were also
scrapped. As research into the conditions that exist in Cook
Inlet continued, it became evident that the tower platform was
most suited for use. At the present time, the four-legged tower
is most often found; eleven of the fourteen existing platforms
are four-legged; two are three-legged, and one is one-legged.

A four-legged tower in Cook Inlet may involve the
following components and construction. Spaced in a 70 by 90
foot rectangle, there are four legs about fifteen feet in
diameter. At the top, the legs are connected with circular
girders of the same diameter. Below the ice zone, four—foot
and six—foot diameter braces are placed horizontally and
diagonally. The tower is designed to be above the high water
mark by some thirty feet. It may weigh about 6,000 tons. On
top the structure, there are three decks, one for drilling, one
for production and one for auxiliary equipment. On the
upper-most deck are living quarters three-stories high with a
heliport roof. Two cranes are also provided for equipment
handling. It may be interesting to note that storage places had
to be extra large to hold enough supplies to enable the
platform to function in the likely event that supply vessels
could not reach the area. Also, all decks are completely
enclosed, insulated and heated to protect the oil men from the
bitter weather.

Design

Taking into consideration twenty different loading
conditions, the towers are designed by computer. For a
diagram of the forces involved, refer to the diagram. The two

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER __ OCTOBER-NOVEMBER, ‘I969

most important loads to be exerted on the structure were the
drilling and operational loads acting vertically and the forces
of maximum ice thickness acting laterally. Those forces can
reach 20,000 tons vertically and 20,000 tons laterally. The
forces of waves, wind and even earthquakes were determined
to be so small as to be negligible. In anchoring the tower on
piles, it was assumed that the rapid tidal currents could scour
the inlet floor by about five feet.

Driving the piles that support these structures is another
problem. They can be driven only about 100 feet into the
bottom of the inlet. Each pile can support a vertical load of
5,400 tons and a horizontal load of 600 tons. However, they
are arranged in a double design. First, a thirty-six inch
diameter pile is driven to the maximum depth of 100 feet.
Then a hole is drilled through the center of the pile; the hole is
thirty inches in diameter and 190 feet deep. Into the hole
drilled, is placed a twenty-four inch pile and it is anchored in
place by cement. A barge is used to place the thirty-six inch
pile; the inner pile isinstalled by the permanent drilling rig.

Several new designs were incorporated into the Cook

Inlet platforms. One of these innovations is the diver access_

tubes. Installed in two diagonally opposite legs, the tubes are
three feet in diameter and run from the top of the tower to
the bottom. These tubes enable the divers to get to the bottom

at any time, even when the ice would otherwise prevent it.

Second of the new ideas are the diagonal pipeline
pulltubes. These are fourteen-inch tubes installed in each of
the four diagonal cross braces on the tower. Placing the
pipeline tubes here eliminated the need for under-water
pipeline connections and protects the pipelines from damage
by ice.

Third, a new type of tublar joint was used for the first
time. Rather than a simple weld of the smaller diameter pipe
to the larger at joints, the smaller pipe flares out and the
intersection of the two forms an ellipse. Such a configuration
greatly lowers the stress concentrations. Still another way of
strengthening the tower is to fill the annular spaces with
cement.

Mechanics

The general workability of the platforms involves other
problems. Because of the high oxygen content of the rapidly
moving and turbulent water in the inlet, corrosion and pitting
are major concerns. In addition to this chemical action, the
towers suffer physical erosion from the high concentration of
silt and abrasives in the water as well as from the constant
punishment dealt by ice. Constant action by ice during periods
of heavy icing is enough to keep a polish on the legs of the
platform. Currently there is an allowance of 0.7 inches in the

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER _ OCTOBER-NOVEMBER, 1969

A deck section module in Seattle, Wash. Completed units were rolled onto barges in adjacent dry dock and

towed to Cook Inlet.

wall thickness of the legs and cathodic protection is being
utilized to the extent that it has been researched. Testing
programs involving the towers already in place in Cook Inlet
involve the evaluation of different metals. They are strapped in
the form of plates to the legs at different levels and tested for
wear.

Because of the low temperatures in Cook Inlet, low
temperature steels had to be used to prevent bristle cracking.
All exposed areas of the towers are constructed of ASTM
A-537 low temperature steels. Three criteria were used in
designing the steel that went into these platforms. First, of
course, was the temperature criterion. The cold temperatures
and the amount of exposure to the low temperatures governed
the use of low temperature steel. Second, a lack of redundancy
was desired in the design of the platform. And third, it was
most advantageous to use the high yield strength of the special
steels. It may be worthwhile to note that two grades of low
temperature steel are used, A and B. Grade A has been heat
treated by normalizing and Grade B has been heat treated by
quenching and tempering.

Grade B steel, the “tougher” of the two is used on all
external parts of the towers where the temperature may drop
to -40°F. Below the mean low water level Grade A steel is used
since the water temperature does not drop below 29°F. Besides
the submerged parts of the towers, pilings are also made from
Grade A steel. The reason for this is the fact that Grade A steel
has a higher yield strength; it is a lighter steel with a smaller
wall thickness. On the platform atop the tower, the type of

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER __ OCTOBER-NOVEMBEFL1969

steel used in construction is not so vital as it is in the tower
itself. For this reason, the decks are made of a somewhat lower
grade of steel than A or B i.e., A-36 and A-441.

Welding the components of the platform and tower
poses no special problems. It is most important that the weld
have the same resistance to brittle fracture as the base
material. To insure that the welding was done properly,
however, rigid metallurgical controls were enforced. The
materials to be welded were first preheated and the welding
rods were nickel-bearing rods. The most stringent part of the
welding process was the inspection. All welds were visually
inspected; all circumferential welds were X-rayed; and about
ten percent of the longitudinal welds were X-rayed. The
remaining areas and welds that could not readily be reached
were magnet-particle inspected.

As a final part of the fabrication of the tower, all joints
in the towers are stress relieved in an oven built especially for
this purpose. Stress relief is important in preventing brittle
fracture; it also improves the resistance to fatigue failure.
Thus, a double benefit is derived from stress relief after
fabrication.

Tower Installation

Once the tower is fabricated and the decks are
constructed, they must be transported to the location and
installed. This, as could be expected, is no small feat. In fact, it
is a very critical and problematical part of the entire operation.

The tower is constructed entirely onshore in an assembly
yard. Upon completion of construction, it is launched. After

43

launching, the structure is towed by tugboat to Cook Inlet
where it will be placed. However, the tower must be turned
over as it is sunk for it ﬂoats in a sideways position while
enroute from the assembly yard to the Inlet. Timing of the
operations in Cook Inlet is critical because high tides and rapid
currents may carry the tower away from its proposed site. All
construction work on site, thus, must be carried out during the
short period of slack tide as the current changes direction.

Upending the tower structure is shown in the figures
taken from the Journal of Petroleum Technology. The
operation is carried out at high tide to have maximum water
depth available so that the lower legs will not touch bottom
prematurely. First, the ﬂooding valves in the lowermost legs
are opened and after the legs are partly filled, the tower will
ﬂip to an angle of 36°. Next, ﬂooding valves in the upper legs
are opened as the lower-leg valves are closed. While water fills
the upper parts of the legs, the tower is rotated 90° in the
horizontal plane. If everything goes according to plan, the
tower should be at a 45° angle by the time the 90° rotation is
completed. The valves are regulated so as to gradually upend
the tower; when it becomes vertical, all the valves are opened
and the tower settles vertically to the bottom.

As could be expected, the tower will probably not set
level on the bottom. By jetting and air-lifting water from the
higher legs, the tower is leveled to within one foot. At this
point, two of the eight 36-inch piles are driven in each of the
tower’s legs and seats are welded to each. The tower is then

lowered by jetting until it sits level and is supported by the
pile seats. When all the piles are driven, the annular space
between the outer and inner shells of the legs are filled with
cement.
The Decks

Deck sections to cap the tower are completely
prefabricated and equipped at an onshore assembly yard. The
modules contain all drilling, production, auxiliary equipment
and compressors are installed and prepared for operation
before transportation to the site. The sections may weigh as
much as 400 tons and are set in place with two derrick barges.

Upon completion of the assembly on site, the tower’s
drilling rig is used to drill out the center of the 36-inch piles
cemented in the legs. Into these holes, the 24-inch piles are
installed. This technique not only saves a considerable amount
of expense by making it unnecessary to drill with ﬂoating
equipment, it also provides an opportunity for the operators
to check out the drilling rig.

Conclusion

Gigantic problems in offshore technology are made so
much more difficult by the harsh climate of Alaska’s Cook
Inlet. However, it is doubly important that workable,
economical, techniques be developed for recovering oil under
such conditions — first, to tap the vast supplies of crude that
lie trapped in the sediments beneath the inlet, and second, to
lay the groundwork in technology for oil recovery on Alaska’s
North Slope.

Creative people like John Gardner
see engineering as only one outlet
for their talents.

Among John's other concerns is today's
widespread shortage of technical talent.
Due in large part, as he sees it,

to children's lack of exposure to the
excitement of science.

John's doing something about it.

He's turned the Gardner basement into a
part-time laboratory, with almost-weekly
demonstrations and projects for
neighborhood kids. Where children as
young as seven make simple photoelectric
devices. Measure ballistic projectile
velocities. And explore subjects like
polarized light, fiber optics, and electronic
calculators, with the help of equipment
loaned by Xerox.

“My biggest delight,” John recalls, “was
seeing the first youngster’s face light up
when he gave his home-made electric
motor a shove, and it kept moving.”

“Children’s interests,” John maintains,
“should be stimulated early. Not by

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER _ OCTOBER-NOVEMBEF-1,1969

spoon-feeding answers, but by stimulating
them to question.”

As an Area Manager in our Advanced
Development Department, John asks——and
answers—some interesting questions of his
own. If you'd like to work for the kind of

A New Yorker was showing a Texan the many sights of
New York. When they passed the Empire State Building, the
New Yorker turned to the Texan and said, “That is the largest
building in the world.” The Texan replied, “Ain’t so much; in
Texas we’ve got outhouses bigger’n that.” The New Yorker
then cracked, “In Texas I guess you need them.”

The following is an excerpt from a freshman Chem II

notebook . . .

1. Select a frog at random.
2. Yell, “Jump, frog, jump.”
Result: 50 foot jump.
3. Cut off one leg.
4. Yell, “Jump, frog, jump.”
Result: 40 foot jump.
5. Cut off another leg.
6. Yell, “Jump, frog, jump.”

Seven engineers were rnarooned on a deserted island
with one girl. After two weeks the girl was so ashamed of what
she was doing she killed herself. A week later, the engineers
were so ashamed of what they were doing they buried her. A
week later they were so ashamed of what they were doing,
they dug her back up again.

Why won’t you?

I’m too tired.

Oh, come on.

I won’t be able to sleep.

Well I can’t sleep now.

Please!

Why . . . in the middle of the night?
Because I’m hot.

You get hot at the damndest times.
You don’t love me.

Yes I do.

If you loved me, you’d do it.

Well . . . all right.

What’s the matter?

I can’t find it.

That feels better.

It should be . . . it’s all the way up.
That’s enough, thanks dear.

Next time, open the window yourself.

***

Old timer: Son, do you have a fairy God mother?
Little boy: No, but I have an uncle we’re a little suspicious of.

***

Two men sat at the club and the one said, “Say, how is
that gorgeous secretary of yours?”

“Oh, I had to fire her.”

“Fire her! How come?”

“Well, it all started a week ago last Thursday on my 38th
birthday. I’ve never been so depressed.”

“What has that got to do with it?”

“Well, I came down for breakfast and my wife never
mentioned my birthday. A few minutes later, the kids came
down and I was sure they would wish me a happy birthday,
but not one word. As I said, I was most depressed, but when I
arrived at the office, my secretary greeted me with ‘Happy
Birthday,’ and I was glad that someone remembered.

“At noontime, she suggested that it was a beautiful day
and that she would like to take me to lunch at a nice intimate
place in the country. Well, it was nice and we enjoyed our
lunch and a couple of martinis. On the way back she said it
was much too nice a day to return to the ofﬁce and suggested
that I go to her apartment, where she would give me another
martini. That also appealed to me and, after a drink and a
cigarette, she asked to be excused while she went into the
bedroom to change into something more comfortable.

“A few minutes later, the bedroom door opened and out
came my secretary, my wife and two kids with a birthday
cake, singing ‘Happy Birthday,’ and there I sat with nothing on
but my socks.”

Once upon a time (1/t) pretty little Polly Nominal was
strolling across a field of vectors when she came to the edge of
a singularly large matrix.

Now Polly was convergent and her mother had made it
an absolute condition that she must never enter such an array
without her brackets on. Polly, however, who had changed her
variables that morning and was feeling particularly badly
behaved, ignored this condition on the grounds that it was
insufficient and made her way in amongst the complex
elements.

Rows and columns enveloped her on all sides. Tangents
approached her surface. She became tensor and tensor. Quite
suddenly, three branches of a hyperbola touched her at a
single point. She oscillated violently, lost all sense of directrix
and went completely divergent. As she reached a turning point
she triped over a square root which was protruding from the
erf and plunged headlong down a steep gradient. When she was
differentiated once more she found herself, apparently alone,
in a non-euclidan space.

She was being watched however. That smooth operator,
Curly Pi, was lurking inner product. As his eyes devoured her
curvilinear coordinate, a singular expression crossed his face.
Was she still convergent, he wondered. He decided to integrate
improperly at once.

Hearing a vulgar fraction behind her, Polly turned round
and saw Curly Pi approaching with his power series
extrapolated. She could see at once, by his degenerate conic

and his dessipative terms that he was bent on no good.

“Eureka,” she gasped.

“Ho, ho,” he said. “What a symmetric little polynomial
you are. I can see you’re bubbling over with secs.”

“O Sir,” she protested, “keep away from me. I haven’t
got my brackets on.”

“Calm yourself, my dear,” said our suave operator.
“Your fears are purely imaginary.”

“I, I,” she thought, “perhaps he’s homogeneous then.”

“What order are you?” the brute demanded.

“Seventeen,” replied Polly.

Curly leered. “I suppose you’ve never been operated on
yet?” he asked.

“Of course not” Polly cried indignantly. “I’m absolutely
convergent.”

“Come, come,” said Curly. “Let’s off to a decimal place
I know and I’ll take you to the limit.”

“Never,” gasped Polly.

“Exchlf,” he swore, using the vilest oath he knew. His
patience was gone. Coshing her over the coefficient with a log
until she was powerless, Curly removed her discontinuities. He
stared at her significant places and began smoothing her points
of inﬂexion. Poor Polly. All was up. She felt his hand tending
to her asympototic limit. Her convergence would soon be gone
for ever.

There was no mercy, for Curly was a heavyside operator.
He integrated by parts. He integrated by partial fractions. The
complex beast even went all the way around and did a contour
integration. What an indignity. To be multiply connected on
her first integration. Curly went on operating until he was
absolutely and completely orthogonal.

When Polly got home that evening, her mother noticed
that she had been truncated in several places. But it was too
late to differentiate now. As the months went by, Polly
increased monotonically. Finally she generated a small but
pathological function which left surds all over the place until
she was driven to distraction.

The moral of our sad story is this. If you want to keep
your expression convergent, never allow them a single degree
of freedom.

We’re looking for savvy engineers and scientists who have
wonderlust. Who want to know and like to dig. Guys with
the nerve to get a job done and an idea across. We’re look-
ing for men who are willing to explore for new customers
and new uses for the world’s most modern fuel. Or to ex-
plore the feasibility of using nuclear detonation to create
underground natural gas storage reservoirs. Or to develop
fuel cell systems to convert natural gas to electric energy.

We want men who feel the excitement of the pioneer and
who have engineering and scientific kn0w—how that can be
molded into sales, thermodynamics, energy conversion,
operations, applied research, long distance transmission
and distribution . . . almost any area you name.

If you’re our explorer, contact our Director of Placement,
Columbia Gas System Service Corp., 1600 Dublin Road,
Columbus, Ohio. Or write, wire or phone collect to the Di-
rector of Placement at one of the Columbia locations listed.

What CHEMICAL
ENGINEERS do at Kodak

Photographic coatings and proc-
esses must be designed to balance
perhaps seven critical diffusion and
reaction steps necessary to form a
color image in “chemical reactors”
as thin as l/l0,000-in.

In photography and beyond, we
work with surface diffusion of
chemisorbed species; rheology of
non—Newtonian ﬂuids; solid—phase
polymerization; high—temperature
vapor-phase pyrolysis; liquid—phase
air oxidations; desalting by reverse
osmosis; new ﬁber yarn conﬁgura-
tions. More general: design of pilot
plant and plant equipment from
laboratory data through mathemat-
ical modeling; drying operations
for ﬁbers, plastics, and chemicals;
viscous flow and heat transfer;
waste disposal and pollution con-
trol; on-line manufacturing prob-
lems; liaison with customers.

That’s the setup.
Pretty challenging, isn’t it?

If you’re a smart senior, you’ll sit down and write a letter
about yourself and your interests to Eastman Kodak Com-
pany, Business and Technical Personnel Department, Roch-
ester, N.Y. 14650.

If you’re an even smarter senior, you might do exactly
the same thing but enjoy it more because you understand the
situation better. You focus on the parental generation’s idea
of what’s challenging. You ﬁnd the challenge they tell you to
look for. That way you work yourself into position to decide
for yourself what really needs doing in the world before you
turn into an old-timer yourself. Present annual sales rate:
approaching $3 billion; present work force: 110,000.

In Rochester, N.Y., we make photographic and non-photographic products. in Kingsport. Tenn., our Tennessee
Eastman Company makes ﬁbers, plastics, and industrial chemicals. In Longview, Tex., our Texas Eastman
Company does petrochemistry. and in Columbia. S.C. our Carolina Eastman Company has a

ﬁbers plant. All in all. an equal-opportunity employer offering geographical stability for those who want it.

  

Why would

any good
engineer

. go to work
in a factory.

That’s sort of like asking why a banker goes to
work in a bank.

A guy goes to work where the best work is.

And some of the best engineering work around today
is in and around factories.

What would you say to designing the numerical
control system for an automated steel mill?

Or developing quality control procedures for the
world’s most powerful airplane engine?

Or managing a production team responsible
for delivering power generation equipment
to utility customers?

And what would you say to a General Electric
program that puts you right to work on jobs like those?

We ﬁgure if you’re ready for our Manufacturing
Management Program, you’re ready for that kind
of responsibility. Right from the start.

So our program packs about ten years of manu-
facturing experience into about three years of work.
And the work will take you all around the country.

Ask GE’s top management people what they
thought about starting out in a factory. Many will tell
you it was the best decision they could have made.

And where will you find those managers today?
Running our factories, of course.

Opinion . . .

What Ever Happened to

the SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER Engineer?

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

Now that you have read the jokes, eyed the technicutie,
ﬂipped through the ads and articles and maybe even noticed
the recruiting calendar, you have decided (for want of
anything better to do, surely) to learn what rnind-boggling
revelations the editorial contains. None I fear. Nothing on
Vietnam, racism, sex, Pitt Football or ROTC accredation. I
want to say something about the SKYSCRAPER and Pitt
Engineers. Disappointed right? Here goes anyway.

Many years ago (1951 A.D.) a group of ambitious and
unapathetic engineers felt a need for some means to
communicate among themselves and with other engineers.
They thought and thought and suddenly, one cried, “Let us
publish a magazine with all the things that engineers like to
read in it!” They thought and talked some more and decided
that it could work and be fun besides, so they produced the
first SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER. It had many less pages than
this one, with no girls, no color, not much advertising, and
very clean jokes, but, engineers were communicating and those
who worked on the staff found great satisfaction in their
work. The quality of SKYSCRAPER steadily improved and it
won not a few awards.

The SKYSCRAPER you are reading is no award winner.
This particular issue is at least three weeks late in printing and
its content is spectacularly less than what should be. There’s
not much communicating going on in these pages and
presently, it seems there won’t be any in the next issue either.

Apparently, Pitt Engineers don’t see much here but a
couple laughs and a pretty girl. If that’s what SKYSCRAPER
is then this should be the last issue. Other magazines have
prettier girls and funnier jokes if that’s wha_t you want.

It’s remarkable how unenthused engineers are about
joining the SKYSCRAPER Staff. (Note the white space on
page 3.) When asked to join (volunteers are scarce) most
answer that they don’t have time to participate in such extra
activities. “I’ve got too much work.” Engineering school is a
lot of work but, four years of just doing problems makes Jack

a dull boy. How dull are you?

. A Celanese career

free_dom_,
satisfaction,
reward,

We feel you should settle for nothing less than the professional opportunity
that offers you the most satisfaction and reward. A career in which you can be
yourself. Do your own thing.

Naturally, that takes a bit of planning and equipment on your part. Like a
degree in chemistry, chemical, industrial or mechanical engineering. Or accounting.
Plus a degree of imagination. Ambition. Responsibility. A little self-discipline.

With them, you'll find the professional climate excellent at Celanese. For some
very good reasons.

We're big. But not too big. More important, we're still actively young and
growing. In the past ten years, or so, our sales have almost quadrupled.

And we won't tie you up with long, formal training programs.You’ll learn as
you practice your profession. Reap the rewards of performance—not on age, or how
long you've been with us. Of course, you'll be working with experienced pros. So,
when you need a hand you'll get it. Because it's to our mutual advantage to have
you grow as fast as you can —and go as far as you can.

Your Placement Officer can tell you more about careers at Celanese.

And about our developments in chemicals, fibers, plastics, coatings and petroleum
products. Or write to: John B. Kuhn, Manager of University Relations, Celanese
Corporation, 522 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y.10036.
