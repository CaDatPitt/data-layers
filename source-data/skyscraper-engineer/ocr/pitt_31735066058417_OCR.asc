FIT YOURSELF IN

\/Vith Engineers V\7eek just around the corner, most of the de-
partments are hard at work on their displays and social events.
The committee has been working for many weeks to make this an
Engineers Week never to be forgotten. This can be done only
with the full cooperation of everyone in the schools of Engineering
and Mines. If you have not already been approached to help in
some way, why not see either the men who are Working in the
individual departments or those who are hard at work trying to
make the symposium and the high school open house a great suc-
ces? They will welcome any support that you, the indvidual
student, give them. Each job that must be done for the success
of the week, no matter how small, is just one more piece that
fits into the giant jigsaw puzzle that makes the celebration what
it has been and what it will be, now and in the future. The
E 8c M Association is running the week this year and they have a
big job cut out for them. Botl1 you and the Schools as a whole
will benefit from anything that you do to help make Engineers
'Week a great success. Try to fit yourself into the giant puzzle.

 
 

GOODBYE

Each semester it is the unpleasant duty of the editor to say
goodbye to the staff members who put in much time and toil to
make the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER the fine magazine that it
is today. The staff this year has done a tremendous job on an
entirely new idea in engineering college magazines. They each
deserve a hearty vote of thanks not only from the Editor but from
every one of you who work our puzzles, laugh at our jokes, or
read our articles. ,These men are; Thomas Bundorf, Bob Airhart,
Lou Luberti and last but not least, last year's editor, Jim Fallon.
Fellows, we thank you for all your help and the school also thanks
you for making the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER one of the finest
engineering college magazines in the country.

THE
ALUMINUM INDUSTRY

WAS BORN ON
 V In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company-

located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of
 Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.

The men of this company had real engineering abilities and

viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers . . .
leaders . . . men of vision.

- A lot has happened since 1 888. The country . . . the

company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new

territories have become states, for one thing. The total

industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people-

and the little outﬁt on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
bigger, too—and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
ALUMINUM COMPANY or AMERICA . . . but it's still the
leader—still the place for engineering “firsts”.

As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a
dynamic company like Alcoa—for real job stability

and pleasant working conditions—where good

men move up fast through their association with
the recognized leaders in the aluminum industry.

tells graduate engineers . . .

O “Worthington was my choice,” Mr. Berger says, “be-
cause of the excellent training and the unusual experiences
that are possible with a manufacturer having a worldwide
reputation, and worldwide distribution. Then, when a
company has seventeen divisions, including air condition-
ing, refrigeration, turbines, Diesel engines, compressors
and pumps of all kinds, construction machinery, and
power transmission equipment, a graduate engineer’s
chances for getting into his chosen field are even better.
“Supporting these divisions are-research, engineering,
production, purchasing, and sales, domestic and export.
The real opportunity, however, is in Worthington itself.
This is a company that is growing, just as it has for more
than a century. It is always looking for new, related

“I began my career with Worthington’s training pro-
gram in the Research and Development Laboratory, where
full-scale equipment is designed, tested and improved.
This experience gave me an understanding of the tremen-
dous part the company plays in the everyday life of mil-
lions of people. Within fourteen months I was sent to
Mexico to inspect the facilities of our distributors there.

“The opportunities for ﬁrst-hand laboratory experience,
sales training and contact, travel and ﬁeld trips, among
many others, make Worthington a f irst-rate company for
the young engineer with a desire to learn and progress in
his work.”

When you’re thinking of a good job, think high—think

T116 happiest and highest paid engineer is one
who is intensely interested in his work, and there is
no sorrier sight than one who lacks enthusiasm for
his life's work.

Now that you are an engineering student, did you
ever ask yourself why you are taking the specific
course of engineering in which you are enrolled? If
not, you should do so soon. You may be surprised to-
learn that your interest can become more spontaneous
in another field once you are familiar with its scope.

I shall never forget a student who told me he
was taking metallurgical engineering at his father's
request. He said he really wanted to become an
undertaker and he was encouraged to go to a school
which taught this subject. You will be interested to
learn, however, that he soon returned and graduated
with an intense interest in metallurgical engineering.

Did you enroll in your specific branch of en-
gineering because of a chance remark, or because you
know some one in that branch. or did you hear that
salaries and opportunities were greater in that branch?
Did some one say that you had a “mechanical mind”
(whatever that is) and therefore you should take
mechanical engineering? These are not sufficiently
sound bases on which to launch your life’s work.
You should become acquainted with the scope of the
other fields so that you are certain of your choice.

Do you know the accredited fields of engineer-
ing? The following is a complete list together with
the courses offered by your University. All of these
courses are thoroughly accredited by the Engineers’
Council for Professional Development, the national

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Dr. G. R. Fitterer

Have you seen our brochure published by THE
SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER describing each of these
fields? If not, one may be obtained from my office.

If you are a freshman, you are now in the best
position to transfer into another field if you so disire,
since the courses are the same for all engineering
freshmen-. If you are a sophomore, transferring to an-
other department may result in the loss of some cred-
its, but it still should be done if your interest becomes
transferred to another field. After the sophomore
year it becomes increasingly difficult to transfer as
you accumulate credits, but many students have trans-
ferred as late as the senior year.

Many engineers are not particularly interested
in advanced degrees and often think that because of
the fact that they do not have a 1.5" quality point
average their edcuation must stop. However, with
some 26 credits, a second Bachelor of Science degree
may be obtained in another field of engineering.

There are some excellent new fields of engineer-
ing developing between electrical and mechanical
and metallurgical, metallurgical and chemical, mining
and metallurgical. mining and civil, etc., so that
Bachelor of Science degrees in two fields are often
highly desirable. It is also possible that if your quality
point average is increased above 1.5 in obtaining the
second Bachelor of Science degree you may be ad-
mitted to the Graduate School for advanced degrees.

An engineering graduate with a 1.8 quality point
average or better will obtain consideration for en-
trance to the Medical School. Many of our former
engineering students are now M. D's.

The national enrollment is down to an alarming
degree in ceramic, metallurgical, and most of all in
mining engineering. The opportunities in these fields
are proportionately high, but since they are not as
well known by the public, enrollment is low.

Know yourself — — a life time is a long time!

Iaondon, January 5, 1944. A shrill scream pierced

the air followed by an explosion. As the dust settled,
an unearthly silence enveloped the city. Perhaps this
stillness was symbolic of many more phenomena to
come, for little did the citizens of London realize
that the scream, the explosion and the desolation were
the world’s premiere of guided missle warfare.

The History and Development

This first successful missle, known as the V-2,
was a product of years of research and development
by German Scientists. Ten years before the first
London robot bomb raid, Dr. Wernher von Braun
designed the grandfather of the V-2, the A-1. Dr.
‘Von Braun, who worked on the A-l purely for scien-
tific progress, never had imagined that Hitler would
turn the rocket into a weapon of destruction.

Running on liquid oxygen and gasoline, the A-1
impulse rocket engine developed a thrust of 660
pounds for 16 seconds. However, because it was used
as a test stand for rocket motor design, it never rose
into the air. With applications of the data derived
from the A-1, the A2 was developed. In 1934, the
A-2 was capable of reaching an altitude of 6500 feet.
Because the rocket achieved a height of slightly more
than a mile, it was no longer a secret project. For this
reason the German army arranged movement of oper-
ations to Peenemunde, an island in the Baltic Sea.

The first Peenemunde rocket was the A-3. which
was much improved over the A-1 and the A-2. The
liquid-fuel motor powering the A-3 gave a thrust of
3300 pounds for a 45 second period. A test rocket

fired in 1938 reached a altitude of 40,000 feet, and

when fired at an angle, it had a maxium range of 11
miles. The results of the 3 fired in 1937 were a well
anticipated power plant reaction, but the guidance
and control system was a failure.

Next in line was the A-4, which could be built
only after more testing data had been gathered. In
order to secure this vital information, A-5, a one-half
scale model, was used for testing equipment and con-

speaks from experience when he says . . .

“United States Steel
offers first-rate opportunities
in research and product development”

JOHN BAUSCHER graduated from col-

lege in 1943 with a B.S. degree in
Metallurgy. After a stint in the Navy,
he returned to college as a metallurgi-
cal research assistant. In 1949 he re-
ceived his M.S. in Metallurgy and
then came to work at the U.S. Steel
Applied Research Laboratory. After
just four and a half years, Mr.
Bauscher had progressed to Division
Chief for Sheet Products Develop-
ment—responsible for the improve-
ment of present sheet steel products
and the development of new and im-
proved types.

Why did Mr. Bauscher choose U.S.
Steel? Because, says he, “US. Steel
produces such a great diversity of
products and maintains such a thor-
ough research program on all its prod-
ucts — not only theoretical research,
but also applied research or product

has unusual latitude in selecting the
type of products and the type of re-

done not only on steel, but on many
raw materials and by-products as well.

“And,” says Mr. Bauscher, “Oppor-

“T” Ford, much time and effort were undoubtedly
put into the details of such intricacies as keeping the
line supplied with parts in the proper sequence. At
that time, however, the assembly line was rather slow
moving and the operations performed along it were
fairly simple. Since then, our assembly lines have be-
come so complex that it takes more men to operate
one line than Ford had in any one plant. How is it
possible for a present day line to operate at a speed

ful of men back in 1913 when assembly line tech-
niques were inaugurated into the automobile industry.

The production planning and control of an or-
ganization may have any name, but we shall call it
that. This department has two main subdivisions, the
planning group a11d the control group. In the plan-
ning group the overall production plans for a coming
period are discussed, analyzed, and altered until a
conclusion is reached which appears to be econom-
ically sound considering the estimated market con-
ditions, available facilities, and the dealers or cust-
omer’s orders. The planning group must initiate
action in two main areas. They are: routing, that is,
establishing the times when materials will be proces-
sed; and stores. which is supplying raw ‘materials or
semi-finished parts. As applied to a mass production
shop, routing is important when studying the plant
layout, because, once the machines and operations are
set on the assembly line there is no chance of chang-
ing them without a temporary halt of production.
Therefore, once a routing sheet has been set up in-
cluding such data as the department and machine
number, standard time factor of each operation, and
the estimated rate of production, the planning group
does not need to be concerned about routing until
new products or other changes are introduced. In
the mass production shop, scheduling is also a funct-
ion which_ will be set by the pace of the_machinery
once it is in operation. However, the planning group
must arrive at a master schedule showing the estimat-
ed production rate by departments or assembly lines
and the times that operations are to be performed
at each work station. When management has ap-
proved this master plan, then interplant releases are
initiated showing shipping dates and quantities re-
quired by production plants in time to meet schedules.
The scheduling section receives from the control
group progress reports which it must compare with
the schedules to determine if adjustments are are
necessary in order to fulfill the over-all schedule. The
stores section is responsible for keeping inventory
records, requistitioning material when supplies reach

Production.

the re-order point, and seeing that the proper amount
of material is kept at the stock banks and delivery
conveyors. The key to efficient planning is in the
control of stores, because if minimum inventories
can be kept with maxium turnover, then management
can operate at higher rates of production with lower
overhead costs. With these three main subdivisions
routing, scheduling, and stores, the planning group
of the production planning and control department
accomplishes the following four chief functions:

1. Careful analysis of the complex relationships
of ‘flow system’ production in advance.

IQ

Successful synchronization of time factors and
actual receipt of materials and parts as required
by the production schedule.

3. Schedule adjustments by the planning group to
compensate for various elements of change.

4. Control of costs through properly planned com-
binations of resources, in the sense of control
over inventory.

The supervisors of the production planning and
control departments are charged with the actual man-
aging of daily production by directing the move-
ment of materials and instruction cards to the line.
It has two subdivisions with which to maintain this
control. The dispatching section accomplishes the
movements of material, orders and instruction cards
while the follow-up section checks on deviations from
the established schedule. Daily summary sheets show-
ing individual items produced and ‘material used,
are one of the tools by which dispatching excercises
control. Another device is the “daily status” sheet,
which shows the overall daily production of items in
comparison with the planned production. It is the
dispatching section's job to see that all departments
and vendors concerned are informed of the time and
sequence in which the material and parts are to be
delivered to the main assembly line. The control of
the productions, as assigned to the control group of
the production planning and control department,

THE SKYS-CRAPER ENGINEER

Anyone who ever stopped to wonder just how his
automobile didn’t come off the assembly line with
a blue body and green fenders will have some of his
questions answered in this article by Howard Nimick.
The author tells just how the average maker con-
trols every step taken in the production of millions

of new models every year.

I

can get very complex and the consideration of an.
example from the automobile industry will point out
some of the intricacies of the system.

Since the assembly lines work as a unit and any
change in production will be deflected throughout
the lines, it is important that all operations be dom-
inated by synchronzation and uniform flow of mater-
ials. A typical example of this will be based on the
following facts. First, the body production rate will
be considered the key factor and hence sub-assembly
must be coordinated with the rate of body production.
Secondly, the final assembly schedules for each mon-th
are determined from quotas made up from dealer’s
orders showing each car ordered. Each of these units
will have an instruction card showing the specificat-
ions of the order relating to it. Since the automobile
industry is one of the most modern industries in the
country, naturally they will use the most modern de-
velopments. Therefore a group must be included who
work on tabulating machines to set up punched cards
to take information from sets of punched cards.

The first step in performing the control function
is to assign to each order, received from the dealer,
a separate punched card, which shows all specificat-
ions relating to the vehicle and which controls all
action taken on the order until the vehicle is shipped.
The tabulating cards are then coordinated with a
tentative car building schedule set up by the plan-
ning group. From this coordination, marking sheets
are prepared which show exactly which units will be
built. Next, the tabulating group punches shipping
order numbers and general routing information (ie.
truck plant. auto plant, tractor plant, etc.) on the
cards while also checking duplication of shipping
numbers. To determine each days production, the
cards are now checked against summaries of the mark-
ing sheets. These steps are all taken a week in ad-
vance of the actual production date because the plan-
ning group is on a seven day over-all car building
schedule. Naturally this procedure may take place
ten days, fourteen days, or any amount in advance,

JANUARY l955 19

depending on what schedule the planning group is
following. But in any case, the first step in forming
uniform flow and synchronization is planned well in

Since it is already established that the body pro-
duction is the key factor, the next step in control
coordinates the body plant with other assembly lines.
After the cards have been checked, they are made
up in sets and sent to the body plant and the control
section. At the body plant. a body listing is made up
on the basis of the cards received by the assembly
plant, becomes the most important record of control
for both the body plant and assembly plant. From
the body listing, metal tags for each car scheduled
are prepared which later become a permanent part
of the bodies and serve as indentification on registrat-
ion and owners cards. The body listings now serve
as instruction sheets sent to all stations in the body
plant showing sequence to vehicle bodies to be pro-
duced. Schedules made up from these body listings
show all details as to the body trim, paint and cor-
respond exactly with the original dealer’s order.
Back in the tabulating section, final assembly in-
structions, sometimes called teletype track sheets, are
prepared which show details of each assembly for
each day and are then forwarded to the control section
of the final assembly line. This control center is also
furnished with body listings and now has track sheets
and punched cards for every item sent to the body
plant. These cards and sheets have identical numbers
to those on the cards sent to the body plant so that
when these numbers are matched up complete details
of final assembly are available. The cards, listings
and sheets as mentioned sound a bit confusing and
repitious, but they are necessary for the control group
of the production planning and control department
to make sure that proper coordination between the
body plant and the assembly line exists in order that
the dealer’s orders are precisely followed and that
production maintains the planned schedule. Does it
still seem possible that some green fenders might slip
in front of the blue ones on the feeder line and
end up on the blue sedan? An investigation of the
communication between the control section and es~
sential stations along the assembly line should answer
the question.

This last step in performing the control function
is generally carried out by the dispatching section.

Even small items such as adiusting headlights are taken care of on the
final assembly lines.

The frame rolls to the engine station on the assembly line where it soon
has a power plant lowered into final position.

This step will indicate the importance of having rapid
communication in order to have the most effective
performance throughout the plant. In this case, bodies
are transported by truck in a matter of minutes to a
point on the final assembly line. Since the body plant
is the key factor, a teletype message is sent from there
to the control section of the assembly plant giving the
code numbers of the bodies on route to assembly.
Immediately, the control section lines up the corres-
ponding track sheets and punched cards and broad-
casts the proper information by teletype to all stations
on the final line. Again, when each body is received,
the control section broadcasts essential information
to all stations. Now each station knows what mater-
ials to start on feeder lines and their proper sequence
is designated by the track sheets. All feeder lines are
synchronized so that each component arrives at_the
proper place in the proper order at the correct time.
Thus synchronization is perhaps the most important
and intricate part of the final assembly. The preface
set down earlier that production must be dominated
by synchronization and uniform flow of materials is
now seen to be the chief element that eliminates the
possibility of a costly mix-up between components.

The Outstanding Senior this semester is R.
Thomas Bundorf, a mechanical engineer from Con-
nellsville, Pa. Tom, who maintained a quality point
average of 2.65, was quite active in extracurricular
activities. Some of these were: layout editor and
make up editor for the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER,
member of the Pitt Foto Club, Vice Chairman of the
student chapter of the A. S. M. E., and Chairman of
the M. E. department's Cider and Doughnut party.
During Engineers Week last year Tom became a
Knight of St. Patrick for his Work to,make the week
a success. Last spring Tom edited the special high
school supplement of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER,
copies of which are distributed to all prospective Pitt
engineers.With all these activities and his high grades,
Tom still found time to work at the Engineering Re-
search Division of the University and has been em-
ployed there for eighteen months.

 

One of the Honorable mention awardees for the
Outstanding Senior award this semester is Lester C.
Snyder from the Civil Engineering Department. Les,
who has a quality point average of 1.671, has been
very active in the affairs of the Civil Engineering
department. Although his college career was interupt-
ed twice by military service, he still has spent much
of his time working on activities. something that many
veterans neglect. He has spent five years and nine
months in the service. Les is President of the student
chapter of A. S. C. E. and A. R. B. A., and was assis-
tant editor of the student newspaper of the Civil
Engineering department. He was also very active for

A Campus-to—Career Case History

“Always something new”

“Different types of work appeal to different
men,” says Donald O’Brian (A.B., Indiana, ’50) ,
in the Trafﬁc Department with Indiana Bell Tele-
phone Company. “For me, I’ll take a job that
keeps me hopping. And that’s just the kind of
job I have.

“You’d think that after two years I’d have all
the variables pinned down. But it doesn’t work
that way. When you supervise telephone service
for thousands of different customers whose needs

are always changing, there’s always something
new coming up.

“I started with Indiana Bell in 1952, after
two years in the Army. My training program
exposed me to many different kinds of tele-
phone work—customer contact, personnel, ac-
counting, operations. I saw a lot of jobs which
looked as interesting as mine. As much as I
like what I’m doing now, I bet I’ll like my next
spot even better.”

Don’s enthusiasm for his job is pretty typical of how

most young college men feel about their telephone
careers. Perhaps you’d be interested in a similar oppor-
tunity with a Bell Telephone operating company, such
as Indiana Bell . . . or with Bell Telephone Laboratories,

HIGH SPEED FILM

The Eastman Kodak Company
has announced the introduction of
a new, high speed, roll film — —
Kodak Tri-X.‘The film is approxi-
mately twice as fast as the com-
pany's current Kodak Super-XX
Film, and is intended for amateur
and professional use.

Its speed makes possible picture
taking indoors with existing light
and relatively simple cameras.

The new film will be available
in 35mm, 4X5 film pack, and 620
and 120 roll film sizes.

Considerable over or under-ex-
posure can be tolerated and excel-
lent prints still obtained. Improved
tone reproduction and shadow de-
tail are also possible with the film.

Light noise instead of light output is being checked by this illuminating
engineer to help TV and movie producers improve sound quality.

BIG EYE DEVELOPED

One of the world's largest and
brightest searchlights, capable of
throwing its beam approximately
120 miles, has been produced by
the Westinghouse Electric Corpo-
ration at Cleveland, Ohio.

The huge light, containing a
2500 watt short-arc mercury-vapor
discharge lamp, will develop 275,
000,000 candlepower. It has a re-
flector five feet in diameter, stands
more than 11 feet high and weighs
1200 pounds.

Originally used as an antiaircraft
searchlight during World War II,
the light was modified by the ad-
dition of a rotating base construct-
ed of aircraft steel and aluminum
capable of withstanding l'00-mile-
an-hour gales. A small, one-sixt.h
horsepower Westinghouse motor
will drive the light as it revolves
at a rate of 12 revolutions per min-
ute from dusk to dawn.

NEW METHOD
SIMPLIFIES WELDING

A new method of welding that
eliminates skills normally required,
and claimed to be as easy as turn-
ing on a light swich, promises to
make it possible for the rapidly
growing number of home fixit
yourself and hobby craftsmen to
work with metals as readily as the
wood. It is expected that the meth-
od will also be useful to users of
metal equipment and machinery
that occasionally need a quick, easy
method of repair or maintenance
fabrication. The Lincoln Electric
Company of Cleveland, Ohio, has
developed the new method, called
SELFWELD.

Selfwelding is said to eliminate
the difficulties that would be en-
countered normally by the amateur
in learning the skill of manipula-
ting the welding elctrode and con-
trolling the arc. The electrode
and holder normally do the Work
required of the person welding.

  

How to heat shock loads
in a big dragline

Imagine the shock loads put on this big dragline’s
intermediate swing shaft when the cab, the boom
and an 8-yard load of dirt being swung through the
air are suddenly stopped and the direction reversed!
Engineers solved this problem by specifying
Timken® tapered roller bearings. Timken bearings
not only take radial and thrust loads in any combi-
nation, they also assure long, trouble-free operation.

   

Why T|MKEN® bearings have
high load capacity

This cross section of a Timken tapered roller bearing
illustrates one reason why Timken bearings do such a good
job under heavy load conditions. Notice that there is full
line contact between the rollers and races. It’s this full line
contact that distributes the load over a wider area, gives
Timken bearings their extra load-carrying capacity.

hearings or ioh opportunities?

Some of the engineering problems you'll face after

The necessity of good communication is what enables
the control section, by use of track sheets and punch-

vehicles produced and the specifications peculiar to
each. Consequently, our producers get the proper

Though this is but one example of a control

The reader should realize that within the production
planning and control department of a company there
are generally two divisions; namely, the planning
group and the control group. Within the planning
group the functions of routing, scheduling, and stores

are carried out. But production cannot be carried on
by planning alone, so control is exercised through
dispatching and follow-up. There is no set organi-
zation, operational procedure, or portfolio of forms
to be followed; but instead, the company must deter-
mine its own needs and tailor its department around
these needs. Whether planning and control are done
by one person, as in the job order shop, or by a Whole
department, as in the mass production industries,
every business has some sort of control system, recog-
nized as such or not. Since this is a generally accepted
truth. every business should make the best use of the
system in order to benefit by its advantages.

MORE POWER
FOR RADAR

A powerful new radar height-
finder is being made by the Gene-
ral Electric Company for the Air
Force to strengthen defense net-
works of the United States. G. E.
engineers say the radar’s energy,
concentrated in a narrow beam like
that of a searchlight, detects planes
three times as far as previous units
of this type. Exact range is classi-
fied. The radio energy transmitted
by the radar is so powerful that it
can light fluorescent lamps over a
hundred feet away, and can ignite
flashbulbs tossed into the air im-
mediately in front of the antenna.

The radar height-finder is being
used together with search radar to
detect high-flying aircraft and to
provide information on distance,
altitude and flight direction.

VISIBLE FEEL
MICROMETER

An Indicating Micrometer pro-
viding “VISIBLE FEEL” to the
user and having a range from O-l”,
reading in .0001” has been annouc-
ed by the George Scherr Company,
Inc.

The indicating mechanism con-
trols the measuring pressure so that
all uncertainties due to differences
in “feel” of individuals are elim-
inated. The “Master Compar” In-
dicating Micrometer really offers
what its name implies, namely a
Master-Micrometer and a Compar-
ator combined in one instrument.
In addition, this tool provides the
user, due to its ingenious resign,
with a complete set of Go and No
Go Gages of one inch range, read-
ing in .0001”. A most important
feature is that it detects Out-of-
Roundness, Ovalness and Taper.
The fact that the release button
for the movable anvil is on the
RIGHT HAND Side makes it a
RIGHT HAND TOOL, enabling
the operator to hold it the con-
vential way.

Radically new is the Resetting to
Zero which is accomplished by
means of a screw on the bottom of
the housing and can be done accur-
ately in less than 5 seconds. Heavy
tungsten carbide anvils and finish-
ed hardwood case are standard e-
quipment. Larger sizes up to 4"
are furnished with removable in-
dicator.

V-2 Rocket

Continued from page 17

velopment of new manufacturing and storing tech-
niques. One of the main constituents of a great mass
of decomposing peroxide was steam, which was used
as a reacting mass in the A-5.

The A-4, now known as the V-2, was designed at
Peenemunde in 1938 and 1939. It was to be more
than twice as long as the A-3. with fifteen times the
take-off weight. It required many calculations, sket-
ches, drawings and much experience, most of which
could be gotten from the A-5. The planned dimen-
sions for the V-2 were: length 46 feet; diameter, 51/2
feet; take-off weight, more than 12 tons with a 1 ton
warhead. The motor, with a thrust of 25 tons, was
expected to raise the rocket 150 miles. The finished
rocket, however, was longer, heavier. and had a
considerably longer range.

The first V-2, fired on July 6, 1942, rose only
three feet from the ground and then exploded vio-
lently, destroying the testing station. The next two
behaved in exactly the same manner. The first suc-
cessful launching did not take place until October,
1942, when V-2 number 4 covered a horizontal dis-
tance of 170 miles. A-2's number 6-18 were failures.
Some exploded in mid-air or on the ground; some
broke in two during flight; some just failed to take
off. Number 19 performed perfectly. In the next 100
test rockets, there were only 20 failures.

Considering its massive size and weight, the V-2
required little in the way of take-off equipment. For
the purpose of firing, the V-2 rested on a firing table
consisting of a large steel ring supported by four legs
built into the fins. The table was placed on a twenty
foot square of concrete, or any other hard surface.
In emergencies, the Germans hardened the bare soil
by spraying it with liquid oxygen, which froze the
soil moisture. In Holland, some V-2’s were fired
from city streets.

Fueling of the V-2 began after the rocket had
been placed on its firing table. After the control
system was set, the alcohol tank was filled with 75 per
cent alcohol and 25 per centwater fuel. The auxiliary
fuels for the pump turbine were then loaded. Finally,
just before firing, the oxygen tank was loaded with
liquid oxygen. After the rocket was fueled, it was so
heavy that a 60 mile wind would not affect it. No
firing was done in such a wind, of course.

During fueling, the electrical equipment inside
the rocket was running on an external power source,
either from a generator truck or, in some war-time
cases, from city power lines. This external power
source, which was fed through a cable held by a mag-
netic clamp, was disconnected at the last instant be-
fore take-off. Once the rocket was in flight it gener-
ated its own electric power.

The firing of an A-2 was executed in two stages.
In the preliminary stage, the rocket was ignited elec-
trically. Then the fuel valves in the rocket were
opened, so that alcohol and liquid oxygen flowed by
gravity to the rocket motor, where they burned. This
stage produced seven tons of thrust, not enough to
raise the rocket, which weighed more than twice that
amound. If the fuels burned properly at this stage,
the auxiliary fuels were fed to the turbine pump as-

ble tracks of a streetcar. The cars
in both directions run at equal
intervals from each other. Every
three minutes a car passes him.
What is the interval at which they
leave the end of the line?

. If it takes a bicyclist four minutes

to ride a mile against the wind
but only three to return with the
wind at his back, how long will
it take him to ride a mile on a
calm day?

. Two fathers and two sons leave

town. This reduces the populat-

CHESTERFIELD
BRA INBUSTER

The brainbuster this month
is to find the largest four-
digit number that equals the
square of the sum of the two
two-digit numbers formed by
its first and second, third and
fourth numerals, -respectively.
Have fun!

A carton of Chesterfield
cigarettes will be given to the
first person who submits the
correct answer to the secre-
tary in the office of the Dean
of Engineering. Have her
mark the time that the answer
is received. Members of our
staff are not eligible to par-
ticipate in the contest. Only
one answer per entry will be
accepted. The answer to last
month’s BRAINBUSTER —
was 3.141592653589793238462
643383279 — the number of
letters in each word. Gordon
N. Fleming, ‘58, Physics De-
partment, was the winner.

9. A rather long number ends with

an 8. If this figure is shifted to
the front position we obtain twice
the original number. What is the
original number?

10 Is the number l,000,000,000,00l a
‘ prime number or not?

ANSWERS

It will drop for the following
reasons: While still in the boat,
the cobblestones displace an a-
mount of water equivalent to
their weight. Immersed, how-
ever, they will displace an a-
mount of water equivalent to
their volume,which is less, since
cobblestone have a higher spe-
gravity than water.

The correct figure is 5,734.

V-2 Rocket

Continued from page 35

sembly which pumped fuel to tl1e rocket motor. In
the three seconds that the turbine took to reach full
speed, the rocket reached the main stage. Thrust
built up from seven to twenty-seven tons. The water'-
fall-like noise of the rocket rose beyond the limits
of the human ear. Tl1e rocket lifted slowly, traveling
a little less than its own length in the first second, a
little more in the second, and so the speed built up.
At the end of every second, the rocket moved some
thirty-five feet per second faster than at the end of
the previous second.

During 1943, Dr. Von Braun had gone to see
Hitler at his headquarters at the eastern front. He
took with him rolls of film documenting the research
done. Apparently both Von Braun and his films im-
pressed Hitler a great deal, for he immediately order-
ed mass production of the V-2. At the same time,
Hitler’s intelligence staff reported mass troop con-
centrations in the British Isles. An immediate bom-
bardment was planned with hopes of not only de-
stroying buildings and fortifications but also playing
an important part in breaking the stout—hearted spirit
which held the population together.

During the campaign, which lasted seven months,
the Germans fired at least 1300 V-2’s at London, and
forty or more at Norwich. Of those fired at London,
518 landed on their target. None hit Norwich. There
were 5809 people seriously wounded while 2511 were
killed, most of whom were largely women and child-
ren. Hitler's pet rocket porject had cost the German
government 75 million dollars, but Der Fueherer’s
reign of terror was soon to end.

Perhaps the last Peenemunde project was the A-9
and A-10 “Amerika Rocket”. The A-9 was nothing
more than a A-2 with a stubby pair of sweptback wings
welded onto the hull, transforming it from a ballistic
rocket to a high speed glider. When the fuel was ex-
hausted and the rocket descended into the atmosphere
the wings would help it glide for increased range.
The German designers hoped for a 500 mile range.
The A-1 was to have been used in comb-ination with
the A-10, making a monstrous 100 ton trans—Atlantic
two stage rocket. Plans had been laid for the use of
this “Amerika Rocket” as a bombardment weapon
and the target had already been selected. The aiming
point was near Broadway, midway between the twin
clusters of giant skyscrapers which stand as the unique
hallmark of the world's largest city. It was marked
on a document found in Goering’s files after V-E Day.

Following the war, the United States Govern-
ment, realizing the possibilities for guided missiles,
secured all possible German data and equipment.
The Kremlin. thinking in the same manner, impound-
ed all available test apparatus found in their zones
of occupation. However, before the end of the war,
the American and British chiefs-of-staff had Peene-
munde heavily bombed. Thus, the Russians had
nothing but rubble at this island in the Baltic; how-
ever, it has since been reported that Peenemunde has
been completely rebuilt.

The rocket born in hopes of scientific progress
and reared as a child of war may someday become the
parent of interplanetary travel.

from Donald C. Burnham, Vice-President

Westinghouse Electric Corporation

   
     

To the young engineer with a creative mind

America is on the threshold of the automation am.

New automatic machines with their electronic brains are
opening the way to a tremendous industrial development in
which machines will largely replace man’s routine brainwork
and handwork.

Westinghouse is taking a leading part in developing equip-
ment for the automatic factory. At our new Columbus, Ohio
plant, refrigerators move along 27 miles of automatic conveyors,
with many parts being installed by automatic assembling
machines. . .refrigerator controls are automatically calibrated...-
automatic testing devices maintain quality control. . . and the crat-
ed refrigerator is automatically conveyed to warehouse storage.

You can BE SURE... u= n"s

At Westinghouse, young engineers like you are playing an
increasingly important role in such new developments for all
kinds of industry. Here, there is plenty of room for your creative
talents to expand—in designing new products . . . and in
developing new improvements for existing products. It’s a
fascinating job that offers you real opportunities for growth.

And at Westinghouse, we recognize individual ambition as well
as technical ability. There will always be a place for the young
engineer who wants to forge ahead. For professional develop-
ment you can do graduate work toward Master’s and Ph.D.
degrees in 19 universities. You will be treated as an individual and

Westinghouse will do all in its power to help you reach your goal.

ization in Toronto.

Chairman Wayne DiBartola has
announced that preparations are
underway to prepare a display to
represent A.S.M.E. during Engin-
eers Week this spring. The project
will pertain to Mechanical Engin-
eering and will be on display in
the M.E. section at Thaw Hall.

The association includes along
with its other activities, field trips,

1916—The ﬁrst Boeing plant, Seattle

1954—Boeing’s Seattle plant as it appears today. New Engineering Building is shown in foreground.

ls career stability important to you?

Then the chart below will be of interest.
It shows that 46% of Boeing’s engineers
have been with this company for five
or more years; 25% have been here 10
or more years, and 6% for 15 years.

mm: 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%

 

One reason for this stability is that
Boeing has grown steadily for 38 years,
providing plenty of room for advance-
ment. Another reason is the highly in-
teresting type of work at Boeing, such
as designing and building America’s ﬁrst
jet transport and the revolutionary B-47

40

and B-52 jet bombers, as well as work
on pilotless aircraft, supersonic flight
and research in nuclear—powered aircraft.

Still another reason is this: Boeing
always has put dominant emphasis on
engineering development. Pioneering in
this field has meant that Boeing con-
stantly has increased its engineering staljf
in relation to total employees. Fifteen
years ago, one out of 16 employees was
in engineering. Five years ago the pro-
portion of engineers had been raised
to one in ten and today it has climbed
to one in seven.

Boeing has rewarding openings for
engineers of EVERY category——electri—
cal, civil, mechanical, aeronautical and

related fields, as well as for applied

physicists and mathematicians with ad-
vanced degrees.

Careers at Boeing aflord a wide vari-
ety of experience in research, design and
production, as well as work with new
materials and techniques, and contacts
with a cross section of industry through
Boeing's vast subcontracting program.

Boeing promotes from within and
holds regular merit reviews to assure in-
dividual recognition. Engineers are en-
couraged to take graduate studies while
working and are reimbursed for all tui-
tion expense.

chance to serve an apprenticeship as a tool and die
maker, and earn money, but I learned what I wanted
to do after graduation.

course in 1948, I knew what I liked and seemed best
ﬁtted to do. As a result, my entire time as a GTC stu-
dent was spent in the shops.

“The 18 months spent in the foundry, erection ﬂoor
and machine shop have all proved valuable background
for my present job.

“As supervisor of plant engineering at the Norwood
Works, I am concerned with such problems as: Plant
layout, material handling equipment and methods, new
construction, new production methods to be used in
building motors, centrifugal pumps, and Texrope
drives. It’s an extremely interesting job.

“From my experience, I’d say, whether you’re a
freshman or a senior it will pay you to talk to an Allis-
Chalmers representative now. You can’t start plan-
ning your future too soon. And you can’t plan starting
at a better place, because Allis-Chalmers builds so many
different products that you’ll ﬁnd any type of engi-
neering activity you could possibly want right here.”

  
 

Facts You Should Know About the ALLIS-CHALMERS Graduate Training Course

‘I. It’s well established, having been
started in 1904. A large percentage of the
management group are graduates of the
course.

2. The course offers a maximum of 24
months’ training. Length and type of
training is individually planned.

3. The graduate engineer may choose the
kind of work he wants to do: design, en-
gineering, research, production, sales,
erection, service, etc.

Steam turbines, condensers, transformers, switchgear,
regulators are built for electric power industry.

4. He may choose the kind of power,
processing, specialized equipment or in-
dustrial apparatus with which he will
work, such as: steam or hydraulic, turbo-
generators, circuit breakers, unit substa-
tions, transformers, motors, control
pumps, kilns, coolers, rod and ball mills,
crushers, vibrating screens, rectiﬁers, in-
duction and dielectric heaters, grain mills,
sifters, etc.

5. He will have individual attention and
guidance of experienced, helpful superiors

in working out his training program.

6. The program has as its objective the
right job for the right man. As he gets ex-
perience in different training locations he
can alter his course of training to match
changing interests.

‘lho Bevier Memorial Engineering library on the seventh ﬂoor of the

new engineering building has many features that will make it one of
the finest equipped technological libraries In the United States.
People, people ond more people.

Bevier Memorial Library

At long last, the Schools of Engineering and
Mines will have a library of their own. The seventh
floor of the new engineering building has become a
certainty through the generous gift of Dr. George
M. Bevier, who received the Doctor of Science degree
at the University of Pittsburgh in June, 1937.

Dr. Bevier is an independent consulting geologist
who lives in Alpine, Texas, and has been very suc-
cessful in the oil industry.

As shown in the photograph, the library will be
provided with considerable natural lighting and the
entire atmosphere will be extremely pleasant and
conducive to quiet study. The librarian will be in
control and will be provided with many different
and new types of facilities; e. g., a book lift will be
provided which will convey books from a room on

the fourth floor to the library floor. On the fourth
floor will be stacks of books which are not so fre-
quently used and in addition, adjacent to the room
on the fourth floor will be an auxiliary study hall
which will be provided with individual stalls of booths
for quiet study only. Students on the fourth flooor
will be in Contact with the facilities on the seventh
floor library as well by means of the book lift. The
operation of the engineering library will be through
the University library system so that all libraries in
the University will be able to supply books to the
Bevier Memorial Library. In addition, the University
is a member of the Pittsburgh Library Association
so that practically any book on technology available
in Pittsburgh will be available to Engineering and
Mines students. Additional space has also been pro-
vided for current periodicals.

solutions to operations problems.

Today, The Glenn L. Martin

basic to leadership in any organization:

Because steel is stronger, more

invited to visit the Allison POWERAMA in Indianap-
olis, Indiana.

What is it? The POWERAMA is a permanent ex-
hibit which dramatically presents the story of pio-
neering and progress in power.

You can spend hours in the big display room and
enjoy every minute of it. For instance . . .

You’ll see a model test stand where a miniature
turbo-prop engine and Aeroproducts propeller are
put through simulated tests.

Or, you can push a lever and start a model jet
plane on its ﬂight and see how much-fuel is required
for take-off and ﬂight.

Too, you can sit in a bucket seat and actually put
a General Patton tank through its paces on a giant-
sized turntable.

There are dozens of moving and “talking” dis-

plays . . . displays like the working model of a
portion of the Allison bearing plant——the world’s
only fully automatic steel-backed bronze bearing
foundry.

These few highlights give you an idea of the scope
of the POWERAMA. Class groups or technical so-
cieties especially are invited to schedule a visit to
the POWERAMA. Requests should be made in writing

It takes a delicate touch and years of experience to master
the art of formulating and processing certain types of
steels . . . like those used in ﬁne cutlery, clock springs and
TV magnets. These and hundreds of other specialty steels
must be tailored to ﬁt their ultimate use. For example, the
cold rolled alloy steels needed for cutting such everyday
items as bread, meat, paper, shoe leather and fabrics have
to possess special qualities not found in ordinary steels.

For 54 years Crucible has been the ﬁrst name in

The Denver and Rio Grande Western

minutes, cuts running schedules,
saves costs in train idling time.

You don’t ﬁnd a Rio Grande freight idling at the
terminal while waybills are copied by hand. In-
stead, Recordak Microﬁlming copies them. Then
they’re put aboard and the train is off in just
about one—ﬁfth the time it used to take, thus sav-
ing hours of valuable crew and train time. Then
the wheel reports are made up from the ﬁlms and
teletyped ahead.

Railroading is but one of over a hundred types of
businesses now saving money, time and space with

microﬁlming. It is one of the fast growing and widely
used ways photography works for industry.

Small businesses and large are ﬁnding that photog-
raphy helps in simplifying routine procedures, in
product design, in personnel relations. It improves
production, saves time and cuts costs.

Graduates in the physical sciences and in engi-

tool in their new occupations. Its expanding use has
also created many challenging opportunities at

Advanced Production Techniques and
Experience—l50 Years of It—Are Doing
Big Things with Pressure Vessels

Although established in 1802, Scaife Company never has
allowed itself to “grow old.” A unique combination of
engineering skill, production experience and modern
equipment—coupled with Scaife’s intensive research pro-
gram—has resulted in many signiﬁcant accomplishments
in the manufacture of pressure vessels for air, gases and
liquids. For example, one of the most interesting methods
of cold-forming metal in use in this country today is the
Scaife Reverse-Draw Process, a revolutionary method of
forming deep-drawn shapes.

We invite engineers to contact our PersonneIDirector
for information about the opportunities with the
Scaife Company.

The Scaife Reverse-Draw Process

Shown above are some of the deep-drawn
shapes that may be made by the Scaife
process, and the press employed for the
pressing operation. This is how it is done:

 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  

Starting with a circular
sheet of steel-

a cup is formed by a con.
v_ennonal drawing opera-
tion.

A continuation of this
Dressing operation turns
the cup “inside out" with-
out removing it from the
dies-

com leting—-in a single
stro e—the deep-drawn
shape.

The Torrington Needle Bearing
is designed for high radial loads

The many lineal inches of contact
provided by the larger number of
small diameter rollers give the
Torrington Needle Bearing an
unusually high load rating. In
fact, a Needle Bearing has greater
radial capacity in relation to its
outside diameter than any other

type of anti-friction bearing.

Precision Manufacture
and Unique Design

The exceptional load capacity of
the Needle Bearing is the result
of proper selection of steels, pre-
cision workmanship to close tol-
erances, and the application of
modern anti-friction principles.

The one-piece shell, which
serves as the outer raceway and
retains the rollers, is accurately
drawn from carefully selected
strip steel. After forming, it is
carburized and hardened. There

is no further grinding or other

The full complement of thru-

rollers is retained by the turned-

in lips of the one-piece shell.

The small cross section of the
Needle Bearing allows a large
shaft which permits a rigid design
with minimum shaft deﬂection, a
factor of utmost importance to

good bearing design.
