CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA 0 ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO - HAWAII

BY HOWARD WESOKY, AE '52

Would you believe your ears if someone told you
that automobiles might be replaced in the not too dis-
tant future by a vehicle which would move down high-
ways using the same principle that now propels vacuum
cleaners across living room carpets? Well, this is the
idea that engineers as well as amateur inventors all
over the world are proposing to us today. The prin-
ciple that today propels many vacuum cleaners and
might someday replace the wheels of the world is
really quite uncomplicated. The vehicle, most com-
monly called an air sled, would move on a cushion
of compressed air blasted d ow n by a propeller.
The air sled would be supported by the cushion of air
in the same manner as a ball is supported by a jet of
water. The comparison between the air sled and a vacu-
um cleaner is even more appropiate. The Hoover Con-
stellation vacuum cleaner blows exhaust air out under-
neath its canister, actually floating the canister a frac-
tion of an inch off the floor. Due to its friction free
movement, the cleaner is easily moved across the floor
with just a gentle push or tug. The air sled could
carry incredibly heavy loads using a minimum of effort
by its propulsion system due to this air—bearing, friction
free, principle.

A number of small models of air sleds or ground ef-
fect machines are now being flown at various places
in the United States. The ground effect machines now
under study generally use an annular jet of high speed
air. or a labyrinth seal to trap air under the machine.
T_hese seals increase the lifting effect of the ground

10

cushion considerably. Exact benefits of the annular
jets and labyrinth seals are not yet known because of
a lack of systematic quantitative data that could not
be made available except at considerable e x p e n s e
through a coordinated research program. Until such a
program is completed, it would be impossible to say
exactly what type of ground effect machine would be
most economical and practical. However, enough data
has been obtained to indicate that the lifting capacity
of certain machines can be increased several hundred
times when they stay near the earth and operate con-
tinuously within the ground effect. This represents a
maj-or improvement over conventional helicopters and
airplanes which experience a lift increase of only 10%
to 20% when they enter the ground effect.

Most of the work being done in the United States
is private, but some of it is being done in government
laboratories operated by the Navy, Army, Air Force
and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Almost all of the present research being done is in the
form of testing concerned with stability problems for
the performance of annular jets and labyrinth seals
have proven more complicated than originally predict-
ed. Many arrangements are being tried on the models
in an effort to produce an inherently stable configuira-
tion. There are three basic types of machines using
the -ground effect principle which are typical of present
thinking. The first type is a small size STOL vehicle
which discharges air around the periphery of its wing
in an annular jet. This annular jet increases the strength
of the -ground cushion and reduces ground friction.

The second type, a ground limited, very close to the
ground, very large size (several hundred feet in dia-
meter) vehicle uses a labyrinth seal to maintain a high
pressure cushion of supporting air under the machine.
The labyrinth seal is a series of small grooves under-

neath the sled. Propellers inside each groove pump air
up to be bounced down again. In -this way, most of
the air is trapped beneath the sled, continuously being
recirculated, and not much leaks out past the edge of
the sled. This vehicle has been proposed in England
and Switzerland as a 100 miles per hour replacement
for the ocean liner. This idea would make the -great
port cities of the world obsolete, for deep water harbors
would no longer be needed. Wide beaches, gently slop-
ing, would be natures own docks for big freighter air
sleds. In Britain, Saunders-Roe (the airplane makers)
are now test flying the SR-NI Hovercraft, a 30 foot,
450-horsepower two-seater, before starting work on
large commercial channel ferries. Over in Switzerland,
Carl Weiland, one of the originators of the air sled
idea, is sailin-g a 33-foot four seater on the lake at
Zurich. Research on the large machine is also being
done in the United States. The basic purpose of the
very large ground effect machine is to materially in-
crease the surface speed of ships. Major problems con-
nected with this machine at present are the lack of
complete engineering data on the labyrinth seal and
insufficient loads data for large circular structures
which might be forced down in a heavy sea. Another
use for the large machine might be transportation on
the vast icy plains of the artic region.

A third type vehicle is a small size machine com-
parable to a truck. It would use annular jets and ride
four to five feet or more above the ground. The power
to weight ratio would have to be much higher in this
small vehicle than in one much larger because of its
relatively high distance above the ground for its small
bottom area. To propel and guide these machines
along the ground, a second engine would be used to
push back or the air blast from a single engine would
be divided with ducts. Anticipation of a lar-ge commer-

Among the American companies developing ground

a large cavity or plenum chamber and its lifting force
is obtained by keeping a pressure of less than 1 lb. per
square inch in this chamber. A propeller of about 4 ft.

maintain chamber pressure. Curtiss-Wright has already

vehicle is called, is 21 feet long, 8 feet wide and weighs
2800 pounds with 4 passengers and a full gasoline load.
Suspension of the air car is accomplished by maintain-
ing approximately 1/10 lb. pressure per square inch
under the vehicle augmented by a deflection membr-ane.
The low pressure, low velocity air is also used for pro-
pulsion, and is capable of propelling the vehicle in any
direction. Populsion air is also used for braking. The
Air-Car is inherently stable, and can be operated by
anyone who can drive an automobile. The operator
does not have to “fly” the vehicle. The controls are
used only for movement in any direction and braking.
However, don’t expect to see an Air-Car gliding -through
traffic for a while yet, for Curtiss-Wright offers the
vehicle to “qualified” purchasers for testing only. The
Ford Motor Co. version of the air sled is really the
simplest. The vehicle has flat pads underneath, each
with high pressure air whistling out a hole in its center.
This creates a thin film of pressurized air under the
pads, enough to hold the vehicle up off the surface.
But to support reasonable loads with reasonable air
supplies, the clearance between pads and surface must
be very small, around .025 inch. That means the sur-
face has to be very smooth, preferably a rail. The idea

is proposing is a jet propelled train. It would ride on a
thin film of air underneath pads that fit around a
standard rail. Ford has much confidence in the future
of its vehicle since considerably less power would be
required for its “levapad” equipped vehicles than is
needed to move present day vehicles at speeds above
150 miles per hour. In comparison with a modern 4
engine passenger plane with a take off weight of 50
tons, aground effect machine requires much less power.

only 4300 h. p. would be required to operate the air
sled at 400 m.p.h.

As has been stated previously, the theory behind the
air sled is relatively uncomplicated. In fact anyone can
build a working model of an air sled with just a model
airplane engine and a child’s snow coaster. It will glide
beautifully across a flat surface. However, there are
still hundreds of technical problems to be solved before
air sleds can be expected to provide everyday transpor-
tion. There are a few big stoppers which are especially
worrying engineers. Forward speed of the sled may
blow its supporting air cushion right out from under it,
dropping the machine to the ground. Most aeronautical
engineers believe that in one way or another the air
cushion can be maintained and tests presently being
carried out in wind tunnels will more than likely prove
these engineers correct. I

THE REALM OF ZERO

Interesting facts about the phenomenon of superconductivity.

Materials undergo strange physical changes when
they are cooled to temperatures approaching absolute
zero, or minus 273 degrees centigrade. One of the most
unusual of these changes occurs in the electrical char-
acteristics of some metals. These metals, usually poor
conductors at normal temperatures, suddenly loose all
their electrical resistivity. This phenomenon is called
superconductivity.

Superconductivity was discovered in 1911 by Kamer-
lingh-Ommes, a Dutch investigator of the behavior
of matter at very low tempertures. After using liquid
helium to produce temperatures below 10 degrees Kelvin
in mercury, he then passed an electric current through
it. He found that at 4.22 degrees K all the resistance
to the How of the current disappeared. Since then, it has
been found that twenty-one metallic elements and a
large number of alloys become superconducting at low
temperatures. The transition temperatures (tempera-
tures at which the metals become superconducting) are
characteristic of the particular metal and vary from as
low as 0.35 degrees K for hafnium to above 8 degrees K
for noibium. Physicists today are still hunting for an
explanation of this bizarre phenomenon, which seems
to contradict some of our basic ideas of nature.

When a ring of metal is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld,
cooled to below its transition temperature and an elec-
tromotive force induced in it, a current will be produced
in the superconductor which will persist almost indeﬁn-
itely without any change in its strength as long as super-
conductivity remains. This phenomenon occures be-
cause the resistance of the superconductor is zero. Only
two conditions are necessary for this existence of a
persistent current in a superconductor: (1) The super-
conductor must be a doubly connected body, or briefly,
a ring; and (2) No part of the ring can leave the super-
conducting state. Should any part of the ring leave the
superconducting state, the persistent current is quenched
almost instantaneously, and its energy is transformed
into heat in the normally conducting wires.

It has also been discovered that a number of external
agents influence superconductivity. If a magnetic ﬁeld

DECEMBER 1959

is applied parallel to the length of a long superconduct-
ing wire, the resistance of the wire is suddenly restored
at a deﬁnite ﬁeld strength which depends on the metal
concerned; this ﬁeld is know as the “critical ﬁeld.” The
restoration of resistance is, however, abrupt only if the
metal is perfectly pure and free- from strains and if
the current used for measuring the resistance is vanish-
ingly small. The absence of impurities and strains is
particularly important because these slightly change the
critical ﬁeld and consequently different regions of the
specinien may have different critical ﬁelds if impurities
or strains are present; therefore, the transition is blurred.

An interesting consequence of the existence of a criti-
cal magnetic ﬁeld is that there is also a critical strength
for the current flowing in a superconductor. Once the
critical strength is exceeded the resistance is restored in
the superconductor, and the temperature rises rapidly
due to the great amount of heat being produced by the
resistance to the electromotive force. Under certain. con-
ditions for certain metals, the conductor may even melt
SUPERCONDUCTIVITY OCCURS in certain metals when
temperatures approach absolute zero. The purpose of this

type of research is to learn why certain metals permit
electric currents to apparently flow forever.

u

due to the inability of the cooling apparatus to remove
the excess heat quickly enough. The effect of a current
restoring the resistance is due to the magnetic ﬁeld
which is produced.

The zero resistance of a superconductor is also modi-
ﬁed at very high frequencies of alternating current. Up
to 10 million cyc./sec. the resistance is still zero within
experimental accuracy, but for one billion cyc./sec. there
is a considerable resistance even below the transition
temperature.

By experimentation it has been found that the pro-
perties of superconductors could be divided into two
groups: (a) Properties which do not undergo a change
in the superconducting transition, and (b) Properties
which do undergo a change in the superconducting
transition. The more important of these properties
will be summarized in following paargraphs.

The properties which do not undergo a change in
transition: (1) The X-ray diffraction pattern is the
same both above and below the transition temperature,
which shows that no change of the crystal lattice is in-
volved. Also the change in the electronic structure is
very slight. (2) There is no appreciable change in the
reﬂectivity of the metal, either in the visible or the infra-
red region, although the optical properties are usually
closely connected with the electrical conductivity.

Properties which undergo changes in the transition:
(1) In the pure superconducting state practically no
magnetic flux is able to penetrate the metal, which thus
behaves as if it had zero permeability or a strong dia-
magnetic susceptibility. Because of this, specimen shape

heit.

plays an important role, and when superconductivity
is destroyed by a magnetic ﬁeld the magnetic behavior
becomes complicated for any shape except that of the
long cylinder parallel to the ﬁeld. In such circum-
stances the specimen breaks up into a mixture of super-
conducting and normal regions known as the intermedi-
ate state. (2) All the thermoelectric effects disappear in
the superconducting state. (The thermoelectric effects
are heat or light caused by the electromotive force flow-
ing through a resistance in a conductor.

In more recent experiments, John K. Hulm and
B. T. Matthias began testing a large number of sub-
stances, hoping that they might see a pattern which
would identify some of the physical and chemical pro-
perties associated with superconductivity. They found
that the only substances which became superconduct-
ing were elements or compounds with an average of
between two and eight valence electrons per atom. And
within this range the materials with an odd number
of valence electrons per atom——three, ﬁve or seven—be-
came superconducting more easily (farther above abso-
lute zero). It had previously been known that super-
conductivity is favored by certain space in the crystal
(space not occupied by atoms). Hulm and Matthias
found that the most favorable crystal structure of super-
conductivity was the one called the beta—tungsten
structure——a cubic arrangement of eight atoms which
makes the crystal bulky, with considerable space be-
tween some of the atoms. Compounds with this struc-
ture and valence electron average between 4.5 and 4.75
per atom proved to be particularly disposed to becoming
superconducting.

Mathias and Hulm also discovered that it was possi-
ble to make a superconductor by combining two ele-
ments which by themselves are totally unﬁtted for this
property. A good example is a combination of silicon
and cobalt. Silicon, of course, is not a metal nor a con-
ductor of electricity. Cobalt has nine valence electrons
and is strongly magnet-ic. Yet when silicon and cobalt
were combined in a cubic crystal structure, they be-
came superconducting, because the silicon neutralizes
cobalt’s magnetism and reduces the average number of
valence electrons per atom to the appropriate range.

With the remarkable advancement in the ﬁeld of

superconductivity and readily available cooling appara-
tus for maintaining materials at the low transition
temperatures, we can begin thinking about putting sup-
erconductors to work. One possible application is the
ﬁeld of electronics. Superconducting computer elements
can switch up to 10,000 times faster than con-
ventional elements, and when used in computer mem-
ory systems can store ﬁve times as much information
permemory unit as present elements can. A super-
conducting device known as the “cryotron,” that may
replace even the transistor in aplications where space,
weight, and current must be minimized, has already
been developed. The engineer’s dream of unlimited ap-
plications of electricity in industry, in science, and in
every day living will someday become possible through
the practical application of superconductivity.I

For Pittsburgh’s new auditorium...

A"push-button umbrella rooi”ol Nickel stainless steel
...the roof design of tomorrow

Here's the ﬁrst of a revolutionary
new type of roof design, destined to
introduce a new concept in building.

A simple concept, but a daring one.
The domed roof of a building is
divided into eight sections which
nest together when opened. Push a
button, and six of these sections
glide quietly together around an out-
side track.

In Pittsburgh’s new all-weather
auditorium, the push-button
umbrella roof can be closed at the
ﬁrst sign of bad weather without
disturbing the show. In private
homes, a roof design like this could
bring the beauty of nature right into
the home.

18

But what material is lasting
enough for a dome like this? Archi-
tects and designers of the audito-
rium looked into all types of
materials. They selected Nickel-
containing stainless steel. They
selected Nickel stainless because it
has the best combination of proper-
ties for this purpose. For example
it is one of the most weather-resist-
ing, corrosion-resisting metals.

Naturally, this is just one example
of how designers are taking advan-
tage of the unique properties of
Nickel-containing metals. In the
future, however, you may be design-
ing a machine—not a spectacular all-

weather push-button roof. You might
need a metal that resists corrosion,
or wear, or high temperatures. Or
one that meets some destructive
combination of conditions. Here, too,
a Nickel-containing metal could be
the answer.

But, whatever your ﬁeld of study,
in the future you can count on Inco
for all the help you need in metal
selection. Right now, if you’d like to
get better acquainted with Nickel
Stainless Steel, why not write Inco

Melting Metals in Space

Electromagnetically suspended metals

are melted by radio frequency currents.

THE BELL JAR containing the sample to be levitated
is purged with an inert gas before the melting begins.
To the right of the Bell Jar‘ is the FLF. generator which
supplies power for the operation.

A SLUG OF ALUMINUM is suspended in the magnetic
field of the coils. After being melted, the metal is dropped
into the copper crucible below the coils.

BY TERRY PELTZ, Chem ’60

Melting metals in space by levitation is one of the
most phenomenal technical accomplishments ever devel-
oped in industry and research. Bodies of metal, natu-
rally heavier than air, actually become buoyant and
float in the atmosphere. Such a machine has been
constructed by the University of Pittsburgh under the
efficient guidance of Dr. Raymond C. Craig and Dr.
William E. Wallace. This machine, to be used exten-
sively by the Chemistry Department, suspends a solid
in space and melts it while suspended without a visible
means of Contact or support. This suspended melting
is of great importance in industrial, commercial and
experimental research because the metal touches no
crucible or container during the heating and draining
stages.

The levitation machine is versatile because it prevents
the more reactive high-melting point metals such as
Titanium, Zirconium, Vanatium, Tantalum and Moly-
bdenum from reacting with a crucible. These metals
have similar chemical and physical properties and will
even react with supposedly inert crucibles, such as
graphite, contaminating the metal with excess carbon
or other impurities. The heated or molten charge can
be protected by a suitable atmosphere, or a vacuum,
and volatile impurities can be -gradually distilled. Other
advantages of the machine are that the molten
charge can be drained gradually or dropped as a whole
and that the melt is thoroughly mixed electromagneti-
cally. Alloying additions can be made while the melt
is in levitation and the charge can consist of metal
powder. and alloying constituents mixed and sintered
together, or bound by a suitable binder.

The first to propose levitating molten metal was
Muck in October of 1923. But it was not until 1951
that levitation was finally realized when Westinghouse
Corporation developed the first levitation machine. By
1953 Scheibe had levitated 4-.5 centimeter diameter
spheres of several metals at 10 K.C., and gilbert levitat-
ed 1-10 gram samples of several metals in a protective
atmosphere at 100 K.C.

The basic theory of levitating metals can be explained
in terms of a single loop of wire. If alternating current
is passed through the loop of wire, a changing magne-
tic field is created in the vicinity of the loop. Of course,
this follows from one of the basic laws of electricity

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

 
 

that a changing electric field produces a changing mag-
netic field. When a metallic object is placed above the
loop of wire, and the force of the magnetite field is
sufficient to counteract the gravitational forces on the
object, it will then remain suspended. This magnetic
field will also induce an e.m.f. in the object. The result-
ing eddy currents are somewhat circular in motion
and dissipate their energy into heat. Thus, if the resist-
ance of the metal is low (highly _conductive) it will
melt slowly. Aluminum and copper‘ are good examples
of metals that will react in this manner. However,
there is a very marked disadvantage in using a single
loop of wire. The object drifts from the coil axis.

Westinghouse, in the development of the first levita-
tion machine, eliminated this problem by introducing
a second loop of wire. The loops are arranged in such
a manner that the currents in the two loops are in op-
position to one another. The lower coil supplying the
forces necessary to both levitate and melt the object.
The upper loop serving only to stabilize the object
during the entire course of levitatin-g.

One of the later stages of development was introduced
by the University of Pittsburgh. It is noted that the
lower portion of the coil has several turns of tubing
all in a clockwise direction and at the top of the coil
there is a turn in the reverse direction. Thus, the only
difference is that the University of Pittsburgh intro-
duces several turns in place of the single loop used by
Westinghouse. It should also be noted that the coil is
made of a hollow tube. Since the coil becomes very hot
during a levitating process, the need for cooling the
coil becomes apparent. Water is then passed through
the hollow tubing. The bottom of the coil is open to
allow for casting of the object after the melting process
is complete.

Every metal that is ferromagnetic can be melted in
the machine. The largest piece of metal which can be
melted in present machines is approximately 1/2 ounce
in weight and 34 inch square. The metal is placed
between the two coils, or within the cone, and the
power is turned on to the desired amount necessary to
suspend the metal object. The metal assumes the shape
of a top when melted, vigorous stirring occurs and
there is a tendency to rotate, which can be suppressed
by introducing some axial asymmetry. A modification
in the coil form prevented the molten from draining
through the bottom of the coil. Each five grams of
metal become molten in approximately 30 seconds and
is mixed by the stirring effect of the induced eddy
currents.

When powdered metals are used, they are either
packed and then inserted in the machine or a hole is
drilled through the center of a metal slug and
the other powder inserted. The two metals are then
placed into the machine, suspended, and when the
metal is melted the other one is dropped into the molten
zone. By adjusting the current in the coils, the molten
metals can be dropped into a copper mold which cools
within seconds without contamination. The copper mold
has a high specific heat and will not melt readily.

DECEMBER 1959

DR. L. V. CHERRY, Research Associate in the Chemistry
Department, levitates a sample of aluminum. The white-
hot metal can be seen suspended in the coils.

When metals such as aluminum are heated in air,
an oxide coat forms. Therefore, the heating element
must be covered with a Bell jar, and an inert gas, such as
helium, can be injected to prevent oxygen from being
absorbed into the specimen which can cause unsatisfac-
tory results. A magnetic adapter is used to drop the
desired alloy into the magnetic field while within the
Bell jar enclosure.

Heating of levitated specimens depends upon the
power available, coupling between primary circuit and
specimen, frequency, eddy currents and heat losses from
the specimen. High frequency power of 10 kilowatts,
AC 450 kilocycles (just below radio band), 1000 volts,
300-400 amps is needed to create the magnetic field.
The highest temperature which may be used is not
known, but it is approximately 2000° Centigrade. The
rate of temperature rise could be controlled by varying
the magnitude of the alternating curent. A condenser
unit is also used to make the frequency of the machine
and that of the coil agree.

Due to the minute size of the metal that can be melted,
this machine at the present time is restricted to research
work where a small mass of metal is desired for experi-
mentation. The levitation machine’s purpose is mainly
to make pure alloys of reactive metals. This is of great
importance in heat treatments, although commercial
and industrial alloys may not be of high purity, the
investigation of a system uncomplicated by traces of
impurity is a desirable starting point. Any combination,
with even the slightest impurity, can have adverse af-
fects on results]

Economists

Not many years ago, engineers were leaders in a
movement called “Technocracy”. The basic principles
of the movement were:

(1) Social phenomena are measurable and laws of
social control may be derived from these measurements.

(2) The application of the machine to the production
of goods and services has made it possible to measure
the value of the goods produced in terms of any single
commodity (gold, for example) and thus the engineer
had destroyed the price system.

(3) The expansion of credit, sometimes termed the
creation of debt, under the capitalistic system has dis-
turbed the relative claims of capital and labor to the

goods produced to such an extent that the capitalistic

system has already collapsed.

(4) The economics of the social order are too com-
plicated to be understood by politicians. Control should
be placed in the hands of engineers and scientists.

While the movement is now mainly of historical
interest, it exhibits the impatience of the specialist with
those who appear to him to place roadblocks in the
way of effective performance of his task. Thus the
engineer in the plant thinks the accountantinterferes
with his getting on the job, professors are impatient with
university administrators, businessmen with labor lead-
ers, and everyone with politicians. ‘

It‘ is indeed a sorry situation when the materials,
workers and plants available for the production of
goods, a depression ensues causing extensive unemploy-
ment and under-utilization of other resources. Yet it
would be a vast oversimplification bordering on com-
plete dissociation from reality to suppose that the

necessary decisions c-an be made by the production-

specialist. While, of course, basic economic decisions
can be made without reference to their economic effects,
there is no reason to suppose that they can be made
more efficiently by ignoring economic principles, and
the contribution which the economist can make to pre-
dict economic effects.

To illustrate, let us briefly examine the so-called basic
economic decisions; The first is to decide what products

22

BY DR. RAYMOND L. RICHMAN

to produce. Are our plants to produce goods even if
people won’t buy them at prices which will cover their
cost of production? There are some goods that do fall
in this category, e.g. subsidized government housing.
The subsidizing is the result of a decision by legis-
lators. This is not intended as a criticism of public
spending. Professor Galbraith, in his book The Affluent
Society, justifies an increase in spending on health,
education, and other public welfare projects which he
asserts has virtues over some kinds of private spending.
However, most goods are made in response to con-

‘ sumers’ demand for products where there is no over-

riding public interest requiring subsidization. For these
goods to be produced in the long run requires that
consumers will be willing to pay the costs of production.
Deciding what goods should be produced is an economic,
political and social decision as well as an engineering
decision.

Closely tied to this first economic decision is the
organization of production, the allocation of labor and
capital to the production of the various goods wanted
and the choice of technology. This is partly an engineer-
ing decision, e.g., what goods can be produced at the

_ prices that consumers are willing to pay. But are these

resources to be allocated by an arbitrary system of labor
direction and rationing of capital? Resources are too
scarce to produce everything that is wanted, even too
scarce to produce everything which can be produced
and sold at a price covering their costs of production.
The value of some products is greater per unit of input
than in the case of other products. Choosing this. alloca-'
tion is only partly an engineering decision. The engineer
can predict the costs of producing each item in various
quantities, but the analysis of what quantities of each
goods are most valuable to the society is a social and
economic decision. In this area, economists can rightly
claim having made an important contribution through
the study of incremental or marginal changes.

Who should get the goods produced is a third basic
economic decision. An arbitrary system of rationing may
fail to achieve productive efficiency since the distribution

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

‘.1

-‘Y

of goods is one of the rewards, one of the incentives re-
quired by people to engage in production. What incen-
tives are necessary to obtain a high degree of productive
efficiency? What unequal distribution of income is made
necessary by the need to provide the necessary incen-
tives? These are not engineering questions, but economic
and psychological as well.

How much of your present production would consist
of capital accumulation to increase future production,
and how much should be devoted to research and devel-
opment? This basic economic decision, what to set aside
for increasing capacity to produce goods in the future,
is again partly an engineering decision but involves
also a decision of how rapid a growth we want, not
merely how rapid it can be. Also, there is the question of
incentives, our willingness to make present sacrifices for
future benefits. This is not a question solely for the
engineer or even primarily his, but one also for the
economist and the psychologist.

To return to the “Technocrats” who thought it impos-
sible to measure the value of goods in terms of any single
commodity, one must mention that money continues to
perform this service very well, and certainly one of the
major contributions of economists during the past three
decades has been to create a better understanding of the
function of money and of alternative monetary policies.
The monetary authorities have been greatly aided there-
by. It was formerly thought to be a prerogated concern
only of the specialists, the bankers, dealing with money.
But bankers have over the course of years proved them-
selves singularly incapable of understanding anything at
all about money.

Economics in product control "can mean the difference
between a prosperous or a depression ridden economy.

DECEMBER 1959

With regard to the first basic principle of the techno-
crats that social phenomena are measurable and laws
of social control can be derived therefrom, one cannot
take issue. If there were not regularities in social be-
havior which could be discovered, regularities which
lend themselves to statistical measurement or system-
atic observation, there could be no basis for scientific
work in the social area at all. Not all the laws of social
behavior have been discovered, and the economist
should be aware better than anyone of his limitations
and tentative character of much of the advice that he
offers. Still it is important to know what one does not
know, so that one is made aware of the chances he
takes in making economic decisions. In fact, one of the
areas in which great progress has been made lately in
economics, and which has been of great aid to engineers
as well, is how to deal with uncertainty. There are
many areas too in which the borderline between econ-
omists and engineers has been narrowing. The use of
linear programming in making production decisions,
the use of operational research techniques to make bet-
ter management decisions are joint contributions of eco-
nomists and engineers designed to make engineering
decisions better economic decisions. It is no accident
that some of the best faculties in economics have been
assembled in universities which are primarily technol-
ogical in their focus.

To summarize, the above discussion has served to in-
dicate indirectly what might have been said directly,
namely that many specialists are involved in making
economic decisions. The economists have chosen the
perspective of the welfare of the society to study the
indirect, unintended effects on the productive efficiency
of the economy of decisions by business managers, engi-
neers, politicians and consumers. The economist has
developed a set of basic prinnciples, theories and models
which are of value in making such decisions. It is very
important that such specialists in making their decisions
should be acquainted with the contribution that econo-
mics can make to them. To work together with other
specialists requires an understanding by each of what
the other can contribute. A sound knowledge of econo-
mics is required for this understandinng by engineers.
It is no accident that nearly all schools of engineering
now require the study of economics in their curricula.

It seems in order to close with a caution for econ-
omics, engineering and other specialists. With regard
to~.the technocrats fourth principle enumerated above,
that the economics of the social order are too compli-
cated for politicians to understand, one is tempted to
agree with the technocrats. But that would be over-
looking the fact that the politician is himself a specialist.
When he is a -good politician, he is performiing the valu-
able job of co-ordinating the specialists, of deciding
what is practicable from alternative policy recommend-
ations, of adjusting conflicting claims of diverse inter-
ests with the object of achieving the greatest net social
gain. Could the engineers and scientists (including the
social scientists) perform this specialized function any
better I

The field has never been broader
The challenge has never been greater

Engineers at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft today are concerned
with the development of all forms of ﬂight propulsion
systems—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and other advanced
types for propulsion in space. Many of these systems are so
entirely new in concept that their design and development,
and allied research programs, require technical personnel
not previously associated with the development of aircraft
engines. Where the company was once primarily interested
in graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering, it now also requires men with degrees in
electrical, chemical, and nuclear engineering, and in physics,
chemistry, and metallurgy. ‘

Included in a wide range of engineering activities open to
technically trained graduates at all levels are these four
basic ﬁelds-:

ANALYTICAL ENGINEERING Men engaged in this
activity are concerned with fundamental investigations in
the ﬁelds of science or engineering related to the conception
of new products. They carry out detailed analyses of ad-
vanced ﬂight and space systems and interpret results in
terms of practical design applications. They provide basic
information which is essential in determining the types of
systems that have development potential.

DESIGN ENGINEERING The prime requisite here is an
active interest in the application of aerodynamics, thermo-
dynamics, stress analysis, and principles of machine design
to the creation of new ﬂight propulsion systems. Men en-
gaged in this activity at P&WA establish the speciﬁc per-
formance and structural requirements of the new product
and design it as a complete working mechanism.

EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING Here men supervise
and coordinate fabrication, assembly and laboratory testing
of experimental apparatus, system components, and devel-
opment engines. They devise test rigs and laboratory setups,
specify instrumentation and direct execution of the actual
test programs. Responsibility in this phase of the develop-
ment program also includes analysis of test data, reporting
of results and recommendations for future eﬂort.

MATERIALS ENGINEERING Men active in this ﬁeld
at P&WA investigate metals, alloys and other materials
under various environmental conditions to determine their
usefulness as applied to advanced ﬂight propulsion systems.
They devise material testing methods and design special
test equipment. They are also responsible for the determina-
tion of new fabrication techniques and causes of failures or
manufacturing diﬁiculties.

A chemist, with his mind on his own specialty exclu-
sively, might say: “The chief raw materials for all

Dow products are sea water, brine, petroleum, coal, '

oyster shells.” Up to a point he would be right. But
in fact he would be overlooking the most important
ingredient of all—people of a certain exceptional kind
and quality of mind.

Let’s look at a quick proﬁle of the kind of person Dow
looks for. His mind and ambitions are not limited by
the dimensions of the job he is doing. His horizons
take in tomorrow, while he does his job well today.
Problems appear to him in a dynamic context of both
today and tomorrow. The “big picture” is not just a
cynical phrase to him.

This broader View makes him plan well—for his family
as well as for his job. As the phrase goes, he is “a
good provider.” He owns his own car. Chances are he
owns his own home. Along with some 80,000 others he

has invested in Dow stock because he believes in his

Saran Wrap*, Separan* for the mining industry, the
new ﬁber Zefran*, and others. Making things that do
some important job for the human community, better
than‘ it has ever been done before, gives him a real thrill.

Not everyone who works for Dow, whether at Midland
or the other 23 United States locations (plus 23 foreign
and 5 Canadian), ﬁts this proﬁle. But by and large
most of those who do well tend to. Though they have
more than their share of “creative discontent,” they
have found a good place to grow, and work out their
hopes, plans and ambitions.

M [ANGRY MEMUHJAL LECTURE

This is the second in a series of Langley
Memorial Lectures presented to the students
of the Schools of Engineering and Mines at
the University of Pittsburgh.

This lecture was given by Mr. John W.
Simpson on November 5, I959.

About
Samuel Pierpont Langley

Professor Langley taught physics and astronomy at
the University (then known as the Western University
of Pennsylania). He was also director of the Allegheny
Observatory, serving in this capacity for twenty years
from 1867 to 1887. During this time he attracted wide
acclaim for his writings and general contributions to
astronomy.

In 1866 Professor Langley became interested in a
work on the flight of migratory whooping cranes by Is-
rael Lancasted. The 52-year-old professor was instantly

fired with curiosity to find the secret of the gentle"

soaring flight of the great birds who could sustain
themselves for hours in a seemingly effortless position.

Realizing that the flight of these birds was dependent
upon a Newtonian Maxim which stated that the resist-
ance of a plane surface to the air varies as the square of
the sine of its angle of incidence, Langley began to ex-
pand his experiments and apply the principle to a
variety of surfaces.

The result of this study was the issuance of a physical
law by Langley which stated that Newton’s figures on
resistance were in error and that resistance was only
1/20 that stated by Newton. He further stated that
mechanical flight was possible with engines then in
existance.

Then, in 1889 Professor Langley was named secretary
of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D. C. As
a result of this position, Professor Langley was able to
secure funds to publish his writings on the heavier-than-
air flight. Also at this time Langley experimented with
hundreds of flying models powered by many engines of
various kinds.

He constructed a small, very lightweigh steam engine
which operated with a low power to weight ratio. He
worked long and hard on the development of suitable
wings to carry the aerodrome. By 1894- he was ex-
perimenting on a flying model which was launched
from atop a houseboat moored in the Potomac near
Quantico. The wings of the poorly-balanced model

were of silk, the framework of split bamboo. The fragile
nature of the lightweight craft required a dead calm
for launching, a situation rarely witnessed in the Vir-
gina winter. The launching catapult was tricky and
unreliable. These factors spelled immediate defeat for
the first four models shot into the cold air. One by one
the frail models strained at thecatapult with the force
of their tiny steam engines, and one by one they were
cut loose only to drop and sink beneath the waters of
the river.

In October, 1894, Aerodrome No. 5 was launched
and maintained flight of three seconds which covered
about 35 feet. The aerodrome weighed 22 pounds
“flying-weight.”

After much thought to the necessity of proper mo-
ments of rotation, a pair of tandem wings and a pair
of crossed planes for the tail assembly was decided
upon. The launching of No. 6, a 26-pound model which
looked like a dragonfly, was a failure and the crash was
attributed to a faulty launching. But the venerable old
man with his shirtsleeves rolled up stood on the bank
of the river and realized that his success was closer than
it had been for years.

Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, a close friend of Profes-
sor Langley and a man who knew the hardships of fruit-
less research, was present at the launching of the re-
built No. 5 equipped with tandem wings. The day was
May 6, 1896. Langley and Bell had just finished a final
check of the launching mechanism, the wings, the tail,
and the engine of the aerodrome. They stood on the shore
and looked out to the houseboat. Langley had been
through one of the most difficult winters of his life.
He had seen model after model collapse and sink.
Newspapers had called him a madman, quack and
dreamer. Through all the defeat he had retained his
belief that powered flight was attainable in his time.
Now Bell stood by, camera in hand, waiting to secure
positive proof. The white-bearded astronomer waited
until a few minutes after three and then shouted to the

ALLEGHENY OBSERVATORY was the place where Lang-

attendant on the houseboat, “Let her go.” Then he
held his breath.

The propellers whirrled madly, the tiedown rope was
cut, the aerodrome shot off the end of the catapult,
dipped toward the water and then, to the shock and
suprise of Langley, Bell and morbidly curious onlook-
ers on the banks of the Potomac, it began to rise slowly
in long graceful spirals. In the shouting and confusion,
Bell forgot to take his historic pictures and hugged
Langley excitedly. He later told reporters that he saw
tears on the old man’s cheeks. =

The aerodrome remained airbornes for 1 minute, 20
seconds, attained an altitude of between 70 and 100
feet and covered 3,000 feet. Immediately after the model
was recovered safe and sound from the river, it was
relaunched and flew again for 2,300 feet. A rebuilt
No. 6 was launched in November of the same year and
flew 4,200 feet at about 30 mph.

Professor Langley’s curiosity had been satisfied. His
principles had been proved. He stated publicly that the
success of Aerodrome 5 and 6 marked the end “of the

-;

work which seemed to be especially mine—the demon-
stration of the practicability of mechanical flight—and
for the-next stage, which is the commercial and practi-
cal development of the idea, it is possible that the world
may look to others.” ~

In July, 1898, Gen. Adolphus W. Greely, chief of the
United States Army Signal Corps, was sent to Smith-
sonian by President McKinley to request that Lang-
ley build an aerodrome suitable for combat duty.

By the summer of 1903, the tandem-winged aero-
drome, with a wing span of 118 feet and an overall length
of 52 feet, was ready to be launched. It boasted a frame-
work of steel tubing, bevel gear transmission, cotton-
percaline-covered wings and two pusher propellers. It
weighed 850 pounds with the pilot. The aerodrome used
a split—vane rudder and an “equilibrium control,” which
trimmed the ship fore and aft. The pilot was able to
adjust the engine in flight from his seat in front of the

power plant. Lateral and vertical controls were mounted
to the right and left of the exaggerated dihedral of the
wings. The aerodrome was mounted on the catapult
and ready to launch, and there it sat for two months
while storms lashed the Quantico area.

Finally, on October 7, 1903, the launching was made.
Professor Langley was detained in Washington for
official business or, perhaps, merely used that excuse
to hide from the waiting press, who had already ex-
pressed an open criticism of the -government’s waste
of money on the experiment. Nevertheless, the launch-
ing was made, and the aeroship fell heavily from the
end of the platform into the water. Manly, its pilot,
was rescued unhurt and made a statement to the press
in which he blamed a lack of balance in the airframe
for the failure.

Although his heart was never in the new experiment,

Langley took the latest failure as a, personal defeat..

However, his courage would not be subjugated and
through the constant and relentless persuasion of Manly,
he repeated the fateful experiment of 1903. The latest
attempt on January 6, 1906, resulted in the destruction
of the machine, even before it left the catapult.

And so ended the experimens in flight by Professor
Samuel Piermont Langley. A short time after the failure
of the fund-raising campaign for the last trial of
Langley’s man-carrying machine, the Wright brothers
successfully made their flight at Kitty Hawk. When Pro-
fessor Langley read of their success, he turned to Manly
and said, “I must congratulate them.” But the fire of
curiosity and the burning desire to achieve powered
flight were gone from Langley’s eyes. He cleared his
desk in the Smithsonian Institute and resigned his
position.

On February 27, 1906, without fanfare or public
attention, forgotten by the press which beat him to
defeat and the crowds that waited to see him fail,
Professor Langley died. He had never seen a man fly.

In 1914, a rebuilt model of the man-carrying areo-
drome was successfully flown and landed on the waters
of the Potomac, proving too late to the world that
Professor Langley had achieved his dream and that
only the world prevented him from seeing it. I

THE LANGLEY
MEMORIAL LECTURE

BY JOHN W. SIMPSON

The second lecture presented in memoriam of Samuel P. Langley was given by
Mr. John W. Simpson. The life of Prof. Langley was the life of a pioneer in the
field of powered flight. Mr. Simpson can also be considered a pioneer, but in a
field completely unknown to the people of Langley’s time - atomic energy. Mr.
Simpson has contributed greatly in the development of practical nuclear reactor
power plants.

At present Mr. Simpson is serving as director of the Bettis, Large and Arco
atomic power divisions of Westinghouse Electric Corporation. He was serving as
assistant manager of the Bettis Plant during the design and construction of the
nuclear propulsion plants for the U.S.S. Nautilus and the U.S.S. Skate. The
division is currently developing the nuclear reactor plant for the first atomic
powered surface vessel.

The design and construction of the pressurized water reactor now in operation
at Shippingport, Pa. was personally managed by Mr. Simpson.

A native of Glenn Springs, S. C., Mr. Simpson w-as graduated from the United
States Naval Academy with a bachelor of science degree in engineering.He joined
Westinghouse in 1937, and by studying during his free time, earned a master’s
degree in electrical engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in 1941.

For his work in the application of atomic power for Naval and civilian use he
was awarded the Westinghouse Order of Merit, the highest award the company
gives to its employesl

It is an honor to be your Dr. Samuel P. Langley Mem-
orial lecturer.

Meeting with you today is a homecoming. While the
University of Pittsburgh is not my alma mater, I spent
pleasant years here in graduate study and will long
appreciate and remember the association. In recalling
the years here, I realized I am from that other genera-
fion having attended college and graduate school be-
fore the so called atomic or space :age. My academic
years were a time when we thought our educational
system was good and only educational experts were
qualified to advise students. But it seems to be open
season now, we are all experts, and you are in for some
more advice today.

I would like to speak about this unusual moment
in history when man has begun to venture into outer
space and try to relate the challenge of the coming
exploration to our daily lives. While this is a popular
topic and a vehicle for handing out advice, it does
deserve some serious reflection.

Lately the various news media are crowded with de-
tail on every outer space prediction or accomplishment
and we might avoid just going over current events.
Instead, it would be better to approach the subject in
keeping with the spirit of the Langley Lecture.

Throughout his lifetime Dr. Langley concerned him-
self with theory -- with astronomical theory and the
theory of flight for heavier than air craft. His work
was not dictated by popular notions but by those inner
convictions which come only from basic understanding.

If there is any singular need in our nation today, it
seems to be this —- a greater concern for fundamental
theory.,from which sound day to day decisions can be
made. In particular it is needed if our national outer
space effort is to succeed.

This morning we might look at some of the theoretical
aspects of astronautics not only from the scientific and
technical viewpoint, but also from that of the humani-
ties. Some guidelines on our roles as citizens and en-
gineers may emerge.

I believe that the primary theoretical requirement
in astronautics is outside the domain of the scientist and
engineer. If our national program for space exploration
is to continue to serve the national interest, we must
all do a better job of understanding the reasons why
we should make the effort.

Many reasons ‘spring to mind.Reasons such as those of
national defense, advancing the prestige of the United
States, and the promotion of greater learning and un-
derstanding are frequently heard. We can afford to
probe each of these further and rate them in order of
importance.

You hear that an outer space program is vital to
our national defense, but those who make this conten-
tion are often accused of mixing astronautics and plain
rocketry. Today the rocket fired from one place on earth
to another after a momentary flight beyond our atmos-
phere is a prime military weapon. The rocket engines

developed for missiles serve astronautical investigation
but at this point the similarity seems to end. Some mili-
tary applications for orbital satellites and outer space
vehicles have been described, but few of thes have yet
gained general acceptance.

We can postulate that there will be defense applica-
tions and that they will follow the traditional lines of
military aviation. We can expect that satellites and space
vehicles will be useful for communications, reconnais-
sance or even bombardment in warfare, but massive
technical work remains to be done before any of these
things could come to pass.

The military strategists face a big theoretical job in
analyzing the role astronautics will play in strengthen-
ing our national defense and preventing war. This is
a ponderous task because of the difficulty of applying
advanced technical information to military theory.

The weight of informed opinion seems to be that the
strategists have not yet described the military space
mission but there have been some excellent works by
military authorities and such civilian experts as Dr.
Bernard Brodie of Princeton. It should not detract to
say that far more remains to be done. Until the analyses
are in, we can only justify the military role of intra-
planetary rockets and speak in generalities of defense
for satellites and space vehicles.

I, for one, beleive that there is a major defense require-
ment for these devices, but this is built on the convic-
tion that modern war is so total that no new technolo-
gy can remain unaffected.

Another reason for having an outer space program
is heard and it is also a good reason. It is the need to
maintain the prestige of the United States in the world
through advanced scientific demonstrations. Many well
reasoned articles have been written on this and the
report of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United
States Senate on the relationship between national
prestige and scientific accomplishment, is a landmark
of understanding. In addition, Mr. Kruschev hammered
home the point each time he spoke of his sputniks.

When the social and political scientists claim that
astronautical supremacy is vital to the maintenance of
our national prestige, they have to answer some diffi-
cult questions. While a sputnik can capture the popular
imagination, are we sure that the capture is not transi-
tory only to be replaced by some other spectacular ac-
complishment in another field. At best prestige is
nebulous and difficult to measure. It would sometimes
seem to offer an inaccurate measure of what our na-
tional space effort should be.

We can see then, that if we approached exploring
the universe solely on the basis of prestige or prepara-
tion for war, we might in either or both cases work
from a floating premise. We might start the kind of
program which shifts and changes, hurries up and
waits, with changing world events. Furthermore, as a
moral nation, do we wish to embark on one of the finest
enterprises man can contemplate by shadowing it with

power politics? We probably do not.

Our primary national purpose should be the acqui-
sition of knowledge. This also happens to be good busi-
ness for pure knowledge pays dividends a thousand-fold
and the value received from an outer space program
will exceed any estimate we can make today. After
outer space exploration there would be an explosive
growth of understanding not only of the universe, the
solar system and our planet, but also of -the nature of
origin of life, time and matter.

When we propel measuring instruments into outer
space, and surely after the first manned space vehicle
is launched, a vast harvest of fundamental knowledge
will be acquired.

For example, the time dilatation theories of Ein-
stein can be measured.

We can learn the composition of other celestial bodies
like the moon and begin to understand their origins.

We will understand far more in cosmology and know
more of the universe as an orderly system.

If astronomical satellites are established, the pano-
rama of the sky will be opened to us without the light
distortions caused by our atmosphere and freedom from
this frustration will enlarge astronomical knowledge.

In outer space laboratories radiation can be measured
with freedom from the earth’s magnetic field and with-
out air scattering.

Advances in meteorology will be great when we
can study the world’s weather phenomenon as a whole.

We would learn new techniques in communications
when satellites are available for the communications
engineer.

I cite these only as examples and surely they are but
a small part of the ultimate harvest. The limitation in
recording benefits is our lack of understanding but,
for sure, anyone standing alone is of priceless value,
measureable in dollars at a later date when applied for
a practical purpose.

There is nothing novel about having governmental or
national support for a program of exploration. Through-
out the history of nations, exploration has been recog-
nized as having a national purpose. Even in antiquity
the sovereign was the source of funds for the explorer.
These men of other times had no better perspective
than we. Instead, in today’s democratic society public
support is needed for governmental action. This in turn
requires public understanding. Here is a job to be done
and the scientist and engineer is best qualified to carry
the message.

Before we move into the purely technical fields,
where we will be more at home, I might summarize.
There is a need for greater theoretical understanding in
the social and political fields to assure support for
astronautics and space exploration. There is a need for a
public explanation of the great value of pure knowledge
and how its acquisition enriches our lives and promotes

the national prestige and defense. The scientist and
engineer can assist by doing a better job of getting his
ideas across to his fellow men and fellow scholars.

Enormous power and energy must be harnessed for
outer space exploration. With today’s technology some

1000 or more pounds of fuel would be needed to put
one pound of payload on the moon. Even for unmanned
scientific satellites in low orbit between 50 and 100
pounds of fuel are consumed. This gives some measure
of power requirements.

To get power today we use the so called chemical
fuels and from their combustion power and thrust are
produced. For some years to come these chemically
fueled engines will be our rocket boosters and although
greater efficiencies can be expected as time goes on,
big additions in power and thrust will come from bigger
engines or clusters of engines. Perhaps breakthroughs
are still possible within the chemical fuels and engines,
but they seem to be at a stage where improvements
will be hard won in engineering and materials changes.

Some years from now, and I believe it will be less
than ten years, nuclear energy will be applied to power
rocket boosters and here there is much to learn and
much to improve. Work has been underway for almost
five years on the development of high temperature
nuclear reactors for rocket propulsion. These reactors
are designed so that gases such as hydrogen can be
passed over them and heated to produce rocket thrust.

The big gain in nuclear propulsion is the freedom
from a combustion process which permits the discharge
from the rocket nozzle of only li-ght elements like
hydrogen. These with their atomic weight permit
greater thrust per unit weight of fuel. This is a consider-
able advantage and has been described as the high
specific impulse of nuclear rocket engines.

There have been other proposals for using nuclear
energy for a rocket booster such as propulsion by con-
trolled atom bomb explosions. This approach would
seem to present some mean structural problems for the
mechanical engineer, but the idea cannot be discarded
as completely impossible. In this approach the payoff
is big for the forces in nuclear explosions are huge.

Surely other methods will evolve for converting nu-
clear energy for rocket propulsion but these will only
come after much advanced theoretical work.

Perhaps one day a propulsion device mid—way between
an atomic bomb and a nuclear reactor will be possible.
We don’t have the foggiest notion today whether or not
this is even possible, but such an accomplishment could
have a tremendous significance.

As I said earlier, big blocks of power are needed
before man can explore outer space, but this is not
limited solely to propulsive power. Once _a satellite -
be it manned or unmanned—is in orbit, if it is to serve
any useful purpose, it needs auxiliary power of some
kind. In other words, if an orbital vehicle is to be more
than a novelty, it needs its own internal power supply.
The power source is generally dictated by the quantities
of power needed and this in turn by the vehicle's
mission.

If we want a satellite to do a job like transmitting
radio signals for a short period of time, batteries might
be fine. For longer life we might look to solar energy
and some conversion scheme like the paddle wheel. In
the future we can look to things like photovoltaic and
other ideas for the conversion of solar energy, but more

development work is necessary before these could be
used.

As the demands for power increase, and even in the
more advanced unmanned missions they will, we must
look to other sources of power. Chemical fuel cells will
help, but they have a lifetime and power ceiling. Isotope
heat sources, such as the one demonstrated at the White
House last year, are quite practical and offer long life
times, but they are low power‘ sources.

At some point the demands for real power appear-
power above a hundred watts. For manned missions
even more will be needed. Once again we start to look
at nuclear reactors for they offer big blocks of power
for sustained periods of time. Here there are some first
class technical problems for things don’t work in outer
space as they do on earth. Take the heat sink problem
of a nuclear auxiliary power source as an example.

You can’t convert all of your heat from the nuclear
reactor to work and electric power, and you face heat
disposal problems. In our atomic submarines we had a
big ocean for dumping heat but how do you do this
in space? For an unmanned satellite or even manned,
how do we desi-gn a control system independent of hu-
man decisions? These are but two of many problems to
be solved.

To be sure, manned space flight is only going to be
possible if we can meet the power requirement. Outer
space is the most hostile environment man ever faced.
We must be able to create a benign artificial environ-
ment to permit him to live. Every phase of existence will
take power. Power to regenerate food and water, to
keep air pressures at permissible levels, to do almost
everything we consider common place in our daily
lives.

These auxiliary power units will also supply power
for the propulsion of space vehicles in the stages of their
flights when the primary fuels are exhausted or are
being conserved for other purposes.

Electric power in big blocks is the indispensable part
of most of the “exotic” schemes like ion, plasma and
photon propulsion. These are now contemplated for the
long interplanetary type flights where even small forces
can add to a vehicle acceleration and be profitable
when applied for a continuous period of time.

I would imagine each of you feel that in your career
you will brush up against many of the things we are
speaking about today. Surely most of you will, but you
are going to find that advancing the technology of
astronautics and other fields like nuclear power require
of the engineer far more than was ever expected in the
past. If he is to be a leader in his chosen field or even
hold his own far more basic education and theoretical
understanding is necessary. It seems that the academic
work behind a bachelor degree is no longer completely
sufficient to qualify the engineer for some of today’s
more challenging fields. It is more than enough to make
him a competent technician, but it is hardly enough
for the man who aspires to technical leadership. I have
heard one of the scientists at our astronuclear labora-
tory say that a bachelor degree is about as valuable
now as a high school diploma was twenty years ago.

I might note here that Dr. Langley had no more
formal education than a high school diploma but his self-
study work at the Boston libraries was probably equal
to the graduate work of today.

I hope I am not leadin-g you away from the recom-
mendations of your faculty advisers when I suggest
that one who aspires to these new fields should stay
close to the fundamentals in his undergraduate years
and limit his specialization. If one wants to do advanced
technical work, he should avoid specialization and
choosing options which tend to make one a tradesman
rather than a professional engineer. In other words, be-
come as broad as possible in theoretical understanding
for the things which lie ahead twenty and thirty years
from now are beyond our comprehension.

Surely you want leadership in your chosen field, but
to many this has come to mean the assignment of
senior management responsibility in a large organiza-
tion. This is not necessarily the measure of success.
Success is always a hard thing to define, but I would
think that for the scientist and engineer respect in his
profession and among his colleagues is one measure. In
the large organizations of today there can only be a
few management jobs at the top. If only those who

attained these were considered successful, one’s career
prospects would be dim, but the chances for a successful
career are greater than the few number of top manage-
ment positions would indicate.

Industry and other similar organizations are now
ready to give the talented, important positions which
are not classified or stratified by management responsi-
bility. In the years ahead I foresee the structure of
these organizations changing with equal prestige or
perhaps -greater prestige flowing from technical achieve-
ment rather than management status. When we discuss
this, the comparison is often made to the movie industry
where the laurels and pay come to the stars rather
than to the producer. This will be the case in the tech-
nical organizations in the future. Success will be meas-
ured more in terms of intellectual achievement. This
is a fine thing to contemplate, but it portends competi-
tion among talent — a competition for which you must
prepare. ‘

There are many pessimistic predications these days
on our national future and the survival of freedom in
the world. Most of this worry stems from a suspicion
that we are falling behind in our. technical potential and
are growing soft.

I am not too apprehensive about these things after I

working with our young scientists and engineers. They
are not soft and their years of training were arduous.
They are capable and want to work on the toughest
technical problems. They don’t want the soft jobs.

In the years ahead our advanced technical program
will fall into these hands and there will be sustained
progress and accomplishments.

In closing, I would observe that free nations have
usually survived perilous times by blundering through.
In the years ahead there may be a new experience for
the free world. We may make it because of sheer en-
lightenment. I

He's been on his way up
from the day he started work

James C. Bishop got his BS. in Electrical
Engineering from the University of Illinois on
June 23, 1953. On July 1, he went to work as a
lineman in the Illinois Bell Telephone Company
management training program. On July 2, he
was “shinnying” up telephone poles.

And he’s been “climbing” ever since. A
planned rotational training program, interrupted
by a stint in the Army, took Jim through vir-
tually every phase of plant operations.

He was promoted to Station Installation
Foreman in July, 1957. Then came more train-
ing at company expense—in human relations
and other supervisory subjects—at Knox College.

Since early 1958, Jim has been Central
Office Foreman in the Kedzie District of Chicago,
which embraces about 51,000 telephone stations.
He has 19 men reporting to him.

“I was hired as ‘a candidate for manage-
ment,’ ” he says. “I know I’ll get the training
and opportunity to keep moving ahead. How far
I go is up to me. I can’t ask for more than that.”

Westinghouse Metallurgists, Dr. M. J. Fraser(foreground) and Dr. H. W. Weart, prepare to photograph a molten alloy sample as.one step
in the determination of liquid-solid interfacial energy. These direct experimental measurements are the first of their kind ever attempted.

The Metallurgy Lab helps when you need a
new alloy to make your idea practical

The Metallurgy Lab helps Westinghouse engineers solve
problems involving the need for special alloys and other
new materials. If an engineer’s idea requires a new kind
of material to withstand high temperatures or one with
unusual magnetic or thermoelectric properties, the men
in the Metallurgy Lab may be able to develop it for him.

This laboratory, one of the largest of its kind in the
country, uses both basic and applied research to come
up with a spectrum of new materials with a Variety of
properties. One typical activity is the development of
alloys of high melting point metals like tungsten, tan-
talum and niobium for use in reactors. Another is a study
of deformation and fracture, which will add to the store
of metallurgical knowledge engineers in other depart-
ments can call on to solve their speciﬁc problems.

The young engineer at Westinghouse isn’t expected
to know all of the answers. The work We do is often too
advanced for that. Instead, each man’s abilities and
knowledge are backed up by that of specialists like those

in the Metallurgy Laboratory. Even the toughest prob-
lems are easier to solve with this kind of help.

If you have ambition and real ability, you can have a
rewarding career with Westinghouse. Our broad prod-
uct line, decentralized operations, and diversiﬁed tech-
nical assistance provide hundreds of challenging
opportunities for talented engineers.

Basic Research at IBM

IBM scientist Gerald Burns
studies ferroelectrics

to improve understanding
of their basic properties.

A basic research project

‘‘I’m using nuclear resonance to explore ferro-
electrics," says IBM scientist Gerald Burns.
“We're trying to discover how the ions in a ferro-
electric crystal are arranged, and why and how
they change position and structure with tempera-
ture_changes. Ferroelectric crystals have a revers-
ible spontaneous polarization . . . that is, they can
be polarized in either of two directions, and, by
the application of an electric field, polarization can
be reversed.”

‘ How did Gerry Burns come to work on this prob-

lem? “l started this particular research project be-
cause it was related to other work I had been doing
and I felt it would prove challenging and reward-
ing. Little is known about what goes on in a ferro-
electric crysta|—or why. Our basic objectives are
to find out what and why.

“At the planning stage, the project seemed to offer
a great research potential, but none of us was
sure how long the project might last or what its
ramifications might eventually be. It's a good ex-
ample of the basic research done at IBM.’’

A day at the laboratory

One of the eight scientists in the Ferroelectric Re-
search Group, 26-year-old Gerald Burns began a
recent day by setting up equipment for the first
daily run.

“The experiment is conceptually quite simple,” he
explained. “A ferroelectric crystal is placed in the
tank circuit of an oscillator, between the pole
pieces of a large electromagnet. The sample is sur-
rounded by a.dewar so that the temperature can be
accurately regulated. Then the magnetic field is
slowly decreased. When the field reaches certain
values, the nuclei in the crystal absorb energy from
the oscillator. The trick is to detect this absorption
which is quite small. Runs at various temperatures
are made, and the temperature dependence of this
absorption is studied.

After setting up the first run, Gerry Burns met
with the head of his group. Together, they dis-
cussed the temperature dependence of the nuclear
quadrupole resonance coupling constants. Several
helpful suggestions were made.

Gerry Burns then talked with chemists who grow
the crystals used in the experiments. They dis-
cussed possible variations in the crystal-growing
method and considered the growth of other crys-
tals in order to broaden the experiments.

Early in the afternoon, he attended a seminar con-
ducted by a visiting professor on the subject of
the atomic structure of solids. Each week, several
such seminars on a variety of technical matters
are given.

After the seminar, Gerry Burns returned to set up Q

another run at a different temperature. He also
talked to a technician about building a new piece
of equipment to be used in future experiments.

Excellent facilities and programs

“Besides these experiments, I'm also doing some
theoretical calculations in the field of nuclear
quadrupole resonance. The actual computations
were done here at the Laboratory on an IBM 704,
which can perform in minutes computationswhich
would take weeks if done by other methods.
“This is one of the advantages of working at IBM.
Large-scale high-speed computers are available to
research scientists when needed. Furthermore you
will find your colleagues always willing to help
when you are stumped by a problem. Many of
these men are recognized authorities in their
fields. The exchange is always informative and
often stimulates new ideas and approaches.

“Our Company offers many educational opportu-
nities—both in general education and for ad-
vanced degrees,” Gerry Burns said. “As an exam-
ple, engineers and scientists may earn a Master's
Degree in a post-graduate program conducted by
Syracuse University right here in Poughkeepsie.
“We also have a very useful library. Just the other
day I dropped in to pick up some technical papers
I needed as source material for an article. I've al-
ready published one paper on my experiments,”
he noted. “You're encouraged to publish your
findings and to participate in professional society
meetings. |t’s important for a research man to
work in an atmosphere where independent think-
ing is encouraged and where every effort is made
to facilitate research investigations."

ANOTHER WAY RCA
SERVES BUSINESS
THROUGH
ELECTRONICS

RCA Electronics creates the “50‘I” to streamline the paper work

of business—it reads, writes, figures and remembers on tape

Much of today’s traﬂic jam in paper
work is being eliminated by electronic
data processing. But to build a system
that would be practical and economical
for even medium—sized organizations
was a job for electronic specialists.

To solve the problem, RCA drew on
its broad experience in building com-
puters for military applications and
combed its many laboratories for the
latest electronic advances that could
help. The result was the RCA “S01”
high-speed electronic data processing
system—~the most compact, ﬂexible, and
economical ever built. It is a pioneer sys-

tem with all-transistor construction for
business use.

The “501” cuts out paper work bottle-
necks for many government agencies
and businesses, from stock brokerage
ﬁrms to public utilities, banks, insurance
companies, and steel mills.

It “remembers” millions of letters,
numbers, and symbols that are “read”
onto its magnetic tapes by such things
as punch cards and paper tapes. In a
fraction of a second, it can do thousands
of calculating, sorting, and comparing
operati0ns—and checks each step.
Finally, it writes such things as bills, re-

E&M Cabinet

The lifeblood of an engineering college is its under-
graduate student body. The actions and reactions of
the individual students, taken together, determine for
the most part the reputation of the school. A student
body of good studentswill create a reputation of high
scholarship and able leadership for any school. In addi-
tion, if the students possess an interest in the school,
that intangible quality called spirit, the school becomes
known as an active and desirable one.

An engineering college in a great industrial center
such as Pittsburgh offers the student unequalled profes-
sional opportunities. Conversely, the urban environ-
ment created by this great industrial center, makes
necessary an extra effort on the part of students to
create this quality of spirit which is so vital to any
orgaization or institution.

It was for this reason that, early in the 1930’s, the
Engineering and Mines Association was formed. The
governing body of the Association is the Engineering
and Mines Cabinet. The purposes of the E&M cabinet
are to better coordinate the activities of Engineering
and Mines students, and to represent them in the
student government of the University.

In order to accomplish these aims, the Cabinet is
composed of elected representatives of each class and
each department in the Schools of Engineering and
Mines. These representatives are presently organized,
for efficient operation of the Cabinet, into the offices
of President, Vice-President, Recording Secretary, Phy-
sical Plant Director, Corresponding Secretary, Treasurer
and Coordinator of Committees. These positions are held
by Raymond Sierka, Robert Stump, Sylvan,Kretz, Carl
Roos, John Barthen, Nino Barsotti, and Ronald Pizze-
daz respectively. This group composes the Executive
Committee. In addition special and standing committees
are organized to perform duties delegated t-o them by
the executive committee.

With this organization Cabinet is able to accomplish
its many activities. Outstanding among these many
activities are the two social events held each trimester.
These are major events on the calendar of every student
in Engineering and Mines.

The Engineering and Mines International Travel and
Training award, known as EMITT, provides an eight-
week travel and training scholarship to Europe for
several outstanding Engineering students. This program
is carried out through E&M Cabinet guidance and
financial assistance.

The annual Engineer’s Week, a notable event in the
University Calendar, is sponsored and planned by E&M
Cabinet through its Central Planning Committee. This
committee is given responsibility for all activities con-
ducted during this fun-filled week. Characterized by
a competitive spirit among the departments, the event
provides a break from studies and an opportunity to
work with contemporaries toward a common goal —
the Shamrock Award. This award is given to the de-
partment which has been the most outstanding in the
events of the week.

The official publication of the Engineering‘ and Mines
association is the E&M Bulletin. This newsletter keeps
the Engineering and Mines students informed of the
happenings both in the Engineering schools and in
the Engineering world in general. The editor of this
publication, (John Barthen,) is chosen by the E&M
Cabinet and is directly responsible to the executive
committee.

In an attempt to develop spirit within the school
and the various departments, Cabinet has established
an intramural athletic program. Each department in
the schools of Engineering and Mines organizes a team
in each of the seasonal sports. Participation in this
program is excellent and spirit, which is the goal of
the program, is developed. I

Probably the most unique aspect of the Engineering
and Mines Cabinet is the fact that it is the only govern-
ment organization on campus which is not subsidized
by the University. Its sources of income are the vend-
ing machines in the lounges in Engineering and State
Halls and the sale of E&M Association membership
cards.

With the inauguaration of the trimester program this
year, many unique problems must be solved by the
Cabinet Executive Committee. The close time schedule
of the trimester plan has necessitated a change in the

constitution. In addition, representation of the student
body during the third trimester will be difficult to or-
ganize. The annual program of social events will have
to be revised to fit the triterm schedule, as will the
sports programs.

The cabinet and its members are aware of these
problems and are formulating plans to effect the best
possible solutions in the interest of the Engineering and
Mines students. A committee is studying the constitution
and recommending revisions to the Cabinet Member-
ship. A new constitution will take effect at the beginning
of the third term.

The schedules of the social and sports events are
being revised to fit the trimester plan.

The most serious problem is that of adequate repres-
entation during the third term. This problem, however,
can only be settled after the registration for the third
term reveals how.-many students will pursue their studies
during the third trimester. A study is being made to
tentatively determine this.

The most important factor in the success of the En-
gineering and Mines Cabinet is the participation and
interest» of the student body. No matter how resourceful
and efficient the representatives are, nothing can be ac-
complished without the wholehearted support of the
students they represent. I

Analog computers solve
complex problems rapidly,
while minimizing the chance

for human error.

BY DR. RONALD G. SHULTZ

Investigations in science are now carried out on a scale
undreamed of only two or three decades ago. Scientific
principles and models can be verified against experi-
mental facts with small cost and hazard and with very
convenient flexibility. Thus new bodies of scientific
knowledge have been established and new bodies of
knowledge will be added as a result of research and
development performed on computers.

Computers fall into many different classes and sub-
classes. The major divisions for our purposes are the
divisions into analog and digital computers. The term
digit comes from the Latin meaning finger and implies
that people either used to count on their fingers, or
that a finger represented unity. Thus, digital devices
are essentially counting devices.

Analog devices, on the other hand, make use of
similar forms. That is, they do not count, but do an

44

equivalent operation to the one required and provide
an equivalent answer which can be used to obtain the
desired answer. Probably the most useful example‘
of an analog computer is the common slide rule. In a
slide rule, numbers are converted to logarithms which
are in turn converted to linear lengths. Answers for
some arithmetical operations can be obtained readily
and directly by manipulating pieces of equipment on
which these lengths have been inscribed. With these
brief definitions, let us trace the development of the
analog computer, illustrate the important areas in which
it is used, and finally discuss the operation and problem
set up procedure for the general purpose electronic
analog computer.

M-ost physical relationships which we encounter can
be expressed by means of ordinary or partial differential
equations. Differential equations, however, describe
these relationships in general terms and in order to.
be useful in engineering applications, they mu st
be solved explicitly for the variables of interest. Because
of the pressing demands of solving these equations,
which can be extremely difficult t-o do manually, the
analog computer was developed.

The early art of analog devices was active in the
time of Lord Kelvin. Previously, mechanical computing
elements had been developed which could perform the
basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction,
and multiplication. These, however, were not sufficient
to solve the differential equations mentioned before.
The method of solution proposed was one of successive
integration of the differential equation to obtain a
solution. This idea was first recorded by Lord Kelvin
in 1876. Kelvin’s idea was prompted by the fact that
his brother, James Thompson, had invented an integra-
tor using a mechanical device.

Although this machine was suggested in 1876, the
first successful machine of this type wasn’t built until
1925. Only a few of these mechanical differential analy-
zers were built because the cost of machining the parts

vi?"

and the slow operation of the computer placed too
high a cost on the problem solutions.

The first electrical analog computers appeared in
the 1930’s. Following this, many different types of ana-
log computers were designed and built. These computers
were classified as special purpose computers, which
were designed for specific problems; and general pur-
pose computers which were used for a large variety
of problems.

The general purpose computers are broken into sub
Classes known as the direct or physical analog computer
and the indirect or mathematical analog computer. The
direct analogy type computer is based on the analogy
between dashpots and resistors, springs and condeners,
and mass and inductance. These computers are used
primarily in solving aircraft vibration problems and
in solving heat flow problems. An example of this ana-
logy is that between a mechanical system consisting of
a spring, a mass, and a dashpot being forced by a
function F(t) and the electrical system consisting of
resistance, capacitance, and inductance in series being
forced by a voltage  Using D’Alembett’s principle
for the mechanical system, the following equation can
be written:

L-3-‘-1-+Ri+-é—SIat=E(t)

Where v is the velocity of the mass, M is the mass, D
the damping coefficient, and K the spring constant.
The equation for the electrical system can be obtained
by application of Kirchoff’s voltage law giving:

M:—¥+DV+KSVdt=F(t)

The two equations are seen to have an identical form
and there is a direct relationship between mass and
inductance; damping coefficient and resistance; spring
constant and reciprocal of capacitance ; forcing function
and voltage; and velocity and curent. This means that
a wide variety of mechanical systems can be solved by
setting up an analogous electrical circuit and applying a
voltage as the forcing function. The variation of the
currents is then analogous to the velocity of the original
system. The integral of the current would then corres-
pond to the displacement x.

The indirect or mathematical type of computer is
known as an electronic differential analyzer or an elec-
tronic analyzer. Hence, instead of trying to find the
electrical or mechanical analog of a system, one need
find only the governing equations of a system to prepare
it for computer solution.

Unlike the mathematician, the differential analyzer
notices no particular difference between linear and non-
linear equations and wades into implicit equations
almost as easily as it does into explicit equations.

It was not until the introduction of the operational
amplifier during World War II that the newest and
most widely used class of general purpose analog com-

puters was made possible. The computer which is located
in the Electrical Engineering Department, called a
PACE built by Electronic Associates Inc. is an example
of this type of computer. Lovell, of Bell Laboratories,
is generally credited with the introduction of the opera-
tional amplifier during the Second World War. In 1950,
Goldberg, of R.C.A. Laboratories, introduced the con-
cept of stabilizating a DC amplifier against drift by
using AC amplifiers in a special manner. This concept
led to the almost universal acceptance of DC stabilized
amplifiers in modern general purpose analog computers.

The physical problem variables are represented by
voltages in the electronic analog computer. This means
that for every physical variable in a problem, there is
a corresponding voltage in the analog computer. The
operations carried out economically by an analog com-
puter are addition, subtraction, integration with respect
to time, and multiplication by a constant. Multiplica-
tion and division by variables and the -generation of
arbitrary functions are also carried out, but these re-
quire relatively expensive and complicated equipment.
Other operations may also be performed with specialized
equipment.

The electronic analog computer is most widely used
to solve systems which can be represented by differential
equations either linear or nonlinear and with fixed or
variable coefficients. Other applications include the sol-
ution of simultaneous algebraic equations and partial
differential equations, curve fitting devices, finding
the roots of polynomials, and computation of definite
integrals and integral transforms.

Perhaps the greatest application of the analog com-
puter in solving problems of the type mentioned above
is in the field of servo-mechanical systems. These sys-
tems may be anything from a dial located in a remote
position to a guided missile or a pilotless aircraft. The
computer allows the system to be investigated thorough-
ly before any hardware is built or put together. Very
extensive regions of application of analog computers
exist in the fields of atomic energy, aircraft, automo-
biles, manufacturing and processing industries.I

The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
But there is quite another kind of “space” close at hand, a kind that will always
challenge the genius of man.

This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
distance between them . . . the kind of space found between mainland and off-
shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply
base, between the site of a mountain crash and a waiting ambu1ance—above all,
Sikorsky is concerned with the precious “spaceway” that currently exists be-
tween all earthbound places.

— .3 Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
aircraft conﬁgurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-
hicles that can prove to be tomorrow’s most versatile means of transportation.

Here, then, is a space age challenge to be met with the ﬁnest and most practical
engineering talent. Here, perhaps, is the kind of challenge you can meet.

WILLIAM BLANKEN STEIN, EE ’6O

As a recipient of the 1959 EMITT award, I chose
to travel and work in Germany. Arrangements were
made by I. A. S. T. E. for me to work for a hard coal
electricity company known as Steinkohlen Elektrizitat
AG. STEAG is located in Essen, Germany and employs
150 people with the development and design of power
stations, in the Ruhr district. While STEAG owns only
one power station, it has the responsibility of determin-
ing the quotas on power output and consumption of
some seventy combination power stations and coal
mines in the Ruhr district.

My eight week term of employment consisted of three
different phases. The first was working as a helper
for a boiler instrument man in a power station. The
second was observing the operation of a high frequency
radio system in Essen. The final work phase consisted
of helping a German Professor prepare several technical
papers that he had given at conferences in Italy and
Switzerland. The papers were being prepared for pub-
lication in English.

I was indeed fortunate in regard to housing while
in Essen for I lived with a wonderful German family
who treated me more like a relative than a foreigner. At
other times, I was invited to the homes of employees
of STEAG for dinner or to spend the day. During
these periods, I was able to observe firsthand the Ger-
man homelife.

The city of Essen is 1100 years old and since it is the
center of the Ruhr industrial center, it was seventy
percent damaged during the war. It is a credit to the
resourcefulness of the German people that today there
are no signs of any of the damage.

Since I was employed only five days a week, I had
ample opportunity on weekends to travel to other
cities in the Ruhr district, including Duisburg, the lar-
gest inland harbor in Europe, Cologne with its magnifi-
cent Cathedral, and Dusseldorf, the capitol of the
German state where I was living. Another place of
interest was the little village and castle of Blankenstein
to which I was invited by the village Burgemeister.

One of the highlight of my stay in Germany was a
four day tour with the German Engineering Students
Association. Seventy students from sixteen countries
who were working in the Ruhr district participated in
the tour. (Confidentially, the only other American was
a student from Carnegie Tech.) The group gathered
in Wuppertal where we became acquainted, visited a
brewery, and rode on a monorail above the town. The
next day we departed by bus for a trip along the Rhine
River to the capital city of Bonn. There we were taken
on a tour of the Bundeshaus (the building of the Ger-
man Senate). We then proceeded to the quaint village
of Zell on Mosil River, a famous wine-making district.
There, as guests of the Burgemeister, we visited wine

cellars and vineyards and were treated to a performance
of the town’s traditional dances at a party given for us
that evening.

It is only with regret that I left Germany after eight
weeks. If it had not been for my desire to see more of
Europe, the departure would have been more difficult.

I traveled by train from Essen to Cologne and then
by Rhine steamer up the Rhine into southern Germany
to the city of Heidelberg. (The Rhine flows from south
to north). It is along this section of the river that the
castles flourish high on the hills above Rhine vineyards
and German villages. From the University of Heidelberg,
the setting of the operetta “The Student Prince,” my
next destination was Switzerland’s largest city, Zurich.
Included also in my tour of Switzerland were the cities
of Lucerne and Interlahen. Switzerland is certainly a
country out of the storybooks with its gorgeous Alpine
panorama, secluded lakes, picturesque old villages and
rustic simplicity.

It was upon departure from Switzerland that I first
encountered language difficulties. Up until this time
I had only been visiting German speaking countries.
Now I found myself in Italy with no knowledge of the
language. In order to depart from a steady diet of pizza
and spaghetti in the restaurants, I would point to an
item on the menu and say to the waiter, in an inquisi-
tive tone, the Italian equivalent of “Good.” With this
I was able to -get by but, nevertheless, meals in Italy
were always a hit and miss proposition. However, the
beauty of Rome completely offset any minor difficulties
I encountered. Rome is certainly the art lover’s paradise.
In the churches and palaces where Raphael, Michaelan-
gelo, Titian, and other great artist actually worked, I
saw their masterpieces in their original setting. A visit
to St. Peter’s, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Mu-
seum was awe-inspiring. Two of the treasures in my
memories of Rome are a special audience with Pope
John XXIII at his summer residence of Castel Gan-
dolfa and a magnificent open air opera performance of
“Il Travatore” in the ancient Batne of Caracalla.

It has been said that everyone must see Paris. So in

southern France for the long trip to Paris. President
Eisenhower had arrived there the previous day for his
conference with President De Gaulle and the city was
gayly decorated with French and American flags and at
least one large “We Like Ike” billboard. Paris is famous
for its tree-lined boulevards, sidewalk cafes, and exis-
tentialists. All three were certainly in evidence in every
section of Paris. The thrill of being in the Louvre and
gazing at the Venus de Milo, the Mona Lisa, and the
statue of the Winged Victory will not easily be forgotten.
Other memories I retain are of walking down the
Champs Elysees from the Arc de Triomphe on a bright
sunny day, climbing the hills to Montmartre with its
narrow twisting streets, and sitting on the banks of the
Seine River.

From Paris I went to Amsterdam, a city of canals
and friendly people, where I boarded my plane for the
return crossing.

HAMILTON STIRLING, PE '60

D~uring the summer of 1959, I worked approximately
two months for the Turkish Petroleum Corporation at
their field camp in Batman, Turkey. Throughout my
stay in Turkey, I was exposed to a culture and society
very different from what we have here in the United
States.

After four days of traveling from New York, I
arrived in Istanbul and reported to the I. A. S. T. E.
office in the Tecnic University. There I was given my
student reduction card and directions on how to catch
the Orient Express for Ankara, where the main office
of T. P. A. O. is located.

When the train pulled into Ankara, I had my first
taste of Turkish hospitality. One of the fellows in the
train compartment invited me to his home for lunch.
Although he spoke no English, we became good friends
and he helped me get in contact with T. P. A. O.
Afterwards, he took me sight seeing in Ankara and as
it ended up, I spent the night at his home. I was amazed
at this type of treatment to a perfect stranger, but was

53

only to find out later that this is the typical Turkish
attitude toward Americans. During the extent of my
two—month stay in Turkey, not once did I hear anti-
American talk nor of any pro-Communist. Located in
such a troubled spot as the Middle East, America
should be glad to have a good friend such as Turkey.

The following day, T. P. A. 0. made reservations
for me to fly to Diyarbakir and from here to catch a
train in to Batman, the company’s field camp.

As I stepped off the train that evening in Batman, it
suddenly hit me just how far I really was from home.
Looking around I could see only barren, rocky country-
side, a few small buildings which made-up the railway
station, and a throng of strangely garbed people milling
around through the station. I was met at the train
by three men whom I assumed were sent by T. P. A. O.
and taken to a small guest house near the refinery.

The next morning I was taken to the main office
in the camp and seated before the chief engineer.
After introducing myself in English, and explaining
my purpose for being there, I was quite surprised when
he looked up and inquired, “How do you thin-g the
Pitt football team will make-out this year?” I learned
later that all chief engineers working for T. P. A. O.
are American educated. That afternoon they worked
out a program for me. I was to work for three weeks
in the Garzan oil field, three weeks in the Raman oil
field, and the remaining time was to be spent at the
main camp looking over the refinery and the new
laboratories.

My three weeks in Garzan were wonderful. Breakfast
at seven o’clock consisted of dried, ripe olives, goat’s
cheese, tea, and bread. Lunch was fried squash with
yogurt, rice, fruit, and plenty of water.

The Garzan field had three drilling ri-gs, two work-
over units, and about twenty-five pumping wells.
I was given an opportunity to work at all phases of
field operations, and was glad to have such a great
experience. I ate, worked, and slept with the men. It
was the first time they had ever had such close contact
with an American. Many times when we were pulling
tubing from a well, they would ask why I was working
since it was the custom there that a college engineer

sights in Europe. Any visit to Rome would be incomplete
if one did not visit St. Peter's Basilica.

does no labor, but holds an administrative position. I
would reply that in America all engineers start at the
bottom and work their way up. We all finally agreed it
was better that way.

At the end of my three-week stay in the field, my
program was interrupted by what everyone had ex-
pected to happen sooner or later. Due to the drastic
change in weather, food, and water, I developed a
bad case of dysentery and had to stay at the main c-amp
in Batman for about a week. During this time, I moved
in with an American engineer who was working for
the United Nations on it’s Technical Assistance Pro-
gram for underdeveloped countries. The company pro-
vided me with two doctors who prescribed their age-
old medicine for such trouble. I ate nothing but scraped
apples and potatoes for four days and at the end of
that time was ready to go back to work. However, they
changed my work program and I remained at the
main camp at Batman for the remainder of my time.

During the rest of my stay in Batman, I became
very good friends with everyone there, and also had
many strange experiences and impressions. One such
experience which I will never forget was a tremendous
contrast of modern technical advancement with ancient
custom. The company had just finished constructing
the foundations for a new desalter and dehydrator
which would increase their refinery capacity about
seventy-five percent. All of the necessary equipment
had been purchased from the United States, and was
of the latest design. However, to celebrate the opening
of this new modern unit of the refinery, the company
had a sacrifice of a lamb. I was present at the affair
and was quite honored to be there, but it showed me
the deeply imbedded customs of the people which
contrasted greatly with their desire to modernize.

The main impression I received was the tremendous
advancements they had made with so little to work
with and with such great disadvantages. Since all the
equipment was ordered from America, it took six to
eight months for the machinery to arrive if everything
went smoothly. The usual time between order and
delivery, however, was a year. This poses a tremendous
barrier to a company in such a technical business as
the peroleum industry, but somehow they have grown
despite this hardship. Also all the engineers working
there are relatively new graduates. They have come to
the field with very little practical experience and have
taken over its complete operation. With such draw-
backs as these, it hardly seems possible that in the past
five years they have converted a barren rocky terrain
into a modern camp, refinery, operational oil fields,
and have attained a standard of living high above that
of the surrounding countryside.

When the day arrived when I was to leave Batman,
I actually disliked leaving. I had worked with and
associated with a group of hard working people who
were striving to modernize despite their many hard-
ships. I had left many good friends there, good friends
of America, whom I will probably never see again but
will think of often. -

THE
CAGE

OF
TOMORROW

BY GERALD LEFF, AE ’52

Sand and dust settled lazily as the rusty Army jeep
tore along the barren desert plain. Marc Darah cursed
at the heat and managed to wipe an accumulation of
perspiration from his neck before the jeep hit a large
rock and careened sharply from the dirt road. More
dirt, more dust, and the jeep skidded and was brought
back on course.

Less than one half mile behind the jeep rose
a tower, a gleeming steel structure protruding five
hundred feet from the desert floor. Atop the tower the
sat a harmless looking aluminum cabin. F orty-five min-
utes from the time Darah left the tower, the desert
sky would flare with a light one-thousand times the
intensity of a midday sun.

The driver of the vehicle slowed the jeep as he ap-
proached an intersection. He stopped, paused and hesi-
tatingly glanced over his shoulder as a reflection of
light played over the quaking hood of the jeep. He glan-
ced casually towards the town, lying eight-hundred
yards from the tower, and made a rough estimation of
the time remaining.

“Hmm, thirty minutes, I’d better make one last
check before I pull out.” He slammed the jeep into
first and crouched over the steering wheel as the dust
engulfed him. “Me and my bright ideas —— if the trans-
mitter hadn’t fallen, I would have able to let them
know I planned to check the town before clearing out.
Oh well, I’ll have enough time. Better check the
cameras first.”

The jeep slowed and rolled to a stop in front of a
small brick bungalow, a typical suburban home with
shutters and a flagstone path leading to the door.
Someone sat on the patio, drinking glass in hand. As
he approached the door of the home, he noticed a
grin on the man’s masklike face. “Sorry, can’t join you
today”, said Darah, “busy you know.” He grinned back
at the figure clad in bermudas, relaxing in the desert
sun. The figure didn’t reply —— it maintained its sardonic
grin and ridiculous pose.

He opened the door without bothering to knock and
walked into the living room. A woman sat on the

55

sofa, an unlit cigarette in one hand and the daily
newspaper lightly clutched in the other. Two children
sat on the floor playing with a toy automobile. “Good
afternoon, Mrs. Smith, I hope you are enjoying your
stay.” Neither the woman nor the children replied.
They merely sat motionless, grinning. Darah continued
his tour of inspection.

“Let’s see, two cameras in this room and one in the
garage.” He checked their magazines and triggering
devices. “Uh huh. Well! I guess that’s all for this
bungalow. Better get to the other homes before time
runs short.”

Passing through the dining room, he heard a buzzing
and noticed the electric clock on the wall. “That’s
funny. the clock is fifteen minutes fast. Guess they’ve
turned the juice on a little early.”

He walked the ten yards to the heavy concrete block
hut which housed four slow-motion cameras. As he
entered, he side-stepped the four figures strategically
placed under a leaning wall of two by fours, topped by
concrete blocks. He turned to check the first camera
and the red light began flashing, the cameras began
rolling.

“Oh No! It can’t be. They’ve still got fifteen minutes.
Don’t the fools realize I’m still here?”

The sun was dwarfed by a new light which flashed
over the desert sands.

The darting eyes of a prairie dog, gazing at the
blue sky, melted from the heat traveling at the speed
of light. His small body vaporized as the sands fused
into a crystalline mass.

The blast followed one-thousandth of a second later.
Roaring, like one-hundred hurricanes, it tore across
the desert floor.

Strangely, Darah knew what was happening. He
didn’t pass out. Instead, he felt the pressure caving in
his skull. His body ached and shriveled under the
scorching heat. The fury of the blast hit him and he
was uplifted and hurled like a piece of wheat thrown
into a threshing machine. Then there was no pain,
no sound. He opened his eyes and tried to scream. He
couldn’t for he had no Voice, only thoughts. The
sight that lay before him seared his imagination. Three
mannequins were suspended in mid-air, their artifical
limbs askew, synthetic rubber in the process of dripping
from their distorted faces. The fourth lay against the
wall, its arms and legs splintered by the concrete and
wood beams. The hut leaned at an absurd angle, its
windows on the verge of shattering, but refusing to
topple. It was then that he noticed the fifth manne-
quin, its hands thrust before its face. He peered closer,
it wasn’t a mannequin. In a split second his brains
would be dashed out as he struck the crumbling con-
crete wall. But the split second did not pass and the
body did not continue its motion. Shocked by this
scene Darah tried to run, to escape the appalling
thoughts which preyed on his bodiless mind.

“Come with me, Marc,” a voice shattered the in-
cessant silence.

“Where are you? I can’t see you.” Marc whirled

56

around and an image formed in his mind.

“Concentrate on my image and the vision will not
fade.” The command was obeyed and the image re-
solved itself and once more began speaking. “Through
some freak coincidence you have been transported
through a time warp into a dimension which is parallel
to the earth’s. You have noticed you have no body.
In our dimension, all the hidden powers of the mind
have been devoloped over eons of time. Teleportation
is but a simple manuever and the mere physical exis-
tence of man is useless. You will become adjusted to
your new life in a short time and will realize how
clumsy the human body is. You must learn to peer
into the mind and plant an image, to project your
own thoughts clearly without distortion. I’m picking
up your projected image of —- I can’t make it out.
Your projection is too vague, too general, focus your
thoughts on me and only I will receive them. That’s
it, much better, but I’m afraid you must accustom
yourself to the fact that there is no food in our dimen-
sion. The mind feeds on the radiation of the sun‘ and
the planets. Another thing I must teach you —— you
are not bound by the limits of your planet. Your
mind now has access to the stars, the planets, the
Universe. Now we begin lesson one.”

In the days that followed, the mind, which once
was Marc Darah, absorbed more knowledge than it
ever could have in its earth-life. Teleportation came
easy. Then opening the mind to others and absorbing
radiation was mastered. The most difficult task was
creating mass from electrons and forming a synthetic
body for his mind. His first attempt at creation brought
only a mass of electrons, undulating under his beam
of concentration. Soon he formed the mass into a chair
and managed to stabilize the lattices. Simultaneously
he created a body for his mind. Before long, he was
able to create a multitude of objects and transform
himself into any shape. Then began his journey to
the stars.

A billion pinpoints of light blended into entity as
the speed of li-ght was attained. Minutes passed by and
the mind conntinued to hurtle through the infinity of
space. The spectra of light coiled and recoiled about
the warp created by the intersection of two dimensions.

Once again the stars and the mind of Marc Darah
emerged from the time warp. A planet, three times
the size of the earth, hung in space before the probing
thoughts of Darah and he began the process of entry
from the void to the atmosphere of the blue globe.

The mind was an amphibian, first darting under
the icy blue waters, probing into caverns and mentally
recording the habitat of the underwater denizens, and
then a lumbering beast, clumsily making its way
through a dense jungle of prehistoric looking trees and
plants. The beast gazed about the land it towered
over and thought to itself “This planet is another
earth, one hundred million years before man walked.”
The mind thrilled at the thought of creation. “How
much it must look like the earth.” Pangs of loneliness
swept over the prehistoric beast and it shuddered

momentarily. Its train of thought was interrupted by
a shattering roar and trampling of trees.

The fight for preservation is the oldest animal instinct
and two prehistoric mammoths tussling and tearing
with teeth the size of a man, was a common occurrence.
But one of these gargantuans was at a slight advantage
— it could think logically. A dying roar rendered the
air as the larger of the beasts lay on the ground, its
monstrous neck broken. The victor climbed from the
back of its attacker and pathetically nodded its mas-
sive head. Then it continued scouting the countryside.

Weeks passed and the new beast on the planet ac-
cumulated vast amounts of knowledge about prehistoric
life, priceless bits of information on the evolution of
life. Soon the beast tired of this planet and once again
began his journey to the st-ars.

The dull red sun hung low on the horizon of the
sixth planet of the ninety-third solar system in the
rim of the galaxy andromeda -— a cold planet, almost
void of life. A weird furry ball roll along the planet’s
surface, as miles and miles passed by. The scenery
remained the same —— a glacier covered planet.

“If this is all there is to see on this planet, I don’t
think I’ll stay around long.” The furry ball ground
to a stop and a pair of eyes on the end of spindly
stalks peared at its monotonous surroundings. “Hmm,
there seems to be an irregularity in the surface over
there.” The ball shifted to the right and slowed before
a slight mound in the ground. Realizing that the mound
was not composed of ice, like the rest of the plain, he
moved and stopped at the top.

Peering into the dome, the outline of a city could
barely be seen. The furry ball suddenly disappeared,
and a thin mist drifted the distance to the city streets.
Materializing into the form of a man, Darah began
walking down the polished metal road. “Beautiful
buildings, everywhere, in perfect condition and yet I
have not seen a living soul. This road seems to be
sloping down towards a lower level of the city. It’s
possible it leads to a main building. After all, all roads
lead to Rome.” He chuckled at his wit and continued
to explore the roadway. After walking for an hour,
he reached a point which seemed to be the center of
the city, a large mall in the center and roads branching
outwards as the spokes from a hub. In the center
stood a building reaching towards the domed ceiling.

At first, the darkness bothered Darah, but he soon
created light to enable him to see and began his ex-
ploration of the building. “Machinery! I’ve never seen
such complicated mechanisms. Let’s see, there seems

 

to be a plaque beneath it. Can’t read it because the
letters are foreign to me.” He continued his tour and
entered a soundproof room. Plush seats lined half the
room and Darah sat in one. On the back of the seat
in front of him was arranged a multitude of dials and
switches. “This seems to be some sort of theater. Well,
here goes nothing.” He pushed a button at random.
Nothing. He pushed another. This time, the lights dim-
med and a mechanical voice began speaking. Unable
to understand, Darah sat and waited. A screen lit up
and he seemed to be thrust into the creation of a world.

Once outside the building, Darah mulled over the
past four hours and the knowledge which he acquired
from the video he had just seen. “A world created and
the last city dying. I’ve just seen the life and death of
a civilization. How courageous, to spend the remainder
of their days preparing for death, and leaving an im-
maculate city to wear away and corrode under the
forces of time.” He walked on, as if in a dream, not
looking where he went or how far.

Falling space, and the universe, blended itself into
one image. Night and day became one and still the
mind plunged onward.

The mushroom cloud blossomed and reached into
the stratosphere. The heat and wind passed and only
the destruction remained. “This is test center to clean
up crews one and two, the bomb was premature. Pro-
ceed to Big Town and mop up. Calibrate geigers
and check in.”

‘‘_]-1 check,” and the first jeep pulled out.

“J-2 check,” and the second jeep followed through
the cloud of dust created by the first.

“We’re approaching the town. This will be the last
transmission for one hour.” The men, dressed like
spacemen, began probing the wreckage of the first
building, collecting the camera magazines as they found
them. Each of the three men checked a bungalow.
The fourth man man entered the remains of the block-
house. He paused and looked around at the twisted
wreckage and torn artificial limbs. Then the sight which
sent him reeling with horror — a man, or what remain-
ed of him —— lay in a dried pool of plasma. On his burnt,
mutilated face could be distinguished the semblance of
a smile, as if he knew something that no other living
soul had known.

Brockhurst left the hut and walked towards the
other members of the clean-up crew who were waiting
for his report. A wind began blowing, the sands began
shifting and somewhere, not far off, rests the mind of
a man who knows]

analog computers, an experimental
research project, economics, and fo-
reign travel are all included.
Fantastic advancements have been
made in science both in quantity
and quality during the last fifty
years. A great deal of this advance-
ment can be contributed to the elec-
tronic computers. In “Successor to
the Sliderule,” Dr. Ronald Schultz,
of the University of Pittsburgh’s
Electrical Engineering Department,
discusses the uses of the analog com-
puter in science and industry. He
also relates the development of the
analog computer from the time of
Lord Kevin to the present day.

True air suspension will be the
keynote to the car of the future.
Howard Wesoky’s most intriguing
article, “Future Without Wheels,”
describes the theory behind the new
Air-Car and how someday-we may
be able to travel at high speeds
while about 10 inches above the
ground.

Dr. Raymond Ric-hman in his ar-
ticle, “Engineers and Economists,”
discusses the place of the engineer
in the economy. He explains the four
basic principles of a movement called
“Technocracy” and how the en-
gineer once viewed himself as the
sole determinant of the uses of our
productive capacity. Dr. Richman

continues by investigating the pre-
sent day mechanism for determining
the allocation of the productive ca-
pacity and by placing the engineer
in proper perspective in this decision
making process.

“The cage of Tomorrow,” by Jer-
ry Leff is another in a series of
science fiction stories. Marc Darah
experiences another world complete-
ly different from the one we know.
He is the victim of a premature deto-
nation of a nuclear weapon. This
story relates the fascinating experi-
ences he encounters which are to
prepare him for this new world.

In “Melting Metals in Space,”
Terry Peltz relates how a metal liter-
ally suspended in space is melted by
a levitation machine constructed at
the University of Pittsburgh under
the guidance of Dr. Raymond C.
Craig and Dr. William Wallace. This
machine which is to be used exten-
sively in the Chemistry Department,
suspends a solid in space and melts
it without any visible means of sup-
port or contact. After being melted,
the metals are to be used in studies
of thermomagnetic properties.

Sylvania Encourages Scientific Heretics

Who Can Utilize Unique and Unorthodox Thinking in
Making State-of-the-Art Advances in Electronics, Electronic
Countermeasures, Metallurgy, Semiconductors, Radar,
Communications & Navigation Systems, Airborne Defense,
Missiles, Computers, Lighting, Radio, Television, Plastics,
Photography, Chemicals, Wire, Phosphors.

To the young engineer and scientist
who questions present hypotheses and
who can combine unorthodox percep-
tion with imagination, Sylvania ex-
tends a climate of achievement. From
these men, Sylvania foresees a number
of tomorrow’s breakthroughs. If your
ambition is to attain your fullest pro-
fessional potential, these facts about
Sylvania—one of the world’s fastest
growing industrial organizations —
merit your close attention.

Started as a basement industry
manufacturing incandescent lamps
only 59 years ago, Sylvania today has
23 laboratories and 46 plants located
in 14. states across the nation. These
69 modern facilities afford employ-
ment to over 30,000 people. In the
last 25 years sales have climbed from
$6,000,000 to over 1/3 of a billion dol-
lars. Strong as this industrial base is
for the engineer and scientist, it was
substantially reinforced in February
1959 when Sylvania merged with
General Telephone Corporation. The
merger of these two growth com-
panies will:

0 Increase ability to ﬁnance future
growth and development

0 Add further diversiﬁcation to al-
ready broad commercial and defense
product lines

0 Measurably increase research and
development facilities

0 Give Sylvania the benefit of
General Telephone’s wide experi-
ence and background in foreign
manufacturing and sales.

Sylvania Prizes Individuality

Sylvania’s success and reputation
have long been based on the belief

58

that the success of the organization
depends upon the personal success of
the individual. The engineer/scientist-
oriented management has given much
thought and study to provide an en-
vironment that kindles self-expression
and creativity. Here you are assigned
to a position where you can direct
your training toward its greatest po-
tential. Promotion from within the
company gives impetus to your pro-

fessional progress; assignments are-

frequently reviewed.

There is no predetermined pattern
of orientation, for the speed with
which this is accomplished is up to
the graduate; you are given a number
of assignments with increasing
responsibilities. Working directly
with a project leader or senior
engineer, you quickly confirm your
special abilities and aptitu-des.

Large-Organization Strength
With Small-Company
Flexibility

Each laboratory or plant is similar
to an independent business at Syl-
vania. Important decisions are made
on the operating level by technical
managers familiar with the problem
at hand, who appreciate and accur-
atelyevaluateindividualcontributions.

Whether your interests center on
engineer management or scientific
specialization, you will enjoy parallel
paths for development at Sylvania-
double opportunity to move forward
with equal reward and status. Syl-
vania encourages the publication of
research articles, active participation
in professional groups, attendance at

meetings of engineering and profes-
sional societies. It has long been
Sylvania’s philosophy that these “ex-
tracurricular” activities are of im-
measurable importance to both the
company and the individual, for com-
munication increases comprehension
and scientiﬁc curiosity—which are the
forces that spark experimentation and
discovery.

Continual Advances
In State-Of-The-Art

The success of Sylvania in the ad-
vanced areas of electronics has been
maintained over the years by scien-
tiﬁc and engineering excellence. Syl-
vania’s encouragement of uninhibited
technological thinking has led to a
number of important breakthroughs
across many technologies, such as:
Data Processing Systems; Com-
puters; Semiconductors; Electronic
Flash Approach System; Space Tech-
nology; Ceramic Stacked Tube;
Electroluminescence; Bonded Shield
Television Picture Tubes; Sarong
Cathode Coating; First 110° Televi-
sion Set.

Generous Beneﬁts

Sylvania’s belief in the well-being of
the individual has been amply dem-
onstrated by liberal employee policies.
Ranging from a savings and retire-
ment plan to ﬁnancial reimbursement
for graduate study, these policies have
helped set a standard for the elec-
tronics industry.

DEANE KEUCH
Purdue University '53

DEANE KEUCH, one of 136 Dunham-Bush sales
engineers, knows the advantages of being associated with a
dynamic young company with extensive product lines.

Following his engineering studies at Purdue, Deane joined
Dunham-Bush as a trainee and soon became an application
engineer. After a relatively short time he was assigned his own
territory, working out of the Cleveland area sales ofﬁce.

In calling on consulting engineers, architects, plant engineers,
wholesalers, contractors and building owners, Deane (like all
Dunham-Bush sales engineers) ﬁnds it reassuring to be backed by
his area oﬁice and the facilities of Dunham-Bush laboratories.

Equally reassuring is the availability of complete lines. The range

of Dunham-Bush refrigeration products runs from compressors

to complete systems; the range of air conditioning products

extends from motel room conditioners to a hospital’s entire air
conditioning plant. The heating line is equally complete: from a
radiator valve to zone heating control for an entire apartment
housing project. The Dunham-Bush product family even includes
specialized heat transfer products applicable to missile use.

G. Mr. Savage, should young engineers
ioin professional engineering socie-
ties?

By all means. Once engineers
have graduated from college
they are immediately “on the
outside looking in,” so to speak,
of a new social circle to which
they must earn their right to be-
long. Joining a professional or
technical society represents a
good entree.

How do these societies help young
engineers?

The members of these societies
-—mature, knowledgeable men—
have an obligation to instruct
those who follow after them.
Engineers and scientists—as pro-
fessional people——are custodians
of a specialized body or fund of
knowledge to which they have
three deﬁnite responsibilities.
The ﬁrst is to generate new
knowledge and add to this total
fund. The second is to utilize
this fund of knowledge in service
to society. The third is to teach
this knowledge to others, includ-
ing young engineers.

Specifically, what benefits accrue
from belonging to these groups?

A. There are many. For the young

engineer, affiliation serves the
practical purpose of exposing his
Work to appraisal by other scien-
tists and engineers. Most impor-
tant, however, technical societies
enable young engineers to learn
of work crucial to their own.
These organizations are a prime
source of ideas—meeting col-
leagues and talking with them,
reading reports, attending meet-
ings and lectures. And, for the
young engineer, recognition of
his accomplishments by asso-
ciates and organizations gener-
ally heads the list of his aspira-
tions. He derives satisfaction
from knowing that he has been
identiﬁed in his ﬁeld.

Interview with General Electric’s

Charles F. Savage

Consultant— Engineering Professional Relations

How Professional Societies

Help Develop Young Engineers

Q.

What contribution is the young en-
gineer expected to make as an ac-
tive member of technical and pro-
fessional societies?

A. First of all, he should become

active in helping’ promote the
objectives of a society by prepar-
ing and presenting timely, well-
conceived technical papers. He
should also become active in
organizational administration.
This is self-development at work,
for such efforts can enhance the
personal stature and reputation
of the individual. And, I might
add that professional develop-
ment is a continuous process,
starting prior to entering col-
lege and progressing beyond
retirement. Professional aspira-
tions may change but learning
covers a person’s entire life span.
And, of course, there are dues to
be paid. The amount is grad-
uated in terms of professional
stature gained and should al-
ways be considered as a personal
investment in his future.

How do you go about joining pro-
fessional groups?

While still in school, join student
chapters of societies right on
campus. Once an engineer is out
Working in industry, he should
contact local chapters of techni-
cal and professional societies, or
ﬁnd out about them from fellow
engineers.

Does General Electric encourage par-
ticipation in technical and profes-
sional societies?

It certainly does. General Elec-
tric progress is built upon cre-
ative ideas and innovations. The
Company goes to great lengths
to establish a climate and in-
centive to yield these results.
One way to get ideas is to en-

courage employees to join pro-
fessional societies. Why? Because
General Electric shares in recog-
nition accorded any of its indi-
vidual employees, as well as the
common pool of knowledge that
these engineers build up. It can’t
help but proﬁt by encouraging
such association, which sparks
and stimulates contributions.

Right now, sizeable numbers of
General Electric employees, at
all levels in the Company, belong
to engineering societies, hold re-
sponsible ofﬁces, serve on work-
ing committees and handle im-
portant assignments. Many are
recognized for their outstanding
contributions by honor and
medal awards.

These general observations em-
phasize that General Electric
does encourage participation. In
indication of the importance of
this view, the Company usually
defrays a portion of the expense
accrued by the men involved in
supporting the activities of these
various organizations. Remem-
ber, our goal is to see every man
advance to the full limit of his
capabilities. Encouraging him to
join Professional Societies is one
way to help him do so.

tivities of Cabinet and mentions
some of their plans for this school
year in “Trimester Challenges E &
M Cabinet.” In this article, Ray
examines the trimester program and
its effects on Cabinet.

Of the many fine activities spon-
sored by E & M Cabinet, the EM-
ITT program undoubtedly is one of
the better areas. Annually, an award
is made to at least one engineering
student for travel and training
abroad. Last year there were two
recipients of this award. In “EMI-
TT,” Hamilton Stirling and Bill
Blankenstein, last year’s recipients,
share their experiences in Turkey
and Germany, respectively, with
SKYSCRAPER readers.

Certain metals undergo a strange
transformation at temperatures near
absolute zero. Metals, formerly non-
conductors or very poor conductors,
pass electricity with negligible re-
sistance. Voltages introduced into
closed loops apparently flow forever.
These and other phenomena are ex-
amined by Bob Fatyol in “Super-
conductivity.” -

At the General Motors Research Laboratories, physicists employ
radioactive isotopes and other ultra-modern techniques and tools
in their search for new scientiﬁc knowledge and an understanding
of the many laws of nature that continue to perplex mankind.

Although a lot depends on a man’s ability, enthusiasm and
growth potential, there’s every chance for advancement in
many ﬁelds for General Motors scientists and engineers. There’s
virtually no limit to opportunity at GM. Fields of work are
as varied as radioactive isotope research, astronautics, auto-
mobiles, aircraft engines and inertial guidance systems—to
mention but a few.

If you wish to pursue postgraduate studies, GM offers ﬁnancial
aid. And since each GM division is autonomous yet related,
you can grow in two directions—up through your own division,
or to the side to other divisions.

HOW TO MAKE A “LEFT TURN” IN OUTER SPACE  

(and the "right turn” toward a gratifying career)

Like the dimensions of the universe
itself, the future of space technology
is beyond imagination. The fron-
tiers of space will edge farther and
farther from us as engineering and
scientiﬁc skills push our knowledge
closer to the stars. Bendix Aviation
Corporation, long a major factor in
America’s technological advance,
offers talented young men an out-
standing site from which to launch
a career.

In the ﬁeld of controls alone, for
example, Bendix (which makes con-
trols for almost everything that
rolls, ﬂies or ﬂoats) has developed
practical, precision equipment for
steering and controlling the atti-

tude of space vehicles. It consists
of a series of gas reaction controllers
(actually miniature rockets) which
are mounted around the satellite.
Individually controlled by a built-
in intelligence system, they emit
metered jets of gas on signal when-
ever it is necessary to change the
orientation of the satellite.

The development of this unique
control equipment is but one of the
many successful Bendix projects
involving knowledge of the outer
atmosphere and beyond. Bendix, a
major factor in broad industrial re-
search, development and manufac-
ture, is heavily engaged in advanced
missile and rocket systems and com-

ponents activities. These include
prime contract responsibility for
the N avy’s advanced missiles, Talos
and Eagle.

The many career opportunities
at Bendix include assignments in
electronics, electromechanics, ultra-
Sonics, computers, automation,
radar, nucleonics, combustion, air
navigation, hydraulics, instrumen-
tation, propulsion, metallurgy, com-
munications, carburetion, solid
state physics, aerophysics and
