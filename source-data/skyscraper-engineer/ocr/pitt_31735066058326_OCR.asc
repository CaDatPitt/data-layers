Have You

Boiled Your

Water Lately?

by Laurie Peach

In mid—February this year, the residents of the McKees-
port area found the nearest restroom to be their best
friend. A water borne creature, the Giardia lamblia paras-
ite, invaded the drinking water of McKeesport Municipal
Water Authority customers, causing an outbreak of the
intestinal illness Giardiasis or more commonly known as
”backpacker’s disease." (Symptoms included a sudden onset
of diarrhea, nausea, bloating of the stomach, loss of appe-
tite, rapid weight loss, and abdominal cramps.)

As illustrated in Figure 1, the Giardia parasite has a two
stage life cycle. Once outside its host's body, the organism
forms a protective coating around itself creating a ”cyst.”
The cyst can then survive for two to three months in cold
water areas with much turbulance, i.e., fresh water
streams and rivers. The parasite must be ingested by a
warm blooded animal through its drinking water in order
to regenerate and continue existence. Stomach acids in the
victim's body dissolve the protective outside shell. The cyst
then emerges as a trophozoite which attaches to the intes-
tines of humans and other mammals by means of suction.
The cycle is completed when the organism passes from the
host to the environment in the host's feces. A person with
an acute infection may have millions of the organisms in his
digestive tract, for each organism is only ten microns long
(or about 0.0004 of an inch).

Beaver, deer, dogs, and cats are the major source of
animal carriers which may have an impact on the water
supplies. The animals contract the disease at some outside
water source, then pass out some of the parasites through
their digestive systems and into bodies of water. Beavers
which dam rivers and reservoirs are the major culprits.

According to Jack Ashton, a chemist at the McKeesport
water treatment plant, the cyst was first known to be
contracted by hikers backpacking through the state of
Washington. These people drank the ”pure refreshing
stream water” without boiling or disinfecting it in any way.

The entire problem can be alleviated by proper filtering
and treatment of the water at the treatment plant. This is
largely an environmental engineering concern.

Most water treatment plants use local rivers as a water
source. The McKeesport area uses the Youghegeny River.
Water taken from the river then passes through an eight to
ten hour treatment process which should clear out any
infectious parasites. The McKeesport Water Plant is
equipped with anthracite coal beds with gravel underdrains
for proper settling and filtration. Before the time of the
giardiasis outbreak, however, the city experienced water-
line breaks during January causing levels of abnormally
high turbidity.

Because of these breaks, the volume of water pumped to
the residents had to be increased so that approximately 500
gallons per minute were passing through a one micron
filter; more than twice the normal amount. Normally,
water passes through the system, then is passed through a
second time. This process is knows as ”backwashing.” The
increased demand required that the backwashing stop be
eliminated. This allowed increased numbers of cysts to pass
through the municipal supply.

In order to disinfect the system, six parts per million of
chlorine had to be added to the ten million gallon a day
water supply. The water was then allowed to sit for 72
hours and flushed back into the river.

The problem with detecting the organism in a normal
body is that it leaves no definite calling card'until digested.
An infected water supply cannot be identified by appear-
ance only; it must be run through a series of tests which
take several days to complete. Also, there are only 4 special-
ized labs in the entire country that are designed to handle
the problem.

A person may not even know he has the disease until 1 to
4 weeks after contact — 2 weeks on the average. Infection
depends on the condition of the host as well as the cyst

itself. For some people, the disease may pass right out. For
others, if the disease is left untreated, it will appear on and
off indefinitely. If one finds himself with the symptoms
either atabrine or flagyl may be taken. Atabrine is the
preferred medicine since it produces fewer side effects.

But the best medicine is prevention, which is why all
campers, hikers, backpackers, and other nature lovers are
strongly advised to boil all drinking water for a minimum of
10 minutes, add iodine tablets to their water before drink-
ing and cooking, or carry their own supply.

People in the McKeesport area boiled, bought, borrowed
from friends, and stood in line for uncontaminated distilled
water. Children in the local school district had to bring
water from home. All water fountains and public water
sources we take for granted were turned off. Even with all
the precautions approximately 365 cases were reported.
From February 22 to May 12, residents boiled water. Some
even boiled their bath water.

Several weeks ago the Health Board again put a boiling
warning on the McKeesport water supply. This was a pre-
caution taken when the chemical feed machine broke
down, causing a high turbidity situation. Again the resi-
dents had to boil or buy their water for another 18 days.
Fortunately, no cysts were detected.

When the ban was finally lifted and the County Health
Authority gave its stamp of approval on the water supply
— a sigh of relief was heard all over the McKeesport area.
At least there will be a handful of people who will be
appreciative of their treated running tap water.

is diagrammed above. The first stage is the cyst form; the
second stage is the trophozoite.

Quarks and Gluons:
Physics for the 1990's

In this and the following article, Dr. Eugene Engels, ]r. of Pitt's
physics department presents a view of the world of the very small: the
subatomic realm of quarks and gluons. Dr. Engels received his B.S.
degree in physics at Cal Tech, was a scientific officer in the Air Forcefor
two years, and subsequently earned a Ph.D. at Princeton, while doing "a
fun thesis" concerning particle physics. He went on to teach at Harvard
from 1962 to 1970, then came to Pitt in the summer of 1970 in orderto
start an experimental high~energy physics group.

Regarding his role as a professor, Dr. Engels comments, "I love
teaching. Interacting with students helps keep you from getting old." He
also feels that "more of the gifted engineering students should enter
graduate programs in physics."

Elementary particle physics is one of the very exciting
and fast moving areas of physics research. During the
1930's it was established that the number of fundamental
particles equalled six: the proton, neutron, electron and its
anti—particle the positron, the neutrino and the gamma ray
or photon. However, since the second World War, the
advances in particle accelerator technology and detection
instrumentation have resulted in an increase in the number
of known particles to well above one hundred, providing
physicists with a ”zoo" of particles which are assigned such
exotic names as hyperons, strange mesons, charmed mesons bare
bottom particles and many others. Surely our everyday
world can be understood on the basis of atomic behavior
which involves only the original six particles, but the
advent of very high energy particle accelerators has pro-
vided us with sufficient proton and electron beam energies
to enable us to produce a large number of very massive
particles that live for a very short time, namely, in the
range of 1O—23to 10-5 seconds. Very sensitive and fast parti-
cle detectors have also been developed which enable us to
measure these masses and lifetimes. A history of the evolu-
tion of our understanding of the fundamental particles up
to the present would require considerably more space than
is available here and so Iwill restrict my goal to providing a
concise outline of our present understanding of the funda-
mental particles.

Historically it was felt that the fundamental interactions
that occur in nature fall into four separate categories. The
first category is the electromagnetic interaction which
results in the force between electrically-charged particles
such as exists between the electron and proton making up
the hydrogen atom. The emission of light by atoms, for
example, is a subject which falls into this category. The
second category is the weak interaction, or that interaction

responsible for the decay of radioactive nuclei or the decay
of an isolated neutron (a neutron not contained within an
atomic nucleus). The third category is the strong interac-
tion which results in the force between the protons and
neutrons in an atomic nucleus which holds the nucleus
together. The fourth and final interaction is the gravita-
tional interaction which becomes important when large
masses are being considered, and explains stellar structure,
expansion of the universe or why things fall towards the
center of the earth.

Since we are considering the fundamental particles
which have masses so small that the gravitational interac-
tion is minute compared to the other three, we will not
consider the gravitational interaction further. In the 1960's
physicists developed a theory of the electroweak interaction
which combines the electromagnetic and weak interactions
into a single interaction so that light emisssion and ndclear
radioactivity are different manifestations of the same phe-
nomenon. The success of the electroweak theory depended
on the existence of a family of particles that includes the
photon and three additional particles named the intermediate
vector bosons. Although the photon has been with us for most
of the twentieth century, the intermediate vector bosons
had yet to be discovered. These three particles, the W+, W—,
Z0, were very recently discovered (1983) at the high energy
physics laboratory (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. We
shall not dwell further on the electroweak interaction but
rather turn our attention to the strong interaction which is
the main thrust of this article.

Those particles that participate in the strong interactions
are called hadrons. They include the proton and neutron and
a large group of particles called hyperons which are more
massive than the proton or neutron and which include the
/\° (lambda) particle, the 2+, {and Z°(sigma) particles, the 5°
and E" (cascade) particles and the Q'(omega) particle. The 0,
+ or — superscript which appears above the Greek letter
represents the amount of electronic charge carried by the
particle; e.g., the 2' particle has a negative charge equal in
magnitude to the charge of one electron. The A° particle is
electrically neutral. We now complete the nomenclature
for the zoo of particles that we are considering. The proton
and neutron are very similar particles except for their
charge, and are referred to as nucleons. All of the hadrons
whose masses are equal to or greater than the nucleon are
called baryons. Those hadrons whose masses are 1955 than
the nucleon are called mesons. Table 1 shows a representa-
tive group of hadrons along with their masses, expressed in
units of the mass of the proton.

Quarks

The particles shown in Table 1 are only a very small
sample of the total number of particles that we know about
today. Nevertheless, one is impressed by the complexity of
this sample and one wonders whether there is some very
simple underlying structure common to all of these parti-
cles. The answer to this question was proposed in the early
1960's and it was conjectured that all of the particles shown
in Table 1 (and more) can be constructed with just three
fundamental objects called quarks. Along with their masses,
the particles tabulated are characterized by their charge,
their intrinsic angular momentum or spin, and by a number
which is equal to 1 for baryons and O for mesons. This latter
quantity is called baryon number. Along with every particle
that we know about, one can produce its antiparticle. The
antiparticle is obtained by changing the sign of the charge
of the particle as well as assigning to it a baryon number of
opposite sign. For example, the antiproton has a negative
charge with magnitude equal to the charge of one electron
and has a baryon number equal to -1. The antineutron,
however, has the same charge as the neutron because (-1)
times the neutron charge = -1 x O = O. The baryon number
of the antineutron is, however, -1. The baryon number of
mesons as well as anti—mesons is O. The reaction indicated
below describes a collision between a high energy proton
emerging from a particle accelerator and a stationary
proton, resulting in the production of an antiproton.

Below the reaction is listed the charge, given in units of a
positive electonic charge, and the baryon number of each of
the particles before and after the collision. In a strong
interaction, both total charge and total baryon number
must be conserved during the collision. In the above reac-
tion, the two protons before the collision have a net charge
of +2, and the three protons and the antiproton after the

collision have a net charge of +2. Likewise, the baryon
number of the system of particles before and after the
collison equals +2. It appears in the above collision that
mass is being created and this is indeed true, since some of
the energy" of the incident high energy proton has been
converted into the mass of a third proton and the anti-
proton. We must now accept the fact that for every particle
that we know about, there exists an antiparticle which can
also be produced at modern high energy physics
laboratories.

What are quarks? They are perhaps the fundamental
constituents of which hadrons are made. The present pic-
ture of the quark is that it has a fraction of the charge ofan
electron and has a baryon number equal to 1/3. We think at
present that there are six quarks but perhaps there are
more. In addition, each quark has its anti-quark which has a
charge opposite in sign to the quark and a baryon number
equal to —1I3. Table 2 is a tabulation of these six quarks and
their anti—quarks. The six quarks have been assigned
names which are essentially unrelated to any property that
the quark might have but these names are now universally
used and we include them in Table 2.

Returning now to Table 1, we see that a proton can be
made up of two u quarks and a d quark, yielding a total
charge of 2 x (+2/3)e — (1/3)e = +e and total baryon number
equal to 3 x (+1/3) = +1. The neutron is made up of one u
quark and two d quarks, yielding a total charge of +(2/3)e +
2x(—1l3)e = O and total baryon number to 3 x (+1/3) = +1.
The hyperons require an additional quark, the s quark,
because an additional quantum n-umber is required to des-
cribe the process by which they are produced. The mesons
are formed by combining a quark and an antiquark so as to
yield a baryon number equal to O. Needless to say, the fact
that we can construct all of the particles presented in Table
1 by appropriately combining just three quarks and their
antiquarks presents an enormous simplification. There are
many additional hadrons which contain c, b and most prob-
ably t quarks but we will not discuss them here. Although
attempts to produce particles containing the t quark have
previously been unsuccessful, it appears that just such
particles have recently been observed at the high energy
laboratory at CERN.

Gluon and Quark Physics
at Pitt

by Eugene Engels

Physicists at Pitt are currently involved in an experiment
to study proton and gluon emission in very high energy
collisions at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
(Fermilab) located in Batavia, Illinois, some 30 miles west of
Chicago. Fermilab has recently succeeded in producing the
world's highest energy photon and pion beams using a
particle accelerator which is a synchrotron and which consists
almost entirely of superconducting elements that enable
high magnetic fields to be obtained with very low power
cost. The accelerator has been dubbed the Tevatron because
the protons which it accelerates reach an energy of almost a
trillion electron volts which is more than twice the energy
achievable at CERN and is twice the energy previously
attainable at Fermilab. The experiment is a collaboration
between several universities in addition to physicists at
Fermilab and includes Delhi University, Fermilab, Michi-
gan State University, the University of Minnesota, Nor-
theastern University, Penn State University, the
University of Pittsburgh and the University of Rochester.

Physics Department faculty from Pitt participating in the
experiment include Wilfred E. Cleland, Darryl Coon, Paul
F. Shepard and Julia Thompson , in addition to the author.
Graduate students working on the experiment include
Sudhindra Mani and Donald Plants and undergraduates
Richard Wilkins and Timothy Manns are assisting in the
design and construction of the instrumentation.

To summarize the physics of interest, one of the quarks
or antiquarks contained within the incident beam particle
will sometimes strike a quark contained in one of the prot-
ons or neutrons within a target nucleus. Emitted as a result
of this collision will sometimes be a gluon which ”dresses”
itself as a hadron shower. Any collision process which can
emit a gluon can also emit a photon and the study of
photons emerging as the product of such collisions is of
great interest because photons emerge as a single particle
rather than as a complicated shower of particles as does the
gluon. An experiment which is sensitive to both single
photon and gluon emission will undoubtedly add a great

deal to our knowledge about quantum chromodynamics.
Experiment E706 at Fermilab is just such an experiment.
This experiment, funded by both the Department of
Energy and the National Science Foundation, will answer
experimentally many basic questions, e.g., what is the
momentum distribution of the quarks within the hadron?
or how does the gluon dress itself upon emerging from a
collision between quarks? At present the theory of quan-
tum chromodynamics does not enable us to predict the
answers to these questions in advance, and so the answers
must be found experimentally. Hopefully, this will result in
eventual refinements in the theory.

Figure 1 is a sketch of the apparatus that will be used in
the experiment. The apparatus is referred to as a spectrometer
and is used to measure the production angle of particles
produced in a collision relative to the beam direction as well
as the energy of each of these particles. Since a photon has
no electric charge it can only be observed by the liquid
argon calorimeter (LAC). The LAC consists in part of thin
lead sheets immersed in a liquid argon bath and sandwiched
between electrodes which detect an electrical signal whe-
never the photon produces a shower of electrons and posi-
trons in the lead plates. The large multiplicity of charged
hadrons that is produced along with the photon are first
detected by the silicon strip detector system which flanks
the target. The hadrons then pass through the large elec-
tromagnet which causes each of them to change direction
slightly before entering the next set of detectors which are

11

planes of proportional wire chambers. The silicon strip
detectors and proportional wire chambers along with the
magnet enable the measurement of the momentum of each
of the charged hadrons. Finally, the hadrons enter the
liquid argon calorimeter where they are absorbed by
nuclear interactions in the iron plates at the rear of the
calorimeter and a measurement of the energy of each had-
ron is thus made in the LAC. A large hole appears at the
center of the LAC, allowing a substantial number of had-
rons to pass through the LAC undetected but these parti-
cles are subsequently detected by the scintillation calorimeter
which is the most downstream detectorof the apparatus.
Design, construction, commissioning and maintenance of
each of the elements of the spectrometer is the responsiblil-
ity of one or more of the institutions involved. The Pitt
group has the responsiblility for providing the silicon strip
detector system which is the most upstream element of the
apparatus.

What is a silicon strip detector? The basic structure of
this kind of detector is a silicon wafer which has a thickness
of about 0.3 millimeters and an area of the order of several
square centimeters. Figure 2 shows such a wafer viewed
from its side. One surface (the bottom surface as shown in
Figure 2) is doped with a donor (n—type) material, either
phosphorus or arsenic, and this dopant extends into the
silicon wafer to a depth of about 1 micron which is not
shown to scale in the figure. (1 micron = 10-6 meters and is
usually written as lum.) The bulk of the wafer is referred to
as the intrinsic or i—region and is very lightly doped, also
with an n-type material. The opposite surface of the wafer
is not uniformly doped, but the doping, which is an acceptor
or p—type material such as boron, is deposited in strips
which appear end—on as seen in the figure. It is primarily
the transition region between the p-doped lines and the
i—region which forms the semiconducting diode. This kind
of diode is referred to as a p-i-n diode. A reverse bias
voltage of about 100 volts is applied across the wafer,
resulting in an almost uniform electric field appearing
throughout the bulk of the i—region. Connected to each of
the p-doped lines is a charge-sensitive preamplifier. Whe-
never a charged particle passes through the wafer, some of
the silicon atoms along the path of the ionizing particle will
have one or more of their electrons removed, thereby
creating an electron—hole pair. Rather than recombine to
form a neutral atom, the presence of the electric field will
cause the holes to drift towards the p-doped lines and the
electrons to drift towards the n-doped surface. The arrival
of the holes at the p-doped lines and their subsequent entry
into the corresponding preamplifier constitutes a faint
electrical signal which will be amplified through not only
the preamplifier shown but a second stage of amplification
as well. Hence a single wafer serves to locate the point of
traversal of a particle to 50um in a direction perpendicular
to the p-doped lines but yields no spatial information along
a direction parallel to the lines. Clearly two wafers with
their lines oriented perpendicular to one another are
required to establish the point of traversal in two dimen-
sions. A pair of wafers, used in this fashion, are referred to
as an X—Y module. A single wafer so used to detect the
traversal of ionizing radiation is called a silicon strip detector.

The University of Pittsburgh has
an incredible diversity of programs,
resources, and opportunities. The
main campus is located in Oakland,
the cultural heart of a large and
growing city, home to abundant in-
dustries and a world-renowned
medical system. The University
itself consists of more than a dozen
schools, and undergraduates may
major in more than 50 areas, in-
cluding joint majors and self-
designed programs.

Pitt is also committed to the de-
velopment of projects to maintain
the University as a vital, multi-
faceted center for research and
high-quality education. An example
is the recently created Western
Pennsylvania Advanced Technology
Center, established to encourage
the development of high-technology
industry and to support cooperative
research between industry and the

University. Formed by the University
of Pittsburgh and Carnegie-Mellon
University, the center is funded by
the Ben Franklin Partnership of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Another major innovation, already
underway, is Pitt’s “campus of the
future” project, a cooperative pro-
gram with AT&T to provide on cam-
pus an extensive light-fiber com-
munication network capable of car-
rying audio, video, and computer
data and linking dorms, classrooms,
computer centers, and libraries.
While the entire University pro-
vides education for roughly 35,000
students, the freshman engineering
class numbers about 425 students.
The School of Engineering thus pro-
vides the attractive advantage of a
small-school community of students
and faculty within the dynamic en-
vironment of a major research-
oriented university. in addition,

since Pitt is state-related, tuition for
Pennsylvania residents is signifi-
cantly lower than at private schools.

A tremendous advantage Pitt’s
engineering school offers is the
wealth of practical experience pro-
vided by its programs. In every
department, hands-on laboratory
and project experience demon-
strates, reinforces, and applies
theoretical knowledge. Senior
projects explore areas of interest in-
depth and provide fascinating and
valuable insights in research and
design. Such opportunities help
Pitt’s students acquire engineering’s
most valuable skill: the ability to
apply knowledge learned in the
classroom toward the solution of the
real problems of our world.

Physics 4 and 5 are calculus-
based courses with highlights in-
cluding forces, rotational motion,
conservation of energy, basic
Newtonian mechanics, and static
electricity. Chemistry 96 and 97
begin with atomic structure, electron
repulsion, pairing and distribution,
orbital shapes and sizes, and move
to molecular structure. Mathematics
22 covers differential and basic in-
tegration; Mathematics 23, detailed
methods of integration, analytical
geometry, and sequences and
series. Engineering 9 provides the
student with a working knowledge
of FORTRAN, the engineering com-
puter language. Engineering 10
begins with instruction in computer
graphics and moves to the basic
principles important to each engi-
neering specialty.

Pitt Computer Systems

All students may have access to the University’s excellent main
academic and research computing system (the DEC System 10)
and a separate, recently installed system used for student pro-
gramming instruction (the VAX). The DEC System 10 utilizes two
separate tri-processor (KL10) DEC System 1099s. ‘

Some of the system's features include:

97 public dial-up phone lines
A high quality Zeta multicolor pen plotter and a Trilog dot-

15 public dial-up phone lines

Students may access the DEC System 10 via remote job entry
sites (RJES) located in seven buildings on the Pittsburgh Campus,
including Benedum Engineering Hall. It is also possible for stu-
dents to arrange for access by telephone using a personal com-
puter or terminal equipped with an asynchronous modem. This is
particularly convenient for commuting students.

The computer center also maintains 24 DEC PRO 350 micro-
computers in the Micro Site, room 569 of Benedum Engineering
Hall. Use of these computers is open to all students, faculty, and

6.045-billion bytes of on-line disk storage

A Floating Point Systems 190L array processor

The VAX system incorporates:
2 VAX 11/780 super minicomputers
12 megabytes of main memory
3.564-billion bytes of on-line disk storage

In addition, the freshman engineering program and several engi-
neering departments maintain IBM Personal Computers for student
use. Engineering 9 and 10 assignments are completed on the
PCs using “Waterloo FORTRAN.”

English and philosophy courses
are basic ones designed to provide
the prospective engineer with an
understanding of literature and
thought. Some authors read include
Nietzsche, Freud, Descartes,
Thoreau, and Joyce. Pitt’s philos-
ophy department is ranked among
the top five*, and generally courses
may be taken with the same pro-
fessors who made the department
so renowned.

Freshman seminar meets once a
week and is a time for all the
freshman engineers to get together
‘The Gourman Report, A Rating of Graduate and Profes-
sional Schools in America and International Universities,
second edition revised, 1983, ranks the graduate program

in the top five and the undergraduate program 11th in a
field of 42.

to learn what engineering really is.
The different departments in the en-
gineering school present programs
explaining their fields of engineer-
ing, and time is provided for impor-
tant announcements—when the
skating party will be held, when
finals begin, who is the featured
speaker at the next Omni lecture.
During the second term, a portion
of the seminar is set aside to plan
for Engineers’ Week competition.
Most of the courses are lec-

ture/recitation. Classes meet two or
three hours a week in a large lec-
ture hall, and once a week a small
group of about 25 students gather
with the professor or graduate
teaching assistant for in-depth

discussions. These recitations are
extremely informative and should be
attended religiously. This is a time
to turn in homework, go over old
and new assignments, take quizzes,
and answer questions not resolved
in the lectures.

If you need a little help with your
studies, most honorary societies,
such as Tau Beta Pi, departmental
honoraries, and Phi Eta Sigma, of-
fer tutoring. The Black Engineering
Council has a Big-Brother/Big-
Sister Program as well. The Pitt
Engineering Impact Program (PEIP)
is a tutoring-counseling program
established to encourage engineer-
ing as a career for minority and
other students not traditionally at-
tracted to the field. Prior to entering
the freshman program, some PEIP
students attend a six-week summer
session designed to reinforce good
study skills and upgrade skills in
mathematics, physics, and
chemistry.

Scholarships

The University has a variety of
dormitory living arrangements:
Towers A and B are co-ed with two

people per room;

Tower C is co-ed and has single
rooms;

Holland is for women only and has
rooms for two or three people;
Forbes is co-ed with single rooms

and rooms for three people;
Lothrop is co-ed and has single

rooms.
Various special units are available,
such as the international unit, the
quiet-living floors, and the student-
engineering unit (SEU) floors (per-
haps the best place to spend one’s
freshman year).

Advantages of living with a group
of fellow future engineers are
generally obvious. The floors are
quieter because engineers have to
hit the books pretty hard. If a
physics problem refuses to solve
itself, there is always someone
somewhere on the four SEU floors
who can help untangle it. A less ob-
vious advantage is that many of the
engineering students stay on the
SEU floors for their sophomore
year. For a new student, this
association with older students who
are settled into college living can
make one feel more comfortable.

Not everyone in the SEU is study-

ing engineering, since the floors are
open to any science or medical-
profession major. An engineering
major may have a roommate in
another discipline.

Meals are served in the lower
level of the Towers and at Lothrop
Dining Hall. Freshmen may pur-
chase a weekly 19-meal plan (every
meal) or a 14-meal plan, for those
who go home weekends or do not
expect to make it to breakfast often.

Because University housing is
limited, it is important to apply and
matriculate as early as possible.

One hundred Merit Scholarships
($500 per year) and 50 Provost
Scholarships ($1,000 per year) are
awarded each year to outstanding
students based on their academic
qualifications. About ten especially
well qualified students are chosen
to receive the prestigious Chan-
cel|or’s Scholarship, a four-year
award which includes full tuition,
fees, room and board. The only re-
quirement for consideration for
these scholarships is for a student
to have applied for admission by
January 1.

In addition, Pitt holds math and
social sciences Provost competi-
tions regularly. High scorers on
these exams are also granted
scholarships.

The School of Engineering spon-
sors approximately 30 Freshman
Honor Scholarships ($500, $1,000,
and $2,000 per year). All steps in
the Freshman Honor Scholarship
process (including forwarding of
high school transcripts, letters of
recommendation, and receipt of the
applicant’s completed scholarship
application form in the Freshman
‘and Transition Programs office)
must be completed by February 15.

The Fessenden-Trott Scholarship
is awarded annually to an incoming
engineering freshman. This grant is
$5,000 a year for four years.

The School of Engineering also
offers many industrially sponsored
scholarships at the departmental
level.

Further details are available from
the Freshman and Transition Pro-
grams office and from the individual
engineering departments.

If you are a student of high in-
tellectual curiosity and ability, you’re
a natural for the University Honors
Program (UHP). This outstanding
and enriching program unites high-
calibre faculty with students seeking
academic excellence and fosters a
sense of community, friendship, and
enhanced interaction among its
faculty, students, and advisers.

Functioning as an autonomous
organization directly under the Pro-
vost, UHP crosses departmental
and school boundaries to provide
honors courses in a wide range of
disciplines.

Part of UHP, and of special in-
terest to engineering students, is
the Sophomore Honors in Engineer-
ing (SHE) program, co-sponsored
by UHP and the School of
Engineering, for specially selected
undergraduate engineering students
in their first three terms at Pitt.

What Are Honors
Courses?

Honors courses are designed for
students desiring the finest educa-
tional experience available to them.
They are challenging, demanding,
and highly rewarding. They may be
richer and more comprehensive ver-
sions of regular departmental
courses, or they may be unique in
content. For example, honors sec-
tions exist for most introductory
courses in mathematics and the life

U

and physical sciences. A multitude
of fascinating courses are offered in
the humanities (such as English,
music, philosophy, languages) and
the social sciences (including
economics, anthropology, and
history). Class sizes are generally
smaller than non-honors courses
and allow closer communication
among faculty and students—a
tremendously important asset,
since, in the classroom, “com-
munication” and ‘‘learning’’ mean
essentially the same thing. In addi-
tion, UHP courses carry a special
designation on a student’s academic
transcript.

Honors courses require more
work than non-honors courses.
They are not (with a few exceptions)
accelerated courses, and most re-
quire no special prerequisites.
Rather, these courses challenge,
motivate, and supply additional in-
formation and applications beyond
the coverage of a standard course
to allow development of a student’s
full potential. Thinking, reasoning,
and analysis are stressed, rather
than rote learning. What do we
believe we know? How sure are we
of our knowledge? How may we
apply abstract theory to the solution
of “real-world” problems? These are
questions addressed by UHP
courses.

Who Teaches Honors
Courses?

The faculty who teach UHP
courses are enthusiastic, concerned
about their students, and among
the best in their departments. They
are people who want to teach in
UHP and whose course proposals
must have the approval of the
Honors Center. Their courses are
constantly monitored and evaluated
by the students to ensure that they
provide effective and rewarding
education. In addition, students are
encouraged to submit proposals for
courses they would like to have of-
fered. Thus, students in UHP
courses provide direct feedback and
have a powerful impact on the

”I think that the Universi-
ty Honors Program is the
single most important
drawing point for out-
standing engineering
students. UHP has started
to change the character of
our undergraduate engi-
neering classes. It has
drawn more and better
students to Pitt. ”—Joel
Falk, Professor of Elec-
trical Engineering

quality of their instruction.

In honors classes, students and facul-
ty often become friends, sharers in a
common experience of exploration and
learning. As UHP physics professor
Eugene Engles enthusiastically com-
ments, “I love to have my students
argue with me.”

Who Can Take Honors
Courses?

All qualified undergraduates at
Pitt are welcome to take UHP
courses. Special permission from
the Honors Center is required, how-
ever. A student’s academic record,
special talents, and capabilities are
considered. New students who were
in the top ten per cent of their high
school classes and have total min-
imum SAT scores of 1200 qualify
automatically. After the first term, a
student is eligible if his or her
cumulative grade point average is
3.25 (B+) or higher. Policies are
flexible, however, and any student
interested in a particular honors
course is strongly encouraged to
seek special permission from the
Honors Center. The goal of UHP is
to provide first-rate educational op-
portunities for all students who
desire to learn.

”During the fall term,
1982, I had the pleasure
of teaching Physics 76.
which is a University
Honors Program offering. I
was astonished by the
high quality of the
students enrolled in my
course. These superb
students made the term a
memorable one for me.
They are highly motivated
and exert great pressure
on one another to excel.
There is an esprit de corps
among them which I find
remarkable. ”—Eugene
Engels, Jr., Professor of
Physics

What Is the Sophomore
Honors in Engineering
Program?

Remarkable, dynamic, challeng-
ing, rewarding and many other
positive adjectives. SHE provides a
unique opportunity for you to gain a
solid foundation and broad perspec-
tive in many crucial disciplines, in-
cluding English, physics, chemistry,
mathematics, philosophy, and basic
engineering, during your first three
terms of study at Pitt.

As a participant in SHE, you will
have as classmates and associates
students whose abilities and desire
for knowledge (though not neces-
sarily opinions!) are comparable to
your own. Admission to the program
is competitive, with selection based
on careful consideration of each ap-
p|icant’s high school record, SAT
scores, extra-curricular interests, a
brief essay, and an informal
interview.

Students most likely to benefit
from SHE are those who enjoy
science and mathematics, thinking,
writing, and the exploration of ideas
with faculty and intellectual peers.
SHE members, as well as all other
UHP participants, benefit from the
special advising and career coun-
seling offered by UHP staff.

Most importantly, while in no way

isolated from the larger University
community, SHE provides a suppor-
tive and friendly small-group atmos-
phere at the beginning of college
life which has the potential to ex-
tend far beyond the formal three
terms of the program.

”Through the SHE pro-
gram you can get an Ivy
League education at a
state school price. ”—John
C. Gargani, SHE Member
1982-83

Many chemical engineering
courses at Pitt are similar to those
offered by other schools accredited
by the Accreditation Board for Engi-
neering and Technology (ABET):
physical chemistry, transport phe-
nomena, and a formidable mass of
thermodynamics. A major difference
at Pitt is the student’s ability to fine-
tune the coursework to his or her
own areas of interest. During the
junior and senior years, for exam-
ple, students may choose a group
of technical electives which allow
for in-depth study in a particular

subdivision of chemical engineering:

petroleum, polymer, environmental,
biological, or nuclear engineering.
Petroleum engineering is a cer-
tificate program in which a student
who has completed the course of
study receives written recognition
from the department. Four electives
must be taken along with a geology
course, which replaces a chemical
engineering course on professional
problems. The electives present the
mechanics of petroleum reserves

and examine the properties of res-
ervoir fluids and oi|—bearing rock for-
mations. By the senior year, the
recovery of oil, using methods such
as steam and in-ground explosions,
is studied.

The polymer specialty is defined
by four technical electives in the im-
portant material of the future:
plastic. Topics cover the chemistry
and mechanics of polymers and
various methods of forming polymer
molds, fibers, and films. The
polymer specialty will be a cer-
tificate program within two years.

Environmental engineering re-
quires two courses in air and water
pollution and two courses from the
civil engineering department and
the industrial and environmental
health sciences department of the
Graduate School of Public Health.

Biological specialty courses vary
according to a student’s interest but
generally take one of three direc-
tions: biomedical, applied micro-
biology, or applied biochemistry.
Biomedical engineering analyzes

the body and measures such pro-
cesses as fluid flow, applying
physics principles to design and
produce useful prosthetics. Applied
microbiology uses micro-organisms
to do the drudgery of chemical con-
version and refinement, while
biochemistry develops processes
via non-living enzymes and
catalysts.

The nuclear engineering specialty
is defined by four technical elec-
tives examining pollution, nuclear
waste disposal, and reactor design
and operation.

Laboratory experience is an im-
portant part of engineering educa-
tion at Pitt, and a vast array of lab
equipment is available within the
department. The Bevier core anal-
ysis laboratory, for example, pro-
vides the capability of conducting
fluid saturation tests of oil-well core
samples as well as measuring P-V-T
(pressure-volume-temperature) prop-
erties. Among newer equipment ac-
quisitions is a magnetic resonance
(NMR) analysis machine which iden-
tifies a hydrogen-bearing compound
through analysis of the magnetically
induced resonances between the
hydrogen within the molecule.

Perhaps the identifying
characteristic of chemical engineer-
ing at Pitt is its emphasis toward
applications. Dr. James Cobb, Jr.,
associate professor of chemical and
petroleum engineering and under-
graduate program coordinator, ex-
presses the belief that a broad
spectrum of students can best be
educated with an amalgam of
theory and application. “On one end
of the scale,” he comments, “elite
students have the opportunity,
through the honors program and re-
search possibilities with the faculty,
to establish their own approach.
However, with Pitt’s hands-on ap-
proach, the student is well prepared
to work in industry after graduation.
We’re proud that we turn out a
spectrum of prepared students.”

Patrick Flaherty

Civil Engineering Department

The words civil engineer and
bridge seem to go hand-in-hand.
Those who enjoy playing with erec-
tor sets and Legos as children may,
indeed, be looked upon as the future
builders of America. As civil engi-
neers, they expand those original,
flimsy designs into national high-
ways, public hospitals, reservoirs,
office buildings, and other facilities.
In addition to structures and founda-
tions, civil engineering encompasses
hydraulic and water resource anal-
ysis, transportation systems, geo-
technology, and environmental engi-
neering. And the dimensions of civil
engineering are ever increasing. At
present, the deterioration of bridges,
roads, sewage plants, airports, and
waterways is a national problem,
and civil engineers are becoming
more and more involved in
infrastructure.

To keep up with this current de-
velopment in civil engineering, Pitt’s
curriculum is placing more em-
phasis on the repair, replacement,
and maintenance of structures. The
student learns general principles
needed for all engineering disci-
plines plus the basics of his or her
specialty. Exposure to other special-
ties is acquired through required
and elective courses offered by the
other departments in the school. As
a senior, a student may further pur-
sue a particular field of interest
through a series of technical
electives.

As a supplement to classroom in-
struction, laboratory sessions are of-
fered in virtually every area. Survey-
ing, perhaps the most popular under-
graduate lab, allows students to
have a class outdoors three to five
hours a week. Also exciting and in-
formative are soil mechanics labs,
where different soils are mixed,
molded, and tested for strength,
moisture content, stress, and work-
ability. Other labs include wind tun-
nels, a 40-foot hydraulic channel, a
complete two-story structural test
floor, and elaborate concrete and
mortar strength-testing devices.

Several co-op programs with the
Army Corps of Engineers and the

Pennsylvania and Nevada depart-
ments of transportation provide
students with both summer employ-
ment and engineering experience.
Sophomores and juniors are eligible
to apply for this four-month, on-the-
job training with the option of full-
time employment upon graduation.
The department also maintains
close contact with the professional
community and can assist students
with other career opportunities. The
American Society of Civil Engineers
is located only 15 minutes from
campus. This organization brings
together students and prospective
employees, and provides meetings
and dinners with professional
engineers, giving students a better
feel for what can be expected in the
world beyond the college campus.

Presently the department boasts
more than 200 undergraduates who
share a ninth-floor home in
Benedum Hall. This includes a
private student room furnished with
a couch (great for nap-taking), an
easy chair, study table, and a filing
cabinet containing old exams and
notes.

With the advantages of location,
hands-on experience, an excellent
faculty and staff, job placement ser-
vices, a wide variety of laboratory
facilities and a great group of peo-
ple, there is little that the University
of Pittsburgh’s Department of Civil
Engineering doesn’t offer for the
education and support of its under-
graduate students.

Laurie Peach

Electrical Engineering Department

Electrical engineering is a
discipline whose products have rev-
olutionized our world in ways that
were the stuff of science fiction not
long ago. Microprocessor, computer,
and robotic technology have trans-
formed our industries, entertain-
ment, communication systems,
financial institutions, and medical
facilities. The influence of solid-state
electronics and compact computing
devices is so far reaching that
essentially all areas of modern tech-
nology—and particularly all fields of
engineering—depend upon electrical
systems for control, communication,
and information processing. Elec-
trical engineering provides motors
for machinists, video technology
and electronic music for artists,
diagnostic aids and laser surgical
instruments for physicians. With
such incredible applications, it is lit-
tle wonder that electrical engineer-
ing is a dynamic and rapidly grow-
ing field.

The University of Pittsburgh’s De-
partment of Electrical Engineering
has a broad and challenging cur-
riculum which:

- Provides a solid foundation in the
physical sciences and
mathematics;

0 Introduces the fundamental elec-
trical engineering areas of basic
circuit theory, digital logic and
microprocessors, computer ap-
plications, electronics, signal pro-
cessing, machinery and control
theory, electromagnetics and
communications;

0 Offers an option in computer
engineering for specialization in
microprocessors and computers;

0 Provides a wealth of practical
laboratory experience allowing
hands-on experience;

0 Includes elective-course oppor-
tunities to allow both specializing
within the department and broad-
ening of a student’s education in
the areas of humanities and
social sciences.

One of the strengths of Pitt’s pro-
gram is its effective use of labs to

demonstrate and explore principles
learned in the lectures. As the
sophomore year begins, you will
learn the basic principles of digital
logic and circuit theory. Then, in the
second term, the structure and pro-
gramming of microprocessors is
taught, more advanced circuit
theory is developed, and the theory
and operation of basic semiconduc-
tor devices, such as the diode and
transistor, are presented. In the
junior year, a course in signals and
systems develops the concepts of
sampling, analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog conversion. At the
same time, a laboratory offers
hands-on experience with
measurements and signal process-

 

ing. Generally working in groups of
three, students perform experiments
with excellent test equipment and
microprocessors that require the ap-
plication of knowledge gained in the
classroom. It is in the laboratory
that one’s creativity (and sometimes
patience) is challenged, and a stu-
dent realizes that calculus, physics,
and electrical engineering principles
can, indeed, be used to build and
predict the behavior of things in the
real world.

Undergraduates may work with
faculty on special projects or senior
projects focused on students’ spe-
cific interests. A student could work
with microprocessor programming
and interfacing, control of a robotic
arm, stable electric power genera-
tion from a bicycle, the design of a

music synthesizer, or virtually any
topic relevant to electrical engineer-
ing. in addition, the rich variety of
the University provides a wealth of
opportunities to work in other
departments including chemistry,
biology, and physics and within the
medical school. Electrical engineer-
ing students at Pitt also benefit
from the University's extensive com-
puter facilities. A remote job entry
(RJE) station is conveniently located
on the tenth floor of Benedum Hall,
providing quick access to the com-
puter system.

The department offers excellent
opportunities to develop leadership
and organizational skills through ac-
tive student chapters of the Institute

 

of Electrical and Electronics Engi-
neers (IEEE) and the International
Society for Hybrid and Microelec-
tronics (ISHM). Eta Kappa Nu, the
electrical engineering honorary
society, provides student tutoring
services, and members enjoy social
gatherings throughout the year.
With a thorough and balanced

mix of basic science, electrical
theory, laboratory experience,
elective-course specialization,
leadership and social opportunities,
the electrical engineering program
matches well the interests of
students considering either an im-
mediate career in industry or
graduate studies.

   me 

I was complaining that I was
bored one afternoon back when I
was in high school. A friend of mine
who was visiting me from IUP said,
“Wait ‘til you get to college. You’ll
never be bored. You may not want
to do what you need to do, but
there will always be something that
needs to be done.” She was totally
correct. Now that I’m in college, I’m
certainly never without something
that needs doing. This article, how-
ever, is not about how much work I
have; it is about what one can do in
that somewhat elusive period called
leisure time.

One cannot survive at school
without some degree of leisure-
some way to alleviate the tension.
At some universities the only social
activities available are school-
sponsored or Greek-related, yielding
a somewhat narrow spectrum of en-
joyment. This is not the case at Pitt.
I chose Pitt because it has an ex-
cellent metallurgy program and
because of the incredible diversity
within the Oakland area of Pitts-
burgh. I can honestly say that even
if I weren’t taking any classes, it
would be nearly impossible to be
bored as long as I lived in Oakland.

Oakland is a short trip from
downtown Pittsburgh, and is sur-
rounded by various ethnic commu-
nities, all of which are easily ac-
cessible by bus and most of which
are within walking distance. Squirrel
Hill is a predominantly Jewish com-
munity which is packed with specialty
shops and restaurants. It is a
wonderful area and many students
choose to live there instead of dorm-
ing at the University. Shadyside is
another area frequented by students.
It is famed for its arts festival and
contains some of the poshest shops
in the Pittsburgh area. Right next to
Shadyside is East Liberty, and
slightly beyond that is Bloomfield, a
largely Italian neighborhood. Oakland
itself has many “international
avenues” since the University at-
tracts some of the top students
from various countries. Oriental and
Indian markets abound in Oakland,
and one can enjoy food there from

10

almost every country on the globe.

The University further reflects a
multinational ethnic heritage in the
Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral
of Learning: 19 classrooms, each
exquisitely furnished and decorated
in the style of a particular culture
and time. The rooms create a unique
atmosphere for studying or for a
few moments of peaceful thought
on a quiet afternoon.

People and areas aren’t the only
interesting things about Oakland.
Five minutes from the Cathedral of
Learning is Schenley Park, 422
acres of woods right in the middle
of the city. The park has a pool,
tennis courts, an ice rink, miles of
running trails, and a public golf
course. Highland Park is a ten-
minute bus ride away and houses
the new natural habitat Pittsburgh
Zoo. Pittsburgh has all the advan-
tages of a city campus plus the out-
door flavor added by the parks and
greenery of the Oakland area.

“So,” you say, ‘‘I didn’t come to
Pittsburgh for the trees; I’m here for
the culture.” If that is what you
want, Pitt is definitely for you. A few
minutes’ walk from Pitt is the
Carnegie Institute, which houses
Carnegie Library, Carnegie Music
Hall, the Museum of Natural
History, Hillman Hall of Rocks and
Gems, and Scaife Galleries. There
are at least a dozen professional
theatre companies in Oakland, in-
cluding the New City Theatre Com-
pany. Heinz Hall, the elegant home
of four of the city’s finest cultural in-
stitutions, is located in downtown
Pittsburgh. The Civic Light Opera
and the Pittsburgh Opera Company
are recognized for their excellent
and lively productions of current
and classical musical theatre pieces.
The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre is
noted for its commitment to first-
class dance productions. The Pitts-
burgh Symphony is nationally and
internationally acclaimed and has
earned accolades for its technical
excellence and its success at mak-
ing classical music more accessible
to the public. Phipps Conservatory,
five minutes from campus, is home

to some of the best floral displays
and botanical gardens in Pennsyl-
vania. There are also a myriad of
University concerts and exhibitions
at various galleries and perform-
ance halls on campus.

Culture is not all there is at _Pitt.
Oakland sports the most active night
life in Pittsburgh. Local bands such
as B.E. Taylor and the Iron City
House Rockers appear at rock and
roll clubs. New music is hot in
Oakland, and some of the nation’s
fastest-rising bands play the Decade
and a new wave club called the
Electric Banana. Almost every night
there is a concert in town, and
there are a slew of dance and rock
clubs in downtown Pittsburgh.

The fraternity and sorority system
at Pitt is excellent, and the com-
munity service contributions of
these organizations are well-known
throughout the area. There is an
organization for almost anyone, and
the Greek system is an interesting
social and educational experience
for those participating.

One of the best organizations at
Pitt is the Pitt Program Council.
Composed of students, it is respon-
sible for a huge variety of activities
from dances, concerts, and lectures
to leisure-learning classes and an
impressive film calendar. There are
University-affiliated organizations to
fit the interests of everyone.

Pittsburgh is also a sports town,
and at various times of the year one
can catch a Spirit soccer game or a
Penguin hockey game at the Civic
Arena. The Steelers or the Pirates
can be seen at Three Rivers Sta-
dium, as can the Maulers. One can
watch the Pitt teams at the stadium
or the Field House, and can par-
ticipate in almost any sport imagi-
nable through the intramural program
and physical education courses.

There are more things to do than
there is time, but one has to re-
member that engineers do not live
by calculus alone. As long as a stu-
dent works hard and stays on top of
things, leisure can be a common
and excellent experience.

Industrial Engineering

Department

Industrial engineering. Whether
you've heard a college recruiter
speak of it or whether a relative has
a degree in it, you’re probably not
very clear about what it is. The In-
stitute of Industrial Engineers (|lE)
defines it as “concerned with the
design, improvement, and installa-
tion of integrated systems of people,
material, equipment, and energy. It
draws upon specialized knowledge
and skills in the mathematical, phys-
ical, and social sciences together
with the principles and methods of
engineering analysis and design to
specify, predict, and evaluate the
results to be obtained from such
systems.”

That’s a mouthful for even the
most accomplished veteran in-
dustrial engineer!

Perhaps it’s best to describe in-
dustrial engineering with illustrations.
For example, industrial engineers
design, implement, maintain, and
improve systems such as:

0 A raw materials purchasing
system for an electronics
manufacturer;

0 An interactive computer system
designed to serve many types of
people;

0 A production line utilizing auto-
mated equipment;

0 A network of energy lines serving
an entire city.

Career areas in industrial engi-
neering are much more extensive
than they were in the early days of
the profession. Classical industrial
engineering consists primarily of
time-study and work-analysis tech-
niques to schedule production and
determine costs. Modern-day in-
dustrial engineering has expanded
to include careers in:

0 Human factors: interfacing people
with machines 'and systems.
Example: designing the layout of
a car’s interior to provide quick
access to controls.

0 Operations/production: maintain-
ing, improving, and handling day-
to-day problems with production
processes.

Example: generating a year-long
production plan based on fore-
casted production, inventory
policy, and production capacity.

° Quality control: improving product
quality and production processes
by using statistical process
control.

Example: determining an optimum
machine setting to produce a
high quality product using a sta-
tistical technique called a designed
experiment.

0 Management: effective direction
of many systems through knowl-
edge of engineering, computers,
business, accounting, mathe-
matics, and communication skills.
Example: managing a production
department in a large industrial
complex or managing a self-
owned small business.

As a further example of the diver-
sity of industrial engineering careers,
Tom Landry, the famous NFL
coach, once- told an interviewer that
he attributes his coaching achieve-
ments to his bachelor's degree in
industrial engineering. He explained
that he applied his background in
industrial engineering to manage
the football team which evolved into
the successful Dallas Cowboys.

To prepare young men and
women for these satisfying and
rewarding careers, Pitt’s industrial

engineering curriculum offers a
broad background in science and
mathematics as well as an introduc-
tion to other engineering disciplines,
including mechanical, materials,
and electrical engineering. A strong
knowledge of mathematical applica-
tions and computer techniques is
developed through courses in prob-
ability and statistics, linear program-
ming, database processing, com-
puter simulation, and numerical
methods. Computer usage and ap-
plications are emphasized in many
classes, and a senior course deals
specifically with the uses of micro-
computers in business. A course in
communications skills for engineers
is offered in the sophomore year to
improve both written and verbal
skills. Presentations are individually
videotaped so that students may
observe and analyze their own
styles and effectiveness. Other
courses in human-factors engineer-
ing, engineering management, and
operations research contribute to
the student’s foundation in basic in-
dustrial engineering techniques. A
variety of courses in economics, so-
ciology, and business further com-
plement the core industrial engi-
neering courses.

A highlight of the academic pro-
gram is the senior group projects,
designed and conducted by students
in corporations within the Pittsburgh
area. During the 1984 winter term,
one group of three seniors con-
ducted a bulk tank utilization anal-
ysis for PPG Industries. Pitt’s urban
location is ideal for these group pro-
jects which prepare students for the
professional world in a way that
classroom instruction can’t provide.

Pitt’s industrial engineering de-
partment has been ranked among
the top 15 in the country.* The
faculty, facilities, curriculum, and
students combined have established
this level of excellence.

Mechanical Engineering

Department

What is mechanical engineering?
Some people tend to think that
“mechanical engineer” is just a
fancy name for the local auto
mechanic. Contrary to this belief,
mechanical engineering, simply put,
is concerned with the utilization of
energy. A mechanical engineer,
therefore, must design systems that
are efficient and meet health and
safety standards. Thus, mechanical
engineers play a vital part in the
engineering profession because
they draw upon all engineering
disciplines in order to accomplish
this task.

The mechanical engineering
department at Pitt offers a chal-
lenging curriculum that is closely
tied to graduate study and prepares
students to be competitive in to-
day’s job market. The diversity of
the profession requires a solid
understanding of basic engineering
principles, creative design, and
computational skills.

For the first two years the cur-
riculum is similar to that of other
engineering disciplines with the ex-
ception of four courses including an
introduction to mechanical design
and a four-term physics sequence.
The final two years are structured to
emphasize mechanical engineering
through design, measurements, fluid
mechanics, heat transfer, and
stress analysis. Technical electives
are also offered, permitting each
student to explore areas of interest
not otherwise dealt with in the
regular curriculum. During the entire
undergraduate program, the student
is encouraged to take social
science and humanities courses to
enhance the application of
engineering principles to social,
cultural, and economic problems.

In the senior year, the department
offers a scheduled project course in
which the student applies previously
learned principles in a simulated job
environment. Teams of three or four
students work on a problem with a
faculty adviser and present formal
reports at the end of the term. This
is particularly beneficial in preparing
students to deal with an employment

situation. Recent projects included
one on computer-aided design/
computer-aided manufacturing
(CAD/CAM), an analysis of shock
waves caused by conic sections at
supersonic speeds, a study aimed
at increasing aerodynamic perform-
ance on a windsail, and elevator
control using a microprocessor.

An aerospace option is available
within the mechanical engineering
department for those students desir-
ing the essential background for
work in which aerospace principles
are needed. These are covered in
four courses which include practical
applications, ranging from gathering
data from the department’s wind
tunnel and studying the stability and
control of aircraft to the completely
theoretical examination of subsonic
flow. Industries hiring our graduates
particularly like the combination of
mechanical and aerospace engi-
neering which Pitt offers. The option
also provides a strong foundation
for graduate work in either mechani-
cal or aerospace engineering.

As you might expect, laboratory
work is an integral part of the
mechanical engineering program.
Design labs are structured toward
the many different types of design
criteria necessary to ensure the
safe operation of a system or part.

The lab dealing with the kinetics of

machines and mechanisms provides

a graphical means to solve related
problems. Perhaps the most in-
teresting of the labs are those ac-
companying the three-part
mechanical measurements courses.
The first introduces the apparatus
commonly found in the engineering

workplace and gives students a
hands-on working knowledge of
oscilloscopes, filters, and thermo-
couples through carefully set-up ex-
periments. The second entails the
completion of several system ex-
periments and analyses. The final
lab is the senior project.

lntradepartmental organizations
allow the mechanical engineering
student to work with classmates
and faculty in developing personal
and professional skills. These are
the student chapters of the
American Society of Mechanical
Engineers (ASME), the American In-
stitute of Aeronautics and
Astronautics (AIAA), and the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE). Pi
Tau Sigma, the mechanical engi-
neering fraternity, is also available
at Pitt for students who meet na-
tional as well as local membership
standards.

Metallurgical and Materials
Engineering Department

0 The basis of all modern
microprocessors is the semicon-
ductor wafer, better known as the
chip. Despite current leaps in the
microprocessor industry, general-
ly attributed to the electronics
revolution, the next truly quantum
jump in that technology will
derive not from improvement in
existing logic or language theory,
but from the development of
purer, faster, and physically
larger semiconductor materials.

0 Our present space program
centers on reusable spacecraft.
Intense heat during reentry
formerly prohibited the reuse of
vehicles, but a new ceramic heat
shield solved the problem.

0 Materials science is truly a key to
the future.

Good things come in small
packages. No exception is the
Metallurgical and Materials
Engineering (MME) Department at
Pitt. Ranked among the top 20
MME departments nationwide*, the
quality of our department shines
through its curriculum, facilities, and
teaching and research faculty.

The curriculum, beginning in the
sophomore year, is designed to
develop an understanding of the
basic tool skills and principles and
survey current technologies and ap-
plications in the field of materials
science. Introductory lecture
material covers the broad spectrum
of materials (metals, ceramics,
polymers, composites) and their
rudimentary properties and the
scientific approach toward these
materials. Subsequent courses pro-
vide a broad view of current
technologies used in the production
and fabrication of engineering
materials. Then on to thermodynam-
ics. You will learn how the universal
system of matter plus energy (heat)
invariably follows certain paths
during interaction. With knowledge
of thermodynamic laws, you are
able to trick nature into giving you
glass from sand, nylon from crude
oil, and steel from an odd assort-
ment of rocks. Powerful, indeed,

this science.

Threaded through the entire pro-
gram are learning experiences in
the lab. Often, doing is the most ef-
fective form of /earning.

Midway through the junior year,
you will choose one of two options
offered by the department: a con-
centration in metallurgy, leading to
the B.S. in Engineering (Metallurgi-
cal) or a concentration in materials,
leading to the B.S. in Engineering
(Materials).

A highlight of the curriculum is
the senior project or senior thesis.
Dr. Allen Russell, the course coor-
dinator, describes it as “a full-year
course in which teams—general|y
two students—work on a project
which frequently has industrial
sponsorship. They resolve the ex-
perimental program, analyze, and
report results.” Each project is
unique, and there is often an oppor-
tunity for the student to select a
project in which he or she has a
professional interest. Usually an in-
dustrial sponsor provides the mate-
rials and the starting point for the
work. This work is not trivial and
may be particularly valuable to the
industrial sponsor. It demands dedi-
cated effort, creative engineering
applications, careful experimental
techniques, and polished writing.

A well-founded education requires
not only the best curriculum but ex-
tensive familiarity with the “tools of
the trade”—from the most basic
hardness-testing equipment to the
most sophisticated electron micro-
scope, transmission electron micro-
scope, and scanning transmission
electron microscope (or STEM)—all
available at Pitt.

This past summer, the U.S. Steel
Corporation donated four field ion
microscopes or “atom probes,”
valued at over $1-million, making
our facility the best equipped of its
kind in the world. These in-
struments are capable of resolving
the chemical identity and lattice
position of individual atoms.

The department maintains a host
of other teaching and research
facilities, including a welding lab, an

assortment of heating and melting
furnaces, optical microscopes, op-
tical photomicroscopy equipment,
full developing and printing dark-
rooms and mechanical testing
machines for tensile, compressive,
torsion, and fatigue studies. The
department also uses X-ray diffrac-
tion and fluorescence equipment for
materials-characterization studies.

The materials testing system is a
computer-interfaced mechanical
testing system capable of monitor-
ing and controlling temperature,
strain rate, overall strain, and
elapsed time, simultaneously. The
apparatus is well suited for model-
ing industrial thermomechanical
treatments.

Perhaps the most attractive
feature of the department is the
MME faculty of experts in metals
processing (mechanical metallurgy),
materials characterization (physical
metallurgy), degradation of materials
(corrosion and high-temperature oxi-
dation), polymer science, and
ceramic science. They are well
published and many are sought
as industrial consultants and expert
witnesses. With an undergraduate
class size of about 90 students
(making MME next to the smallest
department in the school) and a
faculty of 15 teaching professors,
the student-to-faculty ratio is an en-
viable six-to-one.

The MME department is striving
to produce the very best individuals
possible. It recognizes the value of
a strong knowledge of basic
sciences, encourages specialization
in areas of personal interest, yet
demands a broad familiarity with
current technology—a combination
that makes Pitt MME graduates
among the most flexible and
capable in the country.

While very few schools offer pro-
grams in mining engineering, the
University of Pittsburgh’s mining
engineering program is over a cen-
tury old. lnitiated in 1869, it was
deactivated temporarily in 1965 be-
cause of lack of student interest
and the decrease of industrial and
governmental support. However, in
response to the nation’s energy cri-
sis, it was reinstated in 1974. As a
result of this hiatus, the program
has not yet regained the accredita-
tion of the Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology (ABET),
but the program is committed to the
reestablishment of this accreditation
in three years.

The program boasts extensive fa-
cilities, an enthusiastic and experi-
enced faculty, eager and ambitious
students, and a very rewarding co-
operative education program. The
curriculum is designed to educate
students in the areas of both open-
pit and underground mining, and
provides essential background for
work with sedimentary, igneous,
and metamorphic rocks. Through
electives, students may specialize in
environmental engineering, mineral
beneficiation, structural engineering,
transportation and material handling,
electric power systems, coal mining,

industrial management and opera-
tions synthesis, machinery design,
extractive metallurgy, or energy
resources.

Extensively used facilities and
equipment available to students in
the mining program include:

Minerals preparation and analysis /ab
—a small pilot plant used to crush,
separate, and clean raw mineral
samples.

Ventilation /ab—allows the student
to observe variations in air velocity,
pressure drop, fan speed, and
power.

Flock mechanics /ab—where
samples are tested in cooperation
with the soil-mechanics group in
civil engineering.

Bituminous Coal Research National
Laboratory (BCRNL)—a nonprofit
corporation established by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and Bituminous
Coal Research, |nc., located in
Monroeville, PA.

Computers-IBM PCs recently pur-
chased for use by mining students
for database management, electronic
spread sheets, computer graphics,
and map plotting.

Map p/otter—a device used
throughout the mining curriculum.

Pitt’s mining co-op program, the
only such program in the country, is
probably the most important advan-
tage a mining engineering student
enjoys. It provides students with
professionally stimulating employ-
ment and helps them meet the high
costs of college education. Work ex-
perience gained in the program can
be applied in the classroom and
provides a distinct advantage in job
competition. Co-op employment op-
portunities range from work as a
junior engineer to work in
underground mining operations.
Work terms are usually alternated
with study terms, and it is possible
to work three terms without delaying
graduation. Current co-op students
earn from $7 to $10 per hour.

In addition to the financial assis-
tance provided through the co-op
program, the mining engineering
division offers a number of scholar-
ships, including the General Scholar-
ship Fund and the Mining Scholar’s
Cooperative Award.

The mining engineering faculty
are a fine blend of resourceful and
experienced professors. Three fac-
ulty members alone combine to give
the program over one century’s
worth of mining experience! In addi-
tion to their teaching responsibil-
ities, several faculty are engaged in
research projects, including the use
of a microcomputer database man-
agement system for assembling a
longwall mining data bank, develop-
ment of a machine—maintenance
system to correct chronic problems
in mine machinery, and the produc-
tion of a water-jet assisted longwall
shearer drum for longwall coal-mining
sections. Future research is planned
in areas of coal beneficiation and
energy management.

Other plans for the future involve
more extensive use of computers,
increased contact with BCRNL, the
addition of new faculty members,
and the acquisition of an experi-
mental mine.

Industries and Universities. . .

Donald E. Rathbone
Dean of Engineering
Kansas State University

“I am very proud of my past
association with Pitt and feel for-
tunate that I attended there. My
experience at Pitt has certainly
been a major factor in whatever
success I've had.

The University has many excellent
features. For one, it is a total Uni-
versity. It has fine programs in
many, many disciplines of study, in-
cluding outstanding professional
schools. It excels in such diverse
areas as athletics and international
studies. It has something for
everyone.”

 

Donald E. Rathbone received his B. S. at Pur-
due, his M.S. at Northwestern, and his Ph.D.
at the University of Pittsburgh in electrical
engineering. He has taught at the University
of Pittsburgh, the University of Idaho, and
Northwestern University. He is listed in such
registries as Who's Who in the World, Who's
Who in America, and Who's Who in
Engineering.

Dr. Donald H. Gillott
Dean, School of
Engineering and Computer
Science

California State University

“Graduates of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Engineering
are very well prepared to make ma-
jor contributions to the engineering
profession, both in industry and in
research and academics. I can state
this from personal experience. For
example, Dr. John Choma received
his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. from Pitt
during 1963-1969 and spent several
years in the electrical engineering
department of California State Uni-
versity at Sacramento while I was
chairman of the department. Stu-
dent evaluations of Dr. Choma’s
teaching were among the best ever
received by a faculty member of our
school

“Many other graduates of Pitt
have distinguished themselves in
the academic community across the
nation. Dr. Lawrence McNamee is
currently professor of computer
science at UCLA. Dr. Ronald Schultz

is professor of electrical engineering ‘

at Cleveland State University. Dr.
Andrew Revay is clean of the School
of Engineering at the Florida Institute
of Technology.

“A number of outstanding text-
books currently in use by engineering
departments at major universities

 

throughout the country have been
written by Pitt alumni. For example,
Dr. Karl Spingarn, a Pitt Ph.D.
graduate and senior scientist for
Hughes Aircraft, has written a text-
book on control systems which has
been widely adopted by a number
of electrical engineering depart-
ments, including our own.

“My personal experiences in
dealing with engineers throughout
the country have impressed me with
a certain quality of Pitt graduates,
one which I have found over and
over again. This is that Pitt grad-
uates tend to be people oriented;
they interact well with others and
have a sense of concern for their
fellow man. Such a quality is some-
what less tangible but is a very im-
portant prerequisite for effective and
successful engineering.”

Dr. Donald H. Gillott received his B.S.,
M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical
engineering from the University of Pitts-
burgh. He serves on numerous boards and
committees including the California
Engineering Foundation, and the California
State University Systemwide Committee on
Industry-Education.

“Technology leadership is a key
ingredient in industry today and a
key issue in America. It is vital to
our countrys world leadership. It
comes from people with the right
kind of background and education
acquired at a university like Pitt with

its leadership qualities of a strong
faculty and administration. These
fundamental ingredients existed
when I was a student in the late
40s, and, judging from the gradu-
ates who have joined General Motors
most recently, the quality of educa-
tion is still excellent. The University
of Pittsburgh taught me how to think.
I learned how to challenge myself to
reach for new ideas. I also learned
how to work hard. Pitt played a ma-
jor role in my career, and I will
always be greatful for the education
it imparted.”

 

Edward P. Czapor received a B. S. in elec-
trical engineering from the University of Pitts-

“The long-standing relationship
between Westinghouse and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh has been a
mutually beneficial one.

“Pitt has provided a steady
stream of top managerial and pro-
fessional talent to our corporation
over the course of many decades.

 

Edward J. Slack
Senior Vice President
PPG Industries, Inc.

“By and large, my success at
PPG Industries has had its roots in
the training I received as an engi-
neer. Engineers form the backbone
of ideas for new and more efficient
processes and products that are so
vital to business growth. Over the
years, engineers have constituted
the largest part of PPG’s profes-
sional recruiting requirements. For
me and for many others at PPG, an
engineering background has provided
a spring-board to achievement in
various technical fields as well as
management. Companies depend
heavily on advancements in
technology to achieve growth in
competitive worldwide markets. I
consider the University of Pittsburgh
engineering school to be an ex-
cellent provider of these skills.”

Edward J. Slack began his career at PPG
in 1946 at the Creighton, PA, glass plant. On
October 1, 1984, he will become the com-
pany's president. He is an engineering
graduate of the University of Pittsburgh.

Today, with more then 2,600 alumni
employed as managers and profes-
sionals in every sphere and at every
level of corporate activity, Pitt has
by far the broadest representation
of any college or university at West-
inghouse. Indeed, three of the eight
members of our management com-
mittee—the top policymaking body
in our corporation—received their
degrees from Pitt.

“For our part, to help maintain
and expand this valuable relation-
ship, Westinghouse actively sup-
ports the University in a variety of
ways.

“I currently serve on the Univer-
sity’s Board of Trustees and am
joined by former Westinghouse
chairman Robert E. Kirby, who is
Pitt’s present board chairman. This
not only provides us with a first-
hand appreciation of the University’s
plans and capabilities, but also
helps assure that the Pitt curriculum
and its graduates are well suited
to the real needs of the modern
business world.

“Over the past several years,
Westinghouse has provided more
than $3-million in financial support
to Pitt through grants, matching
gifts, and capital-campaign funds.
Furthermore, donations of other

 

assets—inc|uding a recent gift of
$3-million worth of software to
enhance the advanced computing
capabilities of the School of
Engineering—also help to make Pitt
graduates among the best trained in
the high-growth fields of today and
tomorrow.

John C. Marous, Jr., is responsible for the ac-
tivities of most of the corporation's industrial
and electric utility related businesses as well
as the full scope of Westinghouse overseas
efforts. Currently a member of the University’s
Board of Trustees, Mr. Marcus received both
his bachelor's and master’s degrees in elec-
trical engineering from Pitt. He has also
served as past president of the Engineering
Alumni Association. Since 1979 he has been
a member, and recently chairman, of the
School of Engineering's Board of Visitors, a
group of distinguished University trustees,
governmental and industrial leaders who
serve in an external advisory capacity; as a
member of this group, he has been called
upon extensively for advice and direction,
particularly concerning the school's efforts in
computer engineering. In 1982 he was named
a Distinguished Alumnus of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Engineering.

Harvey J. Trilli

Senior Vice President of
Subsidiary Operations

Dravo Engineers, Inc.

“With over 30 years in the
engineering profession, much of it
in management positions, I have
evaluated experienced engineers
and interviewed recent graduates
from universities all over the U.S. It
has been my experience that Pitt

graduates consistently fare well in
relation to those in comparable
positions from other educational
backgrounds. Locally, Pitt graduates
historically do extremely well in
hiring programs with local concerns.
Since the Pittsburgh area is heavily
involved with the basic industries,
Pitt engineers have developed a
real know-how base in various
design elements within these in-
dustries and have exported this
know-how to many of the developing
nations of the world.”

l’m dragged rudely back to con-
sciousness by the buzzing of my
alarm. The clock reads 7 a.m. —6:51
real time—as I hit the snooze button
and revel in nine more minutes of
glorious Z-time. I curse the demon
that invented 8 a.m. classes as the
alarm buzzes again. I roll out of
bed, hit the shower, get dressed,
and go down to breakfast. l’ve got
my morning routine down to a sci-
ence, and I make class with exactly
two minutes to spare.

I am not a morning person. I must
admit that on most days I cheat by
sleeping ‘til the last possible minute
then dashing to class. No one is ex-
pected to look the best at 8 a.m.,
so showers and breakfast often wait
until after my first class. Thank
heaven that “eight o’clocks” aren’t
usually an every-morning occurrence.

My first class finished, I stop in
Benedum lobby to talk with some

18

friends and play a few hands of pi-
nochle. I kill most of the hour then
head upstairs. I have two more
classes this morning, both in
Benedum.

I have three classes every morn-
ing except Tuesday, when I don’t
have class until 1 p.m. Needless to
say I sleep in on Tuesdays unless I
have something that needs to be
done immediately. Mornings are a
good time to study in the dorms,
since everyone is either asleep or at
class.

My two classes go rather quickly
and a group of us decide to go out
for lunch since most of us are done
for the day and no one has class
before two. We walk down to Cor-
ky’s and split a pizza while watching
MTV on the big screen.

Going out to lunch gets expen-
sive, even if it's just to Burger King.
Lunch is the cat is generally pretty
good, and one always sees some-

one there to talk to. After lunch is
an active time on the floor, and it is
a good time to just kick around or
to study until one’s next class.

I forget the time and walk into my
2 p.m. English lit class late. Lit is
one of the high points of my term,
as the class is really interesting and
a good break from the calculations
and numbers that sometimes swamp
a person in engineering classes. After
class I head back to my room. The
rest of the afternoon is mine to do
as I please.

I almost always relax between my
last class and dinner. There is
always something going on in Oak-
land, which is one of the main
reasons that I chose Pitt. Between
the University-sponsored activities
and all the things that there are in
the Oakland-Pittsburgh community
to do, a person should never be
bored. The area is charged with a
vital atmosphere that has to be ex-

perienced to be understood.

Five of us from the floor usually
eat dinner together. We run into a
lot of our friends in the cat on most
nights, so dinner is a good time
even when the food is crummy. After
dinner we split up, some of us going
to the library to study, others going
to work, and still others heading out
for the night.

Dinner at college is always an ex-
perience. The food runs the gamut
from surprisingly good to abysmally
foul. In spite of this fact, dinner is
one of the best times of the day at
school. A fair 90 per cent of the
socializing done at school is prob-
ably done in the caf. And, if the
food is too bad, there are an un-
common number of fast food joints
and a plethora of pizza places within
walking distance of school.

After dinner I hit the books. Quiet
hours start at 8 p.m., but people are
reasonable and will stay cool before

eight if asked. Everyone at college
has to study sometime, and, to use
a terrible cliche, “misery loves
company.”

The fact is: college is a hell of a
lot of work. Everyone studies, and
most people study at least some
every day. College is no harder
than high school,* just exponentially
more time-consuming and a lot
more work. If someone had told me
that he or she studied every day in
high school, I would have doubted
either his or her faculties or sanity.
Studying doesn't take up all of one’s
time at college. There is still plenty
of room to have the great times that
everyone talks about.

About 11 p.m. Jim and I decide to
take a break. We hit Baskin-Robbins
and then cruise the “O” to see if
anyone interesting is hanging out.
(The “O” is a famous Oakland hot
dog joint that is open 24 hours a
day, 363 days a year, and is con-

stantly packed.) We stop at Steve’s
room on the way back and end up
talking for the rest of the evening.
Late nights are the rule at col-
lege, not the exception. l’ve pulled
my share of all-nighters and been
up ’til 3 or 4 a.m. just talking on oc-
casion. Being responsible for one’s
self is the first thing to learn at
school, and learning how to live on
one’s own is as big a part of a col-
lege education as actual classes are.
lt’s 1:48 a.m., and /’m beat. I

brush my teeth and get ready to
tune in to the Z-band. The last thing
I do is check my alarm— 7 a.m. is
an ungodly hour.

‘Editors note: many students would disagree rather vio-
lently with this statement. College is generally vastly more
challenging than high school. This, of course. depends
upon your high school program. It is rumored that Joe
spent his pre-college years in a research room at Bell
Labs, but this has never been confirmed.—J.T.S.

Student Activities

Engineers’ Week

Pitt’s winter term ends in April.
The early finish gives students extra
time to find summer employment,
and allows Pitt to offer a full-length
summer term.

The April finish precludes a spring
break for most of the University, but
the engineering school takes a
“break” anyway. The approach of
St. Patrick’s Day marshalls in a
week of frivolity and games for the
engineering students at Pitt. Engi-
neers’ Week is a friendly competi-
tion among the departments begin-
ning with Parents’ Night on Sunday
and concluding with the presenta-
tion of the coveted Shamrock Award
at the Shamrock Ball on Friday
night. In between are five days of
mirth, cooperation, competition, and
bustling high-energy activity.

In the months before St. Patrick’s
Day, students in each department
pull together with faculty and ad-
ministrators to organize the week.

In addition to being a welcome
release from the pressures of
academics, the event provides in-
dividuals with the opportunity to
gain leadership experience working
as part of the various departments’
planning committees, or on the
overall Engineers’ Week Planning
Committee. Events include a blood
drive; “enginuity;” a soapbox derby;
“gimmick” (an outdoor competition
including an obstacle course, egg
toss, and tug-of-war); and a game
night, featuring an enormous
monopoly game and departmental
rooms decked out casino-fashion.
“Enginuity” is a test of skill in apply-
ing engineering principles to
unusual tasks. 1984’s “Enginuity”
event demanded that each depart-
ment build a miniature craft pro-
pelled by the potential energy of a
single can of soda pop. The loudest
event is the parade, complete with
cleverly engineered floats and
musical instruments, in which each
group tries to outdo the others in a

Society of Women
Engineers

The Society of Women Engineers
(SWE) is one of the more active
professional organizations on cam-
pus. Originally formed in 1950 as a
national support group for the three
per cent of the technical profes-
sionals who were women, SWE now
offers many services and oppor-
tunities at the professional and stu-
dent levels to both men and women
in science-related fields. (Last year’s
freshman engineering class was ap-
proximately 25 per cent female.)

At Pitt, the SWE student section,
chartered in 1970, sponsors annual
resume-writing and interviewing-
techniques seminars and joins with
the Engineering Student Cabinet
and the Black Engineering Council
on the annual Corporate Expo, at
which company representatives
meet students in an informal at-
mosphere. SWE also holds an an-
nual Corporate Banquet, offering
another opportunity for students to

20

meet recruiters on a casual basis.

Every year SWE publishes a
resume book containing more than
200 resumes of undergraduate and
graduate students in technical ma-
jors; this is distributed to more than
100 companies.

Along with these major activities,
SWE holds weekly meetings, spon-
sors plant trips, and devotes plenty
of time to eating (pizza parties and
food booths) and socializing (a holi-
day party and a fraternity mixer).

SWE’s goals are to promote pro-
fessional development, provide
career guidance for high school and
college students, and encourage in-
teraction among students of dif-
ferent ages and majors.

Pitt’s SWE chapter has won
awards for its efforts in this region-
Best Student Section (1982-83) and
Best Career Guidance (1983-84)-
having a great time all the while.

fantastic show of talent and
outrageousness.

Spirits run high; Thursday and
Friday engineering classes are
cancelled; and every participant
meets new people, both inside and
outside his or her department.
Through team work, extensive
planning, and many exciting events,
Engineers’ Week unites the engi-
neering school in a unique and
wonderful way.

The Engineering Student
Cabinet

The Engineering Student Cabinet
(ESC) serves as the representative
and governing body for the under-
graduates of the School of Engineer-
ing. Voting representatives include
three students from each depart-
ment (including the freshman class),
six elected officers, and all commit-
tee heads. Meetings are held on a
weekly or biweekly basis, and all
students are encouraged to attend.

Committee membership is open
to all students and includes the
Engineers’ Week Planning Commit-
tee (EWPC), the staff of the
Skyscraper Engineer and Engineer-
ing Bulletin, the Sports and Social
Committee, External Affairs Commit-
tee, Internal Affairs Committee,
Publicity Committee, and Engineer-
ing Undergraduate Academic Com-
mittee (EUAC).

The ESC office is located in
Room 125 on the first floor of
Benedum Engineering Hall and can
be reached by telephone at (412)
624-5260. The office is staffed dur-
ing the fall and winter terms by
members of ESC, and students with
questions about the school are en-
couraged to use the ESC office as
a resource.

Skyscraper Engineer
Magazine

Skyscraper Engineer is the official
undergraduate publication of Pitt’s
engineering school. Staffed by a
bold, daring, and innovative assem-
blage of almost frighteningly creative
students, Skyscraper has been
described as “possibly the finest
engineering student publication in
the free world” (by its current
editor). Published four times a year,

Tau Beta Pi National
Engineering Honor
Society

During the course of your college
career, you may need to turn to
someone for support. Tau Beta Pi,
the Engineering Honor Society, is
here both to give you needed
assistance and to provide the op-
portunity for you to share your
talents and abilities with your fellow
students.

As a freshman or sophomore, you
can benefit from Tau Beta Pi’s tutor-
ing program. If you need help, just
stop by the office and a tutoring
program will be set up for you.

As juniors and seniors, Tau Beta
Pi offers you the challenge and

Skyscraper provides the opportunity
for students to express their writing,
photographic, artistic, and organiza-
tional abilities. Skyscraper serves as
a creative outlet for students, pro-
motes communication within the
school and University, and allows
the staff to enjoy and benefit from
their experiences. Journalistic and
writing skills are valuable assets to
any student planning a professional
career. (Ask anyone who has
assembled an illustrated technical
thesis how important layout skills
can be!) The subject matter is in-
credibly diverse, since the range of
material published is limited only by
the imaginations and interests of
the students (and, of course, certain
considerations of good taste). The
key point is that Skyscraper is not
so much an engineering magazine
as it is a magazine by engineering
students.

Contributions of letters, articles,
photographs, or artwork are welcome
from all students. Those with an in-
terest in participating more directly
are wholeheartedly encouraged to
join the staff.

The Black Engineering
Council

The Black Engineering Council
(BEC) is open to engineering
students and students of other
technical disciplines, such as
chemistry, computer science, and
biology, who have a desire to aid
black students in their respective
fields.

BEC dates from 1975, when a
small group of black engineering
students gathered to create an
organization to unify the black
engineers on campus, and has
since grown into an organization
recognized by the Student Govern-
ment Board and the School of
Engineering. In 1981 BEC became
a chartered chapter of the National
Society of Black Engineers.

BEC provides services and sup-
port to its members as they pro-
gress through all their years of
schooling but tends to concentrate
on aiding freshmen. This is ac-
complished through a tutoring pro-
gram and a big-brother/big-sister
program designed to assist under-
class students in adjusting to col-
lege life and academics.

In the big-brother/big-sister pro-
gram, a freshman is taken under
the wing of a junior and a soph-
omore is aided by a senior. The
goal is to develop a friendship
which is beneficial to both. The pro-
gram is voluntary, but usually many
participate and often friendships
carry over beyond the school years.

BEC also has social events, such
as pizza parties and team sports.
The Council’s goal is to make sure
that everyone who enters the School
of Engineering, or any other of Pitt’s
schools, graduates with a degree
and enjoys the experience. BEC
wants to help you to achieve this.
All you have to do is come meet us
in the fall.

Parks happened upon it one day, there among the mental
and physical clustering of scraps in his laboratory. A holo-
graphic image processor was the source. It was badly out of
calibration, and a chance turn of a simple varistor magically
produced the rudimentary effect, which we know today as
a Park—scape. The whole concept is simple: in order to truly
simulate life, the time factor in wave propagation must be
accounted for. Parks’ discovery pushed the relative
ambience to about 14 or 15 "times that previously attained
in holographic images.

After several weeks of playing with the instrument he
had stumbled upon, he began to examine the possibility of
using the device as a sort of recreational vehicle. He fashi-
oned a transmitter of about suitcase size, and had it deli-
vered by post to a friend in Sheffield, just about 4
kilometers down the road.

When the package arrived, the instructions read: ”Dear
Barnes. This is a very special package. Please give it a good
home, somewhere above ground level, and away from sun-
light. I should like to drop by in a fortnight to collect it, at
which time, I will explain the nature of the package to you.
Very Graciously, Parks."

Well, Mr. Barnes was indeed a friend, and carried out the
instructions to the letter. When the fortnight had expired,
he was perturbed to discover he had been under a sort of
surveillance. Parks assured him that his observations had
been discrete, and in good faith. Barnes was still unnerved,
and demanded that the device be removed, which Parks
promptly did.

Realizing that such a device would most certainly be
considered intrusive, in any environment, he set about to
increase the peripheral pick—up of the transmitter. His suc-
cess was only partial, in that he had lost resolution and
ambience. When faced with such a block, Parks was prone

to spur of the moment travel—tantrums. He spent several
weeks with his two suitcases, observing a great deal more
than the average tourist. On his return trip, a solution to
his problem presented itself: multiplicity. He himself must
have used scads of busses and trains on his voyage, all with
the intent on transporting the device into range of the
things and places he wanted to experience. It would be a
very simple task to arrange a string of intermediary trans-
mitters so he would be able to keep resolution to a maxi-
mum in addition to increasing the working range of his
invention.

He kept himself busy for several years, simply collecting
the materials he needed for the construction of each unit,
some materials which were exotic, indeed. A certain capaci-
tor which he used was home built, and consisted of cylindri-
cally rolled chewing gum foil, papered on one side only. The
actual hard wiring and final adjustment of each unit was
complex; as they were custom designed, no two operated
within any narrow set of conditions. In order to properly
arrange the units geographically, he enlisted the help of
several local libraries and Royal Botanical Society trans-
cripts, courtesy of his machine.

The units were at last prepared for deployment into a
wholly unsuspecting world. His final plans had resolved the
spacing into positions roughly equivalent to the intersec-
tion points of a geodesic sphere. As Parks was a staunch
Britisher, he first endeavored to canvas the existing British
Empire, and most of the satellite nations he considered still
to be British. Once deployed, they initiated power within
themselves by means of a timer, so that they might all
produce equal working hours once engaged.

Parks arranged his laboratory into something very near
to a sound stage, with muted polychromatic lighting, and
sonically deadened walls, ceiling, and floor. Aside from a
purring sound issuing prudently from the CPU (”Central
Pleasure Unit”, as Parks called it), the room was quiet,
serene. By remote control, he activated the reception unit,
and was immediately immersed in an onslaught of sensory
images. The feeling was so intense that he experienced a
sort of vertigo, and had it not been for his previous expe-
rience with the apparatus, he would have been thrown into
what is now termed park isolation, a sort of shock therapy for
mentally unbalanced persons, particularly those in cata-
tonic shock.

He learned to use the machines in a way which allowed
him to observe microcosms in the world. His abilities to
observe cultural events and prevailing attitudes placed him,
though not recognized as such, into being the leading
anthropological authority. His ability to be in so many
places at an instant naturally gave him quite a lot of power.
Fortunately, Parks never attempted to use that power, for
those of less scrupulous character would have made use of
him and his ’toy.’

Parks was a very happy man for quite a long time. His
ability to observe and learn satisfied his scholarly yearnings
completely. One day he attempted to go beyond his already
terrific powers of observation. Confident in the scientific
method, he tried to not only breach the confines of space,
but to supercede the limits of experience placed on human-
ity by the passage of time. He studied the circuit structure
of his apparatus, and its ultimate purpose of information
transfer. He searched for a way to see into the future by
ferreting out the correct collection of waveforms that upon
superposition and transformation by Fourier analysis

14

would provide a correct premonition of actual events. Sev-
eral weeks of work, most of which involved the study of
non-Einsteinian fields, and he concluded that the search
was fruitless. Again, feeling blocked, he withdrew from
everything, confined himself to the travel room, and went
globetrotting.

One of his stops provided a curous experience. While
”visiting” Mecca, he lost all resolution. He at first assumed
that the local transmitter had failed. When he verified that
the transmitter was 100% functional, he was mystified. He
again and again tried to ’visit,’ but received only blackness.
He wondered if the unit had been retrieved by a local and
was somehow being insulated. He decided that a visit to the
area would be in order. His curiosity far outweighted his
feelings that actual travel was long since obsolete.

He packed his portable unit, which he had been able to
miniaturize to the size of a typewriter case. He and his
contraption boarded the flight, and arrived the following
day. He was not altogether thrilled with the idea of the
transmitter being discovered on the way out of the Holy
Land. He surely would have been subjected to detention or
imprisonment. He was spared the anxiety when he found
that as he approached the region, the blackness that origi-
nally enveloped the Holy Land systematically spread across
the globe. He thought about it, and decided that the pecul-
iarity lay not with the transmitter, but with the geographi-
cal location itself. What was difficult to detect at first was
that the transmitter was not acutally being blocked, as
would happen with radar jamming devices, but was actu-
ally being reinforced by some unknown agent, pushing the
signal into a region that overloaded the receiver, much like
a microphone with too much gain. The system was thrown
into regenerative processing. As Parks was not the type
who backed down easily, he was determined to remedy the
problem.

Parks began the laborious search for answers by trying
to find a place, a point on a perimeter of the local transmit-
ter, where he could receive a clear transmission. He began
at a radius of 20-feet, and completely circled the transmit-
ter. He recorded data concerning the image received, ter-
rain tranversed, and luckily, the time of day. He observed
two noticeable changes in the image, and they occurred
among a common diameter. His natural reaction was that
this particular unit was transmitting in a bi-polar mode,
and to test that possibility, he carefully rotated the trans-
mitter 90° and then repeated his perimeter mapping proce-
dure. The results were that the exact same reception
occurred at each point along the perimeter. The result
suggested that some local geological formation was at
work, or perhaps some form of subterranean activity. He
was not aware of any man-made projects in the area which
could produce any electromagnetic disturbance, so he con-
cluded that the local geology was the culprit.

Parks packed up his gear and headed home, where he
could gain access to information about the Holy Land's
topology, mineral deposits, subsurface hydrology, or any-
thing else that might provide a clue. He started with an
investigation of the local formations. He hoped to discover
some sort of very large mineral formation that would
account for the disruptance. What he discovered was sand-
stone and sand, and much deeper into the earth, a rare
pocket of salt or crude oil. Not a trace of hematite, galena,
or even mica. The search for a mineral rich underground
water table proved negative also.

\,.u

 

Parks was completely perplexed. He was convinced that
the difficulty in_transmission could be ascribed to a forma-
tion or a condition that was peculiar to the Holy Land. His
only facts were that transmission out of a certain region,
namely the Holy Land, was disrupted, that reception
within that region was all but non-existent, and that imme-
diately surrounding the transmitter there was somewhat
symmetrical perturbation in the phenomena. Could satel-
lite activity be responsible? His scan of NATO orbits, or file
in the Denmark National Library, showed that there was
no terrestrically synchronous orbits centered over the
region. In fact, passovers occurred only once every two
weeks.

Parks turned his pursuit 180 degrees, and instead of
trying to pinpoint what it was that was actually causing the
disturbance, he set about finding possible ways to generate
the effect. As a starting point, he examined mathematical
forms which reflected the phenomenon. Eliminating the
possibility that transmission was being completely destruc-
tively superimposed, he set about finding the waveforms
that would yield the fuzzy, black images that emanated
from the Holy Land. Interestingly enough, the solution
was relatively simple. The superposition of duplicate wave-
form, with packet velocity just slightly less than c would
provide the blackening effect.

Having arrived at this information, he needed to find out
how to generate such a waveform. Of course, several mil-
lion pounds sterling in electronics would suffice. What
remained a mystery was the source of such a waveform in
the middle of a roughly medieval culture. A society whose
technology was as primitive as the rocks and stones they
lived in. Parks was determined to find out how such a
second ”transmitter”could exist in that region. He tinkered
with the thought that a device, the so-called Arc, could be in
the area. His one time friend Barnes would certainly have
known anything that was known on the subject, but his
altercation with Barnes placed him on tenuous grounds,
where the transmission device was concerned. But the
more he thought about it, the more he convinced himself
that Barnes would provide the vital clue.

He approached Barnes one afternoon, ostensibly to
strike up a friendly chat about history. He probed Barnes
about the Holy Land, and the possibility of the Arc resting
there.

15

”OH, ho—ho, no, quite not, my good man. Such a relic in
the hands of the Moslem nation would not last very long. It
might interest you that the Moslems have an ’Arc’ of their
own, at Mecca. Their great stone, a massive thing it is, is
the very center of Moslem thoughts. It must be seen and
prayed to once in every Moslem’s life, or that life be in
spiritual peril. Quite a marvel, don't you think?” Barnes
said rosily. He was fascinated by the various forms of
religion found throughout the world, and one day hoped to
find a common thread running through them all.

Parks was begining to form an idea, but was still in the
dark. ”Tell me, Barnes, what is the stone like?”

”Well, it is located in the center of a stadium, with a
smooth, flat pebbled surface surrounding it. The stadium is
immense, as each day many thousands of pilgrims gather
for the holy ceremony. They circle the stone, and pray, for
many hours. The stone itself was cut to a simple, rectangu-
lar shape, with a square base and parallel sides, and rises
about 4 meters above the ground. The sides face remarka-
bly true to the four geographic directions. It is up to specu-
lation as to what type of mineral it is.”

”Do you mean that it is made of an unknown material, or
just that no one knows what material it is made of?” Parks
asked.

”What I mean is, that the stone may be composed of one
of several materials, but you would be tempting a major
Moslem upheaval if you tried to get near the stone, or tried
to obtain a piece of the stone.”

Well, Parks was satisfied that he had at last found the
source of the problem. He had one essential clue that
Barnes, and the rest of the world, did not have. He knew
that the stone could affect the transmission of his ”toy’s"
signals. A bit of detective work, and Parks convinced him-
self that he had found the exact type of stone that lay in
Mecca. It turned out to be a rare, but not unkown crystal
form of tournalite, a ternary paramagnetic mineral. What
was unusual about the crystal form was its mode of trans-
formation, which involved a rapid heating period to 1344
degrees Farenheit under atmospheric pressure. It didn't
escape Parks’ attention that geological temperatures did
exist in that range, but never at atmospheric pressure. He
wondered, in a disinterested way, about how such condi-
tions could be produced in a pre—technological world.

Parks next move was to verify the conclusion by direct
experimentation. He managed to obtain a sample of the
tournalite, a crude, rough clump of black rock. Following
the description of the Mecca stone supplied to him by
Barnes, Parks contracted a local monument cutter to
fashion a Mecca stone, in miniature. He placed the minia-
ture in the field behind his home, and set up a transmitter
close by. He then went into the viewing room to observe
the effects. He activated the machine, and was surprised to
find that reception was normal. He focused his attention on
Mecca, and once again received nothing. The true monu-
ment seem to still be at work.

It occurred to him that perhaps, like a lens, the stone
merely was a focusing agent for some terrestrial field, in
which case its position and orientation on the ground might
be of import. Recalling that Barnes said the Mecca stone
was aligned to face North, South, East, and West, he
grabbed a small compass and tramped on out to the field to

line up the miniature. When he got the thing to the position
he wanted, he returned to the viewing room for a look; he
was quite happy to find that indeed a slight disruption was
occurring. He was encouraged, and so decided to bring the
monument into as best alignment as possible. A small radio
controlled turntable was all he needed. He put the minia-
ture upon it and returned to the room. He tuned into the
field, and the miniature. Activating the turntable, he saw
the miniature turn, and as it approached a certain orienta-
tion, he saw the image was becoming clouded, and took on
the look of an over—powered transmitter. He adjusted his
reception unit, weaker and weaker, but still was receiving a
very fuzzy image, but he seemed to be picking up on some
other image. He had decreased the attenuation to the point
where no image was normally received, and still he could
view the field and the miniature. The pleasant ambience
which he generated normally was drifting away.

As he studied the images, he begin to observe a pattern in
the interference. He guessed that some kind of secondary
broadcast was coming over the signals. By remote control,
he shut off the transmitter. For several minutes, he con-
tinued to receive a broadcast. Naturally, this should have
not occurred. He concluded that the miniature was acting
as a sort of capacitor, and was triggered by the signal being
sent out by the transmitter. He wanted to observe the fade
out again, so he reactivated the transmitter.
utes! He had roughly doubled the size of the miniature, and
yet had more than quadrupled the fade out time. He was
pleased, but only hungrier for explanations. He replayed
the fade out many times through the viewing system. He

When the image he received was perfectly clear, he
nearly went off his rocker! How could such freakish, fin-
icky activity be explained? Again, he contracted the monu-
ment cutter to cut another miniature, but slightly larger.
He placed the miniature on the turntable and started up the
transmitter. He observed a nice, cloudy image, and let it go

16

on for a while. But before he turned off the transmitter, he
attached a digital interface to the receiver, to record the
fade-out broadcast. When the transmitter was shut down,
the fade-out began, and this time lasted over twenty min-
felt that each time he viewed it he became more cognizant
of something, something just recognizable. He wondered if
somehow the broadcast during the fade out was nothing
more than a scrambled transmission. He developed an algo-
rithm within the playback processor that would more or
less translate into recognizable forms. His first playback
attempt nearly gave him a fright. What he saw was a high
speed collage of images, a mad scrambling of events, and
faces, similar only to the image he obtained when he first
experienced the entire global tansmission. Somehow, the
miniature had captured millions of bits of information and
had broadcast them by way of waves in a very short, dis-
creet way. Parks was curious as to what information had
been transferred into his computer, but to find out, he had
to first slow down the display rate roughly 83%, just so he
could deal with it. He observed, in Park—scape fashion,
every event that had transpired in a four-hundred mile
radius, beginning with the stones’ first being brought into
geographical alignment. He viewed the recorded informa-
tion several times to see if, by digital processing, he could
eliminate the last bits of cloudiness. He found that the
recorded broadcast contained another tier of information.
He guessed that the hidden level of information was
another form of fade-out broadcast. He attempted to
resolve the second tier, but was unable.

Parks was hoping that perhaps the second tier might
possibly be some form of premonition, as he originally tried
to develop many years ago. He knew that the fade-out
broadcast was caused in some way by the transmission
signals from his old transmitter. If the transmitter acted as
a trigger, then perhaps he could trigger the fade-out broad-
cast in such a way that the first and second tiers of fade-out
could be distinguised. He supposed that, like most crystals,
the miniature would be sensitive to some frequencies, or
perhaps many, like a piezo—electric crystal. He began to lay
out plans for a very elaborate triggering system which
would be able to segregate the two tiers. What he gener-
ated was beyond his wildest fancy. The stone turned out to
be a very complex capacitor indeed! Like an onion, the stone
was draped in tier upon tier of information, and each one
corresponded to various periods of history. He began sort-
ing through each tier, and discovered that tier after tier,
there was some twelve years of daily events recorded. The
miniature stone had generated eighteen tiers in all, which
gave him access to about 216 years of detailed information.

When Parks realized that the Mecca stone was sitting
there in the Holy Land, containing potentially the entire
history of mankind he was thrilled. But he was caught on
the knife edge of his own invention. The Mecca stone was
idly sitting here being bombarded by his transmitter. He
wondered how long the stone could be bombarded by
transmissions and still maintain its usefulness. He
scrambled his wits together, and analyzed the situation,
and was faced with a critical dilemma, of how to retrieve
the information. The triggering system he used on the
miniature would not be capable of processing a stone that
large. he was also faced with the possibility of losing all data
if the fade-out broadcast was not handled properly.

He finally decided that the Mecca stone would have to be
”desorbed” of information by peeling off tier after tier as
the transmission frequency was continuously varied. What
compounded the problem was that the local transmitter
was broadcasting in a frequency range that was nearly in
the middle of the frequency range that was nearly in the
fade-out. He solved the problem by using two extra trans-
mitters, one which would pan the frequencies below the
local output, and one which would pan the frequencies
above the local output. Perhaps his largest predicament
was transporting all of this equipment into close enough
range. Once again, he called upon his friend Barnes for
assistance. Parks did his best to convey the nature of the
machinery, but Barnes was not a very technical sort. He
was sufficiently tempted by the prospect of gaining the vast
library of historical information which he himself was look-
ing for. Afer all, he had his own ambitions.

Three very nervous weeks passed. Barnes tried to put
together the backing for a somewhat large historical expe-
dition into the Holy Land. Not a single University he spoke
to would sponsor the effort, because of the political ten-
sions that existed. In the end, Barnes and Parks had to
finance the trip themselves. As they both had the necessary
credentials, passage into the country was not a problem.
The trucking of the equipment was nerve wracking. Parks
labored almost non—stop for two days setting up the two
secondary transmitters, calibrating them for initial fre-
quency and sweep rate. All the while, Parks was sweating
out a deep fear that useful information was long since lost.
The normal image was still cloudy, so he had hope.

He finally satisfied himself that everything was in order.
Like a missile countdown, he and Barnes went through a
checklist that began with power generator status and
ended with sanclstorm conformation. They knew that they
had one shot. Period. Parks took a deep breath, turned to
Barnes, and said, almost whisper, ”Commence”. Like
machines, Parks and Barnes began their journey into the
annals of history. The information began pouring out. For
nearly three days and nights, the information poured out.
In the end, Barnes and Parks were on the borderline
between delerium and comatose exhaustion. But they had
succeeded in grand fashion. They had catalogued close to
twenty thousand years of global information; the meteoro-
logical information alone would have filled several libraries
(Luckily they had digital computers). In a single stroke,
they had accomplished more than all the major historians
had done in several centuries.

Parks was satisfied with the results of the expedition. He
amused himself for hours, just rummaging through the
images, observing various events that were historically
significant. He also spent time observing things like the
first Olympic games, a classic performance of orchestral
music directed by none other than Toscanini.

Barnes busied himself with his lifelong effort to sum-
marize the basic nature of culture. He wanted badly to look
back into the past, to the verge of human existance. What
he found however, was that the storage banks only con-
tained information that dated back to the time of construc-
tion of the stone. So like all the others who had tried to
piece together the great mystery, he was confined to a
limited source of information. His limits were enormous,
but none-the-less, his information provided only a basis for
theory, and not substantive proof.

17

Barnes was no genius with the computer, so he enlisted
the aid of Parks. He neatly explained that there was, in his
mind, a commonality present in all cultures. Many theories
existed which attempted to enunciate such a grand scheme,
but none were yet successful. Barnes further explained
what he wanted out of the machine, which was for the
machine to piece together various possible parameters and
conditions into a prioritized search. The intent of the
search was to define the prime motivation, or better put,
the meaning of life.

When Parks explained that the computer might be able to
do this feat, he made certain to inform Barnes of the need
for an entire source of definitions oflanguage transferrals,
and the like. Barnes said he was aware of this, and said he
had an idea. He had long believed that, as the tradition goes,
we were all related somehow. What he wanted to do was to
construct a huge family tree, back to the point where the
stone's information ceased. At each step of the way, the
individuals noted would carry several hundred ”flags" that
helped to describe that individual. In a way, Barnes was
trying to perform gene mapping, without the aid of sophis-
ticated microscopic equipment. Eventually, a very large
bank of information would be collected, and from that pool
of knowledge, Barnes wanted to back track. He wanted to
extend the family tree back to wherever it began.

Parks was not sure such a routine would yield valid
results, but he dove in and got to the nasty business of
programming huge file searches. As before, he needed
simply to locate a piece of information within the system
itself. Like a huge encyclopedia pasted together out of
alphabetical order, his data files contained nearly every-
thing he needed to know, except where to find it. Eventu-
ally though, he did get the project underway. He arranged a
cascade of operations, so that simple aquisition tasks would
be performed, and then ”flagging”, and then insertion into
the characterization program.

Days past. And then days into weeks. The computer kept
grinding out the information, while Barnes and Parks kept
dutifully monitoring the operating system. Late in the
afternoon, of a Tuesday, the magic sound of the line printer
appeared. Parks and Barnes chuckled, a futile and embar-
rassed sort of chuckle, when all they saw on the paper was a
collection of numbers and letters. They asked each other
”What does this mean?" but neither had any idea. Parks
banged away on the teletype for several moments, and sat
back. Several tense moments past until the line printer
again sprang into action. This time, it printed out an assort-
ment of words. It read: ”Indicated point of origin non-solar.
Indicated date of ascencion, unspecified, Most probable
destiny, return.” To Parks and Barnes, the message was
obvious. They probed into the data for more, something
that would allow them to continue their lives as before. The
last remaining clue to the message was an explanation of
the first, cryptic, mysterious collection of letters and
number. The explanation was that the notation repres-
ented celestial coordinates. Parks and Barnes envisioned a
world torn apart by the disclosure of their findings, and
quietly agreed to simply share their secret apprehension.
And wait.

Buckle-up or Else?

by Deborah Burks and Stephen F rezza

Last year, over 40,000 people across the nation died in automobile
accidents. Certainly, some of these deaths could have been prevented had
the victims been wearing seatbelts. Publicly funded advertisements
attempted to impress this notion. One memorable attempt portrayed a
life-squad member at the scene ofa fatal crash stating: "I never took a
seatbelt off a dead man." In order to more forcibly convey this message,
the State of New York recently enacted seatbelt legislation requiring the
driver and any front passengers to wearseatbelts. Currently, discussions
in Congress involve the enacting of some-form of national seatbelt
legislation or policy.

Obviously the purpose of these governmental actions
and discussions are to reduce the number of highway fatali-
ties nationwide. The way lawmakers propose to reduce this
number is through the increased use of seatbelts and/or the
widespread installation of passive restraint devices (in par-
ticular, airbags and automatically buckling seatbelts). It is
also obvious that the government's purpose cannot be
faulted, but the methods that they propose need to be
debated.

Among the founding principles of our nation are the
notions that the government has a duty to protect its
citizens, but it is also obliged to avoid unnecessary infringe-
ments on personal freedoms. Up to now the government
has been trying to adhere to these two principles by utiliz-
ing seatbelt advertisements. Although these campaigns
have been helpful in raising the issue in the public’s mind,
(thankfully without trodding upon the individual citizen's
rights), these measures have been insufficient. Current
highway accident statistics clearly indicate that a more
far-reaching action is warranted. An even stronger consid-
eration in favor of more stringent measures would be to
visit the victim of a serious accident who had not been
wearing his seatbelt. His pain and anguish speaks loudly to
the importance of seatbelt use. This is especially true when
one considers that his injuries could have been prevented
or reduced by the use of a safety restraint.

One option that is currently being discussed in Congress
is the madatory installation of passive restraint devices in
new automobiles. ”Passive restraints” usually refers to
either airbags or automatically buckling seatbelts. Such a
measure could very easily be forced upon the car manufac-
turers and importers. In the case of automatically buckling
seatbelts, the consumer can (if he would so desire) easily
circumvent their use. (Take for instance how many consu-
mers have disconnected seatbelt buzzers in the past.) Air-
bags have been shown to be about as effective as seatbelts
and unlike automatic seatbelts, there would be no imme-
diate benefit from disconnecting them. Therefore, once
installed, they could save lives. They are, however, very

18

expensive unlike automatic seatbelts. It is estimated that
they would increase the cost of new cars by about $800.
Automatic seatbelts would cost about one—tenth of this
amount. Airbags, at first, would seem to pose no major
limitation on one’s personal freedom, because unlike other
safety restraint measures, they require no physical effort.
However, this seems a high penalty to indiscriminately
impose upon those persons responsible enough to wear
seatbelts of their own accord. Why should one who chooses
to wear a seatbelt, a device as effective as an airbag, be
forced to pay for such a highly priced superfluous piece of
equipment? Automatic seatbelts remove the choice for one
to not wear a seatbelt (unless they are disconnected , which
defeats the purpose of the law.)

It would seem that airbags ought to be available to the
responsible consumer as a choice in safety restraints. How-
ever, indiscriminate, mandatory installations of such devi-
ces is unfair. Because the required installation of
untampered automatic seat belts forcibly removes the cap-
ability of a driver to exercise his free will in choosing to
wear a restraining device. This loss of freedom severely
minimizes its cost—effectiveness.

If you agree with this much, what then is our govern-
ment’s resonsibility concerning seatbelts? It is to try to get
as many as possible of our nation's drivers to wear seatbelts
without infringing upon their personal liberties. When
governmental actions are being considered, the criteria for
their examination must hinge upon these responsibilities,
as well as the practicality of the measures to be introduced.

Such an analysis of cost-efficiency would need to include
several major points of consideration. The foremost con-

 

sideration is the effectiveness of the proposed action, for an
ineffective measure would render all other points moot. In
order for a measure to be effective, it must get people to
wear seatbelts, as well as be enforceable. Another govern-
mental consideration of a measure's effectiveness is the
price tag of its implementation and continuation. The next
consideration of an action is how it would affect personal
freedoms. In order to determine if a measure is cost-
efficient, its enforcability, monetary cost and cost to per-
sonal liberty must be weighed together. (The important
assumption being made here is that these personal rights
are very highly valued, and cannot be adequately consi-
dered in economic terms.)

A logical place to begin an examination of the various
legislative methods would be to start with the type of
legislation recently signed into law in Albany, New York.
Such a law requires the wearing of seatbelts by any persons
seated in the front of the car. Most variations on this type
of law stipulate that persons in violation of this law incur a
fine. Will this get more people to wear seatbelts and is this
enforceable? In order to insure widespread compliance to
such a law, one should choose between two options: Either
random safety checkpoints would be required (dubious in
their effectiveness), or the mandatory installation of highly
visible seatbelts (such as obtrusive, flourescent orange) in
all new cars. The costs should also be examined. Safety
checkpoints would seem expensive and an unwarranted
drain on our current highway patrol resources. The cost of
new automobiles would only minimally be affected by the
installation of brightly colored seatbelts. Also, the wides-
pread use of safety checkpoints would not seem to insure
one's personal liberties. (Of course, in a police state no laws
would have to be written to incorporate such an action.)
Highly visible seatbelts would seriously hamper one's right
to obtain any aesthetic value in the interior of one's car.
This is an imposition, and it treats people like children for it
not only demands one's compliance to the law, but also the
constant verification of that compliance.

The last option to be considered here involves economic
incentive rather than direct legal tampering. Automobile
insurance policies could be made available which require
the insured motorist and his passengers to use seatbelts or
for the insured car to be equipped with an airbag in order
for personal injury claims to be honored. In a serious acci-
dent, it is easy to determine whether or not a person was
wearing a seatbelt; therefore, compliance to such a policy
could be verified in such a case. This option circumvents the
need for police actions leaving the matter in the civil juris-
diction. The foreseeable cost of such a plan is the possible
loss of insurance claim money. If a driver is unable to meet
such costs, the government must often absorb them
through social programs. This option has the unusual
benefit that it can actually save a consumer money. Insu-
rance companies should be able to provide such policies at
reduced rates. Since seatbelts minimize injuries and deaths,
the insurance companies’ costs are also minimized.
Another benefit of such a method is that it attempts to
minimize personal freedoms rather than restrict them.
This is accomplished by retaining one's freedom to choose
whether or not to wear a seatbelt; and moreover, by offer-
ing an economic benefit for being responsible. Such benef-
its have the much desirable characteristic of appealing to

19

one's intelligence, common sense, and more poignantly, his
wallet.

After examining insurance incentives for the use of
safety restraints, it is evident that they are not only cost-
effective, but are also an overall desirable method. Their
cost, the possible loss of money from insurance claims, is
minimal. Also, because they do not limit one's rights, they
pose no threat to one's personal freedoms. Most impor-
tantly, they can appeal to the intelligence of the consumer
rather than insult it! Unfortunately, this method cannot
guarantee as widespread a usage of safety restraints as
those previously mentioned. It would, however, increase
the motorists’ awareness of the need for such safety pre-
cautions as people closely read documents as important as
insurance policies.

In summary, all three of these methods, mandatory seat-
belt usage, ~mandatory passive restraint installation, and
the use of insurance incentives, address the issue and
importance of increasing the nationwide usage of collision
restraint devices. A mandatory seatbelt law, if strongly
enforced, would increase seatbelt usage, yet such enforce-
ment would require a great amount of police effort and an
intrusion into citizens’ rights. Passive restraint legislation
has such definite advantages that it does not require police
action, and it will insure a large increase in the usage of
safety restraints (especially if airbags are required). How-
ever, it is perhaps the most unjust method because it
seriously penalizes those who currently wear seatbelts.
The last technique mentioned, an insurance incentive, has
the unique advantage that it does not remove any personal
freedoms. On the other hand, it cannot insure as marked an
increase in the use of safety belts as more stringent legisla-
tion could.

The questions surroundings this issue are indeed diffi-
cult ones. How can one strike a balance between trying to
save lives and the intrusion into personal freedoms that
result from such attempts? How far should the govern-
ment go in restricting these personal freedoms in the name
of protection? How much must the government do in order
to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities? How much
responsibility should be left up to the citizen? Since there is
no perfect solution, what is the best compromise? These
are the questions that our legislatures must address.

(1) Later this month, Rickie and Ronnie Race ‘Car Driver
will be driving on the racetrack shown below. Rickie will
drive on the smaller two circles, each of which is ten miles
in circumference. He will travel at a constant rate of sixty
miles per hour. Ronnie will travel at a constant rate of
ninety miles per hour on the larger two circles. Thus,
Ronnie will have to go forty miles further than Rickie to
complete his course. If they start the race touching each
other and a team from Skyscraper Engineer measures the
distance between the two at that instant and every five
minutes thereafter, what will they find to be the average
distance between the two, to the nearest foot?

(2) The following standings actually occurred in 1968 in a
dream that M3 had in 1967:

TEAM W L

Los Angeles 80 55
San Francisco 79 56
Pittsburgh 78 57
Cincinnati 77 58
Milwaukee 72 63
Philadelphia 63 72
St. Louis 58 77
Chicago 57 78
Houston 56 79
New York 55 80

As you know, the season is 162 games, and coincidentally
each team has the same number of games left with each
other team. According to Cincinnati's sensational rookie
catcher, each team will continue to pray for the pennant
until it is mathematically out of it. How many teams are still

praying?

(3) For the series below, find the missing number and
explain your reasoning:

182, 72, 192, 56, 90, , 168, 105

Hint: This series is uncommonly referred to as a ”poetic
progression.”

(4) If k is a positive integer, n is a non-negative integer, and
kln is less than or equal to 2, what is the sum of the digits of
(10 at *(3k+(7n)n+11)+13)2.7

I-Iint: The derivative of 7n2 = 14n. Since kln is less than or
equal to 2, k is less than or equal to Zn, therefore 14n is
greater than or equal to 7k!

(5) In the bridge tournament pictured above, M3 had a
pretty good hand and bid "one spade." His partner had
seven spades, no red cards, and responded ”four spades.”
Then, to their surprise, their opponent, Chris Smith, bid
”seven no trump," laid down all of her cards, and said, ”The
lead is immaterial. I've made the bid." M3 realized that
Chris had the minimum possible number of high card
points necessary to pull such a stunt. How many high card
points did Chris have? For non—bridge players, chapter one
of a bridge handbook should provide all the information
needed for this caper.

The following poem was unearthed by the Skyscraper Engi-
neer historian. It was written by M3 when he was nine years
old. (Editor's note: This was indeed written by M3 at the age
of nine. No kidding.) According to M3, learning it may be
beneficial.

My mommy helps me learn and grow.
She helps me everyday.

She knows when to say yes or no,
Even when it's May.

She is also very smart,

And makes decisions well.

I don't like it when we're apart,
I think she's pretty swell.

The solutions to the April Skycaper are given below. The
$25 prize winner, Tom Lithgow, had four correct. Con-
gratulations, Tom, on a job well done and on your recent
marriage.

(1) A ”Kachavud” is a cycloid. The diameter equals 96 feet
which equals 32 pagagers. The area of a cycloid is 3/4  d-’- =
768  square pagagers. The depth of the pool is 6 feet
which equals 2 pagagers. Therefore, the volume of the pool
is 1536  cubic pagagers.

(2) Georgie saves 25 cents a month or 3 dollars per year. He
starts with zero. If he adds 3 dollars and multiplies by it 1.07
each year, he will have $4221.12 at the end of 1983.

(3) 1008. We simply multiply the previous number by 16
then add 16.

(4) In order to win in the least possible number of moves,
Craig must win the match in four straight games. In the
‘first game, Craig is black and wins in two moves. In the
next three games, Craig is white and wins in three moves
each game. Thus, Craig makes a total of eleven moves.

(5) A full house in ”Benedum Poker” is a prime number that
contains three of one digit and two of another. The smallest
such number is 11177.

Quarks and Gluons: Physics for the 1990’s

Continued from page 9

For some time after the quark model of hadrons had been
proposed, there appeared to exist a fundamental problem
with the model; namely, if the proton and neutron do
indeed consist of quarks, then why cannot one smash two
protons together and thereby dislodge the quarks? After
all, nuclear physicists have for some time been smashing
one nucleus against another, therby dislodging protons and
neutrons along with other kinds of particles. If one could
isolate a fractionally-charged particle like the quark, then
such a particle would be rather easy to identify using mod-
ern particle detection methods. Many searches for
fractionally—charged particles were conducted during the
early days of the quark model but no such particles were
observed. Physicists were finally forced to conjecture that
it impossible to isolate a quark and that the explanation lies
with the particular force field that holds the quarks
together in the hadron.

Gluons

The electron and proton of a hydrogen atom are held
together by the electical forces between their charges. This
force varies inversely as the square of the separation dis-
tance between them and when their separation distance
becomes large, this attractive force vanishes. A quantum
mechanical picture of the interaction between electron and
proton consists of their continually exchanging a quantum
of electromagnetic energy, or a photon. The current pic-
ture of quarks has them held together within the hadron by
a force which does not vanish as their separation distance
becomes large, hence, an infinite amount of energy is
required to separate them, i.e., to isolate a quark. The
quantum of energy which is exchanged between them is
called a gluon.

b) Energy is stored in the ”spring” connecting the two

c) The spring ”breaks” and the energy stored in the spring
is converted into a quark-antiquark pair.

d) The original quark and antiquark are separated but are
”dressed” and emerge as a T! "l" and 1T° meson.

Suppose one attempts to separate the u and the dquarks
in aTl’+meson. Representing the restoring force between
quark and antiquark as being due to a ”spring" as shown in
Figure 1, one sees that the larger the separation distance
between the two quarks, the greater is the energy stored in
the spring. To isolate one quark from another, which is
equivalent to establishing a large (or infinite) distance
between the two, would require an infinite energy which is
not available in nature. Instead, the string may”break"and
the stored energy would be transformed into the mass of a
quark-antiquark pair which in this case is a d and d pair. As
shown in Figur_e 1, the original u quark combines with th<_a
newly-created d quark to form a11"'meson and the original d
quark combines with the newly-created d quark to form
the1T°meson. Hence, the original quarks will separate from
one another but will emerge as particles that are
observable.

Figure 2 represents a process involving the collision of a
Tl"meson and a proton to form a K0 meson and a /\°hyperon,
according to the reaction

'rT'+p——>K°+/\°

The process is interpreted in terms of the quark-antiquark
composition of the initial and final state particles, and is
characterized by the annihilation of a uﬁ pair of quarks to
form an s§ pair required by the final state K0 and /\°. Note
that particle reactions take place by the rearrangement of
constituent quarks in addition to annihilation and quark
pair creation processes and never involve isolated quarks
which, as we have seen above, cannot exist.

Finally, as we have noted, the quantum of energy asso-
ciated with the force between quarks is the gluon. Just as
the photon can be emitted by an atom, so can a gluon be
emitted from a hadron in a high energy collision between

hadrons. The theory which describes the interaction
between quarks and gluons is called Quantum Chromodyrmm—
ics. Clearly this name implies some sort of color property of
quarks and gluons and in order to make the theory work,
physicists have assigned an additional quantum number to
both quarks and gluons which they have arbitrarily decided
to call color. This quantum number can take three values
which are taken to be red, green or blue although on could
just as well have assigned gray, black and brown because
the quantum number has nothing to do with color as we
know it. The quark within the hadron will have one of
these three colors assigned to it at any particular time, and
the gluons which hold the quarks together have combina-
tions of these colors assigned to them. One can never
observe bare color or in other words, one is never allowed to
observe a free quark or a free gluon. These particles must

Figure 3 is a sketch of the target-silicon strip detector
system to be used in the experiment. Six X-Y modules are
positioned as shown with two located upstream of the
target to establish the coordinates of an incident beam
particle responsible for a collision of interest which will
sometimes occur in the aluminum target. The four X-Y
modules located downsteam of the aluminum target serve
to establish the trajectories of the individual hadrons asso-
ciated with the hadron shower produced in the collision.
Shown on the sketch is a computer—generated shower of
hadrons which is very similar to the showers that will
actually be obtained once data acquisitions begins.

The fabrication of silicon strip detectors represents
state-of-the—art technology and is presently being done
commercially only in France and England. The high energy
physics group, in collaboration with the Westinghouse
Research Labs in Pittsburgh, is attempting to fabricate

always emerge from an interaction in a ”dressed” manner,
i.e., along with other quarks so as to form the kinds of
particles which we can observe, including those in Table 1.
Observable particles are said to be color neutral or in other
words, a baryon (three quarks) has a red quark, a green
quark and a blue quark and the sum of these three colors is
neutral. Likewise, a meson has a red quark and an anti-red
quark, a green and anti—green quark or a blue and anti-blue
quark, all of which are color neutral. In very high energy
collisions, the quarks and gluons dress themselves as jets of
observable mesons and baryons. These jets consist oflarge
numbers of hadrons that emerge from the collison point in
a highly—collimated fashion. It is the study of these jets and
what is learned from them that is one of the central activi-
ties of the experimental high energy physics group at Pitt.

obtaining them abroad and avoid the logistics problems
associated with procurement at great distances. Figure 4 is
a microphotograph of a section of a silicon strip detector
fabricated at the Westinghouse Research Labs for the Pitt
high energy effort. The spacing between the p—lines
appearing on the lower half of the figure is 50um. The
extensions to the lines which appear to be canoe paddles are
in fact bonding pads to which the electrical connections to
the external preamplifiers are made. Adjacent lines are read
out in this fashion at opposite sides of the wafer. In order to
facilitate the development of high technology instrumenta-
tion such as silicon strip detectors, an Advanced Technol-
ogy Laboratory has been extablished within the Physics
and Astronomy Department with funds from the Ben
Franklin Partnership program recently begun by the state
of Pennsylvania as well as funds from the University Capi-
tal Fund Drive. With continued support of this kind, Pitt
can become a center for the development of state—of—the-
art silicon detectors.

News from Benedum Hall

AI Computer Arrives

Artificial Intelligence has reached Benedum Hall. The
School of Engineering recently received a Data General
MV1000O Eclipse supermini computer for AI development.
The machine was given by Westinghouse and Data General
for the Artificial Intelligence Development Project, which
is to be headed by Dr. Caine and Dr. Holtzeman, both of
Electrical Engineering. The contract with Data General
includes a copy of every useable piece of sofeware that Data
General has written for the MV1000O.

The MV1000O is a software and hardware compatible
upgrade of the Eclipse MV8000, the computer featured in
the recent book Soul ofa New Machine. It is a 32-bit supermini,
with a four gigabyte logical addressing capability and room
for sixteen megabytes of physical memory, half of which is
now installed. The MV1000O is about twice as fast as the
VAX 11/780, which puts it near the top of its class. The
speed is accomplished with the aid of fast disk units and
double-caching.

Other equipment received for use with the MVIOOOO
include two hard disk units totalling about seven hundred
megabytes of storage, several Data General terminals, and
a very high resolution color graphics terminal.

Cooks You May Have Missed

by Susan Pirollo

As upperclassman know, and freshmen are soon to find
out, the culinary wizardry of the Pitt cafeterias is some-
what limited. So when your tastebuds are dying for a
change from the prepackaged mass processed food, here
are a few suggestions.

For starters there is pizza, the long time staple food of
college students. For those of us who are too lazy or too
busy to chase after dinner, there are several good pizza
places that will deliver just about anywhere; most even
deliver it hot. I've tried a number of shops, all of which have
good pizza, and if dinner has to be there in a hurry, the
guaranteed delivery time promised by some can save you
from starvation. So if pizza tickles your fancy try Napoli,
Little Italy, Capri, Four Star or Domino.

When pizza is coming out of your ears, you may find a
welcome change in some of our local deli and sandwich
places. For instance, Blimpie's puts together a well dressed
sandwich and will even deliver. Mario's Deli, immediately
adjacent to Forbes residence hall, can save a long walk to
the cafeteria. The freshly sliced meats are a delightful
change from the typical prepackaged sandwich.

No Oakland culinary critique can slip by without singing
the praises of "The Dirty O.” The "O" (The Original Hot
Dog Shop) features the good old-fashioned frankfurter
prepared in every conceivable way. And if the hot dogs
don't suit your mood, you may be able to deal with the
strongly addictive "O-fries" and the pleasantly unpleasant
aftereffects of an O-fries overdose. The "O" also features
an incredibly long list of imported beers with funny foreign
names that you have probably never heard of in America,
as well as a whole crowd of customers who have been
appreciating similar beverages, often to the point of becom-
ing dangerously bold. For this reason, the "O" usually also
features at least one large officer of the law. Strictly for the
adventurous after dusk, simply entering the "O" (especially
when sober), let alone placing an order, gives one the ego
boosting sensaion of being the last glimmering pinnacle of
civilization in a land of savagery. For all you bold risk
takers, "O-dogs" and "O-fries" might be the cure for culi-
nary boredom.

When looking for an invigorating meal, the Yogurt Expe-
rience is an adventure your palate will not soon forget. The
escapade can be a happy one for dieters because the menu
includes many low calorie and health foods. Along the same
line, Second Plate, located in Forbes Quadrangle, offers
"make your own salad" from a choice of many different
vegetables and fruits. They also carry an assortment of
bagels, cakes, cookies, and snacks. This place is convenient
for those who have classes or study in the building or
nearby.

When American-style food becomes monotonous, go
Greek. Niko's Gyros makes fantastic gyro sandwiches and
dinners. They also specialize in other types of Greek dishes.
If walking there does not appeal to you, they deliver. If
Creek is not your choice, maybe Mexican is more appetiz-

ing. C.]. Barney's prepares a variety of Mexican dishes
which make the mouth water. They also have a separate
room with a bar where many Pitt students go to socialize. If
Mexican food is not appealing, but a relaxing socializing
place is desired, go next door to I-Iemmingways. I-Iemming-
ways specializes in American-Italian style food. This is a
restaurant where one can dress casually and still enjoy a
classy meal. Another ethnic restaurant that is worth visit-
ing is the House of Chaing. This restaurant specializes in
Chinese food. All of their dishes are interesting and savory.
What's more, their food may be eaten with either chop-
sticks or silverwear. This makes for fun eating if you've
never tried using chopsticks.

If quiet inexpensive dining is more pleasing to you, try
the Black Angus. This restaurant specializes in American-
Greek dishes. It also features an early bird special for those
who prefer to spend less but still get a delicious meal. A
variety of dishes are served, such as pasta, veal, steak, lamb,
seafood, and much more.

Regretfully, I have not been able to eat everywhere in
Oakland. I'm sure there are other good eateries which I
have not mentioned. So, next time your stomach craves a
change from the everyday cafeteria fare try one of Oak-
land's many culinary adventures.

Special thanks go to Mark Cairns and LuAnne
Schmidt for their help in the preparation of this review.

An Atomic View

by John C. Gargani

On March 1, 1984 Pitt's School of Engineering started
receiving equipment from United States Steel that will
eventually make it the largest atom probe field ion micro-
scope center in the world.

An atom probe field ion microscope (apfim) is a very
complex assemblage of machinery whose main purpose is
to allow a researcher to look directly at the core of a sub-
stance. With this device one can actually see images of
single atoms. Dr. S. Sidney Brenner said, ”It has been a
misconception for a long time that you can't actually see
atoms. It hasn't been true for twenty years." Dr. Brenner
holds a research professorship in the Metallurgy and Mate-
rials Engineering Department and is heading up the group
currently using the apfim.

The apfim basically has two main aspects. It can be used
both on a visual level and for chemical/analytical purposes.

5- Ne+ + e'—>Ne

Figure 2..|mage left by a copper-iron sample. Each concen-
tric ring is a different plane of atoms, with each bright spot
being an individual atom.

Before any experiments can be pursued, a sample of the
substance in question must be prepared for examination.
All of the specimens must have tips which are needle
shaped. This doesn't sound too bad until you find out that
the radius of curvature of the tip must be around 500 A
(5X1O—3 meters). However, Dr. Brenner said that through
electropolishing, such specimens can be fairly easily pro-
duced and reproduced. As he said, ”There is no problem
making them.” There are other ways to produce samples
beside electropolishing. An example is ion etching which is
used on insulators. The substance in question must have at
least a little conductivity for the apfim to function properly,
however.

The basic function of the visual aspect of the apfim is
merely to magnify the specimen. This magnification can
reach scales well into millions of times greater than normal.

The process of actually seeing the atoms is shown in
Figure 1. A positive voltage is placed on the tip of the
specimen. All around the sample is an inert imaging gas,
neon in this case. As the neon gets closer and closer to the

 

Figure 3.

tip with its positive voltage, one of its electrons is drawn off
of the neon atom leaving a neon ion (Ne—— Ne+ + e—). The
electron is attracted down through the tip where it is even-
tually grounded. But now, since the neon ion has a positive
charge, it is repelled perpendicularly away from the speci-
men. When the neon ion travels away it will come in con--
tact with a grounded phospher screen. Here the neon ion
picks up an electron. In doing so, the exchange causes a
burst of light which is recorded on the screen. The collec-
tion of these individual bursts of light will produce an
image similar to the one in Figure 2. Since this process is
basically a closed circuit, no charges are accumulated as the
experiment progresses.

More insight into how the apfim works can be obtained if
you think of the tip of the specimen on the atomic scale. As
can be seen in Figure 3, the sample is actually a collection of
different planes of atoms. On the edges of each plane the
field set up by the voltage is slightly higher than it is
towards the center. This causes more neon atoms to be
ionized around the edges. This in turn causes bright images
to appear on the screen. This can be seen as the circles in
Figure 2. In this case, all of the dots are actually images of
single atoms. The centers of these circles are darker
because the atoms are too close together. They must be
approximately 3 A apart. This distance is the diameter of an
average atom. You can't quite resolve the tightly packed
ones. However the atoms on the edges have much more
room and hence can be easily seen.

Shown above is one of Pitt's four new atom-probe field ion
microscopes (apfims), located in the subbasement of
Benedum Hall.

Dr. Brenner is a research professor in the MME department
and is leader of the apfim group.

If the voltage is high enough the atoms on the tip of the
specimen will begin ”peeling off." This is called field evapo-
ration. This process causes the edge atoms to break off first
because of its higher field. As one edge peels off, another is
formed, it then peels off and so on until an entire plane of
atoms has been taken off. This process allows the scientist
to remove atoms from the surface and see what is inside.
Also the removed materials can be studied.

This is where the second aspect, involving chemistry and
analysis, comes into play. By combining a time-of-flight
mass spectrometer with the field ion microscope you can
examine what structures are present in your material. In
metallurgy most work is done by heating and treating
materials until a desired property is produced. To optimize
these properties you must know what's going on and to do
this you must know your specimen on a very fine scale. The
apfim allows you to do this. Dr. Brenner said that the
chemical analysis is the hard part and that it is the most
time consuming.

By using the apfim the scientist can see the actual three-
dimensional structures of a solid. Also by knowing that a
plane of atoms is approximately 2 A thick and by counting
the disappearing planes, he has a yardstick to measure what
he is working with. Finally, if a metallurgist has an alloy,
and through heating it changes some of its properties, he
can use an apfim to tell what it is.

Before moving the equipment to Pitt, US Steel kept the
apfims at its Technical Center in Monroeville. US Steel's
gift of four microscopes is valued at over one million dol-
lars. Of the four, one is presently operating while the other
three are expected to be ready by the end of the year.

Dr. S. Sidney Brenner started at Pitt as of January 1,
1984. Before this he worked with US Steel. Dr. Brenner's
team includes John Kovalik, a full—time technician; Dr. Gra-
cie Burke, research associate; Alex Zeltser and Patrick
Camus, graduate students; and Professor William A. Soffa,
as co—investigator. Presently, Patrick Camus is using the
apfims in preparing his doctoral thesis on phase separation
in a magnet alloy.

Dr. Brenner hopes to expand this collection of apfims
into a national center with an expanded staff and work with’
oultlside people. With a few good people, it is sure that he
