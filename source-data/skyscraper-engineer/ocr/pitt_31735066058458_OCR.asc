cooling for safe shutdown of the reactor in the event of
an accident. The water, after cooling the equipment,
transfers its heat to the ultimate heat sink, which consists
of a draft cooling tower and a retention pond.

In order to successfully produce power, heat from
various radioactive components must be removed. The
Component Cooling Water System transfers its heat to
the Essential Service Water System and thus provides a
system barrierto the release of radioactive fluids.

Diesel generators provide emergency electrical
power to plant components that are vital to reactor safety.
Each generator is independent and automatically starts
within 10 seconds of power loss, providing enough
powerfor a safe plant shutdown.

The only major American nuclearmishap occured
at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1979. Small quantities of
radioactive steam were vented into the atmosphere as a
result of operator error. The majority of the highly
radioactive substances in and around the reactor core,
including partially melted fuel rods, were completely
contained. The magnitude of this accident was very
small compared to Chernobyl primarily because the

various safety systems described in this article were in
place and functioned properly. The release of
radioactive material at TMl could have been completely
prevented had the personnel implemented the proper
safety procedures. At Chernobyl, where no containment
system was present, there was nothing that the
operators could have done to prevent radoactive
substances from escaping once the accident began.

Thus, various redundant features provide
adequate plant safety in the event of an accident,
assuming that the people operating the plant use the
systems correctly. The United States maintains a
superior, although by no means perfect, record of
nuclear safety. Finally, in analysis of the safety systems
of our plants and the factors involved in the Chernobyl
accident, the evidence indicates oven/vhelmingly that an
accident on the order of Chernobyl could never occur in
the United States.

CHALLENGERS
FATAL FLAW

by Sanjiv Gupta

Shuttle mission 51-L was destined to earn a place
in history, no matter what had happened. It was the first
time since man has had the ability to fly into space that an
ordinary citizen, not a pilot, scientist, engineer or
politician, was allowed to go along for the ride. If the
mission had been flawless, it still would have been
special.

Of course, it was not flawless; in fact, as we
subsequently discovered, it was riddled with flaws. The
right solid rocket booster, alone, of the 51-L shuttle
system was estimated to have 2075 possible defects on
the morning of launch. It was this booster which pivoted
free 73 seconds after 11:38 a.m. on January 28, 1986,
after burning through its own support strut, and
punctured the immense external tank which was loaded
with millions of pounds of volatile propellants.

The results of the Rogers Commision's
investigation of the "accident" (if it can be called that) are
well known. The catastrophe can be attributed to a
flawed decision-making process before that and,
supposedly, other flights, faulty program management in
general, and seriously flawed hardware. From an
engineering standpoint, it was a poorly designed
booster joint, which had demonstrated in testing and in
actual flight that it would not maintain its integrity under all
normal flight circumstances. An inadequately structured
management system allowed the vehicle to keep flying,
even though key personnel knew that the boosters (and
at least 70 other systems) were likely to fail
catastrophically, and result in loss of mission, vehicle and
crew. Finally, on the morning of launch, managers
ignored the advice of qualified engineers and allowed
the vehicle to fly despite strong objections.

The resulting loss was not only a $2 billion orbiter
and seven crew members, but also an immeasurable loss
of national prestige and, most importantly, a loss of
America's leadership in space.

The deep—rooted causes of the mission 51-L
accident (which some experts claim has placed us ten
years behind the Soviet Union in the exploration and

exploitation of outer space) go all the way back to
America's most triumphant years in space: project Apollo.

We aimed at the moon not for scientific,
technological or adventurous reasons, but to beat the
Russians. The Russians caught us by surprise when
they launched Sputnik 1 in October, 1957. Our rockets
were still routinely blowing up on the pad, and we felt we
had to do something to show the Russians who was
boss.

Neither Congress nor the American public saw the
true potential of outer space from a commercial or
scientific standpoint; it was all just a big political stunt. A
one—shot spectacular. The United States had fifteen
minutes of manned space flight experience when
president Kennedy committed us to the goal of reaching
the moon. (Alan Shepard's' suborbital mercury flight.)

Even the people at NASA realized that the moon
program was not a permanent foothold into space. Each
Apollo mission was too prohibitively expensive ever to
be routine. The immense Saturn V moon rocket and
Apollo spacecraft were disposed of after each flight.
Only the tiny command module returned, and it ended
up in a museum. This has been compared to sending a
cruise ship on its maiden voyage across the ocean with
three people on board, and sinking it upon return.

So, as we aimed for the moon, some people with a
bit of foresight and a lot of vision planned what would be
next.

First, we needed routine access into space. A
cheap, routine launch vehicle that could be reused after
each flight was a major priority. Second, since it is easy to
move things about in space, but hard to get them there
in the first place, the reusable vehicle would only shuttle
things back and forth from low earth orbit, leaving the
task of moving things between low earth orbit and higher
orbits to a dedicated space tug. The tug would be
relatively cheap because it would stay in space all of the
time, thus eliminating costly deployment and recovery
after each mission. Finally, the routine use of outer
space dictated a permanent presence in orbit, so a space

station was called for. The station would serve as a
staging point for an eventual return to the moon (which
would be easy from earth orbit compared to Apollo), and
perhaps atrip to Mars.

All of this would have been expensive, but it
would guarantee us a permanent and leading position in
the frontier of space. Besides, the term "expensive" is
relative: even the Project Apollo was never more than a
tiny percentage of the federal budget. In addition, the
pay-off from space has been immense. Each and every
one of us is affected in more ways than we can imagine
by the space program.

The people who made these grand plans quickly
discovered that they were fooling themselves. When
Apollo 11 plopped into the ocean, it was all over. We had
"beaten the Ruskies," and now it was time for "more
important" things. Post—Apollo NASA was virtually a
gutted corpse. America wasn't prepared to invest in
space any more. That is why Challenger never returned
from her tenth mission. NASA struggled, fought, and
compromised. Some of the compromises were fatal.

It was obvious that NASA wasn't going to get a
shuttle, a tug and a station, so they had to pick one.
Since everything depended upon the shuttle, it was the
logical choice.

Now they had to sell it to Congress. It was a
shuttle with no place to go (since the station was
cancelled) so NASA began marketing it as a space truck.
It was eventually to have replaced all expendable
launchers by placing satellites into orbit dirt cheap
(perhaps as little as one—tenth the price of an
expendable), with four vehicles flying sixty times a year,
delivering two to four satellites per flight. With such an
ambitious schedule, beginning with a first flight in 1979,
the shuttle would eventually pay for itself. All this for only
$9 billion.

The original shuttle concept consisted of a large,
liquid-fueled, fly—back booster, and a winged orbiter.
Almost half the cost would have to go towards
developing the booster. It would incorporate the relative
safety of liquid fuels, could be tested independently
before committing people to space in the orbiter, and
would be very cheap to operate compared to
expendable systems. Unfortunately, even this was too
much, forcing NASA to compromise. Congress only
wanted to give NASA $5 billion to develop the world's
first reusable space vehicle, so NASA began trade-off
studies, to see if they could fit the original specifications
into half the budget.

The first thing to go was the fly-back booster. It
was replaced by solid—propellant motors which had never
previously been used for manned space flight, mainly
because they cannot be throttled or shut off once they
are lit. They were, however, cheap.

NASA still wasn't doing well on Capitol Hill. They
needed more muscle, so they went to the Department of
Defense. The military wasn't interested in manned space
flight, but they did need a system that was capable of
launching their huge spy satellites. So, another
compromise was struck: in exchange for DoD support
(no money, only political support) the orbiter cargo bay

would be expanded to fifteen by sixty feet, and the
payload capability to low earth orbit would be increased
to 65,000 pounds. These changes, along with a
requirement for a minimum 1,500 mile crossrange
capability after re—entry, resulted in a much larger and
heavier orbiter than NASA had originally envisioned.
The fuel which was to have been stored in the orbiter
was moved to a throwaway external tank. The disposable
tank would incur far higher operational costs, but it would
be much cheaperto develop than a fly-back system.

In 1972, NASA administrator James Fletcher (who
later retired from NASA and became a professor here at
Pitt, and was subsequently reappointed to his former
post by President Reagan following the Challenger
explosion) managed to obtain President Nixon's
approval of a highly compromised version of the space
shuttle. It wasn't quite the elegant machine that NASA
wanted; instead, it was a camel designed by committee.
NASA promised a lot for very little. ln selling it to
Congress, they made it sound like it would be far easier
to develop than it turned out to be.

When the orbiter Columbia finally flew into space
on April 12, 1981, it was two years behind schedule, and
several billion dollars over budget. It was also (and still is)
the most sophisticated space vehicle ever developed.
The first flight was as close to perfect as anyone could
hope for, and served as a tribute to the tremendous skill
of the people who made it work.

this remarkable flying machine was the price for all the
compromises, tradeoffs, and budget restrictions. There
were gross system deficiencies and design flaws that
were not corrected because of limited program funding.
The solid rocket booster was one of many potentially fatal
compromises.

NASA's "can-do" attitude (as it has been termed)
coupled with adequate funding in the 60s lead to
mankind's most remarkable achievements. Even then,
however, scheduling pressures and the drive to
succeed caused disaster — witness Apollo 1. In the 70s
and 80s, the same type of pressures, but without
enough money, culminated in January's disaster. If
guaranteed funding had been available to correct the
booster design flaws with minimal program delay, and
without sacrificing some other part of the program, it is
doubtful that NASA would have accepted the risks
associated with the boosters and let the shuttle fly.

Of course, nothing can justify the seriously flawed
decisions of the shuttle program's managers. There is
no excuse for comprimising the lives of astronauts in
order to keep the program on track and under budget.
The point is that the people who made the bad decisions
should not have been in a position where they were
forced to make such decisions in the first place. If
Congress had given NASA the support to build the
shuttle the way they wanted it, and to operate it as
frequently as they had wanted to, it is very likely that no
one would have been asked to trade-off safety for some

from several design
effects resulted
January 28:

- The O-rings, which are intended t0 prevent

hot gases from burning through the motor
case, are not sealed before flight. Instead, a
putty filled gap is left between the insulation
in the upper and lower segments. When the

propellant ignites, the putty is supposed to
transfer the pressure, but not the heat, to the
O-rings, thus forcing them to seal. In reality,
the putty usually had gaps which let hot gases
through, melting the O-rings. The new design
has no gap, and pre-seated O-rings.

- When the motor ignites, a burst of pressure
deforms the case and separates the space
between the tang and clevis, preventing the 0-
rings from seating. The major modification of
the new design is the capture latch, which
holds the tang and clevis together.

- Since the O-rings had to seal dynamically at
the moment of ignition, they needed to be
pliable. However in cold weather the O-rings
become stiff and can not seal. The new
design includes heating strips around the joint
to keep the O-rings warm and flexible.

- Theoretically, a single O-ring should have
created an adequate seal. The second one
was added to give a 100% factor of saftey.
Obviously, two was not enough, so a third has
been added.

other consideration.

The lesson of mission 51—L is that there is no room
for compromise in space flight. Either we are committed
to it one hundred per cent, or we don't do it at all. Man
cannot turn his back on space now, for it is an important
part of our lives, and is becoming more important. We
depend upon weather, communication and earth
resource satellites more than most people realize. Our
country's defense relies on intelligence gathering
satellites. Space holds the promise for major advances in
medicine, manufacturing and many other
seemingly unrelated fields. We've learned more about
our solar system in a few days with deep space probes,
like Voyager, than we previously knew from hundreds of
years of study. We have no choice but to commit
ourselves to space.

If we learn the right lessons, history may show that
Challenger's last mission was not a catastrophe, but a
catalyst that put us on the right track. The "Teacher in
Space" did teach us something; it remains to be seen if
anyone was listening.

Cooks You May

by Andrew Bowen

Walking down Bayard St. (or is it O'Hara, or
Bigelow, or ...?), as you approach N. Bellefield Ave., you
can see a small yellow flatbed truck emblazoned with the
words "Sweet Lou's." Regardless of whether or not you
buy anything, the man sitting beside the truck, who you
may wrongly suppose is Lou, will say, "Hi." I felt
compelled to find out more about this little eatery on the
corner. As it turns out, Lou Dayich came up with his idea
about eight months ago when he bought the truck. He
started selling hot dogs on the corner of Bayard and N.
Craig. About a month later he moved to N. Bellefield and
hired Virgil Hall, who has operated the truck since. Lou
has gone on to take classes at the Law School here at
Pitt and currently works a few other jobs. You can find
Virgil running the stand weekdays from around 9:30 A.M.
until 5:30 P.M. On football weekends

Virgil pedals kielbasa for $2.00, hot dogs for
$1.00, and iced tea and lemonade for $0.50 (small) and
$1.00 (large). There is a free refill with drinks. He also
sells coffee for $0.50. On occasion, Virgil whips up the
"special sauce," the recipe of which he keeps secret.
While it was not available the day I was there, a few
passersby did request the sauce and vouched for its
flavor. Virgil says that the sauce is a mix of a meat sauce
and a barbecue sauce.

Virgil will be there until it gets too cold, and then
he will be back with the spring thaw. He enjoys meeting
people, most of whom are college students. One art
student spent about two weeks making sketches of Virgil
for a class. The current boast of the stand is that the hot
dogs have been voted best in Oakland by Sweet Lou's
Magazine, which may someday be published. For now,
Virgil hopes to finish his GED and perhaps get a job as a
DJ for a night club, which is what he did before he began
working for Lou.

I tried the kielbasa. It was very good. Even
though the Gulf station is only a block away, and a bit
cheaper, there is something about charcoal grilled
kielbasa that makes the extra cost worth it. The business
is thriving. in the half- hourthat l was there (2:30 - 3:00),
he sold five hot dogs and several glasses of lemonade.
While I waited for my kielbasa to cook, I enjoyed a few
glasses of lemonade and conversing with Virgil. Things
to look for in the future include the first edition of Sweet
Lou's Magazine and another stand. All in all, give it a try.

Boundary Street cleaves the embankments of
Panther Hollow. At once, it sets apart Carnegie Mellon
University (sans Mellon Institute), and points East, from
the University of Pittsburgh, the Health Center,
Carneg‘ie's conjunx, and points West. On the other
hand, South Craig Street, a thoroughfare and
commercial venue, is a ligature which binds again those
two parts, as well as leading North. On Henry Street —- a
brief crossarm to the trunk of South Craig —- there once
was located a livery stable. Subsequently, the People's
Cab Company garage was built there. A more central
location could not have been chosen —— whether for
horses in the suburb of Bellefield (as that part of what is
now Oakland was then known) or for taxicabs in urban
Oakland. Nowadays, at 451 6 Henry Street stands UTDC I-
——University Technology Development Center I —— and
none the more surprising that it does, given its pontine
raison d’etre.

UTDC is owned and operated by RIDC —— the
Regional Industrial Development Corporation.
Skyscraper Engineer interviewed Beth Brestensky, who
is RlDC's representative on site at UTDC I. As she
explains, "RlDC saw the need for support of the
entrepreneurial sector in the University
Hospital/Academic area of Oakland. UTDC I is a multi-
tenant building with shared common services,
administered by RIDC. It houses startup companies, as
well as existing companies developing a new product or
service. Some are spin-offs from the University or

Hospital segment."
The shared services include a conference room,
secretarial services, copy services, a meeting-

coordination service, and general information-retrieval.
This is quite helpful to any new company. Moreover,
space in the building is made available below market rate

13

"to encourage more of the start—up company's funds to
go to development," says Brestensky. If a tenant wants
to modify the design of an office, RIDC will finance the
construction (pending, of course, their initial approval of
the change), with the cost to be paid over the course of
the lease term, which has a three-year maximum.

The building itself had lain fallow for a few years,
after it had ceased to be a garage for taxis. During that
time, it was owned by Carnegie Mellon University. RIDC
purchased the building from the university, and began
the renovation in September of 1983. The architect was
the Pittsburgh firm of Williams Trebilcock Whitehead
(WTW.) (Among other renovations for which WTW has
been responsible are the University of Pittsburgh's
student union; and Timber Court, which is located on the
North Shore and houses the offices of WTW
themselves, inter alia.) The general contractor was
Bridges and Company, also located on Pittsburgh's
North Side. Work on UTDC I was completed and the first
tenant moved in, in July of 1984.

Although buildings like this are all the rage now,
RIDC is anything but a knock-off, me-too company. RIDC
was originally formed in 1955, the result of a report by the
Pennsylvania Economy League in November, 1954.
That report said, "lndustrial development activity is
steadily becoming more competitive and complex,
requiring a highly organized and coordinated approach
by both individual communities and by regions." RIDC
was reorganized in 1962, to become a development
company with a Development Fund for long-term and
equity capital. Robert H. Ryan, who was director of RIDC
from 1964 to 1967, was a strong advocate of the need
for industrial diversification and economic planning. Yes,
even then, a score of years ago, there were those who
pointed out that Pittsburgh should not merely depend

on heavy industry for its economic base, but should also
include in the mix light manufacturing, as well as research
and development. Thankfully, however, they did not call
it "high technology."

Some view basic industry and "high technology"
as two opposing, dualistic forces —— a sort of Ahriman
versus Ormuz. And some think basic industry should be
likened to Prometheus vanquished, as he lay strapped
to the mountainside, his viscera pecked out by birds.
The actual situation is quite different, though. As
Brestensky puts it, "'High technology’ helps basic
industry. Basic industry would come to a standstill if high
technology weren't researching ways to do things better,
or in a more competitive manner. But the Pittsburgh
economy isn't going to turn its back on either one of
them. There is no ‘good guy’ or ‘bad guy’. We're all in this
together." In other words, there is a greater bridge that
connects the newer industries with the older ones than
any chasm which may separate them.

Of the personnel who work at UTDC I, about thirty
per cent are affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh
and about thirty per cent with Carnegie Mellon University,
although there is some overlap between those two

numbers.

Of the companies, most are involved in software
development. And though, as a group, they all modify
existing, off-the-shelf software, each has its own focus.
But there are other kinds of companies, too. One
provides PC training, and engages in the repair of PCs.
There are also companies that are support groups. The
Enterprise Corporation provides advice, in the form of
both market and feasibility studies. The Western
Pennsylvania Advanced Technology Center -- which is
sponsored by the Ben Franklin Partnership, under the
Pennsylvania Department of Commerce —- provides
funding for eligible projects. The Pittsburgh High
Technology Council is a trade association of small as well
as large "high technology" companies, which promotes
their interaction and sponsors seminars and workshops
to help entrepreneurs.

If you are looking for more than an allegorical link
between newer and older companies in Pittsburgh,
there is another UTDC I tenant: the Steel Structures
Painting Council. SSPC sponsors research into
corrosion, corrosion protection, paints, and painting
methods for structural steel. It also oversees the writing

If the competition for renting space in UTDC I
seems intense, it is. "There is such a demand for this
space," Brestensky told us. "So, the new company really
has to plan ahead, to project realistically their needs for
space am employment." And planning well does,
indeed, reap well. Of the 21 original tenants, UTDC I still
claims 20. Brestensky points with pride to something
else: " One of our first tenants," she informed Skyscraper
Engineer, "started out with 10 employees; now, they're
up to 20 employees."

Asked whether Henry Street were becoming a
Route 28 in microcosm -- what with UTDC I, the Software
Engineering Institute (under construction, across the
street), Buchanan-lngersol|'s software law division (up
the street), and Reed, Smith, Shaw, and McClay's
software law offices (in the same building -as B-I, but
fronting on Filmore Street)-- Brestensky was reserved.
The SE! was sited where it is, because the land was

available and the location was judged convenient to CMU
and Pitt. And, as far as the law firms‘ presence,
"Buchanan-Ingersoll and Reed, Smith came here
because we were here. It wasn't until '84 that law and
accounting firms began to specialize in ‘high
technology'."

We asked Brestensky if she thought any David
Packards or Steven Jobses would come from UTDC I.
"lt's probably going to be 15 years before we see any
effect," she replied. "There may be a David Packard in
the next room; but we won't know for a long time."
Nevertheless, she said, ''I gn see a very, very successful
company emerging from here someday. Pitt and CMU
are very welI—known institutions. If we can just get the
people with the ideas to keep them here."

UTDC I is certainly a boon to this area. It augurs
great consequences for the Pittsburgh region. As
Brestensky enthusiastically put it, "|t's much more far-
reaching than what appears here. There are poeple who
will turn this area around —- by cutting costs and doing
things more efficiently -- so it will be something as great
as it was in the past."

Liquids in the Interstellar Medium

continued from page 4

Europa This Jovian moon may host liquid water but
hides it under a frozen crustal surface. Like lo, Europa
should also experience interior tidal heating Clue to an
eccentric orbit (e = 0.003) around Jupiter. Earth—based
telescopic observations have shown that Europa's
surface is composed primarily of water ice mixed with
varying amounts of impurities. Compared to Jupiter's
other heavily cratered satellites, Europa's surface is
highly smooth and unscathed with the exception of
numerous faults running across the moon, like a crystal
ball with cracks. Such smoothness suggests some sort
of surface process that has eroded or covered Europa's
craters. One solution is a theory that a sea of water and
ice slush remains buried under an outer shell of ice in
Europa's interior, kept fluid by tidal heating and by
radiated heat from the core. Water requires temperatures
greater than 273 K to remain in the liquid phase and
pressures as low as 4.59 torr. Through cracks in the
moon's surface, water and/or slush is probably seeping
to the surface and flowing over craters and other
landmarks before freezing solid due to the frigid
temperatures of space.

Jupiter Jupiter itself may hide a rare form of fluid:
liquid metalic hydrogen. The weight of the overlying
layers of Jupiter's atmosphere (composed primarily of H2,
He, CH4 and NH3 in that order) would produce a zone
deep in the planet's lower atmosphere where the
atmospheric pressure is three million times that of the
earth's——great enough to strip electrons off hydrogen
atoms creating a dark sloshing sea of metallic hydrogen.
Temperatures in this atmospheric zone have been
calculated to be between 200-400 K. Liquid metallic
hydrogen has never been created in the laboratory due
to the tremendous amount of pressure required, but if it
could, the fluid might be used as a superconductor at
moderate temperatures and spearhead a revolution in
electronics. Scientists also suspect that currents flowing
through Jupiter's liquid metal interior may be the cause
forthe planet's tremendous magnetic field.

Titan Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has a
predominantly nitrogen atmosphere denser than the
Earth's at a surface pressure of 1.5 bar and a temperature
of 94 K, conditions permitting a liquid phase for some
organic compounds. Methane resides on Titan in
unknown amounts, leading to the possibility of brownish
tarry lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons (primarily

16

 

or satellites with a magnetic field would also suggest that
their interiors are partially liquid. Mars and Venus, for
example, assuming that their cores are also
predominantly iron, are also expected to have molten
iron outer cores since both planets have magnetic fields.
Mercury, on the other hand, does not have a magnetic
field, and scientists assume that the planet is too small
for interior temperatures to substantially melt its outer
iron core.

Interstellar Clouds Until the mid-1960s scientists
believed that regions between the stars were too hostile
for the existence of appreciable quantities of molecules.
This assumption was shaken in 1968-69 when
observations of such fragile molecules such as NH3, H2
CO2 and H2O were made in interstellar clouds,
suggesting that in certain regions of space almost all
available gaseous atoms will combine into molecules.

Preliminary calculations on the possibility of liquids in
interstellar clouds composed of these molecules have
led me to conclude it nearly impossible. Temperatures
in dense molecular clouds, the best class candidate for
interior pressures permitting a liquid to exist in‘ the
category of interstellar clouds, are 5-10 K, with some
isolated areas as high as 20 K due to interstellar
ultraviolet heating. But this is still too cold to induce
most molecules into a liquid phase from the gaseous
phase. Molecular clouds are primarily composed of H2
and some He, with one molecule of H2O for every 1
molecules of H2, a relatively high concentration for
astrochemists, but not nearly enough for liquid water to
precipitate (which requires at least 4.59 torr at
temperatures greaterthan 273 K.)

Other molecules found in dense molecular clouds are
C, O, N, Si and all of their isotopes except for Si's. Many
polyatomic organic molecules have also been observed
with up to seven atoms in a compound: HCN, HCOOH,
CH2NH, CH3OH, CH3CN, HCONH , CH3CHO and
CH2CH2. Some spectral lines from molecular cloud
observations have not yet been identified and may also
be produced by transient molecules. No satisfactory
theory has yet been fon/varded to explain how complex
organic molecules can form under conditions remote
from those of terrestrial chemistry (the pressures are
lowerthan 10 atm at 50 K or less.) Such low pressures,
as well as the relative scarcity of such molecules in
molecular clouds, strongly suggest that organic
molecule liquid "soups" ready to drown a starship in
space are most unlikely.

Other areas that host a remote chance of harboring

molecules in the liquid phase are 1) the gaseous areas
around protostars, where internal pressures may be
enough to form liquid metallic hydrogen; 2) accretion
disks around massive black holes (like the one at the
center of our galaxy,) where the gravitational fields might
increase the pressure and temperatures of inner orbiting
gas swirls to form liquid metallic hydrogen; 3) compact Hll
regions, the areas around hot stars in dense clouds of
gas and dust, where at the bow shock circumference
temperatures (100-1000 K) and pressures may be able
to briefly form organic molecule groupings into liquid
rivers in space, given large enough concentrations of
organic molecules in the area; and 4) in the bow shock
wave of igniting protostars in stellar nurseries or of
novaeing and supernovaeing red giants.

Llquids in interstellar clouds might be detected by

 

finding large concentrations of potential liquid elements
by making spectrographic observations of liquid phase
host areas, by discovering magnetic fields suggesting
fluid dynamics of metallic liquids, or by observing slight
aperiodic redshift fluctuations in the overall redshift of
interstellar clouds or accretion disks. Turbulent liquids in
space might also be observed in the ultraviolet and visual
wavelengths, although I strongly doubt it ever will.

During my research into the possibility of finding
liquids in the interstellar medium, I did not find any
references directly discussing the topic of liquids in the
interstellar medium, especially in interstellar clouds. This
suggests that theoretical and observational studies of
greater depth than my studies may yield new insight into
the nature of liquids and the cosmos, perhaps even
revealing new areas under which liquids may find the
right conditions to exist.

Footnotes

1 One atmosphere (atm) is the normal atmospheric
pressure on earth at sea level.

2 Evaporation rate is proportional to how excited
the liquid's molecules are. If you give a liquid extra
energy (such as heat from a gas stove to a pot of
water) the molecules will move with greater velocity
(due to more kinetic energy, as the equation
E=1/2mv2 suggests) and thus have a greater
chance of breaking from restraining van der Waals
forces.

1) Assuming an eight hour day, Peter will normally make
$19.20. In that same day, he can pick 40 pecks. Thus it
would seem that Paul should pay him 19.20/40, or
$O.48.peck. But if Peter is such a shrewd business man,
he wouldn't accept that since technically his co—workers
are picking 32 pecks per day for the same wage, and
thus are paid $0.60/peck. Thus, the question is moot.

Another Year...
Another Editor

by Sanjiv Gupta

Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds; we don't
routinely finish off our editors after only a year of duty.
Being the editor of Skyscraper Engineer (or any
magazine, for that matter) is a tough job, so it's not
surprising if someone decides that one year is enough.
Robin Depto, our editor last year, did a fine job for
Skyscraper and gained valuable experience in the
process. Although not officially editor this year, he is still
heavily involved with Skyscraper.

For 1986-87, Skyscraper is going to try several
new things. First, you may have noticed on the staff
page that we have more than one editor. We've decided
to split the responsibility between two new positions,
managing editor and production editor. The managing
editor, Maurice Rickard, is not an engineer. This brings
up our second change for this year: we would like to
expand our readership beyond the School of
Engineering, because, despite our name, we are not a
boring technical journal. Skyscraper is simply an
undergraduate magazine that happens to be published
by the School of Engineering. We've had articles about
many different subjects, a number of them non-
technical. To expand our readership, we have recruited
several CAS students into our staff. We hope their input
will help us to broaden the appeal of the magazine,
which, as far as we know, is the 9_n_ly undergraduate
magazine on campus. If an English major wants to get a
story published in a campus magazine, he or she has to
come to us!

Our most important change for this year involves,
much like everything else these days, computers. In
previous years, articles were sent to the Pitt News to be
typeset. For approximately $300 an issue, we would get
back long narrow strips of glossy paper (called "ga|leys")
with all of the typeset textual material for that issue.
Before being sent to the printer, the galleys would have
to be cut apart and pasted into position on layout pages
exactly as they were to appear in the final product. The
process was somewhat boring, tedious, and easy to
mess up. From now on, we will be doing everything on a

20

microcomputer. Articles will be written on a word
processor and then run through a spelling checker
program to eliminate "typo's." The articles will then be
transferred directly to a "desktop publishing" program,
which will be used to lay out the pages of the magazine,
leaving spaces for artwork and photographs. The pages
will be printed out on a laser printer, giving us typeset-
quality output at a fraction of the cost and with far less
effort. After artwork and photos are pasted down the old
way, the laser printer—produced pages are sent directly to
the printing company. Typesetting errors (which
accounted for the vast majority of spelling errors in past

   

 

issues) will no longer occur, because spelling-checked Novenoaa ma
(pardon the adjective) articles are transferred directly to ¢5_o¢
the pages. As a result, we save $1200 a year, and put
out a higher quality product. In case you care, the
computer is an Apple Macintosh, and the software is
Aldus Pagemaker.

Despite all of these wonderful changes, WE

Art to Part

At tomorrow's GE, young engineers
like Dean Robinson will produce
designs almost as fast as they can
think. Thanks to newly developed GE
software that transforms design data
directly into a tool path to produce
the part right from an engineer's
workstation.

The new technology called "art-to-
part CAD/ CA M, "goes far beyond
solid modeling. First, realistic images
are generated and displayed on the

terminal,‘ then tested, stressed, and
refined. Designs can be rotated, cross-
sectioned, or peeled away in layers.
But that's just the beginning.

When the design is ready for
production, the computer generates
instructions directly into the machine
that cuts the mold. No blueprints.

No models. Thought becomes reality

What puts GE so far ahead in the
development of art-to-part CAD/
CAM? Perhaps it’s because we're our
own best customer We don't just
design the software. We don't just
build the hardware. We use these
systems in most of our businesses.
So we’re constantly getting feedback

Liquids in the Interstellar Medium

by Matthew B. Tolbert

(Tolbert is an honors Physics and Astronomy major,
President of the Society of Physics Students, and an
avid skateboarder ("/ couldn 't afford a BM W this year. "))

The physical laws governing matter seal the fate of
every ice cream cone not quickly eaten on a hot summer
afternoon. it you provide a solid with enough heat
energy, but not too much heat, under the right
atmospheric pressure conditions, the so|id's molecules
(although still loosely bonded together) will possess
enough thermal energy to start tumbling past one
anotherinfluidform.

The solid has changed to a liquid.

Beyond the earth's atmosphere, however, where
pressures have been found between 1048 to 1O'27
am‘, most solids will undergo sublimination, the direct
transition of a solid to a gas while skipping the liquid
phase. For example, a dish of your favorite flavor of ice
cream released in the vacuum of space will vaporize into
carbon molecules without leaving a puddle of sauce at
the dish's bottom, and the ancient dust-mixed ice on the
surface of Ha|ley's comet will dissipate as it did this past

year into a tail of heavy ion water particles.

This article considers areas of the interstellar medium-—
an area normally hostile to the liquid phase—-where liquids
might and have been discovered to exist.

Let us first cover some brief history and facts
concerning liquids. All matter is classified as being either
a solid or a fluid. Liquids, plasmas and gasses are all fluids
due to their fluid motion (such as homogeniously filling
out the inside of a glass tube on a space station in free
fall.) This ability to flow is due to the interaction of
molecules have some freedom of individual movement.
Each molecule in a liquid possesses enough kinetic
energy to break a solid's imprisoning crystalline structure,
yet not enough kinetic energy to break the weak bonds
holding the particles together. A liquid's molecules are
also much closer together than a gas‘, so one molecule's
mean free path between collisions is impeded by the
overcrowding of its brethren molecules preventing it
from flying off to regions beyond the liquid. Some
molecules do escape at at |iquid's surface (a process
known as "evaporation") but not at a very rapid rate.2

The molecules’ limited freedom in the fluid phase
gives liquids properties such as definite volume and

surface tension, the inward pull between a liquid's
molecules that gives liquids curved surfaces in narrow
containers (like the meniscus in a test tube) due to weak
forces, normally referred to as van der Waals forces,
between each molecule. It is the van der Waals forces,
of which there are two, that condense a liquid's
molecules. There are repulsive van der Waals forces due
to electron repulsion when molecules virtually overlap
their electron clouds3, and weak Coulomb attractions
resulting from dipole attractions due to imbalances in
electron distributions in electron distributions in
molecules. When two molecules are in close proximity to
one another, their positive nuclei will try to put as much
distance between each other as possible. The same
happens with each atom's negative electrons. This
induces a dipole in both molecules, where the positive
end of one dipole attracts the negative end of the other.
Such attractions can only occur at very small distances
where repulsive and attractive van der Waals forces
balance out (3 A‘ for He pairs, for example,)4 so the
liquid phase would be difficult to find in such areas as
interstellar clouds, where distances between molecules
on the atomic scale are relatively immense. The ratio, for
example, of molecule separation distance in a dense
molecular cloud compared to the distance required for
dipole attraction can be 105 to 1.

Besides Isaac Newton's brief reflections in his Principia
Mathematica in the late 1600s about forces in fluids,
John Dalton was the first scientist to provide important
insight about the liquid state of matter that paved the way
for the discovery of van der Waals forces. Suspecting
from experimental results from liquid studies that
intermolecular forces existed in matter, Dalton reported
in1807:

"The constitution of a liquid, such as water, must then
be conceived to be that of an aggregate of particles,
exercising in a most powerful manner the forces of
attraction and repulsion, but nearly in an equal degree."5

Later work by Charles Cagniard de la Tour in 1822-23
uncovered the gas—liquid critical point of substances, the
amount of heat necessary to provide a substance‘s
molecules with enough kinetic energy to break the van
der Waals forces imprisoning them. While attempting to
vaporize various liquids in a sealed tube, Tour
discovered that a liquid could be completely vaporized at
certain temperatures. His work was later confirmed in
1860 by Mendeleev, who was studying the surface
tensions of liquids. Mendeleev called the gas—liquid
point the "absolute boiling point."

The English scientist Michael Faraday, as well as Sir
Humphrey Davy, followed in the footsteps of Tour's
research and began determining the temperatures and
pressures at which several gases could be liquified, a
study that Faraday undertook in the early 1840s as a
relieving break from his work on electricity and electrolyte
solutions. He successfully liquified a number of gases
but was unsuccessful with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, methane and nitric oxide--the

"permanant gases" as they became known in later years.
The next decade was spent by researchers attempting to
liquify the permanent gases at various temperatures and
pressures up to 3000 atm.

In 1850 Pierre Eugene Marcelin Berthelot successfully
demonstrated by experiment the presence of a force
between a liquid's molecules hypothesized by Newton
and Dalton. Berthelot sealed a liquid in a glass tube and
heated the system until the liquid expanded to
completely fill the tube. He then cooled the tube,
producing pressures up to 50 atm before the liquid finally
collapsed. This work provided van der Waals during his
1862-72 doctoral work with evidence to incorporate the
concept of cohesive force into his equation of state:

p=__RT__a

V—b V2

presented in his PhD thesis. a is the characteristic
parameter of the attractive forces among a f|uid's
molecules, b the molecular volume. The formula was
derived to fit experimental data, including Berthelot's,
based on the ideal gas law fon/varded by Charles, Boyle
and Gay Lussac (PV=nRT.) van de Waals's formula not
only took into account deviations in the ideal gas law but
predicted gas—liquid equilibrium and the existence of a
critical point as well. His work laid the foundations of fluid
properties for other scientists, like Gibbs, Boltzmann and
Dewar, to build upon in the following decades.

So what exactly are the conditions necessary for
liquids to exist in space? Heat and pressure are the two
primary criteria. A graph of pressure versus temperature,
called a phase diagram, gives us a visual idea of what a
substance's phase will be in various temperature and
pressure environments. The graph will normally consist
of three branching lines representing the boundaries
between melting, boiling and subliming points. These

boundaries divide the three major phases of a substance
(plasma phase is absent.) The point where these three
lines intercept is called the triple point. At this particular
pressure and temperature a solid, liquid or gas phase
could exist. If the pressure and the temperature is any
lowerthan the triple point, a solid would sublimate.

The interstellar medium is primarily a cold vacuum.
Gases and plasmas permeate most of space, except in
those places where molecules’ gravitational attraction
towards each other pull clouds of gas and dust into
compact regions that, depending on the aggregate's
mass, will ignite by fusion reaction into a star (returning
the elements into the plasma phase) or will coalesce into
a planet or other rocky substance like our solar system's
comets and asteroids.

Planets and large moons, especially those with
atmospheres, are the most likely places to find liquids.
Stars are highly unlikely havens for liquids since their
temperatures are far too hot in their cores and on their
surfaces for the phase to exist. Cold interstellar clouds
may harbor liquids if their interior pressures and
temperatures are high enough, but such levels are
extremely rare, except perhaps during the ignition of a
protostar.

So we are looking for locations in the interstellar
medium besides the Earth with the right pressures and
temperatures where universally commonplace
sublimation is replaced with the liquid phase. The
following are a list of some of the candidates to be
considered.5

VENUS One of the first extraterrestrial locations
suspected of sheltering a liquid was Venus. When
astronomers in the early nineteenth century began
pointing their telescopes at the "Earth's Twin Planet,"
they observed a world enveloped in a dense
atmosphere that was later determined in 1932 to consist
primarily of CO2_ Early imaginative theories suggested
that this CO2 atmosphere was the result of vast tropical
forests on Venus's surface, implying the presence of
water.

Later radio observations of Venus's surface
temperature, however, disproved this fanciful theory;
living organizisms cannot live in the 700° K daytime, 230
K night time temperatures. The Pioneer probes to
Venus later confirmed that the planet's atmosphere was
96% CO2, 3.4% nitrogen, and .1-.5% water vapor.
Apparently the atmosphere of Venus, like that of the
Earth's, originated by outgassing from the planet's crust.
The difference is that the major outgass on Earth was
water, which presently covers two-thirds of its surface.
Any Venerian water, it is now hypothesized, long ago
circulated to the top of Venus's atmosphere, where solar
ultraviolet radiation decomposed it into hydrogen, which
would easily escape into space, and oxygen, chemically
active enough to form compounds with other elements
in the atmosphere.

In Venus's upper atmosphere temperatures range
from 300 to 500 K and form two distinct cloud layers 12
km thick. Here we do find a liquid phase substance:
sulfur. In the upper cloud layer liquid where sulfuric acid

rain probably falls. Below floats a dark opaque cloud layer
4 or 5 km thick where liquid sulfur probably also
precipitates. We can see that this liquid behavior of
sulfur corresponds with its phase diagram, whose liquid
phase is generally a combination of atmospheric
pressures and temperatures greater than 0.04 torr and
393 K.
lo The Voyager I and II spacecraft travelling through
the Jovian system discovered an unexpected and
exciting surface on Io. Like most other planetary moons,
lo was expected to be pockmarked with craters to to
ancient collisions with debris left over from the formation
of the solar system, much like the cratered surface of our
own moon. Instead, no impact craters were to be found
on Io. Some process on lo's surface, a surface which
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory described as a
colorful pizza with every topping imaginable on it, had
erased or filled in its craters. Landmarks that appeared to
be volcanoes could not be visually confirmed.
it was Linda Morabito, a member of Voyager's
Navigation Team, who finally solved lo's smooth surface
problem. While enhancing an image of lo to detect stars
behind the moon, she discovered a bright plume super-
imposed on the darkness of space surrounding lo that
seemed to originate from one of lo's suspected
volcanoes. Scientists later confirmed that Linda had
stumbled across the first known active volcano beyond
the Earth's surface. Eight other volcanoes were soon to
follow, all observed erupting plumes of sulfur into space.
lo's volcanoes had been predicted earlier by Stanton
Peale and his co—workers on the Voyager team. The
group had calculated that the interior of lo, predominantly
sulfur, should have melted because of the tremendous
tidal forces exerted on this moon by Jupiter's enormous
gravitational field. The great magnitude of the
gravitational field is due to highly eccentric orbit of lo
(e=0.004). Apparently molten sulfur heated in the
moon's interior due to this tidal heating was seeping, like
Mt. St. Helen's magma, upwards to lo's surface via its
volcanoes. Once outside, the molten sulfur flows down
the volcano's slopes, still in liquid form due to a sufficient
enough atmospheric pressure exerted by a thin
atmosphere enveloping lo (sulfur at the proper
corresponding temperatures can exist in liquid form at
pressures as low as 0.007 torr.) Discovered by Voyager,
lo's atmosphere is primarily sulfur dioxide created by
material violently ejected by volcanic eruptions.

The surface of lo itself is a world of jagged sulfur rivers
streaming from black volcanic caldera, covered with
yellows, oranges and reds. These colors are due to
sulfur being heated beyond its melting point in lo's
interior. Solid sulfur melts at 1 atm at 115 C, deepening
in color from yellow at relatively low temperatures to
orange to red and finally to black at high temperatures.
When cooled quickly, sulfur solidifies and retains its
characteristic temperature color. This is why lo's volcanic
peaks are black and red (where the magma is still hot)
while the primarily inactive and cooler sulfur surface is a
pumpkin orange mixed with splashes of yellow-white.

Freshman Statistics

This year's freshman engineering class has 19%
female students and 10% minority students. These
percentages are up slightly from last year. There were
five engineering students who received Chancellor's
scholarships this year. The Fessenden—Trott
scholarships which are annually awarded to two
freshmen, increased to $6000/yearthis year.

School of Engineering Receives
New Dean

Charles A. Sorber became the dean of the School
of Engineering on July 1, 1986. As dean, he has many
plans for the school. A main goal is to achieve
excellence in engineering education. Sorber sees three
ways of achieving that goal — by having "outstanding
faculty, outstanding facilities and equipment  and most
importantly, highly motivated students."

As part of cultivating motivation, Sorber wants to
be visible to the student body. He has organized
regular meetings with student leaders. Currently the

San Antonio he was Director of the Center for Applied
Research and Technology and the assistant dean of the
College of Sciences and Mathematics. He then took his
previous position at the University of Texas in Austin,
where he held the prestigious title of "LB. ‘Preach’
Meaders Professor in Engineering."

New Post Created

Mr. Edward P. Travers holds the new School of
Engineering position of Director of Development and
Alumni Affairs. As Director of Development, he seeks to
raise funds and resources from corporations. Some
projects include endowed positions, corporate gifts,
scholarship programs, and equipment acquisitions. He
plays a part in representing the School of Engineering
when the University considers capital expenditures. As
Director of Engineering Alumni Affairs, he co—ordinates
alumni activities and assists the Engineering Alumni
Association with its programs and co—ordinates the
Annual Giving Fund program.

Travers comes to the University from the United
Way of Allegheny County. He has a B.A. in Political

includes Engineering
Student Cabinet,
NSBE and SWE
officers, presidents of
the honor societies,
student presidents of
each department and

Sorber encourages each student to tell these
leaders any ideas or problems he or she may have, and
to participate in student groups. Communication is the
first step toward implementing ideas and remedying
problems.

Sorber comes to Pitt from the University of Texas
where he was Associate Dean of Academic Affairs. He
received his Bachelor and Master of Science at Penn
State in Sanitary Engineering. He earned his Ph.D. at
the University of Texas. He worked for fourteen years
with the U.S. Army, where he rose to the position of

AN ANALYSIS OF

NUCLE SAFETY

by Mark Belz

At 1:23 am on April 26, 1986, a major nuclear
accident occurred at the Chernobyl plant in the U.S.S.R.
This calamity has already had major repercussions in the
US nuclear industry. is the concern justified? Are
nuclear power plants a safe alternative to other forms of
energy, such as fossil fuels and hydroelectric power?

First, the factors which caused the accident must
be considered. The problem occurred during a low-
power experiment in which the supply of steam from the
reactor was halted in order to determine whether the
mechanical inertia of the turbine would provide electricity
to the plant itself. A combination of interrelated design
weaknesses and human factors were involved, including
thefollowing:

o Faulty test procedures.

0 Operator violations of certain parts of the test
procedures.

0 A lost sense of vigilance towards safety.

0 Simplicity with which Chernobyl's safety and
protection systems could be overridden.

0 Slow control-rod insertion rate.

0 Positive void coefficient (A design feature
whereby the formation of steam bubbles in the reactor
can lead to powersurges).**

In American nuclear power plants engineered
safety features are employed to prevent the release of
radiation ‘and radioactive materials. These include the

Emergency Core Cooling Systems, the Containment
Systems, Emergency Feedwater, Essential Service
Water System, Component Cooling Water System, and
the Emergency Diesel Generators. These features are
utilized only during emergency.

The Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS)
perform two functions. The primary function is to prevent
fuel rod damage in the event of a loss of coolant . The
secondary function is to provide shutdown capability
through the chemical injection of boric acid (thereby
stopping the chain reaction).

The Containment Systems consist of several
features. The containment building itself is a reinforced
concrete structure designed to physically shield the
reactor contents. The containment isolation system
separates the various fluid systems passing through the
containment walls, to prevent the release of radioactivity
into the environment. The containment spray system
limits the pressure in the containment atmosphere to
below design pressure, and removes enough iodine
from the containment atmosphere to limit the off-site and
site boundary doses to required safety levels. The
containment cooling system removes heat from the
containment building during non-emergency and
emergency conditions. The hydrogen gas control
system aids in the removal of flammable hydrogen gas
created following an accident.

The Essential Service Water System automatically
provides cooling water to components that require
