Years Since Baccalaureate

Now let us look more closely at the shifts in
engineering salaries. We know that the aver-
age last year was something over $11,000, and
when we look at the chart of salaries (above,
left), we see where the increases have oc-
curred during this past eleven years. The first
Manpower Commission survey, back in 1953,
showed that the median engineering salary
was $6500 and that the salary of the beginning
engineer was $4000. What has happened to
that young engineer of 1953? In the 1964 sur-
vey, we see that he is now earning about $11,-
700, for on the 1964 curve he shows up as an
engineer with 11 years since baccalaureate. I
was curious to know certain other things about
salary shifts. For example, have starting sal-
aries, as is commonly assumed, actually in-
creased more rapidly than salaries for experi-
enced engineers? The bar chart provides an
answer, which is a qualiﬁed “yes.” The start-
ing engineer of 1964 received a salary that
was 81% higher than his counterpart in 1953:

the chart above left shows this as about $7500
for the 1964 bachelor graduate. But note an-
other thing, as shown in the bar chart: The
largest increases since 1953 have occurred
among engineers with eight and ten years’ ex-
perience. (This means that in 1964, -the engi-
neer with eight years experience was earning
85.5% more than the engineer who, in 1953,
had eight years’ experience. In other words, I
am not comparing one man’s salary today with
his salary of eight years ago. If you wish to do
that, go back to the ﬁrst chart.) Another thing
I was curious about: How has the older engi-
neer done over these past eleven years? In the
chart just above, showing typical increases, I
show what has happened to four men. Engi-
neer A, who graduated in 1953, earned 182%
more in 1964 than in his ﬁrst year of work.
But Engineer D, an older man, with 25 years
experience in 1953, has not enjoyed comparable
increases during these past eleven years : from
$8500 to $14,000 in 1964——a 66% increase.

—-I Teaching—total income

I I I Teaching—basic salary

Many qualiﬁed professionals never consider
a teaching career because teaching salaries are
thought to be too low. Is this true for teachers
of engineering? The chart at top left indicates
the belief is indeed valid, at least among young
members of engineering faculties. And it is
valid when we compare industrial salaries in
engineering with teaching salaries alone,
whether for the young engineers or for those
with long experience. But in terms of total in-
come, the engineering teacher's salary has
been improving markedly in recent years——be-
cause of consulting, summer work, and so on.
In 1962, for example, such additional income
for a professor in a private institution was
$4900, on top of his basic teaching salary of
$12,700. The charts at the top of the page show
how the median total professional income for
engineering teachers has caught up with in-
dustrial salaries. The charts also show that
older teachers have closed the gap more rapidly
than younger teachers——and a look at the
teaching salary chart, at left, helps explain
why. Between 1960 and 1962, teaching salary
increases favored the higher ranking faculty
people—deans’ salaries, along with those of de-
partment heads, full professors, and associate
professors, increased 12 to 14% during those
years, while the lower-ranks did less well.

Until 1964, federal engineering salaries had
been much lower than those in industry— but
no longer, though state levels still lag.

The number of bachelor engineers grad-

signiﬁcantly. In fact, if current trends con-
tinue, the number will increase by only 41%
during the next ten years, while masters grad-
uates and engineering doctorates will increase
by 80% and 200% respectively. The charts
here are intended to show the value of ad-

engineers whose highest degree is the bac-
calaureate are in supervisory positions, while
40% of industry’s master-degree engineers
and 45% of its doctorate engineers are super-
visors. In government, the percentages are
somewhat lower, but advanced-degree people
still tend to lead: 22% of the bachelor engi-
neers in government are in supervision,
against 26% of the masters and 35% of the
doctors. Also signiﬁcant is the apparent fact
that the earning power of doctorate and mas-
ter engineers tends to peak later in life than
that of the bachelor engineer. Perhaps this
says something regarding the problem of
engineering obsolescence.

As we compare supervisory and nonsuper-
visory salaries, we see a substantial gap be-
tween them. Perhaps this is not an unex-
pected occurrence, but it does illustrate the
limitations of the “dual-ladder” concept,
which holds that engineers need not move
into positions of supervision in order to en-
joy substantial advances in salary.

What about the future of engineering sal-
aries? Let us begin with some fairly safe as-
sumptions: that engineering will continue to
have an important role in civilian and military
affairs, that engineering education will con-
tinue to receive strong federal support, and
that the number of engineering-school grad-
uates will not increase substantially—at least
during the next ﬁve years. (We will graduate
more MS and PhD engineers, but the number
of bachelors cannot rise, because freshman en-
rollments have remained stubbornly constant.)
It appears that the number of engineering
graduates over the next ten years will not av-
erage much more than 37,000 per year. These
factors should have a decided upward inﬂuence
on engineers’ salaries. But . . .

Several other developments will serve as reg-
ulating inﬂuences. Industry has lived through
several periods of engineer shortage and from
these experiences it has learned how to use en-
gineers more eﬂiciently. Further, industry may
be learning of the futility of intensive salary
competition. Certainly many ﬁrms have
learned of this; their tactic, instead of bid-
ding higher and higher, is to use this money in
more constructive ways, such as in support of
“fringe beneﬁts,” e.g., offering their engineers
the opportunity to continue their education
toward advanced degrees, at company expense.
Such expressions as “pirating” and “body-
snatching” are heard less frequently these
days than in the mid-ﬁfties, in part because
fewer employers are resorting to such tactics,
deeming them unethical, but in larger measure
because such tactics have turned out to be
self-defeating.

Another factor which is moderating the
“runaway” increase in salary levels, particu-
larly with new engineering graduates, is the
availability of information on starting offers.
The College Placement Council’s Salary Sur-
vey has been most inﬂuential in this regard.
Our own studies, in Engineers Joint Council,
provide evidence which bears out this fact:
Between 1953 and 1958, starting salaries in
engineering rose at about 8% per year. Since
1960, starting salaries have risen by only 4%
per year. A similar slowing-down has oc-
curred at the ten—year-experience level.

Barring another Korean War or another
Sputnik I, the factors that will affect engineer-
ing during the years ahead will be those relat-
ing to our transition into a more automated
and mechanized economy. These will cause en-
gineering salary scales to rise, though more
moderately than during the frantic days of the
early and mid-ﬁfties. But I forsee no situation
which will depress" the demand. It appears that
the nation will continue to place a high pri-
ority on the services of engineers. Hence, engi-
neering salary scales will at least continue to
move up at a moderate rate.

A New Microscope for Microelectronics Research

I. M. Mackintosh, ]:'lliott—Automation, Ltd., Borelzam Wood, England.*

]. W. Thornhill, Manager, Information Devices Department,
Westinghouse Research Laboratories, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The scanning electron microscope produces
a composite View of physical topography and
surface potential.

The period at the end of this sentence is less than a
thousandth of a square inch in area, but it will cover a
considerable portion of a microelectronic circuit. With
the aid of a new scanning electron microscope, scientists
at the Westinghouse research laboratories are mapping,
in the ﬁnest detail, areas no larger than this on the surfaces
of microelectronic devices. The microscope’s resolution
and depth of focus, which provide clarity and detail to the
pictures it produces, are better than can be achieved with
the ﬁnest optical microscopes.

Of particular importance in microelectronic applica-
tions, the scanning electron microscope can also provide
basic information on the electrical performance of the
electronic devices under study. The combined structural
and electrical detail in scanning electron beam photo-
graphs have provided information about complex device
structures that could not be obtained with standard
visual inspection techniques. Furthermore, the instrument
offers a new technique for fabricating very minute devices
believed capable of extremely high-frequency performance.

Knoll in Germany, and later, scientists at Cambridge
University in England have worked on the scanning elec-
tron microscope. The device functions somewhat like a
closed-circuit TV system, with a camera inside the instru-
ment and a display tube outside for viewing. Pictures
can be displayed at magniﬁcations as high as 10 000
times, which is about ten times better than is possible
with conventional optical microscopes. In fact, this is the
highest magniﬁcation that can be achieved directly on
a solid specimen, without drastically thinning the specimen
for inspection in a transmission electron microscope or
using replication techniques.

Microscope Operation

A block diagram of the Westinghouse scanning elec-
tron microscope and its associated pattern generator is
shown in Fig. 1. The main body of the instrument is a
vacuum chamber, which houses the electron gun and mag-
netic lenses. The two magnetic lenses can focus the elec-

ment, Westinghouse Research Laboratories.

tron beam on the specimen with a spot size as small as
0.1 micron. Scanning coils, also located in the column,
move the beam in a TV-like raster, adjustable from 250
to 1000 lines, over the specimen. The scanning coils are
driven by the scanning generator. This same scanning
signal is fed to the cathode ray tubes, one of which is for
viewing and the other for pattern generation. Thus, the
CRT tubes are scanned in synchronism with the primary
beam scanning the specimen.

With a 0.1—micron spot and a 1000—line raster, an area
as small as 100 by 100 microns can be scanned. The area
scanned can be increased up to two millimeters square
with an accompanying increase in beam spot size.

An aperture is located between the electron gun and
the ﬁrst lens. Pulse-controlled coils near this aperture can
deﬂect the beam away from the aperture, thus turning
the beam on and off with respect to the specimen. This
arrangement prevents voltage transient effects in the
power supply and is more satisfactory than actually
turning the beam on and off during the various scanning
operations.

As the primary electron beam scans the specimen,
secondary electrons are emitted from the specimen sur-
face. These low—energy electrons are collected, ampliﬁed,
and fed as a control signal to modulate the brightness of
the viewing cathode ray tube.

In the amplifying process, the secondary electrons are
actually converted to pulses of light by a scintillating
crystal, and then back into electrical pulses by a photo-
multiplier tube. This two-step process provides the re-
quired noise—free ampliﬁcation.

Ignoring obvious factors such as mechanical Vibration
and imperfect power supplies, the resolution of the dis-
play image is determined by attainable beam current,
scattering effects in the specimen, and by the signal-to-
noise ratio of the secondary electron collection system.
Optimization of these factors has led to resolutions that
are limited mainly by the beam spot size to values of
about 0.1 micron, since anything smaller than roughly
0.6 times the spot diameter cannot be resolved.’

Scanning Electron Micrographs

As the primary electron beam scans the specimen sur-
face, the number of secondary electrons emitted is a
function of specimen material, surface topography, and
the angle of incidence of the primary beam. Thus, when
secondary emission from the specimen is optimized, the
image obtained on the cathode ray tube is easily inter-
preted in terms of the physical structure of the specimen
surface. A characteristic of scanning electron micrographs

is the enormous depth of ﬁeld, as can be seen in Fig. 4.

One of the unique features of the scanning electron
microscope is its ability to detect potential differences
between adjacent areas of the specimen surface. How this
effect is obtained can be explained brieﬂy as follows.
Upon leaving the specimen surface, the trajectories of the
slow secondary electrons are determined primarily by
the potentials existing between the specimen and ﬁnal
lens, and between the specimen and collector, as shown
schematically in Fig. 2. For this particular arrangement,
the variation in a typical secondary electron path is
shown forspecimen potentials ranging from +15 to -15
volts. Therefore, if the effective width of the collector
aperture is made small, the secondary electron current
collected becomes a sensitive function of specimen poten-
tial at the particular point of incidence of the scanning
electron beam.

With a suitable geometrical arrangement of the sample
surface, collector and other electrodes in the specimen
chamber, the scanning beam image produced will be a
superposition of the physical topography of the specimen
and the potential differences across its surface.

Under special conditions, potential differences as small
as 0.1 volt should be detectable with this technique. The
present instrument has detected potential differences
down to 0.2 volt with no difficulty.

In the Westinghouse instrument, the scanning beam
has an energy of from 5 to 50 kev, with current ranging
from 0.001 to 1 nanoampere (one nanoampere=10‘9
ampere). Thus, the beam is nondestructive (no lattice
damage occurs at these energies), but because the probe
current is so small, a scanning electron micrograph must
be recorded over a period of time to avoid shot—noise
effects. The scanning time can be varied from one-half
second to about four and a half hours, but the usual
scanning periods are one to three minutes.

A scanning electron micrograph of an NPN silicon
power transistor viewed at an angle of about 45 degrees
is shown in Fig. 3. The thermocompression bonded leads
are clearly in focus, thus demonstrating the great depth
of focus of the instrument. Considerable information
about the device can be obtained even without the appli-
cation of external biases (Fig. 3a); with biases applied
(Fig. 3b), an essentially complete picture of device per-
formance is obtained. The topography of, and voltage
variations in, the device surface show clearly, even though
much of the surface is covered with a passivating (insu-
lating) layer of silicon oxide. The improvement over an
optical micrograph (Fig. 3c) is clearly evident.

One of the interesting possibilities emerging from this
work is the possible correlation of device failures (in
actual use or in reliability studies) with marginal faults
detected by this instrument. For example, aberrations in
PN junctions that were previously undetectable by opti-
cal means but can be located with the scanning electron
microscope may have no adverse effect on the initial
device characteristics, but might lead to hot spots and
hence to early failure.

The scanning electron microscope also can be used in
the same way that optical devices are used for detecting
imperfections or contamination in processing. For ex-
ample, a common process used in the fabrication of in-

tegrated circuits is the etching of oxide diffusion windows;
any residual oxide left in the windows may drastically
affect the subsequent diffusion and yield an incorrect
impurity proﬁle. There are indications that the scanning
electron microscope can provide positive and rapid de-
tection of any residual oxide ﬁlm because the secondary
electron emission from a silicon dioxide surface is larger
than from bare silicon. At the same‘ time, the instrument
can be used to examine the oxide pattern by comparing
the window locations and boundaries with a standard
pattern.

Fabricating Semiconductor Devices

The scanning electron beam can produce another effect
that suggests an application to the fabrication of ex-
tremely minute devices. The electron beam can replace the
light normally used to expose the photosensitive emulsion
that is used to coat the surface of a semiconductor ma-
terial during some of the processing. The beam produces
chemical changes in the emulsion, which is then treated in
a standard fashion to produce an etch mask. Because of
the limited energy in the electron beam, back—scattering of
high-energy secondary electrons is limited, especially in
ultra-thin photosensitive ﬁlms. Thus, with 0.2 micron
photoresist ﬁlms now being perfected, edge sharpness of
the image should be about 0.14 micron.

By way of comparison, the resolution obtainable from
optical systems is limited by the diffraction of light to
about 0.5 micron; further losses of resolution arise from
the slight blurring of the edges of the pattern in the origi-
nal optical mask and from scattering effects in the photo-
sensitive emulsion, so that the practical edge sharpness
obtainable from optical exposure is about 1 or 2 microns.

In making an electron beam exposure, the pattern
generation system (Fig. 1) can be used to make the primary
beam scan the specimen in a predetermined pattern. An
optical mask of the desired shape is placed between the
screen of the pattern generation oscilloscope and a photo-
multiplier unit, the output of which is connected to the
pulse generator, which actuates the “off-on” coils in the
scanning electron microscope column. The system is ar-
ranged so that a transparent region in the mask leaves the
beam on, while an opaque region turns the beam off. An
image of the mask can thus be transposed in miniﬁed
form to the specimen, to cover an area determined by the
particular raster size used.

An example of the deﬁnition possible with this scan-
ning beam exposure of photoresist is shown in Fig. 5.
These aluminum lines on an oxidized silicon substrate are
about 1.0 micron wide with an edge sharpness of about
0.2 micron. They were made by exposing a photosensitive
etch resist ﬁlm of about 0.5 micron thickness with a scan-
ning electron beam of about 0.5 micron diameter, develop-
ing the resist layer, and then etching the aluminum. Thus,
it is evident that polymerization of a photosensitive etch
resist ﬁlm by high—resolution electron beam can provide a
signiﬁcant increase in edge sharpness over optical ex-
posures. The developrnent of thinner ﬁlms or of other
materials that undergo chemical change under electron
bombardment may increase the superiority of the elec-
tron beam method even further.

The one limitation of electron—beam ﬁlm polymeriza-
tion is the time consumed in making the exposure. Ex-
posure time is determined by the charge density required
for effective polymerization of the ﬁlm and the current
density available in the beam. For example, with present
techniques and photosensitive resists, a one square inch
slice would require an exposure time of about 60 hours.
This is obviously enormous in comparison with present
optical techniques, although in some cases the tremendous
increase in recording detail may compensate for the extra
time required. As the technology advances, improvements
in scanning techniques, electron optics, and photosensitive
materials could improve this situation.

The potential beneﬁts that could come from the useof
high-resolution electron—beam techniques can be demon-
strated for a typical device, the surface-controlled oxide
unipolar transistor (SCOUT) shown in Fig. 6. The theo-
retical frequency response of this relatively simple device
can be calculated, but it is difﬁcult to achieve because of
dimensional variations during manufacture. With optical
techniques, the channel length (L), a critical dimension,
is subject to variations of about i 1.7 microns. Thus, if
reproducibility of 10 percent in total channel length is a
realistic requirement for quantity production, optical
techniques cannot be used for channel lengths of less than
about 17 microns. However, with electron beam polymeri-
zation techniques, variation in total channel length should
be reduced to i0.35 micron, so that channel lengths
could be as low as 3.5 microns. Since frequency response
in this instance is approximately proportional to the
square of this dimensional ratio, frequency response with

a smaller device could be increased by a factor of about 25.

Another motive for reducing the size of solid—state
devices is the need for higher packing densities in micro-
electronic systems. Of course, other limitations, such as
power dissipation, may offset or prevent the beneﬁts of
reduced size. Considerable attention has been paid to the
packing density problem, and it has recently been sug-
gested by some that a linear dimension of about 10 microns
is the practical limit imposed on any device that must be
made in large numbers and at high yield. As the foregoing
discussions indicate, even this limit is not yet practical
with conventional optical techniques; however, it is well
within the reach of electron-beam techniques.

Conclusions

The experimental work with the scanning—beam elec-
tron microscope is still new, but the instrument has al-
ready demonstrated its capability for conventional micro-
scopic applications.

In studies carried out for the U. S. Air Force under
contract with the Electronic Technology Division, Aero-
nautical Systems Division, Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base, high-resolution scanning electron beams have de-
monstrated several effects applicable to solid-state device
technology. Additional interesting implications for future
solid-state device applications can be extrapolated from
present work. There have been enough encouraging results
to suggest that these new techniques are likely to become
important and that the scanning electron micro-
scope will become a valuable tool in solid—state
device technology.

Missiles, aerospace vehicles, and advanced aircraft will soon
be subjected to high-intensity sound that may lead to . . .

SONIC FM

BY ROY R. WHYMARK AND VERNER J. RAELSON

Only a few decades have passed
since the sound barrier was ﬁrst
broken by a manned aircraft. This
feat has become commonplace today
when we are in the process of design-
ing commercial aircraft that will carry
passengers at up to three times the
speed of sound. Such a large techno-
logicau advance in a relativelyshort
time has thrown an extra burden
upon designers of aerospace systems.
A part of this burden is the necessity
for dealing with the interaction and
possible failure of structures, compo-
nents, and instrumentation at intense
pressure ﬂuctuations. The term “sonic
fatigue” has been adopted to describe
t-his interaction with its subsequent
fatiguing effects.

"High-intensity sound ﬁelds, how-
ever, are not the only kind of ﬂuctuat-
ing pressure ﬁelds that are involved
in sonic fatigue. Turbulent boundary
layers next to surfaces of aircraft in
high subsonic o_r supersonic ﬂight,

vortices generated by high-speed ﬂow

past trailing edges, and oscillations of
shock fronts formed at abrupt con-
ﬁgurational changes are also impor-
tant factors. Whatever the sources of
the pressure fluctuation-s that excite a-
vibrational response in structures, we
need to ‘understand them better so
that we may properly predict vibra-
tional intensities and avoid the catas--

The illustration.‘ at left shows a Saturn rocket in supersonic
flight. Shock _wa_ves and a turbulent boundary layer flowing
around the missile _cause fluctuating pressures on the rocket
body; these may disrupt interior components or induce the
oscillation of metal panels, perhaps leading to fatigue.

trophic consequences of sonic fatigue.

Unfortunately, sonic fatigue is no
mere laboratory curiosity. Wing roots
of jet aircraft have exhibittd fatigue
cracks, which developed in part from
exposure to the intense sound ﬁelds
generated by the plane’s jet engines.
Accessory components of large missile
systems have malfunctioned when
subjected to high—intensity sound
ﬁelds simulating those expected in
operational systems. Failures in the
launching of actual missile systems
have been traced to critical compo-
nents which malfunctioned because of
sonic fatigue. l\Ioreover, the mecha-
nisms which are involved in the
fatigue of structures under excitation
by random high—intensity pressure
ﬂuctuations are by no means simplt.
It is impossible within the present
limits of knowledge to predict when
any given piece of metal subject to a
particular excitation will fail. The
problem will become even more criti-
cal as the speed of aircraft is in-
creased and the power of large
boosters for future missile systems

becomes much greater. Advanced
ﬂight vehicles will be expostd to pres-
sure ﬂuctuation intensities to which
no man-made structure has ever
before been subjected.

Sound Intensities
It is difficult to imagine tht level of

sound pressure which the Saturn
rocket—the U.S. booster that will put
a man on the moon——will generate.
A few comparisons will serve to indi-
cate how far from our common experi-
ence this level of sound will be
Speech at a normal conversational
tone is at a sound pressure level of
around 75 db (relative to 0.002 micro-
bar of pressure) at a distance of one
foot from the speaktr. A man speak-
ing generates about 0.0002 watt of
acoustical power. An automobile
moving at 45 miles per hour generates
0.1 watt of acoustical power; a '75-
piece orchestra generates about 100
watts. The maximum sound pressure
levels measured in the sound ﬁeld of
the engines of a Boeing 707 jet air-
liner are of the order of 170 db. Each
engine generates about 10 kilowatts

of acoustical power.

An early version of the Saturn
rocket generated between 25 million
and 40 million watts of acoustical
power during a static test ﬁring. At a
distance of seven miles, this sound
pressure level was the equivalent of a
nearby air hammer. Thus, the Saturn
moon rocket will produce about 3,000
times as much acoustical power as a
707 jet. The tremendous sound en-
ergy from the engines of a Saturn,
however, constitutes only a portion of
the total energy in pressure ﬂuctua-
tions which will be incident along the
body of the booster.

Chaotic Conditions
If we follow a Saturn booster as it

rises from the launching pad and
punches its way through the earth’s
atmosphere, we shall see how compli-
cated and chaotic are the pressure
ﬂuctuations it encounttrs. If they are
intense enough, they can excite de-
structive resonances in structural
panels, components of control sys-
tems, and other areas. Destructive

vibrations may be excited in fuel

Part of the supporting equipment of the sonic fatigue testing
facility at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is shown in this
photograph. This plumbing helps move compressed air into
a test chamber at a rate of more than 300,000 cubic feet
per minute at 29.3 psia pressure. The compressor which
supplies this airflow is powered by a 40,000 horsepower
motor. The test chamber (not shown) is 70 x 56 x 42 feet
—big enough to hold an entire jet fighter.

tanks and fuel lines, thus disturbing
the fuel feed rate and possibly leading
to an explosion of the boosttr.

As the engines ignite and the rocket
begins to lift off, the vehicle is en-
gulfed in the sound ﬁeld of its own
engines. As the rocket increases speed
and becomes supersonic, shock waves
of appreciable strength appear at con-
ﬁgurational changes in the rocket’s
proﬁle. Such shocks, when generated
by aircraft as they increase their
speed above that of sound, are the
familiar sonic booms that arefelt and
heard along the ground.

A boundary layer of turbulent air
will envelope the booster; its thick-
ness will vary from a fraction of an
inch at the nose cone to several inches
at the rear of the booster. This layer
contains intense random pressure ﬂue-
tuations immediately adjacent to the
booster’s skin. Flow in several direc-
tions can be found within the turbu-
lent boundary layer. Whorls or eddies
of gas are formed; these tend to move
downstream, causing pressure varia-
tions as they pass over the rocket
body.

The work of several investigators
points to the likelihood that shocks,
large and small, do not remain steady
but occillate about some mean posi-
tion. The very marked change in pres-
sure as the shock moves back and
forth over a point could excite reso-
nant vibration with its consequent
fatiguing. The fact that several such
excitations may be occurring simulta-
neously further complicates this
already difficult prob-lem.

Current State of Knowledge
The pressure ﬁelds which are the

excitation agents insonic fatigue are
characteristically random in nature.
This means that the pressure at any
given point for any given time is un-
predictable; it is entirely unrelated to
past conditions. All that can be spec-
iﬁed is the probability that the pres-
sure will lie within a speciﬁed range
of pressures at any given time. The
same is generally true of the displace-
ment, and resulting stress distribu-
tion, measured at any speciﬁed point
in a panel excited by such a pressure
ﬁeld. The randomness of effects thus
necessitates an analytical approach
that is statistical in nature. Interest
will then center on such features as

the probable distribution of pressure
or displacement of stress amplitude,
the ratio of peak amplitude to aver-
age amplitude, and the space-time
correlations of pressure distributions
over surfaces. Moreover, answers will
be given to the investigator in terms
of statistical measures.

The situation is not unique in phys-
ics. The kinetic theory of gases, for
example, is statistical in nature. In-
stead of concentrating on the motion
of each individual molecule of gas,
which is not of any practical interest,
one seeks to understand the statistical
behavior of a large number of gas
molecules. Such gas properties as
pressure and temperature, for exam-
ple, are really statistical concepts. In
a similar way, it is the statistical fea-
ture of the pressure ﬁelds, the panel
response, the associated stress ﬁelds
in the panel, and the resulting fatigue
life of the panel which we seek in
sonic fatigue studies.

We are only beginning to gain the
knowledge required to understand the
fatigue problem in structures subject
to random pressure excitation. As yet,
we have not formulated the proper
questions. For instance, it is not
known which parameters of the ex-
citation ﬁeld are important, nor how
they are related to the response of the
structure, nor what constitutes an
adequate description of that response.
There is no accepted theory relating
features of the induced stress ﬁeld in
the structure to some statistical de-
scription of its fatigue life.

Pracfical Measures

For vehicles that travel at subsonic
speeds, the practical solutions in this
unsatisfactory state of affairs have
been empirical. Exposure of models
or full-scale parts of complete struc-
tures to high—intensity sound ﬁelds
has revealed areas where failure may
be expected to occur. Relying on his
past experience, the designer knows
what he can do to “beef up” these
potential danger spots. Measurement
of vibration levels in "structures under
static test ﬁring has revealed areas of
high-level vigration; these are avoided
when instruments or auxiliary equip-
ment is attached to the superstruc-
ture. Electronic devices are encapsu-
lated in epoxy or made more rugged

-in other ways.

Such procedures have solved the
sonic fatigue problems that have been
met in the design of our currently
operational aircraft and missile sys-
tems. It is not likely that they will
be adequate for the problems of
future systems. The high sound pres-
sure levels which, for example, the
Saturn booster will encounter cannot
be generated in the laboratory. As
missile systems become larger and
more complex, launching early models
to gain information for later Versions
will no longer be economically feas-
ible. Other requirements, such as
weight restrictions and material prop-
erty restrictions, may preclude the
‘simple expedient of “beeﬁng up”
weak areas.

Lack of Measurements

Another serious difficulty in the in-
vestigation of sonic fatigue is the
problem of making meaningful mea-
surements. Certain measurements of
interest can be made in a supersonic
wind tunnel, ‘and shadowgraphs of
shock fronts and turbulence in super-
sonic ﬂows are valuable. But in a
supersonic ﬂow, the introduction of a
probe creates a shock wave around
the probe, thus distributing the very
conditions one wished to measure
initially.

At IIT Research Institute, progress
has been made in devising new instru-
mentation. A pressure sensing instru-
ment is being developed consisting of
a number of extremely small trans-
ducers, each approximately twenty-
thousands of an inch in diameter.
These are ﬂush mounted in a wall
over which a ﬂuid pas-ses. Because of
their small size, these transducers
make point measurements rather than
an average measurement over a large
area.

Another technique being developed
attempts to determine velocity, pres-
sure, and temperature within a stream
by optical means. If successful, this
will be the ﬁrst time that such
measurements have been made.
Facilities

A signiﬁcant step toward under-
standing the effects of sound upon an
entire structure, rather than upon a
particular panel or a discrete point on
that panel, is the construction of
facilities large enough to subject an
entire airframe, or a large portion of

it, to sound pressure tests. To this
end, the Air Force recently con-
structed a sonic fatigue facility at
Wright—Patterson Air Force Base in
Ohio capable of sound irradiation
powers of one million watts.

This facility, essentially a test
chamber 70 x 56 x 42 feet, was de-
signed to provide information on the
“fragility” levels of structures and to
enable proof-testing of ﬁnal design
structures. It was designed primarily
as a tool to investigate the effects of
acoustical excitation on ﬂight vehicles
and on the electronic and power
equipment which they carry. IITRI
scientists designed the acoustical
treatment of this chamber.

The high—intensity sound ﬁelds of
missiles, typically 170 db, are simu-
lated by a series of high- and low-fre-
quency sirens. Partially removable
acoustical lining treatment within the
test chamber allows investigations of
either progressive wave or diffuse ﬁeld
conditions. Progressive wave condi-
tions are relevant to a study of the
effects of sound on the exterior sur-
faces of planes, missiles, rockets, or
other ﬂight vehicles; diffuse ﬁeld con-
ditions are relevant to the study of
the effects within the interior spaces
of ﬂight vehicles or in missile silos.

The Future

What is needed, and soon, is a
signiﬁcant advance in instrumenta-
tion from the present state of capa-
bility to a much more sophisticated
level. The theoreticians, who are des-
perately looking for hard data either
to corroborate their ideas or to give
them new directions, will not be slow
in using the results obtained by this
new instrumentation.

The sonic fatigue problem for the
acoustician and ﬂuid dynamicist is a
complicated one. It is asithough these
scientists were asked to make com-
plete measurements of the flow ﬁeld
in the Mississippi River and to pre-
dict soil erosion at any point on its
banks. Yet, the sonic fatigue prob-
lem is not an impossible one to solve.
A keener appreciation of statistical
forms, coupled with a fundamental
understanding of the physics in-
volved, can be expected to yield much
useful information toward the solving
of this most difficult problem.

Engineering and Science at RCA

Ground Detection of
Space Objects in the Night Sky

RCA has designed and installed for the
Air Force a new optical satellite surveillance
system that utilizes advanced techniques in
several ﬁelds including physics, electronics,
mathematics and astronomy. Starting in the
laboratory with a bread-board experiment to
prove the feasibility of using image orthicon
tubes as detectors of moving targets among the

 

millions of stars in the night skies, a team of
scientists and engineers carried the project
through systems and design analysis, and
produced the requisite equipment even to
building an observatory on a mountain top in
New Mexico. The system is now being evalu-
ated under actual operating conditions. While
performance data are security classiﬁed it can
be said that the system is designed to detect,
without a priori information, very dim satellites
in real time, far beyond normal radar ranges.

Optical physics and engineering of the highest
order were required to produce an eleven-ton,
27 inch f/1 telescope that uses 6 million optical
ﬁbers to present images to 12 orthicon
cameras. Image motion processing necessary
to ﬁnd a tiny satellite moving slowly through a
star ﬁeld as dense as the Milky Way is accom-
plished by entirely automatic electronic signal
integration, star cancellation and data associ-
ation and reporting. The very latest techniques
of electronic engineering have produced highly
sophisticated equipment for ‘ control, data
gathering and analysis of results.

System design, performance evaluation and
computer programming have involved rigorous
mathematical analyses applied to new com-
binations of scientiﬁc disciplines. Proof of the
deductions are just beginning to emerge from
the observatory, and much will be learned
about applied astronomy as the system
is used.

color TV Receiver
Automatic Degaussing

Even the comparatively small magnetic ﬁelds
exhibited by the earth can cause visible errors
in color television reception. To give picturetube
output proper color alignment, while the TV
receiver is in any desired location, an effective
magnetic shield is required. But before a_
practical magnetic shield can perform its
function, the shield must be degaussed in the
speciﬁc magnetic ﬁeld to be shielded.

Degaussing enables the metal in the shield to
“forget” its previous magnetic orientation and
to magnetically realign to counteract any new
position. Degaussing affects the metal in the
picture tube’s shadow mask in the same manner.

Usually, a color television receiver is de-
gaussed by driving a solenoid wound coil with
120 volt AC line voltage and moving the coil
around the front of the tube . . . then slowly
drawing the coil away. This operation usually
is required every time the position of the color
receiver, with respect to the earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld, is changed.

Recently, RCAintroducedautomatic degauss-
ing. This gives the color instrument freedom of
movement, regardless of the earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld. Automatic degaussing also protects the
receiver from magnetic ﬁelds generated. by
nearby vacuum cleaners and other electrical
appliances.

An RCA innovation, automatic degaussing
is accomplished during initial warm-up—each
time the color receiver is turned on from a
cold start. The surge currents charging the
electrolytic capacitors of the B+ supply start
from a high value and decrease exponentially
during the charging time. A thermistor in
series with this charging current starts at
approximately 110 ohms and decreases to 4
ohms as the current’s heating effect changes
the resistance.

Resultant Horizontal Degaussing
llux created by -
lour coils

IJEGAUSSING FLUX PATTERN

A voltage-dependent resistor, in series with
the degaussing coils (wound on‘ the picture
tube shield), acts as a switch to connect the
coils across the thermistor only during the
warm-up of the receiver. Thus, the slow draw-
ing away of the coil in manual’ degaussing is
simulated automatically.

These recent achievements are indicative of the great range of activities in
research, applied research, advanced development, design and development
engineering at RCA. To learn more about the many scientiﬁc challenges

Energy Conversion

One of the most attractive new methods
for the direct conversion of heat to electricity
is the thermionic generator. In many applica-
tions, however, the efﬁcient use of a thermionic
generator requires some form of low voltage
DC to AC inversion. Such generators de-
veloped at RCA are capable of several hundred
watts output at eiﬁciencies of 20%. Because
this power is generated at only 0.5 volts,
techniques were needed to step up output to
practical voltage levels. Under Navy and Air
Force sponsorship, RCA has now developed a
tunnel diode inverter system capable of in-
verting the output of thermionic generators
and other low voltage power sources to any
AC voltage desired, with eﬁiciencies up to
80%. This is believed to be the ﬁrst time that
usable power has been developed from a
thermionic generator.

 

The new system employs the use of gallium
arsenide, a semiconductor material which
provides larger bandgaps and hence higher
eiﬁciencies and temperature capabilities. The
tunnel diode inverter system has the advantage
over previous designs in the following areas:

Radiation resistance—operable at radiation
levels of 1017 nvt with only small decreases in
eiﬁciency. Temperature—GaAs tunnel diodes
have been operated successfully at 200°C.
Circuit simplicity—An extremely simple circuit
is required consisting of only one transformer
and two tunnel diodes, while the more conven-
tional type of transistor inverter requires several
transformers, resistors, diodes and transistors.
Cost-Weight-Volume—Due largely to their sim-
plicity, these advantages are obvious over other
circuits of comparable performance.

These advanced engineering achievements
represent a real breakthrough in energy con-
version that is extremely important to our
defense and space efforts.

~iiiNUCLEAR PROGRESS

Journey of the Peaceful Atom

While the journey of the peaceful atom has been
along a path not without obstacles, the journey has
been eventful. Great names of the scientiﬁc com-
munity—not limited to any one nation—have pro-
ceeded along the path and have met at the various
crossroads. As our nation has drawn strength from
the co—mingling and diffusion of peoples from all over
the world, so have the atomic sciences been ad-
vanced by contributions from great minds of Eng-
land, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Hungary,
our own United States, and other nations.

It is worthwhile, I believe, to review the relatively
short time period of the development of atomic
energy so that we may have a little better under-
standing for the events that preceded the begin-
nings of the atomic era and some appreciation for
those men and women who gave so much of their
time and intellect to make atomic power a reality.

In point of time the journey might begin on
January 16, 1939. It was on that date that Dr. Niels
Bohr, the great physicist of Denmark, arrived in
New York, carrying with him the knowledge that
Hahn and Strassmann, working in a laboratory in
Berlin in 1938, had made a discovery which indicated
that uranium atoms had been ﬁssioned—had been
split into two entirely different elements by bom-
bardment with neutrons.

Twenty-five Years of Progress

Only a handful of people in those days would
have recognized the signiﬁcance of what had oc-
curred. A signiﬁcant number of that handful were

present at the Fifth Washington Conference on
Theoretical Physics, which met on January 26, 1939.
The Danish and Italian scientists—Bohr and
Dr. Enrico Fermi—opened that conference with dis-
cussions of the exciting new developments. Dr. Fermi
postulated that if neutrons were emitted during the
ﬁssioning process, a self-sustaining chain reaction
could be achieved and a new source of heat and
power would become available. He also hazarded a
guess that if the process were to progress unchecked
and uncontrolled an explosion of tremendous force
might be possible. Thus, a little more than 25 years
ago, only a few of the greatest scientiﬁc minds in
the world could consider or postulate a possibility
which laymen today know and accept as proven facts.

l939—Fermi Begins Nuclear Work

Together with Dr. Szilard, who came to this
country from his native Hungary to join him, Dr.

Fermi explored the frontiers of this new scientiﬁc I

concept. Having left his native Italy because of the
Fascist regime there, Dr. Fermi foresaw the war
clouds gathering throughout all of Europe and in
March of 1939 he went to the Navy Department to
brief military officers and civilian scientists of the
Naval Research Laboratory of the possibility that
uranium could be employed as an explosiveean ex-
plosive a million times more powerful than any of
the known explosives.

Fortunately President Roosevelt, although not a
scientist, had the mental capacity to recognize the
potential implications of this new scientiﬁc discov-
ery, as Well as the courage and foresight to initiate

economical nuclear power is close at hand.”

(“I t appears that the long-promised day of

an action for federal support. Without any publicity
he appointed an Advisory Committee on Uranium
to investigate the problem.

In addition to those scientists in the United States
who were working on isotope separation and on the
chain reaction, scientists in Great Britain, during
this period, were also working on ﬁssion experiments.
While many of the American scientists recognized
the possibility of an atomic bomb from the inception,
most of them were thinking primarily of a new source
of power even in those early days.

At the time no one could be .certain that the ex-
periments would be successful. Dr. Ernest 0.
Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron, best char-
acterized the need to pursue this research intensively
when he said:

“It will not be a calamity if when we get the answers
to the uranium problem they turn out negative from
the military point of view, but if the answers are
fantastically positive and we fail to get them ﬁrst, the
results for our country may well be a tragic disaster.”

This thought was uppermost in the minds of those
who struggled with what at times appeared to be
insurmountable obstacles during the difficult days
to come.

'|942—Contro|Ied Reaction

By the beginning of 1942 work on the uranium
project was well. on its way. In the summer of that
year the Army Corps of Engineers was assigned an
active part in the activity under what became known
as the Manhattan Engineer District.

While many important advancements were made
during the program, one of the most important de-
velopments occurred in 1942. In November, under
the West Stands of the University of Chicago’s
Stagg football ﬁeld, a graphite uranium reactor was
constructed. Under the leadership of Dr. Fermi, a
dedicated group of physicists, mathematicians, and
other scientists were engaged in an experiment,
which, if successful, would justify further expendi-
ture of time and money toward the goal of nuclear
energy. They were preparing to demonstrate whether
or not a controlled chain reaction could be obtained.

On December 2, 1942, the coded message went
out from Stagg Field to key government and
scientiﬁc oﬂicials, who anxiously had been awaiting
the result:

“The Italian navigator has landed in the New
World. The natives are friendly.”

It was perhaps the success of Dr. Fermi’s group
at the University of Chicago more than any other
single accomplishment in those early years which
established beyond doubt the feasibility of a self-
sustaining reaction for the release of enormous en-
ergies for either war or peaceful uses.

"The atom, as one of the...

can be utilized

'|945—AIamogordo

Finally, on July 16, 1945, all this intensive secret
development had its culmination in the ﬁrst atomic
bomb explosion at Alam_ogordo, New Mexico. What
had begun in 1940 with an initial expenditure of
$6,000 had been successfully accomplished in ﬁve
years through the dedication and hard work of those
engaged at all levels in the project and the expendi-
ture of approximately $2 billion.

'I946—AEC Established

In the year immediately following the war, the
United States began to direct its thoughts toward
the peaceful control of atomic energy. The Congress
in 1946 passed a law which established a civilian
agency—the Atomic Energy Commission—to take
responsibility for the direction and control of atomic
energy.

Because of the intransigeance of the USSR and
its post-World War II communistic expansion poli-
cies, the United States of necessity had to continue
to direct its efforts in the military. However we did
not neglect the civilian ﬁelds of atomic energy.
Within the scientiﬁc community a major debate oc-
curred. Whereas the atomic bomb was capable of
releasing tremendous energy, the concept of a far
more awesome and destructive weapon—the thermo-
nuclear bomb—began to evolve.

The thought which Dr. Lawrence proclaimed
prior to the development of the atom bomb applied
equally to the hydrogen bomb: Surely it would not
have been a calamity if it had not proved feasible,
but if we had failed to be ﬁrst the results for our
country would have been a tragic disaster.

l954——Civi|ian Programs Expanded

Although a great deal of emphasis has had to be
given to the military atom, we have not neglected
the peaceful uses of atomic energy. While the Atomic
Energy Act of 1946 authorized and directed the
AEC to conduct research and development in civil-
ian, as well as in military uses of nuclear power, the
Congress in 1954 greatly expanded the areas of co-
operation between the govermnent and private in-
dustry in furthering civilian applications of atomic
energy. Under the provisions of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954 and subsequent congressional authori-
zations, the Commission was authorized to enter
into a cooperative program with American manu-
facturers and electric utility companies to develop
and demonstrate the practical uses of atomic power
for the generation of electricity.

There are areas of our country, as, for example,
in New England where I come from, where the cost
of electricity is especially high because we are far
from coal and oil supplies. There are other areas in

 basic building blocks of nature. . .
for the betterment of mankind.”

the United States, as, for example, in Southern
California, where problems of smog require restric-
tions on the burning of coal and oil. The potential
use of nuclear fuel offers health and economic ad-
vantages to these areas.

While we do not now have a shortage of coal, oil,
or gas, these fuels are being used up at an increasing
rate. They cannot be replaced. We must prepare
now for the day when a substitute source of energy
will be required. Nuclear power has the potential of
providing a limitless supply of energy. I am happy
with the success we have thus far attained in the
development of nuclear energy, although we still
have a long way to go. Our ultimate objective is the
development of breeder reactors, which will produce
as much ﬁssionable material as they use. Then we
will have virtually a limitless source of energy.

l964—$'|.5 Billion To Date

The federal government to date has invested ap-
proximately $1.5 billion in the civilian nuclear power
program. It is an investment which in the years to
come will bring dividends to our nation by way of
untold beneﬁts derived from a virtually inexhaustible
supply of energy.

Today we have in operation in the United States
nuclear power plants with a total installed capacity
of over one million kilowatts of electric power. In
addition, nuclear powerplants are now being planned
or are under actual construction which will add
another three million kilowatts of electric power.

'l970—Five Million Kilowalls

In its 1962 Report to the President, the AEC es-
timated that the growth of nuclear power will con-
tinue to increase to a total of ﬁve million kilowatts

by 1970, and forty million kilowatts by 1980. More
recent ﬁgures by the Federal Power Commission
anticipate a higher rate of increase of nuclear power
during this time period.

There is no doubt about it. Civilian nuclear
power is here to stay and will continue to expand
not only in the United States but throughout
the world.

In addition to the generation of electricity, atomic
energy has many other civilian applications. It is
being employed daily in industry to save millions of

Basic Building Block of Nature

We must not permit the destructive forces of the
atom to prejudice us against its beneﬁcial attributes.
Nature, in its primitive forces—rain, wind, and sun
—can be destructive or can be the very basis for
the sustaining of life. The atom, as one of the basic
building blocks of nature, designed and fashioned
by God, similarly can be utilized for the betterment
of mankind.

We have made tremendous advancements in the
uses of atomic power. We live in the New World
created by the pioneers of the early Forties. We can
and must live at Peace with the Atom in the New
World.

The largest bridge for vehicular traffic in Europe will have none of the
traditional overhead spans, but rather T-shaped elements whose centers will
rest on piers.

Another unusual aspect of the bridge will be the use of hydraulic shock-
absarbers to cushion the impact of heavy traffic and strong winds. Weighing
243 lbs. and able to absorb a force of 66,000 lbs., they will be installed along
the length of the bridge to tie together the seperate sections of the crossing
and secure them in position.

Being erected over the Oosterschelde River, the new spanless bridge will
link two islands of the province of Zeeland in the southwestern part of The
Netherlands. It will be 3% miles long on its completion in 1966. Total cost +,-
of the project will approximate $17,800,000. Steel bridge overhead is temporary.

Nobody knows how many angels can dance on the
head of a pin, but a team of scientists revealed that
they’ve built the equivalent of 576 seperate light bulbs 1‘ 4"
on a single chip of silicon no larger than a lady’s
ﬁngernail.

Working in the research and development labora- kl
tories of Fairchild Semiconductor, the scientists devel- ',~__,
oped a solid state electronic device which contains 576
l1ght—em1tt1ng diodes on a SlllCOIl rectangle barely % inch 
on its longest dimension. The diodes can be ﬂashed one 2

at a time or in various combination-s.

First application is in a photographic reconnaissance
camera system. As the ﬁlm passes through the camera, >4» 
the tiny device ﬂashes various dot com-binations that
indicate all the information needed by the experts in
later analysis of the photos. This eliminates a bulky ».-2
system of prisms, optical lens, cathode ray tube, and
power supplies. E

Although the array of diodes depends on a small com- '97‘
puter to tell it what pattern to ﬂash, the actual power
for the light emitting elements can be supplied by a.
transistor radio battery.

IBM scientists have greatly increased the output of gallium arsenide injec-
tion lasers by using a novel type heat-sink mount. Continuous operation with
over one watt of light output has been achieved at liquid nitrogen temperature
(77 °K).

The heat-sink mount consists of a pair of indium-coated metal plates, which
provide both electrical Contact and mechanical support for the laser. The plates
are bonded at one end to an insulating spacer. The laser is inserted between
the plates at the opposite end and held in place by spring tension.

IBM researchers said the new mounting device has two features which
enable the laser to operate at increased power levels. First, hat is drawn away
quickly from the laser because of the metallurgical simplicity of design. Second,
mechanical pressure holds the laster, avoiding a thermal bond which tends to
degrade the performance’ of the injection laser.

E, H All moving parts operate on essentially frictionless air
bearings, permitting the greatest advance yet achieved

response to any force, either applied to him or by him,
causes the man to move as though he were weightless
in free space; One ﬁve-thousandth of a lb. force per
1,000 lbs. of load starts motion in any direction, including
'~ the vertical.

Spacecraft designers will use ~the Simulator to deter-

'54:

Why become an engineer at

Garrett-AiResearch? You’ll have to
work harder and use more of

your knowledge than engineers

at most other companies.

If you’re our kind of engineer,
you have some very deﬁnite ideas
about your career.

For example:

You’ve worked hard to get a
good education. Now you want to
put it to work in the best way
possible.

You will never be satisﬁed with
run-of-the-mill assignments. You
demand exciting,
challenging projects.

You not only accept
individual responsibil-
ity — you insist upon it.

Does that sound like ~ 7
you? Then AiResearch 
is your cup of tea. in

Our business is
mainly in sophisticated aerospace
systems and subsystems.

Here, research, design, and de-
velopment lead to production of

 

actual hardware.
That means you
have the oppor-
tunity to start with
a customer’s problem
and see it through to a
system that will get the job done.
The pro duct lines at AiResearch,
Los Angeles Division, are environ-
mental systems, ﬂight information
 and controls sys-
tems, heat transfer
systems, secondary
power generator
 systems for missiles
and space, electri-
cal systems, and
specialized indus-
trial systems.
In the Phoenix Division. there are
gas turbines for propulsion and
secondary power, valves and con-
trol systems, air turbine starters
and motors, solar and nuclear
power systems.
In each category AiResearch
employs three kinds of engineers.
Preliminary ‘design engineers do
the analytical and theoretical
work, then write proposals.
Design engineers do the lay-
outs; turn an idea into a product.
Developmental engineers are
responsible for making hardware
out of concepts.
Whichever ﬁeld ﬁts you best, we
can guarantee you this: you can
go as far and fast as your talents

 
   

can carry you. You can make as
much money as any engineer in a
comparable spot — anywhere. And
of course, at AiResearch, you’ll
get all the plus beneﬁts a top com-
pany offers.

Our engineering staﬁ is smaller
than comparable companies. This
spells opportunity. It gives a man
who wants to make a mark plenty
of elbow room to expand. And
while he’s doing it he’s working
with, and learning from, some of
the real pros in the ﬁeld.

If the AiResearch story sounds
like opportunity speaking to you-
don’t fail to contact AiResearch,
Los Angeles, or Phoenix, or see our
representative when he comes to
your campus. ‘

The name to remember for career potential? SIKORSKY.

It could be the ﬁrst step to a wise career decision.

For never was there a better opportunity for young engineers
like yourself to participate in the growth of a dynamic,
young industry . . . to enter the expanding world of advanced
VTOL systems.

Let’s enlarge on this point. Throughout the history of
engineering, man’s ability to progress has been accomplished
by combining one technology with another. And at Sikorsky
Aircraft we're doing just that.

The Sikorsky vehicle of today is an advanced VTOL system
. . . blending the technologies of sophisticated electronic
systems and the helicopter airframe to provide a uniquely
new, most versatile means of transportation. Today, our
VTOL systems are working in the broadest areas——ranging
from space capsule recovery to commercial and industrial

transport. And we are aiming far into the future with the
further advancement of this new technology.

And what about you? As a Sikorsky engineer, you would be
helping to move “tomorrow” closer by working in small
interdependent groups on demanding problems in such
areas as aerodynamics 0 human factors engineering
0 automatic controls 0 structures engineering 0 weight
prediction 0 systems analysis 0 operations research
0 reliability/maintainability engineering 0 autonavlga-
tlon systems 0 computer technology . . . among others.

Opportunities for individual stature and personal progress
are here . . . now.

And professional competence is further advanced by our car-
poration-ﬁnanced Graduate Education Program.

Should You Work for a Big Company?

 

S. W. CORBIN

I Wells Corbin heads what is probably
the world's largest industrial sales organi-
zation, employing more than 8000 persons
and selling hundreds of thousands of di-
verse products. He joined General Electric
in 1930 as a student engineer after gradu-
ation from Union College with a BSEE. After
moving through several assignments in in-
dustrial engineering and sales management,
he assumed his present position in 1960.
He was elected a General Electric vice
president in 1963.

Q. Mr. Corbin, why should I work for
a big company? Are there some
special advantages?

A. Just for a minute, consider what
the scope of product mix often found
in a big company means to you. A
broad range of products and services
gives you a variety of starting places
now. It widens tremendously your op-
portunity for growth. Engineers and
scientists at General Electric re-
search, design, manufacture and sell
thousands of products from micro-
miniature electronic components and
computer-controlled steel-mill sys-
tems for industry; to the world's
largest turbine-generators for utili-
ties; to radios, TV sets and appli-

ances for consumers; to satellites
and other complex systems for aero-
space and defense.

Q. How about attaining positions of
responsibility?

A. How much responsibility do you
want? If you’d like to contribute to
the design of tomorrow's atomic re-
actors—or work on the installation
of complex industrial systems—or
take part in supervising the manu-
facture of exotic machine-tool con-
trols—or design new hardware or
software for G-E computers—or direct
a million dollars in annual sales
through distributors——you can do it,
in a big company like General Elec-
tric, if you show you have the ability.
There's no limit to responsibility . . .
except your own talent and desire.

Q. Can big companies offer advan-
tages in training and career develop-
ment programs?

A. Yes. We employ large numbers of
people each year so we can often set
up specialized training programs
that are hard to duplicate elsewhere.
Our Technical Marketing Program,
for example, has specialized assign-
ments both for initial training and
career development that vary de-
pending on whether you want a
future in sales, application engineer-
ing or installation and service engi-
neering. in the Manufacturing Pro-
gram, assignments are given in manu-
facturing engineering, factory super-
vision, quality control, materials man-

agement or plant engineering. Other
specialized programs exist, like the
Product Engineering Program for you
prospective creative design engineers,
and the highly selective Research
Training Program.

Q. Doesn’t that mean there will be
more competition for the top jobs?

A. You'll always find competition
for a good job, no matter where
you go! But in a company like G.E.
where there are 150 product opera-
tions, with broad research and sales
organizations to back them up, you’ll
have less chance for your ambition to
be stalemated. Why? Simply because
there are more top jobs to compete
for.

Q. How can a big company help me
fight technological obsolescence?

A. Wherever you are in General Elec-
tric, you'll be helping create a rapid
pace of product development to
serve highly competitive markets. As
a member of the G-E team, you'll
be on the leading edge of the wave
of advancement—by adapting new re-
search findings to product designs,
by keeping your customers informed
of new product developments that
can improve or even revolutionize
their operations, and by developing
new machines, processes and
methods to manufacture these new
products. And there will be class-
work too. There's too much to be
done to let you get out of date!

Don't worry!

For those graduates who are uncertain regarding their career
plans, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the wide variety
of interesting and challenging assignments available with
Sylvania Electronic Systems. SES is equipped to foster the
professional growth of graduates with widely differing goals.
This is possible primarily because SES is actually a highly
diversified complex which encompasses 19 R&D laboratories,
4 manufacturing plants and a world-wide field engineering
operation. The Division's mission is to manage government
systems programs for General Telephone & Electronics, the

How would you like to work

with engineers and scientists

who...

HOLD THE, FIRST U.S. PATENTS ON
RADAR and who recently designed a
hand-held radar

CREATED AN ARTIFICIAL HEART
based on fluid amplification

DESIGNED THE FIRST SOLAR CELLS
FOR OUTER SPACE . . . as well as the
first communications, and the first
weather satellites

CONCEIVED THE BASIC TECHNIQUES

This listing is woefully incomplete,
but serves to indicate the nature of
the research work being carried on by
scientists and engineers within—of all
things-the U.S. Army. We admit it-
few people realize just how much basic
and applied research we in the Army
must do ourselves in order to provide
the most advanced equipments and
systems to the operating forces.

But the fact is ‘this: there are some

 

13,000 civilian scientists and engineers
working in dozens of Army research
laboratories and facilities throughout
the country whose contributions to
humanitarian as well as military well-
being could not be chronicled in a
single volume . . . to say nothing of
this single-page advertisement.

Why such outstanding
research results from
within the Army?

I Because we have some of the finest
research equipment and facilities in
the world.

I Because we are free to pursue
promising concepts without profit-
making limitations.

I Because we work on a succession
of major programs and projects whose
importance assures us of no contract
worries . . . no “Termination Blues."

I Because some of the greatest
names in science and technology call
the Army their home.

I Because we free the dedicated re-
search man from administrative detail,
allowing him to apply his total talents
to study and experimentation.

 

If you've kept up with events in
Washington these days, you'll know
that the Army has been conducting
outstanding R&D work in aviation,
communications, missiles, tactical
weaponry, and the related human
behavioural sciences.

Knowing this, doesn't it make sense
that the Army would make an ideal
starting point for your professional
career. Particularly since graduates
with their bachelor's degree can work
up to the $10,000 to $12,000 salary
bracket within 4 years—while enjoy-
ing all the benefits of Career Civil
Service.

ENGINEERS’ SALARIES

by Carl Frey

ls the rate of salary increases slowing down?

Who is earning more, the teacher of engineering
or the engineer in industry? What's the worth
of an advanced degree? Here is a ten-year analysis

IN BRIEF: Engineers’ salaries continue to
rise, but more moderately than during the
early ﬁfties. The experienced teacher of en-
gineering is catching up with the engineer
in industry, and is even earning more when
his outside income is added on. An advanced
degree is worth a few thousand dollars per
year: A 40-year-old engineer with a mas-
ter's earns over $2000 more than the 1,0-
year-old bachelor engineer—and the doctor
of engineering earns about $4400 more per
year than the bachelor. If you received your
BS in 1953, you should be earning 182%
more today than you earned then. The older
engineer has not enjoyed such increases
during these past ten years.-D.A.

I This article will explore several basic ques-
tions regarding engineers’ salary scales, and
how those scales have shifted during this past
decade. I doubt that you will be startled at the
broad revelation here, which shows that engi-
neers’ salaries have moved upward rather
rapidly. Indeed, one would be surprised if the
shift had been otherwise, for the impact of
engineering on national welfare and national
defense has probably been as great during
these past ten years as during any period in
our history.

This Will not be an exhaustive statistical
analysis. What I shall do is take relevant
data, from 1953 to 1964, and show what has
happened with regard to speciﬁc questions.
For example, in one of the ﬁrst illustrations,
you will see the rate at which engineers’ sal-
aries have been rising. In another, you can
compare salary scales in different industries. I
will comment on these charts and tables as we
go through the article, citing trends that seem
particularly signiﬁcant. Although I shall
rely mainly on the Engineering Manpower
Commission's survey series, which goes back
to 1953, several other surveys are used in the
development of this article; these are cited
later. And ﬁnally, after we have looked over
the signiﬁcant trends, I will speculate on the
future of engineers’ salaries.

Let us begin with a comparison: How is the
engineer doing, as‘ compared with other pro-
fessionals?

The chart provides us with information in
only the most general of terms, for data on
many professions is scant. The data on which

this chart is based are from four sources: the
Engineering Manpower Commission, the Na-
tional Science Foundation’s National Register
of Scientiﬁc and Technical Personnel, the De-
partment of Labor’s National Survey of Pro-
fessional, Administrative, Technical and Cleri-
cal Pay, and Medical Economics, which is the
best available source in the ﬁeld of compensa-
tion for medical doctors. The salary ﬁgure for
M.D.’s is the 1963 median income, after ex-
penses, for physicians in practice for 11 to 20
years. On the salary ﬁgure for engineers, there
is an opportunity to compare the ﬁndings of
two surveys: the Engineering Manpower Com-
mission’s, which found for 1964 that the
median engineering salary was $11,325, and
the Labor Department’s, which calculated a
slightly lower ﬁgure, $11,184.

Two factors tend to work against one an-
other among the chemists and physicists: On
the one hand, the high percentage of PhD’s
among them—37% in chemistry, 35% in
physics, vs. 5% in engineering—tends to pull
the chemists’ and physicists’ averages up; on
the other hand, the high proportion of chem-
ists and physicists employed in nonindustrial
positions tends to depress their average sal-
aries: 33% of chemists and 60% of physicists
have nonindustrial jobs, teaching primarily,
while only 25% of the engineers are so em-
ployed.

I want to make one qualiﬁcation regarding
the ﬁgure on attorneys: The ﬁgure cited in
the table, from the Labor Department survey,
does not include attorneys who are self-em-
ployed, and hence probably does not reﬂect the
true average income of the legal profession.
