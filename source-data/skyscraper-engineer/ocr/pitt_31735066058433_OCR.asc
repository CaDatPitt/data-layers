James Chisholm, class of ’4I,

speaks from experience when he says,

“Men with ability and ambition really have
a chance to get ahead at U. S. Steel”

0 A responsible position can come
quickly to those graduate engineers at
U.S. Steel who show ability and ambi-
tion. Management training programs
are designed to stimulate and develop
these qualities as the trainee “learns by
doing.” His training is always a fascin-
ating challenge and he works with the
best equipment and the ﬁnest people in
the business.

James Chisholm is typical of the
young men who rapidly rise to an im-
portant position at U.S. Steel. Jim
came to U.S. Steel as a trainee in 1941
after graduating as an M.E. Shortly
thereafter he entered military service
for four years. Upon his return to U.S.
Steel in 1946, he advanced steadily un-
til, in 1951, he was appointed to his
present position as Assistant Superin-
tendent of Blast Furnaces at the new
Fairless Works at Morrisville, Pa.

Jim is now in charge of the unload-

UNION SUPPLY COMPANY

ing of all ore ships and the operation of
the plant’s two big blast furnaces—each
with a rated output of 1500 tons per day.

Jim feels that the opportunities for
graduate engineers are exceptional at
U.S. Steel. He remarked that in his own
department alone, six college trainees
have been put into management posi-
tions within the last couple of years. He
says that chances for advancement are
even better now with the current expan-
sion of facilities and the development
of new products and markets.

More and better
job

for more people

GENERAL MOTORS President Harlow H.
Curtice speaking:

“Just as an example of how job opportunities
in General Motors have grown, here is what
has happened since 194-0.

“In 1940, we had 233 thousand employes on
our payrolls in the United States and Canada.
In 1955, our employment totals 520 thousand
—an increase of 287 thousand good jobs in
only 15 years.”

It stands to reason that a climate where job
opportunities expand with such rapidity must
be especially fruitful of career opportunities for
young men holding engineering degrees.

For, in the ﬁnal analysis, the very life’s blood
of our organization is the never—ending pro-
duction of “more and better things for more
people”—and that, very deﬁnitely, requires the
engineering mind at its best.

In point of fact, although engineering

graduates comprise a mere two per cent of total
GM employment, they will eventually fill
about forty per cent of executive posts if the
established pattern continues.

Why not, then, look into the possibility of
enjoying a rewarding career as a GM engineer?
You’ll be interested in a big newl36—page hand-
book entitled, “job Opportunities in General
Motors.” Your college library or placement
ofﬁce should have it.

Initiative alone is not the answer to a man’s
career. A man can’t travel far in narrow, limited
conﬁnes. Neither can he expand in an unprogres-
sive, stagnant organization. A man needs oppor-
tunity to put his ideas into action. He needs to be
able to move ahead without waiting for vacancies
to occur from death or retirement.

Two years ago we announced the world’s
most powerful production aircraft engine.

Since then, the J -57 turbojet has been se-
lected by many top airframe manufacturers to
power their most outstanding new designs. For
these ﬁghters, bombers and transports, we have
built over 1000 complete engines —— the equiva-
lent of more than 10,000,000 horsepower.

Today the J -57 is still unmatched anywhere
—— an important factor in this country’s su-

special measuring instruments greatly speed up the collection of pump performance
data. That’s one way Worthington products are made more reliable by using . . .

...tho world's most versatile hydraulic proving ground

When you make pumping equipment that has to stand up and
deliver year after year anywhere in the world, you’ve got to be sure
it will perform as speciﬁed.

That’s why we built one of the world’s largest hydraulic test
stands at our plant in Harrison, New Jersey. Here, over a half-
acre “lake,” we can check the performance of anything from a
fractional horsepower unit to pumps handling over 100,000 gallons
a minute. When you realize there are thousands of sizes and types
of centrifugal pumps alone, you get an idea of the versatility we
had to build into our proving-ground.

Naturally, our new test equipment is a big help to our research
engineers, as well as our customers. Now they get performance
data on products quickly and accurately. Using it, we can save

editorial

With thoughts of summer_ vacations ocurring,
many of us wonder if the school year has slipped by
without our realizing it. A great number of us will
be filled with ideas of part-time jobs and recreational
diversions. Yet a third group will reflect on how
much they have accomplished in the last eight months.
An individual in the last mentioned catergory is the
person bearing the proper attitude for an engineer-
ing career. One of these same individuals, while sur-
veying accomplishments with the proper perspective,
would immediately see that when spoken of collec-
tively, they are referred to as progress. Being the
abstraction that it is, progress has several unique
features.

Perhaps one of the oddest of these features is the
fact that people have a. tendency to acclaim it as it
marches by rather than join the parade and contri-
bute to it. Although acclaimers outnumber the march-
ers by millions, the marchers still surge forward.
This can readily be seen by the fact that in the course
of two thousand years, relatively few persons have
been instrumental in changing history.

Yet there is a more outstanding characteristic
about those who are in the march of progress. Let’s
take the case of the team inseparable in the cause of
education, the school and the student. As the school
teaches and the student learns, each progesses. As
the school advances, the worth of the student increas-
es. In like manner, as the quality of the student
improves, the reputation of the school moves higher
and higher. Once an individual joins the parade of
progress, advancement is inevitable.

Can one see progress? No, not without visual-
izing and comparing the past, present and the future.
The same individual who tried to sum up his ac-
complishments of the past eight school months could
spend quite a bit of time wondering if he has pro-
gressed. In fact, he may spend the entire summer
thinking about this, only to find school taking up
session again. The cycle evolves once more
and progress marches on.

Perhaps one fault of the student lies in his in-
ability to look back at himself as he really is. Only
then would he realize that he was caught in the wheels
of progress while in school. Only then can he see
that he had the opportunity to march and instead he
acclaimed. Only then will he have realized that he
should have fallen in step while in school — and after
2;raduation he could have kept marching.

Long-Range Development Program Provides for

New Engineering Test and Research Facilities

0 Allison’s $75 million expansion program in ENGI-
NEERING, RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT facilities
creates the need for a 40 per cent increase in our en-
neering staff.

Completion of the ﬁve-year program—ﬁnanced by
General Motors—will give Allison, and Indianapolis,
one of the world’s most complete, best equipped, cen-
ters for the development of new, high performance
turbo-prop and turbo-jet aircraft engines for both mili-
tary and commercial use.

As General Motors President Harlow H. Curtice
said in the announcement, “Engines in production
today cannot meet the requirements of the aircraft of
tomorrow where ability to operate at supersonic
speeds, and very high altitudes, will continue to be
demanded from engine builders . . . To design and

build engines with such advanced performance, test

I (I

facilities are required which go far beyond the capa-
bilities of equipment in existence today. In recognition
of this need, General Motors will add extensive high
performance test facilities to those already established
and in operation at the Allison Division.”

Already a recognized leader in the design, develop-
ment and production of turbo-jet and turbo-prop en-
gines, Allison NOW is in a position to offer even
greater opportunities to the technically-trained, well-
qualiﬁed, young graduate who is interested in building
his engineering career with a pace setter in the ﬁeld.

Whether you’re still in school, or graduating this
year, we’d like to tell you more about your engineering
future at Allison. Write to:

The Tcrrington Needle Beaming
...designed for easy, effective lubrication

One major advan-
tage inherent in
Needle Bearing de-
sign is the ease with
which the bearing
can be lubricated.

The full complement of small di-
ameter rollers continuously carries
a thin ﬁlm of lubricant to all contact
surfaces. The turned-in lips of the
outer shell retain the lubricant and
effectively seal out foreign matter.

Methods of
Lubrication

 

When Needle Bearings are shipped,
they are normally protected with a
high-grade slushing compound
which has lubricating value at ordi-
nary temperatures. This compound
is left in the bearings in most in-
stances. Needle Bearings in many
applications run for long periods of
time without further attention to
original lubrication.

There are several methods of
providing additional lubricant to
Needle Bearings, as illustrated and
described below.

PERMANENT LUBRICATION

For low speed and light load applications,
as in the ﬁngers of the automobile clutch
illustrated, the Needle Bearings are
packed with grease before assembly. No
additional lubrication is needed.

4» -<%> Q
/ Q

W9

\_

\ /

 

THROUGH THE SHAFT

If it is necessary to lubricate through the
shaft, a hole is drilled along the shaft axis,
with a cross hole leading under the lips of
the Needle Bearing. This hole is located

MAY 1955

under the lip of the bearing rather than in
the roller contact area. Textile machine
spindle swing bracket below illustrates
this method.

THROUGH THE HOUSING

When lubricant is to be delivered through
the housing, an oil hole is furnished in the
middle of the outer shell. In automobile
king pin below, Needle Bearings are
lubricated with Alemite ﬁttings through
the oil hole. This oil hole in the outer
shell should be outside the load area.

CIRCULATING OIL SYSTEM

For high speeds and heavy loads, a cir-
culating oil system is preferred as it aids
in carrying away heat as well as in provid-
ing a continuous supply of lubricant to
the bearing contact surfaces. A typical
example of this method is shown in this
Needle Bearing application in the valve
rocker arm of a large diesel engine shown
below.

 

Selecting A Lubricant

While oil is the best lubricant, it is
difﬁcult in many cases to retain it in
the bearing housing. In general, a
soda base grease is used in the ab-
sence of moisture, and a lime base
grease when moisture is present. It
is usually advisable to consult a
grease manufacturer regarding
a particular application.

These features make the

TH E
ALUMIN UM INDUSTRY
WAS BORN ON
 V In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company-
located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of

 Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
The men of this company had real engineering abilities and
viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers . . .
leaders . . . men of vision.

A lot has happened since 1 888. The country . . . the

company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new

territories have become states, for one thing. The total

industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people-
and the little outﬁt on Smallman Street? Well, it’s a lot

bigger, too—and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
ALUMINUM COMPANY or AMERICA . . . but it’s still the
leader—still the place for engineering “firsts”.

As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a

dynamic company like Alcoa—for real job stability
and pleasant working conditions—where good

men move up fast through their association with

the recognized leaders in the aluminum industry.

The final step has been taken to make Pittsburgh
the National Headquarters for Atomic Power Tech-
nology.

The Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the
University of Pittsburgh recently announced the es-
tablishment of an extensive program of graduate fel-
lowships on a scale which is non-existent elsewhere.
Graduate engineering students will work at the West-
inghouse Atomic Power Division while attending
some classes at Pitt for a period of two years. Mean-
while they will be paid industrial scale salaries as well
as their tuition. On the third year the students will
be given a full year of leave with pay to attend the

veloping the plan.

Recently the Westinghouse Electric Corporation
successfully built the atomic power plant for the sub-

marine “Nautilus” and has contracted to produce
two more. Also, the new Duquesne Light Company
atomic power plant north of Pittsburgh is being built
by Westinghouse. In addition, Westinghouse will
soon build a six and one—half million dollar reactor
for testing atomic fuels and effects of radioactivity
on metals in Blairsville, Pa.

The economic key to the success of nuclear pow-
er is its freedom from natural resources. A nuclear
power plant could be constructed in the center of the
Sahara Desert. The areas of this and other countries
which are devoid of natural fuels, water power, etc.
will now be able to develop industries utilizing atomic
power. It is also axiomatic that the welfare of a
people is proportional to its use of power.

This new educational venture does not mean that
a different curriculum must be prepared for degrees
in Nuclear Engineering. Instead all types of engin-
eers can contribute to the development of nuclear
power once they are aware of the problems. The new
program will be designed to this end. The electrical
engineers obviously will be in demand for the instru-
mentation and control of the reactor (or nuclear
furnace) as well as the distribution of the electrical
power which will be developed. The steam generated
by the nuclear reactor will be circulated at high tem-
peratures and pressures and will require the thermo-
dynamic “know how” of the mechanical and chem-
ical engineers. Heat transfer and fluid flow problems
are innumerable. The metallurgical engineer will be
required to develop metals which will make higher
temperatures and pressures of operation possible and
to determine the effects of radiation on the properties
of metals.

Many construction problems await solution by
the civil engineer and problems dealing with the
disposal of radioactive waste materials fall to the
chemical engineers.

Nevertheless, the age of practical atomic power is
here. Pittsburgh, and the Schools of Engineering
and Mines at Pitt through the efforts of such indus
tries as Westinghouse, is to be the center of its de-
velopment.

Electronic Computers

It took men millions of years to invent and rec-
ognize the usefulness of the wheel. But, in a single
generation, our scientists and manufacturers have
produced more new products than all the generations
which preceeded them. To these men, no series of re-
cent technological developments is more promising
than those involving machines capable of electronic
processing of scientific and business data. These
machines did not “just happen.” They were devel-
oped as the result of intensive and continuous scien-
tific research.

IBM built the first large-scale digital calculator,
the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, which
has operated successfully at Harvard University since
1944. This calculator, by proving what a giant mach-
ine could do is credited with starting the present lively
developments in the field of “giant brains.” In 1948
an improved model of this device was installed in

New York. Since then, these same electronic principles
have been applied to thousands of smaller electronic
calculators.

Two kinds of computers are talked about today.
They are often labeled as “mechanical brains,” but
they are very different in construction and appli-
cation. One is analogue. The other is digital.

Analogue computers are so named because they
operate by setting up physical situations which are
similar (analogous) to mathematical situations. For
example, Ohm’s Law, one of the fundamental natural
laws of electricity, says that, “Voltage equals Current
times Resistance." By substituting different values as
currents and resistances, it is possible to perform mul-
tiplications with the answers read as voltages.

Thus an analogue computer is essentially a meas-
uring device. It can be mechancial, electrical, or
electronic. The speedometer in your automobile is
one simple kind of analogue computer. It converts
the rate of turning of a shaft into a numerical ap-
proximation of speed. A slide rule belongs to the
analogue family. Distance between points on the
“Slip stick” are read numerically in such a way that
they give the approximate answers to multiplications,
divisions, roots, and so on.

Many of the devices in fire control and naviga-
tion of aircraft are analogue computers, as are the
differential analyze-rs in some engineering labora-
tories. This type of a device is often used to simulate
a physical problem, such as the theoretical flight of
an airplane with specific design characteristics, or the

load upon the distribution method of an electric
utility.

Digital computers have come down through the
ages, first in the form of the abacus, the first crude
adding machine invented by Pascal, and finally the
ancestor of the desk calculator invented by Leibnitz.

The modern digital computers can perform very
long sequence of computation automatically, making

decisions and referring to memory as they go along.
Their input—output facilities are capable of handling
a steady stream of information. They are general-
purpose machines capable of solving any mathematical
problem that can be expressed numerically. It is
these abilities that have made them such valuable
tools to scientists and business men.

Digital computers owe their name to the ten
digits on our two hands. Because we have ten fingers
and not eleven, eight, twelve, or six, most compu-
tation is based on the familiar decimal system. But
there are other symbols and numbers systems. The
Romans had their own system, but it is now obsolete.
A new system, the binary number system, is increas-
ing in importance. It uses only two digits, zero and
one. Various combinations of these two digits in
series represent numbers in the decimal system. Since
only two digits are required, binary numbers may be
represented in electronic equipment by vacuum tubes
—— being either on or off. That is why binary arith-
metic is so popular with computer engineers. The
“on” condition may represent “l” and “off” may rep-
resent “0". Fortunately, machines can be designed to

take in decimal numbers, convert them to binary,

decimal - an automatic operation which makes every-
one happy.

A digital computer, as the term is used here, em-
bodies in one machine the following components:
input, storage, arithmetic, control, and output.

Input - a computer must have input facilities
able to handle and read information from some phys-
ical medium. Such devices, for example, may work
with punched cards, punched tape, or magnetic tape.

Storage - the internal storage of a computer con-
sists of a group of electro-mechanical or electronic
devices. These can be of two types, magnetic drum
or electrostatic storage tubes. In this component,
information is stored until the computer is ready to
use it. It is readily accessible, it can be referred to
once or many tmes and it can be replaced whenever
desired. The information held there can be original
data, intermediate answers, or instructions. Each
storage location is identified by its own individual
number or symbol which is called an “address."

Arithmetic - this unit is capable of addition, sub-
traction, multiplication or division. More complex
calculations are always made up of combinations of
these basic operations. Also, this unit can distinguish
between positive, negative, and zero values, and pass
this information on to other parts of the computer.
The arithmetic unit operates on either a parallel or
a serial basis. A parallel computer has an arithmetic
unit which operates on all the digits of a factor sim-
ultaneously. This is like the familiar desk adding

In todays air age, the jet and rocket engines are
stealing the lime light. Another type of engine, once
proven inefficient and impractical, is now coming
back on its own. In this article, Don Rooney relates
the development of the Diesel aircraft engine.

Diesel Engines In Aviation

by Donald Rooney, Aero. E. '57

In 1897, Dr. Rudolph Diesel placed the finishing
touches on his famed four-stroke cycle engine. Eigh-
teen years later, Dr. Hugo Junkers, realizing its
potential, conceived the idea of applying this power
plant to modern aviation. Carburetion and combus-
tion were the primary differences between the or-
dinary four-stroke cycle gasoline engine and Dr.
Diesel’s engine. In the gasoline engine, fuel is mixed
in the carburetor; Diesel’s engine mixed fuel in the
cylinder. In Diesel’s engine, the method of combus-
tion is solely the admission of air instead of fuel on
the suction stroke, the compression of air resulting

in heat during the compression stroke. Oil, then in-
jected at a high pressure, combines with the heated
air (1000 degrees Fahrenheit) and ignites. This oper-
ation entirely eliminates the use of spark plugs.

When first introduced, Dr. Diesel’s engine was con-
fined to use in industry. One of the first steps to
develop the engine for transportation was taken by
Dr. Hugo Junkers when he decided that the massive
bulk was going to fly. Junkers applied his creative
imagination to the extent of his ability. His first
aircraft diesel designed was six cylindered, develop-
ing 500 horespower at 2400 rpm’s. He also designed
a 1000 horsepower engine which shows his extraor-
dinary progressiveness. The most powerful gasoline
engine in use before World War I developed only
350 horsepower. In 1910 Junkers secured a patent
on an all-wing airplane. Although he 'was highly
respected, many of his contemporaries considered Dr.
Junkers to be foolish for promoting such a project.
Forty years later, a flying wing was perfected and
manufactured by the United States Government.

Designing the diesel aircraft and making them
fly proved to be only half the job. Junkers, confident
of his designs and their capability of flights, was a-
bout to go into production when the First World
\/Var began. Although his immediate plans were stop-
ped, Junkers was convinced that he could construct
an engine with an amount of horsepower sufficient
to overcome the weight of the powerplant and by

so doing placed the fastest. most efficient plane ever
developed into the air. His plans were quickly crush-
ed when Germany lost the war. With sixty years of
active life behind him, Junkers saw his dreams rapid-
ly slip from his grasp.

His flying diesel was buried even deeper on the
drawing board when it was announced that, under
the Treaty of Versailles, Germany would be forbid-
den to build any aircraft engine exceeding 100 horse-
power until l925. With this restriction in mind,, the
clever, determined Junkers started building and test-
ing the largest, most powerful truck engines in auto-
motive history.

In 1928, Junkers eliminated the cross leads and
long connecting rod in his engine, added another
crankshaft and two months later predicted that his
truck engine would fly. It actually took a year, but
Junkers did see his diesel fly several years before his
death in 1935.

Shortly before his death, Junkers perfected the
Junkers Jumo 205 which was a two-stroke cycle en-
gine. ln the two-stroke cycle Diesel engine there is
no inlet valve; instead there are ports which are shut
off by the piston when it goes up on its compression
stroke. There is, however, an exhaust valve in the
cylinder head which opens as the incoming air drives
the exhaust gases upward at the start of the compres-
ion stroke. The Junkers Jumo had no supercharger
but did utilize a centrifuge-type blower. The en-
gine was watercooled, developing 800 horsepower at
3000 rpm’s. It was an “in—line six”, with two banks
of three cylinders (opposite) each equipped with sin-
gle unit fuel ejector pumps. Junkers’ engine was
utilized extensively by transport and cargo planes
in Germany but was much too heavy fo-r a single
engine aircraft.

After 1935, the policy was to produce even more
economic, efficient engines, which were, nevertheless,
still too heavy for us in single engine aircraft. Every-
one was anxious to perfect the Diesel engine with
maximum horsepower and minimum weight. During
the height of competition, Mercedes-Benz developed
and manufactured a “monster”. They had created
the largest “in-line” diesel aircraft ever built. It was
named the Mercedes—Benz D. B.-602 and was equip-
ped with sixteen individual water-cooled cylinders
(in two banks) developing a maximum of 1320 horse-
power at 1650 rpm’s. It weghed 2.2 tons, with a
weight to horsepower ratio of 3.3 pounds per horse-
power. Four of these engines powered the famous
Zeppelin Hindenburg at the time of its crash in 1937.
It is easy to see that nothing short of a dirigible
could have lifted the engines from the ground.

In the early 1930’s, the United States utilized a
diesel aviation engine in the world wide race for a
fast, economic, single engine plane. Capt. \/Voolson
of the Packard Motor Car Company developed a nine
cylinder, 225 horsepower at 1950 rpm’s engine which
he installed in his Stinson Detroiter. With this, he flew
from Detroit to Miami for less than one cent per
mile in fuel cost. Woolson was later caught in a
severe storm, crashed and was killed near Attica, N.Y.

VVith Capt. Woolson’s death, Packard’s diesel
initiative and interest died in spite of the fact that
the company had been awarded the Colliers Trophy
for the most important contribution to aviation in
1931. A Packard diesel had held a plane in the air
for 84 hours and 32 minutes, setting a new world's
record for a constant, non- refueling flight. Late in
the thirties, the diesel aviation engine rapidly pro-
gressed, mainly because of its advantages over all

‘Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, is a rapidly growing cosmopolitan city of nearly 900,000 people. lt is the governmental, ﬁnancial, com-
mercial and cultural center of Venezuela, and the mam ofﬁces of most large domestic and foreign companies are ghere_

When Horace Mills, a soft-spoken Texan who is
employment manager in New York for the Creole
Petroleum Corporation, leads his teams of recruiters
on their annual visits to campuses throughout the
U. S., he confesses to recurring twinges of gnawing
responsibility.

“Soon after we arrive on the campus for inter-
views, placement officers and preliminary talks with
individual students have enabled us to narrow down
the field to those candidiates in whom we are inter-
ested,” he explains. “Then our real problem of sel-
ection begins”.

“The interview is never long enough for us,
he confides earnestly, “because we can’t escape the
feeling that the young man across the desk is a po-
tential president of our billion-dollar corporation.”

Mills and his aides are confident that this year’s
crop is a good one. As you read this, 38 newly-hired
“potential presidents” are making ready to depart for
Venezuela, where Creole is the largest oil producer, to
begin two-year assignments with a company TIME
magazine has called: “one of the world’s most progres-
sive firms.”

They were recruited from 35 campuses. Their
new degrees attest that they are geologists, paleon-
tologists, accountants, business administrators and e-
conomists, with engineers — mechanical, petroleum,
chemical, general and electrical in the majority. Many
are veterans. They hail, among other states, from
Colorado and Oregon, Texas and Alabama, Cali-
fornia and Georgia, Pennsylvania, New York and
New Jersey. All are single.

How were they chosen?

22

“Not for scholastic standing alone — although
that's extremely important,” says Mills. “Our interest
is in the man who has been active on the campus and
a success at summer jobs as well as a good student.
\/Ve choose the all-around man because he adapts well
to the entirely new way of life we’re offering him”.

Creole regards a first assignment to Venezuela as
a challenge to a young American graduate because
he will perform duties for which he has been edu-
cated, but in an environment for which he has prob-
ably not been prepared although the company makes
up for that with intensive on—the-iob training.

All American employees, whether craftsmen, tech-
nical or supervisors, are required to help train Ven-
ezuela workers in safe and efficient work methods.
Supervisors often find it necessary to do work normal-
ly assigned to craftsmen in the States due to lack of
sufficient trained assistants and in order to demon-
strate methods for the proper performance of the
work.

Successful job performance, Creole veterans

counsel, will require patience, persistance, ability to
improve and an understanding of the Venezuela
workman. .
. “Like any oil company, we’re in business for prof-
it, says Mills. “But we do it through a sensible
working partnership with ,the people and go\ ernment
of Venezuela. Our relations with our Venezuelan em-
ployees and the communities in which we operate
are vitally important to our success.

“We want men who will accept the responsibil-
ities inherent in working in a friendly country for
our firm. Our people must never forget that their

company and their coun'try will be judged by their
individual attitudes and conduct. We seek employees
who give promise that they combine professional abil-
ity with a talent for “fitting into Venezuela.”

What can the 38 potential presidents expect
when they arrive in Venezuela?

A great deal, in Mills’ opinion:

One American who has successfully made the
transition is Roger Gregston, 28 a rising young man
in the field organization of Creole,, who has com-
pressed a great deal of experience into the six and
half years since he joined the company immediately
upon graduation in 1948. "

A whole new technique had to be developed for overwater drilling on
Lake Maracaibo. At La Salina, Creole's industrial base, can be seen
the fruit of this technique——concrete piles, 196 feet long and weighing

Creole Oil

A tall, brown-haired petroleum engineer, he is,
like so many Americans in the oil industry in Ven-
ezuela, a Texan. Gregston was born in lvanhoe,Texas,
on l\/larch 26, 1927. He studied first at Texas Tech-
nological College, holding down a variety of summer
vacation jobs to help to pay for his schooling, which
he completed at Stanford University. He went straight-
away to Venezuela.

continued from page 23

Creole’s production operations there are handled
in two divisions — one in the western part of the
country and one in the east. Gregston now is station-
ed in the Eastern Division, as chief of the petroleum
engineering group of the Quiriquire district. But
his formative years in the industry were spent in the
Western Division, site of fabulous Lake Maracaibo.
one of the most prolific sources of oil in the world.

During his first two years, he was assigned to the
lake and to two oil camps in that area, Mara and
Alturitas. It was after this tour of duty that he re-
turned to the U. S. on his first home leave and mar-
ried a girl from Lubbock, Texas. He went back to
Venezuela with his bride, and they settled down in
the Western Division.

From late 1950 until October, 1953, Gregston
worked in the Lagunillas and Bachaquero camps, ac-
quiring broad experience in all phases of field work.
Creole policy is to train employees in as many of its
complex operations as possible, so that they have a
comprehensive knowledge of the company’s work.
Gregston was at different times in the drilling pro-
duction, materials-equipment and cost control. depart-
ments providing him with a well—rounded back
ground.

Like all American who go to work for Creole in
Venezuela, Gregston was given intensive instructions
in the Spanish language as one of his first assign-
ments. It is a cardinal point of company policy that
all Americans should speak and understand Spanish.
Gregston took to Spanish with great facility and he
now speaks it fluently. He also adapted himself in this
early period to Venezuela customs and Venezuela way
of living, a highly importance factor in the success of
Americans who work and live in that country.

The Western Division experience ended in Nov-
ember, 1953, when he was transferred to the San
Joaquin camp, his first assignment in the East. At
San Joaquin, he was chief of petroleum engineering
and also received some training in management, when
he served for several months as assistant superinten-
(lent.

The technical experience acquired at San Joaquin
fitted him for another step up the ladder, and in
January of this year he was named to the job that
he now holds. In this post, he supervises the work of
16 petroleum engineers and six clerical employees.

Life in an oil camp can be somewhat constrain-
ing because it is a self-contained unit, established
usually far from any metropolitan center. It has
none of the sophisticated attractions of city life, but
it does offer ample opportunity for the development
of hobbies and other leisure time interests.

The problem of what to do with their spare
time has never been a major one for the Gregstons
because they have assiduously developed such inter-
ests. Raised on a farm, he has always felt a gravitat-
ional pull to the soil, and he and his wife have spent
many hours at every camp where they have lived in
working on the garden around their home. They

are both interested in photography, a pastime that is
both time-consuming and satisfactory in its results.
Another activity that furnishes relaxation and fun is
fishing, Gregston’s favorite week-end recreation.

The club is the social center of any camp, serving
as an after-work gathering place and as the scene for
movies, dances and parties. The Gregstons have al-
ways participated fully in the social life of the camp.
They have a keen interest in the flora and fauna of
the land where they live and they have used their
car to a maximum in exploring the countryside near
their camps.

The Gregston’s only child, James Roger, three,
was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second city, which
has mushroomed with the expansion of oil opera-
tions on the Lake. With his home established in Ven-
ezuela where his small son was born, Gregston "has
started to put roots down in the country.

However, there are stronger ties that bind him
to the Lone Star State. He plans to work in Venezuela
until his retirement, and then go back to the farm
which he has bought in Texas since going to work
for Creole.

So the Gregstons lead a full and satisfying life,
they enjoy their assignment in the oil camps and

they think Venezuela is a pretty nice place in which
to live and work.

to storage until the operation is completed. This is
similar to the way we solve an arithmetic problem

Control - the calculations and routing of the fac-
tors are performed under the direction of a “control"
or program unit. This unit gets its instructions, one
at a time, from their locations in storage. It executes
each instruction until the entire problem is com-
pleted. Each instruction not only specifies the func-
tional operation which is to be performed; it also
gives one or more addresses of the factor or factors
to be operated on and the addresses of the factor or
factors to be operated on and the address where the
result is to be stored.

Although there are specific cases where only one
of the two types of computers can be used, it is well
to speak of a comparison of the two machines. Ana-

devices requiring simulation of real time. Digital
machines are capable of megacycle fast and more ac-
curate solutions than analogue machines. The basic
unit of a digital computer is restricted to the funda-
mental arithmetic operations and transfer whereas
the analogue computer utilizes basic units capable
of not only these but evaluation of monotomic func-
tions, differentiation and integration. As to size, the
digital unit is many times greater than the size of
one analogue unit, but the latter must have a separate
unit for each and every basic operation. The inher-
ent speed of one digital unit appreciably exceeds the
speed of one analogue unit, but an analogue system
consists of more units. Analogue computers are in-

fer unlimited precision. In accuracy, digital units

manufacturers
grow

Today the interdependence between
manufacturer and supplier is stronger
than ever in the history of American
business. For in the challenging new
age of electronics, hundreds upon hun-
dreds of component parts are needed
in the manufacture of new products.

For example, the superb new RCA
Victor 21-inch color TV set shown here
contains 2,070 parts. These are made
by 600 different suppliers, most of
whom are small businesses.

Indeed, more than three-quarters of
all RCA suppliers are small business
ﬁrms that receive nearly one-half of
RCA’s purchasing dollars. They, in
turn, have their suppliers of raw mate-
rials. Thus through a long line of co-
operative effort, employment is pro-
vided for countless people in many
ﬁelds—and an entire economy beneﬁts.

RCA salutes its full roster of 7,500
suppliers, located in 43 states, for their
inventiveness and resourcefulness that
contribute so much to the quality
and performance of its products. With
these ﬁrms at our side, RCA continues
to march forward, creating new and bet-
ter “Electronics for Living”-—-electron-
ics that make life easier, safer, happier.

G-E Makes Diamonds
In The Laboratory

Man-made diamonds, the cli-
max to a 125 year effort to dupli-
cate nature's hardest and most
glamorous substance, l1ave been
produced by scientists of the Gen-
eral Electric Research Laboratory
at Schenectady, New York.

The scientists recently exhib-
ited tiny diamonds made from a
carbonaceous material subjected to
extreme pressures and tempera-
tures. The largest stone measured
1/16 of an inch in its longest di-
mension.

G. E. officials warned that “any
conclusion we are about to make
diamonds of a size and quality
suitable for gem use is decidedly
premature.”

The primary application of
man-made diamonds will probably
be in industrial tools for cutting
and polishing. The crystals are not
“imitation” or diamond-like. They

have been positively indentified by
X-ray inspection, chemical examin-

ation, and hardness tests. These
diamonds can scratch anything,
even other diamonds. Thus they
are the first man-made substance
to scratch other diamonds.

In the process, a carbonaceous
compound was subjected for many
hours to a measured pressure some
53,500 times greater than atmos-
pheric (roughly 800,000 pounds per
square inch). This pressure is
roughly equivalent to the“squeeze”
physical scientists have (omputed
for points 240 miles beneath the
earth's surface.

THOW PROPER DESIGN
CAN lOWER COSTS

oWhen you design properly for steel
construction, your products will always
cost less to manufacture. Because steel is
two to three times stronger than cast
iron, and 21/2 times as rigid, fewer pounds
of metal are needed. Also, each pound
of material costs a third as much.

Here, for example, is a base for a ma-
chine tool. As a casting it would cost
$875 to build, weigh 4900 lbs. By prop-
er design in steel, it costs only $536.
Although it weighs 2400 pounds less,
the steel design is actually 45% more
rigid to hold important alignment of
the bed ways.

other reciprocating engines. Diesel engines had a
high percentage of work output in proporton to fuel
consumpton. Fire as the result of the crash of a diesel
powered plane was almost impossible. A fire could
break out only if the engine continued to run at
wide-open throttle with fuel oil pouring directly over
the exhaust flame. Another advantage of the diesel
was that it could operate at full power with only a
brief warm-up period. The diesel engine did cost
more initally in comparison to horsepower with the
gasoline engine, but with greater operating efficiency
and economy, the difference was offset under long
continued service.

Oxygen boosting at takeoff was used satisfactorily

for takeoff than for normal flight. Twenty gallons

approximation formulas. Most experts agree, too,
that the probability of improvements for analogue
computers is rather low while digital computers are
still in their infancy.

The development of computers and data hand-
ling systems has reached a point where it may bring
about a revolution in business machine methods with-
in the next decade. Evolution of using electronic
computer systems from purely scientific means to
modern commercial applications in the business ma-
chine field has culminated in the production of a
series of electronic data handling systems ranging
from “giant brains” to computers which can perform
the most complex calculations in a fraction of the
time required by manual means. The basic value of
electronic computer systems lies in the accuracy of
electronic devices and their tremendous savings in
manpower and time. These are essential factors in
meeting standards required for gearing up national
defense mobilization requirements for years to come.
It is said that modern business could not meet its
increasing overall responsibilities for speeding up pro-
duction and distribution without the aid of electronic
computer devices. The trend toward developing elec-
tronic computers for smaller business concerns may
revolutionize business methods and procedures.

Great steps are being made in automation of
standard accounting procedures. Successors of pres-
ent machines will affect radical changes in data pro-
cessing procedures employed by hundreds of large
business organizations. These machines, capable of
performing ten million operations in one hour, using
electrostatic storage, under the direct supervision of
one person, can be rented for about $25,000 a month.

Phenomenal performance records of electronic
computers are being set every day Probably the most
famous of these machines are Remington Rand’:
UNIVAC and IBM’S NORC. UNIVAC was used to
predict 1952's presidential elections and produced
spectacular results. There are several now in use
across the country. They are being used for general
accounting, cost accounting, data, and more clerical

functions but eventual uses include complication of
statistics and preparation for market forecasts. It
must be remembered though, that applications are
unlimited. Work which previously took weeks can
now be done in minutes at great savings.

The Naval Ordinance Research Calculator,
NORC, is belived to be the smartest electronic brain
ever built. Using the decimal system, it has amazing
speed and capacity in solving vital defense problems,
some requiring millions of computations. The ma-
chine exceeds design specifications. In put is by mag-
netic tape, storage by cathode ray tubes. It produces
printed records at the rate of 18,000 characters a
minute - equivalent to the output of seventy typists.

These and today's other computers are the out-
growth of electronic developments during World War
II. A primary peacetime function of the machines
is seen in both military and civil aircraft. Data from
radar is fed into computers and serves as an aid in
navigation and landing safely under conditions of

INDUSTRIES
THAT MAKE
AMERICA GREAT

RUBBER . . .
BOUNCING HIGHER
AND HIGHER

Rubber, natural and synthetic, is so elastic
in its applications to daily living that mil-
lions of people ride on it, walk on it, sit
on it, sleep on it——in fact, use it in more than 80,000 differ-
ent products. 1,498,906 tons were consumed in 1953 alone.
This industry’s remarkable growth (U.S. consumption of
2,419,700 tons, or 27.7 pounds per person, is forecast for
1960) is largely due to management’s wisdom in reinvesting
proﬁts in the tools of production and distribution to en-
courage company growth.

Anyone whose memory goes back 10 years or more can
remember the heroic efforts of the rubber companies by
which they averted a serious wartime rubber shortage which
threatened both military transport, and family transporta-
tion. The phenomenal gains made by the rubber industry in
the last decade have met civilian demands and have provided
an emergency stockpile as well.

And in this history of rubber research, development and

 

growth, steam has made—and is making—a basic contribu-
tion. Without steam and its teammate power, many of the
accomplishments of rubber would have been more diﬁicult,
impracticable or even impossible to attain.

B&W, through its own vast program of research and
development, coupled with boiler building experience dating
back almost a century, has made major contributions of its
own to the science of steam generation for processing, power
and heat—and through them to the modern-day marvels of
rubber.

poor visibility. Airbome problems such as flight
control and release are also solved and applied to
automatic control systems while the craft is in flight.

Theoretically, machines can be built to do any-
thing. The key to design is repetition and_ consis-
tency. Machines of this type, which wer first ap-
plied to arithmetic, are now sovling guided missile
trajectory problems. Early computers first won ac-
claim for outstanding operations like predicting the
position of the moon for the next several hundred
years.

New developments for the machines consist prim-
arily of the betterment of storage components. A
magnetic drum idea has been in use for several years.
This consisted of nothing more than a drum onto
which was wrapped sensitized tape. Its main disad-
vantage is, that although fast in itself, it_ is for some
calculations, too slow. Where information must 
“memorized" and used instantaneously, electrostatic
storage is used. This consists of a television-type,
cathode ray tube. A series of dots and dashes, repre-
senting numbers, are recorded in the form of elec-
trical charges on the face of one tube. The size of
the storage component now only depends on the
number of these tubes. Stored data can be called to
use in a few millionths of a second. Up to 20,000
decimal digits can be stored on each tube ‘lace. Im-
provements are also being made in the input and
output media where at present, magnetic tape 1S used.
In design, new approaches are also possible in control,
organization and flexibility.

MAY I955

Today's computers are marvels of the electronic
world. They have come a long way in their short
existence. But the picture is just beginning. The
machines at present must be fed all instructions to
complete a problem. If some instruction is omitted,
the machine is stumped. Far from being “super-
brains” they will do only what they’re told. If you
forget, they’re helpless.

The modern, high speed automatic computer is
serving to extend engineering skills by allowing much
more to be done in the areas of theoretical investi-
gations, thus reducing the amount of cut and try ef-
fort, and appreciably shortening the elapsed time
between the accepting of an idea and the marketing
of a product.

Diesel Aircralil:

fuel and high rate of thermal efficiency. The exhaust
temperature of the diesel was 1000 degrees Fahrenheit,
while gasoline powered engines were as high. as 1600
degrees. With this comparatively low exhaust tem-
perature, the diesel engine could use an exhaust gas
driven supercharger. The gasoline engine super-
charger was completely gear driven thereby using
valuable engine power. A diesel engine, utilizing a
gear driven supercharger would only increase the
horsepower from 310 to approximately 400.

continued from page 35

In 1940, the United States perfected a nine cyl-
inder air-cooled diesel aviation engine. It was a
Guiberson with 310 horsepower at 2150 _rpm, averag-
ing 2.1 pounds per horsepower. This light and econ-
omical engine was accepted by the War Department,
but the only action it saw was during World War II
in tanks.

\Vhen the United States entered the Second
\/Vorld War, the need became more urgent for a light,
fast, durable fighter to compete with the _]apanese
Zero and the Messerschmitt 109. In 1942, the prob-
lem in Europe was solved by England with her Spit-
fire. In the Pacific, the Curtis P-40, Lockheed P-38
and Bell P-39 did not prove to be so effective. The
need for maneuverability in fighter planes helped
in the final elemination of the diesel aircraft engine.
The power and range required by heavy bombers was
also too great for the diesel engine to produce within
the weight limits of the gasoline engine.

Germany abandoned the diesel aviation engine in
the late l930’s to concentrate on jet engines. They
knew then that the coming air war did not have a
place for the diesel engine. They made use of one
diesel principle in their gasoline engines by using
direct injection of gasoline into the cylinder thus do-
ing away with heavy carburetors. This was a com-
mon practice in German military aircraft engines in
1942.

As World War II progressed, the diesel aviation
engine, which was to have been the greatest recipro-

Conrad's party was a roaring suc-

were no napkins. The store was
sold out of paper ones and the lin-

there was going to be an electron,
so he went to the poles and volted.

The human brain is wonderful.
It starts right in working the mom-

A young lady wearing a long
mink coat went to a dice table in
Las Vegas and insisted on betting
$1000. She overcome the objection
that it was over the house limit and
was given the dice to roll.

She took off her coat, revealing
complete nudity. She rolled the
dice once, rolled them again, and
said, “I made it.” She collected her
winnings, put her coat on and left.
“By the way,” one of the house

men asked the other, “what was
her point?”

He shrugged, “I didn’t notice
either.”

“You down there,” shouted fa-
ther from the head of the stairs,
“It is two-thirty, do you think you
can stay all night?”

“Er, thank you,” said the M E
Romeo, "But I will have to phone
home first.”

At a fashionable wedding recent-
ly, the groom noticed that one of
the guests looked rather glum.
“Have you kissed the bride?” he
asked by way of cheering the
gloomy one up.

“Not lately," replied the guest
with a far-away look in his eyes.

You're only young once! After
that you have to think up a new
excuse.

A beautiful girl was walking a-
long the sidewalk one evening on
her way to the movie. She noticed
a small bird laying at the side of
the walk with a broken wing. In-
stead of going to the movie, she
took the bird home, bandaged its
wing, and fed it. In a week the
bird was well enough to fly away.

Now let's see you guys find any-
thing dirty in that.

a message to the graduates

A few weeks ago, an “alum” stopped by the office
and asked if any back issues for the past year were
available. We were, of course, glad to lend him a help-
ing hand but, out of curiosity, we asked why he want-
ed the old magazines. His answer gave us one more
good reason to hold our heads high.

44

He told us that his fellow-workers were always
bragging about the colleges from which they had
graduated, but that he, being a salesman on the road
most of the time, didn’t have many opportunities to
do the same about Pitt. Then one day, he happened
to pick up a copy of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.
The “Half Way Up the Hill” photos and Dean
Fitterer’s page made him realize the tremendous
strides that the Engineering School is making. He
immediately saw a surefire way to remind the fellows
at work that they were not the only ones whose
schools were worth praising.

Our friend simply decided to leave a few copies
of the SKYSCRAPER lying around the office. Now
every time one of his co-workers picks up our maga-
zine, the SKYSCRAPER does our alum’s bragging
for him.

a valuable asset and memento of your college days.

1955-Loading Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter

There’s plenty of variety in Boeing engineering careers

America’s pioneer passenger-cargo air-
craft, the 40A, was a Boeing. So is the
Air Force’s versatile tanker-transport, the
C-97 Stratofreighter shown above.

During the company’s 38-year history,
Boeing engineers have blazed new trails
in the design of aerial freighters and
tankers, commercial airliners, flying
boats, ﬁghters, trainers and bombers. To-
day Boeing continues to offer engineers
a wide variety of opportunities in Re-
search, Design and Production.

Students sometimes are surprised that
Boeing's engineering staff includes those
with civil, electrical, mechanical, aero-
nautical and other engineering degrees.
Yet all ﬁnd application in aviation. For

example, the civil engineer may work on
airframe structure or stress. Electrical
engineers ﬁnd challenge in the compli-
cated electrical and electronic systems of
modern jet bombers and guided missiles.
Other engineers will find similar applica-
tion for their talents.

The high degree of stability in careers
at Boeing is reflected in this chart.

Ye-M! 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%

SIIIIBC

20+

 

It shows that 46% of Boeing engineers
have been with the company five or more

years; 25% for 10 or more years, and 6%
for 15 years.

Boeing promotes from within, holds
regular merit reviews to assure individual
recognition. Engineers are encouraged to
take graduate studies while working and
are reimbursed for all tuition expense.

Current Boeing programs include: six
and eight jet bombers; America's first jet
transport—the 707; F-99 Bomarc pilot-
less interceptor (guided missile)—and
advanced projects such as the application
of nuclear power to aircraft.
