The University of Pittsburgh and AT&T Information
Systems have entered into a three year open—ended
agreement concerning the installation and development
of a fiber—optics communication network on campus.
This agreement will not only bring about new ways for
the transmission of data, but it will also bring about new
academic programs in the university. AT&T will also be
able to test technological advances in communication
equipment. The system will encompass many parts of
the university including Hillm'an Library, the dormitories,
the present Remote Job Entry (RJE) sites and various other
locations. The network will be expandable to virtually any
part of the campus. The Provost's office will soon decide
to which locations the system will be connected.

Most of us have heard the claim that information can
be transmitted through hair—thin fibers. This is made
possible through fiber optics. This relatively new
technology is the basis for Pitt's so called ”information
revolution.” The amazing quality of fiber optics is the
ability to transmit hundreds of times more information
than conventional wire cables. Even more remarkable is
that this can be done for substantially less money.

Pitt's system will utilize a crosspoint switching system
whose logic will be performed by microprocessors. This
system will differ from a telephone station because it will
employ two different types of wires as opposed to the
te|ephone’s two copper wire method. This system will
use one copper wire and one light fiber. The use of light
fiber will enable more data to be transmitted and faster
transmission of data than was previously possible.

The laser was first introduced in 1960. It opened up
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum whose frequen-
cies were 10,000 times higher than those used in radio
communications. This sparked an interest in lightwave
communications which has led to our present-day fiber
optics technology. This technology involves generating
light signals which are dispatched over glass fibers in
pulses. The light signals are generated by tiny solidstate
light sources. A schematic view of the optical fiber which
carries the light signal is shown in Figure 1. Part 3, the

Lﬁgjﬂnit Fﬁtoetre

shaded portion of the fiber, is the outer polymeric
coating. Its function is to keep unwanted light out while
keeping the pulse signal in. It also protects the glass from
stress which would normally cause it to break. Part 2,
the glass cladding, funnels light back to the center glass
core, part 1.

There are three different methods of constructing an
optical light fiber to transmit a light pulse. The simplest
fiber is known as a step-index fiber. It is based on a basic
optical principle. When a beam of light strikes the
boundary between two materials of different densities
at a suitably low angle, the light is fully reflected back
into the denser material. The step-index fiber has a dense
core. Therefore, when light enters the outer glass clad-
ding, it reflects toward the higher density core. It will
proceed through the core and toward the cladding on
the other side. It will once again reflect back toward the
core. In this manner, the light pulse will zigzag through
the optical fiber.

l

..
!

Mr. Dave Forejt will coordinate the AT&T project for Pitt.

The transit time of the step-index fiber is high, which
reduces its capacity to carry information. This problem
is solved using a graded—index fiber. in this type of fiber
the density of the glass gradually increases from the
outer cladding into the core. This produces a more
smoothly curving path which is similar in length to the
zigzag path of the step-index fiber. However, with this
construction the signal travels in lower density regions
which reduces the transit time.

The final solution is the most efficient. It is called the
monomode fiber. This method reduces the size of the
core to approximately the wavelength of transmitted light
which is about two to eight micrometers. This produces
a straight line which vastly decreases the transit time. The
monomode fiber has the mind boggling capability to
carry 40,000 conventional television channels over a one
kilometer distance.

Fiber optics is not completely free of disadvantages.
First of all, glass can't expand and stretch nearly as well
as copper. This is mostly alleviated by the outer
polymeric coating. Secondly, there are two distinct prob-
lems in light transmission, absorption and scattering. The
principal cause of absorption is impurities in the glass.
The glass must be made so accurately that one could see
through it clearly for over 32,000 feet. This degree of
purity cannot be obtained through the standard heating
process. It must be realized using the vapor—deposition
process. This technique reacts high-purity vapors of
silicon and germanium to produce layers of glass. The
other drawback, scattering, is a change in a light wave
caused by a change in the density of the transmitting
medium. These irregularities can be controlled fairly
effectively in the manufacturing process.

Some of the advantages of fiber optics such as high
capacity and small size are innately obvious. However,
it has other more subtle advantages as well. Optical fibers
are not subject to electrical noise in theenvironment.
Light is tightly confined, so signals don't leak between
different fibers. One of the greatest advantages is
ultimately expected to be monetary. As of now, the tech-
nology is new and not readily available for commercial
interests. This brings about -a high price. In the future,
competition and experience are expected to greatly
alleviate the financial burden.

Fiber optics seems destined to supplant our present
day information carrying system. It is cheaper and more
efficient, so it would seem to be just a matter of time
before it becomes our communication system. The
University of Pittsburgh is taking the opportunity to be
at the forefront of this information revolution. The future
seems bright as Pitt takes a bold step into the future.

What really lies ahead in Pitt's Computer future? The
answer to this question lies in the hands of Mr. Dave
Forejt who will be in charge of the new system being in-

Westinghouse R&D center where he was a manager of
a group that was working on computer and network
services. He also coordinated the other groups at
Westinghouse that were working in a similar field. The
university was fortunate to obtain the services of an in-
dividual with Mr. Forejt’s qualifications. With him in
charge of the AT&T project, this endeavor seems
destined for success.

The project will no longer confine a terminal to one
system. One will no longer go into an RJE site and see
half the terminals marked Vax while the other terminals
are denoted for DEC 10 use only. With the new system,
anyone will be able to log onto the network from a
terminal and then will be able to select any one of the
computer systems on campus that will be accessible with
the network (i.e. DEC A, Vax 1, Vax 2, etc.). Other
improvements will be noted in the area of graphics. At
present the equipment used to create plots and graphs
has to be relatively close to the main unit of the
computer. Once this system is in effect, graphic terminals
or devices can be located all over the campus. Another
innovation stemming from this network will be full
motion video. A person will be able to attach to the
system and then request to see a lecture previously
stored by their professor on the system. This full motion
video will have many applications in the future from
helping a student review past lectures to having instruc-
tional lessons allowing a student to increase his
knowledge in areas of interest to him.

The AT&T project is currently in the final evaluation
stages. The needs of the university along with the most
efficient ways to meet these needs must be formulated

before the physical renovation of Pitt's computer system
takes place. It is expected that by midyear much of the
system's new equipment will be installed around the
campus. By the end of the year, we can expect to begin
benefitting from this system. We will be able to ex-
perience a small portion of the large power this network
will give us. Exactly what we will be able to do and where
work will begin will be decided within the next few
weeks of the evaluation process.

Once the total renovation is complete, it is hoped
that a user will not only have access to Pitt's computing
facilities but will also have access to other universities’
computer systems. Pitt's regional campuses will also be
included in the system and will have a direct hook up
to all of Pitt's computing systems.

Faculty from throughout the university will be work-
ing with this system to exchange and manipulate a wide
variety of information. The applications of this system
should benefit all members of the university. The plan
includes equipping dorm rooms with jacks so that per-
sonal computers can simply be plugged in, thereby giv-
ing students easy access to the computer system. The
jack will be designed so that either a phone or a com-
puter can be connected to it. In order to make it even
easier for a student to access the computer system, plans
are being made so that students will be able to rent per-
sonal computers from the university. This will allow many
more people to have greater access to the computer
system. Pitt's plans for the future seem to have many
applications, yet the abundance of uses for such a
computer system is only now coming‘ into focus.

This is the present predicament in the Old Engineering Hall

Remote Job Entry Center, but the new system will eliminate the problem.

 

Thoughts on Technology:

can What We Know Hurl‘ Us?

by Deborah Burks, John C. Gargani and Joe Samosky

Recently, three self-proclaimed philosopher-
engineering students gathered late on a cold winter
evening to discuss the possible dangers posed by
modern science and technology. After two preliminary
meetings, the three met and recorded eighty minutes of
carefully crafted debate. This article is a condensation of
that dialogue and highlights the main topics discussed. A
broad range of subjects is addressed, since the questions
in the discussion involve many philosophical, ethical and
scientific issues. In order to protect the guilty, the authors
have adopted the pseudonyms Andros, Sagredo, and
Helvetia. The authors do not purport to speak with
authority, but rather wish to stimulate further questions
and ideas among our readers.

Sagredo: Good evening, Andros.

Andros: Well, hello Sagredo. How are you?

5: I'm quite fine. And you, Helvetia?

Helvetia: O.K.

S: You know, Andros, I've been thinking quite a lot
lately about all of this science and technology. I'm
wondering if perhaps man might be headed for more
trouble than benefit if he continues on his present
course.

A and'H: No!

A: Well, explain, Sagredo.

S: It seems that for the first time in man's history the
fruits of his technology have the capability to seriously
and permanently damage both his environment and
society.

A: Is it the first time though?

S: It seems so on a wide scale, yes. Look at the
hazards posed by nuclear technology and genetic
engineering. Also, we increasingly rely on a network of
computing systems which are vulnerable to sabotage or
attack.

A: I disagree on the idea that this is the first time
in history for such a situation. Today we view the world
as the whole globe, but it can also be considered as that
part of the Earth of which you know. The Mediterranean
Sea was the world to the Romans. What could have been
more fragile than supply lines which stretched for
thousands of miles when your navy was terrible?

H: But the technology was not posing the threat;
rather, the threat was a breakdown in the technology.
This is why I disagree with you, Sagredo, when you gave
the example of the computer network. Fragile tech-
nology has been around for a long time, unlike bombs,
which haven't. When cities were first built, for example,
food had to be brought into the cities and water supplies
had to be controlled. If this wasn't done, the city was
in big trouble.

S: O.K., but we find ourselves in a situation where
more than ever before in our history, the common man
is affected by technology and more than ever before the
common man has virtually nothing to say about what it
is that affects him.

A: Definitely. Any time that something directly
affects a person's life and of which he has no control is
dangerous.

H: I agree, since then a lot of power is put into a
few people's hands and other people do not know
enough to understand what is going on.

A: I think it must be considered that the people in
power are looking for what's good in the short term, not
the long term. They are looking to see how to get re-
elected. The process of re-election is in itself probably
the greatest limitation in what governments or corpora-
tions can do.

H: However, doesn't it seem that the common man
might know of dangers too late with technology today
advancing at an ever increasing rate?

A: But the people in power want to stay in power
forever. It's too late to correct what has already been
done, but it's not too late to correct what might happen.

S: O.K. We have been talking up to this point about
technology in pretty vague terms. Possibly at this point
we should make a distinction between science and tech-
nology. As I see it, science is an exploration of the
universe, an attempt to discover truths about the world
by the scientific method. This consists basically of obser-
vation of nature, proposition of hypotheses explaining
what we see, the conduction of experiments to see if we
can make predictions and, if those predictions are
correct, then the adoption of ideas as being descriptions
of nature. That whole process, inquiry, testing, retesting,
rejection or acceptance of ideas, constitutes the way that

we learn about the world. That's essentially what science
is; whereas technology is more the application of those
ideas and that method to specific problems. Or not just
to specific problems but . ..

A: . . . directed toward specific gain.

H: That's how I feel.

S: We can always say that technology is the practical
application of science, but what does that really mean?
Scientists can certainly pursue a goal for some gain or

advancement. When does science become technology?
A: Any research is science.

H: Then you have to distinguish between different
types of science. There is the science of learning about
the nature of materials and there is the science of learn-
ing how to build a better bomb. To me they are very
different types of science.

S: I disagree that any research is science. I think that
some research is quite clearly technology. I believe that
this is where we can start talking about control and limits
and restraints. There is certainly research that I feel
should be restrained. For instance, research on how to
torture people, or perhaps even research in nuclear
weapons construction. Certainly more money and time
are currently being spent on research in military tech-
nology than ever before, and I don't think that very many
scientists would say such research is science, at least in
the traditional sense.

A: What would you have considered the Manhattan
Project to be?

S: It would be technology, since I think that they
were less concerned with discovering nature than they
were with building a bomb. Certainly a vast knowledge
of the atom was gained as a result of work that happened
after the Manhattan Project. That was the start of the
great spurt toward nuclear energy. But a project like that
was directed specifically at making a bomb, a destruc-
tive device to kill people. Perhaps the project made con-
tributions to science, but the project as a whole certainly
wasn't science.

A: So then it seems to me that any pursuit towards
a goal could be considered technology and any
knowledge gained from that pursuit would be science.
Does that sound reasonable?

5: No! No! Because it is certainly possible to pursue
things in science. Watson and Crick pursued very
specifically the structure of the DNA molecule.

A: Why did they pursue it?

S: I don't know. Watson needed the money from the
Nobel Prize, maybe he had just got married . . . (laughter)

A: Who paid for their work then?

S: I imagine it was some sort of government agency.

H: There are past experiences which show that
knowledge might have future applications.

S: Certainly science often discovers obscure things
which later have a profound impact on and benefit
society.

A: With that reasoning, how can you consider
limiting or restricting science?

S: If the pursuit of scientific endeavor poses any
immediate danger, I think that then you can limit it. You

 

are risking not discovering something that could be
useful later, but I think’that this risk is acceptable if what
you are doing could lead to major damage now.

H: Are you talking about the possible risks from
applications of science or the risks from accidents?

5: No, even the risks from learning about an area.
The risks of accidents, yes. But perhaps even the risks
of learning about a certain area.

H: The risks of accidents is a lot different from the
risks from applications.

5: Right, in the sense of limiting science, I'm refer-
ring to the risks from accidents, since applications would
refer to technology.

A: Would it be best to say that we should limit
method rather than pursuit? We could pursue any idea
that we want, but we have to be limited in what method
we are using to prevent dangerous circumstances.

S: You stated before that ideas shouldn't be limited,
that science shouldn't be limited.

H: I think that we should say that it is the propaga-
tion of the thought, not the thought iself, that should
be controlled.

S: Yes.

A: Right. Limiting the application of a thought . . .
O.K. I'll agree to that.

S: No, not just the application.

H: No, not the application.

S: We weren't going to let you slip that in, Andros.

A: Then how about the idea that government can
limit the propagation of a thought, if the thought in and
of itself is dangerous?

S: Who decides that?

A: That's the big question. It's the same question as

who decides (getting back to the topic) what is dangerou_s
science, what is dangerous technology. Helvetia and I
were talking about the idea of who can say that
technology is bad. The example that we were talking
about was saccharin. Saccharin, to a person who does
not use saccharin, doesn't mean anything. Then there
is a person who is a diabetic and has no choice but to
take saccharin for a sweetener. For such a person, it's
good. Finally, a person who takes both sugar and sac-
charin says, ”Well, I can have both. I'll take the sugar
because the saccharin is bad.” You get the whole range:
good, bad or neutral. Now how can you say a science
is bad? It is a very subjective choice.

H: What about the technology that government
wants to pursue? It may not be good for the people
either.

A: Also, you're talking about a government that is
supposed to be representing the ideas of the society,

right?
S: Well, the government essentially forms the
society.
A: Does it?
H: No.
A: Should it?

S; No. The people form the society, but the govern-
ment embodies the ideas of the society.

A: But you stated 40 minutes ago that the common
man does not for the most part understand the science.

H: I think that certain aspects of science are already
limited. Since the common man does not understand lots
of science, decisions are made for him. The FDA decides
which drugs we can take and what kind of drugs can be
made.

5: I'd like to discuss further the idea that science
might be limited if it poses some sort of direct danger,
in the same way that certain movements or the expres-
sion of certain ideas (rather than the ideas themselves)
might be limited to prevent widespread damage.

A: Then how do you define damage, destroying,
changing?

S: I would define serious harm to society as being
loss of life, or pain and injury to people.

A: Okay.

S: A lesser damage would be injury to property or
loss of function of that property. I would also consider
psychological damage a more serious harm.

A: It's called engineering education and you pay for
it.

H: That's the worst kind.

S: Science can even be limited indirectly because the
methods used to pursue that field of science should be
limited. This would include areas of research on human
beings.

A: Like the operations on the Jews in the death
camps.

S: Exactly. A different example is that much sexual
research wasn't done until the twentieth century because
of societal stigmas about what could and could not be
researched and talked about. In the same sense, if one
limits the means to research a field, one might also limit
the field itself. Suppose a government decides that a par-
ticular project in genetic engineering poses so many
potential risks that it should be banned. Then if there's
no other way of performing the experiment, such as a
computer simulation, you have limited an area of
science.

A: It should be such cases as this in which you're
talking about purely ethical or moral issues that the deci-
sions shouldbe up to the researcher or the company
doing the work.

S: Unless the research violates other societal laws.

A: But then again that would be the realm of ethics
and they would take care of it themselves.

S: Since when does a private corporation take care
of ethics? Ethics has always been the realm of law and
state.

A: You cannot legislate morality. That was proven
with prohibition.

5: That's correct if you mean ”morality” with a
religious connotation. But law is precisely the regulation
of ethics or morality in a civil sense.

Law legislates ethics, law determines that one cor-
poration can't accept a bribe from another corporation.
That's what law is for, to uphold ethical principles.

H: I don't like the idea of government regulating
someone’s ethics. I think that government should reflect
the ethics of the people.

S: When people disagree with or are at odds with
the ethics that are generally accepted by the society,
government will enforce the laws.

H: What is the purpose of laws? To enable people
to live together.

A: Right, to smooth the workings of the civilization.

S: To enable people to live together and benefit, to
prevent harm.

H: That's one reason why prohibition was a bad law.
They were trying to restrict an area of individual ethics

that didn't need to be restricted.
A: I think that was a case of the minority getting their

view across too strongly.

S: Perhaps, but then you're in the sensitive area of
what exactly is individual ethics. Does a government not
have a right to prosecute drunk drivers because that's
a personal decision of theirs? No, since they can kill other
people through their actions. Many personal decisions
affect other people when you get to the level of the cor-
poration. Since a decision made by the corporation does
affect so many other people, I think that the government
has a right to regulate those decisions.

H: But there's a difference between a corporation
and a person since a corporation doesn't have a
conscience.

A: A corporation is composed of people, how could
it not have a conscience?

H: Because of the motivations of the corporation.

A: Isn't the motivation of the corporation just the
motivation of the people that comprise it?

H: No.

A: Why do they work then?

H: To make money.

A: If that's the motivation of the people, then that's
the motivation of the company in the long run.

H: But the motivation of the people is to make
money for themselves.

A: Right.

H: For instance, if I work somewhere, I don't care
necessarily what the corporation's profit is.

A: Then I wouldn't consider you part of the
corporation.

S: At any rate, I see that we still have yet to adequate-
ly define the difference between science and technology.
It seems to me that science is more a process which pro-
duces knowledge, ideas and information, whereas tech-
nology produces hardware. Technology -applies the
information that results from science in order to develop
something physical.

A: Science in and of itself neither benefits nor hurts
man, but the technology that arises from science is what
benefits or hurts men.

S: Well yes, but within the constraints of what we
said before about accidents. Can knowledge hurt?

A: My brain hurts after class.

S: I'm not convinced that science can't sometimes
hurt. Well, how would you define the difference between
science and technology?

H: With science the pursuit is knowledge and infor-
mation, while with technology the pursuit is what can
be done with the information.

S: I made the distinction that technology is
something that makes or one manufactures. Technology
almost always seems to result in some sort of a product.

A: A benefit or a gain.

10

H: The person who is pursuing the technology
assumes the benefit or the gain.
5: So we can then say that the product of science

is knowledge, and that knowledge itself isn't good or bad
by the use of that knowledge takes on a value of "good"

or "bad."

A: We agree! By Zeus!

H: If the propagation of science leads to technology
which is sometimes bad, then perhaps we should limit
technology at that level, before it is too late.

S: What about broader issues in technological
ethics? We mentioned that a specific experiment in
genetic engineering might pose an unacceptable risk. But
certainly the discipline holds the promise of great benefit
to man as well.

A: That presents an interesting difference between
now and one hundred years ago. One hundred years ago
the most common limit to an offender would be
punishing someone for doing something wrong. Today
if you do something wrong, you may destroy, kill, or
wipe out the population of the earth. In such cases, it
is necessary to limit actions before tragedy occurs.

S: That's really difficult to do.

A: They should try to limit the scale on which it can
happen, though. If one hundred things are going to
develop into problems, you're not going to be able to
get all one hundred. You may be able to correct seventy-
five of them.

H: The problem is that you're not going to be able
to do that on a worldwide scale. You can only work

within the confines of your own government.
S: 50, when technology poses serious threats, in

what way can we respond? There are immediate local
dangers. Those seem to fall under a particular govern-
ments’ jurisdiction. There are agencies and systems that
exist to handle such cases.

H: It can often be handled today, but we don't know
what it will be like forty years from now.

S: But how can a government deal effectively with
the more widespread and pervasive effects of
technology. Technology now has the capability to land-
scape the environment as never before, and to landscape
the people as well through drugs and medical
technology.

A: And, as mentioned before, you could use
technology to correct the mistakes of technology.

S: That's certainly been done, but then who should
decide what is right and wrong in a technology? How
can that be best achieved? It appears to me that a govern-
ment has to be the authority, but the government has
to rely partially on the technologists to decide. Here's
the dilemma, then. We have a situation in which many
people are being affected by something that very few of
them understand. So there has to be a way to appoint
people to government who know the subject matter and
are capable of making informed decisions but yet are also
citizens in the sense that they are going to act in the
public interest.

A: I think that you first must find out what the
society actually wants; what's more important to them,

more jobs or a cleaner environment. Then you let the
scientists, the technologists look at what would result
from the technology, and then they can decide from that.
You need not even look at the technology itself, but
rather at the results of the technology. Compare that to
what society wants.

H: But what would be the technologists’ purpose?
To determine if technology is safe or if it is the kind of
technology we want?

5: Both.

H: You would want them to do both. Wouldn't the
purpose of experts be to tell you if it's safe and to pro-
vide you with options? I don't see how they can make
the choice of the options.

S: That's the situation ifyou have a choice between
options. But what happens when you have the situation
where a clear—cut choice doesn't exist for society? Say
that there is a chemical which has been developed —
a great new insecticide. It has been proven to be in-
credibly effective against a whole variety of pests which
had been plaguing midwestern agriculture. It turns out,
however, to be a very potent carcinogen. It isn't
absorbed in the food, but poses a serious threat to the
workers who would handle it. You have the farmers and
the agricultural community who have one perspective
and who aren't going to be directly harmed by the prod-
uct. They serve to benefit from it and, in fact, stand to
be harmed if it isn't used. You also have the smaller
group of people who may suffer direct harm from the
manufacture of the product and yet don't understand
it. The problem involves many groups with many dif-
ferent viewpoints. What can be done in this kind of situa-
tion in order to reach an equitable decision?

A: You can explain the effects of technology to
people. You can't necessarily explain why those effects
happen. If you explain that when a nuclear bomb ex-
plodes, "all these atoms are split and mass is converted
into energy” people won't care. But if you say "the whole
city is leveled and everyone dies within a five mile
radius”, they'll understand that.

H: Then we're saying that it's the job of the experts
to explain options, supposing that there are options.
However, there's so few scientists as compared to other

11

people. Furthermore, choice among the scientists is
limited since there may be few candidates available with
the specific qualifications necessary for a particular job.

S: That's true. I think that if there is a clear cut choice
to be made, then a technologist or scientist acting in an
advisory capacity to a government organization would
be a good option. In that case, the people could decide
the issue based on reasonably sound advice about what
the consequences would be. But what happens when we
just don't know enough about a situation? That also
seems to be a problem today. Certain areas of technology
promise tremendous benefits but pose a very serious
type of danger: the risk of long lasting harm. Radio-
activity, chemical carcinogens, genetic engineering, and
environmental pollutants all potentially could cause long
term damage to our world.

A: In that case you must measure the present danger
or the present crisis which is overcome by a particular
technology against the possible dangers that could
develop. Say there is some disease that has already killed
one third of Europe and is spreading to America. In that
case, you want to make sure that you get that genetic
research done to stop it from spreading any further. The
risk to future generations would be far overshadowed
by the present crisis.

S: In these cases, we're talking about widespread
harm that well could affect the rest of humanity. That's
a tremendous burden of responsibility to shoulder.
We're not only taking responsibility for ourselves, but
for future generations also.

H: But if you're aware of that responsibility, you
should then make decisions accordingly.

A: On the other hand, if it's a matter of guarantee-
ing your own survival, then I think you have to do it.

S: In those cases, it becomes even more crucial to
make decisions which are philosophically, scientifical-
ly, and ethically sound, and not, as much as possible,
influenced by short term political or economic interests.

H: But how often does a situation happen where

people are going to die without technology? What is the
purpose of most of today's genetic research anyway?

S: I think much is directed towards making drugs
or other organic compounds essentially the production
of natural production of natural products. Like Helvetia
said before, the fruits of science . . .

A: The fruits of science could be considered the diet
of technology.

H: I like that! That was mine!

S: Well, how about the military?

A: Son of a gun, I was just going to say that! I think
a question that arises concerning the military is: Who's
going to limit the limiter?

H: That is why I believe that an independent agency
should be set up to oversee such situations. Long terms
of office (like court judges) could free the agency from
day to day restrictions. In addition, its members could
choose some of its employees. Such an agency would
ultimately still be responsible to the government,
because that's where its money would come from.

A: That's still control, though.

H: Yes, but there are agencies now which are
somewhat independent of government, and therefore
politicians don't have a drastic influence on them, at least
on a short term basis.

A: Government isn't going to give up any of its
power. What if the FDA told the government to do
something that the government really did not want to
do? How could the FDA force the government to do it?

S: And what about weapons? That's clearly an ap-
plication of technology that can be viewed from many
different angles. The people in power seem to feel that
weapons are the preservers of society, whereas I per-
sonally feel that right now they are among the greatest
threats‘to our society.

A: As long as one country has a military, all of the
countries must have a military.

S: I'm not so much speaking about the military as
. . . well, let's say it nuclear weapons.

H: Do you think the government has any choice?

S: I'm not sure, but one of the things that especially
bugs me is that it seems so often that technologists and
technology are simply treated as some sort of
mechanistic process. If we want to develop a bomb, we
crank the handle and turn out a new bomb. All
throughout your engineering education, how much em-
phasis is placed on considering what you are doing with
what you're learning? A lot of people might think that
that's up to the individual. But let's face it, if alchemists
had had the knowledge that we do today, they would
probably have considered that sacred information. The
scientists and technologists of today are learning things
which are very powerful. They're learning how to con-
trol nature, and that's an extremely powerful and potent
knowledge. Along with that must be conveyed some
sense of responsibility for the use of that knowledge. I
think that that is one problem in engineering education,
at least from what I've seen. The attitude is often, "Get
your job, make your money, please your boss."

A: Does industry want us to think?

S: Probably not. No, they want well oiled machines.

H: But is industry dictating what is taught?

A: Yes, I think so. Go up to the 12th floor and see
all of the listings of contributors to the chemical
engineering department. Would you take chemical
engineering courses if you didn't think that you would
at least have a chance for getting a chemical engineer-
ing job?

H: My purpose in being a chemical engineer is not
to learn anything. I want to be an engineer, but I don't
want to learn any of it. I don't think anything that I'm
learning in engineering has much use to me outside of
being a chemical engineer.

A: So then, since you'll be working with industry,
industry should dictate what you should go into.

H: They dictate technical aspects, but I don't think
it's industry dictating what we take. I think it's the type
of job we want that dictates what we take. It's the respon-
sibility of the institutions to develop new programs for
the new types of jobs which are coming of age. It used

12

to be that most people went into a less technical, broader
education. I don't think the institutions have broadened
their means of teaching. They've become channelled into
the type of education that they have now, and they're
not always taking care of the students.

S: Something that seems ironic to me is that the
people who are learning the technology wind up being
perhaps less well equipped to deal with the problems
of that technology. Using technology becomes so
familiar to us, and yet we often haven't been made to
think about what we are doing with real things in the
real world.

H: They should combine engineering more with the
other disciplines of higher education.

S: It needn't even be a specific course, but perhaps
just an attitude. So many jokes are made about how
much money an engineer will make, or about doing
things to please management and advance one's posi-
tion in a corporation. You are taught to reason and to
solve problems, but you are not so much taught to think
about the problems. It's a different kind of thinking:
here's a problem, find a solution. I myself will sit down
at a problem and immediately start working at it. It
becomes almost a conditioned reflex. You don't look at
the problem and think, "Wait, does this need to be
solved? Is there something else to consider here?" Not
that this would necessarily apply to, say, a circuit prob-
lem or an integral. But the fact remains that engineering
education trains a mind in a mechanistic manner. See
this, do this, analyze these three cases. It's like a flow
chart to follow. You're not so much taught to look at new
approaches.

A: The outstanding engineers come up with the new
approaches anyway.

S: Yes, the outstanding engineers do. I hope it's the
exceptional ones that end up as the decision makers.

A and H: Conclusions!

A: Is class over yet? Well, we've presented a few
ideas — some liberal, some conservative, some unclear,
some vague. If there are any left over, they're ambiguous.

H: And there are some that are just incom-
prehensible.

S: Well, we have several choices for our ending. We
can say, "That about sums it up, I'm going to get back
to my calculus problem."

H: I think we should check the laundry.

S: What do you think the destiny of the human race
will be?

H: I'm a pessimist and an optimist. I think that we'll
continue on the trend to extrapolate knowledge to tech-
nological ends. Somehow we will manage to survive, but
we might regret it.

5: I think we'll continue to make mistakes; that
seems to be inevitable. It just worries me that the stakes
seem to be getting costlier.

H: Isn't it strange how we have more control than
ever before over our environment, but it seems like we
have less control over our control.

S: Well put, Helvetia, and to all a good night.

Books you may have missed

by Andrew Szeri

The Quiet American by Graham Greene is an
interesting novel of moral conscience set in Vietnam
during the early 1950's. Conflicts between realism and
idealism, experience and naiveté and the inhumanity of
war are all subjects dealt with in this book. The story con-
cerns a disinterested, cynical newspaper reporter named
Fowler who, despite his character, is drawn into taking
a monumental stand for what he thinks is right.

Being a reporter in Vietnam during the Korean war,
Fowler naturally has a lot of time on his hands. He is in-
terrupted infrequently by the highly propagandist
reports of the French and the Vietnamese skirmishes
with communists and others, but these Fowler tends to
ignore. He lives with a Vietnamese woman named
Phuong in one of the more Vietnamese sections of
Saigon, and his choice in these matters is indicative of
his general character. Fowler immerses himself in the
Vietnamese culture; he shies away from the press club
cocktail party atmosphere in which his colleagues wrap
themselves.

Though he is enchanted with the culture, Fowler
knows he is not a part of Vietnam. Through passing
observations (the book is written in the first person) we
gain insight into Fowler's view of the country: ”The
peasants in their hats like limpets winnowed the rice
against little curved shelters of pliated bamboo. The cars
drove rapidly by, belonging to another world.” Later, he
observes ”The last colors of sunset, green and gold like
the rice, were dripping over the edge of the flat world;
against the grey neutral sky the watch-tower looked as
black as print.”

13

Fowler meets a young, idealistic American named
Pyle who is attached to the economic mission at the U.S.
embassy. He is fresh from university and brimming with
the social and economic theories with which he intends
to change the world. Pyle’s faith in his theories becomes
dangerous because he develops an unthoughtout
ruthlessness in his desire to see them implemented.
Fowler takes him under his wing in order to show him
the complexity and privacy of the Vietnamese and their
situation, but Pyle only succeeds in falling in love with
Phuong. In a well crafted scene that is on the surface
cool but is fraught with tension underneath, Pyle
demands that Phuong choose between them. She
chooses to stay with Fowler.

Fowler is later informed by a Vietminh communist
that Pyle is in intelligence and is engaged in illegally im-
porting plastic explosives from the U.S.A. The explosives
are given to a rebellious member of the Vietnamese
military staff, General Thé, and his few thousand
followers, who are fighting for democracy (?) When
Fowler implicates Pyle in a series of small bombings he
is given a near sermon about the holiness of the fight
for democracy, regardless of how many mutilated Viet-
namese litter the path to this end. Still, Fowler refuses
to act.

The turning point comes a few weeks later, after
Phuong has been convinced by her sister to leave Fowler
for the younger, wealthier, more ambitious Pyle. Fowler
is sitting alone outside a café when one of, Pyle’s bombs,
which was meant for a hastily canceled military parade,
nearly kills him: ”A curious garden sound filled the cafe
— the regular drip of a fountain — and, looking at the
bar, I saw rows of smashed bottles which let out their
contents in a multi-colored stream — the red of porto,
the orange of cointreau, the green of chartreuse . . . A
woman sat on the ground with what was left of her baby
in her lap; with a kind of modesty she had covered it with
her straw peasant hat. She was still and silent, and what
struck me most about the square was the silence." It was
then that Fowler decided Pyle must be stopped.

Fowler contacted the Vietminh communist who had
informed him of the plastic explosives in the first place
and arranged to have Pyle killed if he couldn't be re-
formed with one last try. Pyle was more fervent than ever
in his naive schoolboy convictions when Fowler told him
of the incident in the square — the misery General The
had caused with Pyle’s ammunition. With great difficul-
ty but with a terrifying fatalism, Fowler gave the signal
to have Pyle murdered. The ending of the novel is stark
and powerful. We feel Fowler's loneliness in his decision.

Just A Gut Feeling

by Rebecca Marshall

Probably no other topic has been more done to
death in recent months than that of how close our society
is to the totalitarian one George Orwell describes in his
futuristic novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. Although these
essays have varied in content as well as quality, the theme
of technology, its uses and misuses, is one that runs
through all of them.

This very legitimate concern over where, to put it
badly, progress is leading us has been accompanied by
a questioning of the value of scientific arguments
themselves in judging technological issues. These
arguments have not been called into question by any
kind of debate, but rather by a lack of debate —— using
debate in its true sense as a well-ordered presentation
of facts and points of view.

The presentation of ”The Day After” on national
television last November provides an excellent example
of this new attitude. It not only dramatized where many
fear that technology will lead us, but also indicated, in
a subtle way, where the lack of true scientific debate may
point us as well.

I didn't like ”The Day After.” Perhaps I should say
instead that I disliked ”The Day After,” since I'm sure
that relatively few people actually ”liked” what they saw
in it. What disturbed me, however, was not so much the
devastating effects of nuclear war that the movie
/depicted, but the deliberately confusing way in which
it depicted them.

The most important element in good science-fiction
is good science; the principle holds even more true for
”scientific dramas” like ”The Day After” that involve less
extrapolation and invention than ordinary science-fiction.
And good science does not consist of simply accurate
facts, but of accurate facts and explanations. While the
events in ”The Day After” may have been based on scien-
tific theories and facts, scientific explanations for them
were almost totally absent.

Supporters of ”The Day After” will protest that such
added explanations would have turned the drama into
a documentary and ruined its emotional effect on the
audience. The confusion that the audience felt, they will
add, only made the movie more realistic, since that is
undoubtedly what the survivors of a real nuclear war
would feel. Moreover, the panel discussion that followed
provided interested viewers with ample expert opinions
on the topics presented.

These are valid points. The fact remains, however,
that the panel discussion was provided by the television
network, not by the creators of the movie. Otherwise
uninformed viewers who watched only the movie could
not evaluate the issues it raised rationally, but only
emotionally, which apparently is what its makers in-

14

tended. And here lies the most troubling question that
movies like ”The Day After” raise. Are emotions alone
sufficient criteria for judging complex, technological
issues?

There are at least two reasons why they are not. One
is that while technology may create a number of emo-
tionally charged problems, decisions based solely on
emotions are not likely to resolve them. In fact, they may
make them worse.

Perhaps the most dramatic example of this situation
is the controversy over the waste disposal sites for com-
mercial nuclear power plants. This past June the U.S.
Supreme Court reviewed and upheld the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's estimation of ”zero—release”
of nuclear wastes properly buried in stable geological
formations, such as underground salt domes. Yet emo-
tional public opposition near each of the proposed sites
— called the ”Not-in-my—back—yard Syndrome”
threatens to seriously delay the construction of these
badly needed facilities.

While the local lobbyists protest the permanent
storage of nuclear wastes, however, spent fuel rods from
operating reactors are piling up in temporary storage
sites — which are not designed for permanent use.

Here, if anywhere, will occur the ”acciqlent scenario”
that the anti-nuclear activists are predicting. The only
irony, of course, will be that their prophecies were self-
fulfilling.

There is yet a more subtle danger to ”going by one’s
gut feelings” than the danger of acting irrationally. That
is the danger of being made to act irrationally.

Movies like ”The Day After” that present scenarios
without explanations give their viewers nothing by which
they can judge the truth of what they are seeing. They
have no choice but to trust the media that is telling them
these things, which is not always a good thing.

Most high school English classes that discuss journal-
ism point out that all journalism must be somewhat
slanted by the very nature of the language. One can say
that a glass of water is hall full or half empty, but not
something completely neutral. But while people can be
led and misled by factual arguments, they are even more
easily manipulated by emotional appeals, as any news-
reel of German rallies in the thirties will show.

As a matter of fact, this vision of German crowds be-
ing manipulated by experts in mob psychology is what
originally inspired George Orwell to write Nineteen
Eighty-Four. Fortunately, 1984 in fact is not as bad in 1984
in fiction, although our growing technological powers
— for good or evil — and our susceptibility to emotional
arguments should make us stop and think about just
how close we could be.

But as long as we do just that — stop and think —
and stay in touch with facts as well as feelings, Orwell’s
predictions will remain the fiction that they are now.

The Skycaper is a regular feature of Skyscraper
Engineer. Test your skill at solving this issue's problems,
follow the special instructions given below for this issue's
Skycaper, then write your answers on the entry form
below. Members of the Skyscraper staff and ESC
executive officers are ineligible to enter the Skycaper
contest. Only original entry forms will be accepted (no
photocopies, please). Complete the remainder of the
form and bring or mail your entry to the Engineering Stu-
dent Cabinet office located in Room 125 of Benedum

18

Hall. Be sure to have an ESC officer mark the time and
date of your entry. Forms received by mail will be timed
at 5:00 P.M. on the postmarked date. The student who
submits the most correct answers will win a $25 prize.
In case of a tie, the award will be given to the person
with the earliest entry.. We encourage you to submit
entries even if you cannot solve all of the problems, since
it is not necessary to answer all of the questions correctly
to win. The final date on which entries will be accepted
is Friday, March 16. Good luck, and expect the unex-
pected!

Yes, the rumors are true. M3 got bored while writing
the Skycaper. But will he let his faithful fans, readers, and
super sleuths suffer? No way! Instead, M3 is making the
Skycaper a little different this time. Via this issue, M3 will
send you on a scavenger hunt. The first clues are shown
below.

Also, for this issue only, M3 will add to the prize out
of his own pocket. Not only will the winner receive a $25
prize, but M3 will donate another $25 to the jackpot.
Everyone, except the winner, who successfully answers
all of the clues will share the extra $25. That's right: $50
in cash can be won by the Skycaper solvers. Good luck!

(1) The number of letters in the last name of the
person M3 believes to be the MVP of the 1971 world
series multiplied by e7, then rounded to the nearest
integer.

(2) The speed of light to nearest thousand miles per
second times 20.

(3) B" rounded to the nearest integer, where B is the
position in the alphabet (A=1, Z=26) of the most
common first letter in the last names of the staff of
Skyscraper Engineer.

(4) (The exponent in the Skycaper author's
nickname) times (344,075) times (the exponent in the
Skycaper author's nickname).

(5) MMDCLXVH + MMCCLXXII + MCCLIII.

The sum of these five numbers yields a phone
number. Dial this number for the next clue. Calls will
only be accepted between 10:00 P.M. and 11:00 P.M., EST,
Tuesday through Sunday. For our non-local readers, the
area code is 412.

As incredible as it may seem, no entries were
received for the December Skycaper contest. It seems
that some people place a higher priority on final exams
than on the Skycaper. M3 is somewhat upset about this,
but he'll get over it. The solutions to the December
Skycaper are given below.

(1) The amount of weight necessary for the plane to
go out of control is (14,300 pounds) times (52%) = 7,436
pounds = 3,372.912863 kilograms = 3,372,912.863 grams.
The exposed surface area = the weight of the plane in
kilograms = 6,486.370891 square feet = 720.7078768
square yards. At STP one milliliter equals one gram of
water. This leads to the equation:

number of minutes
until plane goes
out of control

(2) Sorry folks, due to circumstances beyond our
control, an error occurred in exercise number two. A
letter was incorrect and the multiplication did not work
out smoothly. For those of you who are upset about this,
all we can say is that we are sorry and we will do our
best to insure that it won't happen again. For those of
you who lost sleep over this unsolvable exercise, M3
chuckles in your general direction.

(3) 03, O9, 25, 27, 60, 71, 79
These are the final two digits of the years that the Pitts-
burgh Pirates went to the World Series. The missing year
was '71 when the Pirates defeated the Baltimore Orioles
in seven games led by series MVP Roberto Clemente.

(4) In this exercise, Mark swims at a constant rate,
which can be ignored. Also, anything floating in the E.
Engels River is affected equally by its rate whether it is
headed upstream or downstream. Therefore, it would
take forty minutes for Mark to catch his bathing suit.
Thus, the E. Engels River flows at a rate of 12 miles per
2 times 40 minutes which is 12 miles per 80 minutes or
9 miles per hour.

(5) As shown in the drawing below, Santa Claus has
a crown. Also, Santa has a gift in his sack for Dave. From
this, it may be concluded that the Skyscraper Engineer
staff member M3 admires the most is staff artist David
King.

Convert the
production line
into a ﬁontier
of crea tivily.

The cast-iron technology of
the factory will soon be silicon
technology.

Chips and computers trans-
fer design information directly
to the factory floor. Other
chips make possible flexible
robotics. programmable con-
trollers for machine tools, auto-
mated test systems and digital
inspection cameras. Local
area networks tie together all
these systems.

These are revolutionary
changes that can result in
better-made products, manu-
factured of new materials at
lower cost.

GE is deeply involved in
bringing manufacturing into
the silicon age. In one plant,
electronics and computer sys-
tems enable us to reduce pro-
duction time of a locomotive’s
diesel engine frame from 16
days to 16 hours. At our dish-
washer production plant, a
master computer monitors a
distributed system of pro-
grammable controls, robots,
automated conveyors,
assembly equipment and
quality control stations.

We're working on robots
that can see, assembly sys-
tems that hear, and machin-
ery that can adapt to changes
and perhaps even repair itself.

This transformation of
manufacturing from the past
to the future creates a need
for new kinds of engineers to
design and operate factories
of the silicon age. They have
to be as familiar with the reali-
ties of the assembly line as
with the protocols of software
communications.

They will synchronize
dozens of real-time systems
whose slightest move affects
the performance of every
other system. The frontiers of
manufacturing technology
have been thrust outward. Old
ideas have been questioned,
new ones probed. Some ideas
are now on production lines.
Others are still flickers of light
in an imagination.

All offer opportunities for
you to seek, to grow, and to
accomplish.

If you can dream it,
you can do It.
