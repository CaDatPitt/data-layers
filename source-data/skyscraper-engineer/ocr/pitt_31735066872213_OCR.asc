This is the look
of boiling steel

The picture was taken with a camera that exposes

3,000 frames per second. One second of action
takes more than three minutes to project at normal
viewing speed.

The picture was taken looking into an open hearth
furnace, and it discloses action that was only vaguely
perceived before. This enables U. S. Steel scientists
to develop a better understanding of the kinetics of
heat transfer and chemical reaction at temperatures
approaching 3,000° F.

This is but a small part of the scientific world that
exists within United States Steel—the leading pro-
ducer in one of the most interesting businesses in the
world, the steel business. if you want to dig ore out
of the mountains of Venezuela, investigate the atomic
structure of steel crystals, help rocket designers solve
new problems with new steels, there might well be a

It is the planned result of layer-

“locks” surface to foundation to
help spread the weight load,

of the Nuclear Design Section, Mr. Graves works with Dr. Wilfried Bergmann (Vienna, PhD '51), on right, and other young scientists who operate the facility.

At 30, Harvey Graves directs nuclear design
of two major Westinghouse reactors

After completing the Westinghouse Student Training
Course in 1951, Harvey Graves attended the West-
inghouse Advanced Design Course* and was sent by
Westinghouse to the Oak Ridge School of Reactor
Technology for one year. Back at Westinghouse again
in 1953, Engineer Graves did advanced work on nuclear
reactor development.

In 1955, he was promoted to supervisory engineer
on the Belgian reactor project. In 1956, he was again
promoted to Manager, Westinghouse Nuclear Design
Section. Today, Mr. Graves’ 24-man section is develop-
ing and designing the nuclear portion of commercial
reactors for the Yankee Atomic Electric Company and

Because e7zg’z'22eerz'7zg is a /Jrofaszsmz at GM —
your accomp ishments are accorded added attention

You’ve picked your profession—engineering.
You plan to practice with the company of your choice.

But will the company you join recognize you as a pro-
fessional man? Will it give you professional responsibili-
ties? Will you be given challenging assignments?

If you pick General Motors —- and General Motors picks
you for one of the many different kinds of engineering work
involved in producing our hundreds of different products-
we have reason to think you will.

For to us, engineering is a profession.

Not only at our General Motors Technical Center—but in
every one of our 35 divisions and 126 plants in 71 cities
and 19 states—-it is recognized as such.

This professional recognition is shown in minor ways —
like putting you on an annual salary, not an hourly rate.
And—like giving you vacations with pay.

It is shown in major ways, too.

It is shown in the fabulous GM Technical Center near
Detroit, dedicated to the advancement of engineering and

science, equipped with every conceivable research facility.
Shown in the encouragement given you in pursuing

advanced degrees. Shown by the fact that so many key men
throughout General Motors are engineers.

How far can an engineer go in General Motors? There is
no limit—literally. For example, 14 out of 33 Vice-Presidents
are engineers, 23 of 42 Division General Managers are
engineers. These men were in your shoes not so many
years ago.

Today, General Motors is looking for young engineers who
may fill these executive positions in the years to come. If
you’re the kind of man we’re looking for—the kind of man
who wishes to practice his engineering profession—let us
hear from you. It could be the most important letter of
your life.

Sir:

On behalf of the students in the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
I would like to thank the editor
and staff for a really ﬁne magazine.

The various -feature articles cer-
tainly cover a range of interest

Joe Martinelli

which appeals to all of our stu-
dents.

The other features such as “Half-
way Up The Hill” and “Slips O’

ing side-lights.

I would especially like to con-
gratulate you on the ‘feature arti-
cle, “This is EMITT”, which ap-
peared in the December issue. This
article greatly increased stuident
knowledge of the program and thus
will ai-d the E & M Cabinet in the
development of the program.

Sir:

It was gratifying to see that
the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

EMITT Awards. The articles were
very interesting and will, I hope,
stimulate i-ncreased interest in this
worthwhile program.

Alan C. Rankin

Why? How? What?
Sir:
Congratulations on your current
series entitled Pittsburgh’s Progress.
The administration a-nd the
chamber of commerce has kept
everyone constantly aware of the
changes which are taking place in
Pittsburgh, but they have not gone
into detail on why these changes
must be made, how they are being

made, or what the result will be.
We, as engineers, have little inter-
est in a project unless we know the
reasoning behind it, the method
of completion, and the expected
results.

These three questions, why, how
and to what end; which are up-
permost in the engineer’s mind, are
answered in this series.

I am looking forward to more
articles on Pittsburgh’s Progress.

Before anyone can write a good
article, he must be thoroughly fam-
iliar with the sulbject. Each of this
month’s authors has an author-
itative ‘background for his article.

When John Pike, author of “Is
Sales Engineering For You?” was
graduated from Pitt in 1949, he
took advanced courses in chemical
engineering at the University of
Tennessee. He then began his car-
eer as a chemical engineer in the
ﬁeld of development, plant design,
and plant operations.

Although he joined Struthers
Wells Corporation as a design engi-
neer, John was later transferred to
sales. At present he is Eastern Dis-
trict Manager, supervising sales of
Struthers Wells Products in the
Eastern United States and foreign

markets.
A visitor to the Allegheny Coun-

ty 'Observatory may be conducted
on a tour through the building by
George Swetnam, author of “Look-
ing to the. Stars.”

George has been a part time
employee at the Observatory since
April of 1954. During this time he
has acquired a vast knowledge of
the Observatory’s research program
and history.

At present he is working on the
parallax research program which
he describes in his article.

SKYSCRAPER alumnus and
1956 Engineers’ Week Chairman,
Thomas Tarolli can write with au-
thority concerning the opportunities
for engineers in the ﬁeld of patent
law. Author of “A Career in Pat-
ent Law,” Tom is currently involv-

ed in this work. When he received
his degree in industrial engineering
last spring, Tom moved to Virginia
to begin training toward a degree
in law.

He attends George Washington
University during the evenings and
works full-time at the Patent Of-
ﬁce during the day.

“A New System for Sewage Dis-
posal” is written by David Schac-
ter, a newcomer to the SKY-
SCRAPER staff. For his first as-
signment, Dave, a freshman Civil
Engineer, was sent to cover the

...as in advancement opportunities
at Sylvania

It remained for Nicholas Lobachevsky to solve a riddle that bothered mathe-
maticians for the better part of twenty-two centuries.* He was able to construct
a rational geometry by denying Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate—by maintaining that
parallels do meet.

Here at Sylvania Electric we have a noneuclidean geometry of our own, in
which parallels also meet. It’s a geometry of professional development, though,
and not just of points, lines, and planes.

 ’/WHAT DO wE MEAN .

THIS: At Sylvania a man advances by one of two parallel paths.

If his interests and talents lie in the areas of engineering and scientiﬁc
specialization, he advances as a specialist.

If his forte is in the areas of organization and administration, he advances
through management.

These parallel paths meet in a common point: At Sylvania a man knows that
he is given the fullest opportunity to develop and exercise his talents. He knows
that a man goes as far and as fast as he is able in the path of his choice. Whether he
chooses management or specialization, he finds equal rewards and compensation.

Graduates and men with advanced degrees in science and engineering will discover
Research, Development, Manufacturing and Marketing careers at Sylvania——in
specialization or management — in:
LIGHTING, RADIO, TV, HI-Fl, ELECTRONICS, SEMICONDUCTORS, PHOTOGRAPHY,
COMMUNICATIONS & NAVIGATION SYSTEMS, AIRBORNE DEFENSE, RADAR, ECM,
MISSILES, COMPUTERS, CHEMICALS, PHOSPHORS, PLASTICS, METALS & WIRE.

a message from the dean

JOB SATISFACTION EVALUATION

A majority of you, the students in our Schools of
Engineering and Mines, have planned your educational
program with the earning of bachelor’s degrees as a
terminal point. Some -few of you will continue your
engineering studies on a full-time basis with master’s
de-grees or doctor’s degrees as your goal. Most of you
will begin your professional practice of engineering
as industrial employees soon after the completion of
your undergraduate engineering studies.

The earning of your baccalaureate degrees is a ﬁrst
and essential objective in your engineering careers. A
second and equally important consideration is the se-
lection and acceptance of your ﬁrst engineering employ-
ment. Engineering graduates of a generation ago were
faced with the same problem but in much simpler
form. It ‘was not a question of which offer of employ-
ment shall I accept but rather will I be fortunate
enough to ﬁnd employment in the ﬁeld of engineering
for which I have prepared. Today, with engineering
employment opportunities in abundance, there is a
tendency for young engineers to be less concerned with
making employment decisions and rely on the practice
of frequent job changes as a method of achieving em-
ployment satisfaction.

This procedure can and does work, but with cer-
tain deﬁnite disadvantages for both engineering em-
ployee and employer. In periods of engineering man-
power shortages the disadvantages are greater for the
employer than the employee. When the supply and de-
mand for engineers is more nearly in balance or when
there is an over supply of manpower, the individual
is harmed more by the practice than the employer.
At any time, too frequent job changing should be
discouraged. The problem is of such magnitude as to
have been responsible for several studie's of what con-
stitutes job satisfaction for engineers. The factors
considered as signiﬁcant are enumerated with; summar-
ized comments for your consideration in making em-
ployment decisions.

Living Conditions. This factor receives little at-
tention in the early stages of employment
but soon becomes a prime factor in
total employment satisfaction. If the young
engineer is married or contemplating mar-
riage and living in a strange section of the

FEBRUARY 1958

BY W. R. TURKES

country at a great distance from “home,”

this can be very important.

Salaries. High salaries paid engineers entering
industry are competitive and show little
variation. The important consideration is
salary potential for the engineer who
through his own efforts achieves rapid pro-
fessional growth and development.

Job Requirements. The general opinion exists
among young engineers that their job re-
quirements are too routine and do not pro-
vide sufficient opportunity for professional
development. .

Job Security. Normally this item receives little
consideration other than the assurance that
the company is sound ﬁnancially and is
maintaining its position with compe'titors.

Job Content. This is regarded as of primary im-
portance ‘by young engineers. Generally all

' other things are rated as secondary to job
content. The pre-employment determina-
tion of this factor is frequently difficult‘ and
this item is the leading cause of a change in
employment.

Advancement Opportunities. Most engineers re-
port this to be almost as important as job
content. They are closely related consider-
ations for an ambitious, energetic, young
engineer and both must be present before
employment is acceptable.

In addition to those already reviewed, working
conditions, research facilities and opportunities, em-
ployee beneﬁts, training and educational programs,
professional status, competence of supervision and
‘management and employer prestige are worth your
attention when evaluating an engineer-ing employment
opportunity for job satisfaction.

Certainly personal factors should be included in
your complete survey of employment opportunities.
Differences in individuals account for variations. in the
values placed on the many job factors which deter-
mine optimum employment conditions.

These facts about the Allegheny Observatory,

LOOKING TO THE STARS

Eiight miles from the Cathedral of Learning, at
the top of a hill in Riverview Park, stands Pitt’s
Allegheny Observatory, location of the University’s
astronomical research activities. Its three telescopes
and many supplementary measuring instruments a-re
in -use every clear night in an attempt to unravel
some of the puzzles the heavens present.

No other research laboratory at the University
has such impressive tools for its tr-ade as the Observa-
tory’s telescopes. The smallest dome houses the Fitz
thirteen-inch visual refrvactor (lens telescope). Built
in 1861, it stood in the original observatory on the
North Side before it was transferred to the present
building in 1900.

Shortly after its construction, Philotus Dean, one
of the early directors of the Observatory, was so proud
of this telescope (one of the largest in the world at
that time) and so afraid that something might happen
to it, that he issued an order that it was not -to be
used for any purpose whatsoever! His fears were
grounded; shortly after the end of his term of office
as director, the lens of the telescope was stolen.

Now this was not a simple job. The lens is thir-
teen inches in diameter and an inch thick, the type
of object that c-an not be pocketed casually and re-
moved. Nevertheless, the lens was stolen, and in
its place was a note saying that for $5,000 the tele-
scope lens would be returned unharmed. The officials
of the University considered this proposal but politely
declined it for two good reasons. First, if they allowed
this “lensnapping” to be successful, no large telescope
lens in the world would be safe. Besides, they couldn’t
spare that much money. They hastily added, how-
ever, that if the lens was returned, they would forget
prosecution. The lens reappeared, but with many horri-
ble scratches, some of which it still bears. At present
the only major telescope -to be lensna-pped is in honor-

The Thaw telescope is the largest refractor in exist-
ence to have this feature; all of the larger ones are
designed for visual work. Since its installation, the
Thaw Refractor has taken more than 90,000 photo-
graphs.

The main research program of the Observatory
at this time is determining the parallaxes of nearby
stars. If you close one eye, hold your ﬁnger still in
front of you, and move your head from side to side,
you may notice that your ﬁnger appears to move
against the background of more distant objects. The
closer your ﬁnger to your eye, the greater is the ap-
parent motion and vice-versa. This phenomenon is
called parallax and is quite useful in determining the
distance of many stars. If two photographs are taken
of a nearby star when the earth is on opposite sides
of its orbit, the star will ap-pear to have shifted slight-
ly against the background of more distant “ﬁxed”
stars. From the angle of this shift and the diameter
of the earth’s orbit, the distance of the star can be
accurately computed. Of course, if the star is too far
away, its parallax may be too small to measure.

To measure this parallax, the Thaw telescope is
used -as a giant telephoto camera. «Besides the “ﬁnd-

ing” telescope, which to an amateur astronomer would
be a ﬁne instrument in its own right, -an eight-inch
tubeless telescope is used for -ﬁne guiding. Due to
slight inaccuracies in the clock drive of the instru-
ment, an observer must keep the telescope accurately
aimed "by centering a selected guide star on cross hairs
in the guiding telescope while the exposure is in pro-
gress. An eight by ten inch focal plane shutter is
mounted about a foot above the plate carrier; ex-
posures range from thirty seconds to an hour and a
half.

Often the parallax star, called “Pi,” is much
brighter than the comparison st-ars. Exposing correct-
ly for them might result in overexposure of the Pi
star. To get sufficient exposure on the comparison
stars, a device called a sector is used. A two-inch dia-
meter -disk of brass is supported directly over the
spot on the plate where the image of the Pi star -falls;
-a seiwing-machine motor is geared to it to rotate it
rapidly. A deep notch is cut in the disk to «allow the
light from the star to strike the plate only when the
notch is in line. By varying the size of the cut-out,
the exposure given to the Pi star can be adjusted.

The gl-ass plates used for this work are eight -by
ten inches and are coated with a s-pecial blue-sensitive
emulsion. To save money, time, and storage space,
three regions are taken on a single plate. In addition,
each region is photographed three times in succession,
the telescope being shifted slightly between exposures.
When about thirty photographs of a region have been
taken, they are measured and the parallax computed.

The results of this research on parallax values
along with accounts of other projects underway are
periodically printed in “Publications of the Allegheny
Observatory.” This publication is distributed to ob-
servatories throughout the world. In this way, all
can share the results of the work being done at Pitt’s
“eye to the sky,” the Allegheny Observatory. I

The Blink Comparator is used for comparing two photo-
graphs of the same region of the sky. It is used in the
parallax studies now being made at the Observatory.

Consider these functions of a
sales engineer; then decide . . .

BY JOHN W. PIKE, ChemE ’49

We in America, with six per cent of the world’s
acreage and seven per cent of the population, pro-
duce about half of the world’s goods. There has been
more material development in the past 50 years than
occurred in all history previous to 1900. This develop-
ment has come about through coordination of man-
agement, ﬁnance, research, engineering, production,
and sales. Of these functions, sales has undoubtedly
been one of the major contributors to our achieve-
ments.

During the last half century, we have seen the
development of the automobile, radio, airplane, re-
frigerator, and television to mention a few. In fact,
most modern conveniences we now enjoy were de-
veloped during the past 30 years. These products
were made possible through mass production techni-
ques which, in turn, were made possible by mass
marketing and sales of these items. This progress
would not have been possible without the sales engi-
neer who was responsible for promoting sale of
equipment, processes, and machinery necessary to
build plants to produce the essential chemicals, fuels,
and materials.

What does a sales engineer sell? The items can
be grouped into four categories: (1) small accessory
items, 2) large equipment and machinery, (3) plants
and processes, and (4) raw materials.

Small accessory items include products such as
valves, instruments, motors, and controls where the
sale usually averages less than $2,000. The responsi-
bility of the sales engineer is to help customers make
the proper selection of accessories. This involves very
close contact with the client’s engineering depart-
ment, and, in most cases, sales are made from standard
products usually carried in stock. The sales engineer
makes quotations, accepts orders, and arranges for
shipment of the products. The engineer selling small
standard items" is sometimes referred to as an applica-
tion engineer, since he is responsible for the selection,
recommendation, and application of the items.

The second category is large equipment and ma-
chinery. Here the sales engineer handles items selling
for $25,000 to over $500,000. Products such as large
turbines, steam generators, heat exchangers, process
equipment, electrical distribution equipment, and ma-
chine tools are items in this category. In most cases
these products are highly engineered and the result of
years of research, development, and engineering. As a

rule the sales engineer is not the designer of the equip-
ment, but can be in the case of smaller specialty pro-
ducts. Although the sales engineer is thoroughly famil-
iar with the product and its application, he usually de-
pends on the design engineers for design an-d perform-
ance details.

A third type of sales engineer handles negotia-
tions for the sale of complete plants and processes. In
this instance, the sales engineer directs a team com-
posed of his company’s engineers, research workers,
ﬁnancial officers, and executives. This man should
have a complete engineering background and, in addi-
tion, have some legal and management training. His
contracts are with leading executives of large corpora-
tions as well as ‘with engineering groups and, there-
fore, is considered tops in the sales engineering ﬁeld.
Progress is slow in this type of sale, and a large
amount of time is required on each contract. The in-
dividual selecting this ﬁeld of sales must have patience
and perseverance. Otherwise he will soon become dis-
couraged.

The fourth grouping differs from others in that
a ﬁnished product is not involved. These are pro-
ducts used in manufacturing machinery and equip-
ment such as steel plate, pipe, tubing, ﬁttings, elec-
tronic components, fasteners, insulation, and other
basic raw materials. With equipment requirements

An application engineer must sell items such as these
stock heat exchangers and tubing.

for higher pressures, higher and lower temperatures,
and corrosion resistance properties in processing, new
materials are required. In addition, special materials
are required for high speed machinery, tools, and the
atomic, jet, and missile programs.

Sales engineers specializing in metallurgy and
material application, along with welding and fabrica-
tion techniques, are required. The role of the sales
engineer is to ﬁnd new applications for existing mater-
ials and to aid in the development of new and better
materials. The same function is performed by the en-
gineer selling other raw materials or components.

Regardless of the ﬁeld of sales the engineer pur-
sues, he must possess three minimum requirements:
(1) complete knowledge of product, (2) interest in
people, and (3) initiative.

Before an engineer in sales can succeed, ‘he must
be an expert in the line of equipment, material, or pro-
cess he is attempting to sell. A prerequisite to a sales
position is preferably an extended training period in
which the engineer follows the design or engineering of
the product he intends to sell. He should also become
thoroughly familiar with the products manufactured.
This can best be done by spending several years in
his company’s engineering and production depart-
ments. Some practical experience, such as operations
or supervision of operations of chemical plants, reﬁn-
eries, manufacturing plants, power plants, or other
facilities is very desirable.

The length of time spent in a training period
varies with the type of product which will be sold,
but should extend approximately ﬁve years. It is com-
mon for companies, which have a range of products, to
start the new sales engineer on the less complicated
items, and to allow ‘him to progress into the larger
and more complicated products.

The sales engineer must ‘have an interest in peo-
ple since most of his time is spent making sales calls,
negotiating contracts, meeting with large groups to
discuss details of design, or attending sales and techni-
cal meetings. The salesman must be most effective
when presenting facts on his product to customers.
The only good way of doing this is by personal con-

tact. One of the main reasons for failure of a young
salesman is fear of some kind in his mind. Self con-
ﬁdence must be developed, and one of the greatest
aids is a like for, and being with people.

Most of the sales engineer’s work is done without
direct supervision. Therefore, it is important that ‘he
possess initiative. No boss is available to see that the
salesman reports to work on time, to arrange his
schedule of calls, or to tell him what to do when clos-
ing a contract. Over ﬁfty percent of the sales engi-
neer’s time is spent developing new markets and cus-
tomers. Although general plans are established by
management policy, it is up to the individual to plan
his schedule and sales approach.

He will ﬁnd that the job cannot always be done
"between nine and ﬁve, and must be prepared to get
up early and work late. He must spend long hours
keeping abreast of business in general and his line of
products in speciﬁc by reading business journals and
trade periodicals. Engineering study must be contin-
ued so that he can recommend changes in his com-
pany’s products. He must constantly know what com-
petitors in the same or allied lines are doing. Some
companies have established incentive and bonus plans
to give the salesman drive, but the sales engineer will
be more successful if the drive is through his own
initiative.

What are the functions of a sales engineer? The
duties of t-he sales engineer are many and varied. He
sells equipment or services, but this does not describe
the complete function of his position or the methods
used to perform the job. A few of these are: (1) per-
form market research to determine extent of markets,
(2) establish markets and introduce product, (3) de-
scribe the product to customers, and compare it with
competitive methods, (4) aid in servicing product, and
(5) aid in development of new products.

Before a company spends large sums of money on
development and design of a new product, they must
have a good idea of the product’s potential. Too
often, time and expense are put into a new product
which ends up having little or no commercial value.
The sales engineer is sometimes called on to make a

..~,u
.~.

complete study of the use of a speciﬁc product. This
would involve a review of all products that would do
the same job as the new item, and how the new pro-
duct would compete in p-rice and quality.

The markets for the products which the apparatus
produces would be studied to ascertain the number of
machines which may be required over a period of
time. The study would consist of discussing details
of the new product with prospective customers to de-
termine their willingness to purchase such an item,
and the price they would pay for it. It involves the
study of general business conditions and trends to
better judge the future of a market. The sales engineer
would be required to make a report to management
on his ﬁndings. The results of this report, with other
studies, would determine the future of t-he proposed
product. The seed for most new products is sown by
the sales engineer who is in a position to know the
wants of his customers.

A-fter a product has been developed and is ready
for marketing, it is the responsibility of the sales engi-
neer to introduce to and completely inform his cus-
tomers of the machine and its uses. He must either
prepare or aid in the preparation of bids and quota-
tions, follow up with engineering discussions, and set
up meetings with design engineers as required.

It is sometimes necessary that experimental work
be done prior to the sale or that a visit be made by
the client to an existing operation. These details are
arranged by the sales engineer. At times the item to
be sold is part of a project for which ﬁnancing must
be obtained. The sales engineer sometimes improves
his competitive position by helping with these ar-
rangements.

In most cases the engineer is selling a service or
product which is competitive with other methods or
items. The sales engineer should inform the customer
of these alternate methods and aid him with his com-
parisons. No customer can justify paying higher pric-
es for a service or product than can be obtained
through competitive bidding, unless the product is
superior. The job of the sales engineer is to show that
his product demands a premium price because of
longer li-fe, lower operating cost, better maintenance
service, etc. If this cannot be done, he must work with
the company design engineers to improve the pro-
duct or service or to simplify the design and decrease
the price.

After the product is sold, there are often many
design -details to be clariﬁed. Drawings must be sub-
mitted and checked, changes made as required, prices
adjusted, and contract details completed. Delivery
must be coordinated and customer’s personnel familiar-
ized with the operation of the product. These details
are normally coordinated by the sales engineer.

When the product has been placed in operation,
the sales engineer is sometimes required to coordin-
ate servicing the item. This is done because future
sales of the product, not only to the present user but
to others, depend to a large degree on the successful

operation of the equipment. One bad installation is
known throughout the trade; therefore, every effort
must be made to correct trouble as soon as it occurs.
The sales engineer makes it a point to visit installa-
tions in his territory at periodic intervals to correct
problems which may not be brought to his attention,
but could be placed into the hands of his competition.
This is also a good sales technique since he is able to
ﬁnd methods of improving the product, learns of pro-

posed plans for expansion, and maintains customer
good will.

While in the customer’s plant, the engineer is in
a position to spot applications for his company’s pro-
ducts which could not be seen otherwise. It must be
remembered that the salesman is the company’s main
contact with its customers as well as the public. The
sales engineer is expected to attend meetings, conven-
tions, and other functions to meet old and new cus-
tomers. He is expected to supervise company exhibits
at trade shows. Visiting officials from other compan-
ies must be cared for whenever they are in the sales-
man’s territory. He is expected to arrange for hotel

accommodations and entertainment.
What future does a sales engineer have? Some

feel that it is a blind alley job that leads nowhere. It
is amazing, however, to note the number of successful
businessmen and presidents of properous organiza-
tions that started as salesmen. Even though a man
may not want a higher position or an inside executive
job, the reward for continuing as a sales engineer is
greater than in almost any other type of work. He
is free from hindering inﬂuences, is‘ able to earn more,
and is given more individual recognition. Sales engi-
neers have played a tremendous part in the building
of America and are destined to play a greater role in
building the world of the future. I

A CAREER
IN
PATENT LAW

The patent examiner often has an
engineering degree. What does he
do? What are his opportunities?

BY THOMAS L. TAROLLI, IE ’57

It is only human nature for a person who makes
an -invention to want to keep it a secret and use it
for his own exclusive proﬁt. Similarly, companies in-
vesting millions of dollars in research do so in order
to make and use their discoveries exclusively for
their own proﬁt. An inventor who wants to exclude
others from making, using, and selling his invention
is given this right under the United States Patent
System.

The U. S. system requires an inventor to dis-
close his invention publicly, for which he, in return,
receives from the government the right to exclusive
control of his invention for seventeen years. At the
end of the seventeenth year, the invention becomes
public property and anyone may use, make, or sell it.
The right to exclusive control of the invention which
a patent carries with it is one of the most important
incentives which drives companies and individuals to
carry on research for better methods of production,
new products to produce, and the machines to carry
out the production processes.

The inventor who wishes to gain patent protec-
tion must ﬁle with the United States Patent ‘Office
an application for patent which is often prepared
for him by a patent attorney and which must con-
tain a complete and clear description of the inven-
tion. Exact drawings, if graphically portrayable, as
well as an oath affirming that so far as he knows he
is the ﬁrst inventor of the subject matter of the appli-
cation must also be included ‘with the application.

The attorney will, before preparing the speciﬁca-
tion and before employing a draftsman to prepare
the drawings, make a search of prior patents that
have been issued and other reference materials to
see if the inventor has produced something which was
not done before. If the attorney discovers in a prior
patent the same device his client claims, he will not

20

prosecute the application before the Patent Office.
If the attorney is satisﬁed his client has something
new, he will then ﬁle a patent application with the
Patent Office.

The Patent Oﬂice, upon receipt of the applica-
tion, will sen-d it to a patent examiner who handles
all applications containing subject matter "in a given
ﬁeld of science or technology. The examiner, an ex-
pert in his ﬁeld, has available all of the patents that
have been issued in his technical ﬁeld and has been
made aware of the latest results of research in this
ﬁeld, through his continuing -observation of new patent
applications. Based on his technical knowledge and
the results of a search he makes through prior refer-
ences in the particular art. He then determines if the
alleged invention is worthy of a patent or not.

Usually, the examiner and attorney exchange
letters that discuss various aspects -of the application
and prior patents which seem to prevent the inventor
-from obtaining a patent. The attorney, in order to
get a patent for his client, must show the examiner
what advantages the alleged invention has that the
prior patents do not have. When he is thoroughly con-
vinced that the inventor has devised something new
an-d signiﬁcant, the examiner will authorize the issu-
ance of a patent to the inventor.

The person who makes this determination of pat-
entability, the patent examiner, is a highly skilled
professional person who has an extensive background
in a broad ﬁeld of science or technology, in law, and
in patent practice and procedure. Within the first

The Patent Office library contains court decisions, volumes
discussing patent practice, and legal periodicals.

few months of his early training the new examiner
is given a great degree of independence and respon-
sibility. He is expected to assume responsibility for
prosecution application, arrive at independent con-
clusions, discuss his analysis with a supervisor, and
convey his determination to the applicant. To do these.
things a good patent examiner must have certain
characteristics.

Typically, he must be curious an-d have a de-
sire to see how things work. He must be well versed in
the technical aspects of a given ﬁeld and understand
the problems that exist in that ﬁeld. Since he will
often be called upon in interviews with attorneys to
clarify issues and answer questions regarding his de-
cisions, he must necessarily be able to communicate
his thoughts and state his stand on a given question
accurately.

A person selecting a career as a patent examiner
may or may not be a student of the law. If he choses
to 'work toward and obtain a law degree and/or bar
membership it will, of course, have a profound effect
on his professional development, for much broader
career areas will have been opened to him. Without
law, however, he is still qualiﬁed to advance to signi-
ﬁcantly responsible positions in the Patent Office and
to positions of some prestige as a patent agent. Here
he has full authority to prosecute patent applications
before the Patent Office for clients.

The patent examiner, however, whose background
includes technology, patent practice, and legal training
is well on his way to attaining a position of respect,
affluence, and inﬂuence. There is a continuing de-
mand for well trained capable people to ﬁll top level
positions in the Patent Office, in patent law offices,
and in the patent departments of large -and small indus_.

trial concerns.
In the Patent Office itself, over 40% of the pro-

fessional staff are in positions commanding salaries
in a range between eighty ﬁve hundred and thirteen
thousand ﬁve hundred dollars per year. Openings in
-positions located in law offices and industrial con-
cerns, t-hat command comparable and even higher
salaries and commissions, are nearly always available
to the well trained, competent patent examiner.

As a patent attorney engaged in the prosecution
of a client’s application, a person with Patent Office
background has the advantage of familiarity with
legal and procedural requirements and can expedite
the prosecutionof a case while avoiding pitfalls. The
new man in a law ﬁrm or_ industrial patent depart-
ment soon attains nearly complete independence of
action and, in time, may become a partner of the
law ﬁrm, be promoted to a supervisory or manage-
ment position separated from the patent law depart-
ment of the industrial corporation, or even establish

his own_ law office.
It is the duty of the patent attorney to obtain

for the inventor the broadest patent protection possi-
ble and to aid him in exploiting his -device or pro-
cess to the fullest. This may include preparing con-

tracts of sale and assignment of patent rights, prose-
cution of persons who infringe patents rights of a
client, protection of clients against whom infringement
proceedings are brought, or appeal to the courts
from adverse actions of the Patent Office.

A patent attorney, realizing the pride an inven-
tor will have in his invention, may also be called upon
to tactfully explain to his client why an application
for patent has been rejected, and if the inventor has
nothing which is new, tell him why it would be futile
to apply for a patent.

Professionals in either examination or prosecu-
tion phases of the patent ﬁeld will, throughout their
career, apply the tenets of their technical specialty, of
law, and of patent practice in a form which might
be called legal engineering or legal science. Either
examiner or attorney may be called upon to read
engineering drawings, follow complex mechanical ac-
tions, chemical combinations, or electrical circuitry,
and appreciate equivalents in dissimilar ﬁelds of tech-
nology. Such knowledge is very important in determin-
ing whether the inventor has really developed some-
thing inventive in nature or has merely made con-
ventional or obvious changes in an old device or pro-
cess. -Court decisions and Patent Office regulations
also must be applied by both the examiner and the
attorney in situations which may involve complex pro-

cedural and legal questions.
The patent profession has been expanding steadi-

ly. This is due in a large part to the current emphasis
on applied research in both government and industry
since each research project results in many patent
searches and patent applications. Although the num-
ber of new people who can be assimilated into the
patent profession each year is limited, career oppor-
tunities for those who can meet the qualiﬁcations are
particularly rewarding. I

You’re living in a world of color. Man takes a brush, dips it into paint,
cloaks the drab with new cheerfulness, converts the dreary into com-
pelling beauty. But paint means so much more than mere color.

In addition to soft, pastel hues, home owners in Miami want a house
paint that stands up to constant salt air breezes, the blazing rays of a
tropic sun, intermittent heavy rainfall. Building superintendents in Gary
want a surface coating unaffected by chemically active industrial gases
and fumes, extremes in humidity, frequent changes in wind direction.
Fishing ﬂeet operators around Puget Sound want an exterior boat ﬁnish
that resists biting winds, blizzards and protracted cold. The production
engineer in a large Atlanta cannery wants a food container coating
impervious to chemical reaction, yet taste-free. Yes, there’s more-
much more—to paint than mere color.

The search for new and even better paints and industrial ﬁnishes is
carried on every day at Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company. Each day
brings new challenges to its laboratories . . . challenges quickly trans-
lated into improved products.

OU’RE looking at a ring
gear “nesting” three small-
er gears. It’s part of one of the
smoothest shifting transmis-
sions ever put in a car. But it was
almost too expensive to build.
Getting this extra smoothness
called for squeezing more gears
into the same size transmission
case. Nesting was necessary to
save space. And the big ring
gear had to be extra tough. The
problem was to make it eco-
nomically.

The manufacturer turned to
Timken Company metallurgists
—acknowledged experts in ﬁne
alloy steels. They showed how
to save the cost of boring out
each gear—by starting with
Timken® seamless steel tubing.
The hole’s already there. And
the Timken steel has all
the toughness a transmission
needs. It’s another example
of how Timken Company

A NEW SYSTEM F OR SEWAGE DISPOSAL

This vast sewage project will ensure

cleaner rivers and streams
for Allegheny County.

Subsurface rock requires steel ribbed supports to prevent
cave in during dynamiting operations.

28

BY DAVID H. SCHACTER, CE ’61

Elarly in March 1956, work was begun on the new
$100,000,000 intercepting sewer and treatment plant
project of the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority.
Linking 70 separate communities, the sewage project
has been hailed as the most signiﬁcant forward step
ever taken by Allegheny County for the improvement
of the streams and rivers in the area.

The heart of the new system is the sewage treat-
ment plant and t-he main pumping station. Located
between the Western Penitentiary and the north end
of the Mc'Kees Rocks bridge, the plant and pumping
station have these construction statistics: 28,300 cubic
yards of earth excavated; 44,000 cubic yards of granu-
lated slag backﬁll; 25,000 cubic yards of rock excava-
tion; 51,000 cubic yards of concrete; 3,000 tons of rein-
forcing steel; and 64,000 linear feet of concrete and
wood piles.

Capable of handling 150,000,000 gallons of sewage
per day, the treatment plant will employ the following

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

method for treating the sewage ﬂuid.

Sewage to be treated will pass through four me-
chanical racks where large objects such as rags and
sticks will be removed. Next, in fo-ur grit chambers
heavier inorganic material such as dirt and sand will
be removed. After being measured in a ﬁow meter,
the sewage will ﬁow into two pre-aeration tanks which
together with aerated inﬂuent channels, will provide
an aeration period of 44 minutes.

After aeration the sewage will move into six pri-
mary sedimentation tanks. These will provide a deten-
tion period of two hours for removal of settleable
and ﬂoating solids. The effluent from the top ‘will be
chlorinated and returned to the river.

The sludge and scum from the sedimentation
tanks will be pumped to the sludge heaters where it
will be heated to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. At this temp-
erature the sludge will be pumped into one of the ten
concentration tanks to obtain a higher concentration of
solids by ﬂotation. After the concentration has been
obtained, the subnatant will be drained off and retum-
ed to the aeration chamber, repeating the cycle from
that point. The concentrated solids will be removed
from the tanks and fed into one of four incinerator
units. Finally, the ash will be trucked away from the
plant, completing the cycle.

An unusual feature of the sewage treatment plant
design is the method of sludge concentration by Hot-
ation, followed by incineration o-f the concentrated
raw sludge. This method. eliminates the need for wash-
ing the sludge, or any chemical treatment except
-chlorination, special ﬁltering facilities, and sludge di-
gestion; all or most of these are common to units in
operation elsewhere in the country.

Also of unusual design is the pumping station.
The pumping station embodies two concrete circular
structures, one inside the other. The wet well, the
innermost structure, is 40 feet in diameter and 118.5
feet deep. Its location in the center of the circular
pumping station pit permits short suction lines and
a very economical construction arrangement. The
pumping-station pit is an annular space surrounding
the entire 'wet well and having an inside diamete-r of
50 feet and an outside diameter of 94- feet.

Three intercepting sewer tunnels will enter at
the bottom of the wet well from different directions.
The largest of ‘these will be 126 inches in diameter.
As its size grows gradually smaller it will reach all
the way to the Westinghouse Bridge in the Turtle
Creek Valley. Another tunnel will go under the Ohio
River to McKees Rocks and drain the Chartiers Creek
watershed. The third tunnel will extend to Emsworth
and serve the lower Ohio Valley.

These tunnels are providing the system with -an-
other ﬁrst, the largest number of miles of -tunnels ever

used in an intercepting sewer project (30). The pip-
ing used in these tunnels together with the 34: miles of
intercepting sewers that are ‘being constructed as open
cut, that is by trench excavation, could be laid end to
end and they would stretch from Pittsburgh to Johns-
town.

The trunk sewer will require the excavation of
1,200,000 cubic yards of earth and rock; the placing
of 353,000 linear feet of pipe (mainly concrete) vary-

sewage project, faces the Ohio River.

ing in size from 8 inch to 126 inch; an-d the building of
260 diversion, outlet, and drop structures.

Down shafts are being drilled to connect the
sewers that now empty into the rivers of the area with
the new interceptors. At the top of each down shaft
will be placed a box-like reinforced concrete -diversion
structure, designed to induce the sewage to ﬂow in
Va swirling motion to obtain satisfactory conditions of
ﬂow in the down shafts. In addition, because t-he pre-
sent sewer system carries both sanitary and storm
sewage, the structure will automatically divert a pre-
deter-fnined quantity o-f combined sewage and storm
ﬂow to the interception sewer while the remainder
will overﬂow into. the streams.

From the foregoing it can be seen that this pro-
ject can boast of many unique features. According -to
John F. Laboon, Executive D-irector and Chief Engi-
neer for the Authority, the spectacular nature of -the
design has drawn attention from engineers across the
country.

It is easily seen that the Allegheny County Author-
ities’ trunk sewer and treatment project has many
outstanding features. Of course the full value of the
project will not be completely understood by the
general public until the system is constructed and
placed in operation. At that time Pittsburgh will be-
gin to note -the effects -the system has on the local
rivers and streams. -'

when Wmpleted Allegheny C0un’ty’s Sewage works on the Ohio River will serve 70 separate communities.

These are the things
engineers will be talking about

THE HILL

HOW WILL HE ARRIVE?

The‘ traditional arrival of Saint Patrick during
Engineers’ Week will be supplanted this year by the
arrival of Leonardo da Vinci, As usual the method
of arrival is a well kept secret. In former years St.
Patrick has arrived by dump truck, helicopter, tank,
and surrey. This year, with Saint Patrick honoring da
Vinci, the arriving will be done by da Vinci, rather
than Saint Patrick.

Russ Maxwell, ChemE ’59, heads a ten-man
Central Planning C-omm-ittee which will decide the
method of da Vinci’s arrival. Members of the commit-
tee, along with Maxwell, are: Pete Bizon, ME ’59;
Dick Lampert, MetE ’58, Howard Johnson, ChemE
’59; Bob S'hee'han, IE ’60; Jim Fa‘herty, Aero E ’58;
Joe Lamartine, MetE ’58, Ken Fraelich, EE ’59; Bill
Barna, PE ’60;_]im Riddel, CE ’59; and Jay Nuna-
maker, ME ’60.

Scheduled for March 17th, t-he arrival of Leonardo
da Vinci, as well as other details of the 1958 Engineers’
Week ce'le'brat~ion, will be covered in t-he March issue of
SKY-SC’RAPEiR ENGINEER.

SENIORS TAKE NOTE

‘Changes in the regul-ations for selection of the
Outstanding Senior Awards are in effect -this year.
Recently adopted by the E & M Cabinet, the revisions
call for selection of the outstanding seniors of both
the individual departments and of t'he Schools. of Engi-
neering and Mines to be held once a year instead of
the usual once a semester. Graduates from February,
Iune, and August 1958 are eligible for the awards.

Selection is made‘ on a basis o-f leadership, scholar-
ship, character, and service to the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines. After the selection of an outstanding
sen-ior from each department, a Final Selection Com-
mittee meets -and chooses the Outstanding Graduating
Senior of the Schools of Engineering and Mines.

In the past, announcement of these honors was
made at the annual Awards Seminar at the end of the
spring semester and in the SKYSCRAPJER ENGI-
NCEEER. This year, however, the -a'wardees will be an-
nounced simultaneously in the March issue of the
SKYSCRIAPER and at the Engineers’ Week joint
semi-nar on March 20.

Saint Patrick has used these methods for arrival on the
Pitt campus. They are: (upper left), a dump truck in
1954; (upper right), a helicopter in 1955; (lower left), a

THE SHAMROCK BALL

IOn'Friday, March 21, the Engineering and Mines
Association’s annual Shamrock Ball will round out the
festivities of Engineers’ Week. Dancing will be from
nine to one. Dance Chairman Ken Rothert, ChemE
’59, recently announced that, as in former years, the
Shamrock Ball ‘will be held at West View Danceland.

_ Highlighting the intermission program will be the
presentation of the Shamrock Award to the winning
department for Engineers’ Week. The Engineers’ Week
Queen will also be named at this time.

REVAMP E & M CABINET

Due to the increasing functions of the Engineering
and Mines Cabinet, a much needed revision of the
Executive Committee has emerged. Membership .of the
committee has been increased from ﬁve persons to
eight. The three newly-created positions are those of
Physical Plant Director, Coordinator of Standing ICom-
mittees, and Coordinator of Special Committees.

‘President Joe Martinell-i, PE ’58, when announcing
the change, stated"that, “The revision will encourage
a more direct line of communication between the
members of Cabinet.” The three newly created posi-
tions will be ﬁlled by an internal election of the
Cabinet.

SUN’S HEAT PRODUCED BY MOVIE MIRRORS

While probing the mysteries of intense heat, scien-
tists have produced temperatures appr-oachin-g that of
the sun’s surface’ with ordinary motion picture projec-
tion equipment.

Highly-polished curved mirrors concentrate rays
from a carbon are into a small but extremely ‘high-
energy beam that can produce temperature's above
7,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The technique is actually a
scientiﬁc version of the use of a magnifying glass to
set ﬁre to a piece of paper, and was developed in con-
nection with high-temperature studies at the research
laboratories of National Carbon Company, Division

With this arc image furnace temperatures almost as hot
as the sun's surface can be produced.

of Union Carbide Corporation.

The are image furnace, as this versatile research
tool is known, is not new. An entirely new twist has
been introduced, however, that adds immensely to its
usefulness and makes practical the high temperatures
required in modern-day research. Previous furnaces
have used specially-designed parabolic mirrors to
focus the are’s energy onto the substance to be
‘heated.

The new design uses two elliptical mirrors of the
standard type found in motion picture projection

equipment. One mirror directs the energy of the are
at the other, which in turn concentrates the radia-
tion on the specimen being heated, forming a life-size
image of the actual arc. The new equipment is highly
compact and portable and can be operated practically
anywhere, at any time. It is said to produce results
comparable to that of a solar furnace with a 60-inch
diameter reflector, which depends on the‘ sun’s rays
for its energy and can be operated only under favor-
able climatic conditions.

STEEL SANDWICHES

Fully—assembled experimental “sandwiches” com-
posed of stainless steel plates inside and carbon steel
outside are being made at the Homestead District
Works of United States Steel. To hold the “sand-
wich” together during rolling, all four sides of the car-
bon steel covers are welded.

Using the “sandwich” rolling technique, U. S.
Steel has produced thin-gage stainless and alloy steel
sheets attaining 90 inches in width and 230 inches in
length. These are an achievement of a research and
development project designed to point the way to
commercial production of such sheets for the aircraft

Carbon steel covers insulate the stainless and alloy plates
that make up this “sandwich.”

and missile industry.

Th-e “key” to the process is the carbon steel cov-
ers, which insulate the stainless and alloy plates they
enclose and keep the “meat” of the “sandwich” at
favorable rolling temperatures. This factor has -enabl-
ed U. S. Steel to produce the widest sheets ever produc-
ed on existing mill equipment.

-GIANT BULTMAKER

The size barrier in the automatic cold-forging of
steel has been broken. Largest automatic cold-forgin-g
machine ever built, this $500,000 giant Boltmaker is
turning out 1%;-inch diameter hexagon head cap
screws at the’ rate of 40 a minute at The Cleveland
Cap -Screw Company in Cleveland.

The big Boltmaker, ﬁve years in the making, ‘was
designed primarily to make large diameter cap screws
and industrial fasteners. The machine will produce
hexagon head cap screws, hexagon and square head
bolts, and high-strength structural bolts in sizes from 7/8
inch up to and including 1%;-inch diameter and up to
10 inches long.

But it is believed that the greatest contribution of
the’ giant Boltmaker will be its as-yet untried ability
to produce odd-shaped components far larger than
any turned out before by automatic cold-forging. In
this area the cold-forging giant is expected to should-
er aside hitherto unchallenged machining and hot-

forging for the’ production of a variety of non-fastener
industrial parts. These parts include such special com-
ponents as pinion drive shafts, transmission shafts, in-
sulator pins, big rivets, coupling bolts, »ball—joint sus-
pension parts, and various gear blanks.

Automatic cold forging is a fast method of fabri-
cation which yields products superior in strength and
surface ﬁnish to those produced by alternative methods
of manufacture. The metal is moved, not removed.
This enhances product strength in at least two ways.
First, cold-working improves the granular structure
of the steel, making the part stronger than the raw
material from which it is formed. Secondly, the
strength-giving grain ﬂow lines of the steel are main-
tained rather than cut as they are -machining. The
ﬁnish is good, as the method does not produce the
surface scale inherent in hot forging.

The process employed by the new Boltmaker con-
sists of taking wire or rods larger than the nominal
diameter of the ﬁnished fastener and, by a series of
operations, reducing this wire or rod to a pitch dia-
meter ready for rolling. The machine then automatical-
ly heads, points, and roll-threads the fastener.

The machine‘ has variable-speed clectronic con-
trols, the ﬁrst machine to be so equipped. The elec-
tronic controls permit the 200-ton giant to be operat-
ed at any speed from 4 rpm to 40. This precise speed
control is particularly important when running large
special upsets.

START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW

By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock 8: Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of (growth and advancement. For today
B&W stands poise at a new era of expansion and
development.

Here’s an indication of what's going on at B&W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
wi_ths_tand'temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Diyision is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.

These are but a few of the projects— not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturin
phases —- upon which B&W engineers are now engage}.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.

I-‘low is the company doing right now? Let's look at one

Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer

At Vought, the engineer doesn’t often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it’s no wonder.

For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects —— among
them the record-breaking Crusader
ﬁghter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-p1us-
mph ﬁghter, details of which are still
classiﬁed.

The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.

Engineers with many specialties share
these. experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:

electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation

investigation of advanced propulsion
methods

Mach 5 conﬁgurations

Vought’s excellent R&D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new ﬁelds
while advancing in his own.

IT WAS A ROUTINE CRUISE

for the Bon Homme Richard.

But for Wayne Burch, it was a memorable climax

to months of hard work. Aboard the carrier with

the Chance Vought design specialist was the white-
lacquered ﬁghter he’d worked on so long.

*
Wayne had joined the Crusader dayﬁghter project
in Preliminary Design, on alighting and arresting
gear. He’d transposed his initial drawings into detail

‘ design and, later, he’d watched his gear pass jig and
_ aircraft drop tests. At the Navy Test Center, the
C Crusader’s gear absorbed maximum sink speeds and

ar-resting tension, and Burch once more was there.

at

. Now, Navy pilots on the Bon Homme Richard were

taking the Crusader to sea, and Burch was going
along. This time his assignment was simply to watch,
and this time the Crusader was to be just part of
the picture. Vought wanted him to experience carrier
life and to see how his new weapon ﬁtted in. For
Wayne, whose sea log began and ended with one
day’s ﬁshing from a 20-foot launch, it promised to
be an eye—opening voyage.

1958

‘The Aircraft Designer
Who Went to Sea . . .

 

For six days the designer shared quarters with Navy
ﬁghter pilots and had coffee with maintenance men.
He studied aircraft spotting and catapulting, and he
learned the sign language of the LS0 (Landing Sig-
nal Oﬂicer). He marveled at the ﬁngersnap timing
of the Navy’s deck handlers and at the Bon Homme
Rz'chard’s mid-voyage refueling of two bobbing
destroyers. *

Wayne calls it “one of the most enjoyable weeks
of my life” . . . and, as other sea-going Vought
engineers have discovered, “one of the most proﬁt-
able, too.

“Now I know the pilot’s job, what maintenance
wants . . . how really big the operation is.

“It’s something you don’t get if you stick too close
to design.

“I guess you’d call it perspective.”

At Chance Vought the designer stays in touch
with his product . . . Contact begins in development,
extends through test and includes, when possible,

a study by the designer of the tactical environment
in which his weapon will serve.

heavy-weather tug, on his way to a sales
call on an oil drilling operation out in the
Gulf of Mexico. A young accountant from
Chicago is helping to supervise the opera-
tion of an electronic accounting system.
Another, an engineer hailing from Okla-
homa, is in Arabia, helping to supervise
the installation of a huge oil drilling rig he
helped to design. Sound interesting?

"Since the day we decided to get married, I've been
doing a lot of thinking about our future. It's time I
made a choice on a career. I've talked to the Dean of
Engineering, most of my professors, and to some of the
fellows who have graduated, and you know, they all
said the same thing. ‘

"They all agree that the aircraft and missile industry
holds the best opportunities and the brightest future for
an engineer these days. What they said makes sense,
too, because developments in this ﬁeld today really give ' '
a fellow an opportunity to make important contribu-.,,..
tions on vital projects.

"Not only that, but the aircraft industry is noted for
its good salaries. Generous beneﬁts, too. And advance-
ment in both salary and position is limited only by how”,
far I want to go.”

nlimited opportunities, high salaries, company—paid
U beneﬁts unheard of until a few years ago —— these
are only a few of the reasons why so many young engi-
neers with a keen eye to the future are choosing the
aircraft industry.

It is only natural that many engineering graduates
should consider joining Northrop Aircraft, lnc.,_ be-
cause the company shares its many successes with every 
member of its engineering and scientific team. Ad-
vanced projects at Northrop are now in production, and
active top-priority projects mean rapid advancement
and success for the individual engineer.

Such projects include the famous Snark SM-62,
world's first intercontinental guided missile, now being’
activated in the first United'States Air Force missile
squadron; the USAF T-38 supersonic twin-jet ad-
vanced trainer; and other important missile and '
manned aircraft weapon systems and components.

Engineers in more than thirty categories contribute
to Northrop’s success in an ideal environment with the .
latest tools of science, in its new Engineering Science
Center. Here you will work with leading scientists and
engineers who respect, acknowledge, and reward your
individual ideas and abilities. "

Although many surveys show that salary
is not the prime factor contributing to iob
satisfaction, it is of great importance to
students weighing career opportunities.
Here, Mr. Gouldthorpe answers some
questions frequently asked by college
engineering students.

0. Mr. Gouldthorpe, how do you deter-
mine the‘ starting salaries you offer
graduating engineers?

A. Well, we try" to evaluate the
man’s potential worth to General
Electric. This depends on his quali-
ﬁcations and our need for those
qualiﬁcations.

Q. How do you evaluate this potential?

A._ We do it on the basis of demon-
strated scholarship and extra-curric-
ular performance, work experience,
and personal qualities as appraised
by interviewers, faculty, and other
references.

Of course, We’re not the only com-
pany looking for highly qualiﬁed
men. We’re alert to competition and
pay competitive salaries to get the
promising engineers we need.

0. When could I expect my first raise
at General Electric?

A. Our primary training programs
for engineers, the Engineering Pro-
gram, Manufacturing Program, and
Technical Marketing Program, gen-
erally grant_ raises after you’ve been
with the Company about a year.

Q. Is it an automatic raise?

A. It’s automatic only in the sense
that your salary is reviewed at that
time. Its amount, however, is not
the same for everyone. This depends
ﬁrst and foremost on how well you
have performed your assignments,
but pay changes do reflect trends in
over-all salary structure brought on
by changes in the cost of living or
other factors.

One of a series

Interview with General Electric’s

Hubert W. Gouldthorpe

Manager — Engineering Personnel

Your Salary

Q. How much is your benefit program
worth, as an addition to salary?

A. A great deal. Company beneﬁts
can be a surprisingly large part of
employee compensation. We ﬁgure
our total beneﬁt program can be
worth as much as 1/6 of your
salary, depending on the extent to
which you participate in the many
programs available at G.E. ‘

0. Participation in the programs, then,
is voluntary?

A. Oh, yes. The medical and life
insurance plan, pension plan, and
savings and stock bonus plan are all
operated on a mutual contribution
basis, and you’re not obligated to
join any of them. But they are such
good values that most of our people
do participate. They’re an excellent
way to save and provide personal
and family protection.

Q. After you’ve been with a company
like G.E. for a few years, who decides
when a raise is given and how much it
will be? How high up does this decision
have to go?

A. We review professional salaries
at least once a year. Under our
philosophy of delegating such re-
sponsibilities, the decision regarding
your raise will be made by one man
—the man you report to; subject to
the approval of only one other man
—his manager.

0. At present, what salaries do engi-
neers with ten years’ experience make?

A. According to a 1956 Survey of
the Engineers Joint Council*, engi-
neers with 10 years in the electrical
machinery manufacturing industry
were earning a median salary of
$8100, with salaries ranging up to
and beyond $15,000. At General
Electric more than two thirds of our
10-year, technical college graduates
are earning above this industry

median. This is because we provide
opportunity for the competent man
to develop rapidly toward the bigger
job that ﬁts his interests and makes
full use of his capabilities. As a
natural consequence, more men have
reached the higher salaried positions
faster, and they are there because of
the high value of their contribution.

I hope this answers the question

- you asked, but I want to emphasize

again that the salary you will be
earning depends on the value of
your contribution. The effect of such
considerations as years of service,
industry median salaries, etc., will be
insigniﬁcant by comparison. It is
most important for you to pick a job
that will let you make the most of
your capabilities.

Q. Do you have one salary plan for
professional people in engineering and
a different one for those in managerial
work?

A. No, we don’t make such a
distinction between these two im-
portant kinds of work. We have an
integrated salary structure which
covers both kinds of jobs, all the way
up to the President’s. It assures pay
in accordance with actual individual
contribution, whichever avenue a
man may choose to follow.
