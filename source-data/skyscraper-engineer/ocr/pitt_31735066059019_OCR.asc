Westinghouse needs engineers
with oceans of knowledge

Our Deepstar manned submersible
can explore down to 4,000 ft. We're
designing one to go 20,000. Our
scanning sonar makes "sound" im-
ages of the ocean floor and anything
on it. Our Oceanographic Labora-
tory on Chesapeake Bay is the
world's"largest.

What does all this have to do with

or knowledge of oceans.

electricity? Just as much as rebuild-
ing slum areas, teaching the hard-
core unemployed and desalting the

oceans. Westinghouse is deep in all

of them.

We're also developing a "fast
breeder" reactor and building a
nuclear space engine. Plus, of
course, everything connected with

electricity, practical or theoretical.

But everything’s not perfect. We
need your help for our biggest

“I don’t want to  
wait for someone
to die or retire
in order to
et promoted?’

We’re with you.

Because at IH we believe a promotion is
something you earn. Not some kind of hand—me-down
just to ﬁll an empty slot.

That’s why you’ll have to be "a thinker. A doer.
An innovator. The kind of guy who prefers to be promoted
on his merits alone.

You’ll need talent. Lots of imagination.
And plenty of guts. The guts to make decisions
and ﬁght for your ideas.

We, in turn, will give you plenty of freedom
—and excitement, too.

So you’ll learn a lot. (Maybe even teach us a thing or two.)

What’s more, if you join us,

you’ll be part of a diversiﬁed company. One where
there’s plenty of action in farm equipment,

motor trucks, construction and steelmaking.

And you’ll also ﬁnd We’re banking heavily on research.
(We’ve got some pretty far—out ideas on computers in trucks,
laser beam construction equipment,

applications of solar energy and nuclear power.)

As a result, We’re looking for test, design, manufacturing
and research engineers. We need accountants and
production management people. And we need sales people
for our wholesale and retail operations.

S_o talk to your campus placement oﬂicer about us.
He’ll ﬁll you in on the jobs we want to ﬁll.

With minds, not bodies.

How to keep

a cow’s mind on milk.

Instead of flies.

An informal report on a few current projects at Shell. Some of them might seem like offbeat
work for an oil company. But this is a company that contributes broadly and significantly to society.
A company of experts that brings out the best in its engineering, scientific and business people.

J Shell scientists
have.come up with
a vast improve-
ment over even
"— ""' the most talented
cow tail. lt’s called VAPONA®'in-
secticide. A plastic strip impreg-
nated with it will kill flies in a cow
stall for up to three months. And
VAPONA'?'9 insecticide combined
with CIODRIN"-it insecticide keeps
cows fly-free 24 hours a day—
even out in pasture. Give you
ideas for further applications?

  

Energy from under the sea 

Shell is heading
into ever—deeper
waterinthesearch
for oil and natural
gas. Recently we ,
designed and installed permanent
drilling/production platforms as
tall as a 34-story building, with

still bigger structures in the works.
And we are operating in con-
siderably deeperwater from float-
ing platforms. We are also search-
ing on land in 16 states to help
meet burgeoning energy needs.

Digestible detergents

, The main trouble
with detergents
is they don’t go
away. They pol-
lutestreams,make
fresh water foamy. The solution:
detergent compounds that orga-
nisms can consume. These “bio-
degradab|es” clean clothes just
as effectively, but keep streams
free of detergent foam. Elsewhere
in the chemical part of our busi-
ness, Shell research has resulted
in a wealth of plastics for home
and industry, and fertilizers to
alleviate food shortages.

 

The name of the game
More gasoline per
barrel of crude
oil delights engi-
neers, scientists
and conservation-
ists alike. Our new hydrocrackers
actually produce more than a gal-

 

lon of refined product from a gal-
ion of feed stock. And we are using
sophisticated techniquestotai|or-
make products by reassernbling
hydrocarbon molecules.

The pursuit of excellence leads
Shell into a variety of fields, both
on and off the beaten track for an
oil company. If you have a more-
than-one-track mind, a desire to
explore, to pit your skills against
many kinds of problems, there
could be a place for you in Shell.

Perhaps your training in engi-
neering, science or business can
contribute to tomorrow’s new
developments. For information
about openings throughout Shell

Letters . . .
to the Editor“

We got letters!

I had access to your October issue and found many
interesting items; not the least of which was the crossword
puzzle. '

Susan B. Stevenson
Evans City, Pa.

I was interested in the article written by Dennis E.
Bihary, “The rebirth of the Electric Car.” Our company has
been keenly interested in developments in this ﬁeld.

Between two and three years ago West Penn Power Com-
pany constructed an experimental electric car. The car was
built under the direction of one of our vice presidents, Mr.
W. E. Sturm. The car has been driven to various locations
in our service area and has appeared in numerous exhibits.

H. E. King
Greensburg, Pa.

Alleciric . . . Tomorrow's Car Today

The “Allectric” was built by West Penn Power Com-
pany to demonstrate the practicality of a short range electric
automobile and the possibilities that exist with materials and
knowledge already at hand.

The “Allectric” was produced under the direction of
William E. Sturm, vice president.

Mr. Sturm points out that West Penn Power is not :1
car manufacturer, but has an interest in promoting the de-
velopment of electric automobiles as a potential market‘ for
increased electric sales and as one solution to the problem of
air pollution.

The “Allectric” is designed for limited range service.
The booklet “Automobile Facts and Figures” published by
the Automobile Manufacturers Association reports that 60%
of car trips are less than 5 miles . . . almost half of the use of
cars is going to work . . . the one—way trip is about 6 to 10
miles . . . and over half the cars contain only the driver.

Mr. Sturm points out that most of the air pollution (that
comes from cars) is being created by this group of drivers
who, in today’s strangled traﬂic pattern, neither go very far
nor very fast. This, he says, makes a ready-made market
for the producer of a short range, agile vehicle.

Previous attempts to reach this market have been unsuc-
cessful because the conventional internal explosion vehicle

A Look at the Workings of

Study Group 11

Soon after Dr. Hoelscher became dean of the School of
Engineering in 1965, he initiated various committees to
study and evaluate many phases in the operation of the
School of Engineering. These committees, after two years
of work, are now presenting their findings covering subjects
which range from Engineers’ Week to the school’s new
curriculum. Some of the most important work was done
by Study Group II under the chairmanship of Dr. Stuart
of the Chemical Engineering Department which evaluated
the old curriculum and came up with the new curriculum
initiated this year. The complete revision of the curriculum
has solved many problems that existed within the School of
Engineering while at the same time it has created some
new problems.

Under the new course schedule, freshmen needing a
stronger basis in math and chemistry will enter Pitt in the
summer term so that they may begin the fall term with
Math 22 and Chemistry 15 as will their peers. Of course, the
students’ working ability and earning power in a summer
job is severely hampered but it perhaps is better that all
freshmen begin their college careers on schedule. For their
freshman and sophomore years, students will adhere to a
standard curriculum including four four—credit courses
(limited to engineering students) per term. In these courses
engineering students will get the fundamentals in engineer-
ing science as well as humanities and social sciences. Study
Group II wisely realized that electives are too important in
today’s education to be left to ‘the whim of the student’
or to the convenience in his schedule. Thus, Study Group II
has initiated the ‘elective’ courses designed to provide a
solid basis in social sciences and humanities as well as
writing. It is important to note that these courses will
emphasize writing and will continuously demand written

‘I0

material from the students. Two drawbacks of this new
curriculum are (1) the complete separation of engineering
students from students in the College of Arts and Sciences
and (2) problems have arisen with regard to changes in
major. For the present, all the engineering courses (except
physical education) are limited to engineering students, and
engineering students can not take courses in the College until
their junior year. The most critical problems arise, however,
when a student decides to transfer into or out of engineering.
Study Group II, in their report fails to mention this problem.
For a student transferring from engineering to liberal arts,
how many engineering credits. will he lose and which ones
will they be? And for a student switching to engineering,
will he have to begin again as though he were a freshman?

The new concept behind many of these changes is the
growing realization that engineering is science for people.
People are the ones for whom engineering exists. And so
the importance of good communication is made more
evident for it is through communication that understanding
occurs. Dean Hoelscher has shown that he understands; he
has initiated investigations and new programs in the School
of Engineering. He has communicated and he communi-
cates. He works with the administration, the faculty, and
the students. We owe thanks to Dean Hoelscher for his
initiative and interest is not only keeping Pitt’s engineering
school up with other schools and with current demands,
it is helping set the pace in education.

Floods have been many things to many people. In early
Biblical times, Noah and his followers considered the great
deluge the manifestation of a wrathful God.

To the 500,000,000 people in the far East, floods have pro-
vided plains and deltas upon which to subsist in spite of the
life—long threat of death by drowning. In the United States
floods probably stimulate more interest among more diverse
groups that any other natural phenomenon.

To the reporters and editors of the daily press ﬂoods are
dramatic news, while to those caught in the swirling mud-
laden waters they represent days and nights of terror.

To personnel of the Red Cross, National Guard, Civil
Defense, or to citizens hurriedly pressed into service to pro-
vide food, clothing and shelter or to carry sandbags, floods
mean an immediate call to action——a summons that is gladly
met.

To engineeers and hydrologists ﬂoods mean the immedi-
ate translation of measurementsvof precipitation, snow-melt,
temperature, and ground conditions into volumes of water
and then converted into heights of water referenced to par-
ticular river gages. If- the danger is overestimated the fore-
casting service may -become discredited; if it is underestimated

the result may be additional ﬂood damage and perhaps loss
of life.

The function of a river forecasting service is to provide
advanced info.rmation on future river and reservoir levels, for
both short and extended periods. This must be done with
speed and efficiency, so that necessary early action may be
initiated to save lives and property, and to permit sound
planned management of water control structures. Current
hydrometeorological data must be available promptly to per-
form this function. Reports on reservoir levels and releases
and the proposed schedule of future releases are required by
the forecaster in day-to-day operations. Reports from all res-
ervoirs are needed, regardless of the reservoir size. Of the
19,100 square miles of drainage in the Pittsburgh River Dis-
trict above Pittsburgh, about 30% of the area is controlled
by Corps of Engineers flood control dams, so that the oper4
ation of these control structures is of great importance in
the forecasting of river stages.

Certain-ly one set of rules cannot be written to be applied
to all river systems in the United States. Each system must
be considered according to the multiplicity of purposes of
the project. In a multipurpose reservoir system, the demands
of conflicting water interest must be compromised. For in-
stance, navigation interests need sufficient depth in the riv-

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER — DEC. I968

ers; power interests desire maximum head; flood control in-
terests desire minimum pool elevation, recreation interests
would like full and nonvarying pools, downstream pollution
sources need assurance of water availability for low—flow
augmentation; health officials might need to fluctuate the
reservoir levels for malaria control; and irrigators want to
be assured of an adequate supply. Special operation require-
ments also must be considered. Some of these are industrial
needs, ﬁsh spawning, control of aquatic plant growth, emer-
gency construction and the fisherman himself.

The Pittsburgh River District is comprised of the Alle-
gheny and Monongahela Rivers and the upper Ohio River
below Pittsburgh downstream as far as Wheeling, W. Va.
It is a 26,000 square-mile area and could well be considered
the “Nation’s Industrial Might,” forﬁin this area are many
large steel mills, important coal mines, and numerous navi-
gation interests. Periodically, the Monongahela River outstrips
the Panama Canal’s tonnage. In 1964 Dravo Corporation of
Pittsburgh carried almost 54,600,000 tons of diversiﬁed mater-
ials on the Pittsburgh reaches ofthe Allegheny, Mononga-
hela and Ohio Rivers. Also in 1964 the Monongahela carried
greater tonnage than the Mississippi River from Minneapolis
to the mouth of the Missouri——-37,000,000 tons compared to
34,000,000 tons. Pittsburgh, truly, is an inland waterway ton-
nage leader. The vast number of cities and towns with their
industries located along the river banks emphasize the im-
portance and untold value of river forecasts.

Water is both friend and foe of mankind‘. Harnessed and
properly used it is one of man’s greatest allies; in flood time,
out of control, it can become a terrifying enemy, destroying
life, natural resources, and all structures in its path and caus-
ing serious damage and hardships. Snowmelt is a major
factor of Hood runoff in the Pittsburgh River District and
ice gorges present a dangerous problem during the winter
months in the Allegheny River Basin.

Perfect river forecasts are of little value unless given wide-
spread, elfective and timely dissemination, and unless local
interests take precautionary measures to minimize or pre-
vent flood damage.

An adequate River Forecasting Service is as vital a fac-
tor in flood control plans as are dams, levees and channel
improvements. Probably no feature of flood control planning
can offer as much potential economic value, at low initial
cost, as can river forecasting. “To be forewarned is to be
forearmed” applies to floods no less than to fires or other
disasters.

ESSA (Environmental Science Services Administration)
exists to provide scientiﬁc services. This agency, of which
the Weather Bureau is a part, must always be alert to op-
portunities for serving the public’s needs quickly, convenient-
ly and pleasantly. Each individual contact—by telephone, by
letter, or in person-—presents such an opportunity. We have
an obligation to be courteous, to avoid confusing terminol-
ogy, to improve our correspondence in both content and
speed of handling, and to give careful and competent at-
tention to the problems of all who deal with ESSA.

The success of the Weather Bureau and the River Fore-
casting Service is mainly dependent upon a well—educated
public and good human relations. Good human relations is
a matter of forming habits of thinking and acting that make
people like us, trust us, and believe in us. It’s a matter of
cultivating simple habits that make others like to deal with
us — simple habits of friendliness, dependability, sincerity,
cheerfulness, and honesty. Good human relations is also a
matter of understanding people and their problems, of being
considerate, of being tolerant of others, and of sharing with
them. It’s an attitude of being willing and anxious to help

‘I4

others live more fully, to help them grow and make the best
of their lives. Without good human and public relations a
river forecasting service, in spite of well-trained personnel
and up—to—date techniques, cannot hope to excel or to serve
the public effectively.

It is not enough for us merely to exist. It is not enough
to say we are earning enough to live and support our fami-
lies; that we do our work well; that we are good fathers
and husbands; that we are good churchmen. We must give
time to our fellow—man over and above the normal call of
duty. Even it it's a little thing during an emergency we must
do something for those who have need of us, something for
which we get no pay but the privilege of doing it. There is
nothing better than serving others to the best of our ability.

We must remember that we don’t live in a world of our]
own—our brothers are here too, and all the good we can do
to alleviate the suffering and hardships caused by Hoods and
other disasters, we must do now, for we pass this way but
once.

Quoting an old proverb—“Help thy brother’s boat across
the river, and, lo, thine own has reached the shore.”

SKYSCRAPER-ENGINEER — DEC. I968

Mr. Vernon T. Houghton, ]r., is Supervisory Hydrolo-
gist for the Federal-State River Forecasting Service, Weather
Bureau Oﬂice, Pittsburgh. Mr. Houghton graduated from
Schenley High School and from the University of Pittsburgh
in June 1932 with a B.S. degree in civil engineering. He
then did graduate work in hydrology at Iohn Hopkins Uni—
versity and in radar meteorology at Miami University.

Upon graduation from Pitt Vernon Houghton was em-
ployed by the Pennsylvania Drilling Company in foundation
explorations. He has also worked on stream gaging for
the U. S. Geological Survey, hydrologic investigations for
the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, and on
flood control for the Corps of Engineers. This involved a
two—year assignment in Canada and Alaska on the construc-
tion of the Alcan Highway. Mr. Houghton has been Chief
River Forecaster in Pittsburgh since March, 1947. For meri—
torious service, Vernon Houghton received the “Silver Medal
Award”'in 1958 from the Department of Commerce.

Mr. Houghton’s principle interest is in sports having
participated in track while attending Pitt. His specialty in
track was the 440 yard dash, the long jump and the hurdles.

“IBM is so involved in the electronics
field, I’d always assumed they
weren’t particularly interested in
M.E.’s,” says Andy Simon.

Andy got his M.E. degree in 1967.
He’s now a packaging engineer in
memory development at IBM.

Andy found out why IBM needs good
mechanical engineers when he went
to his campus interview. As elec-
tronic packaging gets smaller and
packaging density increases, a lot of
new problems arise. And the M.E.
has to solve them.

As Andy says, “When I design the
hardware package for a micro-
electronic memory u.nit, I deal with
heattransfer and otherthermal prob-

  
   

lems, vibration and shock analysis,
and electromagnetic compatibility.
The associated connector design
work gets me into stress and creep
analysis and Hertz contact stress
and evaluation.”

Then comes production

That's only part of Andy’s job. After
his team designs, develops, and pro-
duces a prototype memory unit, he
has to work closely with manufactur-
ing engineers, advising them on
machines and processes to mass-
produce the unit.

“lt’s tough but rewarding work,” says
Andy, “because the problems change
with each new assignment. So an
M.E. gains a lot of experience fast.

‘‘It never crossed
my mind that IBM
wanted Mechanical

Engineersi’

The kind of experience that helps
him move ahead fast.”

There’s a new renaissance in Western Pennsylvania—a
renaissance of the rivers.

A group of private citizens, calling themselves the Three
Rivers Improvement and Development Corporation (TRI-
AD), has organized a popular effort to beautify, improve
and develop the three major rivers—the Allegheny, the Mon-
ongahela and the Ohio.

Incorporated earlier this year as a non-proﬁt, civic organi-
zation, TRIAD has gained much of the kind of support
from the area’s business community that made Pittsburgh’s
renaissance possible two decades ago.

Arthur V. Harris, TRIAD’s president, says that the sup-
port of Western Pennsylvania’s business community really is
a natural. “Clean streams and attractive river fronts beneﬁt
everybody,” Harris said, “and a good businessman knows it.
We have a lot of good businessmen in Western Pennsylvania,
and just about all of them know that TRIAD’s program is
well worth their ﬁnancial and moral support.”

TRIAD’s program is designed to restore the usefulness
of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers to all the
people of Western Pennsylvania. The organization reasons
that there is no part of the country with such a great river
resource, and it should be enjoyed and used by everybody.

Harris, who is manager of Industry Affairs for the Gulf
Oil Corporation, has led TRIAD through an active summer
of getting acquainted with the people of Western Pennsyl-
vania and reawakening their interest in the rivers.

To direct attention to the rivers and their uses, TRIAD
sponsored an aquatic show of grand dimensions in June of
this year. Speedboat racers came to Pittsburgh from far and
wide to demonstrate their skill at handling their craft at
speeds up to 100 miles an hour. Six different ski clubs dis-
played their wares during the two days of water activities,
which TRIAD called River Renaissance Weekend. An esti-
mated 150,000 spectators also were treated to the first pre-
Olympic warm-up crew race ever held on the Allegheny
River. It featured the eight—oared heavyweight crews of the
New York Athletic Club and the Vesper Athletic Club of
Philadelphia, the winner of the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo.

The Pittsburgh Safe Boating Committee was a cooperat-
ing agency in developing the weeekend show, and water
safety demonstrations were not overlooked. Also included
was an air-sea rescue demonstration by a U. S. Coast Guard
“flying boat”. The Pennsylvania Fish Commission’s three
new patrol boats, “The Allegheny River,” “The Mononga-
hela River,” and “The Ohio River” were christened by Miss
TRIAD, who had been selected from among 45 Western
Pennsylvania beauties who entered the Three Rivers Beauty
Contest held in connection with the event. TRIAD also
sponsored a fishing contest that ran for two weeks leading
up to the weekend with the assistance of the State Fish Com-
mision, which stocked the Allegheny river especially for the
contest. The rivers’ cultural potential received due attention,
too, with a special river symphony performed by the inter-
nationally known American Wind Symphony Orchestra of
Pittsburgh.

River Renaissance Weekend also included a boat parade
that brought out the tow boats, for which the area is well
known among river people the world over, for their first
participation in a public event in many years. The Pittsburgh

24

area’s towing—hauling industry remains one of the most im-
portant in the world, daily transporting more tonnage past
The Point in Pittsburgh than goes through the Panama
Canal.

Putting them back on public display, including one old stern-
wheeler, “The Winnie Mae”, that is still in use, was just
the right touch of nostalgia for many Western Pennsylvan-
ians during the fun—ﬁlled weekend. The big tows that led
the parade of small and large pleasure boats from through-
out Western Pennsylvania included: “The Iohn H. Elliott”
(U.S. Steel Corporation); “The Titan” (Jones & Laughlin
Steel Corporation); “The Jesse B. Guttman” (Mon River
Towing, Inc.); “The D. L. Iohnson” (Campbell Barge Line,
Inc.); “The Myra I-I.” (Marine Sales & Service); “The Ark-
wright” (Twin Rivers Towing Co.); as well as the Monon-
gahela & Ohio Dredging Company’s sternwheeler, “The
Winnie Mae”.

Lawrence Block

“It was a weekend of fun,” Mr. Harris points out, “but
with a serious purpose. We wanted to get people thinking
about their rivers and the great potential they have for im-
provement and expanded usefulness. But we have been
pleasantly surprised throughout the summer over the inter-
est that is already there. We have found the desire to
improve our riverfronts has been there all the time. All it
needed, apparently, was for someone to take the lead and
channel this desire into a constructive program, and that’s
what TRIAD plnas to do.”

TRIAD is working on a set of long-range plans for the
rivers that may take ten years or longer to accomplish, but
also recently organized a Start-Now Committee for River
Renaissance to identify improvement, development and beau-
tification projects that ca.n be started immediately.

TRIAD has also hired a full-time Executive Secretmgy,
Lawrence G. Block. Block, 32, is a long—time area boatsman
who helped plan the recent development of the Harbor Isle
Marina in Blawnox. Larry is Chairman of the Pittsburgh
Safe Boating Committee and Vice Commander in the U. S.

Coast Guard Auxiliary.

TRIAD’s objective is to harness the productive energy
of people in all walks of life to contribute their time, energies
and ideas to the beautification, improvement and develop—
ment of the rivers and rivcrbanks. The accomplishment of
TRIAD’s goals will mean clean, unpolluted waters; walks,
parks and picnic areas on the river banks; public access areas
and many other innovations. It will invite a renewed aware-
ness of the rivers’ value to Western Pennsylvania as useful
and enjoyable arteries, surging with the lifeblood of an ener-
getic and lively community of people.

“TRIAD operates under the assumption,” Mr. Harris
says, “that an important body of law has already been writ-

ten that will assure, with the increasing cooperation of the ‘

business community, that the State’s waterways will be clean
and more useable for recreation. State, federal and local
governments have been working successfully in that regard
with private industry. Now it is time to bring the rivers
back into the active life of the total community, and that is

the job TRIAD has set for itself.”

One of the roles TRIAD can play to help accomplish its
purpose is by serving as a coordinating agency to bring to
fruition the combined imaginaton and ePforts of the various
groups and individuals who have and will concern them-
selves with the development of a Western Pennsylvania com-
munity with interest centered in the enjoyment and utility
of the three rivers.

To this end, the Corporation will continually study and
propose new ways and means to improve and develop the
rivers, and generally make them more useful to the people
of the area.

TRIAD will serve as a center of information regarding
the needs of the communities, persons and commerce along
the rivers, to help focus attention on methods available to
realize their potential to the total society.

It will serve, not only as a catalyst to fire the combined
energies of the business, labor, academic and governmental
communities of the area, but also to participate in accom-
plishing the Corporation’s objectives and goals.

The Corporation sets forth for itself a variety of goals
designed to produce progressively cleaner rivers and more
useful and attractive riverbanks to encourage and lead the
people of Western Pennsylvania to want to live, work and
play along the rivers.

The Three Rivers Improvement and Development Cor-
poration (TRIAD) assumes the task of continuously pro-
moting the beautiﬁcation, development and utility of the
three rivers and shorelines for the beneﬁt and welfare of the
entire community so that they may be used to the fullest
extent for the Welfare of the people, the City of Pittsburgh,
the Tri-State area and the United States.

RESEARCH AT PITT

featuring K url lewis, PILD.

Throughout man’s history, soil has been used as a con-

struction material. Stable foundations had to be provided.

for buildings, highways, dams and retaining structures, how-
ever, it was not until the advent‘ of the pioneering studies of
Karl Terzaghi during the early part of this century that the
study and use of soil met with scientiﬁc treatment. Today,
soil mechanics is considered to be that branch of Civil Engi-
neering which uses the laws of mechanics and hydraulics to
study the behavior of soil under various force systems. Now
the term soil (as used by the civil engineer) includes all un-
consolidated sediments and deposits derived from the disin-
tegration of mat-ter; and as such, soil is not only the oldest
and most complex building material (heterogeneous, aniso-
tropic, three-phase system), but in reality it is the “garbage”
of the world. Generally speaking, the study of soil mechanics
covers three major areas, and here at Pitt we are directing
our research efforts towards these areas, namely: the move-
ment of water through soil, deformation of soil masses and
stability of soil masses.

In the area of seepage, it is a well-known fact that con-
ventional methods of solution such as the graphic method
of How nets often lead to serious deﬁciencies in that they
fail -to predict all flow characteristics with a fair degree of
accuracy. This is the case with the available solution to the
problem of seepage into an excavation in a soil of ﬁnite
depth. Recently, we have been able to use this method of
conformal mapping to obtain a closed form solution to this
problem and to develop useful design charts for the practic-
ing engineer. At the present time, the results are being com-
pared with those using the method of ﬁnite element and in
the near future the solution will be extended to account for
nonhomogeneous and anisotropic soil conditions. This pro-
ject is being sponsored by SRCC funds.

Another objective of current research investigation in
the Department of Civil Engineering, is the development of
a reliable analytical method for predicting the magnitude
and time-dependent distribution of settlements and pore
pressures within and underneath earth embankments. This
study which is being sponsored by the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Highways and the Bureau of Public Roads employs
the ﬁnite element technique and will have bearing on such
problems as: (1) the stability during and after construction

30

of highway embankments; (2) the excessive and often times
damaging settlements occurring in stretches of highways
where the enbankments have been constructed over terrain
with radically varying subsurface conditions. The analytical
tools developed during this ﬁrst year will be veriﬁed in the
second and subsequent years by fullscale ﬁeld studies. Need-
less to say, laboratory investigation is also being currently
carried out to evaluate the parameters being used in the
above .theory.

Slope stability research is focused on four areas: (1) the
development of computer programs for stability analyses of
slopes in soil and rock; (2) case studies of actual slope fail-
ures in order to investigate the failure mechanisms and back
calculate the strength of the slope—forming material at failure;
(3) laboratory investigations of the strength behavior of
slope—forming soil and rock materials; (4) ﬁeld studies of
the influence of geologic factors such as structure, strati-
graphy and mineralogy, on the stability of soil and rock
slopes. Research in areas (1) and (2) is being supported by
the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines. Com-
puter programs for two limiting equilibrium methods of
slope stability analysis have been developed and these pro-
grams are now being used to analyze slope failures in open
pit mines. Research in areas (2) and (4) is being supported
by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways and the
Bureau of Public Roads in the form of a joint project with
the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. This pro-
ject involves the study of rock slopes in highway cuts in
western and central Pennsylvania and the ultimate goal is
the development of more rational methods of highway rock

slope design.

Research has also been directed towards the development
of concrete slab models whereby static as well as dynamic
loads, subgrade reactions and pertinent boundary conditions
could be evaluated. The slabs are supported on a soil foun-
dation and are subjected to warping and other causes of
partial support. Along with this experimental work, theo-
retical models which account for soil—structure interaction
are being developed using the method of ﬁnite element
analysis. Finally, the experimental and theoretical results of
this project which is supported by NASA will be compared
and a theory will be developed whereby pavements and
circular slabs used as launching pads could be analyzed.

Can there be this kind of excitement in engineering?

You’ve forgotten the rising long before dawn and the drive along
deserted roads. Now the morning is still and crisp; the waist-high
weeds are perfect cover. You work through them carefully, quietly,
expectantly. Then—the multi-colored explosion of a ﬂushed bird*,
beating up in a blur of speed and sound. The over-and-under is at
your shoulder by pure reﬂex. . .you lead and squeeze...

This is the age-old excitement of the hunt, the instant coordination of
mind and muscle against the ﬁnely-honed instincts of your game.
Engineering offers a kindred excitement, or should. The stalking of
ideas, the shooting down of tough and wily technical obstacles, the
well-trained engineering mind against the complexities of nature.

But too often today, this excitement is lost in routine and fragmented
assignments or a company climate in which engineering is taken for
granted. Which is why, if you’re hunting for professional excitement,
it’s worth looking into the opportunities at Xerox. Your degree in
Engineering or Science can qualify you for some intriguing openings

f. Evaluation of Executive Committee Performance

At this same meeting, Alumni Director, Mr. Bernard
Koperek, announced that the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER
planned to mail a complimentary copy to all Engineering
Fund donors with an invitation to subscribe.

The second meeting of the Executive Committee was
held on October 15, 1968. At this meeting Mr. A. H. Crook-
ston, reporting for the Recruitment of High School Seniors
Committee observed that the programs appeared to be going
in two directions at one time. On the one hand, there was
assistance in recruiting seniors who had been accepted for
admission by the University. On the other hand, there was
attraction of students to engineering, whether they might
attend Pitt or some other school. With the approval of Dean
Hoelscher, the committee would proceed to prepare a pro-
gram describing engineering as a profession for presentation
before high school students.

is too heavy for the amount ofibatteries that can be stuPfed
in the trunk. A successful electric auto must be designed
from the ground up, and not be an adaptation of an existing
auto, according to Mr. Sturm.

The “Allectric” is this kind of car. This “little red
wagon” is a nimble quiet performer that can do 50 miles an
hour and has gone as far as 50 miles wit-hout a battery
charge. Much of its success results from the use of specially
designed solid state speed control and charging. equipment.

“We don’t know a thing about, building cars,” says Mr.
Sturm. “We did the best we could with our limited facili-
ties. The possibilities would have been far greater if we
had access to the know—how and facilities of battery makers,
electronic experts, aluminum or plastic body builders and
the like.

“We have registered the trademark ‘Allectric.’ When
the car in front of you is an Allectric, you can breathe
easier. By the way, we think our plug—in parking meter has
a future, too. We think the electric carfuture is now.”

Vic Taylor is a corrosion specialist for International Nickel at its
testing lab in North Carolina.

“ . . .That old ocean doesn’t like us sometimes. She rusts boats, eats
away metals, destroys coatings . . . what we’re trying to do is
come up with alloys she can live with.”

Inco’s Harbor Island Corrosion Laboratory is testing materials
needed for ocean engineering, better desalination plants, bridges,
boats. Testing them against the sea and the seaside atmosphere.
Not just nickel alloys. But 40,000 specimens of materials from
many industries. Alloys, fabrics, coatings.

“. . . Remember how car bumpers used to corrode? Now it’s a
diﬁerent story. And boats last longer, too. Diving bells go deeper
than anybody ever dreamed of. . .”

Undreamed of advances are what Inco men are working for. Men
who develop alloys, test them, search the world for more nickel.
Nickel, the metal that makes other metals stronger, tougher, more
corrosion resistant. Nickel, its contribution is quality.

Most engineers think that a good time is going places and
undoing things.

opportunity.”

Pet. E. “Who was that?”

Chem. E. “Oh, a girl I used to sleep with.”
Pet. E. “No kidding, where?”

Chem. E. “Chem 32 lectures.”

What they really mean when they say:

Pop quiz — I forgot my lecture notes.
I will derive — I don’t remember the formula.
See me after class — It has slipped my mind.

Closed book quiz — Memorize everything including the
footnotes.

Open book quiz — Oil your slide rules and wind your
watch.

Honor system — Alternate seats.
Do odd numbered problems — The even numbered problems

will be on the test.

When the Creator was making up the world, he called
aside man and bestowed upon him 20 years of normal sex
life. Man was horriﬁed. “Only 20 years?” But the Creator
wouldn’t budge.

He called the monkey and gave him 20 years. “But I
don't need 20 years,” the monkey protested. “Ten is plenty.”

Man spoke up, “Can I have the other 10 years?” The mon-
key graciously agreed to this.

The the Creator gave the Lion 20 years. The Lion, too,
only needed 10 years. Again Man asked, “Can I have the
other 10 years?” The Lion agreed.

Then came the Donkey. He was given 20 years, but 10
years was enough for him, too. Man once more asked for
the 10 spare years and got them.

This explains why man has 20 years of normal sex life,
10 years of monkeying around, 10 years of lion about it and
10 years making an ass out o-f himself.

to marry her, and he said “No!” and lo and behold, it came
to pass. She asked another guy and he too, refused. After
asking 14 more guys she was a perfect 36. But still no one
would marry her. “Aha,” said she, “I know why! There are
too many girls who are 36-24-36. So I’ll go them one better,
and ask one more man.” So the next man she saw she
asked. “Will you marry me?” “No,” he cried, “a thousand

What MECHANICAL ENGINEERS do at Kodak

They design new products and better
performance into existing ones, ﬁgure
out the best possible ways to manufac-
ture the products; apply pure reason
through mathematical tools to make
physics serve—not oppose—human
needs; create the right physical tools,
the plants to house them, and the ser-
vices to keep them functioning; get out
into the ﬁeld, showing customers how
to get their money’s worth, and bring
back word on how to do better in the

future. Some typical assignments are
in development of automatic and semi-
automatic manufacturing equipment;
production-line layout, precision tool-
ing, and materials handling; design and
development of control units and in-
strumentation devices; creative design
of scientiﬁc, industrial, business, pro-
fessional, and amateur photographic
apparatus; economic engineering, cost
analysis, and methods engineering;
utilities and facilities engineering.

—and chemical, industrial, and electrical engineering
assignments can sound equally impersonal

Yes, it is possible to draw a lifetime’s pay without much excitement
or satisfaction. If you don’t mind it that way you’ll be easier for
the boss to handle. Just await instructions and carry them out to

the letter, docilely.

This docile—looking Kodak engineer did not
operate that way. That’s why we brag about him
below. There are others who would have made

equally good examples.

Tell us about yourself with a note to

An equal-opportunity employer

Van Putte is the name—Douglas—and
plastics* is the game. While other Kodak
engineers ﬁnd strong interest in parts of
the plastics market where a one-cent
change in price can turn failure into suc-
cess, or vice versa, Van Putte’s work is
having the effect of upgrading acrylic
polymers into better optical materials than
the great European lens makers of yore
had for fabricating their precious jewels-
and a good risk for upholding the public’s
conﬁdence of reasonable success in pic-
ture-taking. Our engineers in the South,
who work with plastics we make, spread
themselves very widely into marketing
activities; Van Putte, working with plas-
tics we buy, has done himself equal credit
by digging deeper into one circumscribed
but important engineering topic than we
think has ever been dug before. Van
Putte, born (31 years ago), brought up,
‘This word has taken on a broader, more diffuse
meaning in certain non-technical circles of con-
temporary society. Actually, we do have other

concerns than plastics, whether broadly or nar-
rowly deﬁned.

and educated in the North, likes working
in Rochester just as much as the South-
erners prefer their part of the country.

How it went: Always enjoyed math, of
course. Master’s in heat transfer and ﬂuid
ﬂow. First Kodak assignment doing, logi-
cally enough, heat-transfer calculations.
Bountiful supply of scratch pads, easy
access to pencil sharpener and computer,
no extra information on big picture into
which calculations ﬁt. Proves patience for
eight months. Then manufacturing tech-
nology department on consumer-goods
side of house decides it too could proﬁt
from a little campus-fresh sophistication
in heat-transfer analysis. Van Putte over-
joyed to accept challenge.

New single-minded assignment to learn
all he can about injection-molding proc-
ess. At least that’s how the boss’s boss
now remembers the assignment.Van Putte
remembers it a little differently. More like
“Is it the temperature that’s wrong in those
lens-molding machines? The pressure? Or
is it the ﬂow rate?” On a certain lucky day.

 
  
 

after a year or so of continuing to scratch
away for data on ﬁrst one of these param-
eters and then another, Van Putte sells a
program of fundamental studies with sen-
sors for all the injection-molding param-
eters and on their relation to the param-
eters of optical performance in the
photographic lenses produced. Thixotrop-
ic nature of polymer melt properly al-
lowed for. Feels now in retrospect it took
him too long to make his program pay
off. Others take kinder view, drink toasts
to Van Putte’s health, look forward to
next phase of his work wherein he edu-
cates injection-molding machines to know
about the optical performance of the
lenses they turn out.

Well known fact in industry that when a
program turns out well, it was the big
boss’s idea. Van Putte crafty enough to
understand that fact. Boss also crafty.
Knows better than to call in a green
young engineer and tell him to make a
quantum jump in technology. Even if
that’s what he wants done.

Bob Nerad seeks recognition

But not just for himself.

Bob was Chairman of a special Jaycee project to se-
lect the “Outstanding Young Educator” in Schenectady,
New York.

He began by rediscovering ﬁrsthand some of the Vi-
brant situations that confront young teachers. With that
background he was ready to coordinate the nominating
and judging.

Planning and coordinating come naturally to Bob.
As a Production Control Specialist with General Elec-
tric’s Medium AC Motor and Generator Department,
he keeps production lines running smoothly. Coordinat-
ing machinery, raw materials and labor is crucial to any
efﬁciently run business.

With a mechanical engineering degree from Cornell,
in 1962, and an MBA in personnel administration from
George Washington, in 1963, Bob sought to plunge

directly into meaningful work. He’d had enough theory
and simulations to last him for awhile.

At General Electric he found people that agreed with
his thinking, and what’s more, GE offered him imme-
diate responsibility via the Manufacturing Management
Program.

Electric, in R&D, design, production or technical mar-
keting. Talk to our man when he visits your campus. Or
