How two inches of steel made a yardstick

ERE is one of the busiest machines in our re-
H search laboratories. It is a constant-pressure
test lathe that quickly provides an indication of
how fast a steel can be machined.

This unique testing device consists of a standard
lathe ﬁtted with special control equipment by
which the horizontal pressure on the cutting tool
is kept constant during the machining operation.
By actually machining a test bar on this lathe and
measuring the number of revolutions necessary to
advance the cutting tool exactly two inches, we ob-
tain—in a matter of minutes—a precise record of
the steel’s machinability.

Before this development, the normal way to test
machinability was to machine a sample of steel
until the cutting tool failed. This sometimes took
days and often required more steel than was avail-
able. Now, with the constant-pressure lathe, many
steel compositions can be accurately checked in
that time.

Typical of what this has meant to steel users is
our development of MX Free-machining Bar Stock.

Bar stock is used in producing the millions of
machine parts that are made on screw machines-
those high-speed automatic machines that can
simultaneously perform many operations such as
drilling, forming, threading, chamfering and tap-
ping at a rate of 1000 or more parts per hour.
Here, machinability is of ﬁrst importance, and
often spells the difference between proﬁt and loss.

So when we set out to give the screw machine
industry steels that would have the utmost in ma-
chinability, we called on the constant-pressure
test lathe to speed up this research. With its help,
hundreds of compositions were quickly and ac-
curately screened. The result was lVlX—the fastest-
cutting Bessemer screw stock yet developed, one
that has enabled many screw machine operators
not only to increase production and red_uce tool
wear but to cut their costs as well.

The constant-pressure test is a good example of
the many research projects sponsored by United
States Steel. In the ﬁeld and in the laboratory,
U. S. Steel metallurgists are constantly at work on
problems pertaining to the manufacture and the
use of steel. United States Steel Corporation, Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania.

Board and room

“Sure. I realize there are opportunities at General

Motors. But how long will I be stuck on a drafting
board before I can take advantage of them?”

This is a very familiar question to our College
Representatives at their job conferences with engi-
neering seniors.

And—in the individual case—frankly it’s a hard
question to answer. For often first jobs for graduates
in certain phases of engineering work are at a
drafting board. And the length of time the indi-
vidual stays at a drafting board depends on many

to grow!

variables—most important being the individual’s
own talents and his ability to develop them.

But there is one general answer that can be made.
And it’s a Very recent one. At a large gathering of
General Motors engineers—many of them in top
management—others in important divisional posi-
tions—this question was asked:

“How many of you started your GM careers on a
drafting board?” The answer: practically everyone

said “I did!”

So perhaps the best reply to your query about the
duration of your drafting board experience is to
say —- “there are drafting boards and drafting
boards.” And a GM drafting board has this advan-
tage—it can lead to a secure and satisfying life work
in a company headed, in many cases, by engineers
and with a record of supplying engineers with the
equipment and the associations and the opportuni-
ties they ask to make the most of their particular
training.

May we suggest you ask any such questions of our
College Representative. Your College Placement
Oﬂice can arrange a meeting with him on his next
visit to your campus. Or drop us a line.

Some examples of the many shapes of bends needed

Scoring and cutting rule steel is a cold-rolled
specialty steel for use in preparing dies for cutting

paper, leather, rubber and other materials.

It is a pre-tempered product manufactured by
skilled workmen, using precision rolling and hard-
ening equipment, to close limits for chemistry,
grain size and hardness. This product must also be
capable of meeting intricate bend requirements in

the hardened and tempered condition.

This specialty is furnished with round edges and
in coil form to the rule manufacturer who grinds
the edges — the one edge square and the other to a
knife edge as well as cutting the material into de-
sired lengths. This is sold to a die-maker who bends
the rule to the required shape. This is then the
nucleus of a pre-hardened die, which when properly
brazed and supported is used to cut out material for
display cards — aircraft parts — pocketbooks —

wallets — gloves — gaskets — washers.

To a Young Man

who

wants “Room to Grow”

That’s one of the attractions of the oil busi-
ness as a career: big and substantial though it
is today, prospects are that it has a long way
yet to grow.

The discovery of new sources of petroleum
and new uses for petroleum has gone ahead
faster during the past ﬁve years than in any
other comparable period. Phillips Petroleum
Company gross income increased from $222
million in 1946 to $611 million in 1951. And
8,300 new job opportunities were created.

The primary business of Phillips Petroleum

Company is producing, reﬁning and marketing
fuels and lubricants. Yet Phillips is one of the
most widely diversified oil companies, and we
offer opportunities for the technical graduate
in many other ﬁelds: development of chemical
derivatives from petroleum, ammonia and sul-
fur compounds, rubber synthesis, atomic re-
search, geophysics and analytical techniques.

Ifyou’re looking for a “career with a future”
we invite you to write to our Employee Rela-
tions Department for further information
about opportunities with our company.

INK FROM THE EDITOR'S PEN

It has become quite commonplace for Pitts-
burghers to hear about the Medical School and
others in connection with the university, but how
often do they hear about our engineering school
and its activities? Not very often. What incentive
do we have as undergraduates to bind us as future
active members of the Engineering and Mines
Alumni Association? Not very much. But It
needn't continue this way.

No, we don't have a patent-medicine cure for
this ailment, but we do have a suggestion that
will partially remedy the situation; this is the
presentation of an Engineer’s Week preferably
around Saint Patrick’s Day. St. Pat, the patron
saint of engineering, is considered as the world’s
first engineer due to his feat of driving the snakes
from Ireland.

Our program does not have to take a full
week but it must fulfill two criteria: one, provide
the incentive mentioned above and two, benefit
the engineering school. Although this qualifies
many events, a few are seriously needed.

One “must” is an open house for high school
students and their parents. In conjunction with
this, alumni and parents of the undergrads should
also be invited. A second “must” is having the
Engineering and Mines Dance during this period,
possibly on St. Patrick’s Day. This can be made
to have even more appeal by conducting a contest
for an Engineer’s Queen.

There are many other possibilities. High on
this list is inter-departmental activities, athletic
or otherwise, Here also can be the annual ban-
quet of the E. & M. Alumni Association.

8

Our pet idea is a senior banquet. This ban-
quet, open only to seniors and faculty, will honor
those graduating. At the present, three or four
departments hold their own banquets separately
but they are exceedingly willing to combine and
hold a huge one. This dinner could bring a sense
of comaraderie as nothing else possibly could. It
would be relatively easy to get a top-notch speaker
as any large company would welcome this op-
portunity to be represented, since it would be the
only combined meeting of all the graduating
seniors. This would be only one of the many events
possible during this celebration,

But the Skyscraper Engineer can not organ-
ize an Engineer’s Week. If we are to have one
this year or any year, it must be under the direc-
tion of the Engineering and Mines Association for
this group represents all the E. & M. students. It
is a responsibility that the E. & M. Association
must assume for this is larger and more import-
ant than anything previously accomplished by
that organization.

The E. & M. Association cannot accomplish
this without support, both from the administra-
tion and the students. Administration support is
assured, student support is needed. There must
be many volunteers for this is too big to be
handled by only a few. With this in mind, the
Editors and staff of the Skyscraper Engineer
pledge their full support in the undertaking.

We hope that enough people feel the same
about this as we do so that, in March, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh will celebrate its first annual
Engineer’s Week.

Meet Leonard Harris and read his story. In many re-
spects, the problems he had may parallel yours today.
He made his decision six years ago, and he’s glad he did.

Leonard Harris graduated from Ohio State University
in 1943 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After
serving in the armed forces, he began looking into the
organizations that offered promising civilia.n careers.
And although he had many attractive offers, he chose
Columbia-Southern because it gave him the opportunity
to start training immediately in the ﬁeld for which he
felt most qualiﬁed. In his case, that ﬁeld was plant

. operation.

Harris sa s, “I recalled the instructors in school had a
high regar for Columbia-Southern. I knew the parent
company, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, and was favorably
impressed with it. Also, I was quite impressed with the
sincere, down-to—ear‘th attitude of the peo le with whom
I made my initial contact and I wasn't isappointed on
that score after joining the company."

Today, Leonard Harris is an important part of Columbia-
Southern’s management team. As superintendent of the
Chlorine Area in the Barberton Plant the following de-
partments come under his direct supervision: Chlorine,
Caustic Soda, Pittchlor, Sodium Hypochlorite, Per-
chlorethylene.

Harris feels that a technical graduate should look for
the following (1) a company in which he can produce
and get rea.’ satisfaction from his work, (2) a company
where opportunities are obvious, and (3) a company
which shows no trace of employee stagnancy.

Columbia—Southern is such a company. We will be
glad to discuss your interests. This pertains to graduates
in all business and technical ﬁelds including engineering,
research and development, sales, plant design, mining,
construction, maintenance, production, accounting, trans-
portation and related ﬁelds.

Much has been said about the shortage of
engineers in the last several years. The shortage
is real and is expected to continue, at least,
through the next ten years. This has caused an
unprecedented recruiting program by industry, a
steady increase in starting salaries and other in-
ducements,

Meanwhile many qualified high school stu-
dents have gone into industry instead of college
because of their inability to finance a college ed-
ucation. These individuals are most eager to be-
come students of engineering and cooperative en-
gineering courses fill this need. However, only a
few schools in the county have been able to con-
tinue cooperative engineering programs through-
out industrial depressions. The University of
Cincinnati has conducted one of the most success-
ful programs because of its location in an area
with many diversified industries.

The Schools of Engineering and Mines at the
University of Pittsburgh conducted a cooperative
course through the 1920’s but it was forced to
drop it in 1929 because of the depression. Pitts-
burgh industries are now much more diversified
and because of the shortage of engineers, a new
form of cooperative engineering education was
started this year in the Schools of Engineering
and Mines. This program can be finished in six
and one-half to seven years while the student is
employed continuously on a part-time basis.

The students must meet all of the entrance
requirements which are specified for the regular
four year full-time students. The courses taken
in the program are identical to those taken by reg-
ular students, in fact, both types of students may
be in the same classes.

One unique feature of the program is that the
curricula have been rearranged into two parts or
steps. With the exception of two semesters of
English, , only science and basic engineering
courses are taken in the first part. Mathematics,
chemistry, physics, engineering drawing, machine
design, applied mechanics and strength of mater-
ials, together with one or two courses of special-
ized engineering, constitute about 70 credits or
one-half the course requirements for the Bachelor
of Science degree.

The second part consists of the liberal arts
and specialized advanced engineering courses
which constitute the remainder of the require-
ments towards a Bachelor of Science degree.

The second unique feature of the program is
the fact that the students will work and be paid
for about thirty hours a week. Also, they will be
refunded the tuition by the company. They will

be given time off to attend school about 10 hours
during the day and take at least one evening

course. The courses total a maximum of ten cre-
dits per semester.

JANUARY, 1953

Initially the student will pay the tuition and
at the end of each semester, the company will re-
fund one-half the tuition for each course for which
a C grade or better has been received. At the
successful completion of the first part of the pro-
gram, the University will issue a “Certificate of
Engineering Fundamentals and Work Exper-
ience” to the student. At this point the company
will pay the remaining half of all tuition in the
first part, This will constitute a refund of about
eleven hundred dollars in tuition.

At this point, the student will have received
a good grounding in engineering fundamentals
and worked about three years for the company.
In many industries he will be in line for a promo-
tion as an “engineering aid” or technical assist-
ant. His value to the company will have been
greatly increased by the courses taken in the first
part. Having received the certificate and a refund
of tuition, the student will then be encouraged to
continue on to part two of the program with the
Bachelor of Science degree as his goal. The same
tuition refund will be made on the same basis as
in the first part.

Prior to registration this fall, the cooperative
plan was announced to many companies in the
district as an “Undergraduate Work in Industry
Program.” The Westinghouse Electric Corpora-
tion and Union Switch and Signal — Westing-
house Air-brake Companies announced the pro-
gram to their employees. As a result, 150 stu-
dents who were selected from 350 applicants from
these three companies started the program in
September. These students are currently attend-
ing night school.

Many other companies are seriously consider-
ing the plan and it is anticipated that they will
begin to make these scholarships available for
next fall.

Professor W. I. Short of the Civil Engineer-
ing Department has been appointed as Director
of “The Undergraduate Work in Industry Pro-
gram.”

DIELECTRIC HEATING

An explanation and uses of dielectric heating.

   

THE AUTHOR

Mr. Lapic, a second
semester senior in the
Electrical Engineering
Department, graduated
f r o m New Brighton
High School in 1949. He
is an active member of
the Radio Club and of
the Student Branches of
the American Institute
of Electrical Engineers
and the Institute of
Radio Engineers. During
the last two semesters he
has been a research as-
sastant for the University of Pittsburgh Engineer-
ing Research Division. When graduated, he ex-
pects to work for an aircraft company.

The uniform heating of a non-metallic ma-
terial has long been a problem to industry because
of the relatively low temperature that had to be
applied. Many processes involving the heat treat-
ing of such products as plywood, plastics, synthe-
tic fibers, and certain pharmaceutical products re-
quired hours and even days. When World War
II brought a critical shortage of all types of
metals, non-metallic materials became important
substitutes and had to be produced in larger quan-
tities and at a faster rate. The bottleneck created
by the long heating time required had to be eli-
minated. Engineers came up with dielectric heat-
ing and cut. down the heating time considerably;
in some cases as much as from one hundred hours
to one hour.

Dielectric heating as the name implies is the
heating of a non-conducting material, and is done
by placing the material in an electric field be-
tween two electrodes. This combination of an in-
sulator between the conducting surfaces consti-
tutes a capacitor having a capacitance C. The
product of the capacitance and the applied voltage
V equals a displaced charge Q.

Q = CV

The current I is equal to the time rate of change
of the charge.

by JOHN R. LAPIC, E.E. '53

By substitution we obtain the expression

dV
I ‘ C dt
This means if an alternating voltage is applied a
current flow through the dielectric. The current
flow, however, is due to a displacement current
rather than to a flow of electrons.

There are four factors that contribute to the
displacement current. The dielectric material as
all other substances consists of charged particles
held together by internal forces. An electric field
will exert a force upon the particles and tend to
displace them from their original position. This
may be the displacement of electrons from their
original position about the nucleus, or the atoms
or molecules themselves will be rotated or moved
from their original position. If as in the case of
some atoms or molecules, the positive and nega-
tive charges are not symmetrically arranged, that
is one side has polarity with respect to the other,
the dipole atom or molecule will turn about its
axis so that its electric field is oriented with the
external field, A non-homogenous substance may
contain ions in small conducting particles dis-
persed throughout the substance, and ion flow
may exist within the conducting particles.

Thus far we have only covered the causes of
the flow of displacement current, but have said
nothing about how the heat is actually generated.
In the case of electron, atom, and molecular dis-
placement heat is generated through molecular
friction due to the bumping of these particles
against one another. The electron and atom move-
ment is practically frictionless and contribute only

to the ﬂow of capacity current as in a perfect con-
denser.

As the voltage is applied across the dielectric,
the displacement will occur in phase with the ap-
plied voltage, but as the voltage is alternated at an‘
increasingly rapid rate, the displacement will lag
behind the applied voltage. The angle of lag will
increase to a maximum and then decrease to a
minimum as the frequency approaches the point
where the displacement can’t follow the rapidly
changing voltage. The maximum power factor

occurs at the frequency at which 1/zf equals the
time required for the complete displacement to
occur.

Peak power dissipation for the four types of
displacement occurs at different frequencies, The
peak molecular and ionic power factor occurs
within the radio frequency range and contribute
the most to dielectric heating. Atom and electron
power occurs only at the frequency of light and
do not contribute any heat.

The combination of the dielectric and the
electrodes may be represented by a perfect capaci-
tor paralleled by a resistor. Since the power fac-
tor (p.f.) is small, the ratio of resistance to reac-
tance is large, and therefore it may be correctly
assumed that most of the current is purely capaci-
tive and can be represented by the expression

E_r:

Substituting the expression for current We get the
formula for power

P = EI(p.f.)

The total power, P, dissipated is

P = 6.28iCE’(p.i.)
The power varies as the square of the voltage, and
it would seem natural to operate at very high vol--
tages. Usually a voltage of several thousand volts
is used. The upper limit being fixed by the maxi-
mum potential gradient that the material will
stand, and by safety considerations. The fre-
quency, therefore, is the only variable that can be
changed over a large range. The range is usually
from 1 to 100 megacycles. Although the power
factor varies with frequency, it remains practical-
ly constant over a large frequency range.

As previously mentioned most of the heat
generated in the radio frequency range is due to
molecular or ionic displacement. Most dielectric

materials can be heated, but there are a few ex-
ceptions. Materials such as parafin wax which
contain no polar molecules or free ions, and ma-
terials such as silica that have their ions bound in
a crystal lattice cannot be heated. Fortunately
most organic materials contain polar molecules or
free ions due to the presence of water.

Although dielectric heating has only come
into extensive use in recent years, the principle
has long been known, d’Arsonval, the famous
French physicist, in 1890 first put the principle
to use. Equipped with a Hertz wireless set he
was able to pass two or three amperes of high
frequency current through a human body with
only the sensation of heat. Tesla in 1891 also sug-
gested the use of high frequency current for dia-
thermy purposes, but gave up on the idea because
the lack of suitable means of producing large
amounts of high frequency power. With the
coming of the vacuum tube oscillator, diathermy
equipment has become common in doctors’ offices
within the past quarter century.

Industrial application, however, has pro-
gressed slower. This has been due in part to the
lack of low cost, compact, high powered radio fre-
quency generators, and in part to the belief that
radio frequency heating could not be used econo-
mically. The increased need for more new mater-
ials brought on by World War II resulted in a
gigantic increase in the industry.

The scarcity of metals in World War II re-
sulted in many new applications of plywood, and
has made this industry one of the largest users of
dielectric heating, The synthetic glues now used
in plywood, unlike earlier types do not set by
evaporation, but by a chemical change brought
about by the application of heat. Curing plywood
by external application of heat was slow because
of the low temperature that had to be used and
because of the insulating properties of wood. Use

The world’s water supply depends on ground waters.

by HARVEY P. WOLFERS, GEOL. E. '54

Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to
drink. How many times since the dawn of civili-
zation has the dispair implied by those words been
felt by man in his quest for clean, fresh water?

Water is so much a part of our daily lives
that while we have all we need, we may find that
we take its ready availability for granted. Our
entire environ of land sea and atmosphere and
even our bodies depends upon water in some form
for its existence. The form in which water occurs
and the geographical-geological relationship of its
occurrence have probably been two of the most
important factors in the determination of man’s
urban, agricultural, or transient existence. One
may question how and why water falls from the
sky, flows in the rivers, exists in the seas or bub-
bles up from the ground. These are all examples
of the operation of a concept known as the water
cycle.

Reduced to its briefest and most simple form,
the water cycle may be described as follows: the

surfaces of the seas, and in general all bodies of
water give off water vapor under the heating ef-
fects of the sun; the evaporation adds moisture to
the air; the moist air rises until it cools at higher
altitudes where the moisture condenses, becomes
rain, and falls upon the surface of the earth. The
rain accumulates and runs into rivers, lakes, and
seas or is absorbed by the ground. The water
which is absorbed may also return indirectly to
the seas or the atmosphere, but while it is in the
ground, it is known as underground water, more
commonly called ground water.

The water of the lakes, rivers, and seas has
always been an important factor in man’s exist-
ence and probably shall continue to be; but it is
the underground water with which man has re-
cently been so greatly concerned for here lies a
vast volume of the earth’s total water and it is this
source which usually supplies man’s drinking, in-
dustrial, and sanitation needs. In discussing
ground water there are three distinct states or
modes of existence to be considered: meteoric,
connate, and magmatic.

Meteoric water results from some form of
atmospheric precipitation such as rain or snow.
This water when absorbed by the ground usually
remains relatively close to the surface.

Connate water may be spoken of as fossil
water in that it has become entrapped in the voids
between particles of clastic material comprising
sedimentary rock and was so entrapped at the
time of deposition. This water occurs at varying
depths depending upon the attitude and depth of
the containing rock.

Magmatic water is that which has become
associated with hot molten or plastic rock at
depths where igneous activity takes place or which
is actually formed as a complex chemical result
of the. igneous activity.

Since it is possible to have combinations of
the water of these different states where their

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

respective local zones overlap, there is no confin-
ing rule which definitely refers any one of the

three to a specific depth in the earth’s crust; how-

ever meteoric water is usually thought to be in the
zone nearest the surface while magmatic water is
thought of as occupying that zone farthest from
the surface, with connate water existing at many
depths as already stated.

The percentage of meteoric water absorbed
by the ground surface is a function of the nature
of the soil or rock at the surface and the depth of
bedrock. The water which does penetrate into
the ground may take one or more of the following
courses: It may be absorbed directly by vegeta-
tion; it may unite with certain minerals in the
soil, becoming chemically fixed; it may escape at
outcrops in the form of spring or may be drawn
back to the surface to be evaporated; it may flow
under ground to the sea directly or indirectly by
means of one or more temporary base levels; or
lastly it may be retained by the soil in the form
of microscopic layers of absorbed water on the
individual grains of soil. It is important to note
that in most instances meteoric ground water may
be thought of as quite mobile. This property
causes it to be responsive to such influences as
differential altitude above sea level, and varia-
tions in the amount of rainfall. It seems that the
ultimate cause for the movement other than by
capillary action is gravity and this seems to ex-
plain the dwvnward trend taken by the water.

As a direct result of the passage of water in-
to the ground, a layer of saturated material de-
velops above the upper slirface of the first im-
permeable sediment encountered by the water in
its downward movement. The upper limit of this
saturated zone is called the water table. Th
water table may intersect the ground surface an '
where it goes there may be a spring, water cascade
or a body of quiet or moving water. Except local-
ly and in the case of quiet. ater such as a pond
or lake, the water table is’ ever level and very
seldom flat.

If the zone of saturation is in a material of
relatively homogeneous nature and of broad ex-
tent, the water table will usually approximate the
topography in attitude and shape. The depth of
the water table will fluctuate in accordance with
the amount of water seeping through the soil. The
depth will also vary with the location of the mea-
surement within a given small area depending
upon whether that position is at the bottom or top
of a slope or some intermediate point, However,
for any surface water to penetrate to the so-called
permanently saturated zone, a state of temporary
saturation must exist in the layer extending from
the surface down to the water table . This layer
is known as the zone of aeration or the vados.
When temperatures are above freezing during the
intervals between periods of light rain fall, or
when the relative humidity is low for sustained
periods of time, evaporation will take place at the
surface. This evaporated water comes from the
vadose which causes that zone to become progres-
sively less moist. As this occurs, water is drawn
by capillary action from the saturated zone with
the resultant lowering of the water table.

By a reverse process, during periods of sus-
tained heavy rainfall, the water table may rise to
a considerable degree. As an illustration a hy-

JANUARY, 1953

pothetical situation might be suggested. Assume
that internal forces have caused the folding of a
certain section of rock and that at some locality
the folding took the form of a basin whose flanks
were the limbs of adjoining hills, Further assume
that weathering has caused the rocks at the sur-
face to disintegrate, forming a more or less uni-
formly deep soil mantle across the basin. If the
base of the soil mantle rests on a relatively im-
permeable rock such as shale, it can be expected
that the saturated zone will extend from that con-
tact upward. If rain is now introduced into the
situation, it should be possible to forecast the re-
sults. In accordance with what has already been
said, there would be a certain amount of surface
run-off which would flow down slope to a tem-
porary base level in the center of the basin. At
that point it would collect and begin to seep into
the mantle. Simultaneously, that portion of the
rain which did not become surface run-off but was
absorbed by the mantle on the flanks of the basin,
would seep downward through the soil. As this
water reaches the impermeable rock bed, it starts

. to build up a saturated zone, much the same as a

‘small pile of sand to which more is constantly
added. This of course would be taking place at all
points in the basin, and the net result would be
the elevation of a ‘water table. The addition of
more water brings about the subsequent rise in
the hydrostatic pressure on the Water lowermost
in the saturated zone. This hydrostatic pressure
on any given particle of water causes it to be
squeezed out of its position to one of less pressure.
This leads to a general movement of the water
down-slope. The confluence of all the moving
ground water tends to occur at a point of lowest
elevation in the basin. With seepage of surface
run-off taking place at the greatest rate over the
same general area, it seems plain that the total
amount of water here must be far in excess of that
elsewhere in the basin. It therefore follows that
the water table here will be closest to the surface
or may even intersect it, forming a swampy area
or meadow, If drainage from this point to some
other at an elevation nearer sea level, does not
take place at a rate equal ‘to or greater than the
rate of accumulation, it is almost certain that a
body of water similar to a lake will form.

The depth and the extent of the water body
thereafter would be a function of the rate of sur-
face run-off, the rate of ground water movement,
and the rate of drainage from. the body of water.

Further complications might be added to the
illustration until at length the hypothetical situa-
tion becomes an example taken from nature, but
by then its complexity would be so great as to
mask its illustrative scope.

One particular type of ground water move-
ment is worthy of note. When rain or surface
run-off passes over the up-turned edge of a down
folded porous, permeable rock layer, a great por-
tion of that water passes directly into the rock,
which then acts as a conductor that may carry the
water several miles and to great depths. Quite
often such an aquifer, as the rock is called, may
exhibit variation in porosity or permeability in
one or.more directions. The value of aquifer as a
source of water depends upon the constancy of its

STATIONS

Nation that builds man-made planet could rule earth.

/
/’

Man has conquered earth — he is now at-
empting to conquer space. We are no longer con-
cerned with the question ‘‘will we” but now ask
“when will we” be able to live in the heavens,
travel from planet to planet, and eventually reach
the moon. For years this idea of space ships and
rockets was considered ridiculous and appealed
only to children, now the world 1S rapidly awaken-
ing to the realization that space is penetrable and
as a result the world’s best scientists are investi-
gating its possibilities.

To reach the moon was the incentive the
scientists needed. Landing on the moon is beyond
the borderline of what chemical rocket fuels of
today can do. To cope with this situation a theory
was conceived. This theoretical method of event-
ually reaching other planets is a refueling termin-
al in space, a cosmic stepping stone for space ships
which are too weak to reach another planet direct-
ly. This terminal is called a space station.

The idea of a space station, although seem-
ingly fantastic to some, is by nomeans a stretch
of the imagination to others. Dr. Wernher von
Braun, the German scientist who built the V-2
rocket, and Mr. Willy Ley, noted American scien-
tist and rocket expert, have been engaged by the
United States government, along with other
scientists and engineers to investigate the possi-
bility of building such a station in the heavens.

However, before the station can be built, the
rocket must be the first to go beyond the stratum
of the earth that we now know, First will come
passenger or equipment carrying rockets. These
will travel short distances into space (in compar-
ison with proposed trips). From information re-
ceived from these trips will come the data needed
to design a space station. Another reason for the
rocket is that to build the station we must trans-
port the equipment and people to where the sta-
tion will be constructed.

A rocket has already been designed that will
do this task. It will be as tall as a twenty-four
story building (625 ft.) , that is, of course, stand-
ing vertically, which is the position from which it
will take off, It Will have three “stages” or sec-
tions with a ratio of 3 :5 :1. As the rocket travels
further and further into space it will lose the
bottom sections, which will be released to give the
ship more momentum in its attempt to overcome
the gravitational pull of the earth. These two
sections will have small parachutes to carry them
safely to earth because they will be needed again
on the next trip. There will necessarily be motors

in each of the rocket'°s three sections. This rocket
will leave earth at the speed of 4.7 m.p.sec., but
on the return trip it will be allowed to coast until
it reaches the stratosphere then a reduced rate of
speed will be used (probably about 1 m.p.sec.).

The space station will be built in an orbit at
a distance of exactly 1,075 miles above earth at all
points. The orbit chosen will be called a two-hour
orbit because it Will take the station exactly two
hours to circle the globe, The speed required to
remain in the orbit will be approximately 17,000
miles per hour. However, the people within the
station will not‘~be able to tell the rate of speed
since artificial gravity will be acquired called cen-
trifugal force by the movement of a wheel (the
space station itself) around a hub (the center of
the station).

To get the equipment to build the station into
space we need only push it out of the rocket and
since there is no weight in space it will float there.
Because of this weightlessness one man will be
able to move what would normally take ten or
more men to move on earth, therefore men in
space suits will also leave the rocket and push the
equipment into space. Out there alone in space
the men and equipment could be called “satel-
lites”. They will drift about in this dark void
attached to the rocket by cables—specks in its
vastness.

Because there will be no air at this distance
there will be no sound since sound travels due to
the movement of air molecules. Therefore
walkie-talkies will be used to transmit instruc-
tions to the men building the “orbital” which is
what one scientist calls the station, Another
method for transmitting messages will be for one
man to tap on a piece of the equipment he is hand-
ling and if the other workers place their heads
close to the equipment they will “feel” the signal
traveling through the solid.

CYBERNETICS-

lt’s Meaning, Development and Future

by WALTER F. MRUK, E.E. '48

The electronic computor and the human mind very

closely related.

Prior to World War II, Professor Norbert
Weiner of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology and his colleagues felt that those realms
which lay between the already established fields
of science offered the greatest opportunities for
men of the proper scientific caliber. Indeed Pro-
fessor Weiner’s strong interest in the Scientific
Method led him and his colleagues to form discus-
sion groups composed of qualified scientists of
various fields of endeavor who presented their
ideas and methodology to the group for criticism.
Out of this discussion group grew the conviction
that if significant scientific advances were to be
made, a group of scientists strong in particular

fields but competent in related ones must lend one
another their individual strengths for a better
understanding of in-between phenomena.

The opportunity for this conviction to be test-
ed came with World War II. Professor Weiner
was engaged in the development of computing
machines for the solution of particular kinds of
mathematical equations. The association with
other groups of scientists engaged in seemingly
unrelated activities and subsequent application of
these same computing machines to gun aiming
and firing mechanisms disclosed to Weiner the
remarkable property that the computing machine
could be made to simulate human brain activities.
Further investigation led to the inevitable ques-
tions which at first glance do not even imply a
relationship to the given problem. The answers
to these questions gave rise to the science of cy-
bernetics. The word cybernetics is derived from
the Greek Word Kybernetes meaning the art of
steering or a steersman. The steersman in cy-
bernetics can readily be the role of communica-
tions in human-living and all that human-living
implies. Evidence for this will be made clear
through a presentation, although limited, of the
ideology and some examples of cybernetics.

One of the basic questions which arose in the
development of cybernetics dealt with defining
man as a creature apart from other creatures.
After much deliberation, Weiner claims that the
only facet of man's overall profile which disting-
uishes him from all other creatures is his insati-
able necessity for communication. In fact, the
superhuman effort exerted by Helen Keller and
people like her who have no sense of sight or hear-
ing gives evidence to the strength of the necessity
for communication.

Here, communication is used not only in the
restricted sense of individuals speaking to one
another, but in the general sense of the trans-
mission, reception and consequent results of sig-
nals between man and man, man and machine,
and machine and machine. These signals can be

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

visual or audible, those of odor, touch and taste,
or a series of dots and dashes as in telegraphy.
In fact, any transfer of intelligible information
constitutes a signal.

As an example of communication in this
broader sense, consider the act of picking-up your
cigarette from an ashtray. Initially, you are
prompted by a desire to smoke the cigarette. You
therefore reach for it and place it between your
lips. This act appears simple enough. But the
actual mechanism involved in performing this act
is not a closed one; i. e., beginning and terminat-
ing within yourself and independent of your en-
viornment, On the contrary, certain nerve end-
bodies called proprioceptors relay messages to
your brain all the while you are in the process of
picking up your cigarette. These messages in-
form the brain of the degree of incompletion of
the intended action while the brain in turn modi-
fies its intended performance on the basis of its
actual performance. In effect, the proprioceptors
feed back messages to the brain telling it by how
much distance your hand is still separated from
the cigarette, until, of course, you are no longer
separated from it. The process of placing the
cigarette between the lips follows the same idea.
The proprioceptors are sense organs located in
every muscle, tendon and joint throughout the
body. The messages they feed back to the brain
are carried by neurons. The neurons themselves
furnish the link which complete the cyclic action
in the discharge, in this case, of the desire to
smoke a cigarette.

Perhaps the simplest case of feedback, which
is the label given the basic phenomenon described
above, is the mechanical governor, The governor
consists of two weighted balls attached to a lever
system which controls the amount of fuel avail-
able to an engine. As the engine begins to accel-
erate, the balls pull away from their equilibrium
position by centrifugal action and so decrease the
amount of fuel available to the engine, thus slow-
ing it down. Here a feedback network controls
the speed of an engine and keeps it within adjust-
able limits.

Feedback systems more complex than that of
the governor have been incorporated ingeniously
in the design of electronic computors; this has re-
sulted in machines whose action closely simulates
that of the human brain. In fact two forms of
mental disorder, ataxia and purpose tremor, are
readily demonstrable through such computors or
electronic brains. In computors which are used
in positioning and firing anti-aircraft guns, a
feedback network is employed which controls the
forces applied to the gun. If the feedback is large
enough to cause the gun to overshoot its mark
initially, a series of uncontrollable oscillations
grow and result in the destruction of the gun. In
the human brain, the comparable disorder is called
purpose tremor. It is a disorder in which the
patient overshoots his mark, say in reaching for
his cigarette, and due to the excessive feedback,
hovers over it. On the other hand, ataxia results
when the proprioceptors perform their function
improperly and the patient is unable to perform
a given task.

Another form of mental breakdown, anala-
gous to one in the computor, deals not with feed-

JANUARY, 1953

back but with another phenomenon called traffic-
ing. In a typical communications system, like a
telephone switchboard, the overloading of the
available circuits results in a breakdown caused
by the addition of new messages. In other words,
all avenues of traffic are filled to capacity with
no expansion room for emergency. In the human
brain, messages are kept alive by two levels of
memory—a circulating and a permanent one.
Short lived messages are kept circulating until
they serve their purpose and finally become part
of the permanent memory or die-out. The per-
manent memory itself has no means of erasure
except death. Whenever a “message” becomes
particularly worrisome to a patient, the message
is kept circulating and alive by the addition of
more and more neurons—the brain message car-
riers—until as large a number of available neu-
rons as the patient can afford are concerned with
sustaining the message. In fact, the neurons will
exclude all other messages of less importance than
the worry-message; consequently, any message
greater than or equal to the importance of the
worry-message will be acceptable to the traffic
system. The trafficing, however, is already
carrying a full load so that the introduction of the
new message results in a mental breakdown.

The treatment rendered a computer which
has gone off on its merry way is to introduce a
large voltage input pulse in hopes of trying to dis-
lodge the circulatory message. If this course of
action proves unsuccessful, a part of the machine
suspected of being at fault may be disconnected
from the machine thus depriving the machine of
some of its memory.

The large voltage pulse is comparable with
the shock-treatment rendered to persons suffer-
ing from certain mental disorders. Insulin shock
treatment follows in the same order.

The removal of a part of the machine itself
corresponds to the surgical operation known as a
prefrontal lobotomy, This operation does not
cure the patient but deprives him of his full capa-
cities, thus rendering him more docile.

Three examples of brain-machine analogies
and their subsequent disorders and “cures” have
been presented. Cybernetics, however, has a
greater application than only to psychopathology
or psychiatry. Since it is an in-between science,
cybernetics touches fields as remote as music.
For example, a foreigner who first learns to speak
English speaks with a grammatical structure and
a choice of words which sound bad but carry ideas
faithfully. It may be said that he speaks well,
semantically, but badly phonetically. Cybernetics
and Semantics are first cousins as they relate to
communication, for the complete transfer of un-
ambiguous ideas involves the transfer of intelli-
gible signals. In music, the composer usually
tries to embody a general emotion or emotional
experience in a composition, be it concerto, quartet
or symphony. The greater the number of per-
sons responding to this emotional experience via
the composition, the greater the success of the
composer. It might therefore be said that many
composers write well, phonetically, but badly
semantically. The difference between good or bad
orchestration amounts to the same difference in

RATE OF DESCENT

An electrical-optical “brain” de-
veloped by North American Avia-
tion to give instant data on how fast
an airplane “hits the deck” or lands,
has won its sea legs in operational
tests aboard the Navy’s aircraft car-
rier Midway.

The instrument, Touchdown Rate
of Descent Indicator, nicknamed
TRODI, is being produced by North
American’s Electro-Mechanical En-
gineering and Manufacturing Depart-
ments. In the past the rate of descent
for an experimental airplane has been
recorded by cameras, but the photo-

graphed data was not available for
several days. TRODI flashes this in-
formation immediately at far less
cost.

All new Navy airplanes must be
tested for rate of descent before they
are placed in regular operation. For-
merly in carrier landings, with an ex-
perimental plane, a pilot would not
know for some time if he had come
in for a landing at the correct rate of
descent. With TRODI’S rapid “brain”,
the data is ready for the pilot as soon
as he steps from the cockpit. He can
then correct his future landings if
necessary.

TRODI measures rate of descent
with an accuracy of 0.4 feet per sec-
ond and is in regular service with the
U. S. Navy. The instrument also has
applications to benefit other branches
of the military services and civil avi-
ation.

Portable, easy to handle, the instru-
ment measures the rate of descent
that aircraft structures can withstand,
helps evaluate landing characteristics

of airplanes controlled by automatic
or manual systems, helps instructors
teachstudent pilots in skillful and
safe landings, and aids in determin-
ing landing conditions suitable for
various aircraft_

To seek rate of descent data, TRODI
sends out two parallel beams of light,
thin vertically and wide horizontally.
They are one foot apart. A mirror
system on the incoming airplane cuts
the top beam, reflecting the light
back to a photo-electric cell, which
starts an electrical charge into a con-
denser. The descending airplane then
cuts the second and lower beam, re-
flects it, and stops the charge going
into the condenser.

The electrical charge stored during
the interval between beams is quick-
ly translated by TRODI from voltage
to rate of descent in feet per second.

WORLD’S LARGEST MOTOR

Contracts for the largest electric
motor and reversible pump-turbine
ever built have been awarded to the
Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Com-
pany. The equipment will be the
heart of a pump-storage project at
Hiwassee Dam in southwestern North
Carolina of the Tennessee Valley
Authority’s power network. It is
scheduled for completion late in 1955.

In this installation a single hydrau-
lic machine will operate in one direc-
tion as a turbine and in the reverse
direction as a pump. A direct-con-
nected electrical machine will serve
as a motor for pump operation and as
a generator for turbine operation.

When in service, water from Hiwas-
see reservoir, driving the unit as a
turbine-generator, will add needed
energy to the TVA system in peak
demand periods. During off-peak

periods, when surplus power is avail-
able from other plants, the unit will
operate as a motor-driven pump to
lift water back into the reservoir. It
will act, in other words, as a huge
storage battery for storing energy.

The project has many unusual as-
pects. The reversible pump-turbine
will utilize the largest Francis type
runner ever built. As a turbine it
will have a maximum rating of 120,-
000 horsepower, When motor driven,
the unit will have a pumping capacity
of 3.3 billion gallons of water per
day, or nearly three times as much
as New York City requires.

 

The electrical motor-generator is
equally imposing. As a motor it will
be the world’s largest, rated 102,000
horsepower, 106 revolutions per min-
ute. It is approximately 50 percent
larger than the motors driving the
Grand Coulee pumps. As a generator
it is rated 70,000 kva, 13,800 volts.

In a normal cycle of operation, the
pump will begin lifting water from
Apalachia lake into Hiwassee lake
under a head of 135 feet at 5200
cubic feet per second. By the time the
upper reservoir is filled, the head
will increase to 254.5 feet. The rated
pumping capacity will be 3900 cubic
feet per second against a 205-ft. head.

At the beginning of operation as a
turbine, the unit will generate 120,-
000 horsepower and drop to 36,000
horsepower as the reservoir ap-
proaches the low point. Guaranteed
efficiencies are 90 percent as a pump
and 89.5 percent as a turbine,

First Prestressed Concrete Girder

in the I]. S.

by RICHARD E. MILHEM, as. '53

A new technique gives concrete girders tensile strength

Plans for the first prestressed concrete bridge
in the United States were complete by September
of 1949, but before construction could be started
on Philadelphia’s new Walnut Lane Bridge, many
problems remained unanswered, Prestressing of
concrete had been used with success in France and
Germany, but was relatively new to U. S. engi-
neers. To find the answers to these problems,
four hundred engineers gathered at Philadelphia
in September of 1949, and stood for eight hours
in the rain to witness the testing of a full sized
prestressed concrete girder, an exact duplicate of
those to be used in the new Walnut Lane Bridge.
This was the first prestressed girder cast in the
United States and probably the largest structural
member ever subjected to a scientific test.

After the forms were constructed, the girder
took about six hours to cast. It was wet-cured for
72 hours, then the forms were removed. When
the girder was precast, removable rubber cores
were placed to form openings for the Wire cables
used in stressing the beam. It was 17 days before
the concrete attained the 5400 p.s.i. compressive
strength specified for pretesting. An additional
mixture was used in an attempt to delay the ini-
tial set, then to accelerate the final set after the
initial set had been reached. The 28 day strength
attained 6500 p.s.i.

After the required compressive strength was
reached the rubber sleeves forming the cable chan-
nels in the girder were removed. These sleeves,
roughly two inches square in cross section, have
a one inch diameter hole through the center to
accommodate pipe stiffeners that prevent sag or
stretch. In the removal operation, first the pipes,
then the rubber sleeves were pulled out by a
winch. Next the cables were pulled through the

openings in the girder. The prestressing cables
consisted of 256 high strength steel wires, .276
inches in diameter, with a working stress of
130,000 p.s.i. These wires were arranged into four
cables threaded through the rectangular channels
formed in the girder. Two cables ran straight
through the bottom flange and the other two went
through the web, following a parabolic curve. The
cables were pulled through and stressed to 125,000
p.s.i. Two cables were stretched at a time by ten
ton jacks and anchored to the girder.

The cables were stretched nine inches and
had a total stress of 955 tons. About one or two
inches of this stretch was lost due to shrinkage
and creepage of the concrete and relaxation of the
steel, The stress lost was about 15,000 p.s.i., but
enough compressive stress remained in the girder
so that no live load could remove it and subject it
to cracking through tension. This is the princi-
ple of prestressing concrete. Since concrete is
weak in tension and strong in compression, pre-
stressing puts compression in the bottom flange
of a beam which is normally the tension flange,
and any live load applied to the beam decreases
the compression in the bottom flange rather than
increases the tension. Thus, after the girder was

31

prestressed, it had a compressive stress in the bot-
tom of 2000 p.s.i. and a compressive stress of 1050
p.s.i. in the top.

The finished girder measured 160 feet in
length and 6 feet 7 inches in depth. It required
80 cubic yards of concrete. It was a modified T-
section with a dead weight of 150 tons including
reinforcing.

The girder was now ready for the big test.
A dozen iron workers stood on top of the beam
and applied the loads by pumping hydraulic jacks.
A loud speaker system announced the progress to
the audience. Twenty three strain gages placed at
critical points on the girder were observed by
electric wires converging to a shack at one side of
the girder.

Fifty-five tons were added to the dead weight
of 150 tons for the first test. Under this load of
205 tons the deflection was 3/. of an inch. At 240
tons the deflection was 1% inches. The first
visible cracks appeared under a total load of 262
tons with a deflection of 27/8 inches. The loads
were gradually increased with the deflections not-
ed for each load and attention paid to the cracking
of the concrete. At 384 tons the deflection was
5:’/8 inches and numerous cracks were visible.
The test was stopped at this point and all the
loads were removed. This was done to demon-
strate one of the advantages of prestressed de-
sign, It showed how the cracks closed up upon
release of the loads.

The loads were reapplied in increments of
20 tons. At a total load of 480 tons the deflection
was 10% inches. A total deflection of 15% inches
was attained under a load of 528 tons. Here the
test was stopped. Failure had occurred by ex-
tensive vertical cracking. Although this was to
be a test to destruction, the available 400 tons of
steel ingots provided insufficient weight to com-
pletely destroy the girder.

The test was judged a complete success. The
engineers had solved many unanswered problems.
It was learned that with the use of higher grade
materials 20 per cent less steel could be used to
produce the same results. Because the results of
this test have been published, we will see many
prestressed structures in the future being con-
structed with a higher strength and a reduction
in cos .

CLASS OF '5

MEET YOURSELF-
1O YEARS FROM NOW

Ever wonder what you’ll be like when the class of '53 holds its 10th
reunion? If you started to work for one of the Bell System telephone
companies after graduation, we can give you a pretty good idea.

POSITION IN THE WORLD: On the way up! A Development Engineer
with the Bell Laboratories. Perhaps exploring the application of funda-
mental new eleetronie inventions to telephone communications. A
Transmission Engineer, helping to provide the telephone needs of an
entire state. A Supervisor in the Traffic Department, responsible for the
speed and quality of local and long distance service in several cities and
for the personnel relations of a large number of employees. In the tele-
phone company, jobs such as these are held by relatively young men

and women.

FUTURE: Unlimited! The Bell System continually progresses and expands
and its personnel grows with it. In the past 25 years, the number of
telephones has almost tripled. In the past 5 years, telephone companies
have introduced such things as network television transmission, radio-
telephone service and dialing of Long Distance calls. And the best is
yet to come.

FRAME OF MIND: Conﬁdent and proud! You'll be satisﬁed because you
have a rewarding job... not only in pay and security . . . but in service.
You’ll be proud of your share in helping provide and develop a telephone
service vital to the eountry’s social and economic life.

Like the picture? For further information see your Placement
Ofﬁcer. He will be glad to give you details regarding the opportunities
for employment in the Bell System.

It will take many trips of the “three stage”
rocket to complete the station and each trip should
cost approximately one-half million dolars. This
is the main drawback in the building of the “new
moon” since few people are willing to back such
a project and, because of the tremendous cost the
government cannot carry the full load. The com-
pleted station is expected to cost in the vicinity of
four billion dollars.

As it is with most new inventions, the first
station will be rather crude. It will consist of
spokes leading to a central hub containing a
spherical steam boiler. The purpose of the boiler
is to operate a turbine which will generate electric
power. This is the concept of Dr. Werhner Von
Braun whose assuredness is reflected in his fol-
lowing statement, “I am convinced that such a sta-
tion will be the inevitable result of the present
race of armament.” To prepare for man’s ascent
into space to live there, a monkey will be placed in
the first station to observe how his body reacts to
the change of environment. A monkey was chosen
as the first occupant of the station because his
bodily structure is most like that of a man.

After we learn more about the crude station
we already have in space and after we solve many
of the problems we know are waiting for us, a
fully equipped station will be placed in the orbit.
The new occupant of the “two-hour orbit” will be
made of nylon and plastic fiber. A huge round
structure approximately one-half mile in dia-
meter made of these materials will be transported
to where the station will be constructed, pushed
from the rocket and inflated with oxygen much
like an automobile tire. The oxygen in the station
as a result of the inflating will be breathed by the
men working in it. This will be replenished as
needed by successive rocket missions. At the
hub of the new station a huge parabolic mirror
will focuse the rays of the sun on a steamboiler
to generate power. Since gravity decreases with
distance from the earth the men in the station, re-
placing the monkey, will not need to worry too
much about interruptions from the earth’s gravi-
ty, however there will be a small gravitational
pull. To balance this pull the station must go fast
enough to cause centrifugal force, this is the rea-
son for the speed of 17,000 m.p.h. Although this
speed may seem terrific we should not fear it
since the earth is traveling at the rate of 66,600
m.p.h. around the sun.

One problem will be very inconvenient to the
efficiency of the station. ' The gravity will not be
equal in all parts of the station but will decrease
towards the center or hub. To balance this,
weight on all parts of the circular station must be
equal so that gravity will have no greater effect
on one part than on the other. If this balance
were not achieved the station would wobble dis-
turbing the work of the men inside and could
“fall” out of its orbit and take an endless journey
into space, killing all its occupants. Speaking of
gravity, the men’s heads will always point to-
wards the hub. In other words the floors of the
station will actually be the inside walls of the
outer rim.

Now to discuss man’s survival in the heavens,
As stated earlier, man is attempting to conquer

34

space, whether he will succeed or not will depend
largely on himself and his ability to survive in
outer space. He is the most important link, yet he
is the weakest. There is no oxygen for breathing
in space, the only supply man will have will be
that which is pumped in by the rockets. These
rockets will have to park a good distance from the
station since the heat emitted by it would engulf
the station in flames in a matter of seconds. Space
taxis, which are very small rockets, would travel
from the station to the rocket carrying a line
through which the oxygen would be pumped. Peo-
ple and supplies could also be transported from
the rocket to the station by these taxis.

There will be no weight on the station. To
give an example of howweightlessness becomes
more pronounced as we travel further into space,
let us cite a man weighing 160 pounds as he left
earth in a rocket, At 1000 miles up he Would
weigh 102 pounds, at 10,000 miles he would weigh
13 pounds, at 20,000 miles he would weigh less
than five pounds, and at 50,000 miles he would
weigh less than 1 pound. Man’s size and mass
does not change, however, no matter what dis-
tance he may travel into space.

Walking will be accomplished by magnetic
shoes on a steel floor. Because of the lack of
gravity, water will not stay in a regular glass, nor
will food stay in common plates, therefore they
will both be kept in wax containers and much of
the food will be in capsule form. Contrary to
popular belief, swallowing is not affected by
gravity nor is the inner workings of the human
body. Another incorrect idea concerning space
that scientists have shattered is “the cold of
space”. This cold does not exist since space is by
definition a vacuum and therefore has no temper-
ature. Plants will be grown on the platform, as
the station is sometimes called, by means of hy-
drtiponics (growing plants in liquids instead of
soi ,

Other problems man will face are ultraviolet
rays, which could disintegrate him in seconds and
because of the lack of atmospheric pressure his
blood could boil within him. These two obstacles
are believed solved by the invention of a pressure
suit made of several layers of rubberized nylon
and a helmet with a darkened piece of transparent
metal to ward off ultraviolet rays. Still another
problem will be meteorites or falling stars as we
call them. It is estimated that these will strike
the station on the average of twice a month. To
counteract these an outer wall will be built around
the station and self-sealing matter will be placed
between the station’s inner wall. If this does not
work a colored, harmless gas will be pumped into
the room, the gas will drift toward any opening
and it can be repaired. The one big problem re-
maining for which no one has found an answer is
the threat of cosmic rays.

The work on the station has not been without
notice. It has aroused a wave of criticism from
scientists and literary men. In 1949 James For-
restal, the_n Secretary of Defense, hinted that the
space stations may be used for military purposes.
This started a good deal of speculation. The
Chrtstzian. Century, in an editorial, said, “We are
using our scientists and our unmatched natural

When RCA scientists developed an
electron tube so sensitive that it could
respond to flickering starlight, astron-
omers promptly put it to work in their
studies of the Universe.

Called a multiplier phototube, RCA’s
invention now “takes to the road” in an
instrument which will add to your safety
when driving at night. The multiplier
phototube is now being used in an auto-
matic control for automobile headlights.

Here’s how it works. RCA’s tube, in a new
system, sits behind your windshield where
it can “see” approaching headlights. A car
comes, and the multiplier phototube acti-

vates a system which shifts your headlights
to low beam—returns them to high when the
other car has passed. It’s simple. It’s com-
pletely automatic. And what’s most impor-
tant, it lets you keep your undivided atten-
tion where it belongs . . . on driving your car.

Development of the multiplier phototube
is another example of how RCA research
benefits you. RCA research assures you finer
performance from any product or service of
RCA and RCA Victor.

resources with our unlimited productive capacity
to find a new way to dominate the earth.” The
magazine called it the official project of the
United States Government and said the station
will be used to destroy earth. The editorial went
on to mourn the fall of man by stating that the
huge mirror that will be used to focuse the sun’s
rays for power to keep the station in the skies
will be focused on earth to dry up lakes, burn
homes and disintegrate man. It finally asked
the U. N. to study the project. In rebuttal R. M.
Moberg, a writer, had the following to say con-
cerning the editorial, “Man may as well be told
to stop breathing as to stop probing into the un-
known”. He also said that the station was the
only way to keep Russia in her place. Time called
the space station “a Buck Rogerish shot towards
the future”. However the men working on the
project have higher hopes. Mr. Willy Ley said,
“The establishment of the station is the most
difficult step in the realization of space travel;
everything that comes after is easier than that
project”. Dr. Heinz Haber astrophysicist in the
Department of Space medicine at Randolph Field
said, “After further exploration with high alti-
tude rockets a large craft will be hung in space
where it will circle the planet like a small moon,
continuously broadcasting all manner of reports.”
In Hampers, a magazine considered for intellec-
tuals, the following statement was made,

“The prospect of travel in free space——
beyond the limits of the earth’s atmo-
sphere and gravitational pull—has vir-
tually been assured by the latest scien-
tific and technical developments. The
men who will probably participate in its
pioneer adventures are already alive.”

Despite the arguments both sides seem to be
justified. The possibilities for the station are
numerous but the threat of the station is just as
ominous.

To justify building the station, the advan-
tages that can be made possible by it are many.
To mention a few, meteorologists could chart the
weather for the entire earth, also it could be used
as a world communications center. It could also
be used as a stepping stone on trips to the moon,
which was the reason its building was ever con-
sidered. The moon is about five days from the
platform. The station could also serve as a short
wave and television transmitter for the world.
This would save many broadcasting companies a
tremendous amount of money and may aid in
getting the money required for its construction.

This station, far above earth, could also be
used as a terrible weapon of war by the country
who is the first to build it. If, because of the
station, we ever reached the m.oon and found it
habitable the earth could be bombarded, at defin-
ite points, by our present day V-2 and Viking
rockets. We could also dominate any country we
desired simply by broadcasting ultimatums to it
from the station, so you see it really is a matter of
who builds the station first. If it is a peaceful
nation much can be done to benefit the world,
on the other hand if it is an aggressive power—
the world is doomed.

The argument that the station can never be
built is indeed very logical, but we must remem-

36

ber that man is a restless being with a restless
mind always seeking new worlds to conquer. It
was inevitable that he should turn his attention
away from the earth to the vastness of outer
space. People called Henry Ford “crazy,” Alex-
ander Graham Bell “impossible,” and Thomas
Edison a lunatic, yet today we owe them life as
we know it. Who will be the butt of the people’s
puns as a result of the Space Station Theory we

- will soon discover, but it is the hope of the men
‘planning the station that man will use his intelli-

gence and stop to consider the bountiful possibili-
ties to better mankind that will be fostered by the
station. Man is definitely preparing to conquer
space.

As for the future of cybernetics, the general-
ization from the implications of present work sug-
gest the possibilities.

By a careful study of the mechanism of learn-
ing, scientists engaged in computer work have
simulated this heretofore human accomplishment
to some degree in a number of machines. One
machine of interest is the chess playing machine.
If informed of the present disposition of pieces
in a game, the machine will predict the next two
best possible moves! In fact, Van Meumann’s
“Theory of Games” has led the United States
Armed Forces to construct a machine which, after
being properly informed of the total military re-
sources of the two countries at war with one an-
other, will declare a winner on the basis that the
country reaching a minimum resource value first
loses the war.

Still better, some individuals feel that de-
cisions in our government could possibly be made
by thinking machines. In this event, we as citi-
zens could expect an impersonal to-the-1etter-of-
the-law government. Imagine what might hap-
pen if the machines gave incorrect answers due
to a series of defective vacuum tubes!. But such
a catastrophe is not very much different from
using older thinking machines, namely human
being, in positions requiring capacities far above
the ones they really possess. Perhaps cybernetics
holds the solution to this problem.

of dielectric heating reduced laminating time from
eight hours to less than one-half hour, and result-
ed in a stronger product. Another advantage is
that the power can be concentrated where it is
needed by arrangement of the electrodes. This
is especially useful in the gluing of joints and odd
shaped articles.

The plastic industry has also used high fre-
quency heating in the curing of thermo setting
plastics. As in plywood, plastic is a poor conduc-
tor of heat and cannot stand high temperatures.
Radio frequency heat cures the plastic uniformly
inside as well as near the surface, and eliminates
the possibility of internal stresses created by non-
uniform heating, Since only the dielectric is heat-
ed, mold wear is reduced, and pressures can be re-
duced as much as 25-40%, resulting in lower
equipment cost.

The use of dielectric heating is not limited
only to the plastic and plywood industry. In the
field of medicine the drug penicillin became tem-

perature sensitive and lost its potency if it con-
tained any moisture. Heredielectric heating com-
bined with high vacuum dehydrated penicillin to
a crystalline form that would retain its potency
for a long period of time over a large temperature
range. The dielectric sewing machine is used to
bond plastic materials into such things as rain
coats and shower curtains. The drying of paper,
dehydration of chemicals, setting of the twist in
synthetic yarn, welding of glass, and the killing of
insects in plant bulbs are a few other present day
examples of the use of dielectric heating.

The end of the possible uses of dielectric heat-
ing is still not in sight. Such things as the pas-
teurizing of milk and beer, sterlization of biolo-
gical materials, and vending machines that will
dispense hot dogs are under development at the
present time, Perhaps within the next few years

water-conducting properties and the depth to
which the water may be carried. The Dakota
sandstone is an excellent example of such an aqui-
fer. Were it not for the hydrostatic pressure ex-
erted by the water flowing down through the
Dakota sandstone from the outcrop in the Rocky
Mountains, the many wells which intercept the
water carrier at great depths would have to lift
the water by pump and at great expense. Actual-
ly the water flows to the surface under a pressure
whose magnitude ranges in the hundreds of
pounds per square inch and can be expected to
rise to elevations only slightly lower than the ele-
vation of the outcrop in the mountains. Because
of the availability of this artesian water many
square miles of land in Southwestern United
States, otherwise of little value, have now been
put to productive use.

The obvious need for water for drinking pur-
poses is almost reason enough to have an under-
standing of the technology of ground water. How-
ever its not so apparent effects are greatly felt in
the mineral industries, in civil engineering pro-
jects, and even in the exploration for oil. In the
driving of tunnels and the working of mines, the
incessant seepage of water where such workings
intersect the water table, aquifers, or the course
of magmatic water, has actually put men's lives

38

in peril or made the continuation of work addi-
tionally expensive. The presence of varying
amounts of ground water may account for the in-
stability of slopes in highway cuts, or the lack of
resistance of soils to shearing or compressive
loads.

The action of chemical erosion by ground
water in its various realms of activity has been
responsible for the formation of such valuable
deposits of minerals as the placer gold of Cali-
fornia, the copper deposits of Northern Michigan,
not to mention the numerous nonmetallic deposits
throughout the United States.

These characteristics of water under the sur-
face of the ground serve to make us all the more
aware of its effect upon our existence. As the
population of our country increases, and the de-
mands of industry grow larger daily, dependable
and adequate supplies of water become increas-
ingly more important. No longer can we depend
upon hit-or-miss methods of exploitations or the
“wiggle stick” exploration of the water diviner.
Only by a concerted well organized plan of re-
search, exploration, and production; uniting the
forces of federal, state, and municipal agencies
can the needs of all be adequately and equitably
met. Fortunately such a plan is now operating in
parts of our country. With its growth and con-
tinuance, there is promise for a future in which
no community will lack water.

LOVE AFFAIR OF EDDY CURRENT

/_,

40

At time t equals zero there lived in a small cavity in a dielectric a poor
struggling dipole by the name of Eddy Current. He was deeply in love
with a beauteous double layer by the name of Anne Ion, the daughter of an
influential force in the town, Cat Ion. Anne was the center of attraction
of the young dipoles of the town; her golden curls, her simple harmonic
motion affected the susceptibilities of all the gay sparks. However, her
father, rich magnet and power factor, had laid down a strict set of bound-
ary conditions for her future husband. Eddy’s first contact with her came
at the time t equals a. As he passed by a beauty parlor on his periodic
orbit, he saw her having a standing wave induced in her filaments. He
made a fine sight in his beautiful doublet and it was a case of mutual polar-
ization.

By a coincidence they met at a dissipation function the following night.
After a few oscillations to the strains of a number (n) by Mo Mentum and
his incandescent Tuning Forks, the couple diffused into the field outside.
There on the Wheatstone Bridge, the young dipole felt his big moment had
arrived.

“Gauss, Anne, you are acute angle, I am d(termined) that U shell
marry me for I sphere I will never be happy without you.”

“Oh, Eddy, don't be so obtuse,” said Anne. “Integrate out here in the
alpha rays tonight.”

“Anne, are you trying to dampen my oscillations? Can’t you see I am
in a state of hysteresis over you?”

“Now Eddy, be a discreet particle. What will father say?”

Eddy did not allow her reluctance to phase him, for he knew it was
only a surface charge. “I admit I only get paid a low calorie in my present
position, but I have potentialities, and I am sure that money cannot B.T.U.
of any importance compared to my love.”

Alas, there was also in this cavity a mean dipole who was resolved to
marry the beauteous Anne, using coercive force if necessary. Hearing
these murmurings of love, he went Pi-i’d with fury and crept stealthfully
upon the couple with velocity (V), his joules drooling with the bestial erg
which moved him. “Low Schmidt !” cried Anne.

“What the infra red are you doing here, you flat-bottomed vial vil1ain?”
demanded Eddy. The situation grew tensor.

Schmidt advanced to choke the beautiful coil. Eddy offered resistance
(R) ; his capacity (C) for absorbing the charge (Q) was low and Schmidt
suffered little lost work content in knocking him out to infinity with a
severe blow on his negative charge. Eddy made a quick comeback with
acceleration (a) stripping off Schmidt’s outer electrons; this so upset the
villain’s equilibrium that he was converted into cosmic radiation and van-
isheg in the realms of space, leaving Eddy the resultant vector in the
com at.

Old Cat Ion, attracted to the spot by Schmidt’s emission, beamed upon
the young dipole. “Brave young lad,” he hummed, “You have satisfied the
boundary conditions and by the Theorem of Uniqueness are the only one for
my daughter.”

“Our love will not be transient,” said Eddy as he formed a closed cir-
cuit about her.

“Darling, we will raise a one parameter family of second order infini-
tesima1s,” murmured Anne happily. As time t approached infinity, they
lived happily.

The Torrington Needle Bearing..-

for designs where light weight is important

Reducing weight without sacri-
ﬁcing performance is one of the
major considerations in many
modern products. Designs are
streamlined to pare off excess
weight. New and lighter materi-
als are being used. Components
which save even a few ounces
frequently contribute greatly to

product success.

Light Weight
Plus High Capacity

The unique design of the Tor-
rington Needle Bearing makes it
ideal for a wide variety of prod-
uct uses. It consists of two com-
ponents — a thin, hardened outer
shell and a full complement of
small diameter rollers. Its many
lines of contact give the Needle
Bearing a greater rated radial
load capacity than any other
type of anti-friction bearing for
its size and weight. Conversely,
for a given load capacity, a
Needle Bearing is the lightest,

most compact bearing available.

Needle Bearings reduce weight and size while providing high radial load capacity.

Weight Savings
In Related Assemblies

In addition to the light weight of
the Needle Bearing, its design
permits sizable reductions in the
size and weight of the related
assemblies. Its small outside di-
ameter allows the use of smaller
housings. And, since a press ﬁt
in a simple straight housing bore
is adequate to locate the bearing,
no complex shoulders or housing

These advantages, plus its

the Torrington Needle Bearing
particularly attractive to the de-

diagonals of a rectangle are equal, GF, like BE,
must be four inches long. Knowing that C re-

easily works out that A’s and B’s parachutes
must open when they are 400 and 500 feet above
the ground, respectively.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

''I needed to ‘Find’ Myself-
thut’s why I picked Iis-Chalmers,"

says A. J. MESTIER
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sc. B.—l943
and now Manager, Syracuse District Office

“I WAS LOOKING for an engineering job,
but I wasn’t very sure just what phase
of this broad ﬁeld would interest me most.
I didn’t know whether I wanted straight
engineering, sales engineering, production
or some other branch of industrial engi-
neering.

“Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training
Course gave me a means of working at
various jobs—seeing what I liked best-
and at the same time obtaining a tremen-
dous amount of information about many
industries in a very short time.”

Experience Typical

“My experience is typical in many ways.
I started the Graduate Training Course in
1946, after three years in the Army. My
ﬁrst request was to go to the Texrope
V-belt drive department. From there I
went to the Blower and Compressor de-
partment; then the Steam Turbine depart-
ment. By the time the course was completed
in 1948, my mind was made up and I knew
I wanted sales work. I was then assigned
to the New York District Oﬁice and in
1950 was made manager of the Syracuse
District. The important thing to note is
that all Allis-Chalmers GTC’s follow this
same program of picking the departments
in which they want to work.

“Best of all, students have a wide choice,
for A—C builds machines for every basic
industry, such as: steam and hydraulic
turbine generators, transformers, pumps,
motors and other equipment for electric
power; rotary kilns, crushers, grinders,
coolers, screens and other machinery for

generator and cathode-ray oscilloscope.

mining, ore processing, cement and rock
processing. Then there is ﬂour milling
machinery, electronic equipment and
many others.”

A Growing Company

“In addition, new developments and the
continuing growth of the company offer
almost endless opportunities for young
engineers.

“From my experience on the Graduate
Training Course, I believe it is one of the
best conducted in the industry and permits
a young engineer to become familiar with
a tremendous variety of equipment—both
electrical and mechanical—which will
serve him in good stead in his future pro-
fession.”

New Ideas

To Keep America Strong in the Air

Aviation progress requires new ideas—and plenty of them. And that’s why North
American always has career opportunities for young engineers who do fresh
thinking. North American is a company that thinks in terms of the future. That’s
why it has been an industry leader for 24 years, designing and developing the
leading planes of World War II, the B-25 Mitchell and F-51 Mustang, and
America’s present day front—line ﬁghters, the F-86 Sabre Jets. Today, North
American is pioneering in many new ﬁelds—guided missile,jet, rocket, electronics,
atomic energy—thinking ahead to keep America strong in the air.

When you are prepared to enter the engineering profession, consider the career
opportunities at North American. In the meantime, feel free to write for any infor-
mation you might want concerning a career in the aircraft industry.

We think engineers are people . . .

That may be an odd statement, but you’ll find there’s a tendency in
some companies to treat engineers like engines . . . You’re so much
high-priced machinery, just another highly-polished cog in a big gear.

Not to us, though.

For nearly 70 years now we've been working with and for engineers,
and by this time we feel we know something about them —— and you.
For example, we know that you’re probably looking for a job that
will let you and help you learn and grow. You want a chance to
prove that you can create, engineering-wise, and that you can handle
responsibility. You want security, but not the kind that means a safe,
dull rut.

If you think we're right in our ideas, you’ll find the Harnischfeger
Corporation is a good place to work — for a good long time. Write
our Training Director today, for a free booklet describing the op-
portunities for engineers with Harnischfeger.

Makes short work
of toll timber

Motorized log-loaders speed their way over rough
terrain to get to a cutting site. Once there, they load
cut timber in a hurry, then head for the next place
they're needed. To keep them on the go without costly
interruptions, designers specify Timken“ tapered
roller bearings in the wheels, cone rollers, swing
drums, steering pivot and other vital moving parts.
Timken bearings have extra load-carrying capacity.
They prevent wear, reduce maintenance. Assure con-
tinuous, trouble-free operation.

How to mount log-lootler tone
rollers on TlMKEN® bearings

This special roller bearing assembly has two single-row
extended bearing cones mounted directly into the roller.
The outer race of the bearing is actually the roller itself
with the tapers ground to the proper angle for the bear-
ing cone and roller assemblies. Closures are pressed \ : I’,/////W
into each end of the roller with running clearance at
the extended cone rib.

baby's crib. Silently she watched him.
As he stood looking down at the
sleeping infant, she saw in his face a
mixture of emotions that she had
never seen before—rapture, admira-

ulity. Touched and wondering alike
at his unusual parental attitude and
the conflicting emotions, his wife,
with eyes glistening, arose and slipped
her arms around him. “A penny for

Advanced Production Techniques and
Experience-—l50 Years of lt—Are Doing
Big Things with Pressure Vessels

Although established in 1802, Scaife Company never has
allowed itself to “grow old.” A unique combination of
engineering skill, production experience and modern
equipment—coupled with Scaife’s intensive research pro-
gram—has resulted in many signiﬁcant accomplishments
in the manufacture of pressure vessels for air, gases and
liquids. For example, one of the most interesting methods
of cold-forming metal in use in this country today is the
Scaife Reverse-Draw Process, a revolutionary method of
forming deep-drawn shapes.

We invite engineers to contact our Personnel Director
for information about the opportunities with the

MY QUESTION TO THE G-E STUDENT INFORMATION PANEL:

"What qualities do I need for a
successful career with a company

like General Electric?”

. . . HARRY K. LEADER, Lafayette College, 1954

Two answers to this question, given at a student information meeting
held in July, l952, between G-E personnel and representative college
students, are printed below. If you have a question you would like
answered, or seek further information about General Electric, mail
your request to College Editor, Dept. 221-6, General Electric Co.,
Schenectady, N. Y.

C. C. HOUSTON, Manti-
facturing Services Division . . .
While this is a rather broad
question, I am sure it is one
of real importance to any
young man starting out 111
industry and looking forward
to :1 position of responsibility
in any of our successful in-
- " - V dustrial enterprises.

The mere asking of this question indicates that the in-
dividual has a deﬁnite goal or objective. This is important
since progress can be made only if we attempt to reach a
well-deﬁned objective——even though it may be modiﬁed
to some extent in the light of later experience. In C.E.
we are looking for young men who have not only deter-
mined their objective but who are ready to work for it—
who accept responsibility and have ability to get things
done—who work well with others——to be a part of the
team.

This calls for other qualities essential to long range
success. We look for the enthusiastic individual, one
not easily discouraged, and who can inspire the confidence
of his co-workers. We desire individuals who show im-
agination and good judgment—particularly the ability to
look ahead and maintain perspective beyond the imme-
diate situation. Finally, We cannot overlook the qualities
of loyalty and dependability since these are important in
steering the individual through periods of discouragement
which occur in every career.

When you decide on your business afﬁliation, make
sure you associate yourself with a company that is
soundly managed, that has a good business future, and
that is the kind of company you would like to be a part
of for the long pull.

  

 

E. S. WILLIS, Corporate
Services Division . . . A
successful career with a
company like General Elec-
tric is built on the same
qualities that contribute to
success in any endeavor.
However, in G.E., there is
additional opportunity to de-
velop these qualities be-
cause of the wide variety of training sources and open-
ings which are available.

Basic qualities needed for any successful career include
an open mind, willingness to accept responsibility, per-
sistence, adaptability, co-operativeness, an common
sense intelligence. Others such as physical well-being,
ability of expression, and sound inquisitiveness also go
to make up a truly qualiﬁed individual.

Most important is the fact that General Electric offers
a wealth of opportunity to develop special capabilities
and talents. The broad selection of training courses, in
any chosen ﬁeld, gives you a chance to sharpen your
basic training and abilities. By decentralizing operations
into about 70 different businesses, there is opportunity
to see—in comprehendable dimensions——the full opera-
tion of the business. It means, too, that senior managers
and young employees are more closely associated——a
real advantage for the young man on his way up.

Also, our business requires specialists as Well as
managers. Thus, there are equal chances for success for
those who concentrate in particular ﬁelds such as re-
search, design,’ accounting, and planning.

So set your cap for a goal. And capitalize on your
native qualities, which fortunately are different with
each of us.
