The articles and features presented
in the March issue of the SKY-
SCRAPER ENGINEER have been
written with the emphasis on the ex-
act facts written by experts in the
field.

Our lead article was written by
Richard McMahon and is entitled
“The 400 MPH Challenger.” Rich
has been interested in cars for the
last ten_ years. He went to great
lengths to get the correct information
and best pictures available for the
article. This included a phone call to
Mickey Thompson, builder of the
Challen-ger, in California. Mickey
was very cooperative and, as you will
readily see, provided us with some
fine pictures from his private file.

The Skyscraper is proud to an-
nounce the Outstanding Senior
Awards. These annual awards are
given to the students that show the
qualities of scholarship, and out-

Silicon Rectifiers, by Paul 
Segas, E.E. ’6O describes the tre-
mendous advantages provided by
the use of semiconductor devices in
high power industrial rectification
applications. Paul became interested
in silicon rectifier units while survey-
ing the present uses of semiconductor
devices in Pittsburgh industries.
These uses, incidentally ranged from
minimum power electronics appli-
cations to these super-powered mid-
gets providing D C power for heavy
industry.

Dr. Paul Sherwood, Director of
the University Placement Service, in
his article, “First Job Jitters,” dis-
cusses a point close to the hearts of
all seniors. Many problems face the

new graduate embarking on a career
in industry. Many uncertainties arise
which must be dealt with immediate-
ly and decisively. Dr. Sherwood tells
us how to deal with these problems
and uncertainties and how to avoid

t h e psychological phenomenon
known as “First Job Jitters.”

Color Television,’ by Neal Walko,
E.E. ’6O tells about the problems
encountered in the development of
this amazing electronic accomplish-
ment and the unique ways in which
these problems were solved. Neal, as
a senior Electrical Engineer, is par-
ticularly interested in the problems
encountered in the electronics in-
dustry and their solutions. His article
is a thorough and enlightening treat-
ment of the solving of an almost un-
surmountable problem by today’s
engineers. .

 All AROUND YOU!

The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
But there is quite another kind of “space” close at hand, a kind that will always
challenge the genius of man.

This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
distance between them . . . the kind of space found between mainland and off-
shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply

‘ tween all earthbound places.

.. Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
aircraft conﬁgurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-
hicles that can prove to be tomorrow’s most versatile means of transportation.

Here, then, is a space age challenge to be met with the ﬁnest and most practical
engineering talent. Here, perhaps, is the kind of challenge you can meet.

IS OUR BUSINESS

In 194-7, the late John Cobb hurtled across the salt
flats of Bonneville, Utah, at over 403 miles per hour.
Less than an hour later, the sounds of exhaust, engines
and gears rose once more to a screaming crescendo as he
returned from the opposite direction. His average time
of 394.196 miles per hour still stands as the fastest ever
attained by man on the face of the earth. Behind his
achievement lay a cash investment of over $100,000 and
the pooled results of the greatest scientific engineering
talents in the world. Cobb’s car, now twenty-two years
old, still holds the respect of automotive design engineers
and aerodynamists.

Many have tried to design a better car for future
attempts at the record, most of them eventually dis-
covered there was little room for improvement. However,
Mickey Thompson felt he had the correct answers for
all the questions or problems that have either stopped
or delayed other contenders.

The foundation of any car is its tires; the rest of
the machine _is designed around them. Mickey went to
big manufacturers of high speed tires and asked them
for help, for “skins” that would hold together at 450
mph. Most people didn’t take him seriously until he went
to Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. Goodyear had

worked with Mickey in Mexico, knew him to be a doer
not a dreamer. Goodyear agreed to put its jet-aircraft

experience behind Mickey’s dream. Months later the
promised tires were a reality and the fabulous iron horse

12

was shod. The tires were only 29.65 inches in diameter
and were tubeless.

Most high—speed tires to date have been designed
around the concept of building their growth into them,
of accepting as inevitable a great deal of growth at
high speeds. Goodyear took the approach of building
the greatest possible growth restriction into the LSR
(Land Speed Record).

Cobb’s tires, made by Dunlop, had taken a step in
this direction with a shortening of the sidewall. By ap-
proaching a semi-circular cross section instead of a
purely circular one, there was less sidewall to grow
under great centrifugal force.

In appearance, Goodyear’s answer to an ‘LSR tire
is the most r-adically different automotive tire of all
time. The cross section is a low oval which has a broad,
flat tread surface. This new shape is achieved by
means of the lowest cord angle (angle between cord
and circumferential center line of tire) ever used, an
undisclosed number of plies and, on top of them, a nest
of restraining plies. Thus, immense circumferential
strength is built into the tire, and its growth at 400
mph is held slightly less than one inch; also, optimum
contact area is preserved throughout the speed range.

Next Mickey had to choose power plants that could
produce at least 2000 horsepower but yet would be
small enough to fit in a chassis no more than five feet
wide. He chose 4 Pontiacs, 2 mounted side by side in

the front and a similar arrangement at the rear. They
were bored and stroked to a total displacement of 1556
cu. in. developing 1600 HP on gasoline, 1800 to 2000
HP on a mixture of methanol and nitro and 2400 HP
on straight nitromethane. Of course, there were many
other “goodies” such as fuel injectors, special cams,
magnetos and new aluminum racing heads designed
and built by Cliff Collins of Harmon-Collins, Inc.

Cobb’s car had three-speed transmissions for each
of its two engines and the final drive ratio was achieved
through special differentials. Its engines developed peak
performance at a relatively slow 3500 rpm and this fac-
tor, along with the use of large tires, 42-inch diameter,
let the pinion gear turn at a rather conservative speed.

Thompson’s proposed drive line, presented a seri-
ous problem. To achieve a final gear ratio of 1.20 to 1
through special gears in normal quick-change differ-
entials with the use of 30 inch tires and the engine
turning at 5800 rpm demanded that the speed of the
pinion gears would be almost 20,000 rpm; a very un-
suitable factor that could well result in burned out rear
ends on every run.

Mickey used this problem to serve a two-fold pur-
pose. He designed an overdrive unit for each of the
four wheels. The principal is very similar to the basic
quick-change idea but, when mounted at the ends of
the axles in a line parallel with the chassis, the offset
gear change units were all pointed toward the center
of the chassis with the result that the overall wheelbase
was shortened by almost ten inches. Each engine now
drives through its own three-speed Cadillac transmis-
sion; through a cyclone quick-change differential with
a ratio of 2.65 to 1; and then through its own wheel-
overdrive unit with a final resultant gear ration of 1.29
to 1. The speeds of all gears were thus reduced to a
point where they enjoy a rather healthy safety factor
and the overall size of the car was substantially reduced.

John Cobb’s record holder, which was designed
by Reid Railton, weighted almost 7000 pounds and
developed 2500 horsepower. Thompson’s car weighs
only 4500 pounds. Cobb’s huge engines required 90
gallons of coolant while the hot rod’s four Pontiacs
need only ten gallons each. Fuel is heavier by about 50

pounds for his four engines consume about 5 gallons
each per run. With a reserve supply of two gallons per
engine he needs 28 gallons at the beginning of each
run. Cobb’s total fuel supply was limited at only 21.6
gallons.

The Railton-designed Cobb machine has been ac-
cepted by all as probably the most functionally designed
car ever to appear on the salt. The attempt to improve
on Railton’s design was one of the most difficult tasks
of the project. The responsibility of body design was
given to George Hill who had furnished the design for
Mickey’s experimental 300 miles per hour twin-engine
car the year before. Hill’s design for that car, originally
planned for speeds in the neighborhood of 200 miles
per hour on drag strips, worked very well on the salt
flats at over 290 miles per hour and the machine was
so stable at top speed that Mickey could ascertain his
true speed, through engine tackometers, within two
miles per hour during every run.

Thompson made a few demands of his own before
design work was begun. He requested the front wheels
be left open at the sides and that the driver’s cockpit
be placed behind the rear axle. Furthermore, he did
not want a design that called for a horizontal plane at
the rear of the car. As all three requests were based on
successful results achieved during tests of the experi-
mental car, Hill agreed and body design work was be-

gun.

Hill did not have to start from scratch. He was
armed with facts and figures gained through study of
his basic design as applied to the experimental car. Ac-
tually, the problem became one of enlarging the shape
of th experimental car to a size where it could contain
the four engines of the new chassis and then cleaning
up the lines. _

Cobb’s car was 28 feet, 8 inches long while Thomp-
son's is only 19 feet, 7 inches. Cobb’s car was 8 feet
wide and Thompson’s is one inch less than five feet
wide. Cobb’s car was 51 inches high and Thompson’s
is only 39 inches high. The advantage in the new car
.is not quite as great as the proportional difference in
the sizes of the two machines for its shape is not quite
as clear as the Railton designed machine. However, the
great difference in the sizes of the two does indicate a
decided advantage for the small car.

The body for Thompson’s car, like Cobb’s, was
formed from aluminum sheets by California Metal
Shapers, builders of most of the Indianapolis race car
bodies.

On July 27, 1959, Goodyear invited the Press to
the car‘s first showing to be held at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel. The car was hurriedly finished and appeared in
its bare aluminum shell.

The next high point was the car’s first trial run,
which was held on Muroc Dry Lake in the Mojave
Desert on August 9, 1959. At the end of the first mile it
was accelerating hard, still in low gear, and had just

been clocked at 173 mph when he hit a smallbump and
the car leaped three feet into the air. It remained air-
borne for 66 feet, landed 20 feet off course and went
into a tremendous looping 220 mph spin. Mickey finally
righted the car and coas-ted to a stop. He was shaken
and bruised, but cool and cheerful. The skid had ruined
the surface of his tires but their casings had withstood
the punishment. The car’s acceleration and handling
were beyond Mickey’s wildest hopes.

Then came the Bonneville National Speed Trials,
August 23 through Augus-t 29, 1959. Run after run the
car’s speed was increased. Then, after a run in the low
300’s, the Challenger’s parachute brake began whipping
violently, eventually yanked the car into a sideways
slide with it tacking about 280 mph. The slide lasted
for over 1000 feet and left black marks on the salt.
But this produced only slight, superficial scratches on
the tread surfaces and the tires were so unaffected by
the slide that they were used for subsequent runs. Dur-
ing the slide no contained air was lost and great lateral
stability of the tires demonstrated. The braking was
corrected by increasing the chute area and lengthening
its lead. Finally, on Saturday, Mickey set a two-way
record of 330.51 mph. 0

Mickey did not go after john Cobb’s 394 mph
LSR during the Nationals simply because the F IA,
auto racing’s international regulating body, does not
yet recognize the clocks and the men at the Bonneville
Trials. Sometime this coming spring Mickey will prob-
ably make the run for 400 .

Formerly, high output tubes had been available for
lon-g wave radio transmission, but it was not possible to
concentrate the waves in any one direction. The power
was spread and dissipated in accordance with the in-
verse square law of distance. However, microwave sig-
nals can be focused into small diameter beams and
transmitted for long distances with extremely high
efficiencies. With the invention of a tube that could
handle enough input and output energy to make wire-
less" power transmission practicable, a new concept has
been advanced called the sky station.

In this concept, a sky station could be flown into
position at a ten mile height with chemical propulsion
and then kept flying by power transmission through
a high intensity microwave energy beam. The station
could be kept hovering in the same place almost indefin-

ately through the power link to the ground.

The station itself is on s ned as being a large
rotary-wing aircraft that wo “cl -fly in much the same
way as the helicopter. The most economical means of
hoverin-g would require that large volume of air be
put into relatively slow moti nd the rotary-wing air-
craft is the only vehicle whic an fulfill all the require-
ments of hovering, controllability and the ability to
perform well under a variet f atmospheric conditions.

The vehicle would be pow by a gas turbine pow-
er plant driving compressed through the rotor tips.
Density of air at a height n miles is sufficient to
accomplish this purpose.

Power will be generated a

   
  
  
 
 
  
   

e ground by a battery of

 

 
 

V3,‘,  1- 5

Amplitrons and transmitted to the sky station by a
group of antennas in a 400 foot square area. The beams
of microwave energy will be focused like a battery of
searchlights and will converge at the sky station to a
circular spot of less than 100 feet in diameter.

At the underside of the station, a circular antenna
of almost the same diameter as the microwave beam will
receive the energy and conduct it through waveguides
to ‘lossy” elements that can convert the microwave
energy to heat. Compressed air that is heated by the
“lossy” elements will then drive the heat turbine which
will in turn provide compressed air for the rotor tips.

In the event of severe thunder storm activity, which
is the only possibility of attenuation of the microwave
power supply, a supplementary chemical power supply
could be used to keep the station aloft. Studies have
shown that a few hundred pounds of fuel would be
necessary to accomplish this emergency job. When the
station descends, its low wing loading would allow the
vehicle to auto-rotate safely to ground level with only
a small amount of fuel needed for manuevering.

Stabilization and location will be maintained by tilt-
ing the rotor in relation to the fuselage. For example,
a 30 feet per second sharp edge gust could be easily
compensated for by a rotor tilt of less than one degree.
Sensing elements for location will include accelerometers
mounted on a stabilized platform and also microwave
beam sensors. Through the use of the sensors and the
stabilization by the rotor, the sky station’s position over
the microwave-beam can be maintained within a few
feet.

The effeciency of power output at the sky station to
power input at the ground level is remarkably high. A
study of the power requirements of a typical station
shows that approximately 1000 rotor horsepower would
be required. The efficiency of the ground power trans-
mitting antenna is 65 per cent, the pattern efficiency
is 75 per cent, the efficency of the airborne power re-
ceiving antenna is 65 per cent, and the propulsion sys-
tem has a 30 percent efficiency. This means that the
over-all efficiency from ground to rotor is 9.6 per cent.
Therefore, the total microwave power required at the
ground would be 10,000 horsepower. To supply 10,000
horsepower of electricity, 20,000 horsepower of gen-
erating capacity would be required. This is the ap-
proximate horsepower developed by a Conair 880 jet
liner.

Numerous uses have been proposed for the sky station.
One suggested use has been for communication purposes.
A few sky stations, hovering at points over the Atlantic,
could give direct line of sight transmission of signals.
Television programs from Europe could be beamed di-
rectly to the United States with little effect from iono-
sphere disturbances. The tight beams can provide com-
munications privacy without message coding. At
microwave frequencies, bandwidths as great as 39 mega-
cycles can be used. Such a system could provide for
400 secure PCM channels, 16,000 kilobit per second
data link channels and 160,000 TWX channels. Over
100,000 telegraph messages could also be handled

simultaneously. Naturally, this would cut communica-
tion costs to a fraction of what they now are.

Another important function of the sky station could
be the early detection and tracking of aircraft. Several
stations, equipped with radar, situated across the North
Atlantic would extend the DEW line to Europe. Plat-
forms near the sea could -give peripheral radar coverage
down to sea level for 600 to 1000 miles. Equipped plat-
forms such as these could be used by SAGE centers
(Air Defense Warning Centers) to vector interceptor
weapons to targets at great distances. The accurately
positioned sky stations would allow great precision in
locatin-g and tracking ICBM or airbreathing missles
launched from the sea.

Other uses for the station might include use by aerial
traffic controllers, earlier and more accurate weather
forecasting and as a base from which to gain more infor-
mation about our atmosphere.

The idea of the sky station has been analyzed and
evaluated by many different organizations as to its
feasibility and usefulness. Aeronautical engineers, pro-
pulsion specialists, helicopter specialists and military
tacticians have all given their approval. The missing
element up to the present time had been the efficient
generation of microwave power at the ground. The de-
velopment of the Amplitron by William C. Brown of
Raytheon has provided an answer to this problem.
Previous tubes had been limited by internal heat prob-
lems due to their size and inefficiency. The Amplitron’s
efficiency of as high as 80 percent, coupled with newly
designed cooling systems, will allow hundreds of horse-
power to be converted to microwave energy by a single
tube. 3000 megacycle tubes of 20 horsepower are now
available and 500 horsepower tubes are expected to be
available after a three year development program.

If the sky station plans materialize, we may be able
to see the Follies Bergere on our television sets as it
occurs in Paris or to call Europe for little more than
it now costs to call New York. The sky station may
also serve as sentinels on guard to protect our country
from its enemies.’

Achieving Economic Stability
by Applying Control
Engineering Methods

BY DR. EBERHARD FELS

It has been said that national defense is much too
serious a business to be left to mere generals. People
also insist that the national economy is too serious a
business to be left to mere economists. Academically
trained economists can point out, that unfortunately,
they do not run the economy, and that all might be
well if policy-makers would only listen to them. It is
not the economist’s tools but the policy-maker’s erratic,
clumsy, sluggish, and biased use and abuse of these
tools that should get the blame for an economic system
with shocking defects amidst prodigious achievements.

We shall not carry the capitation of our prospective
readers to the length of saying that our economy could
———let alone should——be designed and redesigned the way
thermostats and automatic pilots are. Neither shall we
imply that the Laplace transform and the Nyquist dia-
gram are near-substitutes for an intimate knowledge
of the existin-g institutions and a truly humanistic over-
all view of man, his value, and his values.

After, and only after, this has been said, one must
however, acknowledge that problems df economic sta-
bilization do have something in common with problems
of, say, temperature stabilization. The thermostat on
the wall has something in common with the Federal Re-
serve System. Both are control devices. Moreover, com-
mon thermostats are sufficiently well designed for their
control job, whereas, the connoisseurs agree, the Federal
Reserve System, simply as a matter of record, is very
poorly designed for its control job.

If, therefore, talking economics in terms of control-
systems engineering is riot going to save the world, it
still may provide valuable insights into the working of
the economy, and it already has provided some. Let us,
then, build a little model step by step.

We shall keep matters almost unrealistically simple.
Let us disregard national-accounting definitional nice-
ties and talk about the rate of flow of current produc-
tion (measured in physical units per year), or produc-
tion. The rate of flow of the amount of goods

22

demanded (also measured in physical units per year),
is demand. What we call production according to the
definition just given is also identical with the rate of
flow of income (measured in real terms, that is, in
terms of commodities and services purchasable with
the money income), or income.

We assume just two relationships: First, production
adjusts itself to demand, possibly after a time lag. Sec-
ond, demand varies with incomc—or, by definition,
with pr0duction—without significant time lag.

Assume further that there is some level of produc-
tion which it is desired to maintain, for instance, a level
of production that results in a low level of unemploy-
ment, or in a constant price index of consumer goods,
or in some other desirable end. Note: The problem just
what constitutes a desirable level of production is ob-
viously not an engineering problem; it is even more
than an economic problem, but we shall naively regard
it as solved.

At any time, there will be a difference between actual
production and desired production. This difference will
be called the production error.

What does it mean to say that we want a stabiliza-
tion policy for this little model? To begin with, the pro-
duction error has to be noticed and measured. Then
corrective action has to be taken~—for instance, by
changing government expenditure, taxation, and so on;
in our model, demand must be changed in a direction
which tends to eliminate the error.

So far, our model can be depicted putting whatever
“corrective policy” we have in a black box, with the
error as input and with proper doses of induced de-
mand and output.

From the formal point of view—that is, disregarding
problems of political and institutional implementation——
there are essentially three kinds of corrective action.
First, proportional stabilization policy: the action for a
change of demand is made proportional in magnitude
and opposite in sign to the time integral of the produc-

tion error. Third, derivative stabilization policy: the
action for a change of demand is made proportional in
magnitude and Opposite in sign to the time derivative
of production. We now see the former “corrective poli-
cy" black box broken down into its components, namely,
three types of stabilization pOlicy—actually, three neg-
ative feed-baek coefficients. Two further boxes show
that integration or differentiation is performed in two
cases, and another box makes allowances for a correc-
tion-tirne lag.

We shall say very little about the observation that,
no matter what the physical realization, a judicious
choice of a mixture of the three types of policy works
best. An integral policy by itself typically causes over-
shooting. A proportional policy alone stabilizes all right
but typically not at the desired level, and so On. It is,
of course, with such problems that the control-systems
engineer has-a field day.

We shall even say less about the problem how to im-
plement the various policies. in a democratic framework.
Which kinds Of known economic—policy measures are of
the integral type? Which are of the proportional type?
These are clearly not engineering questions although,
again, many extant institutions can be shown to be
poorly “engineered.”

We shall now put the policy loops in a black box
again, and make other additions. We have taken “dis-
turbances” into consideration, which is our catch-all
term for all kinds of imperfectly predictable economic
events which cause a difference between demand as en-
visaged by the stabilization policy and actual demand.
So, in keeping with our assumptions, the input to the
production-tirne lag box is actual demand, the output
Of_ this box is production (which, we said, would adjust
itself to demand.)

Apart from this detail, we have incorporated a new
loop which is tantamount to what economists call
“the multiplier.” The idea is this: If for some reason
production goes up, income goes up. Part Of the income
is saved (depending on the “marginal propensity to
save”); the rest, however, is spent, hence, constitutes
demand. Thus, more production leads to more demand,
which, after a production-time lag, leads to even more
production, and so on. This works both ways: If produc-

DESIRED PRODUCTION
PRODUCTION + ERROR

tion goes down income goes down, demand goes down,
such that, with a time lag, production goes down even
further. In certain contexts this multiplier loop may be
a beneficial device. But one thing it is not: It is not a
stabilizer. The multiplier (Or rather “marginal propen-
sity to save”) coefficient is a positive feed-back co-
efficient.

We again add another loop for what is known as
the “accelerator” in economics. A simplified account is
this: If production goes up, a producer may not buy
just one machine to replace a worn-out one, but two:
one for replacement, the other to take care of the ad-
ditional demand which he anticipates for his product.
If, on the other hand, production goes down (in adjust-
ment to slackening demand), a producer may postpone
the replacement of a worn-out machine; the other ma-.
chines he has may be enough to fill his orders; his
demand for machines goes down, and so On. Again, the
accelerator may be a good thing after depressions, but
it is not a built-in stabilizer, rather the opposite.

SO far, we have disregarded prices. Let us consider
now what happens if prices intervene. If production
goes up, the amount of money needed for transactions
increases. The——sOmewhat Old-fashiOned—assumption
made here is that the -banks do not realize in time what
goes on and that the increased demand for funds pushes
up interest rates. Also, it is assumed——the empirical
evidence for this is weak—that higher interest rates
cause many investment projects to be postponed Qr
abandoned because they will not look profitable any
more. Thus higher interest rates depress the propensity
to invest ,and hence, other things being equal, demand
will decrease. SO, if this mechanism works, we have a
negative feed-back.

We may now go a step further and show other as-
pects of what is usually called the “price mechanism.”
Changes in production affect, as we have argued,
the transactions demand for money and hence interest
rates. Apart from that, however, changes in production
affect prices (which then, once more, affect interest
rates; after all, interest rates are prices). There is more.
If prices go down, then the same amount Of money buys
more goods, hence <Ome money is “left over” for saving
and will (at least for a while) be taken out of the in-

come stream. This makes demand smaller than it would
otherwise be, and so on (with analogous consequences
for movements in the opposite direction). This “cash-
balance effect” works as a negative feed-back. Thus
there is——with many qualifications to be added—con-
siderable ground for regarding price mechanisms
(where they are still intact) as stabilizers, and it is
safe to say that there has been in recent years a re-
awakening‘ of the concern over, and belief in, the im-
portant role and potency of prices, even, somewhat
reluctantly, behind the Iron Curtain.

Actually one could go on and add further loops for
the interpendencies of inventories, prices, demand, pro-
duction, and so on, along the same principles.

After the net-work as such has been made to look
more or less realistic, and after obtaining good estimates
of the values of the various feed-back coefficients, what
are the chances for smooth, efficient, economic stabili-
zation?

Dr. A. W. Phillips of the London School of Econ-
omics——of whose model we have given a simplified ac-
count—has investigated this problem with the help of
an electronic simulator. The upshot is that the prospects
for economic stabilization are not good. It is not so
much the particular values of coefficients involved that
cause difficulties. Rather, delays in taking action make

regulation well-nigh impossible. Also, in reality, when
action is taken, it usually comes too late to be just the
right medicine, and it comes too abruptly. Phillips feels
that, starting from realistic assumptions, it is unlikely
that the period needed to restore any desired equilibri-
um situation after a severe disturbance could be much
less than two years, even if the regulating authorities
use the most appropriate policies. Others are not less
pessimistic.

Clearly, this poses a challenge. The problem of how
to prevent giddy ups and downs in the economy and
secure steadily rising levels of well-distributed welfare
within an institutional framework that guarantees the
individual’s dignity and—within limits—his freedoms
of choice, this problem has not only been solved, it
has often been dodged, and it is almost daily distorted
by unctuous editorial writers. Meanwhile the experts
agree that some institutional reforms are overdue in
monetary and fiscal control. For us, of course, “better
control” means “democratic control.” But when it
comes to the specification of details that make for the
highest efficiency, the expert is the man to ask. And
strange as it may sound, a background in servomechan-
ism theory may in this context be of more value than
having read Adam Smith. Adam Smith, I think, would
be the first to agree. .

The field has never been broader
The challenge has never been greater

Engineers at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft today are concerned
with the development of all forms of ﬂight propulsion
systems—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and other advanced
types for- propulsion in space. Many of these systems are so
entirely new in concept that their design and development,
and allied research programs, require technical personnel
not previously associated with the development of aircraft
engines. Where the company was once primarily interested
in graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering, it now also requires men with degrees in
electrical, chemical, and nuclear engineering, and in physics,
chemistry, and metallurgy.

Included in a wide range of engineering activities open to
technically trained graduates at all levels are these four
basic ﬁelds-:

ANALYTICAL ENGINEERING Men engaged in this
activity are concerned with fundamental investigations in
the ﬁelds of science or engineering related to the conception
of new products. They carry out detailed analyses of ad-
vanced ﬂight and space systems and interpret results in
terms of practical design applications. They provide basic
information which is essential in determining the types of
systems that have development potential.

DESIGN ENGINEERING The prime requisite here is an
active interest in the application of aerodynamics, thermo-
dynamics, stress analysis, and principles of machine design
to the creation of new ﬂight propulsion systems. Men en-
gaged in this activity at P&WA establish the speciﬁc per-
formance and structural requirements of the new product
and design it as a complete working mechanism.

EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING Here men supervise
and coordinate fabrication, assembly and laboratory testing
of experimental apparatus, system components, and devel-
opment engines. They devise test rigs and laboratory setups,
specify instrumentation and direct execution of the actual
test programs. Responsibility in this phase of the develop-
ment program also includes analysis of test data, reporting
of results and recommendations for future effort.

MATERIALS ENGINEERING Men active in this ﬁeld
at P&WA investigate metals, alloys and other materials
under various environmental conditions to determine their
usefulness as applied to advanced ﬂight propulsiontsystems.
They devise ‘material testing methods and design special
test equipment. They are also responsible for the determina-
tion of new fabrication techniques and causes of failures or
manufacturing diﬂiculties.

Why diversification makes a better all-around man

DIVERSIFICATION of eﬁort makes for versatility—and ver-
satility pays off in business as well as on the athletic
ﬁeld. We’ve found that to be especially true here at Koppers.
Koppers is a widely diversiﬁed company—actiVely en-
gaged in the research and production of a wide range of re-
lated and seemingly unrelated products, such as remarkable
new plastics, jet-engine sound control, wood preservatives,
steel mill processes, dyestuffs, electrostatic precipitators, coal
tar chemicals, anti-oxidants and innumerable others.
Because we are diversiﬁed, our work is interesting. Through
a system of lateral movement, our engineers and manage-
ment personnel are given the opportunity to learn many of
the diverse operations at Koppers. The result? Versatility.
While you are moving laterally at Koppers, you are also
moving up. Your responsibilities are increased. Your ability
is evaluated and re-evaluated. And you are compensated
accordingly.
You don’t have to be with Koppers for 20 years before you

get somewhere. If you have ability, ideas, spark—you’ll move
ahead, regardless of seniority or tenure.

At Koppers, you’l1 stand on your own two feet. You’ll get
responsibility, but you’ll also have free rein to do the job the
way you think it should be done. No one will get in your way.

Koppers is a well-established company—a leader in many
ﬁelds. Yet, it’s a forward-looking company, a young man’s
company. Perhaps, your company.

Why not ﬁnd out? Write to the Manager of Manpower

Silicon Rectifiers

Semiconductors have reduced the size,
upped the efficiency, and increased the
range of application of modern

rectifier units.

The science of semiconductors has made incredible
advances in the past decade. Semiconductor devices
have been made to amplify, rectify, switch, count, oscil-
late, and , in fact, -to perform most of the operations
which heretofore only vacuum tubes could perform.
These advances in semiconductor technology have re-
sulted in an era of electronic miniaturization through the
use of semiconductor devices instead of the conventional
vacuum tubes. This miniaturization is evidenced by our
missile programs and also by the influx of pocket sized
transistor radios on the market.

Following the trend of miniaturization, industry has
developed a 6000 KW rectifier unit in which silicon
semiconductor devices do the work of converting large
amounts of AC power to DC power for use in the pro-
duction of aluminum. Although these “miniature” recti-
lier units measure nine feet wide by five feet deep by
ten feet high they replace huge rotating rectifying equip-
ment of at least: twice this size for the same power rating.
In addition, through the use of semiconductors, the al-
lowable ambient temperatures in rectifiers has been in-
creased to 150 degrees centigrade.

To understand how these modern rectifier units are
able to accomplish so much in so little space, it is neces-
sary to understand the principles of semiconductor
theory. A semiconductor, as the name implies, has some
properties of conductors and other properties of insula-
tors. One distinguishing feature is its negative tempera-
ture coefficient of resistivity. As the tempra-ture of the
semiconductor is increased, the resistance decreases.
Semiconductors, unlike conductors, have no free elec-
trons. The valence electrons are part of a stable bond
between atoms. The semiconductor differs from the in-
sulator, whose valence electrons also form a stable bond,
in the energy required to break this bond. This energy in
the insulator is quite large compared to the energy neces-
sary in a semiconductor.

The most commonly known semiconductors are
germanium and silicon. Germanium has been widely
used in transistor devices and low voltage, low power

rectifiers. Germanium has also found some use in the
power rectifier field. Silicon however has decided ad-

28

BY PAUL J. SEGAS

vantages over germanium for use in semiconductor pow-
er rectifiers.

Silicon rectifiers have a wide range of junc-tion tem-
perature. Permissible ranges are from -65 to 190 degrees
centigrade. In addition, silicon rectifiers provide effici-
encies up to 95 per cent due to their low forw-ard drop
and high reverse voltage characteristics. These advan-
tages result in the silicon rectifier with more power con-
version per volume of space than any other type of
rectifier. Current densities are as high as 1200 amperes
per inch compared to about 1 ampere per inch for
silenium and 700 amperes per inch for germanium.

To achieve this efficiency, the silicon used in the
manufacture of silicon cells must be as low as 1 part per
six billion. The cells are manufactured from single crys-
tals of this virtually pure silicon. Single crystals of ma-
terial such as salt or sugar are common, but growing
single crystals of silicon requires high precision control

of temperature and rate of growing.

In the manufacturing process a seed crystal is low-
ered into molten silicon and then gradually withdrawn.
The temperature is maintained within plus or minus one
degree of 1900 degrees centigrade and the seed is rotated
slowly as it is withdrawn. Small changes in withdrawl
rate, speed of rotation, or temperature will produce un-
desirable qualities in the crystal.

The grown silicon crystal is next sliced with a dia-
mond wheel, etched and cleaned. It is then combined
with alloy material to provide the correct characteristics,
and fused into the basic cell. The silicon and alloy are
sandwiched between two pieces of molybdenum, which

has a thermal coefficient closely matching silicon. This‘

basic cell is then sealed into a case and plated.

Next the unit undergoes a power test in which it is
classified according to voltage. It is also checked for
thermal characteristics.

The electrical characteristics of silicon rectifiers are
quite different from other types of metallic rectifiers.

Some of these characteristics are those which permit
more power for reduced size units, but others are such
that the application of silicon rectifiers requires special
attention. For example, leakage begins to rise rapidly
with reverse voltage once the rated voltage of a semi-
conductor cell is exceeded.

The allowable reverse voltage, however, is low and
the energy which can be absorbed in the reverse direction
is correspondingly low. As a result, unless a safety mar-
gin of at least three to one is allowed between the oper-
ating voltage and the maximum allowable peak voltage,
switching hazards may result.

In the forward direction, the peak current is. ap-
proximately three times the average current per cell. The
dynamic resistance is small and slight variation of the
forward drop will present difficulties in paralleling the
cells. The current division across paralleled units may be
different, resulting in dangerous over—loading of one cell.

MARCH 1960

To overcome this difficulty the units to be paralleled are
specially matched and measures are taken to insure that
the silicon cells will parallel perfectly.

Trouble is encountered in the series connection of
‘units, also due to the small dynamic resistance. To avoid
this trouble a resistor divider network is used to divide
the reverse voltage, keeping it within a safe range of
values. Since the reverse leakage is low at values below
rated voltage, power losses as a result of the divider net-
work are not appreciable.

Because of the small thermal mass of the silicon
rectifier cells, voltage and current surges must be con-
sidered and protective systems devised. One means of
protection from current surges is the addition of re-
actance to limit the overload currents to a safe value
until overload protection devices are actuated. With the
present technology it is felt that there is no upper limit
to either voltage or current in the applications of silicon
rectifiers. As many as 20 cells may be operated directly
in parallel, as in one 3000 KW electrochemical rectifier
unit. For electrical precipitrons where high voltage sup-
plies are needed, two hundred cells have been connected
in series to supply the high voltage.

The application of silicon rectifier units are almost
without limit. They are used in aircraft, plating electro-
chemical supplies, circuit breaker -actuators, automotive
applications, and many general duty DC supplies.

Unlike previous rotating converters, silicon rectifiers
do not wear and thus provide true economy and trouble-
free operation. Industry can thus look forward. to an
economical, virtually unlimited supply of DC power.

F irsf Job Jiﬂers

What can be done to eliminate "first job iiﬂers"?
Dr. Paul Sherwood discusses the use of critical self-

evaluation.

D uring the final school term of every year the Place-
ment Office sees. a continuous flow of seniors who are
worried about whether or not they are going to get jobs.
After they are offered jobs and have accepted those jobs,
they are worried then as to whether or not they will be
able to do the work that is going to be expected of them.
We have come to call this latter situation a case of the
“first job jitters.” The “first job jitters” is a disease
which is very common and, being common, may not
seem to be very serious. It may be likened, however, to
the common cold which, if allowed to progress without
any sort of treatment, may develop into something that
is very serious. The purpose of this brief treatise is to
help get rid of the symptons which we commonly know
as the “first job jitters.”

Anytime a person starts into a new activity he is
bound to have some fear and trepidation about the out-
come of this first experience. The first dive into the
water on a beginning day of a swimming season always
causes the person some slight hesitation because he’s
just not quite sure how cold that water is. However, after
he has done this for a few years on that first day, he finds
that he has been able to live through it and that though
the water be cold or warm, his body is able to make the
adjustments necessary to let him have a good time and
enjoy himself while swimming. At any rate, the first
time we try anything new we are bound to be a little
hesitant about it and we are bound to have some mis-
givings as to whether or not we are going to be success-
ful. I know that this is true as seniors approach their
first post-college jobs. So what can be done about this?
What are some of the remedies we can apply to help get
rid of this case of the “first job jitters?”

First, I think that each man as he approaches this
first job should sit down and try to see himself in the
truest light possible. He should try to put down on paper
what he is. He should try to assess his physical character-
istics first of all. “What kind of energy do I have? Do I
need an excessive amount of sleep? Do I have the ner-
vous energy and the emotional drive to allow me to pro-
ceed for a long period of time on a given project? Some
of -the jobs I may be assigned will require me to work
for eight, ten, twelve hours for a long stretch without
very much relief. What kind of physical attributes do I
have? In other words, what kind and quality of an en-
gine do I have?”

The second point that a man should try to assess in

30

BY DR. PAUL SHERWOOD

a reasonable self appraisal procedure would be what
kind of social being he is. “How do I get along with my
fellowmen? Do I look to them for leadership? Do I
look to them for suggestions? Do I wait until I am told
what the problem is -and what a possible solution is or
am I the one who sees the problem? Am I the one who
takes responsibility? Am I the one who is able to help
other people work on a problem and guide their way?
Am I able to express myself well because if I am going
to move to a position of leadership I must have this abili-
ty. I must not only be able to express myself well but I
must be able to put myself into the other fellow’s shoes.
How successful am I in understanding what his problems
are, in making him understand our common problems
and getting him to work with me or work as part of a
team in solving these problems? Am I comfortable in
what we might call the “society” type of social relation-
ships. Many of -the jobs which I may be called upon to
do will depend on my ability to move into a social situa-
tion with which I have not had much experience. Am I
going to be comfortable in this? Can I develop myself
‘into the kind of person that is able to do this sort of
thing? Then I would want to know a little bit about my
economic background and what my economic needs are
and how I handle my financial matters.

After looking at these physical, social, and economic
strengths and weaknesses and appraising myself and see-
ing whether or not I can fit into the various sorts of

things I might be called on to do, I would try to look at
myself and see just exactly what kind of experience I
have. What kind of part-time work have I done? What
have I learned from pumping gas from that gas station?
What did I learn from laboring in the steel mill that
summer? What did I learn from selling cooking utensils
that particular summer? What did I learn from being a
lifeguard at the beach? What did I learn as a 12-year-
old when I had a paper route? What were some of the
things that I learned that will be of value to any em-
ployer? If I have had particular technical experience in
a laboratory or in a drafting room or in an engineering
department, what are the things that I learned there
that may make me very valuable?” So this matter of ex-
perience is a very important thing too.

Then I would ask myself just exactly what kind of
training have I had. “What are the courses that I have
been strong in? What did I learn from those particular
courses that is -going to be applicable to what the em-
ployer is -going to demand of me? What were my weak
subjects? Even in the weak subjects, what did I learn
from those? What were the particular weaknesses -and
what were the reasons for those? Can I remedy them
now? Can my employer expect me to be strong in those
places where I am weak?” I think after a person looks
at himself and asks himself all those questions and puts
down his facts and figures, he will have a pretty good
idea as to just what kind of man this employer has hired.

The next step in my appraisal process would be to
dig in and find out what this employer is like and what
he expects of me. In order to do this I have to find out
who he is. I have to find out exactly what he is doing. I
have to know what kind of company he is running and
even more important I would like to know the kind of
people I am going to be working with. Are they the kind
of people that I feel that I can learn from? Are they the
kind of people in whom I will have confidence? Pre-
sumably, if I have accepted a job, I have answered these
questions already in the affirmative, but I think it is very
important to ask these questions again and put them
down. The second thing I would want to know about the
employer is just exactly what he has in mind for me.
Usually if he has offered you a job he has outlined this
pretty well and if you have accepted the job you have
a pretty good idea. But take it down into its funda-
mentals so that if the employer says that he has a design
job in mind for you, then just exactly what is his prod-
uct and where would I start as a beginner in a design
department or if I am going into production work what
would be expected of me as a beginner being trained to
be production supervisor. What are the characteristics
that such people have and how do they develop on the
job in these fields? Probably the most important question
that you should ask yourself and I think probably the
most important remedy for this “first job jitters” is to
realize this—that when that employer offered you a job
and when he hired you he was expressing to you faith
that you could do what he had in mind for you. There
is no question in his mind but what you can be trained
for the sort of thing that is going to make his company

successful and in making his company successful and
helping it make a profit, you -too will be successful.

Actually, probably the next step is to think again
just exactly what you want out of life, especially what
you want out of this first job. I think these things could
be boiled down into about four specific things. You want
a chance to show what you can do, to demonstrate how
you can apply your training and abilities to the problems
of your employer. You want a chance to grow and I
think that every employer is committed to giving every
employee this chance. You want interesting work, and
probably chose this particular job because you felt that
it offered such an opportunity. The most important thing
of all ,you want challenging people to work with, people
who can stimulate you, who can tr'ain you, who can help
you grow so that you will have the kind of success that
you want.

What the employer expects of you is, first of all,
loyalty. Second, he wants an honest effort on your part
to learn and to be creative and productive and do the
things he would like you to do. Most of all he wants a
really sincere, wholehearted interest in his problems and
in helping to solve them.

If you approach your first job having done all these
things, having assessed yourself in the light of what the
employer wants, understanding what the employer ex-
pects of you, and committing yourself to living up to his
expectations of you, I think that you have nothing to
worry about as far as making a successful career. I think
probably the key to your whole future success will lie in
a quotation from Emerson which many of you may re-
member. Emerson was talking about a person who “for-
gets himself into immortality.” I don’t expect any of you
to “forget yourself into immortality” but I do feel that
those of you who will have the greatest success will be
those who have approached the employer and ap-
proached their new job with the idea that “I am going
to give as much as I can and I am going to forget my-
self.” In giving and in doing everything possible for that
employer you will for-get yourself literally into success on
your first job and you will have eliminated the “first job
jitters”.

RCA REPORTS TO THE NATION:

REMARKABLE NEW PHUTUS UNLOCK

MYSTERIES OF SUN'S SURFACE

Special RCA Television, operating from stratosphere,
helps get sharpest photos of sun's surface ever taken

Scientists recently took the first,
sharp, searching look into the center of
our solar system. It was achieved not
by a missile, but by a balloon posted
in quiet reaches of the stratosphere.

The idea was conceived by astrono-
mers at the Princeton University Ob-
servatory. They decided that a ﬂoating
observatory—equipped with a tele-
scope-camera——would offer a stable
“work platform” from which sunspots
could be photographed free of the distor-
tion caused by the earth’s atmosphere.

But “Project Stratoscope” encoun-
tered an unforeseen and major obstacle
on its initial ﬂight. A foolproof method
was needed for aiming and focusing
the telescope of the unmanned observ-
atory. Princeton asked RCA to help.

A special RCA television system was
devised which enabled observers on the

ground to view exactly what the tele-
scope was seeing aloft. This accom-

plished, it was a simple matter to

achieve precise photography—directed
from the ground by means of a separate
RCA radio control system.

The resulting pictures reveal sun-
spot activities in unprecedented detail.
They provide the world with important
information regarding the magnetic
disturbances which affect navigation
and long-range communications.

The success of "Project Stratoscope”
is another example of RCA leadership
in advanced electronics. This leader-
ship, achieved through quality and
dependability in performance, has al-
ready made RCA Victor the most trusted
name in television. Today, RCA Victor
television sets are in far more homes
than any other make.

HE GETS COMPUTERS TO
DIAGNOSE THEIR OWN FAULTS

With the increasing size and complexity of modern computers, one
of the most interesting problems that engineers face is the rapid
and eﬂicient location of failures within the system.

The method which they have found most practical is to use the
speed and logical abilities of the computer itself to make the
diagnosis. Programming computers to perform this function is the
job of Robert M. King.

The Diagnostic Technique

He prepares programs for the computer which actually simulate
the deductive processes of a man investigating the faults of the
machine. Each program instructs the computer to exercise various
segments of its circuitry in a logical order.

The result of each test is checked against the correct result, stored
in the computer memory, of previous tests of the same circuitry
when in proper working order. If the results do not agree, a mes-
sage is automatically typed which indicates the failure and which
component caused it.

A computer is particularly adept at this job. It can take into con-
sideration sirnultaneously a large number of factors. It can also
work at very high speeds. Once a program is properly written, the
computer makes no errors. Appropriately enough, diagnostic pro-
gramming often aids in designing better computers.

A Programmer’s Background

Computer programs are the result of ingenious applications of
many intellectual qualities. Computer design and language are
based on sound laws of logic. Therefore an important prerequisite
is the ability to analyze complex problems and to deduce from them
useful methods of solution consistent with machine requirements.

If you think you might be interested in working in one of the many

fascinating areas of computer programming, you are invited to
talk it over with an IBM representative. The future can be as un-

limited as the future of the computer itself.

BY NEAL WALKO

Monochiome television is practical only because of
certain characteristics of human vision. Color television,
though it presents a serious technical challenge, is simi-
larly simplified because of limitations of both physiologi-
cal and psychological mechanisms involved in the
perception of color. Principal among these limitations
which permit the simplification of the color problem are
the following. The human eye does not respond to the
spectrum over the visual range of radiation, but rather
synthesizes the sensation of color out of the three pri-
mary colors, red, blue and yellow. Also, detail discrimin-
ation in color is less accurate than for brightness varia-
tions and finally, the time in’ which the eye responds to
changes in color is much less than its time response to
changes in brightness. Probably the most important
limitation is the fact that the eye “sees” all colors as
either red, blue, yellow or else combinations of any two
or all of these primary colors.

In the production of ‘color television, the transmit-
ting camera breaks up all the different colors it “sees”
into the primary colors. These three primary colors are
then retransmitted to the receiver where they are then
recombined to produce the same picture as received by
the stage camera. Color television, then, may almost be
considered as three separate operations.

All the color television systems. that have been seri-
ously considred to date may be divided into two broad
classes; simultaneous systems and sequential systems. In
the simultaneous system, -the three colors are transmitted
and reconstructed at the same time. The three pictures
are superimposed in registry by either electrical or opti-
cal means. As the name implies, in the sequential system,
the three colors are transmitted at separate times and the
superposition is accomplished by the persistance of
vision.

There are three main classes of sequential systems.

36

  

 

These are characterized by the fraction of the picture
(field, line or picture element) which is used as the unit
of division. The color camera is continuously producing
video signals corresponding to the three color compon-
ents of the image. Preamplifiers may be ssociated with
each of -the color channels to raise the signal level above
the switching noise produced by the commutators
wherever necessary. The commutator may be a rotating
color disk in front of the camera, a mechanically oper-
ated switch, or an electron tube commutator. The field
sequential system requires the commutator to have three
switches, one for each color.

If the commutator completes its. cycles in a period
corresponding to that required for three horizontal
sweeps, the system becomes a line sequential system. To
obtain element-sequential color reproduction, the com-
mutator must complete a cycle in the time required for
the beam to -traverse three picture elements. The most
obvious disadvantages to the sequential system are that it
requires moving parts and the picture is not reproduced
simulaneously as in the simultaneous system, but rather
in what might be called frames much like a motion pic-
ture is reproduced. For this reason, the emphasis will be
placed on the simultaneous system.

Here the system is composed of three completely
separate television chains, one for each color. Superpo-
sition of the three pictures may be accomplished opti-
cally or by tricolor kinescope. If full color detail is to be
transmitted, the band width of the r—f spectrum is three
times the width of the monochrome picture. The result
is the s-ame whether three carriers and three channels
or one carrier and one very wide channel is used to carry
the information. By taking advantage of the limited
color resolution of the eye, as was previously noted, an
economy in the band width can be effected. For instance,
the seperate color information of only the lower 0.3 meg-

acycle of -the video signal for each channel might be
transmitted and a mixed hi-gh frequency signal corres-
ponding to a monochrome signal for the remainder of
the video signal from 0.3 to 4.1 megacycles could be
common to the three channels. With such a compromise,
only a 4.7 megacycle band width would be needed to
transmit a picture which had detail equivalent to a
black-and-white 4.1 megacycle band width picture.

In the three color simultaneous system devised and
tested by RCA Laboratories, the camera consisted of
three image orthicon tubes in very close mechanical and
optical register. The optical images focussed on the tar-
gets of the three tubes were obtained from a single ob-
jective with -three dichromic mirrors following it to di-
vide the image into its three color components and to
direct these separation images onto their respc-tive tar-
gets.

Naturally, extreme care had to be taken to insure
linearity of deflection and stability in -the three tubes,
since electrical register of the image is fully as important
as optic-al register. Each camera channel had its own pre-
amplifier and video amplifier into which the necessary
shading and blanking signals were introduced. Various
video and intermediate frequency amplifiers could be
inserted into the three channels to permit a variety of
tests of amplifier characteristic requirements. In this
way, complete separation of the three channels was
maintained through the system up to and including the
viewing tube.

Probably the most important single item in the
problem of color television, almost irrespective of the
system selected, is the means for reproducing the picture
in color. Neither the method of employing a mechanical
rotating color disk in front of a kinescope nor that of
using -three kinescopes with appropriate light filters in
optical registry is very satisfactory or feasible. There-
fore, the development of a single tube capable of re-
producing the three required colors has been of great
importance for the wide acceptance of color television.

Perhaps the simplest idea for a three-color tube is
one where the phosphor screen is in the form of horizon-
tal lines of colored ﬂorescent materials. Each triplet line
corresponds to one line of the raster. The electron beam
is small enough so that it is only on one color at a time.
Magnetic deflection is utilized to produce the scanning
pattern, and auxiliary electronic plates serve to deflect
the beam onto the appropriate color line. This tube has
several inherent weaknesses. First, the deflection ac-
curacy which is required is extreme. Second, a very
small spot due to the fine beam limits the brightness
considerably, and finally, only one color can be pro-
duced at a time. The final weakness does not apply to
tubes utilizing three guns. However, the ideal situation
would be to have a tube that uses only one electron gun.

Another type of deflection color tube has a metalli-
zed coating which is at a slightly negative potential with
respect to the gun and therefore serves as an electron
mirror for the beam. The beam is turned back by the
mirror onto strips which have the three color phosphors
in bands. The color which the beam strides depends

MARCH 1960

upon the exact mirror potential and therefore the tube
can be used as a color selector. Among the disadvantages
to this tube are the high voltage differences in the screen
assembly, the accuracy of adjustment required and the
fact that only one color at a time can be selected.

In an entirely different method of producing color,
a screen made up of layers of different colored phosphors
is used. Here, the penetration of the electron beam gov-
erns the color. Lack of color purity, scanning and color
control interdependence, and the fact that only one color
at a time could be used are all objections to this type of
tube.

In order to have all three colors appearing at the
same time and independently controllable, a whole class
of tubes may be conceived using three separate electron
guns, one for each of the three colors. The type of screen
used in this system is covered with minute pyramids
having their faces at right angles (tube corners). Each
of the faces is coated with a different color phosphor and
a beam approaching from a direction at right angles to
one set of faces, in other words, normal to the surface of
one of the faces, excites only one color. This arrangement

The tricolor kinescope, in 1953, employed three
guns, a shadow mask to insure color purity, and the
colors in the form of a pattern of dots of color phosphors.
The three scanning beams, which formed angles of the
order of one degree with each other, were deflected to-
gether across a thin metal mask perforated in a hexa-

energy dissipation at the mask is excessive. Since the
transmission of the mask becomes less as the convergence
angle between the three electron beams is decreased, it
is generally not advantageous to employ very small con-
vergence angles. The problem of obtaining perfect super-
position of the three partial pictures over large angular
scanning fields is simplified, however, by the use of small
convergence angles.

For this difficulty, a practical remedy may be found
by the focusing action of slits. If an accelerating field is
applied between a linear mask consisting of parallel
wires and a line screen, a parallel electron beam incident
on the mask will be focused into sharp lines on the
screen, provided that the screen potential (measured
relative to cathode potential) is about four -times the
mask potential. The: open area of the mask may be great-
ly increased with this arrangement. It should be noted
that the focusing process implied here is one of “posta'c-
celeration” of beam acceleration after deflection.

Still another -type of tube, though very similar to
on already mentioned, used the screen made up of square
areas of each. phosphor. The disadvantage of such a
screen is that an electron beam must approach the
screen at an angle of 54 degrees from the normal if only
one phosphor is to be energized. If the ratio of major to
minor axis of the diamond shaped areas is about 2.5,
however, the areas require an approach angle of only 25
degrees with the normal. If this ratio were increased, a
still smaller approach an-gle would result, but the screen
would then be-come difficult to build.

The first method applied to this type of tube in
order to obtain color, was to bend the beam to the right
or left directly to produce the desired color. However,
the major drawback here was -that the picture was then
displaced to one side or the other. This predicament is
easily solved by first deflecting the beam to one side and
then the other. In this way, the beam hits the screen in
almost the exact same place that it would have, had it

38

not been deflected at all.

Through the RF and IF portion of the receiver, the
instrument for reproducing color does not differ es-
sentially from a conventional monochrome receiver. Of
course care must be taken that the full width of the video
channel is maintained. In addition there must be no seri-
ous discontinuities in the phase or amplitude response of
the channel. This is obviously so because the important
color information is located at the high—frequency end of
the channel, whereas the major part of the brightness,
or luminous signal is in the low-frequency region.

The desampler which follows the second detector
is unique to the color receiver. This main controlling
subcarrier oscillator is brought into synchronism and
phase by a special wavetrain or burst, which follows the
standard synchronizing pulse. This ‘oscillator drives the
three demodulators. The outputs. of the desampler are
filtered by specially designed but more or less conven-
tional filters. They are next amplified by linear video
amplifiers and are fed to the three appropriate cothodes
if a three-cathode, tri-color kinescope is used. The by-
passed brightness signal after passage through a filter, is
amplified and -applied to the grids of the three guns
simultaneously.

Separate gun bias controls are provided to regulate
the color background. Furthermore, separate gain con-
trols for -the three color amplifiers control color balance.
The deflection -generators and power supplies follow
more or less conventional design.

No mention has been made as to whether this sys-
tem of producing color television is better than another
system. They all have their inherent advantages and
disadvantages. This is a major reason why color is not
yet as popular or as practical as monochrome -television.
However, it is quite apparent that color television does
have its mounting problems. Contrary to popular belief,
it is not true that all one needs to produce color television
is monochrome television using colored elctrons..

COLOR TELEVISION PROGRAMS
are “stored" by the video tape recorder
in much the same way as sound is
recorded on magnetic tape.

MARCH 1960

   

In ancient China they “piped” water through hollow bamboo
sections, but they couldn’t shut it off. One day a workman
with an engineering mind bored a hole in a plug and ﬁtted
it into holes in the pipe. This was the ﬁrst plug valve.

Centuries later, the brilliant young mathematician and
scientist, Blaise Pascal, worked out the principle of hydraulics
for which he is famous: “A unit pressure applied to a liquid
contained in a sealed vessel is transmitted to every part of the
liquid with undiminished force.”

In 1914, Sven Nordstrom, a young mining engineer, had
trouble with sticking, leaking valves on the acid lines at a
silver mine. By combining the plug cock idea of the ancient
Chinese with Pascal’s principle of hydraulics, he created a
new idea in ﬂow control: the lubricated plug valve.

Today, the Rockwell-Nordstrom lubricated plug valve is
widely used in the petroleum and natural gas industries, in
chemical processing, and in general manufacturing. Its eﬂi-
ciency helps cut the cost of many of the things you use every
day. And thanks to hundreds of engineering advances, the
original lubricated plug valve is still the most modern.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like
to work for, buy from, and invest in.

ATOMIC REACTORS TO POWER CRUISER

Well on the way to completion at the Quincy, Mass., yards
at Bethlehem Shipbuilding Division of Bethlehem Steel
Company, is the cruiser Long Beach, the first nuclear
powered U. S. Navy surface vessel. The power for the ship
will be supplied by tw.o nuclear reactors. Westinghouse
Electric Corporation designed and developed the reactors
under the direction of the Atomic Energy Commission at
the. AEC’s Bettis plant in Pittsburgh which is operated by
Westinghouse. The cruiser, designed and being built by
Bethlehem, is about 721 feet long, has a beam approximately
73 feet and displaces about 14,000 tons.

INSTANT CONCRETE PIPE

Construction machinery that builds “instant concrete pipe”
in a freshly-cut ditch at a rate of eight to twelve feet a
minute has been developed by Fullerform Continuous Pipe
Corporation. Currently being used to build conduits for
irrigation water on farms near Phoenix, Ariz., the new
construction process is being adapted to build storm sewers
and other types of concrete pipe. Using two _300-foot in-
flated forms, designed by Goodyear Aircraft Corporation,
with only three pounds per square inch of air pressure,
the machinery can pour as much as 600 feet of concrete
pipe at a time without interruption. Ready mix concrete
trucks are used in a continuous stream to service the pour-
ing equipment.

SUCCESSFUL highway engineers

There's a real need for qualified men in America's
100 billion dollar highway program. lt’s a big job.
For example, for the new Interstate Highway Sys-
tem alone, 35,000 miles are still to be built.

Choice assignments await engineers at every level.
They will go to the men who prepare for them.

As part of that preparation, you must have basic
material on Asphalt Technology. For if you don't
know Asphalt, you don't know your highways.
Asphalt is the modern paving for today's and
tomorrow's roads. Asphalt surfaces more than
4/ 5ths of all roads and streets in the country.

We have put together a special student portfolio
to meet that need for information on Asphalt. It
covers the Asphalt story, origin, uses, how it is

How to look out a Window before the building is up

 

to sell, the developers
of The Comstock
turned to photography

to get a jump on sales

A feature of The Comstock, San
F rancisco’s new co-operative apart-
ments on top of Nob Hill, will be
the spectacular panoramic views
of the Bay area from their picture
windows.

How could these views be spread
before prospective buyers——before
the building was up? The devel-
opers, Albert-Lovett C0,, found the
answer in photography. From a
gondola suspended from a crane,
color photos were made from the
positions of the future apartments.
Now, the sales representative not

only points out the location ofa
possible apartment on a scale
model, but shows you the view
from your window as well.

Photography rates high as a
master salesman. It rates high in
other business and industry tasks,
too. The research laboratory, the
production line, the quality control
department and the office all get
work done better and faster with
"photography on the job.

Whatever your ﬁeld, you will
ﬁnd photography can save you
time and cut costs, too.

Q. Why does your company have train-

ing programs, Mr. Abbott?

A. Tomorrow’s many positions of major
responsibility will necessarily be ﬁlled by
young men who have developed their
potentials early in their careers. General
Electric training programs simply help
speed up this development process.

In addition, training programs provide
graduates with the blocks of broad ex-
perience on which later success in a
specialization can be built.

Furthermore, career opportunities and
interests are brought into sharp focus
after intensive working exposures to
several ﬁelds. General Electric then gains
the valuable contributions of men who
have made early, well-considered deci-
sions on career goals and who are con-
ﬁdently working toward those objectives.

Q. What kinds of technical training pro-
grams does your company conduct?

A. General Electric conducts a number
of training programs. The G-E programs
which attract the great majority of
engineering graduates are Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and Tech-
nical Marketing.

Q. How long does the Engineering and
Science Program last?

A. That depends on which of several
avenues you decide to take. Many gradu-
ates complete the training program dur-
ing their ﬁrst year with General Electric.
Each Program member has three or four
responsible work assignments at one or
more of 61 different plant locations.
Some graduates elect to take the Ad-
vanced Engineering Program, supple-
menting their work assignments with
challenging Company-conducted study
courses which cover the application of
engineering, science, and mathematics to
industrial problems. If the Program mem-
ber has an analytical bent coupled with a
deep interest in mathematics and physics,
he may continue through a second and

third year of the Advanced Engineering
Program.

Then there is the two-year Creative
Engineering Program for those graduates
who have completed their ﬁrst-year
assignments and who are interested in
learning creative techniques for solving
engineering problems.

Another avenue of training for the
qualiﬁed graduate is the Honors Program,
which enables a man to earn his Master’s
degree within three or four semesters at
selected colleges and universities. The
Company pays for his tuition and books,
and his work schedule allows him to earn
75 percent of full salary while he is going
to school. This program is similar to a
research assistantship at a college or
university.

Q. Just how will the Manufacturing
Training Program help prepare me for
a career in manufacturing?

A. The three-year Manufacturing
Program consists of three orientation
assignments and three development
assignments in the areas of manufacturing
engineering, quality control, materials
management, plant engineering, and
manufacturing operations. These assign-
ments provide you with broad, funda-
mental manufacturing knowledge and
with specialized knowledge in your
particular ﬁeld of interest.

The practical, on-the-job experience
offered by this rotational program is sup-
plemented by participation in a manu-
facturing studies curriculum covering
all phases of manufacturing.

Q. What kind of training would I get
on your Technical Marketing Program?

A. The one-year Technical Marketing
Program is conducted for those graduates
who want to use their engineering knowl-

edge in dealing with customers. After
completing orientation assignments in
engineering, manufacturing, and market-
ing, the Program member may specialize
in one of the four marketing areas: appli-
cation engineering, headquarters market-
ing, sales engineering, or installation and
service engineering.

In addition to on-the-job assignments,
related courses of study help the Program
member prepare for early assumption of
major responsibility.

Q. How can I decide which training
program I would like best, Mr. Abbott?

A. Well, selecting a training program is
a decision which you alone can make. You
made a similar decision when you selected
your college major, and now you are
focusing your interests only a little more
sharply. The beauty of training programs
is that they enable you to keep your
career selection relatively broad until you
have examined at ﬁrst hand a number of
specializations.

Furthermore, transfers from one Gen-
eral Electric training program to another
are possible for the Program member
whose interests clearly develop in one
of the other ﬁelds.

Personalized Career Planning
is General Electric’s term for the
selection, placement, and pro-
fessional development of engi-
neers and scientists. If you would
like a Personalized Career Plan-
ning folder which describes in
more detail the Company’s train-
ing programs for technical gradu-
ates, write to Mr. Abbott at Sec-
tion 959-13, General Electric

An Editorial

Have We Been Forgotten?

The Engineering students may well ask themselves,
have we been forgotten? What benefits are we deriving
from the renaissance of Pitt?

Since the announcement of the “New Pitt,” students
have heard of the dramatic changes which the Uni-
versity is undergoing. The campus is expanding. New
property and building are being continuously bought.
Hardly a month passes without the appointment of a
new administrator. But what does all this mean to us
the engineering students?

We have the same lab equipment, classrooms, in-
structors, and generally the same buildings. This is not
the case in other schools of the University. New medical
buildings, natural science buildings and parking garages,
to name a few, are being constructed throughout the
campus. Yes, we may well ask if we have been forgotten.

On the other hand, plans have been made to raise
funds for new equipment and facilities by the adminis-
tration of the Schools of Engineering, and the Alumni
Association.

In our struggle for better facilities and equipment we
have two allies, Mr. Gwilym A. Price, chairman of the
Board of Trustees, and Dr. G. R. Fitterer, Dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines. These two gentle-
men, by no means, have an easy task. The University
has placed its closest attention on the School of Liberal
Arts and the Medical School. The allocation of funds
into the engineering school is highly improbable. The
only alternative would be the initiation of a fund-raising
campaign solely for the engineering school.

This is exactly what has been done. Dr. E. R. Weid-
lein is the head of the alumni committee which is con-

ducting a $1,600,000 fund raising campaign. This
committee, working closely with Mr. Price and Dean
F itterer, is now in the process of approaching the
Alumni for contributions.

The remodeling of Pennsylvania Hall and the Mineral
Industries Building coupled with minor renovations in
the four other engineering buildings will cost approxi-
mately $600,000. The remaining $1,000,000 will be used
for much needed new laboratory equipment for every
department in the school.

Many new improvements have been planned. The
Chemical department plans to build three new research
labs, a Unit Operatio-ns L-ab, and a Process Lab. Civil
Engineers will get a Sanitary Engineering Lab and a
Materials Lab. A Servomechanism Lab, Electronics
Lab, and a Measurements Lab will be constructed for
the Electrical Engineers. The Mechanicals are to get a
Heat Power Lab, an Aeronautics Lab, and a Mechanical
Measurements Lab. Plans call for an Electric Melting
Furnace, an X-ray machine, and a Radiograph Lab for
the Metallurgical Engineers. These are only a few of the
planned improvements.

This is a good start, but will it also be an ending?
There are other needs that the en-gineering schools
should hope to satisfy. An increase in faculty salary
would be a blessing. A salary increase would enable us
to keep the good, well qualified instructors we now have
and also attract the top men from other universities and
industry.

Yes, there are many needs in the engineering school
that may go unsatisfied for a while, but it is good to
know that we haven’t been completely forgotten.‘

a message from the dean

Graduate School?

G. R. Fitterer

Proportionally fewer engineers enter graduate school
than any other group of scientists. This is true not only
here. at Pitt but in every engineering college in the
United States. This is very unfortunate because there
is such a great need for talented en=gineers with ad-
vanced training. In later life so many really talented
engineers find themselves in secondary positions to
others with advanced degrees.

This is not true in all fields of engineering. For ex-
ample, top executives in the construction field seldom
have advanced degrees. Engineers in production or tech-
nological management can do very well with the B.S.
degree.

However, much of technology today depends so much

MARCH 1960

on the advanced engineering sciences that the one
degree is not sufficient to promote one to leadership in-
these fields. Interplanetary space travel, nuclear power,
the development and use of computers, and many others
are developments of engineering and not “pure” science.
This is one of the difficult lessons which Americans
still must learn in order to lead the world in these
fields. But there are not sufficient engineers with the
advanced training today to furnish this much-needed
leadership. All engineers who want to enter research
or teaching should do everything in their power to
obtain advanced degrees. These will pay great dividends
in later life both financially and from the satisfaction
of accomplishment.

A survey of all engineering colleges in the United
States indicates that on the average there is less than
one Ph.D. granted per engineering department each
year in the United States. This is true even in those
divisions such as the Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical
and Metallurgical enginering which traditionally grad-
uate most of the Ph.D’s.

The attention of every engineering student should be
called to the fact that if he graduates with a “B”
average in his baccalaureate degree that he would
probably be accepted in any graduate school in the
United States. Some colleges will accept engineers for
graduate training with less than a “B” average.

Never in the history of education have there been
so many opportunities for engineers to receive financial
support in graduate work. These are generally in the
form of part-time teaching assistantships with free
tuition, research fellowships, or even outright grants
from such agencies as the National Science Foundation.
This agency has on occasion granted as much as $10,-
000 per year’ for students who have already -accumu-
lated graduate credit and who can finish their docto-
rate in one year.

The Ford Foundation is now granting awards which
consist of $3,000 per year, plus tuition, plus a loan up
to $3,000 per year to graduate students who agree to
teach upon receipt of their advanced degree. The loan
is then cancelled at the rate of $600 per year for each
year that he teaches. Such opportunities should be
seriously considered by every student who has even the
slightest thought of going into advanced work. There
is no time like the present! The longer graduate work
is postponed, the more difficult it becomes.‘

Westinghouse is the best place fin talened e

F. Kelly, W. J. Miller, and J. P. Tobin of the Westinghouse Atomic Power Department lift the “core plate”
off the nuclear core for the first U.S.-built power reactor designed for use abroad (Mol, Belgium).

Waltz Mill Experimental Reactor helps
Westinghouse engineers solve problems

The new Westinghouse Testing Reactor at Waltz Mill,
Pa., provides engineers with complete facilities for an-
alyzing the effect of nuclear radiation on various mate-
rials, processes and designs. If a Westinghouse engineer
is working on development of atomic fuels or the design
of reactor components for an atomic power plant, he
can count on help from the men at Waltz Mill.

The Westinghouse Testing Reactor is one of only two
such privately owned reactors in the country. It pro-
vides a high radiation ﬁeld comparable to that of a
working reactor, and in addition has special controlled
environment loops for the study of radiation effects at
high temperatures and pressures. Work presently being
carried out here for other departments of the company
includes studies of thermionics, crystal structure, and
thermoelectric effects as well as the work on atomic
reactor designs and fuels.

The young engineer at Westinghouse isn’t expected
to know all the answers . . . our work is often too ad-
vanced for that. Instead, his abilities and knowledge are
backed up by specialists like those at Waltz Mill.

If you have ambition and ability, you can have a
rewarding career with Westinghouse. Our broad product
line, decentralized operations, and diversiﬁed technical
assistance provide hundreds of challenging opportuni-
ties for talented engineers.
