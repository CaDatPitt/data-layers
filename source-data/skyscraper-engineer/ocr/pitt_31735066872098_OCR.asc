      *SOLUTION
 The voltage across the 3 uf capacitor is
 47 volts. This answer may be verified as
 follows:
   Since the voltage across the 91 ohm re-
 sistor is 91 volts in the steady state, then
    Ei + Ej= 100 or El - 100-E3  (1)
* and E2+Eai =91 or E2 = 91 -E:   (2)
: let QI= IiTI= CIEI
let Q2 = 12T2= C2E2
* then Q3 = IITil1T2 or CHE3 =     (3)
               Ci1E+C2E2
 By substituting in equation (3) the expres-
 sions for E1 and E2 given in equations (1)
 and (2), we have:
    C3E3 = C1 (100 -E3)+C (91 -E3)
 Substituting all known values in this
 equation gives:

EDUCATIONAL GOALS



       FOR ENGINEERS


W. R. Turkes
Acting Dean


   Most students at the time of admission to an
engineering school establish as their academic goal the
earning of a Bachelor of Science degree. Very few be-
gin their engineering studies with the intention of
completing the requirements for a Master of Science
degree or a Doctor's degree before accepting full-time
employment. Until recently, this had been the long-
accepted practice for students in most branches of
engineering.
    In the early 1900's employers who needed men
with advanced training in engineering and science fre-
quently conducted "in-plant" educational programs.
For these courses, students were selected from   the
ranks of young engineers who showed and demonstrat-
ed promise in the fields of design, development, and
research. The courses were taught by the senior en-
gineers and scientists of the company in after regular
employment hour educational programs. These pro-
grams were in no way associated with engineering col-
leges and the courses did not carry college credit
'and were not applicable to an advanced degree.
    About 1920 the need for advanced training for
engineers was recognized by colleges and universities.
Since then the patterns of formal graduate study in en-
gineering have been developing and, recently, have had
rapid growth and expansion. From      the early "in-
plant" non-credit programs, a natural development
was part-time university graduate study programs in
metropolitan areas where industries provided a ready-
made student body. These graduate courses were
frequently given in cooperation with area industries
which made possible the employment of the engineer
and science specialists as adjunct instructors for the
advanced courses in the new graduate programs. Con-
centrations of students in a given industry or geo-
graphical area indicated the desirability of establish-
ing off-campus courses which were available to all
qualified students irrespective of place or type of em-
ployment.
    At the University of Pittsburgh in the Schools of


Engineering and Mines, a Graduate Work in Indus-
try Program was established in 1927, and is an early
and excellent example of the growth and development
of a college-industry cooperative graduate program.
     Following World War II, the demands for part-
 time graduate programs were stimulated by a great
 number of highly qualified students with educational
 benefits from military service. The large growth of
 sponsored research on university campuses 'has result-
 ed in a part-time graduate opportunity for many
 students who 'are employed in university sponsored
 research programs. Graduate programs of this char-
 acter are usually conducted after regular employment
 hours although -there is an ever-increasing trend to
 provide the student with release time during the nor-
 mal working 'day. Other plans provide for an inter-
 ruption of regular employment or a cooperative ar-
 rangement 'with a leave-of-absence for graduate study.
 Some form of partial or complete payment of tuition
 and release time for graduate study for engineers is
 frequently provided as a- fringe benefit by employers.
     Not to be overlooked in the patterns of graduate
study is the full-time resident student whose employ-
ment, if any, is incidental.
     These and other plans of graduate study are pro-
viding a greater number of trained engineers to help
fill today's ever-increasing demand from industry, gov-
ernment, and educational institutions for engineers
with advanced knowledge in many fields, especially in
the physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics.
     This. need for educated manpower in scientific
fields continues to increase because of the pressure of
our national defense and security needs in addition to
the ever-increasing requirements of industry in our
highly competitive technological society.
    If we are to meet the demands for engineers with
advanced training, all present and prospective engi-
neering students who qualify academically, should seri-
ously consider an advanced degree as their academic
goal. Only in this way can the needs be fulfilled. N

THE INDUSTRY


THAT LOOKED BACK



                                                 BY RUSSELL C. MAXWELL, JR., ChemE '59


    Today the steel industry is reverting back to the
primitive methods of iron production. In its original
production, batches of ore and charcoal were mixed
together in an open pit. This direct method of reduc-
tion, as well as the present day direct reduction meth-
ods, produced not a solid metal, but rather a powdered
iron known as sponge. Some remnants of this original
method still remain in Sweden, Mexico, and. Japan.
    Research departments of quite a few of our large
firms have now been studying the possibilities of vari-
ous forms of direct reduction of iron ore to pig iron.
A number of unsuccessful attempts have been made
over the years, but direct reduction seems to be finally
ready for commercial use.
    As the need for iron and steel and their products
increased and became more diversified, improvements
were made on the methods and equipment of produc-
tion of iron. The blast furnace was developed, and
"bee-hive" coke ovens supplied the necessary coke for
the reduction process. Complex coking plants then
replaced the "bee-hive" ovens. Blast furnace techno-
logy studied and solved many of the problems of
quality and composition control as well as burden and
efficiency problems that occured. Thus, over the years
the production of iron became the large 'and complex
industry that it is today.
     Many factors determine the location of coking
plants and blast furnaces. A coking plant must be
located in the vicinity of a good supply of coking coal.
There must also be a sufficient supply of power within
the economic means of the establishing firm. Adequate
transportation facilities for the receiving of raw ma-
terials and for shipping the products should be avail-
able. Blast furnace location is partially determined
by the relative availability of the iron ore as well as
the coke.
     These limiting factors, along with many others,
are presenting a problem today in the steel industry's
plans for expansion. There are very few   locations
available where both ore and coking coal are conven-
iently located. The industry has already concentrated
its facilities in the locations which fulfill the present
day requirements. But the development of new pro-
cesses such as direct reduction might lead to expan-


sion in the Southwest and West Coast of our country.
    As a result, steel producers are anxious to replace
the blast furnace 'with a process which is more economi-
cal 'and more flexible. Whatever process that would be
developed would replace or supplement the blast fur-
nace and could easily turn out to be a method of di-
rect reduction.
    Fluidized reduction is the direct reduction process
with the greatest chance of success. The solutions,to
many of the steel industries major problems are the
particular points which are advantages of this process.
    It has been found that a gas can be bubbled
through a fine powder which causes a suspension of
the fine particles of the powder' in the gas. This is true
if the amount of powder and the gas flow rate is con-
trolled. The resulting mixture can be treated in the
same way as a liquid. Like a liquid, its shape is depend-
ent 'on the size and shape of its container. It also flows
like a liquid. This makes the suspended mixture easy
to transport.
    Because the particle is suspended in the gas, a
greater surface area is available for contact with the
reducing agent, which in -this case is the gas suspend-
ing the particles. This will result in a larger rate of

production of the reduced product.
     These -advantages make fluidized reduction adapt-
able to the steel industry and its production of iron.
At the present time, steel companies are investigating
the possibilities of a commercial fluidized reduction
plant.
     These investigations were made possible by both
the development of the process of fluidization and the
perfection of methods of producing low-cost gases that
may be used for the reduction of iron ores. During the
past fifteen years the synthetic ammonia and synthetic
methanol industries' needs for reducing gases resulted
in three low-cost methods of producing the necessary
reducing gases.
     The first process was put into use during the war
to reform natural gas. In this process, methane is re-
acted with water to form carbon monoxide and hydro-
gen.
     In 1951, Hydrocarbon Research, Inc. and Texaco
Development Co. offered the Partial Oxidation pro-
cess for licensing. In this process natural gas, fuel oil,
or -any gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon fuel is burned
with oxygen in a fuel-rich mixture, thus producing
carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This reaction is -car-
ried out under pressure so that reducing gases will be
produced at a pressure 'with minimum costs for gas
compression.
     An atmospheric-pressure powdered-coal gasifier,
 which has been developed by Babcock and Wilcox,
 began operation for duPont in 1955. This gasifier pro-
 duces 25,000,000 standard cubic feet of reducing gas
 per day. Olin-Matheson has operated a powdered-coal
 gasifier at elevated pressure, using a design developed
 by Texaco Development Co. A commercial installation
 of this type would use several parallel units of this
 gasifier which has a rating of 6,000,000 standard cubic
 feet per day.
     The    cost of these    reducing  gases   as  pro-
 duced by these newly developed processes is consit-
 erably lower than the cost of blast-furnace grade coke.
 This is one 'of the largest incentive factors for the
 adoption of direct reduction. The great push in re-
 search on the lines of direct reduction has come about
 since the development of these low-cost methods of pro-
 ducing reducing gases.
      As a result of these developments, a number of
 major research projects are being conducted with the
 hopes of making direct reduction feasible as a commer-
 cial method of producing iron. In the fluidized phase
 of direct reduction, there are three major development-
 al projects being conducted. The United States Steel
 Corporation has a pilot plant at its South Works in
 Chicago, Illinois.
     The process being developed by Bethlehem Steel
 and Hydrocarbon Research, Inc. has reached a high
 stage of development, and may become a commercial
 reality in the near future. It is the most advanced and
 versatile of the recent direct reduction processes.
     Known as the H-Iron process, it produces a pro-
 duct known as H-Iron. This process reduces iron ore


Pig iron is manufactured in this modern U. S. Steel blast
furnace. The arrows on the photo that point to various
parts of the furnace indicate its complexity.

in a fluidized bed producing a reduced iron powder.
The reaction is carried out at 900 degrees 'Fahrenheit
and a pressure of 400 psig. The fluidized bed is quiet
with no heaving or bumping and no excessive vibration
of the vessel. The charging and dumping are carried
out without depressuring the reducing unit or inter-
rupting the circulating flow of hydrogen.
     The process begins by drying powdered iron-ore
 (-20 mesh to -325 mesh) and preheating it to around
 900 degrees Fahrenheit. When the temperature is too
 high, the reduced iron powder becomes "tacky", loses
 its mobility, and jams the process lines. After pre-
 heating, the hot, dry ore is transported pneumatically
 to a bin located above the charge hopper. The charge
 hopper is filled with a batch of ore at atmospheric
 pressure and then pressured with hydrogen to a pres-
 sure about 100 psi higher than the reducer. The batch
 of ore is then transferred to the reducer by opening
 the valve between the two vessels. The higher pressure
 in the charge hopper forces the ore into. the reducer.
   The powdered iron ore flows through the line much
 like water flows. This type of flow is known by chem-
 ical engineers as "dense-phase transport." Solid line
 velocities are low, thus reducing pipe erosion and in-
 creasing the line capacity.
     Since the hydrogen supplying process isn't easily
adjusted to produce variations in the hydrogen produc-
tion rate over short periods of time, a problem is
created. This 'was solved by carrying out several reduc-
tion batches simultaneously in two beds, one above the
other. The rate of water production is thereby made
reasonably steady, and there is no excessive loss of


JANUARY 1958




hydrogen due to venting.
     In the reducer, hydrogen .reacts with iron oxide
to form iron and water. The water is produced in vapor'
phase and metallic iron and impurities are left. Ap-
proximately 95%  reduction is obtained after 4 to 7
hours depending on the type of ore.
    Dry hydrogen is introduced at the bottom of the
reducer and caused to flow up through the bed of
powdered ore. The hydrogen velocity is adjusted to a
rate well beyond that at which the powdered ore is
buoyed up by the rising gas stream. Much of the ris-
ing gas stream passes through the bed in bubbles, thus
producing agitation at the surface.
     If this growth of bubbles goes unchecked, the
overflow 'of powdered ore caused by the bubbles break-
ing at the surface will be excessive, and there -will be a
loss of efficiency of gas-to-solid contact. Hydrocarbon
Research, Inc. has developed devices to calm  the
fluidized bed. Without these devices, the process would
be economically unfeasible -and a large scale operation
would be impossible.
     After a batch has gone through the last reduction
bed, it is transferred by "dense-phase transport" to a
dump hopper. The resultant iron powder is of little
value in the open-hearth or electric furnace. The hot
iron powder is rolled into a dense plate and then
broken into chips. Sometimes these chips are oiled to
prevent rusting.
     Before being fed to the reducer, dry hydrogen is
heated in a furnace to about 1000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Wet hydrogen leaves the reducer at 900 degrees, the
temperature drop supplying heat losses 'and endother-
mic heat of the reduction reaction. Heat exchange with
dry hydrogen and cooling by direct contact in a gas
cooling tower cools the hydrogen to 100 degrees and
condenses almost all water from the hydrogen stream.
A venturi scrubber removes iron-ore fines. A small
stream of hydrogen is vented to control the concentra-
tion of inerts in the circulating hydrogen stream, fresh
hydrogen added, and a recycle compressor boosts the
stream to overcome pressure losses. The H-Iron plant
is a continuous water producer while charging and
tapping is intermittent. The number of batches of ore
processed simultaneously is determined by the type of
ore and the desired degree of reduction.
     Another process is being developed by Arthur D.
Little, Inc. in cooperation with Esso Research and
Engineering Co. The process was devised by Warren
K. Lewis of M. I. T. for Esso and is based upon con-
tinuous reduction by natural gas. A pilot plant is at
work in Cambridge, Mass.
     In this process, less than 8 mesh powdered iron
ore is fed to the upper bunk of a two bed reactor along
with a mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
hydrogen, and water. This partially reduces the ore.
The fluidized mass in the upper bed spills into an over-
flow pipe and drops to the bottom of the lower bed.
The heat impact to this bed is maintained by burning
some of the methane with air, thus producing enough
heat to crack much: of the remaining methane. Metal-


lic iron serves as a catalyst. The cracked gases react
with FeO from the top bed to produce metallic iron.
Iron powder (5 to 30%   FeO) leaves the reactor at the
top of the lower bed.
     Professor Lewis found that sticking could be pre-
vented by controlling material ratios and   keeping
temperature below 1740 degrees Fahrenheit. This pro-
cess does not recirculate the reducing gas as other pro-
cesses do. The fast reduction rates at 1550-1650 de-
grees Fahrenheit produce a mixture of iron and iron
oxides which, although not pure sponge, is excellent
feed for electric furnaces and the open hearth.
     The third process is being developed by Earl
Shipley for United States Steel Corporation. Very lit-
tle information -about this process has been released.
In this process the ore is preheated to 700 degrees Fah-
renheit by off-gas from the reactor. The ore is then
heated to 1,600 to 1,800 degrees by ascending gas
currents and burning fuel.
     The reducing gases, essentially hydrogen and car-
bon monoxide, are heated to 1,600-1,700 degrees and
enter the reducers. After the fluidized reduction action
of the gases, some of the gas is withdrawn to prevent
nitrogen buildup. They preheat the ore and eventually
are cooled to 150 degrees when the carbon dioxide is
absorbed by ME,A, monoethanolamine.
     These methods of direct reduction have both ad-
vantages over and limitations to the present-day blast
furnaces. Since these processes remove nothing but
oxygen, ores must be checked for silicon, phosphorous,
and manganese because they remain in the residue.
The product must also be free of carbon and sulfur
which the blast furnace introduces. The blast furnace
has chemical reactions which are of an unknown com-
plexity, and the thermodynamics leave much to be
desired. 'Because the product of fluidized reduction can
be drawn without interrupting the reaction, the ton-
nage will begin to compare with the blast furnace.
These processes also eliminate the elaborate process of
charging the blast furnace with successive layers of
limestone, coke, arid ore.
     The produced sponge iron could turn out to be a
low-cost supply of what is known as "iron units." It
would reduce the dependence on purchased scrap and
could act as a supplement, guarding against scrap
shortage or a possible runaway in scrap prices.
     Economically, the blast furnace is inferior to the
direct reduction   plant. Instead of the $50,000,000
cost of a blast furnace, a direct reduction plant would
cost half as much. This is just a comparison of initial
costs. Operating costs would also be cut. No high
price steel scrap would be necessary. There would be
no   costly maintenance shutdowns. Material costs
would be lowered. Because of reduced furnace charg-
ing time, there would be a cut in fuel expenditures.
     The direct reduction processes have great possi-
bilities. They probably will not replace the blast fur-
nace, but rather supplement it for there are many
uses for the blast furnace. But look for fluidized reduc-
tion to come into commercial use in the near future. a

Did you ever hear


          atoms move?


The physicist positions a single crystal of age-hardened
   steel under the sharp diamond penetrator. He touches
a pedal, and the pyramidal tip of the diamond squeezes into
the polished surface of the steel.
The instant that it touches, things begin to happen inside the
crystal. Atoms begin to slip and slide, in layers. Some layers
abruptly wrinkle and corrugate. If you listen hard when this
happens, you hear a faint, sharp, "click." This is the sound
of atoms suddenly shifting within the crystal.
You can see the action, too-or, rather, the results of it.
The photomicrograph above shows the characteristic ridges
and ripples. The black diamond in the center is the depres-
sion made by the penetrator.
By studying these patterns, and correlating the information
with other data, scientists at U. S. Steel are trying to learn
what happens atomically when a steel is bent, flexed or
broken. Thus, they try to develop new and better steels for an
exacting and ever-growing steel market.
Research is only one area in which we need high-level scien-
tific personnel. Partly, this is due to the fact that men progress
so rapidly at United States Steel. Remember these figures:

the site and contributed $5,000,000 toward the cost
of the nuclear portion of the plant.
     The   plant is capable    of producing     a  mini-
mum -of 60,000 kilowatts of electricity. The generator
for the station, however, possesses a capacity of 100,-
000 kilowatts. The electricity produced is being fed
the Duquesne system     for distribution to the greater
Pittsburgh area.
     The nuclear portion of the station is of the pres-
surized water type which has inherent stability. Heat
generated   by   the  reactor is transferred  from     it
to a heat exchanger by pumping ordinary water
through the reactor under 2,000 pounds at 525 de-
grees F. This in turn produces steam at 600 pounds
per square inch. Enriched and natural uranium       is
be used as the fuel in the reactor. The core of the
reactor, with  32    control rods, is in the general
shape of a cylinder 6/2 by 6 feet.
     The   heat producing     unit, the    core, is in-
side the reactor pressure vessel installed in -the reactor
container. The reactor pressure vessel is 33 feet tall
with an inside diameter of nine feet and walls about
eight inches thick. This entire vessel weighs 250 tons.
     For safety precautions, the various nuclear por-
 tions are surrounded by plant containers, which in
 turn are surrounded by five-foot-thick walls 'of con-
 crete.
     Special materials were required throughout the
 construction of the plant: zirconium alloys for reactor
 construction; hafnium   for control rods; uranium  for
 fuel; stainless steel for piping, pumps, valves, and other
 equipment; extremely pure 'water for use in 'the reactor
 or primary loop; and specially-reinforced concrete for
 construction.
     As might be expected, many special facilities were
 required for the plant. Remotely controlled equipmen.t
 is used to handle radioactive materials. Among other
 things, the core handling facilities (for use in replac-
 ing the core) consist of a water-filled canal 43 feet
 deep, 22 feet wide, and. 110 feet long, a large building
 covering the canal, and a 125-ton crane.

actor is steam, which in turn is used to turn a turbine,
and, in turn, an electric generator. The design of the
turbine-generator portion of the plant differs from
that of a standard coal-fired plant. The changes are
due primarily from the fact that the available steam
pressures and temperatures for turning the turbine are
comparatively low. The physical size of the turbine,
however, is larger to accomodate an increased steam
volume. This necessitates moisture separators because
a high percentage of the available steam  condenses
into water as the steam passes through -the turbine.
The steam condenser had to be designed, therefore,
to handle more exhaust steam. The turbine-generator
is unusual in that it operates in the open without
walls or roof. This is the first installation of this
type in the eastern part of the United States.
     This extremely complicated plant employs about
130 people in the various departments. About 26 per-
sons are engineers, chemists, and others whose job in-
volves testing the complex equipment. Thus about 100
persons are associated with operations and maintenance
'of the plant. After the initial tests are completed, the
number of personnel 'may be reduced to about 80. A
corresponding conventional plant employs about 65
people.
     The Shippingport power plant promises to an-
swer many questions about the practicality of operating
a nuclear power plant. Now that engineers are being
given the opportunity to study the plant in action, we
should know a great deal more about the future of
atomic polwer. E

SECRETARY .WITH A SLIDE RULE


A new program is producing secr

specifically for the engineer.




BY CAROLYN J. STASENKO, College '58


    In the world of engineering, development and
 progress are by words. Now, because of a program ini-
 tiated in Pittsburgh, these words are taking on new
 importance. The program began with an idea-an idea
 to free the engineer from the heavy load of office
 routine so he could channel more of his time and
 energy into jobs requiring his professional skill. The
 result was a program, an Engineering Secretarial
 Course begun at the Business Training College, which
 appears to hold the solution to a problem of office te-
 dium that has plagued engineers -for years.
     This program offers the engineer a secretary-as-
 sistant, intensively trained in a two-year course which
 includes the ;highly technical terminology of the en-
 gineering profession, laboratory work in chemistry
 and physics, and of course, all the usual basic secre-
 tarial requirements. To the engineer this means less
 time going back over letters and reports to correct
 mistakes. It means additional time for his professional
 work.
     The idea behind the program began years ago.

 ing of secretarial specialists in the legal and medical

professions, had long recognized the fact that engin-
eers, too, needed secretaries trained not only in office
procedure but in the processes of general engineering
as well. With this in mind, the Engineeering Secretar-
ial Course was begun in 1955.
    A   small beginning  class of three seniors was
graduated last June. Next June, twenty-two seniors
will complete the course. Because of the great need
for engineering assistants, school officials are seeking
to accept as many young men and women as possible;
applicants, however, are carefully screened. Students
are selected on the basis of an aptitude test plus a
personal interview. College heads realize the impor-
tance of selecting students who have an interest in

the field and who have the ability, aptitudes, and in-
tellectual curiosity necessary for such training.
     Before this program   began, engineering secretar-
ies were forced to get on-the-job taining. Such train-
ing proved costly for both secretary and engineer.
First of all, the average secretary rarely knows enough
about engineering to avoid mistakes when typing re-
ports. Most engineers, therefore, have to waste valu-
able time in proofreading letters and reports. As part
of the specialized secretary's training, BTC instructors
dictate from letters written by engineers and loaned
to the school by various Pittsburgh companies. Thus,
the course gives young men and women the training
necessary to enable them to assist busy engineers. The
engineers do not have to be delayed with details that
can be taken care of by a secretary who understands
the "shop-talk" of the profession.
     The aim of the course is not to make actual en-
gineers out of the students. It is important, however,
for the student to acquire an engineering background
by   doing   basic  science  work   and   learning   the
correct terminology involved in this work. The stu-
dent begins to think as engineers. Technical reports
become familiar. The particular language of the en-
gineer becomes second nature to the student.
     The course itself is a combination of physical
science classes, chemical experiments, field trips, slide-
rule instruction, and   lectures from   guest speakers.
Students perform   experiments with electrolytic cells,
motors, rectifiers, generators, photo-electric cells, and
radios. They extract metals from ores and analyze
inorganic substances and electro-chemical changes.
     Mrs. Iola Parker, BTC       engineering instructor,
tells of one experiment in the laboratory called the
"Razor-Blade Radio." Made from wire, a lead pencil,
a safety pin, a razor blade, paper clips, and a card-
board roll, this radio   actually picks up  broadcasts
from nearby stations. The razor blade serves as a sub-

stitute for a tube or crystal.
     In another experiment, a motor made from nails,
wire, and friction tape, runs at high speeds on direct
or alternating current. By conducting these experi-
men.ts, students are better able to understand the con-
version of electrical energy into motion via the electro-
magnet.
     Such lab work proves to be invaluable in the long-
run. Individually, the experiments may seem of minor
importance, but slowly the student begins to absorb
the practical aspects of the various fields of engineer-
ing as well as the principles involved,
     In addition, those taking the course have the op-
portunity to meet and discuss career problems with
some of the world's leading engineers, available as
guest lecturers. Instruction, however, is by no means

limited to the classroom. Field trips are scheduled to
chemical plants, steel mills, and other factories so
that students may see engineers in action and observe
the results of 'the engineer's work. The student, there-
fore, receives a thorough training, one that takes ad-
vantage of both classroom work and industrial .con-
tracts.
     The final, evaluation of the course, however, comes
from! industry itself. And industry is just as enthusiastic
about it as ,the students. Companies are aware of the
drastic need for secretaries with engineering know-
ledge, and they recognize the value of a course which
gives specialized training. These companies, with offices
located in almost every major city in the world, are
prepared to offer top-paying positions and advance-
ment opportunities to these graduates. The field is
wide open for these students. Young men and women
completing the course have the necessary qualifications
to work in an engineering office anywhere in the
world.

Mining was once considered a dangerous occupation.


           Today the mining industry is a




                      PIONEER IN SAFETY



                                                    BY CARL M. HAMILTON, JR., Mining E '59


   Although mining is considered the most dangerous
occupation in the United States, the mining industry
is making an earnest effort to alter this situation. Ex-
isting safety programs are greatly decreasing the num-
ber of mining accidents. But they are' still occurring.
    Many people believe that the mining industry em-
ploys only the laborer, the uneducated person, or the
unskilled class of men. This is far from the truth. In
recent years mining has become highly mechanized
Today it requires its workers to become highly profici-
ent in heavy machine operation.
     Since mining has the highest accident rate for the
number of men employed, it seems natural that they
would be the first industry to initiate a safety program.
The overall program could be greatly improved even
though considerable progress has been made during
the past thirty years.
     During the past twelve years, there has been a
 considerable decrease in the number of fatalities oc-
 curring. In 1945 there were over 900 deaths in the
 bituminous coal industry. The fatality total has drop-
 ped continuously since then; in 1956 there were only
 about 400 deaths. The injury rate per million man
 hours worked as compared to million tons of coal min-

ed shows profound improvement. In. a mine bought by
Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal Company in 1952, the
record was as follows: tons mined-2,934,275; tons per.
lost time accident-7,409. Within ten years of the ini-
tiation of an extensive safety program the record im-
proved to: tons mined-2,126,180; tons per lost time
accident-106,309.
  Employment in the mining industry dropped in the
last two years, the hours of exposure increased by three
per cent, and production is up eighteen percent.
    In mining, as well as in other industries, there are
certain major causes of injuries and fatalities. The five
major couses of fatalities in 1955 and 1956 were: roof
'or face cave-in,' haulage, electricity, machinery, and
explosives. Sixty-five percent of all underground fatali-
ties were a result of roof falls.
    Management is not sitting idle while these acci-
dents are happening. Most companies have safety pro-
grams; there is an industry-wide program in effect.
The Federal and State governments have passed legis-
lation concerning safety regulations and have establish-
ed agencies to enforce them and t'o study -and investi-
gate safety problems. Also mining organizations such as
The American Mining Congress, the National Coal
Association, and The United Mine Workers of Ameri-
ca have, in their organizations, safety committees that
are concerned with the safety procedure of the indus-
try.
     The Bureau of Mines has one of the oldest and
 most extensive programs. It distributes to miners all
 types of literature concerning mine safety, and trains
 miners and supervisors in first aid -and mine rescue. The
 Bureau recognizes that to improve mine safety each
 man has to be trained for his job and the prevention,
 of accidents is an important aspect of this job training.
     Miners taking the safety course learn the causes
 of accidents, the methods of preventing them, and the
 mining laws that have been passed in the interest of
 safety. Certificates are presented upon completion of
 the course. The results of the program thus far are a
 better accident frequency and severity rate and a better
 acceptance of the program.
     One of the other industry-wide campaigns for
 safety in mining is the Roof Fall Campaign. World-
 wide campaigns are being held to reduce the number
 of fatalities from this cause. Within the lifetime of min-

ing the number of fatalities has decreased from 2,500
yearly to less than 400, 'and the number of injuries
has decreased from more than 100,000 to less than 20,-
000 yearly. During the last few years -a yearly total
from falls has been 200 deaths and 5,000 injured. Not
every person injured was a worker. It was found one of
every eight persons killed was an official of some type.
Also, it was discovered that three-fourths of all fatali-
ties occurred within twenty-five feet of the working
face.
     The 1957 Roof Fall Campaign got under way
July 1, 1957, and will run until June 30, 1958. The
goal is fifty percent reduction of roof fall accidents.
This year's program has been put on a world wide
basis, but the National Safety Council remains one of
the largest contributors. The council has helped by
donating postors, scoreboards, information sheets, and
booklets. Awards will be given to union locals and min-
ing companies attaining the best record. The next few
years will undoubtedly show the value of the campaign.
     One 'of the most simple, yet effective programs,
developed when a safety director in one of the mines
noted that the number of 'accidents increased before
two periods of time, Christmas vacation and summer
vacation. The director decided to write letters to each
individual employee expressing best wishes for the
holidays and urging him to be safe in his work so that
he would live to enjoy the Christmas vacation. The
results of these letters were so good that another let-
ter was sent before the employee's summer vacation.
The letters gave such satisfying results that this is now
a yearly occurence at this mine.
     Mine accidents and production costs are related
as they are in other industries. Accidents rank third
among unwantea cost factors in the coal industry. Ac-

cidents cost the industry in excess of fifty million dol-
lars a year. That is approximately seven cents a ton.
Indirect costs are many times that figure.
     In the field of research much 'work is done to in-
crease safety and productivity. In recent years the use
of roof 'bolts aided in decreasing the number of' men in-
jured by falls and machinery. Roof bolting eliminates
timbers which in themselves create a hazard. At present
research is being done on fluorescent lighting in the
working places of a mine. In the mines that are using
the  fluorescent lighting, accidents are   becoming a
thing of the pas.t.
     The coal industry is by no means a vanishing field.
As mining becomes more technical and specialized,
greater effort will be expended to make it a safer in-
dustry. N

YOUR JOB INTERVIEW





            How should you prepare for this


            key to a successful career?






                                               BY DR. PAUL M. SHERWOOD


    Whether you are a freshman, sophomore, junior,
or senior, you should be preparing for job interviews
and developing leadership qualities. Every minute of
your University career should be spent in self-improve-
ment activities.
    I have observed that the men who get 'ahead in
business and in the various industries which hire Pitt
graduates are men who have three characteristics in
common. Companies want men who have 'an excep-
tional ability to express themselves in speaking and
in 'writing, self-confidence based on a thorough techni-
cal and cultural education, and an ability to put them-
selves in the other man's place.
    How do you develop 'these qualities? Let us look
at them one at 'a time.
    The ability to express yourself in speaking and in

a Pitt senior.


'writing comes first from having something to say. It
follows that you should budget a portion of your time
for reading outside your field of study. Especially im-
portant for you engineers-in-training is a working
knowledge of the business and industrial world. This
you can get from regular reading of such magazines as
U. S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT, BUSINESS
WEEK, and FORTUNE. Equally important is an un-
derstanding of what makes people tick. Nowhere can
you achieve this understanding more enjoyably than
in the world's great literature.
    Reading supplies you with the inventory of ideas
upon which you can draw when you need to communi-
cate ideas to people. Taking every 'opportunity to
speak before groups and constantly revising and rewrit-
ing any sort of 'composition, will also help develop this
first quality common to leaders.
    Self-confidence, the second quality, comes with
constant successful adjustments to new situations. To
be successful at 'anything requires thorough prepara-
tion and practice. When you are satisfied that you
have done everything possible to prepare for an ex-
periment, a speech, an examination, or a job interview,
you will approach the crucial moment with the poise
necessary to meet the demands of each situation. The
education which you receive at Pitt will prepare you
to compete on even terms with graduates of other
schools, only if you have achieved the same balance of
the technical, cultural, social, and spiritual develop-
ment they have achieved. This total development is
vital in your achieving a high degree of poise and self-
confidence.
    Balancing the abilities of self-expression and self-
confidence is the all-pervading quality of being able
to put yourself in the other fellow's place. Before men
can be moved to do things, they must be led to want
t.o do them. The successful leader is the one who really
understands the motives of men and who can empath-
ize with them.
    In summary, your best preparation for job inter-
views lies in learning all you can about men and mater-
ials in every possible situation. Your -academic work


        SKYSCRAPER                ENGINEER




prepares you well for coping with the physical universe.
Some of your learning about mankind can come from
the classroom, too. The "laboratory" of the Univer-
sity community provides invaluable experiences in bet-
ter understanding your fellow man.
     With the developed ability to express yourself
clearly, the self-confidence developed from thorough
preparation and constant striving toward self-under-
standing, and the ability to put yourself in the other
man's place, you need not fear any job interview. To
show you how important these qualities are, let me
tell you about several of our recent graduates.
     One of them, an honor -student who completed a
Master's degree before he took his first job, was very
good at expressing himself both orally and in writing.
He had, however, little experience in working with and
understanding people. In his first job he was put in a
situation where he had to supervise people and moti-
vate them to do things. He failed miserably and was
dismissed. In his second job he was hired strictly on a
try-out basis. He was put in a place where he had to
meet a lot of people without having responsibility for
their performance. After a year in this job, he has devel-
oped an ability to understand people.
     Another graduate, a fraternity man and campus
"wheel", was very articulate and self confident. Al-
though he knew exactly what he wanted to do, one
little matter stood in his way. He had achieved a rath-
er poor scholastic record. Largely because of this, he
had a difficult time finding a postion. Even the com-
pany in which his father held a fairly responsible posi-
tion did not invite him for a second interview.
     An exceptionally good student who graduated re-
cently had offers from a number of companies. Finally
he chose employment in a research and development
laboratory. In a recent conservation with him, he as-
sured me that he liked his work and that he was mak-
ing reasonable progress. He stressed, almost pleadingly,
that he feels hampered by his limited ability to write
reports. As I talked with him, I felt that he really
wished he could have another chance to develop his
writing and speaking abilities. Personally, I am sure
that he will overcome this deficiency, but I feel that
his statement is important to any student who is plan-
ning a career in a technical field.
     I remember another graduate who was an average
sort of fellow. He was in the middle third of his class
and had no outstanding record in activities or leader-
ship experience. Because of his honest and thorough
approach to his job interviews, his realistic assessment
of his potential, and his pointing toward a position
which was within his range, he was successful in secur-
ing an interesting job. He has made average progress,
'and his company has asked for "more men like Joe."
Here is a man who, having all three qualities in mod-
erate amounts, is building a successful career.
     I have been reviewing some of the long-range
methods of preparing for the job interview and have
been glancing at several case histories. In addition to
the long-range planning, there are several short-term

methods that you must know of before taking an in-
terview.
     First, you must know yourself well. Who you are;
what your home and community background is; where
your social, recreational, and cultural interests lie;
what you want to do with. this configuration of back-
ground, talents, and interests-all of these you should
know before you enter the interview room.
     Second, you should be thoroughly familiar with
the company to whom you are offering your services.
Nothing disturbs an interviewer more than to have a
student come to the interview without this preparation.
The interview time, short as it is, should be devoted
entirely to a mutual examination of interests. A really
painstaking effort to know each company will be a
strong point in your favor during the interview.
     Finally, you must present yourself at your best in
grooming, taste, and behavior. The best preparation
for this is to be constantly at your best in every situa-
tion. The habits of grooming and behavior which you
practice every day usually come through the thickest
polish you may be able to use.
     Meanwhile, if you want specific information about
techniques of preparing for a job interview, go to the
Pitt Placement Service. The New York Life Insurance
Company has published an ex6ellent brochure which,
if followed, will give you complete and valuable infor-
mation on this final step in finding that career posi-
tion. Copies of this booklet are available in the Place-
ment Office.

...in the field of INSTRUMENTATION


Among the many engineering problems relative to
designing and developing today's tremendously
powerful aircraft engines is the matter of accumu-
lating data - much of it obtained from within the
engines themselves - and recording it precisely.
Such is the continuing assignment of those at Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft who are working in the highly
complex field of instrumentation.
  Pressure, temperature, air and fuel flow, vibra-
tion -  these factors must be accurately measured
at many significant points. In some cases, the meas-
uring device employed must be associated with
special data-recording equipment capable of con-
verting readings to digital values which can, in' turn,
be stored on punch cards or magnetic tape for data
processing.

mation so vital to the entire engineering team at

is now building a similar facility in Palm

formation about engineering careers at
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, write to Mr.
F. W. Powers, Engineering Department.


Pratt & Whitney Aircraft is a special group of elec-
tronic, mechanical and aeronautical engineers and
physicists. Projects embrace the entire field of
instrumentation. Often involved is the need for
providing unique measuring devices, transducers,
recorders or data-handling equipment. Hot-wire
anemometry plays an important role in the drama
of instrumentation, as do various types of sonic
orifice probes, high temperature strain gages, tran-
sistor amplifiers, and miniaturized tape recording
equipment.
   Instrumentation, of course, is only one part of a
broadly diversified engineering program at Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft. That program     -   with other
far-reaching activities in the fields of combustion,
materials problems, mechanical design and aero-
dynamics - spells out a gratifying future for many
of today's engineering students.


The "Plottomat", designed by P & W A
instrumentation engineers, records pres-
sure, temperature and air flow direction.
It is typical of an expanding program in
automatic data recording and handling.

How RCA brings


a richer, wider range


of musical sound to your home


          Before high fidelity, the
          sound of recorded music
          was limited-much as
          piano music would be if
          you could hear only the
          notes played on the center
          of the keyboard. No
          rich bass notes, no keen,
          vibrant highs.
RCA achievements in the science of
sound and acoustics changed all that.
Today, with RCA Victor records and
high fidelity "Victrolas," the full range
of sound is reproduced so faithfully


that you can enjoy music almost as
though you were there.
  And now, Stereophonic Sound! A
new and dramatic dimension in re-
corded music is also yours to enjoy
on RCA high fidelity instruments.
Stereophonic units can be added to
most "Victrola"® Hi-Fi systems any
time you choose.
  In this, as in almost every area of
electronic progress in home entertain-
ment, defense and industry, the leader-
ship of RCA serves you. RCA means
electronics at its best!

The age of supersonic flights is producing a

sound phenomenon known as



                                SONIC BOOM




                                                               BY SANDY A. INSANA, Aero E '58


    In September 1954 at the National Aircraft show
in 'Dayton, Ohio, a group of F-86F jet fighters flying
at 40,000 feet went into a dive, simultaneously streak-
ing towards the site of the air show. The thousands of
people present at the event were stunned by -the series
of very loud, thunder-like "booms" that resulted sec-
onds after the fighters pulled out of their dives.
     Two years later, at a similar airshow in Oklahoma
 City, six F-100 super sabres roared at high speed over
 Will Rogers Field producing remarkably loud blasts
 that rocked the country side and shattered the windows
 of several residential homes and also the control tower
 at the municipal airport.
     What was this sound? What caused this phenome-
non? What was behind this sonic boom? The Air Force
and the aircraft industry attacked these questions and
found that the sonic boom is caused when an airplane
is flown through 'and beyond the speed of sound. They
are now making plans to eliminate the boom.
    With the increasing number of jet aircraft capable
of pushing through the sound barrier, sonic booms
have become more frequent. In an attempt 'to minimize
the effects of faster-than-sound travel, the 'aircraft in-
dustry and the Air Force are now performing their
high-speed test-flights in remote desert or ocean areas.
The result has been a minimum of sonic boom reports.
This does not mean, 'however, that the number of
high-speed flight experiments have been reduced. Pilots
of one major aircraft company alone have flown some
4,000 flights over the speed of 'sound and Air Force per-
sonnel have flown thousands more.
    A disturbance generated by an aircraft at subsonib
speed is propagated at a velocity greater than that of
the aircraft. A disturbance produced by an aircraft fly-
ing at supersonic speed is limited to the zone behind


the aircraft because the aircraft's velocity is now great-
er than that of the disturbance.
    To effectively illustrate this, consider the arrow
shown in Figure 1. It represents a subsonic speed mov-
ing through still air. As the arrow moves through the
air, its tip will affect a disturbance whose speed is
greater than that of the arrow   and move outward
from the arrow in all directions. The zone of this dis-
turbance is a circle of radius "aa t." The speed of the
disturban.ce is "a", and "At" is the time. The velocity
"v" of the arrow is less than "a", the velocity of the
disturbance; therefore, it continues to move ahead of its
origin.
    As the speed of the arrow increases, the circular

area of effectiveness of the disturbance decreases to
the point where the arrow now leads the disturbance.
The lines forming the cone are called mach waves, the
area inside the cone is called the zone of action, and
the area outside the cone is called the zone of silence.
An observer station in this zone of silence would not
be aware of the disturbance until the boundary of the
action passed him.
     For example, jet aircraft making a high-speed,
low-level run past a group of observers on the ground
would not be heard until the aircraft had passed them.
The aircraft, however, would be visible in its silent
flight. As the mach wave passes, the observers' ears
would immediately sense the full intensity of the dis-
turbance.
     Sound is normally heard 'when pressure waves with
frequencies of 20 to 2.0,000 cycles per second strike the
ear. The process has often been described as being
similar to the waves which are seen when a rock is
thrown into a still pond. The water waves represent
the pressure waves in air, which are interpreted by the
ear as sound. Ordinary conversation is actually 'a series
of pressure waves which are interpreted by the brain
as varying sounds. The louder the conversation, the
greater the amplitude of the disturbance. A very loud
sound, where there is 'a very great difference in pres-
sure on either side of the wave, is interpreted by the
ear as an explosive sound. This explosive sound is ex-
perienced when there is a very sudden increase in the
intensity of disturbance.
     Explosive sound can be created by a sudden re-
lease of' energy, such as a dynamite blast. Violent pres-
sure disturbance is caused 'by this release of energy and
these pressure waves move outward, away from the
source of the blast. The pressure waves are also called
compression waves, or shock waves. When these shock
waves pass the ear, an explosive noise is heard. Its loud-
ness depends on the amount of pressure built up by
the shock waves.
     When an aircraft flies at speed faster than sound,
it creates shock waves in the air, just as 'a motor boat
on a still lake creates surface waves, or as the dynamite
blast has created a shock wave. Under 'atmospheric
conditions, these shock waves created by the aircraft
reach the ground and are heard as explosive noises or
supersonic booms.
     Most of the booms heard so far h.ave been caused
by diving airplanes. In the typical dive an airplane is


pushed over from level flight at about 40,000 feet. It
accelerates from below the speed of sound to the speed
of sound and above. At a velocity slightly over the
speed of sound, a pattern of shock waves are formed
by the airplane that move toward the earth in the
direction of the airplane's flight and at the same speed.
The pilot begins pulling out of his dive at about 20,000
feet, and as he does so the airplane slows down, but
the shock waves do not. They spring forward from the
airplane toward the ground.
     As they do, the stronger waves absorb the weaker
ones, so that the original group of six or seven shock
waves are collected into one, two, or three booms when
they strike the ear of the listener. More than three
booms can be created -if the airplane is accelerated
through the speed of sound several times.
     The loudness of these explosive sounds depends
upon the top speed of the airplane in relation to the
speed of sound, the rate at which it slows down in
pulling out of its dive, and its altitude at the bottom of
the dive. These sonic booms can actually be aimed by


As shown above, shock waves form at the leading edges
of the wings, tail section, and fuselage of a jet fighter

the pilot at a ground target with very good accuracy.
     One of the loudest. sonic booms created so far was
made experimentally by North American Aviation's
senior engineering test pilot, George Welch. Welch
nosed his airplane to the speed of sound and pulled
out -at an altitude of 3,000 feet. Men who heard this
boom said it was "like heavy thunder--only louder."
The hanger used as the target for this sound experi-
ment was the Air Force's experimental testing station
at Edwards Air Force Base, located in a remote desert
area.
     The sonic boom story is in itself only a part of the
story of modern, air transportation. There is no need
for these sonic booms to be more than interesting
phenomena signaling the advent of supersonic flight
in this jet age. 0

REMOTE WELDING
    A new welding unit for sealing highly radioactive
materials in stainless capsules was recqntly plac-
ed into operation at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
'Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The unit is remotely operated
and uses an inert gas-shielded, arc welding torch. In
the initial production run at the Laboratory, which
Union Carbide Nuclear Company, Division of Union
Carbide Corporation operates for the U. S. Atomic
Energy Commission, thirty-four sources containing a
total of 8,000 curies of radioactive cobalt were sealed
using this equipment.
    The welding equipment consists of two portable
units: a power supply unit and a remotely-operated as-
sembly. The power supply unit is of conventional de-
sign and includes a welding machine, control panel,
and motorized amperage control.
    The remotely-operated portion of the welding
device, which is placed in a shield cell eqiupped with
mechanical manipulators, consists of a two-piece stain-
less steel frame, and motor-driven positioners for both
the torch and containers. Controls for the motors are
located outside the cell near a viewing window.


Looking through several layers of lead glass, a technician
manipulates the remote control Heliarc welding unit.

the assembly stage on this giant "atom smasher." The
34 foot long steel pressure vessel measures 8 feet in
diameter and covers the voltage-generating assembly
of the unit. These 35-ton accelerators, designed pri-
marily for basic physics research, cost about $1 million
each.

SCHOOLHOUSE ON STILTS
     Confined to one city block, a New Orleans' ele-
 mentary school, an all-welded structure, has been erected
 10 feet off the ground on two rows of ten concrete foun-
 dation piers each, plus exposed supporting columns
 under the end trusses. This permits a large, open cen-
 ter play court, 22 x 34 feet, as well as a virtually un-
 obstructed area beneath the classrooms, each of which
 accommodates 35 pupils.
     Classroom wings overhang the supporting piers by
35 feet on either side, calling for some unique struc-
tural analysis and design work in evolution of the
truss form. They are partially shop welded, then
,field spliced by groove butt and fillet welding. Steel
sections are principally wide-flange beams ,with bulb

VACUUM CASTING
      ,Large commercial casting are now being produc-
 ed at U. S. Steel's Duquesne Works, Duquesne, Pa.,
 by a vacuum casting method.
      This method of casting extracts harmful gases
 from the molten metal prior to the formation of the
 ingot. This in turn is expected to increase ductility in
 the forgings and to remove their sensitivity to internal
 ruptures.
      To successfully accomplish this removal of gases,
 a giant vessel, 17 feet in diameter and 30 feet high, is
 placed over the ingot mold. Before casting the molten
 -metal, the air in the vessel is removed by -four large
 pumps specifically designed for this purpose. The
 vacuum chamber remains airtight throughout the pour-
 ing operation. Ingots up to 95 inches in diameter and
 weighing 360,000 pounds may be cast in this way.
     Inspection of the ladle stream with the vacuum
 chamber is carried out by means of a closed circuit
 television hook-up.
     When television indicates that the ingot is com-
 pletely poured, the vacuum in the chamber can be
 broken, and the ingot can -be removed. It takes at least
 two days to cool the ingot before it can be further
 processed.
     In addition to servicing -the needs of electric power
 equipment builders, this process will be used for
 other high-grade steel products where trapped gases
 may have detrimental effects on the finished forging.


 GIANT GREASE MIXER
      A newly designed giant grease mixer is now being
 made for one of the leading petroleum companies by
 Struthers Wells Corpoartion. Just under ten feet in
 height, the mixer will hold 22,500 pounds of mixture,
 and will make for better and faster mixing.
     Grease additives, used in the mixer, break and
 mix the compounds into a better composition. The new
 equipment can be used in the manufacture of soap,
 oil, and other additives to soap stock.
     Some of the additives of grease corrode, so stain-
 less steel was specified. Allegheny Ludlum Steel Cor-
 poration supplies this steel in large plates.
     The 11/2 inch side plates are made of 10 per cent
 clad stainless, and the 5/8 inch hemispherically shaped
 bottom  plates have 20 per cent stainless clad over
 carbon steel. The agitator and paddles are to solid
 stainless steel. Type 304 stainless is being utilized for
 its corrosion resistant properties.
     The improved design calls for 'a sweep frame
 agitator with center paddles being independently driv-
 en by constant torque supplied motors located on top
 of the kettle.
     The design of the radial propeller was created
by Struthers Wells to combine the advantages of the
marine type propeller and the turbine type agitator.
While operating, the mixture filows around the bot-
tom of the mixer at a high peripheral speed, exposing
a 'high rate of new surface on the paddles and blades.


MOCK THERMAL BARRIER
     The intense heating of aircraft and missles flash-
 ing through earth's atmosphere at speeds above 5000
 miles per hour imposes problems of structural design.
 At supersonic speeds, air vehicles must withstand temp-
 eratures above 2500 degrees F. To investigate and
 overcome   structural  limitations, the  Westinghouse
 Electrical 'Corporation has -developed a complete ele-
 vated temperature test facility.
     The equipment consists of banks of tubular infra-
red   lamps, three-channel ignitron  controller, strip
chart temperature recorders, regular control (com-
puter) channels, master control desk, unit substation,
'and 'bus duct distribution.
     The increased speed enables an elimination of time
lags and thus more nearly simulates actual heat con-
ditions met in flight. At the unusually high speeds now
being reached by missles, heat is generated much
faster than it can be dissipated. As a result, metals dis-
tort, melt, or vaporize completely.


Intense heat conditions created in the Westinghouse Test-
ing laboratory distorts, melts, and vaporizes the metal.

BASKETBALL COMING UP
    Departmental competition for the E&M Athletic
Award will begin anew in February with the start of
a basketball tournament. All departments are expected
to field a team for this third round of athletic competi-
tion.
    Held in December, the volleyball tournament was
won by the Civil Engineers as they nosed out the Elec-
trical Engineers in a tight game.
    August Arrigoni, Mining '61, indicated in a re-
port to the E&M    Cabinet that softball competition
will also be included in the sport's program for the
spring semester.

    Foot stomping was the order of the evening at
the E&M    Barn Dance held at Fosbaugh Farm     on
December 6th. Approximately 40 couples, all sporting
straw hats, joined in the square dancing. Sponsored by
the Engineering and Mines Association, this affair
was the second social held this semester.

1958 EMITT AWARDEES
    Three   EMITT    Awardees will represent the
Schools of Engineering and Mines in Europe this sum-
mer. Each EMITT Award gives $500 to a Pitt en-
gineer so that he may work and travel in a foreign
country.
  Selected by this year's EMITT Committee were
Joseph Fitzharris, ChemE '59; James Terrill, ME '59;
and Michael Companion, PE '59.
    When applying for the awards, each awardee
indicated the country in which he wanted to work.
Joe Fitzharris named Germany, James Terrill selected
England, and Michael Companion indicated Austria.
The final decision of where they will work will not
be known until later this year.


WHO GOT THE SHAFT
    Mechanical engineers turned out in full force at
the department's annual Cider and Donut Affair.
Guest of h'onor for the event was Santa Claus, who
enumerated the misdeeds of the department's profes-
sors. The most common complaints were said to be
too many problems and difficult exams.
    Awarding of the Purple Shaft was the main point
on the evening's program. Given as a somewhat dubi-
ous honor, the Shaft is annually awarded to a mechani-
cal engineering instructor who, in the opinion of the
students, has perpetrated the most misdeeds during the
school year. Emerging from a large group 'of competi-
tors, Professor William Rudoy coped this year's Purple
Shaft Award.


ANALOG COMPUTERS FOR EE DEPARTMENT
     New equipment will go into use next semester
when the electrical engineering department establishes
its analog computer laboratory. Made possible by a
grant from the Atomic Energy Commission, two elec-
tronic analog computers have 'been purchased for the
new laboratory.
     One is a small size computer consisting of 10
operational amplifiers, a nonlinear function generator,
a cyclic reset generator, and precision resistors and
capacitors. It will primarily be used as an undergrad-
uate teaching aid.
    The other is a precision computer capable of
handling large size problems. This will be used for
demonstration on the undergraduate level and for. re-
search .and teaching on the graduate level.

"This was the kind of challenge


was looking for"


John A. Reiter, Jr., B.S. in Electronics, Arizona State College, '54,
discusses the biggest project so far in his Bell System career


    "One of the reasons I joined a Bell Telephone
Company," John says, "was because the engineer-
ing would be more interesting and challenging. I
knew I'd chosen well when I was assigned to assist
in planning a microwave radio relay system between
Phoenix and Flagstaff, Arizona. This was the kind
of challenge I was looking for.
   "It was to be a system requiring five intermedi-
ate relay stations, and I began by planning the
tower locations on 'line of sight' paths after a study
of topographical maps. Then I made field studies
using altimeter measurements and conducted path-
loss tests to determine how high each tower should
be. This was the trickiest part of the job, because
it called for detecting the presence of reflecting sur-
faces along the transmission route, and determining
the measures necessary to avoid their effects.
   "Not the least part of the job was estimating
the cost of each of the five relay stations, taking into
consideration tower height, access roads, and the
need for special equipment such as de-icing heaters.
All told, the system will cost more than $500,000.


When construction is finished in December of this
year, I'll be responsible for the technical consider-
ations involved in connecting radio relay and tele-
phone carrier equipment. Initially this system will
handle 48 voice channels, but can be expanded to
540. In addition to long distance telephone service,
it will also provide data transmission circuits.
    "This assignment is an example of the challenges
a technical man can find in the telephone company.
You take the job from start to finish-from basic
field studies to the final adjustments-with full re-
sponsibility. To technical men who want to get ahead,
that's the ultimate in opportunity."

ABOUT OUR

Steel is this country's biggest busi-
ness, and Russ Maxwell gives it
its. deserving treatment in "The In-
dustry  That Looked Back." For
the past three months, Russ gather-
ed material for his article.
  He became -familiar with some of
the problems of direct reduction
processes while working as an as-
sistant laboratory technician for U
S. Steel's Research Division.
  When Carl Hamilton was consid-
ering topics for his article, he chose
mine safety for two reasons. First,
since he is a mining engineering stu-
dent, the topic had specific applica-
bility.
  Second, he felt that due to the
wide publicity of mining accidents,
the public should be informed of
the herculean effort being made to
prevent accidents. ".Pioneer in Safe-
ty" is a must-read for both the lay-
man and engineer.
   For his article, "Sonic Boom",
 Sandy Insana received most of his
 information firsthand. He attended
 a series of sonic boom tests held
 by the National Advisory Commit-
 tee on Aeronautics at Edwards Air
 Force Base in California.
   At one of these tests Sandy saw


     AUTHORS


the pilot of a Bell X-5 dive from
40,000 feet and aim his craft at a
huge pane of glass set up on the
ground. When the pilot pulled out
of the dive, the resulting shock wav-
es shattered the glass.
  Electricity from nuclear-powered
generating stations is a major topic
of discussion.
  It was natural, therefore, for a
Pitt engineer to become interested
in the construction and operation
of the Shippingport atomic power
plant. G. Warren Duff gathered
the information for his article from
the most recently available reports.
  For her article, "Secretary with
a Slide Rule", Carolyn Stasenko
travelled to the new site of the Busi-
ness Training College in downtown
Pittsburgh for the facts about en-
gineering secretaries. There she in-
terviewed everyone associated with
the program, from the Dean down
to the students.
  Dr. Paul Sherwood has had a
number of years of experience in
placing  engineering  students in

"I'm in the business


and I know...


"Not too long ago I was in the same situation you       41
fellows are in now. Senior year and the big de-
cisions. What am I going to do with my education?
What am I going to do for a living?
   "Well, I talked to a number of people and did as
much letter writing and looking around as I could.
The way I figured it, I wanted opportunity ... a fair
chance to put my capabilities to work and to be.:
recognized for what I could do. Of course, I wanted
to be well paid, too. It all seemed to add up to the
aircraft industry ... and to me it still does.
   "In the space of just a few years I've worked on
quite a few projects, important projects that some
day may mean a great deal to this country. They
sure meant a lot to me. And I wasn't standing still
either. My salary and my responsibilities have i .-
creased with each promotion. That means lots o:
challenges, new and tough problems that we have to V,
solve, but that's the way I like it. So, if you want
some advice from this "old grad," choose the aircraft /:-   '
industry. It's the wisest choice, I'm in the busines'
and I know."
Probably no other industry in America has grow
   so fast and advanced so far in a short time as has    0
the aircraft industry. And yet there is no limit to
how far man's inventiveness and imagination can
push the boundaries. Radical new concepts that,
would have been unthought of just a few years ago
are the drawing-board problems of today.
  Truly aviation is still in the pioneering stage, and
one of the leaders is Northrop Aircraft, which has
been making successful contributions to our
nation's defense for over 18 years. Projects such as \,i,"
the Snark SM-62, world's first intercontinental
guided missile, have identified Northrop as a suc-
cessful pioneer. And new aircraft such as the super -,
sonic, twin-jet T-38 advanced trainer are maintain-
ing this reputation.

Recently AiResearch engineers were
called upon to develop an accessory
power motor for aircraft and mis-
siles which would operate at
+1000'F.... a temperature area
where present-day hydraulic and
electrical devices fail.
  Their answer was this cam piston
air motor, pictured above in a spe-
cially built transparent shell. Operat-
ing on hot air or gas, its efficiency
actually increases as temperatures
rise.
  This problem and its solution are


typical of many encountered at
AiResearch in aircraft, missile,
nuclear and electronic fields. Specif-
ically, you'll find them in system
electronics; computers and flight
instruments; gas turbine engines and
turbine motors; cryogenic and
nuclear systems; pneumatic valves;
servo control units and air motors;
industrial turbochargers; air condi-
tioning and pressurization; and heat
transfer.
  Upon your employment, in addi-
tion to direct assignments, a 9-month


orientation program is available to
aid you in selecting your field of
interest. This permits you to survey
the project, laboratory and adminis-
trative aspects of engineering at
Garrett. Also, with company finan-
cial assistance, you can continue
your education at outstanding uni-
versities located nearby.
  Project work is conducted by small
groups where individual effort is
more quickly recognized and oppor-
tunities for learning and advance-
ment are enhanced.

Why Vought Projects

Bring Out The Best

    In An Engineer

 At Vought, the engineer doesn't often
 forget past assignments. Like all big
 events, they leave vivid memories.
 And it's no wonder.
 For here the engineer contributes to
 history-making projects - among
 them the record-breaking Crusader
 fighter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
 to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
 the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
 mph fighter, details of which are still
 classified.
 The Vought engineer watches such
 weapons take shape. He supervises
 critical tests, and he introduces the
 weapons to the men with whom they
 will serve.
 Engineers with many specialties share
 these experiences. Today, for exam-
 ple, Vought is at work on important
 projects involving:
 electronics design and manufacture
         inertial navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
             methods
       Mach 5 configurations
Vought's excellent R&D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new fields
while advancing in his own.

with your training are doing at
Vought... what you can expect of a
Vought career?

The Aerodynamicist 7

                      Who Test-Hopped Equations


     There'd never been a fighter that could barrel at
more than 1,000 mph one minute and land on a carrier
the next. And, as a result, there was unusually keen ad-
vance interest in the flying qualities of the airplane
proposed by Chance Vought.
    Jim Madden was more than curious. As an aero-
dynamic design specialist, he would help develop the
Crusader's handling qualities. His job began with wind
tunnel tests.
    Jim converted tunnel information into a graphic
picture of static and dynamic forces affecting Crusader
stability. He used analog computers and equations of
motion to predict the build-up of forces during maneu-
vers. Hinge moments, loads, and required rates of con-
trol motion were determined and released to Servo-
mechanism and Product Design groups. Soon the
Crusader's stabilization and power control packages
began to take shape.
    Jim's part in the project could have ended right
there. But Vought's control system simulator helped him
proceed to some thoroughgoing conclusions.
    It duplicated the complete rod system and all servo-
mechanisms that would control the speedy new fighter.
In the simulator's cockpit, high above the Structures


Lab floor, Jim previewed control responses that test
pilots later would experience. Airplane responses to
Jim's rudder kicks and aileron movements were re-
corded on analog computers. Any inability of the
control system to position the aircraft during flight was
easier to spot . . . and, with test and design engineers
on hand . . . easier to correct.
    "It was like a big schematic - only better," says
Jim of the simulator.
    "It gave me a chance to work with the whole
system.
    "And actually watching aircraft responses to the
controls gave me a feeling for how fast they happen."
    Another thing that moved fast was Crusader devel-
opment. Vought's simulator and other facilities detected
problems before they compounded. The fighter reached
operational readiness in record time.
         Research, design and test facilities
            at Chance Vought allow the
          engineer to do a thorough job in
            advanced problem areas...

Interview with General Electric's

Earl G. Abbott

Manager-Sales Training



Advancement in a Large


Company: How it Works


Where do you find better advancement
opportunities-in a large company or a
small one? To help you, the college
student, resolve that problem, Mr. Abbott
answers the following questions con-
cerning advancement opportunities in
engineering, manufacturing and tech-
nical marketing at General Electric.
Q. In a large Company such as General
Electric, how can you assure that every
man deserving of recognition will get it?
Don't some capable people become lost?
A. No, they don't. And it's be-
cause of the way G.E. has been
organized. By decentralizing into
more than a hundred smaller oper-
ating departments, we've been able
to pinpoint both authority and re-
sponsibility. Our products are engi-
neered, manufactured and marketed
by many departments comparable
to small companies. Since each is
completely responsible for its success
and profitability, each individual
within the department has a defined
share of that responsibility. There-
fore, outstanding  performance is
readily recognized.
Q. If that's the case, are opportunities
for advancement limited to openings
within the department?
A. Not at all. That's one of the
advantages of our decentralized
organization. It creates small oper-
ations that individuals can "get their
arms around", and still reserves and
enhances the inherent advantages of
a large company. Widely diverse
opportunities and promotions are
available on a Company-wide basis.
Q. But how does a department find the
best man, Company-wide?
A. We've developed personnel reg-
isters to assure that the best quali-
fied men for the job are not over-
looked. The registers contain com-


plete appraisals of professional em-
ployees. They enable a manager to
make a thorough and objective
search of the entire General Electric
Company and come up with the
man best qualified for the job.
Q. How do advancement opportunities
for technical graduates stack-up with
those of other graduates?
A. Very well. General Electric is
recognized as a Company with out-
standing technical skills and facili-
ties. One out of every thirteen em-
ployees is a scientist or engineer.
And approximately 50 per cent of
our Department General Managers
have technical backgrounds.
Q. How about speed of advancement?
Is G.E. a "young man's Company"?
A. Definitely. A majority of all
supervisors, managers and outstand-
ing individual contributors working
in the engineering function are below
the age of forty. We believe that a
job should be one for which you are
qualified, but above all it should be
one that challenges your ability. As
you master one job we feel that
consideration should be given to
moving you to a position of greater
responsibility. This is working, for
in the professional field, one out of
four of our people are in positions of
greater responsibility today than
they were a year ago.
Q. Some men want to remain in a
specialized technical job rather than go
into managerial work. How does this
affect their advancement?
A. At G.E. there are many paths
which lead to higher positions of
recognition and prestige. Every man
is essentially free to select the course
which best fits both his abilities and
interests. Furthermore, he may mod-
ify that course if his interests change


as his career progresses. Along any
of these paths he may advance
within the Company to very high
levels of recognition and salary.
Q. What aids to advancement does
General Electric provide?
A. We believe that it's just sound
business policy to provide a stimu-
lating climate for personal develop-
ment. As the individual develops,
through his own efforts, the Com-
pany benefits from his contributions.
General Electric has done much to
provide the right kind of opportu-
nity for its employees. Outstanding
college graduates are given graduate
study aid through the G-E Honors
Program and Tuition Refund Pro-
gram. Technical graduates entering
the Engineering, Manufacturing, or
Technical Marketing Programs start
with on-the-job training and related
study as preparation for more re-
sponsible  positions.  Throughout
their G-E careers they receive fre-
quent appraisals as a guide for self
development. Company-conducted
courses are offered again at all
levels of the organization. These
help professionals gain the increas-
ingly higher levels of education
demanded by the complexities of
modern business. Our goal is to see
every man advance to the full limits
of his capabilities.
If you have other questions or want
information on our programs for
technical graduates, write to E. G.
Abbott, Section   959-9, General
Electric Co., Schenectady 5, N. Y.

...on the prevention of total war


"Modern civilization is now faced with a task of fatal
urgency. Unless man can find ways of limiting war,
modern civilization itself may perish. The difficulties of
limiting warfare today contrast with the capacity of
major powers to wage total war with ever fewer restric-
tions and ever fewer survivors. Today, it is no longer a
common belief in the dignity and destiny of man, but


only prudence and fear, that can prevent total war.
And yet, in the light of reason, the efforts to avert total
war hold more promise of success than the hope for
freedom from all war. It still is easier, as it has always
been, for man to restrict war than to establish peace
on earth."

JANUARY 1958





















you on the appearance of this year's
SKYSCRAPER, and the improved
editorial content. I think you now
have a magazine that makes enjoy-
able and understandable reading,
not ony for engineers, but for any-
one with an interest in the scientific.
               Bob Hawxhurst
               Editor, 1958 OWL


The Chairman Speaks
Dear Sir:
   In past years, SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER has been a great help
to Engineers' Week as an informa-
.tive intermediary and a means of
instilling enthusiasm in the student
'body. I certainly hope that this
year will not be an exception and
the SKYSCRAPER will again do
its part in making Engineers' Week
a success.
   If the students develop a person-
al interest in Engineers' Week, I
am sure that this will be the most
successful celebration ever seen at
Pitt.
       Russ Maxwell
       Chairman, Engineers' Week

 I' SKYSCRAPER will again be pub-
 lishing a special section on Engineers'
 Week in its March issue. This maga-
 zine will be on sale Thursday, March
 13.


 Hoot from OWL Editor
 Dear Sir:
   I wish to; thank you for your De-
 cember issue giving a bit of insight
 into the production of the 1958
 OWL.
   I am glad to see publicity given
 to the students who contribute so
 much of their time during their col-
 lege careers 'to activities. This will
 ultimately end in good public rela-
 tions for Pitt.
   Few sudents, and even fewer fac-
 ulty members, realize the far reach-
 ing importance 'of student publica-
 tions, both in the building of good
 relations with prospective students
 and high schools, and the practical
 experience gained by -the students.
   I would also like to commend


OWL Editor Bob Hawxhurst


Humor Anyone?
Dear Sir:
   I realize that since this is an en-
 gineering magazine ,most of the
 articles should be technical. I enjoy
 the magazine very much; however,

wouldn't it be improved by inject-
ing some humorous articles?
  I'm not inferring that more jokes
be added; there are enough jokes
already. Straight humor or humor
applied  to   engineering problems
'would make the magazine much
more interesting in my opinion.
                 Jo Ann Zagorski
                 MetE Secretary

It In our seven years on campus;
SKYSCRAPER       has found few en-
gineers who are able to write this
straight humor. Maybe this letter
will bring out some hidden talent in
one of the engineering students.

From an Author
Dear Sir:
   While preparing the article "Put-
 ting Isotopes to Work," which ap-
 peared in the December issue of
 SKYSCRAPER        ENGINEER,       I
 had the pleasure of becoming ac-
 quainted with some of your staff.
 The courtesy and interest shown
 and the advice given by these mem-
 bers greatly aided me in writing the
 article.
   I am sure such an attitude on the
 part of your staff will encourage
 other students to take an active part
 in SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.
            Michael P. Companion
            PE '59
Congratulations
Sir:
  I have received my October copy
of   SKYSCRAPER        ENGINEER
this morning. It is a beautiful job
which you and your staff have ac-
complished, and I know how much
pleasure you must feel in the ac-
complishment. The magazine does
credit to the University of Pitts-
burgh and that is the highest praise
I know. Thank you for sending it
to me.
     Agnes L. Starrett, Director
     University of Pittsburgh Press

   Although you may think that it's
 too early to begin looking for a sec-
 retary, there's no harm in seeing
 what's in store for you. Even the
 secretaries are  being  specialized.
 There's an   engineering  secretary
 for you in "Secretary With a Slide
 Rule." See page 20.



 The big news in nuclear power
 for peacetime use is the atomic
 reactor at Shippingport, Pa. Pitts-
 burgh's Progress highlights "The
 Shippingport Atomic Power Plant"
 with construction and operational
 facts. We think you'll enjoy the
authoritative handling of this time-
ly topic. See page 17.


  According to Russ Maxwell, the
steel industry is reverting to prima-
tive methods of iron production. Is
this true? We'll let you     decide
when you read "The Industry That
Looked Back." See page 14.



   If you were asked what the most
dangerous occupation was, what
would you answer? You        might
say mining. Several years ago you
would have been right, but today
mining is a safe operation. "Pion-
eer in Safety" explains the tre-
mendous effort being made by the
mining industry to insure safety for
its laborers. See page 22.

  Freshmen, sophomores, . juniors,
and seniors will want to put "Your
Job Interview" on their must-read
list. Dr. Sherwood, Director of
Pitt's Placement Bureau, gives some
pointers on the art of preparing for
an interview. See page 24.


  You've heard of a soprano break-
ing a glass 'with the vibrations from
her voice. Now it's being done with
airplanes. When an aircraft ex-
ceeds the sound barrier, there is a
loud blast. Sandy Insana explains
this phenomenon in "Sonic Boom."
See page 33.


Shown on the cover is an     artist's
sketch of the United States' first full-
scale atomic power plant solely for
civilian use. It has recently begun to
deliver power to the greater Pitts-
burgh area.
