EE, ME, ChE, Physics and Chemistry Graduates:

How soon after graduation will somebody
give you a chance to invent something?

It could happen on your first job.

Some very young engineers and scientists at
Xerox helped our “old timers" invent the electro-
mechanical-optical—chemical machine pictured above
—the Xerox 2400. On its patent documents you'll find
names like John Wirley (BSEE Univ. of Detroit ’60),
Henry P. Jankowski (BSEE Rensselaer Poly '62), and
Larry H. Warren (BSEE Clarkson '63). They all joined
Xerox right after graduating.

The 2400 is no fluke. It's just a recent example
of a tradition that began in 1959, when Xerox revo-
lutionized the office copying field by introducing the
now world-famous 914 Copier. From the 914 onward,
every new piece of equipment or system we’ve devel-
oped has had no real counterpart already on the scene
from any competitor.

What about the future? It gets even more inter-
esting. Because as advanced as today's systems may

appear, they don’t yet fully reveal the true technology
Xerox is pursuing—graphic communications.

Born out of the global information explosion
and its incredible potential for helping to solve man's
oldest problems (as well as his newest scientific rid-
dles), graphic communications at Xerox encompasses
the entire spectrum of communications in a graphic
sense: the formulation, reception, transmission, re-
cording, storing, retrieving, processing, copying and
presentation of any meaningful images.

And if you don’t think all this has a habit of
creating continuing opportunities to “invent some-
thing,” ask John, Henry, Larry. . . or some of your
own alumni who started their careers here...or your
Placement Director. If you prefer, write directly to
Mr. Stephen G. Crawford, Xerox Corporation, P.O.
Box 1540, Rochester, New York 14603.

XEROX, 2400 AND 914 ARE TRADEMARKS OF XEROX CORF'ORATlON

Performance Note: The Xerox 2400 (illustrated) can produce copies on ordinary paper directly from an original document at the rate of 2,400 per hour.
No “master" need be prepared first. An operator simply places the original on the machine, dials the number of copies wanted, and presses a button.

And yet, we think it has some validity. After all, a man’s growth can
depend as much on‘ the company he works for as the. company’s growth

th T. k depends on the man (remember, there are no statues to committees).
e   So to invest in your growth, and ours, every young graduate engineer
who joins the Timken Company spends up to four years in one of 22 in-
 dividualized training programs.

Extensive training

 Instruction takes place on the job and in the classroom. Later on there are
executive development programs at leading universities.

If I j  Every man with any job hunting experience knows not to ask that question.

But don’t misunderstand us. The Timken Company is not a graduate

 school. With us, you earn as you learn.

As one of our engineers, you’ll learn much of what we know about tapered

 roller bearings, or ﬁne alloy steel, and their inﬁnite applications. Hopefully,

you’ll teach us something, too.
0 You can be an indoor-type working on straight application engineering,
   research, testing and production. Or you can be an indoor-outdoor-type
and work in sales engineering. It doesn’t matter—choice of assignment is

  up to you. Challenging assignments

‘ If you choose the latter group, you’ll work in automotive, industrial,,and
railway bearing sales—or steel sales—helping customers solve their engineering
problems, which are also ours.

Some of our recent efforts: bearing engineering for a telephone cable-laying
ship now crossing the Paciﬁc, the Alweg Monorail, the world’s tallest crane
and biggest strip mining shovel, Craig Breedlove’s Spirit of America, a
moveable grandstand for the new District of Columbia stadium. Steel prob-
lem solving for Atlas missile silos, Project Mohole, the latest Kaman Heli-
copters, a 400-foot crane boom and hundreds of automotive gear and die
applications.

We won’t forget you

Advancement is not restricted to one department or division. A steel sales
engineer may be transferred to automotive sales and from there to Inter-
national. Whatever your job,iwe’ll never forget where we’ve put you. This is
one of the advantages of working for a company that is the world’s largest
producer of tapered roller bearings and a foremost producer of seamless
steel tubing, but is not the world’s largest corporation. We employ about
20,000.

The Timken Company has three products: Bearings, Steel, Rock Bits.
Uses for these products number in the growing thousands. And there is
always something new stirring.

The dramatic switch of the nation’s railroad freight cars to roller bearings,
a ﬁeld we pioneered, is an example.

An international company

There are 31 Timken Company sales ofﬁces in the United States and Canada.
Practically every major city has one.

We serve markets in 119 countries from 14 manufacturing plants located
in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France, South Africa and the U.S.
And we’re still growing strong.

How to Make Ethyl Palpitate

G. W Water

he-%\

  

  

To Pump ,

Illustrated apparatus has nothing whatsoever to do with experiment outlined below

Previous attempts to make ethyl palpitate have re-
sulted in rather sporadic success. A good yield once
obtained could not be duplicated on successive evenings,
and so on. Accordingly, it was decided to more closely
investigate the optimum conditions for favorable reactions.

One of the most important factors was found to be
the -purity of the ethyl chosen for the work. Some authori-
ties c-laimed that very impure ethyl alone could be counted
on for success, While others said that a hitherto unreacted
ethyl was best. Our extensive investigations have shown
that both of these extremes should be avoided.

Reaction of the highly impure material often occurs
with considerable violence, explosive at times, with great
attendant danger of damage to equipment and operators.
On the other hand, overly pure ethyl shows a naturally
unreactive tendency, forming products such as ethyl hesi-
tate, W-hich tendency cannot be overcome even by the
most skillful operator. The recommendation is therefore
made that samples of average purity be chosen for the
best yield. A good criterion of reactivity is whether the
compound, ethyl osculat-e, can be made easily.

As regards solvents and catalysts, alcoholic solutions
are generally most satisfactory, although they add some-
what to -the cost of prepartation. The alcohol concentra-
tion should be very carefully controlled, as the saturated
form of ethyl is useless. As a general rule, light should
avoided as it has a deﬁnite inhibitory effect in most cases.

One word regarding conditions of reaction. It is highly
important that noother member of the ethyl family be
present.

Chemically, the proper course of reaction is as follows:
As gentle warming is applied (which can be accomplished
by several means, an open ﬁreplace has much to recom-
mend it) -the formation of the following product-s is suc-
cessfully observed: ethyl reciprocate, ethyl agitate, in
some cases ethyl vibrate, and ﬁnally (if the heating has
been carried out at exactly the correct rate), the desired
product, ethyl palpitate.

Under no circumstancesishould the heating be at-
tempted too rapidly, as undesirable side reactions can be
set in, the mildest of which leads to ethyl remonstrate,
more usually to the sudden appearance of ethyl refrigerate,
and in certain extreme cases (which usually make head-
lines) to ethyl assassinate.

As a ﬁnal observation, the Skyscraper Engineer would
like to point out that with certain difficult reactions of this
type, the catalytic inﬂuence of gold, silver or precious
stones will insure good results.

PRECAUTIONARY NOTICE

It is well to mention (although probably known
already to mostoperators) that the equipment used in the
ﬁnal reaction must be encased in an impermeable material
(neoprene rubber is recommended), -thus avoiding the
annoying formation of ethyl pregnate, which, if allowed
to stand for several months, will in some unavoidable
cases, convert to ethyl propagate.

Please report the yield you obtain (and also which
ethyl you used) to the Skyscraper Engineer so that we
can check the experiment.

The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took
to the air on May 5, 1926. Within a year the
Wasp set its first world record and went on
to smash existing records and set standards
for both land and seaplanes for years to
come, carrying airframes and pilots higher,
fartner, and faster than they had ever gone
before.

In recent years, planes powered by Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft have gone on to set
new standards of performance in much the
same way as the Wasp had done in the
1920’s. The 727 and DC-9 are indicative of
the new family of short-to-medium range
jetliners which are powered by the highly
successful JT8D turbofan. Examples of
current military utilizations are the J58-
powered Mach 3 YF-12A which recently
established four world aviation records and
the advanced TF30-powered F-111 variable-
geometry fighter aircraft.

Dr. Fig-ley Newton of the Space
Research Coordination Center
(SRCC) has succeeded in developing
the world’-s ﬁrst moon rocket. Work-
ing under a research grant from the
Consolidated Fuzz Corporation, Dr.
Newton and a small group of engi-
neering students developed the three
stage device of rather unconventional
design.

The large ﬁrst stage is perhaps the
novel in that it does not leave the
ground. The engineers, applying the
principles of problem solving, decided
it would be much more efficient to
leave the bulky mechanism on the
ground. Fuel for the ﬁrst stage is
rumored to be high grade alcohol
although it has been known to imbibe
large quantities of low grade Scotch.

The second stage is more or less a
run-of-the-mill design and contains
the “brains” of the device. An in-
formed source claimed that the brain
was taken from the Medical Depart-
ment by some of Dr. Newton’s over-

What's

New

 

In
Engineering

zealous assistants. Dr. Newton’s sup-
porters denied this, charging it as
base libel. One even went as far as to
say, “This is base libel.”

The third stage is put into opera-
tion at approximately one-third of the
distance to the moon, and is said to
utilize “Moonshine” to reach the criti-
cal escape velocity. In its nose it
carries a charge which, upon impact,
explodes into large letters which spell
out Let There Be Light.

Dr. Newton’s Ballistic Launcher
and Tactical Thruster (BLATT) is
scheduled for testing in the near
future and it is rumored that if the
tests are successful Dr. Newton will
be awarded a contract by Americans
United Nationally Toward Inter-
spatial Exploration (AUNTIE) to
supply rockets for the exploration of
space, although stiﬂ’ opposition is ex-
pected from the Federal Economic
Commission Examining Space
(FECES) due to the prohibitive

costs.

Tired of having a pile of dirty
clothes lying around all the time?
Tired of washing and ironing them?
This is a thing of the past. The dis-
posible paper garment has come of
age. Innovated by the Purity Papirus
C0,, the garments come in purest
white, softest yellow, and petalist
pink. The paper clothes come in wide
assortments of dresses, shirts, pants
and even underwear.

For the women who sew, Purity
has developed patterns for the con-
struction of useful articles of clothing
from various paper products (ie.
paper napkins, kleenex, and toilet
tissue.)

This new idea has brought a whole
new concept to fashion. For instance,
paper napkins are appropriate for
day time wear, while waxed paper
and wrapping tissue are reserved for
after ﬁve wear.

Paper clothes are not only con-
venient and work saving, but so
thrifty. Just. think, never more will
you have dry cleaning bills, never will
you have a washer or dryer. Further
more, if successful the new trend will
eliminate closets, hangers, and ironing
boards.

Amazing new discovery enables one
to see through solid brick walls. The
innovation, an integral part of the
building, permits light to enter the
ordinary home without the beneﬁt of
gaping holes. The device may be
opened to permit fresh air, or closed
to block out weather elements such
as rain, hail, smog, sleet or snow. This
invention surpasses the x-ray in
producing a clear image.

The invention consists of a lens of
glass. Surrounding the lens is a frame
of wood or other suitable supporting
material. The mechanical system con-
sists of a cord and pulley system for
opening and -closing purposes.

There are some small drawbacks
which will be remedied in time. Peo-
ple on the other side can see in which
is a direct invasion of privacy. To
prevent this, some sort of translucent
covering must be devised.

Since the lenses are glass, they are
extremely brittle and may be shat-
tered when contacted with moving
objects such as bricks. The invention
must -be kept clean or it los-es its
clear visability characteristics.

ket this product.

How do you test a product

work being done day after day at

can have a hand in solving problems like these.
The six-mile product was a complete tele-
phone cable. How to test it before it was
buried underground — before modiﬁcations,
if necessary, became time-consuming and ex-
pensive? The solution was to design an “arti-
ﬁcial cable” — a model a few inches in length
whose electrical characteristics matched
those of the full-size cable. In this way, engi-
neers learned which type of cable would do
the job best, how many repeater stations
would be needed, and where repeater equip-
ment should be installed. Artiﬁcial cable lets
us anticipate ,and solve many other problems
. . . before they ever arise.
The small product was a thin ﬁlm circuit
—- an electrical path only thousandths of the
thickness of a human hair. How do you de-
sign equipment to make certain parts thinner,
to increase resistance, without altering other
parts? WE engineers used capillary action to
bring liquid only to the desired areas — and
electrolysis brought about the precise reduc-
tion. It’s quick in the telling, but it took sharp
minds to arrive at this solution.

THE SPACECRAFT TO MAKE A LEFT TURN ON ITS WAY TO MARS?

Sun signals might work fine (except maybe at night)
but you can count on control when you program with
the aid of a Motorola transponder and flight com-
mand subsystem.

Besides, if you were skimming along millions of miles
in outer space, you’d more than likely feel better
with some sophisticated electronics backing you up.

Motorola's sophisticated know-how stems from years
of experience in all major areas of modern elec-
tronics—from outer space, inner space, and down‘
to earth—to a company's computer as well as your
own dashboard.

In fact—how about your shirt pocket? You might

Thi-s month’s Techni-Cutie, Brenda,
tells us she has been posing in the
nude for as long as she can remember.
She was chosen on this basis. Of all
the models interviewed, she was the
least modest and readily posed for the
candid shots without even so much
as a blush. Brenda asked us to tell
everyone that she is 13 years old and
has a perfect 36 ﬁgure — 12-12-12.
About en{j'._..eers, she mentioned that
at one time she thought they were
going to the dogs, but lately she
t-hinkvs they have shown some

Brenda’. hobbies include bone-
chewing and basking in the su-n.
Among outdoor sports she likes cat-
chasing and roughing up delivery men.
She is also an art and music lover.
Her favorite recording stars are the
Beagles.

Although Brenda is too young to
attend college, she noted that in the
future she plans to make a few night
classes at the university in obedience
and other related ﬁelds.

Engineers & Scientists

With all
the companies

making the same promises,
how do you tell
the difference?

It is difficult! Perhapsthe best and only way is to studythe com-
pany carefully—to see if its structure, range and operational
modes permit it to make good its promises. If you scrutinize
Sylvania Electronic Systems, you'll discover a number of sal-
ient facts that may help clarify the matter for you.

Note first that Sylvania employs the small group form of or-
ganization—within its nationwide complex of research and de-
velopment groups, manufacturing plants and world-wide field
engineering operation. This makes swift individual progress
and development possible within a wide choice of current in-
house projects.

Note particularly the diversity and breadth of SES projects.
You may advance in a technical or administrative capacity in
any of these areas: ground electronics equipment for Minute-
man missile sites...research and development in electronic
warfare field...electronic security systems...
ASW systems...specia| purpose airborne com-
puters for incorporation into U.S. Air Force large
scale electronic systems...laser systems...de-

    

GENERAL TELEPHONE & ELECTRONICS

sign of spaceborne electronic and optical systems...plus
world-wide engineering support systems.

Note that SES has worked out three distinct routes for ad-
vancement, all with equal rewards—technical specialist, tech-
nical manager, program/project manager.

Finally, note how SES encourages ambitious individuals to
accelerate their development through participation in Division-
wide conferences, in-plant courses and seminars and post-
graduate study plans conducted on an unusually generous
scale.

The success of the SES mission—to manage government
systems programs for General Telephone & Electronics, the
parent corporation—depends on the professional and intellec-
tual growth of its personnel. In every respect, SES has created
an environment to foster that growth. Be sure that any prospec-
tive employer you consider has established a
growth climate of like specifications.

Making promises is one thing. Making progress
is another.

What kind of engineer will you be...

preliminary design, design, development?
At AiResearch Phoenix, you Work as all three

before you decide.

Ymr future as an engineer is
strongly inﬂuenced by your ﬁrst
assignment. What that assign-
ment will be, should be, is an
important decision.

At Garrett you control that
decision. During an eight-month
orientation program, you work
with experienced engineers on a
variety of assignments in different
areas. Your permanent assignment
depends on your own aptitude
and interest.

In preliminary design you may
work on gas turbine engines, jet
engine starters, or advanced power
systems for space vehicles. Analy-
sis is the key—and the emphasis
is on thermodynamics, fluids,
vibration, heat transfer, and math
to solve today’s problems.

As a design engineer, you see
your solution to a product design
problem take shape on the draw-
ing board and in fabrication. You

09

 

may work on controls systems for
turbine drives, engine fuel sys-
tems, or a laboratory test system.
Mechanics is the theme—statics
and dynamics, materials and pro-
cesses, and graphics are your tools.

In development, you’ll test
designs before they go into pro-
duction. Manufacturing processes
are examined and production
techniques are explored. Every-
thing from nuts and bolts to com-
plete power systems are tested,
and your lab work and practical
judgement will pay off in this area.

Your career at AiResearch
Phoenix can be stimulating and

 

rewarding. You can work in all
three important areas of engineer-
ing on diverse aerospace products.
You can use your total education,
learn more on top of it, and take
part in a wide variety of advanced
engineering.

At AiResearch Phoenix, the
product lines include gas turbines
for auxiliary power, turboprop
engines for business and military
aircraft, secondary power equip-
ment for aircraft, advanced space
vehicle nuclear power systems,
pneumatic and hydraulic control
systems, as well as a variety of
related equipment for aerospace,
ground, and undersea applications.

acetoacetate [CH3COCH2COOC(CH3)3] by methods
that bring the price down to $3.50 a pound—about one-
sixth the prevailing research-quantity price—with the usual
prospect for a substantial further plunge as volume de-
velops. A plunge to reach the price level of methyl aceto-
acetate and ethyl acetoacetate, two currently large-vol-
ume acetoacetic esters of ours, is unlikely. The tert.-butyl
ester, however, has an advantage over the other two. When

acetoacetate esters for making ketones, there is no such
neat cleavage. There the ethyl or methyl group has to be

ated tert.-butyl acetoacetic esters to split out isobutylene
and then decarboxylate opens up promising. routes alsoto

A PREVIEW OF YOUR CAREER AT GENERAL ELECTRIC
Achieving Thrust for Mach 3

When the North American Aviation XB-70 established a mile-
stone by achieving Mach 3 flight, it was powered by six
General Electric J93 jet engines. That flight was the high
point of two decades of G-E leadership in jet power that
began when America’s first jet plane was flown in 1942. In
addition to the 30,000-pound thrust J93’s, the XB-70 carries a
unique, 240—kva electrical system that supplies all on-board
power needs—designed by G-E engineers. The challenge of
advanced flight propulsion promises even more opportunity
at G.E. GETF39 engines will help the new USAF C-5A fly more
payload than any other aircraft in the world; the Mach 3
GE4/J5 is designed to deliver 50,000-pound thrust for a U.S.
Supersonic Transport (SST). General Electric’s involvement

in jet power since the beginning of propellerless flight has
made us one of the world’s leading suppliers of these prime
movers. This is typical of the fast-paced technical challenge
you'll find in any of G.E.’s 120 decentralized product opera-
tions. To define your career interest at General Electric,

Dean Agrees To Strip For Skyscraper Engineer

“All The Way”

Alum Hall Burns

To Ground As Kraig Fiddles r

Fire of undetermined origin
today leveled Alum Hall located
on the local campus of the P. of
U., Dr. Kraig was playing his
ﬁddle at the time for a graduate
course in modern square dance—
1820 to present. The dance was
termed a success by Dr. Kraig and
his associates — the Hill Bros.
However, the class was called
when ‘Dr. Kraig’s bow caught ﬁre
and he was unable to continue.

The blaze was discovered at
8 a.m. in a faulty electric percola-
tor located in the third ﬂoor
graduate division. However, the
alarm was not turned in until
noon since apparently A1_um Hall
was built -previous to the discovery
of ﬁre alarms and none could be
found. Luckily, a passing under-
graduate saw the blaze and by
word of mouth the news ﬁnally
reached a commuting student
whose father was a ham operator.
Thereby, the news reached Fair-
banks and the alarm sounded.

Firemen reached the scene at
5 p.m. and by 10 p.m. reported
they -had managed to let the fire
burn out of control. Hoses were
stretched from Squirrel Hill, but
upon reaching Alum Hall it was
discovered that the hydrant was
not turned on. This greatly
hindered the ﬁremen.

By 11 p.m. the building was

leveled. All of the labs, the equip-
ment, the stockroom supplies and
books were destroyed. Nothing
was saved but Dr. Kraig’s ﬁddle
and a few graduate students.
Dama-ge was estimated at $50.
This excessively high ﬁgure is
attributable to the loss of the ﬁre
chief's hat, valgued at $37.50. The
ﬁre chief has issued a plea to any-
one ﬁnding the hat to please re-
turn it since it was a present from
CORA (‘Central Organization for
the Regulation of Armnists).

A spokesman for the P. of U.,
Dr. Walrus, expressed great con-
cern over the blaze. He stated
that the building fund of 100
rubels was lost in the rubble. The
fund was started by Dr. Walrus
to obtain a new wing to provide
more and better accommodations
for the graduate students. He
made his appeal for the funds to
foreign governments since it was
election year at the state capital.

Financial chancellor for the P.
of U., Dr. M. T. Funds, B.A.,
Ph.D., LTD. SPAC, said construc-
tion of a new dance hall and
chemistry building will be started
as soon as the GSA is notiﬁed of
the university’s loss. Until fur-
notice, Dr. Fun s said, the square
dance classes will be held at the
Cynical Arena and all -chemistry
classes and labs are canceled.

Hill Project Offers lPlay

Thursday's production of The
First Christmas by the Squirrel
Hill Education Project for Under-
privileged Children was an illus-
tration of both the strength and
weaknesses of the seldom used
pageant form as a vehicle for the
amateur theater.

The Squirrel Hill area group
was aided by a strong story line.
The plot, which revolves around
an actual incident which took
place in biblical Bethlehem de-
velops a strong conflict between
three kings and a group of pea-
sants, but avoids the issues raised
by this obvious ethnic confronta-
tion, instead focusing on its
alleged socio-religious resolution
in a sort of nativity allegory.

Issues of content tended to be
somewhat obscured, however, by
serious lapses in direction and
casting. Director Merv Garﬁnkel’s
stylistic device of employing an
entirely female, Negro, 8 to
10-year-old cast became very
distracting as the evening prog-
ressed, particularly in the third
act scene between Joseph, played
by Ema Lou Jones, and Mary,
played by Marsha “VVeasel”

Brown. Both Jones and Brown
failed to build up to the emotional
climax demanded -by the scene,
as they ran the gamut of emo-
tions from A to B.

The second act knocking-over
of a cardboard tree by Wilma
Washington as A Cow also dis-
turbed the dramatic continuity.
However the cast showed its pro-
fessional promise when they
quickly picked up the play follow-
ing Miss Brown’s dropping of the
infant Jesus, adequately played
by a Chatty Cathy doll.

The generally wooden handling
of the lines was offset somewhat
by the pigmental brillance of the
sets showed a distinctive “primi-
tive” handling of the ﬁngerpaint
medium. Designer Peggy Davis’
sensitive placement of a haystack
and pigeon roost still life pro-
vided much visual excitement.

Because Miss Davis employed
pastel blue water color on broken
cardboard boxes to create a
heavenly background, some ad-
vertising could !be seen in her sets.
The Pepsi-Cola sign among the
clouds added a modern ﬂavor to
the ancient scene.

Wardrobe and make-up work
was competently done, but direc-
tor Garﬁnkel’s unfortunate choice
of the out-of-doors stage medium
was distracting and ultimately
self-defeating. Many of the actor's
lines were rendered inaudible by
Fifth Avenue streetcars. Particu-
larly annoying were the passing
drunks who tried to molest
several younger members of the

cast. Gradually the stage, actors,
and scenery disappeared with the
nightfall, completely obscuring
the visual climax. The curtain
rung down midway through the
fourth act when Miss Jones was
called home for supper by her
mother.

This production demonstrated
the group's deﬁnite potential, and
we await its future efforts.

EXCITEMENT RUNS Hig‘-h Iln The Third Act
Of The First Christmas

At a luncheon meeting of the
Board of Trustees of the
Skyscraper Engineer, the official
undergraduate publication of the
School of Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, distributed
on six Thursdays throughout the
academic school year, Miss
Chiquita Banana, the newly ap-
pointed Vice—Chancellor for Stu-
dent Affairs at the University of
Pittsburgh, approved a new comic
strip series for that magazine.

When asked her opinion of the
new cartoon feature, Miss Banana
replied, “I beg your pardon, I
didn’t hear the question. Would
you mind repeating it?”

This reporter requeried, “What
is your opinion of the new
cartoon feature?”

Miss Banana rereplied “I like it.
I think it is very clever and so
well drawn. It makes me laugh.
‘ Also in attendance was the As-
sistant Vice—Chancellor for Stu-
dent Affairs at the University of
Pittsburgh, Wolfrgand Von Rana
who was seated by Miss Banana’s
feet. Throughout the luncheon he
frequently interjected, “Yes, Miss
Banana.” “Of course, Miss
Banana.” “No, I tend to agree
with Miss Banana’s point.” Mr.
Von Rana added that he didn’t
quite enjoy the food because of a
small deposit of shoe polish on
his tongue.

The comic strip, titled ‘‘All The
Way” is the story of Wanda

Skrewis, daughter of a Rhode".

Island kidney bean sharecropper,
who has matriculated to the Uni-
versity. Featured in the ﬁrst issue
of the Skyscraper Engineer are
Wanda’s earliest experiences on
campus. These include her ﬁrst
panty raid, her second panty raid,
and her third date.

When asked to comment on the
leading comic strip character Miss
Banana replied, “I ﬁnd it very
easy to identify with her. I am
deﬁnitely pro-Miss Skrewis."

Beneath the surface humor is
the tender moving story of a
young girl slowly awakening to
the world around her. There is
much psychological insight into
her developing personality and a
strong appeal to mystical
illusions.

The creater and chief cartoonist
of “All The Way" is Sniggers
Hernadez, who is famous for the
stimulating characteratures found
in the Alumni Hall M-en's room
and on the Schenley Hall eleva-
tors. A follower of Rousseau
school of naive realism, the
Atlantic Monthly described
Hernadez’s line sketches as
“crude, vulgar, and repulsive.”

The Skyscraper Engineer re-
ports a phenomenal undergrad-
uate response to the proposed
comic strip addition. “All The
Way” will appear regularly in
that" magazine beginning with
the March issue.

You can do something about it.

You can ioin IBM. And help shape
a better world.

The key is IBM computers. They're
helping medical researchers learn
more about cancer and factors
associated with it. Helping educators
develop new techniques for instructing
culturally deprived children. Helping
engineers plan flood-prevention
programs.

Computers are helping to do a lot of
good things for a lot of people. But

computers are only tools——they

can't think. And that's where you come
in. In your hands, man's most daring
dreams can become reality—to make
a better life for more people.

ENGINEERING LIBRARY REVIS-IES
CATALOGUING PROCEDURE

The Engineering Library is ini-
tiating a new system. The typical
engineer usually has a difficult
time ﬁnding the book he needs
under the ordinary indexing sys-
tem. Under the new system, the
book will be stacked according to
color.

Each group of colors will -be
arranged according to size. The
books will, however, still have
numbers imprinted upon their
jackets. The ﬁrst line of the
number might look like’ this:
PV = ZN1.98T or E = IR3. Any
engineer would know -the general
contents of each book by just
looking at the ﬁrst line of the
book’s number. To ﬁnd a speciﬁc
book, the engineer would merely
look at the second line of the
book number. The second line
would be strictly represented by
digital numbers.

For example a catalogue card
might look like this.

From this card we know that
the book is blue and of medium
size and that it's a Chemical Engi-
neering book. The ﬁrst two digits
of the second line of the book
number tells us the letter of the
alphabet with which the author’s
last name begins. For instance
the ﬁrst two digits are 2'7, a letter
of the Alphabet which coinsides
with this number doesn’t exist.
In this case we subtract the
second number from the ﬁrst
(2-7 = —5) and add the result
from the original number (27—5
= 22). Thus the author’s name
begins with V, the 22nd letter.

The second two letters give the
age of the author at the date of
the ﬁrst printing of Perry's Hand-
book. The last four numbers con-
cern the book itself. The ﬁrst
two of the last four digits are
added. The second two of the last
four digits are added. The sums
are multiplied and the square

Complains

Dear -Editor:

I am writing this letter to show
them dumb Liberal Arts clods
that not all engineers are clods.
And its dumb for them to say
them dumb things that they say!

Liberal Arts students think
that us engineers have no cluture.
Well their wrong. We do have
culture. L.A.’s think that we are
scared of girls. Well we are not.
We like girls. We, II. believe in
dating girls and sometimes I even
kiss them too!

If anyone was to meet me on
the street, they would never think
that I am a engineer. I wear my
hair long and have a goatee. I
am very particular about my ap-
pearance. My shirts are clean and
I smell nice ( I wash at least
once a week).

Besides rock-n-roll, I also dig
jazz and art movies. Fraternity
life is a integrule part of my
make-up and I devote much of
my time to social betterment.

Mansion Wins
Writing Award

Sophomore Drum Major Bill
Mansion yesterday received a Dis-
honorable Mention award in the
Atlantic Monthly’s annual poetry
contest.

Mr. Mansion submitted ﬁve
short poems, all of which were
quite vociferously and none too
politely. rejected. Even though all
his-poetry met with critical scorn,
only one work was awarded the
Dishonorable Mention. Titled “Ode
To A Fire Hydrant”, it proceeds
thusly.

It is now and always was

A boon, the ﬁre hydrant.

It gives relief and restful pause

To every doggy migrant.

When asked on how much pre-
peration went into his award
winning poem, Mr. Mansion
answered, “I ﬁrst spent several
months studying the habits of
dogs and then two years of re-
writing the poem in English. I
Because I devoted so much time
to this project I'm afraid my
grades have suffered. But winning
this national award surely over-

balances my present academic
difficulties.”
Mr. Mansion, a graduate of

Morganza Preperatory School, re-
vealed the extent of his scholastic
problems. “My Q P.A. rig-ht now
is .0069 but I think I am
guaranteed of getting at least a
“D” in gym this term.”

As for future plans Mr. Mansion
explained,” I think I’ll continue
as editor of the Pitt Nudes one
more term as the University
scholarship, and the bribes from
the Administration and Student
Government candidates make the
position very worthwhile.”

Soggy Food Changes
Announced

Ever striving for the most
modern and hygenic dietetic
services in the United States ,it
was recently announced by Soggy
Food Service that several policy
changes have been made concern-
ing the Towers Cafeterias. These
include:

1. Since the devastating plague
last fall, guards have been sta-
tioned at the warehouses to shoot
off the giant rats which come to
drag oﬂ’ the horsemeat.

2. The new cesspool has been
constructed behind Alumni Hall
replacing the one under the
bakery, following the “There's An
Air About The Rolls” protest
marches and meal ticket burnings.

3. The mysterious meat vat
has been drained for the first time
this century.

Alpha Sigma Sigma Beats Girls For

Intramural Basketball Champ’ship

Alpha Sigma Sigma, tall men's
fraternity on campus, played their
initials off in winning the intra-
mural trophy for basketball. In-
tramural coach Basil “Fair-Deal"
Backcourt said the boys wno last
night's playoff squeaker with a
combination full-court-press-be-
low-the-belt-karate attack. Final
score was 1-0.

Mary Makum, 7 foot 6 star cen-
ter for the losing team, Nu
Omega Beta Alpha Lambda
Lambda Sigma, said the boys
were constantly assaulting them
and their style was hampered.
The girls’ usual attack consists
of a fast bustaway and a swivel
hip routine that keeps the fans

howling. However, with the boys
using karate, the girls’ attacks
were kept at a minimum.

Spokesman for the boys’ team
-Captain Wilted Chambermaid, -1
foot 2 star guard, said it wasn't
winning that was so important,
but the factof having so much
fun beating back the girls.

Three of the Alpha Sigma
Sigma players are in the hospital
as a result of the game. 'l‘h<-y
are all recuperating from mm
plete physical exhaustion
were reported sleeping comtor
table with smirks on their faces
after the action. The boys will
be honored at a smoker later
this month by Dr. Spock.

Ideas and Failures ~*

On Sale

The all new, summer, fall, win-
ter, spring 1963-64-65-66 spectacu-
lar of Ideas and Failures, the
campus literary magazine, will be
on sale next year at the Towers
Lobby and the ‘Cathedral Desk.

In addition to the usual con-
glomeration of pseudo-inltellectual
poetry and prose a new feature
has been added. Titled Pomo-
graphia Miscellania it will feature
all material rejrcted by Grove
City Press.

This year's printer is Whipple
Brothers Ltd, Hong Kong. They
regularly employ 75,000 Buddhist
Monks to hand print the maga-
zine. Because of the size of the
Ideas and Failures contract they
have reduced their work force by
74,998. Progress has been very
slow becouse of the Monk's un-
familiarity with the English char-
acters, and the number of holi-
days in this the Year of the Toad.
The magazines are expected to
arrive in Pittsburgh on the back
of 42,000 yaks by the middle of
January.

4. Typhoid Mary has been pro-
moted to head cook, in an effort
to keep her from contact with as
much of the food as possible.

5. Name tags, in the form of
piglets, have been awarded to
several deserving students, per-
mitting each swine bearer to
leave his tray at his table after
every meal.

6. Soggy Food Service has
stopped buying canned goods
from the local undertaker's
brother, following last spring’s
kickback scandal.

Co-Ed

Raped

House lviother
Arrested

A foul smelling deed was com-
mitted by the house mother of
Andy Hall, Mrs. Square. Mrs.
Picadilly Square was freed of the
crime because co—ed Lotta Lumps
refused to press charges.

Last Thursday afternoon at
2 p.m., the University police found
a young college co-ed sprawled on
the Student Union steps, in an
apparent drunken stupor, clutch-
ing a dirty sock in her right hand.
When questioned by the police,
the co-ed, Miss Lotta Lumps, in-
sisted that she had not been
boozlng.

The only clue, a dirty sock, was
sent to the crime analysis 1abra-
tory. The lab conﬁrmed that it
was a dirty sock, probably worn
three times on simultaneous after-
noons approximately three
months previously. Upon futrher
interrogation, Miss Lumps re-
vealed that she had done her
laundry in Andy Hall on said
Thursday at approximately
10 a.m, and that was the last
physical act she could recall.

A thorough investigation dis-
covered gin in the automatic
washers at Andy Hall. Dorm stu-
dents when questioned concern-
ing the gin, said that they thought
all Pittsburgh water smelled that
way.

All indications pointed to the
house mother, Mrs. Picadilly
Square, as the culprit. Picadilly
admitted that she had put‘ the gin
in the washing machines but only
as a cleaning agent. Upon pre-
senting Mrs. Picadilly Square
with a warrant, detectives
searched her apartment and un-
covered 168 empty gin bottles, a
still, and one dirty sock.

Mrs. Square was held by police
and charged with the theft of the
dirty sock. Miss Lumps refused
to press charges.

If you still think glass is just glass,

Now glass can do what metals can—and more. Much more.
Ask Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

For years, the only way to get a sample of the ocean’s ﬂoor
was to lower what they call a “bottom corer” on a wire and
then laboriously haul it up again. Not any more. Now a
“Boomerang Corer”—made for Woods Hole by Benthos, Inc.
—is simply tossed overboard and allowed to plunge freely.
When it slams into the ocean ﬂoor, it drives a sample of sedi-
ment into a hollow tube inside the corer.

The impact releases two glass spheres that can do what
most hollow metals can’t: withstand the tremendous pres-
sures at the bottom of the ocean. They tug the tube loose and
ﬂoat it to the surface. A ﬂashing beacon inside one of the
spheres pinpoints its location for the waiting ship.

Today glass can be made to maintain constant electrical

conversations In
Electrical Engineering

Laboratory

To keep the material for this article as nonrehearsed
and impromtu as possible, a microphone was concealed in
an oscilloscope and a tape recording was made of the
conversation during one electrical engineering laboratory
session. Following is that recorded conversation:

“Well, here we are again!”

6CUgh.3!

“Barf.”

“I wonder what kind of farce we perform this week?”

“Anyone read the experiment?”

“Surely you jest.”

“Wha-t experiment?”

“I did.”

“Damn you, Morma. You know the rules. Nobody
reads the experiment until the lab begins.”

“The Luna ran dry last night and I didn’t have the
new Playboy. I just glanced brieﬂy through the book.
I must have been out of my mind.”

“Junkowski. Smash Morma ﬂush on the mouth with
your slide rule.”

WOP!

“Good grief. I should say that hurt plenty.”

“Ohhhhh!”

Drip. Drop. Drip. Drop.

“Don’t bleed here, you’ll short out the circuit.”

“Moan. Moan.” ,

“Put these under your pillow tonight. The good fairy
will -bring you forty‘ cents.”

“’I‘hat’ll learn you a thing or three.”

“I guess we might as well get the show on the road.”

“Jolly good idea.”

“It says here ‘From your knowledge of the oscilloscope
gained in previous experiments, connect the scope into
the circuit shown, so the voltage ﬂuctuating across the
existential retrospector may be quantitatively observed’.”

“Any of your toads posses-s some oscillocope
knowledge?”

“Zilch.”

“Ditto.”

“Not me.”

“I saw them use it in a submarine war picture once.
Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.”

“That’s radar.”

“This must be the switch. Turn it on.”

“What’s an existential retrospector?”

“Beats me.”

“I’m snowed.”

“Belch.”

“Why not ask Hobby?”

“Hell no! He’s too busy translating. Let’s fake it.”

“This must be it.”

“Well, we can hook the exit tensional respector into
the circuit and see what happens.”

“That’s existential retrospector.”

“Wow. Look at the pretty test pattern.”

“Put on Channel 4. I want to see Batman.”

“It says here, ‘Plo-t the suicidal source current as a
functional of time measured in hours.”

“Thats sinusoidal, idiot.”

“What does sinusoidal mean?”

“I don’t know.”

“It. has something to do with the cavities in your

head.”

“I sent mine to Arizona.”

“Where do we put the ammeter in the circuit to
measure the source current?”

“Across the source, I guess.”

“What happened?”

“The needle went around ﬁve times and melted.”

“Try a bigger meter.”

“That needle just went around twice and evaporated.”

“They don’t make those meters like they used to. I
guess we’ll have to fudge that into the report.”

“Morma, Touch those two wires together. Feel
anything?”

“No.”

“Then be careful of these two. They have 220 volts
in them.”

“Hey, Lowcost?”

“Grunt.”

“You learning anything?”

“Nope.”

“It says here, ‘Plot the smoke coming from the exis-
tential retrospect or as a funtion of time measured in
microseconds’.”

“Is it smoking yet?”

“No.”

. “Hold your lighter under it.”

“It’s still not smoking.”

“Look at that spider crawl out of it.”

“Yahhh! A spider!”

“Quick, Lowcost. Spep on it.”

“Watch out for the triode.”

Squish. Crunch!

“We’ll have to fudge that into the report.”

“So be it.”

“Gasp. Gasp.”

“What are you gasping about, Morma?”

“I grabbed hold of a hot wire and I couldn’t let go
for ﬁve minutes.”

“You smell like fried liver. Really Morma, you must
shower more often.”

“It says here ‘Plot the color of the retrospector as a
function of time as measured in days’.”

“Who makes up these experiments?”

“I heard they hired a guy from political science.”

“Hell, no. They grabbed the best staﬁ writer from a
science ﬁction magazine.”

“I heard that when Youngblood and the big wheels
have their meetings, the questions they can’t ﬁnd an
answer for, they dream up lab experiments on.”

“I think its a direct linear function of who needs what
data for which research contract.”

“Morma, what are you up to?”

“I’m putting the equipment a,-way. We’re d-one, aren’t
we?”

“Get him, Junkowski.”

Splat.

“Damn you, Junkowski. You creamed me on the nose
that time.”

Drip. Drop. Drip. Drop.

“They must have bought a load of them from a
starving professor and now they don’t know What to do
with them.”

“I know what they can do with them..
CENSORED . . . ”

“Ho. Ha. Yuk. Yuk. Snicker. Guffaw. Giggle.”

“Plot that has a function of time measured in
centuries.”

“I think this meter is war surplus.”

“How can you tell?”

“It says right here ‘Property of the Union Army’.”

“'Which one of you toads took down the data?”

“I thought you were.”

“Didn’t you?”

“Give up, we don’t have any data yet.”

“Write that up in the error analysis.”

“What kind of a curve should we stick in for our
graphs this week?”

“I like the pretty one with the big hump in it.”

“Good thinking, that’s easyto draw.”

“Sort of hard to make up data for that curve.”

“Then, l-et’s use the straight line.”

“Okay. But promise we can use the pretty one with
the big hump in it for next week.”

“We promise.”

“Jolly good.”

BANG!!!

“My God, I’ve been shot.”

“What happened to Morma?”

“Fainted. Said someone shot him.”

“I charged u-p the big capacitor and touched the wires
to each of his ears.”

“That is a pretty clever trick, Ju-nkowski. I’ll have
to jot that one down.”

“You got a good head on your shoulders, Junkowski.”

“Get up and stop gooﬁng off, Morma,.”

“Whuzzy??? Whuzzy??? Where am I?”

“The fuse just blew out again.”

“They sure don’t make fuses like they used to. Con-
nect this wire across it.” i

“The report says ‘Derive equations -to ﬁt each curve
that you plotted_’.”

“I think we can ﬁnd a couple of rotty formulas
written in the men’s room upstairs ‘that will ﬁt into this
report.”

“Hand me that wire, please.”

ZAP!

“Mother bear!”

“You -get a shock?”

“I saw my whole life ﬂash by.”
