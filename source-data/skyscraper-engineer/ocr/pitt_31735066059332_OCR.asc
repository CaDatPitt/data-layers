Undergraduate engineers in the Petroleum and
-and Geological Departments came back to school this
fall more convinced than ever that they had chosen
the right type of engineering.

Why mention petroleum and .geological students
and not some other group?

Because theirs is the only department conducting
a program that provides essential experience to com-
plement the theory obtained from text books and lec-
tures. These departments require students to work at
least one summer in the petroleum or natural gas
industry.

Most of the jobs offer the students the opporunity
to observe and participate in drilling operations.
Such a summer job not only helps the engineering
student to understand his courses and to visualize the
situations studied, but also gives him a chance to look
over the petroleum or natural gas industry. He is
then more certain he has made the right decision in

studying petroleum and geological engineering. 0 d i ta r ia l

15: ed five credits which are required and cannot be
lg: earned in any other manner. The departments’ head
lg: Professor H. G. Botset, helps the students obtain their
git summer jobs. '

{gs There are obvious advantages in the plan which
IE! might well be followed by other departments. Not

only would the individual student receive new insights
into his work, but the University of Pittsburgh engin-
eering degree would become more valuable.

Industry should be ready to accept its share of
the program by providing summer work for the stud-
ents. Companies have a chance to look over students
as possible future employees. And, after all, it is in-
dustry that benefits from the four years that the en-
gineering student studies theory.

There are, therefore, two groups who have respon-
sibilities in setting up such a program — the depart-
ments themselves and industry. There are strong
reasons why both should work together for the benefit
of the engineer.

ADVANCED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AT ALLISON HELP§
YOU FIND THE BEST JOB SUITED TO YOUR TRAINING

DIVERSITY of technical skills required
by Allison in the design, development
and production of turbo-jet and turbo-
prop engines oﬂ‘ers a wide range of op-
portunities to young graduate engineers.

And, the Advanced Educational Fa-
cilities help the young graduate ﬁnd the
work best suited to his academic training
and liking.

For instance, there’s Wayne Mclntire
(above) Mechanical Engineer, Purdue
University, who came to Allison upon
graduation in 1950. After completing the
training program, Wayne now is doing
the kind of work he wanted, and is tech-
nically qualiﬁed to handle. He is Project
Engineer, mechanical design of gear
boxes. He is shown making an adjust-
ment on the propeller linkage-control on
the cutaway model of the Allison T56
aircraft engine. This, incidentally, is
America’s ﬁrst production turbo-prop
engine, and is used in the Lockheed C-130
Hercules, a 54-ton transport. The Allison
Model 501, which is the commercial ver-
sion of the military T56, is the powerful
turbo-prop engine proposed for com-
mercial airline use.

10

In his present job, Wayne works on

initial design . . . helps decide what com- ,

ponents—such as propeller brakes,
accessory drives, oil pumps, etc.—are
needed for the speciﬁc project.

The nature of Allison business con-
tinually presents a variety of interesting
and challenging problems to the engi-
neering staff, which—along with the
Mechanical, Aeronautical, Electrical,
Metallurgical, Chemical and Industrial
Engineers—includes majors in Mathe-
matics and Physics.

The Torrington Needle Bearing. ..
many types for many needs

In previous advertisements in this
series, the many advantages of the
Torrington Needle Bearing and the
proper procedure for its installation
and maintenance have been dis-
cussed. The DC unit type bearing
was used in these discussions be-
cause it is the Needle Bearing with
by far the greatest variety of appli-
cations throughout industry.

From the basic Needle Bearing
design, however, many modiﬁca-
tions have been made. The result is
a complete line of Needle Bearings
suitable for speciﬁc applications.
Although these bearings are all
different, each offers the advan-
tages which have made the DC unit
type so popular. They give the
highest possible radial load capac-

ity in a minimum of space; they are
light in weight, easy to install and
simple to lubricate.

The following chart shows many
types of Torrington Needle Bear-
ings, gives their design features and
general applications for which they
are designed.

The new Torrington Needle Bear-
ing catalog will be sent on request.

Microwave Relay System

The enormous strides made during’ recent years
in microwave techniques have established beyond the
great potential value of the higher frequencies in the
extension of telecommunications facilities. Among
communications engineers, it’s almost axiomatic that
the rate at which intelligence may be transmitted
over a given communication system, regardless of
whether it be some form of wire line or radio, is more
or less proportional to the width of the band of fre-
quencies available. The essentials of speech may be
carried over a band only a few hundred cycles wide,
whereas the finer ualities of speech require a band
of several thousan cycles. Continuing on to tele-
vision or multi-channel telephony, the band width
requirements approach several millions of cycles.
Since a band width of several million cycles is com-
parable with the entire band, which until recently,
was generally used for radio, the trend toward the
microwave band became obvious and necessary.

Prior to the war, frequencies in the thirty to
forty megacycle band were being used for short dis-
tance communications, such as local, state police, and
forestry systems. Television and F. M. broadcasting
systems were also intending to use frequencies some-
what higher, and the transmission properties of waves
at frequencies of several thousand megacycles were
being studied by research organizations.

During the war the need for more and more
short distance radio channels caused great strides to
be made in the application of frequencies up to three
hundred megacycles. The development of techniques
and equipment for use in radar and communications
increased the range up to ten thousand megacycles.
A wealth of information was collected regarding trans-
mission properties. Several basic advantages were
realized in the development of the radio relay system
for communcations. Usually some of the most im-
portant items that engineers look for in designing
communications equipment of any kind are stability
of operation, ruggedness, and overall operating econ-
omy.

It was immediately realized that the once great
expense of mapping and surveying land, buying right
-of—way, operating huge earth-moving machinery, and
laying of hundreds of miles of lead-covered cable could
practically be eliminated. The radio relay equipment
was found to be immune to temperature changes
which seriously affect the operation of open, bare
wire, or buried and aerial type cable. This fact alone
saved thousands of dollars which would have had to
been spent on delicate temperamental, temperature-
compensation equipment.

The importance of radio relay systems to the
national welfare was easily seen in that its opera-
tion is hard to affect. Troubles with rodents gnaw-
ing through insulation of cables, or hunters and
pranksters shooting off wire insulators is eliminated
since there is practically nothing vulnerable exposed
to the outside of the stations.

Another important advantage is that high degree of
privacy from eavesdropping or wire-tapping is insured
by the uses of these super high frequencies. The
spraying nature of radio waves makes it ordinarily

OCTOBER. 1955

 

by Robert Seidel, E. E. '56

easier in radio than in wire transmission for eaves-
droppers to listen in on a conversation, unknown to
the subscribers who are talking to each other. This
is particularly true where ‘non-directional antennas
are used; but even in the case where the radio wave
is beamed by a sharply directional antenna, a third
person can conceivably place a receiving antenna in
the beam part way between the legitimate transmit-
ting and receiving antennas; however the use of high-
er microwave frequencies and highly directional an-
tennas do away with the utilization of speech privacy
devices such as are now used in transatlantic radio
circuits.

The basic radio relay system which now provides
coast-to-coast television and telephone service is a
rather complicated network with several limitations.
It consists of a series of radio stations or towers strung
across the country at intervals of twenty to thirty-
five miles. The name “Relay stations” stems from
the fact that a radio signal, composed of thousands
of telephone conversations or several television
programs, is transmitted from one major station and
then relayed from station to station across the entire
country. The use of the relay system is, however,
restricted in some cases, since transmission of the sig-
nals is restricted to “line of sight” due to the extreme-
ly high frequencies employed. The system is de-
signed for a maximum of six channels in each of two
directions, each channel being able to carry a tele-
vision program, or about five thousand phone cir-
cuits. Coaxial cable is usually used to connect studios
when the transmission of the signals is restricted to
“line of sight” due to the extremely high frequencies
employed. The system is designed for a maxium of
six channels in each of two directions, each channel
being able to carry a television program, or about
five thousand phone circuits. Coaxial cable is usually
used to connect studios with the transmitter; however,

EDITOR’S NOTE:

With this issue THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER
salutes Dr. G. R. Fitterer, Dean of the Schools of En-
gineering and Mines on the opening of Engineering
Hall. The student body welcomes these modern
facilities with the hope that in using them we will
be better able to meet our responsibilities as under-
graduate engineers at the University of Pittsburgh.

OCTOBER. 1955

Dean ’s

Page

It seems only fitting that the events in the de-
velopment of the Schools of Engineering and Mines
be reviewed now that Engineering Hall has been
completed.

One cannot deny that many individuals such as
Archemedes, Vitrunius, Frontinus, da Vinci and others
displayed outstanding engineering ability, but formal
engineeering education did not start until about 160
years ago.

It is only fitting that Pittsburgh, engineering
center that it is, should have one of the oldest engin-
eering schools in the world. A search into the origin
of engineering education will reveal that the first
schools to establish formal courses in engineering were:

Ecode des Ponte et Chaussees, France‘ (1747)

Bergahademie, Frieberg, Germany (1766)

Ecole Polytechnique (1794)
U. S. Military Academy, West Point (1802)
Polytechnic Institute, Viena (1815)
Norwich I (1819)
Royal Polytechnic of Berlin (1821)
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1824)
University College, London (1840)
University of Pittsburgh (1846)
Harvard (1848)
University of Michigan (1852)
Yale (1852)

It is not generally known, but as late as 1905,
at Pitt all but six members of the freshman class were
engineers. '

It is difficult to grasp the significance of the
109 year existence of our engineering program here
at Pitt without relating it somewhat as in the follow-
ing table to some other historical events.

-Irnmediately following his graduation
23335; B. S. in Metallurgical Engineer-
§ii):'g.,_ Richard Crowell was recruited by
the. chief metallurgist of U.S. Steel’s
”Cl§\irton works. By 1951 he received
ibis-rthird promotion to Engineer-Op-
erating Practices in the Open Hearth
Division at Clairton. Recently he had
his fifth promotion to his current posi-
 as Assistant Superintendent of
C-‘»l,i1.i.=.*."ton’s Open Hearth Department.

"ll-1i'_s responsibilities now include as-
sisting in co-ordinating all Open
Hearth Operations and incoming ma-
terials as well as improvement of
nigthods.

’ M,r,. Crowell knows from his own ex-
perience that there are . . . “unlimited
opportunities for the young engineer
who will apply himself and accept the
challenge of this great industry.”

U.S. Steel’s well-planned training
programs offer men a chance to work
in varied ﬁelds of engineering. Training
plans of this sort make it possible for
the young graduate to familiarize him-
self with many ﬁelds before devoting
himself to one in particular.

The steel industry today offers a far
more interesting career to men like
Richard Crowell because of its un-
limited possibilities for success.

quire of the practicing engineer, he would be told
that actually in any design problem, the limiting
factors of operation are nearly always imposed by
materials.

Conditions encountered by
Interceptors

After receiving an alert, an interceptor fighter
leaves the runway, which may be at a temperature of
over 100 degrees F., and in a few minutes climbs to
an altitude of 50,000 feet, the operational altitude of
modern bombers. As is shown in Fig. 1. in five to
ten minutes the airplane and its equipment are sub-
jected to a temperature change of from 100 dgrees
F. to 60 degrees F. and to a pressure change of from
29 inches of mercury to about 3.3 inches of mercury.
Unless protected materials would be greatly affected

by this rapid temperature and pressure variation.
Even if the materials did not deform or crack because
of' the temperature differential from their core to
their surface, their electronical values would change.
The resistance of metallic resistors would decrease
and that of carbon resistors would increase. Capaci-
tance, too, would decrease. And although each capac-
itor and resistor might not change greatly, their
cumulative effect might render the equipment inoper-
ative.

Domestic and military
design problems

For equipment designed for the domestic con-
sumer, that is, the home and factory, because operat-
ion is ih a rather narrow temperature range and at
almost constant pressure, materials usually present no
problem. But because military equipment operates
under greatly differing temperature and pressure con-
ditions, the materials used are of major importance.

Military equipment manutactured in the tem-
perate climate of the United States is used all over the
world. Certainly the considerations imposed in the
design of equipment that is to be used in the 60 de-
gree F. temperature of the Arctic and the 100 degree
F. temperature of the tropics can be appreciated. But
an even more dramatic problem is faced in the design
of electronic equipment used in the jet interceptor.

Insulation breakdown at low
pressure altitudes

Due to the low pressure caused by the rarified
atmostphere at 50,000 feet, a major insulation prob-
lem results. At a pressure of 3.3 inches of mercury
the breakdown potential of a given insulation is only
one-fourth of its value at 29 inches of -mercury. Thus,
as is shown in Fig. 2; at 50,000 feet for the same vol-

20

tage protection, four times as much insulation is re-
quired. Besides this electrical problem, a strength of
materials problem results because of ths cold temper-
ature. At 60 degrees F. ordinary plastic and rubber
insulations become brittle and would soon be_ shatter-
ed by the plane’s vibrations. Despite the problems
caused by the rapid vibrations and the extremes of
temperature and pressure, the equipment in the inter-
ceptor must operate if the plane is to perform its job.

Equipment reliability necessary

Testament that the equipment does operate is
seen or heard every day in the skies. For if the control
equipment and the navigational equipment did not
operate, the interceptors would not leave the ground
because they would be useless. The question arises
as to how is the equipment made reliable so that the
plane can be accurately navigated to intercept an un-
known aircraft and if found hostile, so that the fire
control system can operate accurately and dependably.
Just how is the problem caused by operation over
extreme ranges of temperature and pressure and their
rapid variation caused by the highspeed aircraft, met
and solved. The ideal solution would be to have
materials than can undergo the temperature and pres-
sure ch-ange .and still remain constant in their elec-
trical properties. That is the goal toward which de-
signers and researchers should work and are working,
but the interceptors must be in operation today. It
does not seem likely that completely stable materials
will be developed in the near future if, indeed, at
all.

The airborne equipment designer must, then,
work with the materials which he now has. If, of
course, the equipment were not subjected to the
temperature and pressure change, the problem would
no longer exist. Therefore, although the plane must
operate at high altitudes, to prevent change, the tem-

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

SKY HOOK . . .

Here is a hook for a hoist—mankind’s sinew-sparing
servant . . . as industrially indispensable as its load-lifting
applications are limitless.

Hoists lift steel beams for buildings and bridges, raise
and lower drills and casing for deep-driven oil wells, lift a
bucket of cold water from a country well or a ladle of
molten metal in a mill . . . lighten load-lifting chores for
machinists and miners, loggers and longshoremen, farm-
ers and factory workers.

HOW MANY KINDS?

Consider the many kinds of hoists in use today . . . reeved
with rope, cable, chain . . . powered pneumatically, man-
ually, electrically . . . engineered with gears, pulleys,
pistons, ratchets.

Think how many millions of plans, sketches, models
and mock-ups have contributed to their evolution. The
eyes of a myriad of inventors, engineers and draftsmen
have appraised them. The hands of countless pattern-
makers, tool and die makers, machinists and other
craftsmen have shaped them.

Pulling together is a Work method uniquely American.
And, America can work like that because it has an all-
seeing, all-hearing and reporting Inter-Communications
System.

THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM . . .

Complete communication is the function and contribu-
tion of the American business press . . . the industrial,

MECHANICAL ENGINEERS are concerned with
many phases including experimental testing
and development, mechanical design, stress
and vibration analysis, combustion research,
heat transfer and nuclear reactor development.

AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERS work on innumer-
able internal and external airﬂow problems
concerned with design, development and
testing of aircraft powerplants. Some who
specialize in analytical engineering forecast
engine-airplane combinations a decade in
advance of design.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS directly contribute
their specialized skills to the analysis and
development of controls, systems and special
instrumentation. An example is the “Plotte-
mat” which automatically integrates and plots
pressures, temperatures and air angles in
performance testing.

An aircraft powerplant is such a complex machine
that its design and development

require the greatest variety of engineering skills.

Leonardo Da Vinci, famous artist of the fifteenth
century, possessed many talents for which he is not
generally known. He was a noted inventor, scientist,
and engineer. After his death, plans, sketches and
notes on some of his ideas were found.These plans
have been recreated into models exactly as he had
designed them. These pages are a picture story of
this group of models. A close look will reveal DaVinci’s
true genius in perceiving inventions which have only
come into prominence in recent years and were very
far advanced at his time.

PILE DRIVER. A weight, raised by a hink operated wench, was
released automatically when it reached a certain height, drop-
ping upon the wooden stake, driving it into the ground.

FLYING MACHINE. His ﬂying machine consisted of a wooden
frame, two huge wings, a series of ropes, pulleys, and a wind-
lass. Lying prong in the frame, his feet in leather stirrups con-
nected by pulleys to the wings, the flyer was to move his feet
up and down to flap the wings. At the same time he was to
operate the windlass with his arms and guide the machine.

CLOCK MECHANISMS. This mechanism is similar to the one
Leonardo used in his clock in Milan. It contains two independent
weights and escapements; one for minutes and one for hours.

HELICOPTER. Aerial screw, forerunner of modern helicopter. ‘l
Motive power was to be supplied by a spring driven mechanism
that was to operate in the manner of modern clockwork.

SPRING DRIVEN CAR. This is the first known design of a self-

propelled vehicle.

 

VARIABLE SPEED DRIVE. By meshing three cogged wheels of
different diameter with the same lantern wheel, Leonardo ob-
tained diﬁerent speeds of rotation. This idea is found in our
modern automobiles.

Your health will be better since doctors can now use

the voice of the atom

DOCTORS have long wanted to learn more about the
human bloodstream—how it supplies nourishment . . .
defends against disease . . . becomes diseased, itself.

THAT WISH IS REALITY today, because atomic energy
has given a voice to certain of nature’s elements. When
these elements are exposed to the powerful radiation of
splitting atoms, they become radioactive, themselves,
and are called radioisotopes. The radiation they give
off can be detected and heard with special instruments.
Now doctors introduce isotopes of iodine, iron,
sodium, or other elements into the bloodstream. Their
course can then be followed to determine the location
and nature of the trouble. Isotopes are also becoming
increasingly important in actually treating ailments.

ISOTOPES are being used in similar fashion by indus-

Eastern and Western Pennsylvania are joined for
progress through a great modern concrete ribbon, the
Pennsylvania Turnpike. Its every interchange is a
nerve center for fine highways which support an ef-
ficient arterial chain serving the giant industries of
Pennsylvania.

Behind these vital roadways lie some of the most
difficult engineering problems ever encountered.

Among the first steps were topographic, hydro-
graphic and cadastral surveys. Economic studies were

made and eventually preferred routes became fixed.
Traffic studies determined where the greatest volume
of traffic could be handled with the greatest ease.
Special contour maps produced from aerial photo-
graphs showed nearly all topographic objects clearly,
facilitating further study of the terrain as well as
determining the alignment and grade of the proposed
roads.

After the selection of routes, preliminary plans
of action pointed out the relative economy of placing
the Turnpike in several alternate locations. From
these early plans comparative estimates of project
costs were compiled in order to determine the most
expedient location with the greatest traffic volume, at
the lowest, possible cost, for least wear but most safety.

The terrain through Westmoreland, Allegheny
and Beaver Counties made slight revisions necessary
in the layout of the road. Due to shorter ridges and
valleys a maximum of a three per cent grade was
used instead of the two per cent grade on the Phila-
delphia extension. Less than ten per cent of the curves
on the western end exceed a three degree road grade.
Identical curvatures were used at both extensions.

A main problem encountered in the Pittsburgh
area was the need for providing support for the road
bed over the underlying coal veins. Much of this coal
region had been partically or completely mined. In
a few cases where the coal was near the surface, the

The construction of the Turnpike involved the erection of bridges

and elevated roadways as this one crossing the Allegheny River
near the Allegheny Valley Interchange.

   

overburden was removed to the level of the coal.
Then ths coal was removed and the excavated area
backfilled and compacted until it reached the Turn-
pike grade.

At one location the excavating reached a maximum
depth of forty feet for a distance of fifteen hundred
feet.

In other areas in which the coal had been mined,
where the depth was too great for excavating, and
where the surface had not yet settled, the area was
filled with granulated slag through a series of bored
chutes.

Landslides were also a problem. The possibility
of landslides due to the geological formation of the
countryside developed into a difficult engineering
task. In areas where the Turnpike fill-ins were to be
placed on a hillside, a field check was made for pos-
sible slide conditions. If a particularly bad condition
existed, the underlying clay was removed and the ex-
cavation refilled with more stable materials.

The landslides were generally produced by heavy
rains, earth tremors and erosion. Two general types
of slides met in the highway work were involving
earth surface and rock movements. In the matter of
cut slopes, extra depth drains were used. These drains
were placed as deep as eight feet from the top of a
slope to cut off ground water. There have been some
slides in cuts which required removal of a few hund-
red additional yards of slide material.

The choice of concrete for Turnpike construction
evolved from the inspection of hundreds of miles of
Pennsylvania's highways which successfully carry the
burden of huge volumes of traffic never anticipated

Precautions against landslides had to be made in many instances
where cuts were made through the earth and rock.

when the highways were built.

Performance records on a 160 mile Turnpike
section prove the superiority of the chosen concrete.

Exceptionally wet weather during much of the
building of the great road brought out undetected
faulty ground conditions. This proved to be a definite
advantage structurally. At the time of construction
these ground conditions were handled immediately
and properly engineered to guard against future
slides.

V/Vith the completion of the Turnpike the ex-
pression Dream Highway came into existence. To its
developers the Dream Highway meant the ultimate
in modern transportation and convenience, a super
highway that could serve mechanized progress with a
new standard for efficiency.

Stethoscope At Work

An employee of the Westing-
house Electric Corporation is using
an ultrasonic device to inspect the
massive forging from which a tur-
bine generator shaft will be ma-
chined. &)'und waves at the rate of
2,250,000 cycles per second are set
up in the machine, and if the
slightest flaw is detected an “echo”
will indicate its exact location.
Formerly, the only way of deter-
mining the quality was by boring
a hole through the center of the
forging. With this method, it is
possible to easily find holes, slag,
and other inclusions.

Resembling a giant honeycomb,
this 500 ton steel floating caisson
slides into the Ohio River from
launching ways at the Dravo Corp-
oration's Neville Island Shipyard.
The 151 foot long caisson will be
sunk 180 feet into the Mississippi
River at New Orleans to become

Mobile Transformers

The nation’s largest and most
powerful highway transformer is
being readied by Westinghouse for
shipment to the Texas Power and
Light Company in Dallas. It has a
rating of 20,000 kva at 132 kv.
Secondary windings also provide
for 62.7 l<V wye and l2.5 kv delta.
The unit will be cooled by forced
circulation of oil and air. The
transformer will be used in plan-
ned maintenance operations at var-
ious substations in the Power and
Light System. The transformer can
also be moved rapidly to the scene
of an emergency. The unit with
trailer stands 14 feet high, about
35 feet long and nearly 8 feet wide.

RCA’s New Orthophonic High Fidelity Sound

Opens a New World of Music

From Ceylon to Chile, people of the
world can now enjoy a wonderful new
kind of recorded music.

This is made possible by RCA’s de- ‘

velopment of New Orthophonic Sound
that weds the beautiful tone of RCA
Victor records with the superb perform-
ance of new high ﬁdelity “Victrola”
phonographs. Born of RCA’s acoustical
and electronic research, New Ortho-
phonic Sound reproduces a noticeably
wider range of sound frequencies, per-
fectly balanced for musical realism.

The experience and skill behind this
achievement are inherent in all RCA

products and services. And continually,
RCA scientists at the David Sarnoff
Research Center in Princeton, N. J .,
are working toward new thresholds of
“Electronics for Living” — electronics
that make life easier, safer, happier.‘

sometimes it is possible to use a small, scaled-down
radio relay system just to relay the initial broadcast,
such as a football or basketball game, directly to the
major transmitter and from there out on the air.

The transmitting and receiving of adjacent re-
lay stations must be sharply focused, since an error of
one degree or two degrees over a distance of twenty
to thirty-five miles would throw the beam away from
the receiving antenna by thousands of feet.

Alarms and, order circuits, carried over cable
facilities, constantly keep a vigil on an isolated radio
station and as soon as a power failure occurs, or a
small fuse blows, or anything else occurs which might
affect program transmission, an alarm is sent out to
a “control center” where it is decoded, and then a
man is dispatched to cover the trouble and restore
service, since the stations are normally unattended
except for emergency equipment work. There are
relatively few program interruptions since any failure
is immediately checked, and the entire service is
“patched” onto emergency standby coaxial cable fa-
cilities. In the event that a storm causes damage to
the local power company’s lines which ordinarily sup-
ply the station’s power needs, an emergency power
plant’ automatically starts and assumes the load,
thus assuring no long and costly service interrup-
tions will be experienced. There are many engineer-
ing problems that must be considered during the act-
ual station construction. The prospective station site
must be accessible to roads, telephones, and power
facilities. This is probably the biggest problem to
cope with since the stations must necessarily be built
on very high ground such as mountain tops or plat-
eaus where any kind of facilities are hard to build
and maintain.

Only the best grade of materials must be used in
construction, since the station will be subjected to
the most severe weather conditions on top of moun-
tains. Usually, a square, reinforced concrete building
is built where height is not a major problem since
it has been found to be more capable of withstanding
themost abuse. Steel is used on the taller towers and
is fastened in a girder-like construction for maximum
rigidity. The foundation is carefully checked and
filled to prevent settling, since any repairs which

would have to be made at a later date on the foun-
dation would run into great expense due to the fact
that much equipment would probably have to be re-
moved before work could begin. The entire route
must be laid out in such a way so as not to create any
interference from a preceeding station. Due to the
posibility of one station “overshooting its mark”, the
station chain must be staggered with transmission
paths effectively placed across the country. Bodies of
water must also be avoided since serious reflections
bouncing off the flat surfaces might result in heavy‘
loss of received power.

Path loss measurements must be performed to
determine the final orientation of the antennas. Use
is usually made of powerful transmitters and receiv-
ers with which it is possible to measure the slightest
loss in power due to a change in the position of the
test antennas. In this way, the exact height and angle
of each antenna may be found.

Since the radio relay system is a relatively new
medium for communications, there is much room for
improvement and many flaws to be removed. The
biggest improvement in the entire system would prob-
ably be in the design of more dependable high fre-
quency amplifier tubes. Since the vacuum tube was
first designed, it has never been called upon to work
at such high frequencies under such difficult con-
ditions, and therefore it is only natural that the pres-
ent day designs of these tubes are primitive as com-
pared to the expected design of a year from today.
Tolerances are small, and construction is exact; how-
ever, new manufacturing methods are cutting costs
daily. Color television tests are constantly being con-
ducted to insure maximum reliability for complex
color television transmission, and the present results
indicate that the network is ready and waiting to pro-
vide the highest grade of transmission facilities that
are so necessary for optimum cross-country reception.

The microwave radio system is in its infancy,
but if as much is accomplished in its design in the
next ten years as in the last ten years, it would seem
as though the American people will be introduced to
many new comfort and conveniences in the field of
communications which even now are considered to
be remote possibilities.

that engineering student has passed
his crisis.”

Doctor: “How can you tell?”
Nurse: “Well, when I left him he

A Pitt Civil sought medical aid
because he had popped eyes and a

The operation resulted in no

THE SKYSCRAPER

the challenge
ahead

Industry’s demand for lower
costs of manufacture offers a
promising future to the pro-
gressive-minded engineering
graduate.

The machine designer who
knows how to utilize materials
to best advantage will ﬁnd great
demand for his services. That’s
because the cost of material
constitutes a good share of the
ultimate cost of a product.

An eﬂicient machine design is
one that utilizes the fewest
pounds of the least expensive
metal that will give required
service life.

A basic comparison of
materials shows:

1. Steel is 2 to 3 times stronger
than gray iron. Only one-third
the amount of metal is needed
for equal strength in tension.

2. Steel is 21/2 times as rigid as
iron. Only 40% of the amount
of material is needed for equal
rigidity.

3. Pound for pound, steel costs
a third as much as iron.

As a result, when steel is used to
its best advantage, the cost of ma-
terial amounts to approximately
15% of the cost of iron required
for equal rigidity. (40% x 1/3)

The large initial saving in ma-
terial cost provides a wide mar-
gin in which to fabricate the
steel and still realize a substan-
tial savings in overall cost.

to keep abreast of rapid develop-
ments in design may obtain lit-

Pioneer

In simplest possible tenns, there are two basic courses
open to you when you apply your engineering degree in
the business world. . .you can “routineer” or pioneer. As
a routineer you will ﬁll in the details of other men’s
concepts. As a pioneer you will operate on the frontiers
of your chosen ﬁeld——helping originate new concepts.

  
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  

Which course you follow depends largely on the ﬁeld you
select and the company you join.

There is underway today, in business, science, and govern-
ment, a quiet but far—reaching revolution in the automation
ofofﬁce equipment and procedures. The use of electronic
data processing machines—for performing complex scien-
tiﬁc computations . . . for handling huge volumes of business
data—is still in its infancy. For engineers in data
processing, new horizons unfold in endless succession.

IBM’s leadership in the ﬁeld of data processing is due
largely to our reliance on pioneer engineering. Many

years ago IBM deliberately set out to build the kind of
engineering climate. . . the facilities, the freedom, the
associations . . .that would attract and stimulate the pioneer.

If you want to pioneer in a dynamic new ﬁeld, IBM offers
an unusual opportunity to make important and rewarding
contributions.

ELECTRICITY. . .
INDISPENSABLE INGREDIENT
OF PROGRESS

Progress would be forced to take faltering steps without
energy in the tremendous quantities demanded by our
growing population and the industries which serve it.
Low-cost electrical energy—on tap at all times and for
all purposes—has made possible tremendous strides for-
ward in virtually every area of human endeavor.

Unquestionably, the steady, rapid growth of the electric
industry is a basic source of strength which has contributed
to America’s phenomenal progress. Today, that strength is
being increased at a greater rate than ever before. In the
past ten years the electric industry has more than doubled
its capacity to produce. You may expect a further increase
in generating capacity to about 300 million kilowatts in
just 15 more years—up some 200 per cent over 1954-
with all the attendant industrial growth and progress that
this expansion implies. Few other industries have the
intense drive toward technological improvement that typi-
ﬁes the utilities—a drive that has made cheap and abun-
dant electricity possible. In recognizing and shouldering
their responsibility by investing a large share of income,
year after year, in development and expansion, America’s
electric companies are helping to make more and better
products for more and more people. This is progress.

As a major supplier of steam generating equipment for
almost a century, The Babcock 8: Wilcox Company has
constantly worked with the individual electric companies

to further develop low-cost steam-electric power. B&W,
too, is spending large sums on intensive research and
engineering development to assure continuing improve-
ment in steam generating and fuel burning equipment.
This unwillingness to stand pat, to be satisfied with past
accomplishments, is America’s greatest encouragement to
still greater growth and progress. The Babcock & Wilcox

Airborne Equipment

Continued from page 30

level, they are sealed. If no air escapes when the air-
craft reaches 50,000 feet, the pressure against the e-
lectronic components will remain the same at ground
level. Therefore, normal insulation is satisfactory.

Separating the plug-in compartments are baffle
plates which act as “radiators” for the air condition-
ing system. These are shown in Fig. 4. By using the
radiator principle to remove the heat dissipated by
the electronic components, no air is transferred from
the pressurized compartment itself so that the air
coolant can be circulated at low absolute pressure.
The air coolant is circulated by an equipment blower
at altitudes up to 50,000 feet and by ram air of en-
gine-bleed air above 50,000 feet. It has been found
that a flow of five pounds per minute of air coolant
of temperature somewhat higher than 100 degrees
C. is sufficient to maintain the internal atmosphere
of the compartments at or below 125 degrees C.. Be-
cause of the high operation temperature, class H. in-
sulating matrials are used throughout. With the air
conditioning, carbon type resistors can be used except
in the computer and regulated a. c. voltage units
where higher precision metallic resistors are required.
Mostly to make them more shockproof, the capacitors
have glass dielectrics and are glass encapsulated, while
the inductors are set in ceramics.

Conclusion

Pressurization and air condtioning have made
possible the operation of electronic equipment in to-
day’s high altitude, highspeed aircraft. B-y using up

42

to—date materials that can stand the rather nigh tem-
perature of 125 degrees C., the air conditioning equip-
ment is held to a minimum which, even so, along with
the pressurization equipment, makes up sixty per cent
of the radar equipment weight. But as aircraft oper-
ating altitudes are constantly increasing, as are the
experimental and drawing board models, the per-
centage of pressurization and air conditioning is also
increasing. So, though it may seem that the problem
has been temporarily solved, the airborne electronics
equipment designer is ever faced with trying to re-
duce the weight of pressurization and air conditioning
equipment by using newly developed materials that
are more stable and can stand higher temperatures.

How to keep cutters aligned on
high-speed coil slitter

Company engineers had the problem
of keeping the cutters on this Stamco
Coil Slitter operating accurately at
high speeds. It meant keeping them in
rigid, positive alignment. To take the
heavy combination of radial and thrust
loads required, they speciﬁed mount-
ing the cutter arbors on Timken®
tapered roller bearings.

 

O Tapered design lets
1'imken® bearings take both
radial and thrust loads

Because of their tapered design, Timken bearings can
take radial or thrust loads or any combination. And
because the load is carried along a full line of contact
between rollers and races, Timken bearings have extra
load-carrying capacity.

Lockheed Aerodynamics Proiects
Offer Advanced Problems

Additional information on these problems

and data on Lockheed’s Aerodynamics Division
is available to interested engineers.

Address inquiries to R. R. Heppe.

OCTOBER. 1955

Aerodynamics Engineers at Lockheed are working on advanced prob-
lems that cover virtually every phase of aircraft". The full scope of
their work can be seen in the wide range of aerodynamics problems
encountered in Lockheed’s diversiﬁed development program.

Among the advanced problems are:

1 Determine means of controlling a supersonic vertical rising aircraft
through the transition ﬂight stages from horizontal to vertical ﬂight.

Determine the dynamic response of supersonic aircraft in high rate
rolls by application of ﬁve degrees of freedom analysis procedures.

3 Study optimum operating descent procedures to minimize costs on
a new turboprop commercial aircraft.
4

Conduct and analyze wind tunnel research on new and radically
different external radomes to be carried at high speed by early
warning aircraft.

5 Perform generalized aeroelastic analysis combining structural and
aerodynamic knowledge to determine optimum lateral control de-
vices for use on very high speed, low load factor aircraft.

These—and many other—signiﬁcant problems have created new posi-
tions for experienced Aerodynamics Engineers and Aerodynamicists
in Lockheed’s expanding program of diversiﬁed development.

A WHIRLPOOL SPIRALS into the inlet of a model pump. This unique picture shows
how air, a common cause of pumping trouble, was carried into the pump in . . .

The Case

Some time ago, the report reached us that two
Worthington vertical turbine pumps installed by one
of our customers weren’t working right. They deliv-
ered plenty of water, but vibrated badly and burned
out bearings.

The customer asked us to ﬁnd the trouble fast.
After checking we knew the pumps were okay, so
Worthington Research had to answer him.

First thing we did was build a one~tenth scale
model of the customer’s installation. The photo
shows what happened when we started pumping.

A whirlpool immediately formed between the water
surface and the pump inlet. Air, trapped in the whirl-
pool and carried into the pump, was the villain in
the case.

 

 the Baffled Whirlpool

The solution came with experimentation. A simple
baﬂle arrangement in a side channel eliminated the
whirlpool—and the trouble-making air.

Chasing the gremlins from pump installations like
this, boosting the efficiency of heat transfer in air
conditioners, developing better seals for pumps and
compressors—these are all in the day’s work for
Worthington’s busy research engineers. At Worth-
ington, research ranks right alongside engineering,
production, and sales to develop better products for
all industry.

COLUMBIA-SOUTHERN...for men who want to grow!

To a young man looking for oppor-
tunities, perhaps the most important
fact about a company is its rate of
growth, present and prospective. In a
company which has become static,
advancement is largely dependent on
vacancies occurring through death or
retirement. In a growing company, new
openings for able men are being created
constantly, and advancement is
commensurate with ability.

Since 1925 the chemical industry
has grown at an average rate of about
10% a year, compared to 3% for all
industry. Future growth, at a more
rapid rate than the rest of industry, is
predicted by authoritative studies.

Columbia-Southern is growing not

OCTOBER. I955

only in response to increasing demand
for its present products, but also as a
result of the steady development of
new products. The company’s man-
agement ﬁrmly believes in the impor-

tance of research and development and

has given evidence of that belief by
expanding research facilities and in-
creasing research and development
budgets.

Columbia-Southetn’s growth is an
open-end process; as goals are reached,
new goals are set. Even now new
products and processes are in every
stage of evolution, from nebulous ideas
in the minds of research chemists to

pilot plant operations and production
‘plant designs. That's why Columbia-

 

Southern needs men who can grow
with it.
