For centuries the moon has been
used as a symbol of man’s greatest
desire—of his never—ending quest for
What he does not, or cannot have. But
as a symbol of something that could
be dreamed of but never achieved the
moon has outworn its usefulness, and
will have to give place to something
farther away or more diﬂicult to reach.
Victory in the conquest of our natural
satellite is so near to attainment, so
surely within our grasp, that the moon
is about to lose its allure, be stripped
of sentiment and yield its mystery.

The capitulation is not as of tomor-
row, nor did the conquest begin
yesterday. Nor will it be accompilshed
without diﬂiculty. It really started
with the launching of artiﬁcial satel-
lites in 1957, and the campaign has
been carefully planned. There are
ﬁve phases of activity, involving three
(or more) types of spacecraft. Ranger
began it in 1962, a space traveler de-
signed to Contact the moon and obtain
better pictures than the best tele-
scopic photos from earth. Rangers
have contacted the moon, and
Ranger 7, before its impact on the
moon, transmitted over 4,000 views of
the lunar surface, a great many at
close range, revealing features never
before seen by the human eye.

A determination of the moon’s
physical properties is yet to be made,
and this, selenographic exploration, is
the objective of the second sphere of

activity, of Vital importance for the
three later phases, which involve the
Apollo manned spacecraft in three
operations: around the moon, 1967;
orbiting the moon, 1968; landing on
the moon, 1969. The astronauts who
will travel in the Apollo need much
information concerning the moon
before they set out on man’s greatest
expedition. Are smooth landing sites
available? Is the surface rock-hard or
covered with soft dust? Will micro-
meteoritic impacts create a hazardous
shower of surface particles? To
answer these and many other ques-
tions, somebody must go to the moon,
either in person or by proxy.

This will be SURVEYOR, starting in
1965.

By Way of basic facts concerning
SURVEYOR, the program is directed by
Caltech’s "Jet Propulsion Laboratory
for NASA. Hughes Aircraft Company
is responsible for developing the
spacecraft and its associated ground
equipment, and for participating in
the conduct of the mission operations.
The boost vehicle is Atlas/Centaur,
provided byGeneral Dynamics, Astro-
nautics Division, with Centaur de-
velopment under the cognizance of the
NASA Lewis Research Center. Many
other contributors participate in this
complex program.

Designwise, SURVEYOR is to be a
“basic bus” capable of soft-landing a
variety of payloads—a prime differ-

ence from Ranger, which was designed
only for hard landing. In the earlier
missions, it will carry engineering in-
struments to evaluate both spacecraft
performance and landing characteris-
tics and a television camera which
should secure more detailed pictures
than the amazing Ranger—of the im-
mediate area in which it lands. In
later missions, the payload will consist
primarily of scientiﬁcinstruments to
determine lunar surface properties.
Other uses for the basic spacecraft
have been studied and it is possible
that it may be used to carry a second-
ary Vehicle with lunar mobility, or
may be used for many types of mis-
sions in support of manned lunar
operations.

For physical details, the spacecraft
weighs approximately 2,150 pounds,
stands about 10 feet high and within a
circle about 14 feet across. It has a
triangular frame with a landing leg on
each of the three corners. A solid-
propellant retro rocket engine ﬁts
within the center cavity of the frame
and supplies the main thrust for slow-
down on approach to the moon. A
planar antenna and solar cell panel are
mounted on a vertical mast at the top
of the spacecraft. The telecommunica-
tions, ﬂight control, and power supply
units, as well as the payload items, are
mounted in numerous packages around
the frame to meet balance and operat-
ing requirements. The spacecraft has

no need to be streamlined, because it
is enclosed Within a conical shroud at
the top of the Centaur until it has left
the earth’s atmosphere.

As designed, control of the space-
craft, both during the three-day trip
and post-landing operations, is from
the earth, though certain landing
operations are pre-programmed. Com-
mands to the spacecraft are sent and
data received by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory’s Deep Space Network
which will have stations in California,
Australia, South Africa and Spain so
that line-of-sight communications
with the craft are possible at all times.
Command and data handling consoles
used at each station are Hughes-
developed. Central control of a mis-
sion is maintained at the JPL Space
Flight Operations Facility in
Pasadena.

SURVEYOR development is well ad-
vanced. From the outset, materials
have been rigidly tested to ensure the

high reliability demanded by the pro-
gram. Sub-systems have been given
comprehensive tests under operational
and environmental conditions. A com-
plete spacecraft is now receiving sys-
tem, environmental, and mission
simulation tests. A full—scale model
has been dropped at various velocities
on surfaces with various slopes and
surface characteristics to prove out
the landing system. A simpliﬁed
spacecraft with the Vernier propulsion
and radar systems used in terminal
descent has been tested, ﬁrst while
tethered from a tower, then in free
descent in 1,200—foot drops from a bal-
loon, simulating the ﬁnal descent to
the lunar surface. The spacecraft will
face its big moment when the ﬂight
model with all systems in “go” condi-
tion, nestles at the top of the giant
Atlas/Centaur on the launch pad at
Cape Kennedy.

The sequence of events, after the
great booster screams aloft and hurls
SURVEYOR into space moonward, is
both stirring and impressive. Within

minutes after launch, when the space-
craft has emerged from the earth’s
atmosphere, the enclosing Centaur
shroud is ejected. At the end of boost
the spacecraft’s legs and its two omni-
directional antennas are extended, and
radio signals are transmitted to facili-
tate tracking. The spacecraft then
separates from Centaur and coasts
along a trajectory that would take it
to the near vicinity of the moon.
During coast periods the spacecraft
is maintained in a ﬁxed attitude in
space. The ﬁxed attitude provides 1)
optimum illumination of the solar
panel for battery charging, Q) opti-
mum utilization of the spacecraft
temperature control provisions, and
3) a reference attitude from which to
orient the spacecraft for the midcourse
and terminal descent maneuvers. The
sun and the star Canopus are the two
attitude references. The sun is ac-
quired initially by a secondary (broad
ﬁeld—of-view) sun sensor on the solar
panel and then by the primary sun
sensor. With its vertical axis pointed

toward the sun, the spacecraft is rolled
until the Canopus sensor acquires the
star. Spacecraft rotation is com-
manded from the ground during ac-
quisition of the sun and star. There-
after, attitude control is automatic in
response to error signals from the sun
and Canopus sensors. The small thrust
for attitude control is supplied by
nitrogen jets mounted on each landing
leg.

A midcourse maneuver is performed
about 15 hours after launch. The
spacecraft is reoriented under ground
command and a liquid-propellant ver-
nier propulsion system with three
thrust chambers supplies the required
velocity correction to land SURVEYOR
at the desired spot on the moon. The
sun and Canopus are then required
for the second coast period.

When the spacecraft is about 1,000
miles from the moon, it is rotated on
command from earth so that the retro
thrust line is in the direction of travel.
The downward-looking television
camera is operated at this time to

to start both the Vernier propulsion
system and the main retro engine.
The three Vernier engines have Varia-
ble thrust and control spacecraft atti-

During retro burning, velocity is re-

second as the spacecraft descends to

engine is ejected after burnout.

In the next phase of descent, the
Vernier system slows the spacecraft
and controls its attitude in response
to a radar altimeter and a three-beam
doppler velocity sensor. At about 13
feet above the surface, with speed re-
duecd to about 5 feet per second, the
Vernier system is shut off and the
spacecraft drops to the surface. The

Commands from earth are decoded
in the spacecraft to activate the Vari-
ous operating mechanisms. Similarly,
signals from the engineering and
scientiﬁc instruments are processed
and transmitted to earth. Two sets of
receivers and transmitters are used to
assure reliable communications.
SURVEYOR television cameras are
equipped with mirrors that are
stepped in elevation and azimuth to
provide a picture map of the lunar
landscape; variable—focus lenses are
used, and camera operation with
colored ﬁlters supplies the data for
construction of color pictures. The
more sensitive electronic equipment
on the spacecraft is in special com-
partments to protect it from the ex-

treme lunar temperatures (-4- 260
degrees to — 245 degrees Fahrenheit) .
The insulated compartments employ
electric heaters and thermal switches
that open and close conduction paths
to the outside of the compartments.
The craft is designed to operate for
30 earth-days (one moon-day) or
more. At the end of its life it will
simply remain as a landmark for
human explorers.

At this minus—one-year point in the
spacecraft readiness countdown, the
prototype spacecraft has received a
large portion of its system tests. Later
tests will include combined system
testing of the spacecraft in conjunc-
tion with the boost vehicle. Assembly
of the ﬁrst ﬂight spacecraft is under
way. Events are pointing toward the
exciting day when SURVEYOR itself will
announce that the ﬁrst soft—landing
on the moon has been achieved.

TEXAS   TOWER
DEMOLITION

. . . . an exercise in inginuity 

By Walter R. Arnheim

Many of today’s mass produced engineers can solve

only the “plug in and grind out” problems. Without

old, time tested equations as crutches, these engineers

quickly fall down. This is not true of the Lipsett
Company’s W. H. Hoffmann.

One of the most unique demolition
jobs in history was completely off the
coast of Massachusetts, where the
Lipsett Division of Luria Brothers &
Co., Inc., removed the last of the
famous Texas Tower radar stations
which once guarded the coast of the
United States against sneak air
attacks.

Erected from 1955 to 1957, these
giant radar stations got their Texas
Tower nickname because of their re-
semblance to the off-shore drilling rigs
used in the Gulf of Mexico. The mili-
tary versions differed from their com-
mercial cousins in that they were
intended to be permanent stations,
ﬁxed in place on huge tubular legs
which had been jacked down to the
ocean ﬂoor, raising the two-story plat-
forms more than eighty feet above
the water. While occupied by the mili-
tary, the towers had been supervised
by the North American Aid Defense
Command, and crews of as many as
105 men staffed each platform.

Of the three towers originally built,
only two remained when the U. S. Air
Force abandoned them in June of
1963. One platform tragically col-
lapsed killing 28 men during a severe
Atlantic winter storm in January,
1961. The second was dismantled and
sunk.

Texas Tower 3 was erected 30 miles
off the coast of Nantucket Island,
standing in 82 feet of water and rising
a lofty 87 feet above the surface. The
tower weighed 2,400 tons after the Air
Force had removed the electronic gear.
Working with the speciﬁcation that
the tower either be sunk in more than
100 fathoms (600 feet) of water or be
brought to shore, the Army Corps of
Engineers asked various demolition
ﬁrms to submit bids. These ranged
from a high of more than $5 million
to Lipsett’s low bid of $1.6 million.
The next lowest bid was more than
$1 million higher, but this wide vari-
ance was to be expected, since nobody
had ever handled a job like this
before.

Lipsett placed the veteran ship
demolition expert W. H. Hoffmann in
charge of the Texas Tower project.
Hofmann previously had supervised
the dismantling of the liners Nor-
mandie and Liberte, the battleships
New Mexico, Iowa and Wyoming, and
the aircraft carrier Enterprise. Un-
fased by his unusual assignment,
Hoffmann said, “Did anybody ever
take Normandie or Liberte apart
before we got them?”

Despite his varied experience, he
found himself facing problems on this
project to which the answers had to

be unique. In late fall, 1963, Hoffmann
decided the solution was to use ure-
thane foam to ﬂoat the platform of
Tower 3.

The' Poly Systems Division of
Dauco Corporation, which was the
successful bidder on the urethane ap-
plication project recommended a
1.6 lb. per cubic foot, high strength,
closed cell, ﬁre retardent foam to
satisfy the speciﬁed requirements of
structural strength and high resist-
ance to moisture penetration at the
lowest economical cost. Urethane
foam poured in place “blows”. to an
essentially homogenous mass which
completely ﬁills all the space, leaving
no voids. It also has good adhesion to
the surface so that it contributes
greatly to the strength of the struc-
ture and effectively displaces an
equivalent volume of water which
might otherwise leak in and ﬁll the
compartments.

Men boarded Tower 3 in May, 1964,
to complete the job of removing all
the structural members, equipment,
etc., that could be taken off the plat-
form. Some 800 tons of machinery
and steel were removed by the time
the platform was ready to be toppled
from its legs. The remainder weighed
1600 tons.

strength of an electro-magnet weighing 20

Laboratory demonstration shows how
urethane foam expands. This is the way
the foaming was done on the Texas
Tower.

Liquid chemicals are combined and
poured . . .

into a given. space. Foam begins to
expand almost immediately . . ' .

urethane foam were brought in 55 gal-
lon drums to the tower, where mixing
and mertering equipment was set up.
The urethane foam formulations were
developed by PolySystems utilizing
basic resin and isocyanate materials.
Approximately four days of round the
clock operations were required to ﬁll
140,000 cubic feet in the entire utility
deck space with a portable pouring
head that dispensed from 100 to 120
cubic feet of urethane foam per min-
ute. The foam, which reacted and set
in a few minutes, was poured progres-
sively from the second deck through
56 openings which were burned in the
deck. The openings were subsequently
sealed with welded plates.

With the pouring operations com-
pleted, workmen dismantled other
parts of the tower’s superstructure.
Preparations for the destruction of
Texas Tower 3 involved separating
the platform from the legs. After ex-
plosives were sealed in place at the
base of each hollow leg, workmen used
acetylene torches to burn away the
supports around each leg, leaving
enough metal for a safety factor. l\’Iy
deliberately weaking the legs, the
shearing of the legs from the base of
the platform was accomplished with a
relatively small amount (10 tons) of
high explosives.

Each leg consisted of an outer steel
tube 14 feet in diameter with 2'/2 feet
of concrete encased between the outer
tube and an inner steel liner. The legs
were buried 45 feet into the ocean
ﬂoor, and raised the platform top to
a height of 87 feet above the water,
which was 82 feet deep at this point.
Center-to-center distance between the
legs or cassions, was 139 feet.

Special shaped dynamite charges
were attached to the legs, while heavy
charges were planted below the ocean
floor, inside the three legs. One leg’s
charges were exploded a half-second
before the other two causing the plat-
form to tilt by dropping the apex
eight feet before the other two charges
were set off.

Hoﬂ’mann calculated that the tides
restricted the demolition time to very
narrow margins (a little more than an
hour per day) . If the demolition can-
not be accomplished on one of three
days, the job must be postponed two

and in less than forty seconds has
greatly increased in volume. Foam
continues to rise . . .

until it overﬂows the breaker. Foam is
slightly tacky at this point but quickly
cures into lightweight, rigid urethane
foam.

Weeks before the tidal pattern favors
the plan again. The direction of the
platforms fall was critical because of
surrounding shoals and the fact that
the steel structure should ride with
the tide and not against it at the
time of its fall. The planned compass
heading was 210°.

The primary function performed by
the urethane foam was one of struc-
tural support. Obviously, the tower’s
platform was not designed to be
launched from the heights on which it
was perched. In essence, the entire
utility deck served as a form ﬁlled
with rigid urethane material, backing
up the steel plates to resist the forces
exerted against the platform’s “skin”
by the fall into the ocean.

Although the platform was ﬂoated

' into position and jacked above the

water, the process could not be re-
versed because the legs had been pile-
driven into the ocean ﬂoor and the
jacks discarded. The only way of re-
ﬂoating the platform wos to detach it
from the cassions, and the Hoffmann
plan resulted in a minimum exposure
of the bulkheads to stress.

Prepare now for your future in highway
engineering. ..get the facts on The Asphalt
lnstitute’s new computer-derived method

However, as a precaution should a
bulkhead fail, the urethane would per-
form a second function. By displacing
space which incoming sea Water would
otherwise occupy, the urethane foam’s
1.6 lbs. per cubic foot density would
provide buoyancy for 62.4 lbs. of steel,
since the density of salt water is
64.0 lbs. per cubic foot. This ﬂoata-
tion capacity would support more
than nine million pounds of steel . . .
over twice as much as the platform
weighed. Because of its design and
the protection offered by the urethane
foam, the twenty foot high, two deck
platform drew only four feet of water.

On August 6, 1964, Texas Tower 3
toppled from its lofty perch with a
wave shattering roar. Falling in a
cloud of smoke and steam it slammed
87 feet into the Atlantic Ocean. When
the air cleared, the 1600 ton tower
was ﬂoating high on the gentle ocean
swells, buoyed by more than 140,000
cubic feet of lightweight urethane
foam. Tow lines had already been
secured and the two deck triangular
shaped structure was being towed by
two 1600 HP. ocean going tugboats

to the Kearney, N. J. docks. Two and
one half days later the tower was
safely in port bringing to a successful
close one of the most unique salvage
operations in recent times.

postscript

Final plans for the disposition of
the structure have not been, com-
pleted. However, it is expected the
platform will be reﬁtted as a ﬂoating
dock, equipped with a light machine
shop in the upper deck area. The ure-
thane foam would be allowed to re-
main in place as ﬂoatation insurance.
The whole thing would be sold to an
appropriate customer.

As an alternate plan, the Lipsett
Division would peel the steel skin
from the structure, selling it as scrap.
The exposed and cured urethane foam
mass would be cut up into blocks.
Where necessary, the blocks would be
framed with lightweight metal chan-
nels to provide support and ﬁnish
them off (as for catwalks, etc.) . These
blocks could be sold to marinas, ship-
yards, etc., or wherever ﬂoatation
material is needed.

—some practical
considerations

Tower theory.

Are engineering students who plan
to work in industry being short-
changed? This noted engineering
educator thinks they are. He calls
for greater emphasis on practical
subjects, such as manufacturing

processes, less emphasis on Ivory

American industrial progress de-
pends on its engineers, particularly
those engineers who have an under-
standing of practical design, manufac-
turing and manufacturing manage-
ment. Without such engineers,
manufacturing plants could not
operate.

Despite this fact, most engineering
college curricula are devoted to theory
rather than to practice, and to the
science rather than the art of engi-
neering—a state of affairs that ham-
pers long-range industrial growth.

22

Need» for Revised Curricula

While theoretical studies are vital
to fundamental research, most grad-
uate engineers work in industry,
where they are primarily concerned
with practical problems. Unfortu-
nately, most engineering school cur-
ricula do not prepare students
adequately for industrial assignments.
If the gap between What is taught in
engineering schools and what is prac-
ticed by industry continues to widen,
industry may have to expand its own
educational programs.

Fortunately, many people have
become deeply concerned with the
widening gap between industry and
education. One distinguished educa-
tor, President J. C. Warner of Car-
negie Institute of Technology, recently
stated that American universities
“ . must make a greater effort to
match up the interests of their schol-
ars with the needs of the Nation, so
that more of our scholars, while pur-
suing their legitimate interests, can
make a greater contribution to
national (industrial) objectives.”

The Goals of Engineering Education
committee of the American Society
for Engineering Education is working
on this problem. This committee is
currently studying engineering educa-
tion with a View toward the develop-
ment of more realistic undergraduate
and graduate engineering curricula.
Signiﬁcantly, the committee is obtain-
ing data from engineers and execu-
tives who work in industry, as well as
from engineering educators.

department of mechanics at the Air

Force Academy, is serving as assist-
ant director of the Goals study. In
this capacity, he has visited more
than 50 engineering schools.

He ﬁnds that many engineering
educators feel that engineering educa-
tion has moved too far towards an

abstract, theoretical approach and too

far from the needs of professional
practice. Too few faculty members
have recent industrial experience.
And, perhaps as a consequence, engi-
neering design and operations, and the
economic and time factors so impor-
tant in engineering work, are not
being emphasized as they‘ should be.

Col. Higdon believes, on the basis
of his visits to engineering schools,
that about 920 percent of engineering
graduates should be unusually strong
in the abstract, theoretical and scien-
tiﬁc aspects of engineering, in order to
perform research and development
work. The great majority of engineer-
ing graduates, he feels, should be
well-versed in engineering design,
production processes and other applied
phases of engineering.

Educators .and industry alike are
awaitingthe ﬁnal report of the Goals
committee, which should strongly in-
ﬂuence the direction of engineering
education for years to come.

Ford Foundation has established a
program that may help to close the
gap between industry and education.
The foundation has set aside $300,000

to enable 60 young engineering profes-
sors to spend approximately one year.

on leave from teaching, as salaried
employees in industry.

These residencies in engineering
practice are designed to provide clini-
cal practice for engineering faculty
members. It is hoped that these
young teachers will become more
aware of manufacturing, marketing,
ﬁnancing and other considerations
that inﬂuence engineering decisions in
practice.

Need for Continuing Education

One of the greatest challenges con-
fronting industry and education today
is the problem of upgrading and up-
dating the professional knowledge of
engineers. This continuing education
books and periodicals to post-doctoral
may range from the study of text-
graduate courses. The need for “re—
educating the educated” is drama-
tized by the fact that engineering
students who graduate only 10 years
ago received little, if any, instruction
in the fundamentals of semiconduc-
tors, feedback control, process
development, information theory,

computer technology, radioisotopes,
numerical control of machine tools,
probability theory, realiability, or in
many other aspects of modern
engineering.

The professional man in any ﬁeld.
whether it be engineering, science, or
management must, of course, assume
the ultimate responsibility for his own
professional growth and development.
But industry and education have a
responsibility to work together to en-
hancc the individual’s opportunities
for self-development.

Solving the Problem

There is some question as to whether
or not engineering schools are doing
all that they should be doing in this
ﬁeld of continuing education. Paul
H. Sheats, dean of university exten-
sion at the University of California,
recently made the following state-
ments to the American Council on
Education: V

Institutions of higher learning are

not now carrying their share of

responsibility for the preparation
and continuing education of that
part of the work force engaged in
technical and professional work.

The evasion of responsibility is

especially serious with respect to

continuing education. We can ex-

INDUSTRY-EDUCATION GAP. Industry is concerned with practice; education with theory. Both are
important to engineers, and both industry leaders and educators are working to bridge the gap.

CONTINUING EDUCA-
TION. The individual
engineer has to keep
studying throughout his
professional life to keep
abreast of developments

in his ﬁeld.

pect no other result in View of the
low priority attached to university
extension in most colleges and uni-
versities, the preoccupation and
concern With the educational needs
of college-age youth, the failure to
provide adequate budgets and
policy direction for the more rapid
dissemination and application of
new knowledge . . .

The seriousness of the need for
more rapid dissemination of new
knowledge is not likely to stir much
in the way of protest. Controversy
does arise at the point of deciding
on what part of the total task the
colleges and universities should as-
sume. There is a notable but per-
haps typical lack of clear deﬁnition
of institutional responsibility for
occupational and technical educa-
tion. Clariﬁcation as to the respec-
tive roles of public and private
institutions is needed. Better artic-
ulation between secondary and
post-high school programs is called

for. Differentiation between appro-
priate community college functions
and those of the four-year institu-
tion and the graduate school is re-
quired if educational services are
going to meet manpower needs.
These problems can be resolved,
but not within the atmosphere of
intellectual snobbishness that char-
acterizes so much of the academic
community when. it is asked to
face up to its responsibilities in
educating people for work.

On the positive side, an increasing
number of evening and Saturday
morning courses in technical and
management subjects are being offered
by institutions of higher learning.
From the point of view of partici-
pants, the primary objective of such a
program of study should be what is
gained from each course rather than
merely obtaining a degree.

Another extremely important means
of obtaining up-to—date information
and training in a given ﬁeld is through

special noncredit courses, which have
been designed for a speciﬁc purpose.
Many business organizations provide
courses of this kind, geared to the
objectives, policies, and problems of
their respective organizations. For
example, about 25,000 GM employees
participate each year in management
training and specialized technical pro-
grams offered by the General Motors
Institute.

Engineering societies such as
ASTME and ASME are giving their
members many opportunities to keep
their professional knowledge current
through meetings, expositions and the
like.

The tremendous team effort required
to keep our economy growing will
surely need the greatest posibile effort
in manpower and resources from both
industry and education to meet the
challenge of the future. Closing the
industry—education gap will mean that
that growth is assured.

Manufacturing engineers act as
catalysts in today’s industry,
tr-anslating the exacting concepts
of the product designer into real-
ity. With the rapid development
of new technology, the education
of manufacturing engineers
takes on new importance.

By W. B. Bruce

Director of Operations
General Dynamics/Convair

San Diego, Calif.

Sixty years have passed since the
invention of the airplane. Since that
time, profound technological changes
have taken place——changes that have
had immediate and even violent
effects on the lives of every human
being on earth.

Advances in technology have pre-
sented unparalleled challenges to in-
dustry and have uprooted many tra-

ditional relationships and ways of
doing things. Science and industry
are no longer separate entities. Today
they work together toward common
goals.

This has forced management to be-
come increasingly aware of the need
for a link between the engineers and
scientists who design a product and
those who build it. At one time the

product designer could give a blue-
print to the shop foreman and say,
“Here it is. Build it.” Today the
foreman is apt to answer, “Of what?
And how do I do it?”

Management has attempted to
bridge this gap—-to forgo the missing
link in the chain——with the concept of
manufacturing engineering. Manufac-
turing engineering, which combines a

25

number of related but previously dis-
crete functions under one manager, is
probably the most dynamic organiza-
tional approach in industry today.

Brieﬂy, these functions are tool en-
gineering, tool manufacturing, opera-
tional planning, manufacturing
methods, manufacturing layout,
manufacturing performance, facilities
control, plant engineering, and manu-
facturing research and development.

All of these functions have a com-
mon denominator—they are related
to the development, implementation,
reﬁnement and control of the manu-

26

facturing plan for a product. Some

typical responsibilities of manufactur-

ing engineers are to:

0 Develop the manufacturing plan for
each product so that it can be made
with a minimum of time, labor and
materials.

0 Interpret product-designs to the
shop, and inform product designers
of shop limitations and capabilities.

0 Coordinate manufacturing projects
so that products are delivered on
schedule and within costs.

0 Exploit new processes, materials
and methods that lead to lower

with yesterday’s produc-
tion concepts.

costs and a better product.

0 Provide and allocate facilities so
that the company maintains a
competitive advantage.

In all of these activities a lesson
gained from the past must be kept in
mind: the most fundamental aspect
of the future will be change. The de-
mands of advancing technology and
the pressure of competition will see to
this. An important question then, is
how can management meet the chal-
lenges of change? How can it make
sound decisions when today’s hard
facts may be rendered obsolete by

tomorrow morning’s new scientiﬁc dis-
covery or technological advance?

In such an era, the greatest asset
of a company is not its facilities—it is
the knowledge and capabilities of its
professional people. In the ﬁnal anal-
ysis, this is what a company has to
offer its customers. Without skilled
engineers—engineers who can meet
the challenge of change—a company
cannot expect to remain in business
for long. And those engineering skills
must be kept up to date. Some engi-
neers, in order to keep up with scien-
tiﬁc advances, may have to prepare
for as many as ﬁve different careers
in their lifetimes. It is especially im-
portant that the manufacturing engi-
neer—the catalyst of modern industry
—keep pace.

Peter B. Kyne once said, “Manage-
ment’s greatest responsibility is the
building of people.” This is more true
than ever in the era of change. To
keep their companies competitive,
managements must see to it that their
manufacturing engineers prepare for
swiftly developing new technology.
They must spark the desire of engi-
neers to learn, to improve their skills
and talents, and to think creatively.

There is no doubt that the achieve
ments of industry have been impres-
sive during the past few years. It has
learned to cope with the demands for
a host of new products, from televi-
sion sets to space ships. It also goes
without saying that much of this
achievement—at least in manufactur-
ing — has been a bootstrap effort.
Much of the credit for this success is
due to manufacturing engineers.

Despite the success of bootstrap
efforts to keep manufacturing technol-
ogy in step with changing product
designs, it must be admitted that
these efforts have been handicapped
by the lack of manufacturing engi-
neering education, both on the job
and off the job. Most manufacturing
engineers today have had to learn
through experience, rather than
through formal education. Few engi-
neering schools include more than a
smattering of manufacturing engineer-
ing subjects in their curricula. The
average graduate mechanical engineer
knows little about tool design and
other “how’s” of manufacturing. A
graduate metallurgical engineer has

EARLY START. The engineering colleges, with few
exceptions, are not giving students opportunities to
learn about manufacturing technology. One approach
recommended by the author is to have each mechan-
ical engineering student design and manufacture one
product. This will make him a better engineer.

little knowledge of welding.

A classical engineering education is
no longer sufficient to prepare a man
for assignments in today’s industry.
Many engineering educators are not
aware of industry changing needs.
Company managements will have to
acquaint eduactors with those needs.

To prepare engineering students so
that they are ready for the changing
technology ahead, engineering schools
might consider a three-fold approach.

First, engineering students could be
oriented more speciﬁcally toward
manufacturing. The increasingly ivory
tower approach could be modiﬁed to
broaden the outlook of future engi-
neers. For example, a would-be
mechanical engineer could, as part of
his academic work, follow a manufac-
turing project through from start to
ﬁnish—that is, design a product, de-
sign the tools, establish a manufactur-
ing sequence and so on to delivery of
the product.

Second, since manufacturing engi-
neering has become an important spe-

cialized ﬁeld, appropriate curricula for
manufacturing engineering could be
developed. The manufacturing engi-
neering curriculum would, of course,
include the basic engineering subjects
—mathematics, physics, chemistry,
statistics and so on — plus liberal
amounts of psychology, human rela-
tions, economics, and oral and written
communication skills.

Third, engineering educators could
also study and ﬁnd solutions to the
problems of providing additional
training, perhaps in the form of after-
hours or refresher courses, for manu-
facturing engineers who are already
on the job.

End result of these efforts will be
even greater manufacturing efficiency,
enabling industry to keep pace with
advances in science and technology
without paying the penalties of un-
duly long lead time and prohibitively
high manufacturing costs.

This article is based on a talk presented to the
San Diego ASTME chapter.

has a hand in Becky Hulls

ballet lesson?

You'd expect that the leading maker of arc carbons that pro-
duce the brilliant light for proiecting motion pictures wouldbe
called upon to duplicate the sun's rays in space simulation
chambers. These chambers are used to test space devices,
such as the communications satellites and space vehicles...
and even the astronauts themselves.

And it probably wouldn't surprise you to learn that a com-
pany that produces half a dozen different types of plastics
would also create an anti-static agent as part of the vinyl
plastic it developed for phonograph records. This keeps dust
from sticking to record surfaces. The sound is improved. The
record lasts longer. And Becky Hull's ballet lessons are per-
formed to music that's more faithfully reproduced.

But would space simulation equipment and better
materials for phonograph records come from one
company? Indeed they would, in the unusual case

of the company known as Union Carbide.

All kinds of seemingly unlikely side-by-side activities turn up
at Union Carbide every day. As a leader in metals and alloys,
it developed a new, stronger stainless steel, and among the
results are better subway cars for New York City. In cryo-
genics, it manufactures the equipment for a technique in brain
surgery based on the use of supercold liquid nitrogen. Its
consumer products include “Eveready” brand batteries and
“Prestone" brand anti-freeze. And it is one of the world's most
diversified private enterprises in the field of atomic energy.

In fact, few other corporations are so deeply involved in
so many different skills and activities that will affect the
technical and production capabilities of our next
century.

And we have a feeling that Becky Hull's future is
just as bright as ours.

Your life at Du Pont...
one of a series for technical graduates

How to ioin DuPont closest to the top

Join us right out of school. Few men start higher at Du Pont
—or with more promise—than graduating engineers. That's
because we fill virtually _a_ﬂ important positions from within.

It's a policy th'at’s helped us grow 750% since 1937. Since
1950 our sales have more than doubled from $1 billion to $2.4
billion. Forty thousand new employment opportunities and
50% of our 1962 sales volume came from products created by
Du Pont research in the last 28 years!

A new pressure sensor, which can function as a switch, fuse or detecting
element, has been introduced by Fairchild Controls, a Division of Fairchild
Camera and Instrument Corporation.

The PSF100 can sense changes in liquids equivalent to less than 1/2 inch
of water can canqbe utilized in detecting air—ﬂows of the same magnitude. Yet,
the pressure sensor is virtually insensitive to shock, vibration, acceleration or
any other mechanical and physical environmental conditions.

Some typical applications for the pressure sensor would include sensing of
interruption or slowdown of air-ﬂow from small blower systems such as the
type used to cool electronic equipment, detection of presence of lé inch of
water or less in critical locations or sensing of changes in level of liquids in
vats, storage tanks, etc. Other major applications for the device could be in
the ﬁlling and bottling industries where exact levels have to be maintained in
containers, or in the plastics molding industries to control the exact degree of
pressures used to form the plastic containers.

Potential applications for the PSF100 can be found in processing industries
including chemical, food, photographic, plastic, petroleum and data; medical,
scientiﬁc and aerospace technologies; marine and automotive; aeromotive
transportation areas and other industries such as mining, utilities, textiles, steel,
and communications.

The PSF100 measures only 1 inch square and is approximately 14 inch
thick. It comes in three basic models to sense gage and differential pressures

and vacuums, and is being sold at a price of approximately $10.00.

GALLIUM PHOSPHIDE
DIODE

REGION

A new way to modulate light waves—using gallium
phosphide diodes—has been devised at Bell Telephone
Laboratories. In the October 1 issue of Applied Physics
Letters, Dr. D. F. Nelson, and F. K. Reinhart reported
that light waves can be modulated by applying a vary-
ing reverse bias to gallium phosphide diodes as the light
travels along the plane of the diode p-n junction.

The discovery was made possible by recent Bell Labs
advances in controlling the chemistry of gallium phos-
phide. The transmission range of the diodes extends from
the green portion of the light spectrum into the near
infrared.

The gallium phosphide diodes are basically phase
modulators but can be converted by conventional tech-
niques for use as amplitude and polarization modulators.
The main features of the modulators are that they can
achieve large phase differences with small voltages (the
phase difference is approximately proportional to the
bias), they can be operated at room temperature, the
length of the light path is short, and high frequency
modulation appears feasible.

The optical properties of gallium phosphide are of
interest because the transmission band of this semi-
conductor lies in the frequency range where many lasers
operate. It‘ is only recently, however, that scientists
have been able to control the chemistry of gallium phos-
phide so that they could investigate its properties.

A low-cost, light buff-colored titanium dioxide (Ti02) pigment with excel-
lent weathering properties is being market by M&T Chemicals, Inc. _

The material—Virﬂux*PR-5 pigment——costs approximately one-third less
th-an white pigment—grade Ti02, has lower surfactant and vehicle demands and
vehicle demands and resists chalking, fading and gloss deterioration even under
severe 43-degree southern exposure in Florida. '

M&T says that weathering properties of Virﬂux PR-5 surpass those of
white pigment-grade Ti02 because, unlike these products, it contains no residual
chemicals that promote deterioration of the binder. Conventional Ti02.pigments
undergo extensive chemical treatment to achieve weathering properties which
still fall short of the chalk and fade-resistance of PR—5, according to M&T.

It is believed that one reason Virﬂux PR-5 exhibits this superior perform-'

ance is that it is a natural pigment. It undergoes only milling, washing and
classiﬁcation with no chemical processing. _

Photo-micrographs show the difference in particle conﬁguration between
M&T’s new Virﬂux* PR-5 (left) and white pigment-grade T10‘-’. The dense,
smooth particles of Virﬂux PR-5 require less resin than the clumped, irregular-
shaped particles of the conventional pigment to resist chalking, fading and
destruction of gloss.

A unique type of vacuum insulation system is the
result of fundamental studies on thermal insulation in
the Chemistry Research Department of General Electric.
Called “P-Zero”, the system has made it possible to
“square the vacuum bottle” and to construct the ﬁrst
successful vacuum vessels in which the walls of the ves-
sel do not require “built-in” strength to resist the
crushing load of the earth’s atmosphere.

To prevent its walls from collapsing under the pres-
sure of the atmosphere, a Dewar ﬂask must be cylindrical
or spherical in shape. However, rectangular containers
often offer advantages of making maximum use of avail-
able space. The major obstacle to a square vacuum
bottle was the need for a ﬁller material that would pre-
vent the walls from collapsing and that would not itself
transmit too much heat by conduction.

The General Electric scientists solved this problem
with the P-Zero system by making a thin metal envelope
that enclosed a specially compacted pad of glass ﬁber.
The envelope is hermetically sealed and evacuated to a
pressure of less than 100 microns—roughly the pressure
that exists at an altitude of 35 miles above the earth’s
surface.

When irons were switched on, both cakes were the
same size. Iron at left separated by P-Zero. Iron at
right rests on a half inch thick slab of abestos board.

“The Making, Shaping and Treating of Steel,” the
most complete one—volun1é reference work relating to the
iron and steel industry, has been published in its eighth
edition by United States Steel Corporation.

Completely revised since its seventh edition was issued
in 1957, the new volume offers users and makers of steel
a. comprehensive summary of present—day theory and
practice covering all phases of iron and steel production
from raw materials to ﬁnished products.

The new edition is the result of a team effort by

 nearly 200 technical representatives of U. S. Steel, its

operating divisions and subsidiaries. It was edited by
H. E. McGannon, under the direction of Dr. J. B. Austin,
administrative vice president, research and technology.

In commenting on the new edition, Dr. Austin said:

“Since 1920, nearly 150,000 copies of “The "Making,
Shaping and Treating of Steel” have been distributed to
steel users, steel-plant employees, trainees, educators, stu-
dents, historians, librarians, and others, on a non-proﬁt
basis. Of the seventh edition alone, nearly 40,000 copies
have been purchased. The book has grown in content and
stature as the ﬁeld of ferrous metallurgy has expanded in
scope and complexity. United States Steel takes satis-
faction in announcing this revised eighth edition to
industry and the public, in continuation of a traditional
service.”

Recent developments in steelmaking and processing

‘that are reviewed include basic oxygen steelmaking

processes, vacuum degassing and continuous casting
methods. Four new chapters cover the manufacture of
tonnage oxygen for steel plant use, direct—reduction proc-
esses, manufacture of heavy press forgings, and water
requirements for steelmaking. A ﬁfth new chapter presents

the fundamental principles of the physical chemistry of
iron and steelmaking.

The book, which contains 1198 pages of text, 982 illus-
trations and 150 tables, is divided into 48 chapters, which
are subdivided into sections. Each chapter and section is
made as nearly independent of others as possible. An
extensive index simpliﬁes use of the book for reference
Work.

In addition to the subjects mentioned above, the book
deals with refractories; iron ores; ﬂuxes and slag; addition
agents; steel scrap; early iron and steelmaking methods;
modern blast furnace practices; the modern pneumatic,
open hearth, electric furnace, duplex -and triplex steel-
making processes; steel and iron castings, including roll
manufacturer; heating methods; rolling mills; rolling and
forging practices; steel conditioning; protective coatings;
heat treatment; mechanical testing; and gages.

Extensive discussions are devoted to the manufacture
and properties of carbon and alloy steels, and the products
made from them. These include blooms, slabs and billets;
heavy forgings; rails and structural sections; plates, mer-
chant bars, and hot strip mill products; cold reduction
mill products; galvanized products; tin plate and terne
plates; circular shapes; axles; shafts; wire; tubular prod-
ucts; electrical sheets; and corrosion—resistant and heat-
resistant products.

Copies of the volume, priced at $10.00 each, may be
obtained from United States Steel, Oﬂice Service-Stores,
1509 Muriel Street, Pittsburgh, Pa. (15203). Students of
accredited educational institutions may obtain the book
for $5.00 per copy, providing each order is countersigned
by a faculty member.

An old fraternity brother told us about a gag an
undergrad girlfriend of his pulled off last semester: She
disguised herself as a boy, joined a fraternity and the
authorities never found out about it.

“Wait a minute,” we objected. “If this girl joined a
fraternity, she would have had to dress with the guys
and shower with them.”

“Sure.”

“Whell then, someone must have discovered she was
a girl!”

“Probably,” said our friend, downing his drink. “But

Sophisticated engineers can rise rapidly here

Ed, Bob, and Hipparchus (their true identities hidden here
against pitiless kidding by all-too-real colleagues) are three
Kodak mechanical engineers on their way to a management
meeting for the up-and-coming. Let us consider differences
rather than similarities.

Ed works on those inexpensive, sure-ﬁre cameras that
Americans as well as citizens of the rest of the civilized world
think of when “Kodak” is mentioned. The big boss who
chose Ed for his department says: “Along with Ph.D.s in
solid-state physics, I look for B.S. and M.S. mechanical
engineers from whom I can expect the unexpected. The spots
for sophisticated engineering don’t always have a sign over
the door that says ‘SOPHISTICATED.’ Who would ever
have dreamed ten years ago that low-price zoom lenses and
automatic exposure-setters and through—the-lens ﬁnders
could deliver the performance they do today ? The doozers
we have ready to unveil next year and the year after that
are well in hand, fortunately. Then what?” Then what is
Ed’s responsibility. He will need help from fellows now in
college. Maybe you.

Bob works on data-recording and information-retrieval
photographic systems. His work has to impress cost-minded
brother engineers in other companies as well as banks and

other hard-nosed commercial customers. He meets the
requirements of a boss who says: “The type I need was
called an ‘inventor’ a generation ago. The difference is that
in 1965 he will need a lot more mathematics, engineering
physics, chemistry, hydraulics, electronics, and other book-
learning than an inventor needed in 1925. When it comes
time to relax, though, you’ll ﬁnd him building something
with his hands, and it’s probably something pretty clever
and unusual that works real well.” As it happens, Bob’s
main hobby is neither bridge nor folk singing.

Old Hip calls square dances and doesn’t care who knows.
Policy proscribes discussion of the nature but not of the
philosophy of his engineering. His boss puts it: “In con-
sumer and commercial products, where regular service can
easily be part of the engineering plan, perfection would
carry a price tag that made no sense. With us, a perfect
score is the only acceptable goal. Nothing less makes eco-
nomic sense. Before our guys can think of what is sensible,
they have to think of what is possible. It can be Very enjoy-
able for the right type of smart apple.”

Drop us a line if you can see yourself as any of these three
right types, whether in mechanical engineering, chemical
engineering, electronic engineering, chemistry, or physics.

Advancement in a Big Company:

 

C. K. Rieger

Charles K. Rieger joined General Elec-
tric’s Technical Marketing Program after
earning a BSEE at the University of Mis-
souri in 1936. Following sales engineering
assignments in motor, defense and home
laundry operations, he became manager of
the Heating Device and Fan Division in
1947. Other Consumer-industry management
positions followed. In 1953 he was elected
a vice president, one of the youngest men
ever named a Company officer. Mr. Rieger
became Vice President, Marketing Services
in 1959 and was appointed to his present
position in 1961. He is responsible for all
the operations of some six divisions com-
posed of 23 product operations oriented
primarily toward the Electric Utility market.

Q. How can I be sure of getting the
recognition I feel I'm capable of earn-
ing in a big company like G.E.?

A. We learned long ago we couldn't
afford to let capable people get lost.
That was one of the reasons why G.E.
was decentralized into more than a
hundred autonomous operating de-
partments. These operations develop,
engineer, manufacture and market
products much as if they were inde-

How it Works

pendent companies. Since each de-
partment is responsible for its own
success, each man's share of author-
ity and responsibility is pinpointed.
Believe me, outstanding performance
is recognized, and rewarded.

Q. Can you tell me what the “promo-
tional ladder" is at General Electric?

A. We regard each man individually.
Whether you join us on a training
program or are placed in a specific
position opening, you'll first have to
prove your ability to handle a job.
Once you've done that, you'll be given
more responsibility, more difficult
projects—work that's important to
the success of your organization and
your personal development. Your abil-
‘ity will create a “promotional ladder"
of your own.

Q. Will my development be confined
to whatever department I start in?

A. Not at all! Here’s where “big com-
pany” scope works to broaden your
career outlook. Industry, and General
Electric particularly, is constantly
changing—adapting to market the
fruits of research, reorganizing to
maintain proper alignment with our
customers, creating new operations
to handle large projects. All this rep-
resents opportunity beyond the limits
of any single department.

An Interview with General Electric's C. K. Rieger, Vice President and Group Executive, Electric Utility Group

Q. Yes, but just how often do these
opportunities arise?

A. To give you some idea, 25 percent
of G-E's gross sales last year came
from products that were unknown
only five or ten years ago. These new
products range from electric tooth
brushes and silicone rubber com-
pounds to atomic reactors and inter-
planetary space probes. This chang-
ing Company needs men with ambi-
tion and energy and talent who aren't
afraid of a big job—who welcome the
challenge of helping to start new
businesses like these. Demonstrate
your abiIity—whether to handle com-
plex technical problems or to manage
people, and you won't have long to
wait for opportunities to fit your
needs.

Q. How does General Electric help
me prepare myself for advancement
opportunity?

A. Programs in Engineering, Manu-
facturing or Technical Marketing give
you valuable on-the-job training. We
have Company-conducted courses to
improve your professional ability no
matter where you begin. Under Tui-
tion Refund or Advanced Degree Pro-
grams you can continue your formal
education. Throughout your career
with General Electric you'll receive
frequent appraisals to help your self-
development. Your advancement will
be largely up to you.

Sure, everybody's got a career program. But we think you’ll find
ours a little more stimulating, more rewarding, and at least in-
triguing enough to spend the next minute or so reading about it.

We call it our “Career Acceleration Program.” In it, you'll work on
such advanced projects as an avionics system for supersonic aircraft,
a guidance/navigation system for the Apollo Command Module and
LEM,and a newguidance system for theTitan III space launch vehicle.

Seven hours a day you'll work on a specific project. You'll spend one
hour each day in formal class work. These classes include courses in
Inertial Instruments, Inertial Guidance, Digital Computers, Advanced
Transistors, Advanced Servomechanisms, Integrated Circuits, Space
Mechanics, plus other mathematics and undergraduate disciplines
as required.

We also have a Tuition Refund Plan that pays all of your tuition costs
upon satisfactorily completing college-level courses of study under-
taken voluntarily. Our “in—p|ant” evening educational program
offers additional opportunities for technical improvement.

If you are completing your BS or MS degree in EE, ME, Math or

Physics, we invite you to inquire about the opportunities at any of
our three locations. AC in MILWAUKEE—our main research, develop-
ment and manufacturing facility. AC in BOSTON—our Research and
Development Laboratory specializing in advanced inertial compo-
nents; spacecraft and avionics guidance/navigation systems. AC in
LOS ANGELES—our Research and Development Laboratory special-
izing in advanced airborne computers; ballistic missile and space

1 Blue-sky theorizing is essential to engineering. in

fact, it is the ignition point for all technological

‘A achievement. But the best ideas in and out of this

world can fail if the proving ground, the testing

' lab, or the constructive cynicism of mature co-
professionals aren't available to question an idea’

or a product's ultimate function. E] Engineers
working without these facilities wind up talking
only to themselves —- and there's a word for that
condition. Hamilton Standard management long
ago recognized that in the marketplaces- of the
aerospace industry, a company's ability to pro-
duce a workable article is largely measured by
two basic criteria: the genius of its people . . . and
the physical resources at their immediate dis-
posal. Hamilton Standard is the “compleat” en-
gineering organization. The company is a unique
blend of many advanced projects, specialized

,engineering skills. . . plus exceptional research,

laboratory and manufacturing facilities. El Pres-
ent projects involve environmental control sys-
tems, engine controls, starters and turbomachin-
ery, air induction controls, propellers, electron
beam technology, ground support equipment,
electronics, thrust vector controls, bioscience
research and spacecraft life support systems.
This broad product range requires, obviously, an
engineering teamlwith a widevariety of engineer-
ing skills. [3 The group of over one. thousand

Available as tools to our engineers are Divisional

facilities of over 1.5 million square feet. These 
facilities have established Hamilton Standard as

a world leader in contributing to state-of—the-art

advances in vibrations, aerodynamics, hydraulics, 

and control dynamics, among others. A recently 
completed space simulator for manned missions 

will further advance the state-of-the-art in life sup-
port systems, when Division engineers outfitted

in our space suits conduct tests at a simulated

altitude of approximately 1,500,000 feet. [3 if you’

Change. Change. Change.That’s research.

Change is at the heart of our Re-
search and Development program.
The optical font characters in the
illustration above are part of a lan-
guage that both people and elec-
tronic computer systems can under-
stand . . .just one of an ever-growing
list of scientific achievements by
NCR people that have brought about
many changes in such areas as
electronics, photochromics, semi-
conductor materials, and paper

technology. All of these advances are
of vital interest to business, industry,

government and military agencies.

For example, because of NCR

research, it is now possible to re-
duce a full page the size of a news-
paper to a tiny rectangle of space.

The reduction is made possible

through NCR’s photochromic micro-

image process. A minute area can
hold thousands ofmicro-capsules...
cell-likestructures containinguseful

materials produced by means of
NCR’s amazing chemical process of
micro-encapsulation.

Perhaps your own changing inter-
ests and professional employment
objectives coincide with those of
NCR. If so, and you would like to be
considered for positions that are
now opening, write in complete con-
fidencetoT. F.Wade,Technical Place-

Why become an engineer at
Garrett-AiResearch? You’ll have to

work harder and use more of

your knowledge than engineers

at most other companies.

If you’re our kind of engineer,
you have some very deﬁnite ideas
about your career.

For example:

You’ve worked hard to get a
good education. Now you want to
put it to work in the best way
possible.

You will never be satisﬁed with
run-of-the-mill assignments. You
demand exciting,
challenging projects.

You not only accept
individual responsibil-
ity — you insist upon it.

Does that sound like
you? Then AiResearch 
is your cup of tea. 

Our business is
mainly in sophisticated aerospace
systems and subsystems.

Here, research, design, and de-
velopment lead to production of

 
 

actual hardware.
That means you
have the oppor-
tunity to start with

a customer’s problem
and see it through to a
system that will get the job done.

The product lines at AiResearch,
Los Angeles Division, are environ-
mental systems, ﬂight information

and controls sys-

tems, heat transfer
systems, secondary
power generator
systems for missiles
and space, electri-
cal systems, and
specialized indus-
trial systems.

In each category AiResearch
employs three kinds of engineers.

Preliminary design engineers do
the analytical and theoretical
work, then write proposals.

Design engineers do the lay-
outs; turn an idea into a product.

Developmental engineers are
responsible for making hardware
out of concepts.

Whichever ﬁeld ﬁts you best, we
can guarantee you this: you can
go as far and fast as your talents
can carry you. You can make as
much money as any engineer in a
comparable spot — anywhere. And
of course, at AiResearch, you’ll
get all the plus beneﬁts a top com-
pany offers.

  
 
  

Our engineering staff is smaller
than comparable companies. This
spells opportunity. It gives a man
who wants to make a mark plenty
of elbow room to expand. And
while he’s doing it he’s working
with, and learning from, some of
the real pros in the ﬁeld.

If the AiResearch story sounds
like opportunity speaking to you-
don’t fail to contact AiResearch,
Los Angeles, or see our repre-
sentative when he comes to your
campus.

We’ll be happy to talk to you —
about you and your future.

And put this in the back of your
mind:

In a ﬁeld where meeting chal-
lenges pays off in rewards. . .
