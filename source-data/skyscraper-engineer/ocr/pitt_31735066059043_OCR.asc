The organization: perhaps the most important
in the world today...186,000,000 sharehold-
ers in this country alone. ..an area of distri-
bution extending millions of miles upward
and outward.

The immediate business at hand: protecting
and sustaining the peace—our very survival.
There are some who would describe this
organization as non-profit. And there are
others, who would more thoughtfully deem
its investments, dividends, and assets noth-
ing less than priceless.

Today, thousands of selected young college
graduates are joining that organization in
responsible executive positions. They join to
serve as officers in the United StatesAir Force.

The resources at hand for the career devel-
opment of these applicants are matchless.
They are participating in the world's most
advanced research and development pro-
grams. Engineering, science, administration
—each career field calls for the services of
forward-looking graduates who will assume
vital responsibilities. The start of an out-
standing career awaits you in this organiza-
tion where success is more than a corporate
objective—because if it doesn't happen here,

Let’s look at the price of eggs

What did you pay for eggs this week? Probably a little more or a little less than last week. Prices of things go
up and down because of many factors . . . such as supply and demand, wages, materials and shipping costs,
and needed proﬁts. It all gets more complex when you consider taxes and competition, or compare our econ-
omy to that of other countries. } Now millions of people can learn more about economics from a stimulating
series of television programs on The American Economy. Conducted by leading educators and economists,
“College of the Air” will describe how our economic system works . . . how it provides stability and growth
. . . how it enhances individual freedom. Starting this fall, The American Economy will appear on the CBS

curtains of air

A new door which promises to find many diverse uses in business and

industry has been invented. Rapidly gaining acceptance, it presents several.

unique design problems.

A revolutionary new kind of door
has been developed in Switzerland—
a closed door that is always open!
Having no hinged or sliding compo-
nents, this door is a curtain of air.

To create this barrier, air is blown
across the doorway, usually vertically
downward from louvers in the ceiling.
The air is then collected through a
grate in the ﬂoor and delivered to a
washing pit where dust, smoke and
other impurities are removed. By con-
tinuous recycling, a constant air cur-
tain barrier can be maintained across
the entranceway.

Although air is delivered at a veloc-
ity that is hardly noticeable to a person
passing through it, an air curtain can
separate areas of different pressure,
temperature, or humidity or to conﬁne
smoke or dust without sacriﬁcing or
limiting accessibility.

Air curtains must be designed to
stabilize pressures and must not be
broken by variations of the differential
air pressure across the door. This
difference in pressure is controlled by
moving the delivery louvers to direct
the air in the direction of the high
pressure. In the design of an air cur-
tain, many things have to be taken into
account such as stack effect, building
orientation, air curtain depth, and
equipment placement.

One of the main problems arises
from stack effect. In winter, buildings
that are not tightly constructed lose
warm air through the top sections of
the building, and cool air is sucked in
at the bottom. This effect creates a
pressure difference which tends to push

by Charles Hosick

in the air curtain. In warm months,
however, this effect is reversed. Cool
air is lost through lower sections and
warm air is brought in at higher levels.
This stack effect not only increases the
problem of design for an air door, but
also increases the cost of heating in
the winter and cooling in the summer.
A good air curtain should minimize
this heating and cooling load, stabilize
the stack effect, and withstand direct
wind velocities of as high as thirty
miles per hour when supported by a
tightly sealed building. For this reason
air curtain doors can be installed in
newly constructed buildings as high as
thirty stories, but are not recommended
for older buildings with manually op-
erated windows and/or higher than 12
stories. In older buildings the degree
of stack effect can be measured and
the air curtain designed accordingly.
However, in new structures the theo-
retical elfect has to be calculated,
taking into account the degree of
pressurization, the tightness and the
type of construction of the building.

Another major design problem is the
orientation of the building. A building
facing the wind is very difficult to seal
with an air curtain unless windshields
are erected to deﬂect the wind. With-
out windshields the machinery used to
circulate the air would have to be half
again as large and with a wide curtain
an oblique wind would cause a high
pressure at one end with a low pressure
at the other. When wind patterns are
constant and predictable, the air cur-
tain can be designed easily. However,
when the wind patterns are complicat-

ed or irregular, wind tunnel studies are
especially useful and are often required
in designing unusual applications.

One such case was the design of an
air curtain door for the new Pan Amer-
ican Airways building at New York’s
Idlewild Airport. Here the average
wind is seventeen miles per hour with
speeds reaching a maximum of hurri-
cane velocity. Sulzer Brothers, Incor-
porated, a Swiss concern with offices
in New York, was assigned the task of
designing the giant air curtain covering
eighty—nine feet of the front of the
building. It was decided that wind-
shields would have to be erected, but
the problem was what was the best size
and position for the screens. In order
to obtain the most accurate informa-
tion, wind tunnel tests were made at
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technol-
ogy in Zurich, Switzerland. There it
was found that the air curtain would
be effective as much as ninety—ﬁve per-
cent of the time. In order to maintain
the air curtain, it would have to be
seven feet deep and would require six
hundred thousand cubic feet of air per
minute.

The depth of an air curtain (the
distance from the outside to the inside
of the building) is determined by the
wind pressure against which it has to
work. Depths range from about two
feet six inches for mild conditions to
the seven feet needed to maintain the
stability of the curtain at Pan Amer-
ican. The pressure exerted by an air
curtain is a function of the depth of
the curtain and the velocity at which
the air is delivered. Under normal

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER OCTOBER 1962

conditions, velocities are usually less
than twelve hundred feet per minute
(13.5 mph), a gentle breeze at head
level. However, under severe cold or
windy conditions, the increased veloc-
ity needed to maintain the air barrier
would be no less comfortable than the
weather outside. Here again it is a
relatively simple matter to calculate the
design requirements for small or me-
dium openings, but serious complica-
tions are encountered with a substantial
increase in opening area.

The placement of equipment for an
air door is also a major design factor.
There are several possible arrange-
ments of equipment. Placing equip-
ment above the entrance provides a
short air travel, but more room is re-
quired and structural support is needed
for the heavy machinery. Also, with
this arrangement the air ducts must be
especially airtight to prevent the short
circuit of air. Equipment placed adja-
cent to the entrance is undesirable be-
cause it takes up valuable ﬂoor space.
Placing equipment remote from the
entrance allows greater ﬂexibility of
design but is more expensive because
of the long ducts needed to carry the
air. The best place for the machinery
is beneath the entrance. This, too,
provides short air travel and can also
be arranged very compactly while al-

can penetrate this industrial air curtain.

NOT EVEN THE HIGH PRESSURE BLAST of a carbon dioxide ﬁre extinguisher

lowing freedom of design at the ﬂoor
level.

In all air door applications, it is de-
sirable and often necessary to provide
conventional doors. These doors may
be folded back against the ducts or into
pockets at the side of the entrance or
may be raised above or lowered below
the entrance. These doors are needed
after hours when it is no longer ad-
vantageous or economical to operate
the air door, when wind and tempera-
ture range beyond the capacity of the
air curtain, or in case of equipment
or power failure. .

In order to improve the appearance
of the entrance several other factors
are taken into consideration. The first
is the return grate in the ﬂoor. This
must be made with holes small enough
so that ladies’ tiny high heels will not
be caught. Another factor is the dis-
charge plenum above the entrance. If
the entrance is especially high, a glass
plenum may be used to lower the
actual discharge area without blocking
the view.

For many applications of air curtains
it is desirable to have automatic con-
trols. These controls are temperature
or pressure sensing devices which ad-
just the delivery angle and velocity to
maintain the air curtain. One such

device uses two temperature sensing

 

units, each precision-made to register
a change of one degree Fahrenheit per
second. This type of unit is used for
the giant air curtain at the Pan Amer-
ican Building.

Under ideal conditions the air enters
the grill just inside of the entrance con--
tacting only one of the sensing units.
When wind pressure outside becomes
too great the air curtain is actually
pushed back. The cooler outside air
is registered by the sensing unit and
fan speed and the discharge angle is
increased. If the pressure outside be-
comes less, the air curtain spills out-
side. A second sensing unit, located
outside of the grill, registers an increase
in temperature and the discharge angle
and velocity is decreased. This type of
control is very sensitive but is only sat-
isfactory during periods when the air
curtain is heated above sixty—ﬁve de-
grees Fahrenheit.

In summer months a different type
of control is used. This is a pressure
differential device. Pressure samples
are taken from inside and outside and
delivered to a ﬂexible diaphragm sens-
ing unit. This diaphragm regulator
control then adjusts mechanically for
differences in pressure. This type of
control responds to very slight pressure
changes (as low as one one—hundredth
of an inch of water).

There are notable instances of air
door applications in the United States.
One of the most spectacular is the Pan
American installation mentioned above.
This huge building, covering four acres,
contains an air door which is eighty-
nine feet long and seven feet deep. It
was decided to use an air door so that
there would be no crowding or delay
of passengers between the incoming
roads and the main concourse. This
huge air curtain door utilizes equip-
ment which is placed remote from the
entrance. The heating coils, which de-
liver warmed air during winter months,
along with the ﬁlters and other machin-
ery, are contained in an aluminum
housing, one hundred thirty feet long,
located on the roof. Six hundred thou-
sand cubic feet of air per minute is
delivered from the housing by six axial
fans, each driven by a 75 horsepower
motor. This air is delivered through
silencers to the glass supply plenum
located above the entrance. The glass
plenum is as wide and deep as the door
and reaches twenty—three feet high. Air

is collected through an aluminum grat-
ing with openings only 7/32 of an inch,
and then travels through automatic
scrubbers which remove dust and dirt.
Filtered air is returned to the equip-
ment on the roof through two glass
ducts where velocities reach as high
as ﬁve thousand feet per minute.

Another sensational application of
an air curtain will be used at the Gas
Incorporated’s six million dollar ex-
hibit building at the 1964 World’s Fair
in New York City. Here air belts,
heated and cooled by gas, will keep
a large portion of the forty thousand
square foot building wrapped in com-
fort. One air curtain will enclose a
two hundred seat restaurant on three
sides. This air curtain will keep the
weather outside without restricting
sight or sound of the surrounding fair
grounds. Another curtain will be used
in the main exhibit hall, a horizontal
belt located twenty feet above the ﬂoor,
which will restrict air conditioning to
the lower two—ﬁfths of the hall where
it is more needed. Delivery and col-
lection grills will be concealed in the
landscaping and decor of the building.

Air doors are also very useful in
industrial application. Such an appli-
cation is General Electric’s “Building
800” in Evandale, Ohio. This door
is used at a garage. The design cri-
teria for the entrances were (1) safety
of operation, (2) dependability in al-
lowing fast exit in case of emergency,
(3) speed for general use, and (4) the
usual economic factors of installation
and maintenance.

It was decided that an air door for
Building 800 would best be suited for
several reasons. First, because of the
ramp approach, there are no high
winds to contend with. Also the air
door affords maximum safety because
there are no obstructions to slow traffic.
This, too, means maximum ease and
speed of entry for general use. Be-
cause of the vehicular trafﬁc within the
garage and the stack effect, enough
make—up air was introduced into the
garage so that no air return system was
necessary. The inside air is simply ex-
hausted through the air door. This
minimized the problem of heating,
cooling and ﬁltering the return air.
Another factor favoring the selection
of an air door was that there were no
velocity requirements. Also, the build-
ing was a garage and the acoustical

requirements were liberal.

The entrance and exit are close to-
gether so that the machinery servicing
both openings could be compact. Each
opening is serviced by axial fans, thirty-
six inches in diameter, which deliver
a total air ﬂow of forty—four thousand
cubic feet per minute at a velocity of
twenty—two hundred feet per minute.
In this application, the air curtain is
vertical across the opening and directed
at an outward angle of thirty degrees.
The air curtain is stabilized by striking
an abutment on the opposite wall. The
original heaters were left so that under

severe conditions the tempered inside
air would make up the air curtain.
Conventional doors were also kept for
emergency use. After months of op-
eration, it is reported that the air cur-
tain is quite satisfactory.

The advantages of this revolutionary
type of door are many. It allows safe,
easy access while providing an efﬁcient,
economical seal between temperature,
pressure or other elements. Perhaps
in the near future we can look forward
to more applications of the amazing
door for both commercial and indus-

trial use.

. . . and 4 young mining engineer. . .

...they collaborated across the centuries
to make life better today

In ancient China they “piped” water through hollow bamboo
sections, but they couldn’t shut it off. One day a workman
with an engineering mind bored a hole in a plug and ﬁtted
it into holes in the pipe. This was the ﬁrst plug valve.

Centuries later, the brilliant young mathematician and
scientist, Blaise Pascal, worked out the principle of hydraulics
for which he is famous: “A unit pressure applied to a liquid
contained in a sealed vessel is transmitted to every part of the
liquid with undiminished force.”

In 1914, Sven Nordstrom, a young mining engineer, had
trouble with sticking, leaking valves on the acid lines at a
silver mine. By combining the plug cock idea of the ancient
Chinese with Pascal’s principle of hydraulics, he created a
new idea in flow control: the lubricated plug valve.

Today, the Rockwell-Nordstrom lubricated plug valve is
widely used in the petroleum and natural gas industries, in
chemical processing, and in general manufacturing. Its effi-
ciency helps cut the cost of many of the things you use every
day. And thanks to hundreds of engineering advances, the
original lubricated plug valve is still the most modern.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like
to work for, buy from, and invest in.

project

mohole

Many secrets are contained in the earth’s inner
core. Project Mohole was launched to probe the
inner mantle and reveal some of the reasons for

natural phenomena.

by Andrew Rzeznik

The inner core of the earth contains
many secrets concerning the changes
that the earth and the life that exists
on it have undergone from the earth’s
beginning to the present time. How-
ever, until recent times the earth’s in-
terior was not explored to any great
extent. Project Mohole is the ﬁrst
attempt to probe the earth’s mantle.
At present, somewhere in the Paciﬁc,
scientists are working ceaselessly in an
attempt to drill through the earth’s
crust to heretofore unexplored depths.

The crust of the earth is composed
of several relatively thick layers of
granite under the continents, and thin-

ner, denser, basalt under the ocean

basins. Beneath these layers lies the
earth’s mantle composed of silicates
and nickel-iron. The mantle is about
1800 miles thick and accounts for
80% of the earth’s volume. Within it
are contained sediments and fossil de-
posits from the earliest history of the
earth. Separating the mantle from the
upper layers is the Mohovoviviv Dis-
continuity, Moho for short, named
after the seismologist A. Mohovoviviv
who discovered it in 1909. Drilling
through these thin layers to unfold the
history of the earth’s beginning is the
purpose of Project Mohole.

To reach the Moho Layer from land
would require drilling a hole at least
twenty miles deep. The deepest hole
on record, 25,340 feet drilled in west

THE CUSS I, the ship used in the drilling
operation. This photo was taken during
a practice run at LaJ0lla, California.

Texas in 1958, is roughly one—ﬁfth of
the distance required for the project.
Over water, however, a great part of
the distance to be drilled would be
through water itself, a substantial sav-
ing of both time and wear on equip-
ment. In addition, because the ocean
ﬂoor is thinner than the granite layer
under the continents, the amount of
material to be penetrated is reduced
still further. The ocean ﬂoor is com-
posed of basalt, a dark grey rock re-
sembling marble, which is about as
diﬂicult to drill as concrete.

Choosing a spot for the drilling op-
eration involved many problems. The
ideal site would be the lowest spot on
the original earth’s surface, into which
the ﬁrst waters drained and brought
the ﬁrst sediments with them. Here
the entire history of the earth and the
evolution of life is contained within
the layers of the sediment. To the best
of our knowledge, no such spot exists.
The site where the ocean ﬂoor is thin-
nest was only one of the many items
to be considered. Other important
considerations involve ﬁnding an area
relatively free from storms, having a
low heat ﬂow, and mild oceanic cur-
rents. In addition there would have
to be suﬁicient data available on the
area with regard to the approximate
depth of the water and the thickness
of the ocean ﬂoor.

For year—round drilling the climate
should be warm and away from the
storm tracks. An intense storm would
require the ship to abandon its posi-
tion and would mean having to start
the project over again. Low oceanic

currents are desirable to reduce the
stress on the drill pipe and keep the
movement of the ship to a minimum.
Low heat ﬂow is perhaps the most
critical to the use of the hole once it
is drilled. High heat would cause the

instruments that would be sent down
to collect data to fail completely.

Although temperatures of 200°
Centigrade are expected, several of the
other potential sites had temperature
readings much higher. The location
decided upon was near Guadalupe
Island located in the Paciﬁc Ocean
south of San Diego. The spot is well
suited since the area is free from bad
weather and not very far from the
mainland. Based on seismic studies
the water at this site is about two miles
deep and the crust four miles thick.

A specially designed barge, “The
Cuss I” was used for the project.

E ——Site selected for the Mohole Operation

Originally a navy freight barge, the
Cuss I was converted by several oil
companies into an experimental drill-
ing station for obtaining samples of
oil bearing rocks in shallow water.
The barge itself weighs 1500 tons, is
260 feet long, and has a 100 foot high
derrick mounted on it. To hold the
barge in position, it was decided to
use a system consisting of four steer-
able outboard motors, each developing
250 horsepower, mounted on the cor-
ners of the barge. From the wheel-
house, one man, using a single control
stick, can control the movement of the
ship. Within the ship, below decks,
is the drilling table.

From earlier studies it was found
that severe bending stresses would be
developed in the drilling pipe due to
ocean currents, movements of the
barge, and rotation of the pipe. To

combat this problem, a guide shoe,
shaped like an inverted cone, was
placed under the barge directly below
the drilling table. Any stress caused
by rolling of the barge would be dis-
tributed over the entire forty foot
length of the shoe rather than con-
centrated on the base of the drilling
table. The shoe is designed to protect
the pipe even if the barge rolls as much
as six degrees, although this much roll
is not expected. Acceleration loading
and longitudinal waves in the drill pipe
caused by vertical movement of the
barge were compensated for by damp-
ing discs located at various depths
along the drill pipe.

Radar and. sonar were used to posi-
tion the drill pipe. The position of the
barge is held relative to eight buoys
anchored to the ocean bottom, four of
which are held submerged 200 feet be-

low the surface. Attached to those
beneath the water are battery—operated
sonar transducers. The remaining four
buoys ﬂoat on the surface and support
radar reﬂectors. In the wheelhouse of
the Cuss I the pilot has two screens
to monitor; a sonar screen showing the
ship’s position relative to the sub-
merged buoys and a radar screen re-
lating the ship’s position to the surfaced
buoys. Using these screens as a guide,
the pilot is able to control the thrust
and direction of the outboard motors
that keep the Cuss I directly over the
spot to be drilled.

The drill pipe is made of steel with
a tensile stress ranging from 80,000
to 105,000 pounds per square inch.
The pipe is tapered in steps so that its
weight does not exceed its tensile stress
at the surface. Some of the weight of
the pipe is taken up by underwater
ﬂotation tanks which also help com-
pensate for the movement of the barge
on the surface. Flexible drill pipe was
used for the project. Only slightly
more rigid than tapered cable, it can
be expected to sway, bend, and even
form loops in response to the forces
of moving water. Holding the drill in
place are two guide lines with 30,000
pound weights attached to each of
them.

The drilling procedure is as follows:
the ship is anchored using the radar
and sonar method discussed earlier.
Next a prefabricated landing base and
easing are suspended beneath the ship.
The drill is lowered to the bottom to
make a shallow hole. It is then partly
removed and the landing base and
easing are lowered into place. The
drilling then proceeds through the cas-
ing. Drilling is by the standard rotary
method used by the petroleum indus-
try. The drill rotates at twenty to forty
RPM using salt water as the drilling
ﬂuid. The $30,000 drill bit, made of
tungsten carbide, is diamond-studded
to prevent rapid wear. Once the de-
sired depth is reach, the drill is re-
moved and a hollow cylinder is lowered
within the pipe to obtain a sample of
the earth’s mantle.

Project Mohole promises much new
knowledge of the earth’s interior. Many
theories, based on indirect evidence,
have been formulated regarding the na-
ture of the earth’s interior. Their
validity can now be compared with
knowledge gained from actual samples
of the mantle. Laboratory work on
actual specimens at high temperatures
and pressures will yield more informa-
tion than supposed mineral combina-
tions that have been in use up to the

present time. When the density of the
crust is accurately determined, im-
proved estimates of the density of rock
all the way to the center of the earth
can be made. When the radioactivity
of a sample of the mantle is known,
it will be possible to say whether the
earth is heating or cooling. The direct
measurements of temperature, radio-
activity, magnetism, and heat ﬂow will
be far more accurate than the indirectly
determined existing data. Radioactive
analysis will also enable scientists to
accurately determine the age of the
earth. Also, since oceanic sediments
show very little variation over huge
areas, along with the fact that continu-
ous sedimentation has taken place in
some areas that have not been dis-
turbed by movements of the earth’s
crust, cores taken from such sediment
may very well contain an uninterrupted
record of the earth’s development for
two billion years.

Similarly, knowledge of the earth’s
climatic history will be revealed. Be-
cause the solubility of calcium car-
bonate is related to temperature, the
amount of calcium carbonate in a sedi-
ment indicated the temperature at the
time the sediment was deposited. The
earth’s internal heat is a combination
of the original heat of formation plus

The Bethlehem Loop Course .

 

The Loop Course is our continuing
program for selecting and training
qualiﬁed college graduates for ca-
reers with Bethlehem Steel. It was
established some forty years ago.
Its unusual name comes from the
fact that from the very beginning,
the course has included an obser-
vational circuit (or “loop”) of a
steel plant.

Promotion from Within

The Loop Course provides man-
agement personnel. Since it is our
policy to promote from within, it is
vital that competent men, well-
grounded in our practices and
policies, be available to ﬁll manage-
ment openings as they occur. And,
due to Bethlehem’s steady and
continuing growth, there has been
no lack of opportunities to advance.

The Basic Course

Every looper attends the initial
ﬁve-week course held at our home

 

. . . and how it works

office in Bethlehem, Pa., beginning
early in July. He attends orienta-
tion talks, listens to discussions by
management men on all phases of
company operations, and makes
daily trips through the local steel
plant. At the end of this period he
has a sound knowledge of the over-
all Bethlehem organization.

Their First Assignments

At the end of the basic course,
loopers receive their ﬁrst assign-
ments. Ordinarily a large majority
report to our steelmaking plants,
where they attend orientation pro-
grams much like the initial one at
Bethlehem. During this period,
plant management Qlosely observes
each looper’s aptitudes and inter-
ests, with the objective of giving
him an assignment for which he
appears to be best ﬁtted, and cor-
responding as closely as possible to
his interests, educational back-
ground, and work preferences. Loop-
ers selected for sales, research,
fabricated steel construction, min-
ing, shipbuilding, and the com-
pany's administrative departments,
proceed from the basic course to
specialized training programs.

Preparing for Advancement

As the looper gains in ability,
experience, and knowledge, and as
openings occur, he is moved into
positions of increasingly greater
responsibility. The company ex-
pects and encourages the looper to

SPHERICAL F LUXTANK

No, it’s not a space vehicle. But
this spherical ﬂuxtank, designed and
built by Marshall Laboratories, Tor-
rance, Calif., may help answer impor-
tant questions about magnetic ﬁelds in
outer space. It is used to calibrate
magnometers that will be sent into
outer space to measure magnetic ﬁelds.
Part of this is done with Allegheny
Ludlum Steel Corporation’s Mumetal,
an alloy with very high permeability.
The equipment in the tanks is used to
generate weak magnetic ﬁelds and cali-
brate the magnometers. The top of
the sphere, constructed in the same
way, is lowered over the equipment
during testing.

OIL PANS

New oil pans for use on Chrysler
marine engines have been devised by
the Marine and Industrial Engine Di-
vision of the Chrysler Corporation.
These new oil pans are made of cor-
rosion—resistant stainless steel produced
by Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corpora-
tion. There were three basic reasons
for choosing stainless steel—the elimi-
nation of tooling costs since it is possi-
ble to use existing automotive pan dies
and tools; it has superior corrosion
resistance; and it offers considerable
weight savings. It is believed that this
is the ﬁrst time that stainless steel has
been used in this way. These oil pans
are used on both V-8 and 6—cylinder
Chrysler marine engines in combina-
tion with inboard—outboard drives and
on turbine or “jet” drive models.

GLASS SUBSTRATE

This glass substrate containing tanta-
lum—nitride resistors was produced by
the new Bell Laboratories technique of
sputtering in a partial nitrogen atmos-
phere. In the “sputtering” process,
ionized gas molecules bombard a cath-
ode of a refractory metal such as tan-
talum, dislodging its atoms which then
redeposit on nearby surfaces. By using
this technique in conjunction with a
photolithographic etching process, very
precise miniature resistors can be pro-
duced on glass or ceramic bases. Be-
cause of their minuteness, the way they
are constructed, and their reliability,
tantalum—nitride resistors will be par-
ticularly suitable for use in integrated
circuits. Typical applications would
be in logic modules in certain types of
switching systems, or in various types
of transmission networks.

L BUT YOUR FEET MUST BE ON THE GROUND

The glamour and excitement of space age programs often obscure a fundamental fact. It is simply
that farsightedness must be coupled with sound, practical, down-to-earth engineering if goals are
to be attained. This is the philosophy upon which Pratt & Whitney Aircraft’s position as a world
leader in ﬂight propulsion systems has been built.

Almost four decades of solid engineering achievement at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft can be credited
to management’s conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy progress. In
addition to concentrated research and development eﬂ'orts on advanced gas turbine and rocket
engines, new and exciting effects are being explored in every ﬁeld of aerospace, marine and industrial
power application.

The challenge of the future is indicated by current programs. Presently Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
is exploring the areas of technical knowledge in magnetohydrodynamics . . . thermionic and thermo-
electric conversions . . . hypersonic propulsion . . . fuel cells and nuclear power.

if you have interests in common with us, if you look to the future but desire to take a down-to-earth
approach to get there, investigate career opportunities at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ambitious young engineers and scientists. Your de-
gree? It can be a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL o AERONAUTICAL 0 ELECTRICAL o CHEMICAL and
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING o PHYSICS o CHEMISTRY 0 METALLURGY o CERAMICS o MATHEMATICS o ENGI-
NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS. The field still broadens. The challenge grows greater. And a future of
recognition and advancement may be here for you.

HOW CUTLER-HAMMER

CREATIVE ENGINEERING
HELPS INDUSTRY REACH
ITS AUTOMATION GOALS

Q. How long has Cutler-Hammer
been in Automation?

A. Long before the word “auto-
mation” was coined.

Many company historians view
the installation of the ﬁrst electric
turret-turning control for battle-
ships as our original “automatic
system” achievement. In 1904,
trials aboard the U.S.S. INDIANA
so improved rapid-ﬁre and gunnery-
control scoring that identical sys-
tems were installed on sister ships.

Q. How does your Automation-
or “System Control”—effort
differ from your other control
business?

A. We work in two areas of control.
One involves research, develop-
ment and manufacture of stand-
ardized electric control components
and apparatus. Here the customer
orders from us through a bill of
material.

The automation customer is dif-
ferent. He has no bill of material
—he has a problem. He needs to
improve production or quality, or
to reduce his unit costs. He isn’t
buying “hardware,” he’s seeking a
creative solution to a challenging
problem . . . and fhat’s what our
engineers provide.

Q. Assuming I decide to work
for a control manufacturer, why
Cutler-Hammer?

A. The most compelling reason is
our continuing interest and exten-
sive experience in “System Con-
trol.” This is the life of our com-
pany and distinct career advantages
result from this concern.

Our engineers are forced to apply
a combination of advanced elec-
tronic and electrical engineering

Ralph Millermaster, vice president,
engineering and development, answers the questions
most frequently asked by students regarding
Cutler-Hammer’s role in industrial automation

know-how to solve a customer’s
manufacturing problem. They start
with a thorough grounding in the
customer’s products-—how he
moves and works the materials he
manufactures. Then they apply
their technical knowledge to create
a practical solution. We have a
Materials Handling group, a Metal
Processing group, and many other
industry groups composed of young,
creative-minded engineers.

And, we don’t “stock-pile” our
engineering talent. Every engineer
we hire is expected to contribute
quickly and directly to the team
effort.

Q. How does Cutler-Hammer
approach an automation job?

A. We have learned that a sizable
system needs painstaking coordi-
nation between many groups-
project teams, engineering, mainte-
nance and purchasing personnel at
the customer factory and head-
quarters locations . . . machinery
builders, motor manufacturers,
contractors and many more.

We view this coordination as one
of our primary functions, and fulﬁll
it by furnishing all responsible
groups and individuals the infor-
mation they want and need to
guarantee an efficient dovetailing
of effort.

We organize a coordinating task
force for each project, headed by a
lead engineer and staffed by engi-
neers representing every necessary
technical discipline. That task force
is charged with three duties:

This approach has paid off! Long
recognized as a leader in standard-
ized motor control, Cutler-Hammer
is more and more being regarded
as a major contributor in industrial
automation. Our automation cre-
dentials include innovations in every

process lines to newspaper mail
rooms.

Q. How do I learn more about

capability and the career op-
portunities for engineers?

Director. Or, you can write direct
to T. B. Jochem, Cutler-Hammer,

hope that you will plan to meet
with our representative when he
visits your campus.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER OCTOBER 1962

New magnets are being developed from alloys having superconductive
properties. These small magnets are capable of producing field strengths

super magnets

equal to those of conventional magnets thousands of times their size.

For more than ﬁfty years, scientists
dreamed of building a super magnet
that would demand no energy once the
ﬁeld was set up. In order to construct
a “loss free” solenoid, it was realized
that the wire in the magnet would have
to possess zero resistance. The Dutch
scientist Kamerlingh Onnes, in 1911,
discovered superconductivity, the com-
plete disappearance of electrical resist-
ance in certain materials at tempera-
tures near absolute zero.

No sooner had Onnes discovered
superconductivity than scientists decid--
ed it would be theoretically impossible

24

THIS SUPERCONDUCTINC

by P. David Fisher

to construct a superconducting solen-
oid. The obstacle hindering the prog-
ress in applying the superconductivity
principle to solenoids came from the
fact that all research had indicated that
superconductivity could not exist in a
magnetic ﬁeld greater than a few thou-
sand gauss.

This theory, of course, ruled out the
possibility of producing “loss free”
windings for generating powerful mag-
nets. For example, a multi—turn solen-
oid made of known superconductors
could provide a strong, uniform mag-
netic ﬁeld, but the generated ﬁeld

would engulf the inner turns. When
the ﬁeld on the exposed turns would
exceed the “critical magnetic ﬁeld”
strength of the winding material, super-
conductivity would be quenched.
The problem facing the scientists,
therefore, was to develop a supercon--
ducting material, possessing a high
“critical magnetic ﬁeld,” along with a
high current density. Besides these two
qualiﬁcations, it was desirable to have
a ductile material so that it could be
drawn into a thin wire which would
be wound to form the solenoid.
Keeping these requirements in mind,

SOLENOID can develop a magnetic ﬁeld of 50,000 gauss.

'7.\

xy-

I‘.

scientists turned to the periodic table
and asked themselves which elements
or conﬁguration of elements are super-
conducting. Knowing which materials
were superconducting was the ﬁrst step
in building a feasible super solenoid.
After several years of testing for super-
conductivity in elements, the following
general rules were established for pre-
dicting whether a material would pos-
sess no resistance at temperatures near
absolute zero: (1) elements most likely
to be superconducting are those with
three, ﬁve, or seven valence electrons
and (2) superconductivity is most
likely to occur in elements or com-
pounds with relatively “open” crystal
structures. From their research, scien-
tists discovered that the elements ti-
tanium, vanadium, chromium, zirco-
nium, niobium, molybdenum, hafnium,
tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium could
be made superconducting by them-
selves or by alloying them with other
elements.‘

Now that the potentially supercon-
ducting elements and compounds had
been separated from the non—supercon-
ductors, scientists began to test each
material in order to determine its “criti-
cal magnetic ﬁeld,” the ﬁeld that is
needed to destroy the superconducting
properties of the material. Westing-
house Research scientists found that a
niobium—zirconium wire could be made
superconducting. The niobium in the
wire possessed a high current, while at
the same time a relatively low “criti-
cal magnetic ﬁeld.” Zirconium, on the
other hand, had a low current density,
but a high “critical magnetic ﬁeld.”

l.t was further discovered that an
alloy could be made in a variety of
compositions by using different ratios
of zirconium to niobium. As a result
of being able to vary the composition
of the niobium—zirconium alloy, the
solenoid is built in sections.

The inner sections, where the mag-
netic ﬁeld is strongest, is composed of
wire containing ﬁfty per cent niobium
and ﬁfty percent zirconium. This uti-
lizes the fact that the zirconium has a
high “critical magnetic ﬁeld,” enabling
the solenoid to produce a high mag-
netic ﬁeld before its superconductivity
is quenched. Then, in the outer layers
of the solenoid, where the magnetic
field is relatively weak, the wire is com-
posed of twenty-ﬁve percent zirconium
and seventy—ﬁve percent niobium. This

utilizes the fact that niobium, while
having a lower “critical magnetic ﬁeld"
than zirconium, has a much higher cur-
rent density. In all, six concentric lay-
ers are used in this super solenoid.

The niobium—zirconium magnet de-
veloped by Westinghouse weighs one
pound and is the size of a doughnut.
Although the solenoid wire is only
three times the thickness of a human
hair, it can carry a current of twenty
amperes. lf a wire the size of a piece
of chalk possessed the same current
density, it could carry 200,000 am-
peres. This small super magnet creates
a magnetic ﬁeld (43,000 gaL1ss) twice
as strong as that from a conventional
iron—core electromagnet, as large as an
automobile, weighing 40,000 pounds.
Such a conventional iron—core magnet
possesses its own power plant which
continuously supplies the 100,000
watts needed to run it. The niobium-
zirconium magnet, however, runs from
an ordinary automobile storage battery.
The only power the battery continuous-
ly supplies is a few watts needed to
overcome losses in the wire leading
to the magnet?

Besides the Westinghouse niobium-
zirconium super magnet, many others
have been developed. Bell Telephone
Laboratories has successfully construct-
ed a super magnet made of niobium
and tin, Nb;,Sn. This super solenoid
can produce a magnetic ﬁeld of more
than 88,000 gauss with a current densi-
ty of 150,000 amps/'cm3 at a tempera-
ture of 4.2°K. It is believed that this
magnet actually will remain supercon-
ducting in ﬁelds above 200,000 gauss.
Unfortunately, present test equipment
can only measure a magnetic ﬁeld up
to a strength of 88,000 gauss.

This niobium—tin super magnet may
some day replace the conventional
magnet using copper as a conductor.
Such a conventionel magnet requires a
power supply and cooling equipment
which literally ﬁlls several rooms.
While in operation, it uses thousands
of gallons of cooling water per hour
and consumes one and a half mega-
watts of electric power; this is twenty-
ﬁve percent of the total amount of
power consumed at the Bell Labora-
tories’ Murray Hill facility, where one
of these conventional magnets is in use
and where there are 2,500 employees.
In contrast, a superconducting solenoid
of Nb;.,Sn, while producing a compara-

AN M03Re SUPER SOLENOID capable
of producing :1 50,000 gauss magnetic
ﬁeld is held in the hand of this scientist.

scientist’s dream. Nb;;Sn has two dis--
tinct drawbacks. First, it is as brittle
as glass and requires special metal-
lurgical techniques to form magnetic
coils that can withstand the mechanical
forces produced by the high magnetic
ﬁelds. Second, Nb,-;Sn is not a ductile
compound. In order to prepare Nb;,Sn
“wire,” Bell Laboratory scientists have
to take a niobium rod approximately
one—fourth inch in diameter and drill a
one—eighth inch hole through it. After
plugging up one end of the tube, it is
ﬁlled with an intimate mixture of ele-
mental niobium powder and elemental
tin powder. This material is ﬁrmly
packed into the tube, and then the
other open end is sealed. The rod is
then swaged and drawn into “wire.”

When the “wire” has been correctly
shaped, its diameter is 0.015 cm. In
this state, while still in elemental form,
the Nb;,Sn can be wound to form the
core of the solenoid. Because of the
difﬁculty of forming the Nb3Sn super
magnet, scientists are looking for other
superconducting alloys that will be less
brittle and more ductile, while at the
same time having high current densities
and high “critical magnetic ﬁelds.”“

The question may now arise, “do
we need those super magnets?” The
answer to this question is emphatically,
yes! The availability of super strong
magnets will extend the operation of
many electronic communications de-
vices to higher frequencies, thus pro-
viding increased bandwidth for use in
radio—relay communications systems.

It enhances our chances for direct,
large—scale production of electric pow-
er. It will permit the substitution of
small, inexpensive electromagnets for
the large, expensive magnets presently
in use. The super magnets will make
possible a whole new generation of
atom smashers. It increases the possi-
bility of a magnetic “bottle” in which
the energy of the hydrogen bomb re-
action can be harnessed for useful
power. Finally, the new super solen-
oids make more feasible some of the
far—out methods proposed for long-
distance travel in space.

Many metallurgical and electrical
problems have yet to be solved, but the
age of the super magnets is coming
upon us. The average man may never
see, nor care to see, these powerful
magnets. Nevertheless, men’s lives will
be enriched by their presence.

Learning never stops for engineers at Western Electric

There's no place at Western Electric for engineers who feel
that college diplomas signify the end of their education.
However, if a man can meet our quality standards and feels
that he is really just beginning to learn. . . and if he is
ready to launch his career where learning is an important
part of the job and where graduate-level training on and off
the job is encouraged — we want and need him.

At Western Electric, in addition to the normal learning-
while-doing, engineers are encouraged to move ahead in
their fields by several types of educational programs.
Western maintains its own full-tirne graduate engineering
training program, seven formal management courses, and a
tuition refund plan for out-of-hours college study.

This learning atmosphere is just one reason why a career
at Western Electric is so stimulating. Of equal importance,
however, is the nature of the work we do. Our new engi-
neers are taking part in projects that implement the whole
art of modern telephony from high-speed sound transmission
and solar cells, to electronic telephone oflices and computer-
controlled production techniques.

Should you join us now, you will be coming to Western
Electric at one of the best times in the company’s history.

In the management area alone, several thousand supervisory
jobs are expected to open up to W.E. people within the next
10 years. And our work of building communications equip-
ment and systems becomes increasingly challenging and
important as the communications needs of our nation and
the world continue to increase.

Challenging opportunities exist now at Western Electric for electrical,
mechanical, industrial, and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business maiors. All qualified applicants will
receive careful consideration for employment without regard to race,

A Message for Student Engineers

The Chairman of the National Placement Committee for the AMERICAN
ASSOCIATION OF INDUSTRIAL EDITORS wrote the University of Pitts-
burgh Director of Student Publications in September. The following

quotation from that letter should interest student engineers.

“In all honesty, I must confess that the majority of companies seek
experienced personnel. There are those, however, who have a need for
a #2, 3, or 4 man in their communications department and it is in these
cases that recent college graduates have an opportunity to enter the indus-

trial journalism ﬁeld.”

Staff members of the Skyscraper Engineer have in recent years obtained
positions with:

drinking water from the sea

As the world water shortage becomes critical, it will be economical to

desalinize ocean water. Several attempts by various processes are now

being studied in hopes of solving this problem in the near future.

With the world’s water shortage ex-
pected to reach the critical stage in the
next ten years, an increased effort is
being made to ﬁnd some economical
means of purifying the brackish water
that covers three-ﬁfths of the globe.
By the year 2000, it is estimated that
the United States alone may need as
much as 880 billion gallons of fresh
water a day, an amount which is more
than 300 billion gallons greater than the
nation’s estimated usable water supply.

In 1952, the United States Govern-
ment set up the Olﬁce of Saline Water
under the Department of the Interior
in an effort to solve this problem.
Congress allocated ten million dollars
for an eleven year research and devel-
opment program in salt water conver-
sion. In 1958 an additional ten million
dollars was authorized to build various
demonstration plants in order to inves-
tigate the most advanced desalting
processes now available.

Rocketdyne has built a pilot plant
near Oxnard, California, that uses a
freeze process for the conversion of sea
water to fresh water. In the process,
incoming sea water is ﬁrst cooled, then
frozen to form crystals of fresh water.
The fresh water crystals are then sepa-
rated from the brine surrounding them,
washed, and melted to obtain water
for domestic and industrial uses.

At Wrightsville Beach, North Caro-
lina, a salt—to—fresh—water conversion
pilot'plant using General Electric’s new
thin-ﬁlm distillation process is being
built. The General Electric pilot plant
will consist of two stages, each with 15
distilling units. Each unit consists of a

by Raymond Niro

vertical tube about 10 feet high and 6
inches in diameter. Salt or brackish
water is continuously wiped in a very
thin ﬁlm of about .001 of an inch by
special wiper blades over the inside
surface of a heat—transfer tube. Heat
energy from steam passing over the
outside surface of this tube causes the
thin ﬁlm of feed water to evaporate
rapidly. The product vapor rises, is
condensed and is drawn off, providing
pure water, while the concentrated
brine is drained off at the bottom.

One of the most recent methods of
saline water conversion is the ﬂash
evaporation process used by Westing-
house at its Point Lorna California,
conversion plant. The evaporation
process selected for the Point Loma
plant has been known for some time.
Basically it is the process by which
nature produces fresh water from the
ocean by utilizing the energy of the
sun. In principle, ﬂash evaporation is
a relatively simple process. It consists
of spraying warm or hot water under
pressure into a chamber that is at a
lower pressure and temperature. A
portion of the water “ﬂashes” into
vapor and is condensed. This ﬂashing
results from the difference in heat stor-
age ability of the water under high and
low pressures.

In the “ﬂash” process, brine is
pumped through a brine heater where
its temperature is raised by low pres-
sure steam. The steam condenses giv-
ing up its latent heat to the brine.
Heating of the brine is carried out at a
pressure above its saturation pressure,
so that vaporization does not take place

at any of the heat transfer surfaces.
The brine is then passed through a
restriction into the ﬂash chamber which
is maintained at a lower pressure by
the evaporator condenser. A portion
of the brine “ﬂashes” instantaneously
into vapor. The evaporator condenser
then Iiquiﬁes the distillate by transfer-
ring the latent heat of the ﬂashed vapor
to colder water. A desired purity of
water is achieved by passing the ﬂashed
vapor through appropriate steam sepa-
ration devices.

Multistaging is used to increase the
ratio of produced distillate to supplied
steam. By ﬂashing in several stages,
each at a lower pressure and lower
temperature than the preceding one,
the latent heat contained in the ﬂashed
vapor of each stage is used to preheat
the recycle brine. The steam added in
the brine heater is used merely to give
the ﬁnal increment of temperature rise
to the recycle brine before it enters the
ﬂrst ﬂash chamber.

Every multistage ﬂash distillation
process which uses the recycle system
of operation has three basic elements:
(1) heat addition section, (2) heat re-
covery stages and (3) heat rejection
stages. (See ﬁgure . ., page 37). The
recycle brine ﬂow is heated from tem-
perature T2 to T1 by external heat
addition supplied to the brine heater.
The recycle brine is next introduced
into the ﬂrst ﬂash chamber and ﬂows
from stage to stage until it reaches the
lowest stage (T3), at which point it is
recycled. The vapors that are ﬂashed
off in each stage are passed through

separators to prevent carry over of the
ﬂashing brine into the product water.
The vapor is then condensed on tubes
in the same stage. The condensate
ﬂows from stage to stage and leaves the
system at the lowest temperature stage
by means of the product water pump.
Each of the stage condensers in the
recycle circuit or heat recovery stages
functions to heat the recycle ﬂow cir-
culating inside the tubes.

Heat rejection from the system is
accomplished by sea water coolant
(temperature T4) which is pumped
through the tubes of the heat rejection
condensers. The number of heat re-
jection stages is usually determined by
the economics of a particular site loca-
tion. A portion of the sea water dis-
charge is used for make—up to the
system. The make—up is introduced
into the lowest temperature ﬂash cham-
ber, which it is mixed with recycle
brine. The combined recycle brine is
then pumped to the tube side of the
heat recovery stages. Continuous blow-
down and make—up feed maintain a de-
sired concentration of the recycle brine.

The Westinghouse Point Loma sea-
water conversion plant consists of a
36—stage ﬂash evaporator with product
water cooling facilities, oil-ﬁred boiler
plant, sea water intake pump and
screen pit, brine outfall line, submarine
intake line, and building for office con-

trol room, laboratory and maintenance

shop. The plant is located on a site
which is 36 feet above mean low water
level immediately adjacent to the
ocean. The sea water intake extends

approximately 760 feet from the shore
line and consists of a 24-inch concrete
pipe which is laid in a trench on the
ocean ﬂoor. The inlet is located 6 feet
below mean low level and the sea water
ﬂows by gravity into a pump pit on
the shore line. A vertical multistage
sea water pump provides the required
quantity of sea water to the plant.
Sea water entering the plant is chlori-
nated for control of marine fouling in
the sea water intake system.

All processes have, to a degree,
problems which through various means
hinder their effectiveness. The ﬂash
evaporation process is no exception.
Heat loss by radiation and convection
to the outside environment must be
considered as must conduction through
interstage partition walls which results
i.n a degradation of heat. Pressure drop
losses should also be considered. There
will be a drop in saturation tempera-
ture due to pressure drop when the
ﬂashed vapor passes through moisture
separators or undergoes changes of
direction before entering the stage
condenser where it condenses. Ther-
modynamically, this is an additional
effect to the boiling point elevation.

Also included in the pressure drop
loss category are losses which are in-
curred during the ﬂashing—oﬂ process.
Disengagement of the vapor bubbles
from the liquid brine is accomplished
with a minimum of pressure drop. The
process requires that the vapor be
physically removed from contact with
the liquid by promoting turbulence and
increasing the surface area for maxi-
mum vapor release. Both heat and
pressure drop losses must be compen-
sated for by increasing the heat sup-
plied to the heat addition section. The
problem of scale formation can also
hinder the efficiency of the process.

Untreated sea water which is heated
and concentrated as required by mod-
ern eﬂicient distillation plants will form

precipitates which deposit as scale on
heat transfer and other surfaces of
evaporator equipment. These scale de-
posits act as thermal insulators which
reduce the eﬂiciency of the evaporation
process, and which necessitate plant
shutdowns at frequent intervals in
order to remove scale formations. The
three principaltypes of sea water evap-
orator scale deposits are calcium car-
bonate (CaCo3), magnesium hydroxide
(Mg (OH)2) and calcium sulfate

posits however can be controlled by
adjusting the hydrogen ion concentra-
tion (pH) of the water and through
the use of chemical additives which
retard precipitation.

Water produced by the Point Loma
plant is at least 99.995 percent pure
which means that there are less than

million parts of water. Within the next
ten years larger plants, improved de—
signs, and lower cost materials will

Small car onomy with big car performance

Breakaway acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in just a fraction
over 8 seconds. That is the unheard of big car performance
achieved with small car economy by a popular 1962 auto-
mobile turbocharged by Garrett-AiResearch.

The Garrett turbocharger is the first controlled for opti-
mum performance at all driving speeds. No matter how fast
or slow you may be traveling, sudden acceleration and extra
pulling power are there instantly and smoothly when you
need them—on any grade at any altitude.

How is it possible? The Garrett turbocharger, driven
entirely by the engine’s waste exhaust gases, sucks in larger

amounts of outside air and forces maximum fuel-air
charges into the cylinders. This means better combustion,
more power.

Other areas of concentration at Garrett include: space
life support systems, solar and nuclear power systems,
electronic systems, air conditioning and pressurization
systems, computer systems and small gas turbines for both
military and industrial uses.

2000 mph airliner...another engineering challenge!

On the drawing boards of aircraft
engineers, plans are taking shape
for a supersonic passenger jet —
one that will ﬂy from New York
to London in just over 2 hours, at
Mach—3 speeds of 2000 m.p.h. or
more. The delta-shaped transport,
flying at altitudes up to 80,000
feet, would make today’s fastest
airliners seem as pokey as stage-

coaches. And what size! Perhaps
two hundred feet from nose to
tail. Three stories tall.

Through the intensive research
of the metallurgical engineer will
come a metal for the skin of this
mighty airliner. One that will be
able to withstand critically high
temperatures — up to 630°F —
caused by supersonic speeds.

Challenging? An engineering
career, such as metallurgy, is full

The Mec/Iunical Properties of Electrolytic Deposits‘ by A. T.
Vagramyan and Yu. S. Petrova. 108 pages. Paperback. Con-
sultants Bureau Enterprises, Inc. New York. ($12.50)

This authorized translation from the Russian gives a
comprehensive picture of electrolysis. The text is supple-
mented by numerous illustrations, graphs, and tables which
increase one’s understanding of the more difﬁcult passages.
“The Hydrogenation of Metals,” “Methods of Studying the
Hydrogenation of Electrolytic Deposits,” “The Adsorption
of Surface—Active Substances in Electrodeposition,” and
“The Mechanical Properties of the Electrolytic Deposits”
are a few of the topics covered, emphasizing the effect of
different variables in the electroplating process.

Some of the variables which affect hydrogenation are
the nature of the metal, current density, temperature, and
the pH of the electrolyte. “Experiment has shown that the
temperature of the electrolyte is one of the principle factors
in ﬁxing the occlusion of hydrogen by a deposit. . . . an
elevation of temperature from 20 to 63 reduces hydrogen
occlusion to less than one—third of its original value.”

Distortion of the crystal lattice and occlusion of foreign
substances give rise to internal stress. Internal stress varies
with such factors as the nature and state of the base, current
change, and depth of deposit, but these factors vary from
metal to metal.

Synopsis: The authors begin by giving a microscopic

§.§§

View of electrocrystallization and go on to explain that ad-
sorption of gases is a prime factor in the structure of the
ultimate metal. In the third chapter, methods of studying
hydrogenation of electrolytic deposits are discussed. The
rate of evolution of hydrogen and the mechanism of its
occlusion are discussed in terms of the three types of
hydrogen bonding, and an indication of the interrelationship
between hydrogenation, overvoltage, and internal stress is
shown using various comparisons. Numerous factors give
rise to internal stress; however, only one of the possible
factors is responsible for the stress in each particular case.
Closely related to the problem of internal stress is the
porosity, which determines the quality and corrosional sta-
bility of the electrolytic deposit. Moreover, the adhesion
of the deposit to the base depends on the character and
magnitude of the internal stress. “The hardness of the
electrolytic deposit is always greater than the hardness of
a sample of the same metal prepared by other means,” but
there are other factors affecting the hardness of the elec-
trolysis deposits. Brittleness is an undesirable quality which
cm result from occlusion of hydrogen, foreign metals,
surface—active substances, and other materials.

The work under consideration is too specialized for
general college—leve1 work, but would be of utmost interest
to anyone working with electrolysis. Metallurgical, elec-
trical, and possibly chemical engineering students might
ﬁnd the text of interest, especially if the student has some
particular interest in the ﬁeld.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER OCTOBER 1962

reasons four 

Mr. Vasanth K. Bhat
642 Southcrest Court
Pittsburgh 26, Pa.

Dear Vasanth,

A few days ago you asked me to outline the purposes of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER so that you might tell
others about it in taped interviews to be broadcast on the Voice of America. Having given considerable thought to your
request, I feel that there are four main objectives that the magazine should accomplish. These objectives are: (1) to enable
engineering students to publish original papers, (2) to provide an opportunity for students to become familiar with the
printing arts, (3) to inform students of job opportunities through advertisements, and (4) to promote a feeling of unity
throughout the Schools of Engineering and Mines.

The ﬁrst objective is the one which I consider to be most important. Engineering students who have written original
papers, either related to engineering subjects or their outside interests, should have some outlet for presenting these works
to the public and their fellow students. Often these papers involve research the student has carried on for his own interests
or as a result of a pre—graduation project or job. Other times the articles are original works. A student such as yourself
might have the ability to combine astronomical and chemical data to predict whether there is water on the planets of our
solar system. The very fact that someone has thought his subject worthy to devote enough time to write a paper makes it
imperative that it be at least considered for publication so that others may read and note the material.

The second objective is only slightly less important than the ﬁrst, and this is mainly because it does not affect so many
students. Printing is an art—an art that can only be appreciated by working with it from the editing to the printing. Just
a few weeks ago, for example, a new staff member attended a layout session. “I never knew there was so much to do!”
exclaimed the student. Like many others, this student had been under the impression that our office served only to receive
the material to be printed. This material, according to the student’s thinking, was immediately sent to the printer, and in
a few days magically returned in the form of the magazine bought by our customers. Nothing could be further from the
truth, as the new staff member soon learned. Last August, when I visited the plant where this magazine was printed, I
came away convinced that the printers did even more work on the magazine than we. By working on the staff of the
magazine, students can obtain experience in both the editorial and business branches of publication.

The third objective should be well received by all students who want to explore their job opportunities in depth.
Although some may not recognize this, the advertisers in the SK YSC'RAPER are encouraging students to work for them.
Simply writing to any of the companies advertising in this magazine will result in a wealth of material describing employ-
ment salaries and other beneﬁts. This is not to say, of course, that our advertisers are the only companies who hire Pitt
graduates, but the very fact that they advertise for students signiﬁes a great interest in obtaining the services of new engineers.

The fourth and ﬁnal objective I have listed is the promotion of unity throughout the Schools of Engineering and Mines.
This is accomplished in two ways. First, the magazine is presented to the University and the public as a group accom-
plishment. It is remarkable that students from different departments can work together to produce a magazine which is
interesting to all of them. The staff works together in all phases of publishing, including proof—reading, laying—out articles
and features, and even selling the magazine when the long awaited day arrives. Second, students receive recognition for
the ﬁne papers which have been published. Achievement, like recognition, can be either a singular or a group affair.
But group recognition enables the student to gain an extra satisfaction from his work because others appreciate it.

Perhaps this list of objectives is somewhat incomplete as far as details are concerned, but I am sure readers will agree
that these objectives present the overall purposes of the magazine. There is, however, the matter of personal opinion
which must also be considered, for others may think the objectives of the SK YSCRA PER to be more than I do. “That is
in the nature of things.”

If you have any questions or would like more information, please write soon.

Sincerely yours,

awr/»/f

Kodak beyond the snapshot...

what makes hickory’
the way it is

  

This photomicrograph shows the basic
structure of hickory wood. It was taken
on a plain, ordinary microscope with a
BROWNIE Camera. For details on this
use of BROWNIE Cameras, request a
copy of “Photomicrography with Simple
Cameras” from Eastman Kodak Com-
pany, Sales Service Division, Rochester

_BROWNIE Camera is. I I

GOOD LIFE.

Plenty of lively work at Kodak research-
ing, engineering, producing, and market-
ing all sorts of things.

MAKING CHEAP THINGS WORK WELL IS A SOPHISTICATED TECHNICAL PERSUASION ISA

(random notes)

. Huntley with rope"

May we please plant a little spore in’
the brain intended to grow into a career
not previously contemplated?

Sound, businesslike outﬁts need well-
grounded engineers to run their photo-
graphic operations. This doesn’t neces-
sarily mean making the candid shots at
the boss’s daughter’s wedding.

We have made a 42-minute movie
called “Photography at work. . . a
progress report.” (To show it, write
Eastman Kodak Company, Professional
Photographic Sales Division, Rochester
4, N.Y.)

Mr. Chet Huntley narrates. We take
you inside a cake being baked in Day-
ton. We puzzle you with a monstrous
camera intended to take pictures in
Cincinnati without perspective. We show
you how they test a new hydrofoil on
Lake Washington and what nooks and
crannies a camera can explore when
ﬁtted with ﬁber optics. We take you to
lots of places, starting on a classy note
with the hunt for anti-matter at
Brookhaven.

If we create the impression that the
great linear accelerator there is nothing
but another camera accessory, do not
conclude that perspective is being
shunned in Rochester as well as in Cin-
cinnati. There is a ‘_‘low technology”
that civilizations evolve over the mil-
lennia for hewing the wood and drawing
the water of everyday life and a “high
technology” that is called into existence
by the demands of pure science and
then very kindly lowers a rope to haul
up the “low technology”. Maybe 1520
feet of movie ﬁlm is better than rope.

 

GOOD LIFE.

The improvement of
capacitors

Our polyester is different from other
polyester. We add a cyclohexane ring to
the unit structure, whereas other poly-
ester is ust poly(ethylene terephthalate).
The added ring protects against moisture,
raises the melting point, and gives cus-
tomers some reasons of self-interest to
seek out the trademarks KODEL on
polyester ﬁber and TENITE on poly-
ester molding granules.

When the president of Kodak visited
the lab where, in addition, its electrical
advantages were discovered, we set up
ten .05-p.fd 200-v polyester capacitors
for him, identical except that ﬁve had
the ring and ﬁve didn’t. We put them
all in an oven at 185°C and applied 700
volts of do across them. Within 3 minutes
all ﬁve of the p(e t)’s had shorted out.
This was the logical moment for the
president to leave, but realism is com-
pany policy. The president wanted to
watch the ﬁrst of ours fail. It took 10
minutes. That was four years ago.

We then replaced 15 of the regular
capacitors in a TV set with our kind and
set it to running 9 hours a day, 7 days
a week. All other components that
failed we replaced. For the Electrical
Insulation Show early this year, we
removed the set from the room where
the lab manager hides it and took it to
Washington. It was the hit of the show.
The coincidence that it happened to be
the only TV set in the hall on the day
when the ﬁrst American was orbiting
the earth might have helped focus atten-
tion on it. It would not have been a
good place for a capacitor to blow.

 

THE GOOD LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FILLED WlTH
TENSION.

An interview with General Electrie’s W. Scott Hill

Q. Mr. Hill, l’ve heard that my first-

five years in industry may be the most
critical of my career. Do you agree?
A. Deﬁnitely. It is during this stage
that you’ll be sharpening your career
objectives, broadening your knowledge
and experience, ﬁnding your place in
professional practice and developing
work and study habits that you may
follow throughout your career. It’s a
period fraught with challenge and op-
portunity——and possible pitfalls.

Recognizing the importance of this
period, the Engineers’ Council for Pro-
fessional Development has published
an excellent kit of material for young
engineers. It is titled “Your First 5
Years.” I would strongly recommend
you obtain a copy.*

Q. What can I do to make best use
of these important years?
A. First of all, be sure that the com-
pany you join provides ample opportun-
ity for profiassional development during
this critica phase of your career.

Then, develop a planned, organized
personal _ development program——tai-
lored to your own strengths, weaknesses
and aspirations——to make the most of
these opportunities. This, of course,
calls for a critical -self appraisal, and
periodic reappraisals. You will ﬁnd an
extremely useful guide for this pur-
pose in the “First 5 Years” kit I just
mentioned.

Q. How does General Electric en-
courage self development during this
peﬁod?
A. In many ways. Because we recog-
nize professional self-development as a
never-ending process, we encourage
technical employees to continue their
education not only during their early
years but throughout their careers.
We do this through a variety of pro-
grams and incentives. General Electric’s
Tuition Refund Program, for example,
provides up to 100% reimbursement for
tuition and fees incurred for graduate
study. Another enables the selected
graduate with proper qualiﬁcations to

obtain a master’s degree, tuition free, --

while earning up to 75% of his full-
time salary. These programs are sup-

Manager—l:'ngineering Recruiting

One of a series . . .

How to Make the Most
of Your First Five Years

MR. HILL has managerial responsibility for General Electric’s college recruiting activities
for engineers, scientists, PhD’s and technicians for the engineering function of the
Company. long active in technical personnel development within General Electric, he
also serves as vice president of the Engineers’ Council for Professional Development,
board member of the Engineering Manpower Commission, director of the Engineering
Societies Personnel Service and as an officer or member of a variety of technical societies.

plemented by a wide range of techni-

. cal and nontechnical in-plant courses

conducted at the graduate level by
recognized Company experts.

Frequent personal appraisals and en-
couragement for participation in pro-
fessional societies are still other ways
inwhich G.E. assists professional em-
ployees to develop their full potential.

Q. What about training programs?
Just how valuable are they to the
young engineer?
A. Quite valuable, generally. But there
are exceptions. Many seniors and grad-
uate students, for example, already have
clearly deﬁned career goals and profes-
sional interests and demonstrated abili-
ties in a speciﬁc ﬁeld. In such cases,
direct placement in a speciﬁc position
may be the better alternative.
.Training programs, on the other
hand, provide the opportunity to gain
valuable on-the-job experience in sev-

- eral ﬁelds while broadening your base

of knowledge through related course
study. This kind of training enables
you to bring your career objectives in-
tosharp focus and provides a solid
foundation for your development, wheth-
er your interests tend toward speciali-
zation or management. This is par-
ticularly true in a highly diversiﬁed
company like General Electric where
young technical graduates are exposed
to many facets of engineering and to
a variety of product areas.

Q. What types of training programs
does your company offer, Mr. Hill?
A. General Electric conducts a num-
ber of them. Those attracting the ma-
jority of technical graduates are the
Engineering and Science, Technical
Marketing and Manufacturing Train-
ing Programs. Each includes on-the-job
experience on full-time rotating assign-
ments supplemented-by a formal study
curriculum. ~

Q. You mentioned professional so-
cieties. Do you feel there is any ad-
vantage in joining early in your career?
A. I do indeed. In fact, I would rec-
ommend you join a student chapter on
your campus now if you haven’t already
done so.

Professional societies offer the young
engineer many opportunities to expand
his fund of knowledge through associa-
tion with leaders in his profession,
to gain recognition in his ﬁeld, and to
make a real contribution to his profes-
sion. Because General Electric beneﬁts
directly, the Company often helps de-
fray expenses incurred by professional
employees engaged in the activities of
these organizations.

Q. Is there anything I can do now to
better prepare myself for the transition
from college campus to industry?

A. There are many things, naturally,
most of which you are already doing
in the course of your education.

But there is one important area you
may be overlooking. I would suggest
you recognize now that your job—
whatever it is—is going to be made
easier by the ability to communicate

. effectively. Learn to sell yourself
and your ideas. Our own experience at
General Electric—and industry-wide sur-
veys as well—indicates that the lack
of this ability can be one of the major
shortcomings of young technical grad-
uates.

*The kit “Your First 5 Years,”pub-
lished by the Engineers’ Council for
Professional Development, normally
sells for $2.00. While our limited sup-
ply lasts, however, you may obtain a
copy by simply writing General
Electric Company, Section 699-04,
Schenectady, New York.
